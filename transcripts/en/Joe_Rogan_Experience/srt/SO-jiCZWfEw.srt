1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,380
No follow.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,100
We took three [inaudible]

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,160
boom.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,560
And we're live Henry
motherfucking pseudo world champ.

5
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:13,351
And Sir,

6
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:16,080
introduce yourself to everybody
and the captain America.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,951
That's right.

8
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:20,070
Captain Eric Alibaba seen a Henry's coach.

9
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:20,431
You,

10
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:20,641
uh,

11
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:20,811
what,

12
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:21,041
what,

13
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,980
what do you do with them specifically?

14
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:23,791
Well,

15
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:27,630
I've been with him since 2004 and
recently became his coach right before the

16
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:29,730
first Denise Johnson fine.

17
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:34,110
And I'm as head coach for Nma and you're
in disguise in case some other athletes

18
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:36,270
try to swipe it and it's Halloween.

19
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:37,051
Happy Halloween.

20
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:38,640
Everybody happy the folks.

21
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:39,571
So,

22
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:39,840
uh,

23
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,351
first of all,

24
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:40,651
man,

25
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:42,480
congratulations on your victory.

26
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,260
Um,

27
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,370
it does it feel like,

28
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,541
oh man,

29
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,730
it's it.

30
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,110
Uh,

31
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,943
it feels good.

32
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,511
It feels good.

33
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:50,610
Try to keep this silly a
fist away from your face.

34
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,450
Uh,

35
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,680
it feels good because it's,

36
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:53,320
um,

37
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,153
cabinets.

38
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,990
I think as a competitor you,

39
00:00:55,991 --> 00:00:57,180
you live for these moments.

40
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:57,570
She lived,

41
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,130
you live for these fulfillments,

42
00:00:59,131 --> 00:00:59,964
you know,

43
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,200
I think somebody like,

44
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,520
and then I told people
since the beginning,

45
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,510
it wasn't so much,

46
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:04,591
you know,

47
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:05,391
the UFC belt,

48
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:06,570
but it was because it was,

49
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,270
I made it about Demetrius
and it was about Demetrius.

50
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,450
You know,

51
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,530
cause he's mean,

52
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:14,430
he is widely considered to be the
best pound for pound fighter ever.

53
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,050
And you're the first guy,

54
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,540
not only to beat him
but the first guy who,

55
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,940
not just to beat him but me
beat him in like 11 years,

56
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,070
but the first guy to win an Olympic
gold medal in wrestling and a UFC

57
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:26,904
championship.

58
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,180
I mean those are two
gigantic accomplishments.

59
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:30,510
Yeah,

60
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:30,631
no,

61
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:31,141
for sure.

62
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:31,974
It's almost like,

63
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:32,940
ah God,

64
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:33,330
it's,

65
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:33,721
it's,

66
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:34,660
I beat the greatest of,

67
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,390
to me the greatest of all time.

68
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:37,560
And then on top of that I be,

69
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:37,980
you know,

70
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,813
I can,

71
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,710
I can make the run for,

72
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:40,981
you know,

73
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:43,260
who's the greatest combat
athlete of all time?

74
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,070
Like it's a,

75
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,530
I'm a two sport world champion.

76
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:46,021
I'm just like,

77
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:46,860
Damn.

78
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,530
I mean you're absolutely
in the running now.

79
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,161
I mean if,

80
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,540
if he's not the greatest of all time,

81
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:52,470
I think he is,

82
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,530
but the argument is that he didn't face
people as good as John Jones faced and

83
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:02,760
then fade or is the other fade or an
Anderson silver or the other people that

84
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:04,770
are in consideration for
the greatest of all time.

85
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:05,620
I mean,

86
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:05,950
it's,

87
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,560
it's just a subjective argument.

88
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:07,741
I mean,

89
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:07,951
who,

90
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:08,940
who knows who's right,

91
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,470
but obviously you beat without
a doubt one of the best ever.

92
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,401
Yeah.

93
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:14,740
Yeah.

94
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,720
And like I would,

95
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:16,680
I would tell people there's,

96
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,760
there's a bit of a of admiration
that I had for Demetrius Johnson.

97
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,511
Like I was,

98
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:22,344
uh,

99
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,633
it was,

100
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,211
it was like,

101
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:24,391
you know,

102
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:25,640
you're fighting the dude that's,

103
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,100
that's,

104
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,950
that almost seems untouchable that you,

105
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,270
a guy that makes you question yourself.

106
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,460
Like,

107
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:30,780
Whoa,

108
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,613
this is,

109
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,813
this is this,

110
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,960
this guy's that good.

111
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,201
Well,

112
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:36,900
what's crazy is you beat him
after he had stopped you.

113
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:37,670
Just how,

114
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,580
how long was it?

115
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:39,414
Two years.

116
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,110
Ah,

117
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,110
but close to about two
and a half years ago now.

118
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,500
Yeah.

119
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:43,860
About,

120
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,550
I was like,

121
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,260
I think two years and like four months.

122
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:46,920
That's,

123
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,510
that's an amazing turnaround
between getting stopped in
the first round and then

124
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:56,100
coming back and beating him and beating
him in the championship rounds is really

125
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:56,970
where you pulled it off.

126
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,360
Yeah,

127
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,601
yeah,

128
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:57,871
yeah,

129
00:02:57,871 --> 00:02:58,704
no,

130
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,070
that,

131
00:02:59,070 --> 00:02:59,741
absolutely.

132
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:00,040
I

133
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,180
had studied Demetrius Johnson like I
seen as a lost son the first time would,

134
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,290
I pretty much did is I got,

135
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,550
I got rid of a lot of people,

136
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,450
including my,

137
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,040
my MMA had coach.

138
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,480
I just,

139
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,650
my whole philosophy was,

140
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:13,840
if I can't be the best and
there's something wrong,

141
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,603
you know,

142
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,451
emotionally,

143
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:17,021
physically,

144
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:18,400
everything else just invested.

145
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,691
And when I lost,

146
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:20,081
I'm just like,

147
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:20,340
man,

148
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,320
I need to,

149
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,090
I,

150
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,560
I'm looking for a better leader,

151
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,551
you know?

152
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:25,210
And,

153
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,290
and that's kind of what I did.

154
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:26,741
I ended up,

155
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:26,950
you know,

156
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,560
letting go a lot of my cornerman can,

157
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:30,610
I started traveling the world.

158
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,650
W went out to Singapore,

159
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,300
we're now to Wa to Thailand.

160
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:34,991
Went out to,

161
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:35,740
uh,

162
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,940
to the Netherlands,

163
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:40,150
spend months and months
at a time out in Brazil.

164
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,141
Like I,

165
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:41,351
uh,

166
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:43,180
I was on a quest that was like the,

167
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,710
I kind of remind myself,

168
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:45,101
literally like,

169
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:46,600
ash catch him from Pokemon.

170
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,141
Like,

171
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:48,270
I was just on a venture dude,

172
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:49,330
I have no idea who that is.

173
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,450
The vision called vision quest.

174
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:57,451
It was Matthew Modine mood swing
swing has to watch that movie

175
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,011
and that's,

176
00:03:59,011 --> 00:03:59,121
and,

177
00:03:59,121 --> 00:03:59,300
and,

178
00:03:59,300 --> 00:03:59,521
and,

179
00:03:59,521 --> 00:03:59,711
and,

180
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:00,510
and it'd be,

181
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:00,931
like I said,

182
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:01,770
it became an obsession.

183
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:01,961
I,

184
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:03,480
I knew that if anybody could do it,

185
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:03,781
it'd be,

186
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:04,710
it'd be Hennish the Hudl,

187
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:05,371
like I really did.

188
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,050
And you even after the first time,

189
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:07,830
Jill,

190
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,670
when he beat me,

191
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,380
I still,

192
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,091
when they asked me,

193
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:11,311
he's like,

194
00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:12,144
Henry,

195
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,950
you know,

196
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:13,730
like I would,

197
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,563
I was like,

198
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:14,941
guys,

199
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:15,391
I don't know,

200
00:04:15,391 --> 00:04:18,210
but I still know that I could beat him
even being knocked out like two minutes

201
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:19,230
and 36 seconds.

202
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,120
Like I still knew in my heart.

203
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,281
Uh,

204
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:21,871
UFC one,

205
00:04:21,871 --> 00:04:22,990
I sat there press conferences.

206
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,960
I know I'm still the one that beat him.

207
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,720
What was it about

208
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,040
him that made you think
that you could beat him?

209
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,550
What was it about you specifically
in relation to him and his skill set?

210
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,590
It was a,

211
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,723
um,

212
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,470
I,

213
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,130
if you're asking me what the difference,

214
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,550
what was it that made you think even
after he stopped you in the first round?

215
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,403
Oh God.

216
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,343
Uh,

217
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,860
I think it was more so
just believing in my,

218
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,090
in my abilities.

219
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,680
I think me just believe in Mora.

220
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:51,981
Okay.

221
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:52,251
Henry,

222
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,084
you need time.

223
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,300
Like I was only doing MMA for three
years when I fought him the first time.

224
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:56,531
Yeah.

225
00:04:56,531 --> 00:05:00,130
A lot of people don't know that year's
you see you fighting for the title.

226
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:00,611
Not once,

227
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:01,444
but twice.

228
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,820
The price probably been doing
MMA for a long ass time.

229
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:05,440
But when you find them for the first time,

230
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,611
it's a very,

231
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:09,580
that's a very short amount
of time to be finding an MMA.

232
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,160
It's especially again to caliber athletic.

233
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:12,940
Demetrius,

234
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,370
what year did you win the Olympics and,

235
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:16,204
oh wait,

236
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,541
yeah,

237
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:17,420
see that is,

238
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,960
I mean when you're doing that,

239
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:22,090
you're 100% dedicated to wrestling.

240
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,021
You have to be,

241
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:23,680
right.

242
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,650
So were you doing any striking
training at all back then?

243
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:27,620
Um,

244
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,161
did I did,

245
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,500
what happened was once I won the Olympics,

246
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,343
almost kind of,

247
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,010
I fell out of love with the sport.

248
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:34,670
I fell,

249
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,900
I fell out of love with Russ.

250
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:38,990
And I remember being at the
Olympics and being like,

251
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:39,201
man,

252
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:39,730
I just,

253
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:42,380
I don't know if I have it in me no
more just cause you're burnt out.

254
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:42,741
I was,

255
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:43,574
yeah,

256
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,860
my whole childhood was
gone because of the sport.

257
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,260
Take that crazy mask off.

258
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:47,750
Part of that.

259
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,583
What are you doing?

260
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,920
I mean I've been waiting
for you to say that.

261
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,020
We'll do it in stages.

262
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,450
So you,

263
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:01,820
you,

264
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,050
you fell out of love with it.

265
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,010
I fell out of love with it.

266
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:04,290
Which is,

267
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:04,771
which is it?

268
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:08,430
Just because your whole life had been
dedicated to wrestling and you'd finally

269
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:10,350
achieved the greatest of great goals.

270
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:10,710
Yeah.

271
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,600
Olympic gold medalist is
the top of the mountain.

272
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,041
No,

273
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:14,060
but check this out Joe.

274
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,480
And it was like in the year of 2007,

275
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,830
um,

276
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,041
man,

277
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,450
I went through the worst year ever.

278
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:20,781
Like,

279
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:24,500
I was ready to become a world champion
and I went out to the world champions in

280
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:26,840
2007 and I didn't even score a point.

281
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,490
I can the first round,

282
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:33,020
like I got put out by Bite Juran and
a for somebody in that whole year,

283
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:33,201
man,

284
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:35,510
I was just going through freaking
struggles like left and right.

285
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:38,120
You're talking about just that versus I
couldn't want to turn him in to save my

286
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:38,780
life.

287
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,613
What was it?

288
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,970
Um,

289
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,720
I don't know.

290
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,480
I don't know.

291
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,550
I truly,

292
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:44,301
truly don't know.

293
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:44,991
I think I was,

294
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,770
uh,

295
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,830
I think I probably begin kind
of fallen out of love with it.

296
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,360
And I remember there was,

297
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:50,691
to me,

298
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:52,940
there was only two tournaments that
everyone has to win and that was,

299
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,660
that was the Olympic trials and
eventually the Olympic Games and,

300
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,071
and somehow like,

301
00:06:58,071 --> 00:06:59,180
cause I'm correlating this with the,

302
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:02,810
with the fight with
Demetrius Johnson and uh,

303
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,800
I remember,

304
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,401
you know,

305
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:04,940
just,

306
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,070
just almost being in tears.

307
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:10,190
Like I just don't know if
this is for me and the,

308
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:11,150
but I just stuck with it.

309
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:11,984
I stuck with it.

310
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,400
I ended up putting the Olympic trials.

311
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:14,270
I ended up going to the,

312
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:14,511
you know,

313
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:18,110
the Olympic Games and I ended up pretty
much fallen behind in every single

314
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:18,700
match,

315
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:18,961
uh,

316
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:19,820
that I was wrestling.

317
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:20,990
So the,

318
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,180
these are kind of the adversities
that I was going through,

319
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:24,950
like leading up to become
an Olympic champion.

320
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:25,641
You know,

321
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:27,230
it's interesting when you were fighting,

322
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:27,890
um,

323
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,390
Demetrius for the second time,

324
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,253
Daniel Cormier,

325
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,970
some said something very interesting.

326
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,073
He said,

327
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,400
most guys,

328
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:34,851
he goes,

329
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,260
I would never give a chance.

330
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,560
You,

331
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,840
you get stopped by Dj.

332
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,050
And then a couple of years
later you're fighting him again.

333
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,541
Like he's,

334
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,620
he's going to have your number,

335
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,140
he's going to be better in the rematch.

336
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:45,831
And he goes,

337
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:46,311
but Henry,

338
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:46,871
so who knows,

339
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:48,080
a different kind of athlete.

340
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,290
He,

341
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:53,290
and he talked about you competing and
then coming back a year later and,

342
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,320
and being,

343
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,341
he goes,

344
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:56,660
he was many times better.

345
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,411
He goes,

346
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:57,531
the,

347
00:07:57,531 --> 00:08:01,910
the amount of improvement that he got
in just one year was just unbelievable.

348
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,070
Yeah.

349
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,561
And I think,

350
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:03,860
you know,

351
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,860
I guess she could know that teaching
netics I think you could talk a lot about

352
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,340
desire to just having the
sex only get you so far.

353
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,020
The Olympics has,

354
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,470
has g great genetics for sure.

355
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:16,131
But it's almost,

356
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:17,150
it almost becomes a,

357
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,013
uh,

358
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,861
a mentality.

359
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:20,390
I'm because of a philosophy.

360
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:24,490
It's like you almost start doing things
almost like two to not feel that,

361
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,460
to not to not feel the pain of losing.

362
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,210
Hmm.

363
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,730
Like that's a motivator to
not feel the pain of losing.

364
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,100
And I remember when
Demetrius Johnson hit me,

365
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,320
hit me and hit me in
the leg and I literally,

366
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:37,420
I don't think you put your,

367
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,151
how severe it was.

368
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,960
Like I literally spraying like a,

369
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:44,420
a severe low ankle sprain in those
first 30 seconds in the second fight.

370
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,270
So I fought Demetrius Johnson like that.

371
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,961
But it was,

372
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:48,321
it was,

373
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,490
to me the motivator was like,

374
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:49,701
man,

375
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:51,630
I don't want to feel
that pain of losing more.

376
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,301
I hate it man.

377
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:54,620
I hate feeling second place.

378
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:55,660
I hate feeling Kinda,

379
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,620
kinda somewhat.

380
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,560
He's looking over me.

381
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,930
Someone's a almost like a
manhood cha and I hate that.

382
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,000
Was it a low leg kick that been made your,

383
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,761
your ankle go?

384
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:06,550
Like what was it?

385
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,201
It was a,

386
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:09,060
there's a nerve that you have behind La,

387
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,960
like the bonus up PR,

388
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,270
I think it's the brand
peripheral peripheral nerve p.

389
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:15,900
E.

390
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,110
R.

391
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,943
Yeah.

392
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,480
And I got hit there so I put my foot to
sleep just like when Michael Chandler,

393
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,460
it happened to him in Beltour.

394
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,403
Same thing.

395
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,031
Exactly.

396
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,770
Stepping on it and it's just not working.

397
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,290
And the pro and the reason,

398
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,540
these reasons why everybody
kind of got scared.

399
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,090
I mean cause I was,

400
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:31,950
I was hurt,

401
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,480
but I remember before the fight,

402
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:33,870
I remember,

403
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,450
I remember I saw my cornerman
like kind of wait for,

404
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,110
I fought the meters.

405
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,060
I remember I saw him all.

406
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:38,894
Ah,

407
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,970
I saw him on nervous and never see,

408
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,610
I remember grabbing my cornerman is
putting them right in front of me.

409
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:45,191
I remember telling him,

410
00:09:45,191 --> 00:09:45,340
I said,

411
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,173
hey guys,

412
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,730
I've been here before.

413
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,920
Like I was ranked 31st in the world.

414
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:50,131
I'd be,

415
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:50,580
I know,

416
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:50,920
I,

417
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,740
I became a world champion in wrestling.

418
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:53,881
Like guys,

419
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:54,430
like,

420
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:54,770
yeah,

421
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,850
I want you guys to have a
little faith in the deed,

422
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,480
but I'm going to ask you guys one
thing and I'm going to ask you guys,

423
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,250
I'm going to ask you guys to be composed.

424
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,581
I said,

425
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:05,280
the key to winning this fight
is for me to be composed.

426
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,580
And then pretty much
there's six hours later,

427
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:08,820
they,

428
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,510
uh,

429
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:09,991
right before,

430
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:10,201
you know,

431
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:11,640
walk on the start playing my song.

432
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:14,010
I looked back at my corner and I said,

433
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:14,844
uh,

434
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,361
and I said,

435
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:16,194
guys,

436
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:16,591
I said,

437
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:17,430
the key to this fight,

438
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:19,320
remember I said it'd be composure.

439
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,390
So when Denesha Johnson kicked me,

440
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,050
like I,

441
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,730
I believe in my own philosophy,

442
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:24,301
I went back to,

443
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:24,600
all right,

444
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,930
my composure because I was hurt.

445
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:26,610
Y'All.

446
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,710
Like he could have stopped me that,

447
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,110
that first round I was forced
to switch south South Paul,

448
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,850
which had never fight in South Pole,

449
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:33,901
you know,

450
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:34,734
so now we're kind of,

451
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,080
I worked with me and Demetrius
Johnson or playing poker,

452
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,220
my whole philosophy and the key to
this victory was a composure part.

453
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,631
And,

454
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:42,810
uh,

455
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,643
when he hit me,

456
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,431
I,

457
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:44,850
uh,

458
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,720
I really did.

459
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,141
I was like,

460
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:46,860
oh my God,

461
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,660
not again did not again,

462
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:50,790
I'm not going to last two
minutes and 36 seconds.

463
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:51,624
Not Again,

464
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:52,561
but it again,

465
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:55,440
the motivator was not to
feel the pain to lose again.

466
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,240
Like it wasn't a desire to win.

467
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:57,601
I was like,

468
00:10:57,601 --> 00:11:00,870
I just don't want to feel that
pain anymore as a competitor,

469
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,733
as somebody that,

470
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,221
that,

471
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:05,100
that that's on a mission
to that sacrifices life.

472
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,410
Explain to someone who's
never experienced that before.

473
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:08,540
What is that pain like?

474
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,890
You train for how many weeks and then
you find mighty mouse with the title.

475
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:15,120
You get stopped in the first round.

476
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,480
What does our pain La man,

477
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:16,950
it's,

478
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,600
I think every fighter has a spirit.

479
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,190
Like what is the spirit?

480
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,530
The spirit is your spirit.

481
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:23,251
Is your dream.

482
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:24,220
This bird is that,

483
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:24,991
that you know,

484
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:27,330
you've watched somebody
become a world champion.

485
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:27,661
You want to be,

486
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:27,781
hey,

487
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:29,100
I want to be just like that guy.

488
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,421
Your confidence,

489
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:31,470
your self esteem.

490
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:32,300
That's,

491
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,230
that's your spirit and you will also,

492
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:36,270
we also have a spirit of
a war that's like the,

493
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,590
the man has side of it.

494
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,350
And what happens when I got
stopped with Demetrius Johnson to,

495
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:41,101
I almost felt like,

496
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,480
and I've never gone through this,

497
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:45,260
not even in wrestling my life like ours,

498
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,650
like my spirit was shot and I had to kind
of pick up my pieces to kind of start

499
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,701
healing myself.

500
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:53,140
Like mentally and I feel like it,

501
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:53,780
and if,

502
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,070
if

503
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,970
you look at a Joe with somebody like
Roy Jones jr he got knocked out one time

504
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,370
and it became a domino effect.

505
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:00,970
Yeah.

506
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,840
Because he never,

507
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,460
he never picked off those pieces.

508
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:05,080
He never started healing that spirit.

509
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:05,400
Well,

510
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,300
he got knocked down again real bad right
afterwards by Glen Johnson to members.

511
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:09,900
There's two,

512
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,080
two knockouts in a row.

513
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,750
Tarver Tarver k Odom and then [inaudible].

514
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,743
But the thing is,

515
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,290
there's a lot of factors involved in
that loss because I think Roy was also

516
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:24,490
coming off of the John Ruiz fight where
he gained a lot of weight to get up to

517
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:25,031
heavyweight,

518
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:27,970
and then he had to lose that weight to
get down the light heavyweight again.

519
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:33,150
So he was lean at heavyweight and then
all of a sudden he's dropping down to 175

520
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:34,444
pounds again.

521
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,130
And he just looked like,

522
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:36,790
shit,

523
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,020
it looks smooth.

524
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,070
It looked like his body was all sucked
in and I just think it was a bad,

525
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:43,150
bad weight cut.

526
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,910
And you know,

527
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,400
I think whatever he took to get himself
up to 200 pounds to it was probably out

528
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,234
of its system.

529
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,830
And now his body was,

530
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:51,061
you know,

531
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,840
his hormones were probably all fucked up.

532
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,490
He just wasn't the same guy.

533
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:54,851
I mean,

534
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:55,001
it's,

535
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:55,601
let's be real,

536
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:56,160
right?

537
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,620
The weekends,

538
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,280
it's important.

539
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,750
You don't just grow the 200 pounds
without some Mexican supplements.

540
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,663
This like,

541
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,481
you know what I'm saying?

542
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:04,780
I mean,

543
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,780
it'll take a long fucking time for 168
pound fighter to get up to 200 pounds.

544
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,580
It takes a long time.

545
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,250
If you want to really
get up to 200 pounds,

546
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,681
like a,

547
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:17,350
an actual 200 pound body,

548
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,710
not just like fill yourself
up with water and fat.

549
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,101
No.

550
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:23,440
Did to actually be 200
pounds of way he was,

551
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,680
your body's got to,

552
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,511
your body's got to say,

553
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:25,901
hey man,

554
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:27,250
we need to fucking grow.

555
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,240
We got resources that need to
be allocated towards muscle.

556
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:31,810
We've got to,

557
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,620
we've got to gain all this weight because
w we're lifting weights all the time.

558
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:36,341
We're doing things.

559
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:39,340
You have to do something to get your
body that heavy so that and then all of a

560
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:41,170
sudden it shut that shit off and say,

561
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,080
right now we're getting down to one 75
and you've got to do it in a few months.

562
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,880
I think his body was just wrecked.

563
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,170
Yeah.

564
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,290
Boxes don't always cut
weight the right way either.

565
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,910
Neither do I may fighters.

566
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,120
Oh,

567
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,800
particularly back in the day there's,

568
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:56,740
which is really interesting about the
approach that you guys took to this camp

569
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:57,820
that you wanted to talk about,

570
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:58,781
which is a very,

571
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:02,420
very scientific approach towards your
recovery towards training methods.

572
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:03,254
So it's everything.

573
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:03,830
I mean,

574
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:04,370
you,

575
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:09,100
you really had it dialed in as
opposed to just trying to wing it,

576
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,240
which for many,

577
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:12,760
many years was how almost
every fight or did it.

578
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,540
Yeah,

579
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,180
and I think it's a how,

580
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:15,271
oh,

581
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,091
we got a video.

582
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:16,900
Look at this.

583
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,471
I found that part.

584
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:18,560
We got kicked and you can see like,

585
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:18,800
oh,

586
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,633
okay.

587
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,103
So

588
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,160
it was right there.

589
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,970
Just the back of the leg like that.

590
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,830
That is so crazy.

591
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,630
Just one shin to the mat.

592
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,710
I still fly.

593
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,730
I'm still flopping.

594
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,180
Yeah.

595
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,680
So I'm going back to that philosophy.

596
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:36,221
Composure.

597
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:36,461
Look,

598
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:37,260
I'm still flopping,

599
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,000
but it doesn't seem like he
understands what's happened to you yet.

600
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,600
Yeah.

601
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:40,820
You know,

602
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:40,971
you're,

603
00:14:40,971 --> 00:14:41,250
you,

604
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,850
you played poker so well.

605
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:45,100
Yeah.

606
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,030
Really interesting.

607
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,331
Yeah.

608
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:46,541
Look,

609
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,130
I'm still,

610
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:47,750
oh,

611
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,200
oh.

612
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,020
As soon as that happened,

613
00:14:50,021 --> 00:14:53,570
I did remember the Michael Chandler fight
and I remember he went on a show and

614
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:55,010
said exactly what happened.

615
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,870
So I told uh,

616
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,850
our other corners Santina
the frank and when we get in,

617
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,340
put ice on his knee,

618
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,490
not his ankle because it
was the where it happened.

619
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:07,910
Cause I watched that show and I
remember watching it for that reason,

620
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:08,900
to wonder why,

621
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,513
what happened to them.

622
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,450
It's crazy when you watch it because
it's just the foot hit the back of your

623
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:15,284
knee.

624
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:15,860
Yeah.

625
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,260
You know?

626
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:16,820
Yeah,

627
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,720
you can see it again.

628
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:19,610
I mean it wasn't even the
hardest kick in the world.

629
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:23,630
He kind of caught you at the very end
with his foot and immediately that nerve,

630
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,100
just one [inaudible] right here.

631
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,460
Swap worked right there.

632
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:27,800
Hey,

633
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,633
barely

634
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,713
know.

635
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,940
You know who it also happened to was
a Scott Jorgenson did it won't fight.

636
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,120
Was that man,

637
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:38,451
you know what?

638
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:39,231
I can't remember,

639
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:40,640
but he didn't win the fight.

640
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:41,331
I can tell you that.

641
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:41,520
Yeah.

642
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:41,990
Anyways,

643
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,450
it was a terrible feeling.

644
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,081
Terrible,

645
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:46,070
terrible feeling.

646
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,990
Well you poker face your way through it.

647
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,101
But again,

648
00:15:49,101 --> 00:15:49,281
Joe,

649
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,990
like it goes back to philosophy.

650
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,340
Like you got to believe in your,

651
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:52,961
you gotta,

652
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:53,840
you gotta be up here.

653
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,160
There has to be a philosophy,

654
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,600
a period against a guy like the meat.

655
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:56,901
She was like,

656
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:58,000
there's the,

657
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:58,551
it's,

658
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:00,890
it's beyond the physical
and the technical stuff.

659
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,310
Yeah.

660
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,031
Like you gotta be,

661
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:04,610
you gotta be just kind of
hit Matteis the up here.

662
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:04,951
Well,

663
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:05,930
you have to have everything,

664
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:06,201
right?

665
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:07,580
You have to have the physical skills,

666
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,640
but you also have to have
this an unstoppable mindset.

667
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,593
Yeah.

668
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,590
Now what do you,

669
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,730
what kind of mind training do you do?

670
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,080
Do you,

671
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,060
do you do any visualization training or
do you work with a sports psychologist

672
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,943
or,

673
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,530
um,

674
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,370
do you know what I,

675
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:22,970
uh,

676
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,990
I like,

677
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,880
I like reading up on a
lot of people stores.

678
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:27,650
I think people's stores
are the ones that are,

679
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:28,484
that intrigued me.

680
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:28,881
You know,

681
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:29,714
how,

682
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,150
you know how Michael
Jordan Rose to the top or,

683
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,900
uh,

684
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,400
at least like that I think.

685
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,600
I think that's the stuff that I,

686
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:36,320
uh,

687
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,670
I got like a human interest.

688
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,500
That's kind of my motivation.

689
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,610
Like reading biographies,

690
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,720
reading biographies,

691
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:42,410
or watching,

692
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,670
watching stuff on Youtube,

693
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,020
like,

694
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,430
uh,

695
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:44,690
you know,

696
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,170
watching him,

697
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,030
I gave him watching even
watching other sports,

698
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:47,341
like I'll,

699
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:48,870
I'll watch Michael Johnson's at,

700
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,753
at times,

701
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,230
you know,

702
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,220
wha watching them one than 96 Olympics,

703
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,610
like things like that.

704
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:54,444
And,

705
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,810
and watching people celebrations and,

706
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,930
and uh,

707
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,350
and tried to embrace the feeling of,

708
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,250
of what they're feeling,

709
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:01,420
you know,

710
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:01,781
cause it,

711
00:17:01,781 --> 00:17:02,870
it becomes like an addiction,

712
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:03,680
like a drug,

713
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,660
like going through these feelings of like,

714
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,890
did I accomplish what I,

715
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,230
what I,

716
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,360
what I set out to do.

717
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,120
Right.

718
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,120
So you like seeing them accomplish
these fantastic goals and visualizing

719
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:16,230
yourself experiencing
that exact same thing.

720
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:16,830
Yeah.

721
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,140
Yeah.

722
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,630
As corny as that sounds.

723
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:19,010
Yeah.

724
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,260
Doesn't sound corny at all.

725
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,120
Especially not coming from the champ.

726
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:22,871
You know,

727
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:23,770
once you're the champ,

728
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,880
all that corny shit's out.

729
00:17:24,881 --> 00:17:26,290
The window works.

730
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,610
People start believing it.

731
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,430
Uh,

732
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,070
all of a sudden I became a 10.

733
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:30,590
Yeah.

734
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,720
They believe the fuck out of it.

735
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,650
Now they're talking about you
possibly fighting Tj Dillashaw for the

736
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:36,670
bantamweight title.

737
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,050
Uh,

738
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:38,550
yeah.

739
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,400
My name is Tom.

740
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,323
Just talk,

741
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:40,930
you know,

742
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,090
you just hesitated and you,

743
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,953
they come on,

744
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,680
there's negotiations,

745
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,110
there's a BC high and
that it's not just tough.

746
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,040
He wants it.

747
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,640
We want it.

748
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,320
Yeah.

749
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,153
I'm sure.

750
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:50,790
Um,

751
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,780
where's that at right now?

752
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,411
Because a,

753
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:52,771
there's a,

754
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:56,640
there's going to be a card in January
out here and it was just announced.

755
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,210
Oh Wow.

756
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:58,690
When did,

757
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:58,890
uh,

758
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,061
what,

759
00:17:59,061 --> 00:17:59,894
what date was that?

760
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,260
It's the same night as the
fade or Ryan Bader fight,

761
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:05,720
which pisses me off because I
wanted to go see that fight.

762
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,110
Yeah.

763
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,420
January 26.

764
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:07,701
Yeah.

765
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:10,400
That fight is going to
be at the forum and the,

766
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:15,290
a UFC fight I think is at the
staple center or maybe Anaheim.

767
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,183
Anaheim,

768
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,030
Anaheim,

769
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,140
Anaheim in the pond.

770
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:18,651
Oh,

771
00:18:18,651 --> 00:18:19,250
okay.

772
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,083
Both of here.

773
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,830
Both here in California.

774
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,220
Well,

775
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,350
just 20 million
motherfuckers in California.

776
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,090
Plenty of people that go around.

777
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,580
Yeah.

778
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,460
Terms of audience.

779
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,010
Yeah.

780
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:28,341
We've,

781
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:28,730
we've,

782
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:28,851
uh,

783
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:30,260
I think there's been talks,

784
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:30,861
but it's been,

785
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:31,220
you know,

786
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,010
you know,

787
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:32,251
we,

788
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:33,170
I don't think Ali,

789
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,130
my manager has really truly like
actually sat down and talk with the UFC,

790
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,761
I think.

791
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:39,380
I think everybody wants to do it though.

792
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,380
Well,

793
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,480
it's one of two things
is going to happen there,

794
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:42,810
right?

795
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,411
It's either,

796
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:43,800
um,

797
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,750
I mean now the DJ has gone to one.

798
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,740
Um,

799
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,740
Demetrius Johnson just left the UFC
and went over to one FC in a one fc for

800
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:55,410
people who have no idea what we're talking
about is a gigantic organization in

801
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:56,130
Asia.

802
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,860
They are literally the
equivalent to the UFC in Asia.

803
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,220
And although many people in
America are not aware of them,

804
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:03,060
they don't know who they are.

805
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:05,940
They're a huge organization overseas,

806
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,710
absolutely gigantic.

807
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,210
And they do a fantastic job.

808
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,100
They have real high level fighters.

809
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:11,670
Uh,

810
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,770
Ben asked her and was their champion.

811
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,150
He was undefeated over there and
he had I think at least one fight,

812
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:20,130
maybe two fights left in his contract.

813
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:20,964
I forget how many,

814
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,360
and they made a deal and the deal was
they take mighty mouse and we get Ben ass

815
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:27,300
grin.

816
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,440
And so that's where it's at right now.

817
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,310
I love the deal.

818
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:29,970
I love it.

819
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,990
I love the idea of it.

820
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:31,850
I mean,

821
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,220
um,

822
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,450
I feel like mighty mouse,

823
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:34,831
you know,

824
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:35,461
he,

825
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:35,820
um,

826
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,930
he loves the idea of starting
new in a new organization.

827
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,980
And you know,

828
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,050
they're going to hey,

829
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:43,884
that motherfucker,

830
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,583
hey,

831
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,140
nice.

832
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:47,380
Yeah.

833
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:48,990
All these fly with and to get paid.

834
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,741
Exactly.

835
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:54,741
And he also likes the mentality that
that organization is operated with,

836
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,671
which is,

837
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:57,120
um,

838
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,530
respect for the martial arts.

839
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,610
They're not into this,

840
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:00,301
you know,

841
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:02,070
what we saw with the Conor McGregor could,

842
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:03,450
could be a number of Madoff fired,

843
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,190
all the trash talking and all the,

844
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:08,670
all the stuff that you're seeing that
was becoming more and more prevalent in

845
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:09,504
the UFC.

846
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,141
You,

847
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:10,530
uh,

848
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,630
you don't see that at all at one FC.

849
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:14,490
And that's something that a mighty mouse,

850
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:15,324
very happy.

851
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:15,931
Yeah.

852
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:16,561
I think first,

853
00:20:16,561 --> 00:20:17,830
I think congratulations to,

854
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:19,770
to Ben Astro and I think he's a,

855
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:20,710
yeah.

856
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,620
Everybody's in trouble.

857
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:22,360
Yeah.

858
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,730
It's a lot of mother fuckers are in
trouble and Penn asking if the whole view,

859
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:26,331
you're like,

860
00:20:26,331 --> 00:20:27,470
why can't I get up?

861
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:27,910
Yeah.

862
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,150
Bet.

863
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,310
But Nashville is one of
those guys that he's very,

864
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:31,144
uh,

865
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,040
he's a very confident,

866
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:36,910
he's a very dangerous human mean because
he knows that he's going to be very

867
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:37,601
confident about it.

868
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:38,230
Yeah.

869
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,770
And,

870
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,603
um,

871
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,660
I've always told people,

872
00:20:40,661 --> 00:20:40,931
I says,

873
00:20:40,931 --> 00:20:41,670
hey dude,

874
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,780
maybe the best in the world is on the UFC.

875
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:44,051
Man.

876
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:44,380
There's,

877
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:44,981
there's some do.

878
00:20:44,981 --> 00:20:47,350
But I ain't even been
asked when we met him.

879
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:48,850
He prays for years.

880
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,870
That will take people think could
be as a control is good up top.

881
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,160
You wait till you get a,

882
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:54,640
you know,

883
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,640
for time NCAA finalist to time and see
a chap on top of you that the 2008 in

884
00:21:00,271 --> 00:21:01,900
Olympia and his teammates yet.

885
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,430
And Andy Olympian,

886
00:21:03,431 --> 00:21:04,420
I mean the dude is,

887
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,280
that dude is,

888
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,970
he's a bad matchup for anybody,

889
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:07,240
Joe.

890
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,980
Anyway,

891
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,221
no,

892
00:21:08,221 --> 00:21:08,800
Ben ask her.

893
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,970
And I mean there's a reason why he's
undefeated and he hasn't been hit in

894
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:12,960
several fights.

895
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,450
Who was detailing one of
the last time we got hit,

896
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:16,280
you know,

897
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,220
I had him on the podcast because I
wanted to let people know about them.

898
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:20,581
I mean,

899
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:24,090
I've been a big fan of bay fan of Ban
aspirins from back when he was a belt or

900
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:24,924
champion.

901
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,310
And if you watch his fights and belt
or against chorus cough and yeah,

902
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,530
and Lima Lima's a beast man.

903
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:33,330
And he just dominated them.

904
00:21:33,331 --> 00:21:35,520
Just controlling the Lima fucks people up,

905
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:36,060
man.

906
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,260
Lima's a dangerous,

907
00:21:37,261 --> 00:21:38,250
dangerous Kat.

908
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,170
And Ben asked grinches whoop,

909
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,471
Oh,

910
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:41,360
you're on your back again.

911
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:41,910
Look at that.

912
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:42,091
Yeah,

913
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:43,860
you can't get up and you taking punches,

914
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,691
you know?

915
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:46,260
And he's a,

916
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,930
it's a just a different
caliber of wrestling.

917
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,580
And I've said it many,

918
00:21:50,581 --> 00:21:51,420
many times and I bet,

919
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,800
I'm sure you believe it as well.

920
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,900
It's the most important skill for MMA.

921
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,853
Wrestling.

922
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,150
It's,

923
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,930
it dictates where the fight takes place.

924
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,340
If you want to stand up,

925
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,031
you get,

926
00:22:00,031 --> 00:22:02,550
the guy can take you
down chuck Liddell style.

927
00:22:02,551 --> 00:22:03,990
And if you want to go to the ground,

928
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,240
you're the one who gets to dictate
where the fight takes place.

929
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,660
That's if you're the superior wrestler.

930
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,181
I mean,

931
00:22:09,181 --> 00:22:11,760
it's the best base for MMA.

932
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,683
I really believe that.

933
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,320
And especially a guy like banks,

934
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,700
I think Ben knows that his,

935
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,680
his strikings not that good.

936
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,190
Right?

937
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,780
So he just relies on this is,

938
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:24,070
this is what I know I do a better than
anybody and I'm going to control this and

939
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,360
you're going to know
how I'm going to do it.

940
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:25,751
You know?

941
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:26,584
So that's what,

942
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,280
that's what makes been asking.

943
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,880
He's so dangerous.

944
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:34,950
I mean a real bad fight for him would be
someone that can figure out how to keep

945
00:22:34,951 --> 00:22:35,611
it standing.

946
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:38,610
Like Jay hair on gave him a
real tough fight and Bella tour,

947
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,200
cause Jay Hiran is good wrestler and
kept the fight standing high school.

948
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,201
I forget what his,

949
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:45,570
what his take on that fight was.

950
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:47,460
We talked about it on the podcast,

951
00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:50,910
but I don't think he was too happy
with his training for that fight.

952
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,440
But you know,

953
00:22:52,441 --> 00:22:56,400
someone like Tyron Woodley who's also
a very good wrestler who's a very

954
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:58,890
dangerous striker would be
a tough match up for them.

955
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:01,890
But they're really front close
friends and training partners.

956
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:02,461
Yeah.

957
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:05,350
Well this is another thing too
on the flip side is like a,

958
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,490
Taryn has been wrestling
him since for years I think.

959
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,370
So he knows what the
Ben Ashkan experiences,

960
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:11,581
you know,

961
00:23:11,581 --> 00:23:12,540
and that's scary.

962
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,260
Yeah.

963
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,700
I mean people would be lucky to,

964
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:15,750
you know,

965
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,150
kind of take them down if you really
want to give it a no take downs.

966
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:18,720
He wouldn't,

967
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,280
he just wouldn't let
people take them down.

968
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,711
Yeah.

969
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:21,970
Paris was talking about it,

970
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,241
you know,

971
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:22,661
he's saying,

972
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:23,110
listen,

973
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,520
it was back when Paris was the champ.

974
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,700
He said if I was forced to
fight Ben ass and he goes,

975
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:29,650
it would be a fucking
terrible fight from me.

976
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:30,611
He's like,

977
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:33,130
that guy just take me down
and beat the shit out of me.

978
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:33,830
He's like,

979
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,910
that's what he does
then was to win a belt.

980
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,400
The 2008 Olympic team
would have five belts.

981
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:40,970
Henry gets to DC,

982
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,320
has to and and uh,

983
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,680
Ben Asca and we'd have
one that's five belt.

984
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:46,400
If,

985
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,260
if he came into the UFC and won the belt,

986
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,220
his teammates,

987
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,270
well they are going to open up
eventually that 165 pound division,

988
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:54,620
which is what Ben is shooting for.

989
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:56,030
Ben would like that division.

990
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:56,900
Um,

991
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,380
you know,

992
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,210
and if he said that,

993
00:23:59,211 --> 00:23:59,570
if you know,

994
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,330
he had one 65 and tire and
kept the welterweight title,

995
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:03,200
that would be great for him.

996
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,070
I just don't see the UFC doing a five
pound weight difference when all the other

997
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,570
weight differences are so huge.

998
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,230
I feel like the smart move
would be 10 pounds every,

999
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,153
every spot.

1000
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,280
35455560570 five like move 70 to 75 like
when the UFC had a light heavyweight

1001
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:23,660
division initially that the
division was a 200 pound division.

1002
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:27,260
When Tito Ortiz first one and I
believe it was 200 pound division,

1003
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,960
and then they raise it up to
two oh five and I think just in,

1004
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,380
they needed a one 95 too.

1005
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,131
I really believe,

1006
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:36,290
and it probably a two 25 you know,

1007
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:36,950
I think that would,

1008
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,870
that would round it all out,

1009
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,970
which probably will all happen eventually.

1010
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,251
Yeah.

1011
00:24:42,251 --> 00:24:42,491
Yeah.

1012
00:24:42,491 --> 00:24:42,771
It's,

1013
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:44,090
that's interesting to see how that,

1014
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,170
how that unfolds.

1015
00:24:45,171 --> 00:24:45,861
But as of now,

1016
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:47,690
it's man Ashkin,

1017
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,890
she's a beast.

1018
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,120
She's going to be fighting for the belt.

1019
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:50,690
Pretty silly.

1020
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:50,811
Well,

1021
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:52,990
he's calling out Darren till
he wants to fight Darren,

1022
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:54,950
which I love.

1023
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,993
I love that.

1024
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:56,570
That is,

1025
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,240
that is a classic striker
versus grappler match up,

1026
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,400
especially after tiring.

1027
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,360
Just smashed him.

1028
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,470
I mean,

1029
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,170
Tyron and the hype train
for Darren till we,

1030
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,610
we learned a lot about Darren.

1031
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:09,440
Darren is a sensational striker,

1032
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,071
very,

1033
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:11,240
very dangerous striker,

1034
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,640
but keeps his hands low,

1035
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:15,020
keeps his chin up high.

1036
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,920
And you know,

1037
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,840
Tyron has proved himself to be really
dangerous even against elite strikers.

1038
00:25:20,841 --> 00:25:21,081
You know,

1039
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:22,250
you look at the Wonderboy fights,

1040
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:23,330
I've said this time and time again,

1041
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:24,200
you look at those two fights.

1042
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,400
Wonderboy is known as being one of the
best strikers to ever compete in the UFC.

1043
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,750
He's got a crate,

1044
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,410
I think it was 57 and o was a kickbox
or something fucking spectacular like

1045
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:34,010
that.

1046
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,420
Amazing striking skills.

1047
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,780
But yet Tyron hurt him in both fights,

1048
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,531
both fights.

1049
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:43,370
Tyron was the one who landed big
shots and had Wonderboy badly hurt.

1050
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,810
And then you look at the same thing with
Darren till Darren tills known as being

1051
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:49,250
this unbelievable striker.

1052
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,720
Tyron clips him,

1053
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,130
drops him,

1054
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,210
and then strangles him.

1055
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,070
So you know,

1056
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:55,471
it,

1057
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:55,630
it,

1058
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:55,821
it,

1059
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,080
it all changes with MMA.

1060
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,990
These guys can beat these
guys can be the best,

1061
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,340
even the best wrestlers.

1062
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:02,174
Like sometimes it,

1063
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,880
it doesn't translate to those sport.

1064
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:07,830
Like it takes a special somebody
to adapt to the sport of MMA,

1065
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:08,960
not just a rustler.

1066
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,440
Yup.

1067
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,810
And I think Tyron has
has adapted to his time,

1068
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:12,830
to his right hand.

1069
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:13,791
Uh,

1070
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:14,420
you know,

1071
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:14,690
man,

1072
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,050
if you're able to take out two strikers,

1073
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:17,390
you like that about you're the real deal.

1074
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,330
He's on your unquestionably
the real deal deal.

1075
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,580
I'm fascinating to see whether
or not Norma Medoff and um,

1076
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,540
then grin go at it.

1077
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:28,803
Got To me,

1078
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,000
I had a fight that I really,

1079
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,350
why did you sign in Floyd Mayweather
for stop all that nonsense.

1080
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:37,240
I,

1081
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,260
this is just what we were talking
about is not going to happen.

1082
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,190
He has the same age.

1083
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:40,820
Yeah.

1084
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,310
Listen,

1085
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,143
that ain't going to happen,

1086
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:46,500
but it could be as much more
of a grab where the needs are.

1087
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,490
Then he is a striker.

1088
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,280
I mean Connor is a striker
that that's sort of made sense.

1089
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,050
If you want to talk about levels.

1090
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:53,890
I think a Benz,

1091
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,430
I think Ben said barbecue

1092
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,140
better.

1093
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,560
The better grappler wound.

1094
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,433
The fuck knows.

1095
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,760
That's what I want to see.

1096
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:01,271
No,

1097
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:01,991
I want to see that.

1098
00:27:01,991 --> 00:27:02,440
But there's,

1099
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,280
there's Lavalle was like,

1100
00:27:03,281 --> 00:27:05,140
even though like they don't
give black belts in Ruskin.

1101
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:05,470
There's,

1102
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:05,830
there's,

1103
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,920
there's lab was too,

1104
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,780
and I think I've been asking,

1105
00:27:08,781 --> 00:27:10,520
it was one of the greatest folks.

1106
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,860
Dot Writers of all time.

1107
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,690
Like that's how dangerous he is.

1108
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:14,883
He's putting the best,

1109
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,040
the best kids in the world
and pretzels and submissions,

1110
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,030
they just wouldn't get out of,

1111
00:27:19,031 --> 00:27:20,090
is it,

1112
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,550
he's like a bowl constricted.

1113
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:21,930
Well he's,

1114
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,530
he's

1115
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,730
dunning in his ability to control guys.

1116
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:25,211
Like you're like,

1117
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:26,440
what the fuck man?

1118
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:27,610
Like chorus golf,

1119
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,361
I mean,

1120
00:27:28,361 --> 00:27:31,940
and Lima are two great examples cause
you look at those guys and Bella tour and

1121
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,070
they'd just smash people.

1122
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,480
But to Korskoff has one of the craziest
spinning back kick knockouts I've ever

1123
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:38,314
seen in my life.

1124
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,840
He sent this dude flying through the air.

1125
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:41,630
Do you see that?

1126
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,990
A couple of fights ago and the Grand Prix

1127
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,170
fucking nasty.

1128
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,770
He hits this dude is spinning back kick
and literally like launches them into

1129
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:53,740
space and then smashes him when
he goes down to the ground.

1130
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,400
I mean you look at what lean has been
able to do to people when the Roy

1131
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,390
MacDonald fight was a very close fight.

1132
00:27:58,391 --> 00:27:58,840
Look at this,

1133
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,673
watch this.

1134
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,460
Look at this.

1135
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,293
Boom.

1136
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,000
He lost that too.

1137
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,820
Is that in Boise?

1138
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:07,990
I don't know where that was,

1139
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,090
but so Koresh cough,

1140
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:10,721
you know,

1141
00:28:10,721 --> 00:28:12,760
if you watched the Korotkoff fight with,

1142
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,400
with Ben Aspirin and it's a mauling,

1143
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,241
it's,

1144
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:16,810
it's,

1145
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,360
it's just a guy just getting fucked up.

1146
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,250
That's what that fight is.

1147
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,780
Oh God.

1148
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,580
Ben Asked her and just dominated him,

1149
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,500
like absolutely dominated them.

1150
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:26,951
See,

1151
00:28:26,951 --> 00:28:29,260
the dude tried to jump back and landed.

1152
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,860
It landed right as he was in the air out.

1153
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:33,700
She Wauwatosa.

1154
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,741
Yeah.

1155
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:35,110
And No.

1156
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:38,430
And Ben and this guy never
got a punch off of it.

1157
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,170
It was,

1158
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,830
it was a total domination.

1159
00:28:40,831 --> 00:28:41,970
Same as the Lima fight.

1160
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,500
Lima crushes people.

1161
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:44,060
Man.

1162
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,840
Liam is one of the scariest strikers.

1163
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:46,381
I mean,

1164
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:48,140
and he knocked out Korskoff.

1165
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:48,630
I mean,

1166
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,010
Lima smashes people.

1167
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,340
But you see Lima against Ben [inaudible].

1168
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,671
I mean,

1169
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:55,110
obviously it was a younger Lima.

1170
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,000
I mean he's got more experienced now,

1171
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,130
but the difference was so stunning.

1172
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,610
What do you,

1173
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,443
what is this?

1174
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,210
Saskatoon.

1175
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:02,580
Lima.

1176
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:02,731
No,

1177
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:03,180
it's not.

1178
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,013
No,

1179
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:04,501
no.

1180
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:05,460
It was a two Chinese guys,

1181
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:06,294
Bro.

1182
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,840
This is not an Oscar in Lima.

1183
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,693
You gotta trust me.

1184
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,660
This is not asking leamy either.

1185
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,363
Title.

1186
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,120
I'm sure the videos,

1187
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,310
but I'm saying it was Joe being a bully.

1188
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,270
You got to trust me.

1189
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:22,923
And then

1190
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,040
those dudes are not the same guys.

1191
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:26,611
Joe,

1192
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:27,820
you lose your patience.

1193
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,430
There it is.

1194
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,553
There it is.

1195
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,120
Oh yeah man.

1196
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,450
I mean just the way he manhandled him,

1197
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,850
like his wrestling is just,

1198
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,800
you see guys that are used to defending
takedowns and then they find on their

1199
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:43,000
back and you say,

1200
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:44,440
Holy Shit Man.

1201
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,770
I think he did get up kicked
here and his nose got broken.

1202
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:47,970
Yeah,

1203
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:48,850
he got cracked.

1204
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,300
I mean he blamed us a fucking monster man.

1205
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:56,530
And He's a super dangerous striker
and he's huge for the weight class.

1206
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,790
You stand next to Lima,

1207
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:58,451
you like Jesus.

1208
00:29:58,451 --> 00:29:59,710
How do you make one 70?

1209
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:00,910
He's straight.

1210
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:03,550
He doesn't end up in the
Jacuzzi at the hotel.

1211
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:04,960
I've seen him.

1212
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,350
Yeah,

1213
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,591
no,

1214
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:06,210
he's,

1215
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,840
he's struggling to make that weight.

1216
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,793
He's a big guy.

1217
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,491
But anyway,

1218
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:11,200
point being Ben Aspirin,

1219
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:11,710
uh,

1220
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,510
at one 70 super,

1221
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,650
super interesting fight.

1222
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,430
I would like to the person that
the fight that I would like to see,

1223
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,760
I like to see him and uh,

1224
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,590
him and Colby.

1225
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,551
Colby,

1226
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:22,384
Covington,

1227
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:23,781
Ben and cobit.

1228
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:24,011
Yeah.

1229
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:25,120
That would be really interesting.

1230
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:25,810
Yeah,

1231
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,210
I think but isn't Colby
next in line for the title?

1232
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,190
I mean I think he's got the interim belt.

1233
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,360
If he has the interim bell surprise.

1234
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,940
I'm surprised it's still the White House

1235
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:38,763
White House.

1236
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,190
He doesn't have it anymore
and sit in the White House.

1237
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,200
But I mean did they didn't strip him?

1238
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,681
Did they,

1239
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:48,070
cause there was some talk of stripping
him because he was supposed to.

1240
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:48,911
He not that I know of.

1241
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:50,200
I don't think there was ever a strip.

1242
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:50,950
So I think there,

1243
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,830
I think I tried to market.

1244
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,890
So I think as soon as you get the champ,

1245
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,120
Wikipedia here says he was the interim
from June 9th to September 8th.

1246
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:58,271
Oh.

1247
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:59,510
So they did strip them also.

1248
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:03,880
They did show the stripping was because
they wanted him to fight on the Darren

1249
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:04,714
till card.

1250
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,260
When Darren till fought Tyron,

1251
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,220
they wanted him to fight Tyron and
apparently he had gone through,

1252
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:12,431
you know,

1253
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:13,270
hard training camp.

1254
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,200
He was all busted up.

1255
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:15,400
He needed time to recover.

1256
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,850
So I guess they stripped him that old man.

1257
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,620
Interim titles,

1258
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,170
interim titles are like
attached with Velcro.

1259
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,250
They just disappear.

1260
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,660
They get yanked off you.

1261
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,210
They're not,

1262
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,043
they're not really,

1263
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,040
they're not really like,

1264
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,770
especially at UCT 29.

1265
00:31:31,771 --> 00:31:32,980
I mean they all had belts,

1266
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:35,860
stuff Tony Ferguson had
about Connor had about,

1267
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:36,250
you know,

1268
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,860
obviously it could be that his bells,

1269
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,020
we had three people walking around.

1270
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,370
I was at the Tony Ferguson one to me is a,

1271
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:43,390
is a shame.

1272
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:47,440
It's a shame that a guy gets injured
and then they strip him like that.

1273
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,880
That doesn't make any sense to me.

1274
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,930
I didn't like that one.

1275
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,190
That one bothered me.

1276
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,091
Uh,

1277
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:54,220
I feel like Tony should
still have the interim title.

1278
00:31:54,221 --> 00:31:55,070
I really do it.

1279
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,320
But that was like the third time.

1280
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:57,860
Then fine half had fine.

1281
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,930
I know it sucks,

1282
00:31:58,931 --> 00:32:00,430
but the other one wasn't his fault.

1283
00:32:00,431 --> 00:32:01,390
The other one was Khabib.

1284
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,050
Khabib,

1285
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:02,560
right.

1286
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,420
It could be was supposed
to make the weight and he,

1287
00:32:04,421 --> 00:32:04,690
you know,

1288
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,420
he got to the one medically cold argument

1289
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,830
could be pulled out and how
many times Tony pull out.

1290
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,350
So we pulled out once for
sure because he was injured.

1291
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,240
The last one when the,

1292
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:19,390
his knee blew apart and then Khabib
definitely got yanked off the card one.

1293
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,233
It was called the weight.

1294
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,303
The weight cut.

1295
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,430
Remember the weight cut was so
bad that his kidneys were failing.

1296
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,110
Yeah.

1297
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,060
Either way we've been there.

1298
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,030
Yeah.

1299
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,863
That's the fight.

1300
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,071
No.

1301
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:30,904
Do you,

1302
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,160
do you like fighting at 35?

1303
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:36,130
Cause I know you fought it 35 for a
while when you were struggling to make

1304
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:40,910
flyweight you ha you had some issues
early on in your career when you really

1305
00:32:40,911 --> 00:32:42,170
didn't make the weight very well.

1306
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,431
Yeah.

1307
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:45,860
It was a god I was,

1308
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,400
I was getting older I think in my career.

1309
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:52,490
I think the reason why I started
having a weight problem was because of,

1310
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:52,850
uh,

1311
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,760
I was just getting older and
I was doing some crazy stuff.

1312
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,580
Like I used to code like this
microphone up like I used to.

1313
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,473
I used to,

1314
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,380
I used to to cut a bus 16 pounds,

1315
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,460
like in and a two,

1316
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:05,600
two hour sessions.

1317
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,680
Wow.

1318
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:06,951
Yeah.

1319
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:07,341
As a,

1320
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:07,581
as,

1321
00:33:07,581 --> 00:33:09,890
as a flyaway are supposed to be fly away.

1322
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,030
Why are you doing that?

1323
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,970
Because I felt like it
because I'm a rustler.

1324
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:14,440
I think,

1325
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,110
uh,

1326
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,150
my f my whole philosophy at first when I,

1327
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,350
when I got into MMA,

1328
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,400
um,

1329
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,460
was kinda like I and Russell,

1330
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,180
we would never get the same recovery.

1331
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:24,120
I know it's stupid,

1332
00:33:24,121 --> 00:33:24,980
as stupid as heck,

1333
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:25,790
but we wouldn't,

1334
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,151
we would,

1335
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:28,400
we would never get the
recovery that a fire gets.

1336
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,200
So to,

1337
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,961
to me was like,

1338
00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:30,141
dude,

1339
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:30,974
I can,

1340
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,560
I can stretch this as a,

1341
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,620
as long as I can and,

1342
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:33,841
and,

1343
00:33:33,841 --> 00:33:35,810
and I can suffer the day of wins,

1344
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,670
but I'm gonna recover within 24,

1345
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:38,031
20,

1346
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:39,500
28 hours sometimes,

1347
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,401
you know?

1348
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:40,941
So to me,

1349
00:33:40,941 --> 00:33:43,070
I tell was looking at it at a very,

1350
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,870
just that an odd way.

1351
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,090
And then finally sort
started catching up to me.

1352
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,470
So you just had confidence in your
body's ability to bounce back,

1353
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,070
even though you're putting it through
an extraordinary amount of stress in

1354
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:56,230
losing massive amounts
of weight really quickly.

1355
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:56,430
Yeah.

1356
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,600
You just felt like your
body can handle it.

1357
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,443
You're tough.

1358
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:00,640
You're used to it.

1359
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:01,501
Yeah,

1360
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:01,801
it was,

1361
00:34:01,801 --> 00:34:02,634
it was the whole,

1362
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,181
cause you know,

1363
00:34:03,181 --> 00:34:04,920
in wrestling we would
make weight like every,

1364
00:34:04,921 --> 00:34:05,754
uh,

1365
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,301
every,

1366
00:34:06,301 --> 00:34:06,841
every week,

1367
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:08,860
sometimes even Russell so much that we're,

1368
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:10,590
we're used to kind of like that whole,

1369
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,420
that whole struggle side of things.

1370
00:34:12,421 --> 00:34:12,691
And then,

1371
00:34:12,691 --> 00:34:12,901
okay,

1372
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:13,021
we,

1373
00:34:13,021 --> 00:34:14,250
Russell game would do it again.

1374
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,350
What kind of wake up we were talking
about when you were wrestling,

1375
00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:17,184
how much were you cutting?

1376
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,173
Um,

1377
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,080
um,

1378
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,970
and that was a lot more discipline then,

1379
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,860
but I was probably doing about 12 pounds,

1380
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:24,780
but I had no fat like at that,

1381
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,890
at that time I was eating just as healthy
and as clean as possible because I

1382
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:29,800
would make weight

1383
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,350
every,

1384
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:30,980
every,

1385
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,461
every,

1386
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:31,731
you know,

1387
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:33,030
every three weeks I had to tournament,

1388
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:33,501
you know,

1389
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:37,700
I had George Lockhart on
and he was explaining to me
that a lot of people think

1390
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,680
that when you cut weight that you know,

1391
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,090
like you're cutting out fat.

1392
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,451
He's like,

1393
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:42,410
you're not cutting out fat,

1394
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:43,460
you're cutting out water.

1395
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,450
And it actually helps to,

1396
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:49,100
to have more muscle because
muscles most of your water,

1397
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,650
so you're just draining out your muscles.

1398
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:52,850
Then replenishing them.

1399
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:53,541
You know,

1400
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:54,650
when he was explaining that to me,

1401
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:54,950
I was like,

1402
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:55,071
oh,

1403
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:56,570
I never really thought about it that way.

1404
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:00,980
But like a guy like a Yoel Romero who's
a very muscular can actually cut more

1405
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:01,814
weight.

1406
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,780
Yeah.

1407
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,410
Yeah.

1408
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,020
Now you're a pretty muscular
guy for a flyweight.

1409
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,540
So you were walking around
how many pounds over?

1410
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,291
Oh Man,

1411
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:09,531
I was,

1412
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:11,360
I was probably cutting for like maybe 20,

1413
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:12,194
25.

1414
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,011
Wow.

1415
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:14,930
So you're walking around like one 50,

1416
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,550
I'm getting down to 25.

1417
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,620
Holy Shit.

1418
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:17,921
I just,

1419
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:18,820
I just had lost,

1420
00:35:18,821 --> 00:35:19,181
I just,

1421
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:19,481
you know,

1422
00:35:19,481 --> 00:35:20,800
a lot of the to you,

1423
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:21,634
uh,

1424
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,560
because you fight three times a year.

1425
00:35:23,561 --> 00:35:24,460
Like you're not always,

1426
00:35:24,461 --> 00:35:26,530
you're not always honest
with your diet either.

1427
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,491
You know,

1428
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:29,730
come from coming from Mexican December,

1429
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,251
we liked to,

1430
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:31,084
we love to eat.

1431
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,960
You go to my mom's house and it's,

1432
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,930
it's going to be laid down.

1433
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,950
But when you're in camp,

1434
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:38,640
um,

1435
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,140
how do you organize your nutrition?

1436
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:41,581
I'm disciplined.

1437
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:42,121
I have a,

1438
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:43,260
I have a meal prep company.

1439
00:35:43,261 --> 00:35:44,850
They deliver my food like every three,

1440
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:45,903
every three days.

1441
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:51,000
And as your meal prep based
on your suggestions to them
or your recommendations

1442
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:52,050
and directions to them?

1443
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,501
Yeah,

1444
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:52,800
no,

1445
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,840
a lot of is spaced on kind of,

1446
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,580
well,

1447
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,413
uh,

1448
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,980
my diet's just according to kind
of like my training schedule.

1449
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,300
So my training is very,

1450
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:01,140
very organized.

1451
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:01,890
Like now,

1452
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:02,161
Joe,

1453
00:36:02,161 --> 00:36:02,630
I'm like a,

1454
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,900
a pretty much a mom.

1455
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,520
I'm a,

1456
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,750
I'm a professional now,

1457
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:09,360
I guess you could say like I do things,

1458
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:09,901
you know,

1459
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:10,531
the right way.

1460
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:12,080
I used the whole scientific crowd,

1461
00:36:12,081 --> 00:36:12,861
the nutrition route.

1462
00:36:12,861 --> 00:36:13,694
It's just a,

1463
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,260
uh,

1464
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,940
almost like how Bernard Hopkins
kind of as he got older men,

1465
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:20,070
he kind of changed his whole philosophy,

1466
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:21,480
started using science more.

1467
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,470
So I think everything now in my life when
I get ready for fights is all based on

1468
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,670
a saw based on science.

1469
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,110
How did Bernard changes training?

1470
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,040
Do you know?

1471
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,670
Um,

1472
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:29,910
he's,

1473
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,110
he,

1474
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,740
he just started recovering more.

1475
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,440
I think he started using a
lot of those neural stems.

1476
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:35,274
Um,

1477
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,910
a hyperbaric chambers think
things of that matter.

1478
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,160
Things are that matter and
just more scientific based,

1479
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:42,990
like just this whole
training all like all around.

1480
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,990
And did you incorporate
any of those methods?

1481
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,501
I did.

1482
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:47,281
I did actually.

1483
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:47,790
I ended up,

1484
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,180
uh,

1485
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:48,481
you know,

1486
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:52,380
connecting with this saw connecting
with this company called Neuro for Swan,

1487
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:52,591
you know,

1488
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:53,910
science space company.

1489
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:56,110
And I actually wanted to
bring them meant to kind of,

1490
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,130
to kind of talk about it.

1491
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:57,271
She'll,

1492
00:36:57,271 --> 00:36:59,780
because this right here and I
just changed my whole philosophy.

1493
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,130
We're talking about the whole
week because how the whole,

1494
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:02,630
wait,

1495
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:02,880
wait.

1496
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,440
Cause how I struggled tool to how my
whole training has changed because of,

1497
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,130
because of,

1498
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,300
because of science.

1499
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,490
A science that's very,

1500
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:12,270
uh,

1501
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,140
that uh,

1502
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,520
science that's very,

1503
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:14,661
uh,

1504
00:37:14,661 --> 00:37:15,600
I guess complex.

1505
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:18,540
You could say you got have
like the right people,

1506
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:18,811
man,

1507
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:20,280
like dictating your schedule.

1508
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:23,190
So when you set up a
training camp like this,

1509
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,660
how far in advance do you sit
down and work out all the details?

1510
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,580
It's almost like the,

1511
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,800
the morning that we wake up is
what we know we're going to do.

1512
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:32,931
But how it,

1513
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:35,310
like say if you know you
have a fight in July,

1514
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,910
when would you start preparing for
that and when do you sit down and map

1515
00:37:38,911 --> 00:37:39,660
everything out?

1516
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,480
Well we tried to map things out
maybe about three months in advance.

1517
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,420
Kind of like a preparation
and two leading to the camp.

1518
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,790
And that's kind of like the
phase that we're on now.

1519
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:48,640
Like now we're on,

1520
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,170
you know,

1521
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:49,741
if I fight,

1522
00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:51,540
if it is at that fight in January,

1523
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,310
it's almost like our schedule.

1524
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:53,671
It's like there,

1525
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:54,180
there's,

1526
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:54,600
there's,

1527
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,490
there's a pretest to the big test.

1528
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:01,550
So tomorrow's November 1st so if you were
getting ready for a fight in January,

1529
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,750
you would start ramping
up somewhere around now.

1530
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:04,141
Yeah.

1531
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:04,651
But it would,

1532
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:04,981
it would,

1533
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:06,420
it would it be more of a,

1534
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:06,961
yeah,

1535
00:38:06,961 --> 00:38:07,710
it would.

1536
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,550
I think the first,

1537
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:11,580
the first month leading up to
the next eight weeks would be,

1538
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,800
a lot of it would be a
technical and tactical,

1539
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:17,050
just working on those
particular areas that we're,

1540
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,570
that we believe we're going to be in.

1541
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,190
So you're not doing anything crazy.

1542
00:38:20,191 --> 00:38:21,480
Strength and conditioning wise,

1543
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:22,920
you're not trying to break your body down.

1544
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:23,460
No,

1545
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,810
no it could because it's all,

1546
00:38:24,811 --> 00:38:26,430
it's all a learning phase at that point.

1547
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:26,641
You know,

1548
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:27,750
working the body gate,

1549
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:31,380
preparing the body with a lot of body
motion movements and things of that

1550
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:31,800
matter.

1551
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,100
Kind of just bringing more circulation
to certain parts of my body.

1552
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,520
Then it rather than,

1553
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:36,971
you know,

1554
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:39,110
somebody picking up a kettle
bell and thrown it and,

1555
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:39,610
and,

1556
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,940
and crazy things like that.

1557
00:38:40,941 --> 00:38:41,620
Like I get it.

1558
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,453
It's all,

1559
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,650
it's all sports specific,

1560
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,350
Brian.

1561
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:45,681
Right.

1562
00:38:45,681 --> 00:38:46,640
Range of emotion.

1563
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,040
So how do you organize this?

1564
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,090
Like kind of what,

1565
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,200
what is the team of people that you use
and like who's responsible for what?

1566
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,471
Yeah,

1567
00:38:54,471 --> 00:38:54,661
we'll,

1568
00:38:54,661 --> 00:38:54,771
we'll,

1569
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:55,311
like I said,

1570
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:58,840
I think because you got a whole
crew in the back of the mat,

1571
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,050
the Lipton America's with you,

1572
00:39:00,051 --> 00:39:00,650
but you get,

1573
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,900
you get the rest of the Avengers
are all waiting in the waiting room.

1574
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,700
The effort.

1575
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:05,880
I was gonna say,

1576
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,010
we first found him when,

1577
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:07,160
uh,

1578
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,380
he hurt his hand and he had to rehab it.

1579
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,573
Let me get this off.

1580
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,010
Oh,

1581
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,490
see it's going in layers just go in.

1582
00:39:12,491 --> 00:39:15,070
And so he had heard his hand before

1583
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:15,350
or,

1584
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,183
uh,

1585
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:16,880
um,

1586
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,061
he,

1587
00:39:17,061 --> 00:39:21,320
his first fight with Sergio Pettis and
I was trying to find any way for him to

1588
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,190
still compete and we found
somebody using this machine,

1589
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:29,810
which led us to actually neuro force
one and Kareem and all these guys.

1590
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,410
And we tried to force it
for him to get back in time.

1591
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:38,120
And I have video of him just
screaming in pain trying to get there.

1592
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:42,800
And we thought we stayed off it for a
couple of weeks and then the day of the

1593
00:39:42,801 --> 00:39:46,310
face off he wanted to cut weight and
he said his risk kept slipping out.

1594
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,780
And we had a poem from the five
of you wanted to see the doctor.

1595
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:49,823
Doctor says,

1596
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,743
no way.

1597
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,621
Shouldn't fight.

1598
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:53,030
So what was the injury?

1599
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,330
Uh,

1600
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:54,801
I think it was,

1601
00:39:54,801 --> 00:39:55,634
uh,

1602
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,330
an ended up being something
with sprains ligament.

1603
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:58,921
Yeah.

1604
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:00,960
I think it was a ad spraying like,

1605
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,620
uh,

1606
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,240
one of my ligaments in my hand.

1607
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,860
So there's just,

1608
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,030
there's nothing I could do.

1609
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:06,511
Like I would,

1610
00:40:06,511 --> 00:40:06,930
I would,

1611
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,840
I would open the cap bottle for the,

1612
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,250
for,

1613
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:09,481
you know,

1614
00:40:09,481 --> 00:40:12,270
to kind of have to brush my teeth and uh,

1615
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,130
when it hurt to that point,

1616
00:40:14,131 --> 00:40:14,521
I'm just like,

1617
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:14,680
man,

1618
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:14,761
I,

1619
00:40:14,761 --> 00:40:16,200
I can't do anything.

1620
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:17,451
So then I that,

1621
00:40:17,451 --> 00:40:17,760
you know,

1622
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,530
I ended up,

1623
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,140
they ended up,

1624
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,930
Eric here ended up connecting me with,

1625
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:24,600
with neuro force and found out that they
had like these certain machines that

1626
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:25,710
help you heal faster.

1627
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,180
And what did the machines do?

1628
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,280
Accelerated recovery.

1629
00:40:29,281 --> 00:40:33,540
So it was like neuro stem and they
have about a thousand programs on it.

1630
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:36,210
And they're just forced him to,

1631
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,800
to recover a lot faster.

1632
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:42,750
The best example was UFC fighter Panto
Xia he was on the ultimate fighter 24

1633
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:43,470
with us.

1634
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,940
Our number one seed that we picked,

1635
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,280
Alexander Pintos Tosha.

1636
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:51,240
I saw him blow three ligaments out of
his elbow and he started crying cause he

1637
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,220
had a fight in eight weeks and iron,

1638
00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:54,090
no Scotland.

1639
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,560
And um,

1640
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:57,850
I said,

1641
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,180
no,

1642
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,300
no,

1643
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,190
don't go home tomorrow.

1644
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:00,840
He's supposed to be going
back home to Brazil.

1645
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:01,200
And I said,

1646
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,370
no,

1647
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:01,501
no,

1648
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:01,641
no,

1649
00:41:01,641 --> 00:41:01,771
no,

1650
00:41:01,771 --> 00:41:02,581
let's try this.

1651
00:41:02,581 --> 00:41:03,420
You gotta try it.

1652
00:41:03,421 --> 00:41:04,680
And they did it twice,

1653
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,420
two sessions a day for 10 days.

1654
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,800
And he went back and he,

1655
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:08,903
and he fought,

1656
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,830
he fought that guy and beat him.

1657
00:41:10,831 --> 00:41:14,250
He rear naked choke and they guy Neil
Siri and put that guy in retirement.

1658
00:41:14,251 --> 00:41:16,440
So after that I was like,

1659
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,400
would it,

1660
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,300
we need these guys,

1661
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:19,134
Henry,

1662
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,300
whatever these guys did depend Tosha,

1663
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,460
whatever that we need to do for you

1664
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:24,720
got started.

1665
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,750
When a guy gets injured like that
and you're still going through camp,

1666
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,170
how do you work around that injury?

1667
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:29,521
You just say,

1668
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:29,830
okay,

1669
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:30,090
news,

1670
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,440
nothing squeezing,

1671
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:31,921
nothing.

1672
00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:34,070
Where are you putting any
strain in those tendons?

1673
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,641
Nothing.

1674
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:37,460
Or you're doing anything with that
hand that's going to reinjure it.

1675
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:40,400
I think you just have to hope
for somebody or rapid very well,

1676
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:41,823
like you're screwed.

1677
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,230
Yeah.

1678
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,510
I'm having like a hand injuries,

1679
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,060
like the,

1680
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,530
probably the worst injury you could have.

1681
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:45,950
I mean,

1682
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:46,230
we,

1683
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,360
we eat with these hands,

1684
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:48,194
you know,

1685
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:49,183
this is our,

1686
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,900
this is how we survive,

1687
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:51,843
you know?

1688
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,280
And when you have an ng like that,

1689
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:55,880
there's going to be
fighting with the other.

1690
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,870
Do you remember when you arrive?

1691
00:41:57,871 --> 00:42:02,840
Faber fought Mike Brown and broke both
hands and just start throwing elbows and

1692
00:42:02,841 --> 00:42:03,674
slapping though.

1693
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,200
It just didn't give in for a second.

1694
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:06,581
Yeah.

1695
00:42:06,581 --> 00:42:07,161
It's all tough.

1696
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:09,170
That motherfucker is two broken hands.

1697
00:42:09,171 --> 00:42:10,280
Trying to find a way to win.

1698
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:10,521
Yeah.

1699
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:11,390
It's measurable.

1700
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,420
That's a,

1701
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:12,920
yeah,

1702
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,030
it was a title fight too.

1703
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,600
Yup.

1704
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,330
Yup.

1705
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,980
You do amazing things for tidal flat.

1706
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:18,261
No,

1707
00:42:18,261 --> 00:42:18,591
but I,

1708
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:19,190
I want,

1709
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,930
I want it to bring in Joe,

1710
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,771
if you allow me,

1711
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:23,660
I'm a cook because I'm honored man.

1712
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,141
And I think,

1713
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:24,974
uh,

1714
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,550
I think,

1715
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:26,180
uh,

1716
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,640
I brought the men jokes.

1717
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,940
I want to kind of share,

1718
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,330
uh,

1719
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:29,541
you know,

1720
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,040
kind of like the new age stuff,

1721
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:32,750
like something that's
just taken over the top.

1722
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:33,990
So cat,

1723
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:34,340
Kat,

1724
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:34,840
Kevin,

1725
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,481
if you can hear me,

1726
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:35,961
come on.

1727
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:36,380
Can't,

1728
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,730
there's a bit long delay.

1729
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,930
There's like a 32nd delay.

1730
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,793
You can go grab him.

1731
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,240
Okay,

1732
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,073
I'll grab him.

1733
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:41,631
Yeah,

1734
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:42,620
go grab him captain.

1735
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,510
He's going to come back with a new layer.

1736
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,210
So to come back with a cape.

1737
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,500
He's going to come back naked.

1738
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,810
We don't have another microphone though,

1739
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:51,411
unfortunately.

1740
00:42:51,411 --> 00:42:54,170
So he's going to have to take your spot
because there's not another microphone.

1741
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,150
Do you think of Captain America?

1742
00:42:56,151 --> 00:42:56,510
Man,

1743
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,530
we use a fourth microphone.

1744
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:59,990
We actually have to set it
up and it's not up right now.

1745
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,700
And so what do you think
of Captain America?

1746
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,450
He's hilarious at that.

1747
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,400
That we got to them.

1748
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,173
Oh,

1749
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,490
you know how you are with uh,

1750
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,750
um,

1751
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,261
with addy.

1752
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:13,150
That's Kinda how,

1753
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,140
how he a high with them,

1754
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:15,830
you know,

1755
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:16,110
that's it.

1756
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:16,501
It's that,

1757
00:43:16,501 --> 00:43:16,900
is that,

1758
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,141
no,

1759
00:43:17,141 --> 00:43:18,400
it's that certain relationship.

1760
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:18,930
Yep.

1761
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:19,590
Yep.

1762
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:20,051
Hey man,

1763
00:43:20,051 --> 00:43:20,680
that helps.

1764
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,370
How are you sir?

1765
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:21,551
Well,

1766
00:43:21,551 --> 00:43:21,851
good.

1767
00:43:21,851 --> 00:43:22,371
How you doing Joe?

1768
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:22,661
Shop.

1769
00:43:22,661 --> 00:43:23,500
Tell everybody who you are.

1770
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:23,850
I mean,

1771
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:24,551
I'm Kevin Long.

1772
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:24,851
Gloria.

1773
00:43:24,851 --> 00:43:28,540
I am the chief science officer for
Neuro Force One and then I'm a neuro

1774
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:29,650
physiologist as well.

1775
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,810
So keep this about like
a fist from your face.

1776
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,170
Okay.

1777
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:33,130
So um,

1778
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:38,190
tell us what your role was
in camp and what you did to,

1779
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,460
to help him get ready.

1780
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:39,820
Cool.

1781
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,061
Yeah,

1782
00:43:40,061 --> 00:43:44,110
so a neuro force one is a neuroscience
based training company and a medical

1783
00:43:44,111 --> 00:43:46,150
grade diagnostic testing company as well.

1784
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,680
Where are you guys were at a Scottsdale,

1785
00:43:47,681 --> 00:43:48,250
Arizona.

1786
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,780
So what we really focus on,

1787
00:43:49,781 --> 00:43:52,510
which a lot of companies aren't talking
about is the role of the gut and the

1788
00:43:52,511 --> 00:43:54,640
mind in conjunction with
your physical training.

1789
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,970
So essentially what we do is we start
off with a really comprehensive baseline

1790
00:43:57,971 --> 00:43:58,750
assessment.

1791
00:43:58,750 --> 00:43:59,980
We want to run them through everything.

1792
00:43:59,981 --> 00:44:03,180
So the traditional
functional threshold powers,

1793
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,630
autonomic nervous system,

1794
00:44:04,631 --> 00:44:05,860
DC brain potentials.

1795
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,750
And really what you want to do
is you want to put somebody on a,

1796
00:44:07,751 --> 00:44:08,740
on a normal curve,

1797
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:12,520
what does a DC brain potential DC brain
potentials that you want to be like

1798
00:44:12,521 --> 00:44:13,200
Daniel Cormier,

1799
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,120
Yay we DC bring,

1800
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,040
I want to be a little bit like DC but uh,

1801
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:18,380
basically it's uh,

1802
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,500
an objective measurement of
your central nervous system.

1803
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:21,131
So you can actually,

1804
00:44:21,131 --> 00:44:24,280
your central nervous system is basically
the data aggregator if you will.

1805
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:27,340
So it has to take information
from your metabolic systems,

1806
00:44:27,341 --> 00:44:31,710
your autonomics kind of coordinate things
like neuromuscular and I met metabolic

1807
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:32,544
efficiency.

1808
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:33,091
That's kind of the,

1809
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:34,380
the data center if you will.

1810
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,860
So this is a measurement of a potential
basically how much energy you have in

1811
00:44:37,861 --> 00:44:37,951
the,

1812
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:41,370
in the central nervous system to go
coordinate neuro muscular and metabolic

1813
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:42,204
efficiencies,

1814
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,560
which is really what we focus on.

1815
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:48,220
So as soon as this on like a chart or
are you getting like is there a number of

1816
00:44:48,221 --> 00:44:49,190
reading that you're getting?

1817
00:44:49,191 --> 00:44:50,024
Like what is it that

1818
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,810
correct specifically for dcs,

1819
00:44:51,811 --> 00:44:54,600
it's going to be in millivolts and
then you just compare that to normative

1820
00:44:54,601 --> 00:44:55,021
ranges.

1821
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:56,040
But most importantly,

1822
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:56,431
what it is,

1823
00:44:56,431 --> 00:44:57,780
is trending data over time.

1824
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,780
This is an assessment that we would
do on Henry every single morning.

1825
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,040
It's a home test kit.

1826
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:05,310
We really believe in just collecting as
much data as possible and trending data.

1827
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:09,390
That way when you see a change essentially
get predictability in terms of now

1828
00:45:09,391 --> 00:45:13,050
today's a no go day because central
nervous system is diminished.

1829
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:14,310
We're just going to be
going through the motions.

1830
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:16,260
We're not going to make
physiological adaptations.

1831
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:16,750
Uh,

1832
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:18,240
and your inflammation is really high.

1833
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,050
No go because we're not going to go risk
injury when we can't make adaptations.

1834
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:25,050
So this is a measurement we would do
every single morning where we can look at

1835
00:45:25,051 --> 00:45:26,310
autonomic nervous system,

1836
00:45:26,311 --> 00:45:28,050
which is basically things like recovery,

1837
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:28,651
sympathetic,

1838
00:45:28,651 --> 00:45:30,000
parasympathetic balance,

1839
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,820
DC brain potentials and metabolic systems.

1840
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:33,271
What is,

1841
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:34,830
what is measuring all these things?

1842
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,850
Is there a device?

1843
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:36,684
Is it a yeah.

1844
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:36,961
Yeah.

1845
00:45:36,961 --> 00:45:38,160
This is a pretty amazing device.

1846
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:41,010
We actually got it from the
UFC performance institute,

1847
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:41,161
you know,

1848
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:42,090
shout out to those guys,

1849
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:43,620
Clint Bobo and Roman over there.

1850
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:44,250
Um,

1851
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:47,760
set us up with this technology
to basically a chest
strap that does heart rate

1852
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:48,391
variability.

1853
00:45:48,391 --> 00:45:50,820
So time and frequency domain analysis.

1854
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,560
And then it does DC brain potential.

1855
00:45:52,561 --> 00:45:54,450
So they'll stick your right
here on your forehead,

1856
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:55,350
uh,

1857
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,340
basically four minutes.

1858
00:45:56,341 --> 00:45:59,670
You just kind of relax and we collect
pretty amazing data and it breaks it down

1859
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:00,870
into four different categories.

1860
00:46:00,871 --> 00:46:02,430
What's called windows of trainability.

1861
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:06,660
So it says today we should focus on
strength and power or skill acquisition

1862
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:08,220
based on metabolic readiness,

1863
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,770
autonomic readiness in
DC brain potentials.

1864
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:13,230
So what is our body prime to go do today?

1865
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,790
Cause if you're not primed,

1866
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:17,430
your nervous system doesn't have the
energy just going to be going through the

1867
00:46:17,431 --> 00:46:18,264
motions.

1868
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,800
So you were sort of there to dictate
when it's going to be a hard day,

1869
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:23,240
when it's going to be an easy day.

1870
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:23,831
Correct.

1871
00:46:23,831 --> 00:46:24,041
Yeah.

1872
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:25,120
And that's something as you,

1873
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:26,740
I'm sure you guys know in wrestling it's,

1874
00:46:26,741 --> 00:46:28,090
it's always hard always.

1875
00:46:28,091 --> 00:46:28,900
Let's go.

1876
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:29,051
Um,

1877
00:46:29,051 --> 00:46:29,601
so this was a,

1878
00:46:29,601 --> 00:46:31,660
a little bit of an issue in
the camp at the very beginning.

1879
00:46:31,661 --> 00:46:33,580
If you could imagine Henry wakes up,

1880
00:46:33,581 --> 00:46:36,250
it's a sparring day or maybe
even supposed to do two a days.

1881
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,760
He wakes up feeling really good
and nervous system is out of whack.

1882
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,331
It's like,

1883
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:40,841
sorry man,

1884
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:42,730
I know you feel good but you're not,

1885
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:43,653
you know?

1886
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:44,260
Yeah.

1887
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,360
So we would go or no go that day.

1888
00:46:46,361 --> 00:46:47,320
And you know,

1889
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:48,250
as you could see,

1890
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:49,630
it all worked out in the long run.

1891
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:50,881
Oh fantastic.

1892
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:54,750
What was that weird for you to feel good
and then do we told you got to chill

1893
00:46:54,751 --> 00:46:55,230
out.

1894
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:55,561
Yeah.

1895
00:46:55,561 --> 00:46:56,010
Yeah.

1896
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:56,940
And it was a,

1897
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,460
it almost takes a while to kind of adapt.

1898
00:46:59,461 --> 00:47:03,390
But I started as I started recognizing
like my body change in how I felt

1899
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:05,550
inspiring or how they
were and how Kinda I,

1900
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:06,810
I just felt recovered.

1901
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:07,171
I was like,

1902
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:07,471
God,

1903
00:47:07,471 --> 00:47:08,304
this is,

1904
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,570
this is crazy.

1905
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,680
Like I didn't run at all this whole camp.

1906
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,160
So do you get a baseline off of this,

1907
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:14,461
Eric?

1908
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:15,420
You got to stop moving around.

1909
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,373
You're freaking me out.

1910
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,340
I was doing the hand signals back there,

1911
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,070
translating for the deaf people.

1912
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:25,670
So what do you do a baseline on this
before you get started and then you as

1913
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:29,710
before camp gets started and
then when camp starts ramping up,

1914
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:30,100
then

1915
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,840
you start measuring all
the various details,

1916
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:32,321
correct?

1917
00:47:32,321 --> 00:47:32,521
Yeah,

1918
00:47:32,521 --> 00:47:34,660
so we do a comprehensive
baseline assessment,

1919
00:47:34,661 --> 00:47:36,250
including the Omegawave as well as,

1920
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:36,521
you know,

1921
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:38,170
six or eight hours of other testing,

1922
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:40,030
everything that you could
think of under the sun.

1923
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,990
And we put together a basically columns
of this is what your sub optimal at,

1924
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,040
this is what your average at,

1925
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:46,270
this is what you're really damn good at.

1926
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,270
So basically what we want to do is
explore your functional strengths.

1927
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:50,110
It's what you're good at.

1928
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:53,290
But then we also want to focus
on your functional deficiencies.

1929
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,610
In a sport like MMA,

1930
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:57,730
we also sometimes have the advantage
of looking at your opponent and making

1931
00:47:57,731 --> 00:47:59,710
certain assumptions in
terms of their weaknesses,

1932
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,990
their strengths going
against somebody like Dj,

1933
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:02,231
you don't,

1934
00:48:02,231 --> 00:48:03,580
you don't really have that advantage.

1935
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,370
So we really needed to focus on
is what Henry is really good at.

1936
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:07,240
His ground game.

1937
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:07,781
You look,

1938
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:07,931
you know,

1939
00:48:07,931 --> 00:48:10,630
we're doing nervous system
assessments while he's on the ground.

1940
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,960
His sparring partners or stresses
sins are going like crazy.

1941
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:17,230
He's calming down cause this guy likes
to be on the floor rolling around.

1942
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,690
So we pinpoint these
little strategic dif dif,

1943
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:23,200
a strengths and deficiencies and
then we target all of us a nutrition

1944
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:24,250
supplementation.

1945
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,860
A big thing that we focus
on is nutrient timing.

1946
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:30,280
Something that's not really talked about
as well when you're talking about gut

1947
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:31,091
health and you know,

1948
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:31,781
recovery,

1949
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:34,360
managing the hormones
associated with exercise,

1950
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,670
you gotta be getting in the
right nutrients in your,

1951
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:37,600
your energy,

1952
00:48:37,601 --> 00:48:39,190
Anabolic and growth phases.

1953
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:40,780
So for nutrient timing,

1954
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:43,360
you talking about like when you're
actually eating and what you're eating.

1955
00:48:43,361 --> 00:48:44,860
So you're planning that out as well.

1956
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,910
100% yes.

1957
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:50,020
So we put together a nutrition program
and because training varies every morning

1958
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:51,700
we're deciding what we're
going to do for the day.

1959
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,260
It's completely dynamic.

1960
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:53,501
It's,

1961
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:57,070
we're kind of reinventing the game of
periodization and programming because you

1962
00:48:57,071 --> 00:48:58,840
can't give somebody an eight week plan.

1963
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,280
You have to check every single day.

1964
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:04,360
This is how you stay very dynamic and
you avoid plateaus and just the issues,

1965
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:04,720
you know,

1966
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,660
it's always going to lead to suboptimal
performance if you're programming out.

1967
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,310
So every day we adjust,

1968
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:09,461
you know,

1969
00:49:09,461 --> 00:49:11,230
we're doing this intensity of training.

1970
00:49:11,231 --> 00:49:14,710
We did a vo two Max assessment so we
know exactly how much glycogen you're

1971
00:49:14,711 --> 00:49:17,080
burning at various levels of intensity.

1972
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,390
We do heart rate tracking
during your training.

1973
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:19,721
All right,

1974
00:49:19,721 --> 00:49:21,730
this is exactly what you
have to replace following.

1975
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,320
So I'm standing on the sidelines,

1976
00:49:23,321 --> 00:49:23,531
you know,

1977
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:26,890
after every practice mixing up
custom supplements for him as well.

1978
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:27,940
So this is something,

1979
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:28,774
what kind of stuff?

1980
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,260
Um,

1981
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:29,471
you know,

1982
00:49:29,471 --> 00:49:31,120
we have our own supplement line right now.

1983
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:33,850
I'm frankly not because the world
needed another supplement line.

1984
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,350
It's not really what our goal was.

1985
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:35,771
Um,

1986
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:35,971
in,

1987
00:49:35,971 --> 00:49:36,761
in sports like this,

1988
00:49:36,761 --> 00:49:38,920
you have to be so careful what
you're putting in these guys body.

1989
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:39,311
Uh,

1990
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:42,070
so we just went the route of
going GMP certified water.

1991
00:49:42,071 --> 00:49:44,050
You sought approved on everything we do.

1992
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:44,710
Um,

1993
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:45,431
eventually we want to,

1994
00:49:45,431 --> 00:49:45,600
you know,

1995
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,230
try and work with the bad
ass company cause we're not,

1996
00:49:47,231 --> 00:49:48,520
we don't want to be in
the supplement game.

1997
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,380
For us it was just quality control.

1998
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:50,921
Um,

1999
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:51,340
so,

2000
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:51,550
uh,

2001
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,440
being a nervous system based company,

2002
00:49:53,441 --> 00:49:57,400
obviously we're doing things
like Omega three Dhas Bcas,

2003
00:49:57,401 --> 00:49:57,740
you know,

2004
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,391
to maintain,

2005
00:49:58,391 --> 00:49:59,650
put on a little bit of muscle.

2006
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:00,191
Um,

2007
00:50:00,191 --> 00:50:03,460
we do a lot of big one I believe
in this is the generation you can,

2008
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:07,420
the SuperStarch very good without a big
glycaemic in a big insulin response,

2009
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,930
but very good at replenishing your
glycogen stores following to minimize

2010
00:50:10,931 --> 00:50:13,810
cortisol and inflammatory
responses and things like that.

2011
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:14,290
So,

2012
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:14,561
um,

2013
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:15,910
everyday it's a little bit different.

2014
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:16,240
But uh,

2015
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:16,451
yeah,

2016
00:50:16,451 --> 00:50:19,560
we ended up going with our own line and
one of the biggest things that we didn't

2017
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:21,260
ever really talk about in
the fight as well is the,

2018
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,780
the role that gut health place.

2019
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:26,020
So that's something Henry does year round
regardless of when we're fighting is

2020
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:26,771
take our line,

2021
00:50:26,771 --> 00:50:28,430
which is called freedom cleansers store.

2022
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:29,780
And this is world renown,

2023
00:50:29,781 --> 00:50:30,100
um,

2024
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,500
you know,

2025
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,950
utilize by university researchers
all around the world right now.

2026
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,070
And basically it's all just about
restoring good gut bacteria,

2027
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:37,821
prebiotics,

2028
00:50:37,821 --> 00:50:39,590
probiotics and lymphatic cleansing.

2029
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,390
And this is going to be something,

2030
00:50:41,391 --> 00:50:41,720
um,

2031
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,910
that really played a big role
in his weight cut as well.

2032
00:50:43,911 --> 00:50:46,370
It's kind of a missing link that
athletes aren't talking about,

2033
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,310
but good gut health is going to
help with serotonin production.

2034
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:50,061
So recovery,

2035
00:50:50,061 --> 00:50:51,050
relaxation,

2036
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:51,890
mood,

2037
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:52,131
you know,

2038
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:54,370
production of brain derived
neurotrophic factor.

2039
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:58,370
So our nervous system can
make these adaptations and
learn new skills and things

2040
00:50:58,371 --> 00:50:59,204
along these lines.

2041
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:00,290
So this is something,

2042
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:00,650
you know,

2043
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:01,430
in my opinion,

2044
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,540
a big reason why,

2045
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,050
uh,

2046
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:03,540
you know,

2047
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,480
he had the issue with Dj
the first time around.

2048
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,590
Henry Henry will tell the story like he
had gut inflammation so bad that people

2049
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:11,150
would say good luck before the fight.

2050
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,070
Tap His gut and,

2051
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,013
and that hurt him.

2052
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:13,341
You know,

2053
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:14,210
that's not normal.

2054
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:17,690
That all goes back to the issues
associated with weight cutting as we were

2055
00:51:17,691 --> 00:51:18,770
talking about a little bit.

2056
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:19,351
But uh,

2057
00:51:19,351 --> 00:51:20,630
getting that gut health right,

2058
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:21,720
no inflammation in the,

2059
00:51:21,721 --> 00:51:22,700
and that goes a long way.

2060
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,420
Now,

2061
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,400
how long have you guys
been in business for a,

2062
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:27,320
we've only been in business
for about eight months.

2063
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:28,460
We're still very new.

2064
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,070
Um,

2065
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:30,080
been working with Henry A.

2066
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,950
Little bit longer than that.

2067
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,460
Um,

2068
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,060
but yeah,

2069
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,500
this company is just
getting off the ground.

2070
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:33,581
We,

2071
00:51:33,581 --> 00:51:35,300
we kind of rebranded a few months ago,

2072
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:37,910
just opened our first facility
as well out in Scottsdale.

2073
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:38,990
What is your background in?

2074
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:39,741
Um,

2075
00:51:39,741 --> 00:51:40,191
I'm a,

2076
00:51:40,191 --> 00:51:41,300
I'm a physiologist.

2077
00:51:41,301 --> 00:51:41,441
I,

2078
00:51:41,441 --> 00:51:45,080
we opened the first mobile medical grade
diagnostic testing company in Arizona.

2079
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:48,350
So basically I would have these
diagnostics and largely it was trying to,

2080
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:50,540
trying to fix the healthcare
system a little bit,

2081
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:51,070
you know,

2082
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:51,260
uh,

2083
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:51,431
we,

2084
00:51:51,431 --> 00:51:53,030
we want individualized solutions.

2085
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:54,680
We want datadriven outcomes,

2086
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:54,891
right?

2087
00:51:54,891 --> 00:51:56,660
You want quantifiable progress.

2088
00:51:56,661 --> 00:51:58,580
So people want to feel good
about what they're doing,

2089
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:03,080
but maybe a doctor can't afford a this
big ass metabolic cart or they don't know

2090
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:03,800
how to use it.

2091
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,750
So what I did is I
purchased this equipment,

2092
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,770
hire technicians,

2093
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:09,530
and we would bring it mobile
technology's getting smaller,

2094
00:52:09,531 --> 00:52:10,364
more mobile.

2095
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:11,570
So this was my idea of,

2096
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:14,300
of how I would go make my little
dent in the healthcare system.

2097
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:14,901
Um,

2098
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:15,081
you know,

2099
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:17,840
there were issues with scalability
in terms of finding good technicians,

2100
00:52:17,841 --> 00:52:20,930
but the goal is just to go out there
and provide data driven solutions,

2101
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:21,420
right?

2102
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,430
We live in a world of,

2103
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:23,540
of subjectivity,

2104
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:24,374
guesswork,

2105
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:29,060
a very punishment oriented fitness system
where it sucks the start working out

2106
00:52:29,061 --> 00:52:29,380
you,

2107
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,940
you typically gain weight if you're doing
the right stuff cause you're getting

2108
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:32,774
hydrated,

2109
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:33,740
you go get injured.

2110
00:52:33,741 --> 00:52:34,130
You know,

2111
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:37,700
the goal is to redefine how we assess
people so that we can find these little,

2112
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:40,010
little tweaks for positive reinforcement.

2113
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:40,711
And that's a,

2114
00:52:40,711 --> 00:52:42,800
it goes a long way with
healthcare as well as fitness.

2115
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:45,500
So you guys mostly working with civilians,

2116
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:47,270
are you working with pro athletes?

2117
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:47,780
Oh,

2118
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,450
right now we're in the research and
development phase so we're really only

2119
00:52:50,451 --> 00:52:52,100
working with guys like a Henry,

2120
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:52,581
Victoria,

2121
00:52:52,581 --> 00:52:52,941
Anthony.

2122
00:52:52,941 --> 00:52:55,520
I've a very bad ass dresser we're
working with right now as well.

2123
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:56,030
Um,

2124
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:57,200
just some amazing people.

2125
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:57,560
Uh,

2126
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,120
largely for research and development.

2127
00:52:59,121 --> 00:52:59,420
We,

2128
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,160
we trade them the training for the data.

2129
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:01,401
You know,

2130
00:53:01,401 --> 00:53:02,960
you guys get together.

2131
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:03,531
Uh,

2132
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:05,000
we've been working with
Henry about a year.

2133
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:05,360
He,

2134
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:05,780
I knew,

2135
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,860
he knew our CEO,

2136
00:53:06,861 --> 00:53:08,570
Karima mean a great guy.

2137
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:10,850
We've kind of all circle around a Korean.

2138
00:53:10,851 --> 00:53:11,930
He brought us all together.

2139
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:12,680
Um,

2140
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:13,220
but uh,

2141
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:13,550
you know,

2142
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:16,940
he came in probably about eight months
ago for a little bit before the first

2143
00:53:16,941 --> 00:53:19,150
camp and we met talked and no,

2144
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:19,821
Henry was straight up.

2145
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:20,091
He's like,

2146
00:53:20,091 --> 00:53:20,680
man you,

2147
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,640
you know your stuff
but you don't know MMA.

2148
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:23,750
So I took that,

2149
00:53:23,751 --> 00:53:23,931
you know,

2150
00:53:23,931 --> 00:53:24,561
personally we,

2151
00:53:24,561 --> 00:53:24,831
you know,

2152
00:53:24,831 --> 00:53:26,070
spent a lot of time together.

2153
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:27,150
I had to learn the sport.

2154
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,081
I'm a physiologist,

2155
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:29,490
not an MMA physiologist.

2156
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,830
So we really took the time
to get to know each other,

2157
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:32,430
you know,

2158
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,091
hang out a lot.

2159
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:36,420
Now I got to go to his house and wake
them up every day for eight weeks.

2160
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,100
So that was,

2161
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,460
you got to know each other pretty well.

2162
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,350
I do as meals trips and stuff much.

2163
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:41,580
Yeah,

2164
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,540
that's a fantastic

2165
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:43,610
stick combination though.

2166
00:53:43,611 --> 00:53:48,611
A guy like you who knows so much about
the body and recovery and a real super

2167
00:53:48,801 --> 00:53:51,460
high level Olympic gold medalist athlete.

2168
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:51,711
I mean,

2169
00:53:51,711 --> 00:53:53,660
when you get that
combination mean that is,

2170
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:57,740
that's really a dream for God to
like you and for a guy like you,

2171
00:53:57,950 --> 00:54:00,680
like for both of you guys
to come together like this.

2172
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,780
And I understand why you
wanted to bring him on.

2173
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,793
Well,

2174
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:04,520
yeah,

2175
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:04,881
I mean,

2176
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:05,310
uh,

2177
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:05,720
you know,

2178
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,020
I understand half of,

2179
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:08,620
if you understand half of it.

2180
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,120
Yeah,

2181
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:10,790
yeah.

2182
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,110
The DC mine thing,

2183
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,030
that Shit's important.

2184
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,051
But no,

2185
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:15,410
I mean,

2186
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:18,950
I do feel honored and blessed to be
able to work with somebody like Henry.

2187
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,630
He's the hardest working guy out there.

2188
00:54:20,631 --> 00:54:21,170
And,

2189
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:23,390
and of course the hard
work goes a long ways,

2190
00:54:23,391 --> 00:54:23,781
but man,

2191
00:54:23,781 --> 00:54:25,220
this guy's a genetic freak as well.

2192
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:27,980
I found the ability to
test the Olympic athletes,

2193
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,110
many other sports as well.

2194
00:54:30,111 --> 00:54:32,510
This guy makes adaptations
faster than anybody.

2195
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,553
He came off of,

2196
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:33,860
you know,

2197
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,693
12 weeks,

2198
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,690
16 weeks maybe of not training vo
two two's already in the high sixties

2199
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:41,750
functional threshold power is
that would go compete with the,

2200
00:54:41,751 --> 00:54:41,990
you know,

2201
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:44,570
worldclass ironmen that I'm
training and things as well.

2202
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:45,171
And then,

2203
00:54:45,171 --> 00:54:45,620
I mean,

2204
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:45,870
we,

2205
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,060
we did some amazing stuff.

2206
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:50,600
If you looked at the body composition
changes that we did in seven weeks,

2207
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:52,100
it wasn't even a full eight week camp.

2208
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:52,640
Um,

2209
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:55,520
he put on 4.2 pounds of
skeletal muscle mass,

2210
00:54:55,521 --> 00:54:56,271
like good mass,

2211
00:54:56,271 --> 00:54:59,450
which as a physiologist I would call
bullshit on if I didn't see it with my own

2212
00:54:59,451 --> 00:55:00,050
two eyes.

2213
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:00,890
That's pretty incredible.

2214
00:55:00,891 --> 00:55:01,131
Yeah.

2215
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:01,690
Incredible.

2216
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:02,870
And Henry will tell you,

2217
00:55:02,871 --> 00:55:05,060
he may be picked up weights
like three or four times.

2218
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:08,690
We don't really do traditional
strength training because you know,

2219
00:55:08,691 --> 00:55:09,500
a lot of people just,

2220
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,240
it's called vector based training.

2221
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,700
So a lot of people do things
like squats and dead lifts.

2222
00:55:13,701 --> 00:55:14,990
This is an axial plane,

2223
00:55:14,991 --> 00:55:16,940
like we don't live in
this up and down plain.

2224
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,590
So we break it down by vector,

2225
00:55:18,591 --> 00:55:19,281
what angles,

2226
00:55:19,281 --> 00:55:23,060
what does he need to exert and absorb
force and very effectively and very really

2227
00:55:23,061 --> 00:55:25,220
does that come down to
actually utilizing weights.

2228
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:29,330
We do things like positional isom metrics
and east centric training and things

2229
00:55:29,331 --> 00:55:30,164
along these lines.

2230
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:30,921
Number one,

2231
00:55:30,921 --> 00:55:32,990
they integrate with the nervous
system very effectively.

2232
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:34,110
Symmetrics yeah,

2233
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:37,220
positional isometric like planks.

2234
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:38,181
I mean that's,

2235
00:55:38,181 --> 00:55:39,380
that's kind of a low level of it.

2236
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:39,561
Yeah.

2237
00:55:39,561 --> 00:55:42,260
Largely what you would want to do
is like a biomechanical assessment,

2238
00:55:42,261 --> 00:55:44,360
look at overactive and
underactive muscles,

2239
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,480
and then you put them in very specific
positions and you leverage what's called

2240
00:55:47,481 --> 00:55:49,340
recip reciprocal inhibition.

2241
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:50,421
So basically,

2242
00:55:50,421 --> 00:55:51,740
and then the most basic term,

2243
00:55:51,741 --> 00:55:53,120
like when I'm flexing my Bicep,

2244
00:55:53,121 --> 00:55:54,560
my tricep is relaxing.

2245
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:57,830
So you'd hold certain positions that
you want to turn on certain muscles and

2246
00:55:57,831 --> 00:55:59,090
kind of turn off other ones.

2247
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,940
It's kind of a high level
of of PNF stretching,

2248
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,550
proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation.

2249
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,950
So this is what would be
done in like a PT office.

2250
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:10,460
So w in like for wrestling,

2251
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:14,900
like what kind of exercises would you
do that would incorporate those methods?

2252
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:16,260
I mean wrestling is you know,

2253
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,740
largely a torsional sports.

2254
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:19,690
So when it comes to
wrestling we do things like,

2255
00:56:19,691 --> 00:56:20,261
like Kaiser,

2256
00:56:20,261 --> 00:56:22,360
like pneumatic compressions
and things like that.

2257
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,640
So instead of weights we use air pressure.

2258
00:56:24,641 --> 00:56:25,091
Basically.

2259
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:25,930
It's very smooth,

2260
00:56:25,931 --> 00:56:27,160
very low risk of injury.

2261
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,390
And they live in this arm,

2262
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:29,490
this torsional plane.

2263
00:56:29,491 --> 00:56:33,460
So you do a lot of transverse plane and
we do a lot of velocity based training

2264
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:34,150
as well.

2265
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:35,080
Actually really interesting.

2266
00:56:35,081 --> 00:56:36,700
A study that was published recently.

2267
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:37,010
A,

2268
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:39,100
they had a lot of guys
working on it for a full year.

2269
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:40,530
Some only did velocity,

2270
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:41,890
never actually picked up a weight.

2271
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:43,930
The other ones that
traditional strength training,

2272
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,280
the people who did velocity
based training now,

2273
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:50,290
no actual weight training got stronger
with less muscular hypertrophy.

2274
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:53,290
I mean they didn't get as big but they
were stronger at the end of the day.

2275
00:56:53,530 --> 00:56:56,800
So when you look at something
like wrestling and MMA
where you got to make a low

2276
00:56:56,801 --> 00:56:58,540
weight but you want to
be shown as possible,

2277
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:58,901
you know,

2278
00:56:58,901 --> 00:57:01,090
velocity based training is
kind of the way of the future.

2279
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:05,040
So this is kind of our general gym
concept that we're building right now is,

2280
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:05,411
is you know,

2281
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:07,360
the gym of the future
may not need weights.

2282
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:07,890
You know,

2283
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:10,510
we're going to be next door to these
crossfit gyms where they're throwing all

2284
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:11,470
these weights over their head,

2285
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:15,070
getting injured or next door empty
gym and people are getting stronger.

2286
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:15,371
That's,

2287
00:57:15,371 --> 00:57:16,060
that's kind of the,

2288
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,220
the gym of the future,

2289
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:17,980
the way we see it.

2290
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,530
How would you divine
velocity based training.

2291
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:21,131
Um,

2292
00:57:21,131 --> 00:57:23,920
so basically what you want to do is
it's kind of like the new one rep Max.

2293
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:26,500
We all know one rep Max is aren't
the safest thing to perform,

2294
00:57:26,501 --> 00:57:27,080
right?

2295
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:27,730
So you would,

2296
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:28,090
uh,

2297
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,080
there's different assessments.

2298
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:31,000
Actually what I'm wearing
here on my wrist right now,

2299
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,860
this is the wearable tech of the future.

2300
00:57:32,861 --> 00:57:34,360
This is something we're testing right now.

2301
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,500
This does velocity.

2302
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,000
So I could send in any position,

2303
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:39,220
I could do a push press
or I could do a punch.

2304
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,810
This is going to measure my velocity.

2305
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:45,100
Your Max Velocity at no weight would
be your one rep Max velocity basically.

2306
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,121
And then you're going in,

2307
00:57:46,121 --> 00:57:46,960
you're doing your training.

2308
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:47,920
So Max velocity,

2309
00:57:47,921 --> 00:57:48,850
every single rep,

2310
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:50,860
when you hit 20% dampening,

2311
00:57:50,861 --> 00:57:52,840
so see I was at 10 meters per second.

2312
00:57:52,841 --> 00:57:55,330
As soon as I hit eight meters
or eight meters per second,

2313
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,260
I stop.

2314
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,850
So this is kind of what they call fatigue.

2315
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,020
So you stopped that.

2316
00:57:59,021 --> 00:57:59,980
So instead of doing,

2317
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:00,340
you know,

2318
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,360
you're going to do eight reps,

2319
00:58:01,361 --> 00:58:04,540
you do as many reps as you can until you
reach a certain dampening of velocity.

2320
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,190
And what are you doing them with?

2321
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,530
Largely things like the Kaiser,

2322
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:09,460
the functional trainer,

2323
00:58:09,461 --> 00:58:11,890
if you're familiar with
that blasting band work.

2324
00:58:11,891 --> 00:58:12,101
Yeah.

2325
00:58:12,101 --> 00:58:12,701
Things like that.

2326
00:58:12,701 --> 00:58:14,050
I mean very rarely will throw like,

2327
00:58:14,051 --> 00:58:14,380
you know,

2328
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,540
Indian clubs and things
like that in there as well.

2329
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:19,900
So it all depends on the sport and
what we're focusing on that day.

2330
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,141
You know,

2331
00:58:20,141 --> 00:58:21,130
metabolic readiness,

2332
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:22,150
things along those lines.

2333
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:26,440
But it's all just about training in the
right vectors and being able to not only

2334
00:58:26,441 --> 00:58:28,360
put out force but absorb force as well,

2335
00:58:28,361 --> 00:58:29,680
which nobody really talks about.

2336
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,960
And if you look at largely
other professional sports,

2337
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:34,810
all these injuries are happening
in the deceleration phase.

2338
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:36,430
So when people are trying to slow down,

2339
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:37,720
this is absorbing force.

2340
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,260
This is kind of similar through some of
the pieces that just aren't trained in

2341
00:58:41,261 --> 00:58:44,410
MMA as well has got to be able to
absorb force just like you put it out.

2342
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,920
Now when you met this risk
thing that you're wearing,

2343
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,600
it measures velocity.

2344
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:51,370
So how's it doing that?

2345
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:51,971
Um,

2346
00:58:51,971 --> 00:58:54,970
so basically I have one here and
then I have one on my shoe as well.

2347
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:58,420
So it can do it by using two sensors
that can measure relative velocity.

2348
00:58:58,421 --> 00:59:00,430
So it's reading one relative to the other.

2349
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:04,150
This is also doing everything that a
bad ass traditional wearable would do as

2350
00:59:04,151 --> 00:59:04,361
well.

2351
00:59:04,361 --> 00:59:05,950
So it's doing my heart rate,

2352
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:06,910
heart rate variability,

2353
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:08,260
which is actually clinical grade.

2354
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,750
Everything we do has got to be clinical
grade cause what's the point of

2355
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:12,090
collecting data if it's shit right.

2356
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:12,611
Um,

2357
00:59:12,611 --> 00:59:14,200
and then it does pulse oximetry.

2358
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:16,210
So I'm looking at my oxygen saturation.

2359
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:19,000
The next version is going
to be able to do hydration,

2360
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:20,230
all kinds of bad stuff.

2361
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,380
What's really cool about it as well as
it can measure form any exercise that

2362
00:59:24,381 --> 00:59:24,891
you're doing.

2363
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:27,440
We can compare you
essentially to an ideal form.

2364
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,670
And because we have to,

2365
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:29,601
you don't even have to tell it.

2366
00:59:29,601 --> 00:59:30,500
You're doing a power clean,

2367
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:32,780
it can read your motions
and things like that.

2368
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,450
And it gives you like a
consistency number as well.

2369
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:36,081
So we,

2370
00:59:36,081 --> 00:59:39,800
one thing we really talk about is is not
building muscle on top of dysfunction.

2371
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:43,610
We have to get your biomechanical patterns
right first and then we start putting

2372
00:59:43,611 --> 00:59:44,180
muscle on.

2373
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,860
If you just put muscle
on top of dysfunction,

2374
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,170
you're facili facilitating
further dysfunction.

2375
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,970
Would you have to wear
one of those on each hand?

2376
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:50,571
Um,

2377
00:59:50,571 --> 00:59:51,790
I mean I'd say the fee,

2378
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,600
ideally for someone like a fighter,

2379
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:55,370
you obviously you're
thrown with both hands.

2380
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:55,970
Um,

2381
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:57,230
I think it would be ideal.

2382
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:57,530
Um,

2383
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:57,771
it's,

2384
00:59:57,771 --> 01:00:01,700
it's really difficult at
time sync multiple devices
to be on the same timeline.

2385
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,660
So that's something we're
working with this company,

2386
01:00:03,661 --> 01:00:07,070
an amazing company actually out of here
at to La to develop this thing right

2387
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:07,341
now.

2388
01:00:07,341 --> 01:00:08,990
So that I would say that'd be the goal.

2389
01:00:08,991 --> 01:00:09,091
It's,

2390
01:00:09,091 --> 01:00:12,410
it's not something that's going to be
applicable to the average guy though as

2391
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:12,681
well.

2392
01:00:12,681 --> 01:00:12,930
This,

2393
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:15,020
we're trying to bring this
type of training to everybody.

2394
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,810
Would it be possible
instead of time sinking it,

2395
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:19,940
you have a left and a right computer,

2396
01:00:19,941 --> 01:00:23,120
like two different computers that are
reading data both on one off the left,

2397
01:00:23,121 --> 01:00:23,750
one off the rights.

2398
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:25,100
So you don't have to coordinate them.

2399
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:27,080
You just look at the various data.

2400
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:27,651
I mean,

2401
01:00:27,651 --> 01:00:28,191
at the end of the day,

2402
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:29,570
you still would have to sync them,

2403
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:29,781
you know?

2404
01:00:29,781 --> 01:00:30,950
So the thing there,

2405
01:00:30,951 --> 01:00:32,960
you'd be collecting it in two
different sets of hardware.

2406
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:34,610
You'd want an API connectivity,

2407
01:00:34,611 --> 01:00:35,600
put it up in the cloud,

2408
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:38,510
and then you'd still at the end of the
day have to find the same time axis.

2409
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:39,030
So it,

2410
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:41,120
it sounds simpler than it really would be.

2411
01:00:41,121 --> 01:00:44,330
That's why this is the only wearable in
the world right now that has even one in

2412
01:00:44,331 --> 01:00:45,020
the foot.

2413
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,750
And so this also allows you to track
your gate while you're running and things

2414
01:00:47,751 --> 01:00:48,141
as well.

2415
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:50,350
But the more devices the more complex in,

2416
01:00:50,351 --> 01:00:50,511
in,

2417
01:00:50,511 --> 01:00:50,810
you know,

2418
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:54,530
that's something I think would be great
but maybe not applicable to everybody.

2419
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,600
Is it going to be able to
track martial arts moves?

2420
01:00:56,601 --> 01:01:00,740
Like will it be able to track a double
leg take down or a roundhouse kick or

2421
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:01,340
anything like that?

2422
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,060
Right now you can program
it to do anything.

2423
01:01:03,061 --> 01:01:03,320
Um,

2424
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,360
you put it into a kind of
like a learning mode on the,

2425
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,170
on your app,

2426
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,190
you do a few motions,

2427
01:01:07,191 --> 01:01:07,761
you name it,

2428
01:01:07,761 --> 01:01:08,460
and then it can,

2429
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,940
can basically compare you
to yourself in that mode.

2430
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:15,140
So you can try and do perfect form and
measure your form relative to yourself.

2431
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,730
But if you have shitty form,

2432
01:01:16,731 --> 01:01:18,370
you're comparing yourself to shitty for.

2433
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,021
Exactly.

2434
01:01:19,021 --> 01:01:20,030
So it doesn't know any better.

2435
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:20,661
Exactly.

2436
01:01:20,661 --> 01:01:21,950
So what we're doing right now,

2437
01:01:21,951 --> 01:01:22,110
um,

2438
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:22,281
which,

2439
01:01:22,281 --> 01:01:25,610
which will be a little bit of a lengthy
process is defining a library of perfect

2440
01:01:25,611 --> 01:01:27,920
form for everything
that you could think of.

2441
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:28,461
And then this,

2442
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:28,641
you know,

2443
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:32,090
this is going to a lock telehealth and
tell the training when you have something

2444
01:01:32,091 --> 01:01:32,481
like that.

2445
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:34,290
We can do remote programming and,

2446
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:35,430
and have been,

2447
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:35,600
you know,

2448
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,430
be monitoring people's
neuromuscular function,

2449
01:01:37,431 --> 01:01:39,170
their biomechanics completely remotely.

2450
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:39,501
So that's,

2451
01:01:39,501 --> 01:01:40,760
that's really what we're going towards.

2452
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,091
Wow.

2453
01:01:41,091 --> 01:01:42,410
This is fascinating stuff man.

2454
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:42,950
You know,

2455
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:46,700
there's always been a several aspects
to getting a fighter ready for camp.

2456
01:01:46,701 --> 01:01:48,350
There's always been their skillset,

2457
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,760
what they're good at,

2458
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:50,570
um,

2459
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:54,710
specific training for that one individual
opponent of they're going to face and

2460
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,350
then all the strength and
conditioning and you know,

2461
01:01:57,470 --> 01:01:58,940
it's usually thought of as,

2462
01:01:59,240 --> 01:01:59,571
you know,

2463
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:03,080
weights and sprints and pliers
and on all these different things.

2464
01:02:03,081 --> 01:02:06,110
But I feel like this is
probably the next step.

2465
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,070
The next step,

2466
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:09,050
measuring all of your,

2467
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:13,610
all these variables that you're talking
about and seeing how your body is at any

2468
01:02:13,611 --> 01:02:17,240
given time so that you're not just
guessing whether you're piquing your

2469
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:18,710
scientifically peaking.

2470
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:19,500
Exactly man.

2471
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:19,891
I mean there's,

2472
01:02:19,891 --> 01:02:22,140
there's just no room for
guesswork and subjectivity,

2473
01:02:22,141 --> 01:02:22,351
you know,

2474
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:24,480
at this level and in technology doesn't,

2475
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:25,920
there's no need for it anymore.

2476
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,800
So we're just trying to let people
know shit like this is available,

2477
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:29,101
right?

2478
01:02:29,101 --> 01:02:32,520
So we're developing it and then the end
goal is just to make it extremely user

2479
01:02:32,521 --> 01:02:32,971
friendly,

2480
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:33,450
right?

2481
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,081
So you're doing your,

2482
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:37,650
your velocity based training and it says
stop and then you rest and we're using

2483
01:02:37,651 --> 01:02:40,080
your heart rate variability
to tell you when to go again.

2484
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:40,860
So like,

2485
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:41,130
you know,

2486
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:42,630
it's easy to stop and go for your,

2487
01:02:42,631 --> 01:02:46,650
your periodization and things like that
so that the technology's here now making

2488
01:02:46,651 --> 01:02:46,801
it,

2489
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:47,070
you know,

2490
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:50,560
actionable recommendations for the
individual that can understand is,

2491
01:02:50,561 --> 01:02:51,810
is kind of what we're moving towards.

2492
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,340
This is awesome stuff,

2493
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:53,740
man.

2494
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:54,160
Thank you.

2495
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:54,281
Yeah,

2496
01:02:54,281 --> 01:02:55,610
we're really passionate
about what we're doing.

2497
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,340
You've only been around for
such a short amount of time to,

2498
01:02:58,341 --> 01:02:59,900
and yet you already have a world champion.

2499
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:00,341
Oh,

2500
01:03:00,341 --> 01:03:00,921
I know man.

2501
01:03:00,921 --> 01:03:01,970
I mean I feel,

2502
01:03:01,971 --> 01:03:02,350
you know,

2503
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:05,090
there's times where you feel like you
didn't deserve the opportunity because

2504
01:03:05,091 --> 01:03:05,231
I'm,

2505
01:03:05,231 --> 01:03:06,110
I'm new to the field,

2506
01:03:06,111 --> 01:03:06,321
you know,

2507
01:03:06,321 --> 01:03:08,060
we obviously work our
asses off and everything,

2508
01:03:08,061 --> 01:03:08,820
but the,

2509
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,520
for Henry to put the faith into us,

2510
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:10,940
you know,

2511
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:12,680
this was a world champion camp.

2512
01:03:12,681 --> 01:03:13,550
We're a company.

2513
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:13,881
Honestly,

2514
01:03:13,881 --> 01:03:14,714
we're not even open yet.

2515
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,320
This is probably one of
the best acceleration for
a company that's never seen

2516
01:03:18,321 --> 01:03:19,250
the light of day ever.

2517
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:19,790
Um,

2518
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:20,001
you know,

2519
01:03:20,001 --> 01:03:21,770
we also run a few other sports as well,

2520
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,281
but yeah,

2521
01:03:22,281 --> 01:03:24,470
for him to give us this
opportunity and you know,

2522
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:27,980
we felt like we owed them
something so we worked extra hard,

2523
01:03:27,981 --> 01:03:31,970
essentially put our entire company on
hold for eight weeks to go help him out.

2524
01:03:31,971 --> 01:03:32,510
And you know,

2525
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:33,380
it's paying dividends.

2526
01:03:33,381 --> 01:03:34,310
Obviously we're here right now.

2527
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:37,300
Now are you guys going to be
open to the general public?

2528
01:03:37,301 --> 01:03:38,200
Say the the,

2529
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:42,580
the average girl or guy who
does say Jujitsu tournaments
and wants to get in the

2530
01:03:42,581 --> 01:03:47,020
best shape of their life is are you
going to have products for them and a

2531
01:03:47,021 --> 01:03:49,240
service where they can sign
up for something like that.

2532
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:53,050
Certainly right now we are already
open in terms of of diagnostic testing.

2533
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,360
So you can come in based on your sport,

2534
01:03:55,361 --> 01:03:55,811
your goal,

2535
01:03:55,811 --> 01:03:56,531
whatever it may be.

2536
01:03:56,531 --> 01:04:00,160
We have customized diagnostic packages
cause some assessments just aren't

2537
01:04:00,161 --> 01:04:01,210
applicable to some people.

2538
01:04:01,211 --> 01:04:02,980
So we customize your assessment.

2539
01:04:02,981 --> 01:04:04,270
We basically tell you what you're good at,

2540
01:04:04,271 --> 01:04:05,104
what you're bad at.

2541
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:06,220
Then if you want to,

2542
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:06,440
you know,

2543
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,820
develop a program that's a little bit
of an upcharge to the real goal there is

2544
01:04:09,821 --> 01:04:14,320
to be able to do completely remote
training completely in house training and

2545
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:16,330
then any level of hybrid training as well.

2546
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:19,960
So right now you know what the world
needs is the diagnostic testing the data.

2547
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:21,550
We're already ready to do that.

2548
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,820
What we're building now is the
processes of being able to use data,

2549
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:27,250
put it into recommendations
and then scale that.

2550
01:04:27,251 --> 01:04:28,480
It's hard to teach somebody,

2551
01:04:28,481 --> 01:04:28,720
you know,

2552
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,830
everything that I do.

2553
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:30,790
So we're building the,

2554
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:31,151
you know,

2555
01:04:31,151 --> 01:04:31,360
the,

2556
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,640
the software's to essentially
replicate ourselves.

2557
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:34,170
Like my,

2558
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,050
my buddy in the other room,

2559
01:04:35,051 --> 01:04:35,741
Andre Hicks,

2560
01:04:35,741 --> 01:04:38,080
one of the best strength and
conditioning coaches in the world.

2561
01:04:38,081 --> 01:04:39,220
These guys will attest to it.

2562
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:39,710
Um,

2563
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:39,890
you,

2564
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:41,680
you can't teach people what he knows.

2565
01:04:41,681 --> 01:04:45,760
So we have to like code this into a
software a lot of if then type stuff and

2566
01:04:45,761 --> 01:04:48,100
then this is a able to
be scalable to everybody.

2567
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:49,450
We want to provide this training,

2568
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,040
uh,

2569
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:50,340
to,

2570
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:53,170
to people now the average
Joe trying to lose weight,

2571
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:53,780
you know,

2572
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:55,540
the weekend warrior,

2573
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:56,650
the Jujitsu,

2574
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,221
everything.

2575
01:04:57,221 --> 01:04:59,020
Then we want to be able to
provide this to everybody.

2576
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:00,790
Everybody deserves this type of training.

2577
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,410
That's minimal risk of injury,

2578
01:05:02,411 --> 01:05:03,041
high yield,

2579
01:05:03,041 --> 01:05:04,330
return efficient.

2580
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:05,860
That's what everyone's
looking for and that's,

2581
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:08,230
that's why the people are getting fatter.

2582
01:05:08,231 --> 01:05:08,411
There's,

2583
01:05:08,411 --> 01:05:11,680
there's no good positive reinforcement
out there and there's no clear roadmap

2584
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:13,180
how to get to where you want to be.

2585
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:13,691
You know,

2586
01:05:13,691 --> 01:05:13,781
we,

2587
01:05:13,781 --> 01:05:14,680
we put together like,

2588
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:15,011
you know,

2589
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:16,090
comparing it to Google maps,

2590
01:05:16,091 --> 01:05:16,950
everybody knows their end.

2591
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:17,981
They know where they want to be,

2592
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:20,380
but it can't tell you where you're at
unless you know exactly where you're

2593
01:05:20,381 --> 01:05:21,010
starting from.

2594
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:23,290
You have to do this baseline
assessment and they'll sometimes,

2595
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:25,470
it sucks to really
understand how fat your,

2596
01:05:25,471 --> 01:05:25,701
you know,

2597
01:05:25,701 --> 01:05:28,300
your body fat percentage
and your metabolic,

2598
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:29,260
and you're at risk of,

2599
01:05:29,261 --> 01:05:29,501
you know,

2600
01:05:29,501 --> 01:05:31,360
your insulin resistance
and things like that.

2601
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:33,640
But you have to figure out
where you're starting from,

2602
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:34,421
where you want to be.

2603
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:35,860
And that's how we develop a roadmap.

2604
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:36,940
So getting people,

2605
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:37,331
you know,

2606
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:37,471
and,

2607
01:05:37,471 --> 01:05:38,560
and we believe this is,

2608
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:41,470
this is the way of kind of making our
way into the healthcare system as well.

2609
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:44,020
That's our end goal as a
company to be able to provide,

2610
01:05:44,021 --> 01:05:44,560
you know,

2611
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,330
integrative fitness is
what we're calling it.

2612
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,840
Taking little pieces from all the
different methodologies of a fitness,

2613
01:05:49,841 --> 01:05:50,210
like,

2614
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:50,381
you know,

2615
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:50,581
we,

2616
01:05:50,581 --> 01:05:53,440
we bring meditation and Yoga
into our practice as well.

2617
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:57,280
So little pieces of just about
everything and be able to provide this to

2618
01:05:57,281 --> 01:05:58,540
everybody that that's what we're doing.

2619
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:00,070
So in the future,

2620
01:06:00,071 --> 01:06:01,480
when you guys are open,

2621
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:01,671
you're,

2622
01:06:01,671 --> 01:06:03,640
you're not totally open
to the general public yet,

2623
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:03,910
right?

2624
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:04,271
Correct.

2625
01:06:04,271 --> 01:06:04,630
Yeah,

2626
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:05,560
about six or eight months.

2627
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:09,340
Would someone have to come to you for
the first initial assessments and then

2628
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:13,180
possibly be able to do the
consulting either online or you know,

2629
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:13,541
through,

2630
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:15,130
through the application?

2631
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:15,431
I mean,

2632
01:06:15,431 --> 01:06:16,900
there's totally different degrees.

2633
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:19,180
We have a hundred percent
remote kits right now.

2634
01:06:19,181 --> 01:06:21,070
There's bad ass stuff
you can do on your iPad,

2635
01:06:21,071 --> 01:06:24,730
like biomechanical assessments that can
find your joints and things like that.

2636
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,110
We can send this to you.

2637
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:27,640
There's a lot of things that
we want to be able to do.

2638
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:31,030
A hundred percent remote for
the most complex assessment.

2639
01:06:31,031 --> 01:06:31,721
You got to come in,

2640
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:33,730
you got to do a vo two Max assessment.

2641
01:06:33,731 --> 01:06:35,700
We can't send you a metabolic
cart and shit obviously.

2642
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:39,520
So the goal is to get people to just
come into the facility and then do remote

2643
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:40,510
programming from there.

2644
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:41,430
And this is uh,

2645
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:41,720
you know,

2646
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:41,900
our,

2647
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:45,400
our concept is to put these diagnostic
centers and possibly the attached

2648
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:48,190
training centers as well and just
start providing these everywhere.

2649
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,371
Because,

2650
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:48,701
frankly,

2651
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:49,220
if we just went,

2652
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:49,421
you know,

2653
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:49,580
the,

2654
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,670
the diagnostic Jim of the future route,

2655
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:52,481
it could be five,

2656
01:06:52,481 --> 01:06:54,040
600 square feet low,

2657
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:54,311
you know,

2658
01:06:54,311 --> 01:06:56,770
low overhead facilities that
are just really efficient,

2659
01:06:56,771 --> 01:06:56,951
you know,

2660
01:06:56,951 --> 01:06:58,180
just putting people out,

2661
01:06:58,181 --> 01:06:59,350
collecting data left and right.

2662
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:00,431
That's amazing,

2663
01:07:00,431 --> 01:07:00,611
man.

2664
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:00,850
Yeah.

2665
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,181
Well,

2666
01:07:01,181 --> 01:07:06,181
what does it been like for you to make
this gigantic change and to basically be

2667
01:07:06,251 --> 01:07:07,570
like Ivan Drago?

2668
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:08,270
Yeah,

2669
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:08,931
pretty much.

2670
01:07:08,931 --> 01:07:09,031
That's,

2671
01:07:09,031 --> 01:07:09,170
that's,

2672
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:10,400
that's pretty much how,

2673
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:12,920
it's kind of how it's kind
of been like we took in that,

2674
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:13,783
uh,

2675
01:07:14,210 --> 01:07:17,380
the Ivan Drago approach probably
more than the rocky approach,

2676
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:19,010
which I think,

2677
01:07:19,011 --> 01:07:21,520
I think Russia is kind of tend to use
science a little bit more than their

2678
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:22,363
training.

2679
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:23,151
So to me,

2680
01:07:23,151 --> 01:07:24,260
at first it was almost like,

2681
01:07:24,261 --> 01:07:24,501
man,

2682
01:07:24,501 --> 01:07:24,551
I'm,

2683
01:07:24,551 --> 01:07:26,270
I'm going all in on this,

2684
01:07:26,271 --> 01:07:28,280
especially this cap against Demetrius.

2685
01:07:28,281 --> 01:07:28,551
I'm like,

2686
01:07:28,551 --> 01:07:28,821
God,

2687
01:07:28,821 --> 01:07:28,941
I'm,

2688
01:07:28,941 --> 01:07:29,380
I'm,

2689
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,460
I'm going all in man.

2690
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:30,850
Like,

2691
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:33,920
I'm going to have faith in
the science of why I got 100%.

2692
01:07:33,921 --> 01:07:36,320
I'm gonna do everything according to even,

2693
01:07:36,350 --> 01:07:36,621
you know,

2694
01:07:36,621 --> 01:07:38,030
even if even if I don't want to.

2695
01:07:38,031 --> 01:07:38,864
And that's,

2696
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:39,951
and I think he just,

2697
01:07:39,951 --> 01:07:41,540
as I started seeing my body change,

2698
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:43,700
I started seeing like the
coaches kind of adapt with like,

2699
01:07:43,701 --> 01:07:44,001
okay,

2700
01:07:44,001 --> 01:07:45,900
mass science is in the
center of this whole cat.

2701
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,800
And I saw the change though.

2702
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:51,890
And I've never felt so recovered the
night that I fought Demetrius Johnson,

2703
01:07:51,891 --> 01:07:53,150
I've never felt so good.

2704
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:56,120
And I'm 31 years old and I've
been cutting weight since I've,

2705
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:57,440
since I've been a kid.

2706
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:03,190
So you felt a big difference through the
entire camp doing this kind of method

2707
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,340
through the entire camp.

2708
01:08:04,341 --> 01:08:05,210
People would trip out.

2709
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:05,601
It'd be like,

2710
01:08:05,601 --> 01:08:06,141
people were like,

2711
01:08:06,141 --> 01:08:06,301
no,

2712
01:08:06,301 --> 01:08:06,801
you're committed.

2713
01:08:06,801 --> 01:08:07,250
You're,

2714
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:08,130
that's suicide.

2715
01:08:08,131 --> 01:08:08,241
Do you,

2716
01:08:08,241 --> 01:08:09,140
how come you're not doing this?

2717
01:08:09,141 --> 01:08:10,250
How come you're not doing that?

2718
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:11,721
And a,

2719
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:13,100
you would have to look at it and saying,

2720
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,140
how can we not doing
like what specifically?

2721
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:15,711
Oh No,

2722
01:08:15,711 --> 01:08:16,371
just a,

2723
01:08:16,371 --> 01:08:17,570
just a more work,

2724
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:18,080
more,

2725
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,100
more pad work,

2726
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:19,670
more uh,

2727
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:20,900
more sparring rounds,

2728
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:21,571
like things of that man,

2729
01:08:21,571 --> 01:08:24,440
I'd like to kind of like
the gladiator stuff.

2730
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:25,131
They're like,

2731
01:08:25,131 --> 01:08:25,550
no,

2732
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:25,990
it's,

2733
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:26,780
it's,

2734
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:28,460
it's an a goal according to my heart rate.

2735
01:08:28,461 --> 01:08:28,850
It's going to,

2736
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:30,110
it's going to go according to what?

2737
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:30,501
Well,

2738
01:08:30,501 --> 01:08:31,070
my windows,

2739
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:34,700
what my train of my windows of
opportunity of training are.

2740
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:38,310
You know what kind of
Mumbo jumbo they're like,

2741
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:39,440
yeah.

2742
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,460
Like nobody knows.

2743
01:08:40,461 --> 01:08:41,450
Like the day that I wake up,

2744
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:42,230
the day that I train,

2745
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:43,700
like nobody knows what's going on until,

2746
01:08:43,701 --> 01:08:44,090
until,

2747
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:48,050
until the data's got in the hands of
Kevin and Neuro Force One and then they,

2748
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:48,261
okay,

2749
01:08:48,261 --> 01:08:48,920
they,

2750
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:50,450
they determine this is how many rounds,

2751
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:53,120
this is how we're going to kind
of pick you for your fight.

2752
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:57,290
If you could imagine standing
on the sideline when he's
like sparring and rounds

2753
01:08:57,291 --> 01:08:59,130
and stuff and more slow down periods here,

2754
01:08:59,150 --> 01:08:59,841
like coaches,

2755
01:08:59,841 --> 01:09:00,980
like you can't do that.

2756
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:01,671
This is fighting.

2757
01:09:01,671 --> 01:09:04,460
You can't try and control your heart
rate while training and now this is

2758
01:09:04,461 --> 01:09:05,360
training for fighting.

2759
01:09:05,361 --> 01:09:05,601
Right.

2760
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:05,841
You know,

2761
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:06,471
so we're,

2762
01:09:06,471 --> 01:09:10,160
we're telling constantly telling
him to train less slow himself down.

2763
01:09:10,161 --> 01:09:10,581
You know,

2764
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:13,700
there was a little bit of clashing there
at the beginning and then they started

2765
01:09:13,701 --> 01:09:17,350
to see the body composition come around
and started to feel his power and,

2766
01:09:17,351 --> 01:09:19,400
and everyone kind of
bought into the process.

2767
01:09:19,401 --> 01:09:20,450
But it takes a while.

2768
01:09:20,451 --> 01:09:20,740
We're not,

2769
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:20,901
we're,

2770
01:09:20,901 --> 01:09:23,920
we're redefining it and we understand
that there's gonna be some pushback.

2771
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:28,250
This is such a universal concept when
it comes to strength and conditioning

2772
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:28,641
coaches,

2773
01:09:28,641 --> 01:09:32,990
it's being discussed over and over again
nowadays is that people are doing too

2774
01:09:32,991 --> 01:09:33,630
much,

2775
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:37,280
they're doing too much and your body's
just doesn't have a chance to recover.

2776
01:09:37,281 --> 01:09:39,590
And even though you're
getting in better shape,

2777
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,060
ultimately you're not getting in as good
a shape as you could have gotten if you

2778
01:09:44,061 --> 01:09:44,894
did less,

2779
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:47,300
which is so counter
intuitive for most people.

2780
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:47,860
Yeah.

2781
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:48,720
And that's Kinda how it,

2782
01:09:48,721 --> 01:09:49,091
that's,

2783
01:09:49,091 --> 01:09:49,780
that's,

2784
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:52,540
that's Kinda how I used to train so hard,

2785
01:09:52,541 --> 01:09:53,530
but I used to get hurt.

2786
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,630
I'm a nice to have back spasms kicking.

2787
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,400
Like that's how hard I would train.

2788
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:57,551
Like,

2789
01:09:57,551 --> 01:09:59,320
oh my back would literally
go out just kicking.

2790
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:03,430
I'll throw one kick and they had to
pull me off the gym in a stretcher,

2791
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:05,410
you know,

2792
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,600
and I had those problems
because I had just,

2793
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:08,680
I really,

2794
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,920
I didn't you almost train
according to you how,

2795
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:13,320
how you know what the,

2796
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:14,920
how the schedule is rather than,

2797
01:10:14,921 --> 01:10:15,221
okay,

2798
01:10:15,221 --> 01:10:16,310
this is this,

2799
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:18,570
this is the approach today
because this is this,

2800
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:21,820
this is how your stress
levels are like relaxed too.

2801
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:22,320
And then,

2802
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,510
and then at times you're
going to go hard and it's,

2803
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:26,340
it'll spike you at target.

2804
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:26,460
It's,

2805
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:26,980
it's,

2806
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:27,813
it's crazy.

2807
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:28,700
Well that's the

2808
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:29,720
crazy contrast,

2809
01:10:29,721 --> 01:10:29,841
right?

2810
01:10:29,841 --> 01:10:34,370
As between this championship mentality
that just wants to do more than anybody.

2811
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,430
Push harder train while
everybody else is asleep.

2812
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:41,120
Put your body through more than anybody
else is willing to do because that's

2813
01:10:41,121 --> 01:10:43,880
what makes a champion and then
someone like you comes along goes,

2814
01:10:43,881 --> 01:10:44,300
no,

2815
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:45,133
that's what more,

2816
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:46,220
that's what fucks you up.

2817
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,660
You need to slow down.

2818
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:49,370
You do last less rounds.

2819
01:10:49,371 --> 01:10:50,300
Move slower.

2820
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:51,181
Yeah,

2821
01:10:51,181 --> 01:10:51,601
exactly.

2822
01:10:51,601 --> 01:10:53,190
I mean that was one of the
biggest things I told them.

2823
01:10:53,191 --> 01:10:54,930
If you're not sleeping
eight to 10 hours a night,

2824
01:10:54,931 --> 01:10:56,400
when you're putting your body
through something like that,

2825
01:10:56,690 --> 01:10:59,610
you're doing your body and injustice
and you're not going to make adaptations

2826
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,160
when we're out there training
or breaking our body down.

2827
01:11:02,161 --> 01:11:03,270
It needs this repair.

2828
01:11:03,271 --> 01:11:03,820
We need,

2829
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:04,190
you know,

2830
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:05,520
activate our glymphatic system,

2831
01:11:05,521 --> 01:11:07,260
our brains waste removal system as well.

2832
01:11:07,261 --> 01:11:09,810
So we can go learn some new
things the next day as well.

2833
01:11:09,811 --> 01:11:10,770
So if you're not sleeping,

2834
01:11:10,771 --> 01:11:14,640
you're sub optimal just like you're not
properly hydrated and things as well.

2835
01:11:14,641 --> 01:11:14,881
This is,

2836
01:11:14,881 --> 01:11:16,500
this is all comes down
to the cellular level,

2837
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:17,070
you know,

2838
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:18,570
nervous system based approach.

2839
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:23,670
Now are you taking Melatonin or anything
to ensure that you go to sleep at a

2840
01:11:23,981 --> 01:11:25,030
specific time?

2841
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:27,400
Do you time your sleep sky schedule?

2842
01:11:27,401 --> 01:11:29,070
Like how are you organizing that?

2843
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:29,820
Yeah,

2844
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:30,381
I think,

2845
01:11:30,381 --> 01:11:30,740
I think,

2846
01:11:30,740 --> 01:11:31,840
and that's another thing,

2847
01:11:31,841 --> 01:11:32,770
even at times,

2848
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:33,340
uh,

2849
01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:35,740
according to when I would go to sleep.

2850
01:11:35,741 --> 01:11:38,500
Cause at that time do you know how you
train late and sometimes you come back

2851
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:40,870
and it just takes you
a while to go to sleep.

2852
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:41,500
Yeah.

2853
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,520
So even then it would,

2854
01:11:42,521 --> 01:11:43,061
it would it be like,

2855
01:11:43,061 --> 01:11:43,421
all right,

2856
01:11:43,421 --> 01:11:43,691
when,

2857
01:11:43,691 --> 01:11:45,130
when Henry's ready to wake up,

2858
01:11:45,131 --> 01:11:45,964
when it,

2859
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,280
obviously if I don't hit
my alarm and I snooze it,

2860
01:11:48,281 --> 01:11:51,520
I'm more lucky they can allow
me to sleep an extra two hours,

2861
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,260
which is important.

2862
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:53,531
Yeah.

2863
01:11:53,531 --> 01:11:54,364
So it's like the vibe,

2864
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:55,041
it's kind of like we'll,

2865
01:11:55,041 --> 01:11:56,470
Floyd does flow will be like,

2866
01:11:56,471 --> 01:11:56,621
hey,

2867
01:11:56,621 --> 01:11:58,120
we'll wake everybody up
at three in the morning,

2868
01:11:58,121 --> 01:12:00,130
but there's no scientific
to what flow is doing.

2869
01:12:00,131 --> 01:12:01,030
Like to us it's like,

2870
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:01,893
hey dude,

2871
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:03,220
let's we have to pick today.

2872
01:12:03,221 --> 01:12:04,054
So

2873
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:07,720
if there is science behind it and
he just doesn't talk about it,

2874
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:08,920
you know,

2875
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,870
it was Floyd like you don't know.

2876
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:11,141
Yeah,

2877
01:12:11,141 --> 01:12:11,974
I like to think so.

2878
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:12,401
Yeah.

2879
01:12:12,401 --> 01:12:15,340
Like when he drinks a
Pepsi after a workout,

2880
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:19,060
it was like a wonder there's no
science that I told him to do that,

2881
01:12:19,061 --> 01:12:23,410
to replenish his body with a ton of sugar
and high glycemic carbs right after.

2882
01:12:23,411 --> 01:12:24,700
That's the only time it's really good.

2883
01:12:24,701 --> 01:12:27,550
That little 45 window
of insulin sensitivity.

2884
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:29,800
So I do believe that one technology,

2885
01:12:29,801 --> 01:12:29,951
we,

2886
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,190
uh,

2887
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:31,270
what while we're on the sleep thing,

2888
01:12:31,271 --> 01:12:32,680
one that we were utilizing for Henry,

2889
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:33,250
um,

2890
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:36,490
just little light microcurrent here to
your temporal lobes and it's proven to

2891
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:39,970
increase serotonin and Melatonin
and decreased cortisol.

2892
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:43,720
So we're like manipulating biochemicals
and it's a very natural way of making

2893
01:12:43,721 --> 01:12:44,650
you feel drowsy.

2894
01:12:44,770 --> 01:12:45,950
What time do you do that up?

2895
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:49,660
We would do that immediately following
every rigorous training session to kind

2896
01:12:49,661 --> 01:12:52,450
of like negate inflammatory
responses and things like that.

2897
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:55,540
And I'll get you back into that
anabolic phase as quickly as possible.

2898
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,310
And then ideally right before bed,

2899
01:12:57,311 --> 01:12:58,144
every single night.

2900
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:59,590
Did you feel like a science project?

2901
01:12:59,591 --> 01:12:59,800
Well,

2902
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:00,730
this shit was going on.

2903
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,920
Did I did actually they did
a presentation on me and,

2904
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,450
and Russia with Roman,

2905
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:06,170
with the,

2906
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:07,520
with the scientists at the habit,

2907
01:13:07,521 --> 01:13:08,600
they use p I like,

2908
01:13:08,601 --> 01:13:10,770
they tracked everything
according to the Omegawave,

2909
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:12,260
the device that we're using.

2910
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:14,060
And he was able to kind of show it was I,

2911
01:13:14,061 --> 01:13:14,894
hey look,

2912
01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:16,800
my system might,

2913
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:17,120
you know,

2914
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,650
this system does work.

2915
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:19,610
You know,

2916
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:21,320
it's just like people were
kind of just tripping out.

2917
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:21,920
So I was,

2918
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,641
I went out there,

2919
01:13:22,641 --> 01:13:26,290
did the whole presentation
with a at Moscow and the,

2920
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:27,590
everybody was just kind of just like,

2921
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:28,880
everybody was kind of like,

2922
01:13:28,881 --> 01:13:29,510
wow,

2923
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:29,910
amazing.

2924
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:31,970
Someone works kind of scratching
their head and a little like,

2925
01:13:31,971 --> 01:13:32,220
damn,

2926
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:33,520
that's that.

2927
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:34,363
That's cool.

2928
01:13:34,370 --> 01:13:38,330
You're able to kind of see how I peaked
for this fight and how I was able to

2929
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:39,560
kind of survive fibroids.

2930
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:40,400
The Russians

2931
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:44,700
really been pioneering this type
of training for quite a while.

2932
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,670
Specifically the,

2933
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:50,420
the type of training like
that Pavel tot saline uses,

2934
01:13:50,421 --> 01:13:53,030
like where you're using way less energy,

2935
01:13:53,031 --> 01:13:54,440
you're working out way less,

2936
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:56,660
but you're getting better results from it.

2937
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:57,351
Like there's,

2938
01:13:57,351 --> 01:14:01,910
there's a lot of thought processes that
have been leaning in this direction from

2939
01:14:01,911 --> 01:14:01,971
a,

2940
01:14:01,971 --> 01:14:04,790
like a lot of really high level
top coaches for quite a while now.

2941
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:05,491
Yeah.

2942
01:14:05,491 --> 01:14:05,740
No,

2943
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:09,060
and it's cool to see it cause I come from
a traditional sport where you put your

2944
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:10,050
head down and you'd go,

2945
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:12,630
that's how fast rustling and more tight.

2946
01:14:12,631 --> 01:14:13,451
I think they're very,

2947
01:14:13,451 --> 01:14:14,270
uh,

2948
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:15,820
they're very alike in that sense.

2949
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,091
I could,

2950
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:17,140
they're very traditional.

2951
01:14:17,141 --> 01:14:18,220
Like the harder you go,

2952
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:19,660
the more you push through injury,

2953
01:14:19,661 --> 01:14:20,260
the,

2954
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:20,441
you know,

2955
01:14:20,441 --> 01:14:21,610
the better you will become.

2956
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:22,211
Yeah.

2957
01:14:22,211 --> 01:14:26,140
I also think that there's something
to be said for that though in terms of

2958
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:30,230
mental strength because one of the
things that wrestlers have that is,

2959
01:14:30,231 --> 01:14:34,030
it's not just that they have a great
skill and being able to manipulate bodies,

2960
01:14:34,031 --> 01:14:36,070
but they also have mental toughness.

2961
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:38,980
That's at a level that I don't
think you get from any other sport.

2962
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:41,320
I mean I think there's
a lot of pro athletes,

2963
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:43,930
even tennis players that
are just mentally tough.

2964
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:46,360
They're just tough so
people just know how to win.

2965
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:47,590
They know how to push themselves,

2966
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:52,000
but I feel like wrestlers are on another
level cause they're always tired.

2967
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:53,620
They're always overtrained,

2968
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:57,190
they're always dehydrated and they're
always working out with a bunch of fucking

2969
01:14:57,191 --> 01:14:58,024
savages.

2970
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:01,870
They're all the same way and everybody
takes pleasure in being miserable.

2971
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:05,650
There's something to that
that like you see it,

2972
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:06,191
man,

2973
01:15:06,191 --> 01:15:07,720
I've seen thousands of fights.

2974
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:12,130
You see there's something about wrestlers
they have just like an extra gear,

2975
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:16,420
like a high level wrestler in particular
has an extra gear that a lot of other

2976
01:15:16,421 --> 01:15:18,130
fighters just never developed.

2977
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:18,961
Yeah,

2978
01:15:18,961 --> 01:15:19,220
it's a,

2979
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:21,210
it's almost like I tell
people wrestling's not,

2980
01:15:21,211 --> 01:15:22,910
it's almost like not a sport man.

2981
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:23,940
It's like a culture.

2982
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:24,900
Yes.

2983
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,100
It's like you're just,

2984
01:15:26,101 --> 01:15:26,271
you're,

2985
01:15:26,271 --> 01:15:28,830
you're in the culture of
rustling and once you have that,

2986
01:15:28,831 --> 01:15:29,664
it's almost,

2987
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,960
there's an honor to it.

2988
01:15:30,961 --> 01:15:32,760
There's a warrior to it and like,

2989
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:33,594
and it's,

2990
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:34,870
it's,

2991
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:35,460
it's,

2992
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:35,631
it,

2993
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:36,000
it,

2994
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,580
I was just at the world championship,

2995
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:38,670
Joe and I can tell you,

2996
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:39,691
man,

2997
01:15:39,691 --> 01:15:41,580
the best athletes in the world,

2998
01:15:41,581 --> 01:15:42,420
I was just in Budapest,

2999
01:15:42,421 --> 01:15:45,150
Hungary and I saw Kyle Snyder
and all these guys compete.

3000
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:46,261
And I'm just like,

3001
01:15:46,261 --> 01:15:46,681
man,

3002
01:15:46,681 --> 01:15:47,400
these are the most,

3003
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,130
these are the best athletes in the world.

3004
01:15:49,131 --> 01:15:51,540
This is the hardest shit a
human being could ever do.

3005
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:56,130
If you're to see the finesse and the
strength and the power and what's involved

3006
01:15:56,131 --> 01:15:59,700
in becoming a world champion of watching
these guys go through this freaking

3007
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:00,271
tucks.

3008
01:16:00,271 --> 01:16:01,350
Just a tough,

3009
01:16:01,351 --> 01:16:02,610
the toughest tournament in the world.

3010
01:16:02,611 --> 01:16:04,590
And it's a,

3011
01:16:05,010 --> 01:16:05,371
I think,

3012
01:16:05,371 --> 01:16:08,640
I think what we do in a minute is fun
compared to a competitor wrestling.

3013
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:12,420
I really do like that stuff is like,

3014
01:16:12,421 --> 01:16:16,170
man that stuff is hard with these
guys go through win a tournament.

3015
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,330
Like it's the weight cuts,

3016
01:16:18,331 --> 01:16:18,840
the,

3017
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:19,160
you know,

3018
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,940
they don't get paid a lot of money.

3019
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:23,230
Like these dudes are literally Alpha,

3020
01:16:23,231 --> 01:16:25,260
the Gloria all each and every one of them.

3021
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:26,240
It's all glory.

3022
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,860
There's no financial reward at all.

3023
01:16:27,861 --> 01:16:29,510
That's what's fascinating about it.

3024
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:34,780
But it's just interesting to me that I
think you kind of need both in some weird

3025
01:16:36,021 --> 01:16:36,650
way.

3026
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:39,210
Your mind needs to develop this,

3027
01:16:39,211 --> 01:16:43,730
this layer of toughness that wrestlers
have and then I think once you've

3028
01:16:43,731 --> 01:16:47,980
developed that then maybe I
think your approach Kevin is,

3029
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:49,970
is like applicable.

3030
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:55,000
But I think that until an athlete has
that indomitable spirit until they have

3031
01:16:55,101 --> 01:16:58,970
that sort of that iron will
that a wrestler possesses,

3032
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,610
it's theirs to make a champion.

3033
01:17:01,611 --> 01:17:02,510
I think you need many,

3034
01:17:02,511 --> 01:17:03,380
many things,

3035
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:04,121
but I,

3036
01:17:04,121 --> 01:17:08,060
I don't think you can ever discount that
ability to work through discomfort the

3037
01:17:08,061 --> 01:17:09,050
way wrestlers have.

3038
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:13,430
I just don't think it's wise
as a professional athlete
at a championship level

3039
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:15,020
to compete compromised.

3040
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:15,391
Oh,

3041
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:15,840
agreed.

3042
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:16,021
Yeah.

3043
01:17:16,021 --> 01:17:16,410
You know,

3044
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:16,581
there,

3045
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:17,640
there's the intangibles,

3046
01:17:17,641 --> 01:17:19,020
the stuff that you just can't teach,

3047
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:20,340
you can't quantify,

3048
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:20,910
you know?

3049
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:23,460
So what we do our best to
quantify as much as we can,

3050
01:17:23,461 --> 01:17:23,880
but yeah,

3051
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,230
I mean I completely agree.

3052
01:17:25,231 --> 01:17:25,680
There's,

3053
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:28,740
you got to put in the time and the work
to learn the skill at some point and

3054
01:17:28,741 --> 01:17:29,860
then once you know it,

3055
01:17:29,861 --> 01:17:30,571
it's autonomic.

3056
01:17:30,571 --> 01:17:31,301
The skills master,

3057
01:17:31,301 --> 01:17:33,540
that's when you can kind of
kick it back into order method.

3058
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:33,930
I'm gonna,

3059
01:17:33,930 --> 01:17:35,130
I'm gonna agree with you Joe.

3060
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:36,210
I think I'm going to agree with you.

3061
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:40,140
And I think the reason why this works for
pretty much every MMA fighters because

3062
01:17:40,141 --> 01:17:41,310
we've all been through hell.

3063
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,070
Yeah.

3064
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:45,600
Like an order for you to see
an end believe in science
is you have to go through

3065
01:17:45,601 --> 01:17:46,590
how to understand like,

3066
01:17:46,591 --> 01:17:46,951
hey man,

3067
01:17:46,951 --> 01:17:48,960
the hard way probably isn't the best way.

3068
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:51,330
But when you were talking about your,

3069
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:52,543
your,

3070
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,880
the feeling that you had in not wanting
to ever feel the pain of losing again,

3071
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:02,460
that feeling that you had when your ankle
is going out and that they'd be like,

3072
01:18:02,461 --> 01:18:03,061
fuck this.

3073
01:18:03,061 --> 01:18:03,241
No,

3074
01:18:03,241 --> 01:18:03,391
no,

3075
01:18:03,391 --> 01:18:03,750
no,

3076
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:04,650
I'm not doing this.

3077
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,420
I'm going to find a way out of this.

3078
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:11,780
Like you almost have to experience
lows in order to have that.

3079
01:18:11,941 --> 01:18:12,171
And I,

3080
01:18:12,171 --> 01:18:17,171
I feel like one of the things
about wrestling that makes
it a sport that creates

3081
01:18:17,491 --> 01:18:22,491
so many fucking savages is because
you go through so much shit,

3082
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:24,930
so much hardship,

3083
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:25,650
so,

3084
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:28,260
so much difficulty that you know,

3085
01:18:28,261 --> 01:18:33,261
if you had science based
wrestling programs the way
you're doing a science based

3086
01:18:33,331 --> 01:18:35,500
camp and you went in and you know,

3087
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,091
said everybody,

3088
01:18:36,091 --> 01:18:36,900
you got to slow down,

3089
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:37,441
slow down.

3090
01:18:37,441 --> 01:18:38,274
You know like you,

3091
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:39,540
you're going too hard,

3092
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:40,261
slow down,

3093
01:18:40,261 --> 01:18:41,430
can't run up hills today.

3094
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:41,890
You know,

3095
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:42,110
your,

3096
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:42,430
your,

3097
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:45,780
your DC brain waves or a
wrestling coach would be like,

3098
01:18:45,781 --> 01:18:47,390
shut the fuck up and sit to,

3099
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:52,050
who is this asshole give Dan Gable
brought you in a camp and you guys are

3100
01:18:52,051 --> 01:18:53,310
running around doing all this stuff.

3101
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:53,701
He'd be like,

3102
01:18:53,701 --> 01:18:54,420
what?

3103
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:54,601
Like,

3104
01:18:54,601 --> 01:18:55,434
what are you saying?

3105
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,030
Like this is how we make champions.

3106
01:18:57,170 --> 01:18:57,700
Yeah.

3107
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:57,911
Yeah.

3108
01:18:57,911 --> 01:18:59,050
But like I said,

3109
01:18:59,051 --> 01:19:00,250
I think you hit the nail on the head.

3110
01:19:00,251 --> 01:19:01,300
I think it's for,

3111
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:01,841
to me,

3112
01:19:01,841 --> 01:19:02,980
the way I would see it as like,

3113
01:19:02,981 --> 01:19:04,510
you have to kind of go through how a,

3114
01:19:04,590 --> 01:19:07,630
that understanding because you had to go
through that callus through that burn.

3115
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:08,890
But I feel like,

3116
01:19:08,890 --> 01:19:10,000
especially in MMA,

3117
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:12,610
a lot of athletes or even
athletes just in general,

3118
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:13,100
they,

3119
01:19:13,100 --> 01:19:14,890
everybody buses or butts on what's,

3120
01:19:14,910 --> 01:19:15,880
if you're an elite athlete,

3121
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:16,710
like you'll,

3122
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:17,431
you'll always train,

3123
01:19:17,431 --> 01:19:18,790
maybe not the smartest way.

3124
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:19,841
Yeah.

3125
01:19:19,841 --> 01:19:20,674
You know,

3126
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:21,580
like it's,

3127
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:22,413
uh,

3128
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:23,170
yeah,

3129
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:25,120
I guess you could add more to,

3130
01:19:25,121 --> 01:19:25,920
to your training or,

3131
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:26,081
or,

3132
01:19:26,081 --> 01:19:26,300
or,

3133
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:26,680
or,

3134
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:26,920
or,

3135
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:29,120
or take away less if there's a,

3136
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,700
but there's a fine line to it.

3137
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:33,500
Do you have the fine line
is what's fascinating to me?

3138
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:33,940
Yeah.

3139
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:34,110
Well,

3140
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:34,400
uh,

3141
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,880
like one of the things that I love
about MMA is that it's so broad.

3142
01:19:37,881 --> 01:19:42,881
There are so many skills that the approach
to success is different with every

3143
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:44,331
individual.

3144
01:19:44,331 --> 01:19:48,890
And you have to find what that approach
is like the approach to you for your,

3145
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:49,460
for you,

3146
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:52,730
for you to achieve success is going to
be different than the approach for a

3147
01:19:52,731 --> 01:19:53,421
different athlete.

3148
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:53,900
It doesn't,

3149
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:55,490
it doesn't have the same
skills that you have,

3150
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:57,380
but like Anderson Silva,

3151
01:19:57,410 --> 01:19:58,250
perfect example,

3152
01:19:58,280 --> 01:19:59,113
he's not a wrestler.

3153
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:00,080
It's going to have a different,

3154
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:01,490
different approach.

3155
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:01,880
This,

3156
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:05,120
there's going to be different things
that they work on and training,

3157
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:06,710
there's going to be a different mindset.

3158
01:20:06,711 --> 01:20:08,220
It's going to a different
way of preparing.

3159
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:08,821
Right,

3160
01:20:08,821 --> 01:20:09,091
right.

3161
01:20:09,091 --> 01:20:09,231
And,

3162
01:20:09,231 --> 01:20:09,411
and,

3163
01:20:09,411 --> 01:20:11,900
and it's all according to
everybody according like not,

3164
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:12,520
it's,

3165
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:14,190
I think a lot of things are cookie cutter.

3166
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:15,810
Like looking at it the way now,

3167
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:19,410
it's like a lot of things have
have stayed even in wrestling,

3168
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:21,330
like just over tradition,

3169
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:22,411
you know,

3170
01:20:22,411 --> 01:20:23,041
like bridging,

3171
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:24,360
like every time I see you,

3172
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:26,180
but bridge and the way they
stretched and they're gonna be like,

3173
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:28,520
do that shit so bad for you.

3174
01:20:28,521 --> 01:20:31,650
And then that'd be doing like
these like springs on their head.

3175
01:20:31,651 --> 01:20:32,370
I'm just like,

3176
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:32,731
Kevin,

3177
01:20:32,731 --> 01:20:33,390
how bad,

3178
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:34,560
how bad is bridging for you?

3179
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:35,341
Uh,

3180
01:20:35,341 --> 01:20:35,621
I mean,

3181
01:20:35,621 --> 01:20:35,741
I,

3182
01:20:35,741 --> 01:20:36,820
I wouldn't recommend it.

3183
01:20:36,821 --> 01:20:37,230
I mean,

3184
01:20:37,230 --> 01:20:37,650
uh,

3185
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:38,020
it,

3186
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:40,240
but Mike Tyson always looked
bad ass and he's doing it.

3187
01:20:40,241 --> 01:20:41,770
But I was going to say
it looks pretty bad ass.

3188
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:42,663
I mean,

3189
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:43,593
teacher,

3190
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:44,430
have you ever

3191
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:47,130
thrown with the iron
neck with the iron neck?

3192
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:47,993
We don't know about that.

3193
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:48,351
Oh,

3194
01:20:48,351 --> 01:20:49,184
I got one.

3195
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:50,690
Oh,

3196
01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:52,480
gotta try this and sell
some of your videos.

3197
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:53,710
That's definitely one
of the missing links.

3198
01:20:53,711 --> 01:20:54,940
Why a lot of these wrestlers get hurt.

3199
01:20:54,941 --> 01:20:55,120
Then,

3200
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:55,420
you know,

3201
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:56,150
neck and stability,

3202
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:59,620
the postural issues that had come
associated with it as well as guys need to

3203
01:20:59,621 --> 01:21:00,490
strengthen their necks.

3204
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:01,361
It's a halo.

3205
01:21:01,361 --> 01:21:02,200
You put it on,

3206
01:21:02,230 --> 01:21:03,990
you pump it up like a Reebok pump.

3207
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,040
Remember the Reebok pump,

3208
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:08,620
you pump this sucker up so
it tightens up on your head.

3209
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,970
You put a chin strap on,

3210
01:21:09,971 --> 01:21:14,020
it's got a bungee cable on
that's set to 50 pounds back up.

3211
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:18,130
And then there's resistance on
the halo so it spins the resist.

3212
01:21:18,131 --> 01:21:22,210
The Halo has like you could tighten
up our clamp down or loosen up the

3213
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:24,100
resistance and you do these exercises.

3214
01:21:24,101 --> 01:21:24,934
Like

3215
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:27,730
he goes sideways.

3216
01:21:27,731 --> 01:21:28,390
You do like,

3217
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:29,140
like,

3218
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:30,640
like loops back and forth.

3219
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:30,880
It's,

3220
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,930
it's fucking bad ass.

3221
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:33,293
That's crazy.

3222
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:34,170
I'm excited man.

3223
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:35,950
I got to,

3224
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:36,191
yeah,

3225
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:38,320
you got to trust that why
sign that waiver is that

3226
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:44,190
you signed a waiver because we got to
get ahold of some of that weed while

3227
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:46,540
you're running through walls and all the

3228
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:52,480
in the float tank if you want to try
the food because the waivers for two,

3229
01:21:52,481 --> 01:21:53,380
I don't want you to lose your mind.

3230
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:53,900
Yeah.

3231
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,400
The sensory immersion
that let's float tanks,

3232
01:21:55,401 --> 01:21:56,111
they're pretty bad ass.

3233
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,930
We studied those quite a bit for the
nervous system based stuff where we're

3234
01:21:58,931 --> 01:22:00,610
building kind of our
own sensory immersion,

3235
01:22:00,611 --> 01:22:02,590
like mindfulness room
of the future as well.

3236
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,300
All the walls led screens.

3237
01:22:04,301 --> 01:22:06,610
So you could put yourself fully
immersed in any environment.

3238
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:10,660
It's going to be pretty
bad ass mindfulness is so
overlooked in these sports.

3239
01:22:10,661 --> 01:22:11,494
How important,

3240
01:22:11,650 --> 01:22:12,121
and I know you're,

3241
01:22:12,121 --> 01:22:13,390
you're a meditation guy as well.

3242
01:22:13,391 --> 01:22:13,770
It's,

3243
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:13,961
you know,

3244
01:22:13,961 --> 01:22:15,010
get getting your mind right.

3245
01:22:15,011 --> 01:22:15,170
Is,

3246
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:16,570
is invaluable.

3247
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:17,021
Yeah.

3248
01:22:17,021 --> 01:22:17,840
And you were saying that you

3249
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:21,850
meditation and Yoga is also a part of
the preparation that you guys employ.

3250
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:22,211
Oh,

3251
01:22:22,211 --> 01:22:23,200
100% yeah.

3252
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,610
I mean it all comes down to,

3253
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:27,760
you know when we're doing our
warm up training and recovery,

3254
01:22:27,761 --> 01:22:29,020
it's all mind and body.

3255
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,920
So his warmup is going to include
like Somata sensory reaction testing.

3256
01:22:32,921 --> 01:22:35,620
So imagine like a a wall and
it has different lights on it.

3257
01:22:35,621 --> 01:22:36,850
You were act as quickly as you can.

3258
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:38,710
As soon as they light
up and I say all right,

3259
01:22:38,711 --> 01:22:39,850
if the light comes up red,

3260
01:22:39,851 --> 01:22:41,080
use your right hand and blue,

3261
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:41,980
use your left hand.

3262
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:45,760
So we're invoking cognitive decision
making processes that we need to have.

3263
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:47,020
You stand on one of these shake plates,

3264
01:22:47,021 --> 01:22:48,340
appropriate receptive plate.

3265
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,360
Now your vision,

3266
01:22:49,361 --> 01:22:50,230
your neuromuscular,

3267
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,130
your appropriate receptive,

3268
01:22:51,131 --> 01:22:52,060
everything is warmed up.

3269
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:52,571
Everything,

3270
01:22:52,571 --> 01:22:54,220
every part of your brain
that's going to equate to,

3271
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:54,611
you know,

3272
01:22:54,611 --> 01:22:55,391
force output,

3273
01:22:55,391 --> 01:22:56,560
absorption and so on.

3274
01:22:56,830 --> 01:22:58,630
Then we go do a more traditional warmup,

3275
01:22:58,690 --> 01:22:59,710
whatever that may be.

3276
01:22:59,860 --> 01:23:01,480
We do a cognitive training,

3277
01:23:01,481 --> 01:23:03,850
we do physical training more
from a functional aspect.

3278
01:23:04,030 --> 01:23:04,930
And then as soon as you're done,

3279
01:23:04,931 --> 01:23:07,270
we you into a mine based recovery as well.

3280
01:23:07,271 --> 01:23:10,300
So we get you into yoga
meditation that you know,

3281
01:23:10,301 --> 01:23:13,470
technology we're playing with right
now that manipulates your biochemicals.

3282
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:13,960
Uh,

3283
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:14,141
you know,

3284
01:23:14,141 --> 01:23:15,430
just just about everything man.

3285
01:23:15,431 --> 01:23:17,680
It's mind and body every
step along the way.

3286
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,940
And when you're doing yoga,

3287
01:23:18,941 --> 01:23:21,400
you're doing yoga to increase mobility.

3288
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:23,860
Are you doing it for the mental training?

3289
01:23:23,861 --> 01:23:24,521
For both?

3290
01:23:24,521 --> 01:23:25,050
Like,

3291
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:25,640
um,

3292
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,700
definitely a little bit of both.

3293
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:29,370
We believe I'm Andre more
leads that the yoga what,

3294
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:30,061
what we're doing over there.

3295
01:23:30,061 --> 01:23:31,740
So He'd be better to ask specifically,

3296
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:34,560
but we believe it largely for
nervous system and for breathing.

3297
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:34,910
Uh,

3298
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:37,830
one thing we really talked about is
the diaphragmatic breathing and yoga is

3299
01:23:37,831 --> 01:23:40,590
really a calm environment to be
able to focus on your breathing.

3300
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:41,101
What does that mean?

3301
01:23:41,101 --> 01:23:43,040
Diaphragmatic breathing?

3302
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:43,290
Yeah,

3303
01:23:43,290 --> 01:23:44,360
breathing from your diaphragm.

3304
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:45,300
This is how we're all born.

3305
01:23:45,301 --> 01:23:46,740
Breathing from our diaphragm and just,

3306
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:47,370
you know,

3307
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:48,960
eventually we ended up
breathing from our chest,

3308
01:23:48,961 --> 01:23:52,110
which is very ineffective
for metabolic efficiency.

3309
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:52,944
And Jennifer,

3310
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,160
just like when you see
like the Wim Hoff Guy,

3311
01:23:56,161 --> 01:24:00,180
he's what was breathing from his gut here
and that's like engaging your core as

3312
01:24:00,181 --> 01:24:01,500
opposed to just like your chest.

3313
01:24:01,501 --> 01:24:03,300
So you're actually getting deeper breaths.

3314
01:24:03,310 --> 01:24:06,120
You're encouraging like core
stability and things as well.

3315
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,980
It's better for metabolic efficiency.

3316
01:24:07,981 --> 01:24:12,000
So when you're actually exercising it's
better for delaying anaerobic threshold,

3317
01:24:12,001 --> 01:24:13,020
buffering lactate,

3318
01:24:13,021 --> 01:24:16,290
things like that as well as keeping
the nervous system calm as well.

3319
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:18,990
Do you think there's any
benefit to breathing through
your nose and out through

3320
01:24:18,991 --> 01:24:19,410
your mouth?

3321
01:24:19,410 --> 01:24:20,243
Or is that,

3322
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:20,970
um,

3323
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:21,370
I,

3324
01:24:21,370 --> 01:24:22,203
I,

3325
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:24,120
I'd say it's an on an
individualized basis.

3326
01:24:24,121 --> 01:24:24,840
I think if it,

3327
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,330
the best thing is to not think about
your breathing when you start thinking

3328
01:24:27,331 --> 01:24:27,601
about it,

3329
01:24:27,601 --> 01:24:28,740
it can kind of get fucked up.

3330
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:31,580
So if we encourage diaphragmatic
breathing without this,

3331
01:24:31,581 --> 01:24:33,300
this technology we utilize is actually,

3332
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:35,340
even though when you're
utilizing the technology,

3333
01:24:35,341 --> 01:24:37,650
you're just breathing in
and out through your mouth,

3334
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,480
it actually encourages
in through the nose,

3335
01:24:39,481 --> 01:24:40,770
out through the mouth
when you're training.

3336
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:41,301
So I'm,

3337
01:24:41,301 --> 01:24:43,170
I mean I'm not an expert
specifically on that,

3338
01:24:43,171 --> 01:24:43,860
but it sounds,

3339
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:44,071
yeah,

3340
01:24:44,071 --> 01:24:46,350
I think there's definitely some
performance advantage to it.

3341
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:46,630
Oh,

3342
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:47,431
I want to talk to him.

3343
01:24:47,431 --> 01:24:48,181
He may know Joe.

3344
01:24:48,181 --> 01:24:48,870
Thank you Kevin.

3345
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:50,320
I appreciate him and this guy will,

3346
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:50,680
he goes,

3347
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:50,930
go,

3348
01:24:50,930 --> 01:24:51,763
go on all day.

3349
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:52,501
Kevin.

3350
01:24:52,501 --> 01:24:53,730
Thank you so much for those,

3351
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:55,140
those amazing of course,

3352
01:24:55,570 --> 01:24:58,720
but where they could find out about
your company and what your website is.

3353
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,370
Uh,

3354
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:00,540
our company's in Scottsdale,

3355
01:25:00,541 --> 01:25:01,230
Arizona.

3356
01:25:01,230 --> 01:25:04,440
The website is neuro force one o n e.com.

3357
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:05,460
Check us out.

3358
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:05,821
All right,

3359
01:25:05,821 --> 01:25:06,180
thank you.

3360
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:06,640
Thanks chef.

3361
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:07,750
Those are very informative,

3362
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:09,480
intense shit.

3363
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:12,910
Son Henry is now become
the standard because uh,

3364
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:17,520
like he said that a Roman
for the performance institute
debt did that PowerPoint

3365
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,510
presentation for UFC Moscow.

3366
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:23,650
He told us he's the first athlete that
ever did eight weeks that they have eight

3367
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:24,910
weeks collection of data.

3368
01:25:25,210 --> 01:25:30,210
So Henry's now become the standard of
the system that a Roman had newer force

3369
01:25:31,691 --> 01:25:34,870
one and all the data put together as
the first time ever that an athlete

3370
01:25:34,871 --> 01:25:37,390
actually stuck to the
program for eight weeks.

3371
01:25:37,391 --> 01:25:38,224
That's fantastic.

3372
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:43,390
So for you now you got the title and
there is talk about you fighting for the

3373
01:25:44,901 --> 01:25:47,570
bantamweight title against
champion Tj Dillashaw.

3374
01:25:47,571 --> 01:25:48,404
What are your thoughts?

3375
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:49,520
Where are you at right now?

3376
01:25:49,521 --> 01:25:50,180
Like what are you,

3377
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:50,960
what are your goals?

3378
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:51,110
It's,

3379
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:53,490
it's a beautiful town of
[inaudible] to be the champ.

3380
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:56,540
There's a,

3381
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:56,850
there's,

3382
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,710
there's tons of tons of options.

3383
01:25:58,711 --> 01:25:59,280
Joe,

3384
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,750
where's your contract out right now?

3385
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:01,880
Oh,

3386
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:02,240
uh,

3387
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,671
I have,

3388
01:26:02,671 --> 01:26:04,130
I still about seven fights

3389
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:04,720
left,

3390
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:05,061
you know,

3391
01:26:05,061 --> 01:26:05,241
but,

3392
01:26:05,241 --> 01:26:05,330
uh,

3393
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:05,880
I'm under,

3394
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:06,110
I'm,

3395
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:09,740
we're going to renegotiate because I
think more than likely that TG five might

3396
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:10,693
might happen.

3397
01:26:11,410 --> 01:26:13,760
Gonna happen that TG
fight might happen if,

3398
01:26:13,761 --> 01:26:14,120
you know,

3399
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,330
if it's going to be a dumb with,

3400
01:26:15,331 --> 01:26:15,830
with uh,

3401
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:16,970
with the flyweight division.

3402
01:26:17,410 --> 01:26:18,010
You know,

3403
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:20,360
I think the cat's out
the bag and you know,

3404
01:26:20,361 --> 01:26:21,980
they didn't have had mentioned that to me,

3405
01:26:21,981 --> 01:26:22,140
so,

3406
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:22,431
hey,

3407
01:26:22,431 --> 01:26:22,611
so,

3408
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:22,821
you know,

3409
01:26:22,821 --> 01:26:23,370
we were going,

3410
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:25,180
we want to take you up
on that offer a view,

3411
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:27,320
a challenging to go up against Tj,

3412
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:28,173
but this is what,

3413
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:33,230
this is where the company's been thinking
about for awhile and teachers down for

3414
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:34,064
it too.

3415
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:34,971
I don't think so.

3416
01:26:34,971 --> 01:26:38,570
I think TJ wants to
come down to 25 I think.

3417
01:26:38,571 --> 01:26:39,830
I think that's Kinda like the,

3418
01:26:39,890 --> 01:26:41,330
like the delay a little bit.

3419
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:41,570
Yeah.

3420
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:42,000
Now,

3421
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,890
would you rather fight him at 35 so you
can get an additional title or would you

3422
01:26:45,891 --> 01:26:49,280
rather fight him at 35 because you don't
have to cut weight or what's your head?

3423
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:49,820
I don't,

3424
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:51,080
I like both ideas.

3425
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:52,550
I actually kind of left it off to him.

3426
01:26:52,551 --> 01:26:52,791
I said,

3427
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:52,941
sir,

3428
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:53,241
I don't know,

3429
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:54,290
but I want to fight you,

3430
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:54,500
man.

3431
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:54,771
I said,

3432
01:26:54,771 --> 01:26:55,521
I wanna fight Tj.

3433
01:26:55,521 --> 01:26:56,270
I want to,

3434
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:57,920
I want to go out to the next best thing.

3435
01:26:57,921 --> 01:26:58,220
And that's,

3436
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:58,970
I think that's him,

3437
01:26:58,970 --> 01:26:59,380
you know,

3438
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:01,460
if you don't mind fighting
for 25 or 35 yeah,

3439
01:27:01,461 --> 01:27:01,950
I don't,

3440
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:02,783
that makes it easier.

3441
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:03,673
Yeah,

3442
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:04,690
that definitely makes sense.

3443
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:05,061
I'm just like,

3444
01:27:05,061 --> 01:27:05,211
Hey,

3445
01:27:05,211 --> 01:27:05,511
let's,

3446
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:07,220
let's see it at 25 listed at 35,

3447
01:27:07,221 --> 01:27:07,611
but let's,

3448
01:27:07,611 --> 01:27:08,270
uh,

3449
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:08,990
let's fight man.

3450
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:09,800
That's what your,

3451
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:10,670
your mind is right now.

3452
01:27:10,671 --> 01:27:12,140
That's your number one goal.

3453
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:12,830
Yeah.

3454
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:13,190
Yeah.

3455
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:15,350
And I believe Tj wants to fight me too.

3456
01:27:15,351 --> 01:27:15,741
I think,

3457
01:27:15,741 --> 01:27:16,574
uh,

3458
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:17,301
I think,

3459
01:27:17,301 --> 01:27:17,451
you know,

3460
01:27:17,451 --> 01:27:18,201
beating Demetrius,

3461
01:27:18,201 --> 01:27:18,920
I think they kind of,

3462
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,770
that's going to help
his name and you know,

3463
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:21,653
you know,

3464
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,010
I guess for both you can sit,

3465
01:27:23,011 --> 01:27:23,844
you know,

3466
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:27,710
so now that Demetrius has left the
division and gone off to one fc to get

3467
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:33,080
where I'm,

3468
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:34,700
where do you think the
division is right now?

3469
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:35,593
I mean,

3470
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:36,250
I,

3471
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:37,070
um,

3472
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:38,000
is that one reason,

3473
01:27:38,001 --> 01:27:41,390
like if you won at 35
and one of the title 35,

3474
01:27:41,391 --> 01:27:45,530
would you consider dropping the 25 pound
title and competing at 35 or would you

3475
01:27:45,531 --> 01:27:46,820
rather stay at 25?

3476
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:48,140
Ah,

3477
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:48,591
I would,

3478
01:27:48,591 --> 01:27:49,190
I wouldn't mind.

3479
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:50,690
I wouldn't mind dabbling in both.

3480
01:27:50,691 --> 01:27:50,931
I mean,

3481
01:27:50,931 --> 01:27:51,591
I know that's a,

3482
01:27:51,591 --> 01:27:52,280
that's Kinda,

3483
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,061
that's kind of broad,

3484
01:27:53,061 --> 01:27:54,620
but I won't point.

3485
01:27:54,621 --> 01:27:58,020
You do get tired of cutting
weight and I'm kind of a,

3486
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:58,460
anyway,

3487
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:01,490
right now I'm probably
about probably about 50,

3488
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,520
50.

3489
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,340
You don't wonder,

3490
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:04,760
I mean,

3491
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:08,030
losing 15 pounds is way
better than losing 25 pounds.

3492
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:09,180
Yeah.

3493
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:09,330
I'm,

3494
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:09,611
I'm,

3495
01:28:09,611 --> 01:28:09,800
I'm,

3496
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:10,281
I'm a little,

3497
01:28:10,281 --> 01:28:11,540
I'm a little bigger now,

3498
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:12,230
uh,

3499
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:12,831
because of,

3500
01:28:12,831 --> 01:28:14,060
because of that reason I might,

3501
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:16,660
I might have to fight at a bad time,

3502
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:17,760
so I'm kind of a,

3503
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:19,003
I think more like him,

3504
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,410
it might happen at bat him away.

3505
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:26,440
What people don't know is that actually
Henry almost fought TJ when he was the

3506
01:28:26,441 --> 01:28:30,010
champ when Hannah Borow didn't make
weight his first fight in the UFC.

3507
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:31,031
He didn't make weight.

3508
01:28:31,031 --> 01:28:33,220
But two hours later
Hanan Barao didn't make,

3509
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:38,400
make weight and they were looking for
somebody to go up and fight TJ when Joe

3510
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:42,220
Soto Fordham [inaudible]
was the number one option.

3511
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:46,090
But Henry had already declined.

3512
01:28:46,091 --> 01:28:46,360
Uh,

3513
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:48,070
he said he wasn't fighting Jorgensen and,

3514
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:52,750
but now here we are three years
later back now he's got the tent,

3515
01:28:53,230 --> 01:28:54,160
he's got the belt.

3516
01:28:54,490 --> 01:28:57,910
Tj came back and won the belt was do it.

3517
01:28:57,911 --> 01:28:59,650
These guys been beefing for uh,

3518
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:00,851
for a long time.

3519
01:29:00,851 --> 01:29:04,140
So ever since the first
day he came into the UFC,

3520
01:29:04,141 --> 01:29:05,370
him and Tj have been added.

3521
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:07,050
And then on the ultimate fighter,

3522
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:08,970
ultimate fighter 24,

3523
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:11,790
they had a Duane bang was the coach.

3524
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:13,950
There was like a little
beef with Henry and,

3525
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,090
and uh,

3526
01:29:15,090 --> 01:29:17,550
Benevidez his team Benevidez his coach.

3527
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:20,010
So it Kinda goes way back

3528
01:29:21,010 --> 01:29:21,410
there.

3529
01:29:21,410 --> 01:29:23,060
There's a bit of animosity to,

3530
01:29:23,061 --> 01:29:23,894
on top of everything.

3531
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:26,300
Now you are very goal oriented guy.

3532
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:26,980
Do you,

3533
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:27,140
uh,

3534
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:30,980
do you have your career mapped out in
terms of like when you would like to get

3535
01:29:30,981 --> 01:29:31,814
out of the game?

3536
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:33,260
Oh my do.

3537
01:29:33,261 --> 01:29:34,850
I do and I think about it a lot cause man,

3538
01:29:34,851 --> 01:29:35,060
I,

3539
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:36,200
I'll be honest with you Joe,

3540
01:29:36,201 --> 01:29:36,501
I've,

3541
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:37,040
uh,

3542
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,900
I've accomplished everything
I've ever wanted to,

3543
01:29:39,650 --> 01:29:40,120
you know,

3544
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:41,300
and in my career,

3545
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:42,051
like I've always,

3546
01:29:42,051 --> 01:29:42,380
I had,

3547
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:44,000
I had three goals and I was just,

3548
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:44,893
you know,

3549
01:29:45,170 --> 01:29:46,890
my number one goal was
just to be a good person,

3550
01:29:46,891 --> 01:29:48,500
that good father and a good husband.

3551
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:51,110
And then after that we'll say
being an Olympic champ and then,

3552
01:29:51,111 --> 01:29:51,620
and then,

3553
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:52,990
and then eventually UFC champs.

3554
01:29:52,991 --> 01:29:53,870
So everything's kind of,

3555
01:29:53,871 --> 01:29:54,704
uh,

3556
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:55,570
I,

3557
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:55,761
I've,

3558
01:29:55,761 --> 01:29:59,660
I've done everything in that
I've ever kind of set my mind to,

3559
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:00,710
you know,

3560
01:30:00,710 --> 01:30:01,900
those are the two biggest things,

3561
01:30:01,910 --> 01:30:03,980
the two magnets to get
anybody to get everything.

3562
01:30:04,970 --> 01:30:05,361
And,

3563
01:30:05,361 --> 01:30:06,194
uh,

3564
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:06,420
I,

3565
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:09,920
I don't see myself fighting for more
than for more than maybe three to four

3566
01:30:09,921 --> 01:30:10,754
years.

3567
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:12,290
The only collagen woods,

3568
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:17,260
you really are in this rare space
where you have the possibility of being

3569
01:30:17,261 --> 01:30:20,380
considered one of the greatest combat
sport athletes of all time when you're

3570
01:30:20,381 --> 01:30:21,250
already in the mix.

3571
01:30:21,251 --> 01:30:21,620
Right.

3572
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:22,690
The Olympic gold medalist,

3573
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:24,310
UFC champion.

3574
01:30:24,730 --> 01:30:25,091
I mean,

3575
01:30:25,091 --> 01:30:25,690
you,

3576
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:30,690
you have this very rare opportunity
for incredible greatness.

3577
01:30:30,970 --> 01:30:31,803
Yeah.

3578
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:33,680
I think for the most part,

3579
01:30:33,681 --> 01:30:33,831
I mean,

3580
01:30:33,831 --> 01:30:35,030
I like to eventually,

3581
01:30:35,031 --> 01:30:35,510
I mean,

3582
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:38,000
I do a lot of motivational speaking.

3583
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:38,370
Uh,

3584
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:39,500
I've been doing that for a while.

3585
01:30:39,501 --> 01:30:41,360
Joe Is spoken in front
of like the biggest,

3586
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:43,100
the biggest companies in the world.

3587
01:30:43,101 --> 01:30:43,341
I mean,

3588
01:30:43,341 --> 01:30:44,210
the Coca Cola,

3589
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,710
like the TD Ameritrade,

3590
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:46,941
Procter and gamble,

3591
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:47,800
your billion dollar come.

3592
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:49,130
I just got soundbite Kroger.

3593
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:50,050
Um,

3594
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:50,170
and,

3595
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:50,910
and they kind of,

3596
01:30:50,910 --> 01:30:51,231
you know,

3597
01:30:51,231 --> 01:30:51,971
they use me for,

3598
01:30:51,971 --> 01:30:52,970
for that reason.

3599
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:55,040
I really enjoyed doing that.

3600
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:55,993
And,

3601
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:58,070
and plus you get put off of a book page

3602
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:01,700
and you don't have to get leg kicked.

3603
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:02,090
Yeah.

3604
01:31:02,090 --> 01:31:02,341
Yeah.

3605
01:31:02,341 --> 01:31:06,110
You don't have to get leg kick and hit
that nerve and do the drunken monkey.

3606
01:31:06,111 --> 01:31:06,441
Yeah.

3607
01:31:06,441 --> 01:31:08,520
You don't gotta do all
that and it's just cool.

3608
01:31:08,521 --> 01:31:10,100
It just call to kind of share the,

3609
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:10,341
the,

3610
01:31:10,341 --> 01:31:10,581
you know,

3611
01:31:10,581 --> 01:31:11,900
the whole underdog story.

3612
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:13,710
I love that people do do that.

3613
01:31:13,711 --> 01:31:14,970
The companies have the,

3614
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:15,833
the,

3615
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:20,040
the mindset of bringing in champions
and people that are extraordinary or

3616
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:20,791
whatever they do,

3617
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:22,110
and speaking to these,

3618
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:22,891
you know,

3619
01:31:22,891 --> 01:31:24,840
these people that work for
them and explaining like,

3620
01:31:24,841 --> 01:31:25,171
what did,

3621
01:31:25,171 --> 01:31:27,630
I mean that motivation is gigantic.

3622
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:32,640
Motivation is such a huge source of
fuel for people in all walks of life.

3623
01:31:33,770 --> 01:31:34,020
You know,

3624
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:37,290
to have a guy like you come in and talk
to a company could have a really big

3625
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:39,600
impact on their creativity on,

3626
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:42,090
on how they pursue goals on all kinds,

3627
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,470
all kinds of different fit things.

3628
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:44,441
Yeah.

3629
01:31:44,441 --> 01:31:44,731
So that,

3630
01:31:44,731 --> 01:31:45,070
that's,

3631
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:45,731
so anyways,

3632
01:31:45,731 --> 01:31:46,750
that's kind of where I kind of,

3633
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:48,900
I can see my life kind of heading to now.

3634
01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:50,260
I know eventually I don't think I can,

3635
01:31:50,290 --> 01:31:50,830
I don't think,

3636
01:31:50,830 --> 01:31:52,600
I think I'll always be a fan of the sport,

3637
01:31:52,601 --> 01:31:56,890
but I don't think I'll be involved in
either rustling or fighters as much as I

3638
01:31:56,891 --> 01:31:57,690
think I would

3639
01:31:57,690 --> 01:31:58,770
not as a coach.

3640
01:31:58,800 --> 01:31:59,633
Not as,

3641
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:00,260
no,

3642
01:32:00,260 --> 01:32:01,380
it's too hard Joe.

3643
01:32:01,381 --> 01:32:01,621
Like,

3644
01:32:01,621 --> 01:32:02,940
look at all these because these coaches,

3645
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:04,650
it's a two relationship.

3646
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:05,330
Yeah.

3647
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:05,500
You know,

3648
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,510
being a coach is you're,

3649
01:32:06,511 --> 01:32:07,660
you're in a relationship with,

3650
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:07,861
uh,

3651
01:32:07,861 --> 01:32:08,551
with your athletes.

3652
01:32:08,551 --> 01:32:12,240
Sometimes you go through these breakups
and sometimes the athletes don't give

3653
01:32:12,241 --> 01:32:14,010
you what they want to give
you and then it's just a,

3654
01:32:14,011 --> 01:32:15,300
it's a headache at times.

3655
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:15,630
Yeah.

3656
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:16,463
And they see that with,

3657
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:17,760
I see that with a lot of,

3658
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:18,481
you know,

3659
01:32:18,481 --> 01:32:19,800
I see that with him and I'm just like,

3660
01:32:19,801 --> 01:32:19,981
man,

3661
01:32:19,981 --> 01:32:21,830
I don't know if I want those stress level.

3662
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:24,061
Well,

3663
01:32:24,061 --> 01:32:24,360
Eric,

3664
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:25,640
for a guy like you,

3665
01:32:25,641 --> 01:32:25,920
you,

3666
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,260
you get across a guy like Henry,

3667
01:32:28,470 --> 01:32:29,700
you hit the gold mine,

3668
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:34,890
but you could get across the guy who is
a really talented guy that's a flake.

3669
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,090
And those two,

3670
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:37,260
to me personally,

3671
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:38,610
there's plenty of those.

3672
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:40,530
But to me as an analyst,

3673
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:42,060
as someone to watch his fights there,

3674
01:32:42,061 --> 01:32:45,120
the most frustrating because there's
some guys that I see and I'll go,

3675
01:32:45,121 --> 01:32:45,751
God damn,

3676
01:32:45,751 --> 01:32:46,770
that motherfucker is good.

3677
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:48,210
And he's got to potential.

3678
01:32:48,211 --> 01:32:50,190
Like they can do things
inside the octagon.

3679
01:32:50,191 --> 01:32:52,620
They do things like I'll
see guys in the gym,

3680
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,800
like I'll go to a gym and watch
guys train and see the guy and I go,

3681
01:32:55,801 --> 01:32:59,790
if this motherfucker could put it
together like this in the cage,

3682
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:02,100
the way you see when he's sparring.

3683
01:33:02,130 --> 01:33:04,290
Like some people are just artists,

3684
01:33:04,530 --> 01:33:08,260
but the anxiety of competition and,

3685
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:11,430
and all the factors that
come involve the discipline,

3686
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:12,750
the consistency,

3687
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:16,170
all the things that make someone a great
fight or sometimes there's so much,

3688
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:19,560
so many different things that make
someone a great fight or that at wind up

3689
01:33:19,561 --> 01:33:21,550
fucking them up when when they,

3690
01:33:21,551 --> 01:33:25,560
they actually go to compete though the
recklessness and impulsiveness that

3691
01:33:25,561 --> 01:33:30,561
actually makes them good also can wind
up tanking them if they don't sort of

3692
01:33:30,931 --> 01:33:31,860
forge it with,

3693
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:32,430
with,

3694
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:34,200
with some sort of like severe disease

3695
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:34,920
plan.

3696
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:35,170
Yeah.

3697
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:35,370
There,

3698
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:38,090
there has to be a
training of the mind too.

3699
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:40,380
And I think that's where
people are skipping.

3700
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:42,120
And uh,

3701
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:42,781
you know,

3702
01:33:42,781 --> 01:33:43,511
I think that's,

3703
01:33:43,511 --> 01:33:47,220
that's where you had to understand like
the philosophy appeared like you have

3704
01:33:47,221 --> 01:33:48,054
to,

3705
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:49,890
you have to be right up top.

3706
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:52,500
You have no right to
be yet to be literally,

3707
01:33:52,501 --> 01:33:55,710
you have to understand and
know who you are as a fighter,

3708
01:33:55,711 --> 01:33:56,544
as a person.

3709
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,953
And uh,

3710
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:58,321
you know,

3711
01:33:58,321 --> 01:33:59,450
to kind of,

3712
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:02,400
to be stable enough to perform at,

3713
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:02,600
uh,

3714
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:02,880
when,

3715
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,080
when it really matters,

3716
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:05,190
you know?

3717
01:34:05,190 --> 01:34:05,890
And if,

3718
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:06,691
if you don't have that,

3719
01:34:06,691 --> 01:34:09,810
you can be as talented
and as gifted as you want,

3720
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:11,000
you'll,

3721
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,180
you'll never make it.

3722
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:13,160
Yeah.

3723
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:14,400
And then we'll see those all the time.

3724
01:34:14,401 --> 01:34:15,870
Like I'd see guys in practice mad,

3725
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:18,450
they would tear me up and
they came to a competition.

3726
01:34:18,451 --> 01:34:20,550
There was just a rollover
rollover like fish.

3727
01:34:20,551 --> 01:34:21,121
It's weird,

3728
01:34:21,121 --> 01:34:21,670
right?

3729
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:21,860
Yeah.

3730
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:22,411
It's crazy.

3731
01:34:22,411 --> 01:34:22,681
I'm like,

3732
01:34:22,681 --> 01:34:23,514
Huh.

3733
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,150
Yeah.

3734
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:24,661
It's weird.

3735
01:34:24,661 --> 01:34:27,600
As you're coming up and you
see those guys and you're,

3736
01:34:27,601 --> 01:34:28,590
you realize like,

3737
01:34:28,591 --> 01:34:28,891
man,

3738
01:34:28,891 --> 01:34:29,190
there's,

3739
01:34:29,190 --> 01:34:30,930
there's something missing and then you,

3740
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:31,290
you,

3741
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:31,800
you,

3742
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:32,551
you're terrified.

3743
01:34:32,551 --> 01:34:33,780
You're going to see that in yourself.

3744
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:38,710
In ethic is the embracement of embracing
pressure is something that you don't

3745
01:34:38,711 --> 01:34:42,190
neglect or sometimes she don't shy away
from something that you don't allow them

3746
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:43,270
to damage you,

3747
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:44,680
but it's an embracement.

3748
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:45,000
It's a,

3749
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,670
it's just like,

3750
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:45,911
hey,

3751
01:34:45,911 --> 01:34:46,541
bring it man.

3752
01:34:46,541 --> 01:34:46,901
Bring me,

3753
01:34:46,901 --> 01:34:47,800
cause that's what it is,

3754
01:34:47,801 --> 01:34:48,050
Joe.

3755
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:49,570
It's the pressure that people feel,

3756
01:34:49,571 --> 01:34:50,860
the reason why they can't perform.

3757
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:52,080
It's what makes champions.

3758
01:34:52,081 --> 01:34:55,540
I remember when Tj Dillashaw
first fought Hanan Barao um,

3759
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:56,910
when he got into that octagon,

3760
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:58,340
he looked like he was born,

3761
01:34:58,520 --> 01:34:59,810
he was loose as a goose.

3762
01:35:00,110 --> 01:35:00,621
And I,

3763
01:35:00,621 --> 01:35:01,251
and I saw him,

3764
01:35:01,251 --> 01:35:01,611
I'm like,

3765
01:35:01,611 --> 01:35:01,971
Damn,

3766
01:35:01,971 --> 01:35:03,470
look how loose TJ is.

3767
01:35:03,471 --> 01:35:05,060
Like this is a world title fight.

3768
01:35:05,290 --> 01:35:08,900
And he's switching stances and giving
them looks and he looks fantastic.

3769
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:10,970
He just looked loose and then boom,

3770
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,840
he hits him with that big overhand right.

3771
01:35:12,841 --> 01:35:13,491
And next thing you know,

3772
01:35:13,491 --> 01:35:15,230
Henry Morales getting fucked up.

3773
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:15,901
I mean,

3774
01:35:15,901 --> 01:35:18,860
and that was what TJ thrives on.

3775
01:35:18,861 --> 01:35:19,641
That kind of pressure.

3776
01:35:19,641 --> 01:35:22,250
He lives for that kind of
pressure just like you do,

3777
01:35:22,420 --> 01:35:23,530
which is why I want to,

3778
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:24,433
yeah,

3779
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:26,581
let's do it.

3780
01:35:26,581 --> 01:35:27,980
I want his head on the,

3781
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,290
I want to say I went
to his head on a spike.

3782
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:33,570
I wanna I wanna make,

3783
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:35,580
I wanna make some snake shoes out of

3784
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:40,190
snakeskin snake skin shoes,

3785
01:35:40,191 --> 01:35:41,080
navy suit.

3786
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:42,590
I think he might be big enough for me.

3787
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,650
You know what a fight that
would be for fans too.

3788
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:49,370
I mean it's those champion versus champion
encounters are always so fantastic.

3789
01:35:49,371 --> 01:35:49,501
No,

3790
01:35:49,501 --> 01:35:52,700
and the reason why it's cool too is
because we're both in our prime to like,

3791
01:35:52,701 --> 01:35:54,230
Tj is probably a couple
of years older than me.

3792
01:35:54,231 --> 01:35:55,670
But even when like the matress like dude,

3793
01:35:55,671 --> 01:35:56,990
I'd be Demetrius in his prime.

3794
01:35:56,991 --> 01:35:57,411
Like yeah,

3795
01:35:57,411 --> 01:35:58,370
it was a close fight.

3796
01:35:59,450 --> 01:35:59,910
But man,

3797
01:35:59,910 --> 01:36:00,621
I can say,

3798
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:00,991
did I,

3799
01:36:00,991 --> 01:36:02,960
I beat him in his prime in this prime.

3800
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:04,400
It's almost like there's no doubt.

3801
01:36:04,401 --> 01:36:04,791
But it was,

3802
01:36:04,791 --> 01:36:06,110
it was because of the game plan.

3803
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:09,680
And then you ended the greatest winning
streak in the history of the sport.

3804
01:36:10,140 --> 01:36:10,750
Right.

3805
01:36:10,750 --> 01:36:11,420
You know what I mean?

3806
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:14,810
Rich Championship defense streak
in the history of the sport.

3807
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:15,710
And then on top,

3808
01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:16,910
I mean number good.

3809
01:36:16,911 --> 01:36:19,190
Madoff has the greatest winning
streak in the sport because he's,

3810
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:19,420
you know,

3811
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:20,390
still undefeated.

3812
01:36:20,391 --> 01:36:22,790
But as far as defending the title,

3813
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:23,930
Dj was number one.

3814
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:25,250
And again,

3815
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,900
you did it to him in his prime.

3816
01:36:26,901 --> 01:36:29,180
If you look at the way he
destroyed Wilson Hayes,

3817
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:30,320
if you look at like,

3818
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:33,620
I mean fucking give it just everybody.

3819
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:34,454
Man,

3820
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:35,960
everybody just,

3821
01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:36,880
he's a monster,

3822
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:37,580
a Borg,

3823
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:38,670
the greatest submission.

3824
01:36:38,671 --> 01:36:41,540
And that was his three shit of all time.

3825
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:45,530
We fucking suplexes him and it
catches an arm bar on the way down.

3826
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:47,210
Get the fuck Outta here.

3827
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:49,160
They told me he does that
and training all the time.

3828
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:50,581
Yeah.

3829
01:36:50,581 --> 01:36:52,400
Matt Hume is a wizard a,

3830
01:36:52,401 --> 01:36:52,800
where's it?

3831
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,550
One of the things that I did
that was kind of unconventional,

3832
01:36:55,860 --> 01:36:57,210
unconventional for this camp.

3833
01:36:57,211 --> 01:36:59,010
I had them video at it.

3834
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:01,860
We obviously we scouted Demetrius Johnson,

3835
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:06,000
but then I went back and got every
one minute clip of Matt Hume's,

3836
01:37:06,310 --> 01:37:07,143
uh,

3837
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:07,740
uh,

3838
01:37:07,740 --> 01:37:09,300
interval between rounds.

3839
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:11,130
So 25 fights.

3840
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:15,450
I have the one minute what he tells
him how he adapts and changes.

3841
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:19,440
And one of the things I noticed is that
he always went to wrestling and he went,

3842
01:37:19,441 --> 01:37:20,490
he always went to wrestling.

3843
01:37:20,491 --> 01:37:21,960
He sounded like it was automatic.

3844
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:22,591
All right,

3845
01:37:22,591 --> 01:37:24,480
so this round we're going to take
him down and we're going to work.

3846
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:27,600
It was always automatic and when
it went into the fifth round,

3847
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:29,250
it wasn't automatic.

3848
01:37:29,251 --> 01:37:30,330
You can hear him say,

3849
01:37:31,050 --> 01:37:32,970
you could try to take
them down if you want.

3850
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:34,080
It was kind of like that,

3851
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:34,950
the way he said it.

3852
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,230
And when I went back and
watched and I was like,

3853
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:38,213
we got him.

3854
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:38,671
And,

3855
01:37:38,671 --> 01:37:38,790
uh,

3856
01:37:38,790 --> 01:37:40,350
going into that fifth round,

3857
01:37:40,890 --> 01:37:44,100
one of the things that we talked
about subliminally and mentally,

3858
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:44,730
uh,

3859
01:37:44,730 --> 01:37:46,980
training was when we went,

3860
01:37:46,981 --> 01:37:48,750
Henry was just putting the hall of fame,

3861
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:49,241
you know,

3862
01:37:49,241 --> 01:37:49,470
he,

3863
01:37:49,470 --> 01:37:52,980
which has never been done at
such a young age as a wrestler,

3864
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:53,903
as a wrestler.

3865
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:56,280
And when was at the
wrestling hall of fame,

3866
01:37:56,281 --> 01:37:56,950
Nate car,

3867
01:37:56,950 --> 01:37:59,580
who's also one of the
greatest Russell's ever,

3868
01:37:59,581 --> 01:38:00,414
he told me,

3869
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:01,021
he said,

3870
01:38:01,021 --> 01:38:01,501
you know what,

3871
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:02,334
Eric,

3872
01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:06,150
when I wrestled Kenny Monday
and I lost him in the big tents,

3873
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:11,070
I knew that when I went out two weeks
later to fight him in the Ncaa finals,

3874
01:38:11,370 --> 01:38:13,470
that it might come up that,

3875
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:14,220
that,

3876
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:14,731
that band,

3877
01:38:14,731 --> 01:38:15,780
this guy just beat me.

3878
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:16,681
And he goes,

3879
01:38:16,681 --> 01:38:17,580
so I had a book,

3880
01:38:17,581 --> 01:38:17,821
actually,

3881
01:38:17,821 --> 01:38:19,470
I think he said his wife made his book.

3882
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:20,431
Uh,

3883
01:38:20,431 --> 01:38:22,760
and he put all the positive things that,

3884
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:23,401
that,

3885
01:38:23,401 --> 01:38:23,820
um,

3886
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:25,980
made car had done and all the articles,

3887
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:28,530
and she made quotes from
that and put it in this book.

3888
01:38:28,830 --> 01:38:31,080
So he gave me that idea
and then I did that.

3889
01:38:31,081 --> 01:38:33,780
So when Henry was putting in
the hall of fame that night,

3890
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:35,100
they had a video highlights.

3891
01:38:35,101 --> 01:38:36,720
It had Terry brands is coach.

3892
01:38:36,990 --> 01:38:38,280
They had a circuit.

3893
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:38,690
Bella,

3894
01:38:38,690 --> 01:38:39,360
I've Kenny,

3895
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:40,290
Kevin Jackson,

3896
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:41,520
some of the greatest,

3897
01:38:41,730 --> 01:38:46,320
all his coaches saying stuff about him
when I took that and I put it in his book

3898
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:51,000
and it kind of like when I read it
to him every day and they kind like,

3899
01:38:51,001 --> 01:38:51,780
uh,

3900
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:52,770
happened in the fight.

3901
01:38:52,771 --> 01:38:54,360
One of the pieces are
own quotes would said,

3902
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:57,150
I've got to go in there and
kill and be ready to die.

3903
01:38:57,600 --> 01:38:57,990
And,

3904
01:38:57,990 --> 01:38:58,411
and you know,

3905
01:38:58,411 --> 01:39:00,570
when he got that leg injury,

3906
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:01,231
you know,

3907
01:39:01,231 --> 01:39:02,190
he was ready to die.

3908
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:03,690
He was ready to keep going forward.

3909
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:04,201
Yes,

3910
01:39:04,201 --> 01:39:06,120
we adapted and it went south pole.

3911
01:39:06,121 --> 01:39:06,870
But I'll,

3912
01:39:06,870 --> 01:39:09,720
some of that stuff from
the book came exactly true.

3913
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:11,330
Start fast and,

3914
01:39:11,470 --> 01:39:12,930
and finish even stronger,

3915
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:16,140
compete with passion and a purpose.

3916
01:39:16,141 --> 01:39:21,090
And this was when I said to him right
here and the fifth day to show you this

3917
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:22,681
does,

3918
01:39:22,681 --> 01:39:24,960
this is what I told him
going into the fifth round,

3919
01:39:24,990 --> 01:39:25,470
uh,

3920
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:26,310
when we was forward,

3921
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:27,380
let's see the two,

3922
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:28,820
let's see that's here.

3923
01:39:29,190 --> 01:39:29,581
Shit,

3924
01:39:29,581 --> 01:39:31,290
let me say as said less throw Henry,

3925
01:39:31,530 --> 01:39:32,640
burn the ships,

3926
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:34,440
take the fucking castle,

3927
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:36,090
let's take him down.

3928
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:37,890
Hurt him on the ground.

3929
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,030
If he gets back up,

3930
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:40,290
knock cause it has out.

3931
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:42,670
And that's what I told him
going into the fifth round,

3932
01:39:42,671 --> 01:39:43,504
the Shaker.

3933
01:39:44,240 --> 01:39:44,460
We,

3934
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:46,110
I've actually only had one or two,

3935
01:39:46,111 --> 01:39:47,760
but we should say the Messenger.

3936
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:48,571
So,

3937
01:39:48,571 --> 01:39:49,080
uh,

3938
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:49,441
you know,

3939
01:39:49,441 --> 01:39:50,220
it's just uh,

3940
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:53,670
something that I was
ingrained into them every uh,

3941
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:54,810
every sparring session.

3942
01:39:54,810 --> 01:39:56,280
I had something set for him.

3943
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:59,910
But this time going into
the fifth round against Dj,

3944
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:03,720
I wasn't sure if it was two to
two or if he needed a knockout.

3945
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:04,583
Did you feel,

3946
01:40:05,190 --> 01:40:06,180
I thought it was two to two.

3947
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:07,890
I thought it was two to two.

3948
01:40:07,891 --> 01:40:08,371
And I think,

3949
01:40:08,371 --> 01:40:08,880
I think,

3950
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,730
I think Dj from the
interviews that I've heard,

3951
01:40:11,731 --> 01:40:13,770
I think he felt like it was too
to going into the fifth year.

3952
01:40:13,771 --> 01:40:16,280
We thought it was too too when we
were watching the football boy.

3953
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:16,560
Damn,

3954
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:17,970
this is as close as it gets.

3955
01:40:18,020 --> 01:40:18,670
Which makes,

3956
01:40:18,670 --> 01:40:18,870
yeah.

3957
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:19,261
And again,

3958
01:40:19,261 --> 01:40:19,471
Joe,

3959
01:40:19,471 --> 01:40:19,890
I wouldn't,

3960
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:20,251
I wouldn't,

3961
01:40:20,251 --> 01:40:20,931
like I said,

3962
01:40:20,931 --> 01:40:21,220
I,

3963
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:22,930
I it because it was such a close fight.

3964
01:40:22,931 --> 01:40:23,230
Dude.

3965
01:40:23,230 --> 01:40:23,860
I,

3966
01:40:23,860 --> 01:40:25,720
I had a clap for Demetrius too.

3967
01:40:25,721 --> 01:40:27,070
If they would've gave
them though the fight.

3968
01:40:27,330 --> 01:40:28,830
I know it was close,

3969
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:29,723
you know?

3970
01:40:29,910 --> 01:40:30,480
Um,

3971
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,470
what did you weigh?

3972
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:33,180
I was actually,

3973
01:40:33,181 --> 01:40:34,770
I was actually a pound lighter than,

3974
01:40:34,790 --> 01:40:35,070
uh,

3975
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:36,090
than the beaches.

3976
01:40:36,091 --> 01:40:36,930
I don't know if she knew it.

3977
01:40:36,931 --> 01:40:37,411
Yeah,

3978
01:40:37,411 --> 01:40:38,244
you look bigger.

3979
01:40:38,610 --> 01:40:39,210
Yeah,

3980
01:40:39,210 --> 01:40:39,870
it really did.

3981
01:40:39,870 --> 01:40:40,651
But that's again,

3982
01:40:40,651 --> 01:40:40,970
that's,

3983
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:43,290
that's kind of just one
that's kind of where they,

3984
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:45,180
the way they placed like my muscle,

3985
01:40:45,181 --> 01:40:46,014
like it was a,

3986
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:48,540
that's why I look bigger,

3987
01:40:48,541 --> 01:40:50,660
but not always a pound lighter
than Demetrius Johnson.

3988
01:40:50,661 --> 01:40:51,271
Didn't you wear at night?

3989
01:40:51,271 --> 01:40:52,200
That one 41.

3990
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:53,740
Oh Wow.

3991
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,311
This kid's,

3992
01:40:54,311 --> 01:40:55,380
when you sigh,

3993
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:58,320
you guys standing together in the octagon,

3994
01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:00,780
you really did look bigger
than him is really interesting.

3995
01:41:00,870 --> 01:41:01,703
Yeah.

3996
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:02,071
Yeah,

3997
01:41:02,071 --> 01:41:02,731
so I'm not,

3998
01:41:02,731 --> 01:41:03,091
I was,

3999
01:41:03,091 --> 01:41:05,680
I was letting Demetrius people if I die

4000
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:07,870
and he kept on saying,

4001
01:41:07,871 --> 01:41:08,710
he said it twice.

4002
01:41:08,711 --> 01:41:09,371
He's so big.

4003
01:41:09,371 --> 01:41:10,204
He's so strong.

4004
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:12,310
He said it twice in this post interview,

4005
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:13,780
but that's wrestling strength,

4006
01:41:14,050 --> 01:41:14,440
right?

4007
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:15,150
Wrestling's traits.

4008
01:41:15,150 --> 01:41:16,540
It's just a different kind of strength.

4009
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:17,020
Where did it,

4010
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:19,690
sometimes it's just not even
his strengths and leverage.

4011
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:20,990
Learn how to use,

4012
01:41:20,991 --> 01:41:21,290
how to,

4013
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:23,900
how to tippy toe things and
how to use your weight to,

4014
01:41:24,230 --> 01:41:26,150
to pressure opponent or to take them down

4015
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,233
two for sure,

4016
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:31,210
but there's also strength
strength that wrestlers have.

4017
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:33,280
Anybody's ever roll with a or knows that.

4018
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:34,050
Yeah,

4019
01:41:34,050 --> 01:41:34,311
I guess.

4020
01:41:34,311 --> 01:41:34,530
Sure.

4021
01:41:34,530 --> 01:41:38,230
I get to see the transformation
that he had from the eight weeks,

4022
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:39,500
from the beginning to the aunt Ma.

4023
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:40,540
There's a documentary.

4024
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:43,700
These guys filmed the whole entire
thing and you guys are amazing.

4025
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:45,090
You're putting the documentary on.

4026
01:41:45,140 --> 01:41:45,291
Yeah,

4027
01:41:45,291 --> 01:41:45,831
we're going to put it,

4028
01:41:45,831 --> 01:41:45,950
yeah.

4029
01:41:45,950 --> 01:41:47,510
I think we're going to put
it off sometime in the,

4030
01:41:47,511 --> 01:41:48,560
I think in the spring,

4031
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:49,890
but it's going to come
out in the beginning.

4032
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:50,570
It's going to be,

4033
01:41:50,570 --> 01:41:51,210
it's going to be not,

4034
01:41:51,210 --> 01:41:53,180
I think we're going to
try to pitch it to a,

4035
01:41:53,270 --> 01:41:54,103
to Netflix.

4036
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:54,973
Nice.

4037
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:55,920
Yeah.

4038
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,550
He holds across the Messenger.

4039
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:58,743
Yeah.

4040
01:41:58,890 --> 01:41:59,500
The lesson.

4041
01:41:59,500 --> 01:42:00,221
And they'll forget,

4042
01:42:00,221 --> 01:42:00,880
uh,

4043
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:02,800
as not only was he fighting for the title,

4044
01:42:02,801 --> 01:42:06,190
this guy was fighting for his life only
eight months before in the Santa Rosa

4045
01:42:06,191 --> 01:42:06,820
fires.

4046
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:08,640
So his story is very inspirational.

4047
01:42:08,641 --> 01:42:10,930
That's a crazy fucking
story in and of itself.

4048
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:13,060
You actually burn the
bottom of your feet running,

4049
01:42:13,061 --> 01:42:15,250
escaping a fire that snuck up on you.

4050
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:16,510
Like lightning speed,

4051
01:42:16,511 --> 01:42:16,840
Huh?

4052
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:17,130
Yeah,

4053
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:17,621
it was,

4054
01:42:17,621 --> 01:42:18,110
it was a,

4055
01:42:18,110 --> 01:42:21,640
it was the craziest thing that's probably
ever happened to me and I've done some

4056
01:42:21,641 --> 01:42:22,510
crazy things.

4057
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:22,661
Yeah.

4058
01:42:22,661 --> 01:42:25,060
They documented it in the UFC pre show,

4059
01:42:25,090 --> 01:42:29,140
like they showed like all the damage
to the area where you were living.

4060
01:42:29,141 --> 01:42:31,000
It's fucking terrifying.

4061
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:31,351
Yeah.

4062
01:42:31,351 --> 01:42:32,041
It was crazy.

4063
01:42:32,041 --> 01:42:32,311
I,

4064
01:42:32,311 --> 01:42:33,140
uh,

4065
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:33,810
at anyways,

4066
01:42:33,810 --> 01:42:34,320
I mean,

4067
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:34,651
I guess,

4068
01:42:34,651 --> 01:42:35,011
I guess,

4069
01:42:35,011 --> 01:42:37,320
I guess this is where people
kind of share their stories,

4070
01:42:37,321 --> 01:42:38,154
right.

4071
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:38,611
But it's,

4072
01:42:38,611 --> 01:42:39,444
ah,

4073
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:40,011
yes.

4074
01:42:40,011 --> 01:42:41,580
So this was about a year ago now,

4075
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:42,420
so this was,

4076
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:42,690
yeah,

4077
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:43,740
about a year ago now.

4078
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:46,440
And I got invited to this event with a,

4079
01:42:46,441 --> 01:42:46,711
you know,

4080
01:42:46,711 --> 01:42:47,071
raising,

4081
01:42:47,071 --> 01:42:47,400
raising,

4082
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,750
raising money for kids in cancer.

4083
01:42:48,751 --> 01:42:49,680
And everybody in there,

4084
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:50,370
every,

4085
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:52,650
every big celebrity gets
invited like cherry your rise,

4086
01:42:52,651 --> 01:42:53,431
like Barry bonds,

4087
01:42:53,431 --> 01:42:53,910
like the,

4088
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:54,391
like the,

4089
01:42:54,391 --> 01:42:55,380
the big aid list,

4090
01:42:55,381 --> 01:42:59,160
celebrities and everybody was there and
that we had a fundraiser that night and

4091
01:42:59,161 --> 01:42:59,431
you know,

4092
01:42:59,431 --> 01:43:00,600
wine country in Santa Rosa,

4093
01:43:00,601 --> 01:43:01,434
California,

4094
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:02,190
you know,

4095
01:43:02,190 --> 01:43:02,780
and everybody knew.

4096
01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:04,190
Everybody had their drinks and whatnot.

4097
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:04,381
You know,

4098
01:43:04,381 --> 01:43:04,681
I had,

4099
01:43:04,681 --> 01:43:05,760
I had a couple of glasses,

4100
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:06,960
maybe had a few glasses of wine,

4101
01:43:06,961 --> 01:43:07,231
but I don't,

4102
01:43:07,231 --> 01:43:08,064
I don't drink wine,

4103
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,230
but I had a few glasses
and I remember I told her,

4104
01:43:10,231 --> 01:43:10,531
but hey,

4105
01:43:10,531 --> 01:43:11,520
I'm going to sleep guys.

4106
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:13,050
And it was close to about midnight.

4107
01:43:13,110 --> 01:43:13,381
I was like,

4108
01:43:13,381 --> 01:43:15,710
I ain't trying to stay up with
these people and I'm trying,

4109
01:43:15,730 --> 01:43:16,830
I'm trying to sleep cause I was,

4110
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:17,940
I never drink wine.

4111
01:43:18,510 --> 01:43:20,040
So I go to my room and uh,

4112
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:21,550
and then I shower,

4113
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:22,590
get into bed and,

4114
01:43:23,430 --> 01:43:24,263
and uh,

4115
01:43:24,390 --> 01:43:25,650
I remember right before I went to bed,

4116
01:43:25,651 --> 01:43:28,770
I remember I saw like the
flickering of lights and I just,

4117
01:43:28,771 --> 01:43:29,610
I got that it was weird.

4118
01:43:29,611 --> 01:43:31,070
This is roughly about time.

4119
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:31,890
I got to my hotel,

4120
01:43:31,890 --> 01:43:32,290
I shout,

4121
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:33,410
I saw the flicker of light side.

4122
01:43:33,411 --> 01:43:34,380
I didn't think anything of it.

4123
01:43:35,700 --> 01:43:36,311
And uh,

4124
01:43:36,311 --> 01:43:36,720
I,

4125
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:38,280
I pass out to 30 hits,

4126
01:43:38,281 --> 01:43:39,114
two 30 in the morning,

4127
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:39,420
head to,

4128
01:43:39,420 --> 01:43:39,931
and I'm just,

4129
01:43:39,931 --> 01:43:40,764
uh,

4130
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:41,881
I'm just,

4131
01:43:41,881 --> 01:43:42,570
you know,

4132
01:43:42,570 --> 01:43:44,070
I wake up because I hear the alarm,

4133
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:44,490
you know,

4134
01:43:44,490 --> 01:43:45,720
kind of pop off at the,

4135
01:43:45,721 --> 01:43:46,560
at the hotel.

4136
01:43:46,890 --> 01:43:49,320
So now I'm hearing these alarms
starting to go off and I've,

4137
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:49,921
you know,

4138
01:43:49,921 --> 01:43:50,491
I checked out,

4139
01:43:50,491 --> 01:43:51,324
I checked out on,

4140
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:51,910
I checked out,

4141
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:52,250
uh,

4142
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:54,110
through the window and
I checked out the lobby.

4143
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:54,711
Nobody was moving.

4144
01:43:54,711 --> 01:43:55,131
So I was like,

4145
01:43:55,131 --> 01:43:56,030
it's a false alarm.

4146
01:43:56,690 --> 01:43:57,501
So I grabbed the pillow,

4147
01:43:57,501 --> 01:43:59,660
put over my head and every
can slept to the alarm.

4148
01:44:00,330 --> 01:44:01,850
That happened about two 30.

4149
01:44:01,851 --> 01:44:03,590
Now four 30 comes about.

4150
01:44:03,591 --> 01:44:04,600
And this time I don't wake up.

4151
01:44:04,620 --> 01:44:05,840
I don't wake up because the alarm,

4152
01:44:05,841 --> 01:44:09,130
I wake up because of the
smoke and my coffee and I'm,

4153
01:44:09,190 --> 01:44:10,730
I'm like coffee on the small and efforts.

4154
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:11,690
I thought I was dreaming.

4155
01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:13,430
So I wake up and I,

4156
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:14,360
at that time I had,

4157
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:14,811
I had,

4158
01:44:14,811 --> 01:44:15,100
uh,

4159
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:15,410
you know,

4160
01:44:15,410 --> 01:44:16,340
I slept in my town.

4161
01:44:16,341 --> 01:44:20,270
That's how tired I was and I got up and
I'm going to turn the lights and the

4162
01:44:20,271 --> 01:44:24,030
light tank turning down and then I go
through the window and a check the window

4163
01:44:24,031 --> 01:44:24,281
and next,

4164
01:44:24,281 --> 01:44:24,531
you know,

4165
01:44:24,531 --> 01:44:27,020
and I see the car right
in front of me on fire.

4166
01:44:27,490 --> 01:44:27,760
Uh,

4167
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:29,000
three fourths of the hotels,

4168
01:44:29,001 --> 01:44:31,760
like I was probably about five rooms
away from like getting hit hard.

4169
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:32,660
Like I'm talking about like,

4170
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:35,810
like fire coming out the
window and like that.

4171
01:44:35,811 --> 01:44:36,950
And I'm waking up to this,

4172
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:38,630
like thinking I'm dreaming,

4173
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:39,261
you know,

4174
01:44:39,261 --> 01:44:40,100
in a towel.

4175
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:41,533
And then the lights,

4176
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:42,440
everything was dark,

4177
01:44:42,441 --> 01:44:43,550
but I could see everything like it.

4178
01:44:43,551 --> 01:44:46,310
Like the room started
getting hot and I couldn't,

4179
01:44:46,311 --> 01:44:49,010
I couldn't hold my breath the more
I started looking for my shoes.

4180
01:44:49,011 --> 01:44:52,250
I couldn't find my shoes and I bumped
into my slacks that I left them on the

4181
01:44:52,251 --> 01:44:55,610
ironing board that the night
before and I put them on and I,

4182
01:44:55,611 --> 01:44:56,150
I grabbed,

4183
01:44:56,150 --> 01:44:57,140
I grabbed the,

4184
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,600
I grabbed my phone and
I jumped out the window.

4185
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:03,230
I jumped out the ones that jumped out
the wound on my right foot catches on

4186
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:04,064
fire.

4187
01:45:04,640 --> 01:45:05,001
All right.

4188
01:45:05,001 --> 01:45:07,100
Foot catches on fire fast
and I'm looking to kind of,

4189
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:08,753
I'm Kinda,

4190
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:09,231
you know,

4191
01:45:09,231 --> 01:45:13,010
trying to put it out and it's crazy how
I can see how people could catch on fire

4192
01:45:13,011 --> 01:45:13,850
real quick.

4193
01:45:14,290 --> 01:45:14,640
Cause my,

4194
01:45:14,640 --> 01:45:15,980
my right leg was like food.

4195
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:17,553
It was crazy.

4196
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:18,530
Wow.

4197
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:21,650
So I jumped out and I started walking
as I'm walking them seeing like this,

4198
01:45:21,680 --> 01:45:25,220
the hotel in front of us was all in
sticks to like the whole thing was just in

4199
01:45:25,221 --> 01:45:26,054
sticks.

4200
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:28,430
Like the fire had just ate that thing up.

4201
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:30,440
There's a building in front of me on,

4202
01:45:30,441 --> 01:45:31,131
on fire.

4203
01:45:31,131 --> 01:45:31,281
Like,

4204
01:45:31,281 --> 01:45:32,450
I'm just walking through the streets,

4205
01:45:32,451 --> 01:45:33,860
going up the hill and just thinking like,

4206
01:45:33,861 --> 01:45:36,230
God give me a horrible way to die.

4207
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:38,090
Horrible way to die.

4208
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:39,193
Fuck.

4209
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:39,891
And I got to,

4210
01:45:39,891 --> 01:45:42,050
I got a bird's eye view
when I was on top of the,

4211
01:45:42,051 --> 01:45:42,680
uh,

4212
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:43,880
when I was on top of the hill.

4213
01:45:44,450 --> 01:45:46,400
And then I saw there as a cop down there,

4214
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:47,780
there's a cop down,

4215
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:48,120
uh,

4216
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:49,060
and in the middle of the free ones,

4217
01:45:49,061 --> 01:45:51,080
just like we know that's
where I got to go.

4218
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:54,860
So now I'm running fast and I've seen
that this brush fire kind of come along

4219
01:45:54,861 --> 01:45:55,190
and just,

4220
01:45:55,190 --> 01:45:56,600
I'm seeing like California,

4221
01:45:56,601 --> 01:45:57,770
like just catch on fire,

4222
01:45:57,771 --> 01:45:59,990
like completely like through my eyes.

4223
01:46:00,890 --> 01:46:03,230
I jump over the first fence
to get to the freeway,

4224
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:03,531
you know,

4225
01:46:03,531 --> 01:46:04,220
no problem.

4226
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:06,890
I jump over the second fence
and then the third fence,

4227
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:07,521
it was a,

4228
01:46:07,521 --> 01:46:09,020
it was a very like a flimsy,

4229
01:46:09,021 --> 01:46:10,790
a kind of fence.

4230
01:46:11,270 --> 01:46:11,841
And I remember I,

4231
01:46:11,841 --> 01:46:12,440
as I,

4232
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:14,150
as I jumped out in British snag,

4233
01:46:14,151 --> 01:46:15,050
like part of my snacks,

4234
01:46:15,051 --> 01:46:15,621
I keep in mind,

4235
01:46:15,621 --> 01:46:16,280
I was,

4236
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:16,850
I had,

4237
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:18,200
the only thing I had on was slacks.

4238
01:46:18,201 --> 01:46:20,810
I W I got what's commando slacks,

4239
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:22,123
no shirt,

4240
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:23,240
no shoes,

4241
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:25,160
like out in the cold in California.

4242
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:26,271
And as I,

4243
01:46:26,271 --> 01:46:27,640
that flimsy fence as a,

4244
01:46:27,641 --> 01:46:29,030
as I jumped out that last fence,

4245
01:46:29,031 --> 01:46:31,820
it like cut it like a part of the fence.

4246
01:46:31,821 --> 01:46:33,170
I grabbed my butt and it just,

4247
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,810
it cut me open heart and a tour,

4248
01:46:35,811 --> 01:46:36,900
like half the leg.

4249
01:46:36,901 --> 01:46:38,530
So now I'm full,

4250
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:42,360
I'm full of smoke and my
right foot is burned and uh,

4251
01:46:42,361 --> 01:46:42,710
um,

4252
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:46,060
I'm pretty much half
naked it with a for you.

4253
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:52,050
So I see the cop car and I go up to
the cop car and as I'm going up to it,

4254
01:46:52,051 --> 01:46:52,471
I'm sorry,

4255
01:46:52,471 --> 01:46:56,760
the freaking cop car leaves like
fucking just scrambles and just like,

4256
01:46:56,790 --> 01:46:57,840
oh my God.

4257
01:46:58,190 --> 01:46:59,820
In as soon as that cop car left,

4258
01:46:59,850 --> 01:47:00,300
uh,

4259
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:02,410
I remember seeing like this big as diesel,

4260
01:47:02,430 --> 01:47:05,950
like coming towards me and ever get into
the middle of the freeway and Kinda,

4261
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:06,391
you know,

4262
01:47:06,391 --> 01:47:07,320
waving my hands,

4263
01:47:07,321 --> 01:47:07,570

4264
01:47:07,570 --> 01:47:08,110

And uh,

4269
01:47:12,751 --> 01:47:13,570
as it got closer,

4270
01:47:13,570 --> 01:47:15,760
so it was a fire truck and I,

4271
01:47:15,770 --> 01:47:16,680
and I get rescued.

4272
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:18,300
I get rescued by the fireman.

4273
01:47:19,190 --> 01:47:21,540
They put me in the fire truck and
they're just kinda like looking at him.

4274
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:21,781
He's like,

4275
01:47:21,781 --> 01:47:22,051

You just survived deck.

Because I was black dude.

4280

I said,

4281
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:29,250
I already smelled like a marshmallow.

4282
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:30,660
Did anybody die in the hotel?

4283
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:33,200
50 50 50 people died in a,

4284
01:47:34,790 --> 01:47:35,090

the whole time.

4286
01:47:36,270 --> 01:47:38,250
I'm not sure if anybody died at the hotel.

4287
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:38,970
I hope not.

4288
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:42,150
But I could see how 50 people died in the,

4289
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:42,480
yeah,

4290
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:42,720
it was,

4291
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,381
it was a worst.

4292
01:47:43,381 --> 01:47:43,561
No,

4293
01:47:43,561 --> 01:47:44,700
you have 50 people died.

4294
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:46,520
50 families like it was,

4295
01:47:46,521 --> 01:47:46,810
it was,

4296
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:49,080
it was sad to hear what
just happened quick.

4297
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:50,700
Those fires come so quick.

4298
01:47:50,701 --> 01:47:52,920
People don't realize it's
before it's too late.

4299
01:47:52,921 --> 01:47:54,150
And then there's no escape route.

4300
01:47:54,450 --> 01:47:55,780
And I think the reason why it's,

4301
01:47:55,781 --> 01:47:57,180
I think people have time to get out.

4302
01:47:57,181 --> 01:48:00,120
And I think the reason why 50 people
dad is because they didn't take the,

4303
01:48:00,121 --> 01:48:00,291
the,

4304
01:48:00,291 --> 01:48:02,100
the alarm like me serious.

4305
01:48:02,390 --> 01:48:04,110
And next you notice this
too late because that,

4306
01:48:04,111 --> 01:48:05,490
that smoke will blind you.

4307
01:48:06,030 --> 01:48:08,250
So you think you're going to into
the right direction and next,

4308
01:48:08,251 --> 01:48:08,461
you know,

4309
01:48:08,461 --> 01:48:10,620
you're walking into the
biggest fire in history.

4310
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:11,820
Jesus Christ.

4311
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:12,890
So,

4312
01:48:12,890 --> 01:48:16,530
so that had happened like two months
before I fought Sergio [inaudible] and I,

4313
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:16,831
and I,

4314
01:48:16,831 --> 01:48:20,120
and I still fought on like I trained
with two socks just with the,

4315
01:48:20,121 --> 01:48:20,461
with the,

4316
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:23,730
with the wrestling shoe and
I just stuck it out because,

4317
01:48:23,731 --> 01:48:24,090
uh,

4318
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:25,590
I pulled out the first fight with them.

4319
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:25,900
I says,

4320
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:26,200
I,

4321
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:27,270
I gotta make it up to you.

4322
01:48:27,271 --> 01:48:27,871
And I told him,

4323
01:48:27,871 --> 01:48:28,201
I says,

4324
01:48:28,201 --> 01:48:28,351
Hey,

4325
01:48:28,351 --> 01:48:28,860
I,

4326
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:29,151
I said,

4327
01:48:29,151 --> 01:48:29,950
I owe you want her.

4328
01:48:29,950 --> 01:48:31,050
Then he kind of called me out on it.

4329
01:48:31,051 --> 01:48:31,290
I was like,

4330
01:48:31,290 --> 01:48:31,651
Ah Dude,

4331
01:48:31,651 --> 01:48:34,410

regardless now man with,

4332
01:48:34,411 --> 01:48:34,860

4334
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:37,830

on my foot or I'm sorry,

4335
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,450

4336
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:40,733
