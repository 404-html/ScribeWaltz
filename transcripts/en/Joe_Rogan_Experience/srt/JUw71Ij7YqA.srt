1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,480
The joe rogan experience
every fucking show I do.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,070
People will yell out to every show,

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,121
every show,

4
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:11,310
but fucking if people
are yelling shit out.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,533
That's,

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:13,831
and that was,

7
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:14,790
I never even really did.

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,370
I have talked about it
on stage a few times,

9
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:18,030
but I don't know.

10
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,241
Yeah,

11
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:19,140
I heard the audio.

12
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:21,860
You talked about the time that you and
I did it where I thought you were going

13
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:22,694
to die,

14
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,360
but every fucking show,

15
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:26,880
like it was like my closing bit for years.

16
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:27,841
It was,

17
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:28,220
uh,

18
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,070
there was one of the weirdest psychedelic
situations for the folks at home.

19
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:32,460
Uh,

20
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,280
Doug and I were doing the man show
and it was like in the death throes,

21
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:35,550
right?

22
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,520
It wasn't right here we was,

23
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,110
we had to spend all night writing,

24
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:41,580
trying to save the fucking thing.

25
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:42,720
We knew it was a disaster.

26
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:43,351
We got fucked.

27
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:43,561
I mean,

28
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:43,880
look,

29
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,040
we,

30
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,550
we both appreciate the fact that everybody
was disappointed by how that show

31
00:00:47,551 --> 00:00:47,851
came out,

32
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:49,590
but no one was more
disappointed than we were.

33
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,970
The whole thing was a mess.

34
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:52,380
And when we don't need
to get into details,

35
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,243
but uh,

36
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:53,520
if you,

37
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,390
unless you want to no,

38
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:54,661
no,

39
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:55,400
no it's fine.

40
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:55,890
It's over.

41
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,990
It was terrible show but there
was some great shit in it.

42
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,500
I defy anybody to watch the uh,

43
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,940
my midget sketch.

44
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,570
You do?

45
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,403
What is it?

46
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,960
Another man's mentioned it cause your,

47
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:09,060
your sketch a defy anybody to watch
that and tell me that's not hilarious.

48
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:11,290
Where are you trying to steal
the old midget from the man show?

49
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,500
Bring him over to the
new head shot with us.

50
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,631
I mean it was a,

51
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:17,650
it was the wrong thing at the
time because our show is not,

52
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,850
the learning experience was priceless
cause that was my first real television

53
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,830
and just knowing how they fuck it up.

54
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,611
We could have,

55
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:29,370
we could have done
something on the Internet,

56
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,730
we've could have done something like
Internet style where there was no input

57
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:34,710
whatsoever and we could have
had a great fucking time.

58
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,460
Right.

59
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,360
And when,

60
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,650
when they came to me with the idea,

61
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:39,480
the idea was we're going to have nudity,

62
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,740
we'll blur it out immediately.

63
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:42,340
I'm thinking Joey d is going to be naked.

64
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,690
The beginning of every fucking show
is just telling someone about that.

65
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,110
And then,

66
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:47,970
and then I said,

67
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,110
oh,

68
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,020
and what about swears?

69
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:50,730
And they said you could
bleep it out and bleep out,

70
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,600
talk about whatever you want.

71
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,110
They go,

72
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,730
it's a good thing if we get sued,

73
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,350
this is what stone
Stanley guys telling me.

74
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,251
If we get sued,

75
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:57,120
it's a good thing.

76
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:57,721
I'm like,

77
00:01:57,721 --> 00:01:59,220
we aren't gonna Fuck Shit Up.

78
00:01:59,221 --> 00:01:59,521
I'm like,

79
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:03,150
I'm just can't wait for
abortion monologues and chaos.

80
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:04,620
And when we got in there,

81
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:05,850
it was a totally different story.

82
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,790
As soon as we got in and the audience
wouldn't have liked it any better.

83
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:09,240
No,

84
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,590
they would've still hated it,

85
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:11,760
but we wouldn't have had to fuck,

86
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:13,350
we would've had two bags on our heads.

87
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,450
We would have had to rebuild
and make a new audience.

88
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:15,870
You know there,

89
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,450
there's one point in time with John
Stewart didn't use to host the daily show.

90
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:18,780
Right.

91
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:18,990
You know,

92
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,060
people forgot there was that
other guy and it really,

93
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:22,380
we shouldn't have called it demand show.

94
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:23,340
We should have said,

95
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,470
we are really into the idea of taking
over that time slot or that idea that

96
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:31,770
doing this new [inaudible] had told
us to pound sand probably it'll fuck

97
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:32,241
ourselves.

98
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:33,020
We might know.

99
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,330
Yeah,

100
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:33,601
they were.

101
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:36,450
They were convinced that that name was
going to sell everything and that was

102
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:38,490
going to be the big push
and there's name brand.

103
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:38,701
I'm like,

104
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:38,931
it's said,

105
00:02:38,931 --> 00:02:41,580
but it's not the same Sheldon at
the same guys and not here anymore.

106
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,570
None of the writers he here,

107
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:44,290
what the fuck he documented
can you were doing fear,

108
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,180
fear factor 14 hours a
day that I got so greedy.

109
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,541
I was like,

110
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,340
I am going to have two shows at the same
time and I was just thinking it's just

111
00:02:51,341 --> 00:02:52,174
doesn't up that money.

112
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,640
I could never work again.

113
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,480
Never work in again.

114
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:55,440
I'm never working again.

115
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,890
If that was a dumb I
down terrible ideation.

116
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,160
Never do more than one television.

117
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,480
If you didn't have to work,

118
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,314
would you stop?

119
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,100
No,

120
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,721
not stop doing.

121
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:07,000
Stand up and maybe you know,

122
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,320
I liked doing the UFC too,

123
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:08,650
man.

124
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,800
It's nothing I do right now is
really work between standup.

125
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,660
I mean I can or I can regulate how many
times a year I'd go out and the UFC.

126
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:16,000
I was like,

127
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,140
I look forward to it.

128
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:17,670
It's fun.

129
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,460
So it's like,

130
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,390
what am I going to do this weekend?

131
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:22,600
I could stay at home and I can go to the
movies or I fly to Indianapolis and I

132
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:25,990
watched some dudes beat the fuck out of
each other from five feet away and I get

133
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:26,470
paid for it.

134
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,550
I get to call it does.

135
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,490
It never feels like work.

136
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,740
Google might be skynet.

137
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,280
Yup.

138
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,941
Well whatever,

139
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:31,481
you know it's,

140
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:31,651
it's,

141
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:32,471
it's inevitable.

142
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,970
I mean everybody wants it again.

143
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:34,841
Make me hard.

144
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:35,690
Ladies and gentlemen is signed.

145
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:38,890
That keeps falling for the folks that
are on iTunes that don't get to see this.

146
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,170
When Doug and I were on the Mancho,

147
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,340
I know we complained,

148
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,540
but this is,

149
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:44,650
this is pure evidence.

150
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:45,690
That was,

151
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,920
that was the best story.

152
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,080
Hard.

153
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,350
We,

154
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,540
we had a game show that we created
called make me hard and it was,

155
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,290
it was one of the best things we
did when it actually turned out.

156
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,710
And the reason why it was one of
the best things we ever did is uh,

157
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,090
because it was tranny caucus trainee cock.

158
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,630
Yeah.

159
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,251
But we,

160
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:02,881
we the,

161
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:07,810
the show's called make me hard and then
when we actually made the show and when

162
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,171
we,

163
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:08,471
you know,

164
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:10,210
talk to the comedy
central people in every,

165
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,171
they didn't like hard,

166
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:12,970
hard was too dangerous.

167
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,670
They wanted to be make me
stiff and we were like,

168
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,860
what the fuck is the
difference is the most,

169
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:22,720
this was right before we're about to
tape to art department has to rush.

170
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,570
We,

171
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:28,570
they allowed fucking full open tranny
cock open tranny cock cause we're going to

172
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:29,740
blur it out.

173
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,880
Simulated fellatio on
a banana by a midget.

174
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,551
This is what happened.

175
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:34,450
All the language.

176
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:34,781
This is,

177
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:35,614
this was the Gig,

178
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,490
there was a kid,

179
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,590
they would strap him to a chair and
they would put it this harness back up

180
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:43,300
because a lot of people
probably don't remember,

181
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:44,140
make me laugh,

182
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:48,810
was a game show where people tried not
to laugh while comics try to make other

183
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,680
guys would get in their
face and say silly things.

184
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,820
So make me hard.

185
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:52,780
We set them up.

186
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:56,920
Where would they have this box on their
package and we would decide when it lit

187
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,660
up indicating that they had an erection.

188
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,351
So we had,

189
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:02,800
so they had to try to not get
a boner during these sexual,

190
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:03,640
yeah,

191
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,780
so of course it would go off,

192
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,980
midgets would eat bananas.

193
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:09,100
It would go off and we had
this really hot tranny.

194
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,880
She was so hot that Eddie Bravo and I
were at the comedy store one night and we

195
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:15,100
were coming down and we got to park
at the high end at the comedy store.

196
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:18,060
Parking lot was full and we were coming
down the ramp and she was coming up at

197
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:18,730
eight he's going,

198
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,421
God damn,

199
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:20,254
that bitch is on.

200
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,430
But this chick coming up right now.

201
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,971
Whoa.

202
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:22,661
She's so pretty.

203
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:23,050
I go,

204
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,040
that's a dude.

205
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,300
I've seen his dick.

206
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,230
That's how hot and like
her name is vanity.

207
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:31,150
And she's totally believable.

208
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:34,030
If you ever think that you
can't get tricked by a trainee,

209
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,990
there's no way.

210
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:35,780
I wouldn't know.

211
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,910
I wouldn't know.

212
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,320
You wouldn't care.

213
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,071
She,

214
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:39,311
yeah,

215
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:40,270
she blew a dude.

216
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:43,560
We know and just did
it because Weiss twice.

217
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,010
Yeah.

218
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,370
Once on this set.

219
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:46,204
And then once,

220
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,500
and then she called him after she was at
her hotel and he went back the next day

221
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:51,190
or something.

222
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,001
He's so hot.

223
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:52,631
We're calling them her.

224
00:05:52,631 --> 00:05:52,990
She,

225
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,170
her name was vanity and
you can find her like,

226
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,350
I think it's vanity.

227
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,590
Ts you Google.

228
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,290
I've founded a short of people who'd,

229
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,243
who'd blame him?

230
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,331
So anyway,

231
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:02,571
the,

232
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:02,781
we,

233
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:03,081
the,

234
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:03,830
the guys,

235
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,490
you know,

236
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,690
strapped to this table and she
climbs all over him and he's,

237
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:08,511
he licked her tits.

238
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:09,344
Right?

239
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,611
I can't remember.

240
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:11,600
Poor fucking guy.

241
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,400
We tortured this guy's memory forever.

242
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,301
So He's,

243
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:14,751
he's like,

244
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:15,584
everyone's going,

245
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,170
yeah.

246
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:16,500
Yeah.

247
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,333
People cheering.

248
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,120
And then she pulls out this
trainee deck that looks like,

249
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,610
like a poison monkey Dick.

250
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,700
That's what it look like.

251
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,040
It looks sick.

252
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,490
He'd been hitting so many female hormones.

253
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,680
It was like an old man in a wheelchair.

254
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,713
That's what it takes.

255
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,490
And she pulled it out and it was black.

256
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,330
It was black as it functional
or is it just a bunch of snow?

257
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:38,510
No,

258
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,140
it's done.

259
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,771
It's all done.

260
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:39,951
I mean,

261
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:41,120
it's just hanging on shell,

262
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:43,010
but it feels good when you suck it still.

263
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:43,161
Right.

264
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:43,371
You know?

265
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,290
Even a soft dick feels
good if you suck it right.

266
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,130
But I don't think,

267
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:46,791
I don't think there's any,

268
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:50,240
unless she pops viagara maybe she can pop
the Agora and I still have a hard day.

269
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,833
Okay.

270
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,500
You're a fucking human being.
