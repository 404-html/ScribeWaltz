1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
Good.
Five,

[inaudible]

5
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,990
motherfucking warehouse traveler shift.
That's such a nice way to start dude.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,660
Cause you did one of the most puzzling
and fascinating and admirable things any

7
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:22,070
of my friends is ever done.
Well checked out.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,030
You checked out for four months.
Really checked out.

9
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:29,690
You got rid of your phone,
you didn't answer any emails.

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,230
You're like,
I am going to disappear for four months.

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,810
You didn't even give it time frame.
No,

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,360
he just said just,
just going to go.

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,940
Dude said one to three ish.
Um,

14
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,560
I don't know.
Maybe too,

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,670
I don't know.
Just we'll see.

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,640
Did you get the inspiration from the
Henry Rollins podcasts?

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,200
I was already going to do it.
Wow.

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,041
Yeah.
What?

19
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:52,340
He said like come see me at a December.
I think he was having shows that Largo

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:52,851
and I was like,
oh,

21
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:55,100
I'm already going to be,
I think I'll be gone by that.

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,880
Wow.
I was waiting until I finished off the

23
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:02,030
work I had to do through my special.
Right.

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,850
Um,
you know,

25
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:08,180
finish up a season that show just like,
just like get up,

26
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,980
get up.
So I'm not like just leaving every,

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,690
I'm not sure spelling anybody.
Yeah.

28
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,710
You know?
Right.

29
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,600
Chappelle.
And he played her

30
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,940
dude that rollins podcasts you did was
one of my all time favorite ones of

31
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:20,774
yours.
It's great.

32
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,510
It's Barbara Wells out there though.
Your podcast is great,

33
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,090
but it's really good.
It's really good.

34
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,740
It's one format,
the trust.

35
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:29,420
Fucking great.
It's great.

36
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,430
I love your intros.
You know,

37
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:34,190
you're sucking cooking onions and just
talking.

38
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,670
It's so raw.
It's a really good podcast,

39
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:38,141
man.
You,

40
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:41,480
you've done an amazing job with it.
But I liked your music selection.

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,340
They're not guests.
Yeah,

42
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,181
no,
you're,

43
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:47,330
do you do a great job with it?
Like whenever the guest comes up,

44
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:47,901
I was like,
okay,

45
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:50,990
what kind of fucking song is he going to
play that it was,

46
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:54,500
I just did one with him about to having
diabetes and um,

47
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,490
and uh,
he was like,

48
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,650
did you put,
pour some sugar on me at the beginning

49
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,330
of it is about diabetes.

50
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,163
Like,
yeah,

51
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,010
you gotta you gotta have something like
that goes,

52
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,810
that's hilarious.
Working grows one of the most underrated

53
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:12,710
guys out there.
I've seen him kill at the comedy store

54
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:14,690
lately.
He kills a lot enough for people.

55
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:16,640
I've always said,
can you not put me on after him?

56
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,070
Yeah.
He's one of those guys.

57
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,440
He's a funny dude.
Very funny dude.

58
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,560
Good guy too.
But um,

59
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,820
yeah,
that rollins thing.

60
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:29,060
I did see you some of that while I was
out there that when people say like,

61
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:30,710
what are you doing out here?
Yeah.

62
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,210
Um,
I tried a few times,

63
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:33,260
I'm like,
I'm here to meet you.

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,540
And it just gets a conversation going
because they want to know.

65
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:40,300
I think with him it was more his
celebrity booth.

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
It's just like you're white.
What do you,

67
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:44,460
what are you doing here?
Right.

68
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,870
What are you doing some small town in
Nowheresville.

69
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,390
Did you feel threatened anywhere?
Um,

70
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,620
any sort of threatened I,
this is a good question.

71
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,580
And He sorta like threatening I felt was
just me.

72
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,880
Um,
it wasn't real.

73
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:03,070
It was me looking at people that don't
look like me and going,

74
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,240
oh,
I'm scared.

75
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,190
You know,
there are others.

76
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,690
Hmm.
And then you find out like,

77
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,910
like me and mark is,
I mean 90 something percent Buddhist.

78
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,901
Wow.
Yeah.

79
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:17,290
It's a massive,
massive part of their culture.

80
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,190
Is that where you went first?
Yeah.

81
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,490
Why'd you pick that place?
The best weather.

82
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,430
Oh,
I got my ticket the day before,

83
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,130
so I just didn't want to go somewhere
where it's going to rewrite in.

84
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,570
Wow.
So me and my had 10 days to clear and I

85
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:33,040
was like headed to me in more I guess.
Wow.

86
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,260
Yeah,
it was great though.

87
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,480
So what do you like,
what do you do?

88
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:41,320
Like how do you set this up?
Do you set up the region?

89
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,510
A region?
Yeah,

90
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,130
it kicked out of South America and
Southeast Asia.

91
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,250
He just decided like that looks like a
good time.

92
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,160
Yeah,
exactly.

93
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,530
I would love to go to Europe.
Fucking backpack around Europe,

94
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,180
but not genuine non January and February
now.

95
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:58,900
It's not an enjoyable,
whenever I think of Europe,

96
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,850
I mean even though I've been to Europe
and I love it,

97
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:01,410
I think

98
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,210
World War II movies.
Yeah.

99
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:08,211
Them having to like the buckers freezing
food out of cans,

100
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,700
hearing bombs go off in the background,
just coming down from the ceiling.

101
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,513
Well,
you know,

102
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,310
I was thinking the other day when I was
looking at all this crazy shit that's

103
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:23,940
been going on in England,
these terrorist attacks and uh,

104
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:28,941
what happened in France and I was just
thinking how long that section of the

105
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:34,260
world has been in turmoil.
I should always fighting.

106
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,860
Always fighting.
Yeah.

107
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,050
And then I was thinking that like
America is one of the only places where

108
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:44,360
very little shit has gone down.
Like little things have gone down there.

109
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,270
There were obviously big at the time,
like Pearl Harbor is huge at the time,

110
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,400
but very few.
And then nine 11.

111
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,600
And other than that,
it's like,

112
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:52,860
Whoa,
boy.

113
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,410
What else?
And then you look at Europe,

114
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,191
like,
Holy Shit,

115
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,470
dude,
there's a part of France that's the size

116
00:04:58,471 --> 00:05:02,310
of Paris that you can't go into because
there's so many bombs.

117
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,730
There were so much munitions from the
world wars.

118
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,700
Oh really so bad that they have like a
area,

119
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:11,940
the size of parents' minds and stuff.
Just musicians.

120
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:15,660
Just fucking missiles and shit.
Things that were flying there that

121
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:19,590
landed things,
things that blew off all sorts of

122
00:05:19,591 --> 00:05:21,290
chemical waste.
Oh Dude.

123
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,700
It's toxic.
See if he could pull that up.

124
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,650
Really?
Me?

125
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,483
Yeah.
Yeah.

126
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,150
It's,
it's,

127
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:30,000
I feel like it's outside of Normandy.
I forget where it is,

128
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,080
but there's a section of,
of France that is literally the size of

129
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:38,490
Paris that people can't go into for like
a hundred thousand years.

130
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,030
Oh yeah.
Just cause it's all this like chemical

131
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:45,360
waste just because of all the waste from
the bombs and all the different fucking

132
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:48,390
missiles and rockets out guns and shit.

133
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,870
Dude.
It's crazy.

134
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,940
It's crazy.
Wow.

135
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,950
But obviously I don't have the facts in
front of me until Jamie it up and I'm my

136
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:59,150
shit.
Shitty memory.

137
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,010
But I know that this is a real place and
I know that there's leftover like wings

138
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:06,650
of plans.
I think it's mostly like things they

139
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:10,230
shot at each other and unexploded,
some of them on unexploded,

140
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,130
some of them exploded.
Like the waste from them.

141
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,050
Oh yeah.
Here it is.

142
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,750
This is a map of the space.
All these fucking bombed.

143
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:21,800
That didn't go out on the cobblestone
streets.

144
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,970
They'll get those things,
dude,

145
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,940
these are all bombs that didn't go off.
That guy's there.

146
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,590
Yeah,
with that guy knows what he's doing.

147
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,620
He's just touching it.
They pulled that one.

148
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:33,950
Ask God.
Imagine if it went off right next to the

149
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:38,951
water or water area.
It says founding contains certain toxic

150
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:41,900
levels of arsenic that were 300 times
above.

151
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,900
The tolerant tolerated amount and a
abnormally high lead levels were

152
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:51,530
recorded in some animals,
particularly in the livers of hunted.

153
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:54,260
Wild boar.
They buried it all.

154
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,570
I think it's just there,
man.

155
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,020
I think it did just have this area.
I don't think they burry.

156
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:02,750
It looks like they put it under under
mountains of dirt.

157
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,060
Is that what's going on?
And then shook.

158
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:06,590
Grew.
Does it say that?

159
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,090
No,
because mountains look like that.

160
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:13,550
I don't get up to the top.
Cool freaking no go zone of France

161
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,610
forbidden.
No Man's land poisoned by war.

162
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,220
Ooh Dude.
I mean look at that guy with the gas

163
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,920
mascot.
That is awesome.

164
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,880
Yeah,
it is up.

165
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:27,800
There was up to is.
Why does it even look a little bit so

166
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:30,380
clearly?
It's not even like it's like chalk

167
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,770
paper.
It is a dope picture.

168
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:36,050
But I was reading and looking at the
photo.

169
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,030
I was that guy in a gas mask.
Oh that's not a real picture

170
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,370
dude.
I've seen some tattoos recently.

171
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,170
People on instagram.
That's one of the best things to

172
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:48,530
instagram's for cats.
Tattoo artists.

173
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,390
There's some people that have done these
super realistic photograph tattoos that

174
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:58,391
are just flat out fucking freaky.
They can do flat out free tattoos.

175
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,220
I've seen those.
Wow.

176
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,660
Incredible.
Godly.

177
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,240
Yeah Dude.
Tattoo artists.

178
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:08,630
Like all artists I guess or just because
of the Internet,

179
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,340
but yeah.
And then they're taking things to

180
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:13,580
another level because they're seeing the
level of all these other people in like

181
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:18,350
a guy in Germany can compare itself for
the guy in Japan and the guy in America.

182
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,520
Yeah.
Like Jesus Christ.

183
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,430
God Damn Hat.
It looks like a skin is falling off.

184
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,040
Yeah,
there's a lot of fire was great.

185
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,430
Really good tattoo artists out there
right now.

186
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:33,770
Really good.
Some hot chicks getting them to,

187
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,810
yeah,
like all over the place.

188
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,150
He says,
and guys love that.

189
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,350
Uh,
I'm one of those guys.

190
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:41,960
You know why?
Cause you know she's dangerous.

191
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:46,370
That's how reckless gow Johnny Depp
tattooed on her foot.

192
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,260
You know
that girl's crazy.

193
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,190
Like girls like love and hate

194
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,001
on their hands.
Like,

195
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:58,980
okay,
here we go.

196
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,623
Yeah,
exactly.

197
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,680
It's like you're on a roller coaster
rides glen.

198
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,211
Click,
click,

199
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:05,721
click,
click,

200
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:06,261
click,
click,

201
00:09:06,261 --> 00:09:07,094
click,
click,

202
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,020
click.
And you're at the apex.

203
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,910
Yeah,
you can never just have a nice quiet

204
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,100
dinner with a girl like that.
Yeah.

205
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,260
It's got to be on every night.
Something's thrown at your head.

206
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,110
Oh girl has Los Angeles tattooed across
her stomach.

207
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,390
Whoa.
Yeah.

208
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,430
No,
in like that Gothic,

209
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,920
like a gang sign that's behind your ear.
Face tattoos is when you're really

210
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:34,170
making a commitment.
That's a weird one,

211
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:35,004
right?
That's like,

212
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:38,020
I'm willing to like some people get,
I'm a little crazy.

213
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:38,960
It was like a leave.
What types?

214
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,050
Yeah.
Well how about Gucci Mane got a fucking

215
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:46,050
ice cream cone tattooed on his face and
it says burr rarely.

216
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,680
Yes,
dude.

217
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,590
He got an ice cream cone tattooed on his
face and it says birth.

218
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,620
We are our our call
this,

219
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,390
I'm not kidding.
He's not like an ice cream guy though.

220
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,520
I like his music though,
but it's not all about ice cream.

221
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,680
Look,
God damn.

222
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,090
Wow.
It says Burr burr and then the meme

223
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:15,930
spelled [inaudible] wrong.
Does lightening bolts off the ice cream

224
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,370
cone?
I feel like that was put in later.

225
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,260
No,
I think that was the same time.

226
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,230
Ice Cream and ice and lightning.
Yeah.

227
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:23,790
Ice Cream in lightening.
That's real.

228
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,660
That's his tattoo.

229
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,080
The this case like three scoops of ice
cream.

230
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,230
Oh,
good for him.

231
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,150
It's give me a hard fight for him to
find a job though.

232
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,500
Yeah.
He doesn't have a job.

233
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,240
He's a rapper.
He doesn't need a job.

234
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,920
I mean,
okay.

235
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:41,990
I don't want to see inside of the lip on
the inside of the lip on,

236
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:43,670
it's weird.
It's like I'm going to swear right free.

237
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,201
It's that.
Yeah,

238
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:48,130
it's out of the way.
I sneaky freak my freakiness inside my

239
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:50,080
face.
There's no versions with tattoos.

240
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,150
Well,
I'm sure there must be.

241
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,310
Maybe.
I'm sure there must be,

242
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,140
but not really though.
It's not even unusual.

243
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,480
We don't think we would.
It a little bit about asexual.

244
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:01,420
People do believe in asexual people.
Oh yeah,

245
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,221
yeah,
definitely.

246
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:02,690
Right?
Yeah.

247
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,110
I've seen a couple.
Some people just don't touch,

248
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,250
don't touch me.
Thanks.

249
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,550
Sorta of thing.
That's a horrible word to stamps.

250
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,800
I have.
It's not like they just are antisocial.

251
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,480
They just don't want to play.
You have no interest in it.

252
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,070
Yeah.
So what about them?

253
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,683
Oh they,
what?

254
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,670
Did they get?
Tattoos?

255
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,600
Yeah.
I don't think it ever happens.

256
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,060
Wow.
You're a,

257
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,660
so there's a tattoo is stick to like
commit to it.

258
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,563
Yeah.
Opinion.

259
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,501
Yeah,
exactly.

260
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:29,500
Does it matter if I didn't research it?
Sure.

261
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:31,720
You're not even totally sure.
A hundred percent short man.

262
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,430
Wow.
It's just doubling down.

263
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,840
Interesting.
I like how you did that.

264
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:35,880
You've raised your voice.
Yeah.

265
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,100
There's something about movement.
Have you seen this fucking video?

266
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,460
I don't know if you know what's going on
in a evergreen college.

267
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,910
Do you know where Evergreen colleges,
evergreen state college in the north.

268
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,510
It's in Pacific northwest and there's
this crazy shut down.

269
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,010
I this professor on

270
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,960
the podcast because they,
um,

271
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,170
the kids had asked him to not show up at
school and not know why people shortage

272
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,860
because yeah,
they wanted a a day where whites didn't

273
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,350
and he's like,
that is the opposite of inclusiveness.

274
00:12:08,351 --> 00:12:10,270
Like this is,
this is not what we're supposed to be

275
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,190
doing.
So they kick him out,

276
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,170
right?
He's instead of saying,

277
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:15,460
no,
how about everybody day?

278
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,780
Well,
this is what they did.

279
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:21,010
They didn't really kick them out.
What they did is they protested,

280
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:25,570
they yelled and screamed and he felt
unsafe and he left the college and then

281
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:28,300
the college got shut down due to shut
down.

282
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:28,781
Oh,
really?

283
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:29,471
Threats.
Yeah.

284
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:32,140
People would call it in.
They even played the threats on the air.

285
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,760
What did we threats with the,
he was already gone.

286
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,920
No other people called in like threaten
the college.

287
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,230
Yes,
because like right wing people called,

288
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,720
they called them a bunch of commies.

289
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,330
The left like a voicemail saying I was
going to come,

290
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:46,660
I'm going to come down with my 45 magnum
you that's know too far.

291
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,460
Yeah.
44 magnum,

292
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,000
maybe 44.
He specified the round,

293
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:53,950
which I thought was hilarious.
Like the exact type of gun.

294
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:58,951
I have to come with a shotgun.
I know it's just a game like,

295
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,310
um,
but uh,

296
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,900
anyway,
the college professor got in trouble

297
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,470
like talking to these kids.
They told him to put his hands away

298
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,510
cause he was gesturing with their hands
and there was,

299
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,170
there were yelling out that it's a micro
aggression and they got him,

300
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,020
they got him to put his hands down and
then they started laughing at him.

301
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,410
Oh Dude.
It was like put your hands up,

302
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,880
fight,
see if he could find it.

303
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:27,960
Jeremy was,
I think his bladder aggression.

304
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:32,170
I think I,
I'm trying to figure maybe Bret

305
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,180
Weinstein had it queued up on his,
um,

306
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,980
his twitter page.

307
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,990
He's the professor.
That word by the way,

308
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:40,960
it was dead on.
It's just the connotative meaning now

309
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:43,120
it's become something super negative.
Microaggressions,

310
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,220
micro aggression,
not even a small aggression.

311
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,330
Well it's like the smallest possible
thing you can think of in terms of

312
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:50,320
aggression and you're like,
okay,

313
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,333
sure,
whatever.

314
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,950
But if you watch the video of this guy
is just moving his hands,

315
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,840
he's just talking like this and they're
like,

316
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:57,580
put your hands down at your hands are
aggressive,

317
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,950
let's do it.
And then they laugh at him when he

318
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:02,630
complies.
They openly mocked him and laugh.

319
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,550
We're fooling with it.
We didn't really believe that we turned

320
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:11,060
it into a cook there little kids,
these are little kids that you're,

321
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,220
you know,
when you talk to people who understand

322
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,310
how brains develop,
one of the big things that they always

323
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:19,930
say is the frontal lobe.

324
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,820
The frontal cortex doesn't really
develop until you're like 25 it's not

325
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:26,770
fully developed there.
They're just,

326
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,050
I was in college.
I understand.

327
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,050
Yeah,
we're not going to power.

328
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,550
We're learned a few things.
We don't know how to put it into play

329
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:36,400
yet until you just say it.
And that's by the,

330
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,170
by the way,
that's my theory and why people send

331
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,750
their kids away to college.
It's because they're fucking

332
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:43,870
embarrassing and they don't want them
anywhere near them while they're trying

333
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:46,030
to grow into real people.
Oh Wow.

334
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,610
They're learning stuff and they're like,
wait,

335
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,790
we don't have anything grow.
Think does that.

336
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,733
Oh yeah.
A little bit.

337
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,490
Also they say for the experience of
going away,

338
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,161
but like,
no,

339
00:14:53,161 --> 00:14:55,250
it's like,
hey fucking be an awful developing thing

340
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:58,760
away from me.
Go embarrass someone in Wisconsin.

341
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,600
Interesting.
Yeah.

342
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,320
Here,
this Nyu girls talking all the time.

343
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,570
I stand behind them and like listen.
Oh yeah.

344
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,490
You know the conversations,
girls and boys,

345
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,710
you know,
mostly girls you create,

346
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:10,544
I mean,
you know,

347
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,090
he creeping sort of short,
obviously super into that,

348
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,983
but like,
uh,

349
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,500
but yeah,
they're just dumb.

350
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,330
They're dumb when you listen to them and
you're like,

351
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:21,890
you're just well read and dumb.
Well,

352
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:25,600
there's a lot of people that,
I mean are 18 years old and you have

353
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,500
very intelligent conversation with them.
I'm sure.

354
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:28,334
Some,
yeah,

355
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,280
there's a lot of medicine and there's a
lot of people who are 18 who are

356
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:34,880
basically 12.
They're basically like a grownup baby.

357
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,340
It's not their fault.
It's no one's fault,

358
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,790
you know?
It's just,

359
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,010
uh,
take some people longer to kind of get

360
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,360
how to,
you know,

361
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,860
sort of factor all the aspects of life
together and make it some sort of a

362
00:15:48,861 --> 00:15:50,390
manageable plan for yourself.

363
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,970
Live your life.
But the idea of those kids being able to

364
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,690
run that,
that principle and run that,

365
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,640
the president of that school like that
and just tell you,

366
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,280
put your hands down and laugh at him.
Dude,

367
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:08,120
they laughed at him.
I heard a few smart people going about

368
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:09,860
trump and people like small hands,
you know,

369
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,220
and the,
and the left we'll,

370
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,710
we'll attack that.
It's like,

371
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:14,510
oh he got a small dick or your master's
here.

372
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,590
And I saw one,
I think,

373
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,920
I forget who comedian I used to open
mikes with any show writer.

374
00:16:18,921 --> 00:16:20,700
Now I forget who it was.
But um,

375
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,310
she was like,
don't say that.

376
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,770
Don't take their tactics.
Don't say look sir,

377
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:26,390
an important thing here.
Yeah,

378
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,800
that's,
that's that we believe in.

379
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,290
So stop saying that.
Not only that you're going to shame the

380
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,120
shit out.
All those guys that are out there that

381
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:34,790
actually have small,
her point was like,

382
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,350
don't,
don't just cause you know,

383
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,950
that will affect him.

384
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,120
You're doing the same thing.
The right does.

385
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,880
Don't do that.
Yeah.

386
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,950
He's not amazing though that that is
what we decided to do as a collective

387
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:47,510
group of humans to find the thing that
you can mock about him physically.

388
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,470
Like his Dick is little,
he's got small hands,

389
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:54,440
look at your small hands and then
there's people in the audience and

390
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:55,790
actually have small hands.
They're like,

391
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,510
fuck trump's a big giant guy.
Is it really tall?

392
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,640
He's like six two,
he's probably like your height.

393
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,500
Oh Wow.
He's a big guy.

394
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,050
Like he's a big imposing guy.
Like if you see that's,

395
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,450
that was the one of the speculations
about Jim Comey that um,

396
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,200
James Comey that trump didn't like him
because he was six foot eight.

397
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,820
Oh.
Cause he's huge.

398
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,360
James Comey was like this giant
basketball player.

399
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,080
Like,
dude,

400
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,290
you're like,
yeah.

401
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,590
And he just towered over everybody
including trump.

402
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:26,090
Trump's like,
get rid of that fucking guy.

403
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,770
I'm sure it was more card is my,
because he's investigating.

404
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,330
But that's more of shaming.
People love to do that.

405
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,920
Oh,
you tiny little man.

406
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,650
Yeah.
It's weird because you,

407
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:41,150
you're attacking something that's the
person can't change at all.

408
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,340
Like what do you like?
What do you care if he had small like

409
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,670
look how big call me.
It's called me.

410
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:46,820
He's a giant.
Wow.

411
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,710
Super person

412
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,320
who's going to size it morphs everybody.
Oh my God.

413
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,090
He's huge.
He didn't ignore this guy.

414
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,150
You know,
you,

415
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,040
I,
if I was Donald Trump and I was in this

416
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,740
sort of a dispute with a guy like that,
I said,

417
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,530
yeah,
you grew.

418
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,760
I would worry about,
call me running for president.

419
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:06,930
Really?
Fuck.

420
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:08,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

421
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,140
Watch house of cards,
son.

422
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,790
I know how this game is playing.
The next move is called me,

423
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,080
runs for president.
A bunch of people that get in the room

424
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:18,990
with him.
This is bankers and this was one dude

425
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:21,060
who's an internationally successful
businessman,

426
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:25,140
but he keeps like a humble lifestyle and
a normal house and he likes to bird

427
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:26,220
hunt.
Hey,

428
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:29,460
everybody watching at home right here is
what Joe Rogan explained to me.

429
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:32,340
How it works in politics,
not back to the actual show.

430
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,800
Yeah,
they do a little too much of that.

431
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Sometimes the camera,
they get away with it sometimes.

432
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,980
Here's what I want.
I want Claire Barnes to do those every

433
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:47,820
now and then was Claire Barns I Claire
Underwood.

434
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,190
Yeah,
his wife.

435
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

436
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,170
I want his wife to do it.
I say under what?

437
00:18:56,171 --> 00:18:58,140
The second time,
but I said the second time.

438
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:03,060
Who the hell's Claire Barnes?
Who reporter is that the girl's name and

439
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,340
homeland?
I've run out of space in my head.

440
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,880
I don't have any jumbled together.
It is it.

441
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,960
They're all jumbling together.
13 Zoe bonds.

442
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:14,040
That's who it is.
That's right.

443
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,410
Clear under what I want to hear.
What she,

444
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,540
what she says.
Yeah,

445
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,250
she's not allowed.
Why doesn't she look in the camera?

446
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,500
Look,
she's mysterious.

447
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:24,220
They have that as directors cuts show
him.

448
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:29,270
We network on the we network.
It's only the women up points of view

449
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,790
they have to or take us chromosomes
before they'll let you watch it.

450
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,660
You hold onto your remote and test to
make sure you're double x?

451
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,400
No.
Why No?

452
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:43,050
Why
we network.

453
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,090
Does anybody watch that anymore?
Chicks?

454
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,130
Yeah.
I got some people like hallmark.

455
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:48,810
Nobody really watches either of those
though,

456
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:50,190
right?
Nobody really watched it.

457
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:53,220
Somebody watches.
But nobody really dude go to Nebraska.

458
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,270
But like they watch it more than like
NBC Day Dvr the shit out of it.

459
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,380
David Taylor once said he was trying to
write,

460
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,080
they were buying like dump scripts for a
hallmark channel and he said he'd

461
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,190
watched a research,
a bunch of them and he goes pretty much

462
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:10,470
every one of the movies that work,
it's about a pet,

463
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,380
um,
a family reunion or a holiday.

464
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,140
So he had a,
uh,

465
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,540
lost my dog,
uh,

466
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,630
Christmas time,
a movie that he wrote,

467
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,640
try to get,
he was like,

468
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:23,430
I'll fill all of this stuff.
That's hilarious.

469
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,800
Yeah.
Those,

470
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,960
the,
remember that,

471
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,130
um,
billboard across the street from the

472
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:32,310
store was always the hallmark channel
forever two,

473
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:36,030
one of my favorite comments you ever
made because it was just like cop show.

474
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,300
Whereas to a woman in the front woman
behind her.

475
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:42,690
I kinda like Charlie's angels a little.
It took him tough like a dude way,

476
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,880
way in the back.
Maybe three women to one guy,

477
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,640
but the other good hardnosed detective
and you're like,

478
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:53,670
hallmark channel is Psi Phi for women.
Like in what world does this exist?

479
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,030
This is,
I forget.

480
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,580
It's so true.
I was doing that on stage for a while.

481
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,680
Yeah.
Now that I'm remembering I was doing

482
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,170
that.
I'm saying that on stage because it was

483
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:12,820
right there.
A series of fucking billboard across the

484
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:15,220
street.
I need you to go out there and look at

485
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:16,390
it.
I'm telling you after the show,

486
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:17,890
look at it.
This job's going to be better after the

487
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:18,724
show.

488
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,780
It really was like,
see what's possible and you're like,

489
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,240
that is not possible.
The guy would be like,

490
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:26,650
give me the fucking gun.
Where is he

491
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,950
at?
Guys like hanging back there.

492
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,830
Like he's waiting for these chicks to
save him.

493
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,110
Fuck are you watch on.
Me and Jay went on a rabbit hunt over at

494
00:21:36,111 --> 00:21:40,270
his place of looking for videos of women
cops getting beat up.

495
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,770
Oh God,
they're awful.

496
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,570
It's like fuck cause a huge power
difference here.

497
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,750
Oh,
disturbing.

498
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,450
There's one,
I'll never forget this one because the

499
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:54,260
guy's child,
it was his child I think,

500
00:21:54,261 --> 00:21:57,200
or his girlfriend.
I forget who it was.

501
00:21:57,201 --> 00:22:01,130
I think it was his kid was screaming at
him to stop,

502
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,230
stop,
to stop.

503
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,240
And he was beating the shit out of this
cop.

504
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

505
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:10,550
He got out of the car with her and it
was a woman and she was really little

506
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,030
and um,
she was pulling him over and he got out

507
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:17,750
of the car and I don't remember the
exact chain of events,

508
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:22,550
but I remember he was punching the fuck.
He Kod already on the ground and he

509
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:25,250
smashed in the face a bunch of times.
Yeah.

510
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,280
And His kid was screaming,
I'm pretty sure it's his kid

511
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,000
screaming to stop hos.
Oh.

512
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,440
So scary.
But it was like,

513
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,620
this is the reality of being a cop.
Let,

514
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:41,621
this is why it's not sexist that think
that it's a scary thing to have a 130

515
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:48,791
pound woman on her own out there driving
around in a cop car with a gun trying to

516
00:22:49,671 --> 00:22:51,950
pull over six foot four.

517
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:55,490
The guy was a stacked looking black
dude,

518
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,530
like he looked like a big guy and once
he got ahold of her and start punching

519
00:23:00,531 --> 00:23:02,120
her,
Holy Shit Dude.

520
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,490
It was awful.
It was awful.

521
00:23:04,491 --> 00:23:07,520
He beat the shit out of her and he did
it super easy.

522
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:10,190
And you realize like once you got it on
video,

523
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,880
yeah,
we want to show a little of a choke us.

524
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:16,340
It's awful man.
So this is big dude,

525
00:23:16,341 --> 00:23:19,640
right?
He gets out of the car and I think it's

526
00:23:19,641 --> 00:23:22,040
his look at that.
He just punches her in the face and

527
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:24,020
don't get in front of his daughter.
Oh,

528
00:23:24,021 --> 00:23:26,660
that's what it was wailing on him.
Oh Dude.

529
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:28,320
He beat the fuck out of her.
Well,

530
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,390
she's old.
She's out cold and he takes her gut,

531
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,280
takes everything in.
The daughter is freaking out,

532
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,420
dude.
It's hard to watch.

533
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,740
It's hard to watch.

534
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,520
Get back in the car.
Oh yeah,

535
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:45,470
man,
there's a bunch of a man.

536
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,230
It's such a dangerous job 10 times.
It's such a dangerous job.

537
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,590
It's such a dangerous job.
And to say that it's too dangerous for

538
00:23:54,591 --> 00:23:57,380
women,
whose to say that's,

539
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,410
I don't know,
to quit after that,

540
00:23:59,411 --> 00:24:02,150
if she kept working,
I think she kept working.

541
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,090
I don't know.
I think she might have brain damage

542
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:07,490
after that.
That's horrific.

543
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,180
It's a big dude.
And I bet she was twiggy full.

544
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,380
Yeah.
I mean he's really,

545
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,590
and I bet she was totally defenseless
after the first punch.

546
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,950
So it was just colleen clean punches
right to the face,

547
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,360
boom,
boom,

548
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:23,660
boom.
Put me the damage that a big guy like

549
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:28,130
that can do to just a regular female
face.

550
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,420
What's,
I can't with that because daughter too,

551
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,420
bro.
Oh my God.

552
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,290
It's terrifying to be around that kind
of violence when you're that little.

553
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,250
So that's,
that's what it was.

554
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:41,450
Why I think that the video showed the
kid in the car out of the car.

555
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:42,284
Shit,
man,

556
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,290
it was terrible.
But I mean that's probably one of a

557
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,700
hundred of those things that have
happened by the way,

558
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:49,400
in terms of if I felt unsafe when I was
traveling,

559
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,560
that shuts here.
Sure.

560
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,280
You right?
Yeah.

561
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:52,911
Yeah.
No,

562
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:55,910
I was known as unsafe.
It's like Chicago.

563
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,650
Yeah.
That's what I say about Mexico.

564
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,750
Like people will like,
do you ever go to Mexico?

565
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:03,890
And Mexico is like mostly Nice,
nice people.

566
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,230
They're really nice people.
Like Mexico is not the problem.

567
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,270
The problem is parts of Mexico border
towns,

568
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,190
some.
Yeah.

569
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,960
But it's also like that's the problem.
Like you said with the Detroit,

570
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,110
that's a problem with Chicago.
It's problem with a lot of places.

571
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,240
There's spots where it's fucking
dangerous.

572
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,040
Even most of Chicago's good.

573
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,750
Yup.
But Chicago's great.

574
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,540
550 murders last year,
but sick pick how many people weren't

575
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:27,260
murdered to marine outlook.
You're a glass half full kind of

576
00:25:27,261 --> 00:25:28,810
guidelines of not murdered people
running,

577
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,750
running,
running Chicago.

578
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:31,550
Really enjoying their freedom.
So yeah,

579
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:33,470
I mean if it affects you or someone that
you love,

580
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:35,390
it's terrible.
For sure.

581
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

582
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:42,380
So in all this traveling,
did you come out of this with anything,

583
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,080
you know,
a few things for sure.

584
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:50,530
Cause you seemed like to tell you from
the outside you seem like almost like

585
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:54,950
you a
had a different purse.

586
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,370
You all's each seemed,
I don't know man.

587
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,860
It was nice to see you when I first saw
him when he came back.

588
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,370
But you seem like a little different.
He seems like you,

589
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:05,800
um,
I don't know.

590
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,810
You've seen another level of stuff.
Like you see you've got another level of

591
00:26:11,691 --> 00:26:15,800
perspective from this travel thing that
like added to your,

592
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,980
your vision of the world,
your,

593
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,790
your overall world view with a lot of
time to think also he goes,

594
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,680
you're seeing stuff,
you know,

595
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:27,500
certainly as everyone would see out
there like poverty levels where you're

596
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:27,831
like,
oh,

597
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:28,664
I'm doing fine.

598
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,070
Yeah.
But not even that,

599
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:32,360
it's more specific.
It's just like,

600
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,200
I don't know,
friendly people and like,

601
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,390
yeah,
just different versions of it.

602
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:41,210
Plus with travelers and plus really
getting to a place where you're like,

603
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,010
don't need to do anything.

604
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:46,200
You know,
after a month of that it's like,

605
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,550
okay,
you just settle into this.

606
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:49,950
Like,
I dunno what's today going to bring

607
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,120
Ryan.
You know,

608
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:54,080
you wake up and you're just like,
I heard there's this cool temple there.

609
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:57,090
We'll go check that out.
Maybe those get on motorbikes and go

610
00:26:57,091 --> 00:26:59,250
somewhere.
I heard there's a cool,

611
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,810
you just talked to other travelers and
black,

612
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,240
there's a canyon up there.
It's really neat.

613
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:06,180
Go check that out while you're here.
And so you just do.

614
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:09,450
And at some point like
you know how when you haven't got enough

615
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:11,790
sleep for like a few days in a row,
you got four hours,

616
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:14,190
four hours,
four as and you sleep like 11 hours and

617
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:15,870
you're like,
I am completely caught up.

618
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,930
Right.
So like not having any responsibility,

619
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,190
the stress level goes down,
down and then it's just like waiting in

620
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:28,140
that zero responsibility life for like
three months in that level I guess.

621
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,460
Wow.
You know,

622
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:31,890
after the first couple of weeks and it's
just like I don't have anything to do.

623
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,500
Just like,
oh,

624
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,760
I'm just like fucking relax man.
I would leave a city when it felt like

625
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:40,830
the right time to leave a city.
You know,

626
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:42,390
it wasn't even like a regular vacation
where you're like,

627
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:43,091
come on,
we got to do this,

628
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:45,510
then move right it reservation
somewhere.

629
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,040
Yeah.
It was just like relax and then I could

630
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:53,070
just think about things.
My art form in general,

631
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,460
people in my life,
you know what I want and don't want to,

632
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,040
I'd have like moments of just like,
hey,

633
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:04,800
take a 10 hour bus.
There's no Wifi.

634
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,250
No,
you're just like thinking for a while.

635
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,693
Okay.

636
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,670
Yeah.
Tons of moments like that.

637
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,700
How did you know when to end it?
Um,

638
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,570
so I um,
I was going to come back for this show.

639
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,630
Um,
but then I remembered my,

640
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,250
my manager,
my friend Eric,

641
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:26,560
they wanted to do a show at third man
records in Nashville,

642
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,790
uh,
for the,

643
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,610
for the wild west comedy festival.
And I forgot about that cause that

644
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:31,900
people ask me when do you have to go
back?

645
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,130
But travels,
I meet and I was like,

646
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,410
I'm open to,
there was so many people that are just

647
00:28:35,411 --> 00:28:37,540
traveling open.
Wow.

648
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,040
Yeah.
That's really common.

649
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,080
I mean,
three months is like a norm.

650
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,170
You have some people in six months or a
year I've met,

651
00:28:44,171 --> 00:28:46,380
I'm in an Italian girl who was going on
her five and a half,

652
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,680
fifth and a half years,
just traveling five and a half years

653
00:28:50,681 --> 00:28:53,650
just traveling.
She find jobs every once in a while.

654
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:55,870
Wow.
Yeah.

655
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,920
And uh,
it's just

656
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:02,020
goes where she wants.
It's very appealing.

657
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,070
Yeah,
yeah,

658
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,690
yeah.
Very fascinating.

659
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,730
Right?
That's like nobody writes books about a

660
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:08,290
guy who stays in his town that he grew
up.

661
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,940
The book is about the crazy traveler
person.

662
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,980
Yeah.
It was all over the world and a backpack

663
00:29:14,981 --> 00:29:18,100
and yeah,
there's three months people all over

664
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:21,520
America doing that.
I know there's a lot of tent people,

665
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:24,880
there's a lot of people that like
they'll get like a truck,

666
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,840
you know,
like some sort of a get off the grid tv

667
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:32,140
thing and they drive it around a camp
grounds and they camp and they use the

668
00:29:32,141 --> 00:29:36,220
showers at the camp grounds and then
they do stuff enough for money so that

669
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:41,110
they have gas and they keep traveling
around and hope their car doesn't broad.

670
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,190
Yeah,

671
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,990
yeah,
yeah.

672
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:47,140
This girl picked oranges and Sydney for
like two months.

673
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,910
I had this dude on Chris cage.
He walked the Appalachian trail.

674
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,320
Wow.
Yeah,

675
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:57,670
it's Georgia with animals and stuff.
I don't know.

676
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,560
How do you survive?
You will never make it.

677
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,200
You would never make it.
What do you mean?

678
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,370
Well,
you'd never make it.

679
00:30:03,371 --> 00:30:05,170
If you're just trying to kill animals
all the way,

680
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:08,650
you'd never make it.
So how do you even have to be an elite

681
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:11,200
hunter and you still might not ever make
it because you're not.

682
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,270
If you're carrying that food around,
it's going to go bad.

683
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:15,130
You're walking through Georgia and the
summer.

684
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:15,471
No,
I mean,

685
00:30:15,471 --> 00:30:18,280
you know critters credit.
Do you not going to get enough?

686
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,800
Just really.
Yeah,

687
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:23,380
you'll starve.
It's way harder to kill an animal and

688
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:24,790
people thinking in a movie,
that's,

689
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:27,010
that's what's camp.
Get some dinner,

690
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,933
dude.

691
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,850
It's way harder.
It's way harder.

692
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

693
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,360
You're not getting,
unless you're walking around with

694
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:38,530
several high powered rifles and scopes
and you're setting up and know where the

695
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:39,251
animals are,
they,

696
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:42,550
here you come when you're walking,
you're not going to be able to walk all

697
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:43,590
the way to Maine.
Oh,

698
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,350
maybe that's your
stance.

699
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,400
You have to get our heads.
Bam.

700
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,780
They go to restaurants.
Yeah.

701
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,120
They buy food.
They stay in hostels.

702
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:52,701
You know,
they,

703
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:53,440
they have,
um,

704
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,490
these little,
uh,

705
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,840
camping spots where they have covered
shelters and people share them.

706
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,950
Really?
Yeah.

707
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:01,870
There's a lot of that too,
where it's just like,

708
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,801
oh,
forget about your,

709
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:04,930
like what you need in terms of like
hotels.

710
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:05,980
Yup.
That's all out.

711
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,330
You need a bed.
That's all you need.

712
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,180
So some people that carry it on their
back,

713
00:31:10,181 --> 00:31:14,770
there's a thing called a bivy sack.
Every sack is a baby sack is like either

714
00:31:14,771 --> 00:31:16,300
a baby Sacra,
Bibby tent.

715
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,240
Um,
they're like essentially like a

716
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:22,330
combination sleeping bags tent.
Oh cool.

717
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:24,060
And it's super light pull,
pull up.

718
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,920
Um,
a picture of a big tent.

719
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,230
Yeah.
That's one of the reasons I didn't go to

720
00:31:29,231 --> 00:31:31,510
South America is cause I was like,
there's gonna be more camping,

721
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,300
it seems like up and down the coast and
stuff.

722
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,740
Yeah.
Like cities.

723
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,600
And I'm just like,
I don't know if I can camp alone for

724
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:39,400
that long.
You might freak out.

725
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,263
Yeah.

726
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:44,950
Be Hard to get a good night's sleep
around a bunch of Weirdos.

727
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,560
Speak their language.
This is what they look like.

728
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,190
Oh,
neat.

729
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,540
So you keep that thing,
they,

730
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,310
they wrap it up,
put it on their back.

731
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,160
It's pretty light.
Carrie,

732
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,790
that was the fucking rain off.
Yeah.

733
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,270
Yeah.
It's basically like just this tiny ass

734
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:02,530
little tent.
And like if you were a minimalist hiker,

735
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:05,410
like if you're,
some guy was trying to walk 50 miles or

736
00:32:05,411 --> 00:32:06,640
something crazy.
Like these guys,

737
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,970
they try to carry as a light of stuff as
they can.

738
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,840
They try to go as minimal as they can
and that's one way that they do that.

739
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,750
Yeah.
And then a lot of times I'll use like a

740
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,770
little air mattress.
Like that dude has a little law.

741
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,740
Wow.
Blow it up.

742
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:22,480
Don't take up any space.
Yeah.

743
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,960
Just got to hope it doesn't pop.
Otherwise you're sleeping on rocks.

744
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,490
Yeah.

745
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:30,880
It's hard.
But that was what everybody did to

746
00:32:30,881 --> 00:32:34,000
traveling for this backpack.
We just got to make it work.

747
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,560
Space was like a a,

748
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,860
that's another thing you learn too.
It's like I need much stuff.

749
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,090
Yeah.
You'd go down to like,

750
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,700
you know,
just the backpack full of hats,

751
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,480
all your belongings.
Did you buy anything?

752
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,500
You got to tow something about?
Yeah man.

753
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:53,530
Like there's a real movement right now
towards minimalism or where people are

754
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:57,560
trying to pair the life down as much as
possible.

755
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah.
I think people don't want to get

756
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:03,380
involved with like banks and fucking
having to like mortgage themselves and

757
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,940
their,
their lifestyle just for the sake of

758
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,300
having things.
Yup.

759
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,360
When they're like,
and so they get into like stuff like

760
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,160
camping and hiking.
Well it's also,

761
00:33:10,161 --> 00:33:12,650
you got to think like what do you really
appreciate?

762
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,500
What's important to you?
Like what's really important to you?

763
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,450
Yeah.
Cause you don't have forever.

764
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,370
Right.
So what is important to you?

765
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:21,920
Cause you only have 24 hours in a day,
so what's important to you?

766
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:27,080
Find out what the fuck that is and do
more of that and try to figure out like

767
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,390
how to,
how to make enough money so that you're

768
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:32,630
not starving,
that you're doing well,

769
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,350
but don't just chase that chase what
you're trying to do.

770
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,460
I did the point system attached to it.
The monetary point system,

771
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:44,630
it can get you all fucked up because
it'll get you working like 12 hours a

772
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:46,460
day,
13 hours to get what?

773
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:50,720
To get more stuff to get better stuff,
to get more prestigious stuff to get

774
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:52,580
stuff that you know all your other
stuff.

775
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:54,470
Having friends are really jealous of
your stuff.

776
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,410
Yeah,
just going to die bro.

777
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,060
And it's not that you can log term.
I mean like what are you getting out of

778
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:01,520
it now that that's what's most
important.

779
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:03,050
Yeah,
a ton of people that are like,

780
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,630
I don't want that shit so I'm just going
to do a job.

781
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,420
You know,
working on a tugboat and Seattle for few

782
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,490
months,
save up money and then go fucking enjoy

783
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:11,630
myself.
Yeah.

784
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,270
Yeah.
There's a lot of people that are just

785
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:19,330
choosing to look at everything that they
can see experienced every new place that

786
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:21,950
they can go to.
That Henry Rollins podcast,

787
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:23,210
man,
it's a world changer.

788
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,560
That crazy fucker is fascinating.
He's a fast,

789
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:30,230
I never met anybody like him.
He's really fascinating.

790
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:33,640
He goes and does stuff and see stuff.
It was just also is lik outlook,

791
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:37,220
how he simplifies all the things that
are wrong with him and all the things

792
00:34:37,221 --> 00:34:39,890
that are wrong with the way he interacts
with people.

793
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:41,790
And so this is an I'm going to do and
this is good.

794
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:42,551
I'm like,
you know,

795
00:34:42,551 --> 00:34:45,680
like he's like his,
his um,

796
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:50,950
story about being given lose a Ritalin
was Ritalin right from the time he was

797
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:54,320
like five fruit as a young boy.

798
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,290
They gave him Ritalin till senior year
of high school.

799
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,290
So he was like,
I would just be on these pills.

800
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,290
I'd be like all day at the end of the
day,

801
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:05,030
like boom.
He was like crash.

802
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,820
And then they do it again.
I mean they were dead juicing them up

803
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:12,770
with this crazy stuff from like he was
an experimental case he grew up in,

804
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,600
from what I understand,
he's from Potomac,

805
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:17,270
Maryland,
which was same county is where I grew up

806
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:19,670
in.
But that was the richer part of town.

807
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,310
Um,
nothing was a rich kid,

808
00:35:22,311 --> 00:35:25,580
but like Montgomery County is one of the
richest counties in America.

809
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,960
And like that was just a standard thing.
Like your kid's not performing.

810
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,270
Ideally he's learning disabled.
Give me some pills.

811
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:37,330
Right.
Crazy that people thought for that was

812
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:40,710
the way to go.
I just uh,

813
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,920
it just fascinating that he so like
Henry so intense and he so like his,

814
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:52,221
he's got like these rock solid test fix
and this view of the world.

815
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,080
It's very egalitarian,
very open,

816
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:57,870
but also very aggressive.
Very interesting.

817
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,630
This started out though,
it's just this is what I believe no

818
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:01,950
matter what.
Yes.

819
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,820
He was like,
Oh yeah,

820
00:36:02,821 --> 00:36:04,440
for sure.
I thought about this and here's the

821
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:05,251
answer.
No,

822
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:07,950
I super enjoyed talking to him.
Thanks for hooking that up.

823
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,720
I'm glad it worked out.
I was gone.

824
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:10,554
But I was like,
hi,

825
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,761
I got back.
I was like,

826
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:13,200
trim it,
link up with him.

827
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:13,891
You're like,
yeah,

828
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:14,620
we did.
It was good.

829
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,210
Yeah,
I guess like,

830
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,080
Oh hell yeah.
Yeah,

831
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:17,910
it was really good.
He's a,

832
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,420
I just love when someone is just soaking
in as much as they can get.

833
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,440
Yeah.
Just out there like,

834
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:27,960
let's go to Bali and he just goes to
Bali.

835
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:30,690
Let's go to Africa.
Now we're in Tanzania,

836
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,030
lauer in Botswana,
you know,

837
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:37,050
and just meeting people and going out on
the fucking sand dunes and shit.

838
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,270
And it's like with Bedouins.
Yeah.

839
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:43,350
I mean if you get away from like the
backpackers path,

840
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,830
you know the tourist path and sometimes
it would get like too much,

841
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,900
but you just go out and then you can
like,

842
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,850
yeah,
I really see some shit.

843
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:52,980
Like basically what it is.
Yeah.

844
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,870
My friend Jessie is going back to
Liberia.

845
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,100
Wow.
December.

846
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:59,010
They'd left after it when Charles Taylor
was taken over.

847
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,630
Um,
and so,

848
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:02,280
but now it's safe again,
isn't it?

849
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,210
Yeah.
Wow.

850
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,370
And they're trying to convince the world
that it's like a decent,

851
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:07,300
like tourist place.
But Jesse's going back into town.

852
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:07,620
We're like,
dude,

853
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,660
I'm coming with you.
I'm staying with your fucking family's

854
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,420
House hotel.
But like let's see what Shit's really

855
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:13,860
like out there.
Yeah.

856
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,030
So let's see.
Yeah,

857
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,630
I bet it's a trip.
Yeah.

858
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,460
Did you ever see the vice piece on
Liberia?

859
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,000
Vice Guide to travel?
Um,

860
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,960
and they went to Liberia and my man
Shane,

861
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:33,470
he was over there in Liberia talking to
this dude who his name is general button

862
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:38,160
naked.
This guy was famous for going into

863
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:42,270
combat during the war,
but he would take all of his clothes off

864
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:46,590
and he'd run naked killing people.
Naked Dude heat.

865
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,910
He admitted he was talking about how
they would capture a child from the

866
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:55,410
other tribe and they would kill him and
cut pieces of the heart out and eat it

867
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,700
to give them a invincibility.
Like he was talking about this and he's

868
00:37:59,701 --> 00:38:04,050
free on the streets and they,
they exonerated him because now he's

869
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:05,800
like a Christian minister.
Yeah.

870
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,500
It's pretty much the only Charles Taylor
got punished.

871
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,420
Everyone else was like,
you're all done.

872
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:12,480
Go be part of the government.
It's okay cause this guy like openly

873
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:14,670
talks about all the crazy shit that he
did.

874
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,040
Wow.
About cutting the hearts out of

875
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:18,240
children,
eating them.

876
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,490
You know how Libya was started?
Yes.

877
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,550
I didn't know that til recently.
Tell everybody slave thing.

878
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,930
Freed slaves.
Yeah,

879
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,800
there went back to chip president monroe
freed up and said we'll ship you back

880
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:29,970
there if you want.
And a lot of people are like,

881
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:32,280
yeah,
I don't trust you guys so I'm going to

882
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:34,140
guess I'm going to go back to Africa.
Crazy.

883
00:38:34,141 --> 00:38:38,650
They never grew up and so they call it
the barrier for liberated and that's why

884
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:40,210
they all speak English.
It's there is no,

885
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,980
they don't have any African language
anymore.

886
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:46,060
Wow.
Yeah.

887
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:48,070
Monrovia is our capital President
Monroe.

888
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,730
The idea of it is so crazy.
I know.

889
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,700
Use the expression too much but going
back and starting up a free slaves

890
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:58,580
countries,
taking them and throwing them onto a

891
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,220
patch of land,
good luck.

892
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,640
I mean it's like setting out a zoo
animal into the wild.

893
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,070
Right?
It's like have fun surviving.

894
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,030
Holy Shit Man.
And just talk about feeling displaced

895
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,160
and confused.
You didn't even grow up there.

896
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:15,580
And how many lions in fucking Georgia
and you must be thinking of yourself

897
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:17,560
like what kind of shit?
Luck too.

898
00:39:17,561 --> 00:39:22,360
I have,
I've double Shit La Shit luck that I was

899
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:27,220
a slave and then shit lock that I was
thrown back to Africa and to stick.

900
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,870
That might've been the way to go.
Oh yeah,

901
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:29,800
for sure.
It'd be free.

902
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,170
Better.
Oh yeah,

903
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,440
a hundred a semi free post slavery.
But I'm just saying like it's still a

904
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:38,170
bad
shit luck.

905
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,180
Yeah,
you only got three cards.

906
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,210
The best you can do is three of a con
would these general button naked guy

907
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:48,211
turned to dude in because the dude was
selling human flesh and he knew because

908
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:51,190
he had eaten human flesh,
so he knew what it tasted like.

909
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:54,190
So that's how when he was buying like
shish Kabob from this guy,

910
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,440
he turned him in.
He's like,

911
00:39:56,441 --> 00:39:59,770
this guy was selling human flesh.
I could tell because I've eaten it

912
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:02,830
before.
What the fuck did you just say?

913
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,950
You can tell what it tastes like.
If I give you a piece of lamb,

914
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,860
would you know for sure that was a lamb?
I'd have an idea.

915
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:09,940
Yeah,
no idea.

916
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:13,510
But I could maybe sneak in like a piece
of wild sheep or something.

917
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:14,350
You might,
maybe that was,

918
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,930
you know what I'm saying?
Because this mother fucker,

919
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:19,660
no,
that's him right there.

920
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,310
He went flush.
Tastes like that's him right there.

921
00:40:22,311 --> 00:40:24,130
A general button naked.
Wow.

922
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:26,260
Yeah,
it tasted,

923
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,570
I got a taste.
It was human.

924
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,340
I called the police.
Wow.

925
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,160
Nice.
Todd knows what human tastes like,

926
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:34,040
dude.
Yeah.

927
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,340
Fuck.
Just said they went on the test they got

928
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:38,920
when they were testing out like rocket
launches to sell them to people there.

929
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,090
They will be like,
let me show you.

930
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,460
And they're just blow up a dam,
you know.

931
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:45,790
And so the infrastructure is totally
fuck cause everyone is testing out their

932
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,420
weapons all like,
no,

933
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,510
we need that building.
Oh my God,

934
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:51,550
that's so crazy.
I'd be like,

935
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:52,191
cool,
I'll talk.

936
00:40:52,191 --> 00:40:56,410
Take him.
Well maybe it'll eventually like calm

937
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:58,510
down and be like Australia.
Right.

938
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,180
Because Australia was a place where they
wanted to get rid of prisoners,

939
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,480
shipped him off to Australia.
Now the best people ever.

940
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,720
Maybe that's exactly what's going to
happen in Liberia and they just need a

941
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:10,210
couple of generations to knock the dust.
Got Rid of Taylor.

942
00:41:10,211 --> 00:41:10,961
So there,
there should be.

943
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:11,561
Okay.
Yeah,

944
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:13,960
maybe that'd be fine.
It just takes a while to rebound from

945
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:15,850
some shit like that.
Yeah.

946
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:18,190
But Henry Rollins has that of like going
to a place and like,

947
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,050
let me see what this was like.
Yeah,

948
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:20,920
man.
Inspiring.

949
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,300
There's not a whole lot of people that
do it,

950
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:24,270
that's for sure.
Yeah.

951
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,120
Any works.
Like his work ethics,

952
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,890
insane.
Like I'm talking about his writing and

953
00:41:29,891 --> 00:41:31,810
what he's doing and he's always doing
something.

954
00:41:31,811 --> 00:41:34,250
He was writing columns and you know,

955
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:37,550
he's just,
he goes and does stuff and then he comes

956
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:39,770
home and takes care of business and then
he's like,

957
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:40,700
cool.
Took care of it.

958
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,010
Go.
I think I would do this again after my

959
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:44,090
next special.
Yeah.

960
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,960
Yeah.
He's just going to just every,

961
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,660
it's like once you're finished with
work,

962
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,490
it's like all right,
before I start building up again,

963
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,960
do a walkabout.
Yeah.

964
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:52,850
I Dunno.
So you didn't see some of the world.

965
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:53,880
Yeah.
Do a walk about,

966
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,780
I met a bunch of people doing gap years.
What's a gap here?

967
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:57,740
Yeah,
exactly.

968
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,900
What's the gap year?
It's all over every other country.

969
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,760
Just not ours.
What's that mean?

970
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,910
In between high school and college?
You're leaving your friends,

971
00:42:04,911 --> 00:42:06,920
you're about to make new friends.
Oh,

972
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:09,680
take it out of here for a year.
In between college and Grad school or

973
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:10,460
college and,
and,

974
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,100
and your first year of work now is the
time.

975
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,000
Well,
European countries have a point in this

976
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,800
more relaxed approach.
Yeah.

977
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,960
To like the future and your life.
Yeah.

978
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,840
They really do this,
this conqueror's mentality.

979
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,500
I wonder how many heart attacks we have
in comparison to European people.

980
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:29,150
I don't know,
but it's like the world.

981
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:30,210
We're not living our lives,
you know,

982
00:42:30,211 --> 00:42:33,170
Germans get off.
How many are you familiar with the,

983
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,750
uh,
vacation time leave in America?

984
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,250
What is it?
It's two weeks.

985
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:39,710
Pretty much two weeks vacation,
two weeks sick.

986
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:42,320
Do you get paid vacation?
Paid vacation?

987
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:43,760
Two weeks.
Is that standard?

988
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,440
That's the standard.
Okay.

989
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,300
That's nine to five 30,
you know,

990
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,840
um,
in Germany and most of Europe,

991
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,770
definitely all Scandinavia.
You get 25 days off,

992
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,050
five weeks,
Jesus.

993
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,020
And if you get sick during those weeks
off,

994
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,840
if you had to go to the hospital in,
in whatever country you're in and you

995
00:43:02,841 --> 00:43:04,880
showed them I was in a hospital,
you get those days back,

996
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:09,540
they'll kind of get your sick time
instead and they expect you to take this

997
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,150
to the vacation time too.

998
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,270
Not like here with like,
come on,

999
00:43:12,271 --> 00:43:14,090
you can't really use it.
You know what's fucked up?

1000
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,490
Sick time.
Okay.

1001
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,070
I've ran out of sick days.
Yeah.

1002
00:43:17,071 --> 00:43:18,040
Yeah.
It's like why?

1003
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:20,040
What do you mean?
Like you're sick.

1004
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:25,540
Like either you're a fucking liar or I
trust you now if I trust you,

1005
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:28,610
you just really unfortunate.
And if I love you and we're friends and

1006
00:43:28,611 --> 00:43:30,250
we work together,
um,

1007
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,100
I want you to get back,
so I don't want you to motto,

1008
00:43:32,101 --> 00:43:32,610
so,
okay.

1009
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,110
Yeah.
You.

1010
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,500
You don't have to come back to work
because they're already used definite 14

1011
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:38,450
days,
but you're going to exactly sick the

1012
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:41,750
same amount of time every year to
imagine telling somebody like,

1013
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:42,950
buddy,
you're out of sick days.

1014
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:44,760
I'm going to have to dock your pay and
you,

1015
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:49,070
you're dying,
but I can't praise ivs and shit.

1016
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:50,510
I don't care.
You're out of shape days.

1017
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,510
The calendar doesn't say that.
It doesn't back you up on the other

1018
00:43:53,511 --> 00:43:56,030
statistics.
In order to keep revenue flowing,

1019
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,990
it must keep you in the process.
You know what?

1020
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,900
You have a certain amount of days you're
allowed to be sick.

1021
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,650
That's fucking ridiculous.
Like hopefully there'll be zero.

1022
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,570
Well,
I'm saving up my sick days.

1023
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:10,730
What?
You save up your sick days.

1024
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:14,390
What does that mean?
Like you're your sick days pair of carry

1025
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:15,171
over.
Yeah,

1026
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:17,390
exactly.
Get extra days where you can pretend

1027
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:19,130
you're sick,
sick days.

1028
00:44:19,131 --> 00:44:21,590
You can save up vacation days,
but I don't think you could set up sick

1029
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:25,540
days should be able to
move them around like cards who?

1030
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:28,550
He's give you half of them back.
I took four.

1031
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:30,260
I've tend leftover.
Give me five for next year.

1032
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,400
People real jobs are so mad at us right
now.

1033
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:36,780
Yeah.
You mother fuckers don't know shit about

1034
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,670
sick days are work days to be under the
thumb of an oppressive dictator offsite.

1035
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,810
It's terrible.
Yeah.

1036
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:44,550
All these expectations that you never
take off.

1037
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:46,590
You have to pull your whole life into
that shit and it's like,

1038
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,980
Oh man,
go do some stuff.

1039
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:49,530
Okay.
Let me play devil's advocate because if

1040
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:51,690
I was one of the people out there that
likes to complain about,

1041
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:53,550
should it be like though,
it's easy for you to say are you haven't

1042
00:44:53,551 --> 00:44:55,140
had a job,
you don't have the responsibility,

1043
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:56,820
so I have.
Yeah,

1044
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,840
that's true.
All right.

1045
00:44:58,841 --> 00:45:00,600
I'll be quiet and a podcast.
Not at all.

1046
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,160
I'm saying though they'd demand better.
They get it better and other places they

1047
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,350
absolutely should.
First of all,

1048
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:11,310
Haitian that you go fucking see the
world and go do stuff for 40 hour work

1049
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:12,910
week is bullshit.
Bullshit.

1050
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,720
Shut up that level.
Nobody should do it.

1051
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,780
I shouldn't be standard.
Everyone has to do the same amount in

1052
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:19,050
less.

1053
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:23,060
I want to buy something that you make,
then could you please like get up and do

1054
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:28,070
over time and put it in night shift and
give people a time and a half for

1055
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:31,620
overtime so you encourage them to go
over time?

1056
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,950
Yeah,
time and a half you can get out of the

1057
00:45:34,951 --> 00:45:39,030
mindset of having to work this time.
I just demand something better or more

1058
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:40,020
interesting for your life.
Well,

1059
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:43,890
it's just a weird standard that we've
all accepted pretty much across the

1060
00:45:43,891 --> 00:45:45,210
country.
Nine to five.

1061
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:48,600
Nine to five.
Nine to five [inaudible] morning Bob.

1062
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:51,420
Nine to five.
It's not a five 30 or six oh yeah.

1063
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:54,300
If you want to take a lunch break,
we'll get paid for that anymore.

1064
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,460
You don't know.
It's not nine to five anymore.

1065
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:57,570
Is that trump?
Did he do this?

1066
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,493
No.
No.

1067
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:03,000
It's been a long time.
Nine to five and Oh shit.

1068
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,110
Nine to five.
Could you imagine what a weird,

1069
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:12,290
weird decision to make the most
significant thing be the productivity.

1070
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,940
It's pretty new on a month.
Where's that horn going off young,

1071
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:18,780
Jamie,
you hear that?

1072
00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:21,930
Is it in the back?
Just give it a little double check.

1073
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,060
Go through with a baseball bat,
tell him to shut the fuck up,

1074
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:27,990
but like walk towards them and walk out
there with your Dick in your hand.

1075
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:32,320
That way you startle anyone you see.
And you always have the first mover.

1076
00:46:32,321 --> 00:46:33,154
Yeah,
exactly.

1077
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:36,870
They had to react like this guy's crazy
came out with his dick out.

1078
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,280
Yeah.
Like if you,

1079
00:46:38,281 --> 00:46:41,850
if you're getting ready to fight and you
just come out holding onto your Dick,

1080
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:43,051
people are like,
Whoa,

1081
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:44,970
what's he planning?
A lot of people would back down from

1082
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:47,250
that fight.
A lot of people wouldn't,

1083
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:50,940
people would be worried that Dick would
touch you,

1084
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,890
but once it did touch you,
we realize it really doesn't do

1085
00:46:52,891 --> 00:46:53,610
anything.

1086
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:57,810
But to be the chief people would have to
like lean back with their hands forward

1087
00:46:57,811 --> 00:47:00,270
and try to get as if your punches don't
matter.

1088
00:47:00,271 --> 00:47:01,610
But the dick touching your toes.
Yeah.

1089
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,410
Like he's going to touch you and give
you cooties.

1090
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:04,790
Yeah.
Because the happy,

1091
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:10,510
you look at like an electric eel Dick,
I gotta pee right here.

1092
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:12,630
You know,
I don't want to leave.

1093
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,010
You can use a Kombucha bottle.
Yeah,

1094
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:15,010
man.
It's the healthiest probably.

1095
00:47:15,011 --> 00:47:16,230
Look,
I've done this twice.

1096
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:16,981
Really?
Yeah.

1097
00:47:16,981 --> 00:47:18,630
We've done this in the podcast before.
Great.

1098
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,730
For sure.
I like the fact that you're willing to

1099
00:47:20,731 --> 00:47:23,070
do that too.
I don't think we could show it on

1100
00:47:23,071 --> 00:47:24,240
youtube though,
so we'll have to,

1101
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,720
we'll have to move away.
Oh,

1102
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:29,350
he's got his dick out.
Got a big opening.

1103
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,240
Yeah,
so it doesn't vacuum up.

1104
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,490
How often?
DUP DUP.

1105
00:47:33,491 --> 00:47:34,680
Several Times.
Every day.

1106
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,870
Do you like one of them are healthy
water drinker dudes.

1107
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,840
I pay a lot.
Do you?

1108
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,440
Are you a healthy water drinker?
Dude?

1109
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,390
Interesting detail.
This just happened.

1110
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,313
Oh,
you ran out.

1111
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:45,970
Don't know.
Uh,

1112
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,080
hold on one second.
Jamie.

1113
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:50,060
Go to the recycling.
Get me something.

1114
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:51,510
It's all right.
I'm pitching.

1115
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,530
I've got a strong grip.
Everybody.

1116
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,850
You can move all I have to take it to
touch the bottle.

1117
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,040
A cop,
not a bottle.

1118
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,010
He's like,
oh man.

1119
00:48:03,011 --> 00:48:05,920
It's going back in though.
I can feel it starting to swell back

1120
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:06,340
yet.
That's,

1121
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:09,940
that's unhealthy.
I've been pitching too long.

1122
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,490
Should I pay under the cup or bottle
yet?

1123
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:13,383
Oh,
you emptied it.

1124
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,223
Oh,
thanks for that.

1125
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,710
Oh yeah.
A lot went back in and my urethra are,

1126
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:21,640
you should fear,
uh,

1127
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,090
couldn't hold in his Pe,
ladies and gentlemen,

1128
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,900
couldn't means wouldn't filled up one
Kombucha bottle.

1129
00:48:28,901 --> 00:48:29,840
Here's a cap there,
felon,

1130
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,640
and then filled it up again.
I had to go empty it out for him.

1131
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,600
Thanks for doing that.
I on the front.

1132
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,820
I didn't want to leave you hanging in
there,

1133
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:40,790
dude.
Really?

1134
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:44,290
There was only one solution.
I almost went to the kitchen sink and

1135
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:45,160
then I put it like,
Ooh.

1136
00:48:45,161 --> 00:48:48,610
Then we'd have to rinse that out and
show it would be nasty.

1137
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,730
Did that bathroom sick is nasty.
You're don't have a cleaner in here.

1138
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,180
No.
It's like,

1139
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,750
it looks like a bachelor.
We're on their way out of this.

1140
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:57,700
Oh Man.
I was like,

1141
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:00,070
it's not that bad.
You're just got used to it.

1142
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,810
You've slowly seen it get worse and
worse.

1143
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,030
Gas Station bathrooms.

1144
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,510
Trying to recreate that here.
I should definitely have someone come in

1145
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,910
and so fucking far nine.
Uh,

1146
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:16,480
do you,
um,

1147
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:20,440
do you like doing your podcast?
Like the way you're doing it?

1148
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,140
You just like have a subject?
Yeah,

1149
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:24,460
for the most part.
I mean,

1150
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,840
you can deviate once you start talking,
but you have like a set thing that you

1151
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:30,160
wanted to talk to someone about.
Yeah.

1152
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,620
Keeps me focused.
And then it's also like a,

1153
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,440
I get to ask real detailed question
myself.

1154
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:35,980
I want to ask about,
you know,

1155
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,280
um,
and usually I get it with some level of

1156
00:49:39,281 --> 00:49:42,370
expert,
not like the best in the world,

1157
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:43,600
but someone has experienced with
something,

1158
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,460
right?
Like I'm an expert on standup comedy,

1159
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,560
you know,
I've been one.

1160
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,050
Right.
So if you were doing that,

1161
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:52,960
I could tell you all about standup.
I know more than most people in the

1162
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:55,000
world,
you know about hunting more than most

1163
00:49:55,001 --> 00:49:55,930
people,
you know?

1164
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:56,920
Not really.
Yeah.

1165
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:59,800
But you've done it more than like words
in the average person,

1166
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,750
but people who actually know it.
I'm very novice.

1167
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:05,530
Right.
I'm always aware of it enough to be

1168
00:50:05,531 --> 00:50:06,001
like,
yeah,

1169
00:50:06,001 --> 00:50:07,170
I know about that world.
Yeah,

1170
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:08,770
I know.
Tell me some stuff about that world.

1171
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,300
Yeah.
So yeah,

1172
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:11,980
I liked doing it that way.
But then like,

1173
00:50:11,981 --> 00:50:15,980
imagine if a five year comics started
talking about what standup is shut up.

1174
00:50:15,981 --> 00:50:16,660
But knowing,
boy,

1175
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,540
it does take a lot longer with stand up
to like with hunting.

1176
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:20,171
Really?
Yeah.

1177
00:50:20,171 --> 00:50:22,000
I'm,
I'm a five year a hunter,

1178
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:24,040
so for me,
I just shut the fuck up and listen to

1179
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:25,720
the people that actually know what's
going on.

1180
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:29,920
Or Parrot,
they say it's too complicated.

1181
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:33,350
A hunt hunting is a super complicated.
There's a lot involved in that.

1182
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,540
Yeah.
But generally it's like Theo Vaughn

1183
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:39,200
climbed Kilimanjaro.
Teddy really are up to base camp or

1184
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:40,330
something like that.

1185
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:42,080
Oh,
he's great.

1186
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,610
He's so funny,
man.

1187
00:50:43,611 --> 00:50:44,121
Yeah.
Yeah.

1188
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:46,040
He's really hilarious.
So funny.

1189
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,420
He had,
I was in the back of the,

1190
00:50:47,421 --> 00:50:50,210
or the other night and he was killing
me,

1191
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:53,120
killing me to a point where I was,
I was crying.

1192
00:50:53,121 --> 00:50:55,910
Tears are rolling down my face.
He was so silly.

1193
00:50:55,911 --> 00:50:58,140
That pit a bit.
Uh,

1194
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,300
yes it did.
It did.

1195
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:00,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

1196
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:01,170
He's,
he's real funny.

1197
00:51:01,171 --> 00:51:02,750
He's really funny.
Like,

1198
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:04,940
if you get a chance to see him,
folks,

1199
00:51:04,941 --> 00:51:08,090
if you're out in the road,
unless Ari's in town.

1200
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,510
[inaudible] was an impression of him for
punchdrunk Desi,

1201
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,210
yeah.
Will just come in and sometimes you to

1202
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,500
do del Ray.
He just like,

1203
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,690
Oh,
I'm talking about the yoga.

1204
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,920
It doesn't so go with that accent heads
Larry.

1205
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:20,900
I know.
That's part of what's funny about that

1206
00:51:20,901 --> 00:51:23,060
too as his dog scent.
He's just fucking great.

1207
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,160
So many funny guys.
They're mad.

1208
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,340
That's what he did.
He stayed at my apartment one month,

1209
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:32,450
I think it was an Edinburgh last year.
So he stayed at my place and uh,

1210
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,500
he was like,
aw man.

1211
00:51:34,501 --> 00:51:37,240
All right.
I got heavy into coke.

1212
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,470
It
fucking nuts.

1213
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,120
It's hilarious.
Boy,

1214
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:48,380
that's a clean better than anybody
else's stay there.

1215
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,720
Yeah,
but duck had left it pretty nice too.

1216
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,480
Yeah.
Dot.

1217
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,550
They kept me out a little bit.
Is that I was like talking,

1218
00:51:55,551 --> 00:51:56,990
you can stand by it because he was
moving to New York.

1219
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:57,824
Right.
Then he was like,

1220
00:51:58,170 --> 00:51:59,510
oh,
don't get an airbnb.

1221
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:03,350
Just stay at my place.
But I was like two days in when I got

1222
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:04,790
out there and I was like,
I've made a huge mistake.

1223
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:08,660
I should go back home two days.
Priya right away.

1224
00:52:08,661 --> 00:52:10,220
It's so different than him.
Like what am I doing?

1225
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,630
This is definitely a mistake.
What,

1226
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:16,550
what was the initial thought behind it?
Like what did you think?

1227
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:18,920
Do you think that this is what I need to
recharge?

1228
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,290
No,
I've been wanting to see the world for a

1229
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:21,280
while and you know,
I had,

1230
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:22,520
I had,
I had one good,

1231
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,550
this Guy Turner brought me out to a tour
of China.

1232
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:28,970
Um,
and I just sort of saw some of that

1233
00:52:28,971 --> 00:52:32,840
place and it was like,
just so like the really the meaning of

1234
00:52:32,841 --> 00:52:34,160
the word foreign,
you know?

1235
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:35,930
Yeah.
Just way different.

1236
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:38,110
And they're just like,
I just wanted to see more of that world.

1237
00:52:38,111 --> 00:52:41,630
And I went with,
with PDC to Thailand a couple of years

1238
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,000
ago.
Went one of those full moon parties and

1239
00:52:44,001 --> 00:52:45,710
it just got more like I want to see
things.

1240
00:52:45,711 --> 00:52:48,710
I did a Scandinavian tour last year.
I made sure to leave days off in between

1241
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:51,170
shows.
So like a really see some of the cities,

1242
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:54,200
I don't know man.
I just get off and like seeing new

1243
00:52:55,790 --> 00:52:58,490
new versions of the world and new
experience of what people care about.

1244
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:03,910
Well I think we love to um,
to compartmentalize and to like look at

1245
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:09,341
our specific area because I think it's a
part of being a human until recently.

1246
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:14,420
Like until you could travel like this,
like what people liked was knowing the

1247
00:53:14,421 --> 00:53:17,630
sort of security of their environment.
They know the environment well.

1248
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:19,760
They're around it all the time.
There's no surprises.

1249
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:21,770
I got this place a lockdown down on
safe,

1250
00:53:21,771 --> 00:53:24,020
but it's not adventurous.
It's not adventurous.

1251
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:28,200
So this new thing that people are able
to do only really within the last

1252
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,560
hundred years while you could just get
up and travel and just,

1253
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:33,780
I mean,
I guess there's probably world travelers

1254
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,801
before.
Yeah.

1255
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:37,380
Before for sure.
But I mean how many of them did it

1256
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:38,330
recreationally?
Like,

1257
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,990
so easy now.
Yeah,

1258
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:42,840
you can stay at hostels for cheapest.
Fuck,

1259
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,360
you know,
meet people and have them tell you what

1260
00:53:45,361 --> 00:53:47,850
there is to do where you are or where to
go or not go.

1261
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,240
When do you think that that was really
an acceptable thing?

1262
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,091
As far as,
no,

1263
00:53:52,091 --> 00:53:52,410
no,
no.

1264
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:54,070
I mean world travel.
Oh,

1265
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:56,850
like when,
when were you an invader?

1266
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:57,871
Oh,
right.

1267
00:53:57,871 --> 00:54:00,330
And when did it become okay to be a
tourist?

1268
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:05,360
I think it was always sort of okay to be
like some guy in foreign lands if as

1269
00:54:05,881 --> 00:54:09,630
long as there by herself and not like an
invading force,

1270
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,900
but if you want to just visit somewhere,
right.

1271
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,570
I mean I just wonder how many people did
it no steak.

1272
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:20,070
Like here's what I noticed in Hong Kong
and Shanghai,

1273
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,980
which our banking centers and the people
that would come to the shows,

1274
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:24,290
ex pats,
Hong Kong,

1275
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,100
you had more locals because they don't
speak English there.

1276
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:27,780
But in Shanghai,
let's say,

1277
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,410
and it's like if you're an English
banker from London,

1278
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:35,070
or if somebody from New York and you
took the job in Shanghai,

1279
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:37,230
China,
like your,

1280
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:39,780
you'd have to have some adventures bone
to you.

1281
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:42,420
Instead of staying in New York or
staying in London,

1282
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,340
you'd have to be saying like,
yeah,

1283
00:54:44,341 --> 00:54:46,350
I'm going to go with my kids or without
my kids.

1284
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:47,820
I'm going to go fucking do this new
thing.

1285
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:50,760
And Yeah.
I mean,

1286
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:52,650
just to want to go do that.
You can do it now.

1287
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:54,320
There's jobs everywhere.
Yeah.

1288
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:56,580
My friend William,
uh,

1289
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,830
children's,
he moved to me and Mario got a job

1290
00:54:58,831 --> 00:54:59,100
offer.

1291
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,570
Who's an architect.
Wow.

1292
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:03,960
So He's building prisons.
Prisons are designing them.

1293
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,070
Yeah,
yeah,

1294
00:55:05,071 --> 00:55:06,390
exactly.
But like,

1295
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,940
it just opened up the army,
just letting people,

1296
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,260
and he was like one of those first wave
of people and they started doing stand

1297
00:55:12,261 --> 00:55:13,680
up out there.
Dude,

1298
00:55:13,681 --> 00:55:16,470
that's gotta be a creepy feeling.
Building prisons,

1299
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,340
something like that.
Yeah.

1300
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:19,700
Designing them.
And now he's doing standup.

1301
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,910
He,
yeah,

1302
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,830
he did all of his time there.
He had the show.

1303
00:55:22,831 --> 00:55:24,950
I didn't Bangkok.
He brought me out there from Emr.

1304
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,640
He took a trip there and met me in
Bangkok.

1305
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:29,340
Cj,
do you think he's doing comedy to

1306
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:31,870
balance out the building prisons?
No.

1307
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,110
No.
It just does comedy.

1308
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:40,020
He's back in America
building prisons.

1309
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,230
Not that we don't need prisons.
Not there aren't bad people that should

1310
00:55:43,231 --> 00:55:44,064
be locked up.
Yeah,

1311
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,720
that's not what I'm what I'm saying.
It's like you guys got to design them so

1312
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:50,010
he's going to make it more comfortable
maybe.

1313
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:50,810
Oh,
whatever.

1314
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:51,960
Yeah,
because that's what make it so they

1315
00:55:51,961 --> 00:55:53,160
can't get out.
That's what it

1316
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:57,780
is.
The sunshine,

1317
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:01,290
the wall situation.
It's a crazy thing when someone escaped

1318
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:02,580
from prison,
Wham,

1319
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:04,470
Wham,
Wham,

1320
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,500
and let the dogs who's wherever,
wherever I wrote.

1321
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:09,000
Can you imagine getting out of prison?
Oh my God.

1322
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:12,240
That must be so exciting.
A tunnel every night or finding you have

1323
00:56:12,241 --> 00:56:13,920
to find the way out.
How do you know the way out?

1324
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:19,280
How do you escape?
How about El Chapo walks down to the

1325
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:24,291
whole that's under his toilet that goes
a mile plus in the ground and then pops

1326
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:27,790
up at some goofy ass house and gets in a
car and drives off.

1327
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,320
Wow.
See US suckers.

1328
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:31,410
Is he still free as he know?
No,

1329
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:33,700
he's back.
They caught him of Chapo.

1330
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:37,750
They did something and he got injured to
something happened to him.

1331
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,970
He like hurt his leg or something like
that through the tunnels.

1332
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:44,740
I think he might've like broken his leg
falling and they're trying to escape.

1333
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:48,010
You know,
he didn't look like he was the most fit

1334
00:56:48,011 --> 00:56:51,130
fella.
He's too busy running shit.

1335
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:52,900
Yeah.
To actually be running.

1336
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:57,140
Well we'll it if you can hear this.
Uh,

1337
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,500
July 18th,
my netflix special comes out.

1338
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:02,080
That's so amazing.
Shout out to El Chapo.

1339
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:04,840
I checked that out with Chapo.
He speaks English and when he would the

1340
00:57:04,841 --> 00:57:09,841
comedy translate to him?
I think some of it would if it would fit

1341
00:57:10,091 --> 00:57:11,830
after they've subtitles on Netflix.
So,

1342
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,390
right.
That's how I always wonder,

1343
00:57:13,391 --> 00:57:16,780
like that's one of the unique things
about like learning a language.

1344
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:19,690
It's the way they structure their
sentences is very different.

1345
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:21,040
So it's,
you can't,

1346
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,800
it's not just this word means that that
word means this.

1347
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:24,700
So just replaced them.

1348
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:25,960
No,
it's interesting when you talked to

1349
00:57:25,961 --> 00:57:27,610
people from other countries,
when you're out there and you start to

1350
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:28,960
the event,
be able to translate their

1351
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:31,780
mistranslations easy things like what
time it is,

1352
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,100
right.
They don't realize that that's a

1353
00:57:33,101 --> 00:57:34,120
statement,
not a question.

1354
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,760
Right.
But like you just get to like,

1355
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:40,720
when they say five years more,
it means like,

1356
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,000
I've already been here five years,
that they're not really,

1357
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,830
so you have to understand what they
really mean.

1358
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,310
Sort of like that 72 virgins expression,
what it means.

1359
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:49,840
Like it must glowed.
Oh really?

1360
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:50,703
Yeah.
That's what it means.

1361
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:53,890
72 is like a shit load,
you know?

1362
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,740
Yeah.
It's not like a specific number.

1363
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:57,970
Like we,
when we see a few,

1364
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:59,950
it's like technically it means three,
but really it just means,

1365
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:01,450
I don't know.
Som mungus amount,

1366
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,620
72 virgins.
Right?

1367
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:04,441
Oh my God,
you have,

1368
00:58:04,441 --> 00:58:06,790
so we all took that as like,
you think you're getting exactly 72

1369
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:07,960
virgins,
exact glow.

1370
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:08,853
Yeah.
We don't.

1371
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:14,610
Yeah,
I used to do a whole bit about that.

1372
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,220
Seven suicide bombers.
What page is this whole 72 of our

1373
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:23,710
agenda.
Something written anywhere to shop.

1374
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:26,950
It's doing
okay.

1375
00:58:26,951 --> 00:58:29,050
I just want to know why can't you just
tell me what page it's on.

1376
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,280
What a crazy world to think that there
are people that will go into crowded

1377
00:58:35,951 --> 00:58:38,040
areas like in Manchester?
Yeah,

1378
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,590
and just blow themselves up and kill a
bunch of people around them.

1379
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:47,500
But halls or just like belief.
Oh belief for sure.

1380
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:51,340
And then some sort of mental illness for
sure.

1381
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,100
There's a lot of issues.
Abuse,

1382
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:56,020
maybe.
Maybe there's physical abuse.

1383
00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:00,520
Maybe they're like have no idea what
have an extreme desire to show their

1384
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:02,260
love.
You just think you were at war,

1385
00:59:02,261 --> 00:59:04,000
right?
Who knows?

1386
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:08,950
Who knows why you think
you would,

1387
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,620
you know,
to break down the psychology of,

1388
00:59:11,621 --> 00:59:15,580
so when there's a suicide bomber would
be very like you would,

1389
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:20,650
you would have to do a tremendous amount
of research before you started drawing.

1390
00:59:20,651 --> 00:59:22,010
Any are hard to find

1391
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,970
them to talk to them too.
That's what already done a problem.

1392
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,140
The theoretical suicide bombers do not
apply.

1393
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:29,720
I'm thinking about you have to get guys
who,

1394
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:31,630
whose best don't go off.
Okay,

1395
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,170
we got to talk to you.
Even then,

1396
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,770
like what are you going to get here?
This is a recovered person.

1397
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:38,540
They got,
they got through that moment where

1398
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,460
they're going to blow themselves up and
it didn't happen.

1399
00:59:40,461 --> 00:59:42,620
Now they've sort of had a chance to
think about it.

1400
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:43,910
How do you charge that guy?

1401
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,310
Yeah.
You know?

1402
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:46,840
Oh yeah,
I would do it again.

1403
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:48,540
I realized I was about today.
Do you notice a different in,

1404
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:48,870
in,
uh,

1405
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:49,780
in um,
uh,

1406
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:52,720
deviant sociology does a different
category for,

1407
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:54,430
uh,
people who attempt suicide and people

1408
00:59:54,431 --> 00:59:56,950
who commit suicide really in the psyche
of it.

1409
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,030
Oh,
I see.

1410
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,010
Because their thing is if you attempted
it,

1411
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,550
he weren't really trying.
It ain't that hard to do.

1412
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:08,110
You were probably trying to cry out.
And the people who do it generally shut

1413
01:00:08,111 --> 01:00:10,240
up about it more.
They just do it without telling people

1414
01:00:10,241 --> 01:00:11,170
like,
I'm going to kill myself.

1415
01:00:11,171 --> 01:00:13,360
I want to kill myself.
So somebody said it.

1416
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:16,360
People say they want to kill themselves.
That's a good sign that they need help,

1417
01:00:16,361 --> 01:00:17,710
but that they're not going to kill
themselves.

1418
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,680
Hmm.
There's,

1419
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,130
is there a different,
there's a different mentality between

1420
01:00:24,131 --> 01:00:27,340
also someone who wants to kill
themselves and someone who wants to

1421
01:00:27,341 --> 01:00:28,290
literally be the

1422
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,440
bomb that kills a bunch of the,
yeah,

1423
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:34,490
that's a,
if you really believe in heaven and

1424
01:00:34,491 --> 01:00:37,250
you're going there though,
fucking great.

1425
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,260
Get there.
Why wait?

1426
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:41,710
Wow.
I mean,

1427
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:42,700
you're for sure going,
it's,

1428
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:44,600
it's like,
you know the Catholic confession on your

1429
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:46,310
death bed and then you go straight to
heaven,

1430
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,540
but it's hard to time it,
right?

1431
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:50,270
Yeah.
You confess all your sins right before

1432
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,021
you die.
You're going,

1433
01:00:51,021 --> 01:00:52,010
shit,
you have no sense left.

1434
01:00:52,011 --> 01:00:53,000
You're going to heaven.
Right.

1435
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,580
But you don't time it,
right?

1436
01:00:54,581 --> 01:00:55,550
Yeah.
And that's really hard.

1437
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:57,890
These guys figured out the way to time
it perfectly.

1438
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:01,580
My Act of blowing myself up gets me into
heaven by the way.

1439
01:01:01,581 --> 01:01:02,510
All my sets,
right.

1440
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,140
One shot.
Unless as he blew it up,

1441
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:08,310
part of it goes,
fuck.

1442
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,040
Right before he died,
he goes to hell for eternity

1443
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:14,450
to Callis Jamie.
No,

1444
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,720
I don't know anybody from Manchester.
I'm sorry.

1445
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:19,423
Just

1446
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:22,460
what if,
what if you do it?

1447
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:26,690
What if you do it and you think you're
going to be in heaven and you press the

1448
01:01:26,691 --> 01:01:27,740
button,
boom,

1449
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:33,100
and then all of a sudden it's just you
disembodied and an infinite black room.

1450
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:40,330
It just you forever in the blackness of
infinite space with no stars,

1451
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:45,790
just you alone with nobody.
What's floating through eternity.

1452
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:48,380
You just,
you,

1453
01:01:48,381 --> 01:01:51,890
you can experience the blackness of
space,

1454
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:55,250
but with no stars and nothing to look at
women forever.

1455
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,470
Just you just,
you just use your conscious

1456
01:01:57,471 --> 01:02:01,760
consciousness and realizing how huge you
fucked up.

1457
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,920
Oh,
forever.

1458
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:04,120
Oh,
that'd be pretty bad.

1459
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:05,290
He'd go crazy.
Right?

1460
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:08,050
Then you'd come back,
we'll come back and crazy.

1461
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,220
What would even be crazy?
Imagine if you have your consciousness

1462
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:13,910
forever.
Nothing drove by it too.

1463
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:18,310
Nothing to apply to and you're floating
through infinity and you don't have a

1464
01:02:18,311 --> 01:02:19,830
body,
so you're not to bad man.

1465
01:02:19,831 --> 01:02:20,010
That's

1466
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,290
a pretty bad punishment.
That's pretty bad.

1467
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,520
It's not good.
Wow.

1468
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:25,740
That would be real tough.
Still not good enough.

1469
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:32,420
That's you should float.
Unable to turn to d while you're feeling

1470
01:02:33,361 --> 01:02:35,790
like you're choking on Dick's.
Wow.

1471
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:41,800
Like that's a little
for eternity because if you can exist

1472
01:02:44,281 --> 01:02:48,510
for a second way choking on a deck,
you could exist for eternity while he

1473
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:49,980
choked it out on deck.
Yeah.

1474
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:51,840
So that should,
that should be the punishment for

1475
01:02:51,841 --> 01:02:53,310
suicide bombs.
They have the simpsons where

1476
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,310
homer going to hell and then,
uh,

1477
01:02:57,311 --> 01:02:58,860
the devil,
one of the demons was like,

1478
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,900
so you would like donuts?
Do you try eating?

1479
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,540
I'm merely and go nuts.
And it's just conveyor belt that keeps

1480
01:03:03,541 --> 01:03:07,040
like shoveling donut to do his mouth and
he keeps going more pleased

1481
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:11,460
that he's gotten off that big.
It's like please more.

1482
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:13,543
Another one please.

1483
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,130
Oh,
you ever do the simpsons ride at

1484
01:03:17,131 --> 01:03:18,540
universal?
Nope.

1485
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:20,700
It's fucking amazing because it really,
it's crazy.

1486
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,370
Giant animated ride.
You just sit in a car.

1487
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,250
It's one of the best rides ever.
So good.

1488
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,230
Yeah.
And it's all happening on a screen,

1489
01:03:28,231 --> 01:03:32,760
but the cars moving around so it feels
real and it's an enormous fucking really

1490
01:03:32,761 --> 01:03:36,450
high resolution screen where it's
showing this huge cartoon where this

1491
01:03:36,451 --> 01:03:38,100
whole thing plays out.
Oh,

1492
01:03:38,101 --> 01:03:40,200
it's fucking great.
It's really good.

1493
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,330
The simpsons are a national treasure.
Yeah,

1494
01:03:42,331 --> 01:03:43,830
they really are.
It's pretty great.

1495
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:46,170
It's pretty great.
My whole adulthood,

1496
01:03:46,171 --> 01:03:48,000
I guess they've been on since I was in
high school.

1497
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:49,450
Really?
Yeah.

1498
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,920
Yeah.
Tracee Ellis,

1499
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,690
dude.
They were one of the first.

1500
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:57,540
There's something crazy like that.
30 30 yeah,

1501
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:59,010
me too high school,
Dude.

1502
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:00,570
It's forever.
It's always been there.

1503
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,000
I'll never forget it.
I remember like what a great show.

1504
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,510
Remember one,
a homer Simpson went to a chili cook off

1505
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,240
and the peppers were so hot.
He started tripping.

1506
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:12,050
He had psychedelic trips.
Peppers were merciless.

1507
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:13,380
The ghost peppers,
right?

1508
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:15,000
Isn't that what it was supposed to be?
The of quit.

1509
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:16,740
So sockets a Nunga.
What does that,

1510
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:19,380
is that what they call it?
Ghost peppers and puts a sockets manago

1511
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:22,900
grown to the deep and the jug of
primeval by the inmates up a Guatemalan

1512
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,300
insane asylum.
Yeah.

1513
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:25,980
That was a great show.
Caught.

1514
01:04:25,981 --> 01:04:27,210
Damn.
What a creative,

1515
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,250
see,
that's the thing about like bill burrs

1516
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:31,960
show F is for family too.
I haven't seen the new ones yet.

1517
01:04:31,961 --> 01:04:34,050
I heard they're great.
I heard they're really good.

1518
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:36,000
Of course it's great.
Bill's Hilarious,

1519
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:41,450
but you could do so much cool shit on a
cartoon that you can't do in real life.

1520
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,430
What's the head back it up?

1521
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,130
But then there's that again.
We'll get decapitated.

1522
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:51,450
They get blown up.
I mean how many times it South Park

1523
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:52,283
Killed Kenny.
Yeah.

1524
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:55,590
So many of them comes back and he didn't
care that he came back.

1525
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:58,020
He just comes back.
I love how later they sorta like dealt

1526
01:04:58,021 --> 01:04:59,970
with it with like the reincarnation sort
of stuff.

1527
01:04:59,971 --> 01:05:01,110
And he said,
I'm going to saying things.

1528
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:03,990
Yeah.
He remembers all his past lives.

1529
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:05,910
So ridiculous.
Yeah.

1530
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,900
I love when I F is for family cause
there's a,

1531
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:11,670
there's a real type characters and they
look real.

1532
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,040
They don't look all like Weirdo,
like uh,

1533
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:16,580
like squid billies type stuff.
So it's like this is,

1534
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:19,720
you can believe as a people and when the
father saying to his son,

1535
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:23,210
fuck you,
it's like a real sharp,

1536
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:27,130
oh my God,
it's like a cartoon.

1537
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,200
But in my opinion,
like if you got to give,

1538
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,250
wow,
I mean,

1539
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:36,910
I was going to say like the all time
best is south park,

1540
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:39,010
but I don't really think there's an all
time best,

1541
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,620
but it's in terms of they're all
awesome.

1542
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,360
I don't want to like say this is number
one is number two,

1543
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:46,010
but like south park has had some fucking
money.

1544
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,670
I won't miss that show is South Park.
I mean for,

1545
01:05:48,671 --> 01:05:51,280
and for years it's been that you just
don't miss any episodes.

1546
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:53,380
There is no falling behind.
There's no like,

1547
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:54,480
oh yeah,
it's,

1548
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,870
I just stop watching a couple seasons
ago.

1549
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,360
It's just like every year I get so
excited to see those posters and the

1550
01:05:58,361 --> 01:05:59,630
billboard now on the,
uh,

1551
01:05:59,631 --> 01:06:01,130
the billboards and the subway.
Yeah.

1552
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:02,030
And it's like,
oh,

1553
01:06:02,031 --> 01:06:04,570
it's back.
It's fucking amazing show.

1554
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:07,070
And it's been amazing forever.
You have trey Parker on here on this

1555
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,230
podcast would for sure.
Oh,

1556
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:09,490
you should.
I would.

1557
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:10,750
I'd have them both.
I'm at,

1558
01:06:10,751 --> 01:06:12,430
yeah,
you left matt out.

1559
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:15,550
How dare you,
you don't even care about matt the ever

1560
01:06:15,551 --> 01:06:16,750
see that show.
Um,

1561
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:19,440
a boy,
they show the making of a soft start

1562
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:19,880
there.

1563
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,920
Yeah.
That's great.

1564
01:06:20,921 --> 01:06:22,330
Fuck yeah.
Documentary.

1565
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:24,250
It's great.
He's humbling,

1566
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,720
right?
Trey Parker,

1567
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,070
like his work ethic and the way he goes
after it,

1568
01:06:29,071 --> 01:06:29,904
it's like,
whoa.

1569
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:32,590
It's like get the fuck out of that guy's
way out of his way.

1570
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:35,470
It's pretty much sets that you guys come
out for a second.

1571
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:37,570
What can I do with it this?
And then someone would say something

1572
01:06:37,571 --> 01:06:39,430
cool and then right back in.
Yeah.

1573
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:42,850
That dude from snl working there that
week and he barely had anything to do.

1574
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:44,830
Wow.
I four was his name.

1575
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:48,160
It was hater.
What's his name?

1576
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,470
John Hater.
John Hater.

1577
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,360
But later it was John hit her own
Napoleon dynamite.

1578
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:53,650
Hey,
let me ask you this.

1579
01:06:53,651 --> 01:06:56,830
We didn't think a Bill Maher.
I'd never been a bill Marfan,

1580
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,520
but do you think of this whole recent
controversy of him just casually drop on

1581
01:07:00,521 --> 01:07:01,570
an Bob?
Yeah.

1582
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,370
You know,
he was trying to make a joke.

1583
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:04,630
Exactly right.
Yeah.

1584
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:07,990
I mean it didn't work,
but he's trying to be naughty.

1585
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:09,063
Yeah.
That's all.

1586
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:13,520
But they're making it seem like it's
something more that it's words that,

1587
01:07:13,521 --> 01:07:14,950
like you said this and said,
yeah,

1588
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:16,720
said,
said not did,

1589
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,870
did is worse,
but it's totally not hire black people

1590
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,680
is that,
that's a major issue if he's never hired

1591
01:07:23,681 --> 01:07:26,290
a black person.
But I don't think I've heard of that.

1592
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,590
So it's like his actions aren't,
we were talking about before the

1593
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:32,300
podcast,
this thing where the,

1594
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:34,900
where they were talking about the
Clintons in Arkansas,

1595
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:36,960
in the governor's mansion.
What,

1596
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:39,910
what show was that?
What show was it?

1597
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,680
Did you see Jamie?
I read it.

1598
01:07:41,681 --> 01:07:42,950
I didn't see it on the show.
Oh,

1599
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,360
was getting passed around the Internet
yesterday.

1600
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:47,080
Mm.
I'll pull it up.

1601
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:50,410
It's gotta be Russian disinformation.
I could be,

1602
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:53,260
who knows?
But apparently when Bill Maher,

1603
01:07:53,261 --> 01:07:55,030
when they go like troubling from bill,
I mean,

1604
01:07:55,031 --> 01:07:56,950
I get to even the Republican senator,
they was there with,

1605
01:07:56,951 --> 01:07:58,220
it was like,
what?

1606
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:00,220
Like I'm a little uncomfortable,
but sure.

1607
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:02,560
Be uncomfortable.
And if a guy,

1608
01:08:02,561 --> 01:08:05,080
I'm watching a guy who uses words that
make me uncomfortable at time,

1609
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,790
I'll stop watching.
I guess.

1610
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:11,380
You know,
twitter erupts over news that Hillary

1611
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:15,220
Clinton used black prison labor while
first lady of Arkansas,

1612
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:16,160
newsweek.com.

1613
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:17,870
And what does it have to do with,
um,

1614
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:23,050
JFK?
JFK pushed the Democrats to Democrat

1615
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:26,970
running for connecting,
pushed them to the right and Hillary

1616
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:27,590
Clinton physics too,

1617
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:29,630
Huh?
I don't know.

1618
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:36,900
Um,

1619
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,250
okay.
When we moved in,

1620
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:41,370
I was told that using prison labor at
the governor's mansion was a

1621
01:08:41,371 --> 01:08:44,160
longstanding tradition which kept down
cost.

1622
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,960
Clinton rights.
She has it.

1623
01:08:45,961 --> 01:08:49,380
Most of the workers were convicted
murderers and she became friendly with,

1624
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:53,100
in quotes a few of them,
African American men in their thirties

1625
01:08:53,101 --> 01:08:56,250
who had already served 12 to 18 years of
their sentences.

1626
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,100
Woo.
Despite their alleged friendships with

1627
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:02,130
these men,
Clinton tells her readers we enforced

1628
01:09:02,131 --> 01:09:06,930
rules strictly and sent back to prison.
Any inmate who broke a rule despite

1629
01:09:06,931 --> 01:09:10,920
having no psychological qualification,
she later asserts that these men did not

1630
01:09:10,921 --> 01:09:15,030
have inferior iqs or an ability to apply
moral reasoning,

1631
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:19,500
but instead they may have been emotional
illiterates

1632
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:22,760
emotional illiterates.
I don't know.

1633
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:25,640
That's what she said.
But I like how it says,

1634
01:09:25,641 --> 01:09:29,630
despite having no psychological
qualifications later asserts,

1635
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,200
despite having no ability to say this,
she said,

1636
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,730
yeah,
it's kind of weird though,

1637
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,170
that slave labor.
Yeah,

1638
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:38,450
that is exactly what that is.
I mean,

1639
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:40,250
let's know,
but it's just tradition.

1640
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:40,701
It's like,
yeah,

1641
01:09:40,701 --> 01:09:42,440
but that doesn't mean he should do it.
Let's be honest.

1642
01:09:42,441 --> 01:09:44,450
Like how much are they getting paid?
Zero.

1643
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:46,220
What?
The fucking one pack of cigarettes a

1644
01:09:46,221 --> 01:09:46,821
week.
Yeah.

1645
01:09:46,821 --> 01:09:50,360
What did they get?
They did not pay inmates at all.

1646
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,100
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

1647
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:55,490
Clinton makes no mention of whether or
not these men received any money for

1648
01:09:55,491 --> 01:10:00,491
working for her and her husband at 2016
article for Mother Jones notes that when

1649
01:10:01,311 --> 01:10:03,560
it came to prison,
when it comes to prison labor,

1650
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:08,570
some state states include Texas,
Arkansas and Georgia.

1651
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:13,571
Do not pay inmates at all.
Holy Fuck on twitter.

1652
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:18,140
Djing wrote that.
Hillary Clinton was a direct participant

1653
01:10:18,141 --> 01:10:21,290
in what?
Sam Sue Sway Samsung.

1654
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:23,870
Uh,
it's at Samsung pay on twitter,

1655
01:10:23,871 --> 01:10:26,930
I guess correctly described as modern
slavery.

1656
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,790
100% well,
dude,

1657
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:31,160
that's 100% slavery if you don't pay
someone.

1658
01:10:31,161 --> 01:10:34,250
And you make them work because they did
a crime.

1659
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:39,320
That's a crazy thing like boat,
but you're making them work.

1660
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:40,880
That's what's crazy about it.
It's like,

1661
01:10:40,881 --> 01:10:43,700
it's not just that you,
you,

1662
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:47,120
you were your freedoms taken away and
they lock you in a box,

1663
01:10:47,121 --> 01:10:48,290
but they also make you work.

1664
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,240
Send your lives aren't worth anything.
We can make it do whatever we want.

1665
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:56,000
Yeah.
And that dude from a Phoenix makes you

1666
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:57,620
work in pink.
Oh yeah.

1667
01:10:57,621 --> 01:10:59,480
That,
that Gelato Cryo guy.

1668
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:00,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

1669
01:11:00,681 --> 01:11:03,140
He's a,
he's an interesting case.

1670
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:05,330
It makes you put pink on to embarrass
her.

1671
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:06,060
Yeah.
Do,

1672
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,850
do you get embarrassed when you were in
pink?

1673
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,830
Epic?
Sometimes I don't give a fuck.

1674
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,010
I'm not a big pink where I will
occasionally wear pink.

1675
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,260
I'll admit I'm not a big pink where,
yeah.

1676
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,740
But at the same time I don't care about
it.

1677
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:19,380
I'm not scared of a color.
I'm a rational person.

1678
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:23,090
I remember in high school,
like 1314 wearing pink ties and stuff.

1679
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:26,130
Like she'll bring a little embarrassed
but also been like,

1680
01:11:26,131 --> 01:11:28,320
this looks good.
And then learning the word salmon makes

1681
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:29,790
it way more easier.
You know,

1682
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,920
gene,
the Belo is wore a pink judogi.

1683
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:32,953
Really?
Yup.

1684
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:34,860
Why?
It's clean and sober.

1685
01:11:34,861 --> 01:11:37,500
It says an all of them clean and sober
with pink shirts.

1686
01:11:38,070 --> 01:11:39,630
Probably because they,
uh,

1687
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:41,430
were drug offenders.
Right.

1688
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,740
He gets upset.
He wants everybody clean.

1689
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,060
I mean it's better than then they
combine sober.

1690
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:49,350
Oh,
there's an ang and quotes around it,

1691
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:50,820
that silly rascal

1692
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:56,480
and he's not taken out ever pink.
Um,

1693
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,570
so judo,
gene labelle was like one of the

1694
01:11:58,571 --> 01:12:02,790
toughest men that's ever lived.
Did his judo with a pink Guiana.

1695
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,180
Why?
Fuck you?

1696
01:12:04,181 --> 01:12:09,181
That's why
Google judo,

1697
01:12:09,251 --> 01:12:11,500
gene labelle judo.
Gene Labelle was,

1698
01:12:11,501 --> 01:12:12,400
uh,
he was,

1699
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:15,610
uh,
I know he was a national champion in

1700
01:12:15,611 --> 01:12:18,760
judo and I think he won a gold medal in
the Olympics through,

1701
01:12:18,761 --> 01:12:21,880
I saw clay Guido see him once and
there's real quick what was coming up.

1702
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:24,280
So it wasn't like he was in the cheap
seats with us.

1703
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,080
Right.
And he started judo gene and like the

1704
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:27,880
section,
whether you sit and he was like,

1705
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,320
oh fuck.
He just jumped.

1706
01:12:29,321 --> 01:12:32,260
I don't know how it got past security.
Just like ran past them just to go get

1707
01:12:32,261 --> 01:12:33,670
that guy a hug.
What is gene?

1708
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:34,930
There's gene,
the balance Pinky.

1709
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:38,120
What does gene labelle's um,
his accomplishments.

1710
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,630
He said a shitload of accomplish.
That's the judo,

1711
01:12:40,631 --> 01:12:42,850
but clearly on the guy.
Yeah,

1712
01:12:42,851 --> 01:12:45,970
he definitely did some training with
Rhonda and he's also the guy that

1713
01:12:45,971 --> 01:12:47,380
exposed,
um,

1714
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:49,810
Bruce Lee to grappling.
Oh really?

1715
01:12:49,811 --> 01:12:52,080
To joint locks and joint manipulation.
It's,

1716
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:56,050
what does it say here?
National Champion.

1717
01:12:56,410 --> 01:13:01,410
So he won the Aau national judo
championships in 60 and 54 and 55

1718
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:08,440
North American heavyweight championship.
See Nwa.

1719
01:13:08,441 --> 01:13:10,540
All that stuff I think is like fake
wrestling.

1720
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,890
Oh really?
Yeah,

1721
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:14,240
he is real wrestling and perfect.
Nwa,

1722
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:15,670
professional wrestling.
Yeah.

1723
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:18,430
There's no tag team in real wrestling.
So he was a national champion.

1724
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,310
Is there a real,
some reason I thought he was a,

1725
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,180
an Olympic champion than I might've made
that up.

1726
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:24,790
Is there a Greco Roman tech team?
Uh,

1727
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:25,840
no.
That's not real.

1728
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,640
Oh Man.
The show.

1729
01:13:27,641 --> 01:13:30,670
Um,
you could see like a,

1730
01:13:30,671 --> 01:13:34,550
there's a million pictures of him
wearing this ridiculous pink gee,

1731
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:37,990
how do I not know his,
his,

1732
01:13:37,991 --> 01:13:40,510
uh,
accomplishments in judo but,

1733
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:43,180
and as far as like a pinky.
Yeah,

1734
01:13:43,181 --> 01:13:44,800
he's crazy.
He's always been crazy too.

1735
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:47,460
He had a one.
Yeah.

1736
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:48,910
Yeah.
He's a great guy.

1737
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:52,030
He had one of the first mixed martial
arts fights too.

1738
01:13:52,031 --> 01:13:54,430
He fought a boxer.
Simone said he could,

1739
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:57,760
uh,
he would go down there with Piper,

1740
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:00,900
I guess pipe were trained with them.
Um,

1741
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:02,650
and uh,
he said we'd go down there and get calls

1742
01:14:02,651 --> 01:14:04,810
all the time for people challenging him.
Judo gene,

1743
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:08,420
like I can beat you up and he would just
answer the phone all day.

1744
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:08,990
Just aren't,
well,

1745
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:10,310
come on.
Prove yourself.

1746
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,410
I'm here.
I'll take you.

1747
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:14,010
All right,
well I'm here eight to seven every day

1748
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:16,640
by just saying sound people.
I fuck you.

1749
01:14:16,641 --> 01:14:18,100
We'll come over all with you.
I'll beat you.

1750
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:21,610
He was like in his sixties and he caught
some kids breaking into cars and his

1751
01:14:21,611 --> 01:14:26,611
neighborhood and a one kid came after
him and he just fucking man handle this

1752
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:28,540
poor kid.
And throw him on the ground.

1753
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:31,170
Imagine being thrown on the ground.
65 year olds,

1754
01:14:31,171 --> 01:14:33,370
65 year old judo black show.
This guy,

1755
01:14:33,371 --> 01:14:35,830
what's up boy?
What the fuck?

1756
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:39,730
Yeah.
He put two dudes to sleep when they're

1757
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:40,900
trying to break into cars.

1758
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:45,580
He's just a different kind of human
being.

1759
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:51,430
It's just like if he got ahold of you,
it's like it's guy being grabbed by some

1760
01:14:51,431 --> 01:14:53,500
sort of a primate,
you know?

1761
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:56,290
I imagine the pride.
It's of your face.

1762
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,150
Yeah.
You just feel so weak.

1763
01:14:58,180 --> 01:14:59,770
If once you were in the air,
he'd be like,

1764
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:03,220
how is this happening?
Like before he slams your head off the

1765
01:15:03,221 --> 01:15:04,510
ground,
you've got to be thinking,

1766
01:15:04,511 --> 01:15:06,550
how has he just throwing me around like
this?

1767
01:15:08,030 --> 01:15:09,700
Well,
weird specialty.

1768
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:14,590
The specialty of throwing.
You can become really good at throwing

1769
01:15:14,591 --> 01:15:15,940
people's bodies around.
You'll see that.

1770
01:15:15,941 --> 01:15:16,691
Uh,
did you see that?

1771
01:15:16,691 --> 01:15:18,340
What's it called?
Boom.

1772
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:22,780
That's beautiful techniques and given
some kid technique off the sideline

1773
01:15:22,781 --> 01:15:25,420
here.
Oh Wow.

1774
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:27,740
Wow.
That's,

1775
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:29,320
boom.
That kid has some technique.

1776
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:30,010
Oh,
so pool.

1777
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:30,821
He's like,
hell yeah,

1778
01:15:30,821 --> 01:15:31,810
Bro.
Man.

1779
01:15:31,811 --> 01:15:33,610
Putin walking on the maths,
but it's shoes.

1780
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:34,973
Come on,
dude.

1781
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:37,930
Putin would fuck up.
I would get,

1782
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:41,500
I would bet Putin would fuck up all the
world leaders if we had a round robin

1783
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:45,010
and then may contest with all world
leaders.

1784
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,780
Yeah.
But I got my money on Putin.

1785
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:49,270
Definitely the big powers must get out
of doing shit.

1786
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:51,100
Yeah.
He's going to win.

1787
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:54,760
He's an actual judo black belt.
Oh yeah,

1788
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:56,561
Bro.
Weird.

1789
01:15:56,561 --> 01:15:57,610
This looks like this bird.
Literally.

1790
01:15:57,611 --> 01:16:02,110
It looks like it's salutes in back.
Should Goddamn Putin bird knows his

1791
01:16:02,111 --> 01:16:03,660
place.
So live on the fucker.

1792
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:07,610
So look,
well I,

1793
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:11,230
that's gotta be fake.
How did they bend his wig over?

1794
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,513
You know,
man,

1795
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:16,060
the real question with a guy like Putin
is not like,

1796
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:18,010
how much does he control?
It's like,

1797
01:16:18,011 --> 01:16:20,350
what happens if that guy dies?
Oh yeah.

1798
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:25,351
Who takes over that power to the vacuum
of power behind that guy must be

1799
01:16:25,661 --> 01:16:26,494
stunning.

1800
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,970
They're a democracy,
right?

1801
01:16:27,971 --> 01:16:32,800
Russia sorta totalitarian developers,
they know they have some sort of a

1802
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:35,500
democracy.
They have some sort of election process.

1803
01:16:35,501 --> 01:16:37,330
Yeah.
Yeah.

1804
01:16:37,331 --> 01:16:39,190
It's President Gorbachev,
right.

1805
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:41,290
Present.
As long as you're not running against

1806
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:46,180
Putin seems to function fairly well.
He just took over again and he like,

1807
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:47,800
he was the president.
Then he went away.

1808
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:49,520
He just came back like,
fuck you guys.

1809
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:52,910
I took it over again.
I think he came back again in 2012 this

1810
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,540
has been back for a while.
Not that long.

1811
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:58,390
Yeah.
He was gone for a while and then some

1812
01:16:58,391 --> 01:17:00,700
other dude got into power and he's like,
hey man,

1813
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:03,830
you're the president and the guys are
okay.

1814
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:04,683
Okay.
Okay.

1815
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:06,660
Oh,
it's,

1816
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:07,660
it's,
look,

1817
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,980
it's not admirable.
That's what a

1818
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:11,030
guy from narcos did.
Right.

1819
01:17:11,031 --> 01:17:13,340
He wanted to be just in governments.
We run shit.

1820
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:15,200
Yeah.
What was his name?

1821
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:17,620
Um,
Escobar.

1822
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:18,550
Escobar.
Yeah.

1823
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:20,110
Pablo.
How good is that?

1824
01:17:20,111 --> 01:17:21,960
Accurate plays him.
Good name.

1825
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,280
What is his name?
That dude plays Pablo Escobar.

1826
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:25,390
God Damn,
it's good.

1827
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:27,460
That guy's good.
And he's smoking reefer all day.

1828
01:17:27,490 --> 01:17:29,500
All Day.
Just like a normal thing.

1829
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:32,590
I forget his name now.
Respect God.

1830
01:17:32,591 --> 01:17:33,490
That guy is good,
by the way,

1831
01:17:33,491 --> 01:17:34,870
if you're watching a,
uh,

1832
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:37,330
what's it called?
What's that name of the show?

1833
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,350
Narcos.
Narcos.

1834
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,740
When you're done,
make sure it's on July 18th and beyond

1835
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:45,260
to catch my Nunez.
Double special people are going to be on

1836
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:47,530
Netflix.
No sense of going back out to the apple

1837
01:17:47,531 --> 01:17:48,970
TV.
Oh my goodness.

1838
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,220
What Day is that again?
July 18th Joe.

1839
01:17:51,221 --> 01:17:53,320
It's Tuesday,
July 18th all over the world.

1840
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:55,600
Fantastic.
At midnight Pacific Time.

1841
01:17:55,990 --> 01:17:58,870
Are you going on the road at all?
No.

1842
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,730
No,
just fucking around coming up with

1843
01:18:00,731 --> 01:18:04,660
material in town in 15 looks like you're
having fun up there.

1844
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:06,880
Oh yeah.
Was it weird to not be on stage or did

1845
01:18:06,881 --> 01:18:09,430
you go on stage at all?
I went to one show in Phnom Penh,

1846
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:14,260
saw show get the itch and they asked me,
they knew me,

1847
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:15,760
they asked me to go up.
Why?

1848
01:18:15,761 --> 01:18:16,720
And you said No.
I was like,

1849
01:18:16,721 --> 01:18:18,620
no.
Well what?

1850
01:18:18,621 --> 01:18:20,200
I was like,
I really want to see what like the fully

1851
01:18:20,201 --> 01:18:22,750
long break would do those sorts of
breaking it up.

1852
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:24,250
Right.
Just for one set somewhere.

1853
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:27,070
It would be cool to perform in Cambodia
to mark that off of list.

1854
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,720
You know,
I like doing that.

1855
01:18:28,721 --> 01:18:30,280
That's my like bird watching kind of
stuff.

1856
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:33,550
Countries that performed in Cambodia.
Yeah.

1857
01:18:33,730 --> 01:18:35,110
Wow.
Um,

1858
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,251
but I was like,
no.

1859
01:18:36,251 --> 01:18:37,690
Also,
I didn't want to be going around for the

1860
01:18:37,691 --> 01:18:39,580
next two months with the fucking bomb on
my shoulders,

1861
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:41,170
like,
you know what I mean?

1862
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:44,680
I don't need the fucking walk around
with that as like my last set.

1863
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:46,930
Oh,
so if you went up there and eight Dick.

1864
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:47,591
Yeah.
And then I'm like,

1865
01:18:47,591 --> 01:18:48,780
have I started losing it?
Oh,

1866
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:50,500
gone.
I'm already nervous about that.

1867
01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:52,840
I don't want to fucking people like,
what are you doing?

1868
01:18:52,841 --> 01:18:54,010
I'm like,
I don't even know anymore.

1869
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:59,050
What was it like the first time on stage
after that long break?

1870
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:01,780
A little weird.
I tell the story.

1871
01:19:01,781 --> 01:19:04,720
So I at least base myself in like in
like,

1872
01:19:04,721 --> 01:19:06,010
uh,
things that happened,

1873
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:08,170
you know,
a narrative,

1874
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,060
a narrative,
less as expected.

1875
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:13,690
But then the next day I did a,
our gatsy was there and so Nashville,

1876
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:14,860
I was at,
that's when I came home.

1877
01:19:14,861 --> 01:19:17,380
So they wanted to do this show in a
third man records.

1878
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:19,150
So I just wrote them a letter and I was
like,

1879
01:19:19,151 --> 01:19:20,770
Hey,
if you still want to do that,

1880
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:22,633
mmm.

1881
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,510
Add it to the website.
I'll be home.

1882
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:25,530
I'll just come home.
I'll see it.

1883
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:26,610
Right.
I'll check it.

1884
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:29,310
Um,
so I did nate Barr,

1885
01:19:29,311 --> 01:19:30,810
gatsy and friends the next day.

1886
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:32,820
Uh,

1887
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:37,350
and that was just stand up and I was
like a little lost was weird.

1888
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,313
Yeah,
I was,

1889
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,260
it was Russ,
you're on the edges and I got to like 12

1890
01:19:40,261 --> 01:19:41,760
or 13 minutes.
I didn't want to do anything from the

1891
01:19:41,761 --> 01:19:43,800
special.
So I was just like,

1892
01:19:43,801 --> 01:19:45,810
what do I have new?
And I tried something that I thought

1893
01:19:45,811 --> 01:19:47,820
I've been on the road,
which wasn't much.

1894
01:19:47,821 --> 01:19:49,350
I kind of shut my brain off to that a
little bit.

1895
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:52,180
Like instead of like writing jokes,
but he was like,

1896
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:53,610
Nah,
a couple of topics.

1897
01:19:53,611 --> 01:19:54,780
And I was like,
but that's it.

1898
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:56,520
What if you had an awesome idea that
just came to you?

1899
01:19:56,521 --> 01:19:57,510
I didn't know where it should bother.
Right.

1900
01:19:57,511 --> 01:19:58,111
And toss it.
Yeah.

1901
01:19:58,111 --> 01:19:59,400
I wrote that like,
just an idea.

1902
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:00,530
Mm.
MMM.

1903
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,610
Like I saw two d this hasn't worked,
so to say it.

1904
01:20:02,611 --> 01:20:05,520
And I saw two dogs at the end of fucking
so many stray dogs out there.

1905
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:07,860
It's everywhere.
It's everywhere.

1906
01:20:07,861 --> 01:20:09,990
And eventually it ends up on menus to,
Ooh.

1907
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:12,060
Just cause it's like,
it's like fish man.

1908
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:13,740
They're everywhere.
Jesus.

1909
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,630
Yeah.
Why wouldn't you kill one to survive?

1910
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:17,730
Did you eat any dog?
I did not.

1911
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:18,840
Uh,
only because I,

1912
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:22,890
when I saw it on a menu,
it's called [inaudible] in East Timor.

1913
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:26,130
Um,
it was like a,

1914
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:28,530
they have this,
the Indonesian style of food,

1915
01:20:28,531 --> 01:20:31,320
which is while ruined.
So just like windows with like food left

1916
01:20:31,321 --> 01:20:33,690
out.
Do you know how like pizza places in New

1917
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:35,490
York,
he points to a slice and they'll take it

1918
01:20:35,491 --> 01:20:37,200
and warm it up.
So it's like that,

1919
01:20:37,201 --> 01:20:41,550
but they don't warm it up and it's meat.
So it's like bits of fish or chicken or

1920
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:43,440
beef.
And then that was like dog.

1921
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:46,950
So if it was hot out of the oven,
I might've gone for it,

1922
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:49,950
but not leftover cold.

1923
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:53,670
Cold Dog over rice.
You look good though.

1924
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,830
It looked good.
I had ask her four times what she said.

1925
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:59,130
I had to keep checking my like
translator and I was like,

1926
01:20:59,131 --> 01:21:00,270
no,
I think you're saying it wrong.

1927
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:01,411
She was like,
yeah,

1928
01:21:01,411 --> 01:21:02,880
she had an act out like walk,
walk,

1929
01:21:02,881 --> 01:21:04,470
walk.
Now that's not a dog.

1930
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:06,173
Ruff.
Ruff.

1931
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:11,040
I just do chicken trying to do dog.
My friend Steven Rinella was telling me

1932
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:16,041
that they regarded as a hot food.
Not necessarily even just meaning spicy.

1933
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:20,520
Oh really?
A dog is like a hot food.

1934
01:21:20,521 --> 01:21:22,560
Meaning like there's like there's
something to it.

1935
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:28,220
It's like there's a special energy that
you get from eating dog.

1936
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:32,190
Yeah,
that's dark.

1937
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:36,330
I could say that because they seem more
like intelligent,

1938
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,880
you know,
they have seem to have feelings.

1939
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:42,030
Jesus hot food,
like human meat.

1940
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:46,110
You came their souls.
He did a show with the sky where they,

1941
01:21:46,111 --> 01:21:48,150
uh,
they shot in eight a coyote,

1942
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:50,370
you know,
they cook the coyote like they would

1943
01:21:50,371 --> 01:21:54,330
cook like wild game and they uh,
opened it up,

1944
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,520
they burned off all the hair and then
they split it and threw it over like a

1945
01:21:59,521 --> 01:22:03,900
great and cooked it on over coals just
through some seasoning on it and it's

1946
01:22:03,901 --> 01:22:07,470
crackling and cooking and then they just
cut pieces of this coyote off and it's

1947
01:22:07,471 --> 01:22:09,330
like,
I was watching this going to,

1948
01:22:09,331 --> 01:22:13,110
why is it so disturbing when we choose
one animal?

1949
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:15,510
Oh yeah.
Why is that so disturbing?

1950
01:22:15,511 --> 01:22:17,490
Like,
why is that coyote any different than a

1951
01:22:17,491 --> 01:22:19,530
pig?
Which is totally normal.

1952
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:20,770
It's just pet wise.
That's,

1953
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:22,570
I think it's all boils down to,
I mean,

1954
01:22:22,571 --> 01:22:23,820
you don't have that.
You don't have it.

1955
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:25,920
It's even weirder than that because
nobody's got a pet.

1956
01:22:25,921 --> 01:22:27,930
Coyote did.
I saw something.

1957
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,560
Yeah,
it's close enough to your dog.

1958
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:34,650
Fuck your dog and get it pregnant.
Yeah.

1959
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,760
I was like,
oh we don't like that.

1960
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:38,250
Yeah.
It reminds me of it's,

1961
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:43,140
it's so close to a dog.
It's so close to a dog that if it fucks

1962
01:22:43,141 --> 01:22:45,660
your dog it'll make puppies.
Yeah.

1963
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:52,680
I went to a
rooster fights that seem so crazy.

1964
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:54,220
Does that seem so crazy?
Yeah.

1965
01:22:56,010 --> 01:23:00,630
Imagine if a chicken can fuck your
parakeet and make something still pair

1966
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:04,380
Katie Kate and gets to the parrot cage.
It's fucked the shit out of him.

1967
01:23:04,650 --> 01:23:07,210
A chicken.
A parrot's cage would be hilarious.

1968
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,290
Yeah.
The different species.

1969
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:10,870
Yeah,
but she makes it look like the same

1970
01:23:10,871 --> 01:23:13,380
thing.
Chicken just shit out of that parent.

1971
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:14,980
Oh,
that whole time you thought you had a

1972
01:23:14,981 --> 01:23:17,950
girl parent,
you know the chicken laying eggs.

1973
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:20,110
Chicken gets in there plug too.
Shit.

1974
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:23,620
Roosters are ruthless man.
I don't have any,

1975
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:26,650
I don't have any roosters.
But we were really worried when we're

1976
01:23:26,651 --> 01:23:28,800
getting chickens.
Yeah.

1977
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:31,920
That when I was growing up but he wants
it to go away cause I made it so I had

1978
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:34,330
to bring him into the garage every night
cause we got the neighbors the fucking

1979
01:23:34,331 --> 01:23:35,500
middle of the numbers and they're just
like,

1980
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:38,320
what in the flaws for Sun up?
Yeah.

1981
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:39,910
It's not set up it's way before it's on
up.

1982
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,350
Really.
They can sense it coming.

1983
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,233
Oh it's cons.

1984
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:43,333
Oh

1985
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:47,260
yeah.
Just screaming next to your neighbor.

1986
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:48,790
Like what the fuck?
Yeah.

1987
01:23:48,791 --> 01:23:53,110
We were in Santa Barbara and some guy
had one but he had it like

1988
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,460
thousand 2000 yards away.
Really?

1989
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:58,900
Yeah,
it was far.

1990
01:23:58,901 --> 01:24:02,420
But you could still hear it but it was
kind of cool because you ain't here.

1991
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,470
It wasn't obnoxious.
Like if it was right next door,

1992
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:08,870
like it was way across this canyon.
I was like wow,

1993
01:24:08,871 --> 01:24:10,940
that's kinda cool.
Like that won't even bother me.

1994
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:13,220
I got used to it being out there.
All those countries,

1995
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:15,890
they just had them around.
So wherever you are asleep and they were

1996
01:24:15,891 --> 01:24:17,180
thin walls,
he would just hear him,

1997
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,770
dude,
I want to get peacocks.

1998
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:20,210
Cool.
We had peacocks.

1999
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:23,450
I want to get pet peacocks.
I'm going to go full hunters Thompson

2000
01:24:23,451 --> 01:24:26,030
and have some pet peacocks.
I had to bury one of them.

2001
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:29,840
Did you fucking reaches head of the
lattice work that tried to like eat the

2002
01:24:29,841 --> 01:24:31,940
grass right outside the Fox.
He was waiting for him.

2003
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:33,500
Took his head,
left the body.

2004
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:38,501
Inside foxes are clever.
Very clever.

2005
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,540
I went to a rooster fight in uh,
in Timor-Leste day.

2006
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:42,860
Did you really?
Yeah.

2007
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:45,590
In terms of like what we accept and what
they will,

2008
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:46,940
you know,
different things too.

2009
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:50,490
They're doing that shit and encino or
they really so,

2010
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:52,520
right.
I know place.

2011
01:24:52,910 --> 01:24:54,550
Wow.
Then you can go to,

2012
01:24:54,551 --> 01:24:56,720
there's,
there's places I wanted to go down for

2013
01:24:56,721 --> 01:24:58,910
sure.
There's places in the valley that might

2014
01:24:58,911 --> 01:25:01,350
as well be Mexico,
like you said,

2015
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:03,860
one neighborhoods.
I've never seen the actual fights,

2016
01:25:03,861 --> 01:25:06,410
but I've seen the fighting roosters.
I've seen pens.

2017
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:10,430
There's a hundred is a dude that I know.
Who knows the dude who's got like a

2018
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:12,080
hundred of them in his backyard.
Wow.

2019
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:13,480
Yeah.
Quite fighting roosters.

2020
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:14,450
Yeah.
Wow.

2021
01:25:14,570 --> 01:25:16,550
A lot of these like Mexican
neighborhoods,

2022
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:19,610
it's like super normal.
They don't view it as weird at all.

2023
01:25:19,611 --> 01:25:20,960
Where I saw it,
they were like,

2024
01:25:20,961 --> 01:25:21,800
you're not taking pictures.
I'm like,

2025
01:25:21,801 --> 01:25:22,611
oh,
I didn't want to like,

2026
01:25:22,611 --> 01:25:23,480
you know,
get your guys in trouble.

2027
01:25:23,481 --> 01:25:24,800
Like,
why did it get us in trouble?

2028
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:27,290
What do you mean we're outside in those
countries.

2029
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:30,500
It's not bad at all.
The general owns the fucking ring where

2030
01:25:30,501 --> 01:25:32,390
they all put to it.
It's hilarious.

2031
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:36,560
But then if you can do that,
then you can justify dogs like,

2032
01:25:36,561 --> 01:25:38,360
well,
what do we do about dogs?

2033
01:25:38,361 --> 01:25:39,680
Well,
dogs are a little smarter.

2034
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:41,850
It's a little different.
There should raise out there,

2035
01:25:41,851 --> 01:25:43,530
right?
They are straight a's.

2036
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:48,520
California authorities sees over 7,000
birds in the largest cockfighting busts

2037
01:25:48,521 --> 01:25:49,760
in US history.
Wow.

2038
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:53,240
Jesus Christ took three weeks ago.
Jesus Christ in the valley.

2039
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:54,620
[inaudible] valley.
See,

2040
01:25:54,621 --> 01:25:57,890
I told you
I'm making this up.

2041
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,090
That's Meth town.
Anyway.

2042
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:02,420
You say meth town.
I say a rooster town.

2043
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:05,780
Zip.
Gasser.

2044
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:06,520
Slashers.
Yeah.

2045
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:09,050
They put these razors on the back of the
back claw,

2046
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,210
isn't it?
I mean,

2047
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:15,350
they give him steroids really for the
animals.

2048
01:26:15,351 --> 01:26:17,510
We're also recovered.
I didn't see any of that.

2049
01:26:17,511 --> 01:26:19,730
Oranges and steroids.
They got juiced up.

2050
01:26:19,731 --> 01:26:22,640
Chicken's ready to fuck you up.
Can you imagine?

2051
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:25,310
I want to like do a vice land piece on
that.

2052
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:28,790
Watch these dudes shoot their fucking
chickens up with steroids and have them

2053
01:26:28,791 --> 01:26:30,920
go out there.
I'll look and hulk out

2054
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:37,250
700 birds.
They went back to the same spot,

2055
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:38,220
but here's the thing,
man,

2056
01:26:38,250 --> 01:26:40,370
it 10 years earlier,
it doesn't bother.

2057
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:44,090
It doesn't bother you or me like it
would if it was dogs.

2058
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:44,991
No,
it doesn't,

2059
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:46,010
but I'll be out.
Yeah.

2060
01:26:46,050 --> 01:26:47,330
No,
they don't look like us.

2061
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:49,070
Not nearly,
but I was.

2062
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:52,070
I thought it would be like really
barbaric until you see it and you're

2063
01:26:52,071 --> 01:26:52,431
like,
oh,

2064
01:26:52,431 --> 01:26:53,510
that's not really that bad at all.

2065
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:55,190
I've seen dogfights.
I was in New Orleans.

2066
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:56,840
I saw a dog fight.
You did?

2067
01:26:56,860 --> 01:26:58,220
Yeah.
Impromptu.

2068
01:26:58,221 --> 01:26:59,240
I don't know if I was out with my
friends.

2069
01:26:59,241 --> 01:27:01,880
It was a pit.
One fucking pit bull came in and another

2070
01:27:01,881 --> 01:27:04,160
pit bull came into this pit and we're
like,

2071
01:27:04,161 --> 01:27:06,470
what's going on?
And they did it and it was,

2072
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,070
I mean vicious.
It was vicious.

2073
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:13,130
These cockfights are just like,
they fly each other a couple times and

2074
01:27:13,131 --> 01:27:15,530
then one gets like woozy need and then
falls.

2075
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:17,570
It's a cockfight room.
Yeah.

2076
01:27:17,571 --> 01:27:19,730
That looks like why inside?
Huh?

2077
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:24,910
See the dog fighting thing is the dog
fighting thing to those people that mean

2078
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:30,020
the people that believe in it.
I'm sure they would argue with you that

2079
01:27:30,021 --> 01:27:32,430
there's no difference between dog
fighting and rooster.

2080
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:35,240
Probably not.
Most people think there is because dogs

2081
01:27:35,241 --> 01:27:36,510
are smarter.
It was just,

2082
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,930
but it was also bloodier.
Oh yeah.

2083
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,260
It was just like more like them ripping
each other's fucking everything out.

2084
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,920
Yeah.
Th Th th th the father fights of 30

2085
01:27:45,921 --> 01:27:48,470
seconds and you don't even see blood
most of the time it's just,

2086
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:50,030
it's just there.
Yeah.

2087
01:27:52,670 --> 01:27:53,690
But,
but yeah,

2088
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:56,120
in terms of animal,
if I saw a dead animal on the side of

2089
01:27:56,121 --> 01:27:57,950
the road,
what would probably be more of a dog or

2090
01:27:57,951 --> 01:27:59,240
a rooster?
It's on youtube.

2091
01:27:59,241 --> 01:28:02,290
They have cockfighting on Youtube Cup.
Oh,

2092
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:05,120
the world's Slasher Cup,
dude,

2093
01:28:05,121 --> 01:28:06,920
I dvr this.
That guy's gonna hit the other one in

2094
01:28:06,921 --> 01:28:09,290
the back to move him or he's going to
pick him up and throw him towards the

2095
01:28:09,291 --> 01:28:11,060
other one.
Is that what they did that they're not

2096
01:28:11,061 --> 01:28:12,610
going at each other yet,
so they have to really throw them

2097
01:28:12,611 --> 01:28:14,600
towards each other.
So most of the time if they put a

2098
01:28:14,601 --> 01:28:15,970
rooster near rooster,
he's got,

2099
01:28:16,210 --> 01:28:17,450
he's got a tight,
yeah,

2100
01:28:17,451 --> 01:28:18,920
they'll come out to each other.
They're probably like,

2101
01:28:18,921 --> 01:28:20,990
what the fuck is going on?
So in their back foot,

2102
01:28:20,991 --> 01:28:21,890
here we go.
Oh.

2103
01:28:21,891 --> 01:28:26,891
Then they go at each other.
Oh my God.

2104
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:28,710
What will start pecking the other ones
soon.

2105
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:33,740
So they're catching each other with
these feet and that happens a normal way

2106
01:28:34,271 --> 01:28:36,930
of fighting to say the other ones that
blocked that one.

2107
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,010
That's fuck God.
Yeah,

2108
01:28:38,070 --> 01:28:39,090
he's down.
It's dad.

2109
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:41,240
They stopped that.
God,

2110
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:44,640
they must be both mangled though.
Yeah.

2111
01:28:44,641 --> 01:28:46,770
He gets tasteless.
Little blood pack had them.

2112
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:50,600
The Ref has to choose when it's over.
He's called,

2113
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:51,930
that's called it.
Wow.

2114
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:55,560
That rooster got fucked up.
They'll fast.

2115
01:28:55,561 --> 01:28:56,394
That is,
yeah.

2116
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:58,920
So you don't even see really how it's
like barbaric.

2117
01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:00,660
It's just quick and over.
Do you think that well,

2118
01:29:00,661 --> 01:29:02,210
yeah,
because covering a little strap

2119
01:29:02,290 --> 01:29:03,390
one tonight.
Today.

2120
01:29:03,450 --> 01:29:05,970
Oh yeah.
So when I saw the winner or the owner of

2121
01:29:05,971 --> 01:29:07,170
the winter,
it gets to eat the loser.

2122
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:10,410
They take it home with them on their
bike and they're eating chicken tonight.

2123
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:12,810
I went weird.
And do you think that rooster fights

2124
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:15,510
again?
I saw them selling a rooster up.

2125
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:17,610
I don't.
Jesus Christ,

2126
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:20,910
they said he gets two months off,
gets to live a fun life for a while and

2127
01:29:20,911 --> 01:29:22,230
then I'll be back and fighting.
But he didn't.

2128
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:24,120
So sometimes the winners get,
nothing happened to them.

2129
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:26,250
Sometimes they get a little fuck to
Jesus.

2130
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:28,890
Sometimes they both die.
Wow.

2131
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:30,870
These are the rooster houses.
Wow.

2132
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:32,760
That's in Kentucky.
Hold on.

2133
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,980
Shit.
But wait a minute.

2134
01:29:34,981 --> 01:29:38,370
That looks like a dog house.
That looks like what they do with pets

2135
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:40,260
because they do.
Is that really roosters?

2136
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:43,280
That's crazy.
There's a on top of it then place under

2137
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:44,040
for the rains.

2138
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:44,910
Yeah,
I guess so.

2139
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:46,540
The places where they,
um,

2140
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:50,070
they fight dogs.
They'll have like a giant yard and

2141
01:29:50,071 --> 01:29:55,040
they'll have like 10 dogs plus out there
on chains and they're all connected.

2142
01:29:55,060 --> 01:29:58,860
These little tiny houses just like that.
It's really creepy because they're,

2143
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:03,000
they're not really dogs.
I mean their dogs in the sense of

2144
01:30:03,001 --> 01:30:05,250
they're at the actual animal.
They are his dogs.

2145
01:30:05,251 --> 01:30:07,740
But there are these things like at all,
no,

2146
01:30:07,741 --> 01:30:11,020
there's no pet to them.
They're these things that had been there

2147
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:14,880
just bred to fight and I'm sure that
they can handle them.

2148
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:17,190
You know,
I'm sure there's like a few commands

2149
01:30:17,191 --> 01:30:19,890
they understand,
but their life is not about being pat

2150
01:30:19,891 --> 01:30:22,830
and love climbing on the bed.
He's army.

2151
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:23,693
What's,
what's their name?

2152
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:26,700
What do they call?
Jamie was one with the tickets cut off.

2153
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:29,400
Oh yeah.
We'll just call play is trying to fight

2154
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:33,300
their Unix,
but that's not what they call

2155
01:30:33,301 --> 01:30:34,970
themselves,
but

2156
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:37,230
I don't really know.

2157
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:38,670
God Damn it.
Yeah.

2158
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:40,170
Fuck that.
She needs to come back.

2159
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:44,720
It takes a while.
This ansel and sally the unsullied.

2160
01:30:44,721 --> 01:30:45,650
Yeah,
yeah,

2161
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:46,800
yeah.
That's what those dogs are there.

2162
01:30:46,801 --> 01:30:47,770
Like ansel.
Hmm.

2163
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,380
Yeah.
Well,

2164
01:30:49,381 --> 01:30:51,420
they just,
they have their dicks and balls though

2165
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,820
the unsolid.
The problem with those guys is they've

2166
01:30:53,821 --> 01:30:55,860
been neutered so they can't fight that
good cause they don't have any

2167
01:30:55,861 --> 01:30:59,070
testosterone.
These dogs have everything there ready

2168
01:30:59,071 --> 01:31:01,580
to rock and roll.
They just live to fight and that,

2169
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:04,740
that moment that they get to fight,
it's like the only thing they're looking

2170
01:31:04,741 --> 01:31:07,860
forward to and they were brief and like
really miserable existence.

2171
01:31:07,861 --> 01:31:12,120
So the more they exercise them,
the more they just train them and get

2172
01:31:12,121 --> 01:31:14,220
them ramped up.
They're just prepping them for this one

2173
01:31:14,221 --> 01:31:16,620
moment where he gets to do what he
actually wants to do,

2174
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,990
what he's made to do in the side of his
fault.

2175
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:23,760
It's like that dog is bred that way.
They've encouraged that behavior like

2176
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:28,650
generation after generation,
like careful selection calling dogs that

2177
01:31:28,651 --> 01:31:32,070
don't fit the criteria.
Like it's one of the reasons why people

2178
01:31:32,071 --> 01:31:34,710
love pit bulls so much.
Like once you have a pit bull,

2179
01:31:34,711 --> 01:31:37,650
other dogs seem so dumb because they're
so smart.

2180
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:40,260
They're so tuned into you and they're
like,

2181
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:44,250
like I remember squeaky fromme.
She was like a little demon.

2182
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:46,830
She was like tuned in to me and she
would lock onto me,

2183
01:31:46,831 --> 01:31:51,831
but if any other dog got anywhere near
her and tried to take my attention,

2184
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:53,390
she would kill it in front of me.
Really?

2185
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:56,430
She would just want it dead.
It's like get the fuck away from him.

2186
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:57,450
Like Shit.
Yeah,

2187
01:31:57,450 --> 01:31:59,560
they just,
they're very intense and tuned into you

2188
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,620
and a lot of people like it.
Well she,

2189
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:02,740
I got her,
she was already,

2190
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,450
she was a pound dog.

2191
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,270
I got her,
she was like 11 months old and she was

2192
01:32:07,271 --> 01:32:08,560
cut up.
She had,

2193
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,690
she had definitely been in some sort of
a fight,

2194
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,520
whether it's an organized one or
something,

2195
01:32:12,521 --> 01:32:14,500
but she was a mess from the moment I got
her.

2196
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:18,160
She was just such a cute little dog and
loved you to death.

2197
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:20,290
Just couldn't,
couldn't leave you alone.

2198
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:22,390
Want to sit right next to you.
I'll put her head in your lab.

2199
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:25,480
Just a big sweetie.
Just the sweetest dog ever.

2200
01:32:25,481 --> 01:32:27,850
But like these eyes,
there's like the,

2201
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:31,810
they had like,
I'm ready to die for you eyes so that

2202
01:32:31,811 --> 01:32:33,250
the one you had to put down.
Yeah,

2203
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:35,410
the rest.
Killing my other dog.

2204
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

2205
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:40,570
It's not good.
Fuck yeah,

2206
01:32:40,571 --> 01:32:41,440
there,
um,

2207
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:44,610
the nature is not their fault.
I mean they,

2208
01:32:44,611 --> 01:32:47,410
they've,
they've essentially been selected over

2209
01:32:47,411 --> 01:32:47,951
many,
many,

2210
01:32:47,951 --> 01:32:50,350
many,
many generations to be incredibly dog

2211
01:32:50,351 --> 01:32:55,351
aggressive and incredibly prey driven
and almost impervious to reacting to

2212
01:32:56,081 --> 01:32:56,914
pain.

2213
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:00,340
That's what's so terrifying about them
is that they don't care.

2214
01:33:00,370 --> 01:33:00,941
They don't,
they don't,

2215
01:33:00,941 --> 01:33:03,460
they like to fight.
They're not worried about getting hurt.

2216
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:05,710
They looking forward to this.
They want to do it.

2217
01:33:05,711 --> 01:33:07,420
They're wagging their tail and they're
biting each other.

2218
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:10,240
It's crazy.
They wag their tails,

2219
01:33:10,570 --> 01:33:14,500
they're locked faces on each other and
their tails are wagging back and forth.

2220
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:18,910
Like they're having the greatest time.
I saw a thing for some like,

2221
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,780
oh see county fair.
They train their dogs new tricks and

2222
01:33:22,781 --> 01:33:26,410
shit and they said they've gotten to the
point where this reminds me of this,

2223
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:31,540
where the treat they get for,
for crashing the frisbee eventually

2224
01:33:31,541 --> 01:33:34,840
becomes the Frisbee.
So like they're trying to catch like,

2225
01:33:34,841 --> 01:33:36,040
cool,
I got to grab that Frisbee.

2226
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:37,600
Thank you.
And that I could throw it again.

2227
01:33:37,601 --> 01:33:39,070
So like I got through about the Frisbee
again,

2228
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:41,530
you know,
instead of like I get the Frisbee so I

2229
01:33:41,531 --> 01:33:42,790
can get this fucking piece of meat.

2230
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:43,601
Right,
right,

2231
01:33:43,601 --> 01:33:44,920
right.
So it seems like those dogs too.

2232
01:33:44,921 --> 01:33:45,521
It's like,
Oh,

2233
01:33:45,521 --> 01:33:47,560
I did the task and thank you for letting
me do that.

2234
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:48,670
Yeah,
that's what I wanted to do.

2235
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,490
They get those.
I'm working dogs.

2236
01:33:51,491 --> 01:33:54,160
You ever been around like a real working
German German shepherd?

2237
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:55,240
No,
dude,

2238
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:58,600
there's so intense.
They'll look a live wire.

2239
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:03,400
First of all,
they're like a real big German shepherd

2240
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:08,460
is probably like,
I want to say like 90 pounds.

2241
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,620
Like let's Google.
What's a big German shepherd?

2242
01:34:11,621 --> 01:34:14,740
It's not the hugest dog in the world.
They're not like a mass deaf,

2243
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:20,310
but they are so fast and there's so
taught just like fucking ready,

2244
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:26,500
ready to go and looking at you.
And this dude was a demonstrating

2245
01:34:26,501 --> 01:34:27,400
different,
uh,

2246
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:29,230
he's a,
he trains dogs for the police

2247
01:34:29,231 --> 01:34:31,510
department.
He was demonstrating different things.

2248
01:34:31,511 --> 01:34:33,640
71 pounds is a big one.
Oh,

2249
01:34:33,641 --> 01:34:34,270
adult male.

2250
01:34:34,270 --> 01:34:35,650
88 pounds.
Say Yeah.

2251
01:34:35,890 --> 01:34:38,260
Close to 90 pounds,
attacked by one of those were in a suit

2252
01:34:38,261 --> 01:34:39,910
once.
Dude,

2253
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:41,380
it's so strong.
Oh,

2254
01:34:41,381 --> 01:34:44,170
there so strong.
They just keep regular in your hand

2255
01:34:44,171 --> 01:34:46,150
until you're on the ground.
They're just so,

2256
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:49,690
they're so fast there and you've got to
think there's so fast.

2257
01:34:49,691 --> 01:34:50,770
They're on you.
They let him go.

2258
01:34:50,771 --> 01:34:55,060
Like jump now think that right.
That's a 90 pound animal.

2259
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:58,160
Now think of a wolf double.
Oh Wow.

2260
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:00,800
Double that.
And have it more athletic,

2261
01:35:00,801 --> 01:35:02,780
stronger,
much harder bite.

2262
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:04,850
It was seen a wolf in the wild.
No,

2263
01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:06,800
almost.
I think I might have,

2264
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:08,510
but it was,
it was so dark.

2265
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,460
I could only see that it was some sort
of a dog,

2266
01:35:10,461 --> 01:35:13,580
like creature that was running across
the dirt road ahead of us while we were

2267
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:15,680
in hunting camp waiting to get picked
up.

2268
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,210
Whoa.
Yeah.

2269
01:35:17,870 --> 01:35:18,703
Nervous.

2270
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:20,120
Yeah,
a little bit.

2271
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:22,310
Yeah.
When you're standing outside in grizzly

2272
01:35:22,311 --> 01:35:25,940
country and there's wolves,
so you can't wander off to go pitch no

2273
01:35:25,941 --> 01:35:27,800
fucking way.
You're off to be together.

2274
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:30,800
You have to be together and you both
have to be paying attention and you

2275
01:35:30,801 --> 01:35:33,830
should talk and since it's out,
it's late at night.

2276
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:35,660
You don't have to even worry about
whispering.

2277
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:37,190
Like you're not trying to,
like,

2278
01:35:37,191 --> 01:35:39,230
you're not trying to scare anything.
You're trying to let things know that

2279
01:35:39,231 --> 01:35:40,230
you're there know.
Right.

2280
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:42,890
So todd,
I surprised by it.

2281
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:45,200
Not surprised by you.
They hear you come in,

2282
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:48,680
they can avoid you if they choose to,
but if something decides that it's going

2283
01:35:48,681 --> 01:35:50,650
to come towards you,
like cause this size,

2284
01:35:50,670 --> 01:35:51,980
these wolves.
Damn Dude,

2285
01:35:51,981 --> 01:35:55,320
if you saw a wolf in the woods,
I wouldn't even be trust avenue.

2286
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:56,420
Trust.
That with thing was dead.

2287
01:35:57,650 --> 01:35:58,520
I'd be like,
ah man,

2288
01:35:58,521 --> 01:36:00,320
at this size of these things,
wow,

2289
01:36:00,590 --> 01:36:01,860
these are enormous wolves.

2290
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,500
The dead one,
the one of the top middle.

2291
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:04,910
And you know,
it's really interesting,

2292
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:07,760
these wolves that you're seeing,
although they're all just wolves,

2293
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:11,960
these wolves are wolves from Canada and
it's one of the reasons why they're so

2294
01:36:11,961 --> 01:36:14,570
big.
One of the reasons why they've been so

2295
01:36:14,571 --> 01:36:19,040
devastating to elk populations and deer
populations that was got deer in his

2296
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:22,750
mouth.
Half a second leg is the leg with the,

2297
01:36:22,900 --> 01:36:25,250
ah dude.
He looks thin too.

2298
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:29,150
They're so powerful.
They're just incredibly powerful,

2299
01:36:29,151 --> 01:36:32,360
incredibly cutting killers that act in
packs.

2300
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:34,490
I love the snow.
They love it.

2301
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:38,270
They can do shit in the snow where other
animals are fucked.

2302
01:36:38,271 --> 01:36:42,530
Like they can run through the snow.
They thrive and ridiculous cold

2303
01:36:42,531 --> 01:36:46,220
environments because that's when the
other animals are vulnerable and they

2304
01:36:46,221 --> 01:36:50,910
can wreck havoc on them.
There are crazy animal man if,

2305
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:51,890
but they look like a dog.

2306
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:56,030
So we have this weird connection with
them where we think of them as dogs like

2307
01:36:56,031 --> 01:36:58,880
fits our friend.
It's mister [inaudible] the same way.

2308
01:36:58,881 --> 01:37:00,500
Exactly.
I mean they do look nice.

2309
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:02,360
Yeah.
And when you'd see him alone and you're

2310
01:37:02,361 --> 01:37:02,661
like,
Oh,

2311
01:37:02,661 --> 01:37:03,560
if that was,
you know,

2312
01:37:03,561 --> 01:37:05,990
with no scale off,
if I can remember,

2313
01:37:05,991 --> 01:37:07,490
I'll tell you this bit I'm doing about
it,

2314
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:11,600
about wolves.
Cause a real encounter I had with a dog

2315
01:37:11,601 --> 01:37:14,150
and a wolf or a dog met a wolf for the
first time.

2316
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:15,230
Oh really?
Yeah.

2317
01:37:15,230 --> 01:37:16,670
I'll tell you later.
But it's,

2318
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:20,200
it's um,
that animal is not the same animal.

2319
01:37:20,201 --> 01:37:22,490
It used to be here.
They killed a bunch of wolves.

2320
01:37:22,491 --> 01:37:25,340
So they had to reintroduce wolves to try
to bring the population back.

2321
01:37:25,490 --> 01:37:26,031
Oh really?
Well,

2322
01:37:26,031 --> 01:37:28,520
when they reintroduced wolves,
they brought him in from Canada.

2323
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:32,720
Canadian moves her bigger,
they're Canadian.

2324
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:36,530
People are bigger.
It's like it's a polar bears.

2325
01:37:36,531 --> 01:37:38,000
It's a fucking hardier climbing up
there,

2326
01:37:38,001 --> 01:37:38,900
man.
You get a different,

2327
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:40,780
different sort of an animal.
Oh,

2328
01:37:40,781 --> 01:37:42,620
you got the wrong one.
They got a big ass wolf.

2329
01:37:42,621 --> 01:37:45,290
It was way bigger.
So you can't ever just like go off

2330
01:37:45,291 --> 01:37:47,900
because they'll see,
they'll wait for you to be alone while

2331
01:37:47,901 --> 01:37:51,170
they definitely could if they chose to.
Most of the time they avoid the fuck out

2332
01:37:51,171 --> 01:37:53,390
of people.
They seem to know that if they fuck up

2333
01:37:53,391 --> 01:37:56,460
and do something to people,
then will it start coming and then

2334
01:37:56,461 --> 01:37:58,620
everybody dies.
Like they're smart enough to kind of

2335
01:37:58,621 --> 01:38:02,310
understand that they are not smart.
Like they wouldn't,

2336
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:05,580
you know,
they wouldn't do anything that you would

2337
01:38:05,581 --> 01:38:07,860
think would be extraordinary from an
animal.

2338
01:38:07,861 --> 01:38:09,660
It's not like they have like superhuman
powers,

2339
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:14,990
but they have an unusual ability to plan
and coordinate and they talk to each

2340
01:38:15,211 --> 01:38:17,460
other.
They yell out and talk to each other and

2341
01:38:17,461 --> 01:38:19,770
they,
they give locations and they all kind of

2342
01:38:19,771 --> 01:38:23,970
intuitively understand what the task is.
But when they're operating together,

2343
01:38:23,971 --> 01:38:26,010
it's like,
it's pretty stunning to watch,

2344
01:38:26,011 --> 01:38:27,420
man.
I've watched a bunch of videos.

2345
01:38:27,421 --> 01:38:28,980
I never,
never in real life obviously,

2346
01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:32,460
but a bunch of videos of them
coordinating like an attack on,

2347
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:34,680
on animals.
Dude.

2348
01:38:34,681 --> 01:38:35,400
It's amazing.
Like

2349
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:38,710
we heard were I had a um,
which campsite?

2350
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:41,380
Malleable Creek State Park.
You heard coyotes or wolves.

2351
01:38:41,410 --> 01:38:42,940
Coyotes.
Um,

2352
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:45,530
but I just liked the way they were like
sort of talking to each other too.

2353
01:38:46,090 --> 01:38:51,090
We saw a skunk or first we s we sort of
smelled one and we heard to coyote is

2354
01:38:51,501 --> 01:38:54,970
kinda like yelping and we're like that
they got sprayed by a skunk.

2355
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:56,200
Wow.
For sure.

2356
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:57,880
We're just filling this and we have no
idea.

2357
01:38:57,910 --> 01:39:01,330
But it's really seemed like that hearing
them or like just a couple of them.

2358
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:04,930
And then later we saw skunk,
um,

2359
01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:07,720
tried to spray us,
didn't have much and we think that's the

2360
01:39:07,721 --> 01:39:11,350
same skunk that like sprayed out and now
he's got nothing left in the tank.

2361
01:39:11,890 --> 01:39:13,510
Does that work like that?
I don't know.

2362
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:16,810
This is what we all think.
And then like a little bit later,

2363
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:19,300
um,
it's just kind of kind of like came with

2364
01:39:19,301 --> 01:39:20,550
us but didn't like he tried to spray.

2365
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:22,220
Got the dog.
He's stopped my friend Mervis as you

2366
01:39:22,221 --> 01:39:26,770
know Mervis a yeah,
they got his dog but just like a little

2367
01:39:26,771 --> 01:39:28,930
bit just bid it.
No,

2368
01:39:28,931 --> 01:39:30,490
just like with a little bit of like
spray,

2369
01:39:30,491 --> 01:39:32,680
but like not much.
Not enough where it's like terrible.

2370
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:36,480
It was bad.
And then we heard like 10 or 15 coyotes

2371
01:39:36,490 --> 01:39:38,690
all howling.
Don't want you to write this concept.

2372
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:39,461
Predator.
Yeah.

2373
01:39:39,461 --> 01:39:41,140
He was coming out with bared teeth and
stuff.

2374
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:43,060
I had a skunk trying to get into my
chicken coop.

2375
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:43,631
Really?
Yeah.

2376
01:39:43,631 --> 01:39:44,620
And then I read about it.
I'm like,

2377
01:39:44,621 --> 01:39:46,180
that's one of the things they eat.
They'll eat chicken.

2378
01:39:46,181 --> 01:39:47,530
I make sense.
Yeah.

2379
01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:49,240
Yeah.
That's the sprays for self defense,

2380
01:39:49,241 --> 01:39:50,440
not offense.
Wow.

2381
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:54,730
But they'll fuck you up.
I just fucked up by a skunk.

2382
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:57,340
Like you fucked you up and you smell
like shit.

2383
01:39:59,710 --> 01:40:00,310
Heal your wounds.
It,

2384
01:40:00,310 --> 01:40:01,360
nobody wants to help you.
Yeah.

2385
01:40:01,361 --> 01:40:03,100
I mean,
imagine if like you got a fist fight

2386
01:40:03,101 --> 01:40:06,130
with a skunk in your backyard and he's
Zaps you and then bites and fuck out of

2387
01:40:06,131 --> 01:40:09,010
here up and rabies.
He jumps over your fence and you run

2388
01:40:09,011 --> 01:40:10,630
inside,
you're covered in blood and you're like,

2389
01:40:10,631 --> 01:40:13,230
oh my God,
this skunk bit the fuck out of Wesley's

2390
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:16,930
out of here.
Get away.

2391
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,730
Didn't even know she doesn't even care.
Oh my God.

2392
01:40:18,820 --> 01:40:21,310
You have to wash yourself outside.
It's cold outside.

2393
01:40:21,370 --> 01:40:23,950
Get Out.
You saw like skunk.

2394
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,300
Oh my God,
I'm never going to clean this up.

2395
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,190
Oh my God,
this house didn't smell like forever.

2396
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:28,860
I'm so mad at you.
I'm Gee,

2397
01:40:28,870 --> 01:40:32,620
you're mad at me.
If I got fucked up by a skunk.

2398
01:40:33,130 --> 01:40:36,370
[inaudible] skunk biting your deck.
It's a skunk.

2399
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:38,861
Oh,
you're like this.

2400
01:40:38,861 --> 01:40:41,140
You love fucking creatures.
Or my trip,

2401
01:40:41,290 --> 01:40:43,030
I saw Komodo dragons.
Ooh,

2402
01:40:43,090 --> 01:40:44,270
in the flesh.
Yeah,

2403
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,600
out in the wild.
You went hunting though.

2404
01:40:47,170 --> 01:40:49,210
Like not to like kill,
but just to find them.

2405
01:40:49,211 --> 01:40:52,840
Yeah.
I try to touch her tail to what I found

2406
01:40:52,841 --> 01:40:53,830
out.
Not supposed to do that,

2407
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:53,980
but

2408
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,410
I didn't know a man.
I was really close and I just touched

2409
01:40:56,411 --> 01:40:57,750
one.
No you didn't.

2410
01:40:58,090 --> 01:40:59,110
Oh my God,
dude,

2411
01:40:59,111 --> 01:41:01,060
that's so scary.
So we're walking away and it was like,

2412
01:41:01,061 --> 01:41:02,860
it's so close.
And I was like just grabbed.

2413
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:05,200
Oh Yeah,
they have these guides is weird.

2414
01:41:05,201 --> 01:41:08,810
Pointed like v sticks like long sticks
with like a little tip at the end that

2415
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:11,200
like Kinda like,
it's weird.

2416
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:13,630
But this one guy,
when he had it was like way into snakes

2417
01:41:13,631 --> 01:41:15,090
and reptiles and shit and he's like,
let's go.

2418
01:41:15,410 --> 01:41:17,560
Let's go find him.
We went out into the brush.

2419
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:24,320
Komodo dragon was the inspiration for
that thing that the alien would do from

2420
01:41:24,791 --> 01:41:25,541
the movie.
Really?

2421
01:41:25,541 --> 01:41:26,470
Scott movie,
Alien.

2422
01:41:26,730 --> 01:41:28,960
It would open its mouth and all the
slime and everything.

2423
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:30,230
They have all this bacteria,
their mouths.

2424
01:41:30,250 --> 01:41:32,170
Yeah.
Like it's a bit,

2425
01:41:32,171 --> 01:41:33,340
you're going to still going to lose your
leg.

2426
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:37,570
We've gone over this at least twice and
I always forget which it is that they

2427
01:41:37,571 --> 01:41:41,320
used to think that it was a toxin and
now they think it's bacteria or they

2428
01:41:41,321 --> 01:41:43,840
used to think it was bacteria and now
they think it's a toxin.

2429
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,610
Well,
I wanted the bacteria.

2430
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:47,200
Yeah.
It's like a botulism,

2431
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:52,060
lots of different types of bacteria in
their saliva and it's toxic and they

2432
01:41:52,061 --> 01:41:54,430
know it.
And so they'll bite an animal and fuck

2433
01:41:54,431 --> 01:41:57,550
it up and then they'll follow it around.
So I was reading this thing about a

2434
01:41:57,551 --> 01:42:00,040
water buffalo that this Komodo dragon
attacked.

2435
01:42:00,070 --> 01:42:01,090
They saw it,
bite it,

2436
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:03,190
and then it followed it for like two
days.

2437
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:06,250
Really just waiting for it to grow.
So this button,

2438
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:09,640
this guy I met and uh,
it's somewhere deep in.

2439
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:12,220
Okay.
So it's the island of Flores is where

2440
01:42:12,221 --> 01:42:15,280
you can sort of like b and then that's
where the hobbit people were.

2441
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:17,560
Flora's yeah,
in Indonesia.

2442
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:18,880
Yeah.
Really?

2443
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:19,660
Yeah.
We,

2444
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:22,120
you mean the hobbit people,
this little hobbit people that they

2445
01:42:22,121 --> 01:42:23,290
discovered.
Oh really?

2446
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,840
Dude,
they discovered that within the last

2447
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:29,470
shit,
I want to say 14,000 years ago.

2448
01:42:29,471 --> 01:42:32,800
Is that what it was?
It was in the last 14,000 years

2449
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:33,940
somewhere.
It's somewhere in that range.

2450
01:42:34,270 --> 01:42:38,740
Humans shared time on earth with another
kind of human being.

2451
01:42:38,741 --> 01:42:41,620
It's a little tiny,
three foot tall human being that had

2452
01:42:41,621 --> 01:42:43,990
completely different features than us.
Yeah.

2453
01:42:43,991 --> 01:42:46,710
Really Contract Homo Floresiensis or
Florida.

2454
01:42:47,490 --> 01:42:49,690
What's that?
12,000 years ago?

2455
01:42:49,691 --> 01:42:50,560
Yeah.
Okay.

2456
01:42:50,561 --> 01:42:52,740
That's nothing 12,000 years ago.
Like I'm,

2457
01:42:53,390 --> 01:42:56,590
I mean I'm trying to imagine plus as
long did they were,

2458
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:59,920
those people were just like us 12,000
years ago and they were a tiny little

2459
01:42:59,921 --> 01:43:01,240
thing.
Almost like a,

2460
01:43:01,660 --> 01:43:04,570
like a cross between a human and a
chimp.

2461
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:07,150
They don't really know exactly what
their skin color was.

2462
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:09,310
What did it look like?
Put it next to a drawing of a full

2463
01:43:09,311 --> 01:43:10,121
grown.
Like now,

2464
01:43:10,121 --> 01:43:12,760
man,
he's shredded and he's jacked.

2465
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:14,880
He's got,
I'm going to fuck this whole perfect

2466
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:16,480
muscles.
Doesn't it ever eat fast food?

2467
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,930
Troll some Dick and this little critter.
Wow.

2468
01:43:19,210 --> 01:43:21,490
There's even,
there was even speculation that they had

2469
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:25,480
eaten humans or attacked humans.
Do you think they bred with us and

2470
01:43:25,481 --> 01:43:28,750
that's why they're shorter out in Asia.
How dare you know?

2471
01:43:28,870 --> 01:43:30,090
That's what it looks like.
See that one,

2472
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:32,800
the drawing and the far left Jamie with
the guy holding a spear.

2473
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:36,500
That's what they think you live.
If there's a full size version of that

2474
01:43:36,501 --> 01:43:38,890
and see if he could find that.
Oh Jesus.

2475
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:43,420
So they,
these were like all most like what we

2476
01:43:43,421 --> 01:43:46,390
were like,
I guess when we were on our way up the

2477
01:43:46,391 --> 01:43:48,020
food and they just developed a chain.

2478
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:51,620
Yeah.
Well all three Australia kiss or

2479
01:43:51,621 --> 01:43:54,290
something like that.
Like one of our earliest ancestors.

2480
01:43:55,450 --> 01:43:56,600
Australia.
Yeah.

2481
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,750
Well Australopithecus is like a modern
human,

2482
01:43:59,751 --> 01:44:03,050
but like the one of the first versions,
I think,

2483
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:06,350
I want to say it a million years ago,
but I'm probably just making that number

2484
01:44:06,351 --> 01:44:08,090
up.
But you know,

2485
01:44:08,091 --> 01:44:10,220
human beings in this form,
they don't,

2486
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:11,930
they don't know the exact number
obviously,

2487
01:44:11,931 --> 01:44:15,890
but they think we've been around in this
forum for only about a quarter million

2488
01:44:15,890 --> 01:44:18,920
years.
Give or take a few little dragons have

2489
01:44:18,921 --> 01:44:20,520
venom.
They do have.

2490
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:21,513
Okay,
thank you.

2491
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,610
Okay,
so the use of thing,

2492
01:44:22,611 --> 01:44:23,990
it was bacteria and now they think it
was van.

2493
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:24,840
Okay,
I'll show you his picture.

2494
01:44:24,841 --> 01:44:25,700
I was,
I saw it one way.

2495
01:44:25,701 --> 01:44:28,990
So I went on a rock and you'd go like
right behind like some bro,

2496
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,980
like uh,
like some leaves and like some,

2497
01:44:30,981 --> 01:44:33,150
some branches.
So you get an up close to him and it

2498
01:44:33,151 --> 01:44:35,360
still sort of scary cause you can
probably get through the branches but

2499
01:44:35,361 --> 01:44:36,590
probably not,
you know,

2500
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:39,530
and you could just take a picture from
Mick that close all this Hawaiian was

2501
01:44:39,531 --> 01:44:40,364
coming out.

2502
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:43,460
Dude,
I show you this at the store one night.

2503
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:48,540
Can you imagine the horror that you
would feel if a Kimono Jag and was

2504
01:44:49,251 --> 01:44:51,690
clamped down on your calf?
Yeah.

2505
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:55,940
You felt all that hot poison going into
your body and you were trying to get

2506
01:44:55,941 --> 01:44:56,774
away.
Yeah.

2507
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:59,450
And you,
you broke free with a big chunk taken

2508
01:44:59,451 --> 01:45:03,080
out of your calf and it's a bad about to
leap on you and you're trying to run

2509
01:45:03,081 --> 01:45:06,770
away with a limp hobbling duane
screaming no and no.

2510
01:45:06,771 --> 01:45:10,070
And running through the bushes and you
look back and you see it just taking its

2511
01:45:10,071 --> 01:45:10,904
time,
walking,

2512
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:13,430
coming towards her,
taking its time because it knows it

2513
01:45:13,431 --> 01:45:15,470
doesn't have to chase you just tracks
because you can't,

2514
01:45:15,471 --> 01:45:17,480
you can't go far.
You're all fucked up now.

2515
01:45:18,340 --> 01:45:20,180
So it oh yeah,
they are.

2516
01:45:20,330 --> 01:45:23,120
And you know,
eventually it's going to catch you sick

2517
01:45:23,121 --> 01:45:25,990
and shivering and it's just going to
start eating your asshole first.

2518
01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:30,190
Yeah,
they,

2519
01:45:30,190 --> 01:45:33,100
they just bite them in the legs and shit
or they got to be careful.

2520
01:45:33,101 --> 01:45:35,470
They don't get stompy smells with his,
with his tongue.

2521
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:39,010
Jesus Christ to use a tongue to smell
what?

2522
01:45:39,011 --> 01:45:41,410
A creepy fucking creature.
A jetson.

2523
01:45:41,411 --> 01:45:41,921
These,
these,

2524
01:45:41,921 --> 01:45:44,370
these buffalo,
they're not natural to the area they've

2525
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:47,500
been added in,
so they don't know what the fuck this,

2526
01:45:47,530 --> 01:45:49,050
oh,
they've been added into feed 'em.

2527
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:50,640
Yeah.
Oh my God.

2528
01:45:50,641 --> 01:45:51,930
Shit.
But they died.

2529
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:54,320
They'd say go to the watering hole and
the Komodo dragons node,

2530
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:56,590
they're going to go to the watering hole
and they just fucking wait for him.

2531
01:45:56,740 --> 01:46:00,670
And so he jacked him on the leg and then
he slowly making his way towards him.

2532
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:04,630
Imagine if that was you and you had to
see that thing walking up the bank

2533
01:46:04,631 --> 01:46:06,350
towards you.
Some guy got killed.

2534
01:46:06,730 --> 01:46:08,470
The boy,
I'm a person,

2535
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:10,210
you're not supposed to eat me.

2536
01:46:10,450 --> 01:46:14,170
I can think and I can reason.
And I'm progressive and I have health

2537
01:46:14,171 --> 01:46:16,720
insurance.
I have two credit cards.

2538
01:46:17,170 --> 01:46:18,430
They be killed.
The kid,

2539
01:46:18,550 --> 01:46:20,170
I have to call someone,
don't eat me yet.

2540
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:22,270
I have to make a call.
Hold on,

2541
01:46:22,271 --> 01:46:24,200
let me get this task.
Don't hate me.

2542
01:46:24,201 --> 01:46:26,170
Yeah,
I have to choose my face.

2543
01:46:27,490 --> 01:46:29,200
Eat me.
I'm checking twitter.

2544
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:33,550
There's a bunch of them around that one.
Just go an ass hole first and you're

2545
01:46:33,551 --> 01:46:37,420
feeling all the blood rush out of your
body while this creepy lizards chewing

2546
01:46:37,421 --> 01:46:40,450
on your butt ate everything except
those,

2547
01:46:40,451 --> 01:46:42,820
those bores heads cause of the horns.
Really.

2548
01:46:42,850 --> 01:46:45,010
If they get bored,
I mean an ox.

2549
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:48,310
If they get a bore,
they finish the skulls to Jesus Christ.

2550
01:46:48,820 --> 01:46:50,030
They,
the skulls and

2551
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:52,740
everything.
So just those fucking what the called

2552
01:46:52,741 --> 01:46:54,360
heads are the only ones left because of
the horns.

2553
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:56,790
What thoughts come up on the inside?
So they eat the bones.

2554
01:46:56,791 --> 01:46:57,541
Yeah,
they killed the kid.

2555
01:46:57,541 --> 01:46:58,890
They just stomach out.
He went to pee,

2556
01:46:58,891 --> 01:47:00,960
but alone and they're like,
oh,

2557
01:47:00,961 --> 01:47:03,660
this one's by himself.
So this guy I met in floors and deep

2558
01:47:03,661 --> 01:47:05,910
Laura's,
his guide found a board that had been

2559
01:47:05,911 --> 01:47:09,480
bitten and was dying and the bushes.
And,

2560
01:47:09,481 --> 01:47:10,890
um,
so he was like,

2561
01:47:10,891 --> 01:47:12,030
Hey,
you guys want to see some shit?

2562
01:47:12,330 --> 01:47:13,170
It's,
his board is kind of like,

2563
01:47:13,230 --> 01:47:14,400
ah,
like this.

2564
01:47:14,401 --> 01:47:15,890
The Venom,
it started catching up and he took them,

2565
01:47:15,891 --> 01:47:18,660
he dragged him to the watering hole and
he threw it in there and they just

2566
01:47:18,661 --> 01:47:21,780
ripped to shreds in front of them.
He showed me this video he made.

2567
01:47:21,781 --> 01:47:25,560
It was so fucking cool.
What does it look at the size of the

2568
01:47:25,561 --> 01:47:26,010
bone?

2569
01:47:26,010 --> 01:47:27,420
That guy's eating?
Yeah,

2570
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,120
they're all on [inaudible].
Oh my God.

2571
01:47:30,210 --> 01:47:32,100
Look at that.
There's something about them.

2572
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:35,880
They're the cold,
unfeeling look in their eyes.

2573
01:47:35,881 --> 01:47:38,400
Like when he opens his mouth and you see
all those teeth alive.

2574
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:40,590
But that I,
yeah,

2575
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:42,720
that's a real,
an all black.

2576
01:47:42,930 --> 01:47:46,170
That's a thinking creature that's trying
to eat you.

2577
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:51,540
It's trying to eat either you or a
buffalo and eats a water buffalo man.

2578
01:47:52,050 --> 01:47:56,070
He doesn't use knives.
It's not using and there's no fork.

2579
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:59,940
There's no bullets.
It's eating a goddamn water buffalo.

2580
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:04,350
So we're going through waist high grass
trying to find these things and then you

2581
01:48:04,351 --> 01:48:06,020
see one pop its head up like the zone,
et Cetera,

2582
01:48:06,021 --> 01:48:07,680
et cetera.
You got to like get behind it and try to

2583
01:48:07,681 --> 01:48:10,890
like force it down the mountain.
But there's other ones around so you got

2584
01:48:10,891 --> 01:48:12,450
to stay closed,
keep your eyes up.

2585
01:48:13,330 --> 01:48:14,180
It was pretty cool,
man.

2586
01:48:14,181 --> 01:48:15,150
Do you would love that?
No,

2587
01:48:15,151 --> 01:48:17,030
I read the monsters like that.
You would love that.

2588
01:48:17,070 --> 01:48:18,570
Fine.
I'd be terrified.

2589
01:48:18,571 --> 01:48:21,120
I don't want to be around them man.
Why are you around them?

2590
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:23,610
Oh it was so cool.
Well I found out what I was in Bali and

2591
01:48:23,611 --> 01:48:24,990
I was like,
I'll probably go to somewhere else from

2592
01:48:24,991 --> 01:48:27,030
there and this guy met from Jakarta was
like,

2593
01:48:27,031 --> 01:48:29,150
you know,
you're right next to the Komodo dragons.

2594
01:48:29,151 --> 01:48:30,600
You can do that.
And it's like what?

2595
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:34,920
That's here and it was just a couple of
boats and you're fucking there.

2596
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:38,010
Wow Dude.
Fuck that.

2597
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:40,050
No Man,
you don't love it.

2598
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:42,230
They almost got Sharon.
What's her mace?

2599
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:45,120
[inaudible] Sharon Stone.
Sharon stone's husband.

2600
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:46,200
Rarely.
Yeah,

2601
01:48:46,430 --> 01:48:48,630
even they almost got him.
He was a newspaper man.

2602
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:53,280
He was a like a reporter and,
or a journalist or rather,

2603
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:57,840
and he went to do something in a cage
with Komodo dragons and he had socks on

2604
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,280
in the fucking thing.

2605
01:48:59,310 --> 01:49:03,900
Thought it's white foot.
It was a zoo and he went and got him.

2606
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:06,930
What do you mean bid his foot bit the
fuck out of his foot.

2607
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:12,020
Dude went to the hospital.
Crushing his toe.

2608
01:49:12,021 --> 01:49:13,980
A thrashing it's body around?
Yeah.

2609
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:16,530
Um,
what he had to undergo foot surgery.

2610
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:18,900
Oh,
come on son.

2611
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:21,660
Yeah,
I was a shoeless foot.

2612
01:49:22,110 --> 01:49:24,420
Oh,
I thought it was a sock crushing his big

2613
01:49:24,421 --> 01:49:25,770
toe.
Ouchie Wawa.

2614
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:27,720
Oh.
The zookeeper asked him to remove his

2615
01:49:27,721 --> 01:49:31,890
white tennis shoes to keep the five foot
long reptile from mistaking them for

2616
01:49:31,891 --> 01:49:33,510
white rats.
So,

2617
01:49:33,511 --> 01:49:35,070
hey yo dude,
take your shoes off.

2618
01:49:35,071 --> 01:49:36,480
You'll be cool.
Don't worry about it.

2619
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:39,000
As long as it knows.
And then they attack that foot.

2620
01:49:39,001 --> 01:49:40,050
It's like,
why don't you tell me to take the shoe

2621
01:49:40,051 --> 01:49:43,610
off?
I really still had a shoe on the feeling

2622
01:49:43,611 --> 01:49:46,660
you must've had.
As that thing is biting his foot that's

2623
01:49:46,740 --> 01:49:48,100
here must been like,
I'm really sorry.

2624
01:49:48,940 --> 01:49:52,120
My severed the tenders.
They had to reattach severed tendons and

2625
01:49:52,121 --> 01:49:56,440
rebuild his big toe that was crushed by
the dragons jaw.

2626
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:58,360
Jesus,
you have to piss again.

2627
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:00,000
Yeah,
but do you have enough room in that?

2628
01:50:00,001 --> 01:50:01,930
Do you want to empty that?
Come on,

2629
01:50:01,931 --> 01:50:02,764
man.
He sure.

2630
01:50:02,790 --> 01:50:04,030
Yeah,
but there was only a little bit left

2631
01:50:04,031 --> 01:50:07,330
cause I had to pitch on again.
Overspill don't overflow.

2632
01:50:07,390 --> 01:50:10,060
I want to repay in professional at this
man.

2633
01:50:10,390 --> 01:50:13,600
But here's the thing about animals like
Komodo dragons and wolves.

2634
01:50:13,870 --> 01:50:17,830
I love the fact that they're real.
It's one of the things that makes life

2635
01:50:18,580 --> 01:50:23,050
fascinating is that there are these
ruthless merciless predators.

2636
01:50:23,230 --> 01:50:26,230
Jamie's shielding his eyes from Laurie's
deck.

2637
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:29,710
Oh,
the image.

2638
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:32,680
Why don't just put the image on me for a
sec is educational.

2639
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:35,760
You don't want to show his,
Jamie,

2640
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:39,240
could you get away with doing this on,
on youtube or instagram where taking

2641
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:41,820
might be in trouble just because we
mentioned that your opinion,

2642
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:44,650
that level of censorship on the
Internet.

2643
01:50:44,850 --> 01:50:45,880
Here's the deal,
dude.

2644
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:48,490
Do you know that if you whipped your
dick out and took a leak in front of a

2645
01:50:48,491 --> 01:50:50,320
school,
you'd be charged as a sex molester?

2646
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:51,520
Dude,
I do that all the time.

2647
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:53,500
And thank you for telling me because I
will stop.

2648
01:50:53,610 --> 01:50:54,580
Yeah.
For Real.

2649
01:50:54,581 --> 01:50:56,440
Like if,
say if you're walking past the school

2650
01:50:56,441 --> 01:50:56,911
and you're like,
ah,

2651
01:50:56,911 --> 01:51:00,040
I gotta take a leak and you just
innocently walked towards a patch of

2652
01:51:00,041 --> 01:51:03,460
trees and you piss there and someone
from the school calls the police because

2653
01:51:03,461 --> 01:51:04,150
you had your dick out.

2654
01:51:04,150 --> 01:51:06,770
You have your Dick says that the school
doesn't matter.

2655
01:51:06,780 --> 01:51:07,690
Guys.
You know I was doing,

2656
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:11,650
I know a dude who got charged with that.
I know somebody who,

2657
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:12,910
we both know.
Somebody who got,

2658
01:51:12,911 --> 01:51:15,970
who's hooking up with a girl on school
property late at night.

2659
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,010
They needed a place to pull over so they
can fuck in the car.

2660
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:19,990
Oh,
what's was on school property,

2661
01:51:20,170 --> 01:51:21,520
but it's fucking 2:00 AM,
you know?

2662
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:24,490
Yeah.
They're trying to discourage that

2663
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:24,990
robbery.
Yeah.

2664
01:51:24,990 --> 01:51:27,860
I get that condoms thrown out the window
at a fucking,

2665
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:30,550
she has to get showing up for school in
the morning and drop your kid off.

2666
01:51:30,551 --> 01:51:33,200
You could slips,
breaks her hip because she stepped down

2667
01:51:33,201 --> 01:51:34,034
a condom.

2668
01:51:36,230 --> 01:51:39,970
Those a little shiny school shoes.
The kids were with the hard bottoms,

2669
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,930
don't get good traction.
What?

2670
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:46,110
Like rules about doing stuff within a
thousand feet of schools.

2671
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,170
Yeah,
stuff like that.

2672
01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:50,290
So many schools in Hollywood,
you gotta be so much shit happening

2673
01:51:50,291 --> 01:51:53,890
within a thousand feet of them.
Wasn't that one of the issues too with

2674
01:51:53,891 --> 01:51:57,470
pot shops like
yeah,

2675
01:51:57,471 --> 01:52:00,490
I fucked with them too.
I can't be anywhere near a church.

2676
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:02,650
The church parts.
How Larry this,

2677
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:04,670
it's like if that's really the case,
does it,

2678
01:52:04,671 --> 01:52:06,610
is that one?
If that really is still the case,

2679
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:10,810
but I get it though.
If you really believed and you really

2680
01:52:10,811 --> 01:52:13,390
believe that your church was sacred and
important to you,

2681
01:52:13,391 --> 01:52:16,620
you wouldn't want like one door down no
door,

2682
01:52:16,780 --> 01:52:18,100
but you not sign.
All churches are not,

2683
01:52:18,101 --> 01:52:19,470
they're not the ones.
I'm like that with the lawn.

2684
01:52:19,471 --> 01:52:22,810
It's like you see in the movies,
a lot of them in in la or just like in

2685
01:52:22,811 --> 01:52:23,860
between two apartment buildings.

2686
01:52:23,890 --> 01:52:25,960
But also the question is who gets to
choose?

2687
01:52:26,050 --> 01:52:28,060
Who gets to choose that?
Like what?

2688
01:52:28,090 --> 01:52:30,970
How much distance between a church and a
liquor store?

2689
01:52:30,971 --> 01:52:33,760
Well let's,
I want to know is selling liquor okay.

2690
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:35,800
Is it okay?
It seems like it's okay.

2691
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:38,530
It seems like a lot of people are doing,
it seems like a lot of people are buying

2692
01:52:38,531 --> 01:52:39,670
it.
It seems like we all agree.

2693
01:52:39,820 --> 01:52:41,590
Okay,
so if it is the case,

2694
01:52:41,850 --> 01:52:46,290
w w why that radius radius of a,
not even like up blog.

2695
01:52:46,450 --> 01:52:50,390
The rules in Detroit was the same shop
saw also prohibited from operating

2696
01:52:50,391 --> 01:52:53,120
within a thousand foot radius of a
church school park,

2697
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:58,150
liquor stores or other dispensary or or
a drug free zone such as a library.

2698
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,880
Hmm.
They all somewhat close by 8:00 PM other

2699
01:53:01,881 --> 01:53:04,310
dispensary liquor store,
other dispensary.

2700
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:07,700
Okay.
This is all this is a result of people

2701
01:53:07,701 --> 01:53:08,810
got,
well I didn't want them right next to

2702
01:53:08,811 --> 01:53:11,420
this while I'm doing that,
but this is saying that they can't be

2703
01:53:11,421 --> 01:53:12,650
close to a liquor store.

2704
01:53:12,650 --> 01:53:14,720
Like a liquor store is the same as the
church.

2705
01:53:15,050 --> 01:53:17,240
That's what I'm saying.
You were saying a pot,

2706
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:22,010
a pot shop can't be the alternative to a
business that's already established.

2707
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:23,120
Oh,
like a liquor store.

2708
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:26,210
That's what they're saying.
Don't quit booze.

2709
01:53:26,450 --> 01:53:28,760
Yeah.
Well they saying you cannot wait.

2710
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:32,300
So the liquor stores must've lobbied to
have that put in there.

2711
01:53:32,950 --> 01:53:35,120
They must have figured out a way.
Zero Liquor Store Union

2712
01:53:37,070 --> 01:53:38,030
liquor board.
So yeah,

2713
01:53:38,890 --> 01:53:39,560
I mean,
yeah,

2714
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:43,790
I mean there's obviously that doesn't
make sense like the church makes sense.

2715
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:46,450
Reluctantly I get it.
Makes Sense.

2716
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:50,270
Makes Sense.
The liquor store doesn't make any sense.

2717
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:54,740
Know like why can't I just walk right
next door after I buy some weed and buy

2718
01:53:54,741 --> 01:53:58,160
a beer?
Why do I have to go 500 feet further?

2719
01:53:58,450 --> 01:53:59,660
And they don't have them here,
but no.

2720
01:53:59,690 --> 01:54:01,730
How'd they still drive through alcohol
places?

2721
01:54:01,731 --> 01:54:02,990
You just driving a car?

2722
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:05,660
They haven't been Phoenix,
Louisiana.

2723
01:54:06,030 --> 01:54:06,890
Yeah.
This place is,

2724
01:54:06,891 --> 01:54:08,930
we can drive through and get,
they'll give you a mixed drinks.

2725
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:10,220
Mixed drinks.
Yeah.

2726
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:11,870
That's like how you're going to justify
it.

2727
01:54:11,871 --> 01:54:13,370
I'm not,
I'm having the drive thru bar.

2728
01:54:15,220 --> 01:54:19,100
It's my a passengers drink.
Well I wouldn't drink and drive officer

2729
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:20,780
and Louisa.
I don't think I looked that up.

2730
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:22,490
Your drink,
your passengers can drive,

2731
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:24,010
can drink,
can drink while you're drawing the

2732
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,510
driver.
Cantors and Louisiana is on another

2733
01:54:26,511 --> 01:54:28,940
level.
New Orleans is on a totally different

2734
01:54:28,941 --> 01:54:29,910
level.
Yeah.

2735
01:54:30,110 --> 01:54:32,180
Will you with me in New Orleans,
we had this driver,

2736
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,870
we didn't know we had this driver who's
hilarious,

2737
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:38,300
funny fucking dude.
I wish I could remember his name,

2738
01:54:38,301 --> 01:54:41,780
but he was cool as shit.
We had them for a couple of days and a,

2739
01:54:41,781 --> 01:54:44,930
when we're hanging out with this dude,
he was telling me that he got pulled

2740
01:54:44,931 --> 01:54:48,920
over outside of New Orleans because he
was walking down the street with an open

2741
01:54:48,921 --> 01:54:50,570
beer,
I forget where it was,

2742
01:54:50,571 --> 01:54:51,404
some other city.

2743
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:54,230
And uh,
they pulled him over and he had two

2744
01:54:54,231 --> 01:54:56,990
beers in,
in a paper bag and when they're pulled

2745
01:54:56,991 --> 01:54:58,090
him over,
he was talking to the cops,

2746
01:54:58,091 --> 01:54:59,060
the cops like,
where are you from?

2747
01:54:59,390 --> 01:55:01,310
And uh,
he's talking to the cop.

2748
01:55:01,311 --> 01:55:04,430
He pulls out the other beer and cracks
it open and starts drinking it.

2749
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:07,130
And the cops like,
is there something fucking wrong with

2750
01:55:07,131 --> 01:55:08,690
your head?
And he's like,

2751
01:55:08,691 --> 01:55:09,381
what?
He goes,

2752
01:55:09,381 --> 01:55:09,921
wait,
where are you?

2753
01:55:09,921 --> 01:55:10,910
Where are you from?
He goes,

2754
01:55:10,911 --> 01:55:11,744
New Orleans.
He goes,

2755
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:12,590
oh,
okay.

2756
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:13,670
Oh,
you don't know.

2757
01:55:13,670 --> 01:55:16,280
That's not allowed out of the bushes.
Do that anywhere else.

2758
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:17,210
And he's like,
for real?

2759
01:55:17,240 --> 01:55:18,380
He's like,
why I'm not doing anything wrong.

2760
01:55:18,381 --> 01:55:20,630
I'm just walking.
I forget where the trashcan was,

2761
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:22,550
what he was outside of New Orleans for
sure,

2762
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:25,580
but he was saying that they,
that he had no idea that you couldn't

2763
01:55:25,581 --> 01:55:28,310
crack open a beer and start drinking in
front of a cop when he's asking

2764
01:55:28,311 --> 01:55:29,144
questions.

2765
01:55:30,060 --> 01:55:32,390
I had done nothing.
That's the best about Southeast Asia.

2766
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:35,330
You get a beer with your walk with it
like a fucking free America.

2767
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:37,610
You're just like out there.
You're not going to do anything.

2768
01:55:37,670 --> 01:55:38,630
Have a good time,
man.

2769
01:55:39,110 --> 01:55:44,110
Just too many dumb young dudes that
would bring drinks and him on people and

2770
01:55:44,581 --> 01:55:47,160
be walking on the street with open beers
and be goofy.

2771
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:49,890
I guess so maybe just here,
maybe here,

2772
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:52,980
but London's got a little bit of that.
They drink outside.

2773
01:55:52,981 --> 01:55:54,450
Nah,
maybe not in this trace a drink like an

2774
01:55:54,451 --> 01:55:56,880
outdoor pubs do.
I've seen it in England.

2775
01:55:56,910 --> 01:55:59,350
Would people boozed up on the streets?
Yeah.

2776
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:00,810
Beating the shit out of each other.
Oh yeah.

2777
01:56:00,811 --> 01:56:03,720
I mean that's going to happen.
It's like don't put yourself in position

2778
01:56:03,721 --> 01:56:07,320
where you have to fight all the time.
What the argument is for.

2779
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:08,820
It's not about drinking outdoors or not.

2780
01:56:08,820 --> 01:56:10,730
It's about like don't drink so much.
Right?

2781
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:12,150
Yeah.
Don't get so drunk.

2782
01:56:12,151 --> 01:56:14,790
Decab and you can do that in one space
or you can walk and do it.

2783
01:56:14,791 --> 01:56:18,180
That doesn't matter.
I wonder what the argument is for a 2:00

2784
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:21,000
AM like cut off time.
It's all Christian Shit Dude.

2785
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:22,710
Is it?
It's all remnants of Christian Shit.

2786
01:56:22,711 --> 01:56:24,270
Who Cares?
Why can't we just be up longer?

2787
01:56:24,630 --> 01:56:26,430
Miami,
it's like 5:00 AM and New York.

2788
01:56:26,431 --> 01:56:29,100
It's four or later.
A lot of places it's not.

2789
01:56:29,101 --> 01:56:30,990
If that heard they're gonna change the
La two to four.

2790
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:32,490
Four.
Yeah,

2791
01:56:33,150 --> 01:56:36,030
I heard that will make change.
That comment store super weird.

2792
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:38,270
They'll stop close it too.
You don't have to until then.

2793
01:56:38,460 --> 01:56:39,330
Why?
Yeah,

2794
01:56:39,331 --> 01:56:41,430
because there's guys who want to go up a
good point.

2795
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:43,260
We didn't have some weird ass shows,
man.

2796
01:56:43,261 --> 01:56:45,660
I might do a 2:00 AM set.
If they ever do that,

2797
01:56:45,870 --> 01:56:46,290
I might.

2798
01:56:46,290 --> 01:56:49,800
I might book myself for a 2:00 AM set to
the comedy cellar.

2799
01:56:49,830 --> 01:56:53,010
I go a lot after 2:00 AM two packed
rooms.

2800
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:54,390
Yeah.
Packed.

2801
01:56:54,420 --> 01:56:56,310
I mean like what time of those show
starts?

2802
01:56:56,311 --> 01:56:57,210
They start late,
I suppose.

2803
01:56:57,211 --> 01:57:01,290
Start at like 1130 and I'm up at like
one 45 to wow.

2804
01:57:01,650 --> 01:57:03,750
And it's just like,
and it's all great crowd.

2805
01:57:03,751 --> 01:57:04,584
Yeah.
Yeah.

2806
01:57:04,660 --> 01:57:06,690
If those are the kinds of people that
are up.

2807
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:07,440
Yeah,
sure.

2808
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:08,273
Come on.
Yeah.

2809
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:10,530
There's a lot of people that are on
different schedules.

2810
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:15,330
A place like New York,
you can find 150 of them go at 11:30 PM

2811
01:57:15,331 --> 01:57:16,710
and I can start my night.
Oh yeah.

2812
01:57:16,711 --> 01:57:18,930
And you're still have a great long time.
Oh yeah.

2813
01:57:19,050 --> 01:57:20,430
Yeah.
And people in New York,

2814
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:22,710
like,
they fucking go hard.

2815
01:57:22,740 --> 01:57:25,440
They go so hard,
so much drinking in New York and meet

2816
01:57:25,441 --> 01:57:26,520
people at their show.
It's not like,

2817
01:57:26,521 --> 01:57:27,271
give me a number.
It's like,

2818
01:57:27,271 --> 01:57:28,680
let's go somewhere right now.

2819
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:30,060
Yeah.
Let's just go to a bar.

2820
01:57:30,120 --> 01:57:32,250
There's 30 within walking distance.
Yeah.

2821
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:34,320
Let's keep going.
Let's just talk.

2822
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:36,780
They just drink.
You know,

2823
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:37,980
Dunkin had,
um,

2824
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:40,660
Greg Fitzsimmons on his podcast this
week and,

2825
01:57:40,661 --> 01:57:42,150
uh,
I've only listened to the first,

2826
01:57:42,151 --> 01:57:46,410
like 10 minutes or so,
but a Dunkin was talking about how

2827
01:57:46,411 --> 01:57:50,850
different New York is in terms of like
diversity and all the different colors

2828
01:57:51,120 --> 01:57:52,170
each other.
Yeah.

2829
01:57:52,230 --> 01:57:53,063
Yeah.
He's liking it.

2830
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:55,080
I see it a couple times.
It's been pretty fun,

2831
01:57:55,081 --> 01:57:57,300
man.
Just be able to like booze up and like,

2832
01:57:57,301 --> 01:57:59,160
not to worry about getting home.
Yeah.

2833
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:01,560
He loves it.
I walk home from the stand.

2834
01:58:01,561 --> 01:58:02,550
He takes a cab,
you know,

2835
01:58:02,551 --> 01:58:03,890
it's in the normal,
you know,

2836
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:06,090
he's a,
is he living in Brooklyn?

2837
01:58:06,190 --> 01:58:07,260
Living in Brooklyn?
Of course he is.

2838
01:58:07,261 --> 01:58:08,100
That fucking hit.
No,

2839
01:58:08,101 --> 01:58:09,210
that's right for him.
For sure.

2840
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:10,490
That's the spot.
Yeah.

2841
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:10,921
Yeah.
I mean,

2842
01:58:10,921 --> 01:58:13,080
he was a silver lake kid and then he
went to,

2843
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:14,100
he's doing the same thing.

2844
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:15,690
He seemed like Williamsburg.
Right.

2845
01:58:15,720 --> 01:58:17,340
I think park slope.
Same Shit,

2846
01:58:17,341 --> 01:58:19,220
isn't it?
It's past like,

2847
01:58:19,230 --> 01:58:21,420
it's over gentrified.
Oh,

2848
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:24,090
that one's gone too far with style.
Can afford it.

2849
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:24,901
Ooh,
I like it.

2850
01:58:24,901 --> 01:58:26,310
I might move in.
Yeah.

2851
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:27,240
That's my style.
Yeah.

2852
01:58:27,710 --> 01:58:28,980
Um,
I saw,

2853
01:58:29,130 --> 01:58:31,380
I was watching one of those house
flipper shows.

2854
01:58:31,450 --> 01:58:32,310
Yeah,
it was uh,

2855
01:58:32,370 --> 01:58:34,740
you know,
what is the,

2856
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:36,810
some of the real estate million dollar
listing,

2857
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:38,250
that's what it's called.
Million dollar listing,

2858
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:41,000
New York birth defects.
And um,

2859
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:45,670
they had a house that was for sale in
Brooklyn that was like a,

2860
01:58:45,730 --> 01:58:48,600
they built like a Georgia mansion in
Brooklyn,

2861
01:58:48,601 --> 01:58:51,160
Brooklyn in like 1920.
And they,

2862
01:58:51,161 --> 01:58:53,560
you know,
they were trying to like put mansions

2863
01:58:53,561 --> 01:58:54,394
like southern style

2864
01:58:54,440 --> 01:58:58,500
mansions in Brooklyn.
It's like 11,000 square foot house.

2865
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,510
I can't afford Williamsburg.
Really?

2866
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:02,040
Yeah.
I thought I had to go there cause they

2867
01:59:02,041 --> 01:59:04,350
won't be able to afford Manhattan.
And then I found out when I got there

2868
01:59:04,351 --> 01:59:04,921
I'm like,
oh no,

2869
01:59:04,921 --> 01:59:06,870
no.
Manhattan's cheaper now the cool parts

2870
01:59:06,871 --> 01:59:08,520
of Manhattan where I live,
it's cheaper.

2871
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:11,730
Jesus and the cool parts of Brooklyn.
Why is that?

2872
01:59:12,750 --> 01:59:15,420
It got this.
Gentrification has his path.

2873
01:59:15,421 --> 01:59:19,110
At first you have bad neighborhoods.
We're not talking about warehouse

2874
01:59:19,111 --> 01:59:20,100
central Pike.
That's different.

2875
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:21,293
But like,
you know,

2876
01:59:21,810 --> 01:59:24,180
ethnic gentrifying first to have
actually both.

2877
01:59:24,450 --> 01:59:28,680
So first you have criminals or
warehouses and then the people can like

2878
01:59:28,740 --> 01:59:31,350
are cool artists who have no money.
They'll move in,

2879
01:59:31,470 --> 01:59:34,440
they can get a giant loft for basically
nothing cause you gotta worry about

2880
01:59:34,441 --> 01:59:36,210
getting stabbed or having nothing around
you.

2881
01:59:36,660 --> 01:59:39,270
They start adding the arts to the,
to the area,

2882
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:42,510
making it more interesting than people
like Dunkin and me come in,

2883
01:59:43,180 --> 01:59:44,130
what we're like,
we like it.

2884
01:59:44,130 --> 01:59:45,600
I'm going to be the front lines of this
shit.

2885
01:59:45,970 --> 01:59:47,810
You know,
I need someplace to go like you know,

2886
01:59:47,820 --> 01:59:51,540
get some food but they're still
criminals around or like lack of stuff.

2887
01:59:51,780 --> 01:59:54,420
And then the rich people who don't have
style of their own,

2888
01:59:54,421 --> 01:59:57,450
they move in and Co op the other
people's style and then you start

2889
01:59:57,451 --> 02:00:00,870
getting too many like coffee shops and
then they start changing the law to

2890
02:00:00,871 --> 02:00:02,830
drive out the people who lived there.
Like,

2891
02:00:02,930 --> 02:00:05,460
and this is a park where they all are
camped out and go on us.

2892
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:08,850
And every Sunday they would cook out
there and they started saying,

2893
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,340
the rich people was like,
oh the smoke is going to my windows.

2894
02:00:11,940 --> 02:00:16,590
So he started making laws.
About how you can't have cookouts and

2895
02:00:16,591 --> 02:00:19,170
that pretty much just drove out the
people who wanted to have that as part

2896
02:00:19,171 --> 02:00:20,210
as their life.
They were just like,

2897
02:00:20,510 --> 02:00:22,700
you don't make the laws saying it's
illegal to be ethnic,

2898
02:00:23,060 --> 02:00:24,840
but you make laws around it.
Do.

2899
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:27,260
There's a,
there's a park down the street from

2900
02:00:27,261 --> 02:00:28,010
here.
Yeah,

2901
02:00:28,010 --> 02:00:30,680
we could go to,
it's like only a couple of minutes away.

2902
02:00:30,710 --> 02:00:32,750
Yeah.
And if you go there on the weekends,

2903
02:00:33,170 --> 02:00:35,360
it's,
it's like a festival.

2904
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:38,720
It's like people use those barbecue
grill to have out there that gets,

2905
02:00:38,730 --> 02:00:42,680
then they set up a picnic tables.
They lay out a,

2906
02:00:42,681 --> 02:00:45,050
uh,
a cloth and the picnic tables and paper

2907
02:00:45,051 --> 02:00:47,540
cups and shit.
And they got coolers at porn,

2908
02:00:47,810 --> 02:00:51,710
like Koolaid and shed and they,
they're cooking all kinds of different

2909
02:00:51,711 --> 02:00:53,060
things on these,
these racks.

2910
02:00:53,061 --> 02:00:56,690
And there's like maybe five,
six families spread out in these areas

2911
02:00:56,691 --> 02:00:58,700
that are doing that.
And then as kids are playing and

2912
02:00:58,701 --> 02:01:00,920
everybody's running around,
it's a lot of people that live in

2913
02:01:00,921 --> 02:01:03,860
apartments that don't have a lot,
like they don't have,

2914
02:01:03,890 --> 02:01:05,450
they don't have a big backyard.

2915
02:01:05,570 --> 02:01:07,610
So now they just go to the park.
It's great.

2916
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:09,470
It's great.
And there's like this sense of

2917
02:01:09,471 --> 02:01:10,640
community,
but he's laughing.

2918
02:01:10,641 --> 02:01:13,100
They got music playing.
People are drinking.

2919
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:15,140
Yeah.
Are you allowed to drink booze in the

2920
02:01:15,141 --> 02:01:16,100
park?
How's that work?

2921
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:18,980
I Dunno,
I don't tailgating you gotta use cans.

2922
02:01:19,010 --> 02:01:21,550
You can't use bottles.
But if you're sitting there on a python,

2923
02:01:22,020 --> 02:01:24,410
Kenya,
I think just look the other way kind of

2924
02:01:24,411 --> 02:01:25,430
stuff.
If anything,

2925
02:01:26,870 --> 02:01:28,070
that would suck.
I mean,

2926
02:01:28,071 --> 02:01:30,650
you gotta be able to have a beer,
some beers,

2927
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:33,620
you having a cheeseburger and the park.
That's how I meet.

2928
02:01:33,621 --> 02:01:35,720
Some of these freedom laws are like,
I'm not going to do anything,

2929
02:01:35,721 --> 02:01:37,910
man.
Let me have a beer with my family.

2930
02:01:38,390 --> 02:01:39,400
This doesn't hurt.
Well,

2931
02:01:39,401 --> 02:01:40,080
if everyone did that,

2932
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:40,970
you're going have drunks,
my kid.

2933
02:01:40,971 --> 02:01:43,310
But that's not me.
I'm not that.

2934
02:01:43,370 --> 02:01:46,400
So let me do it.
What kind of diseases can you get from

2935
02:01:46,401 --> 02:01:47,640
one of them?
Park grills,

2936
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:52,910
who's cleaning that grill through?
One of the best barbecues I ever had was

2937
02:01:52,911 --> 02:01:55,040
on top of in Vail,
on top of the mountain.

2938
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:57,410
So we were skiing,
I was skiing with his chef and he had a

2939
02:01:57,411 --> 02:02:01,490
bunch of fucking chicken in his back
marinating in the of the sags are those

2940
02:02:01,491 --> 02:02:02,540
boxes?
These ziploc bags?

2941
02:02:02,630 --> 02:02:03,920
Yeah.
So he's kept shaking it up,

2942
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:08,000
his snowboard and hitting jumps.
He's just marinate in this chicken and

2943
02:02:08,001 --> 02:02:08,511
then he's like,
hey,

2944
02:02:08,511 --> 02:02:09,291
you want to eat with us?
I'm like,

2945
02:02:09,291 --> 02:02:09,651
yeah,
sure.

2946
02:02:09,651 --> 02:02:10,270
He's like,
oh no.

2947
02:02:10,270 --> 02:02:12,950
I was going into the restaurant party.
There's no out here and just use that

2948
02:02:12,951 --> 02:02:16,950
thing and it's just make grilled fucking
chicken up on top of fucking wow.

2949
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,710
The rockies.
It was so good.

2950
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:20,840
So did he have like a little grill in
his pack too?

2951
02:02:20,841 --> 02:02:22,490
Oh,
they had the public grill up there.

2952
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:23,450
Oh,
that thing.

2953
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:26,540
Yeah,
just got some wood and stuff.

2954
02:02:26,541 --> 02:02:27,890
It was just coal's going,
I guess.

2955
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:30,920
Oh Wow.
People would like to do that up there.

2956
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:33,830
Those things are so nasty,
so nasty.

2957
02:02:34,590 --> 02:02:38,960
It was like the bird shitting on them.
Nobody's ever claimed anywhere else,

2958
02:02:39,350 --> 02:02:42,110
but like,
I guess the idea is once the fire gets

2959
02:02:42,111 --> 02:02:43,970
going,
nothing's going to stay alive on it,

2960
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,040
I guess.
Yeah.

2961
02:02:46,900 --> 02:02:49,420
When that motherfucker gets red hot to
the point where you could see her a

2962
02:02:49,421 --> 02:02:51,560
steak,
nothing surviving on that.

2963
02:02:52,190 --> 02:02:53,960
I mean that's,
isn't that the whole principle behind

2964
02:02:53,961 --> 02:02:57,020
cast iron pans?
Like you don't really wash a cast iron

2965
02:02:57,021 --> 02:02:57,650
pan.
You don't,

2966
02:02:57,650 --> 02:03:00,710
you just sort of scratch out.
Everything's dare throw some water on

2967
02:03:00,711 --> 02:03:01,370
it.

2968
02:03:01,370 --> 02:03:05,270
But like that dark blackness that you
get from a cast iron pan.

2969
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:07,880
I don't know why,
but when I cook on one of those I feel

2970
02:03:07,881 --> 02:03:09,880
like a fucking man sign grill man.
It's about,

2971
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:13,190
I feel like a man in frying pan.
I feel like a man,

2972
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:18,340
if you give me a choice and there's a
cast iron pan and some bitch ass fucking

2973
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:23,450
heats the whole take on the skin.
It's one of those ones that you could

2974
02:03:23,451 --> 02:03:27,300
like flip a cheeseburger without putting
in a non stick.

2975
02:03:27,830 --> 02:03:30,710
Those are so gross.
And me and Martha Usos nonstick pans and

2976
02:03:30,711 --> 02:03:33,110
now a lot of that got into your food
cause they'd been cooking that shit for

2977
02:03:33,111 --> 02:03:35,820
like 10 years on the scratch and just
cooking.

2978
02:03:36,230 --> 02:03:37,670
Just fucking,
here you go and you're like,

2979
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:38,990
ah,
shut off to it.

2980
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:40,280
Let's go.
Just date it.

2981
02:03:40,310 --> 02:03:42,350
Yeah,
it's going to come out and metal flakes.

2982
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:46,130
My dog ate a packet of glitter.
Really?

2983
02:03:46,190 --> 02:03:47,580
And he shit.
Yeah.

2984
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:48,493
Shit.
Glitter.

2985
02:03:49,770 --> 02:03:52,880
It's like in roped up in his shit.
I was going to take a picture of it,

2986
02:03:52,881 --> 02:03:55,220
put it on Instagram,
but I was thinking it's probably like

2987
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:59,540
they could probably take that down.
Get mad at you for shit.

2988
02:04:00,290 --> 02:04:01,730
I guess.
I bet they could.

2989
02:04:02,330 --> 02:04:04,460
I bet there's rules.
You can't show tits on instagram.

2990
02:04:04,730 --> 02:04:07,550
Why on twitter?
It seems like you could show people

2991
02:04:07,551 --> 02:04:10,610
fucking this guy stop bro says comedian.
He,

2992
02:04:10,611 --> 02:04:11,690
he,
he's a fat guy.

2993
02:04:11,900 --> 02:04:13,640
Fat,
cute Greek guys on my podcast this week.

2994
02:04:13,700 --> 02:04:14,533
But like,
uh,

2995
02:04:15,310 --> 02:04:19,070
again,
I thought it was he to take these naked

2996
02:04:19,071 --> 02:04:21,230
pictures.
He just liked his big fat naked body.

2997
02:04:21,690 --> 02:04:25,040
If somebody see but never dick.
And he would just be naked with like one

2998
02:04:25,041 --> 02:04:27,350
foot in front of the other.
They were hilarious pictures and

2999
02:04:27,351 --> 02:04:28,490
instagram was like,
Nah.

3000
02:04:28,790 --> 02:04:29,660
Wow.
It's like,

3001
02:04:29,661 --> 02:04:31,160
come on.
How rude.

3002
02:04:31,220 --> 02:04:33,100
Yeah.
People wrote blogs about him saying he's

3003
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:35,220
be like body,
body positive.

3004
02:04:35,670 --> 02:04:38,820
Hmm.
Instagram picture is accounting.

3005
02:04:39,060 --> 02:04:43,110
Accounting bring back stabby baby stabby
baby.

3006
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:47,190
Stobby t a fucking marry your brother's
ones.

3007
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:48,113
Yeah,
they're funny.

3008
02:04:48,850 --> 02:04:50,580
Um,
you just see a butt cheek.

3009
02:04:50,581 --> 02:04:52,560
You don't see like his asshole or
anything like that.

3010
02:04:52,950 --> 02:04:55,170
Nothing wrong with 20s doing,
come on instagram.

3011
02:04:55,290 --> 02:04:57,970
A sad picture with fucking ice cream
over his,

3012
02:04:58,150 --> 02:04:59,790
over his dog.
He dropped one.

3013
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:01,380
Yeah,
he's funny.

3014
02:05:01,930 --> 02:05:03,840
It's funny pictures.
Why would that be offensive?

3015
02:05:03,850 --> 02:05:07,680
Like scared of nakedness.
I had one way to pay off a bag of bets

3016
02:05:07,681 --> 02:05:12,360
on punchdrunk ag of Bats,
but we put bets in a hat.

3017
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:13,980
And so when you have it like,
uh Oh,

3018
02:05:13,981 --> 02:05:15,600
I think so and so it's definitely gonna
win.

3019
02:05:16,110 --> 02:05:17,950
You know,
I think all of those other,

3020
02:05:17,951 --> 02:05:19,470
what I think the other guys don't think
of went and you're like,

3021
02:05:19,471 --> 02:05:20,730
well let's,
let's pick out of the hat.

3022
02:05:21,630 --> 02:05:26,550
So you have to do whatever the bed says.
Well doctor do wear a diaper for 24

3023
02:05:26,551 --> 02:05:28,290
hours.
No shitting anywhere else or pissing

3024
02:05:28,291 --> 02:05:30,390
anywhere else except in the diaper.
One change.

3025
02:05:30,391 --> 02:05:31,201
One,
change a diaper.

3026
02:05:31,201 --> 02:05:31,970
Yeah.
So I had,

3027
02:05:31,970 --> 02:05:33,850
I would have to Piss in one and I did it
in the,

3028
02:05:33,980 --> 02:05:36,420
in the,
in the shower and I took a video of it

3029
02:05:37,490 --> 02:05:38,790
and youtube was like,
nope,

3030
02:05:38,940 --> 02:05:40,050
no loud.
Wow.

3031
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:43,170
What do you mean naked?
Wearing a diaper fully wearing.

3032
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:47,760
Hmm.
I think youtube is like super,

3033
02:05:49,110 --> 02:05:51,690
they're super worried about being able
to put ads on things,

3034
02:05:52,590 --> 02:05:54,990
you know,
and being able to uh,

3035
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:57,750
keep things.
It's lame though.

3036
02:05:57,751 --> 02:05:58,980
It should be free.
I agree.

3037
02:05:59,390 --> 02:06:01,380
But who's got to pay for that
infrastructure son?

3038
02:06:03,690 --> 02:06:04,650
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

3039
02:06:04,710 --> 02:06:06,480
I guess so.
It can't be showing people fuck.

3040
02:06:06,570 --> 02:06:08,030
That would be what?
Youtube not be cocky.

3041
02:06:08,090 --> 02:06:09,170
Okay.
Not Fuck you.

3042
02:06:09,340 --> 02:06:10,290
Attrition.
I care.

3043
02:06:10,291 --> 02:06:10,950
You care.
Be Fruit.

3044
02:06:10,950 --> 02:06:13,350
You're absolutely right.
24 bit yet absolutely should be able to

3045
02:06:13,351 --> 02:06:14,620
show puffery.
Show some suck.

3046
02:06:14,621 --> 02:06:16,650
And parents you want to put some
blockers on there?

3047
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:18,490
Go ahead.
Do you know the story of a,

3048
02:06:18,491 --> 02:06:21,480
that Guy Vincent Gallo,
the actor?

3049
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:25,050
No.
Made a movie called Brown bunny.

3050
02:06:25,620 --> 02:06:27,000
Oh yeah.
It got fully got full head.

3051
02:06:28,390 --> 02:06:33,280
H and M.
Chloe's if I get to close seven g and g

3052
02:06:33,690 --> 02:06:34,790
every scene name.
Yeah.

3053
02:06:34,890 --> 02:06:39,750
And she just blew him on camera.
So she's second wave of gentrification

3054
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:41,520
when she comes into your town.
You know,

3055
02:06:41,521 --> 02:06:42,990
it's about to be,
you're still on.

3056
02:06:42,991 --> 02:06:45,570
It's cool and hip.
But the Wall Street people are going to

3057
02:06:45,571 --> 02:06:47,070
come into the second wave.
Yeah.

3058
02:06:47,580 --> 02:06:48,990
What's first wave artists?

3059
02:06:49,030 --> 02:06:52,290
Poor artists who that's they therefore
to put up with a crime.

3060
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:54,960
Right.
And then they bring the coolness factor

3061
02:06:54,961 --> 02:06:56,550
to the area.
You know,

3062
02:06:56,850 --> 02:07:00,240
they use the whoever's living there,
the indigenous mm.

3063
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:01,500
You know,
cultures.

3064
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:03,840
Yeah.
Like what they're doing downtown La.

3065
02:07:04,230 --> 02:07:05,790
Right?
Exactly.

3066
02:07:06,570 --> 02:07:07,403
Yeah,
exactly.

3067
02:07:07,740 --> 02:07:10,560
What does that shirt,
what does it say?

3068
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:11,970
Oh cool.
Blue rebels.

3069
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:14,770
Cold blue rebels.
You know Tandy Lucas sound guy in the

3070
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:16,980
minerals.
Oh no shit.

3071
02:07:17,010 --> 02:07:18,030
Yeah.
I love Danny.

3072
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:20,940
It's a,
it's a Zombie Zombie.

3073
02:07:20,941 --> 02:07:23,340
A rockabilly.
Tommy.

3074
02:07:23,341 --> 02:07:24,174
Billy,
I guess.

3075
02:07:24,540 --> 02:07:26,490
Zombie rockabilly.
Yeah.

3076
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:28,440
It's pretty cool band.
But I think that break it up.

3077
02:07:30,150 --> 02:07:32,250
So what's next are you should fear,
well,

3078
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:34,500
so I've got this netflix double special.
No,

3079
02:07:34,501 --> 02:07:35,590
I'm good.
Um,

3080
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:39,340
July 18th and building my new hour.
Oh Shit.

3081
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:41,380
Let me get back on the road and see more
places.

3082
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:44,500
I want to see more things.
Um,

3083
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:45,881
yeah,
everybody,

3084
02:07:45,881 --> 02:07:47,410
it's going to be a great double special.

3085
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:51,100
It's would be really cool now when
you're writing your new shit,

3086
02:07:51,101 --> 02:07:52,840
like when you're doing it now.
Yeah.

3087
02:07:52,990 --> 02:07:56,860
Are you incorporating experiences that
you had when you were on this walkabout

3088
02:07:56,890 --> 02:08:00,490
and now you love it?
I love the term walk off as well.

3089
02:08:00,660 --> 02:08:02,740
Oh,
you physically writing them or are you

3090
02:08:02,741 --> 02:08:05,680
like having these stores that you trying
to work out on stage or,

3091
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:08,470
I do some of that but,
but my new hour is not going to be that.

3092
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:11,480
So that those will be like side bits.
Um,

3093
02:08:12,040 --> 02:08:13,900
mostly I'm,
I'm kind of hearing what rollins said

3094
02:08:13,901 --> 02:08:15,570
too about how he does it and it's like,
oh,

3095
02:08:15,590 --> 02:08:17,800
some time to process it,
you know,

3096
02:08:17,980 --> 02:08:22,540
use it as like references and things
instead of like bits about that,

3097
02:08:22,990 --> 02:08:24,010
you know?
Right.

3098
02:08:24,011 --> 02:08:25,660
You know,
we have like such as a tag line about

3099
02:08:25,661 --> 02:08:27,460
something and not the whole bit about
something.

3100
02:08:27,490 --> 02:08:28,240
Right,
right.

3101
02:08:28,240 --> 02:08:30,520
Um,
so just in terms of like,

3102
02:08:30,730 --> 02:08:32,770
yeah,
I incorporate it when it comes up,

3103
02:08:32,771 --> 02:08:36,880
when I start thinking about it,
bill bursts out at once where it's like

3104
02:08:36,881 --> 02:08:39,900
with cigarettes in a long time ago.
Like how do you write a new album?

3105
02:08:39,901 --> 02:08:40,371
Like what,
what,

3106
02:08:40,371 --> 02:08:41,530
what's,
what do you write about,

3107
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:42,610
because I don't know what's on your
mind,

3108
02:08:42,611 --> 02:08:45,430
what gets you angry,
what gets you like riled up when you

3109
02:08:45,431 --> 02:08:49,140
talk about it to your friends,
whatever that is right about that burst.

3110
02:08:49,150 --> 02:08:52,180
Kind of an interesting thing going on
too because he does that podcast where

3111
02:08:52,181 --> 02:08:53,390
he rants.
Yeah.

3112
02:08:53,500 --> 02:08:55,600
So he just,
it's just him ranting.

3113
02:08:55,601 --> 02:08:58,980
So his,
his like ranting muscle and his ranting.

3114
02:08:58,981 --> 02:09:00,430
Good.
Durrence it's incredible.

3115
02:09:00,490 --> 02:09:02,710
I tried to do that in my intro,
so my podcast a little bit.

3116
02:09:02,711 --> 02:09:03,610
Your intros.
A great,

3117
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:04,473
thank you.
I appreciate it.

3118
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:05,040
Really good man.

3119
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:10,040
I really loved the one about Tom Cigar
and the baton has expensive tastes bow

3120
02:09:10,270 --> 02:09:13,960
and very funny.
And that was your first one back to

3121
02:09:13,980 --> 02:09:14,561
yeah,
look towards it.

3122
02:09:14,561 --> 02:09:16,630
Look at that left going like the choice
of me out of here.

3123
02:09:17,020 --> 02:09:19,150
I cannot hear him.
Narrations and those things.

3124
02:09:19,510 --> 02:09:21,620
Those are some of my favorite parts of
your podcast.

3125
02:09:21,870 --> 02:09:24,820
You're breaking down things and getting
excited about things.

3126
02:09:24,821 --> 02:09:26,750
Your enthusiasm for these things.
Yeah.

3127
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:28,450
I tried early on to realize like,
Oh,

3128
02:09:28,451 --> 02:09:31,510
this is where ads go,
so I don't want to make it just addie.

3129
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:34,270
Right.
But like let's make an actual more

3130
02:09:34,271 --> 02:09:37,270
content and then if you have to throw an
ad in there to a fine,

3131
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:40,150
but like he was going to be some good
times as well.

3132
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:41,810
Yeah.
And sometimes I don't even have that.

3133
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:43,900
They still do fucking 25 minutes.
Yeah.

3134
02:09:44,200 --> 02:09:45,010
Why not?
Yeah.

3135
02:09:45,010 --> 02:09:46,000
Why not?
If it's funny,

3136
02:09:46,060 --> 02:09:48,190
if it's not,
I'll be recording our funny and it's

3137
02:09:48,191 --> 02:09:50,230
also,
it's a different thing because you're

3138
02:09:50,231 --> 02:09:53,110
getting a chance to see you sorta
unedited,

3139
02:09:53,140 --> 02:09:54,940
just ranting.
Just,

3140
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,990
just thinking about stuff and talking.
Yeah.

3141
02:09:58,780 --> 02:10:02,500
Somebody told me when I had one after
Anderson loss for the first time and it

3142
02:10:02,501 --> 02:10:05,020
was just part of a podcast about this
girl cuts herself.

3143
02:10:05,410 --> 02:10:07,690
We'll talk about that.
But like in the,

3144
02:10:07,780 --> 02:10:10,630
in the beginning it was almost an hour
on what Anderson silver met Tamir was a

3145
02:10:10,631 --> 02:10:12,100
UFC fan.
Wow.

3146
02:10:12,190 --> 02:10:14,950
And how would he,
it was just this weird way to lose and I

3147
02:10:14,951 --> 02:10:16,510
kind of forgot about it now,
but it was like,

3148
02:10:16,511 --> 02:10:18,000
yeah,
yeah.

3149
02:10:18,040 --> 02:10:18,791
I Dunno.
It's fun.

3150
02:10:18,791 --> 02:10:21,940
But that went on for like so long.
Yeah.

3151
02:10:21,941 --> 02:10:24,340
Well that's was something that was a
real thing to you.

3152
02:10:24,341 --> 02:10:26,560
It meant something to you and that's why
it's interesting.

3153
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:29,770
He was at my first UFC,
he fought Chris Leben my very first UFC.

3154
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:31,920
Yeah.
I saw him become a champion.

3155
02:10:31,921 --> 02:10:35,780
He was like my guy.
I was at the fucking five and a half,

3156
02:10:35,781 --> 02:10:38,210
four and a half round.
Crazy ending.

3157
02:10:38,380 --> 02:10:39,650
Yeah.
To uh,

3158
02:10:39,710 --> 02:10:43,160
to jail.
I remember being in a ring with you and

3159
02:10:43,161 --> 02:10:46,040
Dana and a and M fucking superman.
What's his name?

3160
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:51,500
He won two championships at heavyweight
and light heavyweight ready to get tour.

3161
02:10:51,940 --> 02:10:54,020
Superman or whatever his name was.
What they call,

3162
02:10:54,410 --> 02:10:56,240
they call it the natural whatever.
Yeah,

3163
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:59,710
that's Super Man.
Fuck is he talking about?

3164
02:10:59,711 --> 02:11:01,700
He looked at me in a way like,
I definitely got the wrong name,

3165
02:11:01,701 --> 02:11:04,010
but whatever it is,
trying to figure out what nickname,

3166
02:11:04,011 --> 02:11:06,410
like who had the nickname superman.
Yeah,

3167
02:11:06,411 --> 02:11:08,780
but we're all in just a ring and it was
like we're all talking about whatever

3168
02:11:08,781 --> 02:11:10,550
stuff and then one at a time,
one of us,

3169
02:11:10,551 --> 02:11:14,540
you could see them like thinking about
how that fight ended four rounds plus of

3170
02:11:14,541 --> 02:11:19,010
dominance by one guy and a last minute
fucking triangle out of nowhere to keep

3171
02:11:19,011 --> 02:11:21,410
this one of the best champions of all
time.

3172
02:11:21,410 --> 02:11:22,970
Still in power.
Yup.

3173
02:11:23,120 --> 02:11:25,940
It was just so fucking nuts and you'll
see one at a time,

3174
02:11:26,090 --> 02:11:28,160
randy or somebody,
I remember Mandy doing f for someone

3175
02:11:28,161 --> 02:11:29,930
else did it.
They would just kind of go off like you

3176
02:11:29,931 --> 02:11:31,910
seem to thinking about something and
they were just like shake their hand,

3177
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:35,210
go
and you're like,

3178
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:36,290
oh,
you're thinking about that fucking

3179
02:11:36,291 --> 02:11:37,820
fight.
It was right in the hallway right

3180
02:11:37,821 --> 02:11:38,654
afterwards.
Yeah.

3181
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:39,710
God,
it was crazy.

3182
02:11:39,830 --> 02:11:41,810
Yeah.
There's a unique feeling that you get

3183
02:11:41,811 --> 02:11:45,390
when you're recounting like a crazy
event where someone knocks somebody out

3184
02:11:45,391 --> 02:11:48,960
or chokes on the hour.
Jesus look on your face times after the

3185
02:11:48,970 --> 02:11:53,120
fcs and we'd gone to dinner and be like,
Fuck Jesus Christ.

3186
02:11:54,050 --> 02:11:57,980
And I saw a burger at that same look
after at the comedy store in the front,

3187
02:11:58,100 --> 02:12:02,570
after the baby bird don't go in there.
I saw him from far away talking.

3188
02:12:02,571 --> 02:12:03,170
I was like,
Hey,

3189
02:12:03,170 --> 02:12:04,550
are you talking about the Bay Birdie?
Cause yeah,

3190
02:12:04,850 --> 02:12:06,320
I could tell.
I could tell the way you're doing it.

3191
02:12:08,510 --> 02:12:10,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

3192
02:12:10,371 --> 02:12:12,650
So that's all I'm working on.
Just building my new hour and then I can

3193
02:12:12,651 --> 02:12:15,170
get the fuck out of this garbage dump
again.

3194
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:18,710
Just garbage dump Los Angeles.
That what you're saying Hollywood.

3195
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:20,420
How dare you.
How dare you?

3196
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:23,660
This is the place where you've buttered
your bread,

3197
02:12:23,661 --> 02:12:24,201
sir.
No,

3198
02:12:24,201 --> 02:12:25,810
I like it.
The business I ended up,

3199
02:12:25,850 --> 02:12:27,700
it makes me a little mad sometimes.
The business side.

3200
02:12:27,701 --> 02:12:30,950
Yeah.
I think as p or had friended and

3201
02:12:30,951 --> 02:12:33,530
advisor,
I wouldn't say it's time to remove

3202
02:12:33,531 --> 02:12:35,900
yourself.
The other side,

3203
02:12:35,990 --> 02:12:37,940
you no longer need.
You negotiate.

3204
02:12:38,030 --> 02:12:39,950
So it's fun to travel and stuff is what
I made do.

3205
02:12:39,951 --> 02:12:40,850
I think you're right.
Oh,

3206
02:12:40,851 --> 02:12:42,320
100%.
Listen man,

3207
02:12:42,410 --> 02:12:44,810
you'll all get along way better when you
don't need them.

3208
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:46,910
Yeah.
Everybody will be your friend.

3209
02:12:46,940 --> 02:12:47,773
Yeah.
Um,

3210
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:50,420
but anyway,
yeah,

3211
02:12:50,421 --> 02:12:51,450
that's all I'm doing.
I'm working on a new,

3212
02:12:51,470 --> 02:12:52,880
I'm just gonna do it all about Judaism.

3213
02:12:54,410 --> 02:12:55,910
All about Judaism.
Think so.

3214
02:12:56,330 --> 02:12:58,760
Well that's a good way to alienate the
white supremacist.

3215
02:12:59,730 --> 02:13:01,490
Yeah.
Asshole.

3216
02:13:02,130 --> 02:13:04,730
You don't even care about the people
hate the Jews.

3217
02:13:06,250 --> 02:13:07,400
Yeah.
Sorry.

3218
02:13:07,401 --> 02:13:09,050
Sorry guys.
A bit culturally insensitive.

3219
02:13:09,110 --> 02:13:12,710
You're not even thinking about them.
Know where on,

3220
02:13:13,310 --> 02:13:16,190
we never found that video of the
evergreen professor throwing his hands

3221
02:13:16,191 --> 02:13:17,100
around.
Oh yeah.

3222
02:13:17,150 --> 02:13:18,830
There's one video.
I'm pretty sure it's in,

3223
02:13:18,831 --> 02:13:21,410
but I need to like double check and
listen to make sure it's the part

3224
02:13:21,411 --> 02:13:22,244
they're talking.
Okay.

3225
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:27,410
Sent it to me and I had,
they sent it cued up like right where it

3226
02:13:27,411 --> 02:13:29,210
is and it's,
it's so hilarious.

3227
02:13:29,240 --> 02:13:32,040
There's probably,
you know what I queued up in

3228
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:35,730
a website,
if you Google Evergreen,

3229
02:13:36,270 --> 02:13:38,150
uh,
at what does he,

3230
02:13:38,170 --> 02:13:39,960
the president ever gain Pr.
Oh,

3231
02:13:39,961 --> 02:13:44,961
I'm in evergreen hand.
Motions are a micro aggression.

3232
02:13:46,110 --> 02:13:48,240
Google that emotions are a,
and they have it.

3233
02:13:48,241 --> 02:13:51,300
There's a website for sure that as an
article where they show the video and

3234
02:13:51,301 --> 02:13:55,800
they have it queued up and when it's
queued up you can see the kids laughing

3235
02:13:56,130 --> 02:13:58,470
when they get the teacher to put his
hands behind his back.

3236
02:13:59,610 --> 02:14:00,151
Well,
see it.

3237
02:14:00,151 --> 02:14:02,760
But that's them not understanding what
they really are looking for.

3238
02:14:02,980 --> 02:14:04,740
There's a part of it feels like,
ha ha,

3239
02:14:04,830 --> 02:14:06,840
major do it,
and another part says that's a

3240
02:14:06,841 --> 02:14:07,920
microaggression.
Don't do that.

3241
02:14:07,940 --> 02:14:09,030
Where it's like,
if you believe that,

3242
02:14:09,031 --> 02:14:10,740
that don't laugh at someone for not
doing it anymore.

3243
02:14:11,010 --> 02:14:13,020
What they're doing is just enjoying
power.

3244
02:14:13,021 --> 02:14:15,210
These kids have taken over the school,
right?

3245
02:14:15,330 --> 02:14:16,170
Yeah,
that's it.

3246
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,000
Okay.
Gimme some gimme some volume

3247
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:28,470
that's
not appropriate.

3248
02:14:32,180 --> 02:14:37,180
He's apologizing.
Walks up to the presence,

3249
02:14:44,811 --> 02:14:46,170
like put your hands down,

3250
02:14:46,530 --> 02:14:48,600
puts your,
got to with his hands to his side.

3251
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:51,180
Yes.
Dude.

3252
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:52,380
And they're laughing at him.

3253
02:14:54,180 --> 02:14:58,190
Pastors were slaves and your ancestors
were not.

3254
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:02,570
Your ancestors came here.
I'll free choice and decided to bring

3255
02:15:02,571 --> 02:15:04,220
along my people.
Oh,

3256
02:15:04,221 --> 02:15:08,870
they're not out their own.
Free will to work and build this country

3257
02:15:09,800 --> 02:15:14,540
who's really letting you know that
slavery still has repercussions in

3258
02:15:14,541 --> 02:15:17,270
society today and that is what we're
here about.

3259
02:15:18,870 --> 02:15:19,720
Three per classroom.

3260
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,520
She went in for an applause over.
Thanks.

3261
02:15:22,570 --> 02:15:23,860
Yeah,
she seems to not know.

3262
02:15:24,190 --> 02:15:25,420
Oh there she goes.
Trying to get off,

3263
02:15:25,630 --> 02:15:27,610
but what does he do about that?
He's clapping as well.

3264
02:15:27,611 --> 02:15:29,340
He's clapping too.
He needs a,

3265
02:15:29,440 --> 02:15:33,700
he needs to seriously stop.
He's clapping too.

3266
02:15:33,701 --> 02:15:38,280
Like he had a really good point.
You can't sing something.

3267
02:15:38,290 --> 02:15:39,870
We know.
We already know that about,

3268
02:15:39,980 --> 02:15:40,813
you know?
Okay.

3269
02:15:41,220 --> 02:15:43,900
The version of that,
that super liberal left is the

3270
02:15:43,901 --> 02:15:46,660
feminists,
you know that version of that.

3271
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:50,830
There's a version of that which is just
the feminists like that version of

3272
02:15:50,831 --> 02:15:52,680
feminists.
That erosion.

3273
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:54,180
Yeah.
There's like this version,

3274
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:58,580
this version of masculine too,
right?

3275
02:15:58,670 --> 02:16:01,990
This isn't built right I guess.
Is it though?

3276
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:03,670
I don't know.
I don't really understand.

3277
02:16:03,690 --> 02:16:05,500
I don't know.
It seems to me like the alt right for

3278
02:16:05,501 --> 02:16:07,240
more,
more than doubled.

3279
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:09,370
A lot of what they're doing is having
fun.

3280
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:12,790
It does seem like a troll.
Like some of it's like show straight

3281
02:16:12,791 --> 02:16:16,160
trolling is a lot of it is yours todd.
I can't believe it.

3282
02:16:16,161 --> 02:16:17,410
It's like,
can't you believe it?

3283
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:18,860
Well,
maybe it was a job.

3284
02:16:19,330 --> 02:16:22,750
I mean like Milo,
Milo Yiannopoulos.

3285
02:16:22,780 --> 02:16:25,270
Surely that guy gets him so mad.
Yeah.

3286
02:16:26,410 --> 02:16:28,720
Milo is so like,
it's so,

3287
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:29,980
so much of

3288
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:31,460
what he's doing.
It seems like he's having fun.

3289
02:16:31,500 --> 02:16:34,420
I love it when they get on somebody and
you just like shit on them a little bit.

3290
02:16:34,421 --> 02:16:37,750
They get like someone's a god to them
all of a sudden beyonce after lemonade,

3291
02:16:38,170 --> 02:16:39,610
things like that.
And if you shit on them a little bit,

3292
02:16:39,611 --> 02:16:41,560
you could get people so fucking angry
or,

3293
02:16:41,561 --> 02:16:42,940
you know,
it's great.

3294
02:16:43,030 --> 02:16:46,620
It's great.
It's never been a time like this art

3295
02:16:46,700 --> 02:16:49,000
fair.
We get so many morons mad at you.

3296
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:50,790
I love it.
I love it.

3297
02:16:52,860 --> 02:16:54,190
Um,
but yeah,

3298
02:16:54,220 --> 02:16:58,210
but it's,
what I've noticed is that all of the

3299
02:16:58,210 --> 02:16:59,260
Super Liberal,
okay.

3300
02:16:59,261 --> 02:17:01,840
You know how like American sports fans
are kind of dumb.

3301
02:17:02,140 --> 02:17:03,400
How dare you,
you know,

3302
02:17:03,710 --> 02:17:07,510
not all the leads I'm hearing Moreso
that other places we're not very thought

3303
02:17:07,511 --> 02:17:10,120
out.
Rude political like analysis.

3304
02:17:10,121 --> 02:17:11,400
Isn't that smart?
No.

3305
02:17:11,420 --> 02:17:14,710
Same way our liberal left our feminism
is some of the demos feminism in the

3306
02:17:14,711 --> 02:17:15,544
world.

3307
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:19,360
Like other ones are more thought out and
more interesting and more like just

3308
02:17:19,361 --> 02:17:20,830
thoughtful in general.
Dude,

3309
02:17:20,831 --> 02:17:24,160
I think you left America and became a
fucking turncoat.

3310
02:17:24,190 --> 02:17:27,070
That's what I'm hearing.
I'm hearing a bunch of bullshit.

3311
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:30,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

3312
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:33,130
So what do you think though?
You should hear people talking.

3313
02:17:33,131 --> 02:17:34,690
They're way smarter than the people we
have.

3314
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:35,310
Like,
like,

3315
02:17:35,310 --> 02:17:37,870
so our people are just dumber saying
this microaggression shit.

3316
02:17:37,960 --> 02:17:39,810
Right.
That's us.

3317
02:17:39,811 --> 02:17:42,010
That's having too much fucking free
time.

3318
02:17:42,430 --> 02:17:43,121
Is that,
what is that?

3319
02:17:43,121 --> 02:17:46,030
As you've left behind what's actually
wrong and you're jumping on,

3320
02:17:46,060 --> 02:17:47,950
which is a lot.
There's a lot wrong.

3321
02:17:48,130 --> 02:17:51,280
Yeah.
So like worry about that and calmed out.

3322
02:17:51,290 --> 02:17:54,940
Mike Goroka show you guys,
it's not like this better shit to do,

3323
02:17:54,941 --> 02:17:56,620
so you shouldn't worry about what
actually bothers you.

3324
02:17:56,680 --> 02:17:58,400
This shutting bother you.
Right.

3325
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:01,000
You know,
take that same venom and put it into

3326
02:18:01,001 --> 02:18:02,200
something that's actually happening.

3327
02:18:02,230 --> 02:18:03,790
There's this forced,
okay.

3328
02:18:03,791 --> 02:18:05,410
But like that girl,
that circumcision,

3329
02:18:05,470 --> 02:18:09,790
the girl that's set up there and it's
like your ancestors were not slaves who

3330
02:18:09,791 --> 02:18:11,760
were brought here at mind were,
you know,

3331
02:18:11,761 --> 02:18:14,680
and slavery has repercussions and then
everybody starts clapping and it's like

3332
02:18:15,030 --> 02:18:16,780
you are,
you're right.

3333
02:18:16,810 --> 02:18:20,050
But what is the point?
What are we doing?

3334
02:18:20,051 --> 02:18:20,680
Like,
yeah,

3335
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:23,830
it's all obviously ancestors.
Like when do we get over this ancestor

3336
02:18:23,831 --> 02:18:25,750
thing?
Like how many generations in do we do we

3337
02:18:25,751 --> 02:18:28,240
just treat people as individuals and as
people,

3338
02:18:28,241 --> 02:18:29,530
it's nice.
What do they want?

3339
02:18:29,590 --> 02:18:33,910
Some people got an advantage for sure.
White people got an advantage for sure.

3340
02:18:34,450 --> 02:18:35,231
But it's not,
it's,

3341
02:18:35,231 --> 02:18:36,550
it's,
it's more so,

3342
02:18:36,640 --> 02:18:39,430
but it's not 100% of the time.
So if I came from,

3343
02:18:39,431 --> 02:18:39,880
uh,
from,

3344
02:18:39,880 --> 02:18:40,630
uh,
uh,

3345
02:18:40,630 --> 02:18:42,720
divorced household,
I didn't write,

3346
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:45,030
you know,
and my dad wasn't around and my dad beat

3347
02:18:45,031 --> 02:18:46,270
my mom,
you know,

3348
02:18:46,450 --> 02:18:50,650
that can be a way worse and harder
experience then the cosby kids.

3349
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:51,783
Right.
You know?

3350
02:18:51,800 --> 02:18:53,830
Right.
So it's like,

3351
02:18:53,831 --> 02:18:57,250
just because you're this,
it might make the odds harder for you,

3352
02:18:57,251 --> 02:18:59,860
but it's not 100%,
but there's an origins thing.

3353
02:18:59,890 --> 02:19:04,750
And one of the origins that every black
kid has to face when they think about

3354
02:19:04,751 --> 02:19:07,840
it,
is it someone down the line was a slave

3355
02:19:08,230 --> 02:19:11,620
and they're not slaves anymore.
But that's why people who look like him

3356
02:19:11,621 --> 02:19:14,260
are here.
They're all here because someone brought

3357
02:19:14,261 --> 02:19:15,880
them over here in chains.
Yeah.

3358
02:19:15,881 --> 02:19:17,320
And there's still true with remnants of
that.

3359
02:19:17,380 --> 02:19:18,160
Right.
And there's some,

3360
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:23,160
there's gotta be a weird self esteem or
a self identity issue attached to

3361
02:19:23,951 --> 02:19:26,650
knowing that everybody knows who your
ancestors were.

3362
02:19:26,651 --> 02:19:28,070
Slaves.
And there's

3363
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:30,470
a certain,
like there's a certain thing that people

3364
02:19:30,471 --> 02:19:34,730
do when someone has something and
someone else wants it.

3365
02:19:35,350 --> 02:19:35,740
Okay.

3366
02:19:35,740 --> 02:19:37,390
You,
if you have a,

3367
02:19:37,391 --> 02:19:41,620
a group of people that's different,
it's like really easy to almost think of

3368
02:19:41,621 --> 02:19:44,680
them as not you.
Like that's how they've justified wars.

3369
02:19:44,950 --> 02:19:49,030
That's how so many people I by
dehumanizing the other,

3370
02:19:49,540 --> 02:19:52,820
you know,
and this,

3371
02:19:52,850 --> 02:19:57,440
this thing that has to balance out that
I cass is,

3372
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:02,690
I guess just the echoes of that.
It's like we have to get so many

3373
02:20:02,691 --> 02:20:07,691
generations away from the,
from people being slaves and any

3374
02:20:08,241 --> 02:20:10,760
repercussions of it.
Socially I cannot,

3375
02:20:10,761 --> 02:20:13,880
we have to get so far away that it
doesn't factor anymore where we don't

3376
02:20:13,881 --> 02:20:14,510
care.
Okay.

3377
02:20:14,510 --> 02:20:16,130
That's well expressed for sure.
Yeah.

3378
02:20:16,460 --> 02:20:17,293
I like that.

3379
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:20,680
That kind of like calm way to explain
something.

3380
02:20:20,681 --> 02:20:23,740
Rarely gets put out and of course
screaming and yelling.

3381
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:25,450
You know why?
Like you're not teaching anyone

3382
02:20:25,451 --> 02:20:27,520
anything.
The biggest problem on the left and the

3383
02:20:27,521 --> 02:20:28,660
right,
but the ones that are angry,

3384
02:20:28,661 --> 02:20:30,910
the angry mobs is they never seek to
educate.

3385
02:20:30,911 --> 02:20:34,090
They only seek to like punish.
Also grandstand.

3386
02:20:34,150 --> 02:20:36,850
They want to make this bigger here in
that lady's voice,

3387
02:20:36,851 --> 02:20:39,240
she was going for audience.
The audience clap two,

3388
02:20:39,310 --> 02:20:40,420
three times,
didn't get it.

3389
02:20:40,421 --> 02:20:41,500
And it was like,
I'll keep going.

3390
02:20:41,710 --> 02:20:44,140
She's seen Oprah.
She knows how to manipulate a crowd.

3391
02:20:44,920 --> 02:20:46,600
She knows how to get those people riled
up.

3392
02:20:46,870 --> 02:20:48,220
Yeah.
Well listen man,

3393
02:20:48,370 --> 02:20:52,000
that's part of being a person.
Like that's half the reward for saying

3394
02:20:52,001 --> 02:20:55,660
something that's right is the love that
you get from people when you say that

3395
02:20:55,661 --> 02:20:57,400
it's right and they recognize it.
And they go,

3396
02:20:57,401 --> 02:20:58,120
yes.

3397
02:20:58,120 --> 02:21:00,250
So people get addicted to that.
Yes.

3398
02:21:00,370 --> 02:21:05,230
So they constantly do things that they
think are at least perceived as being

3399
02:21:05,231 --> 02:21:09,730
right and they get very vocal with
things when they perceive those things

3400
02:21:09,731 --> 02:21:13,060
are going to get a very big reaction for
standing up against them.

3401
02:21:13,360 --> 02:21:17,920
And it becomes this moral high ground,
sort of grand standing peacocking sort

3402
02:21:17,921 --> 02:21:21,270
of a thing where they just are
constantly trying to let everyone who

3403
02:21:21,271 --> 02:21:25,450
know how uncool it is to do this and how
wrong it is to do that.

3404
02:21:25,451 --> 02:21:30,451
Like settle the fuck down like weird,
weird thing.

3405
02:21:30,641 --> 02:21:33,130
And then sometimes they'll see something
that doesn't quite fit in.

3406
02:21:33,131 --> 02:21:34,330
Like they'll sit there was trying to
make,

3407
02:21:34,360 --> 02:21:36,490
you know how they make rape a broader
and broader and broader.

3408
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:39,100
Oh yeah.
Which was really does think does a

3409
02:21:39,101 --> 02:21:43,910
disservice to ripe it does to be able to
make it seem like anyway,

3410
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:46,300
there was some coercion is rape where if
you talk someone into it,

3411
02:21:46,630 --> 02:21:47,350
yes,
that's right.

3412
02:21:47,350 --> 02:21:49,600
And then a bunch of men was like,
oh well if that's true then I've been

3413
02:21:49,601 --> 02:21:51,790
raped a bunch of times.
This is the super liberal left.

3414
02:21:51,791 --> 02:21:52,241
It's like,
oh,

3415
02:21:52,241 --> 02:21:54,430
we don't want to make that.
We were on wanting to make you be able

3416
02:21:54,431 --> 02:21:55,300
to evict them,
so okay,

3417
02:21:55,301 --> 02:21:58,630
that's no longer rape.
Coercion was one,

3418
02:21:58,900 --> 02:22:02,050
someone under the influence of alcohol,
which was very questionable.

3419
02:22:02,470 --> 02:22:06,010
That's a weird one because we all know
that there's different states of mind

3420
02:22:06,100 --> 02:22:11,100
and that a woman who decides to get how
to get a couple drinks and then wants to

3421
02:22:11,921 --> 02:22:15,490
have sex if the man is sober and it was
a weird one.

3422
02:22:15,670 --> 02:22:17,860
It's supposed to be that you're not
supposed to do it because she's under

3423
02:22:17,861 --> 02:22:20,890
the influence like that was,
that was the argument that was be

3424
02:22:20,920 --> 02:22:23,680
opposition to black and white.
So it's like I know a lot of women who

3425
02:22:23,681 --> 02:22:24,191
were like,
oh,

3426
02:22:24,191 --> 02:22:26,760
I can't have sex without,
I have to drink before I have sex.

3427
02:22:27,180 --> 02:22:27,901
And it's like,
oh,

3428
02:22:27,901 --> 02:22:29,580
what's so then,
okay,

3429
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:31,380
it's a split.
Said they don't all think the same

3430
02:22:31,381 --> 02:22:32,250
thing.
Of course.

3431
02:22:32,251 --> 02:22:35,580
So some of them,
the militant ones want to say you're a

3432
02:22:35,581 --> 02:22:37,440
rapist now,
and some of the other one's like,

3433
02:22:37,441 --> 02:22:37,680
no,
no.

3434
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:41,100
Women could take control of themselves.
They can have some drinks and lubricate

3435
02:22:41,101 --> 02:22:43,490
themselves if they want to.
It's also really the only time we're

3436
02:22:43,500 --> 02:22:47,820
ever asking people to the,
like we're saying like you don't have

3437
02:22:47,821 --> 02:22:48,930
control,
right.

3438
02:22:48,931 --> 02:22:51,900
You're not even responsible for what
you're doing as opposed to like driving.

3439
02:22:52,380 --> 02:22:53,950
Like if you're under the influence and
drive,

3440
02:22:53,951 --> 02:22:54,960
like no one says,
hey,

3441
02:22:55,590 --> 02:22:59,070
it wasn't your fault that you plowed
into that school bus full of kids with

3442
02:22:59,071 --> 02:23:01,170
your car because you were drunk,
but used to be the rule.

3443
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:02,580
You couldn't control it.
Well,

3444
02:23:02,581 --> 02:23:05,370
it still is the rule,
but I'm saying like it's,

3445
02:23:05,630 --> 02:23:07,800
they'll say that if it comes to sexual
intercourse,

3446
02:23:08,050 --> 02:23:09,810
but they won't say that it comes to
driving.

3447
02:23:09,930 --> 02:23:13,290
Like no one's going to say you couldn't
consent to being behind the wheel.

3448
02:23:13,440 --> 02:23:15,150
You were under,
the influence is not your fault,

3449
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:19,560
but you're supposed to know enough.
Like it's supposed to be deeply embedded

3450
02:23:19,561 --> 02:23:22,470
in your head enough that you don't go
into that car and started,

3451
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:24,120
even though you're drunk,
but sex,

3452
02:23:24,121 --> 02:23:24,580
you're like,
no,

3453
02:23:24,580 --> 02:23:25,130
no.
Yeah,

3454
02:23:25,130 --> 02:23:25,980
that was,
you can't handle it.

3455
02:23:26,150 --> 02:23:27,180
Yeah,
you can't handle it.

3456
02:23:27,181 --> 02:23:30,900
You don't know what's going on.
It's like desperate drunk driver.

3457
02:23:30,901 --> 02:23:32,520
You ran over somebody while you were
drunk driving and they're like,

3458
02:23:32,521 --> 02:23:33,600
I'm sorry officer.
I was like,

3459
02:23:33,630 --> 02:23:34,560
you know,
self defense.

3460
02:23:34,620 --> 02:23:35,670
I was drunk.
Same Shit.

3461
02:23:35,810 --> 02:23:36,960
Right.
I wouldn't do it on purpose.

3462
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:38,820
I didn't do it on purpose.
I was drunk.

3463
02:23:38,821 --> 02:23:41,160
That's why I lost control the car.
Obviously it's hard to control the car

3464
02:23:41,161 --> 02:23:41,880
and you're drunk.
Right.

3465
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:44,460
So that's what happened to me.
When did it become illegal to drink and

3466
02:23:44,461 --> 02:23:45,800
I don't know.
I don't know.

3467
02:23:45,801 --> 02:23:46,950
That's a very good question.
Yeah,

3468
02:23:47,020 --> 02:23:50,050
I look that up.
We're not too long because it sees my

3469
02:23:50,600 --> 02:23:52,310
peers,
my friends and whatnot.

3470
02:23:52,490 --> 02:23:54,580
They did it.
Or like in the 70s or

3471
02:23:54,620 --> 02:23:56,480
like what your thoughts on it?
Let's Google it and find out.

3472
02:23:56,481 --> 02:23:57,470
Liberal.
Let's take a guess.

3473
02:23:57,560 --> 02:24:02,560
I say fifties fifties I 61 that's how
late in the fifties I'm going to go with

3474
02:24:04,131 --> 02:24:07,370
69 okay.
This is fun to say that.

3475
02:24:07,400 --> 02:24:08,480
I think I'm wrong.
No,

3476
02:24:09,530 --> 02:24:13,250
73 73 that seems so late.
Maybe.

3477
02:24:13,610 --> 02:24:14,760
Maybe.
Hmm.

3478
02:24:16,580 --> 02:24:18,160
I feel like I should stick to the
sixties

3479
02:24:18,300 --> 02:24:23,300
first state that adopted any sort of law
was New York in 1910 but um,

3480
02:24:25,950 --> 02:24:28,740
port we off.
I didn't know what that car is that I

3481
02:24:28,741 --> 02:24:33,741
feel like when I looked this up before I
thought cars like late twenties people

3482
02:24:34,291 --> 02:24:37,260
were drug two years into having cars
don't get on your horse.

3483
02:24:37,770 --> 02:24:38,640
It's hilarious.

3484
02:24:38,880 --> 02:24:42,690
Remember looking this up,
I think like if sometime in the fifties

3485
02:24:42,690 --> 02:24:46,260
or sixties or maybe even as up to like
1980 when mad started data,

3486
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:48,600
the states that weren't adopting it,
we're going to get stopped getting

3487
02:24:48,601 --> 02:24:51,520
funding for federal road ladies like
that.

3488
02:24:51,560 --> 02:24:54,150
So they had to adopt all the laws.
That's like how they forced everyone.

3489
02:24:54,740 --> 02:24:55,770
Dude,
of course people would drink.

3490
02:24:55,890 --> 02:24:58,020
It would be a bunch of people drive.
But have you tried driving yet?

3491
02:24:58,220 --> 02:24:58,951
Dude,
it's awesome.

3492
02:24:58,951 --> 02:25:00,360
And the sun was like,
have you tried to drunk?

3493
02:25:00,960 --> 02:25:03,030
No,
I'm for sure going to do that.

3494
02:25:03,031 --> 02:25:06,420
Sounds like a great idea.
See that's where a horse is superior

3495
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:09,390
because the horse isn't going to crash
because the horse is so bought a pilot.

3496
02:25:09,440 --> 02:25:09,991
Yeah.
Yeah.

3497
02:25:09,991 --> 02:25:11,080
I mean,
it's almost like a form.

3498
02:25:11,081 --> 02:25:12,730
You pass that on top of it.
Oh boy.

3499
02:25:12,810 --> 02:25:15,990
Here your form of travel and a lot of
ways you have a relationship with this

3500
02:25:15,991 --> 02:25:18,900
animal.
You know like you up to hey there,

3501
02:25:19,350 --> 02:25:21,420
mister flapjacks or whatever the fuck
his name is.

3502
02:25:21,740 --> 02:25:25,720
You pat them a good old boy and we get
you some feed and give you put the

3503
02:25:25,721 --> 02:25:29,350
feedback,
chooses food like what the fuck man.

3504
02:25:29,380 --> 02:25:32,560
That's probably a way better way of
getting around as long as you're not

3505
02:25:32,561 --> 02:25:33,520
allergic to horses.

3506
02:25:35,170 --> 02:25:36,400
Yeah.
That's why I said,

3507
02:25:36,401 --> 02:25:37,720
well,
if you're allergic to horse in the West,

3508
02:25:37,721 --> 02:25:41,980
too fucked you're living here.
Not a fuck is a person allergic to

3509
02:25:41,981 --> 02:25:44,350
horses.
This is how weak our gene pool has

3510
02:25:44,351 --> 02:25:45,980
gotten folks.
Yeah.

3511
02:25:46,180 --> 02:25:48,230
That's sad.
I feel sad.

3512
02:25:48,340 --> 02:25:53,340
I feel so bad for people that are
allergic to animals and people that are

3513
02:25:53,801 --> 02:25:58,801
allergic to pollen and people that are
allergic to a lot of people close to me

3514
02:25:59,291 --> 02:26:00,240
have allergies.
It's,

3515
02:26:00,310 --> 02:26:04,100
it's so hard to watch because it's
annoying like that,

3516
02:26:04,130 --> 02:26:06,520
that there's a thing out there that can
do that to them.

3517
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:09,090
Like what the fuck is that?
Doesn't even make any sense.

3518
02:26:09,091 --> 02:26:10,000
And it's not that,
it's not the thing.

3519
02:26:10,001 --> 02:26:11,860
Self defense mechanism.
Now it's dumb.

3520
02:26:12,130 --> 02:26:15,160
It's like grass.
Some kids are super allergic to types of

3521
02:26:15,161 --> 02:26:17,560
grass.
There's kids that will um,

3522
02:26:17,620 --> 02:26:20,620
like they have celiacs.
My kids are friends with them and you

3523
02:26:20,621 --> 02:26:22,000
know,
you have to be real careful that they

3524
02:26:22,001 --> 02:26:23,310
don't eat anything that has any wheat.

3525
02:26:23,500 --> 02:26:24,530
Uh,
if they're going to tell you this brief,

3526
02:26:24,540 --> 02:26:27,350
careful of it become too much friends
with them now they have,

3527
02:26:27,520 --> 02:26:31,750
they can eat or to your home.
They have to very strict science is,

3528
02:26:31,751 --> 02:26:32,680
yeah,
it's crazy.

3529
02:26:32,710 --> 02:26:35,080
Real super strict diets cause they have
an allergy.

3530
02:26:35,350 --> 02:26:38,080
I've heard about your phone gets all hot
things happen to you.

3531
02:26:38,380 --> 02:26:40,180
Did it?
How much is your fucking straight like

3532
02:26:40,181 --> 02:26:42,550
peanuts.
Like if you have that like

3533
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:46,360
two rows behind you in a plane,
you're fucked.

3534
02:26:46,390 --> 02:26:49,360
Brian Collins Mom,
he said on the podcast he was talking

3535
02:26:49,361 --> 02:26:52,870
about if she eats Brazil nuts,
she gets like terribly ill.

3536
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:55,660
Well I got the resilience of ones that
gross though.

3537
02:26:55,840 --> 02:26:57,040
They're not that good.
They're big.

3538
02:26:57,070 --> 02:26:58,240
Yeah.
They ain't shit big.

3539
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:00,620
They ain't shit macadamia nuts,
macadamia,

3540
02:27:02,110 --> 02:27:04,360
Damian.
But nobody's putting Brazil nuts and

3541
02:27:04,361 --> 02:27:06,820
chocolate the fuck out of here with that
big stupid not

3542
02:27:08,860 --> 02:27:13,860
big stupid weird tasting
that you didn't have to buy a shoe and

3543
02:27:14,501 --> 02:27:15,640
you eat that piece of shit.

3544
02:27:15,990 --> 02:27:18,160
You've got to fucking give me half of it
now and half of it later.

3545
02:27:18,480 --> 02:27:21,730
If you have like if you told me Dude,
you get a pass on one nut for the rest

3546
02:27:21,731 --> 02:27:24,510
of your life right off the bat it over
show that,

3547
02:27:24,670 --> 02:27:25,391
think about it.
Yeah,

3548
02:27:25,391 --> 02:27:29,950
like I kind of like walnuts.
It's an unusual dry flavor at that weird

3549
02:27:29,951 --> 02:27:33,940
once in a while with some salt on them.
Imagine if there was like some on yeas

3550
02:27:33,941 --> 02:27:38,140

Same way there are for like ones like

3551
02:27:38,141 --> 02:27:41,800
sat you down and was talking to you
about the cashews he's about to serve as

3552
02:27:41,801 --> 02:27:45,540
a cashew from the Himalayas.
You could open a whole restaurant called

3553
02:27:45,550 --> 02:27:46,383
these nuts.

3554
02:27:51,010 --> 02:27:52,900
Joe,
I got to go take pictures of my netflix

3555
02:27:53,020 --> 02:27:54,830
double specially called double neck.
That's what I hit.

3556
02:27:54,880 --> 02:27:59,680
July Ari Shaffir rocking in and Roland,
I'm very excited that you're going to

3558
02:28:03,881 --> 02:28:05,500

3560
02:28:07,151 --> 02:28:08,890
You're going to release it.
You're going to be out of town.

3561
02:28:08,980 --> 02:28:09,813
Jesus,
Bitch,

3562
02:28:09,820 --> 02:28:10,800
what day is it?
Uh,

3563
02:28:10,930 --> 02:28:13,000
July 10th.
What about the day before that?

3564
02:28:13,001 --> 02:28:14,170
I'm out of town then.
Yeah.

3565
02:28:14,171 --> 02:28:15,340
You're,
you're going to be on vacation.

3566
02:28:15,341 --> 02:28:16,990
That okay.
Shit.

3567
02:28:17,260 --> 02:28:17,831
Yeah.
Well,

3568
02:28:17,831 --> 02:28:20,090
we're working at a time.
Um,

3569
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:21,920
when I,
when are you leaving from here?

3570
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:23,220
Yeah.
When are you getting worse?

3571
02:28:23,360 --> 02:28:24,710
That's when you're going back to that
dirty,

3572
02:28:24,711 --> 02:28:26,570
stinky,
stacked up.

3573
02:28:26,810 --> 02:28:29,990
We could really fast forward one off
this and release it later.

3574
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:33,140
Record one off this off.
Not In the studio.

3575
02:28:33,910 --> 02:28:35,210
Let's go up on a hike by your house.

3576
02:28:35,270 --> 02:28:37,000
Let's do a hike and we'll do a hike.
Podcasts,

3577
02:28:37,360 --> 02:28:38,720
podcasts.
You can put it out the day of.

3578
02:28:38,721 --> 02:28:39,650
I like it.
Would that work?

3579
02:28:39,710 --> 02:28:41,000
Yes,
absolutely.

3580
02:28:41,150 --> 02:28:42,170
Beautiful.
All right.

3581
02:28:42,171 --> 02:28:43,250
That's what it is.
Okay.

3582
02:28:43,460 --> 02:28:45,050
Ladies and Jan.
Oh Man.

3583
02:28:45,051 --> 02:28:47,930
Make sure you download Arusha fears.
Skeptic tank.

3584
02:28:48,050 --> 02:28:52,160
It's one of the best podcasts in the
known universe and it's one that I never

3585
02:28:52,161 --> 02:28:54,130
missed a lunch trucks,
sports as well.

3586
02:28:54,830 --> 02:28:57,800
While you're always missing it.
Punch drunk sports too.

3587
02:28:58,010 --> 02:28:58,700
Yeah,
but yeah,

3588
02:28:58,700 --> 02:28:59,630
but you listen to skeptic.
Thanks.

3589
02:28:59,631 --> 02:29:00,141
That's great.
Yeah,

3590
02:29:00,141 --> 02:29:03,110
I do worry about that.
I'm not a sports fan so much.

3591
02:29:03,170 --> 02:29:04,820
So the punch drunk.
I listened to you guys when you're

3592
02:29:04,821 --> 02:29:07,490
talking about fights and I always want
to call in and go now.

3593
02:29:07,491 --> 02:29:07,911
Now,
now,

3594
02:29:07,911 --> 02:29:08,361
now,
now,

3595
02:29:08,361 --> 02:29:08,811
now,
now,

3596
02:29:08,811 --> 02:29:09,141
now.
No,

3597
02:29:09,141 --> 02:29:10,760
that's not how I got my asshole beliefs.
Just heard.

3598
02:29:10,770 --> 02:29:12,380
I heard.
I heard a saw pictures,

3599
02:29:12,381 --> 02:29:12,730
Tripoli.

3600
02:29:12,730 --> 02:29:15,850
I mean a serenity set up.
Hold up on my butt cheeks.

3601
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:18,140
How'd that feel?
Weird,

3602
02:29:18,141 --> 02:29:20,240
man.
Imagine if you were comfortable with it

3603
02:29:20,241 --> 02:29:21,810
then it'd be a problem.
Right?

3604
02:29:21,980 --> 02:29:23,840
Dude had his fucking finger right under
the rim.

3605
02:29:23,841 --> 02:29:25,220
I kept thinking of just going to go
forward.

3606
02:29:25,460 --> 02:29:27,800
So he had a touch your asshole.
I was bleaching it.

3607
02:29:27,801 --> 02:29:29,180
Yeah.
What does he look?

3608
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:30,590
He had a glove.
What?

3609
02:29:30,591 --> 02:29:31,960
This guy looked like.
Uh,

3610
02:29:32,180 --> 02:29:33,470
can I class?
Can I guess?

3611
02:29:33,471 --> 02:29:35,480
Sure.
I would guess the Diaz like,

3612
02:29:35,481 --> 02:29:39,830
um,
like limp and plants and botox and just

3613
02:29:39,831 --> 02:29:42,860
like an oddly shiny forehead.
And He,

3614
02:29:42,861 --> 02:29:45,590
um,
he's got a perfect haircut and he's,

3615
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:50,750
he's very feminine but in a weird sort
of way and he's just rubbing and he's a

3616
02:29:50,751 --> 02:29:53,390
suit on and he's just,
he has white gloves,

3617
02:29:53,420 --> 02:29:55,640
their white gloves,
like with the lines in the back of him.

3618
02:29:55,641 --> 02:29:59,420
Like Mickey Mouse has
like a Butler's glove,

3619
02:30:02,320 --> 02:30:03,730
both to give you a hint.
[inaudible]

3620
02:30:03,860 --> 02:30:06,740
who got the person?
So it was an Armenian?

3621
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:07,790
No,
he,

3622
02:30:07,830 --> 02:30:10,790
well,
he was a gimp wearing a mask with a

3623
02:30:10,791 --> 02:30:14,180
leather leash around them and a
codpiece.

3624
02:30:14,620 --> 02:30:16,370
Hmm.
That's better.

3625
02:30:16,371 --> 02:30:18,560
It was looking for a porn star,
but one couldn't do it,

3626
02:30:18,561 --> 02:30:20,210
so he got this instead.
That's amazing.

3627
02:30:20,230 --> 02:30:21,590
Yeah.
It was the person nice to you.

3628
02:30:21,650 --> 02:30:22,700
Yeah,
it was plenty of pretty nice,

3629
02:30:22,760 --> 02:30:25,550
beautiful mustache through his,
through his gip mask and that's it.

3630
02:30:26,750 --> 02:30:28,250
Wow.
Well there you have it,

3631
02:30:28,251 --> 02:30:30,360
ladies and gentlemen,

3632
02:30:30,380 --> 02:30:33,270
A lot of content,

3633
02:30:34,410 --> 02:30:37,790
I'm not doing too much travel and stuff,
but yeah.

3634
02:30:37,980 --> 02:30:39,770
All right.
I want to get killed her mic on.

3635
02:30:40,400 --> 02:30:41,233
Yeah,

3636
02:30:42,350 --> 02:30:44,050
The revolution.
Okay,

3637
02:30:44,051 --> 02:30:46,730
well let's go get them in town.
We'll do have them do both.

3638
02:30:46,780 --> 02:30:48,440
Okay.
Or we could do a swap cast.

3639
02:30:48,950 --> 02:30:50,960
Ooh.
Put it up wherever you want.

3640
02:30:51,020 --> 02:30:51,480
Yeah.
You know,

02:30:51,480 --> 02:30:56,480
swap cast is sort of Bab burt and uh,

3642
02:30:57,080 --> 02:30:59,360

sort of like we did with the end of the

3643
02:30:59,361 --> 02:31:00,860
world.
Like everybody put the end of the world

3644
02:31:00,861 --> 02:31:03,470
up right when we did the end of the
world podcast on election night.

3645
02:31:03,770 --> 02:31:05,060
Um,
everybody got it.

3646
02:31:05,210 --> 02:31:07,430
We just sent a copy of it and everybody
just put it up.

3647
02:31:08,150 --> 02:31:09,290
Swab cast.
That's cool.

3648
02:31:09,291 --> 02:31:10,670
I do.
Yay.

3649
02:31:10,671 --> 02:31:12,540
It's democratic or something.
Yeah.

3650
02:31:13,010 --> 02:31:14,240
All right folks.
That's it.

3651
02:31:14,540 --> 02:31:16,070
Love you.
Bye Bye.

3652
02:31:16,071 --> 02:31:16,580
