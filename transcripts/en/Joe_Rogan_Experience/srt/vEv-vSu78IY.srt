1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,380
Oh Shit.
Tommy pumps with live yo dog.

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,030
What's up brother?
What's up man?

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,360
We already did a podcast.
We totally did.

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,930
Yeah,
we just,

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,240
we just went off.
We started going off about everything.

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,750
That was really lost in it to me too.
Well,

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:25,250
excuse me folks.
We're slightly intoxicated.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,780
Yeah,
that's what happens.

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,270
Dj Dad mouth,
you know what I'm saying?

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,000
Have you done any variations to Dj dad 
mouth now?

11
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,850
Have you got bored with it or you.
I'm totally bored with it.

12
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:39,310
I just stopped doing well.
I just haven't actually done that much a

13
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,350
morning tv shows lately.
So there was a bunch of those in a row 

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,460
that cut down with folks.
I'm sorry,

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,510
I didn't even drink the butter coffee.
Um,

16
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,100
what did you decide to just stop doing 
those things?

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,670
They stopped it.
I,

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,110
you know,
if I was doing morning press tomorrow 

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:00,140
and I just wanted to do something to 
entertain myself,

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,280
I would just do it again.

21
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,420
I met a lot of really nice people on 
Morning TV.

22
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,390
Yeah.
But it's the most restrictive venue.

23
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,120
It's really,
it's a bad idea from the,

24
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,270
from the thing is here,
like comedy clubs or just thinking we 

25
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:18,140
got to let as many people know about you
to sell tickets.

26
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,610
There's a certain point when you're a 
certain type of comic basically,

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,960
where you're like,
that's not my,

28
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,790
my audience is not gonna find me there.
People aren't going to come because of.

29
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,310
I just feel like it's a waste of time 
with certain comics to do.

30
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,120
Good Morning Toledo,
you know?

31
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,530
Yeah.
Like what percentage of the people that 

32
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:38,530
are watching.
Good Morning Toledo would like your app.

33
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:39,110
Yeah,
it's real low.

34
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,690
It's,
it's not,

35
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:42,740
it's not high.
You know what I mean?

36
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:45,170
So you go sure though.
Like who watches those?

37
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,020
Who Watches those morning shows?
If you had a guest?

38
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,400
I guess mostly yeah,
I would say mostly.

39
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,150
Mostly housewives.
Yeah,

40
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,970
with their children.
Young children.

41
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,200
And then they get,
you know,

42
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,630
the guy's like,
I'm gonna show you how to make a chicken

43
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,420
that really isn't here when we come 
back.

44
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,160
You know?
What about retired people?

45
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Would that be on the demo?
And then you don't know what you don't 

46
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,400
see.
A lot of at my shows,

47
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,620
but like moms stay at home mom or 
whatever and retired people so they're 

48
00:02:12,471 --> 00:02:13,260
not asking.
Yeah.

49
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,700
It's a totally different art form folks.
Yeah.

50
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,810
Yeah.
They don't really.

51
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,790
They do the blast.
Some people are good at though.

52
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,550
Yeah.
Like,

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,510
oh,
there's some are good.

54
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:28,540
Did you ever see Tracy Morgan when,
when he was pulled his shirt up but 

55
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,560
still started hitting his stomach and he
was saying that someone was getting 

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:32,560
pregnant.
That's probably the best.

57
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,550
Good morning.
Anything of all time.

58
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,860
And he was in Chicago and I think he 
ended up.

59
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,540
He goes,
Horace Grant,

60
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,820
which is,
you know,

61
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,580
the old power forward for the Chicago 
Bulls.

62
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,790
That was such a great fucking Improv 
line right then.

63
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,810
Oh,
that's hilarious.

64
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,840
That was like the,
the button on the whole thing where 

65
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:55,840
you're like,
Jesus,

66
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,420
he just shout it out.
He told him that.

67
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,400
It's so funny.

68
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,820
It's the best one.
Tracy Morgan's fucking hilarious.

69
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

70
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,160
He was slapping his belly and he's 
saying someone was getting pregnant.

71
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,620
It's absurd.

72
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,280
So people get to pay to see your show.
They'll just see you smack it on your.

73
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,320
Take all the power back.
Wait a minute,

74
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,740
I've got to take the power back.
Where the back.

75
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:30,490
Oh,
we just lost your microphone on your 

76
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,070
phone.
You might want to put taxes.

77
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,840
Come on.
Don't go to this texts.

78
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Just the sample of what people can 
expect more shirtless.

79
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,700
Actually love James t dot kirk.
I went to Vietnam.

80
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,770
Tracy,
one of your favorite characters.

81
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,900
Characters.
He knew one of my wheelchair globe with.

82
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,310
Fingers cut off.
I'm going to step back a little bit.

83
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,770
Spoonie.
Look,

84
00:04:07,771 --> 00:04:09,130
can you do that for me?
This is the character.

85
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,160
You don't.
One of my terrible,

86
00:04:11,161 --> 00:04:13,380
I guess.
Let me see.

87
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,720
Spoonie love was,
um,

88
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,900
shame.
More graphic.

89
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,650
Yeah,
you're right.

90
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:24,651
You can't get this children watching.
But I did get this leg blown off.

91
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,340
So that's.
I love.

92
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,780
That's nice.
Me.

93
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,250
Come see me.
I'm at the comic strip,

94
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,380
the comic script.
Tracy Morgan will perform this week.

95
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,920
Still available.
Who knows what's going to happen?

96
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:58,040
I was just can keep up on that.
The,

97
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,690
uh,
the um,

98
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,750
the horace grant reference in that 
Chicago one is.

99
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:06,620
So it's such the funniest choice.
It's such a little detail.

100
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,540
Like that was so funny that he went 
like,

101
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,720
I need fingerless wheelchair because he 
said he's already thinking this is what 

102
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,011
it's like to sit in a wheelchair.
But I love when the shout out like it 

103
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:20,480
was in Chicago.
So you're thinking bulls.

104
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,120
Anybody could have said shout out to 
Michael Jordan.

105
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,670
Right.
Or second most famous Scottie pippin and

106
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,680
it's still funny.
But like the reference to almost like it

107
00:05:31,851 --> 00:05:34,520
was like an inside bulls reference,
you know,

108
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:39,521
it's like so specific to you.
It's like the perfect third on the list 

109
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:42,350
name to shout out and plus the name 
sounds better.

110
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,020
Horace grant is just a better name to 
yell,

111
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,470
you know the name?
Horace Horace Grant.

112
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,540
And then the newscasters are like,
alright,

113
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,230
see you later.
Like they don't know what do.

114
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,040
It's so funny though.

115
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,370
Yeah.
That guy was trying to get them to do 

116
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:03,370
impressions while he's in the middle of 
that.

117
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:03,830
That was in Chicago by the way.
Where was that?

118
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:08,831
That was Texas.
Why was that guy trying to get them to 

119
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:09,350
do impressions while he's in the middle 
of that amazing rant?

120
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,800
He didn't know what to do.
Do you think that people were in his 

121
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:14,800
ear?
Were they telling them,

122
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:14,800
uh,
they're like,

123
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,140
just watch him time to change it.
Get them to change it,

124
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,340
change the subject.
Did they put something in his ear,

125
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:19,630
do you think?
Did they,

126
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,990
those guys have earpieces?
Yes.

127
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:22,450
Usually most of the time,
yes.

128
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,170
Earpieces is weird,
man.

129
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,830
When someone's talking in your ear and 
you're talking is one of the most 

130
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,050
distracting things,
it's very difficult to hear someone talk

131
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:35,300
and then still maintain.
You guys do that in the fights.

132
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,730
Very rarely.
There are so good at,

133
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,260
but when you pop it in,
they never talked.

134
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,770
They never talk over me like there's 
never,

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,100
I mean,
they're so good.

136
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,680
Is that earpiece feeding you anything 
though or just.

137
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,320
Yeah.
Your voice is that producers can.

138
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,610
I can,
we can talk.

139
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,310
We're going to ask them about a specific
replay,

140
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,570
like,
show me that again.

141
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:58,571
Can you show me that for an overhead?
I want to see where that landed or 

142
00:06:58,571 --> 00:06:59,630
things along those lines.
But um,

143
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,540
and uh,
sometimes I mark della Grotta and I will

144
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,480
have conversations like I'll ask him 
like,

145
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:10,481
is this a good thing?
I'm a good piece of advice that 

146
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:10,481
someone's given.
Do you agree?

147
00:07:10,481 --> 00:07:11,810
Do you agree with that?
And he and I will have discussions about

148
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,540
whether we agree with certain tactics.
Sure.

149
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:19,750
Which is an interesting discussion 
because mark is like a real world class 

150
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,390
trainer knows a lot about Moitai 
specifically and a lot about mma.

151
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,480
Did they ever feed you something where 
you like,

152
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:28,580
it totally blows your mind like,
Oh shit,

153
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,260
I didn't realize that's what happened.

154
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,320
And sometimes God damn it,
we have sometimes you'll see something 

155
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,910
like they'll see something on a replay.
Maybe someone catches it like a,

156
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:41,620
a break,
an ankle or a weird role of an,

157
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,230
of a knee or something like that.
Yes,

158
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,630
I do watch this,
look at it.

159
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,100
We'll get to that.
And then you go,

160
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:47,030
oh,
she'll show it to me.

161
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,290
Yeah.
And I go,

162
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:50,390
Oh yeah.
So we'll have like conversation,

163
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:50,750
like,
Oh yeah,

164
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:53,180
we need to show that.
And then we'll replace something.

165
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,970
Wow.
I was thinking until I was watching it,

166
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,020
I was just looking on instagram that you
were in Toronto and you did a show and 

167
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:08,291
then you did the fights the next day.
And I was thinking as like watching you 

168
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:08,291
do the call,
the fights.

169
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:08,690
I was like,
man,

170
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:13,691
there's no other broadcaster in the 
major sports were like the night before 

171
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:17,570
he had as good a time as you did.

172
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,130
Like there's no way Al Michaels and 
Chris Collingsworth or like tonight 

173
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:28,481
we're going to fucking party with like 
fans and then tomorrow we'll call the 

174
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:31,790
cowboys and the giants like that never 
happens for sure.

175
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:37,070
Yeah.
You get to like really have the best 

176
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,080
trips that are work trips.
When you think about it,

177
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,860
you know.
Oh yeah,

178
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:41,870
they're so fun.
It's fucking nuts.

179
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,500
But even when I don't do a show,
you still love the fight.

180
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:46,910
UFC is awesome.
Of course.

181
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,120
Live watching live fights man.
Especially now that I'm loosened up my 

182
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:54,050
schedule so I to go,
um,

183
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,130
I go like half as much.

184
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,220
And it's only North America.
Yeah.

185
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,440
No,
none of those big crazy trips.

186
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:02,190
It just take too long.
They break you down,

187
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,020
it takes too many days to recover from 
them.

188
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,120
It's killer,
it kills you.

189
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,520
Um,
but on top of that it's a,

190
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,630
it's like that's the right amount for me
to just still be super enthusiastic 

191
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:15,750
about it and there's nothing like it.
I mean,

192
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:20,220
I'll tell you,
I didn't become a hardcore mma guy,

193
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,850
but now I watch it casually and enjoy 
it,

194
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:26,550
but the whole reason is that I went to 
it live.

195
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,270
Going to alive changes your perspective 
completely.

196
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,120
There's nothing like it.
Yeah.

197
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,800
I've only been to a few other sports 
live.

198
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,940
We've been to baseball games,
basketball games.

199
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Been to a hockey game.
Basketball lives will change your 

200
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:42,960
perspective.
Yeah.

201
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,120
Just how enormous they are,
how athletic and how fast and the shit 

202
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,120
is.

203
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,900
Yeah.
It's incredible when you see the 

204
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:50,900
footwork and the movement when they like
doing some sort of a crazy layup.

205
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,900
Yeah.
It's like God damn,

206
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,900
it's super athleticism while people are 
trying to stop you from doing it.

207
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:57,840
People in not that much space.
When you're at basketball live,

208
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:00,110
you're like,
that's not that much room on.

209
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,800
Especially on on a half court,
you know,

210
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,860
it takes this laser beam focused to be 
able to stop and put that ball exactly 

211
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,870
what you want,
skill to the way that they pass.

212
00:10:09,871 --> 00:10:10,470
Actually,
you know,

213
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,680
Lebron's like on top of being this super
athlete and everything,

214
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:18,681
his passing skills are absurd.
You could look at a passing real time 

215
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:18,690
and you're like,
how did he even.

216
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,310
I think even people that play 
basketball,

217
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:26,390
how did you even do that?
Because he'll go in a direction and 

218
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,050
anticipate that someone's going to be 
somewhere else within seconds and then 

219
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,530
we'll behind like behind his head pass 
it and it's you,

220
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,600
you just can't put it together.

221
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,600
You're like,
do you think these are the things they 

222
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:41,600
work on?
They must,

223
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:41,600
it must work.
I think so.

224
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,210
I think they work on it,
but I think at,

225
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,910
at their level and players like at his 
level,

226
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,880
it's just second nature.
It's not so much improvisation.

227
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,640
Absolutely.
Yeah.

228
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,020
It's kind of a creative game and a lot 
of ways.

229
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,740
Dude,
it's.

230
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:54,000
Yeah,
it's really,

231
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,550
it's really fucking amazing to watch 
high level,

232
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,750
high level anything.
I mean,

233
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:02,751
I don't like soccer that much,
but I will watch like I don't watch it 

234
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:04,310
regularly,
but when World Cup comes on I'll,

235
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,870
I'll turn into like a,
a mini fanatic.

236
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,090
You got to watch it with Ian Edwards.
Oh,

237
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:11,490
he's a fucking really hardcore.
He's hardcore.

238
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,560
He has his own podcast about just about 
it.

239
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,180
Yeah.
Him and some other dude.

240
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,190
Who's the other dude that he does it 
with?

241
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:18,290
You know,
Jason Glaring,

242
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,510
right?

243
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,590
Is it gluten?
Oh,

244
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,660
gluten and him did it.
Did it at one point.

245
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:23,460
I know for sure.
That's funny.

246
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,250
Funny Guy.
He's a fucking hilarious comedian.

247
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:28,680
Really Funny Guy.
Yeah.

248
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,980
We're talking about um,
um,

249
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,400
I was kind of,
I was going to bring something out so I 

250
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,400
probably can't talk about this yet.
Oh yeah,

251
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,450
yeah.
We're just gonna Bring,

252
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,460
so say something nice,
but I don't think we can talk about it 

253
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,040
yet.
But I'm Martin Harris.

254
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,320
That's what he does it with.
So maybe does somewhat glaring.

255
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,870
It's glaring.
Glaring is a big soccer player.

256
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,060
Take big soccer guy.
Yeah.

257
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,520
Yeah.
High level ever watched like that.

258
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,440
What's that little dudes name?
Messy.

259
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,340
Messy.
Yeah.

260
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,020
No.
Yeah,

261
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,000
yeah,
there is.

262
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,410
You got a cutup Jamie's wizard.
We get to,

263
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:02,680
he,
he,

264
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,230
he might.
Me and this dude,

265
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,420
this dude's like 24 or 26,
you know?

266
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,260
Yeah.
And he's um,

267
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:15,220
this just technical wizard wizard now.
He's amazing.

268
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:16,500
I've watched these highlights,
man.

269
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,840
I've,
I've watched a bunch of his because it's

270
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:23,080
fascinating just to watch somebody that 
good at anything,

271
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,140
you know,
if you told me like I just tweeted out 

272
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:28,140
this thing today about it dark player 
and they're like,

273
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,560
this is one of the baddest motherfuckers
in darts.

274
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,540
I'll watch that.
Do throw darts for hours.

275
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,870
Look at this,
look at this dude,

276
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,490
this guy's a wizard.
Look at this.

277
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,050
Just embarrassing.
Just wizardry.

278
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,820
Yeah,
that guy,

279
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,840
he moves like a wizard.
It's like what he's able to do with that

280
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:51,030
ball,
it's just fucking astounding.

281
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:56,050
Yeah.
And that would be so much better than 

282
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,241
people to do something like that.
And then the thing I always think about 

283
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:02,870
remind myself as of is that he's so much
better than people who are really great 

284
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,040
at it.
Yeah,

285
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,050
yeah,
exactly.

286
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,620
He's not playing me out there,
you know,

287
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,600
like those are other professional.
Yeah.

288
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,640
And he's just like,
I'm gonna eat man.

289
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,000
You're not going to want to talk to your
wife or your mother after this game.

290
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,630
Well,
occasionally there's fights like that to

291
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,180
get the shit.
At least these guys,

292
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,120
they're getting humiliated,
but nobody's getting hurt.

293
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,860
Oh,
okay.

294
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,080
Wizardry.
That is just fucking straight up 

295
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,080
wizardry.
Yeah.

296
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,880
It's amazing.
Like his footwork.

297
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,930
It's just,
it's like he's doing a different thing 

298
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:35,930
than them.

299
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,080
If a did he get tripped over the 
referee?

300
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,000
So what happened there?
It looked like it directly.

301
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,990
So what happened to the referee?
Get in the way.

302
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,450
The referees get in the way.
That's annoying.

303
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,570
Dude.
In football in our football team was 

304
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:50,570
wearing stripes.
You,

305
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,700
there's some big time for collisions.
Uh Oh yeah.

306
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:58,701
My Gosh.
These nash over the Middle Shit where 

307
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:00,930
the guy's like and he's like 64.
My God turns and just.

308
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,740
Yeah.
You see the dies.

309
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,280
No,
no,

310
00:14:05,281 --> 00:14:08,760
but there's the same again,
be on some of them.

311
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,090
Some of them are horrific men and a 
regular person.

312
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,960
He didn't get hit by a football player.
Yeah,

313
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:18,961
there's,
there's only a couple rafts that stand 

314
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:19,170
out as really in shape in football.
A couple of that.

315
00:14:19,171 --> 00:14:22,740
Most of them just look like a healthier 
and more fit,

316
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,830
but normal bodied guy.
Then there's ad hoc gillies and there's 

317
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:28,860
another guy who are a little more 
jacked.

318
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,640
Little bit.
Yeah,

319
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,720
a little bit.
There's this dude who invented this 

320
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:34,720
thing called the iron neck.
His name's Mike Jolly.

321
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,920
Oh yeah.
I'm going to get this out of my throat.

322
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:40,160
Folks know this.
I know it is,

323
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,650
isn't as annoying to me that is to you.
But uh,

324
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:45,840
he came by to um,
it was hockey least.

325
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,970
C'Mon man.
He's 60 something.

326
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:47,850
Sorry.
Oh my God,

327
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:49,960
that guy's going to get killed.
He's going to get hit by something.

328
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:50,430
No,
but look,

329
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,300
he's in shape saying he's,
he's one of the lookout.

330
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,910
Like he's an older guy and he's 
definitely shaped.

331
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,940
Yeah.
But even though if you're an older guy 

332
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,100
and in shape,
you're getting hit by an NFL player.

333
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Point is this guy came over here to 
demonstrate Jesus Christ.

334
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,350
He came over to demonstrate this thing.
He's a fucking giant.

335
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,170
Huge.
He just thinking like if this guy,

336
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,110
this guy played football,
I played football and he played football

337
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:19,190
and we ran into each other.

338
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,870
Yeah,
that would be terrible for me.

339
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

340
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,290
Like there's a different kind of person 
out there,

341
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,640
these,
these like,

342
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,760
unless you've been around like a pro nfl
player,

343
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,430
you see them walk through a crowd of 
people and you go,

344
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,770
Oh man,
I just met Jj Watt.

345
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,180
I just met him like a month ago and I 
was like,

346
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,740
like,
people call me like big fella that I 

347
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:41,740
meet,
you know,

348
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,890
guy big fella.
Amen.

349
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,070
I know you're a big guy,
you know the,

350
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,280
all that stuff in your head.
You're like,

351
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:51,281
I guess I am a big guy.
And then you meet that dude and like I 

352
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:53,600
was,
I looked like a child next to them.

353
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,860
You know,
like I looked like a,

354
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,950
an actual,
like a little boy meeting a superman or 

355
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:00,140
something.
There's a giant human being.

356
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,760
He's a giant,
giant,

357
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,410
enormous man.
They make people.

358
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:08,411
We watched a,
or we looked at this website that held 

359
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:12,311
up all the various heights and weights 
of like nfl players from 20,

360
00:16:13,101 --> 00:16:14,450
30 years ago in Paris.

361
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,280
In today.
It's like night and day.

362
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:17,130
It's amazing.
Yeah.

363
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,820
When I was a kid I remember lineman 
like,

364
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,640
which is the biggest players in 
football.

365
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,140
We're like two 75 was the standard way 
and when people would say that you go,

366
00:16:27,141 --> 00:16:29,930
that's a fucking humongous got.
I mean I'm like eight,

367
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:34,931
nine years old,
you go to 75 and that was the thing and 

368
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:38,351
it was a big deal.
If a guy weighed 300 pounds and if 

369
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:42,401
you're over 300,
you were an anomaly like human 

370
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:42,401
refrigerator.
The fridge.

371
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,250
Right?
So that was the thing.

372
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:48,251
It was like,
he was like the biggest human in the 

373
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:51,011
NFL.
They call them the fridge and he was 

374
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:51,230
like fatter and everything,
but they couldn't believe,

375
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,340
you know,
it was a thing to be like,

376
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:57,341
this guy is over 300 pounds.
Now if you weighed 300 and you were 

377
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:59,180
playing on the line,
you'd be underweight.

378
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,310
You'd be one of the light guys because 
there's guys that are 3:30,

379
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:09,670
3:40
playing that position and athletic guys 

380
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,870
too,
while to really huge man.

381
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:12,800
Really,
really?

382
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:15,800
How much bigger can they get?
Like what's maximum size?

383
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,430
I thought about there was this guy who 
played,

384
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:21,860
but he wasn't really great,
but he was six,

385
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,310
eight,
406.

386
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,930
Eight,
400 pounds.

387
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,280
Yeah.
That's a human being.

388
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,820
Exactly like imagine if like everybody 
was six,

389
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:32,720
eight,
400 pounds.

390
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:35,930
The world would be a different place.
It's a different thing.

391
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,170
That's a different kind of human being.
Six,

392
00:17:38,171 --> 00:17:40,970
five to 89,
but this guy's really fast.

393
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,360
Really athletic box jump.
What the fuck are you talking about?

394
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,890
Click.
It would just look what that just says.

395
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:50,040
It says he made a

396
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,040
61 inch box jump.
That is insane for the average person to

397
00:17:57,481 --> 00:17:59,390
understand how insane that is.
Like how do.

398
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:04,430
How do you describe how insane it is to 
watch a almost 300 pound man?

399
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,360
Yeah.
Launched himself literally five feet 

400
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:10,360
into the air.
Here we go.

401
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,210
Look at this.
That is fucking insane.

402
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,750
That is insane.
Like the size of this perk I stood in 

403
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:21,660
the middle of his wife says,
oh my God.

404
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:26,661
It's insane.
Wow.

405
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:28,390
I mean,
he,

406
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,350
he's,
he fucking launched himself in the air.

407
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,960
Big Fuck Man.
That's so hard to do.

408
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,180
Yeah.
Like what?

409
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:41,181
He just did like one stand of like super
athletes could probably do it.

410
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:43,650
Right.
How many people could do that?

411
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,000
Jamie?
You're a big.

412
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,290
I'm one of very few in.
There's a couple of guys that,

413
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,420
I don't know.
It's not five feet,

414
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,000
but like easily three to three and a 
half feet to jump out of the pool.

415
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,180
Oh,
I've seen that with weights in their 

416
00:18:59,180 --> 00:18:59,180
hands to Bj Penn can do that.
So it can.

417
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,350
Chad Mendez really crazy.
Yeah.

418
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:06,351
This is a.
But those guys or smaller guys is 

419
00:19:06,351 --> 00:19:06,351
humongous guy.
Dude.

420
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,300
Bj,
uh,

421
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,620
he's fought his heavy as heavyweight.
Really?

422
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,600
Yeah.
Bj fogg.

423
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,250
He fought heavyweights.
Yeah.

424
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,300
Yeah,
he did.

425
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,130
Yeah.
He was say like five nine.

426
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,210
What's that?
Five.

427
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:19,050
Nine.
Is that right?

428
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,900
Yeah,
somewhere around there.

429
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah.
He fought Leo Machida.

430
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,360
He felt the a Cheeto and look,
Leo Machida was a,

431
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,610
you know,
clearly 200 plus pounds in the Machida 

432
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:37,190
had knocked out rich Franklin to what's,
what's Bj's like walk around weight now.

433
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:40,740
He's pretty light because he's fighting 
at 1:45.

434
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,950
But if he was five and will he be like a
one 61 70 guy?

435
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,390
Yeah.
If you got up.

436
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:46,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

437
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:48,960
If he got.
If he wasn't doing a lot of cardio,

438
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,350
I bet he probably walks around like one 
60 or something like that.

439
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,900
But he won the 1:55
and he won the won 70.

440
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:57,510
What happened in that heavyweight fight?
He Won.

441
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:58,770
He Won.
Yeah.

442
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:01,290
I'm pretty sure.
I think he wanted to.

443
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,850
Leo Machida.
I think he.

444
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,510
No,
no,

445
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:05,880
he lost Leo.
Machida he lost a decision.

446
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,870
See if that's true.
I believe that's true.

447
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,630
I think he lost a decision.
Does it say that anywhere?

448
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,960
I know he fought.
He left the UFC,

449
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,770
fought a couple fights at other 
organizations.

450
00:20:18,771 --> 00:20:22,790
He fought Bang Ludwick in Japan.
And uh,

451
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,220
and he had a fight with Leo.
Machida.

452
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,040
You got it.
Your own cheer.

453
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,500
Me.
Yeah.

454
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,170
That's it.
Look,

455
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,570
the mosquitoes,
he was big back then.

456
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,330
Liotta wanted a decision.
Yeah,

457
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,400
crazy.
The Oda goes on to be the UFC light 

458
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,591
heavyweight champion and Bj's now 
fighting as a featherweight was 

459
00:20:45,591 --> 00:20:46,470
incredible.
I mean,

460
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,010
that's a really nutty thing that

461
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,450
fighters do when you try to win and 
compete at different weight classes.

462
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,100
Pj just didn't give a fuck.
He was so confident.

463
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,650
Particularly early in his career.
Yeah.

464
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:05,370
I was.
One of the things about him when he 

465
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,841
would fight,
he just had this intense belief in 

466
00:21:06,841 --> 00:21:08,140
himself and he would be super,
super aggressive too,

467
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,200
like you knocked out this dude count,
you know,

468
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,280
and like six seconds and count.
Who knows?

469
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:14,010
A really good fighter.
You.

470
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,760
Uno is very experienced.
He's fun.

471
00:21:16,761 --> 00:21:21,761
A lot of like real world class guys in 
Japan and he was a real respected 

472
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:24,910
grappler and it was interesting matchup 
because of Bj scrapping pedigree like Bj

473
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:29,911
was on the Monday aisles and count Luna 
was thought to be like a really good 

474
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:29,911
grappler,
real,

475
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:31,610
real solid wrestler and submission guy 
and.

476
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:34,540
But pj just storm data just stormed out.
Um,

477
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,620
and just starched them.

478
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,160
Yeah.
It was crazy.

479
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,300
Believes that he's gonna knock you out.
He was just so good.

480
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,450
People who didn't get to see him live 
and he was in his prime.

481
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,510
Bj was so good.
He was so good.

482
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:51,930
Like when he beat Diego Sanchez,
I remember thinking damn like that was 

483
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,850
what I think what you call it peak Bj.
Bj was like,

484
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:58,600
he beat Sean Sherk who destroyed Sean 
Sherk who was a really tough fighter.

485
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,190
Like people forget how good Sean Sean 
Sherk was up like a human pit bull.

486
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,610
This dude was just jacked,
super strong wrestler.

487
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,080
Just super,
super good.

488
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:09,700
So Vj,
go into it with a,

489
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,670
like a trained background or just like a
scrappy fighter,

490
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,990
you know,
he was very trained,

491
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,250
you know,
he's very technical,

492
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,450
especially on the ground.
He's,

493
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:18,660
he's really high level and it's 
Brazilian Jujitsu.

494
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:23,700
Super Technical.
And he stopped because he was like that 

495
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:23,700
when he came in to fight it.

496
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:23,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

497
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,820
I don't know like where,
when is,

498
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:29,850
when he started his striking out,
but I know he got his black belt in 

499
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,390
Jujitsu in three years,
which is just bananas fast.

500
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,420
Like one 10th of one percent fast.
Really?

501
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,100
Yeah.
Oh Wow.

502
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,970
I mean for most people,
like you getting a black belt in Jujitsu

503
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:44,971
is like,
like if you're a real [inaudible] you 

504
00:22:44,971 --> 00:22:46,690
can get it into like seven years as a 
phenom.

505
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Yeah.
There's a few guys that'll get it 

506
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:51,720
earlier.
You know,

507
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,990
like if you have some particular talent 
physically,

508
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,040
which seems like a lot of people equate 
martial arts,

509
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,740
rightly so with technique is the most 
important thing.

510
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:00,550
It absolutely.
Yes.

511
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,610
But another thing that is almost as 
important as technique is physical 

512
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:05,860
dexterity of your body.
Yeah.

513
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,780
What you can do and what you can't do 
with your body.

514
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Some people are super flexible,
like pj PJ's ridiculously flexible and 

515
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,870
Bj would rap guys up with his legs.
His legs are like weapons.

516
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,900
They're like arms really.
He chokes you with his arms and he's 

517
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:21,900
choking you with his legs?
Yeah.

518
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,140
Wow.
He's,

519
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,200
he has incredible dexterity and 
flexibility with his legs and that's 

520
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,261
always made bj particularly dangerous on
the ground and it's just smart about 

521
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:36,241
fighting.
It just is very good at understanding 

522
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:36,550
when to push things,
when not to where,

523
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,750
where he's,
you know,

524
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,620
he just,
you know,

525
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,560
just like with everybody,
you only fight a lot of tough fighters.

526
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:46,140
You're going to have some losses,
you know?

527
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,960
That's,
that's essentially what happened to Bj.

528
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,130
That's fucking rough businessman.
It is a rough business.

529
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,690
God,
Vj still fighting.

530
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,390
Now he's going to fight this kid named 
[inaudible] Rodriguez,

531
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,420
who is.
Hey,

532
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,200
have you ever seen that guy?
How long has bj been fighting for?

533
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,460
I gotta say Shit.
He must've started his career in the 

534
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,910
early two thousands.
Oh my God.

535
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,950
Yeah.
It's a long time.

536
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,480
Yeah,
a long time to fight.

537
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,260
Well,
he was,

538
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,640
you know.
Yeah.

539
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:24,641
I would like to.
I would like to guess he probably 

540
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:25,180
started fighting somewhere around,
well,

541
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:30,190
let's find out more.
Go 15 years of scrapping.

542
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,320
Wow.
That's a lot.

543
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
So that.
Yeah,

544
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,660
it's just when you,
when you see it live,

545
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:43,661
you understand like really firsthand 
what the actual real consequences of 

546
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:49,850
these exchanges are.
Live for me was just also the,

547
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,680
the excitement around it.
There's,

548
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,920
I mean,
it's an arena with people so jacked up 

549
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,320
for a fight and you know,
like I think you've said like nothing in

550
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:03,080
and of itself is as exciting as a fight,
you know,

551
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:05,570
like a fight,
a fight in any moment is exciting,

552
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,900
but when you have a,
uh,

553
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,940
an arena full cheering with excitement 
to add to that,

554
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,620
there's something that you can't 
duplicate.

555
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,310
You know,
on an energy level it breaks.

556
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,930
The consequences are so high.
The consequences are high,

557
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:19,670
but there's like,
there's an energy in the room,

558
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:21,440
have somebody walking up and you hearing
that,

559
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:27,050
like,
that raises the hair on your neck and 

560
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:27,050
you're like,
oh God.

561
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,510
And then with everything that lands that
cheering,

562
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,220
whoa man,
it's just,

563
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,750
it's,
you can't,

564
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,310
you can't mimic that,
you know,

565
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,330
neon.
Yeah,

566
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:35,960
it's,
it's,

567
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:42,160
you know,
I hate the phrase because we set it for 

568
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,160
so long and it's as real as it gets.
Yeah.

569
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,880
But it is just.
Yeah.

570
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,760
So you know what,
what is it about a phrase when you say a

571
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:48,380
phrase too long,
they just stop.

572
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,100
Meaning anything.
People start to miss phrases,

573
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,910
work beats talent.
When talent refused to work,

574
00:25:55,911 --> 00:25:57,470
hard to write,
but I know that's true,

575
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:58,910
but I fucking hate it when people say 
it.

576
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

577
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:01,580
Don't say it.
Say it too much anymore.

578
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,980
They hate it.
I start.

579
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,040
One's done.
Right?

580
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,990
It's a fucking terrible.
Yeah,

581
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,990
but there's certain ones like as real as
it gets done.

582
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:09,700
Yeah.
I mean,

583
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,270
this guy,
he used to say it anymore.

584
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:17,000
Say you gotta you gotta stop and smell 
the roses sometimes to talk about life.

585
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,310
Then I really,
he just started antidepressants,

586
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,090
so I was like,
Ugh,

587
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,250
this is just like the medicine talking 
because he was just always like,

588
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,430
you know,
and then you stop and smell the roses.

589
00:26:25,431 --> 00:26:27,200
I'm going again.
I know you said it three times already.

590
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,610
Hey,
let me ask you this,

591
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:30,470
do it because you're in the middle of 
this wild.

592
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,320
It looks at my horses back.
You're in the middle of this wild,

593
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:38,380
crazy bet with Bert Kreischer to see who
can lose the most weight by January,

594
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,090
first,
second and third.

595
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,410
Right.
You're going to weigh in three days in a

596
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:43,230
row.
I'm going to emcee it.

597
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,420
Fuck yeah.
We're doing at the forum.

598
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:47,540
You know that right?
Fuck.

599
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,950
What are you going to do it?
What's the forum?

600
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,270
The forum is a,
is uh,

601
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,890
the Great Western Forum.
Yeah.

602
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,440
Yeah.
That's where the wind is going to be.

603
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:55,860
And that's what I was told.
I don't know.

604
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:56,460
Really.
Yeah.

605
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,930
Jesus.
Actually,

606
00:26:57,931 --> 00:27:02,931
I think we'll do it.
Can we do it here so we can weigh in 

607
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:03,120
here,
live on the air.

608
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:09,330
We could do that.
But if you want to do it live in front 

609
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:09,330
of a crowd,
we can do it anywhere.

610
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:09,330
I don't.
Did you want it?

611
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:10,830
You really guys really want to do it 
live.

612
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,680
And that's a joke.
I was like,

613
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:14,850
man,
you probably could do it.

614
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,900
Yeah.
Um,

615
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,440
we,
uh,

616
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,190
we get a couple thousand people in the 
forum.

617
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:24,190
So you guys,
and you're unaware of if I'll do it.

618
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,800
If we can get a couple of those ring 
girls,

619
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,400
but that look way different than those 
really big ones.

620
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,380
Real heavy,
real heavy ring girls,

621
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:39,090
then I'll do it.
That's what it's fat shaming though.

622
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:44,500
You can't.
If you start using heavy risk thing is 

623
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:44,500
fat.
It doesn't matter.

624
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:44,500
You're a guy.
That's true.

625
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:44,500
You can take it.
Yeah,

626
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,270
you can take you guys.
You'd never accused of fat shaming.

627
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,720
This is so crazy.
That term is.

628
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,160
I'm Ronda Rousey who's of course,
you know,

629
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,680
former UFC bantamweight champion.
Yes.

630
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,020
All time.
Great mixed martial artists.

631
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,680
She has this girl,
Julianna Pena that is in her weight 

632
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:12,180
division and they.
They talk shit to each other or at least

633
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:17,181
Juliana has been talking shit about 
Ronda Rousey and Ronda Rousey,

634
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,540
which you was saying was that Ronda 
Rousey has large arms.

635
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,860
She said she was fat arms.

636
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,590
Really.
It was one of the things you're saying,

637
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,830
but just so innocuous.
Then people were saying that she was fat

638
00:28:28,831 --> 00:28:32,370
shaming or you are you really?
Seriously.

639
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:35,610
First of all,
protecting Ronda fucking Rousey.

640
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,580
I think it's really more about that.
The lady that said it,

641
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,930
that's to her such a horrible thing to 
say,

642
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,980
you know they're going to fight is my 
point here,

643
00:28:45,981 --> 00:28:47,250
but she eventually made.
He's like,

644
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:52,251
I might lose that fight.
I don't have fat ass arms like you do 

645
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:53,710
and that to her,
she always had these awesome arms.

646
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:54,900
I think.
Yeah,

647
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,240
because I mean somebody to go after 
that,

648
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:02,300
like that's for her a big deal,
you know those,

649
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,770
but yeah.
Rhonda doesn't need any,

650
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:08,820
any defense.
Rhonda is really thin,

651
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:11,460
like she's really thin now she's chance.
Amazing.

652
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:13,350
Of course,
but I mean she's got muscles,

653
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:14,580
man.
You know what I mean?

654
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:17,550
She's got some big ass shoulder muscles 
and big arm muscles.

655
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:22,680
This is a reason that not all fat things
are launching chicks through the air.

656
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,330
Yeah.
She's,

657
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,670
she's,
she's got plenty of.

658
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:29,780
But my point was they were proposing to 
fight in a fucking cage and somehow or 

659
00:29:30,491 --> 00:29:35,491
another it's just unbelievable outrage 
because she made fun of her arms being 

660
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:35,491
fat.
I know,

661
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:38,040
right.
We're going to read each other nearly to

662
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:41,940
death about fat

663
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,180
ass.
Yeah,

664
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,240
I mean is that really like,
can you can insult people about their 

665
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,770
personality and the fact that there is 
really what it is to.

666
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,110
First of all,
I encourage fat shaming.

667
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,050
I think it's helpful to you for real.
I really do.

668
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,520
I think it's.
I think it's absolutely helpful.

669
00:29:57,521 --> 00:29:59,620
Why do you think it's helpful?
Because it depends on your psyche,

670
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:00,340
I guess.
You know,

671
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:05,341
how you respond to it,
but I think it's just like somebody 

672
00:30:05,341 --> 00:30:08,311
calling you out on your bullshit.
It's just a version of that is a 

673
00:30:08,311 --> 00:30:10,000
physical version of that and a lot of 
people you can be in denial,

674
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:15,001
you know,
I think a lot of people are in denial 

675
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:15,001
about a lot of things.
Well,

676
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:15,001
a lot of people just want to live their 
lives to,

677
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:16,240
to take cheap,
to play devil's advocate,

678
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:21,241
right?
A lot of people just want to live their 

679
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:21,241
lives and they don't mind being heavy.

680
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:22,180
They don't like it when people are 
talking shit about something.

681
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,740
That's the choice,
you know?

682
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:28,741
I mean,
I'm not saying that that person doesn't 

683
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:28,741
have a right to feel that way.
Right?

684
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:30,150
But it's what I think some people have a
problem with it is that these,

685
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:35,190
these,
there's certain people that didn't do 

686
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:35,190
anything wrong.
They didn't do anything to you.

687
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,430
Everything they've done,
they've done to themselves.

688
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,200
Yeah.
But if you shitting on them,

689
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,870
it's kind of a,
it's an easy.

690
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,210
It's an easy thing to do.
It is an easy thing to do.

691
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,590
And uh,
you know,

692
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,390
if you weren't so fat,
nobody would talk about it.

693
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,840
So I mean,
I look,

694
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,310
I've been called fat at so many 
different points.

695
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:53,950
I've been up and down my whole life,
so I feel,

696
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:58,980
I think because of that and when you get
older you have more acceptance with like

697
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,440
not having a problem with somebody 
saying it.

698
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,460
People that I get,
I'm a public figure in a lot of ways,

699
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:08,140
right.
So I'm used to people being like,

700
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:09,550
fuck you,
and go fuck yourself.

701
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:11,650
I hate your act.
You're like,

702
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,250
oh,
okay.

703
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,710
It's another version of that.
Yeah.

704
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,270
Like you're fat.
Yeah.

705
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:18,400
And you're like,
it's a cue if you ain't feeling.

706
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,610
It's the same feeling as I'm saying 
like,

707
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,380
I've gotten so much for that has nothing
to do with that.

708
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,240
If somebody throws in fat and you're 
like,

709
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:25,750
yeah,
okay,

710
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,120
you know,
so weird.

711
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,190
I saw your special.
I fucking hated it.

712
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:30,820
Like,
okay,

713
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,790
susie.
Disappointed Bro.

714
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,050
Seriously,
you just appoint me disappointment.

715
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,760
Well,
all right.

716
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,530
Why?
Why did you disappoint this fight?

717
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:43,480
I mean,
it was,

718
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:44,860
you know,
I was just like,

719
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:49,861
I'm not going to engage you.
So it's bizarre when people do engage 

720
00:31:49,861 --> 00:31:49,861
people.
This,

721
00:31:49,861 --> 00:31:51,160
we were talking about this before the 
podcast.

722
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,420
Philly,
Philly d,

723
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,940
You know,
I'm from the Internet,

724
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,060
from a youtube.
Very nice guy.

725
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:03,540
Philip to Franco.
We've had them on the podcast for Super 

726
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:03,540
Nice Guy.
Um,

727
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,330
he was going out with some chick.
He,

728
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,910
he tweeted something today.
What did it,

729
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,920
what was his original tweet?
Was it about Kanye or something like 

730
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,840
that?
It's about visiting trump.

731
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,780
And he tweeted like,
trump would tweet.

732
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,310
Oh,
that's right.

733
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,510
He tweeted,
can't wait to see trump.

734
00:32:22,511 --> 00:32:25,360
Tweet after this.
Met with Kanye West.

735
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:28,120
Tremendous American artists.
Shame Jay won't call him.

736
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,920
Pick up the phone.
Sad,

737
00:32:29,921 --> 00:32:32,410
exclamation point because it's really 
fucking funny.

738
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
That's really funny.
And uh,

739
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:39,810
some woman got really mad and liquid.
She wrote Mine Yo Damn White and stay

740
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,040
out of black people's beef.
You not a part of black twitter.

741
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:44,780
Stop stealing.
They're tweeting style.

742
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:49,400
And then I went to her page and I think 
she's a troll.

743
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,340
I think she's,
I think she's trolling.

744
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,740
We don't have to give out her name or 
anything like that.

745
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,150
Please don't get anybody excited.
Maybe she's real.

746
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:06,050
But maybe it's just felt like shitting 
on them too.

747
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,080
Who knows?
Maybe she just felt like tighten it and 

748
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,780
didn't think he was going to respond.
But he responded in a video.

749
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,760
Oh,
he did love his videos.

750
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:15,320
He responded and talked about and I was 
like,

751
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:15,570
wow.

752
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,830
Weird.
Huh?

753
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,100
I love when people say like,
you're,

754
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,830
you're not to comment on this top on 
this story,

755
00:33:22,831 --> 00:33:25,560
right?
Like why not the best is that if you,

756
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,910
if you make any comment or joke about 
anything political,

757
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:34,170
somebody who disagrees with that 
political position will go,

758
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,560
we don't really need a comedian a 
commenting on this.

759
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:38,130
And you're like,
oh,

760
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,300
okay.
What do you do?

761
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:44,910
Or are you the,
you're the person qualified to talk 

762
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:44,910
about it.
Yeah.

763
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:44,910
How does that work?
Yeah.

764
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,850
So you work at the store,
the factory,

765
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,470
and you're allowed to comment on,

766
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:54,630
oh,
is that something that you would ever 

767
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:54,630
say to anybody?
You're not allowed to comment on it.

768
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:54,630
Of course not.
That's so crazy.

769
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,040
Yeah,
I know.

770
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,530
It's,
it's absolutely hate these fucking white

771
00:33:57,531 --> 00:34:01,450
people adding their two cents to Kanye 
and Jay z saga.

772
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:04,070
Trying to get our t shut your God damn 
mouth.

773
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:08,700
Always butting in.
She got us to talk about her job.

774
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,780
I mean this is the new world we're 
living in.

775
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,930
Man Says you're not allowed to comment 
on that because it's black beat.

776
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,860
She's saying,
well,

777
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,620
anybody telling you not allowed to 
comment on anything.

778
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:19,410
It's crazy.
Yeah.

779
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,650
So yeah.
Let me tell you something.

780
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,900
I have talked to people.
They have.

781
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:28,901
I have had the conversations with people
who think they're Kung Fu master could 

782
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:32,890
fight in the UFC,
but everybody's scared of someone dying.

783
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:35,810
If someone understands real cheap,
real cheap master.

784
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:37,340
I've had these kinds of conversations 
with people.

785
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,740
How much do people believe that Kung Fu 
a lot of people still do?

786
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,760
Where do you think it would fall on the 
scale of the martial arts?

787
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:50,120
Ability to win major fights with highly 
trained people in either like where 

788
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,700
would Kung Fu fall?

789
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:55,750
Well,
the problem with martial arts with 

790
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,080
individual martial arts,
I ketos obviously at the top.

791
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:01,140
Yes,
but the problem is the problem with 

792
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,091
individual martial arts like that is 
that they're no longer unaware of the 

793
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,290
tactics and abilities of other martial 
arts,

794
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:10,300
so it used to be that if you were like a
taekwondo guy like I was,

795
00:35:10,301 --> 00:35:14,350
you would have a delusional sense of how
good you would do in a fight with a judo

796
00:35:14,351 --> 00:35:16,250
person because you don't because you've 
never,

797
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:21,430
never.
Nobody grabbed me before and through 

798
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:21,430
your round to really have no idea how 
easy it would be for them to do it.

799
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:24,350
You have a distorted idea in your head.
Now everybody knows this guy.

800
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,880
Yeah.
Now everybody know.

801
00:35:25,881 --> 00:35:28,960
So now it's real hard to say like a Kung
Fu guy.

802
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:33,961
Like if a Kung Fu guy fought a judo guy 
who would win because there's no real 

803
00:35:33,961 --> 00:35:36,190
only Kung Fu guys anymore and there's no
real.

804
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,920
Only judo they'd have.
They all know about mma.

805
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:44,010
Yeah.
Everybody knows if you're a martial 

806
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:44,010
artists,
especially your,

807
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,821
you know,
you get your black belt level or 

808
00:35:46,821 --> 00:35:46,821
something like that.
You're aware of other shit now,

809
00:35:46,821 --> 00:35:48,330
so you,
you know what things,

810
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,470
you know what,
what's more effective now?

811
00:35:50,471 --> 00:35:52,890
Like there's a better understanding of 
it than anyone's ever had before.

812
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:57,891
So if you're like a high level martial 
artists even arrest or something like 

813
00:35:57,891 --> 00:35:58,170
that,
I guarantee you they know.

814
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,470
Most of them know something else.
They know how to throw their hands.

815
00:36:01,471 --> 00:36:03,380
They know how to throw a kicker too,
you know,

816
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,770
and if they got to like a really good 
coach,

817
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:06,030
they could probably get pretty good at 
striking.

818
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:07,110
Pretty fucking quit.
Sure.

819
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,960
But striking is one of those weird 
things,

820
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:14,961
man.
It seems that it's really difficult to 

821
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:15,150
people for people to get really good at 
it.

822
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:19,170
If they don't have the right body for it
and they start late in life.

823
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,700
It's real weird.
Really.

824
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,420
Yay.
Yeah.

825
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,250
This,
you can get better at it,

826
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:28,490
but there's a certain amount of speed 
that you need to execute really set up 

827
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:33,591
in Knox and buddy.
There's a certain amount you can get by 

828
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,160
with a certain amount of speed against 
lesser competition.

829
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:40,161
You can get by even more so if you are 
more of a threat as a wrestler and you 

830
00:36:40,161 --> 00:36:41,490
can give by even more.
So if you're really smart,

831
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,250
you really understand when to engage,
when not to engage and you're threatened

832
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:48,060
with arrest and you can get away with 
like having a slower striking style,

833
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,990
but if you can't do those things then 
you're a fucking sitting duck and that's

834
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:56,991
one of the most terrifying aspects of 
them I met and the most terrifying 

835
00:36:56,991 --> 00:37:00,141
aspects of mma is being stuck in the 
middle of the cage with a guy like 

836
00:37:00,141 --> 00:37:00,750
Anderson Silva and his prime.

837
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,150
It was just sliding slightly out of the 
way.

838
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:08,100
Your Shit and crack and you in the face 
and he's dancing around and you know,

839
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,050
he's making the wobbly face.
Like he's,

840
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,730
he's rocked.
Yeah.

841
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,860
To fuck with you.
And then he's kicks you and punches you.

842
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,280
Yeah.
He's done some creepy shit to dudes 

843
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,280
inside the octagon.
I mean creepy in a way that's like not,

844
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,200
not negative.
I mean so good.

845
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,320
Like you said,
these moments in fights where you just 

846
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:27,320
go,
holy shit,

847
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:27,390
it's creepy.
I do.

848
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:29,490
You got.
You get stuck in a cage with that dude.

849
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,350
He would just,
he just basically,

850
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:34,320
if this was a thousand years ago,
it would be that he would be the king of

851
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:36,720
the village like this.
Most likely now.

852
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,970
Well the village will be the biggest 
guy.

853
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:44,350
See that.
What we're doing is we're separating 

854
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:44,350
people by size.
True.

855
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,660
At the end of the day,
like if you meet a guy like brock 

856
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:47,660
Lesnar,
you go,

857
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,540
oh,
that's why there's a heavyweight 

858
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:50,540
division.

859
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,460
Right?
But that's a totally different kinds of 

860
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:52,460
human.
How much,

861
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:52,790
how much?
How many guys like that can actually.

862
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:58,270
And I talking about brock specifically,
but that are like two 85 can move like 

863
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,070
him.
Well No,

864
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,910
they can keep a body like that without 
anything additional like.

865
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:07,911
In other words,
that's a super good question and it's 

866
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,690
not anonymous question.
The problem is people are real dishonest

867
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,580
about what they take in,
what they don't take.

868
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,540
You know,
it's weird because there's people that 

869
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,240
argue with you,
they'll say that there is only so big a 

870
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:20,790
person can ever get and be so fast 
without help.

871
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,470
Right?
But then he got to say,

872
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,220
but their understanding of recovery is 
way better today than ever before.

873
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,950
Like your understanding of like when the
train would not train,

874
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:30,330
when you're overtrained,
like if you,

875
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:33,270
if you're at a real high level place,
they're going to like if you're grooming

876
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:35,040
you to be an nfl player or something 
like that,

877
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,100
they're going to give you some

878
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,310
Pretty High Level Instruction and 
coaching.

879
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:42,220
And if you're eating right,
you're going to have a definitely a jump

880
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,150
over people that were in your same sort 
of position 20 years ago.

881
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Right?
So the athletes are going to be better 

882
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,160
just because of the science of training.
Sure.

883
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,680
But after that you gotta wonder.
Yeah.

884
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,520
I mean it's not like they don't know 
about them.

885
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,430
Now of course they all know about 
steroids.

886
00:38:57,431 --> 00:39:00,310
So easy to get.
It's not like they don't know about them

887
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,720
and they not like they don't know.
They help.

888
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:06,780
And these dudes,
like some of the guys are definitely 

889
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:06,780
fat,
right?

890
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,770
But some guys are like,
they're so like,

891
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:13,771
you're like,
you're walking around at like a healthy 

892
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:13,771
three,
10.

893
00:39:13,771 --> 00:39:18,270
Well,
I think some of them honestly are 

894
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:18,270
probably a bit big on purpose to like 
Lineman,

895
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,210
right?
You got to meet them.

896
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,580
Yeah.
You want to be a giant?

897
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,830
You want to be a giant monster shredded.
No,

898
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:25,150
no,
no.

899
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,850
You want to just went away a lot.
Matching into people.

900
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,810
I think the fuck do I know.
I know nothing about football.

901
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:34,150
You're totally right.
People say football players' names and I

902
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:36,340
have to not like a,
like a personal failing country.

903
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:37,600
Like um,
you know,

904
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:38,920
if someone's speaking to me in another 
language,

905
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:39,590
like uh,
yeah,

906
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,580
I don't know what you're saying.
Yeah.

907
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:45,370
I feel like sports so to like I got you.
Oh yeah man.

908
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,170
But you know,
bay I wear hats a lot.

909
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,660
Especially I travel that.
I used to like having a hat on her plane

910
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:55,010
pull over and I have like 10 different 
teams and guys were born and like you 

911
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:55,840
see Douglas last night and I'm like,
what?

912
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,390
And they're like the game and I realized
it's the hat and I'm like,

913
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,750
I missed it.
He was like,

914
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,970
fuck,
shout them out.

915
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,470
Like fucking killer man.

916
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,540
Yeah,
I have no.

917
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:11,440
Ideally talking about,
well now there's so many UFC fighters,

918
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:16,000
there's like 500 UFC fighters occasion.
Like I got to look people up.

919
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,890
Sure.
Someone will mention some of them,

920
00:40:17,891 --> 00:40:19,600
like who did he fight?
And they'll fight.

921
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:23,260
He fought that guy I'm like,
were like four fight nights ago.

922
00:40:23,261 --> 00:40:25,460
My undercard were one was on the ground.
Like,

923
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,720
yeah,
I'll have to like my super big.

924
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:33,490
Too many fights have massive.
Has it gotten just in the time that I've

925
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:37,330
known or been to UFC stuff,
you know,

926
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,880
the fight game has exploded in 
popularity.

927
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,570
It seems like,
um,

928
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:46,860
it all took off from this one fight in 
2005 between Stephan Bonner and forrest 

929
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,150
griffin.
That was like the big one because it was

930
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:51,700
the end of this,
the final of this first reality show,

931
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:53,800
the ultimate fighter.
It's crazy.

932
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:58,801
Fight in the finals and these guys knew 
each other real well and they actually 

933
00:40:58,801 --> 00:40:59,140
liked each other a lot,
but they fucking went,

934
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,040
had it.

935
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,070
They just both went at it.
It changed the game.

936
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,080
Both guys fought Anderson Silva to.
Oh Wow.

937
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,730
Later in their career,
they both,

938
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,050
they both got fucked up now was when 
they understand was just a jet.

939
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:17,290
I night he was just doing shit to people
inside the octagon where you're like,

940
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:19,480
oh Jesus.
How was that the um,

941
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,340
what was that?
That one fight with him.

942
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,170
Which one?
I think was it the Weidman One?

943
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,720
Oh,
he broke his leg or when the,

944
00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:28,630
uh,
when you get knocked out.

945
00:41:28,631 --> 00:41:30,460
I think when he got knocked out 
probably.

946
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,230
And you've been to a ton of,
into a bunch of them now.

947
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,910
That one was crazy because he was 
winning that fight.

948
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,010
If I didn't go to that one,
I definitely saw.

949
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,260
I've seen both those guys fight at 
fights,

950
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,750
so I can't remember if I saw that fight 
or not.

951
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:47,020
Weidman was pressing him,
but Anderson was kicking them a lot in 

952
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,020
the legs.

953
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,020
Yeah.
And I was looking at,

954
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,510
I was like,
Ooh,

955
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,220
like he's,
he's kicking his legs a lot.

956
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,190
I hear a lot of time,
like crazy taunting.

957
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,060
But you know what?
Weidman did something really slick.

958
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:59,450
He did something really slick.
It's really interesting.

959
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:05,050
He threw a back fist.
He threw a punch and then he threw a 

960
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:05,270
back fist because they understand what's
going on.

961
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,300
He was bobbing and weaving and bobbing 
and weaving,

962
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:12,350
like moving away from.
So he figures if the rights come and 

963
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:12,530
then the comment,
so he throws a punch.

964
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:17,531
Mrs then throws it back fist,
which makes Anderson have to go that 

965
00:42:17,531 --> 00:42:17,531
way.
Right.

966
00:42:17,531 --> 00:42:21,460
So then when he starts going that way 
the other way and catches him with a 

967
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:21,460
left hook,
it's a.

968
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:26,590
it's a beautiful combination.
It's a beautiful combination with the 

969
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:29,461
guy moves his head a lot because you 
force them because you're not just 

970
00:42:29,461 --> 00:42:29,960
throwing one in that direction.

971
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,780
You throw in a second one,
so he's going that way,

972
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,180
which is like when you throw a left 
hook,

973
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:40,510
he's going that way.
So He's already going the way to avoid 

974
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,271
the left hook.
He's got to come back and when it comes 

975
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:43,271
to when it comes back,
boom.

976
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:43,271
He catches him.
Perfect.

977
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:44,180
It was like,
it's brilliant.

978
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:49,870
You had a full time.
It's the setup before the fucking blow 

979
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,750
to.
It looked a little slower than Anderson,

980
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:55,751
so he was having a hard time catching 
them and they understand was staying on 

981
00:42:55,751 --> 00:42:57,500
the outside and kicking his legs a lot,
but they had collided in the first round

982
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,860
and he took anderson down and wrapped 
one of his legs up and had them pretty 

983
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,221
tight.
You might be getting a leg lock or 

984
00:43:06,221 --> 00:43:06,221
attempting to leg lock and Anderson got 
out of it.

985
00:43:06,221 --> 00:43:07,250
Isn't that different to where at the.

986
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:12,460
After the fight we're Weidman was like,
make your decision now you're either on 

987
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,670
board or you're not.
I think there was no,

988
00:43:13,671 --> 00:43:15,590
that was another fight.
Another fight.

989
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:17,360
Yeah.
I think that was,

990
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:21,080
um,
that was after Vittorio sick.

991
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,940
After he beat up beat tour.
He's like,

992
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:23,900
pick your title.
Yeah.

993
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:24,480
I was like,
well,

994
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,060
I'm bored.
I was like,

995
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,640
Damn Chris,
you've had up to now to decide.

996
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,380
Pretty good.
Yeah.

997
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:32,150
You know,
he's an interesting guy.

998
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:37,690
He takes a loss like a fucking champ.
I'll tell you that he lost to Yoel 

999
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:41,240
Romero by knockout and the new sitting 
on the das entering questions later with

1000
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:43,430
this aisle stitched up.
Know what I mean?

1001
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,280
He's,
uh,

1002
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,530
he's a,
uh,

1003
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,190
he's a stud.
You don't fight.

1004
00:43:48,191 --> 00:43:49,160
I was hard to do,
man.

1005
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:49,680
Oh,
I bet.

1006
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,930
Kao.
And then just answer,

1007
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:54,680
answer questions with stitches over your
eye and you're talking to press people.

1008
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,590
I've seen some guys real fucked up at 
perfect composure though.

1009
00:43:57,591 --> 00:44:00,740
You handled it perfectly.
That was at that Gustafson,

1010
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,240
Jon Jones fight where they,
I think they both went to the hospital.

1011
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,030
[inaudible] brutal Dan Rudel.
Brutal fight.

1012
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,030
It was a decision find,
I think.

1013
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:11,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

1014
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:15,530
Then it was like the,
like they just massacred each other,

1015
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:20,560
you know,
they're just beat the shit out of each 

1016
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:20,560
other.
That was a crazy fight.

1017
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,270
Yeah.
Does a fight where John was talking 

1018
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,891
about it when he was on the podcast.
We were talking about how much partied 

1019
00:44:26,891 --> 00:44:28,250
after that fight for the fight.
Partying a lot.

1020
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,280
Wow.
Yeah.

1021
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,040
It was an incredible fight.
I just remember

1022
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,870
how bloodied those guys were.
Yeah.

1023
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,300
It was a rough fight and gustafson 
shocked.

1024
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:38,190
A lot of people.
That's the crowd.

1025
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,790
You could feel the crowd swell.
What I always call mma,

1026
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:47,220
this is the phrase I use all the time.
So maybe it'll start getting annoying 

1027
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,301
to.
It's like extreme problem solving with 

1028
00:44:50,301 --> 00:44:54,140
dire physical consequences.
That's why it's a plus shit-talking 

1029
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,440
right?
Throwing that to stakes.

1030
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:57,570
Talking Shit.
Yeah,

1031
00:44:57,571 --> 00:45:02,571
high stakes.
There's an emotional battle whether or 

1032
00:45:02,571 --> 00:45:03,260
not you can keep your emotions.
How will you handle pressure this giant.

1033
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,020
The thing about conor mcgregor more than
anything,

1034
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:08,540
it's like,
no,

1035
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:13,610
we shouldn't do more than anything.
It's one of many things about them 

1036
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:13,610
that's pretty interesting.
Well,

1037
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,450
one of the most interesting things about
him as he handles pressure,

1038
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:17,270
like nobody I've ever seen.
Yeah.

1039
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:21,000
Like when he fought Aldo for the title,
he didn't even look remotely nervous.

1040
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,800
He was super relaxed,
super calm.

1041
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,500
But then you started to think though 
that you go,

1042
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:30,560
how much of what you're seeing is how 
pressure is manifested through that guy.

1043
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,020
You know what I mean?
Like for instance,

1044
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:37,050
the press conference kind of antics.
You're like,

1045
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,660
is that,
is that genuine?

1046
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,720
Is that an act?
Is that how he handles the pressure of 

1047
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,890
this high pressure situation by doing a 
fucking,

1048
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:47,790
you know,
Bang,

1049
00:45:47,791 --> 00:45:50,010
Bang show at the time.
So like it.

1050
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,500
But I personally,
I find the guy,

1051
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,610
which is,
I think what you want,

1052
00:45:53,611 --> 00:45:58,050
why someone becomes a star,
a endlessly entertaining on top of being

1053
00:45:58,051 --> 00:45:58,890
good.
So I,

1054
00:45:58,891 --> 00:46:00,240
you know,
I'm tuning into,

1055
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:01,410
I want to see the fucking show.

1056
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,070
He's the best shit talker of all time.
I don't know.

1057
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,080
I've said that before about other people
before that I said Chael Sonnen was the 

1058
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,380
best shit talker of all time and I think
he was for awhile,

1059
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,550
but I think connor,
connor,

1060
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:16,730
them and also sudden all also as well.
Connor has an additional significance to

1061
00:46:18,011 --> 00:46:20,640
a shit talking because he knocked people
dead.

1062
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,500
Right?
It's a totally different thing.

1063
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:27,501
And Chael Sonnen,
not that he's not a fucking animal 

1064
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:27,501
because Chael Sonnen is an animal and 
he's.

1065
00:46:27,501 --> 00:46:31,380
He's submitted Shogun who a shell.
Simon's a very solid grappler came very 

1066
00:46:31,411 --> 00:46:33,180
close to beating Anderson Silva in their
first fight.

1067
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:38,350
So He's a stud.
But what connor does differently is the 

1068
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:42,170
isis guys with one punch.
And that's a big factor in the fight 

1069
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:45,921
when you're watching him and he fights 
Eddie Alvarez and all of a sudden he 

1070
00:46:45,921 --> 00:46:49,380
things and with the lefthand and catches
them in some early on you go holy Shit.

1071
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:54,590
And they realize like he's fighting a 
guy now at 155 pounds and Eddie Alvarez 

1072
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:54,960
a big one,
55.

1073
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,880
He's a big guy,
big muscular guy.

1074
00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,010
The idea is he's going to be able to 
wrestle connor.

1075
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,160
He's going to be able to grab them and 
grind them out the same way you did with

1076
00:47:02,161 --> 00:47:04,020
Anthony Pettis.
Nope.

1077
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,840
Nope.
Dealing with a totally different animal.

1078
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,280
Connor's just got a totally different 
kinds of focus as far as like the way 

1079
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,940
zooms in on targets and his precision.
It's just speed.

1080
00:47:14,941 --> 00:47:17,910
He's just dropping it in there with 100 
percent speed.

1081
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,770
Like that's a big part of what he's 
doing.

1082
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:24,771
He's not loading up at all.
And the ability to stay calm when you 

1083
00:47:24,771 --> 00:47:27,861
load up,
say like if you see someone coming at 

1084
00:47:27,861 --> 00:47:29,991
you and you just go like,
all that's wasted time that's wasted 

1085
00:47:29,991 --> 00:47:33,460
time with connor has,
is the ability to be perfectly technical

1086
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:34,510
in a firefight.

1087
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:36,260
So like all those.
Yeah.

1088
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,400
Charging Adam,
this is like 13 seconds into the fight.

1089
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,520
All those charge and Adam and he knows 
how to just slide back and blam drops 

1090
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:47,980
that lefthanded in on it is a striking,
the strongest part of his.

1091
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,120
Yes,
for sure.

1092
00:47:49,121 --> 00:47:51,690
His ground game is underrated.
He's very good on the ground.

1093
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,570
It was very good defensively.
He's got a good sweep sweep.

1094
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,710
Nate Diaz,
their first pipe.

1095
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,400
People forget that.
He's the kind of guy.

1096
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:00,340
How much would you love to watch before 
he was a professional?

1097
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:03,460
I did watch them before know bar fights 
though.

1098
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,270
Oh Geez.
You know,

1099
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:06,990
he's been in some definite scraps in 
bars,

1100
00:48:06,991 --> 00:48:08,410
but I don't think you're allowed to 
like,

1101
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:11,380
get 18 in Ireland if you haven't been in
a bar fight.

1102
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:13,850
Yeah,
we're going out tonight loud,

1103
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,560
chatty.
That's probably the worst accident ever.

1104
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,730
Probably right up there.

1105
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:23,650
But um,
I saw him fight in a cage warriors.

1106
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:28,830
I tweeted to him in like 2013 before he 
came to the UFC.

1107
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:30,610
I said,
I'm a big fan man.

1108
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,510
Want you to come over and diddy?
Yeah,

1109
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,000
I mean,
like,

1110
00:48:34,001 --> 00:48:35,600
right after that,
um,

1111
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:37,360
the uh,
UFC in him.

1112
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,240
Totally coincidentally,
I didn't cry.

1113
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:44,310
I mean,
I definitely probably told anybody 

1114
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:44,310
listened to me about them because I had 
seen him fight before.

1115
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:44,310
I'm like,
this kid.

1116
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:45,360
Isis people.
Yeah.

1117
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,240
His left hand is just devastating and 
he's got a crazy style.

1118
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:54,520
He fights in his like wide stance and he
moves different and he cracks guys.

1119
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:55,480
I'm like,
this kid's legit.

1120
00:48:55,481 --> 00:48:57,730
I'd like to see them in the UFC.
I never asked you.

1121
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,820
Um,
yeah,

1122
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,810
that's January of 2013.
So it was almost four years ago.

1123
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,060
Did you,
did you think,

1124
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,190
I didn't,
I never talked to you about what did you

1125
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:10,500
think of all the,
um,

1126
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:15,560
you know,
the talks of a him floyd mayweather 

1127
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:15,560
fight.

1128
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:19,060
We'll fight them.
I guarantee you he would fight if you 

1129
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,871
think.
What kind of match do you think that 

1130
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:21,871
he's a lot bigger than floyd.
First of all,

1131
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:23,080
let's,
let's just emphasize that.

1132
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:24,430
Yeah,
he's a lot bigger,

1133
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:29,700
so it'd be a real problem as far as like
weight cutting because if they were 

1134
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,280
layla conor fight at wherever he wants,
Connor's going away somewhere around 170

1135
00:49:33,281 --> 00:49:33,890
pounds.
Right.

1136
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,960
That's where he's at.
His best like in is optima with no 

1137
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:38,960
weight cutting.
Yeah.

1138
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,630
I don't think Floyd's that big.
I think floyd,

1139
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,290
I guarantee you he's probably not more 
than one 60.

1140
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,270
Do you think floyd's bigger than one 
slash 16.

1141
00:49:46,271 --> 00:49:49,360
Real life.
Small Dude.

1142
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,710
He's a small guy.
Yeah,

1143
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:52,960
he's really short.
Doesn't mean wait,

1144
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:54,940
but he's small.
What weight did he begin?

1145
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:57,160
His career at?
Floyd mayweather is mean.

1146
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,120
I'm a huge flood bay with her fence and 
I think that when it comes to boxing,

1147
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:03,700
I think he's like one of the most 
skillful boxers that's ever lived.

1148
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:08,410
I really do technical,
if not the most 1:50.

1149
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:11,410
But uh,
that's probably what he last fought at.

1150
00:50:11,411 --> 00:50:16,411
Like didn't he make 'em when he met?
When he fought Canelo didn't you make 

1151
00:50:16,411 --> 00:50:17,840
him come down a bit and made him come 
down to like 1:54

1152
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:19,420
or something like that?
That sounds right.

1153
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:25,050
Something like that.
I thought they had some sort of a catch 

1154
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:27,530
weight fight.
I remember Canelo's fight.

1155
00:50:27,531 --> 00:50:28,220
Nobody's finding

1156
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,310
one 60 now.
He's definitely bigger.

1157
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:33,980
Or is he fighting at 1:54?
Gennady Golovkin is one 60,

1158
00:50:33,981 --> 00:50:38,981
right?
Is that the hold up is the two of them 

1159
00:50:38,981 --> 00:50:39,430
because I think I feel like Canelo has 
been fighting midway too.

1160
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,850
Like he fought cotto.
What was that?

1161
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:45,170
That wasn't that at middleweight or 
1:54.

1162
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:48,050
Alvarez.
Alvarez catch weight 1:50

1163
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,210
1:52.
Okay.

1164
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,880
Yeah.
So he made canelo loose some weight.

1165
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:55,080
He just Canelo is a lot bigger than him.
Yeah.

1166
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:59,750
So canal probably walks around maybe 20 
pounds heavier than that.

1167
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:01,790
That's a bad motherfucker too.
He's good.

1168
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,370
Yeah.
And for me,

1169
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:06,200
that just boxed him up yet what?
That's there.

1170
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:08,180
I'm hearing plot.
Oh look at that.

1171
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:13,840
Just beautiful technique.
That's the thing you have to wonder 

1172
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:13,840
could,
uh,

1173
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,490
is,
is like connor's skills,

1174
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:21,320
technical skills match up to somebody 
like the counter counter defense,

1175
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:26,340
you know,
I can't imagine they would unless 

1176
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:26,340
mayweather.

1177
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:26,340
So out of shape.
Yeah.

1178
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:30,230
I'm staying on top of his game.
Him on top of his game.

1179
00:51:30,231 --> 00:51:32,490
You're not going to hit him.
He's going to know.

1180
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,590
I mean you have to be really top level 
to catch him.

1181
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,010
It's so nuts at.
That dude is so fast that he,

1182
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:45,020
he box it like something nobody has done
with his lead hand down.

1183
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,860
Not even hip level.
Mid Thigh Times.

1184
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:52,460
Well let's,
because that forces his shoulder over.

1185
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:57,670
It's actually an easier way to block a 
lot of things if you're skillful with 

1186
00:51:57,670 --> 00:51:57,750
it.
Got shoulder roll.

1187
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:58,910
Yeah.
You got to be.

1188
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:01,190
It's not just quick and he's definitely 
quick.

1189
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:06,210
It's very quick.
But what floyd has over like almost 

1190
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:10,420
anyone else,
he said he's got this incredible 

1191
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:10,420
knowledge of what you're going to do 
before you do it.

1192
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:15,580
Like he knows so much about boxing,
about boxing as a science from his 

1193
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,660
brother or his father rather,
and his uncle,

1194
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:22,150
his uncle's roger made,
whether it was a black Mamba who was an 

1195
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:24,230
all time fucking exciting guy to watch.
And like the eighties and nineties,

1196
00:52:24,231 --> 00:52:25,760
he would starch people,
man

1197
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:30,890
sued him on those Hbo shows.
They've never had a better comedy than 

1198
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:31,410
Roger May.
Whether moments.

1199
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,900
It's the greatest.
Oh,

1200
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:34,680
you mean in between corners?
No,

1201
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:38,670
when they used to do the 24 slash seven,
24 slash seven,

1202
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:43,700
he would fucking massacre those,
like the funniest shit I've ever seen.

1203
00:52:45,241 --> 00:52:48,120
And they edited it to him.
So fucking funny.

1204
00:52:48,121 --> 00:52:53,121
One of those fights they were fighting,
maybe it was Alvarez or somebody and I 

1205
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:57,030
was like,
we've got to prepare for Florida and 

1206
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:57,930
watch his fights and uh,
and I'm just,

1207
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,460
I know I'm just going to have the fight 
in my life,

1208
00:52:59,461 --> 00:53:01,900
in my hands.
And then they cut to Roy or to,

1209
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,420
to Roger May,
whether he goes,

1210
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,720
who the fuck is Albert?
Like he was pretending he doesn't even 

1211
00:53:09,301 --> 00:53:13,080
know who the guy.
But that really was,

1212
00:53:13,081 --> 00:53:18,081
you know,
that that was a big part of the 

1213
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:18,081
preparation for.
I don't know if it in the end it was,

1214
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:19,560
but for a long time when they would go,
like,

1215
00:53:19,561 --> 00:53:21,810
how are you preparing for this fighter?
His,

1216
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:26,070
his answer and they're legit answer was 
like they have to prepare for this

1217
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,130
shit.
Yeah.

1218
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,300
We're not preparing for anything.
He better prepare a lot,

1219
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,890
you know?
And that's how they would approach it.

1220
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:33,120
Like,
we're not studying you.

1221
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:36,090
You need to study this shit right now 
because it's going to be bad.

1222
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,970
What happens to you?
It's,

1223
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,420
yeah,
it's a good point.

1224
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:41,850
You know,
Floyd's an interesting guy.

1225
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:44,640
He's had his hands broken a bunch of 
times.

1226
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:45,560
Yeah.
Is.

1227
00:53:45,561 --> 00:53:49,460
There's been rumors about fights that he
must have had a broken hand in.

1228
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:54,640
Oh,
he has had hands that were broken and 

1229
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,230
he's still boxed that.
What does that feel like?

1230
00:53:55,270 --> 00:53:57,930
As soon as got a winner's mentality,
you know,

1231
00:53:57,931 --> 00:54:02,931
you can talk all the shit you want about
that guy because it's fun to talk shit 

1232
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:02,931
about him because you've created this 
persona.

1233
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,860
Mayweather.
But it's brilliant.

1234
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:06,810
It's a brilliant thing.
What he did is brilliant.

1235
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,410
He created like someone to hate,
but it's so talented.

1236
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:12,720
You can't be them and you're buying that
pay per view,

1237
00:54:12,721 --> 00:54:15,200
which is exactly what you want.
You're hoping that it.

1238
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:15,900
Oh,
please.

1239
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:19,830
Canada.
They're hoping Canelo can catch them.

1240
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:23,790
They're hooking pack yogurt up everyone.
Yeah.

1241
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:25,590
You're the guy that he created the 
villain.

1242
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:28,140
Keep going down the line.
Every fucking guy he's fought.

1243
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:31,310
Please catch them.
Maybe you know you.

1244
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,320
You saw what one way Marquez.
He had a tough fight with Pacquiao.

1245
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:37,390
Shuts them down overnight and then he'd 
be like,

1246
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,960
I got 100 watches man.
And then that shuts them all down.

1247
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,200
People like they really fucking.
I don't hate at all.

1248
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:47,280
I think that it's a.
sometimes that persona can just get kind

1249
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,300
of boring.
It's fun.

1250
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,190
It's fun.
Smart is it?

1251
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,570
I'm like,
all right man,

1252
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:53,370
just that I'm saying like instagram,
he's like,

1253
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,150
look at all this money on my bed and 
he'll be like,

1254
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:59,010
no,
I'm going to count it.

1255
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,590
Hilarious.
It's funny,

1256
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:06,591
it's entertaining,
but it is like one note he used to hold 

1257
00:55:06,591 --> 00:55:06,591
like bricks and money up to his ear 
phone.

1258
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:11,590
Pretend he's talking on the money.
Larry cars like exactly ridiculous.

1259
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,140
They're all white too.
He's got like bugattis and shit.

1260
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:20,670
Three Jesus Christ.
Oh my goodness.

1261
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:24,120
What is that $100,000,000
that he got from what?

1262
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,560
It was just purse from one of his 
fights.

1263
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,040
He was a promoter.

1264
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,490
He made a $100.
Million Dollars.

1265
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:34,440
Yeah,
we're hip hippy.

1266
00:55:34,441 --> 00:55:36,210
Start going crazy.
But income inequality,

1267
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:39,050
there's a sense.
Look at it as he goes.

1268
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:44,120
This is just one of my many checks.
GotTa love these backseat drivers,

1269
00:55:44,461 --> 00:55:46,260
so worried about hipaa school.
Where are you going?

1270
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,070
Yeah.
Got To love these backseat drivers,

1271
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:53,370
so worried about another man's legacy 
instead of trying to write their own.

1272
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,340
Ultimately I will always have the last 
laugh.

1273
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:58,920
This is just one of many checks.
Oh,

1274
00:55:58,921 --> 00:55:59,840
cool.
$100.

1275
00:55:59,841 --> 00:56:04,841
Million dollars that I still have.
Every dime of y'all still have to work.

1276
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,840
However,
I'm happily retired.

1277
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:08,720
At the end of the day,
it's them.

1278
00:56:08,721 --> 00:56:11,820
Benjamin Franklin does matter to me.
So the joke's on you.

1279
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I've made smart investments.
Sorry for those who thought that I 

1280
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:17,000
couldn't read,
write or count.

1281
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,830
Here we go.
Y'All call them watches,

1282
00:56:19,831 --> 00:56:22,200
I call them time pieces.
You all call them bullets.

1283
00:56:22,201 --> 00:56:23,180
I call them odds.

1284
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,120
You'll call them houses.
I call them match.

1285
00:56:25,121 --> 00:56:26,110
What?
What does that mean?

1286
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:31,390
You all chartered jets and we own jets.
The money team and you go,

1287
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,770
hmm.
Yeah,

1288
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:34,360
I got it.
I think he's rich.

1289
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,840
I think he definitely has money,
so he's made a lot of fucking money,

1290
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:42,880
that's for damn sure.
He's excellent at what he does for sure.

1291
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,590
Across the board.
Yeah.

1292
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:48,160
I mean there's no doubt about it,
but he's also funny.

1293
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,910
He's 49.
Yeah,

1294
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,790
40 9:11
and he's the only guy.

1295
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:54,310
He said he hasn't broken rocky 
Marciano's record yet.

1296
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,980
He's tied it,
which is really interesting.

1297
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,520
Like I wonder if that's on purpose.
I wonder if he doesn't want to break it.

1298
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:05,670
Well,
I think there's lot people talking shit 

1299
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:05,670
about the pressure of it,
of a,

1300
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:07,750
of it going away is the thing that 
happens.

1301
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:08,980
Like as the older you get,
like,

1302
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:09,550
you know what I mean?

1303
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,890
This is,
this is a good boxing retirement age for

1304
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:13,060
him.
It's like,

1305
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,770
do you want to do 50?
Yes.

1306
00:57:14,771 --> 00:57:16,330
Well,
it's got to be a meaningful 50.

1307
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:19,930
You can't reach them.
Scrub for 50 and then you start to think

1308
00:57:19,931 --> 00:57:21,580
about,
oh fuck.

1309
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:22,090
Like,
yeah,

1310
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,390
if he was gonna Fight Pacquiao again,
I wonder what kind of.

1311
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:28,450
I'm sort of out of the loop.
I wonder what kind of numbers pack y'all

1312
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,450
gets on his fights now.
A lot of people are watching.

1313
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,590
I'm sure he's still the last one I 
think.

1314
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:35,190
But he just fought.
He did just fight.

1315
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,030
Yeah.
I didn't hear any peep about it.

1316
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,460
Yeah,
but who was he fighting that?

1317
00:57:39,461 --> 00:57:42,250
Maybe that's why he still does.
I mean,

1318
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,050
it's got to be significant numbers 
still.

1319
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:44,740
Yeah,
he must.

1320
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:47,470
Right.
So that's still a big worthwhile fight.

1321
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,900
Oh yeah.
He's got a big bankroll apparent.

1322
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,600
I mean payroll like apparently you this 
pack,

1323
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:55,840
yell,
Vargas fight surpassed 300,000

1324
00:57:55,841 --> 00:57:57,590
pay.
If view buys his pack,

1325
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,400
Y'all made whether to possible that's 
decent.

1326
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:03,120
Those are decent pay per view buys 
300,000.

1327
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,960
That's pretty good.
What did the big fights like?

1328
00:58:04,961 --> 00:58:07,400
Big MMA fights get?
Uh,

1329
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:11,530
the big ones are over a million.
I think I probably the UFC,

1330
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:16,531
I don't know if it's been released yet.
What ufc a 200 got or UFC 205.

1331
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,400
Either one of those.
Madison Square Garden was a pretty 

1332
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:23,400
fucking substantial card.
Automatically.

1333
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:26,710
The numbers of that would have been 
insane and it was a conor mcgregor card.

1334
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,410
I wouldn't have to think that that's the
biggest card ever.

1335
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,210
Ever terms of pay per view buys?
Yeah,

1336
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:36,690
I would imagine,
but I could be wrong because a 200 ad 

1337
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:37,630
brock lesnar in it.
Oh yeah.

1338
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,790
You know,
and that,

1339
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:41,400
that ended badly a few days later to 
right.

1340
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,170
Wasn't there couple wasn't badly rose.

1341
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:48,010
Just just something that I've gotten 
this fruit punch bro.

1342
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,730
Or drank a lot of fruit,
Bruh.

1343
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,060
Yeah.
You never know man.

1344
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:53,040
Cell phone minutes.
Yeah.

1345
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,510
That's what we were talking about.
Sure.

1346
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,970
Can that guy get that big without some 
help?

1347
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,190
I don't know.
I do not know.

1348
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,980
I do not know,
but I know those GNC stores,

1349
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,500
they do really well.
I saw a lot of stuff.

1350
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:09,190
He can go to those places.
They sell a lot of stuff in any of those

1351
00:59:09,191 --> 00:59:11,470
bodybuilding supplement stores.
You know,

1352
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,390
you could,
there's a lot of stuff that works,

1353
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:15,550
like there's a reason why people buy 
that stuff,

1354
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,930
but some of it is fucking steroids in it
and that's why it's working.

1355
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,320
And they legit get away with that,
huh?

1356
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,600
Well they just don't tell you what it 
is.

1357
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,300
Remember weird man,
like 15 years ago,

1358
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:29,360
one of the first big,
I forget the product name or I would say

1359
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:31,520
it,
it was like the big,

1360
00:59:31,521 --> 00:59:34,040
like everyone does this to workout and 
to lose weight.

1361
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:36,060
I forget.
It's like it had a big commercial,

1362
00:59:36,061 --> 00:59:38,660
the,
it was a successful name for the product

1363
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:44,020
and then people just started to drop 
would die and it wouldn't become like 

1364
00:59:44,031 --> 00:59:47,060
many years ago you're talking about,
I think it's about 15 to 20.

1365
00:59:47,061 --> 00:59:50,840
She talking about rip fuel one of those 
[inaudible] right?

1366
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,000
Right.
But I pedron rather federal,

1367
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:54,440
federal.
And then people were.

1368
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:59,510
I remember I was taking them 20 some 
years ago as a 20th day.

1369
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:01,550
No,
but,

1370
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,590
but then somebody's like,
oh,

1371
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:05,510
you're basically,
you're taking speed.

1372
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,190
And you're like,
oh.

1373
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:12,260
And it took a while to process that 
really was one of the key components of 

1374
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,680
what you were taking.
Like you're taking drugs right now,

1375
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:18,710
maybe taking speed,
so you're taking speed and you could 

1376
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:18,710
feel yourself get geeked out,
you know,

1377
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:24,140
heart racing.
I took a couple of those and want to do 

1378
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,441
Jitsu class once when I was like a white
belt and almost had a fucking heart 

1379
01:00:26,441 --> 01:00:26,441
attack.

1380
01:00:26,441 --> 01:00:27,050
The heart rate.
Oh my God,

1381
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:28,160
I have stopped.
I sit down.

1382
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:29,270
I was like,
what did I do?

1383
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:30,680
Yeah.
So I was young.

1384
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:34,790
I was just starting in Jujitsu and it 
wasn't like.

1385
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:39,020
I mean I knew what it felt like to roll,
but I,

1386
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,720
you know,
when you,

1387
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:42,560
when you take those,
I was like,

1388
01:00:42,561 --> 01:00:44,790
I knew something was totally wrong.
Yeah.

1389
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:47,720
So like I had been exhausted before.
I know what that felt like.

1390
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:49,970
Yeah.
I got exhausted way too quick.

1391
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:52,380
My heart was about to explode in my 
fucking chest.

1392
01:00:52,381 --> 01:00:53,270
So I was like,
Holy Shit.

1393
01:00:53,271 --> 01:00:58,271
I got to sit down.
Like even being like whatever I was 30 

1394
01:00:58,271 --> 01:00:58,700
or whatever,
29 or something like that.

1395
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,510
I still was smart enough to realize this
is a stupid idea and I got to sit down.

1396
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:08,130
Back then I was really dumb.
I took a minute before high school 

1397
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:08,130
football game.

1398
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:12,850
Yeah,
but the thing is that we had the 

1399
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:12,850
conversation before.
They're like,

1400
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:12,850
you're going to fuck people up because 
of this,

1401
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:16,460
so you have the illusion of what's going
on.

1402
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:18,140
Well maybe that would work though with 
football,

1403
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:23,141
because football is not something you 
would do where you struggle for long 

1404
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:24,060
periods of time.
You get like,

1405
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,320
it's like five,
six,

1406
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:28,250
seven.
You Jitsu gets super exhausting.

1407
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:33,280
Sure.
Because like say if you have a sparring 

1408
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:33,280
rounds,
they might be seven minutes long.

1409
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,450
Sometimes people do nine minutes.
Yeah,

1410
01:01:35,451 --> 01:01:40,451
that sounds really seven minutes was 
pretty standard and so we'd set a timer 

1411
01:01:40,451 --> 01:01:44,470
for seven minutes and then you're 
basically just going at it with someone 

1412
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:46,670
who is probably pretty fucking skillful.
Yeah.

1413
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:48,230
You're going to die.
Yeah.

1414
01:01:48,231 --> 01:01:53,231
You feel like.
Like I felt like my heart was literally 

1415
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:53,231
gonna Explode.
Like something's wrong.

1416
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:54,050
Like it was like,
dude,

1417
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:56,630
we're going away too fast right now for 
no fucking reason.

1418
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:02,020
Like man,
I got to sit down and my heart wouldn't 

1419
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:02,020
start.
It wouldn't slow down.

1420
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,140
It wouldn't.
Like normally when you work out you have

1421
01:02:03,141 --> 01:02:08,141
like safety run up a hill and you put 
your fingers on your pulse and you can 

1422
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,410
sit there and then a few seconds you 
feel him start to drop and you look down

1423
01:02:09,411 --> 01:02:12,320
at your watch and when you get to like 
1:40

1424
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,180
ish,
you could just start sprinting again.

1425
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:19,270
Right.
That's what most people like to share 

1426
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:19,270
when you're doing like interval 
workouts.

1427
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:20,460
I knew I was way over that and I wasn't 
coming down.

1428
01:02:20,461 --> 01:02:21,900
I was like,
this is not slowing down.

1429
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,630
Like this is fucked.
And you knew that's what you took.

1430
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,650
I know I took a bunch.
I'm,

1431
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,710
I'm a,
I'm a fucking retard.

1432
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:31,860
I'm such an extremist.
If it says like take two.

1433
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:33,190
I'm like,
that's too for pussies.

1434
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:38,190
So take for stupid man because you know.
Yeah.

1435
01:02:41,881 --> 01:02:46,881
Well it was like,
like doing the competitive martial arts 

1436
01:02:46,881 --> 01:02:49,230
thing when I was young made me like this
intense extremist.

1437
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,310
Sure.
Like A.

1438
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:51,240
Okay.
Everybody's running two miles.

1439
01:02:51,241 --> 01:02:52,490
I'm running five.
You know,

1440
01:02:52,491 --> 01:02:53,790
everybody's doing this.
I'm doing more,

1441
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:55,370
or is that how you do it?
Really?

1442
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:57,930
There's no other way.
If you want to beat people,

1443
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,020
you have to be.
You have to work harder than them.

1444
01:03:00,021 --> 01:03:03,000
I'm sure you can't just rely on what 
you're smarter than them.

1445
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:03,870
How do you know you're smarter than 
them?

1446
01:03:03,871 --> 01:03:06,600
They're probably pretty fucking smart.
What are you're tougher than them?

1447
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,760
They're tough.
No fucking black belts.

1448
01:03:08,761 --> 01:03:10,380
They're tough.
Like don't be stupid.

1449
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,830
Like my thought was,
I don't think so highly of yourself that

1450
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:15,420
you don't have to outwork everybody.
Wow,

1451
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,140
that's good,
man.

1452
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,020
That's a good philosophy and you can't 
take days off.

1453
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,600
Days off if you're hurt or if you're 
sore.

1454
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,350
He can't fuck off.
Fucking off is bad for your brain.

1455
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,440
It's like if you have a.
If you're competing or you're trying to 

1456
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,421
go for something like physically fucking
problem with fucking off is that it 

1457
01:03:35,421 --> 01:03:39,741
messes with your momentum.
It's not just that it messes with your 

1458
01:03:39,741 --> 01:03:40,260
skills because sometimes you 
legitimately go,

1459
01:03:40,261 --> 01:03:42,090
you know what?
My body needs a break yet,

1460
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:47,330
but you know,
your body needs a break so you make a 

1461
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:47,330
conscious decision,
but when you were supposed to work out,

1462
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:48,900
you know you should work out and you 
fuck off.

1463
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:53,010
You're just like your opinion of 
yourself slips.

1464
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:54,630
Exactly.
It has.

1465
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,570
It has an effect that goes out beyond 
just that workout.

1466
01:03:57,571 --> 01:03:59,280
Yeah.
It fucks with your confidence because it

1467
01:03:59,281 --> 01:04:03,540
fucks with your conviction.
It's why taking care of,

1468
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:07,230
of little things can bleed into taking 
care of.

1469
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:12,410
You know what I mean?
Like when you go like pick up and clean 

1470
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:12,410
up your room,
you know,

1471
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:17,070
car you're like,
now I feel good about the way this 

1472
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:17,070
looks,
that translate.

1473
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,140
I'm going to go work out today and I'm 
going to write.

1474
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:24,210
I'm going to do it.
Like those things kind of line up 

1475
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:24,210
together.
Yeah.

1476
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:26,130
Musashi had some quote about that that I
just a screenshot at the other day,

1477
01:04:26,131 --> 01:04:28,260
like a 15 year old girl.
Oh yeah.

1478
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:29,160
Yeah.
That's me.

1479
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,150
I'm one of those screenshot guys.
Don't you know if you've read here it is

1480
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:38,330
because it's just so interesting to 
approach or the approach to combat and 

1481
01:04:38,330 --> 01:04:41,990
everyday life should be the same.
The Oh,

1482
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:47,890
well that's,
that's a nice approach to combat and 

1483
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:47,890
everyday life should be the same.
That's,

1484
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:49,140
that's intense.
Yeah.

1485
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:54,290
It was a little too intense.
I have a real interesting one on my 

1486
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:54,290
instagram.

1487
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,400
I don't know if you can pull it up.
Is that the guy who touched the girl for

1488
01:04:56,401 --> 01:04:57,420
the first time?
That video?

1489
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:58,750
No,
but uh,

1490
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:02,370
it is a lady with a holiday one,
but it's interesting.

1491
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,650
Yeah.
Who is that guy that touched the girl?

1492
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,300
Did you get permission to put them on 
your part?

1493
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:10,620
To take on that one that you made me put
up?

1494
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:11,990
The Christmas one?
Yeah.

1495
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,670
That one's pretty interesting.
The one where the girl,

1496
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,430
the one that you.
Oh,

1497
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,140
when you.
Whoa.

1498
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,550
Whoa.
It up for Eczema.

1499
01:05:18,551 --> 01:05:19,480
So I mean,
it's interesting.

1500
01:05:19,481 --> 01:05:20,830
Watch it.
Okay.

1501
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:27,400
What,
what

1502
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:28,410
are you doing,
man?

1503
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:36,510
What is wrong with you and your wife?
First of all,

1504
01:05:37,691 --> 01:05:41,760
you're both fucking hilarious chisels,
but specific.

1505
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:42,970
Yeah.
You have the.

1506
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
You guys have the funniest,
silliest fucking show because you're 

1507
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,331
both so specific things,
the things that you just decide like 

1508
01:05:51,331 --> 01:05:55,321
you're wearing a shirt.
Tom's wearing a shirt that says just 

1509
01:05:55,321 --> 01:05:57,241
glass and on it now glass is a term that
hunters used when they get up on a ridge

1510
01:05:57,401 --> 01:05:59,380
and they look for things.
So when I saw that,

1511
01:05:59,381 --> 01:06:00,250
I was like,
well that's weird.

1512
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:05,251
Like what did you.
Maybe you bought that convenience store 

1513
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:05,860
when we were in Alaska or something like
that.

1514
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:10,861
Yeah.
This would be a silly gimmicky shirt 

1515
01:06:10,861 --> 01:06:10,861
toy,
but no,

1516
01:06:10,861 --> 01:06:10,861
this is a shirt like from your fucking 
podcast.

1517
01:06:10,861 --> 01:06:11,200
It is,
yeah.

1518
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:16,240
It's a tell the story because every week
we get submitted hundreds of emails with

1519
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,850
links to videos like that.

1520
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:22,550
Right,
right.

1521
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,370
I mean,
so many emails.

1522
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,720
Have you seen this?
Have you seen the and the.

1523
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:28,780
And the Internet is endless pool of 
stuff to pull from.

1524
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,420
And then we have this,
our producer blue band,

1525
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,580
I don't know if you know that.
That's our producer's name.

1526
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:34,720
The band.
Yeah,

1527
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:39,760
because it used to be red band.
There was a yellow band for awhile and 

1528
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:39,760
now there's blue band,
so,

1529
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:44,980
so blue band.
Then we'll go through a lot of this 

1530
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:47,971
stuff and edit down,
let's say like a five minute youtube 

1531
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:52,411
video until like maybe six,
10 to 15 second clips.

1532
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,050
So we're just always looking at stuff 
and it's,

1533
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:55,690
you know,
the,

1534
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:56,640
like,
uh,

1535
01:06:56,670 --> 01:07:00,340
a range of things are engaging to us.
When we got this hunter,

1536
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:05,230
his name is Fred Eichler.
I think he's an avid bowhunter.

1537
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:07,750
He bumped he bonds with a traditional 
bow,

1538
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:08,800
like a recurve bow.

1539
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:11,080
That's right.
The one of the most prominent,

1540
01:07:11,170 --> 01:07:14,500
a recurve bow hunter.
It's either a recurve bow or it might be

1541
01:07:14,501 --> 01:07:16,960
a stick bow.
What is the difference between a recurve

1542
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:21,520
bow versus what you power,
power accuracy,

1543
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:24,970
efficiency technology.
Yours is more modern.

1544
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:29,410
Yeah.
But in his side feel there's like a feel

1545
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:31,390
and if you get really good with one of 
those things,

1546
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:35,020
it becomes apparently very addicted to 
shoot because,

1547
01:07:35,021 --> 01:07:36,760
uh,
like people who like recurves,

1548
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,860
they like shooting at targets.
It's an instinctive thing.

1549
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:43,900
Okay.
So you have to shoot a bunch of arrows 

1550
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,640
to kind of know where the Arrow is going
and he shoot differently too because you

1551
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:48,190
don't really hold it very long.
You got,

1552
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:51,520
you kind of draw it back and then they 
let it go pretty quickly.

1553
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:55,180
Whereas a compound bow,
the whole idea of a compound bows,

1554
01:07:55,181 --> 01:08:00,181
there's an extreme amount of force 
that's exhibited in the beginning or 

1555
01:08:00,181 --> 01:08:01,060
it's expressed through this campaign and
through the limbs.

1556
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:04,780
But then as a camp turns over,
it gets easier because of leverage.

1557
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:10,170
So I don't remember the resistance 
starts when you kind of start at the 

1558
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:13,261
beginning,
there's massive resistance and then 

1559
01:08:13,261 --> 01:08:15,511
there's a big lead off at the end.
So like my boat takes 84 pounds to pull 

1560
01:08:15,511 --> 01:08:16,210
back,
but

1561
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:19,230
at the end of it it's easy to hold and 
wouldn't have it.

1562
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:24,310
What's the different?
His would go hard the whole way is hard 

1563
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:24,310
the whole way,
however hard it is,

1564
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:29,211
it's hard the whole way and it actually 
gets more difficult as you pull back 

1565
01:08:29,211 --> 01:08:29,211
instead of less difficult.
Wow.

1566
01:08:29,211 --> 01:08:32,640
So it's the opposite of a compound bow.
So the compound bows,

1567
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:35,390
it's difficult to pull in the beginning 
and then the camp settle in.

1568
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:36,980
Oops.
The Cam settle in.

1569
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:39,030
It's beautiful.
You can just hold it there.

1570
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:44,410
Like if you're waiting on something you 
could hold it there because it's just 

1571
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:47,160
super hard to hold one of those stick 
bows because you're pulling the end of 

1572
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,580
it is as hard as you can get it,
you know,

1573
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:53,590
and it's basically,
it pulls back and forth depending upon 

1574
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:57,611
like how much pressure you put on it.
You can pull it more if you're stronger 

1575
01:08:57,611 --> 01:08:58,790
or if you're weaker,
you can only get to a certain point.

1576
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:00,680
It sounds like if the train to shoot 
with this thing,

1577
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:04,160
well it depends on now most of the time 
no because most of them are fairly weak.

1578
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:08,480
But like um,
you can make them like really powerful.

1579
01:09:08,481 --> 01:09:13,481
You can make them.
I mean if you had a recurve bow and 

1580
01:09:13,481 --> 01:09:14,540
particularly the Mongols apparently 
according to Dan Carlin,

1581
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:19,541
that hardcore history guy who's awesome,
he said their bows were 160 pounds to 

1582
01:09:19,761 --> 01:09:20,870
pull back.
Woo.

1583
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,280
Which is crazy.
Yeah,

1584
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:23,840
I mean it's like doing,
that's,

1585
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,920
that's so like,
it's what you're essentially doing is 

1586
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:32,560
you're doing like an 80 pound push and 
an 80 pound pole until the same time.

1587
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:36,350
It's a lot to be able to do that a lot 
of times in a row.

1588
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:39,500
It's way harder than doing that with a 
compound bow because a compound,

1589
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:41,420
but it's just a little difficult and 
then easy.

1590
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,940
And this is who would have these 160 
pounds.

1591
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,100
The Mongols did Mongo,
this is,

1592
01:09:46,101 --> 01:09:49,070
you know,
12 hundreds somewhere around then they,

1593
01:09:49,071 --> 01:09:52,520
that was technology back then because 
they figured out what a recurve bows.

1594
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:54,320
It's crazy bow that,
uh,

1595
01:09:54,321 --> 01:09:56,410
the way it's designed,
if you see a recurve,

1596
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:59,660
both that's not strong,
it doesn't even look like it would work.

1597
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:03,800
Like if you're seen what they look like,
I saw it in this guy's video.

1598
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:04,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

1599
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:09,850
This Fred Eichler guy probably,
I don't even think he had a recurve bow 

1600
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:09,850
on this.
I think he,

1601
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:11,030
I think he shoots with what they call a 
stick bow,

1602
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:16,090
which is the most prevalent I think I 
read in his bio recurve could be a 

1603
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:19,901
recurve.
I bet he's got a bunch of different 

1604
01:10:19,901 --> 01:10:19,901
ones.
Yeah.

1605
01:10:19,901 --> 01:10:20,600
White Buffalo recurves that what he 
shoots with.

1606
01:10:20,601 --> 01:10:25,601
Okay.
See if you can show a picture of one 

1607
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:26,640
without the string.
Um,

1608
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:28,280
because they're,
they're so weird looking or you know,

1609
01:10:28,281 --> 01:10:33,281
what,
just see if you could find a picture of 

1610
01:10:33,281 --> 01:10:33,281
the Mongol Bose because those are the 
first ones.

1611
01:10:33,281 --> 01:10:37,330
I think somewhere in that time of the,
of the world was the first ones when 

1612
01:10:37,371 --> 01:10:41,150
people had figured out how to make a 
recurve bow.

1613
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:46,210
See that's what the top ones,
what looks like without the string and 

1614
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:49,720
it's going to go back to the shape where
you see in the bottom right in the same 

1615
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:49,720
position.
So it is.

1616
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,790
So it's totally bent the other way.
So because of that it stores up all this

1617
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:57,791
extra energy because it's your polling 
so far back and it has this tremendous 

1618
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,240
snapping effect when you let go of the 
string.

1619
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,370
Hmm.
It's pretty dope.

1620
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:02,330
They,
I mean they,

1621
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:07,910
they are incredibly smart for figuring 
this out and then to make them 

1622
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:09,170
unbelievably tough.
See,

1623
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:10,870
that's what it looks like on the strong.
Yeah.

1624
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:14,880
And make them so tough that you can pull
it all the way back the other way.

1625
01:11:15,190 --> 01:11:20,190
Like they had to figure this shit out.
So they had to use a bunch of different 

1626
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:20,400
materials that comes out with incredible
for us.

1627
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:20,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

1628
01:11:20,971 --> 01:11:25,971
That's still not as fast as probably a 
modern day compound bow and also not 

1629
01:11:26,191 --> 01:11:28,320
that consistent because they didn't have
scales.

1630
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:34,120
Their arrows,
the arrows are all probably very 

1631
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,390
inconsistent because you're like,
you're making your own broadheads.

1632
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,730
Some of them might be a little heavier 
than others.

1633
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:41,340
The factory mass producing them.
Yeah.

1634
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:46,440
Now they're making arrows that are like 
aluminum and carbon fiber cores and they

1635
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:48,200
have like a very like,
you know,

1636
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:53,230
you buy these arrows from like eastern 
or one of the top level companies that 

1637
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:54,690
made arrows.
They have like this super high tolerance

1638
01:11:54,691 --> 01:11:56,520
levels for like each,
each,

1639
01:11:56,550 --> 01:12:01,550
each one of the arrows that leaves their
factory there super straight like spin 

1640
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:02,460
him and shit and make sure that 
everything's good.

1641
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:03,450
Yeah.
No,

1642
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:06,500
it's a totally.
It's incredible how that,

1643
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:08,100
that technology evolved.
Yeah.

1644
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:13,110
So there's a lot of these guys like this
guy you're talking about the glass and 

1645
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:16,010
guy,
he still uses like one of those 

1646
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:16,010
primitive boasts,
but he's just so good.

1647
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:16,010
He can get away with it.

1648
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:17,800
It says.
I mean there's bio is incredible,

1649
01:12:17,801 --> 01:12:21,470
but in this video it starts with him.
Uh,

1650
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:25,960
he,
he shoots a moose and it drops quick and

1651
01:12:25,961 --> 01:12:28,960
he fucking comes close to coming in his 
pants.

1652
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:32,230
Like he,
he makes a sound that you don't even,

1653
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:34,290
you can't.
He goes like,

1654
01:12:34,291 --> 01:12:34,840
like,
like,

1655
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,850
like can you show it to us?
Uh,

1656
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:37,280
yeah.

1657
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:41,070
Are you allowed to play it online?
Did you get pulled from anything?

1658
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,010
No.
Playing on Youtube,

1659
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:42,170
no.

1660
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,080
And,
and we also play,

1661
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:47,140
I mean the audio is,
is what's incredible,

1662
01:12:47,141 --> 01:12:50,440
but then he starts talking about glass 
in and he's like,

1663
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:54,490
we were just coming around meadow glass 
and glass and we were like,

1664
01:12:54,491 --> 01:12:55,560
let's go,
let's glass.

1665
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,500
And he goes,
keeps going.

1666
01:12:56,501 --> 01:12:57,160
Glass,
glass,

1667
01:12:57,161 --> 01:12:58,000
glass,
glass and glass,

1668
01:12:58,030 --> 01:13:00,670
which is looking through binoculars,
which we discovered,

1669
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:06,060
but then we played it so much.
People like I would post a picture of 

1670
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,620
myself like I'm about to go on stage and
they're like,

1671
01:13:07,621 --> 01:13:09,760
are you glassing and,
or you know,

1672
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:11,650
like if you talk to somebody like,
what'd you do today?

1673
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:16,670
Like Oh,
I hung out and they're like glass and 

1674
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:16,670
you're like,
yeah.

1675
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:16,670
So then it morphed into meaning,
like,

1676
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:16,880
just chill.
Yeah.

1677
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:19,590
And I don't know,
it just kind of picked up from there.

1678
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,960
You guys have so many of these though.
I would have to ask you.

1679
01:13:21,961 --> 01:13:26,961
Okay.
What's the deal with jeans calling 

1680
01:13:26,961 --> 01:13:30,760
everybody jeans.
Like when you guys were on that and you 

1681
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:30,760
had explained it to me.
Yeah.

1682
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:35,140
The latest thing is with that first we 
had an electrician over at the house and

1683
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:38,290
whenever you're in the house,
you know your call your spouse,

1684
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:40,330
I'd be like Jane's Dino,
because that's what I call her.

1685
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:43,090
So then she walked down the stairs and 
he goes,

1686
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,560
gene,
would you like me to put the heat?

1687
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:47,590
And we just let it go.
We called her jeans,

1688
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:53,080
but then we started going into starbucks
and ordering our drinks.

1689
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:56,320
It's just like a stupid thing like that.
We told our listeners,

1690
01:13:56,321 --> 01:14:01,321
we do,
we do this regularly just to amuse 

1691
01:14:01,321 --> 01:14:04,261
ourselves,
which is we'll call them jeans and then 

1692
01:14:04,261 --> 01:14:08,280
say thank you mom,
your I love you mommy at the end and no 

1693
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,221
one ever.
The order happens so fast and it's so 

1694
01:14:11,221 --> 01:14:11,740
like programs that they never cashed.
Never say like,

1695
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:13,570
what did you say?
So like when I,

1696
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,810
when I pull up like,
welcome to starbucks.

1697
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:18,250
What,
what can I get for you?

1698
01:14:18,251 --> 01:14:22,330
It'd be like a hey jeans,
I want to get an iced coffee,

1699
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:25,020
extra ice and what?
You want a double tall.

1700
01:14:25,021 --> 01:14:25,840
So we're allowed to.
Okay.

1701
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:27,070
That'll be 60,
70 words.

1702
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:28,000
I'll.
I'm like thanks mommy.

1703
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:30,700
And then I just pull up.
So we told them we did that.

1704
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:35,080
People sent us videos of them doing it 
fucking hilarious.

1705
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:40,920
Like a guy like getting his uh,
he was talking to a bill play place and 

1706
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:40,930
he's like,
hey mommy,

1707
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:43,120
I don't understand what this bill means.
And the other guy is like,

1708
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,380
yeah.
So that first section,

1709
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:48,520
like they don't even address that.
You're calling someone mommy or jeans or

1710
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:50,230
saying thank you mommy or I love you 
mommy.

1711
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:50,770
I'm like,
okay,

1712
01:14:50,771 --> 01:14:52,180
have a good day.
Like they just,

1713
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:56,470
it speaks more to almost have 
preprogrammed customer service becomes,

1714
01:14:56,471 --> 01:15:01,471
you know,
they're not even acknowledging that 

1715
01:15:01,471 --> 01:15:01,471
you're saying something ridiculous to 
them.

1716
01:15:01,471 --> 01:15:02,200
No,
no,

1717
01:15:02,201 --> 01:15:03,610
they're not.
It's hilarious.

1718
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,500
Yeah.
But also like,

1719
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,390
what are you saying when someone says 
something like that to you,

1720
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:09,100
you'd probably like,
you're so scrambled.

1721
01:15:09,101 --> 01:15:09,970
I think so,
yeah.

1722
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,810
Because it doesn't make any sense,
but started off not making any sense,

1723
01:15:13,811 --> 01:15:15,580
but then it picked up and made a lot of 
sense.

1724
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:18,550
So clearly you can talk English and then
it gets to the end.

1725
01:15:18,551 --> 01:15:19,600
He calls you mommy.
You're like,

1726
01:15:19,601 --> 01:15:20,470
whoa.
What happened?

1727
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:23,680
One time we called the renaissance in 
Cincinnati,

1728
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:24,850
the hotel,
the hotel,

1729
01:15:24,851 --> 01:15:27,190
because the year before,
before,

1730
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:32,640
a few months before my son was born,
we were there for a wedding and 

1731
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,860
Christina had like a 32nd fart.
So we,

1732
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:41,290
she's very pregnant.
We came back and we talked about it and 

1733
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:44,050
we decided it deserved its own names.
What's called the Cincinnati Fart.

1734
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:49,140
Oh Jesus.
And we figured out what room number we 

1735
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:49,840
were in and we called the hotel and I 
go,

1736
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:53,350
can I help you?

1737
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,840
I want a book,
I want to stay there,

1738
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:59,050
but I want to commemorate the Cincinnati
part.

1739
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,150
And she goes,
I'm sorry,

1740
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:02,590
what was that?
And I go,

1741
01:16:02,650 --> 01:16:07,650
I want to stay in this room.
I think it's from six one eight because 

1742
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:07,650
this has a fart happened there.
And she goes,

1743
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:08,920
I just having a little trouble.
What was that?

1744
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,210
The what?
And I'm like,

1745
01:16:12,211 --> 01:16:13,990
this Cincinnati Fart.
And she's like,

1746
01:16:14,890 --> 01:16:16,270
can you spell it for me?
And I go,

1747
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:17,650
yeah,
f a R T.

1748
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:21,220
and she stayed professional.
Like she was like,

1749
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,130
oh,
okay,

1750
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:24,540
I'll see what I can do it.
Yeah,

1751
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:28,330
she didn't probably have cameras on you.
You can't go,

1752
01:16:28,331 --> 01:16:31,090
what the fuck are you talking about?
Well,

1753
01:16:31,091 --> 01:16:32,310
I did have a,
uh,

1754
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:34,510
a flooring guy.
I go,

1755
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:37,770
can you do this floor for me?
And he's like,

1756
01:16:37,771 --> 01:16:39,310
oh,
I can send you some samples.

1757
01:16:39,311 --> 01:16:40,060
And I go,
great.

1758
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:41,520
He goes,
who do I send it to?

1759
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,470
I go to your mom's house.
And he was like,

1760
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,670
what was that?
And I go,

1761
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:46,540
your mom feeling.
He goes,

1762
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,380
my mom's house.
I go,

1763
01:16:47,381 --> 01:16:48,350

1764
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:51,700
our company,

1765
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:53,140
And I go,

1766
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:53,890
And he was like,
alright,

1767
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,330
you have a good day.
And he hung up the phone and I go like I

1768
01:16:58,331 --> 01:16:59,590
was,
I wasn't trying to frame.

1769
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:01,810
It was a totally normal.
I wasn't funny.

1770
01:17:01,811 --> 01:17:02,110
I go,
no,

1771
01:17:02,111 --> 01:17:03,910
that's the name of the [inaudible] 
didn't want to listen.

1772
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:04,720
He was like,

1773
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:05,830
okay.
You have a good day.

1774
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:07,390
Like wow.
Okay.

1775
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,930
Did you try.
You let them hang.

1776
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:10,040
You should have said it's actually

1777
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:13,310
the name of podcasts we,
it's called tried to explain it,

1778
01:17:13,311 --> 01:17:15,660
but he was look it up on itunes.
It's very popular.

1779
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:17,510
He was,
he was pretty quick with like,

1780
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:18,550
Oh,
this is a joke.

1781
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:19,540
And I go,
okay.

1782
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:21,920
He grew up with a lot of your mom jokes.
Yeah,

1783
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:23,780
he did not lying it.
Not Buying.

1784
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:27,410
It seems like a,
a guy that just didn't get it.

1785
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,740
Can you play Fred?
Will you plays audio?

1786
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,930
The glass guy?
Yeah.

1787
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,290
It's.
Where do you have it on your phone?

1788
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:36,860
It's on youtube.
Okay.

1789
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:40,630
What is the name of the video?
It's called saved on his phone.

1790
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:44,300
Tell you,
give me one moment.

1791
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:47,330
I'll look.
Tom Segura at the ice house tonight.

1792
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:49,160
Sold out.
I'm at.

1793
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:54,161
I'm doing dahmer air show tonight.
And you're at the laugh factory 

1794
01:17:54,161 --> 01:17:54,161
tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

1795
01:17:54,161 --> 01:17:58,080
Yeah.
With Duncan trussell and Tony 

1796
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:58,080
Hinchcliffe.
Dude.

1797
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,290
Got a couple of Bop bop,
bop,

1798
01:18:00,291 --> 01:18:00,620
bop,
bop,

1799
01:18:00,621 --> 01:18:00,920
bop,
bop,

1800
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:03,050
bop.
This should be it.

1801
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:04,640
Okay.
Crank it up.

1802
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:08,020
Okay.
That looks like a compound bow.

1803
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:12,050
Really.
Couldn't tell.

1804
01:18:12,051 --> 01:18:14,180
It was moving really quick.
Yeah,

1805
01:18:14,181 --> 01:18:19,181
that's a compound.
Will see the cameras at the top of the 

1806
01:18:19,181 --> 01:18:19,181
bow.
That's not a permanent boat.

1807
01:18:19,181 --> 01:18:20,660
All that's super modern bow

1808
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:24,870
I think,

1809
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:26,770
but this suit knows how to do this.
He's like,

1810
01:18:26,771 --> 01:18:31,771
Oh yeah.
Know he's so professional or I've seen 

1811
01:18:31,771 --> 01:18:31,771
this guy on tv a ton of time.
Yeah,

1812
01:18:31,771 --> 01:18:31,771
yeah,
yeah.

1813
01:18:31,771 --> 01:18:33,660
He's got a TV show that I watched.
Dude,

1814
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:37,350
if you go over my house,
you think I'm a crazy person.

1815
01:18:37,351 --> 01:18:40,330
You change your profile pic.
Yeah.

1816
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,660
It's a silly picture of me with a camera
on my face.

1817
01:18:42,661 --> 01:18:45,420
Hide in the trees.
I'm trying to make sure that this is the

1818
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:50,421
right video.
I'm looking as we're going through the 

1819
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:50,421
trees.
Every once in a while I stopped,

1820
01:18:50,421 --> 01:18:51,000
but I can still see the moon through the
tree.

1821
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,800
Blended in good.
When does it get good at archery?

1822
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:57,350
Archery bows down.
Yeah.

1823
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,710
That's coming up it.

1824
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:03,920
Here we go.
Okay.

1825
01:19:03,921 --> 01:19:04,830
It's a bad thing.

1826
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:06,990
Full shot.

1827
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:11,070
Wait,
count.

1828
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:15,660
Countdown to getting real funny.
I just smoked her.

1829
01:19:15,661 --> 01:19:18,610
She's got to watch her.
Watch her.

1830
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:23,130
She's going to go down to her law.
Jesus,

1831
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:25,110
I don't like this part.

1832
01:19:36,490 --> 01:19:41,490
I was raised out here.
Early boarding.

1833
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:44,840
Look at the.
Look at the metal.

1834
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:48,650
This is why.
This is why we came up here.

1835
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:51,740
We'd been slipping along this big huge 
meadow.

1836
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:53,000
Big,
long,

1837
01:19:53,001 --> 01:19:55,460
tall metal.
We've been slipping along here.

1838
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:00,640
Just glass and just glass and glass and 
all of a sudden I didn't even have.

1839
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,390
I didn't even put my headset on.
I'm like,

1840
01:20:02,391 --> 01:20:03,970
ah,
we're just glassing huge.

1841
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:06,340
Let's just keep going.
Let's glass.

1842
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:11,570
Let's look like holy smokes.
Like got a Moose Moose.

1843
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:13,200
And I'm like,
Oh man,

1844
01:20:13,201 --> 01:20:14,370
it's a bowl.
It's a full.

1845
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:15,120
I'm like,
no,

1846
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:17,220
it's a cow.
The cow right there.

1847
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,150
That was unbelievable.
We came right around this tree.

1848
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:25,530
Is a cow more significant than a bowl?
No.

1849
01:20:25,790 --> 01:20:27,980
No,
unless he only had a tag for a cow.

1850
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,540
Oh,
depends on why.

1851
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:31,070
Why he shot a cow.
Not a,

1852
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:34,190
not a bull.
Sometimes it depends on the unit.

1853
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:37,520
It depends on how many cows they have 
versus how many bowls they have.

1854
01:20:37,521 --> 01:20:42,521
They might want people to kill cows.
They probably want a certain amount of 

1855
01:20:42,521 --> 01:20:43,940
cows to be killed a year.
They have weird.

1856
01:20:43,941 --> 01:20:48,941
Um,
who decides that fish and game 

1857
01:20:48,941 --> 01:20:48,941
department,
they go to the.

1858
01:20:48,941 --> 01:20:49,760
We have too many heads entirely on where
you are.

1859
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:52,070
Depends entirely on what part of the 
world you're in.

1860
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:53,580
And then do you report it?
Yep.

1861
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:56,280
Yeah.
You tag a tag.

1862
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,150
An animal.
Let me save you a,

1863
01:20:58,250 --> 01:20:59,720
you shoot a moose.
That's Moose.

1864
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:02,440
This one I shot in British Columbia.
Really?

1865
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:04,880
Yeah.
And you,

1866
01:21:04,881 --> 01:21:06,950
uh,
you have a tag and you take that,

1867
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:07,820
you know,
you,

1868
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:09,020
you have to pay for it.

1869
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:10,660
And they allot a certain amount of,
um,

1870
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:12,560
some places they have what's called over
the counter,

1871
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:17,920
which means they just have,
it's just kind of open to anybody who 

1872
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,670
wants to pay for the hunting fee and pay
for the tag feet to some species.

1873
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,110
Particularly.
Would you shoot that with.

1874
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:22,930
That was with a rifle.
Really?

1875
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:27,440
Yep.
Were you glassing before a glass in?

1876
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:30,920
No,
that was like four solid days of hunting

1877
01:21:30,921 --> 01:21:35,921
with no luck.
And then we're literally driving down 

1878
01:21:35,921 --> 01:21:39,620
this road and off the side of the road.
Seventy yards away was a moose.

1879
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:42,740
It was so crazy.
It happened so fast.

1880
01:21:42,741 --> 01:21:44,510
We stopped the truck,
the Moose looked up.

1881
01:21:44,511 --> 01:21:46,510
He didn't know what we were.
I put a,

1882
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:47,990
uh,
a shell.

1883
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:52,010
I put a bullet in the chamber,
push the Bolt in,

1884
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:54,210
took the safety off Saturday.
My Eye.

1885
01:21:54,230 --> 01:21:56,000
I'm like,
do I have time to lean against anything?

1886
01:21:56,001 --> 01:21:57,180
I didn't have time to lean against 
anything.

1887
01:21:57,410 --> 01:22:02,060
I just held it up freehand because he 
was only about 65 slash 70 yards away.

1888
01:22:02,061 --> 01:22:03,500
He was really close.
It was so close.

1889
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:06,800
I knew I could make the shot and boom,
boom.

1890
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:08,750
And then down immediately there was done
immediately.

1891
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:12,140
So weird feeling,
man.

1892
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:14,220
It's a weird feeling.
Like I,

1893
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,920
I'll be honest,
I don't do what that guy does,

1894
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:20,210
but I use part of you gets pumped,
party gets excited,

1895
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:24,380
but I don't act like that guy seems 
really little theatrical.

1896
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:26,060
But I mean that's just,
I don't,

1897
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:31,090
I'm not him personally,
but for him maybe that's just how we 

1898
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:31,100
react to it here.
He was very excited.

1899
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:32,480
Very excited.
Yeah.

1900
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:36,020
Which I understand it's not easy to do,
especially with a bow and arrow.

1901
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,390
Very difficult to do.
It will say.

1902
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:43,420
I do feel this thing.
I'm not an anti hunting guy at all to 

1903
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,890
like bad.
It's hard to watch the um,

1904
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:48,290
the animal fall apart.
I don't like it.

1905
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,790
Yeah.
It's hard to watch anything die.

1906
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:55,120
Yeah.
So I'm fun and it's one of the problems 

1907
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,701
that we have with eating meat in this 
country is that we don't watch the 

1908
01:22:57,701 --> 01:22:57,701
animals dying.
Of course it totally affects you.

1909
01:22:57,701 --> 01:22:59,050
I went to a slaughterhouse,
wants me to,

1910
01:22:59,051 --> 01:23:00,530
and I was a teenager though.
Oh really?

1911
01:23:00,610 --> 01:23:03,290
Yeah.
How long does stop you from eating meat?

1912
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:06,400
No few hours at,
but it still

1913
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,160
was one of those images that you're 
like,

1914
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:13,380
fuck me.
We felt fear factor in the slaughter 

1915
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:14,590
house once and you could feel it.
You'd feel it in the building.

1916
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:16,150
I mean,
maybe it's just my head.

1917
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:17,540
Yeah,
but it didn't feel like it.

1918
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:21,220
It felt like a dull hum of death 
everywhere.

1919
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:26,221
You were just like,
there was almost like an ambient sound 

1920
01:23:26,221 --> 01:23:26,530
that you could pick up.
I remember the floors,

1921
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:31,620
we had like rain boots on,
walk around and there's just like so 

1922
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:34,430
much fluid,
so much blood guts.

1923
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:36,070
He was like a pieces of things,
you know?

1924
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:37,780
Fuck man.
Yeah.

1925
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:40,390
It makes you really understand what the 
fuck you're looking at.

1926
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:44,290
They would like it.
It definitely could deter you.

1927
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:45,650
I mean I still,
I was like,

1928
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:48,040
I was a young teenager and I still liked
me,

1929
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:52,690
but I think I definitely would be harder
as I'm older.

1930
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,330
What do you think.
This is something I've considered,

1931
01:23:55,331 --> 01:23:59,290
like do you think that if you took kids 
at an early age to a slaughterhouse,

1932
01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:01,720
what percentage of them would continue 
to eat meat?

1933
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:03,940
You lose a significant number of them.
Right.

1934
01:24:03,941 --> 01:24:04,900
That's very interesting.
Yeah.

1935
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:08,980
So children probably shouldn't be 
exposed to something that horrific,

1936
01:24:08,981 --> 01:24:09,850
somewhat argued.
Right.

1937
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:14,900
That's,
that's a good argument that maybe 

1938
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:16,711
children don't need to see an animal get
a piston through its head and getting 

1939
01:24:16,711 --> 01:24:18,100
hung up by his ankles and he got it.
But guess what?

1940
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,490
Kids who grow up on farms,
they see that shit through kids who grow

1941
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:26,491
up in hunting families.
They see that shit and it doesn't seem 

1942
01:24:26,491 --> 01:24:28,711
to be.
It doesn't seem to bother them that 

1943
01:24:28,711 --> 01:24:28,711
much.
Yeah.

1944
01:24:28,711 --> 01:24:30,010
I think when kids don't see something 
like that and then they see it,

1945
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:31,630
then it really fucks them up.

1946
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:33,010
But we,
um,

1947
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:38,380
when we shot this elk in a to hone ranch
when they were taking the Elca part.

1948
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:39,400
Yeah,
we were,

1949
01:24:39,401 --> 01:24:44,401
you know,
cutting the quarters off and doing all 

1950
01:24:44,401 --> 01:24:44,401
this stuff.
This one guy,

1951
01:24:44,401 --> 01:24:48,120
his wife and his little girl came to 
watch and one thing she said was this 

1952
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:51,920
elk was lying down on the ground dead.
She's like,

1953
01:24:51,921 --> 01:24:53,880
because he's the P.
Yeah.

1954
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:57,580
And she's like two.
And she's a tiny little girl.

1955
01:24:57,610 --> 01:24:59,530
She's probably barely talking.
She's like,

1956
01:24:59,531 --> 01:25:02,380
is he sleepy?
And the mom was like,

1957
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:03,610
no,
he's dead.

1958
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,960
She told her.
Yeah,

1959
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:07,550
yeah,
yeah.

1960
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:10,060
You can change your perspective if you 
do what you do for sure.

1961
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:14,860
If you kill and eat what you killed.
I think that changed your perspective on

1962
01:25:14,861 --> 01:25:15,340
it.
Well,

1963
01:25:15,341 --> 01:25:20,341
I don't think people have to do it.
I'm not one of those people that think 

1964
01:25:20,341 --> 01:25:20,341
that people have to do,
but I do.

1965
01:25:20,341 --> 01:25:20,830
But it changes you a little bit.
Right.

1966
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:25,890
When you remember that,
like you did this and then you used it 

1967
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:27,550
to meet for something.
It's totally different.

1968
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,290
It's a totally different feel when you 
eat it.

1969
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:34,640
Like,
and I'm not one of those people that 

1970
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:34,640
doesn't think you should be able to get 
me to the supermarket.

1971
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:36,130
I think you should,
but I think there's,

1972
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:39,910
there's definitely something weird about
not knowing how that animal died.

1973
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:41,710
Yeah.
Like that's not normal,

1974
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:44,140
right?
It's like our,

1975
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:49,290
our brains,
the way we formulate ideas a lot of is 

1976
01:25:49,290 --> 01:25:51,430
based around experience.
Right?

1977
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:55,480
And the experience,
like if you're eating a piece of meat or

1978
01:25:55,481 --> 01:25:58,300
if you're even eating fruits or 
vegetables for that matter,

1979
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:04,170
you will understand that experience 
better if you go through the whole 

1980
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:05,390
process,
like if you're there when the plants are

1981
01:26:05,391 --> 01:26:07,010
growing,
maybe help water them,

1982
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,800
maybe pick them,
maybe cut them up and serve them,

1983
01:26:09,801 --> 01:26:10,580
and then you're eating them.

1984
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:13,400
Having a garden is fucking cool thing.
It's a cool thing.

1985
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:19,050
It gives you some weird thankfulness,
which I think is one of the things 

1986
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:22,931
that's a problem with people today is 
that things come so easy to us that we 

1987
01:26:22,931 --> 01:26:27,401
don't have obstacles to overcome and 
we're not super thankful for the super 

1988
01:26:27,401 --> 01:26:28,690
easy life that we have.
Totally.

1989
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:30,440
We think of it as being like,
yeah,

1990
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:31,490
it's just what it is,
man.

1991
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:34,100
Traveling somewhere poor.
We'll give you a perspective on that for

1992
01:26:34,101 --> 01:26:34,940
sure.
Oh,

1993
01:26:34,941 --> 01:26:36,200
I imagine.
Yeah.

1994
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:38,570
Go into like a really poor place.
You'll,

1995
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,420
you'll definitely rethink,
uh,

1996
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,550
you know,
calling over the waiter.

1997
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:45,260
Jamie,
who was it that was telling us.

1998
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,060
Yeah.
Who was it that was telling us that they

1999
01:26:47,061 --> 01:26:49,700
landed in the Congo and they were in 
the,

2000
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:51,920
uh,
they landed in the wrong spot.

2001
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,800
Who the fuck was that?
Was that Tom?

2002
01:26:54,801 --> 01:26:56,420
Papa?
It might've been Tom.

2003
01:26:56,421 --> 01:26:57,530
Papa.
It was Tom.

2004
01:26:57,531 --> 01:26:59,480
Papa.
Yes.

2005
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:01,390
Emergency lanes.
Yes.

2006
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,470
Yeah,
they're fucking their balloon.

2007
01:27:03,471 --> 01:27:05,220
They went up in a balloon like asshole.

2008
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:09,500
Tom Pop is awesome.
He's really funny.

2009
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:11,810
He's a funny dude.
He's great on podcast too,

2010
01:27:11,811 --> 01:27:13,370
man.
He sits like a,

2011
01:27:13,371 --> 01:27:16,760
an elegant dance partner conversation.
You're totally right.

2012
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:21,850
Yeah.
But he's got an amazing story about how 

2013
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:23,450
they were up in this building.
It was Tom Papa his live show anyway.

2014
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:28,510
Totally sure.
Have you done any live show his live 

2015
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:28,510
show?
What is it?

2016
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:28,990
Tom Poppin and friends.
Was it a state a podcast?

2017
01:27:28,991 --> 01:27:29,390
It,
no,

2018
01:27:29,391 --> 01:27:32,720
it's a live scripted to like,
um,

2019
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:35,280
like a 19 thirties radio show.
Yeah.

2020
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:36,040
Yeah.
And he'll be like,

2021
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:37,610
out of Largo.
No,

2022
01:27:37,611 --> 01:27:38,780
Shit.
It's fucking fun.

2023
01:27:38,781 --> 01:27:40,760
I've been on it a few times and he'll 
like,

2024
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:44,660
what he does is he'll comes out,
there's a fucking band that plays,

2025
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:46,400
like throwback,
you know,

2026
01:27:46,410 --> 01:27:50,960
kind of music.
And then he hosts it like a radio show.

2027
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:52,940
So.
And then there's a theme,

2028
01:27:52,941 --> 01:27:57,150
there's stories and inbetween these 
sketches with live actors like you,

2029
01:27:57,151 --> 01:28:00,230
you have a script and you read in front 
of an audience stand up in between.

2030
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,750
Does he have his own podcast?
Yeah,

2031
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,450
I think so.
What does Tom Papa's podcast for sure.

2032
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:09,830
How do I not know this answer?
Because I knew.

2033
01:28:11,610 --> 01:28:14,730
Do you use to do one with somebody?
He may have.

2034
01:28:14,731 --> 01:28:17,100
I come to pop.
That's right.

2035
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:18,630
That's right.
It's on itunes.

2036
01:28:18,631 --> 01:28:21,930
The whole deal.
That was a really good comic too.

2037
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:24,540
He's a very funny guy.
He just has a special that just came out

2038
01:28:24,541 --> 01:28:25,350
on epix.
Yeah.

2039
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,180
It's probably come out already yet,
right?

2040
01:28:27,690 --> 01:28:29,370
Didn't it come out like last weekend or 
something?

2041
01:28:29,970 --> 01:28:31,600
It's recent and it's like,
it's.

2042
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:32,970
It's got to be.
What third,

2043
01:28:32,971 --> 01:28:34,940
fourth,
fifth of his nephew.

2044
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:38,170
Do you ever talk to him about sourdough 
bread?

2045
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:39,840
Sourdough bread?
No.

2046
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:41,740
Get lost for hours.
Really?

2047
01:28:41,770 --> 01:28:44,080
He's a sourdough wizard.
He knows all about.

2048
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:46,000
He can make you sourdough bread.
He'll judge your bread.

2049
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:47,840
You can make them some bread as,
hmm.

2050
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:50,410
Good try.
But really what's wrong?

2051
01:28:50,411 --> 01:28:54,490
Yeah.
I feel like I love that quality.

2052
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:56,740
I feel like there's so much that in 
comics,

2053
01:28:56,741 --> 01:28:59,500
it's one of my favorite attributes about
comedians.

2054
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,770
Are you like that?
This guy is a fucking hockey fanatic.

2055
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:01,980
He

2056
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,840
will punch you in the face if you say 
anything.

2057
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,330
You know what I mean?
Like they have their little fanaticism.

2058
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:07,470
Yeah,
for sure.

2059
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,060
Um,
that's,

2060
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:10,230
that's his bread.

2061
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:12,290
Any better than that?
My God.

2062
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:17,150
What am I in France?
Am I in a bakery?

2063
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:20,720
No,
I'm just baking bread.

2064
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:24,570
It's awesome.
So cool.

2065
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:28,520
That looks really good.
That bread looks fucking sensational.

2066
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:30,120
Do.
There was one time I learned,

2067
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:33,450
I went to a French cooking class,
a few,

2068
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:37,230
like six slash seven years ago and I 
learned a very basic,

2069
01:29:37,231 --> 01:29:42,231
but you know,
a little more sophisticated way to make 

2070
01:29:42,231 --> 01:29:42,360
chocolate souffle,
you know,

2071
01:29:42,361 --> 01:29:47,361
like the hot lava where you crack and 
there's a certain way you have to learn 

2072
01:29:47,361 --> 01:29:50,421
the temperature of your oven.
Like the real way it works is to make 

2073
01:29:50,421 --> 01:29:54,501
multiples because it might say $300,
but it cooks it in 17 minutes.

2074
01:29:55,861 --> 01:29:58,200
But at my house,
300 cooks it in 22 minutes.

2075
01:29:58,201 --> 01:29:58,900
Right.
So you,

2076
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:04,150
because because they're actually,
different ovens will actually are 

2077
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:07,140
performing at a different level.
That is not necessarily what it says.

2078
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:12,650
And you know,
you would learn how to mix and seasoned 

2079
01:30:12,650 --> 01:30:12,650
the Ram Ramekins what's the range you 
can error in?

2080
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:13,860
Well,
the thing is,

2081
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:18,180
I think most people would agree that you
want the souffle to have a crack.

2082
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:21,690
You almost want it to be a crumble.
Like it breaks through the top.

2083
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,430
Yeah.
But the middle stays a,

2084
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:29,510
a sort of three quarters type of ooze 
softness,

2085
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:35,270
you know,
so you don't want it to bake fully 

2086
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:35,270
because then you have a cake basically.
Right.

2087
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:36,270
So,
and if you go under the,

2088
01:30:36,310 --> 01:30:37,120
it could be like,
to,

2089
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,690
you went like that.
That kind of down the middle.

2090
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,120
Oh,
I see what you're doing.

2091
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:42,610
Do know,
you know Bert crushers,

2092
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:47,640
gonna hear this podcast.
Who's going to hear this souffle talk 

2093
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:47,640
and he's going to go off like a rocket.
No,

2094
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:48,340
I know what you're doing.
Not at all.

2095
01:30:48,370 --> 01:30:50,050
I can't believe you would use my 
podcasts like that.

2096
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:52,450
I would never do something.
That's what he just did.

2097
01:30:52,451 --> 01:30:53,470
He had never done this before.

2098
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:56,530
You've never had the center.
I want to fucking chocolate souffle now.

2099
01:30:56,690 --> 01:31:01,690
It's incredible.
Do you want vanilla ice cream with 

2100
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:01,690
yours?
Absolutely.

2101
01:31:01,690 --> 01:31:01,990
Have to.
And you have to let your.

2102
01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:05,110
Let your server note.
These things take 20 minutes or more.

2103
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:07,330
Yeah.
They always tell you if a fancy schmancy

2104
01:31:07,331 --> 01:31:07,780
place.
Yeah.

2105
01:31:08,050 --> 01:31:11,560
Like if you go to a heads up if you want
the chocolate souffle.

2106
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:13,330
Yeah.
Let us know now do.

2107
01:31:13,331 --> 01:31:18,331
When I learned that recipe I made about 
30 in two weeks and uh,

2108
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:20,610
yeah,
I think I put on about 30 pounds weeks.

2109
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:23,890
So yeah,
definitely.

2110
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:26,980
Do you now when you try to lose weight 
for this competition?

2111
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:29,890
Yeah.
Do you now look at this like this is the

2112
01:31:29,891 --> 01:31:34,891
new Thompson girl,
I'm just gonna eat healthy and lose all 

2113
01:31:34,891 --> 01:31:38,161
this weight or do you go,
I'm just going to beat Bert Kreischer 

2114
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:39,070
then I'm going to go off like a rocket.
No,

2115
01:31:39,071 --> 01:31:43,360
I feel it becomes a little bit addictive
too.

2116
01:31:43,390 --> 01:31:47,020
When you start seeing some results.
Kinda reminds me of like saving money.

2117
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:52,140
You're addicted to success.
When you save money and you see the 

2118
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:52,270
number go up,
you know like,

2119
01:31:52,271 --> 01:31:54,540
and I'm talking like even when you're 
not making a lot of them,

2120
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:56,170
you go like,
I'm going to save this amount of money.

2121
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,960
Sometimes you'll surpass it and you'll 
be like,

2122
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:00,010
I don't even care about the

2123
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:02,950
thing I thought I was saving money for.
It's fun to see it grow.

2124
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:05,050
That becomes the addiction.
And he's like,

2125
01:32:05,051 --> 01:32:10,051
I just want to see it grow.
So though I think weight loss can be 

2126
01:32:10,051 --> 01:32:10,051
like that.
You go like,

2127
01:32:10,051 --> 01:32:10,780
oh well just,
you know,

2128
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:12,550
try and lose.
But then you see the number go down.

2129
01:32:12,551 --> 01:32:12,880
You're like,
oh,

2130
01:32:12,881 --> 01:32:14,140
I want to keep seeing,
keep going.

2131
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:19,180
That's why when they have those 
helicopter footage views of these 

2132
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:22,950
mansions in the hamptons and they're 
pulling a guy out in handcuffs because 

2133
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:23,470
you stole $500,000,000
from his company,

2134
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:25,960
that's what the fuck that's all about.
That's what that,

2135
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:30,340
that simple human need to collect that 
becomes,

2136
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:35,070
you become some corporate villain that'd
becomes you fucking dig into the oil.

2137
01:32:35,390 --> 01:32:37,870
You know,
in the middle of the ocean and every CEO

2138
01:32:37,871 --> 01:32:39,740
in America.
I mean,

2139
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:42,250
it's a,
it's a natural thing that people do.

2140
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:47,550
Sure.
Was there weight loss ones healthy the 

2141
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:49,030
way last one is a healthy one,
but you bring up a really good point.

2142
01:32:49,050 --> 01:32:54,050
Yeah,
like people do get addicted to success 

2143
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:56,610
and they get addicted to A.
I think it's one of the most important 

2144
01:32:56,610 --> 01:32:59,641
things about people is that you have to 
find what little formula works for your 

2145
01:33:01,121 --> 01:33:06,121
brain.
Everybody's brain is fucking different 

2146
01:33:06,121 --> 01:33:09,031
to tell everybody.
They got to go for it and they got to 

2147
01:33:09,031 --> 01:33:09,031
work out like the rock and they're going
to read a book a day like,

2148
01:33:09,031 --> 01:33:09,580
Hey,
hey,

2149
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:13,420
slow the fuck down.
Everybody doesn't have to do that,

2150
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:15,400
but you gotta find out what it is for 
you,

2151
01:33:15,401 --> 01:33:20,401
and I think for almost everybody,
there should be something that you're 

2152
01:33:20,401 --> 01:33:24,250
pursuing that you can get better at.
Meaning it could be art,

2153
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:27,490
it could be like you're really in a 
painting sculpture.

2154
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:32,700
It could be a physical thing like maybe 
a yoga thing or a martial arts thing or 

2155
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:34,840
fill in the blank with a hundred 
archery,

2156
01:33:34,841 --> 01:33:39,841
a hundred different things that you 
could chess that you could really get 

2157
01:33:39,841 --> 01:33:39,841
into it.
Sure.

2158
01:33:39,841 --> 01:33:43,560
But I think when people work towards 
something and then continue to do 

2159
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:44,050
something and try to improve and it 
even.

2160
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:49,051
It's just your recreational tennis game.
I think those things bring people 

2161
01:33:49,051 --> 01:33:52,951
happiness because I think people have a 
certain amount of built in desire to 

2162
01:33:52,951 --> 01:33:54,580
overcome adversity,
overcome problems,

2163
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:57,070
and we don't get enough of it in real 
life.

2164
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:57,760
Oh,
right.

2165
01:33:57,790 --> 01:34:02,790
Right.
So then you get something like a weight 

2166
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:02,790
loss challenge.
Yeah.

2167
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:04,090
Anything like that where you have a 
difficult struggle,

2168
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:07,720
like you have an accomplishment to that 
you're working towards.

2169
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:12,990
It gives people that sense of meaning,
which ultimately that's the real 

2170
01:34:12,990 --> 01:34:13,330
problem,
right?

2171
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:18,360
With a lot of peoples that they don't,
they don't enjoy their life and so then 

2172
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:19,090
they start thinking about like,
what is the purpose of this?

2173
01:34:19,090 --> 01:34:24,090
Then because it just keep being 
uncomfortable and not happy until you're

2174
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:26,340
heart stops beating.
Yeah.

2175
01:34:26,341 --> 01:34:29,290
That's a miserable way to live.
It's a lot of people live like that.

2176
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,930
That's why by the way,
is by my point for this too,

2177
01:34:31,931 --> 01:34:36,070
is that I think it's a great endorsement
of fat shaming because this is a healthy

2178
01:34:36,071 --> 01:34:39,190
result where you have two guys 
ultimately.

2179
01:34:39,191 --> 01:34:40,360
Look,
it doesn't even matter.

2180
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:42,670
We both.
We both fat,

2181
01:34:42,671 --> 01:34:46,600
shamed and insulted each other,
and then so did a lot of people.

2182
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:46,960
Right.
Well,

2183
01:34:46,961 --> 01:34:51,961
you can get away with it because you're 
a fat guy of Jamie started fat shaming 

2184
01:34:51,961 --> 01:34:51,961
you.
We'd have a real issue.

2185
01:34:51,961 --> 01:34:52,110
I don't know,
man.

2186
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:53,560
Jamie skinny.
He runs a lot,

2187
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:57,980
but that's what I'm saying is that if we
benefited it low fat.

2188
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:58,880
Yeah,
I know he's.

2189
01:34:58,881 --> 01:34:59,930
He's fine.
No,

2190
01:34:59,931 --> 01:35:01,070
no,
you did definitely,

2191
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:03,560
but you guys are all both professional 
comedians.

2192
01:35:03,561 --> 01:35:07,180
Like here's a perfect example.
What about a guy who's like a chef who's

2193
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:12,190
just some fucking bomb ass chef and he's
a master chef and he keeps creating all 

2194
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:16,361
these new dishes,
but he's a fat fuck and he eats like a 

2195
01:35:16,361 --> 01:35:16,610
pig and he drinks wine every night.
Like Gerard Depardieu.

2196
01:35:16,970 --> 01:35:17,600
Well,
look,

2197
01:35:17,601 --> 01:35:19,130
if that guy loves that,
you're right.

2198
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:20,690
I'm not.
I'm not encouraging.

2199
01:35:20,691 --> 01:35:25,691
I'm not saying you should go with that 
shame everybody I'm saying what I'm 

2200
01:35:25,691 --> 01:35:28,541
saying is that there is an outcome in in
the in which it can be effective and not

2201
01:35:29,691 --> 01:35:30,980
negative.
I'm not saying,

2202
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,970
hey,
anybody who's fat usually fucking fat.

2203
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:38,360
I'm just saying that in this scenario,
in the outcome could be that like it 

2204
01:35:38,721 --> 01:35:43,721
ends,
let's say it ended today and we are 

2205
01:35:43,721 --> 01:35:43,721
where we are.

2206
01:35:43,721 --> 01:35:46,810
Both of us just actually ended up eating
healthier and working out for a month 

2207
01:35:46,810 --> 01:35:49,100
and you know what I mean?
And we weigh less than we were healthier

2208
01:35:49,101 --> 01:35:54,101
than we were a month ago.
Well I think different people have 

2209
01:35:54,101 --> 01:35:55,910
different abilities of tolerating jokes 
pointed at them.

2210
01:35:56,120 --> 01:36:01,120
There a different aspect like,
well you could say something to me and 

2211
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:01,520
it probably has a different effect.
That's totally.

2212
01:36:01,630 --> 01:36:06,630
Maybe someone who doesn't do comedy or 
maybe someone who's not used to someone 

2213
01:36:06,630 --> 01:36:06,880
joking around with them.
I think that's,

2214
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:11,910
that's a factor too.
I don't think you should emotionally 

2215
01:36:11,910 --> 01:36:11,910
traumatized if that person.
I,

2216
01:36:11,910 --> 01:36:15,700
I hope I didn't sound like it was trying
to say that for some people it takes 

2217
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:18,980
being called fat to like get them off 
their ass like some people.

2218
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:20,590
My point is that I,
I,

2219
01:36:21,090 --> 01:36:25,010
I feel like I should say that with me it
worked and with some people.

2220
01:36:25,010 --> 01:36:25,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

2221
01:36:25,551 --> 01:36:26,870
I mean in a,
in a healthy way.

2222
01:36:26,871 --> 01:36:29,900
I never took it to like really,
I don't know,

2223
01:36:29,990 --> 01:36:33,230
it didn't affect me.
It affected me in a motivating way.

2224
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:38,290
Well,
you and I have had a ton of 

2225
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:39,701
conversations over the years about a 
health and fitness and weight loss and 

2226
01:36:39,701 --> 01:36:42,200
stuff like that.
So if you wanted to do something,

2227
01:36:42,201 --> 01:36:43,680
I always felt like,
you know,

2228
01:36:43,690 --> 01:36:45,710
you would definitely do something and 
you always worked out.

2229
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:46,540
Yeah.
You know,

2230
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:48,650
but yeah,
it just became,

2231
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:53,870
you know,
it became something that I want to do 

2232
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:54,590
just channeled through this other thing.
That's ultimately what it was.

2233
01:36:55,050 --> 01:36:56,510
You know,
I've told this story before,

2234
01:36:56,511 --> 01:37:01,511
but when Kevin James was losing weight,
his manager at the time we got rid of 

2235
01:37:01,511 --> 01:37:03,470
was telling him that if he loses weight,
he loses roles.

2236
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:06,260
Yeah.
Who's telling them to not be healthy?

2237
01:37:06,261 --> 01:37:06,860
Because you won't.

2238
01:37:06,890 --> 01:37:09,410
You won't get as much work.
I had Amanda told me,

2239
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:11,300
God damn crazy to the manager telling 
me,

2240
01:37:11,301 --> 01:37:12,440
don't,
don't lose the weight.

2241
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:13,550
Oh,
Jesus.

2242
01:37:13,551 --> 01:37:14,990
It's the same thing.
Like how that,

2243
01:37:15,110 --> 01:37:18,140
what the fuck kind of advice is that?
It's so crazy.

2244
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,990
Don't,
don't be better as a person.

2245
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,460
Just fuck up your comment.
They were thinking of casting.

2246
01:37:22,461 --> 01:37:23,100
They were like,
oh,

2247
01:37:23,110 --> 01:37:25,130
there's this many roles so you could get
one.

2248
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:30,520
I wonder if they would approach it 
differently now because now like a 

2249
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:31,710
casting and it's always going to be good
to be on a set of chrome,

2250
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:33,140
so he's going to be good to be in a 
movie.

2251
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:38,120
But if you're someone like you who has a
successful podcast and then does netflix

2252
01:37:38,121 --> 01:37:41,660
specials,
I'll take that over all those things all

2253
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:43,400
day.
It's a good life.

2254
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:45,980
It's the best life.
You're creating your own shit.

2255
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:49,010
You're doing your own thing,
you're doing it when you want and you're

2256
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:50,900
being very prolific.
You're having fun.

2257
01:37:50,901 --> 01:37:52,430
Um,
you've done two specials in what?

2258
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:53,900
Two and a half years?
Yeah.

2259
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:56,100
That's pretty fucking bad ass.
You did

2260
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,410
one and then he did another one was like
a year and a half later,

2261
01:37:58,411 --> 01:38:01,470
somewhere in that range,
but a 16 and 18 months later.

2262
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:04,660
A man that's fucking giant.
Yeah.

2263
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:05,940
I'm working on another one.
Yeah,

2264
01:38:06,170 --> 01:38:11,170
but see no interference man.
I know you don't have some crazy 

2265
01:38:12,061 --> 01:38:14,430
executives that want to change the 
direction of the show.

2266
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:17,070
That's a whole world that I've learned.
It's really weird.

2267
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:18,870
Like just from writing.
Yeah,

2268
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,910
like having good script deals.
Yeah.

2269
01:38:21,050 --> 01:38:24,560
A lot of people get involved at first 
they don't first there's nothing.

2270
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:27,750
It's just like you and an idea and they 
have conversations with that.

2271
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:32,800
You just want to go,
why didn't you just say I had one one 

2272
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,201
time where we had this conversation with
an executive who said like,

2273
01:38:36,900 --> 01:38:40,140
we kinda want shows like,
and I'll just make it up,

2274
01:38:40,141 --> 01:38:42,390
right?
Like let's say like an HBO show,

2275
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:43,040
it's not what this.

2276
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:44,580
And you go like,
okay.

2277
01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:46,830
And that was just one of the things they
said.

2278
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:52,400
And then on the first notes path,
which is like they read your first 

2279
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:56,001
draft.
The first thing that the same executive 

2280
01:38:56,001 --> 01:38:56,220
said was just kind of feels like an hbo 
show.

2281
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:57,680
I don't really want it.
We were like,

2282
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:00,840
what?
That's what you said.

2283
01:39:00,841 --> 01:39:01,530
And they're like,
no,

2284
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:03,020
it's too much like that.
Oh my God,

2285
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,080
I guess.
So that kind of,

2286
01:39:05,130 --> 01:39:06,840
that's the kind of shit you can deal 
with on a,

2287
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,050
on a writing deal.
You're like,

2288
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:10,580
I don't know where to go from that.
The will.

2289
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:13,290
Those deals are so odd.
Um,

2290
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:15,640
you've worked with writers and sometimes
you know,

2291
01:39:15,641 --> 01:39:17,610
like you don't know a person,
you sit down with them,

2292
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:20,430
start trying to write a script with them
and just gets really strange.

2293
01:39:20,431 --> 01:39:21,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

2294
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,430
But when the,
when the execs come in is when it really

2295
01:39:23,431 --> 01:39:24,660
gets straightened out.

2296
01:39:24,900 --> 01:39:29,900
They have their own wacky ideas.
I pitched a show once and the guy was 

2297
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:31,950
pitching it without a panic attack.
He had a panic attack.

2298
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:35,280
Think the pitch meeting where he held it
together,

2299
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:38,160
but he had kind of a history.
He's a really nice guy,

2300
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:41,520
very smart guy too.
He's real good writer.

2301
01:39:42,330 --> 01:39:47,330
Very funny guy.
Used to be comic and then the middle of 

2302
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:47,910
this meeting he just locked up,
see it,

2303
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:50,190
you know,
just have really struggled to try to get

2304
01:39:50,191 --> 01:39:53,700
through the pitch in.
I couldn't jump in.

2305
01:39:53,730 --> 01:39:55,350
I mean if I jumped I didn't know what to
do.

2306
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:57,030
Pitches are so funny.
Man.

2307
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:59,610
Pitches are like for people that 
haven't,

2308
01:39:59,850 --> 01:40:03,330
who haven't done it or don't like 
pitching a show in my,

2309
01:40:03,450 --> 01:40:08,450
in my estimation and in my experience is
a lot like a blind date first,

2310
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:15,050
like the first five minutes because 
that's how like a pitch fields because 

2311
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:15,050
they'll be like,
hey you're,

2312
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:15,990
I'm supposed to meet you too,
right?

2313
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:16,470
And you're like,
yeah,

2314
01:40:16,471 --> 01:40:17,400
yeah,
2:00.

2315
01:40:17,730 --> 01:40:19,110
And then they're like,
what's going on?

2316
01:40:19,530 --> 01:40:20,820
And then the,
the,

2317
01:40:20,910 --> 01:40:23,340
the usually the popular thing,
especially for comedy,

2318
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:28,460
is there like first just be yourself and
just make it funny and you make a 

2319
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:28,860
decision.
Like you're like,

2320
01:40:28,861 --> 01:40:32,010
I'm a joke about this and you like 
sometimes you get on a roll,

2321
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:36,360
like people aren't jelling like this is,
it's funny natural conversation,

2322
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:39,780
but sometimes it's like an awkward first
date where you're like yeah,

2323
01:40:39,781 --> 01:40:42,480
you like Moose and the person's like,
what?

2324
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:46,110
And then you kind of feel it being 
awkward and they start to be like,

2325
01:40:46,410 --> 01:40:47,810
I don't know if this is a great date,
you know?

2326
01:40:48,240 --> 01:40:49,500
And then they're like,
at that point,

2327
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:51,450
like I don't know if I would go on a 
second date with you.

2328
01:40:51,451 --> 01:40:53,620
It was like the field they go,
so what's the idea?

2329
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:57,390
And you're already feeling like shit,
this isn't a good citizen,

2330
01:40:57,430 --> 01:41:02,430
a good date to begin with.
And then you start trying to throw out 

2331
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:04,000
an idea like well you'll like this even 
though I don't think you like me,

2332
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:09,570
you know?
And then you kind of either like either 

2333
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:09,570
rolls down that hill where you're like,
you leave the room.

2334
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:09,940
Like that was awkward.

2335
01:41:09,990 --> 01:41:14,990
Right.
Which is still one step removed from an 

2336
01:41:14,990 --> 01:41:15,500
audition though.
Additions the worst that is.

2337
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:16,240
Yeah,
that is,

2338
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:18,280
that is definitely the worst.
They also,

2339
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:23,281
you feel like sometimes you walk in the 
room in an audition and you feel like 

2340
01:41:23,281 --> 01:41:25,390
the casting director or person made the 
decision,

2341
01:41:25,391 --> 01:41:30,391
all right.
As you walk in the room you ever had 

2342
01:41:30,391 --> 01:41:30,391
that where like you walk in and you're 
like,

2343
01:41:30,391 --> 01:41:31,570
this person is definitely a no,
you have to keep going.

2344
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:36,600
You gotta keep going.
I had to go check emails once during an 

2345
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:36,600
audition.
I was like,

2346
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:39,490
uh.
Then another time I improvise a line and

2347
01:41:39,491 --> 01:41:41,800
the guy laughed and he goes,
that was rude,

2348
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:43,620
and I was like,
what was.

2349
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:45,070
He goes,
stick to the script.

2350
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:46,510
I'm like,
Oh man,

2351
01:41:48,190 --> 01:41:50,050
punch to the fucking gut like that.

2352
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:52,260
So

2353
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:54,270
have you had a bad pitch?

2354
01:41:54,870 --> 01:41:59,870
Yes.
Well that was a bad pitch where the guy 

2355
01:41:59,870 --> 01:41:59,870
had a panic attack.
That was the end of that.

2356
01:41:59,870 --> 01:42:00,470
I tried to pitch that like where you're 
like,

2357
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:01,410
and you're like,
this is going

2358
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,810
terrible right now.
I pitched the show to do,

2359
01:42:03,811 --> 01:42:08,811
laughed make.
He thought it was joking when I was 

2360
01:42:08,811 --> 01:42:10,401
totally serious.
It was about a bunch of girls who work 

2361
01:42:10,401 --> 01:42:14,421
at a bikini pizza place during the day 
and at night they fight crime and it's 

2362
01:42:14,421 --> 01:42:17,630
called pizza slots.
Yeah.

2363
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,950
They work at a place called pizza.
He's like,

2364
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,020
all right,
what's the deal?

2365
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:22,410
Bitch?
I wanted to do.

2366
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:24,750
I was just a.
It was a stone idea I had,

2367
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:30,080
but the idea was to do like like a super
over the top ridiculous,

2368
01:42:31,801 --> 01:42:35,430
like Charlie's angels type thing.
What's some girls that worked at a pizza

2369
01:42:35,431 --> 01:42:36,020
place?
Yeah.

2370
01:42:36,630 --> 01:42:40,290
That was the cover for this,
like secret crime fighting organization.

2371
01:42:40,291 --> 01:42:42,970
It was so stupid,
like I didn't have ideas for scripts and

2372
01:42:42,990 --> 01:42:44,220
have anything.
Let's see.

2373
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:49,260
I,
I think I would at least be smiling if 

2374
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:49,260
that was the pitch.
He laughed.

2375
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:50,040
He was like,

2376
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:52,810
do that shit.
You received my mayor sizzle.

2377
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:57,870
You saw that where I play.
I'm basically like a Rob Ford type 

2378
01:42:57,870 --> 01:42:57,880
character.
Oh yeah.

2379
01:42:58,060 --> 01:43:00,580
I did see that play that we shot.
We shot that,

2380
01:43:00,790 --> 01:43:05,790
you know,
a couple of years ago and we pitched it 

2381
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:05,830
to a lot like we sent them that or we 
bring it with us.

2382
01:43:05,850 --> 01:43:07,990
Right.
There's some people that laugh and like,

2383
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:11,400
it's like I said,
it's like meeting a new person and there

2384
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:13,960
was one guy who were like,
so um,

2385
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:15,820
did you see the sizzle?
And he goes,

2386
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:18,340
yeah.
He's like,

2387
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:23,520
what else is there?
Like that kind of where he was just 

2388
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:23,520
like,
shuts it down.

2389
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:24,550
Oh yeah,
man.

2390
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:25,900
Yeah.
Let me hear this.

2391
01:43:26,070 --> 01:43:28,080
Harry Pryor.
Mr Mayor.

2392
01:43:31,230 --> 01:43:36,230
Mr Mayor.
This is Stan Ramsey from the budget 

2393
01:43:36,230 --> 01:43:38,451
office.
We're using stand for some healthcare 

2394
01:43:38,451 --> 01:43:39,060
PSA.
He was recently diagnosed with cancer.

2395
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:40,080
God,
I'm sorry,

2396
01:43:40,081 --> 01:43:41,630
Stan,
what kind long?

2397
01:43:42,150 --> 01:43:47,150
I don't even smoke.
One of the doctors say they gave me six 

2398
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:47,560
months,
you know something?

2399
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:52,010
My aunt had lung cancer and they gave 
her that same prognosis and that

2400
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,850
was 14 years ago.
Really?

2401
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:55,420
She remain cancer free.
Oh,

2402
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:57,310
she died 13 and a half years ago.
Why?

2403
01:43:57,380 --> 01:44:02,380
Why are you telling me this?
Because it was like six months to the 

2404
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:02,380
day.
I mean,

2405
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:03,110
these doctors,
they know their shit.

2406
01:44:03,490 --> 01:44:04,550
It's great meeting you,
Stan.

2407
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:09,590
Hey.
And definitely swing by before

2408
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:13,690
April.
We can set that up through my office.

2409
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:18,900
What we decided to do,
like a Rob Ford character.

2410
01:44:19,450 --> 01:44:21,100
Yeah,
I mean like it wasn't pitch that way,

2411
01:44:21,101 --> 01:44:26,101
but as you know,
you can tell that was obviously the 

2412
01:44:26,101 --> 01:44:27,781
influence.
Would you like to ramp it up and start 

2413
01:44:27,781 --> 01:44:27,781
with Coke Dude,
like Rob Ford?

2414
01:44:27,781 --> 01:44:31,981
The thing that was so interesting about 
him was they had video of him smoking 

2415
01:44:31,981 --> 01:44:31,981
crack that this,
this leads down.

2416
01:44:31,981 --> 01:44:32,380
Oh,
he keeps going.

2417
01:44:32,650 --> 01:44:34,580
Black Dick for crack.
Oh Jesus.

2418
01:44:34,750 --> 01:44:37,210
Talking about black tech accused of it 
and he's like,

2419
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:37,830
oh,
second.

2420
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:41,350
I don't think so.
But it was um,

2421
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:44,270
you know,
it was a written by Tom Rubric.

2422
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:49,380
It was a really funny.
He was a letterman writer for years and 

2423
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:52,710
years and years.
Really funny guy and I just played the 

2424
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:53,210
role,
but pitching that was like a,

2425
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:57,070
was a rollercoaster because we had so 
many good people like involved in it,

2426
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:57,440
you know?

2427
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:58,590
And I was like,
oh,

2428
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:00,430
and then when you.
And then the pitch,

2429
01:45:00,970 --> 01:45:03,100
I just can't help it.
I know I'm repeating it,

2430
01:45:03,101 --> 01:45:05,440
but it's like a blind date.
It was like people would be like,

2431
01:45:05,470 --> 01:45:07,150
oh my God,
that's fucking awesome.

2432
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:08,920
And then they'd be like,
I hate you.

2433
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:13,240
Think in the position you're going to an
executive and you're saying,

2434
01:45:13,241 --> 01:45:14,200
hey,
spend money,

2435
01:45:14,230 --> 01:45:15,130
spend money,
spend money.

2436
01:45:15,131 --> 01:45:16,140
I want to make a hit.
Yeah,

2437
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:17,740
well what's your idea?
And then you know,

2438
01:45:17,950 --> 01:45:20,440
a bunch of girls in their bikinis and 
they get the fuck out.

2439
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:22,110
Get out of here.
Yeah,

2440
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:23,980
that's stupid.
Stupid idea.

2441
01:45:23,981 --> 01:45:27,790
I'm glad they said no,
but every now and then someone will come

2442
01:45:27,791 --> 01:45:30,280
in their office and something clicks and
they decide,

2443
01:45:30,310 --> 01:45:32,890
oh,
let's take a chance and take a chance on

2444
01:45:32,891 --> 01:45:35,110
10 things and only one of them works.
I mean,

2445
01:45:35,111 --> 01:45:40,111
how many shoulders get fucking cancel 
and it costs a shit load of money to 

2446
01:45:40,111 --> 01:45:40,450
make happens all the time through.

2447
01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:45,850
Do you remember that show with the dude 
from er?

2448
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:49,150
What's his name?
John Noah.

2449
01:45:49,210 --> 01:45:50,180
Noah Wiley.
Memory.

2450
01:45:50,181 --> 01:45:54,790
He had a show like an alien show.
It was just crazy.

2451
01:45:54,791 --> 01:45:59,791
Special effects.
Alien invasion show and the hype the 

2452
01:45:59,791 --> 01:46:00,520
shit out of it and spend all this money 
on it.

2453
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:04,060
If you're on a hit show,
you get so many more chances after that.

2454
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:06,070
Oh yeah,
you keep putting you in.

2455
01:46:06,071 --> 01:46:06,580
Shit,
man.

2456
01:46:06,730 --> 01:46:08,680
There it is.
Falling skies.

2457
01:46:09,310 --> 01:46:11,050
It's kind of funny looking.
Really?

2458
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:12,630
Yeah.
I mean like the.

2459
01:46:12,810 --> 01:46:15,700
The creatures were bad ass looking.
They're bizarre,

2460
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:18,220
but as a weird show,
it's like,

2461
01:46:18,221 --> 01:46:19,720
what is going?
What is this?

2462
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:22,600
Yeah,
like these creatures.

2463
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:27,960
Is there a hanging out?
Like once you're hanging out with 

2464
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:27,960
aliens,
God damn,

2465
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:31,441
that's hard to pull off.
You can turn your back to a lizard 

2466
01:46:31,441 --> 01:46:32,140
person like you're not freaking out by 
the fact that.

2467
01:46:32,141 --> 01:46:34,360
Thanks for another Goddamn planet behind
you.

2468
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:39,600
You could look to the skies.
I would never let one of those fuckers 

2469
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:39,600
behind me.
Everywhere I'd walk,

2470
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:40,510
I'd have my back to the wall.
Well,

2471
01:46:40,511 --> 01:46:43,480
it's every instinct had to be the kill.
Of course.

2472
01:46:43,510 --> 01:46:45,730
Dude.
You see that picture or the animated Gif

2473
01:46:45,731 --> 01:46:50,160
file that I put up on my instagram.
Which one of the owl

2474
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:52,290
swooping in and Jack and this other 
bird.

2475
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:57,320
No,
I think it's a hawk at Jack's too or 

2476
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:57,320
some.
It looks like someone I did watch.

2477
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:59,220
It was your tree cutting thing.
Holy Shit.

2478
01:46:59,221 --> 01:47:00,720
Is that district fuck?
Is that thing?

2479
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:02,430
See that machine?
Yeah.

2480
01:47:02,520 --> 01:47:07,520
I've seen those before,
but that one seemed blood just picks up 

2481
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:09,960
efficiently or just cuts them in half 
strips.

2482
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:13,560
The look of that saws in half,
lifts it up in the air,

2483
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:17,580
buzzes through all the bark as it's 
holding it.

2484
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:19,290
Again,
buzzes through the bark.

2485
01:47:19,291 --> 01:47:21,630
Totally strips the bark off.
I mean that's crazy.

2486
01:47:21,890 --> 01:47:23,610
Trips all the branches off.
Cuts it.

2487
01:47:24,890 --> 01:47:29,890
It's incredible lamp.
It's not dune manning that.

2488
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,800
It's nuts.
Fucking wild.

2489
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:37,160
Yeah.
It's so disturbing when you see the 

2490
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:37,160
brutal,
brutal efficiency of it.

2491
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:39,600
Look how it just saw us through it and 
all those wheels and gears on it.

2492
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,530
Really incredible,
man.

2493
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:42,710
Unreal.
Yeah,

2494
01:47:43,810 --> 01:47:45,870
but anyway,
that's not shit.

2495
01:47:45,960 --> 01:47:50,960
Compared to the owl.
The owl swoops down and jacks this bird.

2496
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:56,240
I don't know what kind of.
But actually looks like a pigeon more 

2497
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:56,240
than it was like a hawk.
Right?

2498
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:59,750
What does that look like?
That birds will be the eyes and the 

2499
01:47:59,750 --> 01:47:59,750
distance.
The see the eyes.

2500
01:47:59,750 --> 01:47:59,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

2501
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:02,670
Watch this mother fucker.
Whoa.

2502
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:08,120
Yeah.
Other bird doesn't even know what 

2503
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:08,120
happened.
I was like,

2504
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:08,120
Hey,
so you look at his face.

2505
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:08,280
That looks like a raptor,
doesn't it?

2506
01:48:08,370 --> 01:48:09,010
Yeah.
I mean,

2507
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:10,650
it has a beak on it though,
right?

2508
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:15,950
I think that's some kind of a raptor and
a distance that's to mood and it sees 

2509
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:20,370
them and they don't see ya later and 
they don't just grab you.

2510
01:48:20,371 --> 01:48:23,100
They kick you.
I guess it closes in.

2511
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:26,400
Watch it one more time when we're like 
say this now.

2512
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:29,280
Those eyes look,
he's just fucking swooping in with those

2513
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:30,600
eyes are so creepy.

2514
01:48:30,630 --> 01:48:31,860
Awesome.
To watch animals do it,

2515
01:48:31,890 --> 01:48:35,910
but watch how he kicks him.
Pitch like it's not just a grab,

2516
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:40,940
it's a stun like it kicks them and then 
sinks the clause at man and they.

2517
01:48:41,401 --> 01:48:44,670
Have you ever seen an towns the other.
They're incredible.

2518
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:47,580
They're enormous.
That other bird turned its head was like

2519
01:48:47,581 --> 01:48:52,581
you say something like that.
Why is it that we take these ruthless 

2520
01:48:52,581 --> 01:48:56,840
fascinating birds of prey,
these predators in nature and we make 

2521
01:48:58,171 --> 01:49:00,450
them out to be these like lovely 
sweetheart.

2522
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:05,890
Like ours.
There's nothing funnier than Matt 

2523
01:49:05,890 --> 01:49:06,930
Bronner's bit about als is a bit about 
that.

2524
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:10,170
That is hilarious.
So fucking ruthless.

2525
01:49:10,171 --> 01:49:13,650
Owls are how savage they are,
and then he hit me and I'm paraphrasing.

2526
01:49:13,651 --> 01:49:15,780
It's an older bit of his,
but it's when people are like,

2527
01:49:15,781 --> 01:49:16,370
oh,
they're still good.

2528
01:49:16,371 --> 01:49:18,880
I think it will rip your fucking face 
off like it.

2529
01:49:18,890 --> 01:49:21,600
He has a really,
really well written bit about it.

2530
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:23,370
But look at that.
Jesus.

2531
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:24,900
People try to make them cute.
They're like,

2532
01:49:24,901 --> 01:49:25,800
oh,
they're adorable.

2533
01:49:25,830 --> 01:49:27,210
They're amazing.
Yeah.

2534
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:31,630
They're night predators.
Night flying predators with giant eyes.

2535
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:33,540
Eyes too,
man.

2536
01:49:33,690 --> 01:49:34,590
Yeah,
we were at,

2537
01:49:34,591 --> 01:49:36,510
um,
there's a rescue place that we go to.

2538
01:49:36,511 --> 01:49:38,340
Sometimes they,
uh,

2539
01:49:38,670 --> 01:49:42,960
they take care of wildlife and 
rehabilitate them and they have this one

2540
01:49:42,961 --> 01:49:44,220
hour.
Well that was blind.

2541
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:46,500
It pretty much blind.
It couldn't fly.

2542
01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:49,330
It would perch and it was a really small
owl.

2543
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:52,780
And you sit there and look at this.
Then I think it's an s Omar.

2544
01:49:52,781 --> 01:49:54,460
I think the places,
I forget where it's at,

2545
01:49:54,530 --> 01:49:56,020
it's,
it's in the 808,

2546
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,660
but it's got this little,
um,

2547
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:01,690
this little owl and you're looking in 
his fucking eyes,

2548
01:50:01,691 --> 01:50:02,230
man.
And you're like,

2549
01:50:02,231 --> 01:50:07,231
what a strange creature.
And his eyes look almost like cracked 

2550
01:50:07,231 --> 01:50:10,800
because it was blind.
Like it looks like you're looking 

2551
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:10,800
through a crack television glass that's 
bold.

2552
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:11,560
Yeah.
He's old.

2553
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:13,810
He's older.
Maybe something happened to his eyes to.

2554
01:50:13,811 --> 01:50:15,160
It might've been an injury or something 
like that.

2555
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:17,410
You know,
sometimes birds were flying to windows.

2556
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:18,640
That has a lot.

2557
01:50:18,650 --> 01:50:19,260
We have,
um,

2558
01:50:19,290 --> 01:50:22,010
the outline of one on a window.
Oh,

2559
01:50:22,011 --> 01:50:23,690
Jesus.
Look at those eyes.

2560
01:50:24,510 --> 01:50:27,630
Is that,
that one bird blind out?

2561
01:50:27,631 --> 01:50:28,020
Yeah.
Like,

2562
01:50:28,021 --> 01:50:29,920
look at his eyes,
look like they're cracked inside.

2563
01:50:29,921 --> 01:50:31,600
And like there's something wrong.
Something missing.

2564
01:50:31,601 --> 01:50:36,601
Like he's looking at the universe.
That guy looks like a portal to the 

2565
01:50:36,601 --> 01:50:36,601
heavens.
Look at his right eye.

2566
01:50:36,601 --> 01:50:38,250
It's like a constellation map or his 
left eye.

2567
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:41,910
It's true.
The left eye is a constellation of storm

2568
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:46,940
thought.
Even a reflection of something that 

2569
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:46,940
looks like that.
That's what it looks like in that I.

2570
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:48,900
well,
it's just such a bizarre animal.

2571
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:51,380
Like if that didn't exist,
like if,

2572
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:53,850
if there was no owls and then they just 
found one,

2573
01:50:54,300 --> 01:50:55,590
you'd be obsessed.
You'd be like,

2574
01:50:55,591 --> 01:50:57,330
Holy Shit.
Have you seen that new animal?

2575
01:50:57,331 --> 01:50:58,410
They discovered?
Yeah.

2576
01:50:58,411 --> 01:51:00,510
It's called an owl.
They're calling in an owl dude.

2577
01:51:00,511 --> 01:51:05,511
It's this giant flying thing with huge 
talents and it only hunts at night and 

2578
01:51:06,631 --> 01:51:07,740
it's smart as fuck.

2579
01:51:08,230 --> 01:51:13,230
MMM.
They just swooped down and Jack 

2580
01:51:13,230 --> 01:51:13,230
everything.
Yeah.

2581
01:51:13,230 --> 01:51:13,340
That's,
that's a.

2582
01:51:13,820 --> 01:51:14,820
that's an incredible predator.

2583
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,830
Well,
it's really interesting that the balance

2584
01:51:17,831 --> 01:51:22,831
of those things other than when people 
get infected or involved rather with a 

2585
01:51:22,831 --> 01:51:25,210
balance of those things is like how many
of them exist.

2586
01:51:25,450 --> 01:51:28,420
It's all dependent upon how much there 
is for them to eat.

2587
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:30,250
Right.
That's like more rabbits.

2588
01:51:30,251 --> 01:51:32,350
There are.
The more rats there are,

2589
01:51:32,570 --> 01:51:34,510
the more the hours will thrive.
The mortal.

2590
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:37,660
It's you.
If you didn't have those things,

2591
01:51:37,661 --> 01:51:40,000
like people are always in La.
They're always worried about coyotes.

2592
01:51:40,030 --> 01:51:41,680
Oh Man.
Fucking coyotes.

2593
01:51:41,681 --> 01:51:46,681
It's bullshit.
We got to get these coyotes out of our 

2594
01:51:46,681 --> 01:51:46,681
neighborhood.
Oh,

2595
01:51:46,681 --> 01:51:46,681
do you like rats?
Yeah.

2596
01:51:46,681 --> 01:51:46,790
Do you like rats?
No.

2597
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:47,740
No,
I don't like rats.

2598
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:49,570
Rats.
Get to your fucking house.

2599
01:51:49,571 --> 01:51:50,650
Coyotes.
Yeah.

2600
01:51:50,850 --> 01:51:54,400
My Cat a.
don't put your cat outside.

2601
01:51:54,650 --> 01:51:57,440
Fucking mittens doesn't know what the.
What the Hell it God.

2602
01:51:57,441 --> 01:51:58,780
Damn Coyote is right.
Right

2603
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:00,110
now.
It's there.

2604
01:52:00,150 --> 01:52:02,010
Yeah.
People flip out about that need.

2605
01:52:02,011 --> 01:52:05,820
Coyotes.
I seen a fucking coyote jogging down,

2606
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:10,230
trotting down fountain with that dog and
its mouth before at night,

2607
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,190
late,
late at night,

2608
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:13,580
it's dark.
And then I saw a,

2609
01:52:13,581 --> 01:52:18,581
um,
a pack of them came to an apartment 

2610
01:52:18,581 --> 01:52:22,560
building I lived at once.
And you heard weird squeaking,

2611
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:27,680
like screeching.
At first I thought it was an animal was 

2612
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:27,680
hurt.
Where were you?

2613
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:29,730
I was in Silverlake,
Holy Shit.

2614
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:30,800
And I was like,
man,

2615
01:52:30,801 --> 01:52:32,580
what is that?
Sounds like a dog's crying.

2616
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:36,210
And I opened the door and the door that 
was near the street,

2617
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:39,090
the apartment there had a glass door 
open,

2618
01:52:39,091 --> 01:52:43,170
but a screen door and there was,
they had a bigger dog and then there was

2619
01:52:43,171 --> 01:52:46,100
like six coyotes trying to get that

2620
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:50,000
dog and they were making this shreddable
crying noise.

2621
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:52,450
Shit.
We will fucking fixated.

2622
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:53,780
Like,
oh my God.

2623
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:58,840
Like I first said it.
I thought they're going to fucking run 

2624
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:00,581
through that door manager if they got 
through and just made a blood bath out 

2625
01:53:00,581 --> 01:53:00,730
of the hallway.
He came down.

2626
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:04,250
He found this coyotes now kill as a 
pitch.

2627
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:05,780
I'm already in on this one.
Okay.

2628
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,910
I'm going to pitch this.
If I can.

2629
01:53:07,911 --> 01:53:12,911
Six coyotes.
See a dog break in and make a bloodbath 

2630
01:53:12,911 --> 01:53:14,300
of an entire family.
Jesus.

2631
01:53:14,330 --> 01:53:16,490
Halloween,
2017 coyotes.

2632
01:53:16,491 --> 01:53:18,380
Wild coyotes.
Just start killing people.

2633
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:20,540
Why not?
I don't like it.

2634
01:53:20,610 --> 01:53:21,880
It makes me uncomfortable.
All right,

2635
01:53:21,950 --> 01:53:23,330
then.
Don't fucking buy it.

2636
01:53:23,331 --> 01:53:24,620
I just tried to sell.
All right dude.

2637
01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:25,640
All right.
Jesus Christ.

2638
01:53:25,641 --> 01:53:26,330
Let's go.
Okay.

2639
01:53:26,331 --> 01:53:29,000
We all have different tastes.
I'm not into that.

2640
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:31,160
They knew it was into it.
Do you know the coyotes or wolves?

2641
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:32,720
No.
Yeah,

2642
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:35,000
they're wolves.
They're uh,

2643
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:38,270
they used to call them prairie wolves.
That's why they can breed with bowls.

2644
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:39,240
Like they,
uh,

2645
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:40,970
they,
they have that thing called a Coi Wolf.

2646
01:53:40,971 --> 01:53:44,000
That's like a hybrid between a coyote 
and a wolf.

2647
01:53:44,510 --> 01:53:49,510
The,
it's not just a hybrid between a coyote 

2648
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:49,510
and a wolf.
There's actually a lot of them.

2649
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:51,500
Now there's like the percentage of 
hybrid.

2650
01:53:51,770 --> 01:53:54,770
It's like sometimes a hybrid mixes with 
a pure coyote.

2651
01:53:55,010 --> 01:53:56,930
Sometimes a hybrid.
Mix it with another hybrid,

2652
01:53:56,931 --> 01:53:58,850
sometimes a hybrid mixes with another 
wolf.

2653
01:53:59,270 --> 01:54:02,000
So there's like a bunch of different 
levels of coyotes and wolves.

2654
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:06,200
But ultimately they're all wolves.
Coyotes are a type of wolf.

2655
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:10,550
But the difference between dogs and 
wolves as dramatic.

2656
01:54:10,551 --> 01:54:13,040
Right.
I think I read that lonely by image.

2657
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:14,040
By image only.
Yeah.

2658
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:16,430
The genetics are the exactly the same.
But then the,

2659
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:21,580
the natural abilities of them that I 
shouldn't say the genetics because 

2660
01:54:21,580 --> 01:54:22,320
obviously they vary,
right?

2661
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:27,320
Yeah.
But what I should say is when you 

2662
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:29,210
research a dog's DNA,
all dogs came from wolves.

2663
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:31,520
Hmm.
So they became a dog.

2664
01:54:31,820 --> 01:54:34,910
But obviously an English bulldog is very
different than A.

2665
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:36,590
Husky is very different than a 
rottweiler is.

2666
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:39,170
There's a lot of weird variations in 
genes,

2667
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:43,070
but all of them originated with wolves.
Interesting.

2668
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:44,360
Yeah.
They didn't even know how.

2669
01:54:44,750 --> 01:54:46,810
They don't know what I mean.
What the coyotes come from.

2670
01:54:47,370 --> 01:54:49,460
Coyotes are.
Wolves are wolves up in.

2671
01:54:49,461 --> 01:54:52,760
Some coyotes have bread with dogs.
When we did a fear factor shoot,

2672
01:54:52,761 --> 01:54:57,761
once we stumbled upon this,
like I'm a litter of puppies that this 

2673
01:54:57,951 --> 01:55:00,380
Labrador had had with the coyote.
It was really weird.

2674
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:02,960
Do you ever see mountain lion?
I've seen mountain lions.

2675
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:04,460
I've seen him twice.
Yeah.

2676
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:08,800
I saw one in Colorado and I saw one in 
Santa Barbara,

2677
01:55:08,801 --> 01:55:11,090
so I wanted Montecito,
Montecito neighborhood.

2678
01:55:11,690 --> 01:55:12,890
We were driving to a restaurant.

2679
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:18,070
We're driving up the street and this 
thing runs across the road and I'm 

2680
01:55:18,070 --> 01:55:18,070
looking at it and was like,
Oh,

2681
01:55:18,070 --> 01:55:20,630
I saw its tail and then oh my God,
it's a cat.

2682
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:22,580
That's a cat.
That's a big cat.

2683
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:25,640
Holy Shit.
It's such a different feeling,

2684
01:55:25,641 --> 01:55:26,810
man.
When you see,

2685
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:31,840
and when I say big cat,
it was probably about 60 or 70 pounds 

2686
01:55:33,321 --> 01:55:38,321
anywhere between.
I'm just guessing anywhere between 50 

2687
01:55:38,321 --> 01:55:38,850
and 70 pounds.
It wasn't big like a big mountain lion,

2688
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:41,870
like some of them get to be 150 plus 
pounds.

2689
01:55:41,871 --> 01:55:44,430
It wasn't like that big.
Can it be bad motherfuckers?

2690
01:55:44,460 --> 01:55:49,460
They're all bad motherfuckers.
I'm my point is that 51 will fuck you 

2691
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:49,460
up.
Of course.

2692
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:52,350
$50.
Mountain Lion will fuck you up man.

2693
01:55:52,351 --> 01:55:54,030
You don't want to see that.
No,

2694
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:59,090
that's a terrible.
So to see it in this really nice 

2695
01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:01,521
neighborhood,
we went to this really nice Italian 

2696
01:56:01,521 --> 01:56:01,521
restaurant.

2697
01:56:01,521 --> 01:56:01,770
We're driving down a residential street 
and we're like,

2698
01:56:01,771 --> 01:56:03,540
Holy Shit,
that's a killer.

2699
01:56:03,770 --> 01:56:06,060
Just Roman looking for dogs and shit.
Yeah.

2700
01:56:06,061 --> 01:56:08,970
What if it's saw you walking your dog,
you know they'll take your dog.

2701
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:14,250
A coyote is take your dog all the time.
You hear stories about old ladies and 

2702
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:14,760
Brentwood walking there.
Poodles,

2703
01:56:14,761 --> 01:56:15,180
Click,
Click,

2704
01:56:15,181 --> 01:56:17,130
click,
click to hear the clicks of the nails of

2705
01:56:17,131 --> 01:56:22,131
the coyote behind them and the kind of 
just snatches that dollar right off the 

2706
01:56:22,131 --> 01:56:22,131
leash.
Yeah,

2707
01:56:22,131 --> 01:56:22,890
that's horrible.
They'll eat anything.

2708
01:56:23,370 --> 01:56:25,470
Especially when they're in urban 
environments,

2709
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:29,460
they actually target cats and dogs 
because cats and dogs kill a lot of what

2710
01:56:29,461 --> 01:56:32,550
they kill,
so they don't just look at a cat.

2711
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:37,760
This is one of the things I found out 
from this coyote America book that I 

2712
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:41,100
read was that they don't just look at a 
cat as a something to eat.

2713
01:56:41,340 --> 01:56:43,110
They really look at it as a competing 
predator.

2714
01:56:43,710 --> 01:56:44,940
Oh,
so I got to get rid of that.

2715
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:50,060
Yeah,
because that things eating all the 

2716
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:50,060
fucking birds,
right?

2717
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:50,060
Things.
Eating all the rats so things eat.

2718
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:50,760
Know it's killing everything.
I ever thought of that.

2719
01:56:50,761 --> 01:56:51,140
Yeah,
they,

2720
01:56:51,141 --> 01:56:56,141
they don't like it.
They don't like having competing 

2721
01:56:56,141 --> 01:56:56,141
predators around competition mean 
they'll kill it.

2722
01:56:56,141 --> 01:56:57,420
If it was a chicken,
obviously they would kill it.

2723
01:56:57,421 --> 01:56:59,940
If it was something that wasn't a 
competing like it was a bunny rabbit,

2724
01:56:59,941 --> 01:57:04,941
they would kill it too,
so it's hard to say why they're killing 

2725
01:57:04,941 --> 01:57:08,511
it.
They easily could be killing it for 

2726
01:57:08,511 --> 01:57:10,011
food,
but they believe that they target those 

2727
01:57:10,011 --> 01:57:10,230
animals because those animals are fellow
predators.

2728
01:57:10,470 --> 01:57:12,450
Interesting.
They must know.

2729
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:14,580
They must be able to tell when 
something's a predator.

2730
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:17,070
I,
I saw this piece of news piece about how

2731
01:57:17,490 --> 01:57:21,480
they would have much better chance of 
survival.

2732
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:26,430
The mountain lions out here if we had 
overpasses over the freeways for them to

2733
01:57:26,431 --> 01:57:27,120
roam.
Yeah.

2734
01:57:27,121 --> 01:57:30,150
They're going to build those.
Are they going to build it in Europe?

2735
01:57:30,151 --> 01:57:32,640
They have someplace I've got to do.
I'm here and I'm gonna spend millions of

2736
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:34,740
dollars and people were up in arms.
People fuck these things.

2737
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,650
Well,
one of them I'm just killed.

2738
01:57:37,770 --> 01:57:42,770
I think it was like,
what do we will look this up the other 

2739
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:42,770
day,
right?

2740
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:45,530
Twelve Alpacas or 1111 alpacas and one 
goat in Malibu.

2741
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:51,980
Just went on a rampage.
Just decided I just want to jump the 

2742
01:57:51,980 --> 01:57:53,310
fence and fuck these things up.
Didn't eat one of them.

2743
01:57:54,270 --> 01:57:56,200
Killed them for the fuck of it.
I think it was like,

2744
01:57:56,270 --> 01:57:58,410
like for fun or because they saw it as a
good time.

2745
01:57:58,430 --> 01:57:59,010
Yeah.
Good time.

2746
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:04,100
Can't resist.
There's a bunch of things stuck in a 

2747
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:04,100
cage.
I get in that cage.

2748
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:04,470
I get over the top of that thing.
Alright,

2749
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:09,520
I'm going to do it.
I mean it's like probably a thrill for 

2750
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:09,740
him.
Sure.

2751
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:13,560
These are these totally team things that
aren't going to run good.

2752
01:58:13,820 --> 01:58:16,170
Like think about how many times I think 
is trying to sneak up on a deer.

2753
01:58:16,171 --> 01:58:17,740
The deer season point.
Point.

2754
01:58:17,810 --> 01:58:19,290
Point.
Fuck.

2755
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:21,320
Yeah.
I mean how many times did that thing.

2756
01:58:21,321 --> 01:58:26,321
I have to go on a stock before it 
actually gets a deer walked out of that 

2757
01:58:26,321 --> 01:58:26,640
cage.
Like it just,

2758
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:31,880
it just satisfies.
This probably came from all over the 

2759
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:31,880
place.
Uh,

2760
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:32,010
uh.
Yeah.

2761
01:58:32,011 --> 01:58:37,011
See if they did,
they gave a depredation order to kill 

2762
01:58:37,011 --> 01:58:37,410
this thing and people are up in arms 
about that.

2763
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:37,920
They're like,
no,

2764
01:58:37,921 --> 01:58:39,780
we want the monster that kills the 
Alpaca.

2765
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:41,740
Stay near our children,
our house.

2766
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:42,910
She.
Oh,

2767
01:58:42,911 --> 01:58:45,690
don't kill it.
Oh,

2768
01:58:46,190 --> 01:58:47,560
I'm a big mountain lion fan.

2769
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:48,430
Folks,
don't get me wrong.

2770
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:53,460
I'm a big fan of wolves to.
But when you got something in your 

2771
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:55,840
neighborhood that kills 11 alpacas,
what if it was a werewolf?

2772
01:58:55,990 --> 01:59:00,990
Okay.
What if a Werewolf was in your 

2773
01:59:00,990 --> 01:59:00,990
neighborhood and decide to kill a bunch 
of sheep?

2774
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:04,240
Got Reprieve.
They decided to change this.

2775
01:59:04,270 --> 01:59:05,860
Wow.
They gave a depredation order,

2776
01:59:05,861 --> 01:59:07,720
which means the rancher was allowed to 
kill it.

2777
01:59:08,110 --> 01:59:10,510
So it looks like the mountain lion got a
reprieve.

2778
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:15,070
The neighborhood offered to shoot the 
big cat known as p 45.

2779
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:18,130
Can make that a little bigger.
Thank you sir.

2780
01:59:18,590 --> 01:59:20,770
Uh,
for Victoria von Pearling.

2781
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:24,520
But she told reporters it was never her 
intention to have a,

2782
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:26,230
have the cougar killed.
Instead,

2783
01:59:26,231 --> 01:59:31,231
she said she'd hook game officials would
capture it and get it away from her 

2784
01:59:31,231 --> 01:59:31,231
ranch.
Okay.

2785
01:59:31,231 --> 01:59:32,640
So the woman who,
uh,

2786
01:59:32,770 --> 01:59:37,770
have the Alpacas,
didn't want the mountain lion to be 

2787
01:59:37,770 --> 01:59:37,770
killed.

2788
01:59:37,770 --> 01:59:40,800
She indicated that public outrage 
might've played a role in her decision 

2789
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:41,860
adding.
She was surprised by the vitriol.

2790
01:59:41,890 --> 01:59:42,730
Oh,
of course.

2791
01:59:43,060 --> 01:59:43,690
Yeah.
Well,

2792
01:59:43,691 --> 01:59:46,090
the people who don't know,
especially someone who's like a rancher,

2793
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:51,120
is raising the Alpacas and they're not 
paying attention to how nutty like 

2794
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:52,570
social justice warriors get online when 
it comes to things like this.

2795
01:59:53,230 --> 01:59:56,560
But here's the thing folks,
you got a problem.

2796
01:59:56,561 --> 02:00:01,561
If you've got something that's in your 
neighborhood that kills a lot of 

2797
02:00:01,561 --> 02:00:01,561
livestock,
especially that the way it did it,

2798
02:00:01,561 --> 02:00:03,850
there were killed a bunch of them and 
didn't even eat it.

2799
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:05,620
Where would they drop that thing by the 
way?

2800
02:00:05,621 --> 02:00:06,790
You think?
If they were trying to do that,

2801
02:00:06,791 --> 02:00:09,610
they would take it somewhere like big 
bear or you know,

2802
02:00:09,611 --> 02:00:12,990
somewhere probably close by,
but far enough away that it would,

2803
02:00:13,150 --> 02:00:15,820
you know,
maybe could stake out a new territory,

2804
02:00:15,821 --> 02:00:17,890
but there's no guarantee that it doesn't
come back.

2805
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:23,160
See,
the thing about mountain lions as 

2806
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:24,541
opposed to people is they know where the
fuck they are and they know how to get 

2807
02:00:24,541 --> 02:00:25,000
home.
Like they have some weird built in sense

2808
02:00:25,001 --> 02:00:28,060
of direction.
Like mountain lions will travel hundreds

2809
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:29,800
of miles in their lives,
hundreds,

2810
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:34,800
hundreds of miles,
and they'll get back to where they were 

2811
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:34,800
due.
There was a mountain man that was killed

2812
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:36,430
in fucking Connecticut and it originated
in South Dakota.

2813
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:38,410
That's a really far.
Yeah.

2814
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:41,770
It was killed by a car and Connecticut 
and they were like,

2815
02:00:41,771 --> 02:00:45,440
what in the fuck is this?
Yeah.

2816
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:47,170
Why is there a mountain lion on the 
road?

2817
02:00:47,180 --> 02:00:48,760
See if you can find that story.
Jesus.

2818
02:00:48,870 --> 02:00:52,540
So I don't butcher with my shit.
Memory didn't take Algebra in today.

2819
02:00:52,630 --> 02:00:53,350
No,
no,

2820
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:55,570
I forgot.
Forgot to grab it on the way out now.

2821
02:00:55,571 --> 02:00:56,980
I'm stupid.
Keep you sharper.

2822
02:00:57,490 --> 02:00:59,740
All for sure.
And the phlegm didn't help either.

2823
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:04,960
Phlegm at the beginning of the podcast 
time yet Connecticut Mountain Lion 

2824
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:06,500
walked from South Dakota.
$1,500,

2825
02:01:07,430 --> 02:01:09,760
140 pound male.
Cougar,

2826
02:01:09,761 --> 02:01:13,180
which is a big cat estimate between two 
and five years old,

2827
02:01:13,181 --> 02:01:18,181
almost certainly left its native habitat
to look for mates but went in the wrong 

2828
02:01:18,181 --> 02:01:21,220
direction according to Adrian.
Why little the animal?

2829
02:01:21,370 --> 02:01:22,720
How do you say that name?
Adrian?

2830
02:01:23,050 --> 02:01:25,480
Why Devon?
Devon Devon.

2831
02:01:26,230 --> 02:01:31,230
I'm a mammal ecologist with the 
Wisconsin Department of natural 

2832
02:01:31,230 --> 02:01:31,960
resources.
He was looking for love in all the wrong

2833
02:01:31,961 --> 02:01:33,610
places,
is one of those expressions.

2834
02:01:34,210 --> 02:01:37,750
He was struck by an Suv on the Wilbur 
Cross Parkway in Milford,

2835
02:01:37,751 --> 02:01:38,890
Connecticut.
I know where that is.

2836
02:01:38,891 --> 02:01:41,630
I used to play pool around there.
Just play pool and Milford.

2837
02:01:42,130 --> 02:01:42,970
Yeah,
and that area.

2838
02:01:43,230 --> 02:01:47,390
It was Milford on June 11th.
The driver was unhurt,

2839
02:01:47,391 --> 02:01:50,190
but the cougar died at the scene.
Fuck did that.

2840
02:01:50,350 --> 02:01:52,280
Cooter was just glass and then the guy 
hit him.

2841
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:57,370
That's interesting that they initially 
thought that had been released from 

2842
02:01:57,370 --> 02:02:00,041
captivity given that no mountain line 
had been cited in the state for more 

2843
02:02:00,041 --> 02:02:00,041
than 100 years.

2844
02:02:00,041 --> 02:02:01,460
Jesus,
that's so long,

2845
02:02:01,461 --> 02:02:02,300
man.
It's crazy.

2846
02:02:02,330 --> 02:02:03,110
Yeah,
they can.

2847
02:02:03,160 --> 02:02:08,160
They've spotted them and a lot of places
and now they're fact like a big one is 

2848
02:02:08,160 --> 02:02:08,890
Florida,
you know,

2849
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:13,900
Florida,
the cougars in Florida with a legend 

2850
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:14,260
just a few years ago and now there's a 
lot of video of him.

2851
02:02:14,490 --> 02:02:16,580
Have you seen the one where the lady is 
walking down a fence?

2852
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:19,880
She's walking on a bridge rather,
and as she's walking down the bridge,

2853
02:02:19,881 --> 02:02:24,881
the fucking mountain lions on the bridge
and runs past and she filmed the whole 

2854
02:02:24,881 --> 02:02:24,881
thing.
She's freaking out.

2855
02:02:24,881 --> 02:02:25,790
No,
hold on.

2856
02:02:26,280 --> 02:02:28,610
No,
it's a big one too and it's just,

2857
02:02:28,690 --> 02:02:31,520
it's a little narrow ass.
Wouldn't bridge check this shit out.

2858
02:02:31,910 --> 02:02:33,290
Like wash.
Give us some volume.

2859
02:02:33,291 --> 02:02:34,700
Jamie.
Give me some fucking volume.

2860
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:39,420
Watch this.
Where's the volume you're washes.

2861
02:02:39,670 --> 02:02:41,710
Watching my God.
Watch.

2862
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:49,020
Do to do well.
Are you fucking kidding me?

2863
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:55,460
This for the people listening,
not watching this mountain lion,

2864
02:02:55,461 --> 02:02:59,900
which is really big runs by this lady.
I guess it's a Florida Panther,

2865
02:02:59,930 --> 02:03:01,220
but it's the same animal,
right?

2866
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:04,040
It runs by this lady within a couple of 
feet over.

2867
02:03:04,130 --> 02:03:09,130
Oh yeah.
Maybe one right next to her and it's 

2868
02:03:09,130 --> 02:03:09,620
huge.
This cat is goddamn enormous,

2869
02:03:09,830 --> 02:03:10,930
but it's,
you know,

2870
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:12,710
she's lucky that she's standing.
Was that,

2871
02:03:12,730 --> 02:03:14,030
is it.
Does it say in her district?

2872
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:17,060
In her description as your mom's house?
She wasn't my mom.

2873
02:03:17,920 --> 02:03:19,000
God.
Hey,

2874
02:03:19,090 --> 02:03:24,090
mom lives in Florida.
She does Naples,

2875
02:03:24,830 --> 02:03:26,150
Naples,
corkscrew,

2876
02:03:26,151 --> 02:03:28,790
swamp sanctuary.
They're eating rednecks out there folks.

2877
02:03:28,791 --> 02:03:31,590
Don't fucking kid yourself to not miss.
And Man,

2878
02:03:31,610 --> 02:03:34,220
he was out there.
Frog and he went out there.

2879
02:03:34,221 --> 02:03:37,390
Frog and we never heard from him again.
There's a lot you.

2880
02:03:37,660 --> 02:03:38,390
Oh yeah,
they,

2881
02:03:38,420 --> 02:03:40,450
everything eats you.
You go out there and like,

2882
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:41,930
fucking what was that one?

2883
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:44,750
Do you remember that one movie?
Goddammit.

2884
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:49,900
Southern Comfort.
Do you remember of that Southern 

2885
02:03:49,900 --> 02:03:49,900
Comfort?
No.

2886
02:03:49,900 --> 02:03:50,570
Southern Comfort is about some national 
guard.

2887
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:52,550
It's a fucking good movie.
Goddammit.

2888
02:03:52,640 --> 02:03:54,380
Before I say that,
it might not hold up.

2889
02:03:54,610 --> 02:03:55,660
Okay.
It might be one of those.

2890
02:03:56,810 --> 02:03:57,860
It'll.
Yes,

2891
02:03:57,861 --> 02:03:59,920
I know exactly what you mean when you 
were 16.

2892
02:04:00,360 --> 02:04:03,410
Roadhouses shit.
Patrick.

2893
02:04:03,411 --> 02:04:04,580
Lazy.
No karate for real.

2894
02:04:04,581 --> 02:04:06,890
You fucking really asking me that 
southern comfort.

2895
02:04:06,950 --> 02:04:11,950
Yeah.
So it was about these national guard 

2896
02:04:11,950 --> 02:04:11,950
guys that went down into the swamp and 
um,

2897
02:04:11,950 --> 02:04:16,840
they were doing some sort of like 
exercise and they piss somebody off and 

2898
02:04:17,841 --> 02:04:22,200
they got in some sort of an exchange 
with people and they shot at someone who

2899
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:25,190
they shot at someone with blanks.
They didn't have real bullets.

2900
02:04:25,191 --> 02:04:30,191
They were just being an asshole.
And when they shot at someone they shot 

2901
02:04:30,191 --> 02:04:33,881
at like some,
some Cajun guy who like lived in the 

2902
02:04:33,881 --> 02:04:36,230
swamps and they,
um,

2903
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:37,980
they set up waiting for these guys

2904
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:41,220
and they took one out with a rifle,
a from a distance.

2905
02:04:41,221 --> 02:04:42,420
And when he died,
they went,

2906
02:04:42,450 --> 02:04:47,450
oh my God,
like this guy is shot and killed in 

2907
02:04:47,450 --> 02:04:47,450
front of them.
And then it became,

2908
02:04:47,450 --> 02:04:51,830
I don't want to give away spoiler alert,
but it becomes these guys trying to 

2909
02:04:51,830 --> 02:04:55,490
survive in the woods with these crazy 
fucking cage and people that have been 

2910
02:04:55,741 --> 02:04:57,800
living there their whole lives.
Whoa,

2911
02:04:58,590 --> 02:04:59,430
dude.
It's deep.

2912
02:04:59,620 --> 02:05:01,290
It's sluts,
but it's fucking.

2913
02:05:02,010 --> 02:05:05,880
Let's go see pizza sluts.
You knew it was bullshit going in,

2914
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:07,020
right?
That was the part,

2915
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:09,330
the guiding get.
Yeah.

2916
02:05:11,960 --> 02:05:13,230
That's a good fucking movie,
man.

2917
02:05:13,240 --> 02:05:15,080
Yeah,
it's a good fucking movie.

2918
02:05:15,090 --> 02:05:16,620
I remember.
This might suck.

2919
02:05:16,950 --> 02:05:18,480
I'm going to warn you if you go watch 
it.

2920
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:20,520
Joe Rogan.
I saw altered states.

2921
02:05:20,521 --> 02:05:23,460
That movie's fucking terrible.
And you're right.

2922
02:05:23,550 --> 02:05:24,420
Yeah,
you're right.

2923
02:05:25,020 --> 02:05:27,750
Altered states changed my life,
but it's terrible.

2924
02:05:28,230 --> 02:05:30,090
Yeah,
it was a lot of old movies.

2925
02:05:30,091 --> 02:05:31,110
Don't hold up.
Nope.

2926
02:05:31,320 --> 02:05:33,240
Try watching that shit today.
Comedies too.

2927
02:05:33,241 --> 02:05:34,770
Sometimes you,
I guess the funniest shit.

2928
02:05:34,850 --> 02:05:36,030
And then you watch it again.
You're like,

2929
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:38,100
someone was telling me that about 
stripes.

2930
02:05:38,130 --> 02:05:39,870
They tried to watch stripes.
Yeah.

2931
02:05:39,930 --> 02:05:42,060
And like this is fucking terrible.
Yeah.

2932
02:05:42,070 --> 02:05:42,710
If you see,
I mean,

2933
02:05:42,711 --> 02:05:42,980
you know,
the,

2934
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:45,660
the thing that you don't give enough 
credit to on something like that,

2935
02:05:46,080 --> 02:05:51,080
something like stripes was one of the 
blueprints for how to make that kind of 

2936
02:05:52,021 --> 02:05:57,021
comedy and if you're somebody that 
didn't see stripes but so 100 bad 

2937
02:05:57,541 --> 02:06:01,980
versions of stripes and then you see it,
then it looks bad because you've,

2938
02:06:02,010 --> 02:06:06,360
you know,
formulaically who the characters is this

2939
02:06:06,361 --> 02:06:07,680
character,
that character.

2940
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:10,950
You've seen versions of all the jokes,
you know it.

2941
02:06:10,951 --> 02:06:12,390
So then it feels like,
oh,

2942
02:06:12,391 --> 02:06:15,840
this is just another bad when it's 
actually the original.

2943
02:06:15,930 --> 02:06:20,460
Right.
It's also a problem that like everything

2944
02:06:20,461 --> 02:06:21,540
else,
it just kinda gets,

2945
02:06:21,541 --> 02:06:23,260
keeps getting better.
People get better.

2946
02:06:23,370 --> 02:06:24,730
Yeah.
Like superbad.

2947
02:06:25,170 --> 02:06:27,360
Yeah.
Like superbad didn't exist before.

2948
02:06:27,361 --> 02:06:28,500
Stripes.
Right.

2949
02:06:28,590 --> 02:06:33,590
You know,
unlike stripes kind of opened the door 

2950
02:06:33,590 --> 02:06:33,840
for movies like Superbad,
but ultimately superbad funnier.

2951
02:06:33,930 --> 02:06:34,710
Yeah.
It's better.

2952
02:06:34,740 --> 02:06:35,790
It's bad movie.
Damn,

2953
02:06:35,791 --> 02:06:37,110
that movie's funny.
He's really funny.

2954
02:06:37,111 --> 02:06:42,111
That's a funny.
That's a fucking by yourself holding 

2955
02:06:42,111 --> 02:06:42,420
your sides at home.
Laughing your ass off.

2956
02:06:42,421 --> 02:06:43,110
Funny moving.
Yeah.

2957
02:06:43,230 --> 02:06:43,770
Yeah.
You're right.

2958
02:06:44,010 --> 02:06:46,530
So the ones that they really knock it 
out of the park today,

2959
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:48,810
but it has to be one that they knock.
There's a lot of shit,

2960
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:50,460
but there's always a lot of shit 
comedies.

2961
02:06:50,461 --> 02:06:52,140
There was shit comedies then the shit 
comments.

2962
02:06:52,150 --> 02:06:57,150
So really good comedy lately.
Have you seen one that Fred eichler 

2963
02:06:57,510 --> 02:07:02,510
glass and video fucking glass and 
Jamie's seen a good movie.

2964
02:07:03,610 --> 02:07:08,610
Good comedy.
I'm trying to remember one that I've 

2965
02:07:08,610 --> 02:07:09,360
seen recently that was really funny.
I heard trainwreck was funny,

2966
02:07:09,361 --> 02:07:10,140
but I didn't see it.

2967
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:12,800
Mm.

2968
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:15,450
I would name one,
one movie.

2969
02:07:16,130 --> 02:07:17,790
I'm trying to think.
God dammit.

2970
02:07:19,090 --> 02:07:21,870
What about a good moment?
Have you seen a good movie or recently?

2971
02:07:24,750 --> 02:07:27,420
Um,
I saw shark bites the shallows.

2972
02:07:27,570 --> 02:07:28,610
I saw that.
What's that?

2973
02:07:28,990 --> 02:07:30,780
That.
I mean it was just a entertaining.

2974
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:33,690
It was a blake lively alone sharks after
her,

2975
02:07:33,710 --> 02:07:34,410
you know,
it was silly.

2976
02:07:34,411 --> 02:07:36,040
It wasn't like for what

2977
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:37,750
it was,
it was like entertaining.

2978
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:43,260
You know,
it's problem with movies is now hbo and 

2979
02:07:43,260 --> 02:07:44,350
Netflix because they're so fucking 
digest clanged it over the head.

2980
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:47,140
Like when you watch a new episode of 
game of thrones,

2981
02:07:47,141 --> 02:07:49,510
you're so goddamn invested in that show.
Well,

2982
02:07:49,511 --> 02:07:52,600
they can go so much further with where 
the story's going to go.

2983
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:54,460
Dan goes so deep,
you know,

2984
02:07:54,461 --> 02:07:57,100
if you know you have 10,
13,

2985
02:07:57,460 --> 02:08:02,460
15 hours to tell a story,
you can really make those hours 

2986
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:05,050
meaningful.
It's totally different than like a great

2987
02:08:05,051 --> 02:08:10,051
show that you get into.
I mean it just changed like due to the 

2988
02:08:10,051 --> 02:08:13,830
fucking.
I think I've told you if you watched 

2989
02:08:13,830 --> 02:08:13,830
Fargo the TV series or.
It's amazing.

2990
02:08:13,830 --> 02:08:15,220
It's fucking unbelievable.
There's too many good shows.

2991
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:16,630
That guy is unreal.
Noah,

2992
02:08:16,631 --> 02:08:18,610
I forget his last.
That guy is unreal,

2993
02:08:18,611 --> 02:08:19,870
man.
Those shows are so good.

2994
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:21,550
Is Billy Bob Thornton still in it?

2995
02:08:21,610 --> 02:08:23,260
It would know.
He's the most.

2996
02:08:23,261 --> 02:08:24,970
Don't tell me anything.
The can stop saying,

2997
02:08:25,390 --> 02:08:26,730
don't you spoil or the.
No,

2998
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:27,910
I won't.
I won't spoil anything,

2999
02:08:27,940 --> 02:08:32,440
but you should watch season one and 
threaten me though.

3000
02:08:32,441 --> 02:08:33,250
Dude.
What?

3001
02:08:35,230 --> 02:08:36,580
Deadpool was pretty good.
I was like,

3002
02:08:36,581 --> 02:08:40,180
I don't know if you consider necessarily
I would call that a superhero comedy and

3003
02:08:40,181 --> 02:08:41,770
I agree with you.
That was really funny that,

3004
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:44,350
that was a good movie.
That was really fucking funny.

3005
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:46,650
And um,
that dude's really funny.

3006
02:08:46,810 --> 02:08:47,920
Ryan O'neal,
he's fun.

3007
02:08:47,921 --> 02:08:49,300
Reynolds Reynolds,
same guy.

3008
02:08:49,570 --> 02:08:52,440
Same Guy.
Handsome guys around for a thousand.

3009
02:08:52,570 --> 02:08:55,210
Alex,
his wife is the star of the,

3010
02:08:55,211 --> 02:08:57,000
of the shark one.
I saw that.

3011
02:08:57,080 --> 02:08:57,600
His wife.
Well,

3012
02:08:57,601 --> 02:08:58,360
there you go.
There you go.

3013
02:08:58,400 --> 02:08:59,290
Makes Sense.
Why it was great.

3014
02:08:59,350 --> 02:09:00,160
Yeah,
he's a funny dude.

3015
02:09:00,161 --> 02:09:01,990
That was a good movie.
Really funny.

3016
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:03,550
Uh,
I wonder if that new one,

3017
02:09:03,551 --> 02:09:05,770
that new one has like a pretty funny 
trailer.

3018
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:08,970
The Anniston work one.
You know what I mean?

3019
02:09:08,990 --> 02:09:10,340
Christmas party.
It's like,

3020
02:09:10,430 --> 02:09:12,070
it's,
it's like an r rated comedy.

3021
02:09:12,071 --> 02:09:14,080
It looks like it could be fun.
I haven't seen it.

3022
02:09:14,110 --> 02:09:19,110
Jennifer Aniston's.
I would just said it's going to be 

3023
02:09:19,110 --> 02:09:19,110
funny.
I think so you just said that.

3024
02:09:19,110 --> 02:09:19,110
Yeah.
It's got Tj Miller.

3025
02:09:19,110 --> 02:09:20,320
It's got some money.
Okay.

3026
02:09:21,540 --> 02:09:24,070
That's what I like.
Good Solid Jennifer Aniston movie.

3027
02:09:24,430 --> 02:09:26,240
Dude,
if you're not a fucking friends.

3028
02:09:26,980 --> 02:09:29,040
So I'd never watched friends.
Now it's,

3029
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:31,090
it's very,
it's just formulaic.

3030
02:09:31,091 --> 02:09:33,840
Man is generic,
but it people like the fencers.

3031
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:34,810
Yeah,
I think so.

3032
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:35,770
Sure.
It just hit,

3033
02:09:35,771 --> 02:09:36,880
it,
hits all the notes.

3034
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:42,000
If you're writing a sitcom,
each of those characters plays one of 

3035
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,590
the like archetype people and they just 
got people that had chemistry.

3036
02:09:44,591 --> 02:09:49,591
I fucked up.
I never watched Seinfeld when I was on 

3037
02:09:49,591 --> 02:09:49,591
the air and I never watched friends.
Seinfeld.

3038
02:09:49,591 --> 02:09:53,950
I've watched a couple of frasiers and I 
would always watch it for like 10 

3039
02:09:53,950 --> 02:09:53,950
minutes and go,
what the fuck am I doing?

3040
02:09:53,950 --> 02:09:56,440
Seinfeld is really the only,
I think one that's.

3041
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,380
If you're a comic,
do you ever watch mad about you and go,

3042
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:03,250
is there something with the.
Am I thinking wrong?

3043
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:08,280
Well,
I would see people watch it like family 

3044
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:10,321
members and laughing and that's when I,
that's when I would think something's 

3045
02:10:10,321 --> 02:10:11,260
wrong with me.
And then after I was like,

3046
02:10:11,261 --> 02:10:12,790
you're retarded.
You know,

3047
02:10:13,220 --> 02:10:14,380
she was.
She said to him,

3048
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:17,080
what do you think that is?
You're not retarded,

3049
02:10:17,290 --> 02:10:19,120
but I think the people that are so 
laughing.

3050
02:10:19,121 --> 02:10:20,770
Do you think it's an intelligence thing?
Yes.

3051
02:10:21,140 --> 02:10:23,140
Yes it is.
Yeah.

3052
02:10:23,141 --> 02:10:26,490
They're tapped to.
They're tapping into dl sperm there,

3053
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:31,500
figuring out the people that focus 
better pro because you went different 

3054
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:31,690
shows.
Come on Bro.

3055
02:10:32,230 --> 02:10:33,830
You know what I saw?
That's fucking excellent.

3056
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:36,320
All bullshit aside.
I don't care what you like.

3057
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:38,150
But uh,
um,

3058
02:10:38,450 --> 02:10:40,820
black mirror or dark mirror,
black hair and black mirror,

3059
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:43,080
black mirror.
I watched the one where the guy,

3060
02:10:43,081 --> 02:10:47,960
I finally watched it and I went right to
the one where the guy records memories.

3061
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:48,870
You.
Everyone can.

3062
02:10:50,340 --> 02:10:55,340
Holy Shit.
Have you seen what we've been talking 

3063
02:10:55,340 --> 02:10:58,340
about for so long that,
that show's phenomenal?

3064
02:10:58,670 --> 02:11:03,670
Have you seen the.
You're trying to one up me motherfucker 

3065
02:11:03,670 --> 02:11:03,670
masturbation one.
No,

3066
02:11:03,670 --> 02:11:06,410
no.
I'm saying on that show on Black Mirror.

3067
02:11:07,070 --> 02:11:08,280
What do you mean the,
the,

3068
02:11:08,360 --> 02:11:10,040
the.
There's an episode on masturbation.

3069
02:11:10,350 --> 02:11:15,350
I've only seen two episodes.
I saw the first one where the guy fucks 

3070
02:11:15,350 --> 02:11:16,040
the pig and I saw this.
This is the second one that I saw was,

3071
02:11:16,050 --> 02:11:21,050
okay,
I went to watch this one specifically 

3072
02:11:21,050 --> 02:11:21,050
because it's about a subject that we're 
constantly talking about,

3073
02:11:21,050 --> 02:11:22,820
which is,
which is recording memories that they're

3074
02:11:22,821 --> 02:11:23,990
going to be able to record memories.

3075
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:25,460
It's 100 percent.
It's gonna happen,

3076
02:11:25,970 --> 02:11:30,970
it's just a matter of whether or not we 
can survive the next hundred years or 

3077
02:11:30,970 --> 02:11:30,970
whatever it is before we get hit by an 
asteroid or.

3078
02:11:31,170 --> 02:11:36,170
But one of these days they're gonna.
Just think about how crazy it is that 

3079
02:11:36,170 --> 02:11:38,360
200 years ago,
if you wanted a painting is something if

3080
02:11:38,361 --> 02:11:40,160
you wanted to picture something,
rather you would have to paint it.

3081
02:11:40,670 --> 02:11:42,830
You'd have to draw or paint it.
And that was so,

3082
02:11:42,890 --> 02:11:44,750
so recent.
It was 200 years ago.

3083
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:45,470
Not Long.
Yeah.

3084
02:11:45,530 --> 02:11:50,530
No photographs ever.
So no one had ever seen anything that 

3085
02:11:50,530 --> 02:11:51,020
they didn't see.
You either saw it or you didn't say it.

3086
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:56,050
Sure.
So what we have done is let you see 

3087
02:11:56,050 --> 02:11:56,050
things you've never gotten anywhere 
near.

3088
02:11:56,050 --> 02:12:00,940
Like in some weird way.
We've already connected people's 

3089
02:12:00,940 --> 02:12:02,660
memories.
Like my memories of you know,

3090
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:04,460
anything.
Whatever I did this last weekend,

3091
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:05,960
I could show it to you on my phone.

3092
02:12:06,020 --> 02:12:07,050
Hey,
we went fishing in Hawaii.

3093
02:12:07,090 --> 02:12:12,090
Look at some of my memories.
I'm showing you my fucking memories and 

3094
02:12:12,090 --> 02:12:12,090
just shitty.
They're like Morse code,

3095
02:12:12,090 --> 02:12:13,280
you know,
they're like a,

3096
02:12:13,460 --> 02:12:15,650
you know,
a fucking teletype machine there.

3097
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:20,680
Facts,
they're not the internet and I think 

3098
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:23,250
it's crazy that your children will be 
able to grow up and think about how 

3099
02:12:23,250 --> 02:12:25,940
about yours as well?
I'm saying in my children,

3100
02:12:25,970 --> 02:12:27,970
because he might fucking kids.
Dude.

3101
02:12:28,910 --> 02:12:33,910
So my kids will go to you.
Show me a Sicilian section.

3102
02:12:33,981 --> 02:12:36,860
You piece of shit.
The snapchat spectacles,

3103
02:12:36,890 --> 02:12:41,890
which is the early version of what 
you're talking about to do a surgery 

3104
02:12:41,890 --> 02:12:41,890
like,
oh,

3105
02:12:41,890 --> 02:12:44,300
what kind of surgery is this?
Oh my God,

3106
02:12:44,301 --> 02:12:45,850
Dude.
Warning.

3107
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:47,720
I want a heads up.
I gotTa pee,

3108
02:12:47,721 --> 02:12:49,100
man.
Go pee bro.

3109
02:12:49,101 --> 02:12:52,580
I watched this guy get cut open.
But that's super interesting.

3110
02:12:52,640 --> 02:12:54,260
Yes,
it's through his eyes.

3111
02:12:54,261 --> 02:12:54,480
Right?

3112
02:12:55,010 --> 02:12:56,690
So the snapchat glasses or essential,
uh,

3113
02:12:56,691 --> 02:12:58,280
cameras that are connected to the 
Internet.

3114
02:12:58,790 --> 02:13:00,290
Yeah.
To your snapchat account,

3115
02:13:00,291 --> 02:13:01,390
I would assume.
But uh,

3116
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:02,990
yeah,
that's nuts.

3117
02:13:03,050 --> 02:13:05,270
Hands off camera.
So you don't have to.

3118
02:13:06,050 --> 02:13:11,050
People love them.
People were having sex on it and like 

3119
02:13:11,050 --> 02:13:11,120
how dare they,
I don't know if they're sharing the porn

3120
02:13:11,121 --> 02:13:16,121
videos online but,
but they can watch each other fuck 

3121
02:13:16,121 --> 02:13:16,121
through that.
So it's essentially the same thing.

3122
02:13:16,121 --> 02:13:16,400
They've already got it.
God Damn,

3123
02:13:17,090 --> 02:13:21,020
I knew it.
Not like it's anything brilliant on that

3124
02:13:21,021 --> 02:13:23,990
Black Mirror episode.
The different concepts that come up with

3125
02:13:23,991 --> 02:13:28,991
that are super interesting,
outstanding job and it was also weird 

3126
02:13:28,991 --> 02:13:33,371
how their eyes would glaze over when 
they would look at their own so they 

3127
02:13:33,371 --> 02:13:33,371
could at their stuff,
through their eyes.

3128
02:13:33,371 --> 02:13:33,371
I'm giving it away too much.
Right?

3129
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:38,520
It's been out for quite a while,
so what I didn't see it don't spoil 

3130
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:38,520
alert things.

3131
02:13:38,520 --> 02:13:39,480
People are mad at me for spoiler alert 
in the marketing dead.

3132
02:13:40,430 --> 02:13:42,030
What are you going to do folks?
I said,

3133
02:13:42,031 --> 02:13:44,190
spoiler alert,
just hit that button quick.

3134
02:13:44,370 --> 02:13:45,970
If you're nowhere near it and you hear,
spoiler alert,

3135
02:13:46,020 --> 02:13:47,940
you're not near your falling.
You're like fuck.

3136
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:53,480
By the time you get there we should give
them like spoiler alert and then 10 

3137
02:13:53,480 --> 02:13:54,630
seconds like next time we're going to 
say something about something.

3138
02:13:54,631 --> 02:13:56,830
We'll say spoiler alert and then 
countdown.

3139
02:13:56,950 --> 02:13:58,140
That'd be annoying though,
right?

3140
02:13:58,280 --> 02:14:03,280
For sure.
You know what will I should have like a 

3141
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:05,960
countdown on my desk,
like a little thing that I could press 

3142
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:06,780
at any moment and it just gives me a 
flat 10 seconds.

3143
02:14:06,781 --> 02:14:09,780
Can that be done?
And then I'll just keep talking and I'll

3144
02:14:09,781 --> 02:14:11,790
give you a spoiler alert.
Then they hit the button one.

3145
02:14:11,791 --> 02:14:16,791
I'm about to tell you.
I definitely get out of the fucking 

3146
02:14:16,791 --> 02:14:16,791
room.
If you want to know,

3147
02:14:16,791 --> 02:14:17,910
I'll let you know.
You got seven seconds.

3148
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:19,650
Five,
four.

3149
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:22,500
Then how are you gonna?
Talk about it for 10 minutes.

3150
02:14:22,690 --> 02:14:26,630
Well,
tough shit more.

3151
02:14:29,010 --> 02:14:32,250
But um,
what I thought was really interesting in

3152
02:14:32,251 --> 02:14:37,251
the Black Mirror thing is that when they
had that one late can't talk about that 

3153
02:14:37,251 --> 02:14:41,181
I'll spoil or it um,
but I just thought the way they handled 

3154
02:14:41,181 --> 02:14:42,120
it was really,
really well done because it,

3155
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:47,240
it,
it seemed like normal people have today 

3156
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:50,510
that we're faced with this technology.
Was it as opposed to like.

3157
02:14:50,851 --> 02:14:53,370
Westworld is weird to me.
I love westworld.

3158
02:14:53,580 --> 02:14:58,580
I'm a huge fan of it,
but it's weird to me that it's 30 years 

3159
02:14:58,580 --> 02:15:00,420
in the future,
but everything is pretty standard.

3160
02:15:00,421 --> 02:15:04,170
Like the way they're doing everything 
with a tablet and the everything,

3161
02:15:04,171 --> 02:15:06,540
the way they're walking around their 
apartments,

3162
02:15:06,541 --> 02:15:11,541
it all looks kind of the same.
Whereas if you go to 1970 and you look 

3163
02:15:11,541 --> 02:15:15,711
at 1970 as opposed to the year 2000,
there's a giant difference in that 30 

3164
02:15:15,711 --> 02:15:17,640
years.
I would think that whatever the fuck,

3165
02:15:17,820 --> 02:15:22,820
I mean if they're that close to they,
they made these goddamn robots and then 

3166
02:15:22,820 --> 02:15:22,940
30 years later they're the.

3167
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:26,490
They're still fairly similar like get 
the fuck Outta here.

3168
02:15:26,670 --> 02:15:28,960
Like 30 years later you have.
You still,

3169
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:31,620
you guys are still using ipads.
Like really?

3170
02:15:31,830 --> 02:15:36,830
Is that what's going on?
Like you haven't transcended into new 

3171
02:15:36,830 --> 02:15:39,351
dimensions.
We're not walking through artificial 

3172
02:15:39,351 --> 02:15:39,351
black holes that you make with your 
blender now.

3173
02:15:39,351 --> 02:15:43,860
I mean 30 years from now someone could 
create some mind numbing world changing 

3174
02:15:44,401 --> 02:15:46,410
shit.
It's not just going to be a robot.

3175
02:15:46,411 --> 02:15:49,950
You can fuck or shoot,
you know it's going to probably be over.

3176
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:54,980
That's the only like suspension of 
disbelief thing that fucks with me is 

3177
02:15:54,980 --> 02:15:57,831
that they've been doing that park for 30
years after watching it and having 

3178
02:15:57,831 --> 02:16:02,330
theories on it.
That could be like maybe that's all 

3179
02:16:02,330 --> 02:16:02,840
they've shown us so far is that might 
not be the actual you here.

3180
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:07,500
My theory is that how come when a 
spoiler alert,

3181
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:11,100
if you cut them open,
you see the robot parts,

3182
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:16,160
one of them,
but when you're building them now know 

3183
02:16:16,160 --> 02:16:18,800
when one's were murdered,
when he murked all those people and 

3184
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:18,800
chopped them all up.

3185
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:22,190
Remember that there was a scene that you
see like robot parts sticking out of 

3186
02:16:22,190 --> 02:16:26,001
people.
They were all laying down the whole 

3187
02:16:26,001 --> 02:16:29,300
ceiling.
Remembers seeing the inside of the 

3188
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:29,300
worse.
The chick,

3189
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:29,300
I forget who.
Anyway,

3190
02:16:29,300 --> 02:16:29,710
there was.
Yeah,

3191
02:16:29,770 --> 02:16:34,770
there's that.
But when you watch them construct the 

3192
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:34,770
things,
you don't see any of that stuff.

3193
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:35,940
You see synthetic bone or something like
that.

3194
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:38,920
So what the fuck is going on Jamie?
That's what I'm saying.

3195
02:16:38,921 --> 02:16:43,921
If you see that,
that last scene where they show the 

3196
02:16:43,921 --> 02:16:43,921
girl's arm ripped off.
I know.

3197
02:16:43,921 --> 02:16:44,500
Did you hear that?
They're not going to read band dominus.

3198
02:16:44,501 --> 02:16:47,590
They're not gonna do season two until 
2018 as well.

3199
02:16:47,591 --> 02:16:52,591
I mean they,
they have announced that they're going 

3200
02:16:52,591 --> 02:16:52,591
to do it and I probably have to.
It's 2017 now.

3201
02:16:52,591 --> 02:16:54,220
Basically they have to fill that by 
2018.

3202
02:16:54,221 --> 02:16:56,680
You think Bert would still be fat?
One hundred percent?

3203
02:16:56,890 --> 02:16:58,930
Absolutely.
You really committed to this.

3204
02:16:59,170 --> 02:16:59,950
Of course,
man,

3205
02:16:59,970 --> 02:17:02,860
he's a guy with feelings.
I know and I love him.

3206
02:17:03,010 --> 02:17:08,010
He's one of my best friends.
Would do anything for that guy if you 

3207
02:17:08,010 --> 02:17:08,490
can get inside his head and change him.
Yeah.

3208
02:17:08,740 --> 02:17:10,270
What'd you stop getting them?
Stop Drinking?

3209
02:17:10,620 --> 02:17:11,040
No.

3210
02:17:13,510 --> 02:17:15,970
What about after January third?
Definitely not.

3211
02:17:16,180 --> 02:17:17,500
No.
I want them to be happy.

3212
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:19,450
The only way he'll be happy if he keeps 
drinking.

3213
02:17:19,510 --> 02:17:23,080
Absolutely.
Maybe with new technology,

3214
02:17:23,140 --> 02:17:24,610
they'll figure out a way to fix your 
liver.

3215
02:17:25,060 --> 02:17:28,510
Maybe they'll will have like a stem cell
liver cleanse and they'll just pump that

3216
02:17:28,511 --> 02:17:30,370
shit in there.
I'm way,

3217
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:32,350
way into the burden.
Then future,

3218
02:17:32,410 --> 02:17:37,410
maybe I'll do something like that and 
maybe burt will have to drink more 

3219
02:17:37,410 --> 02:17:39,520
because it's liver will be so good that 
the booze won't last.

3220
02:17:39,580 --> 02:17:41,100
Right.
So we're up in like 20 minutes.

3221
02:17:41,180 --> 02:17:43,630
Fucking partying harder.
He's a fun guy to party with.

3222
02:17:43,780 --> 02:17:46,150
Oh yes.
Have you ever seen him do stand out with

3223
02:17:46,151 --> 02:17:47,530
a shirt on?
Yes.

3224
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:50,860
Back in the times I saw him for a while 
doing it.

3225
02:17:50,861 --> 02:17:51,790
He used.
He used to do it.

3226
02:17:52,780 --> 02:17:56,020
He only started doing that,
I feel like about two years ago,

3227
02:17:56,021 --> 02:18:01,021
maybe three.
I feel like it's fairly recent in the 

3228
02:18:01,021 --> 02:18:02,500
time that I've known him and seeing him 
just stand up and um,

3229
02:18:02,501 --> 02:18:04,840
and I think it was since then.
Have you ever seen him do standup with a

3230
02:18:04,841 --> 02:18:05,590
shirt on?
No,

3231
02:18:05,830 --> 02:18:06,750
I haven't either.
Yeah,

3232
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:07,540
it's,
it's,

3233
02:18:07,690 --> 02:18:08,290
it's,
um,

3234
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:10,510
but it works.
It's almost like part of the persona,

3235
02:18:10,540 --> 02:18:11,680
you know.
Well,

3236
02:18:11,681 --> 02:18:14,230
it's like,
I forget when he did news to dude.

3237
02:18:15,020 --> 02:18:16,420
Was he bigger than you or is it just me?

3238
02:18:20,310 --> 02:18:21,070
No,
man.

3239
02:18:21,071 --> 02:18:22,030
No,
we're about the same.

3240
02:18:22,370 --> 02:18:27,370
About the same size.
How does his pants stay right above his 

3241
02:18:27,370 --> 02:18:28,600
dick like that?
That seems impossible.

3242
02:18:28,601 --> 02:18:32,650
It seems like belt is about right there.
Yeah.

3243
02:18:32,651 --> 02:18:37,651
But that's different.
Photo Moshe Kasher showing US goods 

3244
02:18:37,651 --> 02:18:37,690
tidy.
Whities Moshe is a funny guy too,

3245
02:18:37,691 --> 02:18:39,670
man.
He's got a new show coming out on comedy

3246
02:18:39,671 --> 02:18:40,420
central.
Yeah.

3247
02:18:40,421 --> 02:18:41,020
That's,
um,

3248
02:18:41,050 --> 02:18:44,410
it's a really cool idea.
I'm sure it will be back to talk to very

3249
02:18:44,411 --> 02:18:45,850
smart dude.
Yeah.

3250
02:18:45,880 --> 02:18:46,600
Very,
very smart.

3251
02:18:46,601 --> 02:18:49,270
Is that Bryan county showing his abs 
with Bert Kreischer?

3252
02:18:49,710 --> 02:18:52,010
That right below that I would say to 
you,

3253
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:56,140
I'm so sorry Brian,
but when that's a little tiny image,

3254
02:18:56,141 --> 02:18:58,780
it does look like Brian can tell me.
It doesn't say I'm looking at Eddie.

3255
02:18:58,850 --> 02:18:59,800
Do you shred it?
Dah,

3256
02:18:59,801 --> 02:19:00,090
Dah,
Dah,

3257
02:19:00,091 --> 02:19:00,560
Dah,
Dah.

3258
02:19:00,930 --> 02:19:02,140
So it was.
Burt looks good there.

3259
02:19:02,290 --> 02:19:03,610
No,
that's not true at all.

3260
02:19:03,770 --> 02:19:06,910
Um,
Eddie is a crossfit shit.

3261
02:19:07,270 --> 02:19:12,270
Oh,
is he loves cross versus got that 

3262
02:19:12,270 --> 02:19:12,270
bloated distended thing though.
It's booze.

3263
02:19:12,270 --> 02:19:12,340
That's what I'm saying.
That's it.

3264
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:15,550
There's no way I can get out of that.
I think he could once he down to now,

3265
02:19:15,551 --> 02:19:20,551
was he claiming?
I don't know because he hasn't claimed 

3266
02:19:20,551 --> 02:19:22,411
in a minute.
Oh well here's a photo that he keeps 

3267
02:19:22,411 --> 02:19:22,630
bringing it up.
Have him back when he was real thin when

3268
02:19:22,631 --> 02:19:23,980
he was real young,
like in college.

3269
02:19:23,981 --> 02:19:25,630
That's hilarious.
He's bringing that one out.

3270
02:19:25,631 --> 02:19:27,420
But getting back to that bro.
And he did a,

3271
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:32,120
he did his promo for last week where he 
used a 10 to 15 year old picture,

3272
02:19:32,150 --> 02:19:35,660
but he just put it like with the date 
and the end,

3273
02:19:35,870 --> 02:19:38,860
he was so much thinner in it.
It was ridiculous.

3274
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:39,950
He did.
But he was just like,

3275
02:19:39,951 --> 02:19:43,040
I'll be here this week.
It's hilarious.

3276
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:45,110
That's really funny.
Yeah.

3277
02:19:45,320 --> 02:19:50,320
It's um,
it's not fun when you want your body to 

3278
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:50,320
get big and fat and you can't turn it 
around.

3279
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:50,320
Yeah.
I mean,

3280
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:51,590
you can.
Not Everybody.

3281
02:19:51,591 --> 02:19:53,360
I'm saying that like we're in a position
to do it.

3282
02:19:53,361 --> 02:19:55,190
That's why I think this is a good thing.
Well,

3283
02:19:55,191 --> 02:19:57,290
everybody can't.
I look.

3284
02:19:57,291 --> 02:19:59,300
Wow.
That's ridiculous.

3285
02:19:59,301 --> 02:20:01,280
Yeah.
That's like 2000.

3286
02:20:03,590 --> 02:20:05,390
It's weird that you decided to use that 
picture.

3287
02:20:05,420 --> 02:20:06,890
Maybe he's trying to fuck with you.
He was.

3288
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:07,890
Oh,
absolutely let you know.

3289
02:20:07,940 --> 02:20:09,260
He did.
I didn't tell you what he did.

3290
02:20:09,290 --> 02:20:12,380
This is so fucking funny.
So this is it.

3291
02:20:12,410 --> 02:20:14,390
This is what I was going to tell you.
Congrats on the new house.

3292
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:17,900
The Rock Burger really get a package 
from the rock.

3293
02:20:17,990 --> 02:20:20,710
Burnt.
Burt sent me a bicycler set.

3294
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:23,450
Burns Chrysler sent me a box of cookies 
and that,

3295
02:20:23,451 --> 02:20:27,560
that was the card because he's tagged 
the rock on a few things in the rock.

3296
02:20:27,590 --> 02:20:31,310
Has retweeted it and mentioned him and 
he told me about it.

3297
02:20:31,311 --> 02:20:33,320
So then he sent me a box of cookies to 
the house.

3298
02:20:33,380 --> 02:20:35,480
And it said congrats on the new house,
the rock.

3299
02:20:35,810 --> 02:20:40,810
So that was,
that was trying to fuck with me having 

3300
02:20:40,810 --> 02:20:41,670
me eat cookies and that it's coming.
It's coming from the Rock John.

3301
02:20:41,780 --> 02:20:43,550
So I gave them away immediately.
Good for you,

3302
02:20:44,050 --> 02:20:45,020
man.
Good for you.

3303
02:20:45,170 --> 02:20:46,130
Yeah,
we're in a battle dude.

3304
02:20:46,250 --> 02:20:46,730
Yeah.
I,

3305
02:20:46,731 --> 02:20:49,280
uh,
I eat sugar free pudding.

3306
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:51,640
I don't know.
No,

3307
02:20:52,310 --> 02:20:53,480
I ever.
Every time I eat them,

3308
02:20:53,481 --> 02:20:56,180
I'm just going to fucking trick my body 
with the sugar free pudding.

3309
02:20:56,560 --> 02:20:58,790
It's got high protein,
high protein sugar.

3310
02:20:58,791 --> 02:21:03,560
If you're putting either something that 
it does to your ass.

3311
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:05,960
Oh really?
There's something that happens.

3312
02:21:06,060 --> 02:21:08,860
It's kind of mixes up with real food.
Yeah.

3313
02:21:09,560 --> 02:21:12,340
It's a gang fight,
which we fucking sugar fruit.

3314
02:21:12,350 --> 02:21:13,980
Maybe I'm eating the wrong card.
I don't know.

3315
02:21:14,050 --> 02:21:17,240
Maybe there's a good one.
Dumps left her less horrific in the last

3316
02:21:17,241 --> 02:21:18,440
30 days for sure.
Sure.

3317
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:19,070
Yeah.
Well,

3318
02:21:19,071 --> 02:21:22,460
the more salad you eat,
the more it's going to be real smooth.

3319
02:21:22,550 --> 02:21:24,170
Yeah.
That's a big one with people.

3320
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:25,880
People that just eat meat,
man.

3321
02:21:25,881 --> 02:21:27,350
You doing your body a disservice.

3322
02:21:27,690 --> 02:21:32,690
You got to eat a lot of vegetables.
So important people don't want to do it 

3323
02:21:32,690 --> 02:21:36,941
because God dammit,
if you've got a cheeseburger with blue 

3324
02:21:36,941 --> 02:21:39,221
cheese on it,
you see the blood just kinda like 

3325
02:21:39,221 --> 02:21:39,440
dripping onto the bond.
Put some Jalapenos on that budget.

3326
02:21:39,490 --> 02:21:44,490
Fit maybe some age,
some thick fucking dark red is some 

3327
02:21:45,350 --> 02:21:50,350
juicy iceberg lettuce and you want to 
get busy with that cheeseburger for 

3328
02:21:50,350 --> 02:21:50,870
sure.
That's my favorite,

3329
02:21:50,871 --> 02:21:55,871
I think.
I think you should need to half one to 

3330
02:21:55,871 --> 02:21:58,500
take it from me.
The guy who eats three meals to see to 

3331
02:21:58,500 --> 02:21:58,500
have a cheeseburger.
Just put it away.

3332
02:21:58,500 --> 02:21:58,640
Yeah,
eat a salad.

3333
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:01,220
Sounds good.
I like salad.

3334
02:22:01,250 --> 02:22:02,320
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.

3335
02:22:02,330 --> 02:22:04,190
I'm going on it man.
Do you ever do Kale shakes?

3336
02:22:04,700 --> 02:22:06,080
No.
Time to step it up.

3337
02:22:06,230 --> 02:22:07,880
Step it up the Kale shake.
Step up your game.

3338
02:22:07,881 --> 02:22:12,881
Let's make a video video.
I'll bring the ingredients over to your 

3339
02:22:12,881 --> 02:22:14,720
house and I'll bring you a blendtec 
blender as a house warming gift.

3340
02:22:14,750 --> 02:22:16,700
Shit,
you need one of these days.

3341
02:22:16,740 --> 02:22:21,740
We're going to do.
I'm going to show you how to make them 

3342
02:22:21,740 --> 02:22:21,740
too.
They taste good and then I'm gonna.

3343
02:22:21,740 --> 02:22:22,910
Show you how I do it.
It just tastes like shit.

3344
02:22:23,060 --> 02:22:25,070
Brutal.
They're brutal,

3345
02:22:25,380 --> 02:22:26,070
but I

3346
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:28,730
swear to God you'll,
you'll drink this and you'll.

3347
02:22:28,790 --> 02:22:33,790
You'll want to run up the side of a 
fucking mountain and punch a mountain 

3348
02:22:33,790 --> 02:22:33,790
lion right in the day.
You eat this every morning.

3349
02:22:34,370 --> 02:22:35,160
No,
no,

3350
02:22:35,260 --> 02:22:35,620
no,
no,

3351
02:22:35,621 --> 02:22:38,850
no.
I don't think it's smart to eat a lot of

3352
02:22:39,150 --> 02:22:44,150
the same things all the time.
I think it's good to mix it up a little 

3353
02:22:44,150 --> 02:22:45,720
bit,
but when I do do it as I feel it,

3354
02:22:45,900 --> 02:22:48,860
I mean I always drink like you saw him 
when I came in here.

3355
02:22:48,861 --> 02:22:50,620
I was eating a big salad.
Always eat salads,

3356
02:22:50,650 --> 02:22:55,620
a lot of vegetables,
but the amount of nutrition that you get

3357
02:22:55,650 --> 02:22:57,330
the Kale shake,
like think about like,

3358
02:22:57,450 --> 02:22:58,800
this is what I take.
This is my recipe.

3359
02:22:58,801 --> 02:23:01,680
I take four big stocks of Kale for.
Yeah,

3360
02:23:01,681 --> 02:23:03,410
for chop that shit up top,
top,

3361
02:23:03,420 --> 02:23:03,710
top,
top,

3362
02:23:03,711 --> 02:23:04,030
top,
top,

3363
02:23:04,031 --> 02:23:06,270
top.
Then I'd take a cucumber chop that bench

3364
02:23:06,271 --> 02:23:06,570
top,
top,

3365
02:23:06,571 --> 02:23:06,840
top,
top.

3366
02:23:06,840 --> 02:23:07,140
Trump,
trump,

3367
02:23:07,141 --> 02:23:07,470
trump,
trump.

3368
02:23:07,650 --> 02:23:10,890
Then I take a giant chunk of ginger,
giant,

3369
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:14,790
like almost like a pager,
like a half a pager,

3370
02:23:14,850 --> 02:23:16,080
like a half a pagers.
Good.

3371
02:23:16,470 --> 02:23:18,570
Throw that bitch in there,
four cloves of garlic,

3372
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:22,590
get it for four cloves and I used to go 
with a full pair,

3373
02:23:22,591 --> 02:23:25,220
but then I go with a half a pair now.
Now I go half a pair.

3374
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:29,520
You'll get that immediately led should.
It should be part of the font.

3375
02:23:29,910 --> 02:23:33,360
Then on top of that for stalks of celery
or two,

3376
02:23:33,361 --> 02:23:37,020
excuse me,
two stalks of celery and then mct oil.

3377
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:42,200
Mct Oil is important because in order 
for you to buy your body to accurately 

3378
02:23:42,241 --> 02:23:47,241
process,
like to get the most like more 

3379
02:23:47,241 --> 02:23:49,371
efficiently process vitamins you want 
want them to be attached to fats and a 

3380
02:23:49,371 --> 02:23:50,830
lot of cases,
a lot of different vitamins or flight.

3381
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:56,720
Your body absorbs better with fat and 
mct oil is a healthy fat and it's.

3382
02:23:56,970 --> 02:24:00,060
It's good for brain function.
A lot of other things.

3383
02:24:00,330 --> 02:24:05,330
That's where it gets tricky.
You can't put too much because if you 

3384
02:24:05,330 --> 02:24:05,920
put too much in here,
asshole,

3385
02:24:06,010 --> 02:24:10,140
well really just protests.
Protests.

3386
02:24:10,180 --> 02:24:15,180
It goes on a riot.
You go on an asshole riot like I've had 

3387
02:24:15,180 --> 02:24:15,990
some asshole riots were you,
you?

3388
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:19,890
You're walking towards the bathroom and 
all the sudden out of nowhere,

3389
02:24:19,891 --> 02:24:21,490
like you have to take a shit and you go 
like,

3390
02:24:21,491 --> 02:24:23,040
oh well I'll go in the bathroom and 
you're like,

3391
02:24:23,070 --> 02:24:24,510
oh my God,
I'm not going to make it.

3392
02:24:24,660 --> 02:24:26,340
Like you see the bathroom.
Be like,

3393
02:24:26,740 --> 02:24:27,450
Whoa,
Whoa,

3394
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:29,760
whoa.
I don't know what the number is.

3395
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:34,070
But to me caution,
err on the side of caution with uh,

3396
02:24:34,130 --> 02:24:39,130
with the mct oil,
maybe just a couple of tablespoons full 

3397
02:24:39,130 --> 02:24:39,130
of fish oil,
you know,

3398
02:24:39,130 --> 02:24:41,580
like there's this restaurant that used 
to go to on the east side,

3399
02:24:42,180 --> 02:24:46,260
Don Felix Peruvian place and they would 
make this dish called Palo,

3400
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:51,320
which is so hard for that.

3401
02:24:51,390 --> 02:24:52,920
Sounds like you should be on Narcos,
man.

3402
02:24:52,921 --> 02:24:57,921
It's a heart.
It's a fucking traditional Peruvian 

3403
02:24:57,921 --> 02:24:57,921
dish.
Which meat?

3404
02:24:57,921 --> 02:24:58,420
Potato,
like chopped up fries.

3405
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:00,570
Basically tomatoes,
Rice.

3406
02:25:00,660 --> 02:25:04,470
But they would oil like make it on a pan
with lots of oil.

3407
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:09,030
I used to be able to fart song,
like with total control,

3408
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:10,070
you know,
it could be like bro,

3409
02:25:10,150 --> 02:25:10,550
bro,
bro,

3410
02:25:10,590 --> 02:25:11,350
bro,
Bro.

3411
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:16,110
Because of so much oil in my system,
it's probably really good for you.

3412
02:25:16,470 --> 02:25:17,650
Yeah.
Fuck you gotta.

3413
02:25:17,670 --> 02:25:22,670
Try this man.
I'll take it to this place if you want 

3414
02:25:22,670 --> 02:25:24,741
to go.
Did you see that article that was 

3415
02:25:24,741 --> 02:25:27,081
released that showed that the sugar 
companies in the 19 fifties were bing 

3416
02:25:28,030 --> 02:25:30,460
scientists to report?
Yes.

3417
02:25:30,461 --> 02:25:35,461
It was saturated fat that was causing 
people to get sick and have heart 

3418
02:25:35,461 --> 02:25:35,461
attacks.
Don't flesh.

3419
02:25:35,461 --> 02:25:38,290
That was the fifties or sixties and 
they've been.

3420
02:25:38,440 --> 02:25:41,200
We've been saying that ever since,
so 50 years ago,

3421
02:25:41,530 --> 02:25:42,430
someone lied.

3422
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:47,640
Look at that in that.
It's crazy because all these years 

3423
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:51,600
people have like automatically connected
saturated fat and heart disease,

3424
02:25:52,510 --> 02:25:55,690
saturated fat and all these problems,
but there's,

3425
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:59,210
there's like a need that your body has 
for saturated fat.

3426
02:25:59,540 --> 02:26:03,520
A lot of these scientists that did this,
they just fucking lied.

3427
02:26:04,090 --> 02:26:09,090
They were paid off by the sugar industry
to make it seem like saturated fat was 

3428
02:26:09,090 --> 02:26:10,420
what's fucking people up.
However,

3429
02:26:10,630 --> 02:26:13,090
someone just sent me.
I'm Dr Rhonda.

3430
02:26:13,091 --> 02:26:16,780
Patrick actually just sent me something,
an article that,

3431
02:26:16,870 --> 02:26:21,870
um,
there's a new study that came out that 

3432
02:26:21,870 --> 02:26:24,091
shows that the real problem they think 
now with saturated fats is when 

3433
02:26:24,551 --> 02:26:28,360
saturated fats are mixed with processed 
foods,

3434
02:26:28,930 --> 02:26:33,930
processed foods.
And saturated fats together as a 

3435
02:26:33,930 --> 02:26:33,930
combination like pos,
processed sugars,

3436
02:26:34,330 --> 02:26:39,330
and things along those lines,
and mixed with saturated fats can be 

3437
02:26:39,330 --> 02:26:39,330
very bad for you.
Right?

3438
02:26:39,330 --> 02:26:43,150
So it's just you can go on the fat kick 
but don't mix it with that sugar.

3439
02:26:43,210 --> 02:26:44,530
Right.
But even when we were talking about this

3440
02:26:44,531 --> 02:26:49,531
before the podcast or we're.
We're talking about beginning of the 

3441
02:26:49,531 --> 02:26:49,531
podcast,
the protein thing was before,

3442
02:26:49,531 --> 02:26:51,340
before it was you,
you saw.

3443
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:54,730
It's all moderation is all balanced.
Like you can't have too much protein.

3444
02:26:55,150 --> 02:26:57,520
If you eat too much protein,
your body starts to convert it to sugar.

3445
02:26:57,670 --> 02:27:02,670
Dude,
that's what I was doing with meat all 

3446
02:27:02,670 --> 02:27:02,670
the time.
Yeah,

3447
02:27:02,670 --> 02:27:05,820
I think way too big a portions and then 
you see like what a recommended portion 

3448
02:27:06,671 --> 02:27:07,610
of this and then you go,
you're like,

3449
02:27:07,660 --> 02:27:09,100
oh,
that's not bad.

3450
02:27:09,101 --> 02:27:11,670
That's normal.
I was just eating too much of it to your

3451
02:27:11,760 --> 02:27:16,760
protein.
You want to be on like if you want to 

3452
02:27:16,760 --> 02:27:19,231
do,
you're trying to do a fat burning 

3453
02:27:19,231 --> 02:27:19,420
ketogenetic diets.
I think they say it's 75 percent,

3454
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:24,680
75 percent fats and then the rest is 
like 20 percent proteins,

3455
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:26,180
like five percent carbs,
right?

3456
02:27:26,190 --> 02:27:26,520
Yeah,
yeah,

3457
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:27,000
yeah.
That's right.

3458
02:27:27,010 --> 02:27:27,760
Something.
Is that what it is?

3459
02:27:27,761 --> 02:27:28,510
That's about it.
Yes.

3460
02:27:28,570 --> 02:27:29,830
Somewhere around,
around those numbers.

3461
02:27:29,831 --> 02:27:34,831
But um,
we have one of those grab one of those 

3462
02:27:34,831 --> 02:27:34,831
mile plex bags,
Jamie that we got in the back.

3463
02:27:34,930 --> 02:27:36,870
There's this new company,
not new companies,

3464
02:27:36,940 --> 02:27:40,090
old ass company.
They've been around forever that make a,

3465
02:27:40,500 --> 02:27:42,760
I have no affiliation with these people 
and there's no ad.

3466
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:44,290
It's like a friendly powder.
Yeah.

3467
02:27:44,291 --> 02:27:48,970
They make a like a pack and it's a Keto 
meal that you could like shake it.

3468
02:27:48,971 --> 02:27:51,610
Like if you're on the go and you don't 
want to fuck up and eat something.

3469
02:27:51,670 --> 02:27:52,700
See?
Yup.

3470
02:27:53,590 --> 02:27:54,730
I ordered these.
Yeah,

3471
02:27:54,940 --> 02:27:56,890
I got a sensitive don't they?
They don't taste bad,

3472
02:27:56,891 --> 02:27:59,680
so it's like 75 percent fat.
Twenty percent protein.

3473
02:27:59,681 --> 02:28:02,350
Five percent by the way,
it's a lot of powder.

3474
02:28:02,710 --> 02:28:05,380
If you try to put this in a ounces,
it's a fucking ton.

3475
02:28:05,410 --> 02:28:10,410
Yeah.
I put it in one of those Yeti tumblers 

3476
02:28:10,410 --> 02:28:10,410
and I'm a mixed it up with carbonated 
water,

3477
02:28:10,410 --> 02:28:10,540
like an asshole.
Oh really?

3478
02:28:10,590 --> 02:28:12,160
Yeah.
I was still stupid.

3479
02:28:12,161 --> 02:28:13,540
I.
Did you find that in there?

3480
02:28:13,570 --> 02:28:15,990
Did you see the Mug in there?
Um,

3481
02:28:16,210 --> 02:28:21,210
I uh,
got this new soda from this company 

3482
02:28:21,210 --> 02:28:21,480
called [inaudible].
Have you ever had that shit?

3483
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:23,150
Big Ad.
That's not an ad.

3484
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:26,990
It's a,
they make soda with Stevia.

3485
02:28:27,660 --> 02:28:28,220
Oh,
okay.

3486
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:33,280
So they have soda.
They have like energy drinks and then 

3487
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:33,650
they have this sparkling water says it's
good.

3488
02:28:33,990 --> 02:28:35,120
It's good.
I like Stevia.

3489
02:28:35,270 --> 02:28:40,270
If you like the flavor of Stevia,
it's good because it's kind of got to 

3490
02:28:40,270 --> 02:28:40,920
like a flavor to it,
but it doesn't fuck with you,

3491
02:28:40,970 --> 02:28:43,940
you know,
like I still love a coca cola.

3492
02:28:43,941 --> 02:28:46,460
I mean I know it's kind of syrupy and 
fucked up,

3493
02:28:46,461 --> 02:28:48,710
but you're eating ribs,
you know,

3494
02:28:48,770 --> 02:28:50,010
nothing better.
Come on son.

3495
02:28:50,100 --> 02:28:53,210
So that's one of them's a peach and one 
of them is alive.

3496
02:28:53,240 --> 02:28:56,870
Those are the sparkling water ones.
So those are like very,

3497
02:28:56,871 --> 02:28:59,450
very mild.
And they have other ones that are like a

3498
02:28:59,451 --> 02:29:01,590
soda.
I'm gonna try one can open,

3499
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,680
done,
get down with it.

3500
02:29:03,681 --> 02:29:05,600
Tommy pass me one of those bitches.

3501
02:29:05,640 --> 02:29:09,110
They got passed to try and I'm trying 
mandarin orange.

3502
02:29:09,111 --> 02:29:10,190
I'm giving you lyme.
But.

3503
02:29:10,480 --> 02:29:12,620
And again this is not an ad folks,
so I don't,

3504
02:29:14,570 --> 02:29:19,070
but I think thanks to these super 
important to just try just.

3505
02:29:19,071 --> 02:29:24,020
I mean even if it's a one time for a bet
like Tommy's doing it not bad,

3506
02:29:24,440 --> 02:29:26,630
just try to be healthy.
Try.

3507
02:29:26,660 --> 02:29:27,350
Yeah,
try.

3508
02:29:27,460 --> 02:29:28,340
Goddammit.
You'll feel better.

3509
02:29:28,850 --> 02:29:32,420
That's the thing is ultimately,
even if you don't get to like some crazy

3510
02:29:32,421 --> 02:29:35,300
level with your fantasy level of it,
you're still,

3511
02:29:36,320 --> 02:29:39,020
you're still doing better than you were.
You still will feel better.

3512
02:29:39,140 --> 02:29:40,400
You want to get down with the hulk 
loads?

3513
02:29:40,670 --> 02:29:42,350
Yeah man,
I'm going to trust a Kale shake.

3514
02:29:42,351 --> 02:29:43,790
It's called the local clothes.
I remember.

3515
02:29:43,850 --> 02:29:45,830
I've heard that.
You got to try them.

3516
02:29:46,130 --> 02:29:48,020
You're going to drink it and you go holy
Shit.

3517
02:29:48,040 --> 02:29:50,270
Cause you have to kind of chew it as 
you're swallowing it.

3518
02:29:50,840 --> 02:29:55,840
It's like a sludgy sort of a thing that 
kind of choke it down and then we'll 

3519
02:29:56,601 --> 02:29:57,770
work out.
We'll make a video.

3520
02:29:57,830 --> 02:30:02,830
Okay.
We'll do it and then we'll like 45 

3521
02:30:02,830 --> 02:30:02,830
minutes later we'll work out.
You're going to be like,

3522
02:30:02,830 --> 02:30:04,020
Holy Shit.
Do I feel good?

3523
02:30:04,670 --> 02:30:06,470
A heavy bag.
I got that.

3524
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:07,610
Okay,
let's do that.

3525
02:30:07,910 --> 02:30:10,100
I got heck squats.
Let's do that shit.

3526
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:12,470
Ripped a elliptical.
How about we'll do that and then I'll do

3527
02:30:12,471 --> 02:30:14,030
your podcast.
Let's do it.

3528
02:30:14,300 --> 02:30:15,620
Switch it up.
Let's do it.

3529
02:30:15,650 --> 02:30:17,110
Are you guys up and running?
And the new spa?

3530
02:30:17,111 --> 02:30:18,110
Yeah.
Oh Shit.

3531
02:30:18,150 --> 02:30:19,600
Oh Shit.
Yeah.

3532
02:30:19,670 --> 02:30:20,960
You enjoying it?
Love it.

3533
02:30:21,470 --> 02:30:23,720
Do you guys stream live?
No.

3534
02:30:23,900 --> 02:30:28,900
Do you?
You make videos and then you put it up 

3535
02:30:28,900 --> 02:30:28,900
later.
We have,

3536
02:30:28,900 --> 02:30:28,900
we,
we have cameras.

3537
02:30:28,900 --> 02:30:30,530
We've had two cameras set up one camera 
setup,

3538
02:30:30,650 --> 02:30:35,650
um,
where I give it to an editor afterwards 

3539
02:30:35,650 --> 02:30:35,650
and he,
um,

3540
02:30:35,650 --> 02:30:37,810
he just layers up the uh,
the,

3541
02:30:37,930 --> 02:30:42,930
you know,
the high quality audio with the video 

3542
02:30:42,930 --> 02:30:42,930
later.

3543
02:30:42,930 --> 02:30:44,270
What we put it up,
it goes up every Tuesday night.

3544
02:30:44,870 --> 02:30:46,310
Okay.
So tonight when will go up?

3545
02:30:46,370 --> 02:30:48,260
So are you guys doing one a week now?
Are you doing.

3546
02:30:48,360 --> 02:30:50,000
It's one a week every single year.
We do.

3547
02:30:50,001 --> 02:30:55,001
I mean it's pretty.
It sounds funny because we've talked 

3548
02:30:55,001 --> 02:30:55,001
about like,
fucking,

3549
02:30:55,001 --> 02:30:55,850
it feels like there's not time to do 
anything,

3550
02:30:55,940 --> 02:30:57,620
you know,
like we feel like it's a lot to get that

3551
02:30:57,621 --> 02:31:00,590
one done and there is a lot of 
production and that like,

3552
02:31:00,650 --> 02:31:05,650
you know,
we play the clips and there's all that 

3553
02:31:05,650 --> 02:31:07,930
stuff that goes into it and then we'll 
talk about one is as demanding on us and

3554
02:31:08,841 --> 02:31:09,920
then we were like,
oh,

3555
02:31:09,921 --> 02:31:12,830
Joe did three,
three and a half hour ones this week.

3556
02:31:12,970 --> 02:31:17,970
Yeah.
But I'm super sloppy and I don't plan 

3557
02:31:17,970 --> 02:31:17,970
out.
Well,

3558
02:31:17,970 --> 02:31:17,970
I'm just saying,
you know,

3559
02:31:17,970 --> 02:31:19,860
it ends up being,
they're totally in the end.

3560
02:31:19,861 --> 02:31:20,580
Like,
you know,

3561
02:31:20,990 --> 02:31:21,420
show is.

3562
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:23,430
But yeah,
we do the one consistently.

3563
02:31:23,550 --> 02:31:25,340
Every single you have a show.
Yeah.

3564
02:31:25,400 --> 02:31:30,400
Do you mean your show is a real show?
This is like a recording of a 

3565
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:30,750
conversation.
That's true.

3566
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:32,460
That's true.
So you guys have like,

3567
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:36,090
you have like a bunch of shit going on 
that happens over and over again.

3568
02:31:36,091 --> 02:31:37,470
You have games you play.
Absolutely.

3569
02:31:37,530 --> 02:31:37,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

3570
02:31:37,951 --> 02:31:39,390
It's a different animal.
You're totally right.

3571
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:40,710
Um,
but yeah,

3572
02:31:40,740 --> 02:31:45,740
it,
I love the new studio space is fucking 

3573
02:31:45,740 --> 02:31:45,740
gorgeous.
We a film composers house,

3574
02:31:45,740 --> 02:31:48,200
so he used to score movies there and 
when he got,

3575
02:31:48,230 --> 02:31:53,230
we have this much too nice a studio for,
for where we're doing our part show.

3576
02:31:53,850 --> 02:31:56,700
Do you guys have the kind of internet 
where you could stream at a high level?

3577
02:31:56,880 --> 02:31:57,660
Uh,
yeah.

3578
02:31:57,661 --> 02:31:58,580
If we went,
um,

3579
02:31:58,680 --> 02:31:59,550
if we,
if we,

3580
02:31:59,551 --> 02:32:00,660
uh,
went hardwire.

3581
02:32:00,690 --> 02:32:01,470
Yeah,
we could do that.

3582
02:32:01,530 --> 02:32:01,830
Sure.

3583
02:32:02,460 --> 02:32:04,890
Yeah.
There's some benefit to that,

3584
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:07,920
like there's a benefit to that if 
anything is getting wacky.

3585
02:32:08,120 --> 02:32:08,910
Yeah.
You know,

3586
02:32:08,911 --> 02:32:11,730
in the world maybe you want to live.
Yeah.

3587
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:17,120
Like Duncan and I,
once we streamed the president 

3588
02:32:17,120 --> 02:32:17,840
addressing the country.
Do you still do ustream?

3589
02:32:18,430 --> 02:32:20,030
Oh No,
we just do youtube.

3590
02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:21,750
We're doing youtube right now.
Is Youtube live?

3591
02:32:21,810 --> 02:32:22,250
Yeah.
Okay.

3592
02:32:22,410 --> 02:32:25,710
Yeah,
it was just more versatile and it didn't

3593
02:32:25,711 --> 02:32:26,730
mess up as much.
We hit,

3594
02:32:26,731 --> 02:32:28,320
we had problems.
Yeah.

3595
02:32:28,590 --> 02:32:30,650
But I think ustream is better now,
but they're,

3596
02:32:30,660 --> 02:32:31,520
you know,
they're always up,

3597
02:32:31,810 --> 02:32:32,760
you know,
upgrading.

3598
02:32:32,761 --> 02:32:35,250
And it was great though.
I mean it's still,

3599
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:37,800
it allowed us to do this in the first 
place,

3600
02:32:37,801 --> 02:32:42,801
but also it's just a president for more 
used by people.

3601
02:32:44,040 --> 02:32:45,770
Sure.
So we watched,

3602
02:32:45,771 --> 02:32:47,340
uh,
the president talk about Syria,

3603
02:32:47,670 --> 02:32:52,670
like Duncan and I watched it live and we
were talking about it live while it was 

3604
02:32:52,670 --> 02:32:52,890
happening,
almost like a fight companion.

3605
02:32:52,890 --> 02:32:54,180
Sure.
Presidential address.

3606
02:32:54,900 --> 02:32:57,750
And it was just real weird man,
because Viken pains are massive.

3607
02:32:57,751 --> 02:32:59,010
Right.
If those go nuts,

3608
02:32:59,790 --> 02:33:00,830
those are fun as hell.
Yeah.

3609
02:33:00,980 --> 02:33:02,280
This is a really fun to do.
Yeah.

3610
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:05,310
But every time we do them,
Eddie Bravo gets drunk and wants to talk

3611
02:33:05,311 --> 02:33:08,220
about the Illuminati.
That's like half the fun of it.

3612
02:33:08,221 --> 02:33:10,890
The conversation goes everywhere.
The conversation goes everywhere.

3613
02:33:10,891 --> 02:33:13,650
But Eddie Bravo will always bring it 
around to conspiracy theories.

3614
02:33:13,710 --> 02:33:15,810
He loves it.
Is he still onto the chem trails?

3615
02:33:15,811 --> 02:33:16,770
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

3616
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:19,080
Aerosol spraying,
spraying,

3617
02:33:19,650 --> 02:33:20,340
which,
you know,

3618
02:33:20,550 --> 02:33:24,300
it's probably been done somewhere at one
point in time for sure.

3619
02:33:24,360 --> 02:33:25,470
Listen,
100 percent,

3620
02:33:25,770 --> 02:33:28,290
someone went on a plane and dumped some 
shit out of the plane.

3621
02:33:28,530 --> 02:33:29,610
Yeah,
for sure.

3622
02:33:29,940 --> 02:33:34,940
For sure.
The government's done it somewhere for 

3623
02:33:34,940 --> 02:33:34,940
sure.
For sure.

3624
02:33:34,940 --> 02:33:39,380
There's probably some evil agency 
somewhere that has decided to fucking 

3625
02:33:39,540 --> 02:33:41,020
test out some shit on people.
Yep.

3626
02:33:41,500 --> 02:33:43,890
And there's been stuff that's been 
proven that's been done,

3627
02:33:43,891 --> 02:33:48,891
like I want to say it was either Detroit
or Chicago,

3628
02:33:50,071 --> 02:33:51,810
I forget what it was,
but they,

3629
02:33:51,811 --> 02:33:56,811
um,
they sprayed some particles that they 

3630
02:33:56,811 --> 02:34:00,291
could track,
they sprayed into the air and the city 

3631
02:34:00,291 --> 02:34:00,291
to,
uh,

3632
02:34:00,291 --> 02:34:05,090
determine what kind of impact a bomb.
Like a dirty bomb.

3633
02:34:06,450 --> 02:34:07,060
Yes.
Alright.

3634
02:34:07,110 --> 02:34:09,870
Allowed biological warfare,
something along those lines.

3635
02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:13,260
Either a nuclear nuclear fallout or 
biological warfare,

3636
02:34:13,261 --> 02:34:16,390
like how far it would travel given like 
a certain amount of wind.

3637
02:34:16,391 --> 02:34:18,040
So I think they actually like use

3638
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:21,160
giant fans and shit and blew some stuff 
in there and then tracked it.

3639
02:34:21,190 --> 02:34:24,430
But let's see how many people get sick.
How did that though they didn't,

3640
02:34:24,460 --> 02:34:25,000
they didn't,
they?

3641
02:34:25,001 --> 02:34:25,410
No,
no,

3642
02:34:25,411 --> 02:34:25,750
no,
no.

3643
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:28,780
That's where the misconception is.
I think what they did was a truck,

3644
02:34:28,930 --> 02:34:32,650
they used a trackable particle because 
they wanted to figure out how much.

3645
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:37,920
The only way to find out,
let's say the wind is blowing 20 miles 

3646
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:40,741
an hour,
some shake gets blown up 200 miles or 

3647
02:34:40,741 --> 02:34:43,120
200 feet rather above the buildings.
How far is it going to spread?

3648
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:45,160
You know,
if you're looking at that,

3649
02:34:45,310 --> 02:34:47,380
the only way to tell us to try out 
something.

3650
02:34:47,381 --> 02:34:52,381
So they took some sort of,
I think it was like a reflective 

3651
02:34:52,381 --> 02:34:52,960
particle or traceable particle.
So conspiracy theories,

3652
02:34:53,350 --> 02:34:58,350
theories always pointed that as being 
like proof that they have done that on 

3653
02:34:58,350 --> 02:34:58,390
innocent people.

3654
02:34:58,440 --> 02:34:59,560
Sure.
Which they definitely did.

3655
02:34:59,940 --> 02:35:04,940
I mean,
I don't know what happened to those 

3656
02:35:04,940 --> 02:35:06,031
people,
but she had happens to people all the 

3657
02:35:06,031 --> 02:35:06,310
time.
If you're too close to this or too close

3658
02:35:06,311 --> 02:35:07,780
to that and then they find out,
oh yeah,

3659
02:35:07,781 --> 02:35:08,850
that kills you.
Turns out,

3660
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:10,840
turns out you can't do that.
Yeah.

3661
02:35:11,110 --> 02:35:12,790
Unreal.
Turns out you can't eat paint.

3662
02:35:13,740 --> 02:35:15,750
A lot of people do dumb shit.
Yeah.

3663
02:35:15,980 --> 02:35:16,810
Yeah.
Dude.

3664
02:35:16,811 --> 02:35:21,811
Did you see that video I put up with 
that kid doing the fucking front flip 

3665
02:35:21,811 --> 02:35:24,420
over this gigantic overpass.
I saw you have some dude on top of a 

3666
02:35:24,420 --> 02:35:25,540
building doing retarded shit.
I've done though.

3667
02:35:25,570 --> 02:35:27,520
I mean I put those up.
I put them up every time I can,

3668
02:35:27,521 --> 02:35:31,360
but I,
I posted this one of this fucking kid.

3669
02:35:31,510 --> 02:35:36,510
He goes running up to the side of this 
edge and then flips over this impossible

3670
02:35:36,971 --> 02:35:38,170
distance.
I mean,

3671
02:35:38,171 --> 02:35:40,480
it's fucking impossible.
How far he runs.

3672
02:35:40,481 --> 02:35:43,800
Watch this.
Oh my God.

3673
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:46,420
Come on.
Yup.

3674
02:35:46,600 --> 02:35:49,360
That's not really 100 percent real real.
Don't look at them.

3675
02:35:49,370 --> 02:35:49,750
Do it

3676
02:35:54,320 --> 02:35:59,320
dude.
He did a front flip over a and that's 

3677
02:35:59,320 --> 02:35:59,320
death.
Like if you missed,

3678
02:35:59,320 --> 02:36:01,100
that's death.
You hit that concrete.

3679
02:36:01,101 --> 02:36:02,460
You break your legs.
That's dead.

3680
02:36:02,480 --> 02:36:06,830
Fuck me man.
These kids are crazy.

3681
02:36:06,950 --> 02:36:11,950
They're doing the nuttiest shit lately.
It's like white people are trying to 

3682
02:36:11,950 --> 02:36:12,380
evolve.
They're trying.

3683
02:36:12,410 --> 02:36:17,410
Why?
People are trying to trying to get like 

3684
02:36:17,410 --> 02:36:19,510
crazier and fast,
Bro.

3685
02:36:19,610 --> 02:36:21,340
We need our edge.
Why?

3686
02:36:21,341 --> 02:36:26,341
People are doing ridiculous things.
Has got the numbers blacks have there 

3687
02:36:26,341 --> 02:36:30,310
because this guy,
he's riding a rail over the side of a 

3688
02:36:30,310 --> 02:36:32,960
bridge and the wind is blowing and he's 
on a bike.

3689
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:39,140
Why in the fuck is going through your 
mind while you are risking certain death

3690
02:36:40,041 --> 02:36:42,860
just slightly to the left of you and 
you're writing on it.

3691
02:36:42,910 --> 02:36:45,140
What does that three inches.
How wide is that?

3692
02:36:45,260 --> 02:36:50,260
Three inches.
About size of your Dick and about three 

3693
02:36:50,260 --> 02:36:50,260
inches.

3694
02:36:50,260 --> 02:36:50,260
I'm aware of to in Jersey.
Yeah.

3695
02:36:50,260 --> 02:36:51,080
No,
I'm definitely thinner.

3696
02:36:51,690 --> 02:36:56,690
I'm thin and curly like a duck stick.
Man Goes around and around.

3697
02:36:57,770 --> 02:36:59,520
Have you ever seen a domestic?
Uh,

3698
02:36:59,770 --> 02:37:01,010
haven't.
I think I've seen the pigs.

3699
02:37:01,011 --> 02:37:03,040
Dick Ducks,
ducks.

3700
02:37:03,140 --> 02:37:06,080
My friend Andrea is Antonopoulos is 
bitcoin expert.

3701
02:37:06,081 --> 02:37:09,200
Explained to me about Duck Dick's.
He gave me slightly wrong information.

3702
02:37:09,201 --> 02:37:14,201
He said there were like four feet long.
It turns out they are about 13 inches 

3703
02:37:14,201 --> 02:37:14,201
long now.
It's a big old Dick.

3704
02:37:14,201 --> 02:37:15,050
Big Hog.
Yeah.

3705
02:37:15,110 --> 02:37:20,110
Yeah.
They have these crazy dicks and their 

3706
02:37:20,110 --> 02:37:20,510
dicks or like when they extended out 
there like almost as long as their body.

3707
02:37:20,511 --> 02:37:22,820
It's really weird.
And these ducks,

3708
02:37:22,880 --> 02:37:27,880
they're dicks are twisty and the female 
duck's vagina is like a fucking twisty 

3709
02:37:27,950 --> 02:37:29,330
mountain road.
And I'm like,

3710
02:37:29,331 --> 02:37:34,331
he's gotTa.
Find a way in tick in there and the 

3711
02:37:34,331 --> 02:37:34,730
female can let him in.
That's what their Dick looks like.

3712
02:37:34,900 --> 02:37:36,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

3713
02:37:36,110 --> 02:37:37,580
That's one.
Obviously with no duck,

3714
02:37:38,220 --> 02:37:43,220
it's a homeless stick,
but that's what I believe that not 

3715
02:37:43,220 --> 02:37:45,480
insane.
The pictures of these ducks that,

3716
02:37:45,500 --> 02:37:46,730
that's,
that's a little bit.

3717
02:37:46,900 --> 02:37:51,900
I'm a little bit exaggerated because 
it's an illustration that's a real 

3718
02:37:51,951 --> 02:37:54,440
delicate corkscrew.
That one's obviously he's dead,

3719
02:37:54,441 --> 02:37:59,441
so it's probably not hard,
but it's this crazy weird thing where 

3720
02:37:59,781 --> 02:38:04,781
the male penis has to go through this 
weird kind of twisty turny corridor in 

3721
02:38:06,291 --> 02:38:10,190
the female duck and the female doc can 
decide to let them in or not.

3722
02:38:10,510 --> 02:38:14,580
She just shut them down and they're 
super rapey like,

3723
02:38:15,160 --> 02:38:16,970
look at that one white one on top of the
other one.

3724
02:38:16,971 --> 02:38:18,020
That one bird.
Look at that.

3725
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:19,970
That's really good.
That's what they do.

3726
02:38:19,971 --> 02:38:21,460
They just jack each other.
Yeah.

3727
02:38:21,461 --> 02:38:26,461
It looks like he's talking shit too.
He's right over here and we can look at 

3728
02:38:26,461 --> 02:38:26,461
them and we could say,
oh,

3729
02:38:26,461 --> 02:38:26,660
that's rude.

3730
02:38:26,720 --> 02:38:31,720
That's horrible.
Why don't we stop and pause and realize 

3731
02:38:31,720 --> 02:38:35,800
this is the same fucking kind of animal 
that we just saw swooped down and Jack 

3732
02:38:36,061 --> 02:38:37,970
that other fucking bird right out of a 
tree.

3733
02:38:38,030 --> 02:38:41,580
Look what distance do you think he saw 
that bird from when he decided I will go

3734
02:38:41,581 --> 02:38:43,670
a long way.
They could probably see like a mile that

3735
02:38:43,671 --> 02:38:44,360
far.
Yeah,

3736
02:38:44,361 --> 02:38:46,340
they probably could see ridiculous 
distances.

3737
02:38:46,430 --> 02:38:48,860
There's a lot of animals that could see 
ridiculous distances.

3738
02:38:49,460 --> 02:38:54,460
A Turkey apparently hasn't seen vision.
They see a Turkey ever looked through 

3739
02:38:54,460 --> 02:38:56,080
binoculars like you ever been glass.
And I have,

3740
02:38:56,081 --> 02:38:57,290
I've glass before.
Yeah.

3741
02:38:57,410 --> 02:39:00,640
Well let me give you some glass in 
knowledge.

3742
02:39:00,660 --> 02:39:02,020
Tommy,
your average,

3743
02:39:02,030 --> 02:39:07,030
uh,
the average binoculars had a hunter or 

3744
02:39:07,030 --> 02:39:07,030
sportsmen or a birdwatcher will taking 
the woods.

3745
02:39:07,160 --> 02:39:10,040
Like there's a bunch of varieties for 
hunting.

3746
02:39:10,250 --> 02:39:15,250
Usually people either go with like 10 by
42 or eight by 42.

3747
02:39:15,510 --> 02:39:19,250
It's like eight times the size and 42 is
like the aspect ratio,

3748
02:39:19,251 --> 02:39:24,251
right?
The width of the image that you're 

3749
02:39:24,251 --> 02:39:24,960
looking at a term,
like a good pair of binoculars,

3750
02:39:24,961 --> 02:39:29,961
just like a 10 by 42.
But Turkey naturally sees 20 x.

3751
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:34,460
So a Turkey naturally sees 20 times 
better than you.

3752
02:39:34,850 --> 02:39:35,630
Really?
Yep.

3753
02:39:35,990 --> 02:39:37,310
Yep.
And they see in full color.

3754
02:39:37,790 --> 02:39:39,980
So they could see you,
they see you,

3755
02:39:40,040 --> 02:39:45,040
they see you better than you see you.
So you like literally have to be 

3756
02:39:45,040 --> 02:39:45,040
completely covered up.
If you want to hunt Turkeys,

3757
02:39:45,040 --> 02:39:49,930
you have to cover your face up,
you have to cover your hair on that 

3758
02:39:49,930 --> 02:39:49,930
head.
And look right at you.

3759
02:39:49,930 --> 02:39:50,420
They know this person.
Let me get the fuck out of here.

3760
02:39:50,600 --> 02:39:52,730
Like they see you from way off.
Wow.

3761
02:39:52,830 --> 02:39:54,500
Because Turkey,
the life of a Turkey.

3762
02:39:54,501 --> 02:39:56,960
So brutal Mo.
Most turkeys don't get to be too.

3763
02:39:57,770 --> 02:39:58,430
Most of Them.
Yeah.

3764
02:39:58,431 --> 02:40:01,710
Most of them that survive at all.
Like when they're little coyote jack.

3765
02:40:01,720 --> 02:40:04,730
I'm not that kind of vision.
Insane vision.

3766
02:40:04,760 --> 02:40:05,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

3767
02:40:05,391 --> 02:40:08,000
And saying my vision has been 
deteriorating onto.

3768
02:40:08,480 --> 02:40:09,960
I started wearing reading glasses.
Me too.

3769
02:40:10,130 --> 02:40:11,060
Yeah,
it's brutal.

3770
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:12,260
My dad glasses.
Yeah.

3771
02:40:12,900 --> 02:40:14,610
Yeah.
I just accepted it.

3772
02:40:14,760 --> 02:40:15,210
Yeah,
me too.

3773
02:40:15,211 --> 02:40:16,680
I'm not fighting.
It is what it is.

3774
02:40:16,770 --> 02:40:20,100
Apparently there's some exercises that 
you can do to get better at it,

3775
02:40:20,101 --> 02:40:22,890
but I'm so lazy.
People don't want you to do lasik.

3776
02:40:23,130 --> 02:40:28,130
No,
because lasik doesn't work on soMeone 

3777
02:40:28,130 --> 02:40:29,940
who has macular degeneration.
Like when you get older,

3778
02:40:30,320 --> 02:40:31,290
like you,
the what,

3779
02:40:31,300 --> 02:40:32,790
what you're having.
When you get older,

3780
02:40:32,791 --> 02:40:35,940
when you're losing your close vision,
you know,

3781
02:40:35,941 --> 02:40:36,860
it's like you're,
you're,

3782
02:40:37,070 --> 02:40:39,480
I forget.
Somebody told me the actual term of it.

3783
02:40:39,481 --> 02:40:42,420
Like mY friend steve who's an 
ophthalmologist,

3784
02:40:42,840 --> 02:40:45,930
he actually told me the term of it,
my,

3785
02:40:45,931 --> 02:40:47,370
a macular degeneration.

3786
02:40:47,370 --> 02:40:52,370
Maybe look up treatments for macular 
degeneration and laser therapy is one 

3787
02:40:54,070 --> 02:40:56,650
can have injections.
Google,

3788
02:40:56,670 --> 02:41:01,670
um,
instead of that google near sightedness 

3789
02:41:01,670 --> 02:41:04,701
due to old age and he didn't know the 
solutions with the latest technology is 

3790
02:41:04,701 --> 02:41:06,330
by the way,
for guys are going to give you eyes.

3791
02:41:06,340 --> 02:41:11,340
You can stare straight in the sand.
Phenologist told me he was part of the 

3792
02:41:11,340 --> 02:41:14,340
team that developed it.
They so lenses is corrective lenses into

3793
02:41:14,341 --> 02:41:17,880
your eyes now.
Are you done with that?

3794
02:41:18,090 --> 02:41:20,040
No,
he was just.

3795
02:41:20,340 --> 02:41:21,390
He told me.
I don't know.

3796
02:41:21,391 --> 02:41:22,080
He goes,
you don't need it.

3797
02:41:22,110 --> 02:41:27,110
He goes,
but if you had worse vision is 

3798
02:41:27,110 --> 02:41:27,110
definitely something we could do.
Here's the thing,

3799
02:41:27,110 --> 02:41:28,440
like when you look at it,
something like I see you perfectly.

3800
02:41:29,160 --> 02:41:34,160
I mean if I put glasses on,
like I'll probably see you a little 

3801
02:41:34,160 --> 02:41:35,550
better.
Like let me say a slightly.

3802
02:41:35,770 --> 02:41:38,490
You gotta like a light dullness to you.

3803
02:41:38,670 --> 02:41:41,880
I put the personality wise.
Personality is amazing.

3804
02:41:42,410 --> 02:41:43,620
A lot of people have been shitting on 
you lately.

3805
02:41:43,621 --> 02:41:44,810
I don't know why he,
man.

3806
02:41:45,720 --> 02:41:48,160
That's one of the backhand and fuck with
your head competencies.

3807
02:41:48,200 --> 02:41:49,140
A lot of people say,
you suck.

3808
02:41:49,170 --> 02:41:50,670
I don't agree at aLl.
I think you're amazing.

3809
02:41:50,671 --> 02:41:51,500
I always had like,
hey,

3810
02:41:51,990 --> 02:41:54,620
what the fuck dude?
But I'm up close.

3811
02:41:54,660 --> 02:41:59,660
Big difference.
Like in it at a distance I could see 

3812
02:41:59,660 --> 02:41:59,660
crystal clear like that sign it says on 
air,

3813
02:41:59,660 --> 02:42:04,191
I see that it's very sharp,
but when I look at things like on my 

3814
02:42:04,191 --> 02:42:05,250
phone,
same way man breeding computer that used

3815
02:42:05,251 --> 02:42:07,890
to be able to read it perfectly snuck up
on me,

3816
02:42:07,891 --> 02:42:12,891
man snuck up on me.
Some people say it's from staring at 

3817
02:42:12,891 --> 02:42:15,141
screens.
Some people say it's just a function of 

3818
02:42:15,141 --> 02:42:15,141
being older.
Yeah,

3819
02:42:15,141 --> 02:42:16,260
some people say that it is a combination
of factors,

3820
02:42:16,261 --> 02:42:21,261
but also one thing that doesn't help is 
that we constantly staring at something 

3821
02:42:21,261 --> 02:42:21,261
that's a fixed distance.

3822
02:42:21,261 --> 02:42:23,430
Right.
And the way some people put it as that.

3823
02:42:23,431 --> 02:42:24,690
It's like,
who was the woman?

3824
02:42:25,760 --> 02:42:27,270
Katie bowman,
katy bowman.

3825
02:42:27,271 --> 02:42:28,550
When she was on the podcast,
she.

3826
02:42:28,630 --> 02:42:33,630
She's an expert in human movement and 
she believes she's got a lot of pretty 

3827
02:42:34,261 --> 02:42:36,120
nutty ideas.
Like they don't use furniture.

3828
02:42:36,570 --> 02:42:41,570
They sleep on the floor there and she 
thinks that like looking at something 

3829
02:42:41,570 --> 02:42:45,030
that's like really close distance is 
like having a cast for your eyes,

3830
02:42:45,031 --> 02:42:46,710
almost like you need to put your arm in 
a cast.

3831
02:42:46,711 --> 02:42:49,110
It atrophies because you're not using it
the right way.

3832
02:42:49,170 --> 02:42:50,710
And we've been,
yeah,

3833
02:42:50,790 --> 02:42:53,580
we've been looking at screens.
That's not a bad theory.

3834
02:42:53,581 --> 02:42:58,581
At least doing.
I got super big ones and aubrey and I 

3835
02:42:58,581 --> 02:43:01,371
did a podcast.
I went off on this tangent that's been 

3836
02:43:01,371 --> 02:43:03,981
fucking with me ever since we were 
talking about screens that if you looked

3837
02:43:04,201 --> 02:43:07,100
at human beings and if you didn't know 
anything about us and be like,

3838
02:43:07,101 --> 02:43:12,101
oh,
they worshiped the screens because all 

3839
02:43:12,101 --> 02:43:12,101
we do,
you get up in the morning,

3840
02:43:12,101 --> 02:43:12,310
you check your phone,
you check your email,

3841
02:43:12,580 --> 02:43:17,580
you go to work,
you stare at your screen and the 

3842
02:43:17,580 --> 02:43:17,580
computer in a cubicle.

3843
02:43:17,580 --> 02:43:17,580
You come home,
you watch a little tv,

3844
02:43:17,580 --> 02:43:22,110
you go on the weekend.
Now we're going to go see a flick your 

3845
02:43:22,110 --> 02:43:24,391
staring at screens like if something 
that didn't understand something that 

3846
02:43:24,391 --> 02:43:28,951
didn't understand what what those images
were or didn't care or was trying to 

3847
02:43:28,951 --> 02:43:31,780
Judge you based on entirely on your 
actual movement and interaction,

3848
02:43:32,080 --> 02:43:32,800
they'd be like,
oh my god,

3849
02:43:32,801 --> 02:43:35,560
they're slave to the screen like they 
don't even understand.

3850
02:43:35,710 --> 02:43:37,400
We have to get It in these screens 
pulled.

3851
02:43:37,480 --> 02:43:42,480
We're slaves to watching these screens.
If you stop and think about how often 

3852
02:43:42,700 --> 02:43:46,720
you spend your time staring at a screen,
it's significant.

3853
02:43:47,100 --> 02:43:52,100
It's giant.
It's hours and hours of almost 

3854
02:43:52,100 --> 02:43:52,100
everybody's life.
When you read that way,

3855
02:43:52,100 --> 02:43:53,740
it's depressing.
It's really depressing.

3856
02:43:53,800 --> 02:43:58,800
It's weird.
It's weird because it's not staring at 

3857
02:43:58,800 --> 02:43:58,800
the screen.
We're watching westworld.

3858
02:43:58,800 --> 02:44:02,020
I'm checking my twitter.
I'm checking my email or taking a photo.

3859
02:44:02,170 --> 02:44:04,630
I'm going to put it on instagram.
Let's make a video.

3860
02:44:04,720 --> 02:44:05,850
Hey,
let's make a video.

3861
02:44:05,870 --> 02:44:08,050
You eating the kale shake.
Let's put it on youtube,

3862
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:13,320
but what's ultimately going on is people
are interacting with screens to get all 

3863
02:44:13,331 --> 02:44:15,730
this energy and you want a better screen
all the time.

3864
02:44:16,060 --> 02:44:21,060
You want to constantly have this bitch 
faster and upgraded and it wants to do 

3865
02:44:21,060 --> 02:44:25,171
more things and now it's virtual.
Now he can get the screen and it's in 

3866
02:44:25,171 --> 02:44:28,411
your head.
He could see 360 degrees all around you 

3867
02:44:28,411 --> 02:44:29,170
and then it's just more and more and 
more screens.

3868
02:44:29,280 --> 02:44:31,720
All rIght man.
You fucking scared me or use happiness.

3869
02:44:31,721 --> 02:44:33,220
Bark this joint back.
Oh my god.

3870
02:44:33,700 --> 02:44:34,830
Freaking myself out,
bro.

3871
02:44:36,360 --> 02:44:38,060
You worry about screens.
Tommy,

3872
02:44:38,170 --> 02:44:40,090
what about them haunting?
You know,

3873
02:44:40,120 --> 02:44:41,680
they call you at night.
Check your phone.

3874
02:44:41,770 --> 02:44:42,730
No,
I want to be in swimming.

3875
02:44:42,740 --> 02:44:43,480
He might've texted.

3876
02:44:43,570 --> 02:44:45,520
I want to be screened to now.
I do look at screens.

3877
02:44:45,550 --> 02:44:50,550
I get Yelled at for checking the phone 
too much and I do like proud of myself 

3878
02:44:50,550 --> 02:44:51,010
today.
Just checkin.

3879
02:44:51,270 --> 02:44:53,500
I left mY phone in the car when I took 
my yoga class.

3880
02:44:53,740 --> 02:44:56,570
And then you ran out to it afterwards?
Yeah.

3881
02:44:56,710 --> 02:44:57,800
Check.
yeah,

3882
02:44:57,940 --> 02:45:00,100
sure.
Some new crazy shit's on in the world.

3883
02:45:00,130 --> 02:45:01,750
It's addictive.
So addictive.

3884
02:45:02,500 --> 02:45:05,050
It's a real addiction too.
So I see it.

3885
02:45:05,170 --> 02:45:10,170
It's a,
and I always talked about were at 

3886
02:45:10,170 --> 02:45:10,170
restaurants,
you know,

3887
02:45:10,170 --> 02:45:13,370
and you see the family together and then
you're looking at my family that he had,

3888
02:45:13,410 --> 02:45:17,300
that kid was looking at me because the 
kid is like the net.

3889
02:45:17,350 --> 02:45:19,400
There's no interaction at the table.
Well,

3890
02:45:19,440 --> 02:45:21,880
when,
when we're at all bullshit aside,

3891
02:45:21,881 --> 02:45:23,920
when they get tired,
like when kids get tired,

3892
02:45:24,080 --> 02:45:29,080
yeah,
this is what you find to not kill that 

3893
02:45:29,080 --> 02:45:29,510
and especially if you want to have a 
conversation with,

3894
02:45:29,530 --> 02:45:34,510
it's not a bad thing to occasionally and
let them look at an ipad or play a game.

3895
02:45:34,510 --> 02:45:36,040
Like if it's on a plane or something 
like that.

3896
02:45:36,100 --> 02:45:41,100
but oftentime often oftentimes you can 
get the same kid like as in gay 

3897
02:45:44,670 --> 02:45:45,700
especially.
they like books.

3898
02:45:45,780 --> 02:45:47,140
Yeah.
Just give them a book to read.

3899
02:45:47,680 --> 02:45:49,330
So instead of sitting there playing a 
game,

3900
02:45:49,360 --> 02:45:53,290
which is kind of mindless,
they're reading a book which can kind of

3901
02:45:53,291 --> 02:45:55,240
expand their imagination.
However,

3902
02:45:55,410 --> 02:45:57,520
there Is also some arguments against 
that.

3903
02:45:57,521 --> 02:46:01,930
It's mindless because there's a lot of 
arguments about video games that all the

3904
02:46:01,931 --> 02:46:05,590
video games are kind of problematic for 
little kids because they do.

3905
02:46:05,620 --> 02:46:09,800
They do just become super addictive.
They also can expand your mind

3906
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:15,040
and they're also.
There's examples of people that have 

3907
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:18,521
done tests that have shown that video 
games actually can make you smarter 

3908
02:46:18,521 --> 02:46:20,090
because they make you constantly 
exercising parts of your brain and solve

3909
02:46:20,091 --> 02:46:21,890
problems.
I don't doubt that at all.

3910
02:46:21,980 --> 02:46:23,130
I mean,
like I,

3911
02:46:23,140 --> 02:46:24,230
I hadn't won the game.
Right.

3912
02:46:24,260 --> 02:46:25,810
It depends on the game.
Depends on.

3913
02:46:25,811 --> 02:46:26,780
Yes,
on the system.

3914
02:46:26,781 --> 02:46:31,781
Maybe you know,
but like there's definitely games you 

3915
02:46:31,781 --> 02:46:33,701
can play where I feel like there's 
something going on in your brain when 

3916
02:46:33,701 --> 02:46:35,070
you're efficient,
you're prolific,

3917
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:40,120
you're,
you're at a higher level performing in 

3918
02:46:40,120 --> 02:46:43,001
that game where if you put somebody 
slower into the same game,

3919
02:46:44,001 --> 02:46:45,080
they can't do it.
You know,

3920
02:46:45,081 --> 02:46:46,760
like they,
they're not Moving at that.

3921
02:46:46,761 --> 02:46:51,761
There's a cerTain.
I'm not saying that that means you're 

3922
02:46:51,761 --> 02:46:54,371
going to be great at everything,
but there's something in your brain 

3923
02:46:54,371 --> 02:46:57,190
functioning,
moving well to be able to put together 

3924
02:46:57,190 --> 02:46:57,770
how to,
how to play this game and play it really

3925
02:46:57,771 --> 02:46:58,310
high level.

3926
02:46:58,670 --> 02:47:01,160
Yeah man.
There's people that there are people you

3927
02:47:01,161 --> 02:47:01,990
can teach.
I mean,

3928
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:07,000
have you ever tried to show someone how 
to play a game and they just can't get 

3929
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:08,030
it?
Can't get it to do it or they don't have

3930
02:47:08,031 --> 02:47:10,140
any desire so they never tried.
Yeah,

3931
02:47:10,430 --> 02:47:13,190
I mean I've seen people try,
which I think stands out more.

3932
02:47:13,850 --> 02:47:15,660
They just are not good at it.
You know,

3933
02:47:15,860 --> 02:47:17,810
you go,
you need a lot more practice,

3934
02:47:18,020 --> 02:47:20,400
whereas some people can just pick up,
you know,

3935
02:47:20,401 --> 02:47:25,401
and be.
And I think those people come from a 

3936
02:47:25,401 --> 02:47:25,401
world of playing growing up,
right?

3937
02:47:25,401 --> 02:47:28,840
Like imagine today's kid who's born now 
playing like that.

3938
02:47:28,920 --> 02:47:33,860
These level gaMes that are out now,
how you know how he's going to be fluent

3939
02:47:33,980 --> 02:47:38,630
in that whole technology cyber stuff in 
15,

3940
02:47:38,631 --> 02:47:39,530
20 years.
Yeah.

3941
02:47:39,531 --> 02:47:41,000
You got to work them through it,
right?

3942
02:47:41,100 --> 02:47:46,100
Yeah.
Like my six year olD is just now 

3943
02:47:46,100 --> 02:47:47,861
figuring out that you can't beat me and 
tic tac toe really just like this 

3944
02:47:47,861 --> 02:47:47,861
motherfucker.

3945
02:47:47,900 --> 02:47:48,980
I can't beat him.
I'm like,

3946
02:47:48,981 --> 02:47:50,330
you're never going to win.
I go,

3947
02:47:50,331 --> 02:47:52,220
it's going to be a drive every time.
Really?

3948
02:47:52,221 --> 02:47:53,120
Yeah.
she's like,

3949
02:47:53,121 --> 02:47:53,470
wow.
I go,

3950
02:47:53,471 --> 02:47:58,471
because this is a dumb game.
It's a dumb game that puzzles You when 

3951
02:47:58,471 --> 02:47:58,471
you're young,
but as you get older you realize tic tac

3952
02:47:58,471 --> 02:48:03,011
toe is fucking stupid.
Unless you could make two moves in a 

3953
02:48:03,011 --> 02:48:03,230
row,
it's fucking dumb,

3954
02:48:03,730 --> 02:48:04,940
you know,
because you do this.

3955
02:48:04,970 --> 02:48:06,020
Oh,
I'm going to saY you're going to go over

3956
02:48:06,021 --> 02:48:06,740
here,
so I'll do that.

3957
02:48:06,770 --> 02:48:07,850
I'll do that.
And you do thIs.

3958
02:48:07,880 --> 02:48:09,590
Oh well I'm going to go over here so you
can't do that.

3959
02:48:09,591 --> 02:48:13,220
And then I'll draw this draw you draw 
every time.

3960
02:48:13,250 --> 02:48:16,090
Every time.
And you know,

3961
02:48:16,810 --> 02:48:17,670
I,
I,

3962
02:48:17,990 --> 02:48:19,880
I,
I've been there before,

3963
02:48:20,360 --> 02:48:23,720
but now I offer a,
some sort of a path,

3964
02:48:23,810 --> 02:48:25,910
like think about what's going on here.
She goes,

3965
02:48:25,911 --> 02:48:26,760
oh yeah,
okay.

3966
02:48:27,120 --> 02:48:27,770
Yeah.
That's cool.

3967
02:48:27,950 --> 02:48:29,150
I give her a little pause.
I don't go,

3968
02:48:29,151 --> 02:48:30,360
oh,
you fucked up,

3969
02:48:30,390 --> 02:48:31,640
right?
You suck.

3970
02:48:31,641 --> 02:48:34,920
You don't try to teach her along the way
because she's only 16.

3971
02:48:34,940 --> 02:48:37,700
She's 16 and I'm still kicking her ass 
to tic tac toe.

3972
02:48:37,730 --> 02:48:38,510
Listen,
dummy.

3973
02:48:41,980 --> 02:48:45,830
Waste tuition was the only way someone 
beats you at tac is if you're not paying

3974
02:48:45,831 --> 02:48:46,440
attention.
Right?

3975
02:48:46,480 --> 02:48:47,460
True.
Yeah.

3976
02:48:47,470 --> 02:48:49,130
You have to miss out if you're keyed 
into it.

3977
02:48:49,370 --> 02:48:51,320
Unless there's some crazy moves and I 
don't know about.

3978
02:48:51,321 --> 02:48:52,970
I haven't played in awhile,
so it's hard to say.

3979
02:48:52,971 --> 02:48:57,971
Actually.
Is there a world tic tac toe 

3980
02:48:57,971 --> 02:48:57,971
championship?
I'm sure there is.

3981
02:48:57,971 --> 02:48:58,250
If you had to guess.
Yes.

3982
02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:01,070
How smart is the person that won a 
fucking genius?

3983
02:49:02,570 --> 02:49:03,860
Stephen hawking levels.
Shit.

3984
02:49:04,380 --> 02:49:07,770
Lucy.
He playing for neil tyson.

3985
02:49:07,860 --> 02:49:11,390
Imagine neil degrasse tyson and richard 
dawkins take.

3986
02:49:11,410 --> 02:49:14,070
What do you say that at the end of tick 
tack toe.

3987
02:49:14,400 --> 02:49:19,400
Forget.
Is that supposed to be the call the to 

3988
02:49:19,400 --> 02:49:19,400
say tic tac toe guests,
but nobody ever does.

3989
02:49:19,400 --> 02:49:20,010
It's like trick or treat the little 
fuckers.

3990
02:49:20,011 --> 02:49:22,130
just show up with open bags.
Put it in man.

3991
02:49:23,370 --> 02:49:28,370
You got snickers like.
It's weird when you see that one kid 

3992
02:49:28,370 --> 02:49:28,500
that's just a little too old for trick 
or treat.

3993
02:49:28,760 --> 02:49:32,160
It starts to get creepy.
It's like trick or treating is fun.

3994
02:49:32,190 --> 02:49:35,430
How do you put in your name?
Give them candy.

3995
02:49:35,460 --> 02:49:36,970
NobodY.
Do you um,

3996
02:49:37,560 --> 02:49:40,970
have everyone come to the front door,
do you the end thing?

3997
02:49:41,160 --> 02:49:43,650
Yeah,
they ring doorbells and um,

3998
02:49:44,220 --> 02:49:49,220
you know,
we go walking around the neighborhood 

3999
02:49:49,220 --> 02:49:49,220
too.
It's fun.

4000
02:49:49,220 --> 02:49:49,220
It's a designated.
Didn't love it.

4001
02:49:49,220 --> 02:49:50,450
No halloween.
Well no.

4002
02:49:50,451 --> 02:49:50,760
Um,
some,

4003
02:49:50,820 --> 02:49:52,560
some places like they do at like,
you know,

4004
02:49:52,561 --> 02:49:56,370
there's like the day before,
if it's like,

4005
02:49:56,400 --> 02:49:57,960
depending on the day of the week,
you know,

4006
02:49:59,220 --> 02:50:04,220
he can't do that now.
You've got to do halloween when it's 

4007
02:50:04,220 --> 02:50:04,220
halloween.
Your mother fuckers.

4008
02:50:04,220 --> 02:50:05,280
I haven't been out trying to take over 
America.

4009
02:50:06,310 --> 02:50:08,910
There's a coup goIng on.
Have you been paying attention?

4010
02:50:09,180 --> 02:50:14,180
The russians have canceled halloween.
I just thought about how dumb I go.

4011
02:50:15,211 --> 02:50:17,100
So would you have a day that you do it?
Hell,

4012
02:50:18,290 --> 02:50:19,080
fuck it all the way.

4013
02:50:19,440 --> 02:50:21,390
This pot man,
god damn pot.

4014
02:50:21,391 --> 02:50:23,430
It's terrible for you.
Terrible mAn.

4015
02:50:24,380 --> 02:50:29,380
Just makes you dumb.
It makes you ask questions you should 

4016
02:50:29,380 --> 02:50:29,380
have thought through.
Like,

4017
02:50:29,380 --> 02:50:31,200
what day is halloween?
Same day.

4018
02:50:31,201 --> 02:50:33,250
Every year.
That's a weird thing about thanksgiving.

4019
02:50:33,270 --> 02:50:35,040
Thanksgiving is not the same day every 
year,

4020
02:50:35,041 --> 02:50:36,900
right,
because it's on thursday always.

4021
02:50:36,930 --> 02:50:38,370
Right,
so the the number,

4022
02:50:38,371 --> 02:50:40,780
right?
The date is always that third thursday.

4023
02:50:40,781 --> 02:50:42,210
Is it kind of stupid shit?
Is that.

4024
02:50:42,750 --> 02:50:47,750
Why is it fucking thursday?
Why are you pretending that those 

4025
02:50:47,750 --> 02:50:49,080
goddamn pilgrims ever sat down with 
those native americans like that?

4026
02:50:49,650 --> 02:50:54,650
That shit didn't happen.
They didn't even speak the same 

4027
02:50:54,650 --> 02:50:54,690
language.
Those original people that landed,

4028
02:50:54,980 --> 02:50:59,980
if you ever read some of the accounts at
christopher columbus is atrocities that 

4029
02:50:59,980 --> 02:51:03,351
he committed and I know that there's a 
lot of people that are appalled by a 

4030
02:51:04,940 --> 02:51:06,630
day.
I think it's an outrageous.

4031
02:51:06,631 --> 02:51:09,900
Do you ever think about what you learned
in school about thanksgiving?

4032
02:51:10,110 --> 02:51:15,110
How nice.
They made it to have a native american 

4033
02:51:15,110 --> 02:51:15,110
day,
but we have a columbus day.

4034
02:51:15,110 --> 02:51:15,840
It's really outrageous.
Yeah.

4035
02:51:16,320 --> 02:51:21,320
I know.
And thanksgiving they used to be like 

4036
02:51:21,320 --> 02:51:21,320
and then this guy was like,
are you eating alone?

4037
02:51:21,320 --> 02:51:26,180
Sit over here.
And then that's how they became best 

4038
02:51:26,180 --> 02:51:26,180
friends.
Like that's how they taught.

4039
02:51:26,180 --> 02:51:28,320
They taught us in school and they hate 
Turkey and then they were like,

4040
02:51:28,350 --> 02:51:30,030
even though you're different,
let's all hang out.

4041
02:51:30,360 --> 02:51:32,490
Let me say something.
They weren't shooting merriam turkeys.

4042
02:51:33,140 --> 02:51:34,500
Turkeys didn't know any better.
Right?

4043
02:51:34,530 --> 02:51:36,540
Like as soon as the turkeys figured out 
what the fuck they were doing,

4044
02:51:36,930 --> 02:51:37,860
they were like,
oh yeah,

4045
02:51:38,100 --> 02:51:38,670
yeah,
you can't do.

4046
02:51:38,700 --> 02:51:43,700
You can't shoot us like that.
We're just going to fly away over that 

4047
02:51:43,700 --> 02:51:43,700
metal.
Like,

4048
02:51:43,700 --> 02:51:43,700
yeah,
dad,

4049
02:51:43,700 --> 02:51:46,980
those shitty guns bills must get guns.
They had those flints and shit.

4050
02:51:47,580 --> 02:51:49,060
Yeah.
Those things were inaccurate.

4051
02:51:49,080 --> 02:51:51,600
Push it down.
We're not in the distance.

4052
02:51:51,601 --> 02:51:56,601
I mean,
I don't know how far they could shoot 

4053
02:51:56,601 --> 02:51:58,011
those things,
but they were shooting deer most likely 

4054
02:51:58,011 --> 02:51:58,011
they were eating deers.
Yeah.

4055
02:51:58,050 --> 02:52:00,480
Thanksgiving.
You fucking purge,

4056
02:52:00,481 --> 02:52:02,040
right?
It should be just a bloodbath.

4057
02:52:02,070 --> 02:52:03,840
Holiday.
You get to kill her buddy.

4058
02:52:04,470 --> 02:52:06,100
It's thanksgiving just

4059
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:07,930
like our ancestors did.
Well,

4060
02:52:07,931 --> 02:52:09,350
it's not our ancestors.
Yeah.

4061
02:52:09,440 --> 02:52:14,440
I don't know.
Mine came over in a boat pretty 

4062
02:52:14,440 --> 02:52:14,440
recently,
like I could try.

4063
02:52:14,440 --> 02:52:14,440
Fine.
Yeah.

4064
02:52:14,440 --> 02:52:15,220
So if anybody says like,
hey,

4065
02:52:15,221 --> 02:52:17,300
you man,
you know your ancestry.

4066
02:52:17,350 --> 02:52:18,850
Ah,
nope.

4067
02:52:19,010 --> 02:52:21,130
They didn't do anything.
Didn't own any slaves.

4068
02:52:21,490 --> 02:52:25,960
Came over from Italy and the 19 hundreds
I tracked mine back to 17 hundreds.

4069
02:52:26,020 --> 02:52:27,610
That's when they came over here.
Oh yeah,

4070
02:52:27,611 --> 02:52:32,611
you're a killer.
You're all families responsible for 

4071
02:52:32,611 --> 02:52:32,611
atrocities.
This guy actually,

4072
02:52:32,611 --> 02:52:34,810
we got a report on him at a family 
reunion.

4073
02:52:34,990 --> 02:52:37,780
Oh shit.
We had this guy who came over.

4074
02:52:37,840 --> 02:52:39,190
Yeah.
What was he like?

4075
02:52:39,250 --> 02:52:42,100
I say he's a real piece of shit.
It kind of ruined the family reunion.

4076
02:52:42,760 --> 02:52:46,060
It was not real cool.
Murdered somebody.

4077
02:52:47,020 --> 02:52:50,890
It was a spanish guy came from under 
lucila and he,

4078
02:52:50,891 --> 02:52:52,180
uh,
yeah,

4079
02:52:52,181 --> 02:52:53,490
he really said,
you know,

4080
02:52:53,510 --> 02:52:54,850
they read his,
um,

4081
02:52:55,030 --> 02:52:56,210
his will and they're like it.

4082
02:52:56,230 --> 02:52:59,950
Then he left 30 slaves to this person.
We don't want to get another drink.

4083
02:52:59,980 --> 02:53:04,480
This is getting uncomfortable like that.
And then they said he killed somebody in

4084
02:53:04,481 --> 02:53:07,300
Louisiana and they're like any hung 
someone from this tree.

4085
02:53:07,301 --> 02:53:09,670
And it was like a,
like a real savage dude.

4086
02:53:09,970 --> 02:53:10,900
Wow.
Yeah.

4087
02:53:10,960 --> 02:53:12,760
That's in your blood and you're the 
nicest guy ever.

4088
02:53:12,820 --> 02:53:13,870
I know.
Had that happened,

4089
02:53:13,871 --> 02:53:15,580
I don't know,
but you know,

4090
02:53:15,700 --> 02:53:19,120
that's my granddad.
Great granddad or granddad.

4091
02:53:19,150 --> 02:53:20,410
Oh no,
this is like great.

4092
02:53:20,411 --> 02:53:20,890
Great,
great,

4093
02:53:20,891 --> 02:53:21,240
great.
Like,

4094
02:53:21,310 --> 02:53:21,790
I'm like,
damn,

4095
02:53:21,791 --> 02:53:23,970
how old are your people live?
Not 10 greats,

4096
02:53:23,971 --> 02:53:24,550
man.
It's,

4097
02:53:24,690 --> 02:53:26,120
it's super removed from me.
Like,

4098
02:53:26,160 --> 02:53:28,000
that's amazing.
Your people live forever.

4099
02:53:28,270 --> 02:53:33,270
No,
this guy would be come over and like 

4100
02:53:33,270 --> 02:53:33,270
early,
early 17 hundreds.

4101
02:53:33,850 --> 02:53:36,190
It's so weird to think that a human 
being gets.

4102
02:53:36,700 --> 02:53:37,960
If there were super,
super lucky,

4103
02:53:37,961 --> 02:53:42,190
they get like 90 years of life and while
that life is going on,

4104
02:53:42,460 --> 02:53:45,130
you're just trying to figure out what's,
what's happening,

4105
02:53:45,160 --> 02:53:45,970
what are you doing?

4106
02:53:46,200 --> 02:53:51,200
Like what are,
why are we gathering together in these 

4107
02:53:51,200 --> 02:53:51,200
cities?
Why are we going to work?

4108
02:53:51,200 --> 02:53:51,790
Why are we going home and going to 
sleep?

4109
02:53:51,791 --> 02:53:52,660
Why are we doing this?
Like,

4110
02:53:52,690 --> 02:53:55,420
what are we doing?
Why are we staring at screens?

4111
02:53:56,140 --> 02:53:59,680
Why am I bringing slaves?
Did you ever think about like as you get

4112
02:53:59,681 --> 02:54:03,070
older,
staying like as a funny comic,

4113
02:54:03,700 --> 02:54:05,410
you know what I mean?
Did you ever that ever occur to you?

4114
02:54:05,590 --> 02:54:09,160
What does that mean?
Like there's a like maybe you should try

4115
02:54:09,161 --> 02:54:14,161
to be funny.
Maybe we should play them up being 

4116
02:54:14,161 --> 02:54:14,161
funny.
No,

4117
02:54:14,161 --> 02:54:16,591
my thing is about being a february.
So I'm saying that like in general we 

4118
02:54:17,891 --> 02:54:21,460
have this sort of outlook that being 
funny.

4119
02:54:21,490 --> 02:54:24,970
Comedy in general I'm saying is a 
younger person's kind of thing,

4120
02:54:24,971 --> 02:54:25,390
right?
It's,

4121
02:54:25,650 --> 02:54:28,300
it's up until a certain age.
Yes.

4122
02:54:28,390 --> 02:54:32,080
What does that age as well?

4123
02:54:32,080 --> 02:54:34,330
It's like there's really funny guys that
are 60,

4124
02:54:34,420 --> 02:54:36,250
like ron white,
hundred percent men.

4125
02:54:36,410 --> 02:54:38,340
I totally agree.
I'm saying like,

4126
02:54:38,350 --> 02:54:43,350
has it ever like.
Did you ever think as you get like as 

4127
02:54:43,350 --> 02:54:46,330
you're going through your forties,
like am I still in that circle?

4128
02:54:46,331 --> 02:54:48,760
I mean it sounds like lame to say it,
but like,

4129
02:54:48,761 --> 02:54:50,350
cool,
funny as opposed to like,

4130
02:54:50,380 --> 02:54:51,610
oh,
that's an older guy is older,

4131
02:54:51,850 --> 02:54:55,450
you know,
like do you ever process that as you age

4132
02:54:55,690 --> 02:54:56,050
or.
No,

4133
02:54:56,051 --> 02:54:58,480
it's never like a methodical thought,
you know?

4134
02:54:58,810 --> 02:55:03,810
Well I try not to think like that 
because that doesn't seem to have 

4135
02:55:03,810 --> 02:55:04,280
upside.

4136
02:55:04,420 --> 02:55:09,420
Yeah.
That seems like a very limiting thought 

4137
02:55:09,420 --> 02:55:09,420
and there's nothing you can do about it 
if you are an older person.

4138
02:55:09,980 --> 02:55:13,400
But to mitigate it was different.
To cut that off at the path.

4139
02:55:13,490 --> 02:55:15,140
Yeah.
I just try to do my best.

4140
02:55:16,310 --> 02:55:19,460
So I feel like if you're living your 
life and you're in the moment,

4141
02:55:19,490 --> 02:55:24,490
you try and do your best and obviously 
you're gonna follow that back and forth 

4142
02:55:24,490 --> 02:55:28,211
and left and rIght.
You're gonna have good days and bad 

4143
02:55:28,211 --> 02:55:29,981
days,
like when you have a mindset or if 

4144
02:55:29,981 --> 02:55:31,610
you're trying to trying to do your best 
at something or trying to,

4145
02:55:31,611 --> 02:55:33,830
uh,
enjoy your life in a,

4146
02:55:33,840 --> 02:55:34,880
you know,
like a balanced,

4147
02:55:34,881 --> 02:55:38,960
happy way.
It's not always super smooth path,

4148
02:55:38,990 --> 02:55:43,990
you know,
there's a lot of mistakes and hiccups 

4149
02:55:43,990 --> 02:55:46,511
along the way.
And the whole thing is it's about like 

4150
02:55:46,511 --> 02:55:46,511
having an idea of what you're trying to 
do,

4151
02:55:46,640 --> 02:55:51,640
have an idea of how you're trying to 
live and how you want to feel and how 

4152
02:55:51,640 --> 02:55:54,641
you want to affect people.
And then sort of like figuring out your 

4153
02:55:54,641 --> 02:55:54,641
way through that path.
And then as you keep doing it,

4154
02:55:54,641 --> 02:55:56,000
you keep getting better at it.
Sure.

4155
02:55:56,750 --> 02:55:59,960
And I think that if that's the case,
if you're living your life like that,

4156
02:55:59,990 --> 02:56:04,990
if you're trying to make.
I'm trying to make this path through 

4157
02:56:04,990 --> 02:56:09,640
your existence,
it will at least leave you in a place 

4158
02:56:09,640 --> 02:56:12,500
where your.
You're constantly trying to have fun and

4159
02:56:12,501 --> 02:56:14,600
you're constantly trying to improve and 
I think you'll get like

4160
02:56:14,950 --> 02:56:17,650
feelings out of it.
But at the end of the day,

4161
02:56:17,860 --> 02:56:22,860
it's still the same thing.
It's still this strange temporary 

4162
02:56:22,860 --> 02:56:26,971
existence where you're awake and 
conscious for a certain amount of time 

4163
02:56:27,950 --> 02:56:32,950
everyday,
but then your unconscious for a certain 

4164
02:56:32,950 --> 02:56:33,430
amount of time every day and you're 
ultimately going to shut off.

4165
02:56:33,870 --> 02:56:34,630
Yeah,
yeah,

4166
02:56:34,631 --> 02:56:39,631
yeah.
It's all gonna go down no matter what 

4167
02:56:39,631 --> 02:56:42,451
you're doing.
But I was looking at these photos of 

4168
02:56:42,451 --> 02:56:45,140
like red buttons wound a Jerry Lewis at 
these events like uh,

4169
02:56:46,300 --> 02:56:47,870
you could buy a ticket to.
Okay.

4170
02:56:48,040 --> 02:56:50,920
So when they get become undeniably older
comics.

4171
02:56:50,950 --> 02:56:55,950
Right.
And I saw the audience was all very old 

4172
02:56:55,950 --> 02:56:56,440
and I wondered,
I wondered like is this a,

4173
02:56:57,130 --> 02:57:02,130
is this a thing that happened at a 
moment like george carlin was 70 and 

4174
02:57:03,341 --> 02:57:05,530
still drawing in young guys?
Absolutely.

4175
02:57:05,780 --> 02:57:07,780
I understand for other.
So some women too.

4176
02:57:07,781 --> 02:57:09,190
That's a great counter to it.

4177
02:57:09,250 --> 02:57:11,890
But my thought was,
so is it that those guys,

4178
02:57:11,990 --> 02:57:15,400
what I'm saying,
stop being funny to a certain generation

4179
02:57:15,401 --> 02:57:18,100
or they stopped trying or they just got,
I don't know,

4180
02:57:18,130 --> 02:57:19,360
so old,
you know,

4181
02:57:19,600 --> 02:57:22,570
it could be a bunch of those things.
It could be taken care of your health.

4182
02:57:22,630 --> 02:57:25,630
It could be.
I'm touring and working a lot.

4183
02:57:25,720 --> 02:57:28,060
George carlin was touring constantly.
Constantly.

4184
02:57:28,090 --> 02:57:28,780
Yeah.
Yeah.

4185
02:57:28,890 --> 02:57:30,520
He will put out a whole new hour every 
year.

4186
02:57:30,730 --> 02:57:33,610
Unbelievable.
And he was still really funny at 70,

4187
02:57:33,730 --> 02:57:37,690
like,
and he also had taken on the role of the

4188
02:57:37,691 --> 02:57:39,360
angry curmudgeon,
you know,

4189
02:57:39,370 --> 02:57:44,370
this,
this angry older comic who's also very 

4190
02:57:44,370 --> 02:57:46,870
wise and very liberal.
I love that character.

4191
02:57:46,871 --> 02:57:51,871
Yeah.
I mean I love the liberal pretty 

4192
02:57:51,871 --> 02:57:54,841
fascinating guy and stayed relevant,
relevant rather to the very end of his 

4193
02:57:55,841 --> 02:57:58,960
life and died like I believe in a hotel 
room after a show.

4194
02:57:59,520 --> 02:57:59,900
Yeah.

4195
02:57:59,920 --> 02:58:02,370
I think he died in his.
I think it was one of those things.

4196
02:58:02,540 --> 02:58:04,410
And that's hard to crazy diddy.
Yeah,

4197
02:58:04,411 --> 02:58:07,710
I remember he went to,
I want to say a santa monica hosPital.

4198
02:58:08,010 --> 02:58:10,390
Well he had um,
he had uh,

4199
02:58:10,410 --> 02:58:11,850
issues with pills too,
man.

4200
02:58:11,880 --> 02:58:14,250
Yeah.
He was pretty forthcoming about that.

4201
02:58:14,350 --> 02:58:17,280
Some code problems from earlier.
Yeah.

4202
02:58:18,010 --> 02:58:21,360
That all that shit contributes the pills
or the most shocking.

4203
02:58:21,390 --> 02:58:23,310
The way they deteriorate people.
Yeah.

4204
02:58:23,340 --> 02:58:27,650
He was so funny at 70 then he was so 
funny and I think that,

4205
02:58:27,660 --> 02:58:30,150
that dude was still killing.
Yeah.

4206
02:58:30,510 --> 02:58:35,510
Yeah.
So are you thinking about this now 

4207
02:58:35,510 --> 02:58:35,510
because you're a father now and you're 
thinking you're getting older,

4208
02:58:35,510 --> 02:58:38,980
you get into your forties.
It's one of those things that um,

4209
02:58:39,210 --> 02:58:40,800
what I,
what I actually think is that,

4210
02:58:40,801 --> 02:58:42,870
like I,
I'll think about that I'll look at,

4211
02:58:43,170 --> 02:58:48,170
but you know,
people older than me then one of the 

4212
02:58:48,170 --> 02:58:50,991
things that I find inspiring is that I 
feel like people at the top of their 

4213
02:58:50,991 --> 02:58:54,591
game in stand up right now are 
essentially all 10 to 15 years older 

4214
02:58:55,171 --> 02:58:55,500
than me.

4215
02:58:55,680 --> 02:58:57,370
So I fiNd that to be a very,
like,

4216
02:58:57,790 --> 02:58:59,580
I'm inspiring thought,
you know,

4217
02:58:59,640 --> 02:59:03,450
like everybody is like late forties,
early fifties,

4218
02:59:03,451 --> 02:59:04,010
and you're like,
oh,

4219
02:59:04,420 --> 02:59:05,700
it just one of those things you go like,
oh,

4220
02:59:05,701 --> 02:59:07,830
you can be better,
you can,

4221
02:59:07,890 --> 02:59:11,070
you can still do greater things.
Be funny,

4222
02:59:11,100 --> 02:59:15,150
Like develop more into your forties.
Whereas I think as a young comic,

4223
02:59:15,540 --> 02:59:17,940
when you're 20,
all you hear about is like 10 years,

4224
02:59:17,941 --> 02:59:18,720
10 years,
10 years.

4225
02:59:18,721 --> 02:59:23,721
So you go,
that's must be the place to get to 10 

4226
02:59:23,721 --> 02:59:23,721
years.
So when I'm 30,

4227
02:59:23,721 --> 02:59:26,580
that'll be my development.
But you realize you can keep working.

4228
02:59:27,060 --> 02:59:27,750
We'll also,
you're,

4229
02:59:27,810 --> 02:59:32,810
you're,
when you're thinking about the body of 

4230
02:59:32,810 --> 02:59:35,661
standing up that's been before you,
there's so many great comedians that 

4231
02:59:35,661 --> 02:59:36,510
have done so many great cds and dvds and
all these different things.

4232
02:59:37,200 --> 02:59:42,200
One of the things that separates you 
from maybe a guy that lived 20 years ago

4233
02:59:42,991 --> 02:59:46,050
as a,
you're also like playing off the body of

4234
02:59:46,051 --> 02:59:47,880
work of all these people that came 
before you.

4235
02:59:47,970 --> 02:59:52,250
True because they set this bar right.
You've been inspired by their comedy and

4236
02:59:52,300 --> 02:59:57,300
been inspired by you know,
movies and all sorts of different pop 

4237
02:59:57,300 --> 02:59:58,600
culture things that just didn't exist 20
years ago.

4238
02:59:58,601 --> 03:00:00,300
So you have a greater points of 
reference.

4239
03:00:00,510 --> 03:00:01,350
True.
You know?

4240
03:00:01,440 --> 03:00:06,440
Yeah.
and I think as you get older you have a 

4241
03:00:06,440 --> 03:00:06,440
better understanding of all the shit 
you're looking at.

4242
03:00:06,440 --> 03:00:10,730
So you might be able to point things out
like as you're in your forties that 

4243
03:00:10,730 --> 03:00:14,211
maybe you wouldn't have never even seen 
when you're in your thirties because 

4244
03:00:14,211 --> 03:00:14,211
you're tripping over your own deck and 
yeah,

4245
03:00:14,211 --> 03:00:15,930
being a dumb ass and sure you know,
and you did.

4246
03:00:15,990 --> 03:00:20,990
Didn't you or understanding of the world
then would embarrass you today.

4247
03:00:21,720 --> 03:00:24,810
Which sometimes it does,
just for sure for everybody.

4248
03:00:24,840 --> 03:00:26,550
There's no,
there's no doubt about it.

4249
03:00:26,551 --> 03:00:28,170
Unless you were born in the perfect 
person,

4250
03:00:28,171 --> 03:00:29,340
you're a work in progress.

4251
03:00:29,340 --> 03:00:31,950
If you have any self reflection,
you look back and you're like,

4252
03:00:31,980 --> 03:00:36,980
I can't live with that,
but that's just a matter of getting 

4253
03:00:36,980 --> 03:00:40,491
better at life.
But there's aLso nothing wrong with 

4254
03:00:40,491 --> 03:00:42,000
being Jerry Lewis or red buttons are in 
guys and just kill,

4255
03:00:42,660 --> 03:00:47,660
kill,
killing time when you get older and 

4256
03:00:47,660 --> 03:00:49,161
hanging out and just stopping the grind.
I was thinking about that just in the 

4257
03:00:49,161 --> 03:00:49,990
shower the other day.
Like I,

4258
03:00:50,120 --> 03:00:52,620
I'd seen a picture of that and I was 
like,

4259
03:00:53,100 --> 03:00:55,860
I'm going to be 80 in my fucking red 
jacket.

4260
03:00:56,190 --> 03:01:01,190
Yeah.
I fucking know kilroy and I'm to go and 

4261
03:01:01,190 --> 03:01:05,041
my fans will be like the fans that saw 
me 50 years ago and I'll just be in 

4262
03:01:05,041 --> 03:01:06,520
there like rodney.
Yeah man.

4263
03:01:06,890 --> 03:01:11,890
And I was actually,
I was actually happy with that thought 

4264
03:01:11,890 --> 03:01:11,890
too.
Yeah,

4265
03:01:11,890 --> 03:01:11,890
that's a good thought.
Yeah.

4266
03:01:11,890 --> 03:01:12,880
Yeah.
You can't freak on that man.

4267
03:01:13,120 --> 03:01:14,500
It is what it is.
It might not even be real.

4268
03:01:14,550 --> 03:01:16,900
You might wake up tomorrow exactly the 
same age and the,

4269
03:01:16,901 --> 03:01:18,620
you might be programmed with this,
uh,

4270
03:01:18,700 --> 03:01:21,010
intermittent memory that every time you 
wake up,

4271
03:01:21,011 --> 03:01:24,520
you pretend that you have this past that
you're trying to get better than.

4272
03:01:24,521 --> 03:01:28,240
But the reality is this,
this same day has always been your life.

4273
03:01:28,320 --> 03:01:30,070
How are you fucking with over and over 
and over again?

4274
03:01:30,071 --> 03:01:31,840
It's everything that's happened other 
than this moment.

4275
03:01:31,841 --> 03:01:36,841
This conversation has been bullshit.
It's all just been fiber optically 

4276
03:01:36,841 --> 03:01:38,680
implanted into the grain in the back of 
your ear.

4277
03:01:38,920 --> 03:01:40,690
Does jamie press a button and then this 
happens.

4278
03:01:42,190 --> 03:01:45,880
This is What happening with trump.
When trump became president,

4279
03:01:45,910 --> 03:01:50,910
and then when kanye west was a fresh 
three or four days out of the loony bin 

4280
03:01:50,910 --> 03:01:51,940
goes to visit tropic trauma.
It's like,

4281
03:01:51,941 --> 03:01:52,510
yeah,
sure.

4282
03:01:52,511 --> 03:01:53,280
It's an intimate.

4283
03:01:53,450 --> 03:01:55,210
Not like I'm the president and you're 
crazy.

4284
03:01:55,211 --> 03:01:59,080
Come on him and him and Donald Trump,
apparently very good friends.

4285
03:01:59,420 --> 03:02:00,670
I saw that.
It's wonderful.

4286
03:02:00,760 --> 03:02:01,960
I love that.
I love friendship.

4287
03:02:02,140 --> 03:02:07,140
Trump said he doesn't read the daily 
presidential briefings because you 

4288
03:02:07,140 --> 03:02:07,140
probably shouldn't.
He's a genius.

4289
03:02:07,140 --> 03:02:11,980
He's.
What the fuck does he need a daily 

4290
03:02:11,980 --> 03:02:11,980
presidential briefings?
That's our president of folks,

4291
03:02:12,150 --> 03:02:12,830
dah,
dah,

4292
03:02:12,860 --> 03:02:13,620
dah,
dah,

4293
03:02:13,830 --> 03:02:18,830
dah.
Have you seen the saturday night live 

4294
03:02:18,830 --> 03:02:18,830
sketch?
They did.

4295
03:02:18,830 --> 03:02:20,680
How a Donald Trump views the world now.
It's fucking hilarious.

4296
03:02:20,681 --> 03:02:22,600
I've seen a couple of things.
Take it as a joke.

4297
03:02:22,870 --> 03:02:24,460
I hope he doesn't get too mad.
I just.

4298
03:02:24,470 --> 03:02:26,660
One problem with that dude is that,
uh,

4299
03:02:26,740 --> 03:02:27,850
he doesn't take jokes.
Right?

4300
03:02:27,851 --> 03:02:28,750
Well,
he gets real upset.

4301
03:02:28,751 --> 03:02:29,830
I think he's going to learn,
man.

4302
03:02:29,860 --> 03:02:31,810
This kind of lighten up can be a long 
four years,

4303
03:02:32,710 --> 03:02:35,440
bro.
And he was better.

4304
03:02:35,441 --> 03:02:38,260
I'm Jeff Ross had them.
They roasted them.

4305
03:02:38,380 --> 03:02:43,380
I remember.
And Jeff Ross had a conversation with 

4306
03:02:43,380 --> 03:02:43,380
them.
It's like,

4307
03:02:43,380 --> 03:02:43,380
well,
you know,

4308
03:02:43,380 --> 03:02:43,380
when people were cracking jokes by.
Yeah,

4309
03:02:43,380 --> 03:02:45,130
we turned the camera to you did.
It looks like you're a bad sport.

4310
03:02:45,131 --> 03:02:46,120
Like you're not laughing along.
He's like,

4311
03:02:46,121 --> 03:02:47,560
you're right.
So you started laughing.

4312
03:02:47,740 --> 03:02:48,460
Oh really?
Yeah.

4313
03:02:48,461 --> 03:02:49,510
So he's,
he's not.

4314
03:02:49,780 --> 03:02:51,010
He listened.
He gets it.

4315
03:02:51,190 --> 03:02:54,670
Nothing is unreceptive,
but when he sees this side out,

4316
03:02:54,680 --> 03:02:57,220
live one's going to be rough.
Yeah.

4317
03:02:57,700 --> 03:03:02,700
He got mad at the last few years.
He's been mad at sarah live for awhile 

4318
03:03:02,700 --> 03:03:04,500
and so they keep chipping away at them,
but this is like the best saturday night

4319
03:03:04,510 --> 03:03:06,870
live has been in fucking years.
Horace mann,

4320
03:03:06,871 --> 03:03:08,700
you have somebody did fucking go after 
it.

4321
03:03:08,770 --> 03:03:13,770
It's fantastic.
And you've got Alex Baldwin willing to 

4322
03:03:13,770 --> 03:03:14,560
do it.
He's like an oscar winner.

4323
03:03:14,680 --> 03:03:16,930
I think so.
Tremendous actor.

4324
03:03:17,020 --> 03:03:19,750
How is he at glare gun ross if he didn't
win an oscar?

4325
03:03:19,750 --> 03:03:20,980
Fuck the astros.
Now.

4326
03:03:20,981 --> 03:03:23,520
He's tremendous actor.
Some people say that was overdone.

4327
03:03:24,030 --> 03:03:26,290
I don't like that scene.
I just thought it was too over the top.

4328
03:03:26,320 --> 03:03:28,870
That's not how people would behave.
It's a fucking stage play.

4329
03:03:29,070 --> 03:03:31,360
He's to say that though.
You ever see that?

4330
03:03:31,390 --> 03:03:33,190
Some actors think he tried too hard to 
find.

4331
03:03:33,191 --> 03:03:35,830
They don't like it.
Go away too actory too.

4332
03:03:35,831 --> 03:03:37,690
Actory.
I've heard people say that.

4333
03:03:38,260 --> 03:03:39,940
I've seen people over.
She's just too big.

4334
03:03:40,300 --> 03:03:41,800
What they're doing is too big.
It's not our show.

4335
03:03:41,830 --> 03:03:44,110
He should have been big right there.
This is not what we're looking for.

4336
03:03:44,170 --> 03:03:45,490
Yeah.
Wants to be more grounded.

4337
03:03:45,550 --> 03:03:46,480
That's the word.
Yeah,

4338
03:03:46,810 --> 03:03:50,350
but alec baldwin is the fucking perfect.
Donald trump.

4339
03:03:50,650 --> 03:03:52,900
He's fantastic and it's really fucking 
funny.

4340
03:03:52,950 --> 03:03:57,950
Also,
alec baldwin really understands what 

4341
03:03:57,950 --> 03:03:58,010
it's like to be a cunt.
Yeah,

4342
03:03:58,150 --> 03:04:00,150
right.
Although I don't think he's a cunt.

4343
03:04:00,530 --> 03:04:04,510
He definitely has had moments in his 
life where he's been accused of being.

4344
03:04:04,540 --> 03:04:09,540
I can't attack proper razzies.
He's a wacky dude.

4345
03:04:09,621 --> 03:04:11,700
He.
He got punched somebody or something.

4346
03:04:11,900 --> 03:04:13,760
He got accused of killing a paparazzi,
a fag.

4347
03:04:13,890 --> 03:04:15,500
ThIs was my favorite,
and then he goes.

4348
03:04:15,501 --> 03:04:17,630
I called him a fat head because it's 
kind of an audible.

4349
03:04:18,290 --> 03:04:20,150
Right,
becauSe he's screaming down the street.

4350
03:04:20,180 --> 03:04:21,110
He's like I said,
fat head.

4351
03:04:21,800 --> 03:04:23,260
more fat shaming.
Yes.

4352
03:04:23,340 --> 03:04:25,400
Like what you said,
but I also.

4353
03:04:25,790 --> 03:04:30,790
Oh yeah.
He called his daughter who was 11 or 

4354
03:04:30,790 --> 03:04:30,790
rude.
Thoughtless pig.

4355
03:04:30,790 --> 03:04:30,790
yeah,
that was the big one.

4356
03:04:30,790 --> 03:04:31,670
That was.
That's,

4357
03:04:32,170 --> 03:04:33,670
that's hard.
You know what man?

4358
03:04:33,710 --> 03:04:34,940
People fuck up.
Yeah,

4359
03:04:34,941 --> 03:04:35,780
but you can't.
What are you?

4360
03:04:35,781 --> 03:04:39,350
Gonna punish forever for that too.
Like that's terrible that he did that.

4361
03:04:39,351 --> 03:04:44,351
It really is.
Don't you think he feels like he feels 

4362
03:04:44,351 --> 03:04:45,890
that after people heard that he's been 
forgiven by hollywood.

4363
03:04:46,010 --> 03:04:48,630
You feel like shit after that.
Yeah,

4364
03:04:49,940 --> 03:04:52,100
it's awful.
That was my.

4365
03:04:52,101 --> 03:04:53,690
Actually,
my first was my first words,

4366
03:04:53,691 --> 03:04:55,370
my mother when I was a baby.
It's awful.

4367
03:04:55,400 --> 03:04:57,110
No,
I said you were a road thoughtless pig.

4368
03:04:57,260 --> 03:04:57,910
Wow.
Yeah.

4369
03:04:58,250 --> 03:05:00,270
That's amazing.
You just formed that sentence like,

4370
03:05:00,560 --> 03:05:05,560
I know.
What was it that you were like stewing 

4371
03:05:05,560 --> 03:05:06,110
on until your lips form correctly so you
can make good noises?

4372
03:05:06,620 --> 03:05:09,500
I think it's just she wasn't feeding me 
enough.

4373
03:05:09,570 --> 03:05:12,560
You know?
It's just happened,

4374
03:05:12,561 --> 03:05:14,860
man.
Yeah.

4375
03:05:14,870 --> 03:05:19,870
It's.
Imagine if babies could talk right out 

4376
03:05:19,870 --> 03:05:19,870
of the box,
man.

4377
03:05:19,870 --> 03:05:23,980
If they had a full vocabulary,
the on the line right there would be so 

4378
03:05:23,980 --> 03:05:25,160
stupid.
They don't know full babies.

4379
03:05:25,220 --> 03:05:26,230
They'd be like,
monster.

4380
03:05:26,410 --> 03:05:28,060
I'm a monster dummy.
And we dad,

4381
03:05:28,130 --> 03:05:30,170
they would do everything.
They would also be like,

4382
03:05:30,200 --> 03:05:32,640
I'm going to eat this.
Everything would be like know,

4383
03:05:32,700 --> 03:05:34,430
like no plastic.

4384
03:05:34,510 --> 03:05:35,370
No,
no.

4385
03:05:35,420 --> 03:05:40,420
Eat hair rock.
Can I stick my finger inside that light 

4386
03:05:40,420 --> 03:05:40,420
socket?
Know what if I turned it on?

4387
03:05:40,590 --> 03:05:42,100
No.
And no.

4388
03:05:42,110 --> 03:05:44,000
Becomes Like,
this is going to be fucking awesome.

4389
03:05:44,090 --> 03:05:49,090
That's what they do.
Know what my six year old loves to tell 

4390
03:05:49,090 --> 03:05:50,771
me.
Can I tell you something right before 

4391
03:05:50,771 --> 03:05:50,810
she's going to tell me something?
Yeah,

4392
03:05:51,020 --> 03:05:52,250
she goes,
can I tell you something?

4393
03:05:52,280 --> 03:05:53,860
It's always kind of tell you Something 
that's fun,

4394
03:05:53,900 --> 03:05:54,760
you know?
Yeah.

4395
03:05:54,830 --> 03:05:59,090
Can I tell you something?
Debbie told this girl that she shouldn't

4396
03:05:59,091 --> 03:06:01,730
do that because she wasn't allowed and 
it wasn't true.

4397
03:06:02,450 --> 03:06:03,230
And what do you do?
You go,

4398
03:06:03,231 --> 03:06:04,080
whoa.
Yeah.

4399
03:06:04,180 --> 03:06:05,900
It was the kind of conversation you have
With six year olds.

4400
03:06:05,910 --> 03:06:06,740
Like,
wow,

4401
03:06:06,770 --> 03:06:11,770
why wasn't she allowed?
Because her mother doesn't want her to 

4402
03:06:11,770 --> 03:06:14,920
do it,
but she doesn't want to listen to her 

4403
03:06:14,920 --> 03:06:15,070
mother.
Whoa,

4404
03:06:15,380 --> 03:06:19,310
that's crazy outrage in kindergarten.

4405
03:06:20,240 --> 03:06:21,800
Really funny.
That's their world.

4406
03:06:22,210 --> 03:06:24,980
Know that's life.
I know that his life,

4407
03:06:24,981 --> 03:06:26,840
you've got to respect that.
That's what's weird.

4408
03:06:26,870 --> 03:06:27,980
You know,
they get upset,

4409
03:06:28,790 --> 03:06:31,600
they get upset if you don't want to 
listen to their wacky stories,

4410
03:06:32,880 --> 03:06:37,880
like the fucking boring story.
One of the things I've been teaching my 

4411
03:06:37,880 --> 03:06:38,420
kids lately is don't repeat punchlines 
over and over and over again,

4412
03:06:38,690 --> 03:06:43,690
because when they nail punch lines,
sometimes they'll say something really 

4413
03:06:43,690 --> 03:06:43,690
funny and I said,
listen,

4414
03:06:43,690 --> 03:06:44,120
that's really funny.
You said it was really.

4415
03:06:44,180 --> 03:06:47,530
It was really funny.
I'm so like,

4416
03:06:47,540 --> 03:06:49,420
I'm so impressed.
He said something that was out fighting.

4417
03:06:49,421 --> 03:06:51,170
It's really funny,
but here's the thing,

4418
03:06:51,530 --> 03:06:55,040
if you say it again becomes less funny 
and if you say it,

4419
03:06:55,920 --> 03:06:58,950
it gets even less funny.
Like every time you repeat it.

4420
03:06:59,070 --> 03:07:01,920
I know it's fun to say something funny.
You want to do it,

4421
03:07:02,330 --> 03:07:07,330
but I'm like,
unless you're doing a new show the next 

4422
03:07:07,330 --> 03:07:08,940
night in new town kit or the same time 
they get that crowd.

4423
03:07:09,090 --> 03:07:10,170
Yeah,
kinda getting it.

4424
03:07:10,180 --> 03:07:11,630
Yeah,
kinda getting it.

4425
03:07:11,640 --> 03:07:12,480
But it's,
you know,

4426
03:07:13,200 --> 03:07:13,980
it's touchy,
right?

4427
03:07:14,010 --> 03:07:19,010
Yeah.
Because you don't want to discourage 

4428
03:07:19,010 --> 03:07:19,010
anybody from saying something funny and 
silly.

4429
03:07:19,010 --> 03:07:22,100
Sure.
Like they make each other laugh all the 

4430
03:07:22,100 --> 03:07:22,100
time.
They make me laugh.

4431
03:07:22,100 --> 03:07:25,130
We have these funny conversations.
It's funny having like joke 

4432
03:07:25,130 --> 03:07:26,340
conversations where they're like 
cracking me up and they're eight.

4433
03:07:26,670 --> 03:07:28,020
Yeah.
Because like in my,

4434
03:07:28,050 --> 03:07:30,660
in my house,
like you're like head writer and stuff.

4435
03:07:30,690 --> 03:07:32,730
Yeah.
Goofing on stuff is valuable.

4436
03:07:33,370 --> 03:07:38,370
It's valuable.
So like I mean invaluable in terms of 

4437
03:07:38,370 --> 03:07:38,450
like social commodity,
like it's,

4438
03:07:38,451 --> 03:07:40,260
it's hilarious.
Like when one of them will say something

4439
03:07:40,261 --> 03:07:45,261
funny and we all laugh,
you could see the little eyes light up 

4440
03:07:45,261 --> 03:07:45,261
and then they want to make you laugh 
more.

4441
03:07:45,261 --> 03:07:50,100
You know,
and it's also when you find out things 

4442
03:07:50,100 --> 03:07:53,961
that make people laugh,
you find out things that are ridiculous 

4443
03:07:53,961 --> 03:07:56,961
that no one's talking about.
Like that's part of part of what's 

4444
03:07:56,961 --> 03:07:57,610
funny.
When when kids point something out,

4445
03:07:57,611 --> 03:07:58,320
I was like,
yeah,

4446
03:07:58,350 --> 03:08:03,350
duh.
Fucking six year old notices that 

4447
03:08:03,350 --> 03:08:05,811
stupid.
Like they tap into something like my 

4448
03:08:05,811 --> 03:08:07,250
daughter was looking at one of those fat
freeze billboards.

4449
03:08:07,280 --> 03:08:10,530
You'll see that fat freeze billboard.
This is when she was five.

4450
03:08:10,800 --> 03:08:15,800
She goes,
I know that's fake because that girls 

4451
03:08:15,800 --> 03:08:16,590
pulling in a stoMach.
Oh right.

4452
03:08:16,680 --> 03:08:17,370
Oh that's cute.

4453
03:08:19,540 --> 03:08:22,420
She's sucking her stomach in and she's 
not even tricking a five year old.

4454
03:08:22,421 --> 03:08:24,840
That's hilarious.
but when she would she say it to me,

4455
03:08:24,841 --> 03:08:29,841
I'm fucking crying,
laughing and you see your little eyes 

4456
03:08:29,841 --> 03:08:32,661
light up because the way she said I 
didn't do a good justice with the 

4457
03:08:32,661 --> 03:08:32,661
delivery.
Sure.

4458
03:08:32,661 --> 03:08:34,680
But she was like cocky about it.
I know that.

4459
03:08:34,700 --> 03:08:36,080
And then she kicked out that you're 
lying.

4460
03:08:36,420 --> 03:08:37,920
She thinks it's so funny.
She's like,

4461
03:08:37,950 --> 03:08:40,650
she's holding the stomach.
Look at a daddy.

4462
03:08:40,990 --> 03:08:45,990
So holding in the stomach like a five 
year old can see that nobody's stands 

4463
03:08:45,990 --> 03:08:46,350
like this.
Yeah.

4464
03:08:46,530 --> 03:08:51,530
So you know,
kylie jenner sued those people who made 

4465
03:08:51,530 --> 03:08:52,080
that because that girl in the sign 
looked like her.

4466
03:08:52,680 --> 03:08:53,460
Oh really?
Yeah,

4467
03:08:53,461 --> 03:08:58,461
they do that.
They've done that before we can sue 

4468
03:08:58,461 --> 03:08:59,430
someone for looking like you.
Kim kardashian turned down some campaign

4469
03:08:59,431 --> 03:09:02,700
and so they hired a kim kardashian look 
alike and she sued them and won.

4470
03:09:02,730 --> 03:09:04,110
I think she won,
didn't she?

4471
03:09:04,111 --> 03:09:07,720
When jamie told larry said,
fucking five,

4472
03:09:07,760 --> 03:09:08,470
5:00
bed.

4473
03:09:08,471 --> 03:09:10,770
Shoot.
Where you going home?

4474
03:09:11,660 --> 03:09:13,410
Time to show tonight.
I shows at eight.

4475
03:09:13,411 --> 03:09:18,411
What time should I leave?
Jesus christ should have already left 

4476
03:09:18,411 --> 03:09:18,411
your fuck dude.
I get going.

4477
03:09:18,411 --> 03:09:19,470
I got to get the past dean in three 
hours.

4478
03:09:19,880 --> 03:09:21,810
and also the show.
Who's opening for you?

4479
03:09:22,020 --> 03:09:23,490
Doug mellard.
Really funny guy.

4480
03:09:23,970 --> 03:09:25,860
Really funny guy from austin.
Lives here.

4481
03:09:25,920 --> 03:09:27,270
Real funny.
How long has he been here?

4482
03:09:27,300 --> 03:09:28,770
did I meet him?
You may have met him.

4483
03:09:29,550 --> 03:09:32,700
He's been here for awhile.
He's been doing standup awhile and um,

4484
03:09:33,030 --> 03:09:34,860
I've had brought them with me a few 
times.

4485
03:09:34,861 --> 03:09:35,640
He's really funny.
Dude.

4486
03:09:35,680 --> 03:09:40,680
this is like a feeling that you get when
someone says there's a really funny guy 

4487
03:09:40,680 --> 03:09:40,680
from austin.
You go,

4488
03:09:40,680 --> 03:09:40,680
oh,
he's probably cool.

4489
03:09:40,680 --> 03:09:41,190
Yeah,
he's pretty cool.

4490
03:09:41,790 --> 03:09:43,520
He doesn't really cool vests.

4491
03:09:44,310 --> 03:09:44,790
No,
no.

4492
03:09:44,791 --> 03:09:47,070
He doesn't have.
He's a but he's.

4493
03:09:47,100 --> 03:09:49,470
He's a very funny guy.
Dresses like a mumford and sons.

4494
03:09:49,880 --> 03:09:52,110
Yes.
Like the mood music videos.

4495
03:09:52,380 --> 03:09:55,210
He looked like he'd be in the band.
Was a piano in the middle of a field for

4496
03:09:55,211 --> 03:09:57,640
no fucking reason.
We're all dancing around it.

4497
03:09:58,090 --> 03:10:00,670
He's got just like funny,
ironic tattoos and shit.

4498
03:10:00,710 --> 03:10:01,690
Oh,
does he?

4499
03:10:01,720 --> 03:10:02,410
Yeah.
He's got a few.

4500
03:10:02,470 --> 03:10:03,440
Keep on trucking.
You know,

4501
03:10:03,600 --> 03:10:07,050
has keep on trucking on time.
Canadian have some facility,

4502
03:10:07,060 --> 03:10:08,680
one like that too.
Does he?

4503
03:10:08,710 --> 03:10:12,880
I think he does get some.
He has some silly ones.

4504
03:10:13,270 --> 03:10:14,320
Yeah.
No attached yet.

4505
03:10:14,470 --> 03:10:19,470
No.
Are you thinking about getting 

4506
03:10:19,470 --> 03:10:19,470
something?
No.

4507
03:10:19,470 --> 03:10:19,470
No.
just don't have.

4508
03:10:19,470 --> 03:10:19,710
I mean I would if I had a fucking desire
to interest,

4509
03:10:19,711 --> 03:10:20,740
but I don't.
How about this?

4510
03:10:20,741 --> 03:10:22,690
Let's go chain across your belly.
Dude.

4511
03:10:23,200 --> 03:10:24,940
Let's Go champ.
How great was that?

4512
03:10:24,941 --> 03:10:25,330
Above that?

4513
03:10:25,330 --> 03:10:27,220
Right across your belly.
Like compton.

4514
03:10:28,070 --> 03:10:29,260
This.
Let's go champ.

4515
03:10:29,290 --> 03:10:30,850
Yeah.
How the fuck does no one have that?

4516
03:10:30,851 --> 03:10:32,020
Jamie,
please look up.

4517
03:10:32,170 --> 03:10:33,970
See if anyone has.
Let's go champ.

4518
03:10:33,971 --> 03:10:36,070
Tattooed on their belly.
They must.

4519
03:10:36,100 --> 03:10:37,950
That's bad ass did.
They should totally have.

4520
03:10:37,970 --> 03:10:42,220
That's dope.
That is a dove at champ and it was given

4521
03:10:42,221 --> 03:10:44,900
to me by shannon mechanics.
No,

4522
03:10:46,330 --> 03:10:47,470
he's a great guy,
man.

4523
03:10:47,830 --> 03:10:52,830
He's a fun dude.
Like real positive and I didn't see the 

4524
03:10:52,830 --> 03:10:53,020
episode.
I didn't listen to it,

4525
03:10:53,021 --> 03:10:58,021
but um,
I saw his instagram preparing to come 

4526
03:10:58,021 --> 03:10:58,110
here and that got me fired up like in.
Oh yeah.

4527
03:10:58,120 --> 03:11:03,120
It was like putting blue man.
he's going to wash them,

4528
03:11:05,440 --> 03:11:06,280
man.
I was fired up.

4529
03:11:08,860 --> 03:11:10,570
I'm Going to angeles.
Yeah,

4530
03:11:10,640 --> 03:11:11,470
that was awesome.
Yeah,

4531
03:11:11,471 --> 03:11:16,471
he's awesome man.
That was so fun for me to be sitting 

4532
03:11:16,471 --> 03:11:16,471
across from him.
That's my,

4533
03:11:16,471 --> 03:11:17,830
that's my ring tone now.
Is it?

4534
03:11:17,860 --> 03:11:18,580
That's right.
Bitch.

4535
03:11:18,581 --> 03:11:20,410
Fucking amazing.
Yeah.

4536
03:11:20,440 --> 03:11:22,210
We've got to figure out a way to set 
that up.

4537
03:11:22,211 --> 03:11:27,211
But jamie isolated that form of calls.
I would keep that for years.

4538
03:11:30,250 --> 03:11:32,830
That's fantastic.
That is fantastic.

4539
03:11:32,831 --> 03:11:36,010
I remember I'll probably watch the first
video is up and I knew shannon,

4540
03:11:36,011 --> 03:11:37,930
I was a fan of his as a boxer for a long
time,

4541
03:11:38,260 --> 03:11:40,000
but when I watched that video of him I 
was like,

4542
03:11:40,001 --> 03:11:40,900
wow,
this is crazy.

4543
03:11:40,901 --> 03:11:41,800
Like,
what is he doing?

4544
03:11:41,801 --> 03:11:44,350
Like this is interesting.
Those are cinderblocks.

4545
03:11:44,460 --> 03:11:45,370
Oh,
he's a big boy.

4546
03:11:46,150 --> 03:11:48,910
Quite a quite a large fellow.
When I hug them I'm like,

4547
03:11:48,911 --> 03:11:52,960
hi buddy.
My head nestle's next to his breasts.

4548
03:11:53,290 --> 03:11:53,860
That would hurt.

4549
03:11:53,980 --> 03:11:55,420
Well,
he's a big boxer.

4550
03:11:55,480 --> 03:12:00,480
He's big.
He's probably walking around in the to 

4551
03:12:00,480 --> 03:12:00,610
50 range or to 40 range.
That connects with the chin.

4552
03:12:00,611 --> 03:12:01,930
Powerful punch room.
It's over.

4553
03:12:02,050 --> 03:12:03,880
Yeah.
He was a serious knockout puncher.

4554
03:12:04,510 --> 03:12:09,510
Shannon can crack.
He's also got this wicked left hook to 

4555
03:12:09,510 --> 03:12:09,760
the body.
He's got a nasty jab,

4556
03:12:09,910 --> 03:12:14,910
but he's got this left hook to the body.
That's really rare to see in the 

4557
03:12:14,910 --> 03:12:14,910
heavyweight division.
Yeah,

4558
03:12:14,910 --> 03:12:17,530
super quick.
Technical stabbing,

4559
03:12:17,531 --> 03:12:20,710
left hook.
Just black gets under your rib cage with

4560
03:12:20,711 --> 03:12:22,420
it.
He just dropped guys.

4561
03:12:22,690 --> 03:12:24,780
He's getting avoided.
A lot of people don't want to fight him.

4562
03:12:24,970 --> 03:12:26,410
Don't want a piece of that man.
Well,

4563
03:12:26,440 --> 03:12:28,350
he's a big guy,
he's a,

4564
03:12:28,390 --> 03:12:32,500
he's still real dangerous,
he's real motivated and he talks so much

4565
03:12:32,501 --> 03:12:34,480
shit.
He talked so much shit,

4566
03:12:34,481 --> 03:12:36,730
they can't take it in.
And the people that are,

4567
03:12:37,250 --> 03:12:39,610
they're going to these press conferences
with them and he's talking,

4568
03:12:39,640 --> 03:12:44,640
he's like yelling at them,
trying to get fights with them and 

4569
03:12:44,640 --> 03:12:47,230
they're uh,
they're all at the press conference 

4570
03:12:47,230 --> 03:12:47,230
announcing another fight and he's in the
audience.

4571
03:12:47,230 --> 03:12:48,700
He shows up.
Oh man.

4572
03:12:49,000 --> 03:12:51,090
He showed up at vladimir klitschkos,
uh,

4573
03:12:51,410 --> 03:12:52,310
was eaten lunch.

4574
03:12:52,570 --> 03:12:56,900
He started drinking his water and he 
started eating his food.

4575
03:12:56,920 --> 03:12:57,710
yeah.
Yeah.

4576
03:12:57,711 --> 03:12:58,350
And when you,
we,

4577
03:12:58,440 --> 03:13:00,980
we,
we helped us go champ,

4578
03:13:01,060 --> 03:13:01,900
you know,
shit.

4579
03:13:01,901 --> 03:13:02,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

4580
03:13:02,361 --> 03:13:05,190
And that was when I started being aware 
of them and I was like,

4581
03:13:05,210 --> 03:13:06,290
my god,
he's crazy.

4582
03:13:06,291 --> 03:13:08,720
Like shannon briggs has gone crazy.
And then I realized,

4583
03:13:08,750 --> 03:13:13,750
oh,
he's just trying a new thing to make a 

4584
03:13:13,750 --> 03:13:17,161
good get,
get guys to fight and make a name for 

4585
03:13:17,161 --> 03:13:17,161
himself.
And he's really smart because he figured

4586
03:13:17,161 --> 03:13:21,020
out a way to use social media and he 
completely changed how people thought of

4587
03:13:21,021 --> 03:13:24,440
him because people thought of them 
before they knew about his personality.

4588
03:13:24,590 --> 03:13:27,800
They just thought he was this killer 
boxer even talked about on the podcast.

4589
03:13:27,801 --> 03:13:30,340
He was like,
I just wasn't me because I was like,

4590
03:13:30,680 --> 03:13:32,060
just always,
you know,

4591
03:13:32,140 --> 03:13:37,140
be in this heavyweight knockout artist.
And he's a tough guy.

4592
03:13:37,280 --> 03:13:38,210
He's like,
I'm goofy.

4593
03:13:38,410 --> 03:13:40,610
He was like a goof around a lot.
I'm always joking around.

4594
03:13:40,940 --> 03:13:44,000
So you see that in those videos and 
that's something that there was no other

4595
03:13:44,001 --> 03:13:47,930
way for him to ever show that key magic 
hbo came to his house and like,

4596
03:13:47,931 --> 03:13:50,060
we want to watch it will workout.
Let's go champ,

4597
03:13:50,480 --> 03:13:51,440
let's go.
They were like,

4598
03:13:51,470 --> 03:13:53,330
cut all that out.
Just cut all that out.

4599
03:13:53,331 --> 03:13:55,730
Well then they would learn that that's 
what's gonna make it a sensation,

4600
03:13:55,731 --> 03:13:56,920
a hit.
You know what?

4601
03:13:56,921 --> 03:13:59,960
I think he had to do it like over and 
over and over and over and over again on

4602
03:13:59,961 --> 03:14:03,430
youtube and on instagram for people to 
get addicted to it.

4603
03:14:03,650 --> 03:14:07,400
Because now like when I see it in my 
feed and it's shannon's sitting in front

4604
03:14:07,401 --> 03:14:09,650
of like a bowl of food or something with
a big smile on his face,

4605
03:14:09,690 --> 03:14:11,030
I always click on other videos.

4606
03:14:11,030 --> 03:14:12,520
I want to hear it because it's,
it's,

4607
03:14:13,820 --> 03:14:15,410
it's him.
That's who he is.

4608
03:14:15,500 --> 03:14:20,500
I think that's one of the coolest things
about Your show that you have with you 

4609
03:14:20,500 --> 03:14:24,971
and christina.
Your mom's house is you guys just 

4610
03:14:24,971 --> 03:14:27,820
totally genuine.
That's 100 percent how you guys are all 

4611
03:14:27,820 --> 03:14:27,820
the time.
That's true.

4612
03:14:27,820 --> 03:14:28,460
So like that's not available anywhere 
else.

4613
03:14:28,461 --> 03:14:31,430
Like he can tell when something gets 
popular,

4614
03:14:31,431 --> 03:14:32,630
you know,
or it gets a fan based.

4615
03:14:32,631 --> 03:14:36,020
It's because people connect to the 
authenticity I think of,

4616
03:14:36,090 --> 03:14:37,910
of,
of people's real personalities.

4617
03:14:38,780 --> 03:14:40,790
Yeah man.
There's definitely that.

4618
03:14:41,060 --> 03:14:42,170
And there's also like,
there's,

4619
03:14:42,320 --> 03:14:47,060
there's less people from shannon doing 
that.

4620
03:14:47,270 --> 03:14:50,930
There's almost no filters between him 
and People.

4621
03:14:50,990 --> 03:14:52,430
There's less people involved.
Yeah.

4622
03:14:52,580 --> 03:14:57,580
So you could get to see this guy like 
who he really is and there's so many 

4623
03:14:57,580 --> 03:14:57,580
people like that now,
like joey diaz,

4624
03:14:57,580 --> 03:14:59,510
when jody is,
does those periscopes accuses?

4625
03:14:59,550 --> 03:15:02,930
It's beautiful because it's like 
straight to joey,

4626
03:15:03,020 --> 03:15:05,000
straight to joey,
this no one even around,

4627
03:15:05,001 --> 03:15:07,670
he gets some open number,
gets up in the morning,

4628
03:15:07,671 --> 03:15:12,671
it gives you like a few minutes notice 
we're going live with smoking numbers 

4629
03:15:12,671 --> 03:15:13,670
and then he gets on,
what did you do today?

4630
03:15:14,300 --> 03:15:17,750
And he starts talking about it.
It makes these tweets and the ridiculous

4631
03:15:17,751 --> 03:15:18,440
like,
you know,

4632
03:15:18,441 --> 03:15:23,441
it's monday,
you're showing up with a big dick and a 

4633
03:15:23,441 --> 03:15:23,441
smile.
And I'm like,

4634
03:15:23,441 --> 03:15:23,441
okay,
I have a big deck,

4635
03:15:23,441 --> 03:15:24,010
but it's,
yeah,

4636
03:15:24,410 --> 03:15:26,840
people love that guy.
He's awesome.

4637
03:15:26,870 --> 03:15:28,100
But that's joey like,
you know,

4638
03:15:28,101 --> 03:15:33,101
you're getting joey,
100 percent joey spellings all fucked 

4639
03:15:33,101 --> 03:15:33,101
up.
He has to indeed periods in a row.

4640
03:15:33,101 --> 03:15:35,390
It doesn't matter.
It's just you're getting straight joey,

4641
03:15:35,760 --> 03:15:36,560
you know,
and that's,

4642
03:15:36,830 --> 03:15:41,830
that's one of the more unique things 
about this time and those goddamn 

4643
03:15:41,830 --> 03:15:42,200
glasses that we were playing them.

4644
03:15:42,200 --> 03:15:43,340
When you,
when you went to pee,

4645
03:15:43,780 --> 03:15:46,100
they'll snapchat glasses.
Those things scare the shit out of me.

4646
03:15:46,550 --> 03:15:48,590
What are you aware of them?
And they snapchat everything.

4647
03:15:48,591 --> 03:15:51,150
Exactly of what we're talking about,
about recording memories.

4648
03:15:51,440 --> 03:15:52,890
You're going to record things that 
people see.

4649
03:15:52,891 --> 03:15:56,540
This guy was doing a operation goggles 
on and yeah,

4650
03:15:56,690 --> 03:15:58,530
it's just going to be able to stream 
your life.

4651
03:15:59,580 --> 03:16:04,580
These things are cameras,
those things in the upper right hand 

4652
03:16:04,580 --> 03:16:05,700
side are cameras and there was this 
video that we were watching him,

4653
03:16:05,701 --> 03:16:10,701
this guy doing an operation,
cutting this person open while he's 

4654
03:16:10,701 --> 03:16:14,270
wearing these snapchat glasses and it's.
It's so strange because you're realizing

4655
03:16:14,971 --> 03:16:16,440
like,
oh,

4656
03:16:16,441 --> 03:16:21,040
this is like the motorola razor.
This is like the motorola razor.

4657
03:16:21,270 --> 03:16:23,100
One day we're gonna have the iphone 
seven.

4658
03:16:23,700 --> 03:16:26,550
I think it's crazy that we're talking 
about $130.

4659
03:16:26,551 --> 03:16:28,140
I thought we were talking about some 
really,

4660
03:16:28,170 --> 03:16:28,530
you know.

4661
03:16:28,570 --> 03:16:29,190
No,
no,

4662
03:16:29,191 --> 03:16:29,580
no,
no.

4663
03:16:29,581 --> 03:16:32,100
And it streams snap for the staff chat 
app.

4664
03:16:32,370 --> 03:16:35,070
And if you look at it this now come on 
man.

4665
03:16:35,071 --> 03:16:40,071
This is like that fallen that kirk 
douglas or Michael Douglas had in wall 

4666
03:16:40,071 --> 03:16:40,071
street,
right?

4667
03:16:40,260 --> 03:16:42,780
That's basically what it is in 
comparison to what they're going to have

4668
03:16:42,840 --> 03:16:44,990
just in a few years from now texting 
people row,

4669
03:16:45,170 --> 03:16:50,170
but I gotta get.
I gotta get the fuck out of here and 

4670
03:16:50,170 --> 03:16:52,910
wrap this up.
Unfortunately in it tommy bonds,

4671
03:16:53,311 --> 03:16:55,740
please do.
I have a tour coming up.

4672
03:16:55,770 --> 03:16:57,990
It's my first theater tour ever.
Shit,

4673
03:16:58,290 --> 03:17:00,540
by the way,
I just want to tell you very inspiring.

4674
03:17:00,810 --> 03:17:05,810
Watch you do that.
Set the other night in the main room 

4675
03:17:05,810 --> 03:17:05,810
doing all new material that I haven't 
seen before and it was really fun.

4676
03:17:06,200 --> 03:17:06,950
Thanks man.
Thanks.

4677
03:17:06,960 --> 03:17:08,260
That was really fun.
Thank you.

4678
03:17:08,320 --> 03:17:09,310
I've been working since,
you know,

4679
03:17:09,410 --> 03:17:14,410
the last one came out and I'm about at 
an hour now and so the tour starts 

4680
03:17:14,410 --> 03:17:18,470
january and going like coast to coast 
Canada doing a bunch of bunch of dates.

4681
03:17:18,510 --> 03:17:19,240
Men.
YeAh,

4682
03:17:19,280 --> 03:17:20,590
we could tell.
You can tell.

4683
03:17:20,591 --> 03:17:21,910
You tell you're putting in the time.
That's,

4684
03:17:21,911 --> 03:17:26,911
you know,
that's one of the cool things about 

4685
03:17:26,911 --> 03:17:29,880
being in la because I get to see so many
guys like you and joey

4686
03:17:30,190 --> 03:17:35,190
bar and ari and duncan and all these 
guys that are just really fucking funny 

4687
03:17:35,411 --> 03:17:37,600
in this one area.
Like all the time.

4688
03:17:37,630 --> 03:17:37,840
Yeah.

4689
03:17:38,190 --> 03:17:38,810
Yeah.
Great.

4690
03:17:38,811 --> 03:17:43,811
To see other people do like people you 
people I love and that I look up to and 

4691
03:17:44,520 --> 03:17:47,240
stand up.
Do sets regular here in crush,

4692
03:17:47,241 --> 03:17:48,140
you're like,
oh shit.

4693
03:17:48,340 --> 03:17:49,700
It always keeps you on your toes,
man.

4694
03:17:49,790 --> 03:17:54,790
Do.
The other night dave chappelle brought 

4695
03:17:54,790 --> 03:17:55,430
up chris rock the store.
Get the fuck out of dodge.

4696
03:17:55,490 --> 03:18:00,490
He's going on a tour.
Not that he needs to fucking plug or 

4697
03:18:00,490 --> 03:18:00,490
chris rock brought up.
Dave chappelle,

4698
03:18:00,490 --> 03:18:00,620
one of those,
but either way,

4699
03:18:00,680 --> 03:18:05,680
get the fuck outta here,
but that's a first tour in nine years 

4700
03:18:05,680 --> 03:18:06,890
for rock divorce.
Divorce is a motherfucker.

4701
03:18:06,920 --> 03:18:08,950
Yeah.
It talks about it on stage tonight.

4702
03:18:08,960 --> 03:18:11,090
Gary,
did I tell you so I did a.

4703
03:18:11,120 --> 03:18:12,870
I opened for chappelle.
I did like it.

4704
03:18:12,890 --> 03:18:13,520
I shouldn't say,
oh,

4705
03:18:13,580 --> 03:18:15,200
did a 10 minutes set.
I stopped by his.

4706
03:18:15,230 --> 03:18:16,880
When I was in New York.
I stopped by his show.

4707
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:18,620
Where was he?
He was at the grammercy.

4708
03:18:18,680 --> 03:18:23,680
Just four huNdred seat place.
Feels like doing it and it was before 

4709
03:18:23,680 --> 03:18:24,050
snl,
but before they announced it,

4710
03:18:24,380 --> 03:18:26,810
so I was doing caroline's and I pop over
there and they're like,

4711
03:18:26,840 --> 03:18:28,010
oh yeah,
do time.

4712
03:18:28,011 --> 03:18:30,590
And he like,
just some time in I go to time,

4713
03:18:31,220 --> 03:18:32,870
I do like 10 minutes I get,
they don't see me.

4714
03:18:32,871 --> 03:18:34,130
THey're like,
fuck is dave chappelle,

4715
03:18:34,370 --> 03:18:39,370
so I get off.
He goes up and he starts doing this set 

4716
03:18:39,370 --> 03:18:44,020
and then chris rock walks out and then 
they pull up chairs and they basically 

4717
03:18:44,020 --> 03:18:44,930
have a cow.
It's like a podcast.

4718
03:18:44,931 --> 03:18:45,760
It's basically a lab.

4719
03:18:45,820 --> 03:18:47,710
Ah,
a riff.

4720
03:18:47,711 --> 03:18:48,070
And they go

4721
03:18:48,070 --> 03:18:50,950
on shit.
And one point chappelle goes,

4722
03:18:51,130 --> 03:18:52,200
he's like,
you say like,

4723
03:18:52,210 --> 03:18:55,550
you say the wildest shit though to rock.
Yeah.

4724
03:18:55,640 --> 03:18:58,720
He's like,
what you mean man?

4725
03:18:58,810 --> 03:18:59,400
He said,
wow.

4726
03:19:00,280 --> 03:19:01,900
He saId,
he in chappelle goes,

4727
03:19:01,960 --> 03:19:05,980
you called me after your divorce and 
said,

4728
03:19:06,670 --> 03:19:08,950
uh,
my wife has more comedy,

4729
03:19:09,100 --> 03:19:11,110
more money from,
from comedy than you do.

4730
03:19:11,920 --> 03:19:13,870
And I was like,
that's such a funny.

4731
03:19:14,260 --> 03:19:19,260
Chris rock said that to dave chappelle.
My wife has more money from comedy than 

4732
03:19:19,260 --> 03:19:20,380
you do after divorcing.
Wow.

4733
03:19:20,400 --> 03:19:24,700
Like how funny though of a have a 
thought about your situation?

4734
03:19:24,790 --> 03:19:26,320
You know,
that is a funny thought.

4735
03:19:26,360 --> 03:19:28,210
YeaH.
It's also a lot of money.

4736
03:19:28,540 --> 03:19:30,100
It must be insane.
Yeah.

4737
03:19:30,200 --> 03:19:32,650
Because chappelle's made a lot of 
fucking money and rocks.

4738
03:19:32,651 --> 03:19:33,280
Yeah.
Well,

4739
03:19:33,281 --> 03:19:38,281
rock was probably one of the most 
successful guys ever when he was doing 

4740
03:19:38,281 --> 03:19:38,281
theaters like those.
I mean,

4741
03:19:38,281 --> 03:19:39,720
not theaters arenas and he was doing 
world tours to.

4742
03:19:39,730 --> 03:19:41,410
I don't think that he did the hollywood 
bowl.

4743
03:19:41,470 --> 03:19:42,390
Yeah,
it's insane.

4744
03:19:42,400 --> 03:19:44,380
He does giant spots.
A lot of money.

4745
03:19:44,800 --> 03:19:49,800
Oh,
insane amounts of money and it all went 

4746
03:19:49,800 --> 03:19:50,350
away to the girl.
This tour,

4747
03:19:50,470 --> 03:19:52,780
it's called get that money back,
so it's called.

4748
03:19:53,260 --> 03:19:55,200
I wonder if he just paid off a giant 
chunks.

4749
03:19:55,201 --> 03:19:57,580
We didn't have to pay forever.
There was a timeline on it.

4750
03:19:58,330 --> 03:19:58,980
Yeah,
there was a.

4751
03:19:59,000 --> 03:19:59,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

4752
03:19:59,560 --> 03:20:02,710
Because all this stuff was announced.
The big netflix.

4753
03:20:02,780 --> 03:20:04,660
I don't even want to know how much money
he paid.

4754
03:20:04,661 --> 03:20:09,661
I'm sure it's so much money.
It's so insane that we pretend that if 

4755
03:20:09,661 --> 03:20:13,951
two people in a relationship,
one person makes all the money that 

4756
03:20:13,951 --> 03:20:15,640
somehow or another there's an even deal.
So crazy.

4757
03:20:16,800 --> 03:20:18,550
it's so weird.
I got to piss again.

4758
03:20:18,670 --> 03:20:20,530
Go ahead and study.
Go piss and I'll wrap this up.

4759
03:20:20,531 --> 03:20:21,910
Okay.
We'll talk about your tour when you come

4760
03:20:21,911 --> 03:20:23,140
back.
We'll finish it up.

4761
03:20:23,170 --> 03:20:25,090
Are you sure?
What about the dates?

4762
03:20:25,091 --> 03:20:26,380
You want to give specific dates?

4763
03:20:28,570 --> 03:20:33,070
The tool with tommy bonds,
the no teeth,

4764
03:20:33,071 --> 03:20:37,810
no entry tour and uh,
all built shit aside because tommy's not

4765
03:20:37,811 --> 03:20:40,240
in the room right now.
There's new stuff is a little shaky.

4766
03:20:41,200 --> 03:20:42,880
no,
it's really funny.

4767
03:20:43,060 --> 03:20:44,260
He made.
I was,

4768
03:20:44,500 --> 03:20:46,540
he's got one bit like,
I don't want to spoiler alert it,

4769
03:20:46,840 --> 03:20:49,360
but he's got one bit that's like really 
intricate.

4770
03:20:49,361 --> 03:20:51,520
And at the end of it I was like,
holy shit,

4771
03:20:51,521 --> 03:20:52,930
that's good.
And when you're,

4772
03:20:52,931 --> 03:20:55,750
when you're a funny guy like tom already
is and you're,

4773
03:20:56,400 --> 03:21:01,400
you know,
you're putting out stuff and then you 

4774
03:21:01,400 --> 03:21:03,001
have to write new stuff.
THe new stuff represents the new level 

4775
03:21:03,001 --> 03:21:06,541
of funny.
He is us the last throat clearing of 

4776
03:21:06,611 --> 03:21:08,710
this show folks.
I promise this is a rough one,

4777
03:21:08,711 --> 03:21:10,840
right?
But yeah,

4778
03:21:10,841 --> 03:21:11,920
the fucking,
the beginning,

4779
03:21:11,940 --> 03:21:16,940
my throat just did not want to cooperate
and it was fine until I took one hit of 

4780
03:21:17,451 --> 03:21:22,451
weed and then I drank some coffee and 
then something about the coffee and the 

4781
03:21:22,451 --> 03:21:23,570
weed together just produced this.

4782
03:21:25,100 --> 03:21:29,900
We can't do that right before we go on 
stage or right before I go on the air.

4783
03:21:29,960 --> 03:21:34,960
Should do it like five minutes before.
And then do a lot of get that shit out 

4784
03:21:34,960 --> 03:21:37,340
of the way.
That makes sense.

4785
03:21:38,050 --> 03:21:40,430
I wish there was a way to solve it,
but you can't.

4786
03:21:40,490 --> 03:21:42,190
You can't cough drop or anything?
No.

4787
03:21:42,650 --> 03:21:44,330
That would probably be better than 
nothing.

4788
03:21:44,540 --> 03:21:47,210
But it's better now that we don't do the
butter coffee anymore.

4789
03:21:47,211 --> 03:21:52,211
That was fucking me up.
Too many people were complaining and 

4790
03:21:52,211 --> 03:21:54,761
they were right.
So I took pride and try not to clear my 

4791
03:21:54,761 --> 03:21:56,750
throat as much and I still fucked it up.
It's hard.

4792
03:21:57,260 --> 03:21:59,660
It's hard out there.
Tommy tommy bonds.

4793
03:21:59,720 --> 03:22:01,720
How wise no teeth,
no entry.

4794
03:22:02,040 --> 03:22:03,800
That is why not just make.
Yeah,

4795
03:22:03,801 --> 03:22:06,050
make fun of people.
People can buy that glass in short.

4796
03:22:06,110 --> 03:22:07,760
Absolutely.
They're going to come.

4797
03:22:07,970 --> 03:22:08,630
They're going to buy.
I'm like,

4798
03:22:08,631 --> 03:22:10,010
fucking crazy now.
Yeah,

4799
03:22:10,100 --> 03:22:11,580
just glass and bro.
Just classic.

4800
03:22:11,610 --> 03:22:16,610
Please tell the audience so I can have 
record that you're impressed with my 

4801
03:22:16,610 --> 03:22:16,760
water consumption.
You're the water champ.

4802
03:22:16,810 --> 03:22:19,230
Thank even the water champ for as long 
as I've known you.

4803
03:22:19,270 --> 03:22:20,120
Thank you.
I mean,

4804
03:22:20,121 --> 03:22:23,060
I've never even seen anybody try to fuck
with you or try to take that title.

4805
03:22:23,250 --> 03:22:25,040
They didn't even talk about it.
You know,

4806
03:22:25,041 --> 03:22:28,220
like you used to be lIke people would 
discuss like who was the water champ and

4807
03:22:28,221 --> 03:22:30,350
now let's just her,
the first time I met you,

4808
03:22:30,800 --> 03:22:32,540
it was in phoenix,
it was on this,

4809
03:22:32,750 --> 03:22:36,740
like the standup tour and you came up to
me after my set and you go,

4810
03:22:37,400 --> 03:22:40,730
I've never seen someone drink so much 
water during such a short set.

4811
03:22:41,260 --> 03:22:42,350
And that was like,
wow,

4812
03:22:42,550 --> 03:22:43,000
it was,
I was,

4813
03:22:43,010 --> 03:22:46,280
I felt connected to you that you like,
that's what you saw.

4814
03:22:46,320 --> 03:22:51,320
And what I recognize is unusual.
It just kept drinking and no one said a 

4815
03:22:51,320 --> 03:22:52,770
word but a,
it was almost like if you drank one more

4816
03:22:52,771 --> 03:22:57,771
bottled water,
someone would say something like you 

4817
03:22:57,771 --> 03:22:57,771
were,
you're pounding the water,

4818
03:22:57,771 --> 03:22:59,150
but you got to the point where I don't 
want to show off the water down,

4819
03:22:59,151 --> 03:23:00,950
but you let them know lIke you're not 
fucking around.

4820
03:23:00,980 --> 03:23:02,770
Is this technically a water?
That's water too.

4821
03:23:02,800 --> 03:23:03,530
So yeah,
super,

4822
03:23:03,531 --> 03:23:06,950
super water champ.
This is just water with a mild amount of

4823
03:23:06,951 --> 03:23:09,770
flavoring in it.
But um,

4824
03:23:09,860 --> 03:23:12,410
so to,
to like set out to be the water champ or

4825
03:23:12,411 --> 03:23:15,070
is it something that just happened or 
did she really have a taste?

4826
03:23:15,071 --> 03:23:16,340
Like a calling?
Yeah,

4827
03:23:16,400 --> 03:23:17,600
it's like the,
you know,

4828
03:23:17,760 --> 03:23:21,020
the guy set out to be the fuckIng.
I dunno the yoyo champ,

4829
03:23:21,130 --> 03:23:22,660
you know.
Now when you wake up in the morning,

4830
03:23:22,670 --> 03:23:24,110
do you get a p boners?

4831
03:23:24,230 --> 03:23:26,060
Are you a big boner gun?
Absolutely.

4832
03:23:26,061 --> 03:23:26,600
Must,
right?

4833
03:23:26,630 --> 03:23:28,640
Yep.
And you have to do like the straddle and

4834
03:23:28,641 --> 03:23:33,641
squat and you're like,
I gotta get this out of your drinking 

4835
03:23:33,641 --> 03:23:35,861
that much water.
There's no way you're sleeping eight 

4836
03:23:35,861 --> 03:23:35,861
hours,
right?

4837
03:23:35,861 --> 03:23:35,861
oh,
I wake up,

4838
03:23:35,861 --> 03:23:39,220
absolutely.
I have to tell myself like a child to 

4839
03:23:39,220 --> 03:23:40,040
not to not do I do that before flight.
Sometimes you don't get 6:00

4840
03:23:40,040 --> 03:23:45,040
AM flight.
I'll be walking through the airport 

4841
03:23:45,040 --> 03:23:45,040
like,
dude,

4842
03:23:45,040 --> 03:23:45,040
just don't fucking drink for the next 
hour.

4843
03:23:45,040 --> 03:23:46,970
So you can sleep on the flight,
but you don't do it usually.

4844
03:23:46,971 --> 03:23:49,960
I can't mind my overwhelming urge to 
consume more water takes.

4845
03:23:50,100 --> 03:23:51,710
It's a competitive thing too,
right?

4846
03:23:51,711 --> 03:23:56,711
It's also you're putting down numbers 
and you share these online with people 

4847
03:23:56,711 --> 03:23:57,200
and sometimes people will ask like,
how many,

4848
03:23:57,201 --> 03:23:58,880
you know,
like what's your record?

4849
03:23:58,881 --> 03:24:03,881
And I know for,
for these in a day somewhere in the 

4850
03:24:03,881 --> 03:24:06,110
fifties and then I know that like gallon
wise it's just over three.

4851
03:24:06,260 --> 03:24:11,260
Yeah.
Whenever someone wants to taLk to me 

4852
03:24:11,260 --> 03:24:12,701
about people who work out hard,
I always use the example of my friend 

4853
03:24:12,701 --> 03:24:15,800
cameron hanes to run 205 miles and even 
possibly 78 hours.

4854
03:24:15,830 --> 03:24:18,260
How's that savage?
He's a crazy person.

4855
03:24:18,290 --> 03:24:19,730
He's a crazy person.
One hundred percent,

4856
03:24:19,820 --> 03:24:22,490
but in a good way.
Like in an overachiever.

4857
03:24:23,270 --> 03:24:24,350
Just a madman.
Right?

4858
03:24:24,530 --> 03:24:26,210
But when someone's brings up,
you know,

4859
03:24:26,630 --> 03:24:28,010
dude,
I know this guy drinks a lot of water.

4860
03:24:28,011 --> 03:24:29,030
I go,
shut the fuck up.

4861
03:24:29,060 --> 03:24:30,350
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I said.

4862
03:24:30,470 --> 03:24:31,940
Shut the fuck up.
I go.

4863
03:24:31,941 --> 03:24:36,941
Just stop talking about your fucking 
shitty friend and his shitty water 

4864
03:24:36,941 --> 03:24:36,941
