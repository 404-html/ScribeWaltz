1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,270
It's always hard to stop a conversation
and then we started in a natural way

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,260
after you smoke pot at 10:00 in the
morning on a Monday.

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,720
It's just one of those things.
Lot.

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,870
Yeah,
it's too much going on.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,890
We can't be asked to start and stop a
conversation.

6
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:24,240
That was pretty smooth.
It was just like,

7
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:26,090
hey,
we're going to go.

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,680
Yeah,
this is the pot pauses are weird,

9
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:29,900
man.
Like,

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,870
and start the show data that uh,
it's really,

11
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:36,870
you got to listen to a whole theme song
and then you going to wait.

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,380
And then like how long ago?
That was the wrong way to do it.

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,800
We made a few mistakes.
The big one was um.

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,413
Oh,
is that me?

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,210
Whoops.
I haven't done that in a long time.

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,820
I thought I had this close to swear to
God.

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,410
I come the apple thing when you hit your
apple TV press play on your fucking

18
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:56,520
itunes on your computer.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,570
Does it?
Yeah.

20
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,530
All the time.
You're like,

21
00:00:58,531 --> 00:00:59,700
no,
stop that one.

22
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:01,230
Just that one.
Oh No.

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,390
Both.
Both.

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,500
So if you have apple TV and the computer
open at the same time.

25
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,760
So if you're watching on TV and you have
a computer or if you have a quicktime

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,220
file on the desktop or starts playing.
Oh Wow.

27
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,720
How annoying.
Blockers for the sense of.

28
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:21,310
Sometimes even when it's closed,
it's still starts it up and eating.

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,990
My fucking phone started making my
computer ring the other day.

30
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,260
Company.
Yeah,

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,380
we were in here.
My computer is ringing.

32
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,540
I was like,
what kind of dog?

33
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,600
Shit.
Chilling out.

34
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,360
Watching a sure that I watch,
I guess.

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,930
Yeah.
Obviously I'm sure it's totally not

36
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,190
connected.
They already look at everything we do.

37
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,290
Come on,
come on.

38
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,590
We don't even notice it.
I know.

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,290
It's pretty nice making your computer
ring.

40
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,980
Do my phone and my computer ring.
They're connected in some way.

41
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,150
Something new.
Update new.

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,130
Made Mike fucking my phone.
Made my computer rang.

43
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:02,400
Like what?
What are we doing here?

44
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,880
Change your life.
We are just given into the Borg.

45
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,440
Why don't we just admit it?
Yeah.

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,690
Why don't we admit it?
Who's going to be the first one to get

47
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:12,070
their legs cut off for some new bionic
book?

48
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,100
Each of our buildings?
Yeah,

49
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,680
Bro.
You to get to keep your cock and balls

50
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,310
chopped off and have a fake legs,
broke his legs,

51
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:21,390
never get tired,
man.

52
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,180
Are you tired of walking all the time?
You get your cock and balls,

53
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,700
balls.
Most important part.

54
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:30,120
You want to keep these stupid meet
vehicles or do you want to get the cyber

55
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:34,380
2000 cyber 2002 legged system?
It's amazing,

56
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,280
man.
It doesn't even feel it'd be.

57
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,150
You totally feel like your own legs,
but they never get tired.

58
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:40,130
Dude,
you wouldn't even,

59
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,950
you would only need head and cock,
you know,

60
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,790
you could replace everything else.

61
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,560
I wonder.
Here's the question.

62
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,600
If you could live with everything else
being yes fingertips.

63
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,740
Um,
maybe one hand.

64
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:57,580
I'd like to hand
and cock phase.

65
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,200
Here's the thing.
If,

66
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,610
if,
if people are smart enough to start

67
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:07,090
manipulating bodies like that,
do you think they're going to keep the

68
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:09,920
same shape that we have now?
Oh yes.

69
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,730
Go round like the rod to from the New
Star Wars.

70
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,880
I don't think that's beneficial.
I was thinking that looks right.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Would there be a better designed than
this bipedal hominid form that we use?

72
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,270
Like would we get to a point where like
aesthetically,

73
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,580
like we started changing things on
people,

74
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,670
you know,
like have a chainsaw hands while I was

75
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:34,390
thinking like Minotaur bodies,
like clearly you know,

76
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,510
how much of you wants to be a person,
how many legs want run a lot faster on

77
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,090
four legs,
so the first guy to have four legs and

78
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:44,320
everybody's like Whoa.

79
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,510
And for no reason it doesn't make any
sense,

80
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:49,360
but girls are like,
that's hard to get lucky.

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Some fucking freak DNA thing that pops
in a female's head when they see a man

82
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:57,880
with four legs and they just can't help
themselves.

83
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,260
Oh my God,
I just did this to get faster,

84
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:03,570
but this is nice.
Yes.

85
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,420
To asses,
you know,

86
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,390
if I got a minute or I would hire all
the viral companies and the,

87
00:04:11,391 --> 00:04:14,770
and the PR firms and like get it out
there where it's an attractive thing.

88
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,290
Make It.
Part of this is that everyone says,

89
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:17,801
oh yeah,
yeah,

90
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:18,700
that's hot.
More legs.

91
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,530
So hotter,
higher,

92
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,880
higher like Leonardo Dicaprio to say it.
That could totally be done.

93
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,390
Yeah.
You've seen some of the crazy things

94
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:30,430
that people are doing with their bodies
these days.

95
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,650
Definitely want something different.
One,

96
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,530
we'll one.
We'll tude.

97
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,510
There's so many like weird body
modifications today.

98
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,590
I was jealous when those shoes with the
wheels came out of the bottom of the

99
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:43,750
shoes.
We'll never made it for adult sizes.

100
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:47,380
So I was pissed about that.
To make feet with wheels on it.

101
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,450
You should start a company licensed the
product.

102
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

103
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,070
That's a good idea actually.
They'd be so much.

104
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,250
Why is it no fun to do it as an adult?
I don't understand the problem.

105
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,080
Straight away.
You can't fucking.

106
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,980
You're not supposed to be enjoying so
far.

107
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,340
You're,
you're a grownup.

108
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,410
Supposed to stop the one with chores
wheeled around the mall.

109
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:16,411
I can asshole
wieland thing,

110
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:17,770
man.
I would love it.

111
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,520
But you got to stay on your back.
Feet seems like an awkward way to stand.

112
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,280
It's probably bad for old people like
pop in back wise.

113
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,820
You look back a lot of strain on the
back like that.

114
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,000
She,
Tyson wiping out on that.

115
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:31,834
Uh,
that

116
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,460
dude those things.
The first time I got on one,

117
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,190
I can do one now,
but the first time I got on one it was

118
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:40,920
at the comedy store.
And um,

119
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,510
this dude who's a comic,
what is his name?

120
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,670
Jamie know that dude's name.
You know what I'm talking about,

121
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:47,020
right,
sir?

122
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:49,440
Ben Kingsley,
I don't know.

123
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,770
Might have been.
I forgot his name.

124
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,330
Nice guy.
Anyway,

125
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,400
he,
uh,

126
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,350
he has a white one who's tooling around
the parking lot with tate and I go,

127
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,010
how,
how

128
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,970
hard is it to do?
And he goes,

129
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:00,080
try it.
I got it.

130
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:02,120
I couldn't imagine doing it.
I got on and I was like,

131
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,510
there's no way I'll ever get good at
this is fucking insane.

132
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:05,931
Like,
what is it?

133
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:08,900
Just two wheels and basically it's
essentially,

134
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,380
it's some form of a gyroscope and it's
like those scooter things that they have

135
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:15,890
the mall.
What are those things called again?

136
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,150
Segues,
segways,

137
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,520
segway things.
Have you ever ridden one of those?

138
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,720
No.
Really Fun.

139
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,080
Kevin James had one on the set of that.
Zookeeper moving.

140
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,300
Yeah.
He actually had a couple of them and he

141
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:29,570
would zoom around the parking them.
Do Dare fucking fun.

142
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,600
They're really cool,
but when they run out of batteries,

143
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,950
you go flying.
Then another stop brighter.

144
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,620
Do the battery just breaks.
If the battery runs out of juice,

145
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,060
you go down hard on it because it's the
only reason why it's keeping you up,

146
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:47,680
but you're not doing that yourself.
Like it's a gyroscope like gets it's

147
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,500
counter balancing you as you really
can't be a stable.

148
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,790
Oh,
you could definitely fall.

149
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,420
You definitely can fall,
but it's really easy to ride like you

150
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:59,480
don't.
I hope I'm saying gyroscope properly or

151
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,110
explaining the physics behind.
No idea what a gyroscope is to be

152
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:04,610
honest.
Scooters it called.

153
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,520
Yeah.
What would you say that it's run like a

154
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:08,780
gyroscope?
Is that.

155
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,050
Am I making things?
It's a gyroscope of the thing that you

156
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:16,310
get to the air and space museum.
The thing that's keeping balance like

157
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,173
house.

158
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,950
Can you pull up the definition of
gyroscope?

159
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:25,460
Just so I don't feel like an idiot.
I just want to know if that's what it is

160
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,370
because I've always been saying that.
But,

161
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:27,960
um,
now that I'm,

162
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,420
I'm,
I'm thinking while I'm saying,

163
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:32,870
am I right that that's a gyroscope,
I have no idea what a gyroscope covers,

164
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,570
whatever it is,
whatever this technology they've

165
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:39,200
invented for segue there,
you pull the string and it stays.

166
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,370
It stays spending forever.
Yeah.

167
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,320
The orientation of the access is
unaffected by tilting the rotation of

168
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:46,910
the mounting.
Okay.

169
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:50,860
So that does make sense.
But also in like drones to keep them up,

170
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:51,694
right?
Oh.

171
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,573
Oh.
Really?

172
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,100
GPS to help them keep up.
Right to the good Lord.

173
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,410
Was the drone almost switch gear?
Yeah,

174
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,540
we watched it.
What the fuck,

175
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,740
man?
You remember the guy who died in the

176
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:03,740
segway guy died.

177
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,650
We went off a cliff at one of the guys
that own the company or the inventor of

178
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:10,480
it
died on a segway going off a cliff when

179
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,710
he went to patent that thing my friend
worked at the patent office.

180
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:14,540
When he came in,
he didn't,

181
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,770
he didn't submit any,
like a blueprint.

182
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,360
You just brought one in and had
everybody write it.

183
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,290
First of all,
why is he near cliff?

184
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:25,330
Why is he like got on the road?
Oh,

185
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,560
he went off the cliff then.
Off-Road segue.

186
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,090
Oh,
what a terrible idea.

187
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,830
Until they have it.
I don't know.

188
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:32,630
But if they do,
that's a terrible idea.

189
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,560
Road segway because unless those things
are like way improved,

190
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,520
I would think that the batteries,
like if you couldn't rocks and shit,

191
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:44,240
giant tires.
The idea of like running over a rock and

192
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:48,530
hitting your electrical system.
Me As someone with zero knowledge of

193
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:51,710
even how electricity works.
I'm just going to comment on this

194
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,580
already.
You know,

195
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,490
like I don't know what the fuck
electricity

196
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,740
is.
I know you can't stick a fork in the

197
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,410
hole or you die.
That's what I

198
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,310
have such a fucking idiot.
People like.

199
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,250
Hold on because your feet though.
Connect like shut up.

200
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,770
You don't know.
He was this dude.

201
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,690
What are you showing me?
The TV shredder.

202
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:18,590
It looks like a four.
We'll segue segue.

203
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,350
It's just real.
Look at where to hold gas masks.

204
00:09:23,351 --> 00:09:26,250
Looks like Halo.
This is like a fucking.

205
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,770
Oh my God.
He's wearing a business suit.

206
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,380
This is insane.
It's got tires like a tank.

207
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,820
That is so crazy.
That desert video.

208
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:42,250
You gotta show me a video though.
I think it goes sidesaddle sports.

209
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,370
Yeah,
I guess right.

210
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,860
That guy in that position.
Yeah,

211
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,930
that seems weird.
That seems like a weird way to stay.

212
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Maybe it's just that one picture.
Look at this fucking little mini tank.

213
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:00,870
That is bad ass.

214
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,790
Wow.
Like fucking why not,

215
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,451
right?
Oh,

216
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:11,451
he's going up the wall.
No way there was going to jump.

217
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,410
Just a seesaw.
A seesaw wise is one of the dumbest

218
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,080
tricks,
but why this is to show that he can go

219
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:26,730
over obstacles.
Oh whoa.

220
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:27,564
No Way.
They're going,

221
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,760
oh my God.
Like nothing.

222
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,050
Hell yes.
Oh,

223
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:34,170
this thing is actually really bad
podcasts over.

224
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:39,171
Let's go.
Easy.

225
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,560
Dude.
This is crazy.

226
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,920
What is it called?
This a DTV shredder.

227
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,410
Oh,
that one.

228
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,370
The thing.
It's not even that heavy.

229
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,890
Like when he falls down and she wouldn't
just fell down,

230
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,170
look like he just picks it up and moves
it.

231
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,090
Like it's not that big of a flip back
on.

232
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:57,650
Yeah.
Look,

233
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,370
we're not talking a motorcycle.
That's why the fuck do you want a

234
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:03,180
fucking commercial for this?
Seems like we're doing a commercial for

235
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:04,710
those.
I've never even heard of this until

236
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:05,220
seconds ago.

237
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,870
I swear.
This is bullshit.

238
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,170
I see what you're doing,
dude.

239
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,690
Fucking product place.
DTV slash job broken right now.

240
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,920
You get 10 percent off
free shipping.

241
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,950
What the fuck is that man?
That's a shredder plates.

242
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,400
Some 14 year old boy got like 10 million
bucks

243
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,810
and said I'm starting my own company.
But you have a rapper who had about

244
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:33,060
rappers trick.
Couldn't everything in their home.

245
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,671
Yeah,
yeah,

246
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:34,970
yeah.
That's the white version of it.

247
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,833
There it is.
The

248
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,030
atvs or like a white man's?
Yeah,

249
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,490
like an ATV.
If you're like,

250
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,590
if you're white trash and you got like
really powerful Atvs,

251
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,840
like you are running shit.
You got a good piece of land.

252
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,360
We could just drive through mud.
Fuck yeah.

253
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,820
Let's go to bobby's right.
Those atvs.

254
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,430
Medan.
That's fun and shit.

255
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,920
I don't want those atvs.
Oh my God.

256
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:01,180
They're so fun.
Really.

257
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,940
Three wheel things will there four
wheels,

258
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,630
but that.

259
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,370
Those like motorcycle motorcycle things.
Yeah.

260
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,220
Do Funny Shit.
Yeah.

261
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,810
I've,
I've been in a bunch of different kinds

262
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:13,020
of little buggies to jumping and stuff.
He.

263
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,010
Oh No,
no,

264
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,411
no,
no,

265
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:16,180
just you driving through the woods and
um,

266
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:17,870
they're really fun.
Oh

267
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,200
yeah,
yeah.

268
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,240
It's really bouncing,
but they can get out of anything and

269
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,820
they'd go into the woods and drive over
logs with them and shit.

270
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,830
Hell yeah.
You take those things up in Canada and

271
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,920
my friends in Canada,
the rivets that run this hunting camp

272
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:33,400
and Canada,
they have an argo and argo is like a

273
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:35,010
mini tank.
It's the,

274
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:35,800
it's,
it's,

275
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,990
it goes amphibian,
it goes through the water.

276
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,510
Lily,
two things.

277
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,370
My friend John Rivett from up in Canada,
so he needs it.

278
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:47,220
He goes moose hunting.
So they,

279
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,910
they'll,
they'll kill a moose and they have to

280
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:52,540
drag it out of the woods and they have
it on this fucking mini tank.

281
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,450
Whoa dude.
What?

282
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,530
You've have to see this.
Then they have different wheels form,

283
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,030
like sometimes they have like wheels,
like giant truck tires,

284
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,460
but other times they put tank treads on
them and they looked.

285
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,270
They can go deep into the woods.
They just drive through shit.

286
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,170
Like you could buy a tank,
but sounds fun.

287
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,840
See you pull up a video of an argo so I
could show him what.

288
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,850
What he's talking about.
These dudes,

289
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:18,400
the rivets,
they have all sorts of Atvs,

290
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:20,950
but this argo is the mother.
This is the mother.

291
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,340
Like if you're stuck,
this motherfucker will get you out.

292
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,580
It's the mother.
It just goes deep into the woods.

293
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,420
It's a tank.
Fucking small tank gets over everything.

294
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:32,740
Everything.
Blogs.

295
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:33,371
Look at it,
look at it.

296
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:34,390
Look at it.
Okay.

297
00:13:34,391 --> 00:13:37,000
This is one of 'em.
This is.

298
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,540
They have
to go into the water.

299
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,720
See the tank treads?
Yeah.

300
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,410
Some of them just tilt it.
You can drive through water with these

301
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,180
fucking things.
Wow.

302
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,190
Bill.
They had,

303
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,590
I don't know.
It's some hillbilly shit.

304
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,430
Whoever's making them.
You know they're appealing to

305
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,510
back that up.
Backed it up.

306
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,030
She could see that.
Where the one has tree.

307
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,650
Look at that right there.
We can see the

308
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,360
trees.
No,

309
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,210
he's gonna tank tread.
There's tank tread on these things.

310
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,350
I mean it's a fucking tank tank for the
forest.

311
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,680
Wow.
I see girls right now would be so angry

312
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:20,020
if they were here.
Who Cares?

313
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:23,830
Why
don't live in the forest,

314
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,190
ladies?
I'm so sorry that we don't see things

315
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:31,090
the same way.
This is like for a girl going through

316
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:35,080
creeks and shit would be cool like that.
Will it be the female equivalent for

317
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:37,030
something like this?
Like awesome handbags,

318
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,850
girls who have bought some shoes,
shoes thing,

319
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:41,140
right?
Be a shoe thing,

320
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,370
man with money.

321
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,570
Older man with money in a heart
condition.

322
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,340
Oh my God.
You have got to see this.

323
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,080
What he barely breathe.
She bad.

324
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,550
His wallet is terrifying.
That,

325
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,340
that,
that,

326
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,000
that some old dudes like that really are
preyed upon like that.

327
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,600
Yeah.
Nobody protects them.

328
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,270
No,
there's no like guys come on and they

329
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:10,271
can't make their own decisions.
I know a dude who got taken really older

330
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:12,740
dude,
but so few of a girl.

331
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,930
No,
he had a younger or younger girlfriend

332
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:18,980
that he met on one of those weird dating
sites and uh,

333
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,720
two years and she was involved in his
business.

334
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,680
Hundreds of thousands of dollars went
missing.

335
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:30,710
It's just got to this weird state.
He had a jess and jettison the

336
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:32,300
experience.
You know,

337
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,620
I am in its old dudes.
It's old people in general,

338
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:38,250
you know,
he started getting older,

339
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,520
he truly don't want to be alone and if
you're really old and you're wealthy and

340
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:46,160
you just find some girl who seemed so
nice,

341
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,440
but every time she makes your teeth
start,

342
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:54,250
just start feeling weird diarrhea and I
don't know what's going on.

343
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,960
Is something wrong with.
Maybe you're anxious because of the new

344
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:58,310
girl.
Maybe it's just,

345
00:15:58,311 --> 00:15:59,270
maybe I just,
you know,

346
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,300
I haven't been having sex since my wife
died and I'm 85 years old now and I

347
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:07,280
can't believe this girl even wants to be
with me.

348
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,300
I mean it's just what a treasure and
what a blessing from the Lord.

349
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:12,920
But God,
every time she makes me,

350
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,590
he doesn't want to admit it.
You okay baby.

351
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:21,530
We're still gonna do it.
Do you not think I'm hot anymore?

352
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,150
He's in baby.
I love you.

353
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:27,620
I just know I'm 85 years old.
One second.

354
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:32,621
I just got asked blood slowly.
She's eaten through his insides.

355
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,300
I,
those,

356
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,680
those fucking shows like those um,
uh,

357
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:42,280
murder shows where they talk about like,
no,

358
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:42,561
no,
no.

359
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:43,390
Like,
um,

360
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,390
when you talk about like a different
people that it did like a,

361
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,400
like there was one that was a nurse that
was purposely poisoning all of the

362
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:56,840
people that she was taken care of too,
that they were just crazy.

363
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,300
She crazy.
She was crazy too.

364
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:03,560
Is purposely poisoning patients to go to
work.

365
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,380
Yeah.
I don't think she was doing it to get

366
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:08,150
out of work.
I think she was just killing people.

367
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,360
I think she was just crazy.
It just was a few years back.

368
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,880
But the idea that someone would,
uh,

369
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,780
would want to consciously,
slowly kill someone with a poison like,

370
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:22,730
Woo,
Woo.

371
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,710
There want to just move on with your
life,

372
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,290
bitch.
Leave that poor guy in the bed alone.

373
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:27,720
No,
she,

374
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,200
she got off on it or something.
Something.

375
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,350
She was killing them while they were in
her care.

376
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,820
They were thinking about what it'd be
like.

377
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,910
Oh God.
It's dark.

378
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,340
It's,
it's amazing how few people kill people.

379
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,360
Really,
when you think about it.

380
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,510
I'm mad people get at each other and a
few people actually get killed.

381
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,533
Awesome.
Well,

382
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,230
awesome.
Fucking hanging in there,

383
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:54,210
man.
You know,

384
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,230
I mean think about how many times I walk
around and no fear of any physical

385
00:17:58,231 --> 00:17:59,420
violence.
Yeah.

386
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,250
Almost never.
You have to be in the total wrong place

387
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:07,251
at the total wrong time or drinking
if you're drinking anything and

388
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,340
especially if you're one of those guys,
but I just free to walk around with

389
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,950
plenty of money in my pocket.
Yeah.

390
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:17,520
That's for anyone to just being like
everyone has a wallet.

391
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,600
Like you keep your cash cashman.
How long before?

392
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,050
That's not real anymore.
How long before paper money is gone?

393
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,950
That's kind of becoming right.
I'm ready for the trip.

394
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,620
Wow.
You're ready to give in to the board,

395
00:18:30,621 --> 00:18:31,290
which is chip.

396
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,660
Someone's ready to give it to the board
and get some more legs.

397
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,920
You've ever seen those videos of the
order for the phone to work,

398
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,190
you have to get a horse leg it chip in.
That's what they're gonna do it

399
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:41,710
eventually.
Like,

400
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,470
okay.
Anyone who hasn't still have the chip in

401
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:44,670
and the horse legs,
we're going to.

402
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,350
We're going to give you free ones now
because everyone has to be on TV.

403
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,570
It would be like certain things you
couldn't get,

404
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,920
you couldn't get on the internet
anymore,

405
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,450
so they will deprive you of your
services.

406
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,570
Got To join that board saying my phone
will no longer work overseas,

407
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,800
but if you want an overseas phone,
they think they can get me one.

408
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,930
It's hilarious.
If you don't know,

409
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:08,070
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ari should.

410
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:10,830
Fear has done one of the bravest things
that any man has ever done.

411
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,280
He went from an iphone to a flip phone.
The chunkiest little 1979 technology

412
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:22,890
flip phone at the time.
It was super advanced.

413
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:25,030
Like what?
Your sporting in your pocket at one

414
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,040
point in time.
Yeah,

415
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,020
absolutely.
It's undeniably.

416
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,060
Yeah.
I just like super advanced.

417
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:32,610
I had to find this one.
The first was just the free,

418
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:34,290
like best buy.
Go get it over there.

419
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,700
Yeah.
You started off with a regular one when

420
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:40,680
you had to do like four presses to get
an s.

421
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,720
How is it possible?
That was really,

422
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:45,060
really tough.
It's stupid.

423
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,290
This double flip is the future man.
Yeah.

424
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,230
Well you know what?
The real future is word recognition.

425
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,750
Oh yeah.
Whole typing thing.

426
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,000
It's so stupid.
It's gone.

427
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,010
It's on its way out.
It's so close.

428
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,980
It's so close.
They're so good now.

429
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,840
Like as far as showed me,
it was dead on.

430
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,170
I use it for notes all the time.
I'll say something into notes and I

431
00:20:09,171 --> 00:20:10,890
just,
it comes out almost perfect.

432
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,120
Like weird things get spelled wrong if
it's a weird name or something like

433
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:16,680
that,
but that's to be expected.

434
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,480
It spells it phonetically.
Got Ra got red.

435
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,470
You know,
what else did Washington Post?

436
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,650
Is that what it was to wash it?
But it's already should fear was a

437
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,470
goddamn answer to a crossword puzzle,
ladies and gentlemen.

438
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:33,220
So suck it haters.
My mom and sister said it's a me.

439
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,670
It's a layer.
So they were getting all sorts of phone

440
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:36,570
calls.
Yeah.

441
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,650
And I was like,
no way.

442
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:40,320
It's such a.
that's such a non comedy.

443
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,050
Yeah.
That's.

444
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,420
You've transcended son.
So unquestionably.

445
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,440
You've now transcended.
That's like a

446
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,020
comedian show seven across.
Weird.

447
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,940
Said you're famous.
You're on TV.

448
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:02,560
What do you expect that,
that you haven't been there enough for

449
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,620
someone to get it here.
Don't suck it.

450
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,630
Yeah.
You're doing the right thing though.

451
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:12,080
I liked,
I liked the fact I.

452
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:13,840
I would never do what you're doing with
your phone,

453
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,870
but I like what you're doing.
What you're doing is you're looking at

454
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:19,600
the data and deciding,
okay,

455
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:21,670
how much willpower do I have?
Not Enough.

456
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,960
Fuck this.
Yeah,

457
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:23,630
there you go.
That's how.

458
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,830
That's where to put it.
I analyze the stats on my life and I was

459
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:27,281
like,
oh,

460
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:29,920
I can't stop.
But you did it very intelligently.

461
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,850
Like it's very difficult to do.
It's very difficult for people to not

462
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:37,000
just look at some weird addiction that
they might have,

463
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,310
but to say,
okay,

464
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,450
even though there's all this amazing
convenience of being able to buy movie

465
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:47,470
tickets and being able to check websites
and answer emails on your phone,

466
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:49,060
it's not worth it.
That's the justification.

467
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,100
It's not worth it.
It's too much.

468
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,950
Well,
you know how when you see someone on TV

469
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:55,540
smoking cigarettes,
you never really smoked,

470
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,470
Huh?
No,

471
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:57,460
I never spoke.
Only smoke.

472
00:21:57,461 --> 00:21:59,300
When you see somebody just triggers
like,

473
00:21:59,301 --> 00:22:01,250
oh,
I need to smoke to you,

474
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,370
get in your car.
Some people smoke no matter what,

475
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:06,160
just or whatever.
I wanted the comedy store at smoke.

476
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,331
You know,
it's funny though,

477
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:09,760
when I see people get high,
it does the opposite.

478
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,640
It makes me not want to get high go.
My God.

479
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,930
Do I sound that stupid?

480
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,590
You know,
because sometimes you'll say things when

481
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:19,590
you're high and as you're saying,
let me like,

482
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,690
like you would if you were to go,
oh my God,

483
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:24,640
he's an idiot.
But believe me,

484
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,050
I'm saying,
Oh my God,

485
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:29,890
I'm an idiot.
Come say as I'm saying it,

486
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,530
I'm thinking I'm an idiot sometimes.
I'm like,

487
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,480
this is somebody should write this down
or lift the media because it's brilliant

488
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,190
here the next day.
And you're like,

489
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:38,920
what?
I did a scene on news radio once with

490
00:22:38,921 --> 00:22:41,740
Bob Costa,
who's a very nice guy.

491
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,510
Bob Cost is great.
He's very,

492
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:46,630
very intelligent guy too.
And we had the scene and um,

493
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,690
I uh,
he beats me up pillar custard,

494
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,420
flip me.
He does this like judo flip and go into

495
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:54,690
my ass for some strange reason.
Um,

496
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,880
but afterwards we were all out talking
and while we were talking I had smoked

497
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
pot and I was rambling to him
as I was.

498
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:13,170
I remember talking to him about dupont
making the chemical compound for nylon,

499
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:18,050
like at the same time when they made
hamp illegally,

500
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:21,710
some stupid ass minimum that I'm like,
shut bombs,

501
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,170
mom,
words coming out of my mouth,

502
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:25,250
I'm going to shut.
My brain is telling you,

503
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,610
your brain is telling you.
Stop it.

504
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,200
Shut up.
Just A.

505
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,750
Oh,
I don't know.

506
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,390
I mean he was,
he's a gentlemen and I'm sure he didn't

507
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:36,910
even call me on it.
I just realized that while I was doing

508
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:37,810
it.
Then you have to be like,

509
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,800
this is a super nice guy.
He's a really a really interesting guy.

510
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,790
Very,
very smart.

511
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,780
You know,
certain dudes like you talked to,

512
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,830
you go,
oh,

513
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:46,664
okay.

514
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,360
Fucking sharp.
Yeah.

515
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,510
There's a few guys like that.
He's a very sharp guy and he's a,

516
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,540
he's in an interesting position to as a
a sports commentator who also gives like

517
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:05,360
really well thought out opinions,
agree with them or disagree with them

518
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,300
about gun violence.
About a lot of other things,

519
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:10,890
but like important social issues.
Yeah.

520
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,110
Bob Costas.
Oh,

521
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,170
you know what I'm talking about place?
I think it's hip hop Costa.

522
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:17,310
I thought it was just another person
guy.

523
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,400
Yeah.
Bob Costas.

524
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,230
Yeah.
You gotta see the diaper guy?

525
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,810
The diaper guy.
Who's diaper water?

526
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,790
Bob Constants is the guy that doesn't
like football.

527
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:28,070
Right,
and Marv Albert.

528
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,630
I have no idea.
Does that.

529
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,110
He used to do that late night.
Show it later with bulk costs.

530
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:37,550
That's something like that was.
It was late night for a little while.

531
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,800
Super fucking smart guy,
man.

532
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,570
How dumb is that billboard for the late
night show where they're putting makeup.

533
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:48,170
That daily show girl be a girl.
Oh,

534
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:50,990
the one we were looking at.
Well,

535
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,100
you know,
they're just trying to get your

536
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:53,960
attention.
If it says like,

537
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:56,120
if you don't like it,
you're sexist or if you don't watch it,

538
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:58,250
you're sexist.
Even the name of it full front,

539
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,240
it's just like,
come on,

540
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:01,250
let him let him fucking just be good
hosts.

541
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,720
All of them.
All the minorities,

542
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:05,870
they just keep pushing them into like
being that thing of girls or minority.

543
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Yeah,
girl TV.

544
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,700
That's an interesting way of putting it.
I've never heard a girl be described as

545
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:12,260
a minority even though they're 52
percent.

546
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,540
Yeah.
That the underrepresented on television,

547
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,720
what's it?
I would see a ratio on TV.

548
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,770
Yeah.
I have no idea.

549
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,660
When you say underrepresented,
like less than half the people on TV are

550
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:24,520
girls.
Yeah.

551
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,850
Really?
Standup is a lot more to do.

552
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:31,340
It's really.
Show me more about what you think about

553
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:34,310
movies or TV shows.
It was very few walking dead.

554
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,230
Women have an even number.

555
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,250
They have an even number of boys and
girls,

556
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,710
you know,
and somehow those people aren't hooking

557
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:44,330
up like what do we.
Not Forever.

558
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,800
I remember that couple barely and they
just fall deeply in love while they

559
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:51,050
fight off the zombies.
Get the fuck Outta here.

560
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,750
They never even filed.
Land was watching him in that one

561
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:55,010
episode.
He was just staring at them.

562
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,040
Fuck.
Oh,

563
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:57,230
that's right.
The comedian,

564
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,110
Josh.
Josh,

565
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,580
Josh,
Josh,

566
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,460
Josh is looking at and let them look.
Do you remember how we worked with Josh

567
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,580
would do that Gig?
Was it Duncan?

568
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,030
Might've been Duncan on me and uh,
we're in Arizona.

569
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,770
Yeah,
we were in Arizona and this was,

570
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:20,830
I think this was a d has no show
started it,

571
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:23,900
but I don't know the way,
the reason I went out on the road with

572
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:28,340
Joe Rogan is because he needed a second
person to open for him because Diaz was

573
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,530
at best 70 slash 30 to show up.

574
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,270
It was more than that.
He was more than that.

575
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:35,540
In all fairness,
there was only a few instances where it

576
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,910
didn't work out,
but I get stuck with nobody.

577
00:26:37,911 --> 00:26:40,580
So you'll find the hub to case he showed
up.

578
00:26:40,581 --> 00:26:45,540
I'll have to no big deal.
I'd Joey and I always felt like I have

579
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:48,140
an obligation to let joey be Joey.
What great.

580
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,071
When it's like,
Oh,

581
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:52,320
you might not show up today.
I'll just hire more people.

582
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:55,230
This is your job also.
We don't have this problem.

583
00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:00,290
I knew like even way back in the day
that show he was special special guy and

584
00:27:00,901 --> 00:27:02,670
he's special.
He's important for everybody.

585
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,360
Yeah.
You know,

586
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,350
he's like an engine and he's beautiful.
He's,

587
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,870
if you get close to him,
he's beautiful.

588
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,240
He's the best.
He's the best.

589
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:15,030
That kind of shines like inside like
this.

590
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,700
Why we all love to be around them
because you can,

591
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:18,360
you know,
if you're.

592
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,570
Even if you're busy or something like
this will be a 92nd phone call.

593
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,450
He's getting phone calls every day.
Yeah.

594
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,600
I mean he's a classic original,
but he,

595
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:28,860
you know,
he had problems back then.

596
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,660
But you saw something,
right?

597
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,550
I knew it.
I just knew it.

598
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:33,870
I just knew it.
Oh Man,

599
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,850
this guy just needs.
He just needs to be.

600
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,560
Just leave him alone.
He'll figure it out.

601
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,810
He's closing my storyteller show again,
stir.

602
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,420
We're going to end the season with them
every year.

603
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,120
He's a monster.
He could do that forever,

604
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:45,954
by the way.
Yes.

605
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,360
He never runs out of storage.
It's insane.

606
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:53,361
I've never met anybody who I've known
him for what fucking almost 20 years and

607
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:57,360
he just always has new stories and there
and people will go,

608
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,640
this didn't have like,
yeah,

609
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,450
no.
He gets verification,

610
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,570
Verification.
Fucking call people up,

611
00:28:03,571 --> 00:28:04,730
put him on speakerphone.

612
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,230
Tell him that fucking time.
Verification.

613
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,150
Joey Babaloo.
No,

614
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:12,020
in fucking north Bergen has these,
these conversations with people.

615
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,390
Verifications,
Verification,

616
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,080
Verification,
triple ecology for verification.

617
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:17,330
That's right.
Was it.

618
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,710
I don't remember what it was,
but was the verification from onstage?

619
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:22,380
She calls you and you were at the
Improv?

620
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,460
Yeah.
What did I.

621
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,040
What was it?
This girl said,

622
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,510
oh,
we're not friends,

623
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:29,700
and I said,
I have my phone or something like that.

624
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,410
That's exactly right.
The fact that I'm getting on the phone

625
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:34,500
proves it.
Oh yeah.

626
00:28:34,501 --> 00:28:36,360
It was a heckler.
Who's being mean to him?

627
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,840
Nobody's better with the hecklers and
triple,

628
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,980
triple.
He's franchise.

629
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,950
He's been in the trenches.
Yeah.

630
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,550
Diaz
Tripoli's a comedy store at dude.

631
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:51,630
Those comedy store guys,
especially us from like the nineties,

632
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,120
there was no.
Nobody was.

633
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,020
There was no crowd control.
Completely get off like there's no one

634
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,400
fighting for 10 minutes.

635
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,870
No one's even telling him to shut up.
How come fucking Holtzman got knocked

636
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:04,860
out?
Oh,

637
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,743
I remember.
He got.

638
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,670
He got punched in the face by someone's
bodyguard.

639
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,680
Ultimately one time tackled somebody
walking by the front row and the

640
00:29:18,061 --> 00:29:22,980
original room and they walked in between
the front row of chairs and the table

641
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:23,640
chairs.
You know,

642
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,570
this was one of the words like it's a
stage one,

643
00:29:26,571 --> 00:29:29,430
like with the tables,
so they're walking through there and he

644
00:29:29,431 --> 00:29:32,340
saw them.
He just leaned over and grabbed onto

645
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:35,440
their shoulders and just left his body
weight drop.

646
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,250
I just brought him to the ground.
We're just going back to their seat.

647
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,990
Let me ask you this.
As a responsible person and an adult,

648
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,850
if you're running that business,
do you fire a gun check theirs?

649
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,550
Is that how you look at it?
Can Be like you can't.

650
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,120
That's why yelp reviews of comedy clubs
and some of the greatest things in the

651
00:29:58,121 --> 00:30:00,490
world because they point out stuff that
you'd be like.

652
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,590
They're doing it as a yelp review of a
business,

653
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,710
but they're like.
Literally one of the employees said,

654
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:09,180
I hope I die in a fire when I'm going
home.

655
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,590
It's like,
imagine if a waiter set out to you and

656
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,421
then they're like,
oh,

657
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:17,020
you're talking about David Taylor came
from running you out of there and now

658
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:19,600
he's trying to hurt you,
so you think about it on the way home.

659
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:26,020
I don't want your business that you're
running out of there too.

660
00:30:26,021 --> 00:30:27,700
You were probably a dick enough to be
like,

661
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,380
we don't want you back.
That's the most important.

662
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:32,650
What will you.
You can run into Dick's man,

663
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,380
and a lot of times it's just people that
don't know how to behave.

664
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,820
Like Chapelle was at the store the other
night and some guy kept yelling shit out

665
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:40,541
at.
I'm in the crowd.

666
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,430
Started yelling at the guy to shut the
fuck up.

667
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:43,710
That's both.
Oh,

668
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,710
was he was just so obnoxious,
but he just couldn't believe he was

669
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:49,570
talking to Dave Chappelle,
you know,

670
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,310
he's just drunk and he fucked up and the
people around him were responding and it

671
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:58,840
started getting Shitty,
but the star never had anybody to like,

672
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,720
you can't do that at the Improv.
They will grab you and they'll pull you

673
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:02,380
out of there.

674
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,460
Like they,
they like was this comedian,

675
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,280
so we're outside fucking smoking pot.
No one's parent attrition.

676
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,450
We're worried about talking to this
chick.

677
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,810
No one's paying attention.
You have to get a door guy.

678
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:14,950
Yeah,
but you know what?

679
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,960
I would say that it's way less necessary
today than it's ever been before.

680
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,470
The crowds have been amazing at the
store lately.

681
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,520
They also sort of,
okay,

682
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:26,320
here's the thing.
This is why Canadian crutches better

683
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:28,260
too,
because it's if you go into it and like

684
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,300
your listeners good with an
understanding of like,

685
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,440
here's the etiquette of what it's like
to be in a comedy show.

686
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,590
Like I sort of get it already.
Then they're just like a base level

687
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:37,870
better crowds.
Like I know you're supposed to shut up

688
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:41,440
and laugh and that's it.
Some people didn't get that message

689
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,380
going on though,
man.

690
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,060
That's part of what it is.

691
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,430
Some people,
they don't just don't know that yet.

692
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,710
Like what?
Like what is.

693
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,910
No one else is doing this.
Yeah.

694
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:58,960
I think
it's hard for some people that grew up

695
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:00,750
around morons.
You know,

696
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:05,560
if you grow up like exclusively around
morons and you've been responding to

697
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:08,530
morons or whole life,
then all of a sudden you're drinking

698
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,290
dave Chappelle's onstage.
You can act like a moron.

699
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,030
You,
you don't even know why you're doing it.

700
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,950
Like as it's coming out of your mouth,
you're like,

701
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:19,360
who is this asshole representing the
great spirit that is inside?

702
00:32:19,361 --> 00:32:22,050
And I used to have more problems like
right after Chappelle show with a.

703
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,560
They would yell at those catchphrases at
him.

704
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:28,610
Oh,
he had a real problem once it was at the

705
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,740
House of Blues I think,
or something like that.

706
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:30,980
One of those places.
And yes,

707
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,350
young tour.
Yeah.

708
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:35,500
I remember people kept yelling out,
you know,

709
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,020
all the different phrases,
you know,

710
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,250
and she's like,
what?

711
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,200
Can't go anywhere at this.
Yeah.

712
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,330
What was the Big One?
What was that Big One?

713
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,490
I'm Rick James Bitch.
I'm Rick James Bitch.

714
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,870
That was one.
They kept yelling at him.

715
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,490
He had,
when he came back from Africa or

716
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:51,380
whatever,
he had a show at the store,

717
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,000
the comedy store,
and it was mobbed that everybody's are.

718
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,600
Soundgarden came and Bruce Willis came.
Yeah,

719
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,020
I was mobbed and that way oversold and
uh,

720
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,300
the fire department showed up and it was
like trouble,

721
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:03,530
but they just wanted to sit on the
steps,

722
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,960
watch while he was the biggest thing
that was that.

723
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:07,640
But there was Shrek.
They told everybody,

724
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:10,490
you say a word and you're gone.
And there was a line out the door,

725
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:11,970
people not being able to get in.
Well,

726
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,750
and when magical was on,
I think he had two guys open for a

727
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:15,970
magical.
It's a black guy,

728
00:33:15,971 --> 00:33:16,580
I forget who.

729
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,970
And then he went on,
um,

730
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,840
somebody heckled a little bit from the
front row and they just yanked him right

731
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:22,130
out.
Then somebody came right at,

732
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,070
got a front row seat because was just
fucked up.

733
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:26,931
Yeah,
man,

734
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:28,830
I think people are learning.
Yeah,

735
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,270
I get it.
If you don't like the person who's on

736
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,113
stage.
I've,

737
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,680
I've lived outside,
go get a cigarette and come back in and

738
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,480
said I,
I'll sit and watch the show.

739
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,200
And if someone is not doing well,
can you say something?

740
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,720
If your waiters being super rude to you
or somebody,

741
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:46,180
a plumber is being an asshole to you,
like,

742
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,450
hey man,
you're being a dick it out,

743
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,280
but not if it's ruining everyone else's
experience.

744
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,121
You know,
like a movie.

745
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:51,920
Go outside and complaint.
Well,

746
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,870
it's just,
it's not necessary.

747
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,700
If other people were enjoying it for you
to enjoy pleasure.

748
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,380
Yeah,
and that happened sometimes.

749
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,150
You mentioned leading star wars going,
this is a kid's movie I don't like.

750
00:34:04,151 --> 00:34:06,950
This is for kids.
Kids Go,

751
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,350
who are you rooting for me?
But again,

752
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:11,000
we know that because we're in the
business.

753
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:15,380
I think for a lot of people this is all
they don't understand and then there's

754
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:18,170
also people who will tell you later,
you should be able to hear and losing.

755
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,110
We were up on stage.
You should be able to handle anything

756
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:23,540
they throw at you.
It's like one of the ways I had to

757
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:27,260
handle this is to make you leave by an
off duty cop who's working with

758
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,280
some weird thing.
When people tell you what you're

759
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:34,790
supposed to be able to do,
like as a comedian,

760
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,820
you're supposed to be able to handle it,
that magic going to a restaurant,

761
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:40,070
throwing a plate onto the floor,
and so will,

762
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:42,080
you know,
because deal with spills all the time,

763
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:42,620
don't you?

764
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:47,160
You should be able to handle it.
Somebody literally said when,

765
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,360
when the subject of stealing jokes came
up,

766
00:34:50,361 --> 00:34:51,860
look,
you should be able to write more jokes.

767
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:55,970
I remember someone saying that like,
you should be able to write more jokes.

768
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,680
Oh,
it's fucking so simple.

769
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,110
Yeah.
So what are the other things?

770
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:03,330
Like you have a job before the boss
who's abusing you.

771
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,700
Well,
you should be able to get a better job.

772
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,051
Yeah.
What?

773
00:35:05,051 --> 00:35:08,210
I haven't been a job
but a job

774
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,470
rapes,
mess hall commentary,

775
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,110
you know,
days,

776
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,820
asshole,
commentary.

777
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,060
That's all it is.
I like to just walk away from those

778
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:21,230
people.
You can do it online,

779
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:25,220
but we're trying to educate you.
Get out of here.

780
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,580
That's so funny man.
It's so true.

781
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,100
God.
Right.

782
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,460
We should draw.
You told me early on when you started,

783
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:37,980
like really like what you would be
vicious with Pete with those

784
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,960
hecklers.
Don't you feel bad?

785
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,400
You were like,
they've already shown them they're

786
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:42,870
assholes.
So No,

787
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,860
no mercy,
no reason to show mercy.

788
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,750
What they're doing is trying to be mean,
like they're yelling shit out,

789
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:50,730
trying to interrupt,
and a lot of them,

790
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,240
the reason why they're doing it is
because they just want attention.

791
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,190
They know it's not even what you're
saying.

792
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,140
They just,
for whatever reason,

793
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,840
they wanted to do an open mic night.
They never did it.

794
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:04,680
They got drunk and here they are and
they feel like I'm going to fucking get

795
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:08,550
disarmed.
She fear this guy can't handle what I'm

796
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,570
coming with them.
Can you fly around the room with those

797
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:13,404
times?

798
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,660
Did I just do gay guys at the stand?
And they were mad at me because it was

799
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:21,210
one of those things with drugs will
mishear one word,

800
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,520
you know?
And they'll just be like that.

801
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,060
No,
no.

802
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:29,060
I was saying I don't like people who
hate black people and black people now

803
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,730
and like,
no,

804
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,890
shut up.
It's one of those and they were just

805
00:36:31,891 --> 00:36:34,500
being angry and give me the mainstay or
all the time and the standard is so

806
00:36:34,501 --> 00:36:36,300
small that you can see everybody.
It's pretty good.

807
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,670
And uh,
and then I was like,

808
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:39,860
but you guys don't like this.
I was like,

809
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,670
I said something like,
first smile I got out of you.

810
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,271
And they're like,
well,

811
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:44,040
whatever.
And I just started calling Mr and Mrs

812
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,380
poopy pants had just like,
belittling them.

813
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,450
It's just so fun.
And watching them get angrier and

814
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:50,340
angrier.
We just talk over people.

815
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,140
They're just angry.
Well,

816
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:54,930
what were they doing?
Just gonna be so mad.

817
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,760
Like just giving me means mean mugs.
You've seen that when it's like,

818
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,000
I'm just going to try to show you how
mad I am.

819
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,820
Oh yeah,
yeah.

820
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,180
Things like that.
Things like that.

821
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,500
I had a woman in Calgary,
she was bitching about everybody.

822
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,880
The whole open opener should come.
Yeah.

823
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,120
And it was like,
how you got to be quiet?

824
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,850
And then she did that thing with like,
next Joe and I'm like,

825
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:12,900
beat it.
You're out.

826
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,190
Get Out,
get the fuck out now.

827
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:17,070
What is that going to be above this
show?

828
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,030
I just railed on it for like 10 minutes
and I had to stop by the white crowd.

829
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:22,080
This is not coming out of your time,

830
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:25,700
so the clock stops.
Next joke.

831
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:26,930
Oh my God.
Yeah.

832
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:29,240
It's like you don't want to be here.
Get the fuck Outta here.

833
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,720
Just so weird because you can go to like
the most amazing movie,

834
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,550
but if you're sitting next to someone is
going

835
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,810
to happen.
Oh,

836
00:37:41,811 --> 00:37:44,150
you fucking live.
Who saw that?

837
00:37:44,151 --> 00:37:48,000
Common Stallone.
He found a way to get that.

838
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,740
That rock pick into the side of the
mountain.

839
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:55,750
Just as he's hanging off of it,
pulls himself up,

840
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,710
be quiet,
grabs a log,

841
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,110
and drags himself over the top of the
cliff.

842
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,500
That could happen.
Right?

843
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,670
She
Guy,

844
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,320
this guy in Scotland threatened to sue
me.

845
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,820
Oh,
that's wonderful.

846
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,770
Yeah,
because I told his wife who was.

847
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:17,720
She was ugly.
Did you hear what happened in Canada

848
00:38:17,721 --> 00:38:19,070
with that?
With Mike Ward?

849
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,090
Do you know the guy getting sued by
tribunals?

850
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,040
Yeah,
I like him a lot.

851
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,120
Was Great.

852
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,640
Which one are you talking about?
The one with the guy I'm cursed out the

853
00:38:25,641 --> 00:38:30,641
lesbians and set a bunch of uh,
gay things to them.

854
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,110
No,
don't called him dykes.

855
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,970
Something along those lines.
And there was like a nasty exchange

856
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:42,060
trans guy and this girl and I'm the
woman sued and apparently I believe one

857
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,000
and I don't know,
like the specific mental damages.

858
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,750
Well I think she sued for like Jamie see
if he could pull that up.

859
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,710
I don't want to talk.
I don't know exactly what the charges

860
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:59,740
were but it was everybody was like Whoa,
like,

861
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,530
and she won.
I think she ain't gonna Award like

862
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:05,020
$10,000 or something.
Well then it becomes a thing where it's

863
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:08,590
like you either have to make everyone
sign a release for coming to a comedy

864
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:11,600
club or just saying you're going to kill
the art form as Jimmy pulls it off.

865
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,650
You can't take any more risks.
I don't want to misquote anything.

866
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:16,720
So I want to make sure I say this
incorrectly,

867
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,510
but it was a story I just,
I don't know,

868
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:21,820
I'll tell you what happened was to Mike
Ward,

869
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,620
French Canadian comic,
and so he was doing this,

870
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,910
there was this kid who was like,
make a wish kid,

871
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:28,810
whatever.
And uh,

872
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:31,750
they were like,
he's going out and it was a big like on

873
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:35,170
TV is like a coke campaign.
And then,

874
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:37,150
uh,
Mike had a bit about the 10 years later

875
00:39:37,151 --> 00:39:39,550
this kid's still alive and he's like,
I want my money back.

876
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,770
You know,
it started going off because I was

877
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,010
fucking 23 now.
No.

878
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,090
And uh,
and I think so fucking.

879
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,630
And the kid said he got made fun of
because of it.

880
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,340
Oh my God,
it wasn't cool.

881
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,760
Jesus was like,
well,

882
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,900
sorry man,
you were like a celebrity and I'm going

883
00:39:58,901 --> 00:40:02,300
to make fun of that stuff.
And he got taken to a tribunal is going

884
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:04,090
right now to a French Canadian tribunal.

885
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:07,470
Oh No.
Oh my God.

886
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,740
What are they suing them for?
Charging them with or what are they

887
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,830
doing a signing up for?
I don't know the exact charges,

888
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,100
but it's either 80 grand or more.
They're sort of for,

889
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,980
but the problem is then that just makes
anything off limits.

890
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,460
It makes any sort of subject where you
have no idea.

891
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,211
Well,
here's the thing.

892
00:40:24,211 --> 00:40:29,211
How do you attach a monetary number two,
that slurs fo force comic to pay $15,000

893
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:34,830
more than I thought.
Tirade of ugly words against lesbian

894
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:37,550
patron after appeal falls flat.
Wow.

895
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,280
No appeal.
Appeal fell flat.

896
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,200
They didn't win the appeal.
Yeah,

897
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:46,000
so I think he lost human rights tribunal
there.

898
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,720
That's what Mike has been brought up
into a human rights tribunal.

899
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:51,700
What is going on Canada?
What the fuck you do?

900
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,120
Lasting physical and psychological
effect.

901
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,910
What's the physical effect?
We'll see.

902
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,500
I don't know.
I would say,

903
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,680
here's one thing.
If this woman came to a show,

904
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,640
okay,
let's let's,

905
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,290
let's be honest about this,
and,

906
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,100
and he just started to register the
worst case scenario.

907
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,540
I'm on her side.
If she,

908
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:12,240
if she's sitting there with her
girlfriend and she didn't do anything,

909
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,710
she's saying a bunch of lesbian shit to
her and being mean to her and just being

910
00:41:16,711 --> 00:41:20,160
an asshole and you know,
guys have done that,

911
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,750
right?
We all know comics,

912
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:26,640
W we've all seen bad comics do things
like that or take attempts,

913
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,340
you know,
trying to be funny and it's just

914
00:41:29,341 --> 00:41:31,920
defensive.
If you paid money to see something like

915
00:41:31,921 --> 00:41:33,860
that,
no matter what it is,

916
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:34,070
whether

917
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,140
it's a black joke,
whether it's a,

918
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,810
you know,
a joke about Asian people and you're

919
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:41,810
getting your,
you feel like abused joke about their

920
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:45,150
height.
Whereas a line after that and that way

921
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:50,240
really a matter of what is being said,
it's not like just a blank subject,

922
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,040
right?
We can't say what if it's a joke about

923
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:54,770
being black because it could be a joke.
You know,

924
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,410
he really,
here's the problem and you can't really

925
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:59,020
make it up to anyone.
Right?

926
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,830
It's got to be like you're allowed to
say everything.

927
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,030
You're gonna not allowed to say
everything,

928
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,760
but how do you do a monetary number?
That's weird.

929
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,260
Well,
I mean like how do you make,

930
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,500
these are my doctor's bills,
my cycle,

931
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,440
my psychologist bills.
This is how much workup I've missed.

932
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,870
You could do it that way.
I think in this case in grant is not a

933
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:15,980
huge amount of money.

934
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,200
It's a lot,
but it's not like those Mcdonald's

935
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:19,450
settlements.
Right.

936
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:23,010
For comic though,
who's working for?

937
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,771
Sure.
Plus,

938
00:42:23,771 --> 00:42:25,160
I'm sure has legal fees.
Right.

939
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,720
But what I was going to get at is did
the girl Heco first?

940
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:30,401
Yeah,
I see that.

941
00:42:30,401 --> 00:42:34,250
That's what I don't know.
See if she did then fuck her.

942
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,450
Yeah.
Like yeah,

943
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:38,390
he probably shouldn't say mean shit
about her.

944
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,660
I've seen stories about a guy,
a comic going off on somebody,

945
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:45,290
so when the court of public opinion like
they get eviscerated because they went

946
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:47,880
off to hard on somebody but then people
would have to show.

947
00:42:47,881 --> 00:42:50,210
But like none of this lady was heckling
everyone in the show.

948
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,560
Let's see what it says here in May of
2007.

949
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:58,130
I don't need to read her name.
And a girlfriend were at a club in

950
00:42:58,131 --> 00:43:00,350
Vancouver,
have restaurant Vancouver restaurant

951
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:02,060
with a largely gay clientele.

952
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,810
When an open mic night hosted by Mr Earl
kicked off,

953
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:09,470
the two women decided to stay according
to the latest findings of the human

954
00:43:09,471 --> 00:43:14,471
rights tribunal during the show.
Mrs purdy's girlfriend had ms dot

955
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:19,751
[inaudible] girlfriend had merely pecked
her on the cheek when Mr Earl told the

956
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:22,940
crowd.
Don't mind that inconsiderate dyke table

957
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:23,751
over there.
You know,

958
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:25,450
lesbians are always ruin it for
everybody.

959
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,930
Stop right there.
Stop right there.

960
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,460
Go back up.
Let me read that.

961
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,360
I've seen that before.
All I did was this one,

962
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:36,020
their mom being fully making out and
then just dropping everyone.

963
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:38,390
Why else would we say don't mind that
inconsiderate.

964
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,550
You're ruining it for everyone.
I would imagine there's probably some

965
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,710
chatter.
Yeah,

966
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,810
probably that happened.
He went off to hard,

967
00:43:46,811 --> 00:43:47,960
but we've all seen that.
What?

968
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:49,580
They don't want to admit that they did
that.

969
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:50,500
Yeah,
exactly.

970
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,340
It's always that.
It's always like,

971
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:53,360
I didn't do anything.

972
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,980
All he did was move my chair and it's
like,

973
00:43:54,981 --> 00:43:56,720
no,
why would anyone throw you out when

974
00:43:56,721 --> 00:44:00,770
you're a customer for doing nothing?
And it was just laughing.

975
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,290
Shut up.
There's a lot of different kinds of

976
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:04,280
lesbians.
Yeah,

977
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,760
there's like educated lesbians that are
into the art and then there's like the

978
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:15,200
bull dykey lesbians that are like more
thicker,

979
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:17,270
bigger boned,
right.

980
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:21,020
And then there's a lipstick,
lesbians,

981
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,980
they all Buddhism as line prompted boost
and ms dot parties table and then they

982
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,800
escalated the string of slurs and it's
like,

983
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:29,000
all right,
you don't like it,

984
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:30,620
you're singing artists,
get the fuck out.

985
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,010
Yeah,
I don't like this.

986
00:44:32,011 --> 00:44:33,720
So leave.
Then it's okay.

987
00:44:33,721 --> 00:44:35,820
You can just leave.
Really.

988
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:38,250
It's hard to watch your money back fine
and get your money back.

989
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:43,310
Or was it this where they just to really
pretty interesting women.

990
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:48,150
And one of them did kiss her friend on
the cheek lightly in the comic was

991
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:52,080
eating Dick on stage and he started
blaming these girls for the fact that

992
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:52,860
he's eating Dick onstage.

993
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:54,210
You ever seen that happen?
Absolutely.

994
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:56,400
So here's the day.
So we should be fair here.

995
00:44:56,401 --> 00:44:56,960
Right?
So yeah.

996
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,450
So let's say it was that way.
So in that scenario they should get

997
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:05,451
their money back and leave.
You still can't stop a guy of artists

998
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:06,970
from fucking trying something.
Right?

999
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,060
Right.
You'd never get to know what the line is

1000
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:11,250
unless you cross it and then you pull it
back a little bit,

1001
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,060
so if you don't let a guy even try to
get to the line,

1002
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,500
then you're hurting art in general.
This is what he said.

1003
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:18,900
That's really rude.
You're not even lesbians.

1004
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,390
No Guy will fuck you.
That's why you're with each other.

1005
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,543
Okay.

1006
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:27,860
I'm still on the side.
I'm smart.

1007
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,760
I see myself saying that.
My darkest moments for sure depends

1008
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:33,750
really.
We don't know.

1009
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:35,150
We see like,
here's another problem.

1010
00:45:35,151 --> 00:45:36,900
That's a problem with when Kramer did
that stuff,

1011
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:37,710
it was like,
oh yeah,

1012
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,180
I get it.
I get the point of like,

1013
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:42,240
I just want to hurt you now,
and that's not even what he was trying

1014
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:44,640
to do.
Here's the thing and looking at it on

1015
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,570
print here,
like,

1016
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,310
yes,
it's so much different.

1017
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,280
Much different.
Looking at it on print is so much

1018
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:51,300
different.
We're missing.

1019
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,920
It's just like,
first of all,

1020
00:45:52,921 --> 00:45:55,080
we don't know if that's exactly what he
said.

1021
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:57,060
I mean,
it's just taking from a recording or

1022
00:45:57,061 --> 00:46:00,900
just from people's memory,
like how exactly do we know exactly what

1023
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:04,620
he said and she says,
he said to call that discrimination,

1024
00:46:04,621 --> 00:46:07,120
but discrimination is if they wouldn't
let them in because there were less

1025
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:07,590
young.

1026
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:11,190
Jamie
says in the court case,

1027
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:14,490
they used a witness testimony from junk
patrons that were there.

1028
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,670
See,
you can't do that because I don't

1029
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:21,150
remember guys joke sometimes and I'm a
fucking comedian.

1030
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,940
They.
I doubt they remember exactly what he

1031
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:26,070
said.
Especially if they're hammered.

1032
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,830
Come on.
Everyone was bullying him.

1033
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,230
He was an asshole.
It's like,

1034
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,280
here's just going down.
Here's the thing.

1035
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:36,970
Know from Mike or if comics are bad,
they will eventually stop.

1036
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,660
They'll stop or they'll get better,
they'll get better,

1037
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:42,860
but if you're hecklin he's not going to
get.

1038
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,690
You're just fucking.
You're not supposed to do that.

1039
00:46:45,691 --> 00:46:48,240
And when you do do that,
you open the door to chaos.

1040
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,830
Also.
I've had stuff where it's like,

1041
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,460
I'm going to take it down one road and
then I'll,

1042
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,110
I'll take it clear in the.
Don't worry if you just be quiet and

1043
00:46:55,111 --> 00:46:55,950
listen the whole time.

1044
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:57,900
You'll see where I'm going with this and
you'll be fine,

1045
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,750
but if you stop me in the middle,
it's going to make it seem really bad

1046
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,360
what I said exactly.
So exactly.

1047
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:06,120
If if you get interrupted,
you're just going to look bad and it's a

1048
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:09,390
long second.
Make someone pay money off of doing the

1049
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:10,980
art badly.
Exactly.

1050
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,990
Except for when I'm not even saying it
was bad.

1051
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:14,760
He might have fucking gotten other
people laughing at him.

1052
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:16,470
Yeah.
I don't know what happened.

1053
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,420
I don't.
So it's so hard,

1054
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:23,610
but I think the monetary aspect of it.
A monetary judgment like come on

1055
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,460
$15,000.
Like what really happened there?

1056
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,710
Until you can define what really
happened.

1057
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,750
Yeah.
It sounds so crazy.

1058
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,060
She did just come up with a number.
15,000.

1059
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,720
Pay The money.
Give money to people.

1060
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:40,300
You have to give them money to leave to
get mad at you.

1061
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,130
Yeah.
Can you say shit to people on the

1062
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:44,620
street?
Can you like call someone a Dick on the

1063
00:47:44,621 --> 00:47:45,450
story?
Here's the thing,

1064
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:50,450
if you get sued for that,
what is it about like like gay slurs?

1065
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:53,410
Is that what it was?
What it was that it was a gay thing

1066
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:57,730
because like what if he just
concentrated on other aspects of her?

1067
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,320
Yeah,
exactly what it was like.

1068
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:02,530
You can't get a better girlfriend
because you're too empty inside.

1069
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,030
Like really want to hurt her in a
different way.

1070
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:04,841
That nothing to do with it.
Yeah.

1071
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:06,820
People wouldn't be as mad.
That was kind of bullshit.

1072
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:09,640
It's not about the hurting.
It's about the how he's hurting.

1073
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:11,680
Yeah.
He's hurting her by saying that he

1074
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:13,600
can't.
She can't get men to fucker.

1075
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,790
That's why she's a lesbian.
She's not even a real lesbian.

1076
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,230
He's trying to hurt her there because
it's like,

1077
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,390
well,
it's like why you listen to.

1078
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:21,340
A funny thing to say.
That's what a comic would say.

1079
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,550
He has to try.
Yeah.

1080
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,140
Dissertation on
Lesbian Rights.

1081
00:48:28,141 --> 00:48:30,130
He's also add living,
and again,

1082
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,620
we're not taking this guy side because
we don't know what happened.

1083
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,110
I don't know.
I mean who knows?

1084
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,440
He might have been a dick and then is it
up to the rest of the audience that

1085
00:48:38,441 --> 00:48:39,490
aside,
how's Nikki?

1086
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,750
She was.
Or was it just like,

1087
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,610
no,
I felt hurt so I get the money.

1088
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,690
I.
It's just like,

1089
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,840
it's an art form.
You can't stop anyone from doing or

1090
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:49,450
saying anything.
That's why you allowed to smoke on stage

1091
00:48:49,451 --> 00:48:51,940
here because like,
well it's part of the stage.

1092
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:55,470
Just like our pal smoke four cigarettes
the other night in a 20 minutes set.

1093
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,100
Once I saw might have another one.
I was like,

1094
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,030
yeah,
it was hilarious.

1095
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,810
What does it say here?
In addition to Mr earls $15,000 penalty,

1096
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:09,640
the restaurant was also ordered to pay
$70,000 since he was,

1097
00:49:09,641 --> 00:49:10,510
had a bar tab.

1098
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,870
He was illegally an employee.
Oh my God.

1099
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:18,880
So because the comedian had a small bar
tab to host the event,

1100
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:22,510
the comedian was legally an employee.
Oh man,

1101
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:24,480
that's sad.
It's Earl Lloyd.

1102
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:26,770
The tribunal,
the tribunal.

1103
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,660
What is the.
What rights do they have?

1104
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:33,990
Nordic gods,
Greek and fucking thor comes down and

1105
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:36,610
slams the hammer at the end of the
decision.

1106
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,240
So stupid looking ms.party.
So that Mr the guy,

1107
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:41,800
the comedian,
that host of the show,

1108
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:46,570
we try to say that the lady played a
vital and highly dramatic role,

1109
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,720
utterly disrupting a performance by
unpaid volunteers.

1110
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:53,530
Comedy clubs like no other places.
The quintessential element that

1111
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:56,950
distinguishes them from vapid mainstream
media is the fearless pursuit of free

1112
00:49:56,951 --> 00:50:01,050
speech.
Let's listen to this though too.

1113
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:06,120
Played a vital and highly dramatic role
in utterly disrupting or performance by

1114
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:11,490
unpaid volunteers from Mike can go on
and you guys are for that sentence.

1115
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,050
When he finished that sentence and he
hit that period,

1116
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:16,690
the judge should have said this over
here when you.

1117
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,610
When you get out of here.
This is over.

1118
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:20,200
Oh,
she was messing you guys up.

1119
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:20,680
Well,
I just,

1120
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,030
I'm on his side.
Just by the way he spells things spelled

1121
00:50:24,031 --> 00:50:27,980
things out like his,
his sentencing project and the judge's

1122
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:30,380
words.
The comic was not giving a comedy

1123
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:33,830
performance when he launched into his
tirade of ugly words directly at Ms Dot

1124
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:36,680
Party.
But you can see that there were jokes

1125
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:37,514
there.
Yeah,

1126
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,850
that's not true because it was funny,
but even if he doesn't land them,

1127
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:43,310
it's like if you can see any committee,
you can get an expert to say,

1128
00:50:43,311 --> 00:50:44,720
Oh yeah,
here's where he was trying to get a

1129
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:46,340
joke.
Here's what he's trying to get a laugh.

1130
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,810
Well,
let's scroll back up to the thing that

1131
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:50,840
he said to her because it's clearly a
joke and if,

1132
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,850
if,
if it's the way for the water,

1133
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:56,750
and by the way this is people doing a
lot of water,

1134
00:50:56,751 --> 00:51:00,440
throwing shit.
She threw water at him twice instead of

1135
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:03,230
telling them,
wait a minute,

1136
00:51:03,231 --> 00:51:05,360
wait a minute.
She threw water at him.

1137
00:51:05,361 --> 00:51:06,740
Yeah.
Oh,

1138
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:08,270
well that's just silly.

1139
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,950
Come on.
Crazy lady.

1140
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:11,791
Like,
what are we doing?

1141
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:12,810
We kind of,
it wasn't enough.

1142
00:51:12,811 --> 00:51:16,980
We barely hitting each other.
We're going to slap slap fest for two

1143
00:51:16,981 --> 00:51:19,540
glasses of water through it.
Two glasses of water and he broke her

1144
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:23,490
sunglasses and turn and he broke it.
Jesus Christ.

1145
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,541
What?
What do they do?

1146
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:26,300
And they're like,
chimps,

1147
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,600
smack and trees.
I could see that somebody threw a glass

1148
00:51:28,601 --> 00:51:29,950
of water at me and the throat.
Another one,

1149
00:51:29,951 --> 00:51:31,210
and it was a girl,
so I couldn't hit her.

1150
00:51:31,211 --> 00:51:31,870
I'd be like,
well,

1151
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:33,490
you can't just fucking.
I could see.

1152
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:35,160
Wow,
I can see that.

1153
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,620
Fuck.
If I would not as Mr Earl told that.

1154
00:51:38,621 --> 00:51:39,670
However,
even lesbians,

1155
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,680
no guy will fuck you.
That's why you're with each other.

1156
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:44,020
That's the joke.
Yeah.

1157
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,010
Well,
it's clearly joke.

1158
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:45,873
Well,
listen to his,

1159
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:49,120
his point of view though,
he says the couple was passionately

1160
00:51:49,121 --> 00:51:53,410
kissing in the front and repeatedly
interrupting the set with obscenities

1161
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,880
when Mr Earl tried to shut up the table
with the quip.

1162
00:51:58,881 --> 00:52:01,040
You're not even lesbians.
No Guy will fuck you.

1163
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:05,210
That's why you're with each other just
thus kissing off the ugly escalation.

1164
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:05,660
Well,
okay,

1165
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,810
so that's the exact situation that's
happened a billion times that you've

1166
00:52:08,811 --> 00:52:10,730
seen.
People are being way too loud and

1167
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:12,740
disruptive and they don't believe they
are.

1168
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:13,910
They have no idea.
Well,

1169
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:15,270
it's people who were talking about
before.

1170
00:52:15,271 --> 00:52:16,850
So this tribunal said,
okay,

1171
00:52:16,851 --> 00:52:20,180
if that happens and you're too harsh,
you're going to have to pay money that

1172
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:24,080
you can't afford.
It's an open mic or is paying 15 grand.

1173
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:27,890
Canada has legislated politeness.
That's how serious they take their

1174
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:28,910
politeness up there.

1175
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:33,400
They made laws where you have to be
polite.

1176
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,950
Well,
in this situation,

1177
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,860
clubs are going to start recording,
filming sets.

1178
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,140
That's the only way they're going to be
out there.

1179
00:52:40,141 --> 00:52:42,250
I mean this,
this owner would have had it been.

1180
00:52:42,251 --> 00:52:47,251
That takes away the sort of stand up.
Comedy is counterculture and part of it

1181
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:48,340
exists because like,
hey,

1182
00:52:48,341 --> 00:52:50,920
nobody's recording this.
This is all just existing right now in a

1183
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:54,420
basement of some whole.
I agree and I think that's it.

1184
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,740
Then you take away like,
hold on,

1185
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:57,693
right?
I,

1186
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,490
I agree with you.
I think it's a beautiful aspect of it,

1187
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:03,190
but this poor fucking guy.
I mean if this is the landscape,

1188
00:53:03,191 --> 00:53:07,750
they're going to have to operate again.
He's the owner of the God damn club is

1189
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:10,000
getting fucked over by an open mic or
hood.

1190
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:11,260
So Hey,
he has no incentive.

1191
00:53:11,261 --> 00:53:12,550
Now.
This isn't just the,

1192
00:53:12,551 --> 00:53:15,760
the thought of any club,
any place,

1193
00:53:15,761 --> 00:53:19,450
have an open mic at their place.
Open mic nights are filled with crazy

1194
00:53:19,451 --> 00:53:22,690
people and people will become great
comedians.

1195
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:26,100
Yes,
but the ratio very high

1196
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,680
too crazy.
But even the ones that are going to

1197
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:30,030
become great or terrible when they're at
the open mic.

1198
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:32,700
Yes,
and they can make terrible decisions

1199
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:35,130
fucking right.
And they might be one day,

1200
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,590
20 years later,
your all time favorite comedian,

1201
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,050
but right now they're clunking their way
through everything and spilling their

1202
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:45,870
fucking drink and
just nobody does it right in the

1203
00:53:45,871 --> 00:53:47,820
beginning.
It's an ad Lib thing.

1204
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,300
And when you're ad libbing like that,
like where there's people in the

1205
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:55,800
audience that are disrupting this show,
if it's true from his perspective,

1206
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:58,040
what he's saying,
well they're,

1207
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:02,070
they're interrupting with his job and
his job is to talk and to be funny.

1208
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:06,630
So now you've engaged in some sort of a
verbal warfare with a comedian who has a

1209
00:54:06,631 --> 00:54:08,370
microphone.
You can pay for that because they

1210
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:11,970
couldn't see where the comedy will.
The fact that she threw drinks at home,

1211
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:14,190
that's just sort of void out the whole
thing.

1212
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,950
Like I guess was saying,
well she was already so disrupted that

1213
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,380
she had a.

1214
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,460
I don't know man.
I don't like talking about these things

1215
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:25,800
if I wasn't there because we all see how
this,

1216
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:27,570
how this could play out exactly like a
show.

1217
00:54:27,571 --> 00:54:31,170
You've been on that side of that.
So he is 100 percent.

1218
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,820
So now,
right now what you're saying is,

1219
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:34,200
hey,
open mic places don't,

1220
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,090
don't start.
That's the worst part about it.

1221
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,380
It's going to discourage the clubs from
taking a chance and putting on these

1222
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:44,340
amateurs who they don't know.
These people owe you an open mic night,

1223
00:54:44,341 --> 00:54:46,740
folks.
Let me just put it in perspective.

1224
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:52,010
We had a guy who dropped a bomb maybe 75
times at this place on sunset at this

1225
00:54:53,641 --> 00:54:57,250
recovery place of recovery place with
recovery place.

1226
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,830
It was just where people hung out.
Oh,

1227
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,290
and he did like a set thing?
Yeah,

1228
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:01,880
yeah,
yeah.

1229
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,470
It was an open mic.
Was open mic and it was so

1230
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:05,550
uncomfortable.

1231
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:08,120
Whoa.
But then whatever he felt it too

1232
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:13,050
probably won't do that again.
Or he will or he will cut it down about

1233
00:55:13,051 --> 00:55:16,860
10 n words or that's his point is just
trying to shock everyone.

1234
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,030
Yeah,
that's fine.

1235
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:21,030
He said it.
He just maybe doesn't know how goofy

1236
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:23,550
sounds.
Some people don't know how goofy they

1237
00:55:23,551 --> 00:55:25,020
sound.
Yeah,

1238
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:29,480
you gotta get a response from people
like if you're around and it's going to

1239
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,450
shock what if that's what you're going
for is to offend.

1240
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:35,010
That's what you're looking for.
That's the emotion you're trying to get

1241
00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:38,250
out of it audience,
and it's like we're going to legislate

1242
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:41,340
and say that's not one you can get it
out of them or what if it's like you

1243
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,780
think that that's going to be funny,
but it's not like you just suck it.

1244
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:48,480
It just.
It's not working like you suck at this.

1245
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:53,220
Kind of like diy as angry is one of the
funniest things ever on his fucking face

1246
00:55:53,221 --> 00:55:56,940
gets red and he starts getting mad.
He started screaming about how when he

1247
00:55:56,941 --> 00:55:58,010
was a kid,
bottled water,

1248
00:55:58,011 --> 00:55:59,400
he goes,
I used to drink puddle water.

1249
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,990
He's fucking beat red in the face like
that.

1250
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:07,950
That real anger.
That shit's hilarious because he's got

1251
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:11,610
jokes and real anger,
but when you have like a manufactured

1252
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:16,440
anger and you're trying to be edgy,
brands can see through them.

1253
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:17,610
To me,
that's offensive.

1254
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,180
It's offensive if you're not in the
moment for sure.

1255
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,950
Like when Joey's talking about bottled
water,

1256
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,670
he's in the moment.
It's,

1257
00:56:24,671 --> 00:56:27,640
it's,
it's a puddle of water.

1258
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:31,150
We've.
We've all sort of figured this out in

1259
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,850
our own way,
but when you're on stage and you're

1260
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,350
locked in,
right?

1261
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:38,290
You're either.
The audience is laughing hard,

1262
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,520
everything's going great.
It feels like some kind of a mass

1263
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:46,400
hypnosis in a way because you're
conducting them,

1264
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,920
like pointed them at all.

1265
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,000
Laugh.
Yeah,

1266
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:49,910
both.
It's,

1267
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:52,840
it's that,
but it's also like I feel like when I

1268
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:57,930
watch were in the audience.
I watched bird the other day at the,

1269
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:00,460
at the store,
the main room and then Chappelle the

1270
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:04,270
other day in the EOA locked in to.
I loved it.

1271
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:08,560
I loved it as a an audience member and I
was thinking like when they were doing

1272
00:57:08,561 --> 00:57:13,060
their jokes and I'm laughing,
I'm like going along with their thought

1273
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:17,570
process and I'm as it's happening to me,
I'm recognizing this thing that it's

1274
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,240
somehow or another they're thinking for
you like they're thinking for you and

1275
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:25,080
you just on a ride with those things for
you,

1276
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,170
your comic on stage.
No.

1277
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,580
So when someone had some fake rant and
you're like,

1278
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:31,900
oh,
stop.

1279
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:34,290
Like if someone came over your house and
went,

1280
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:39,130
the problem with the government is
programs on tv or programming you.

1281
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,020
That's what they call them.
Programs.

1282
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,033
You know,
if you were,

1283
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,390
this guy was in your house,
you'd be like,

1284
00:57:43,391 --> 00:57:45,310
will you shut the fuck up?
C'Mon man.

1285
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:50,440
If dns is in your house and he starts
talking to you about some shit you,

1286
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:52,610
you just,
you have a free show you.

1287
00:57:52,611 --> 00:57:56,170
It's like a show with Ds.
We have shows with him whenever we hang

1288
00:57:56,171 --> 00:57:59,560
out.
Like he'll perform restaurant.

1289
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,720
He was on the ride over here.
It was fun.

1290
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:04,760
He's always on.
He's a live,

1291
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,150
you know,
I just don't think it should be up to

1292
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,560
anyone to decide what that line is of
right or wrong.

1293
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,290
Nailed it or didn't nail it.
Yeah.

1294
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,400
You just can't align is different than
your law.

1295
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:16,480
Even the too soon kind of thing.
Like I heard somebody,

1296
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:21,370
her Jeff Roth do a joke about something.
It was South Carolina but it was like a

1297
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,900
year later,
but I remember people trying to do jokes

1298
00:58:22,901 --> 00:58:24,160
right there and people like no.

1299
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:26,950
And so then jeff did it and it hit and
still got an oh,

1300
00:58:26,951 --> 00:58:28,300
like a year later and you're like,
oh,

1301
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:30,490
but it's like,
oh well I want as far as an audience

1302
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:32,500
member is the day of.
Yeah.

1303
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,840
So we just,
we like different things.

1304
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:38,590
I like spicier foods so it's fine.
My favorite example of people saying

1305
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:41,170
something isn't funny that was fucking
hilarious.

1306
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:46,150
Was already laying already laying got in
trouble for that twitter stuff because

1307
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:48,160
he said,
he goes,

1308
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,050
he goes,
I was having sex with.

1309
00:58:50,051 --> 00:58:51,520
It's really,
I'm paraphrasing,

1310
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,890
I was having sex.
It's really hot black girl.

1311
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,760
And I was on top of her and she goes,
I can't breathe.

1312
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,220
And I'm like,
let's not make this political.

1313
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,340
I'll bring politics into the bedroom
politics.

1314
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:10,950
People got up and screamed at him at the
cellar in New York and they stormed out

1315
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:12,401
of there.
I mean,

1316
00:59:12,401 --> 00:59:15,520
this is like,
the guy attempted suicide too,

1317
00:59:15,521 --> 00:59:16,390
by the way.
Right?

1318
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:19,300
Already,
wasn't it like a year before that,

1319
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,110
like it wasn't like a long time.
Maybe

1320
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:24,080
two years.
Right.

1321
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,900
So he's just getting back to that,
that uh,

1322
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:28,720
I can't breathe time.
It was like,

1323
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,150
fuck,
fuck you Eric Gardner with those cops

1324
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,190
about that.
And it's like,

1325
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,470
oh yeah,
see me.

1326
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,850
I felt,
I mean this,

1327
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:39,860
the only way you would look at it and
say you can't make jokes about that is

1328
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:44,360
if you feel like it's somehow racist
because if it was any other,

1329
00:59:44,361 --> 00:59:47,050
any other reason like you could totally
make a joke about.

1330
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,520
Yeah.
Like you're not even listening to it,

1331
00:59:49,521 --> 00:59:50,660
right?
Just you're just going,

1332
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:52,670
I think this is wrong.
I'm going to interrupt him.

1333
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,220
Yell.
Yeah.

1334
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,850
If you listen to what he's saying and
the joke like,

1335
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:58,720
come on,
like that'd be like interrupting fucking

1336
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:02,600
a.
it's not even a Joe Jonathan swift essay

1337
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:03,530
because you're like,
wait,

1338
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:08,030
are you saying we should kill kids?
They just appreciate chosen.

1339
01:00:08,031 --> 01:00:09,020
Yes,
exactly.

1340
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:13,730
Let's get this guy to fuck off.
But the joke is not saying it's not

1341
01:00:13,731 --> 01:00:17,360
making fun of the guy who died in the
cops killing him.

1342
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:20,420
The joke is making fun of everyone
talking about it.

1343
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:21,310
Yes,
that's it.

1344
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:25,190
It's just it.
The joke is him with a hot black girl

1345
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,110
that needs smothering here because he's
fat.

1346
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,060
She says,
I can't breathe.

1347
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:31,490
I mean,
that's a fucking great joke.

1348
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,030
It's a great joke and it's not mean.
Here's the joke.

1349
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:39,950
The protests are affecting my life.
Last week I was having sex with a black

1350
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:40,910
girl.
She yelled out,

1351
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:43,490
I can't breathe.
I want to heat.

1352
01:00:43,491 --> 01:00:47,420
So he put it on twitter right at the end
of 2014.

1353
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,510
So at the height of the right,
right,

1354
01:00:50,511 --> 01:00:53,220
right.
Oh well this was the punchline.

1355
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,760
I think the black lives matter thing has
never been bigger,

1356
01:00:55,761 --> 01:00:58,040
so I'm thinking you'd say it the harder,
but I think it's bigger now than ever

1357
01:00:58,041 --> 01:00:58,874
before.

1358
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:01,340
I don't think so at all.
I don't think so at all.

1359
01:01:01,341 --> 01:01:03,810
I think it's kind of eating itself a
little when people going ah,

1360
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,220
well,
like all the

1361
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:10,100
comps.
Well also one of the guys that worked

1362
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:11,420
for him was white,
uh,

1363
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,710
real estate that kind of proved this guy
was white who one of the guys in black

1364
01:01:15,711 --> 01:01:17,300
lives matter.
It was white guys.

1365
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,570
Apparently he's a white guy,
allegedly.

1366
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:25,220
What the fuck do I know?
But the point is that one was

1367
01:01:25,221 --> 01:01:29,060
particularly agregious that incident
with that Eric Gardener Guy.

1368
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:30,660
I got disgusted by that.
Oh yeah.

1369
01:01:30,661 --> 01:01:32,870
I was terrible because they all,
it was with cigarettes.

1370
01:01:32,871 --> 01:01:35,390
The guy was selling loose cigarettes.
He didn't do anything.

1371
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,890
And that's the problem with that is that
comes from that.

1372
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:39,890
It creates,
it's sorry,

1373
01:01:39,891 --> 01:01:44,240
it comes from a place of back.
I had to sell loose cigarettes to make a

1374
01:01:44,241 --> 01:01:44,630
living.

1375
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:48,770
Not like he ain't Robin people.
He's selling loose cigarettes for a

1376
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:51,920
fucking dollar,
a piece like the people who can't afford

1377
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:55,790
a it.
That's not a guy who's wants to dream of

1378
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:58,250
that as a job and a career.
So it's like,

1379
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:00,740
all right,
they're poor people and you're saying we

1380
01:02:00,741 --> 01:02:03,710
have regulations with the government's
got to get paid so some guys are able to

1381
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:05,570
push you around and they're like,
eh,

1382
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:06,620
he had asthma,
but it's like,

1383
01:02:06,621 --> 01:02:09,850
why is he fucking big that violent,
this beat it.

1384
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:12,680
Cops are not supposed to be revenue
collector's.

1385
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:15,620
Yeah,
there's just not that stupid stupid for

1386
01:02:15,621 --> 01:02:19,770
the cop to be put in that position where
you're making them arrest people because

1387
01:02:19,771 --> 01:02:19,980
you have

1388
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,980
a quota.
Like we have to figure out a way where

1389
01:02:22,981 --> 01:02:25,260
these people don't.
Don't get paid that way.

1390
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:30,680
Like the idea that you have to have a
certain amount of crime every day in

1391
01:02:30,901 --> 01:02:35,070
order to keep your position as a cop.
That's insane.

1392
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,350
Like what about a perfect world?
What would we employ?

1393
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,620
A lot of great cops,
they become a member of the community

1394
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:42,720
respected member because you don't have
any fucking crime,

1395
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:46,700
so the cop doesn't be a problem anymore.
It's not like the old west.

1396
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:49,000
Look at them as a thing here because the
sheriff's got to.

1397
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:51,120
We'll comp.
You should look at comps.

1398
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:53,820
W it would be ideal,
like in a perfect world.

1399
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,000
Yeah.
All the people that were police officers

1400
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,890
would be the coolest fucking people in
the world.

1401
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:03,810
They just wanted everything to be cool.
Everything to stay calm and in the best

1402
01:03:03,811 --> 01:03:06,570
case scenario,
you live in a world where like we were

1403
01:03:06,571 --> 01:03:08,880
talking about how little violence there
is,

1404
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,320
imagines that got way better.

1405
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:14,580
Imagine if like the Douche douchebag
factor got reduced dramatically.

1406
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,320
What?
For whatever way,

1407
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:18,240
in whatever way,
imagine,

1408
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,970
imagine how wonderful it would be.
The world would be perfect.

1409
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:23,760
We wouldn't have.
We wouldn't have this fear that people

1410
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:27,420
constantly have of getting their home
broken into getting their ass kicked or

1411
01:03:27,421 --> 01:03:29,250
getting in a fight or getting this.
We're getting that.

1412
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,460
All of it could go away,
but

1413
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,440
you can't just fucking choke a guy for
cigarettes.

1414
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,800
You can't do that,
you just can't do it the way they slam

1415
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:44,340
people's faces into that Shit meant what
is it?

1416
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,330
Because it's written down somewhere.
What?

1417
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:47,173
It's.
There's some,

1418
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:52,340
some one decided there's a swath of land
and you've got a market cross it.

1419
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,740
Some people sneak over,
they don't have good paperworks.

1420
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,910
I don't get a good education or you
know,

1421
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:00,990
this guy's life was like,
I don't know if he was an immigrant.

1422
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:04,290
I'm making up an immigrant story,
but there's so many people that do so

1423
01:04:04,291 --> 01:04:09,050
many different things in this world
because they're trying to get by and the

1424
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,360
idea that someone would tackle you and
choke you just because you're selling

1425
01:04:12,361 --> 01:04:14,370
loose cigarettes.
Like for worse,

1426
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,150
a ticketable offense if.
How about if he's selling stolen

1427
01:04:18,151 --> 01:04:21,210
cigarettes that he broke into a building
that's one thing.

1428
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:21,870
Well,
this guy,

1429
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:23,280
so they told,
they told that,

1430
01:04:23,281 --> 01:04:24,720
uh,
whatever,

1431
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,150
the head cop there was like,
no more choke holds.

1432
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,530
And so he did it anyway.
Yeah,

1433
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,590
he had a PPO,
but.

1434
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:33,030
So he'll have to choke a guy like that
and their defense.

1435
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,010
But here's the thing,
that choke shouldn't kill you.

1436
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,660
You certainly do.
If it's a fight,

1437
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:41,130
it wasn't a fight.
Exactly in that situation and if he's

1438
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,070
defending himself,
I'm saying the only time you would have

1439
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:49,071
to use a chokehold against a person is
that if that person is somehow right.

1440
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:51,390
So okay,
let me just dragging.

1441
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,940
The guy told them to stop using short
codes and use it anyway.

1442
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,490
Now you have to.
If you want to take the gun to the

1443
01:04:56,491 --> 01:04:57,000
ground.
Yeah,

1444
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,010
but he said the head cop was like,
guys,

1445
01:04:59,011 --> 01:05:01,350
no more of this before this.
He was anyway.

1446
01:05:01,351 --> 01:05:05,940
So if I went and choke somebody and he
died and I can say,

1447
01:05:05,941 --> 01:05:07,230
well,
he just had had asthma.

1448
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:10,380
What trouble would I be in big time?
Manslaughter.

1449
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:11,250
Manslaughter,
sure.

1450
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,370
Yeah.
Couldn't I couldn't use the excuse.

1451
01:05:13,371 --> 01:05:15,630
So it depends.
Depends on what evidence the guy could

1452
01:05:15,631 --> 01:05:19,060
be like in this situation.
So let's look at this situation because

1453
01:05:19,061 --> 01:05:21,340
in this situation that guy was totally
passive.

1454
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:23,770
He didn't do anything wrong.
It was ugly.

1455
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,330
It was ugly.
The way they grabbed him.

1456
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:26,670
It was ugly.
But I'm.

1457
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,920
What I'm saying is if you want to
control a guy who's that big once,

1458
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:33,190
once it's a physical altercation,
don't wait until he starts punching you

1459
01:05:33,191 --> 01:05:34,480
or biting you before he choked him.

1460
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,240
You choke them quick.
That's just what you do and I don't.

1461
01:05:37,241 --> 01:05:39,190
I'm not condoning it in any way,
shape or form.

1462
01:05:39,191 --> 01:05:43,540
I think it was a terrible,
terrible miscarriage of of like what's

1463
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:45,910
ethically right,
what's ethically right.

1464
01:05:45,911 --> 01:05:49,870
It's not that the people with guns that
are employed by the state come after you

1465
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:52,810
and drag you to the ground because
they're not getting their tax money from

1466
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:54,590
you,
which is all this loose cigarette thing.

1467
01:05:54,591 --> 01:05:56,620
And what if the store owner did the
exact same thing?

1468
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,600
Well,
what if what you were saying you did,

1469
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:00,460
you would have to have a reason to do
it.

1470
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,970
I mean it would have some.
It looks like the same reason the cut

1471
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:04,481
was like,
Hey,

1472
01:06:04,481 --> 01:06:06,400
I don't want you here.
I sell cigarettes in here.

1473
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:07,870
I think I was like,
I'm just trying to do.

1474
01:06:07,871 --> 01:06:09,820
And then he just ran up on them,
choked him,

1475
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:11,230
and then he has asthma made him die.

1476
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,000
It depends on how it escalates,
you know,

1477
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:15,010
if you just attacked him,
I would say.

1478
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:17,950
Yeah man,
you just assaulted him for no reason.

1479
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:20,740
Like what if,
what if he told you to fuck off and then

1480
01:06:20,741 --> 01:06:23,140
try to sucker punch you and you had to
duck under his punch.

1481
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:24,400
He didn't do this though.
Exactly.

1482
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:26,170
He didn't.
So then it would be a different story.

1483
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:29,050
So in this situation,
I mean this wasn't like the store owner

1484
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:30,520
didn't do shit.
They called the cops,

1485
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,680
the cops,
but it was about a fight because that

1486
01:06:32,681 --> 01:06:33,580
guy had,
he had,

1487
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:37,120
there's been a fight before.
That's why the cops had showed up.

1488
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,130
So they showed up.
All geared up.

1489
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,710
Yeah.
They showed up geared up because there

1490
01:06:41,711 --> 01:06:46,390
was an incident and I think this guy
might've even called it in.

1491
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:49,030
The guy who they wound up killing.
Oh No.

1492
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:49,780
Yeah.

1493
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:54,490
I don't know exactly what happened,
but this dude just happened to be there

1494
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:56,500
when it went down.
I might be wrong about him calling it

1495
01:06:56,501 --> 01:06:59,520
in,
but he was just there and so they,

1496
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:03,010
they come looking for this fight.
The fight wasn't there and then they

1497
01:07:03,011 --> 01:07:05,260
started going after the result of this
cop.

1498
01:07:05,261 --> 01:07:06,670
What's happened to them?
I don't know,

1499
01:07:06,671 --> 01:07:08,230
man.
I don't want to single the cop out.

1500
01:07:08,231 --> 01:07:10,930
I don't even want to mention his name.
The other thing is you get offers in

1501
01:07:10,931 --> 01:07:13,280
trouble.
I'm sure he was a cop,

1502
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:14,770
right?
I was just looking right now,

1503
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,880
two days ago,
accomplished.

1504
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:18,130
Charged in this incident in the Eric
Garner,

1505
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:20,080
a woman,
so it's not the one that put him in a

1506
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:24,000
choke hold.
I mean we could be one of the ones

1507
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:25,480
that's in charge of the people that did
it.

1508
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:26,650
So I'm looking right now though.

1509
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,540
That's what happens when you're a
leader,

1510
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:29,380
right?
You.

1511
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,660
That's again,
like the club owner and the open miker

1512
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,600
magic.
If you're a sergeant and you're a rookie

1513
01:07:34,601 --> 01:07:36,670
out there,
choke some guy to death and you get in

1514
01:07:36,671 --> 01:07:38,020
trouble and you get kicked off the
force,

1515
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:40,960
you lose your cushy job.
She's charged right now with failure to

1516
01:07:40,961 --> 01:07:45,790
supervise an internal charge him that
God would failure to supervise.

1517
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:47,860
How the fuck is she supposed to
supervise?

1518
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:50,110
Like these guys choking this guy on the
street?

1519
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:52,270
Who would it?
What is she supposed to do?

1520
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,930
It's like the losses on the coach is
your forearm under his chin?

1521
01:07:55,931 --> 01:07:59,020
Yes or no?
Stop.

1522
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:01,780
Let me check your technique.
What is she supposed to?

1523
01:08:01,781 --> 01:08:06,280
New York and there was cops.
I remember passing by this cops talking

1524
01:08:06,281 --> 01:08:08,980
to each other.
One was gone and that's not a choke to

1525
01:08:08,981 --> 01:08:10,150
fucking show.
Not a choke.

1526
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,110
Let me put you in.
Got It.

1527
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,120
And in a.
In a hold on his neck.

1528
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,860
Let me put you in it.
No,

1529
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:17,390
thanks.
I'll choke the shit out of somebody.

1530
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:19,690
Anybody tells me that's not a chuck.
Let me hold you in like that.

1531
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,680
Well,
what qualifications?

1532
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,640
You have to be able to say what a choke
is.

1533
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:23,570
Me?
Yeah.

1534
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:24,680
Oh,
I've got a couple of things.

1535
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,860
Would you definitely be called an
expert?

1536
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:30,740
I said it on twitter.
I said as a martial arts expert,

1537
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,290
I even said that it's a professional
martial arts expert.

1538
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:35,270
I'll tell you very clearly.
That's a joke.

1539
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,580
I will choke the fucking life out of you
with that.

1540
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:41,990
If I have your head in between my arms,
forget me.

1541
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:43,790
Okay.
How about Eddie Bravo?

1542
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,910
Listen to me,
if Eddie Bravo has your neck and it's

1543
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:49,850
trapped in between his arms,
you're going to sleep,

1544
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:51,290
you're just going to sleep.

1545
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:54,680
That's a choke.
If he's got your neck like they had eric

1546
01:08:54,681 --> 01:08:56,000
gardener,
you're going to sleep.

1547
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,030
If Jake she look at this.
Come on man.

1548
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:01,670
That guy has his finger tucked under his
wrist,

1549
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:04,310
the hand in the back.
He's just got a shitty choke.

1550
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:05,990
He's got it.
Doesn't have the proper technique for

1551
01:09:05,991 --> 01:09:07,040
sure.
Right,

1552
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:08,840
and the other guys hold.
He's.

1553
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,360
He's definitely underneath the guy's
Chin though,

1554
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:14,420
but this is just a freeze frame.
That might've been like a brief

1555
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:17,330
millisecond of of struggle,
you know,

1556
01:09:17,331 --> 01:09:20,900
where he was pushing down with his left
arm and up with is right.

1557
01:09:20,901 --> 01:09:22,940
Because if you look at his right arm in
this position,

1558
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:25,820
that right arm is just an under hook.
That's not putting any pressure on his

1559
01:09:25,821 --> 01:09:27,410
neck.
The only thing that's putting pressure

1560
01:09:27,411 --> 01:09:29,450
on the neck is the left arm.
It's under the chin,

1561
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,190
but there's definitely some space.

1562
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,610
There's definitely some space between
you because it's not under his chin.

1563
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:36,290
You see where his chin is like,
look at.

1564
01:09:36,291 --> 01:09:37,280
Make it bigger,
real quick,

1565
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:39,350
make it bigger.
But this is just one picture.

1566
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,910
If you see where his chin,
his back,

1567
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:43,610
what happened?
Go into your twitter.

1568
01:09:43,611 --> 01:09:47,150
How dare you?
Oh um,

1569
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:52,690
but I saw an image where they were like
on the ground.

1570
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:54,230
Oh really?
Yeah.

1571
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:58,670
I saw a different image.
There it is.

1572
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:59,870
See that's.
Oh,

1573
01:09:59,871 --> 01:10:02,150
for sure.
That's always got under the neck.

1574
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:07,330
That's a fucking 100 percent choke.
Choke you to death with one arm like

1575
01:10:07,491 --> 01:10:08,450
that.
If you let me,

1576
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,860
if you let me get under your Chin like
that.

1577
01:10:09,861 --> 01:10:11,540
Like this guy's letting them.
He's not,

1578
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,330
he's not resisting.
He's being what I mean he's letting him

1579
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:17,270
and he's in a position where you can't
do anything about it,

1580
01:10:17,271 --> 01:10:18,080
I should say.

1581
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:22,640
Even if it doesn't halt,
let's say nothing happened to him.

1582
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,553
You know,
he's not,

1583
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:25,310
he's not defending it,
you know,

1584
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,160
he's not defending it.
It's 100 percent of that guys might,

1585
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:30,560
the left guy,
he's an aside choke position.

1586
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:35,340
So he's pushing down with his left
shoulder as well as pulling up with his

1587
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,210
left hand.
And if he puts his left hand on his,

1588
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:42,860
on the Guy Eric Gardener shoulder,
he uses that as leverage like guys took.

1589
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:45,980
Luke rockhold tapped out.
Michael Bisping with one arm.

1590
01:10:45,981 --> 01:10:49,160
Get the okay from the mount position.
That's a powerful move.

1591
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,070
Mean this.
It's not exactly this move here,

1592
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,100
but it's very similar in regards to how
much pressure you can put down what your

1593
01:10:55,101 --> 01:10:57,200
shoulder and how much you can pull up
with your,

1594
01:10:57,201 --> 01:10:59,030
with your arm.
That's a fucking choke.

1595
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,420
Choked the shit out of you.
With that.

1596
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:04,250
Somebody gets you into like Marcello
Garcia.

1597
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,180
How about Jocko?
Ray?

1598
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:07,740
Chakra ray gets a hold of you like that.
Yeah,

1599
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:10,760
that's a fucking choke.
You're going to go to sleep and he's not

1600
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,830
the best in the world.
Okay?

1601
01:11:12,831 --> 01:11:13,980
Don't get me wrong.
It's

1602
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,100
not like the perfect choke.
The perfect joke is,

1603
01:11:17,101 --> 01:11:20,640
you know like a Marcello Garcia rear
naked choke where the technique is just

1604
01:11:20,641 --> 01:11:24,610
so laser sharp.
There's a laser.

1605
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:27,470
Laser's might not even be sharp.
Like in Star Wars,

1606
01:11:27,471 --> 01:11:32,471
they're not sharp.
Really need to watch this guy die.

1607
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:39,490
They're fucking with them.
Will tell you that.

1608
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:45,990
He's like,
I didn't sell anything.

1609
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,510
He didn't even have loose cigarettes on
them when they arrested him.

1610
01:11:48,511 --> 01:11:49,710
Did you know that?
No.

1611
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,360
Nope.
Didn't have them.

1612
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:03,970
You can tell you Sydney
forcibly trying to lock somebody up for

1613
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:09,800
breaking up a fight.
So yeah,

1614
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:14,820
he broke up a fight.
The

1615
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:25,600
world needs is a mediator.
What do you mean stop?

1616
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:30,620
Let's press a button on our APP.
We have a life mediator show up who's

1617
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:34,870
like a really cool dude like the rock.
Like I feel like you're the rock could

1618
01:12:34,871 --> 01:12:38,290
have kept that guy alive.
He got there in between the coupler

1619
01:12:38,410 --> 01:12:39,241
boys,
boys,

1620
01:12:39,241 --> 01:12:41,640
boys relaxed here.
Let's talk this through.

1621
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:46,710
Let's be rational.
Man will regret it in the morning.

1622
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,600
He'd only have like some motivational
shit.

1623
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:51,120
Maybe take them to the gym.
Everybody does some squats.

1624
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:53,760
There's had a show.
I think we all did.

1625
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:56,130
I think it was where the guy was getting
kicked out and they were like,

1626
01:12:56,131 --> 01:12:58,730
he wouldn't leave.
So they call the cops and like you gotta

1627
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,970
get Outta here.
They're gonna arrest.

1628
01:12:59,971 --> 01:13:01,590
You just leave.
Oh yeah.

1629
01:13:01,591 --> 01:13:03,870
That video made a video of remember.
Oh,

1630
01:13:03,871 --> 01:13:05,160
I don't really.
Yeah,

1631
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:06,930
there was a video of it.
It's not going to rape you.

1632
01:13:06,931 --> 01:13:07,890
You're small.
They're going to rape.

1633
01:13:07,891 --> 01:13:11,070
You just go.
So you don't get raped in prison.

1634
01:13:11,071 --> 01:13:15,150
You have to go.
I'm pretty sure red band got a video of

1635
01:13:15,151 --> 01:13:15,930
it.
Oh really?

1636
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:18,060
Yeah.
I think he got rid of a video of it and

1637
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:20,640
then maybe a video of the guy getting
arrested later.

1638
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:21,990
Oh yeah.
He wouldn't go.

1639
01:13:21,991 --> 01:13:23,490
He was settled in.
Yeah.

1640
01:13:23,491 --> 01:13:24,360
You never know man.

1641
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:33,080
God damage if your life is good.
Life is good.

1642
01:13:33,541 --> 01:13:38,541
But I needed a tank show already landed.
What did he talk about?

1643
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:40,740
He talked about.
He told two stories.

1644
01:13:40,741 --> 01:13:43,070
So one's gone.
Just what's going on.

1645
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:44,490
TV They talked about,
um,

1646
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:47,790
when he was on mad TV doing a bunch of
blood while they was supposed to be

1647
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:48,624
working.
And

1648
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:54,930
this is the only life where you can talk
about things like that and just casually

1649
01:13:55,740 --> 01:13:57,430
and it seems funny.
Yeah.

1650
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:01,050
Whereas if he was an insurance salesman
and he was talking to the people,

1651
01:14:01,051 --> 01:14:05,760
it is counting on talking about your
cocaine by the way.

1652
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:07,980
New Episodes,
February 23rd on comedy central.

1653
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,830
Oh,
season two is he,

1654
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:16,290
it season this season dose
should say that year.

1655
01:14:18,461 --> 01:14:20,490
Um,
but I,

1656
01:14:20,491 --> 01:14:24,970
I like what you're doing.
Like overall I like what you're doing

1657
01:14:24,971 --> 01:14:28,180
with your life.
I like how you go on these nutty trips.

1658
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:30,370
You just take a month and just go
somewhere.

1659
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:35,380
He went to Thailand for awhile like you
do and what it's like you talk to your

1660
01:14:35,381 --> 01:14:37,740
average stoner who,
uh,

1661
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,120
is a brokester and it's just barely
getting by man.

1662
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:41,830
If I had fucking money note I do,
Dude.

1663
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,630
I wouldn't even be worried about shit
man.

1664
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:46,660
I just fucking leave my phone behind.
I go to Thailand for a month.

1665
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:48,910
I don't give a fuck.
I tell my agents suck my dick.

1666
01:14:48,911 --> 01:14:51,450
I'll be back in 30 days until then.
Dale.

1667
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:54,610
We have meetings but we have.
Fuck you.

1668
01:14:54,611 --> 01:14:56,740
I'm going to Thailand.
Just bring your laptop.

1669
01:14:56,741 --> 01:14:59,080
Fuck you.
So you just decided,

1670
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:02,400
you just decided I had to go to Atlanta
first issue some to Thailand.

1671
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:05,140
So I mailed my phone back to my home.
Yeah.

1672
01:15:05,141 --> 01:15:06,430
Do the one gun.
The plant?

1673
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:08,140
Yeah.
I don't want that.

1674
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:09,190
That's how you're supposed to do it.

1675
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:10,540
Yeah,
it was so much fun.

1676
01:15:10,690 --> 01:15:12,460
Now you're doing it exactly the right
way.

1677
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,570
Find some shit in a new country.
Some crazy noodles.

1678
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:18,820
Yeah.
Experienced some weirdness.

1679
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:21,370
They sell so much Viagra on the streets
of Bangkok.

1680
01:15:21,371 --> 01:15:24,940
Thank God is everywhere.
They just look at you.

1681
01:15:24,941 --> 01:15:26,720
I looked back up,
I got.

1682
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,720
First of all,
this is like Viagra.

1683
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,660
It's such clearly a knockoff.
Does it work?

1684
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:33,970
I don't know.
I wasn't going to try it because they

1685
01:15:33,971 --> 01:15:36,040
weren't discounted to like a dollar a
pill.

1686
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:37,840
There was like,
there were like half as much as they

1687
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:41,020
would have cost and like a store here
and that was offensive to you.

1688
01:15:41,021 --> 01:15:42,010
Look at your face.
You're like,

1689
01:15:42,011 --> 01:15:43,790
excuse me,
we're a third world country.

1690
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:46,720
My money.
There are children working right now and

1691
01:15:46,721 --> 01:15:49,960
it's 3:00 AM and that's guys six.
And He tried to sell me shit.

1692
01:15:49,961 --> 01:15:52,480
So I think the places should reflect
that.

1693
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:55,840
Yeah.
You don't need a lot of money to get by

1694
01:15:55,841 --> 01:15:56,680
and Thailand,
right?

1695
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:58,300
Oh No.
Once you're there,

1696
01:15:58,301 --> 01:16:02,440
you're good.
And it's doing everything safe.

1697
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,770
Thailand's a little more dangerous.
China,

1698
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:06,970
super safe.
Thailand you can get.

1699
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:10,240
You can get fucked with a little bit,
but it's relatively safe.

1700
01:16:10,241 --> 01:16:13,060
It ain't like any worse than here.
Really.

1701
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:14,920
The only thing I gotta worry about a
little bit.

1702
01:16:14,921 --> 01:16:16,960
It's cops more.
Oh really?

1703
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:17,890
Thailand?
Yeah.

1704
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:21,400
They probably know more.
Tie you up maybe,

1705
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,380
but yeah,
I walked around the streets and shit.

1706
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:25,120
Even the small players in the big
places.

1707
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:26,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

1708
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:30,190
I didn't really feel any danger.
Did you go to Moitai fights?

1709
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:32,510
I went to Thai kickboxing fights.
Yeah.

1710
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:36,140
Our hair and our hair.
All right.

1711
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:38,800
They just play this fucking thing the
whole time.

1712
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:42,550
Yeah.
It's annoying sound and they each have a

1713
01:16:42,551 --> 01:16:44,520
dance of their own.
Like Sensei,

1714
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,690
they have to do this special dance.
Have their own Dojo.

1715
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:47,561
Well,
it's called.

1716
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:50,150
I think it's called the white crew.
I think that's how they.

1717
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:52,960
How they spell it wrong.
Yeah,

1718
01:16:52,961 --> 01:16:55,150
it's pretty dope.
They have.

1719
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:56,980
Okay,
so you just walked down this like you

1720
01:16:56,981 --> 01:16:59,130
explain what that is.
What the whole.

1721
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:01,000
The whole little dance because people
are like,

1722
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:04,000
what the fuck are they talking about?
They have to do this.

1723
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:07,690
They introduced each person and then as
they're both in there.

1724
01:17:07,691 --> 01:17:08,860
I think that you together

1725
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,660
maybe one at a time,
I'm not really sure.

1726
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:15,680
They just do this act out dance where
they just sort of like kick a knee up

1727
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:21,020
and then do like a fake clench
kick and stuff,

1728
01:17:21,021 --> 01:17:23,030
but just by themselves,
not at anybody.

1729
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:25,970
And then they do that for a while.
They go all the way down to like one

1730
01:17:25,971 --> 01:17:26,804
knee,
but

1731
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:30,620
at the same time,
these are the hardcore guys.

1732
01:17:30,621 --> 01:17:31,970
They're doing a lot more of these
matches.

1733
01:17:31,971 --> 01:17:34,220
You see.
See this guy's wraps on their hands.

1734
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:36,200
They're going to fight bare knuckle.
See,

1735
01:17:36,201 --> 01:17:38,240
this is a,
it's not totally bare knuckle.

1736
01:17:38,241 --> 01:17:40,400
You have wraps,
but they're not going to wear gloves and

1737
01:17:40,401 --> 01:17:43,310
there's quite a few fights they're
taking place where guys are fighting

1738
01:17:43,311 --> 01:17:44,144
like this.
Now.

1739
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:48,380
I'm wondering if it's an impact of a mma
be more popular.

1740
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:49,970
Oh really?
Yeah,

1741
01:17:49,971 --> 01:17:54,610
because once I saw how these boxing
gloves on because this guy following

1742
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:58,100
instagram sand shy,
he's a bad motherfucker and he um,

1743
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:03,340
he just fought the other night with
those gloves on were wraps rather no

1744
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:04,454
gloves.

1745
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:05,211
And I was like,
wow,

1746
01:18:05,211 --> 01:18:09,800
he's doing those fights like the top,
some of the top Thai guys are doing

1747
01:18:09,801 --> 01:18:12,980
these fights wrapped around their head.
It's just sort of like,

1748
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:15,140
this is all ceremonial right now.
Well it's so,

1749
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:17,390
it's not just a spin things with their
hands.

1750
01:18:17,391 --> 01:18:18,800
No,
it's also a warmup.

1751
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:21,700
See when you watch what he's doing here,
when he bends his knee down and picks

1752
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:23,750
his foot up,
he's stretching his hips,

1753
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:28,040
he's stretching.
I'm like all the muscles around his

1754
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:31,610
upper leg.
It's to make it more loose for kicking

1755
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:33,320
a.
So He's loosening up.

1756
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:36,560
See all the power in your kick comes
from weight,

1757
01:18:36,561 --> 01:18:40,040
but it comes from your hips.
A lot of it is the swinging of the hips

1758
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:41,900
and the engaging of the hips when you
throw kicks.

1759
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:45,140
So what he's doing is like,
it's conducive to warming up that area

1760
01:18:45,141 --> 01:18:47,270
where you were going to light someone's
legs up.

1761
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:49,640
They're both doing it.
See how they're doing it.

1762
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:53,300
It's a warmup to warm up for their own
rights.

1763
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:56,270
But it's also spiritual.
You have to have these,

1764
01:18:56,271 --> 01:18:58,040
uh,
so you're walking down the street and

1765
01:18:58,041 --> 01:19:01,100
you see an alley.
And you just go down the alley and

1766
01:19:01,101 --> 01:19:04,760
there's just a ring in the middle of it,
maybe a pool table and like for like

1767
01:19:04,761 --> 01:19:06,820
makeshift bars around it,
there's like,

1768
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:08,900
like,
like it almost looks like a lemonade

1769
01:19:08,901 --> 01:19:11,030
stand at the Rose Bowl,
swap meet,

1770
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,760
you know,
and then you just get booze.

1771
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:16,640
Some people come around taking bets,
like who do you want?

1772
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,380
Why?
Then if you pick the right guy,

1773
01:19:18,381 --> 01:19:21,020
you can get whatever you want and
they'll just pay it off.

1774
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,020
It is a beautiful art.
Yeah.

1775
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:26,240
I love Moitai.
It's beautiful.

1776
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:28,640
But it seemed like that he was doing one
legged squats.

1777
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:31,110
And when you're doing that,
you're just trying to catch them up.

1778
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:34,640
Yeah.
He's just trying to warm up his hips and

1779
01:19:34,641 --> 01:19:36,920
they're right next to each other too.
And they're about to beat the fuck out

1780
01:19:36,921 --> 01:19:38,420
of each other.
It's so weird.

1781
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:39,890
They're all real respectful.
Yeah.

1782
01:19:39,891 --> 01:19:41,780
I didn't see any.
So I went to a couple of different ones

1783
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:45,460
that he's weird promoters.
This is just back alley things.

1784
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,450
Then they just get like 50 people to
show up.

1785
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:48,340
Well they,
they,

1786
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:51,380
they are the same way though.
Even when they're world champions,

1787
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:52,610
really,
really interesting.

1788
01:19:52,611 --> 01:19:54,940
Yeah.
I've seen world championship fights with

1789
01:19:54,941 --> 01:19:57,950
the two fighters get,
but I've also seen animosity.

1790
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:01,970
I watched his fight in La were bookout
was fighting this guy and blue cow,

1791
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:07,250
I think his name was par permit.
It's like their name,

1792
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:12,400
the part of their name is what their gym
that they're fighting out of,

1793
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,010
but I think is his actual name is bull
cow.

1794
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,740
I think I.
I'm not sure either way.

1795
01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:20,190
He's a bad motherfucker like a world
champion.

1796
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:24,450
World class tie fighter.
And he fought this dude who was really

1797
01:20:24,451 --> 01:20:29,130
disrespectful to him.
So he did this like very violent and

1798
01:20:29,131 --> 01:20:32,390
aggressive dance towards him.
Really?

1799
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:33,450
Yeah.
It was very different.

1800
01:20:33,451 --> 01:20:35,130
It's very different than I'd ever seen
before.

1801
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:39,540
Or He'd like launched arrows,
Adam and shit and like had all this

1802
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:42,150
choreographed,
but it was like directed towards this

1803
01:20:42,151 --> 01:20:44,610
guy.
Then they fought and he fucked him up.

1804
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,220
He lit him up.
He shut the arrows out of and also

1805
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:48,090
fucked them up.
Well,

1806
01:20:48,091 --> 01:20:50,280
he fake shot the arrows during his
dance,

1807
01:20:50,281 --> 01:20:52,740
but when they thought he fucked up,
he was like,

1808
01:20:52,741 --> 01:20:55,450
I felt the trash he.
Well blue cows on.

1809
01:20:55,530 --> 01:21:00,090
He's on a very high level as a tie
fighter and there's a lot of fighters

1810
01:21:00,091 --> 01:21:05,091
who were maybe aggressive and athletic
and they hit really hard and they

1811
01:21:05,191 --> 01:21:08,900
overestimate their ability and they just
think they're a bad motherfucker.

1812
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:12,330
They've knocked a bunch of guys out cow,
they're going to knock this mother

1813
01:21:12,331 --> 01:21:14,370
fucker out too.
Like people have this idea in their

1814
01:21:14,371 --> 01:21:16,440
head,
but you get in there with that guy and

1815
01:21:16,441 --> 01:21:17,820
you realize like,
oh,

1816
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:18,720
okay,
this.

1817
01:21:18,721 --> 01:21:22,590
I can't even hit him and he's.
Every time I move he's killing my legs.

1818
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:25,980
Every time I come close to him,
his knee is getting burned into my rib

1819
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:27,840
cage.
He's elbowing me in the head on the

1820
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:30,480
brake and then smiling at me and doing
it all over again.

1821
01:21:30,481 --> 01:21:32,970
He's going to keep doing it.
Your body's gonna start breaking down

1822
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,520
and that's what happened.
He just started beating the fuck out of

1823
01:21:35,521 --> 01:21:37,260
this dude.
Like those guys were getting a little

1824
01:21:37,261 --> 01:21:38,110
aggressive there.
Yeah,

1825
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:39,730
it was.
He got in the way of,

1826
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:41,880
this is what lasts way longer than
anything I saw.

1827
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,680
These guys love each other.
I think.

1828
01:21:43,740 --> 01:21:46,440
I think they're gonna start making out.
I think Jamie just tricked us into

1829
01:21:46,441 --> 01:21:49,860
watching some gay porn that's gonna
start off.

1830
01:21:49,861 --> 01:21:53,400
That's why I didn't have gloves on each
other with those things.

1831
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,141
So,
um,

1832
01:21:58,141 --> 01:22:02,550
but yeah,
like I saw probably 10 fights the first

1833
01:22:02,551 --> 01:22:05,820
time.
And then in Chiang Mai I probably saw

1834
01:22:05,821 --> 01:22:09,150
another.
I saw another probably seven,

1835
01:22:09,151 --> 01:22:12,090
eight fights.
What was the fight where you and Duncan

1836
01:22:12,091 --> 01:22:15,420
were in the crowd at the UFC and you
timed it perfectly.

1837
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:20,020
Don't know.
Fighting Nate Marquardt and Brad Tavarez

1838
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,570
Powell from memory.
I remember that.

1839
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:25,560
My wife was telling me some shit
yesterday.

1840
01:22:25,561 --> 01:22:26,550
I'm like,
you never said that.

1841
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:29,010
Meanwhile she totally talked for like 10
minutes about it.

1842
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:32,820
Really put nate Marquardt versus breadth
devops in the memory banks.

1843
01:22:32,821 --> 01:22:33,930
There's this,
that's it.

1844
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,580
Nate Marquardt,
Brad Tavarez,

1845
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,850
and then we're sending that.
They get close and when the camera came

1846
01:22:38,851 --> 01:22:42,250
to them they made out like a frosted
dying,

1847
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:44,970
dying dare you.
How dare you.

1848
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:50,610
So we're starting to throw it.
We started throwing a Illuminati signs

1849
01:22:50,611 --> 01:22:54,420
up for Illuminati side.
We made a big one with my whole forearm

1850
01:22:54,421 --> 01:22:58,530
and his forearm and his both giant
triangles and then he goes at some point

1851
01:22:58,531 --> 01:23:02,130
in buckets like we kept taking it up a
notch at some point that just leads to

1852
01:23:02,131 --> 01:23:02,970
me and he goes,
you know,

1853
01:23:02,971 --> 01:23:05,860
we got a kiss right
mother

1854
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,760
fucker
here.

1855
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:13,090
Right?
So I'm watching a fight and Duncan

1856
01:23:13,091 --> 01:23:15,280
staring at the monitor the whole time,
just staring,

1857
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:17,440
waiting for it to come on us.
And then at some point she goes,

1858
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:22,150
now I just had to turn and start making
out and we got to be careful about that

1859
01:23:22,151 --> 01:23:24,460
folks,
but get me in trouble.

1860
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:25,890
Oh,
I know the.

1861
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:28,360
He didn't even care.
They thought it was funny to interrupt

1862
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:30,040
me.
The next day is an animal.

1863
01:23:30,041 --> 01:23:31,470
He doesn't give a fuck.
I didn't know.

1864
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,240
Met Me.
He goes,

1865
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,720
you to acquit the social media stars.

1866
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:34,703
Morning,

1867
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:40,180
get in a bad thing.
It's funny you didn't do anything wrong,

1868
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:45,200
but Dana is a regular person for having
a guy who's the president of,

1869
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,100
Oh my God,
so stupid.

1870
01:23:56,850 --> 01:23:58,600
We're children.
We're at 40 Ortiz.

1871
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,900
Fuck is wrong with me.
Other people,

1872
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:03,610
he thinks legit thing that he's in the
Illuminati

1873
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:09,640
sign worshiper because I went to that a
performance that he did at that guy's

1874
01:24:09,641 --> 01:24:14,641
funeral or a funeral funeral.
This is where my mind was already out of

1875
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:17,470
the wedding fund.
Remember someone's wedding?

1876
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,630
It was one of the levators Anton Anton
Mulvey's.

1877
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:24,450
We went to that doctor.
He performed it at one of his like for

1878
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,530
birthday parties of the dead
grandfather.

1879
01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:28,660
Oh really?
How to show that wasn't there for that

1880
01:24:28,661 --> 01:24:30,930
one,
but dunking Hobo.

1881
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:31,930
Yeah,
it was.

1882
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:36,850
It was so bizarre.
It was just so strange that I ran into a

1883
01:24:36,851 --> 01:24:38,680
bunch of people I knew there to.
Really?

1884
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:39,550
Yeah.
Oh,

1885
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,110
you guys are quite the sickness.
So.

1886
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:46,060
Well they weren't really satanist,
like thought of him was hired so day

1887
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:48,490
Foley's wife at the time.
Oh yeah.

1888
01:24:48,491 --> 01:24:49,151
I was like,
Oh hey,

1889
01:24:49,151 --> 01:24:49,984
what's up?

1890
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:52,500
She was there.
It was a bunch of people who didn't.

1891
01:24:52,501 --> 01:24:55,090
We run into some other comics there too.
I wasn't at the wedding.

1892
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:57,520
He didn't go to their wedding.
It was just me and Duncan and joey.

1893
01:24:57,910 --> 01:24:59,350
Joey went.
He probably went to.

1894
01:24:59,410 --> 01:24:59,921
Yeah,
we were like,

1895
01:24:59,921 --> 01:25:02,800
what the fuck is this?
Wasn't some party,

1896
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,510
wasn't necessarily.
It was a wedding.

1897
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:07,750
It was like six.
I don't know.

1898
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,600
Whatever.
I met a guy third was there too.

1899
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:11,720
That's.
Yeah.

1900
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:13,090
Oh,
that's cool.

1901
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:14,590
Yeah,
I didn't get to meet him.

1902
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:17,890
I like his music.
It's really crazy.

1903
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,920
Yeah.
And he was the country roots to.

1904
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:23,350
Oh deep.
He was awesome.

1905
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:26,200
And that was wild and wonderful whites
of West Virginia.

1906
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:28,330
It was a good movie.
Holy Bread.

1907
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:30,040
Next.
Oh my God.

1908
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,510
But he was great in it too,
you know,

1909
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:35,560
I can.
He's like helping narrate it and talk to

1910
01:25:35,561 --> 01:25:37,150
the uh,
the JESCO,

1911
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:40,210
the dancing outlaw.
Watch a fucking awesome,

1912
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:41,890
awesome.
Strange people.

1913
01:25:42,460 --> 01:25:43,780
They run shit too.
Huh?

1914
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:45,160
Well,
sort of.

1915
01:25:45,161 --> 01:25:48,670
I mean they're only getting arrested for
the boys.

1916
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:54,390
They're the real duke.
The Duke Boys are supposed to be like

1917
01:25:54,641 --> 01:25:57,580
these heart of gold moonshiners don't
want to fuck their cousin.

1918
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,110
I'm not buying it.
I would be like,

1919
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:04,070
really?
Look at this bitch.

1920
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,840
She's nobody's fucking daisy.
Okay.

1921
01:26:05,841 --> 01:26:08,870
She can't get a goddamn boyfriend.
She's running around because she likes

1922
01:26:08,871 --> 01:26:10,280
she us.
She likes cletus.

1923
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:13,190
She could.
She make it more obvious that she's cut

1924
01:26:13,191 --> 01:26:16,010
the legs off or shorts.
You could just finger her swing.

1925
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,670
She's there for you.
She's letting me know she's hacking in

1926
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:23,390
shorts like no girl ever,
ever done that ever.

1927
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:27,140
Even now it's like God damn.
And she was doing it when no one was

1928
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:30,170
doing it and she was wearing a men's
shirts like she just got done.

1929
01:26:30,171 --> 01:26:33,890
Fucking touch a man's shirt on like your
shirt.

1930
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:37,160
She could be wearing your shirt down to
the fifth button.

1931
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:39,180
Tied off on the bottom.
Ted,

1932
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,600
come on son.
She's got a man's shirt on.

1933
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:45,380
Why is that super hot girl?
Have almost no man.

1934
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:49,650
That ain't number one.
Bonus number two bolts here.

1935
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:50,870
You.
You don't even know your history.

1936
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:53,140
So we're the number two bolts,
right?

1937
01:26:53,190 --> 01:26:54,023
Right,
right.

1938
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:57,290
That's him and it's been a while.
Tom Wolf Pac man,

1939
01:26:57,291 --> 01:27:01,480
that hair.
Those are the number two's no,

1940
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:04,480
these are still people go god,
look at those shorts.

1941
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:05,960
Christ.
She was hot pink.

1942
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:07,970
This makes me nervous.
Just looking at her.

1943
01:27:10,250 --> 01:27:12,140
You can see their fucking junk in their
pants.

1944
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:13,620
Yeah,
they're dicks was hard as rock.

1945
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:16,730
Oh my God.
And they're not even related to her

1946
01:27:17,010 --> 01:27:20,840
because not only does she have camel toe
on that she's got of the beginning of

1947
01:27:20,841 --> 01:27:22,110
one.
Just the beginning of badge.

1948
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:24,470
Outline everything.
You could see the slice.

1949
01:27:24,471 --> 01:27:25,304
Yeah.

1950
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,210
They had grandma panties back then.
Oh,

1951
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:32,630
guess who doesn't care me?
Are you a panties guy?

1952
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:37,850
What do you mean when you like.
I like when girls with dogs don't like

1953
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:39,910
granny panties.
I think my girlfriend,

1954
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,590
nothing.
Say it.

1955
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:46,910
Somebody got
constraining yourself.

1956
01:27:46,911 --> 01:27:50,990
So they were moonshiners with a heart of
gold but never got any pussy.

1957
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:54,680
And they were beautiful man.
Beautiful Man.

1958
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:56,840
And they're hot cousin.
It was a show where no one fucked.

1959
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:00,500
It was the most ridiculous world.
That was way more ridiculous in the fact

1960
01:28:00,501 --> 01:28:05,060
that they were shooting with lightening
with a dynamite at the end of it.

1961
01:28:05,061 --> 01:28:08,780
And they didn't have guns because they
did time for fucking running moonshine.

1962
01:28:08,781 --> 01:28:12,800
But the man should let them do what they
do down here in Hazard County.

1963
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,780
We got our own rules and that was
nobody.

1964
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:17,330
Nobody fucked.
Yeah.

1965
01:28:17,331 --> 01:28:20,510
You think fucking boss hog would have
had a slew of hookers.

1966
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:25,960
She should have all that show now in
reality like this is what it would be

1967
01:28:26,181 --> 01:28:26,601
like.
Well,

1968
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,940
let's think about her.
She was the only hot girl in the show

1969
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,030
ever.
Look who she should have two dudes,

1970
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:34,190
one of the grossest women of all time.
That's his wife.

1971
01:28:34,191 --> 01:28:36,650
How dare you.
How dare you.

1972
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:39,920
He would have been choosing a wonderful
woman in the greatest killer fucking or

1973
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:41,960
he would have been fucking her uncle
Jesse would've fucked.

1974
01:28:41,961 --> 01:28:43,700
Everybody was fucked up.
Cletus scooter,

1975
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,150
boss Hog definitely would've.
He would've had her on the payroll.

1976
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:50,270
She'd been riding right next to him.
That cadillac with the bull horns and

1977
01:28:50,271 --> 01:28:52,790
the front of it,
but she came on to the other guy.

1978
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,550
Oh,
he was always coming on as gay as fuck,

1979
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:58,910
and he was comfortable it because Jesus
was strong in his life.

1980
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:01,530
That's why cletus didn't want to admit
it.

1981
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,480
That's now.
That's them.

1982
01:29:03,481 --> 01:29:04,440
Now.
Show me now.

1983
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:05,930
Don't,
don't do it.

1984
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:08,910
Don't do it to meet Jamie should kill
this thing.

1985
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:10,550
You were watching television now.
Oh,

1986
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:11,680
look at her sitting up.

1987
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:17,700
Her legs were so hot.
Just ridiculously high watching just

1988
01:29:17,701 --> 01:29:20,070
watching TV now,
but here's what's crazy about that show.

1989
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:21,090
It was.
I mean,

1990
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,750
was there another girl on the show ever
besides like old ladies?

1991
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:28,180
Maybe she had a rule and the contract.
She could be the only hot one,

1992
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:29,500
like listen,
benches.

1993
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:32,490
I don't think there was ever another
really.

1994
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:34,890
I watched it.
If I was running the dukes of Hazzard,

1995
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:36,690
okay.
This is why I'm not an executive

1996
01:29:36,691 --> 01:29:38,970
producer.
The dukes of hazzard.

1997
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:40,170
I would say,
okay,

1998
01:29:40,171 --> 01:29:43,020
why do we only have one hot check?
You guys out of your fucking mind.

1999
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:44,780
We need a Baywatch.
This motherfucker.

2000
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:48,120
I know it turned into porn.
If you were running it through seasons,

2001
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:49,560
they be like,
let's just say,

2002
01:29:49,561 --> 01:29:53,790
hey bob,
it's a comedy folks.

2003
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:58,080
You should have more funny hot girls in
the background doing other shit.

2004
01:29:58,081 --> 01:30:01,590
Maybe run another alternative storylines
and you have a plot and a b plot.

2005
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:04,320
This is the problem with how they would.
As soon as you get some fucking he now

2006
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:05,820
you're like,
let's put some more hot women that

2007
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,960
Sitcom.
No,

2008
01:30:08,110 --> 01:30:08,371
no,
no,

2009
01:30:08,371 --> 01:30:09,570
no.
I'm trying to diversify.

2010
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:12,390
I'm thinking of Hot Indian woman.
That's what I'm thinking,

2011
01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:14,230
really hot Indian woman,
you always,

2012
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:17,370
you think you're going to get.
It's that close to happening and she

2013
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:21,930
showed me the smuggling shipment of
Jello and two of them have to.

2014
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,950
You have some sort of battle.
Let's just make sure that punches up

2015
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:28,200
when we write this together.
Yeah,

2016
01:30:28,201 --> 01:30:30,680
you don't want to be white.
Everyone will be at chop.

2017
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:34,890
We make fun of white men especially.
Let's punch up.

2018
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:38,850
Okay.
It's important or somebody recommends me

2019
01:30:38,851 --> 01:30:41,120
in a,
in an island in Thailand,

2020
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:43,680
said Eddie Bravo.
He takes Muay Thai class there.

2021
01:30:43,681 --> 01:30:45,210
Instead of the problem was going to
teach a seminar.

2022
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:46,570
Coast time we.

2023
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:48,690
He was going to teach us out.
He was like,

2024
01:30:48,691 --> 01:30:50,220
please tell Eddie Bravo.
Well,

2025
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:51,720
what are you have messenger for?
Improper?

2026
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:53,970
Why another motherfucker get on twitter
like everybody else?

2027
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:54,853
Oh yeah,
come on

2028
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:00,870
to the Internet.
How dare he try to use you?

2029
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:03,180
How about just say hello man?
He told me what?

2030
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:05,250
You have a task.
What am I a carrier pigeon.

2031
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:07,830
You Fuck?
What am I a raven?

2032
01:31:07,831 --> 01:31:11,460
You want to tie something to my ankle?
I go back home and teach me how to like

2033
01:31:11,461 --> 01:31:13,800
get the fucking kickup on my scooter.
I was like,

2034
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:14,670
how do you fucking.
He goes,

2035
01:31:14,730 --> 01:31:15,541
Ari Shapiro.
I'm like,

2036
01:31:15,541 --> 01:31:16,021
yeah.
Like,

2037
01:31:16,021 --> 01:31:17,520
hey,
how do you kick the scooter thing out?

2038
01:31:17,521 --> 01:31:19,140
And it goes here.
Let me show you until Eddie Bravo to

2039
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:21,150
come out here.
That would actually be really hot.

2040
01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:26,390
If you had a like a girl who was like a
super hot girl who would carry a message

2041
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:30,150
to you,
taped to her ankle and then became a

2042
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:33,450
service like a mess,
a messenger.

2043
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:34,950
How do you know how like,
um,

2044
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:39,980
maybe like you would hire someone to be
a clown at a birthday party or someone

2045
01:31:40,321 --> 01:31:43,980
to show up at your dance,
a show up at your office rather and do a

2046
01:31:43,981 --> 01:31:45,720
dance for you on your birthday.
You know,

2047
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:48,360
somebody's got you a dance.
Graham did have debt today.

2048
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:51,510
Instead of that,
you have hot girls show up like ravens

2049
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:56,570
with a note attached to their ankle and
they have to put their leg up on your

2050
01:31:56,701 --> 01:32:00,190
desk and untie the note and give it to
you in some weird

2051
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:05,270
sorta semis job situation.
And you read this little scroll that

2052
01:32:05,501 --> 01:32:10,160
someone had written out like old timey
back go away,

2053
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:13,840
but just kind of how you can you have a
immediate one of those wax seals at the

2054
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:15,310
stamp,
like absolute broken?

2055
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:18,030
Of course.
Absolutely.

2056
01:32:18,110 --> 01:32:19,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

2057
01:32:19,001 --> 01:32:23,260
A wax seal around her ankle.
Like just some maybe.

2058
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,240
Maybe a little hot wax got honor.
Oh,

2059
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:28,100
I love fail in this message.
That was the test.

2060
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:30,100
I like it.
I like being a little.

2061
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:35,660
Maybe not hurt me.
That would be a new service.

2062
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:39,460
How much would you pay?
$5 extra.

2063
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:41,440
Well,
what I'm thinking is probably more.

2064
01:32:41,441 --> 01:32:43,420
Let's just concentrate on ballers.
Let's just.

2065
01:32:43,450 --> 01:32:46,780
When we move into bel air and Beverly
Hills where all these fuckheads are

2066
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,940
driving million dollar cars and we just
start running to the forum,

2067
01:32:49,950 --> 01:32:53,590
Miss Yoga Slavia fucking uprising in our
country.

2068
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:54,550
Let's get crazy.

2069
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:58,120
Let's say each message cost it costs a
thousand dollars.

2070
01:32:58,121 --> 01:33:01,640
Should deliver a message in Los Angeles
in that style and that style.

2071
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:05,380
$1,000 plus tips.
But you've got to make sure that girls

2072
01:33:05,381 --> 01:33:08,360
don't become hookers.
He doesn't just become.

2073
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:13,450
I know you've already done it.
I have 30,000 more if you'll come on

2074
01:33:13,451 --> 01:33:16,900
into my castle.
How long have you been working for this

2075
01:33:16,901 --> 01:33:18,250
agency?
You have so much harder than all the

2076
01:33:18,251 --> 01:33:21,640
other girls who ever listen.
You don't need this shit.

2077
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:22,533
How?
Sit down.

2078
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:24,610
I'll call them.
Have a drink with me.

2079
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,610
Do you like music?
What kind of music you like?

2080
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:32,100
How about r Kelly?
Real talk.

2081
01:33:32,830 --> 01:33:34,210
Real talk.
Real talk,

2082
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:38,650
bitch.
I wish you would burn my motherfucking

2083
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:41,080
clothes.
We'll talk

2084
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:45,130
if you heard real talk.
I heard it a long time ago.

2085
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:48,010
Maybe the greatest song.
Humanity's ever done a whole video

2086
01:33:48,011 --> 01:33:49,660
series.
Everything amazing.

2087
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:50,680
Oh,
the trapped in the closet.

2088
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:53,270
You're thinking of the traps and closet?
Yeah.

2089
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:55,660
Traveling clause was pretty deep or a
real top was.

2090
01:33:55,661 --> 01:33:59,100
The other thing,
real talk was one song was one,

2091
01:33:59,130 --> 01:34:02,320
one song in one music video art Kelly,
so he went a little crazy too.

2092
01:34:02,321 --> 01:34:03,540
Then came back.
Keep.

2093
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:06,790
You
didn't do anything,

2094
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:08,740
man.
Nothing happened.

2095
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:14,050
Having to compete on a girl like girls
like 14 r Kelly is 40 more chapters of

2096
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:19,000
this isn't real.
No.

2097
01:34:19,210 --> 01:34:21,040
Oh my God.
That sounds like the onion.

2098
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:24,880
R Kelly has 40 more chapters of trapped
in the closet planned.

2099
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:27,070
He's amazing.
I hope it never dies.

2100
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,260
Wow.
I really hope he lives forever.

2101
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:33,210
He might be my favorite person.
We'll talk.

2102
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:35,290
There's a specific kind of crazy that's
famous.

2103
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:38,890
Crazy.
No one will ever tell you they'll be

2104
01:34:38,940 --> 01:34:40,210
this crazy.
Let's be honest.

2105
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,470
It's also a black,
famous,

2106
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:43,360
famous crazy.
Couldn't pull that off.

2107
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:46,000
A white guy.
I can't wear a clock around your neck

2108
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:50,350
and act like it's normal.
If you're black guys can pull off way

2109
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,570
more extravagant,
you know,

2110
01:34:52,571 --> 01:34:54,250
like,
this isn't racist.

2111
01:34:54,251 --> 01:34:55,930
I'm just being.
I'm just being real with you.

2112
01:34:55,940 --> 01:34:58,640
People says the guy with the sumo sword
on his desk,

2113
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:02,630
so when he gave it to my
fucking racist,

2114
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:04,880
how dare you?
Misappropriate culture.

2115
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:06,990
Oh my God,
you're a terrible person.

2116
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:10,040
I always knew you were racist.
You hide behind the fact that you're a

2117
01:35:10,041 --> 01:35:12,860
Jew.
I'm so persecuted.

2118
01:35:12,861 --> 01:35:16,570
Let me be racist.
Get the camera.

2119
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:18,050
Zoom.
Oh,

2120
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:20,160
the fat guy says,
Oh

2121
01:35:22,330 --> 01:35:24,980
God,
you changed the game and Sumos you

2122
01:35:24,981 --> 01:35:26,930
might've just made sumo.
Amazing.

2123
01:35:26,931 --> 01:35:29,270
Made irrelevant again.
The most amazing thing ever.

2124
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,550
Just watching guys go to war.
Okay,

2125
01:35:31,551 --> 01:35:33,980
how about that guys going to war?
Not Allowed to stamp through.

2126
01:35:33,981 --> 01:35:37,880
The body begins to come apart,
so guys would usually be covered with

2127
01:35:37,881 --> 01:35:39,880
scars.
All the fat will be pouring it.

2128
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:41,110
Get sliced.
Open

2129
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,510
shields.
No,

2130
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:45,590
fuck them.
No.

2131
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:49,880
The belly shield at least make it like
Dole swords.

2132
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:52,520
No swords.
How about like,

2133
01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:56,510
okay,
what if you were playing like with

2134
01:35:56,530 --> 01:35:57,850
lightsabers,
right?

2135
01:35:57,950 --> 01:36:01,640
But the light sabers just shocked you.
Oh,

2136
01:36:01,641 --> 01:36:03,830
but like a heavy,
like heavy shock.

2137
01:36:03,980 --> 01:36:05,360
Yeah,
like a Taser,

2138
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:08,000
right?
Like a Jason Ellis type shock.

2139
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:09,113
Yeah.
Yeah.

2140
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,820
Lightsabers.
Yeah.

2141
01:36:10,821 --> 01:36:12,770
Imagine if that was the sport.
Oh my God.

2142
01:36:12,771 --> 01:36:14,330
I might have just invented the perfect
sport.

2143
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:17,750
By the way.
Jason Ellis run with this.

2144
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:19,520
Yeah,
go for it dude.

2145
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:20,840
For Real.
I'll give it to you.

2146
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:21,590
Yeah,
go ahead.

2147
01:36:21,590 --> 01:36:24,830
I'll even help.
Do they have lightsaber tasers?

2148
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:25,693
They should.

2149
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:28,280
If they don't,
they're retarded dude.

2150
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:31,280
If I was a girl and a rapist came at me
and I had a taser,

2151
01:36:31,281 --> 01:36:32,031
I'd be like,
Oh fuck.

2152
01:36:32,031 --> 01:36:34,520
But if I had a taser lightsaber I'd be
like,

2153
01:36:34,521 --> 01:36:35,970
you're probably not going to continue
with this,

2154
01:36:35,971 --> 01:36:37,580
but you're fucked.
You're going to get outta here.

2155
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:39,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

2156
01:36:39,090 --> 01:36:42,710
Any one can touch you with something
like a lightsaber,

2157
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:44,240
like they might be able to.
Well,

2158
01:36:44,510 --> 01:36:47,450
depends on who you are.
Obviously if you're Steven Seagal,

2159
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,460
he'll figure it out.
He'd be able to block it,

2160
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:51,770
flip you.
You never touch him with any part of.

2161
01:36:51,771 --> 01:36:53,740
You touched it shocks you.
Yeah.

2162
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:55,760
You'd have to just touch their feet like
fake.

2163
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:57,710
You're going logo high,
fake.

2164
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:59,960
You're going high at all.
Any sort of block out.

2165
01:36:59,961 --> 01:37:00,770
It would be.
Well,

2166
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:03,560
anybody who knows fencing for sure you
would fuck you up.

2167
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:06,260
Like fencers would be the most dangerous
people ever on earth.

2168
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:09,380
Well imagine if you had one.
It was small and you could press a

2169
01:37:09,381 --> 01:37:12,120
button like you do with a lightsaber.
A rod extends.

2170
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:14,240
Yeah,
like a metal rod because they have those

2171
01:37:14,241 --> 01:37:19,241
things like those Bhutan's the press a
button and it becomes a steel Bhutanese

2172
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:20,541
Rod.
Yeah.

2173
01:37:20,541 --> 01:37:23,060
Dude,
why we 12?

2174
01:37:24,230 --> 01:37:26,570
What's wrong with us grown men,
we pay taxes.

2175
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:30,830
So you would press a button and it would
just become electrified.

2176
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:34,400
Yeah,
that totally seems like it would be a

2177
01:37:34,401 --> 01:37:35,810
real thing.
Wow.

2178
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:38,360
Yeah.
They probably have that in development,

2179
01:37:38,361 --> 01:37:39,560
right?
How did they not?

2180
01:37:39,561 --> 01:37:40,281
If they don't,
they do.

2181
01:37:40,281 --> 01:37:42,800
Now.
The Batman should have that.

2182
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:44,480
Fuck.
You should have that.

2183
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:47,780
Superman was still fucking him up.
That's why this movie stupid.

2184
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:51,400
I don't care what anybody says.
Who supermoon who would burden moon.

2185
01:37:51,430 --> 01:37:53,460
Just going to put crypt to modal
overlays.

2186
01:37:53,570 --> 01:37:57,660
Bodie into superman is going.
Go and make the world spin backwards so

2187
01:37:57,661 --> 01:38:02,280
that Batman doesn't get the fucking
Kryptonite suit dummy to make the world

2188
01:38:02,281 --> 01:38:03,300
spin backwards.

2189
01:38:03,480 --> 01:38:06,720
Only has to do is stay like 100 feet
away from Batman.

2190
01:38:06,810 --> 01:38:08,760
He could find that when I got the
Kryptonite just keeps spinning

2191
01:38:08,761 --> 01:38:09,960
backwards.
So it was like a month ago.

2192
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:14,940
He would just pick up cars and throw
them at Batman till he died to stop.

2193
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,140
Well,
he's not trying to kill him because he's

2194
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:18,510
all good,
but if he wanted to he could.

2195
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:20,490
Yeah.
That's the idea.

2196
01:38:20,491 --> 01:38:21,324
Right?
Everybody's.

2197
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:22,380
You don't get it,
bro.

2198
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:26,100
Batman always wins.
Listen,

2199
01:38:26,101 --> 01:38:27,330
bitch.
I met an evil.

2200
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:29,190
Listen Bitch.
Even if he's evil,

2201
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:32,370
the other guy's bulletproof.
Shut the fuck up.

2202
01:38:33,630 --> 01:38:35,810
He's an alien.
Did.

2203
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:39,960
Do you remember when we were saying
people just get angry right now?

2204
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:42,450
You don't even fucking understand comic
books.

2205
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:45,270
When I did an instagram post about that,
oh my God,

2206
01:38:45,271 --> 01:38:48,090
people were so mad at me.
Why are you taking the fear factor?

2207
01:38:48,091 --> 01:38:51,330
Go seriously?
Why are you taking me books?

2208
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,193
Yeah,
that's right there.

2209
01:38:52,210 --> 01:38:54,060
We don't know about the subject that you
just said.

2210
01:38:54,061 --> 01:38:59,061
I don't know about.
I barely barely know something about

2211
01:38:59,221 --> 01:39:04,110
comic books almost for Star Wars.
All the superhero movies were exactly

2212
01:39:04,111 --> 01:39:05,310
the same.
Yeah.

2213
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,680
They don't look good.
We got to pull power back.

2214
01:39:07,681 --> 01:39:10,950
We gotta you gotta check in.
We got to know a bunch of powers.

2215
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:13,670
The kid gets mad.
Other superheroes,

2216
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:16,050
like I'll help pull pulled over powers
back.

2217
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,690
Superhero fight.
It was like it was.

2218
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:23,430
It was more than one preview,
right in star wars was that same movie.

2219
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:26,280
The last avengers felt really stale.
Really?

2220
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:30,320
Yeah,
because I saw it right after the machine

2221
01:39:30,321 --> 01:39:31,600
or what is it?
X X,

2222
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:33,540
x,
x market,

2223
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:36,980
which was excellent.
If you haven't seen x Maki.

2224
01:39:36,981 --> 01:39:41,730
Now it's a movie about artificial
intelligence and it is beautiful.

2225
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:45,190
It is a perfect movie.
I wouldn't change a thing about that

2226
01:39:45,570 --> 01:39:47,190
movie was so good.

2227
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:49,390
The ending wasn't like boring and long.
No,

2228
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:50,620
no,
no,

2229
01:39:50,650 --> 01:39:51,690
no,
no.

2230
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:54,150
That movie was amazing.
That movie was like,

2231
01:39:54,151 --> 01:39:58,140
Whoa,
because the reality of these things have

2232
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:02,310
this artificial intelligence is guide
created was fucking feasible.

2233
01:40:02,370 --> 01:40:03,150
Really?
Yeah.

2234
01:40:03,150 --> 01:40:05,320
It was good.
It's really good though.

2235
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:07,350
The dramas good.
The whole thing is good.

2236
01:40:07,351 --> 01:40:10,830
It's just so good and then after that I
went to see the vendors.

2237
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:12,870
I was like,
this is so stupid.

2238
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,910
I'm like,
this movie is so dumb.

2239
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:19,860
It's just like I'm watching the Dukes of
hazzard take place with superheroes.

2240
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:21,660
It's just was like.
It didn't mean anything.

2241
01:40:21,730 --> 01:40:22,710
Yeah.
Like X,

2242
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:25,240
Mokena.
Everything meant something like the.

2243
01:40:25,330 --> 01:40:26,910
These people,
their interactions,

2244
01:40:26,911 --> 01:40:31,911
the other interactions felt we'll the.
There's some real palpable tension.

2245
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:37,940
There's a real danger that they're being
played by these artificial creatures

2246
01:40:38,221 --> 01:40:40,470
that they've created that look exactly
like people.

2247
01:40:40,471 --> 01:40:41,700
It's good,
man.

2248
01:40:41,701 --> 01:40:43,350
It's good.
That's why star wars to me,

2249
01:40:43,351 --> 01:40:44,030
it was like,
ah,

2250
01:40:44,030 --> 01:40:45,660
whatever.
I Love Star Wars.

2251
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:50,130
It was just like a b minus fun movie.
A plus a plus.

2252
01:40:50,131 --> 01:40:52,620
Not No real.
There's five stars.

2253
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,730
I'll 10 times.
I loved it.

2254
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:57,190
I did love it man.
I have,

2255
01:40:57,580 --> 01:41:00,040
I think almost exact opposite.
Tastes in movies.

2256
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:03,490
A lot of music to you,
like a Sucky,

2257
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,040
sucky selection of music.

2258
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:09,970
You like the chip rock that I like
about it?

2259
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:13,850
No,
no.

2260
01:41:15,170 --> 01:41:18,280
I like a little Noli.
She's got a beautiful voice.

2261
01:41:20,690 --> 01:41:21,570
Hey,

2262
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:23,620
when I mentioned to read and you were
like,

2263
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:25,630
hey,
who's the girl you were talking about?

2264
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:29,950
Dude,
I picked up Eddie Bravo once and this

2265
01:41:29,951 --> 01:41:34,840
girl that he was dating way back in the
day and I had Cheryl crow playing in my

2266
01:41:34,841 --> 01:41:35,674
truck.
Uh,

2267
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:37,420
and uh,
she's like,

2268
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:41,140
why are you playing this if it makes you
upset?

2269
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:43,090
I'm like,
this is mine.

2270
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,220
This is mine.
She goes,

2271
01:41:45,221 --> 01:41:45,791
no,
it's not.

2272
01:41:45,791 --> 01:41:46,231
I go,
yeah,

2273
01:41:46,231 --> 01:41:47,080
it's a CD.
I got it.

2274
01:41:47,081 --> 01:41:48,510
The CD.
It's like,

2275
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:50,050
no,
you do not listen to this music.

2276
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:51,100
I'm like,
but I do.

2277
01:41:51,190 --> 01:41:52,510
So I don't know where we're going with
this.

2278
01:41:55,210 --> 01:41:57,340
Never spoke to her again.
How rude.

2279
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:00,460
Rude.
Eddie Bravo.

2280
01:42:00,490 --> 01:42:02,860
Bringing these barbarians around.
Yeah.

2281
01:42:02,861 --> 01:42:05,040
You can't like chuck rock.
Otherwise there's some kind of a pussy.

2282
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:05,883
Yeah,
it's weird.

2283
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:10,090
I don't care.
I used to have my cds a alphabetized and

2284
01:42:10,091 --> 01:42:13,090
I would have them separated by cic
singers and male singers.

2285
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:17,410
Have you ever heard of Grace Potter and
the nocturnals heard of them?

2286
01:42:17,411 --> 01:42:20,400
Haven't listened to that girl's got.
Oh boy.

2287
01:42:20,410 --> 01:42:22,140
So you know about Alabama shakes,
right?

2288
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:24,250
No.
Oh,

2289
01:42:25,290 --> 01:42:29,080
well let's,
let's kiss one another.

2290
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:30,910
There is so much bigger,
but yeah,

2291
01:42:30,911 --> 01:42:31,744
that's great.
Spotter.

2292
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:33,120
Yeah,
they're pretty big now.

2293
01:42:33,190 --> 01:42:34,840
Yeah,
I think she's pretty big too.

2294
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:37,270
We don't know dude.
We're out of the loop.

2295
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:38,313
I know.
I know.

2296
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:39,300
Alabama shakes.
You've heard it.

2297
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:44,290
She didn't even have a phone.
You got some fucking 1980 Morris code

2298
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:46,580
thing in your pocket.
I didn't even get.

2299
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:48,370
It doesn't even vibrate when I get a
text.

2300
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:52,240
It's in my phone if my pocket.
I don't even know if people texted me

2301
01:42:52,270 --> 01:42:53,810
and then I was like,
where are you?

2302
01:42:53,811 --> 01:42:54,960
And it isn't like,
oh,

2303
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:55,813
I don't know.
It was walking.

2304
01:42:56,530 --> 01:42:58,540
Oh God.
That's hilarious.

2305
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:00,820
Yeah.
I got to only vibrate when it rings and

2306
01:43:00,821 --> 01:43:01,750
that's it.
Yeah.

2307
01:43:01,751 --> 01:43:05,170
I wouldn't only notification.
I went to a clusterfuck when my phone

2308
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:10,230
upgraded and went from text messaging to
sending messages and then I turned the I

2309
01:43:11,761 --> 01:43:13,840
message off,
but then people were still sending me

2310
01:43:13,841 --> 01:43:16,240
ims juice that was getting them on my
computer,

2311
01:43:16,241 --> 01:43:17,710
but I wasn't getting them on my phone.
I'm like,

2312
01:43:17,711 --> 01:43:21,730
this is so stupid.
Like this system is so goofy.

2313
01:43:22,330 --> 01:43:24,780
Like how do you opt out of this?
How do you just.

2314
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:27,760
I want everything in one place.
I don't need it going every.

2315
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:31,020
I don't need to be getting phone calls
on my fucking computer when I'm.

2316
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:35,100
When I put my phone over there,
I want to be able to get like the voice

2317
01:43:35,101 --> 01:43:38,170
mails later.
I don't want to see it on my computer

2318
01:43:38,171 --> 01:43:40,000
when I'm working,
so what do I have to do now?

2319
01:43:40,001 --> 01:43:43,150
I have to disable this and I've got.
Why is this set there by default?

2320
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:46,060
Why is my phone making my computer ring
by the fuck?

2321
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:48,720
Can I get some shit done?
God dammit.

2322
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:50,260
Ari Shaffir.
It's always infringing.

2323
01:43:50,261 --> 01:43:53,510
It's always infringing in your day.
Ken Did the ball.

2324
01:43:53,530 --> 01:43:55,040
Go check twitter.
It's been four minutes.

2325
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:57,620
Listen,
what if there's no response to ball?

2326
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:03,260
He'll resistances,
few tile independence,

2327
01:44:03,261 --> 01:44:04,850
which is my real thing.
I think it's getting better,

2328
01:44:04,851 --> 01:44:07,190
but I don't think we've developed an
etiquette around phones yet.

2329
01:44:07,220 --> 01:44:09,730
You say that until you have four legs.
Every girl wants

2330
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:14,780
to get that for less.
Girls don't even know why.

2331
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:19,840
Something about them for legs just looks
up.

2332
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:22,460
It didn't get way easier.

2333
01:44:22,700 --> 01:44:23,650
Jim.
I'll just say what about,

2334
01:44:23,651 --> 01:44:27,140
uh,
the twitter news of the weekend where

2335
01:44:27,141 --> 01:44:29,690
they might be changing some free
spirits,

2336
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:32,030
free speech,
stuff that pulled away verification

2337
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:32,660
from.

2338
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:35,120
Well,
they pull away Milo Yiannopoulos

2339
01:44:35,121 --> 01:44:39,530
verification for bold.
Is Verification Away why they said that?

2340
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:42,440
Well,
they don't say exactly violation of

2341
01:44:42,441 --> 01:44:44,720
terms of service.
So now he's no a verified.

2342
01:44:44,930 --> 01:44:47,120
Exactly.
But he's still allowed to post.

2343
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:49,470
So there's some posts are saying if it's
offensive or the,

2344
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:50,420
your account,
right?

2345
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:54,680
Well they did not see.
He's not being any more like here's a

2346
01:44:54,681 --> 01:44:57,590
problem with that guy and it's not a bad
problem.

2347
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:02,270
He's funny and a lot of what he's doing
is theater like.

2348
01:45:02,271 --> 01:45:05,270
And if he gets you riled up,
especially if he has a point.

2349
01:45:05,450 --> 01:45:08,000
And I think he has a point with a lot of
things he's picking on,

2350
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:09,080
you know,
he's not dumb.

2351
01:45:09,081 --> 01:45:14,081
He's very smart and so he's getting
people riled up like a professional

2352
01:45:14,631 --> 01:45:17,420
troll.
It was also a very bright guy who writes

2353
01:45:17,421 --> 01:45:19,690
some pretty good articles and I would
say really good art.

2354
01:45:19,690 --> 01:45:22,100
What is someone who writes for
Breitbart?

2355
01:45:22,101 --> 01:45:23,270
He's like,
he's hilarious.

2356
01:45:23,271 --> 01:45:27,440
He's a conservative writer.
He's a conservative,

2357
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:29,630
I guess a blogger,
I guess we'd call them.

2358
01:45:29,830 --> 01:45:31,730
You wouldn't say he's a journalist.
He's more of a,

2359
01:45:31,731 --> 01:45:32,790
you know,
he writes editorials,

2360
01:45:32,830 --> 01:45:34,460
writes just pieces.
Right.

2361
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:38,780
But he's also gay,
like gay as fuck and conservative and he

2362
01:45:38,781 --> 01:45:43,550
goes into debates with these feminists
and just crushes them with facts and

2363
01:45:43,551 --> 01:45:46,120
they can't attack him because he's gay.
He has the,

2364
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:50,840
he has the sketch down card,
he's got this weird loophole and he

2365
01:45:50,841 --> 01:45:52,640
knows what the fuck he's talking about.
Yeah.

2366
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:54,710
I mean I don't agree with them on some
things,

2367
01:45:54,711 --> 01:45:58,790
but he's a very bright guy.
So when he finds someone that he can

2368
01:45:58,791 --> 01:46:00,890
pick on,
especially like he's really into picking

2369
01:46:00,891 --> 01:46:04,820
out feminists and calling them out on
their hypocrisy and picking on people

2370
01:46:04,821 --> 01:46:08,360
that just an eight minute he'll,
he'll go across the board with anybody

2371
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:12,170
if he thinks you're being ridiculous and
he makes a big deal out of it.

2372
01:46:12,430 --> 01:46:14,430
So then what people got mad at what he
was saying.

2373
01:46:14,550 --> 01:46:15,383
Well,
he'll say,

2374
01:46:15,580 --> 01:46:16,270
I don't know,
you know,

2375
01:46:16,270 --> 01:46:19,310
he'll say things to rile people up.
They'll say offensive things,

2376
01:46:19,550 --> 01:46:21,230
but guess what,
you block them.

2377
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:23,090
I think it's,
I think it's enjoyable.

2378
01:46:23,290 --> 01:46:25,550
Like I would think it's fun.
Twitter becomes weird where it's like

2379
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:27,320
you have a bunch of followers who follow
you.

2380
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:31,550
You say something funny on the offensive
side instead of on the cute side,

2381
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:34,340
um,
you'll get retweets if some cute side or

2382
01:46:34,341 --> 01:46:34,970
if it's A.
Yeah.

2383
01:46:34,970 --> 01:46:38,060
So now the retweets go to people who
don't follow you and they might not even

2384
01:46:38,061 --> 01:46:39,620
know who you are.
And then go like,

2385
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:41,840
what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Who's this guy,

2386
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:44,450
you know?
And they don't see any context.

2387
01:46:44,451 --> 01:46:47,420
They don't say it's one out of 10 tweets
in a row about a subject.

2388
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:48,910
Uh,
so then they see it.

2389
01:46:48,970 --> 01:46:50,250
Then they get mad and they flag

2390
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,360
it,
and then the people don't know,

2391
01:46:51,380 --> 01:46:51,721
like,
I don't know.

2392
01:46:51,721 --> 01:46:54,030
It's been flagged 7,000 times.
I guess people are mad at this guy.

2393
01:46:54,031 --> 01:46:55,200
We got to band them.
Well,

2394
01:46:55,201 --> 01:46:57,180
yeah.
Especially as a terrible road to go down

2395
01:46:57,350 --> 01:46:59,560
if there's,
if you're doing a series of,

2396
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:02,250
of show one,
it's like,

2397
01:47:02,251 --> 01:47:04,020
oh,
you're not even looking at the context.

2398
01:47:04,021 --> 01:47:04,890
Exactly.
Yeah,

2399
01:47:04,891 --> 01:47:08,510
that can definitely.
They took away his verify and not be

2400
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:10,020
verified.
Here's what I'm saying.

2401
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,020
They fucked up because now you have even
made him a martyr.

2402
01:47:13,270 --> 01:47:14,103
Like you'd go,
you're,

2403
01:47:14,650 --> 01:47:18,810
you're playing right into a spiderweb.
Why is twitter getting involved in any

2404
01:47:18,900 --> 01:47:20,520
level of celebrity?
Which he seems like he is.

2405
01:47:20,521 --> 01:47:22,170
If was a known writer,
then he's a known.

2406
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:24,780
He's.
He was great on the podcast.

2407
01:47:24,810 --> 01:47:25,261
Really?
Yeah,

2408
01:47:25,261 --> 01:47:26,360
he's hilarious.
He's,

2409
01:47:26,460 --> 01:47:27,940
he's a nut.
He,

2410
01:47:28,070 --> 01:47:29,000
I,
you know,

2411
01:47:29,030 --> 01:47:30,750
like I said,
I don't agree with them about a lot of

2412
01:47:30,751 --> 01:47:33,280
things,
but I like what he's doing.

2413
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:35,190
It makes me laugh.
Like he's.

2414
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:39,690
What is the difference when he was doing
what he's doing and what a lot of like,

2415
01:47:39,810 --> 01:47:42,450
funny humorous journalists have done,
but what about this evidence?

2416
01:47:42,460 --> 01:47:46,360
You say something Ernest,
that I think is like offensively wrong

2417
01:47:46,361 --> 01:47:48,120
and anti free speech and it gets me
angry.

2418
01:47:48,180 --> 01:47:50,400
I don't try to get them banned from it.
Yeah.

2419
01:47:50,401 --> 01:47:54,450
I don't mind but I don't mind because it
hasn't effect my mind.

2420
01:47:54,451 --> 01:47:56,150
I just don't want to stop them from
saying it.

2421
01:47:56,210 --> 01:47:59,820
I mean it hasn't affected me on a
professional level and if it has,

2422
01:47:59,821 --> 01:48:01,210
it's my fault,
you know,

2423
01:48:01,330 --> 01:48:03,410
anything that I've ever been affected by
it.

2424
01:48:03,411 --> 01:48:05,760
Like if I made a mistake because it's
clearly been my fault,

2425
01:48:06,270 --> 01:48:09,960
I've made definitely some errors,
but I think there's a difference between

2426
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:13,310
like I think what,
what

2427
01:48:15,110 --> 01:48:16,790
decisions for them to make them for you.

2428
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:19,220
Well bothers.
You don't want to.

2429
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:21,450
Getting back to that guy in Vancouver,
uh,

2430
01:48:21,570 --> 01:48:26,570
that had to pay 15 grand.
What bothers me about any,

2431
01:48:26,730 --> 01:48:31,140
any interaction between two people that
like one person said something rude or

2432
01:48:31,150 --> 01:48:32,730
whatever.
Who knows what exactly went down.

2433
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:37,230
That money starts being a thing that's
thrown around because then the

2434
01:48:37,231 --> 01:48:38,820
government gets their piece too,
by the way.

2435
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:41,160
Right.
So they're on the side of like,

2436
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:42,440
sure,
you should be able to sue them.

2437
01:48:42,450 --> 01:48:44,460
They also get their piece because of the
trial,

2438
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:48,780
like these court costs.
Everything has to get factored in.

2439
01:48:48,781 --> 01:48:50,370
I don't know exactly how it works in
Canada,

2440
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:52,890
but if it was in the United States,
Mike Ward isn't serious.

2441
01:48:52,891 --> 01:48:54,820
He's,
he's had a lot of money in his own and

2442
01:48:54,830 --> 01:48:56,880
his own lawyer fees because he's
fighting it.

2443
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,500
He has cash.
He's like a,

2444
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:00,570
he's like a well known French Canadian
comic.

2445
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,750
So he has this whole,
like French Canadian tour.

2446
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:04,680
You can do.
Which one was he with?

2447
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:08,760
Mike Ward is the one with um,
what you were talking about it earlier,

2448
01:49:08,761 --> 01:49:12,840
but the kid who had some diseases
and he made a joke about that.

2449
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:13,713
Yeah.
Okay.

2450
01:49:13,740 --> 01:49:18,470
And it was a bit had but like he's got
to pay all his legal fees and try to win

2451
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:21,100
this and he could pay the 80 grand the
sooner for.

2452
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:23,550
But he's like,
then that sets such a terrible

2453
01:49:23,551 --> 01:49:26,910
precedent.
So we just in his own battle on free

2454
01:49:26,911 --> 01:49:29,670
speech saying,
I don't want to lose this for what it

2455
01:49:29,671 --> 01:49:31,380
means.
It's fucked.

2456
01:49:32,140 --> 01:49:35,840
I mean it's people like full qm have
said that joke.

2457
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:37,890
That's bullshit.
Of course he should have got laughs.

2458
01:49:37,891 --> 01:49:39,930
A bunch of labs.
He said it enough times where was a is a

2459
01:49:39,931 --> 01:49:41,640
winning bit and his act.
Yeah.

2460
01:49:41,790 --> 01:49:44,460
And you can't decide that you can't
take.

2461
01:49:44,460 --> 01:49:47,950
Well obviously they can,
but you should be able to take money

2462
01:49:47,951 --> 01:49:50,710
away from people like that.
Yeah,

2463
01:49:51,180 --> 01:49:53,470
I mean you might want to say you don't
want to ever go to one of his shows

2464
01:49:53,471 --> 01:49:57,190
again.
I'm not going to chick fil a,

2465
01:49:57,191 --> 01:49:58,500
the guy who supports,
you know,

2466
01:49:58,510 --> 01:49:59,560
anti gay stuff.
Okay.

2467
01:49:59,561 --> 01:50:01,330
There you go.
That's how you speak with your own

2468
01:50:01,331 --> 01:50:02,380
dollar.
Exactly.

2469
01:50:02,450 --> 01:50:04,030
Let,
let the market decide.

2470
01:50:04,410 --> 01:50:05,830
No,
I think that's a,

2471
01:50:05,970 --> 01:50:09,130
that's the appropriate way to the
fucking directors.

2472
01:50:09,131 --> 01:50:12,010
That guy who did,
who did pan's labyrinth,

2473
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:16,360
whammo dealt garbage now how dare you.
So then it's like,

2474
01:50:16,361 --> 01:50:18,220
once you realize that,
but it's like

2475
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:22,060
he used to be cool,
but now it's like fucking awful.

2476
01:50:22,061 --> 01:50:23,830
And it's just talking.
He's gone sour,

2477
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:25,930
so then it's like I just won't watch
them anymore,

2478
01:50:25,931 --> 01:50:28,420
but of course go make whatever you want
to make in.

2479
01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:31,780
Well,
I wouldn't say went sour.

2480
01:50:32,050 --> 01:50:35,420
I still like it stuff.
You'd like the hobbit that he wrote just

2481
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,150
like that last movie.
You didn't like it.

2482
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:39,790
The last movie he didn't like it.
It looked like it was an acting class

2483
01:50:39,791 --> 01:50:40,680
thing.
Was it?

2484
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:45,470
It was just like there was no acting.
You the cabin thing or you think you are

2485
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:49,300
main wounds.
I mean I was probably pretty high,

2486
01:50:50,290 --> 01:50:53,920
but God,
it was such terrible acting and no plot

2487
01:50:53,921 --> 01:50:55,030
and just like,
wait,

2488
01:50:55,031 --> 01:50:55,421
wait,
wait.

2489
01:50:55,421 --> 01:50:56,830
I'll show you some special effects and a
little.

2490
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:58,780
Did you yell out?
Know what?

2491
01:50:58,781 --> 01:50:59,920
I did leave.
Did you?

2492
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:01,200
I left quietly.
Wow.

2493
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:03,250
Me and the girl I was looking for
eventually we were like.

2494
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:06,340
It was like we both realized we were
both wanting to leave for about 25

2495
01:51:06,341 --> 01:51:07,310
minutes and then I was like,
hey,

2496
01:51:07,311 --> 01:51:10,150
let's just go here.
Maybe you just want to get your freak

2497
01:51:10,151 --> 01:51:11,170
on.
Do.

2498
01:51:11,210 --> 01:51:13,060
Do you like that movie,
that new movie made?

2499
01:51:13,590 --> 01:51:15,160
Did you really do you have.

2500
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,290
I'm not even going to bring up the what
the American side because I'm afraid of

2501
01:51:20,291 --> 01:51:21,880
it because it's say,
but no boots.

2502
01:51:21,881 --> 01:51:23,080
Bring that up.
Let's bring that up.

2503
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:26,710
Because I saw it.
So tell me you didn't like it.

2504
01:51:26,770 --> 01:51:28,780
It wasn't a good movie.
It wasn't a good movie.

2505
01:51:28,781 --> 01:51:30,670
It wasn't a good movie.
This is the thing.

2506
01:51:30,710 --> 01:51:33,130
No development.
Exactly.

2507
01:51:33,131 --> 01:51:35,920
I never get to like him,
so now he's having trouble sleeping.

2508
01:51:35,921 --> 01:51:36,760
Suddenly it's good.
Again,

2509
01:51:36,761 --> 01:51:40,810
whites is where it's a scene in their
subject matter is highly charged and

2510
01:51:40,811 --> 01:51:42,790
very,
very sensitive to people.

2511
01:51:42,791 --> 01:51:47,710
So anything that's thought of in
disrespect of Chris Kyle,

2512
01:51:47,890 --> 01:51:51,640
people automatically get up in arms for.
I completely understood talking about

2513
01:51:51,641 --> 01:51:52,740
his book and I'm like,
I don't know.

2514
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:55,120
I didn't read any that I saw this
fucking awful movie.

2515
01:51:55,190 --> 01:51:55,670
I,
yeah,

2516
01:51:55,670 --> 01:51:59,740
I completely understand people's
position in respecting him as a guy who

2517
01:51:59,770 --> 01:52:01,840
kept people safe over there.

2518
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,970
I understand where they're coming from.
His wife,

2519
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:06,610
half the movie when he's in battles.
Very angry,

2520
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:09,640
but I was going to say it's just not
well done.

2521
01:52:09,670 --> 01:52:10,690
No,
it's not well done.

2522
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:13,680
It's not just not that well done.
I mean,

2523
01:52:13,681 --> 01:52:16,900
it's just my opinion.
I just felt like it was flat and this is

2524
01:52:16,901 --> 01:52:18,280
like,
here's a good comparison.

2525
01:52:18,290 --> 01:52:20,140
I,
I hate to beat a dead horse,

2526
01:52:20,141 --> 01:52:24,700
but I'm x Mokena Ipa,
watch x Maki now and watch that movie.

2527
01:52:24,740 --> 01:52:28,170
There's a way that it's shot.
There's a way the story's told that

2528
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:31,840
story is a very compelling story.
It's kind of a crazy story.

2529
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:33,580
That countdown was a good move.
That was like,

2530
01:52:33,581 --> 01:52:35,290
whoa.
Clipping and fucking yes.

2531
01:52:35,470 --> 01:52:37,720
Exacerbating the Chris Kyle counselor,
you know,

2532
01:52:37,790 --> 01:52:40,210
would've been fucking.
Ryan was great.

2533
01:52:40,660 --> 01:52:45,660
How about tell the truth about Chris
Kyle's life like in towards the end

2534
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:48,950
where he was involved in that Jesse
Ventura thing,

2535
01:52:48,951 --> 01:52:52,220
which is really kind of crazy where he's
making up a story about a fight with

2536
01:52:52,221 --> 01:52:54,140
Jesse Ventura.
That never happened.

2537
01:52:54,410 --> 01:52:58,730
So Jesse Ventura sued him and won and
then after he won,

2538
01:52:58,890 --> 01:52:59,710
he,
he,

2539
01:52:59,710 --> 01:53:02,960
he got Chris Kyle got killed and Jesse
Ventura got all these death threats

2540
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:04,700
because you want to continue to it.
Well,

2541
01:53:04,701 --> 01:53:06,230
it wasn't that much of a year before he
died.

2542
01:53:06,510 --> 01:53:07,970
It was just some guy who's lying about
me.

2543
01:53:08,860 --> 01:53:11,270
Well,
I think you can be both.

2544
01:53:11,330 --> 01:53:12,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

2545
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:14,510
This is where things get really
confusing.

2546
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:16,820
Jackson rapes boys.
I don't think he did.

2547
01:53:17,570 --> 01:53:19,400
I think he just jerked off in front of
him and shit,

2548
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:22,160
stuff like that.
Maybe he was raping them.

2549
01:53:23,210 --> 01:53:24,440
I just feel like that would have got
out.

2550
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:25,363
Yeah,
maybe you're right.

2551
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:30,670
I think it was just parties and like
maybe stroke,

2552
01:53:30,900 --> 01:53:33,270
but definitely inappropriate boners.

2553
01:53:34,110 --> 01:53:35,570
If he could get one.
He got one.

2554
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:40,720
I mean during that time period.
I mean he's got to find time to jerk off

2555
01:53:41,271 --> 01:53:43,800
unless he's jerking off in the shower,
you know,

2556
01:53:43,850 --> 01:53:45,140
touching it.
These kids,

2557
01:53:45,640 --> 01:53:48,650
they're over the house all the time and
they're sitting in his lap and you know,

2558
01:53:48,690 --> 01:53:50,390
just blood.
They're sensitive tissue

2559
01:53:52,270 --> 01:53:54,310
side.
His fault or my fault.

2560
01:53:55,630 --> 01:53:57,420
He didn't.
I mean it's just love.

2561
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:00,860
Everyone's so sensitive.
It's just love.

2562
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:02,230
God.
Well,

2563
01:54:02,390 --> 01:54:04,810
could just be beautiful.
Cup of listening to Ben.

2564
01:54:05,090 --> 01:54:08,390
Exactly down.
Oh yeah.

2565
01:54:08,460 --> 01:54:11,060
Good Times.
I'm the one in the room with macaulay.

2566
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:16,080
Anyway,
I got on that.

2567
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:17,540
How do we go that?
We just,

2568
01:54:17,570 --> 01:54:20,470
I just went with it.
What we're talking about somebody that

2569
01:54:20,890 --> 01:54:24,830
you can be two things at once,
it doesn't mean he wasn't a hero.

2570
01:54:25,050 --> 01:54:26,800
Artists.
Those saved.

2571
01:54:26,900 --> 01:54:28,550
Yeah,
we'll think about what he did.

2572
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:32,660
Right.
There was a great sniper saved American

2573
01:54:32,661 --> 01:54:36,920
citizens that were over there fighting
in the war against other people that

2574
01:54:36,921 --> 01:54:39,110
were fighting against American citizens.
The way.

2575
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:40,610
Hold on,
sorry.

2576
01:54:40,610 --> 01:54:42,200
Sorry.
Draw your conclusion about who's right

2577
01:54:42,201 --> 01:54:44,660
or who's wrong.
Get that out of your head and he was

2578
01:54:44,661 --> 01:54:46,010
trying to protect his friends.
Right,

2579
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:48,800
so whether or not you think that he
should be on this team or that team or

2580
01:54:48,801 --> 01:54:51,740
this team is bad and that team's good.
We'll put all that aside.

2581
01:54:51,980 --> 01:54:54,290
He kept a bunch of people live.
Those people came back.

2582
01:54:54,291 --> 01:54:55,790
Whether or not you think they should
come back,

2583
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:58,070
whether or not you think that she'd ever
been in there in the first place.

2584
01:54:58,220 --> 01:55:02,810
He definitely helped countless.
I mean it's probably actually probably

2585
01:55:02,811 --> 01:55:05,190
if this movie is about the French sniper
or about sniper,

2586
01:55:05,210 --> 01:55:07,640
the world doesn't exist.
It's was not a good movie.

2587
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:11,030
Yeah.
It's not a good movie he ever took was

2588
01:55:11,031 --> 01:55:14,090
like 2000 yards.
I don't remember the numbers anymore and

2589
01:55:14,091 --> 01:55:15,960
then,
and then he hurts.

2590
01:55:15,961 --> 01:55:18,440
So and so Mustafa was getting shocked
that long.

2591
01:55:18,441 --> 01:55:20,000
He's like,
it's possible I've shot that,

2592
01:55:20,001 --> 01:55:22,220
but that's the longest I've ever shot.
And then when he shoots him at the end,

2593
01:55:22,250 --> 01:55:27,140
it's twice as far as the longest shot
he's ever heard of it can't even see the

2594
01:55:27,141 --> 01:55:28,280
guy.
You just see a blur.

2595
01:55:28,281 --> 01:55:29,420
And he goes,
I know it's him.

2596
01:55:29,540 --> 01:55:30,890
It must be.
I have a feeling.

2597
01:55:31,190 --> 01:55:32,210
Yeah.
And then it goes,

2598
01:55:32,211 --> 01:55:33,044
Yup.
Got Them.

2599
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,420
You can't even see them,
you know,

2600
01:55:36,210 --> 01:55:40,310
made the twice as long as any shot
that's ever been recorded without being

2601
01:55:40,311 --> 01:55:40,700
able to see it.

2602
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:42,380
You just know you have you made it.
Yeah.

2603
01:55:42,381 --> 01:55:46,050
You need a spotting for 200 yards.
You know,

2604
01:55:46,051 --> 01:55:50,430
people look at as target that's 200
yards away spotting scope to see where

2605
01:55:50,431 --> 01:55:53,430
you're hitting on the target.
Cause like it's not that good to see how

2606
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:56,880
the scope.
Like you're a rifle scope from 200

2607
01:55:56,881 --> 01:55:57,900
yards,
which is nothing.

2608
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:01,380
So like two football fields.
It was just.

2609
01:56:01,570 --> 01:56:03,150
So here's,
here's the question though,

2610
01:56:04,350 --> 01:56:09,350
is it also a factor of you're telling a
real person's story with his little

2611
01:56:09,721 --> 01:56:14,310
variation from the truth as possible
over at an acceptable period of time,

2612
01:56:14,311 --> 01:56:17,340
a two hour movie or whatever it is.
It's fucking hard to do,

2613
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,460
but they didn't do a good job of it.
They did a terrible job of it,

2614
01:56:20,610 --> 01:56:23,850
but it would've been incredibly
difficult to do even if it did a great

2615
01:56:23,851 --> 01:56:25,170
job.
And let's just back up a second.

2616
01:56:25,510 --> 01:56:28,340
I'm best actor.
Yeah,

2617
01:56:28,350 --> 01:56:29,490
that.
That's not real.

2618
01:56:29,550 --> 01:56:30,330
I mean,
come on.

2619
01:56:30,330 --> 01:56:33,810
He looked like he could tell what he was
doing lines where he was hit a rubber

2620
01:56:33,811 --> 01:56:35,850
baby and I knew that.
Forget to rubber baby,

2621
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:38,200
but he's moving the rubber baby with his
fingers and thumb.

2622
01:56:38,450 --> 01:56:39,710
You can go fuck yourself.
Okay.

2623
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:41,880
I'm not a kid.
What did you do on a magic trick that I

2624
01:56:41,881 --> 01:56:46,200
can see who and were going to stick this
into my hand and you're shoveling in

2625
01:56:46,201 --> 01:56:50,610
your wrist at the same time.
My thumbs coming apart,

2626
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:55,190
bulging your shirt at the fucking Hanky.
Still sticking out a little bit what?

2627
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:59,120
God.
Even in the beginning when he finds his,

2628
01:56:59,190 --> 01:57:01,820
his girlfriend and the other guy,
those are out there having that talk and

2629
01:57:01,821 --> 01:57:02,790
he's drinking a beer.
It's like,

2630
01:57:02,791 --> 01:57:03,540
dude,
come on.

2631
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:05,250
You're not even a real person.
This is acting class.

2632
01:57:05,250 --> 01:57:08,160
I can see you doing lines,
but he's not a real person.

2633
01:57:08,190 --> 01:57:11,430
He's behaving in this incredible,
exemplary way.

2634
01:57:11,610 --> 01:57:13,260
Like a hero.
He's in practice.

2635
01:57:13,290 --> 01:57:16,170
He's a beautiful hero.
He's not perfect hero and we can't

2636
01:57:16,171 --> 01:57:17,310
believe he's gone.
I mean,

2637
01:57:17,311 --> 01:57:18,630
that's what he's a hero.
He's in a

2638
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:22,230
fight with his girl and he stands up and
they're like,

2639
01:57:22,231 --> 01:57:24,300
you're just tell that the directors in
the background,

2640
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:25,290
feel it more.
Not.

2641
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:26,250
Feel it more.
Yeah.

2642
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:28,390
Let this hit you.
You love America because it's happening

2643
01:57:28,391 --> 01:57:29,460
to you.
Feel it more.

2644
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:32,880
What's the problem?
Whenever you try to dramatize anything,

2645
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:36,870
you know that movie Fox catcher is a
clusterfuck of lies.

2646
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:40,030
Really movie that's based on Mark
Schultz and David Schultz,

2647
01:57:40,130 --> 01:57:45,130
sort of Olympic wrestlers.
They were a very famous American Olympic

2648
01:57:45,151 --> 01:57:48,720
champion wrestlers.
They were both beasts and there was this

2649
01:57:48,721 --> 01:57:52,200
crazy guy named John Dupont and John
Dupont had a lot of money,

2650
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:56,790
so like the dupont name and he was a
crazy man and he wanted to wrestle,

2651
01:57:56,940 --> 01:58:01,800
so he hired all these guys and built an
incredible world class training facility

2652
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:04,350
and paid them and these guys were
struggling wrestlers.

2653
01:58:04,350 --> 01:58:06,300
They went down there and uh,
one of the guys,

2654
01:58:06,390 --> 01:58:11,100
Dave wound up getting murdered by dupont
and it was just crazy store and Steve

2655
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:12,960
Carell played him in the movie,
but the movie,

2656
01:58:12,990 --> 01:58:17,190
although it was a good movie,
the reality was way off,

2657
01:58:17,220 --> 01:58:19,920
way off.
Like they changed the timeline of the

2658
01:58:19,921 --> 01:58:21,640
UFC.
They stayed,

2659
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:26,490
they had to the UFC existing like way,
way before it did.

2660
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:28,820
I'm less concerned with that than if
it's a movie then,

2661
01:58:29,010 --> 01:58:31,530
unless they say it's like a actual
biography.

2662
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:34,100
Yeah.
I'm less concerned with that than,

2663
01:58:34,160 --> 01:58:36,060
than if a like narcos.
I'm like,

2664
01:58:36,110 --> 01:58:37,610
know some of this is based on truth.
Some of this,

2665
01:58:37,620 --> 01:58:39,250
just like they didn't know the
relationship with this guy in this

2666
01:58:39,260 --> 01:58:42,310
because they didn't have to fake that
historic data.

2667
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:44,920
Did they figure because they're idiots?
What benefits of this plot?

2668
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:48,790
It's somebodies thinks they're smarter
than everyone who's going to know the

2669
01:58:48,791 --> 01:58:50,510
truth,
which is the dumbest thing too,

2670
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:51,423
to think.

2671
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:55,840
You should never think if you're going
to talk about a subject like the UFC,

2672
01:58:55,990 --> 01:58:59,160
which to a person like you,
I know you're a fan and definitely into.

2673
01:58:59,310 --> 01:59:01,120
You know when it starts offensive as
fuck.

2674
01:59:01,121 --> 01:59:02,860
When you try to pretend it started a
different date.

2675
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:06,670
Then when you watch him watch on
television,

2676
01:59:06,671 --> 01:59:09,400
watch big daddy goodrich fight,
but then when he fights in the movie,

2677
01:59:09,401 --> 01:59:10,870
he fights them.
White Russian guy.

2678
01:59:11,140 --> 01:59:13,200
Bullshit.
He fought big daddy goodrich.

2679
01:59:13,330 --> 01:59:16,180
Mark Schultz fought big daddy good.
Which I watched it.

2680
01:59:16,470 --> 01:59:19,360
He beat his ass.
He took him down at will and I remember

2681
01:59:19,361 --> 01:59:21,220
watching it going,
Jesus Christ,

2682
01:59:21,221 --> 01:59:24,550
this is what happens when you get elite
Olympic gold medalists,

2683
01:59:24,670 --> 01:59:26,680
world champion wrestlers.
Like I was thinking to myself,

2684
01:59:26,681 --> 01:59:28,750
who the fuck is going to keep that guy
off of them?

2685
01:59:28,780 --> 01:59:30,820
That could have been a world champion
for sure.

2686
01:59:31,080 --> 01:59:33,140
He nobody wanted to know.

2687
01:59:33,190 --> 01:59:35,860
He was in the UFC,
fought big daddy goodrich in the UFC,

2688
01:59:36,070 --> 01:59:39,110
but there was no money back then and he
had a Gig with a.

2689
01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:42,700
He was teaching wrestling at a college
and not paid more.

2690
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:46,300
What was coach a wrestling coach?
Like a university gig.

2691
01:59:46,301 --> 01:59:49,420
I mean he's a really respected wrestler
and they didn't want him cage fighting,

2692
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:52,090
so they told him like this is it,
like you have to make a decision.

2693
01:59:52,091 --> 01:59:56,290
So he had to go with the the obvious job
because there was no money in the UFC

2694
01:59:56,291 --> 02:00:00,820
back then is fucking really dangerous.
But they changed in the movie.

2695
02:00:00,821 --> 02:00:02,870
They had them fighting in some unknown
organization.

2696
02:00:02,871 --> 02:00:05,880
It wasn't the UFC and the guy was a
white Russian guy who was fighting like,

2697
02:00:06,160 --> 02:00:07,360
hold on,
let me ask you a question.

2698
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:08,830
Could this be the reason they changed
it?

2699
02:00:09,040 --> 02:00:12,970
Because what the UFC means right now is
like this massive thing.

2700
02:00:12,970 --> 02:00:14,410
So they'd go,
well viewers,

2701
02:00:14,770 --> 02:00:15,810
if they saw this like,
yeah,

2702
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:16,960
you have.
See that's really big.

2703
02:00:16,961 --> 02:00:18,420
I would give up UFC where you're like,
no,

2704
02:00:18,421 --> 02:00:19,750
no,
you need to be in the place.

2705
02:00:20,200 --> 02:00:22,390
Back then,
this was just a rogue thing.

2706
02:00:22,990 --> 02:00:25,570
People just did it to mix.
You know what I mean?

2707
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,660
I see what you want to have.
Cursing in deadwood.

2708
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:28,241
It's like,
yeah,

2709
02:00:28,241 --> 02:00:30,790
they didn't have that then,
but you're not gonna understand the

2710
02:00:30,791 --> 02:00:33,310
cursing they actually had.
Did they have cursing back then?

2711
02:00:33,340 --> 02:00:37,340
They had like rapscallion and shit,
so he wouldn't hit as hard as it as an

2712
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:40,720
scallion,
so they had to change the reality to

2713
02:00:40,721 --> 02:00:44,410
make it the feeling of the issue.
Imagine if you were doing a comedy show

2714
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:46,960
in the wild west and someone tried to
heckle you,

2715
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:51,070
fucking go to that guy.
What kind of damage you could do to them

2716
02:00:51,180 --> 02:00:55,240
with the cursing I have now rapscallion,
you're a cunt.

2717
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:57,520
You fucking bitch.
Well,

2718
02:00:57,610 --> 02:00:59,050
you're anchored out of here.
Fuck boy.

2719
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:00,490
Here.
You're angry and it's not even a real

2720
02:01:00,491 --> 02:01:01,650
person.
We're talking about.

2721
02:01:01,690 --> 02:01:03,160
It all worked up,
man.

2722
02:01:03,190 --> 02:01:05,170
Fucking pea pea shooter,
motherfucker.

2723
02:01:05,171 --> 02:01:08,320
She was Christ peter,
Rusty Stirrup,

2724
02:01:08,410 --> 02:01:10,450
cunt.
And then he brings you in front of the

2725
02:01:10,451 --> 02:01:12,940
tribunal and you have to give up three
pieces of gold.

2726
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:16,390
Fucked up.
Three pieces of gold,

2727
02:01:16,810 --> 02:01:19,180
gold shift here.
What it's going to happen,

2728
02:01:19,181 --> 02:01:20,380
man.
Are we going to go bitcoin?

2729
02:01:20,410 --> 02:01:22,450
You think I've got to get Antonopoulos
back on.

2730
02:01:22,810 --> 02:01:23,760
It's been awhile.
I don't know.

2731
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:24,760
Probably.
Tell me again.

2732
02:01:24,761 --> 02:01:25,870
I'll.
I'll believe them again.

2733
02:01:26,500 --> 02:01:29,950
By the time I come back here in two.
You don't know how to spend bitcoin.

2734
02:01:30,670 --> 02:01:32,080
How to spin it.
Spend it.

2735
02:01:32,110 --> 02:01:33,300
Spend it.
Hm.

2736
02:01:33,610 --> 02:01:35,050
That's a problem.
If you don't know how to spend your

2737
02:01:35,051 --> 02:01:36,880
money,
probably look into it,

2738
02:01:37,120 --> 02:01:39,440
but if you don't have this ancient
fucking phone,

2739
02:01:39,441 --> 02:01:40,160
you have to be plugged

2740
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:42,050
into your laptop,
but some sort of Ethernet cable,

2741
02:01:42,051 --> 02:01:44,510
don't ya?
You got some 19 seventies laptop too.

2742
02:01:44,511 --> 02:01:46,310
Don't you fuck.
Come on.

2743
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:50,090
Book pro.
That doesn't even have a USB port,

2744
02:01:50,091 --> 02:01:51,850
does it?
Which one doesn't have a USB port?

2745
02:01:52,670 --> 02:01:55,190
Do they have one that doesn't?
Don't have CD drives anymore?

2746
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:57,200
No.
One of them doesn't even have a USB

2747
02:01:57,201 --> 02:01:59,830
port.
There's a real skinny one of the air.

2748
02:02:00,030 --> 02:02:01,190
No,
it's not even the air.

2749
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:05,150
It's like it's not the air.
Google that shit son.

2750
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:07,250
Don't have them.
I know that.

2751
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:09,530
Yeah.
I pads don't have USB ports,

2752
02:02:09,531 --> 02:02:12,590
which was USB port.
USB is where you would plug things in,

2753
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:16,830
you know like if you were trying to sync
your phone up to it or something like

2754
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:18,940
that,
plug your phone by USB or if you want to

2755
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:22,540
save something on a drive,
but they didn't have the USB Port to

2756
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:22,880
port.

2757
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,290
No,
it has a little battery thing.

2758
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:26,030
Sticks to charge your phone.
You don't.

2759
02:02:26,360 --> 02:02:29,450
Don't fucking laptop.
Maybe can't handle it.

2760
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:32,180
Maybe it can handle the power draw
because it's so thin,

2761
02:02:32,570 --> 02:02:36,260
like it only exists as something that
you can store things in the cloud,

2762
02:02:37,010 --> 02:02:40,010
which is where they're trying to snake.
I try to bring you.

2763
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:42,380
Bless you.
Do you still accept.

2764
02:02:42,381 --> 02:02:45,320
Bless you even though you're not
religious anymore or did I just defend

2765
02:02:45,321 --> 02:02:46,910
your sensibility?
Did I trigger you in any way?

2766
02:02:47,450 --> 02:02:48,320
Hurt man.
I don't.

2767
02:02:48,321 --> 02:02:51,320
It's not a correct gender pronouns for
today.

2768
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:57,280
I am a.
He today ain't going by he.

2769
02:02:58,040 --> 02:03:01,220
I go by he everyday.
I'm going to try z out for awhile.

2770
02:03:01,310 --> 02:03:02,210
Z,
Z,

2771
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:03,170
Z,
h e e Dot.

2772
02:03:03,410 --> 02:03:04,243
What is that?
Is that a new one?

2773
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:07,820
Gender neutral.
Gender neutral was kind of like shit

2774
02:03:07,821 --> 02:03:08,750
hit.
You'll be whoever you want.

2775
02:03:09,220 --> 02:03:09,820
Z,
H dot.

2776
02:03:09,820 --> 02:03:10,950
I'm just already.
Oh,

2777
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:13,430
why does it have to be directly?
Why do you have to say,

2778
02:03:13,431 --> 02:03:16,850
Mr?
What do we formal ha my fucking checking

2779
02:03:16,851 --> 02:03:18,520
into a hotel position of words are
using.

2780
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:21,830
It's like no one has to say that.
That's just what they've been saying.

2781
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:22,810
I think they,
uh,

2782
02:03:22,850 --> 02:03:24,470
you need to be able to control what
people say.

2783
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:26,900
I love that people like shit on some
sort of stand up and they go,

2784
02:03:27,170 --> 02:03:28,650
oh,
what is that all you can talk about it.

2785
02:03:28,660 --> 02:03:30,230
It's like,
that's not all they can talk about.

2786
02:03:30,231 --> 02:03:32,480
That's one little sentence in this whole
bit.

2787
02:03:32,481 --> 02:03:35,690
That's part of the whole special.
It's really not all they can talk about.

2788
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:37,220
Yeah.
But if I'm going to make fun of it,

2789
02:03:37,221 --> 02:03:39,470
that's what I'm going to say.
I want to say that this is all you can

2790
02:03:39,471 --> 02:03:40,304
talk about,
bro.

2791
02:03:40,370 --> 02:03:41,940
You like drag me to hell too.
Huh?

2792
02:03:42,110 --> 02:03:46,310
Love me and read.
I went to see a up and we were so happy

2793
02:03:47,010 --> 02:03:49,860
and so Gora where like you fucked up.
She just dragged me down.

2794
02:03:49,880 --> 02:03:51,590
I finally saw it.
I'm like this movie,

2795
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:55,550
whether it's a comedy.
Perfect.

2796
02:03:55,670 --> 02:03:57,350
You weren't high enough and you didn't
go see with me.

2797
02:03:57,890 --> 02:03:59,630
Come see you.
Me and Duncan would see.

2798
02:03:59,631 --> 02:04:01,790
Drag me to hell.
We would love it.

2799
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:04,490
Love it.
We would have the best time you ever see

2800
02:04:04,491 --> 02:04:05,480
up.
Yes.

2801
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:06,390
Cartoon.
Yeah.

2802
02:04:06,980 --> 02:04:08,270
I liked up up.
Was good.

2803
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:09,260
That's good.
It's interesting,

2804
02:04:09,261 --> 02:04:11,480
but it was sad.
It was that the first 10 minutes are

2805
02:04:11,481 --> 02:04:12,890
beautiful.
Yeah.

2806
02:04:12,950 --> 02:04:15,680
It's interesting.
You saw what won best comedy last night

2807
02:04:15,681 --> 02:04:17,240
at the Golden Globes.
Know the Martian.

2808
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:19,190
Oh yeah.
How did that word Marshall and best

2809
02:04:19,200 --> 02:04:21,920
comments at work?
How does the Martian when best comedy

2810
02:04:21,921 --> 02:04:24,620
and comedy or musical category,
and I don't know how it gets,

2811
02:04:24,660 --> 02:04:26,190
why they still only comedy or musical.

2812
02:04:26,190 --> 02:04:28,220
This so offensive to both comedy and
music.

2813
02:04:28,221 --> 02:04:30,080
That's not a comedy and it's not a
musical.

2814
02:04:30,110 --> 02:04:32,420
Listen,
award shows or students call it other.

2815
02:04:32,510 --> 02:04:35,630
They're stupid award.
How did the Marsha when best comedy.

2816
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:39,600
They're stupid because he made so he
kept it lighthearted sometimes.

2817
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:42,440
Trying to be plus one.
The best one.

2818
02:04:42,650 --> 02:04:46,830
One W we've already established right
here between you and I.

2819
02:04:46,830 --> 02:04:51,830
The Shit I love that you hate,
but I genuinely love star wars.

2820
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:54,180
Like I walked out of there going,
yes,

2821
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:57,330
they fucking did it.
I walked out of there like they nailed

2822
02:04:57,331 --> 02:05:00,330
it.
They upgraded the original movie and

2823
02:05:00,331 --> 02:05:04,140
made it fit in today and he did it with
great acting and a great storyline.

2824
02:05:04,141 --> 02:05:07,260
It was perfect.
It was very star wars s fucking hated

2825
02:05:07,261 --> 02:05:08,310
it.
I didn't hate it,

2826
02:05:08,311 --> 02:05:10,080
but it's just like,
I thought it was like a b.

2827
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:11,040
okay,
let's,

2828
02:05:11,070 --> 02:05:11,630
let's pays.

2829
02:05:11,630 --> 02:05:12,450
Good.
It was a fun movie.

2830
02:05:12,450 --> 02:05:14,100
Tell me some other movies that you've
seen recently.

2831
02:05:14,101 --> 02:05:17,260
So Star Wars would compare a hateful
eight.

2832
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:19,750
No way you saw seen that?
Um,

2833
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:21,090
uh,
I don't see that though.

2834
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:23,860
I enjoyed madmax.
Yeah,

2835
02:05:23,900 --> 02:05:25,140
me too.
I thought it was really fun.

2836
02:05:25,170 --> 02:05:27,690
Chase,
you know,

2837
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:29,490
Eddie Bravo.
None of those fucking hated it.

2838
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:30,950
Really hated it.
There were none.

2839
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:32,760
There was none of the points where I'm
like,

2840
02:05:32,761 --> 02:05:34,740
this wouldn't exist in that world.
I set up.

2841
02:05:34,820 --> 02:05:37,170
I'm like,
that wouldn't happen in star wars.

2842
02:05:37,171 --> 02:05:38,460
The world they set up.
It's like,

2843
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:42,450
why is she suddenly have Jennifer
flowers with no training?

2844
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:44,010
Well,
because there's a thing called editing,

2845
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:46,380
there's probably a bunch of scenes that
were on the cutting room floor that

2846
02:05:46,381 --> 02:05:49,440
explain her power soil or this point
star wars.

2847
02:05:49,710 --> 02:05:51,630
Everyone's seen it.
You should really say,

2848
02:05:51,631 --> 02:05:53,340
spoiler alert first.
You really fucked up.

2849
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:56,850
I'm sure we're already.
We're already open.

2850
02:05:57,020 --> 02:05:59,160
She just got it a little too fast and
then it's like,

2851
02:05:59,161 --> 02:06:00,170
well no.
She was the chosen one.

2852
02:06:00,171 --> 02:06:00,451
It's like,
oh,

2853
02:06:00,451 --> 02:06:02,820
like Luke Skywalker,
she was wanting to study for a month

2854
02:06:02,821 --> 02:06:04,830
with a fucking Yoda to get any of his
powers.

2855
02:06:04,831 --> 02:06:07,110
Well,
chicks learn quicker and they have no

2856
02:06:07,111 --> 02:06:09,480
chicken picker in their world and they
have that.

2857
02:06:09,481 --> 02:06:11,490
If you don't get it from as a kid,
you're never going to get it.

2858
02:06:11,550 --> 02:06:12,540
Well,
there's the thing called morphic

2859
02:06:12,870 --> 02:06:15,300
resonance and they think that like as
people learn,

2860
02:06:15,301 --> 02:06:17,190
things becomes easier for other people
to learn things.

2861
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:18,630
We all learned together,
but she beat up.

2862
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:23,550
It's beating up a storm trooper with it,
which I've been studying with the head

2863
02:06:23,551 --> 02:06:26,070
guy.
She had a guy who's been studying under

2864
02:06:26,310 --> 02:06:31,310
the main gracie and she was like,
I just sort of get Jujitsu and I think I

2865
02:06:32,071 --> 02:06:35,190
can beat this guy who's been studying
under the main gracie.

2866
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:37,440
Bj Penn won the world championship three
years in.

2867
02:06:37,441 --> 02:06:40,380
Weird Shit happens man,
though.

2868
02:06:40,381 --> 02:06:41,400
He wasn't just like,
yeah,

2869
02:06:41,401 --> 02:06:44,100
but you know what?
You don't realize that she was using the

2870
02:06:44,101 --> 02:06:45,690
forest,
but she's probably using it all along.

2871
02:06:47,420 --> 02:06:49,200
It wasn't flood mode,
but you saw first week,

2872
02:06:49,201 --> 02:06:50,460
right?
What's first week?

2873
02:06:50,660 --> 02:06:51,990
First Week.
The first week or two was out.

2874
02:06:52,050 --> 02:06:54,630
Oh yeah.
That's why it was the same as the other

2875
02:06:54,631 --> 02:06:57,090
movie when it came out.
Episode one where everyone's like me to

2876
02:06:57,110 --> 02:06:58,440
like,
fuck yes,

2877
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:01,350
this is way better than those.
But it was not as good as people were

2878
02:07:01,351 --> 02:07:02,520
remembering.
How dare you.

2879
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:04,990
Were you in a theater when they clapped?
When they saw them letting him Falcon?

2880
02:07:05,560 --> 02:07:08,820
Um,
I clap almost brainwash week.

2881
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:10,150
I almost cried.
I know.

2882
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:12,990
Oh,
I hope they do the other things.

2883
02:07:12,991 --> 02:07:15,240
They've already done the lead.
Han Solo showed up.

2884
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:16,350
My heart filled with joy.

2885
02:07:16,350 --> 02:07:17,670
I liked that.
That was fun.

2886
02:07:18,120 --> 02:07:19,320
That was fun.
I liked that a lot.

2887
02:07:19,350 --> 02:07:20,400
That was great.
With Chewie,

2888
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:21,480
we're home like,
fuck.

2889
02:07:21,481 --> 02:07:23,310
Yes.
I liked that a lot.

2890
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:25,030
They fucked up in that regard,
right?

2891
02:07:25,380 --> 02:07:26,660
Spoiler alert.
No,

2892
02:07:26,770 --> 02:07:29,270
there's no spoiler alerts anymore.
The chance.

2893
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:32,970
Don't say it.
What if people like fast forward it and

2894
02:07:32,971 --> 02:07:34,770
they get to the part where we say Han
solo got killed.

2895
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:38,600
There was a guy that I saw a picture of
somebody.

2896
02:07:38,710 --> 02:07:40,750
You know those things you can put in the
back of your truck,

2897
02:07:40,930 --> 02:07:45,930
like a the Smith family.
What Solo dies in the force awakens in

2898
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:49,210
the Star Wars.
So rude.

2899
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:52,870
That's really driving a rental or it's
big spoiler,

2900
02:07:53,050 --> 02:07:56,310
spoiler.
Fucking awesome movies with these

2901
02:07:56,350 --> 02:07:58,630
boilers.
You have a chance right then to get on

2902
02:07:58,631 --> 02:08:01,500
it or you're done.
I already knew I already knew going into

2903
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:03,880
see the movie,
but we'd already been spoiler and

2904
02:08:03,881 --> 02:08:04,420
forget.

2905
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:07,580
It had already been spoiled for me,
but I still enjoyed the phone.

2906
02:08:07,790 --> 02:08:10,030
Who's going out there to die?
I knew he was gonna die when he walked

2907
02:08:10,031 --> 02:08:11,280
out on that platform is like,
what do you do?

2908
02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:13,880
Obviously you shoot him.
Yeah.

2909
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:15,580
Okay.
Why don't you shoot your stupid fucking

2910
02:08:15,581 --> 02:08:17,500
son,
late term abortion.

2911
02:08:17,620 --> 02:08:20,230
Sun come up.
Worst case scenario,

2912
02:08:20,231 --> 02:08:22,630
you one of the coolest guys of all time,
loved by millions,

2913
02:08:22,930 --> 02:08:25,140
and your son has just turned out to be
evil.

2914
02:08:25,190 --> 02:08:26,500
Went to the dark side.
Happens.

2915
02:08:26,530 --> 02:08:27,011
Oh,
by the way,

2916
02:08:27,011 --> 02:08:29,710
you had a son with Princess Leia.
So you get the fuck Princess Leia.

2917
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:31,630
You know what you think?
A match made in heaven.

2918
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:36,790
He's super heroic.
Swashbuckler with a giant big foot by

2919
02:08:36,791 --> 02:08:41,710
side during the hot princess and they
get together and fuck and they make an

2920
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:44,890
evil baby that winds up killing Danny.
That's bullshit.

2921
02:08:44,950 --> 02:08:45,580
That is bullshit.

2922
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:50,050
How much did it make you laugh when?
When that guy finally took off,

2923
02:08:50,051 --> 02:08:52,360
his Adam driver finally took off a
helmet and you're like,

2924
02:08:52,450 --> 02:08:54,830
fuck,
as a beautiful Semitic man.

2925
02:08:56,330 --> 02:08:58,570
He looked like an awesome magician.
Oh my God.

2926
02:08:59,200 --> 02:09:03,840
There was giggling where it's like you
as medic man.

2927
02:09:03,850 --> 02:09:05,030
He's gorgeous.
And that's.

2928
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:06,760
There's no way those.
There was parents.

2929
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:09,010
He's a gorgeous jus.
Wow.

2930
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,720
Alright.
It's hot for that guy.

2931
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:12,010
What's his name?
Kylo Ren.

2932
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:15,460
So his name that was choppy James made
me back me up on that.

2933
02:09:15,461 --> 02:09:17,680
That was ridiculous.
And he pulls off his helmet was this

2934
02:09:17,681 --> 02:09:19,090
evil guy.
And let me back you up.

2935
02:09:19,091 --> 02:09:19,721
I'm right here,
Bro.

2936
02:09:19,721 --> 02:09:21,700
I'm not leaving you alone.
You didn't think that was done?

2937
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:22,553
Oh,
it was ridiculous.

2938
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:25,010
Perfect hair.
How does your hair stay perfect and

2939
02:09:25,011 --> 02:09:26,020
that.
Why isn't it sweaty?

2940
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:28,930
There'd be no.
He's a full helmet.

2941
02:09:29,050 --> 02:09:30,010
He's a beautiful head of hair.

2942
02:09:30,010 --> 02:09:32,180
As soon as you pull it off,
it's like you just got to have a blow

2943
02:09:32,181 --> 02:09:36,550
out because he got his hair all blown
out like he's on the set.

2944
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:39,460
You know he pulls this sweaty fucking
metal helmet off.

2945
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:41,080
Do you?
I want you to be sweating in that stupid

2946
02:09:41,081 --> 02:09:43,420
thing where you're up killing people.
I mean,

2947
02:09:43,421 --> 02:09:45,040
he's killing people.
He's running around.

2948
02:09:45,041 --> 02:09:48,670
He's grabbing them and crushing them.
He's hacking things up with his fucking

2949
02:09:48,671 --> 02:09:49,580
sword.
Remember that

2950
02:09:51,430 --> 02:09:53,410
beautiful,
beautiful man.

2951
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:56,800
That's that Chris says Leah and fucking
if that guy,

2952
02:09:56,801 --> 02:09:58,060
what's his name?
What's that guy's name?

2953
02:09:58,061 --> 02:10:00,970
Who's the actor?
Harrison Ford did not give birth to

2954
02:10:00,971 --> 02:10:01,990
that.
Listen,

2955
02:10:01,991 --> 02:10:04,930
if that guy acts like a dick to girls
and just bang,

2956
02:10:04,931 --> 02:10:06,610
someone ever calls them back.
It's not as fault.

2957
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:07,510
No,
it's not his fault.

2958
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:09,250
Look at him.
He's got powers,

2959
02:10:09,460 --> 02:10:11,410
gets super powers.
The force is strong with him.

2960
02:10:11,680 --> 02:10:13,600
Like for real.
Like the forced to bank checks.

2961
02:10:13,870 --> 02:10:15,850
It's very strong.
He might've abuse it.

2962
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:20,470
He could get away from him driving it
before we do this take.

2963
02:10:20,550 --> 02:10:21,550
Yeah,
it's beautiful.

2964
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:25,360
It's a ridiculous movie,
but I loved it.

2965
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:26,700
I do like the,
the,

2966
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:29,050
the theories of like there'll be
stormtroopers are like,

2967
02:10:29,051 --> 02:10:30,370
wait,
I'm not feeling this.

2968
02:10:30,371 --> 02:10:31,201
I liked it.
When they handle it,

2969
02:10:31,201 --> 02:10:31,740
it's like,
yeah,

2970
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:33,290
keep checks on them all the time.
One,

2971
02:10:33,291 --> 02:10:34,070
I don't know how this one got

2972
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:36,080
through.
Isn't it interesting that the first

2973
02:10:36,081 --> 02:10:40,190
storm trooper we see without a helmet,
black guy quit or you're saying the fuck

2974
02:10:40,580 --> 02:10:42,020
the first storm trooper?
No,

2975
02:10:42,050 --> 02:10:43,250
the first,
well the first quarter,

2976
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:46,900
but they didn't concentrate on the storm
trooper helmet maybe,

2977
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:49,940
but nobody paid attention to them were
the first one they pay attention to is a

2978
02:10:49,941 --> 02:10:53,090
black guy.
Interesting.

2979
02:10:54,170 --> 02:10:58,910
Diversity.
The version that is the case.

2980
02:10:58,911 --> 02:11:02,750
I think star wars is a case where you
could make the argument that even though

2981
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:06,140
they might have gone towards diversity,
they nailed it.

2982
02:11:06,610 --> 02:11:10,060
A woman's a perfect fucking stopping
girl and the man who's a storm trooper

2983
02:11:10,240 --> 02:11:14,420
was like the right race or the sun's
going to be like gender.

2984
02:11:14,450 --> 02:11:16,760
Both of them seemed totally fine,
honestly,

2985
02:11:16,761 --> 02:11:21,761
hoping that the fighter pilot and the
storm trooper had a gay affair because

2986
02:11:21,831 --> 02:11:23,480
it seemed like they were,
they were really close,

2987
02:11:24,860 --> 02:11:27,440
like the way they,
the way they hugged,

2988
02:11:27,500 --> 02:11:29,060
they had like a deep embrace.

2989
02:11:29,150 --> 02:11:30,070
Oh,
how you been man?

2990
02:11:30,250 --> 02:11:32,500
Deep embrace there was so happy to see
each other.

2991
02:11:32,510 --> 02:11:34,130
So happy.
It was a lot like,

2992
02:11:34,410 --> 02:11:36,920
um,
when that movie,

2993
02:11:36,921 --> 02:11:38,480
um,
uh,

2994
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:40,580
what does the cowboy movie when they go
gay,

2995
02:11:41,300 --> 02:11:42,680
Black Mountain,
brokeback mountain.

2996
02:11:42,860 --> 02:11:44,940
It's almost like when those who hadn't
seen each other for a while and they

2997
02:11:44,941 --> 02:11:46,880
just start,
do they make it out together and they

2998
02:11:46,881 --> 02:11:49,590
just dove into each other's arms and
went after it?

2999
02:11:49,930 --> 02:11:51,800
Yeah,
I mean they live through life and death

3000
02:11:51,801 --> 02:11:54,560
out there with laser beams and shit.
People shooting at them,

3001
02:11:54,561 --> 02:11:56,750
they survived a crash,
landed together.

3002
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:59,870
There's a bond with people,
they say that when people form

3003
02:11:59,871 --> 02:12:01,880
relationships after traumatic events,
like,

3004
02:12:01,980 --> 02:12:05,510
like if you met someone during nine
slash 11 and like you grabbed her,

3005
02:12:05,511 --> 02:12:07,130
come with me and you grabbed her hand
and you,

3006
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:10,130
you ran and you guys both barely got out
of the building and the building

3007
02:12:10,131 --> 02:12:14,600
collapsed and you gotten a car and got
away together and then she's crying and

3008
02:12:14,601 --> 02:12:15,660
she stays in your apartment.

3009
02:12:15,680 --> 02:12:18,470
You want it falling in love.
You are fucking relationship will be

3010
02:12:18,471 --> 02:12:22,550
super intense because it's always going
to be connected to this one,

3011
02:12:22,790 --> 02:12:26,150
like really powerful event.
Like Christie Brinkley apparently had a

3012
02:12:26,151 --> 02:12:29,270
situation like that when she was in a
helicopter crash with this dude and then

3013
02:12:29,271 --> 02:12:31,820
wound up marrying the dude and then it
fell apart.

3014
02:12:32,120 --> 02:12:35,810
It doesn't make it look live with them.
I just feel like we together baby,

3015
02:12:35,950 --> 02:12:39,830
we're supposed to survive this together
and the bond that you have because you

3016
02:12:39,831 --> 02:12:43,700
sort of imprint on this moment like you
ever go somewhere where like you had a

3017
02:12:43,701 --> 02:12:47,330
really bad time and year round that area
and even 10 years later you'll still

3018
02:12:47,331 --> 02:12:48,740
feel shitty about it.
I remember this,

3019
02:12:48,910 --> 02:12:50,780
yes.
Deep emotional connection with somebody

3020
02:12:50,781 --> 02:12:53,120
that's like,
I have emotional connections with clubs

3021
02:12:53,121 --> 02:12:55,640
where I bombed.
I go by like,

3022
02:12:55,670 --> 02:12:57,740
like if I went by some places in Boston
and be like,

3023
02:12:57,770 --> 02:13:00,390
Ooh,
I remember eating Dick up their

3024
02:13:01,630 --> 02:13:02,810
restaurant now you're like,
I can't,

3025
02:13:02,811 --> 02:13:03,280
I can't eat here.

3026
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:04,370
Yeah.
That's nothing.

3027
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:08,450
Like people can develop some serious
emotional connections to areas.

3028
02:13:08,530 --> 02:13:11,150
Had that Tom Cruise movie that was
actually good that nobody saw.

3029
02:13:11,440 --> 02:13:12,410
Oh,
was that good?

3030
02:13:12,470 --> 02:13:14,360
Oh yeah.
Where he kept going back in time.

3031
02:13:14,660 --> 02:13:16,390
Oh wait a minute.
Oh,

3032
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:18,080
that was really good.
Really good.

3033
02:13:18,110 --> 02:13:20,210
That was already given up on it from the
last one.

3034
02:13:20,211 --> 02:13:21,890
So.
But that was good and they handled

3035
02:13:21,891 --> 02:13:23,540
everything right.
Like that was happened.

3036
02:13:23,541 --> 02:13:24,520
This would happen.
You're like,

3037
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:25,393
oh,
there it is.

3038
02:13:25,420 --> 02:13:28,130
It is.
But he had that girl so they kept trying

3039
02:13:28,131 --> 02:13:29,690
to fall in love with.
I mean figure it out.

3040
02:13:30,050 --> 02:13:32,340
Oh,
if we get to this stage in yesterday,

3041
02:13:32,550 --> 02:13:35,580
she's going to will follow them up and
let's just stay here and stay in love as

3042
02:13:35,581 --> 02:13:38,280
long as possible.
That's beautiful.

3043
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:39,630
Yeah,
that's what I'd like.

3044
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:43,230
I ain't never got to work out like that.
Those aliens were cool.

3045
02:13:43,260 --> 02:13:44,790
They weren't really original.
Who?

3046
02:13:44,791 --> 02:13:46,500
Robot aliens.
They were weird.

3047
02:13:46,501 --> 02:13:50,060
Sorta mechanical,
transforming alien things that just like

3048
02:13:50,100 --> 02:13:52,260
they were.
They were awesome because they were so

3049
02:13:52,261 --> 02:13:55,110
creative.
Like I'd never seen anything that I go,

3050
02:13:55,111 --> 02:13:56,400
oh,
that's like this.

3051
02:13:56,401 --> 02:13:58,180
Yeah.
They dropped them like cannon balls and

3052
02:13:58,290 --> 02:13:58,831
the,
the ground.

3053
02:13:58,831 --> 02:13:59,680
They're just like these,
like,

3054
02:13:59,790 --> 02:14:03,480
like a squids,
like maybe the coolest aliens in a movie

3055
02:14:03,481 --> 02:14:05,070
ever.
I mean these people are shooting at them

3056
02:14:05,071 --> 02:14:05,551
and it's like,
Oh,

3057
02:14:05,551 --> 02:14:07,320
you guys are done.
You have no chance.

3058
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:09,120
Yeah.
They morphed and changed.

3059
02:14:09,930 --> 02:14:12,540
Maybe pull the video up so you could see
what that,

3060
02:14:12,541 --> 02:14:14,100
uh,
that scene was like because it's cool to

3061
02:14:14,101 --> 02:14:14,880
see the,
uh,

3062
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:19,880
that looks like an illustration to
Frank Frazetta looking thing.

3063
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:23,470
Do you know Frank Frazetta is no
heathen?

3064
02:14:24,070 --> 02:14:25,380
No.
Nothing.

3065
02:14:25,500 --> 02:14:30,500
Who is the customer is amazing artist
who used to do a Conan the barbarian.

3066
02:14:31,650 --> 02:14:32,220
Really?

3067
02:14:32,220 --> 02:14:33,480
Yeah.
Pull it before we go to this.

3068
02:14:33,481 --> 02:14:38,481
Pull up Frank Frazetta conant.
Just school this sad ban.

3069
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:41,650
Frank Frazetta Conan.
Wait,

3070
02:14:41,660 --> 02:14:43,380
wait.
See this image motherfucker.

3071
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:45,990
This guy was the shit.
And like the seventies.

3072
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:48,750
Oh Wow.
Go with the one right next to it,

3073
02:14:48,751 --> 02:14:51,300
to the left of that.
That's the classic one.

3074
02:14:51,330 --> 02:14:55,050
Go full screen on that.
That's a classic classic.

3075
02:14:55,180 --> 02:14:58,260
So that's a real barbarian do.
That's Conan the barbarian.

3076
02:14:58,261 --> 02:15:00,570
That's what got me into those with a
girl,

3077
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:04,360
a naked woman at his feet.
I was standing on top of Jesus.

3078
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:09,000
The blood and bones and meat bones.
Got a hot girl.

3079
02:15:09,001 --> 02:15:12,360
Doesn't give a fuck.
She's a lying on the blood while he's

3080
02:15:12,361 --> 02:15:15,480
got a sword in.
Just want to hold onto your reasons.

3081
02:15:15,570 --> 02:15:18,630
He's covered in scars too.
It's got scars all over his face,

3082
02:15:18,631 --> 02:15:22,980
all over his arms.
That was what got me into Conan these

3083
02:15:22,981 --> 02:15:26,760
images by Frank Frazetta because they
created this superman,

3084
02:15:26,761 --> 02:15:30,690
the Sumerian barbarian who loves having
girls.

3085
02:15:30,691 --> 02:15:32,670
That has.
Of course he does.

3086
02:15:32,730 --> 02:15:35,370
That's the only reason why to fight with
a sword son.

3087
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:37,970
Whilst if y'all can't get pussy,
they understood it back then.

3088
02:15:38,010 --> 02:15:39,780
Let's go to this one right now.
Sexist,

3089
02:15:39,810 --> 02:15:40,643
go.

3090
02:15:42,380 --> 02:15:45,810
Bam.
Sexism's alive.

3091
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:48,870
He came in her 34 times.
That's got double sticks out.

3092
02:15:49,110 --> 02:15:49,531
No,
that's.

3093
02:15:49,531 --> 02:15:52,260
Come all Jane.
She's got her,

3094
02:15:52,430 --> 02:15:55,950
her vagina is so full of cum.
It's like pushing forward on an

3095
02:15:55,970 --> 02:16:00,970
abdominal wall that can cause Hernias,
shoot and lows in her and killing

3096
02:16:02,551 --> 02:16:05,340
people.
Like that was back before they even knew

3097
02:16:05,341 --> 02:16:06,990
what six packs were.
And he had a six pack.

3098
02:16:06,991 --> 02:16:10,160
No one has six pack in the seventies.
That guy,

3099
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:13,450
they have perfect bodies.
They were bigger than any body builder.

3100
02:16:13,460 --> 02:16:15,120
Pretty cool.
Pretty cool paintings.

3101
02:16:15,240 --> 02:16:18,240
Well,
when Conan was played by Arnold

3102
02:16:18,240 --> 02:16:18,691
Schwartzenegger,
everybody,

3103
02:16:18,691 --> 02:16:20,520
like,
that's what everybody recognizes,

3104
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:21,470
you know?
But yeah.

3105
02:16:21,630 --> 02:16:24,630
Yeah.
But the character in the present

3106
02:16:24,680 --> 02:16:27,150
drawings was much more.
Here's was a closer to comic strip

3107
02:16:27,151 --> 02:16:27,871
before.
Oh No,

3108
02:16:27,871 --> 02:16:28,201
no,
no.

3109
02:16:28,201 --> 02:16:31,690
It was a book a of books by a guy named
Robert e Dot Howard.

3110
02:16:31,930 --> 02:16:34,090
And Robert Howard is this really
fascinating guy.

3111
02:16:34,090 --> 02:16:39,090
They did a movie about him and the dude
from one of those cop shows the guy

3112
02:16:39,311 --> 02:16:40,144
from,
um,

3113
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:42,400
you know what?
The dude from full metal jacket,

3114
02:16:43,180 --> 02:16:45,150
amazing actor from full metal jacket or
play.

3115
02:16:45,151 --> 02:16:48,510
The guy shot himself.
The guy will get bullied and everything.

3116
02:16:48,730 --> 02:16:50,200
He's amazing.
What is this fucking name?

3117
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:52,390
Vincent.
Sorry Vincent.

3118
02:16:52,600 --> 02:16:53,460
He's amazing.
He's,

3119
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:57,850
he's an amazing actor.
He wasn't going to say he's in it.

3120
02:16:58,570 --> 02:16:59,720
He's in a what?
A,

3121
02:17:00,940 --> 02:17:02,870
what the fuck are we just talk Conan?
Yeah,

3122
02:17:03,060 --> 02:17:03,880
going.
No,

3123
02:17:03,880 --> 02:17:05,470
he plays Robert Howard.
That's what it is.

3124
02:17:05,770 --> 02:17:09,550
He plays Robert e Dot Howard in a
biography on property.

3125
02:17:09,551 --> 02:17:12,040
Howard's life in a movie and I didn't
see the movie,

3126
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:16,000
but Robert Howard was supposed to be
this like really strange guy who lived

3127
02:17:16,001 --> 02:17:19,480
with his mom and he shot himself I think
when he was 36,

3128
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:21,520
so he had this like,
is that it?

3129
02:17:21,550 --> 02:17:22,420
The whole wide world.

3130
02:17:22,750 --> 02:17:25,780
He had some serious mental issues for
sure,

3131
02:17:25,781 --> 02:17:30,781
but he also,
he wasn't healthy and so he had imagined

3132
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:35,320
this,
this superman,

3133
02:17:35,321 --> 02:17:40,321
this uber monch who was destroying
people back in this fictitious world

3134
02:17:40,841 --> 02:17:43,180
that he created that supposedly was a
long time ago,

3135
02:17:43,181 --> 02:17:44,230
but who knows,
you know,

3136
02:17:44,250 --> 02:17:48,430
it was like these,
these countries that never existed and

3137
02:17:48,431 --> 02:17:52,450
they were doing battle on this
witchcraft and demons and monsters.

3138
02:17:52,451 --> 02:17:54,760
And then there was this barbarian
usurper,

3139
02:17:54,761 --> 02:17:58,330
this king who became a king by killing
everything in his path.

3140
02:17:58,480 --> 02:18:01,150
He was like this indestructible man.
That's Conan the barbarian.

3141
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:04,420
And so Robert e Dot Howard sort of
created this guy who's the antithesis of

3142
02:18:04,421 --> 02:18:06,880
what he was.
He was as frail guy who lived with his

3143
02:18:06,881 --> 02:18:08,860
mom.
He's a pussy and just he,

3144
02:18:09,020 --> 02:18:14,020
he wrote his longing about this guy,
this lust for adventure thing.

3145
02:18:14,490 --> 02:18:17,440
Everything killed,
everything always survived.

3146
02:18:17,680 --> 02:18:22,680
He was just this uber man,
the greatest of all time is giant man.

3147
02:18:23,470 --> 02:18:27,010
And moved like a panther who like had a
mind,

3148
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:30,460
like a steel trap.
He would never show weakness.

3149
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:31,230
He'll,
you know,

3150
02:18:31,230 --> 02:18:33,220
he'll always was ready to die but never
did.

3151
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:36,790
So he wrote all these really bad ass
books.

3152
02:18:37,240 --> 02:18:40,060
They were really wild as probably now if
I read them and be like,

3153
02:18:40,061 --> 02:18:43,900
what am I reading?
But when I was 11 they were the shit

3154
02:18:43,960 --> 02:18:46,880
really stuff.
I'm sort of,

3155
02:18:46,881 --> 02:18:50,530
I kind of like get.
It wasn't like he put his hard cock in

3156
02:18:50,531 --> 02:18:52,450
her gut and it wasn't like that kind of
stuff.

3157
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:54,220
It was like from antic,
you know,

3158
02:18:54,530 --> 02:18:58,140
like it was more about like cleaving
heads and,

3159
02:18:58,180 --> 02:19:03,180
and the Gore of him being covered with
Gore and bits of sinew cover the

3160
02:19:04,181 --> 02:19:08,190
glistening blade as a slices through the
attackers will,

3161
02:19:08,290 --> 02:19:09,700
you know,
and then they realize like how they

3162
02:19:09,701 --> 02:19:13,480
fucked up and try to do battle with
Conan and everybody died,

3163
02:19:13,510 --> 02:19:14,020
everybody dies.

3164
02:19:14,020 --> 02:19:17,410
But Conan,
but it was just this for a 12 year old

3165
02:19:17,411 --> 02:19:19,900
kid or whatever the fuck I was when I
guess I was probably like that age when

3166
02:19:19,901 --> 02:19:21,820
I got into it,
it was amazing.

3167
02:19:21,850 --> 02:19:23,100
It was like,
whew,

3168
02:19:23,390 --> 02:19:24,400
you know,
because you're a boy.

3169
02:19:24,610 --> 02:19:27,290
Like first of all,
no one's gonna let you see that you're

3170
02:19:27,291 --> 02:19:30,800
like a 12 year old boy.
They don't show it in movies.

3171
02:19:30,860 --> 02:19:32,330
They cut it.
Yeah.

3172
02:19:32,331 --> 02:19:34,790
You don't really even like today they
do.

3173
02:19:34,890 --> 02:19:36,680
Like today if you watched,
um,

3174
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:40,280
a recent barbarian movie,
like there was,

3175
02:19:40,281 --> 02:19:42,050
they would show.
You see Jason Mamoa.

3176
02:19:42,140 --> 02:19:45,470
Have you seen him play Konan?
He's the guy from game of thrones.

3177
02:19:45,550 --> 02:19:46,370
Oh,
the real tall one.

3178
02:19:46,370 --> 02:19:46,820
Yeah,
the,

3179
02:19:46,820 --> 02:19:49,820
well,
the really handsome guy that dies early.

3180
02:19:49,821 --> 02:19:52,760
This dude,
that dude is a cool motherfucker.

3181
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:56,660
I ran into him recently at whole foods.
He couldn't be cooler.

3182
02:19:56,661 --> 02:19:58,250
I've ran into with the UFC before too.

3183
02:19:58,400 --> 02:20:01,690
He's just a really nice,
really friendly guy who uh,

3184
02:20:01,730 --> 02:20:03,650
you want to hate him because he's a
little too beautiful.

3185
02:20:03,980 --> 02:20:05,510
Little too beautiful,
a little too tall.

3186
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:09,530
But he was my favorite all time Conan
because he,

3187
02:20:10,050 --> 02:20:11,600
that's what Kona is supposed to be
built.

3188
02:20:11,601 --> 02:20:13,850
Like maybe we'll do it on TV show now.
He did a movie.

3189
02:20:13,851 --> 02:20:16,640
It was really,
it was kind of a shit movie

3190
02:20:16,970 --> 02:20:19,250
unfortunately.
But um,

3191
02:20:19,400 --> 02:20:20,930
it's cool to watch anyway.
I enjoyed it.

3192
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:22,310
But Tim is going in.
Yeah,

3193
02:20:22,370 --> 02:20:25,730
he's a good size for Kona and like that
would be like with Conan would be built

3194
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:28,460
well you'd have a chance to win like
everyone of your hand to hand combat

3195
02:20:28,461 --> 02:20:29,031
battles.
Yeah.

3196
02:20:29,031 --> 02:20:32,150
He wouldn't be built like Arnold
Schwarzenegger if you look at the data

3197
02:20:32,151 --> 02:20:33,120
drawing.
So like go to the,

3198
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:35,260
the [inaudible] with the sword again,
the St,

3199
02:20:35,270 --> 02:20:37,390
the classic one.
It's a little bit over there right there

3200
02:20:37,391 --> 02:20:37,880
apparently.

3201
02:20:37,880 --> 02:20:41,180
So like the real Kona is like a little
more built in him,

3202
02:20:41,510 --> 02:20:44,780
but that's probably because a homeboys
on the couch.

3203
02:20:45,380 --> 02:20:46,091
No,
Jason,

3204
02:20:46,091 --> 02:20:47,750
my mom was like,
that's actually what he's really built,

3205
02:20:47,751 --> 02:20:51,590
like sports and Agora was filled with 32
pounds,

3206
02:20:51,630 --> 02:20:53,860
the Mexicans supplements and then give
them time.

3207
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:55,760
You know,
when he played killing enemy,

3208
02:20:55,820 --> 02:20:58,570
nobody's built like that when he was
Conan.

3209
02:20:58,600 --> 02:21:01,250
I mean he had the most ridiculous
fucking body.

3210
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:06,100
Schwartzenegger was number one in the
world body.

3211
02:21:06,470 --> 02:21:10,010
Well he's slimmed down though.
He slimmed down towards the other ones

3212
02:21:10,011 --> 02:21:12,530
like you see Kinda tell a difference
between that one and the other one that

3213
02:21:12,531 --> 02:21:14,960
you just had those monster huge.
It's so big.

3214
02:21:15,110 --> 02:21:16,880
And by the way that's small,
like right there,

3215
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:22,040
like that's very slim in comparison.
Like that's a guy who is slimming down.

3216
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:24,330
Like that guy is built like tyron what?

3217
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:27,050
The body of the drawings.
Yeah,

3218
02:21:27,051 --> 02:21:28,250
that's perfect.
Actually.

3219
02:21:28,460 --> 02:21:30,110
That must have been one of the later
movies.

3220
02:21:30,590 --> 02:21:33,640
So I think like he went from being the
bigger bodybuilder.

3221
02:21:33,650 --> 02:21:37,460
It looks so weird to see him with that
fucking chest and the sword and a

3222
02:21:37,461 --> 02:21:40,130
backwards baseball cap on backwards
baseball hat.

3223
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:43,490
Right.
Was like a little it go back up.

3224
02:21:43,970 --> 02:21:46,550
Does he really have one yet?
Backers that almost looks like,

3225
02:21:46,551 --> 02:21:48,930
but it's a Bandana.
It could be a bag.

3226
02:21:48,990 --> 02:21:53,090
You can be like a hillbilly with a sword
who's really yolked really old

3227
02:21:53,460 --> 02:21:55,790
hillbilly.
Slimmed down.

3228
02:21:55,791 --> 02:21:57,720
He was still massive,
you know,

3229
02:21:57,770 --> 02:22:00,950
even when he got smaller.
But if you go back to is bodybuilding

3230
02:22:00,951 --> 02:22:03,860
days when he was Mr Olympia.
Holy Shit.

3231
02:22:04,250 --> 02:22:09,250
He in my opinion,
out of all like the bodybuilders styles,

3232
02:22:09,440 --> 02:22:10,910
like there's a bunch of different
styles.

3233
02:22:10,911 --> 02:22:13,910
Like now guys are just massive and
shredded.

3234
02:22:14,570 --> 02:22:18,110
Yeah.
Well that guy is the guy on the left is

3235
02:22:18,550 --> 02:22:21,770
the foxes multiple time.
Mr Olympia,

3236
02:22:22,010 --> 02:22:23,660
what the Hell's his name?
Because it has legs.

3237
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:26,040
It'll gross.
What is

3238
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:27,390
his name?
God dammit.

3239
02:22:27,420 --> 02:22:28,380
Jamie,
what does it say?

3240
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:31,260
Ronnie Coleman.
So that's not real.

3241
02:22:31,530 --> 02:22:33,480
Ronnie Coleman was many years later.
Right?

3242
02:22:34,380 --> 02:22:36,570
So that's just a comparison to the two
of them.

3243
02:22:36,780 --> 02:22:37,231
Oh,
I see.

3244
02:22:37,231 --> 02:22:41,790
Okay.
See if you it back up again.

3245
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:43,680
Go back to that image again,
please.

3246
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:46,250
That's really amazing there.
Yeah,

3247
02:22:46,710 --> 02:22:48,450
but if you go back to that image,
the one.

3248
02:22:48,510 --> 02:22:49,890
Yeah,
look at the difference in the legs.

3249
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:52,530
That's the real difference.
Ronnie Coleman's legs are massive.

3250
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:55,140
They're insane.
They don't seem real.

3251
02:22:55,380 --> 02:22:58,830
See Arnold seem ridiculously muscular as
well,

3252
02:22:58,831 --> 02:23:00,810
but real.
How does he wear shirts,

3253
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:04,440
Goldman,
either their waists or narrow.

3254
02:23:04,441 --> 02:23:05,810
Why would you were closer?
You're built like that.

3255
02:23:05,910 --> 02:23:10,110
Just walk around this little grape
smugglers all day just to let everybody

3256
02:23:10,111 --> 02:23:13,230
know what the fuck is up.
He can't stay like that for very long

3257
02:23:13,231 --> 02:23:14,670
either.
That's the other thing you have to

3258
02:23:14,671 --> 02:23:16,800
realize when you're looking at these
athletes.

3259
02:23:17,010 --> 02:23:18,670
Should I call them athletes?
Bodybuilders?

3260
02:23:18,830 --> 02:23:20,580
Yeah.
I think they're a little bit different

3261
02:23:20,581 --> 02:23:21,191
than an athlete.
I mean,

3262
02:23:21,191 --> 02:23:23,390
it's obviously what their muscles get
tired and they can't.

3263
02:23:23,970 --> 02:23:24,361
Well,
yeah,

3264
02:23:24,361 --> 02:23:25,770
they're,
they're in the state of massive

3265
02:23:25,771 --> 02:23:27,020
dehydration there.
Uh,

3266
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:31,500
they can't maintain that very long.
It's super dangerous when guys get,

3267
02:23:31,501 --> 02:23:32,590
um,
that,

3268
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:35,820
that dehydrated like that they can't
hang on for very long.

3269
02:23:36,570 --> 02:23:38,700
They don't have much endurance.
You know,

3270
02:23:38,740 --> 02:23:40,620
you're feeling really tired all the
time,

3271
02:23:40,860 --> 02:23:42,810
but that's how you get your skin really
thin.

3272
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:45,090
Like a lot of those guys,
when they do that,

3273
02:23:45,091 --> 02:23:46,680
they're fucking exhausted while they're
doing it,

3274
02:23:46,681 --> 02:23:51,681
but they maintain a good face and flex
just crazy what people do to their

3275
02:23:52,111 --> 02:23:54,600
bodies.
Like even then like you look at that,

3276
02:23:55,110 --> 02:23:59,220
which is big giant,
but they're the guys who are so much

3277
02:23:59,221 --> 02:24:01,850
bigger today.
Like you see them there

3278
02:24:03,810 --> 02:24:04,680
or something.
Trump.

3279
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:07,170
Who's the guy to the left?
Is that Franco Columbo?

3280
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:08,310
Because guys about to lose.

3281
02:24:11,170 --> 02:24:13,830
Some days we thought it had a future.
Well,

3282
02:24:13,831 --> 02:24:15,540
there's a lot of those guys that did
have a future.

3283
02:24:15,541 --> 02:24:19,230
They just never had a future like him,
but he's just said crazy ambitious

3284
02:24:19,231 --> 02:24:20,830
motherfucker.
You know her,

3285
02:24:20,831 --> 02:24:23,400
her burns bit about him.
No bird has a bit of a.

3286
02:24:23,430 --> 02:24:24,570
Oh yeah,
a great man.

3287
02:24:24,840 --> 02:24:27,000
That's right.
That's what after you bang is made.

3288
02:24:27,170 --> 02:24:28,460
Yeah.
No,

3289
02:24:28,660 --> 02:24:30,690
you can do all these things.
They tell them,

3290
02:24:30,691 --> 02:24:32,400
you can't come to America,
be a bodybuilder.

3291
02:24:32,401 --> 02:24:33,690
You're just some German.
You came,

3292
02:24:33,810 --> 02:24:36,590
you're going to win.
You won the biggest bodybuilder.

3293
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:37,770
Well,
you can't what?

3294
02:24:37,771 --> 02:24:38,800
You want to be a movie star?
No,

3295
02:24:38,810 --> 02:24:40,250
you can't be a movie star.
It's come on.

3296
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:42,010
You should work bodybuilding.
You can't say you did it.

3297
02:24:43,380 --> 02:24:44,161
Alright,
that's enough.

3298
02:24:44,161 --> 02:24:46,410
You've done enough with.
You're the biggest movie star in the

3299
02:24:46,411 --> 02:24:47,221
world.
All right,

3300
02:24:47,221 --> 02:24:48,300
well that's it.
Now stop.

3301
02:24:48,330 --> 02:24:50,880
You can't run California.
That's not allowed.

3302
02:24:50,970 --> 02:24:53,480
You're a movie star bodybuilder and all
you're doing.

3303
02:24:53,570 --> 02:24:55,770
You're doing it.
I bet.

3304
02:24:55,790 --> 02:24:59,160
Now you want to fuck it made of course.
Oh,

3305
02:24:59,400 --> 02:25:01,800
to the line.
That's what brought them down.

3306
02:25:02,140 --> 02:25:03,360
Yeah,
a great man.

3307
02:25:03,460 --> 02:25:06,720
A great man.
I think if they didn't have law against

3308
02:25:06,721 --> 02:25:09,600
it,
a law against it because he was born in

3309
02:25:09,601 --> 02:25:11,490
another country president.
He wasn't president.

3310
02:25:11,640 --> 02:25:14,220
I think he could be president now.
No bullshit.

3311
02:25:14,290 --> 02:25:16,380
He's too far removed from his face and
find a new woman,

3312
02:25:16,870 --> 02:25:20,520
new woman that really anchors them other
than the woman who is religious.

3313
02:25:20,730 --> 02:25:24,110
I mean she's not like crazy about it,
but there's something about Jesus's

3314
02:25:24,111 --> 02:25:25,630
teachings,
so it's really starting to appeal to

3315
02:25:25,631 --> 02:25:28,030
arnold as he gets older in life,
and then boom,

3316
02:25:28,031 --> 02:25:30,970
connects with that.
Report that data to get Jesus in real

3317
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,820
rural.
Pop it over to Jesus forgives.

3318
02:25:33,940 --> 02:25:38,140
You could get Jesus to just listen.
Jesus said some cool shit.

3319
02:25:38,380 --> 02:25:39,370
Okay.
He just did.

3320
02:25:39,460 --> 02:25:40,630
He really did.
He did some cool.

3321
02:25:40,680 --> 02:25:42,910
If it was a real guy,
which is debatable,

3322
02:25:43,350 --> 02:25:44,860
right?
It's a lot of.

3323
02:25:45,220 --> 02:25:47,140
Not a lot of evidence that there was a
real guy.

3324
02:25:47,270 --> 02:25:50,800
I wrote about him and Tom Joad.
Did they know what else they write about

3325
02:25:50,801 --> 02:25:54,720
dragons?
Anything about witches and demons?

3326
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:55,721
No.
No.

3327
02:25:55,721 --> 02:25:58,210
It's not the one that tells you if you
jerking off.

3328
02:25:58,700 --> 02:25:59,620
No.
Oh,

3329
02:25:59,621 --> 02:26:00,454
the other one?
Yeah.

3330
02:26:00,730 --> 02:26:02,800
Okay.
I don't know.

3331
02:26:02,830 --> 02:26:04,330
What do you think?
I think it was real.

3332
02:26:04,540 --> 02:26:06,410
I think they did have historical
evidence for them,

3333
02:26:07,030 --> 02:26:08,430
but not the powers.
Now they're walking,

3334
02:26:08,450 --> 02:26:09,910
I'm walking.
You ever seen that movie?

3335
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:12,710
There's a lot of shit.
It's like,

3336
02:26:12,730 --> 02:26:13,780
okay.
Before the internet,

3337
02:26:13,781 --> 02:26:16,990
you remember those videos of that Sensei
who's like trying to rush me and just

3338
02:26:16,991 --> 02:26:19,420
with one finger who draws people back
and they'll fly,

3339
02:26:19,421 --> 02:26:20,410
but it's clearly faked.

3340
02:26:20,890 --> 02:26:22,390
Before,
there were videos of that,

3341
02:26:22,780 --> 02:26:23,880
they were just,
dude,

3342
02:26:23,890 --> 02:26:27,190
I heard this guy can knock off any
attacker with one finger and I don't

3343
02:26:27,191 --> 02:26:28,960
have tv either.
So I don't know what's real.

3344
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:30,640
That's what Jesus does.
Jesus got big.

3345
02:26:30,730 --> 02:26:31,431
Well,
here's the thing,

3346
02:26:31,431 --> 02:26:33,500
people are telling stories about them.
The idea,

3347
02:26:33,550 --> 02:26:35,340
Jesus coming back from the dead,
right?

3348
02:26:35,380 --> 02:26:36,220
That was the big one,
right?

3349
02:26:36,370 --> 02:26:38,020
That was probably one of the biggest
ones he did.

3350
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:42,790
Um,
and then what it is later and then what

3351
02:26:42,791 --> 02:26:43,840
happens?
He goes away.

3352
02:26:43,990 --> 02:26:44,661
What happened?
So yeah,

3353
02:26:44,661 --> 02:26:46,030
I think he just cut.
They're like,

3354
02:26:46,060 --> 02:26:47,740
oh look,
his body's not in here.

3355
02:26:47,770 --> 02:26:52,480
He must've come back from the dead.
He couldn't be that hyenas eight his

3356
02:26:52,481 --> 02:26:55,510
body or anything right now.
Or somebody just would grave rob,

3357
02:26:55,511 --> 02:26:58,070
why don't you leave a body out and no,
no,

3358
02:26:58,210 --> 02:26:58,710
no,
no,

3359
02:26:58,710 --> 02:26:59,920
he's,
he's back up again.

3360
02:27:00,310 --> 02:27:03,190
And then he went to heaven.
So he came back to life once a heaven.

3361
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:04,233
Jamie,
do you know,

3362
02:27:04,540 --> 02:27:06,460
put him in a tomb.
They put them into them right in front.

3363
02:27:06,580 --> 02:27:09,040
And three days later the rockers moved
and people's,

3364
02:27:09,100 --> 02:27:11,020
someone saw him go up into heaven,
full body.

3365
02:27:11,050 --> 02:27:12,160
Oh,
this lion bitch.

3366
02:27:12,370 --> 02:27:14,750
So Dome of the Rock is worse,
still went up to heaven.

3367
02:27:14,770 --> 02:27:17,050
You know who saw him?
Those lesbians in that club,

3368
02:27:18,070 --> 02:27:19,310
Vancouver,
they were their,

3369
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:22,190
their,
their account is totally tribunals.

3370
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:24,440
Have too much power.
Yeah.

3371
02:27:24,460 --> 02:27:28,180
If you had a Canadian tribunals to
discover whether or not Jesus ever came

3372
02:27:28,181 --> 02:27:30,850
back to life,
I just think if you came back to life

3373
02:27:31,120 --> 02:27:32,770
should probably stick around.
Talk to people.

3374
02:27:33,070 --> 02:27:34,510
Let them know that you did it.
Look,

3375
02:27:34,511 --> 02:27:36,730
I'm so for real.
You guys crucified me?

3376
02:27:36,790 --> 02:27:37,660
Not Again,
bitch.

3377
02:27:37,690 --> 02:27:39,550
Come at me this time.
I'm going to use my magic.

3378
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,380
I'm here to fix you guys.
Come on,

3379
02:27:41,620 --> 02:27:43,390
die for your sentence.
Get it together.

3380
02:27:43,391 --> 02:27:44,290
Bitches.
Nope.

3381
02:27:44,500 --> 02:27:47,350
Removing anything we know is not true
from that.

3382
02:27:47,410 --> 02:27:48,470
How do you know it's not true?
Well,

3383
02:27:48,471 --> 02:27:49,870
no shit.
From what you know,

3384
02:27:50,020 --> 02:27:54,760
let's say a atheist or agnostic.
That's the guy who got strung up for

3385
02:27:54,910 --> 02:27:57,250
saying he was a messiah,
which he wasn't the only one at a time

3386
02:27:57,251 --> 02:28:01,360
thing is messiah.
He got strung up for it and he died and

3387
02:28:01,390 --> 02:28:05,320
the followers had to keep hope alive and
whatever they did,

3388
02:28:05,321 --> 02:28:08,570
they did,
but like if it was a real person,

3389
02:28:08,571 --> 02:28:09,161
then it's like,
yeah,

3390
02:28:09,161 --> 02:28:10,030
he got,
he got killed.

3391
02:28:10,031 --> 02:28:11,560
Like a lot of people.
Well,

3392
02:28:11,650 --> 02:28:16,000
it's so hard.
It's so hard to recount the truth in an

3393
02:28:16,001 --> 02:28:18,460
accurate way from things you've actually
experienced.

3394
02:28:18,490 --> 02:28:21,080
Yeah.
Now I'm managing the god out of it.

3395
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:22,190
Those still.
But imagine

3396
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:27,190
those stories of whoever he was counted
down and in and re retold by people that

3397
02:28:30,140 --> 02:28:33,500
barely remember the word innovation.
They weren't even the region.

3398
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:36,710
They added their own bullshit to it.
Like people do the added their own

3399
02:28:36,711 --> 02:28:38,480
spice.
They have their own rules,

3400
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:43,340
their out of their own happy ending or
sad ending or consequences of said

3401
02:28:43,341 --> 02:28:44,580
action,
you know,

3402
02:28:44,660 --> 02:28:47,570
and Jesus said,
if you do not cover from your eyes to

3403
02:28:47,571 --> 02:28:49,130
your,
to your ankles,

3404
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:52,790
you shall be stoned to death and the
dishonor telling like you people just

3405
02:28:52,791 --> 02:28:53,840
add shit.
Right?

3406
02:28:54,020 --> 02:28:57,140
Who knows what the original message was
and who the fuck it was that came up

3407
02:28:57,141 --> 02:28:58,880
with it.
It might've been to some really cool

3408
02:28:58,881 --> 02:29:02,240
dude wanted everybody to get along and
so they decided to kill this fucker

3409
02:29:02,241 --> 02:29:05,030
because he's talking shit.
Imagine if the Romans came to town.

3410
02:29:05,031 --> 02:29:08,780
They got their swords and ready to kick
some ass and this fucking hippie is over

3411
02:29:08,781 --> 02:29:10,130
here talking some stupid shit.

3412
02:29:10,130 --> 02:29:10,491
No,
dude,

3413
02:29:10,491 --> 02:29:11,780
we're here to kill people.
Okay.

3414
02:29:12,020 --> 02:29:14,210
We're just going to nail you to this
cross like we do.

3415
02:29:14,211 --> 02:29:16,700
Thousands of other fucking people.
As a matter of fact,

3416
02:29:16,701 --> 02:29:19,970
they had.
What was the story that there's a story

3417
02:29:19,971 --> 02:29:24,971
in history on fire that Danieli Bull Lee
talks about where the Romans,

3418
02:29:25,250 --> 02:29:29,840
they put miles and miles of crucified
bodies on this road.

3419
02:29:29,870 --> 02:29:31,280
I can get my thrones.
Dude.

3420
02:29:31,281 --> 02:29:33,800
It's horrific.
When he recounts it,

3421
02:29:34,040 --> 02:29:38,360
it's horrific and they did that.
So why would they give a shit about

3422
02:29:38,361 --> 02:29:42,170
doing this to one other dude will let
them do whatever they want.

3423
02:29:42,190 --> 02:29:43,880
Because.
So if you were in the town,

3424
02:29:43,881 --> 02:29:46,280
and this is one cool guy wants everybody
to get along and you're like,

3425
02:29:46,281 --> 02:29:47,660
man,
I'm glad Jesus is here.

3426
02:29:47,661 --> 02:29:49,220
He's talking sense.
You know,

3427
02:29:49,221 --> 02:29:50,540
we really should listen to him.
I'm like,

3428
02:29:50,541 --> 02:29:52,490
why are we being assholes?
We really do.

3429
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:54,760
We appreciate our,
our,

3430
02:29:54,850 --> 02:29:57,410
our surroundings and,
and love each other like brothers and

3431
02:29:57,411 --> 02:29:57,950
sisters.

3432
02:29:57,950 --> 02:29:58,691
Oh Shit,
dude.

3433
02:29:58,691 --> 02:30:01,420
The Romans look over the hill.
Fuck,

3434
02:30:01,730 --> 02:30:03,940
and you look over the hill and you see
dust and horses.

3435
02:30:04,340 --> 02:30:09,340
Thousands of them coming forth.
This dude's gonna step up and try to

3436
02:30:09,820 --> 02:30:10,710
talk,
laid down and

3437
02:30:12,530 --> 02:30:15,080
chop his fucking dick off and stuff it
up his nose.

3438
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:17,540
They're monsters.
That's why I love game of thrones.

3439
02:30:17,541 --> 02:30:18,860
They don't fuck around.
They're not like.

3440
02:30:18,980 --> 02:30:21,380
They were just like,
this is how it would be a bunch of loose

3441
02:30:21,381 --> 02:30:22,490
cannons.
Oh yeah.

3442
02:30:23,360 --> 02:30:24,130
No,
no.

3443
02:30:24,130 --> 02:30:29,130
Government oversight.
Die Cellphone reason why take the chance

3444
02:30:29,710 --> 02:30:34,710
of sorts to die by the sword heads and
fucking arms get lopped off.

3445
02:30:35,150 --> 02:30:36,620
Well,
I've always hated the crossbow.

3446
02:30:36,700 --> 02:30:39,260
Takes too long to reload to bullshit
weapon.

3447
02:30:39,770 --> 02:30:41,040
It really is.
Crossbows,

3448
02:30:41,090 --> 02:30:43,340
we're putting the kid a fucking bow,
folks.

3449
02:30:44,040 --> 02:30:45,890
A real bone out.
Does that make you mad?

3450
02:30:45,891 --> 02:30:48,200
Walking dead and it makes me mad.

3451
02:30:48,430 --> 02:30:49,280
No,
it makes me mad.

3452
02:30:49,281 --> 02:30:50,081
The walking dead.
I.

3453
02:30:50,081 --> 02:30:53,180
He's one of the coolest college.
How does that fucking Arrow not get a

3454
02:30:53,181 --> 02:30:54,710
pass through?
Okay.

3455
02:30:54,890 --> 02:30:57,300
He's shooting people in the bodies.
He should always.

3456
02:30:58,220 --> 02:30:59,960
It always sticks out and he pulls it
right out.

3457
02:31:00,230 --> 02:31:03,380
Listen man,
I ruined three or four hours a week,

3458
02:31:03,470 --> 02:31:05,700
a week.
This guy has been out there.

3459
02:31:05,701 --> 02:31:08,480
It's finding new arrows.
I shoot a lot of arrows and sometimes

3460
02:31:08,481 --> 02:31:12,470
when I'm practicing with the New Georgia
new releases,

3461
02:31:12,471 --> 02:31:16,480
I'm practicing a new archer releases.
Sometimes I hit rocks and shit and they

3462
02:31:16,481 --> 02:31:20,280
just break break.
I'm exaggerating the amount per hit a

3463
02:31:20,281 --> 02:31:23,750
rock on purpose.
It just destroys the arrows.

3464
02:31:23,790 --> 02:31:26,190
The arrows going too fast just shatters
and explodes.

3465
02:31:26,340 --> 02:31:28,950
But my point being like,
this guy has the same goddamn arrows.

3466
02:31:28,970 --> 02:31:29,700
Like,
where's he?

3467
02:31:29,700 --> 02:31:30,900
These arrows are gone,
dude.

3468
02:31:30,901 --> 02:31:32,940
You shot a hundred zombies anymore.

3469
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,020
Arrows.
You just don't.

3470
02:31:34,021 --> 02:31:35,670
You're not going to pull them out.
They're going to be perfect.

3471
02:31:35,820 --> 02:31:37,290
First of all,
you have field points and that's

3472
02:31:37,291 --> 02:31:37,951
bullshit.
Anyway.

3473
02:31:37,951 --> 02:31:39,330
You don't even have broad heads.
Again,

3474
02:31:39,440 --> 02:31:44,440
I make to put a little pinhole in.
It just shoots him in the head,

3475
02:31:45,060 --> 02:31:46,740
you know,
and it just sticks right in there

3476
02:31:46,741 --> 02:31:49,650
magically and he pulls it right out.
Like what are their heads made of?

3477
02:31:49,700 --> 02:31:51,400
Yeah,
I know the long and where did they.

3478
02:31:51,450 --> 02:31:52,320
When they eat,
what?

3479
02:31:52,321 --> 02:31:54,140
What happens to the food?
They don't.

3480
02:31:54,290 --> 02:31:55,980
Their bodies don't still work in
process.

3481
02:31:55,981 --> 02:32:00,840
Stuff is way better off with a regular
bone arrow because irregular bone.

3482
02:32:00,841 --> 02:32:02,590
Our look,
you can make your own bone now.

3483
02:32:02,591 --> 02:32:04,830
That'd be better than that stupid
fucking crossbow.

3484
02:32:05,250 --> 02:32:06,930
You.
You want something?

3485
02:32:06,931 --> 02:32:09,210
You can just load up like that and keep
shooting.

3486
02:32:09,211 --> 02:32:11,550
You can shoot several times.
That stupid thing.

3487
02:32:11,550 --> 02:32:13,200
You've got to grab it.
You've got to pull it.

3488
02:32:13,350 --> 02:32:16,230
People just like it because it looks
like Chewbacca his gun in Star Wars.

3489
02:32:16,650 --> 02:32:18,690
It's some old school shit like you
think,

3490
02:32:18,700 --> 02:32:20,400
oh,
that's even better than no bone marrow.

3491
02:32:20,430 --> 02:32:24,060
Bone ours way better than a crossbow.
Unless you're a pussy.

3492
02:32:24,420 --> 02:32:26,070
You don't want to learn how to shoot a
bow and arrow.

3493
02:32:26,370 --> 02:32:30,090
They should buy walking dead with her
actual bow and Arrow had those guys butt

3494
02:32:30,091 --> 02:32:30,721
heads.
I mean,

3495
02:32:30,721 --> 02:32:32,850
it's not a bad weapon.
If you want to kill something,

3496
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:34,590
like if you want to use it,
like if you,

3497
02:32:34,591 --> 02:32:37,530
if you're in a deer blind and you're
trying to kill a deer and you want to

3498
02:32:37,531 --> 02:32:38,910
show someone how to do it with a
crossbow,

3499
02:32:38,940 --> 02:32:41,960
it's a great weapon for that because
it's really easy to do everything.

3500
02:32:42,020 --> 02:32:44,270
Sebastian's pit about bow and arrow.
No,

3501
02:32:44,670 --> 02:32:45,503
he's got a good bit.

3502
02:32:45,660 --> 02:32:47,630
Don't tell me.
Don't say don't say don't say I don't

3503
02:32:47,631 --> 02:32:50,100
want it to go.
Okay.

3504
02:32:50,230 --> 02:32:52,920
I'll trailer.
A lot of his act outs are so good.

3505
02:32:54,630 --> 02:32:58,740
He's such a good dude too.
It's cool seeing a guy like him.

3506
02:32:59,140 --> 02:33:01,980
You've got to look it up.
I don't want to play it.

3507
02:33:02,750 --> 02:33:03,840
It is,
yeah.

3508
02:33:03,841 --> 02:33:05,850
I'll find it later.
But for,

3509
02:33:05,880 --> 02:33:08,570
for folks listening co go,
go check it out.

3510
02:33:08,571 --> 02:33:10,880
But I mean like most people don't
actually have a bow and Arrow,

3511
02:33:10,881 --> 02:33:15,881
so if anyone would like this bit is
these fucking funny man.

3512
02:33:16,750 --> 02:33:19,180
And he's a really nice guy too.
That's cool.

3513
02:33:19,290 --> 02:33:20,910
He's one of those guys where everybody
likes him.

3514
02:33:21,150 --> 02:33:22,830
I've never heard anybody doesn't like
Sebastian.

3515
02:33:23,230 --> 02:33:25,600
You know?
One person doesn't like Sebastian.

3516
02:33:25,601 --> 02:33:26,434
Yeah.
Ever.

3517
02:33:26,740 --> 02:33:28,350
No.
No.

3518
02:33:28,380 --> 02:33:30,970
That's why it's cool to just,
yeah,

3519
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:33,960
this is just a.
But he's also a guy that like really

3520
02:33:33,961 --> 02:33:35,490
worked hard.
That guy,

3521
02:33:35,610 --> 02:33:36,570
he hustled,
man.

3522
02:33:36,571 --> 02:33:39,360
He made it happen for himself.
He kept getting better,

3523
02:33:39,480 --> 02:33:42,210
but
that was his catchphrase.

3524
02:33:43,470 --> 02:33:46,920
Couldn't do that without doing that.
He came in and did a podcast and he was

3525
02:33:46,921 --> 02:33:48,760
fucking hilarious.
He's hilarious.

3526
02:33:48,780 --> 02:33:51,360
He was really so like particular.
Yeah.

3527
02:33:51,450 --> 02:33:52,830
Yeah.
Very particular.

3528
02:33:53,430 --> 02:33:56,100
Like what's going on with your
fingernails?

3529
02:33:57,920 --> 02:33:59,650
It looks and it just bothers them.
Or like what?

3530
02:33:59,651 --> 02:34:00,041
What,
what,

3531
02:34:00,041 --> 02:34:01,050
what is this?
What is this?

3532
02:34:01,170 --> 02:34:02,820
Paint your fingernails.

3533
02:34:05,080 --> 02:34:08,070
Yeah.
He's another guy that has like a very

3534
02:34:08,071 --> 02:34:10,090
specific style.
His clean.

3535
02:34:12,060 --> 02:34:13,440
Think about it,
man.

3536
02:34:13,500 --> 02:34:14,850
I don't know.
Think about it.

3537
02:34:15,180 --> 02:34:16,390
No,
I got it.

3538
02:34:16,420 --> 02:34:18,580
I'm going to say no.
I've seen them before.

3539
02:34:18,610 --> 02:34:21,270
Maybe just one of those crowd work,
but it's crowded because everything's.

3540
02:34:21,300 --> 02:34:23,770
He lifts everybody up instead of shirts.
Gross.

3541
02:34:23,780 --> 02:34:24,521
He goes,
that's shirts.

3542
02:34:24,521 --> 02:34:27,790
Amazing.
Couldn't never get away with that shirt.

3543
02:34:27,850 --> 02:34:30,020
Look at how gorgeous this guy.
There's.

3544
02:34:30,040 --> 02:34:31,780
Smile.
You got all your teeth fixed,

3545
02:34:31,781 --> 02:34:33,130
Huh?
Beautiful.

3546
02:34:34,300 --> 02:34:37,660
He takes the opposite end of it and just
get get the money out of just being

3547
02:34:37,661 --> 02:34:38,980
positive.
That's interesting.

3548
02:34:39,310 --> 02:34:40,780
That's in that sense.
Maybe.

3549
02:34:40,820 --> 02:34:42,130
Yeah.
Maybe that sense.

3550
02:34:42,460 --> 02:34:45,280
Which is the act.
Exactly the exact opposite of what I

3551
02:34:45,281 --> 02:34:48,060
used to love about watching dies in the
or just hurting people.

3552
02:34:48,310 --> 02:34:49,360
There'd be a guy.
He goes,

3553
02:34:49,361 --> 02:34:51,070
look at you,
look at you.

3554
02:34:51,100 --> 02:34:55,880
The last piece of pussy you saw is the
last piece of pussy over Africa.

3555
02:34:56,620 --> 02:34:58,450
Trust me,
trust me.

3556
02:34:58,451 --> 02:35:01,600
It's over.
He would have a cigarette.

3557
02:35:01,660 --> 02:35:04,320
It's sophie.
Who's going to fuck you gonna.

3558
02:35:04,420 --> 02:35:06,820
Fuck though.
Victory Shits on you,

3559
02:35:06,821 --> 02:35:09,100
but leave.
Who's going to fuck you?

3560
02:35:09,480 --> 02:35:12,580
You're going to pay for it.
You're going to be sad.

3561
02:35:12,581 --> 02:35:14,660
You're going to fall in love with the
hookah.

3562
02:35:15,730 --> 02:35:18,760
Bring him into your life in Sydney.
Meanwhile,

3563
02:35:18,761 --> 02:35:23,380
all the time she's getting God looking.
He would just go deep,

3564
02:35:24,760 --> 02:35:26,950
but it was fun.
Like it was theater.

3565
02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:28,690
It was theater.
It didn't seem real,

3566
02:35:28,750 --> 02:35:29,550
right?
No,

3567
02:35:29,550 --> 02:35:29,881
no,
no,

3568
02:35:29,881 --> 02:35:30,230
no,
no.

3569
02:35:30,230 --> 02:35:34,420
It's it's theater like it's a character
that's doing this mean act.

3570
02:35:34,720 --> 02:35:38,380
When you act like yourself on stage,
people feel way more like how dare you,

3571
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:40,900
but when it's complete character or a
movie where it's like dissolve,

3572
02:35:40,960 --> 02:35:42,330
definitely not true.
So it's okay.

3573
02:35:42,350 --> 02:35:45,010
Just seems more like reality.
I think that's why people get mad or

3574
02:35:45,011 --> 02:35:45,844
more of stand up.

3575
02:35:45,890 --> 02:35:50,800
Look to the head.
Is that good?

3576
02:35:50,950 --> 02:35:52,420
Yeah.
She bowie dying.

3577
02:35:52,720 --> 02:35:54,610
Fuck.
What'd you think of him?

3578
02:35:54,950 --> 02:35:56,140
I loved him.
Yeah.

3579
02:35:56,380 --> 02:35:58,750
I saw the exhibit and Melbourne is Bowie
Exhibit.

3580
02:35:59,210 --> 02:36:01,000
He had multiple songs.
Yeah.

3581
02:36:01,030 --> 02:36:02,890
I just.
The way he dealt with like live

3582
02:36:02,891 --> 02:36:06,070
performance and like getting costumers,
like hitting the world's best customers.

3583
02:36:06,071 --> 02:36:08,320
Like I got to talk to you.
And then he were just like,

3584
02:36:08,350 --> 02:36:10,930
here's what I'm kind of doing now.
I want you to design something with me.

3585
02:36:11,500 --> 02:36:16,500
I forgive him for dancing in the street
to the street with him and Mick Jagger.

3586
02:36:18,310 --> 02:36:21,430
Forgive them.
I forgive them for arguably the most

3587
02:36:21,431 --> 02:36:25,360
confusing sexually.
It leads to a young man.

3588
02:36:25,361 --> 02:36:27,010
I'm like,
what is happening with

3589
02:36:28,660 --> 02:36:30,400
him and Mick Jagger?
I was like,

3590
02:36:30,401 --> 02:36:32,950
what is this message?
You're confusing the fuck out of me.

3591
02:36:33,250 --> 02:36:36,010
I don't know what you guys are doing.
I want to know,

3592
02:36:36,011 --> 02:36:40,280
are you guys put tonic friends just
start dancing for some strange reason or

3593
02:36:40,300 --> 02:36:42,910
it seems like you're flirting with each
other like I need to know.

3594
02:36:43,090 --> 02:36:45,500
I need to know because all the time.
Well,

3595
02:36:45,540 --> 02:36:50,540
Mick Jagger's ex wife got mean said she
found a David Bowie and bed with

3596
02:36:50,840 --> 02:36:53,920
mcjagger,
so she told everybody that's where when

3597
02:36:53,921 --> 02:36:57,280
you're a guy like David Bowie or mick
jagger becomes really problematic being

3598
02:36:57,281 --> 02:37:01,000
married to some normal person because
she's got this amazing story.

3599
02:37:01,001 --> 02:37:03,800
So what if they want to get together and
figure out whether or not there was

3600
02:37:03,930 --> 02:37:04,261
like,
oh yeah,

3601
02:37:04,261 --> 02:37:07,270
I fuck all sorts of stuff like this a
shot.

3602
02:37:07,300 --> 02:37:10,780
Let's see what the fuck happens.
And meanwhile this woman that Mick

3603
02:37:10,780 --> 02:37:15,380
Jagger supposedly had some sort of a
contract with where they're not supposed

3604
02:37:15,381 --> 02:37:18,590
to have sex with other people.
She got all upset and she fucking puts

3605
02:37:18,591 --> 02:37:22,340
them on blast all over the world.
Probably put it in a book or something.

3606
02:37:22,580 --> 02:37:25,820
How rude to each other.
Listen,

3607
02:37:25,821 --> 02:37:27,260
that's privileged information,
ma'am.

3608
02:37:27,380 --> 02:37:28,880
That's not like regular people.

3609
02:37:29,160 --> 02:37:33,020
That's not like Bob,
you know the guy who fixes bikes,

3610
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:36,620
the bike shop and Tim who's the ups
driver,

3611
02:37:36,680 --> 02:37:39,710
has friendly conversations with Bob and
the gun to them fucking in the men's

3612
02:37:39,711 --> 02:37:40,490
room.
It's not.

3613
02:37:40,490 --> 02:37:42,250
This is a bigger deal.
This is.

3614
02:37:42,400 --> 02:37:46,290
This is gonna affect the record
companies is gonna affect venues can

3615
02:37:46,460 --> 02:37:50,330
affect the people that sell tickets.
There's a lot of jobs attached to these

3616
02:37:50,331 --> 02:37:53,430
two people and you're just being rude
because you're a petty con.

3617
02:37:55,310 --> 02:37:56,960
What do you care?
What do you care?

3618
02:37:57,200 --> 02:37:59,030
Look at the way he's dressed.
Of course he fucks guys.

3619
02:37:59,150 --> 02:38:01,250
Jesus Christ.
That was a shocker to you.

3620
02:38:01,840 --> 02:38:03,110
Doesn't make them any less.
Awesome.

3621
02:38:03,190 --> 02:38:04,670
It makes them more awesome.
Look it up.

3622
02:38:05,090 --> 02:38:08,120
These guys from behind you there.
You imagine if you and I did a music

3623
02:38:08,121 --> 02:38:10,520
video and we were doing this,
what are you doing?

3624
02:38:11,110 --> 02:38:11,680
You can do this.

3625
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:15,120
These thickness fingers couldn't kiss
each other for more than two seconds for

3626
02:38:15,121 --> 02:38:16,820
a hilarious thing on a pay per view
event.

3627
02:38:17,150 --> 02:38:19,070
How much?
My biggest regret is that it's pulling

3628
02:38:19,071 --> 02:38:22,070
away and laughing when I shouldn't have.
I didn't realize I thought the cameras

3629
02:38:22,071 --> 02:38:23,720
did.
You give him a ton and I give him a

3630
02:38:23,721 --> 02:38:24,554
little.
Did you.

3631
02:38:24,850 --> 02:38:25,680
What?
Did he give it back?

3632
02:38:25,680 --> 02:38:26,513
You think?
I don't like Dunkin,

3633
02:38:26,630 --> 02:38:28,310
but did he give it back?
We did.

3634
02:38:28,311 --> 02:38:29,230
You guys tongue?
We were.

3635
02:38:29,320 --> 02:38:30,500
We were locked in there,
man.

3636
02:38:30,501 --> 02:38:32,450
I thought you guys were like just just
lips.

3637
02:38:32,630 --> 02:38:34,220
I didn't know you went in tongues.
You gotta sell it.

3638
02:38:34,580 --> 02:38:37,570
Oh,
you sold was trench coat.

3639
02:38:37,571 --> 02:38:39,980
Is he warm or cold or what is he?
What is he?

3640
02:38:40,260 --> 02:38:42,080
Because it seems like they're both in
different climates.

3641
02:38:42,100 --> 02:38:43,110
Yeah,
like David Bowie,

3642
02:38:43,111 --> 02:38:45,350
he seems like he's in a rainy London
sorta climate,

3643
02:38:45,351 --> 02:38:48,530
but Mick Jagger's in the keys.
The Florida keys.

3644
02:38:48,710 --> 02:38:50,330
He's having a good old time.
He's like,

3645
02:38:50,331 --> 02:38:52,970
listen to Jimmy Buffet music or some
shit with c eight at night.

3646
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,050
Blue Pants.
What's going on with you?

3647
02:38:56,150 --> 02:38:57,680
What's that about why they freeze frame
on that,

3648
02:38:57,681 --> 02:38:59,870
but does that you.
Did you do that Jamie,

3649
02:38:59,871 --> 02:39:02,000
or is that the actual video?
That's how it ends.

3650
02:39:02,270 --> 02:39:06,560
That's unfortunate or fortunate
depending on what you're really into.

3651
02:39:07,660 --> 02:39:10,850
Doing ground control to major Tom.
Come on,

3652
02:39:10,851 --> 02:39:15,100
man.
That's like startups character and he

3653
02:39:15,340 --> 02:39:18,610
all coked up.
They had these coke spoons as part of

3654
02:39:18,611 --> 02:39:19,720
the exhibit,
his,

3655
02:39:19,721 --> 02:39:21,460
all of his cooks,
but they didn't hide anything.

3656
02:39:21,580 --> 02:39:22,413
Did they really?
Yeah.

3657
02:39:22,420 --> 02:39:24,430
So in his coke rage or whatever he was
in,

3658
02:39:24,760 --> 02:39:25,593
he goes,
uh,

3659
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:28,110
there's this famous thing.
He goes not only as a,

3660
02:39:28,120 --> 02:39:31,330
you guys have been wonderful audience
and not only is this the last,

3661
02:39:31,360 --> 02:39:34,030
uh,
ziggy stardust show of the tour,

3662
02:39:35,560 --> 02:39:37,930
but it is also in the band,
has no idea what he's talking about,

3663
02:39:37,931 --> 02:39:39,730
what he's going to say,
because this is also the last day he

3664
02:39:39,731 --> 02:39:42,730
started us show of all time.
He plays,

3665
02:39:42,790 --> 02:39:44,470
his last song gets off and the bands
like,

3666
02:39:44,471 --> 02:39:45,390
wait,
we're done with.

3667
02:39:45,480 --> 02:39:47,140
That's how you're telling us we're
fucking done.

3668
02:39:47,650 --> 02:39:49,390
Holy Shit.
That sucks for the band.

3669
02:39:49,391 --> 02:39:51,120
Yeah.
And then he went and started just being

3670
02:39:51,190 --> 02:39:53,290
David Bowie wow.
Here this character.

3671
02:39:53,291 --> 02:39:54,101
That was huge.
And they're like,

3672
02:39:54,101 --> 02:39:54,550
what are you doing?

3673
02:39:54,550 --> 02:39:55,390
Don't stop.
He goes,

3674
02:39:55,420 --> 02:39:56,410
fuck this.
I'm an artist.

3675
02:39:56,411 --> 02:39:59,350
I'm developing stuck with that
moneymaker forever.

3676
02:39:59,530 --> 02:40:01,620
Wow.
Well,

3677
02:40:01,630 --> 02:40:02,650
he was,
he was just,

3678
02:40:02,800 --> 02:40:05,920
he had some fucking really amazing songs
but amazing songs.

3679
02:40:06,010 --> 02:40:08,200
And they were so original.
Yeah.

3680
02:40:08,680 --> 02:40:11,020
But his live performance,
they showed them on the top of the pops,

3681
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:15,000
just like androgynous shit on like a
late night talk show.

3682
02:40:15,650 --> 02:40:17,940
Not late for.
She'll lecture like a mainstream thing

3683
02:40:17,941 --> 02:40:20,910
and they just like almost half kissing
this guy and people are like,

3684
02:40:20,940 --> 02:40:22,620
wait,
what the fuck was that?

3685
02:40:22,650 --> 02:40:24,990
What did I just see?
Yeah.

3686
02:40:24,991 --> 02:40:27,100
And the music was so unique.
[inaudible],

3687
02:40:27,180 --> 02:40:28,530
you know,
his style was,

3688
02:40:28,980 --> 02:40:31,800
it was just,
it was very specific.

3689
02:40:32,100 --> 02:40:34,340
You know,
was very David Bowie.

3690
02:40:34,790 --> 02:40:36,120
Yeah.
Oh my God.

3691
02:40:36,121 --> 02:40:36,970
What a great song.
That is.

3692
02:40:37,650 --> 02:40:39,980
What a great song.
Yeah,

3693
02:40:39,990 --> 02:40:40,823
he was awesome,
man.

3694
02:40:40,980 --> 02:40:41,850
It wasn't like,
okay,

3695
02:40:41,851 --> 02:40:44,550
when Michael Jackson died,
everyone's a Michael Jackson Fan.

3696
02:40:44,610 --> 02:40:47,100
Everybody right when he died it was sad,
whatever.

3697
02:40:47,101 --> 02:40:48,780
But he wasn't still making music and
stuff,

3698
02:40:48,840 --> 02:40:49,740
you know?
So it was like,

3699
02:40:49,770 --> 02:40:50,790
oh,
it's too bad he passed.

3700
02:40:50,791 --> 02:40:53,550
But it was either that or 30 years later
we weren't going to miss out on

3701
02:40:53,551 --> 02:40:56,400
anything.
David Bowie released an album last

3702
02:40:56,400 --> 02:40:57,071
Tuesday.
They did.

3703
02:40:57,071 --> 02:40:57,904
Really?
Yeah.

3704
02:40:57,960 --> 02:41:00,630
It's just getting the first hit is just
on the radio right now.

3705
02:41:00,960 --> 02:41:04,350
He still has stuff that's being planned
for radio releases in the next.

3706
02:41:04,890 --> 02:41:07,410
You know,
humor like there was a rollout scheduled

3707
02:41:07,920 --> 02:41:09,270
fucking cancer man.

3708
02:41:10,520 --> 02:41:15,520
He did a lot of stuff,
allegedly.

3709
02:41:16,990 --> 02:41:20,100
I don't even think he hid from it.
Yeah.

3710
02:41:20,120 --> 02:41:22,130
It's a bummer man.
Bummer.

3711
02:41:22,460 --> 02:41:25,960
Did you see the Sean Penn thing on Sean
Lynch,

3712
02:41:26,220 --> 02:41:27,590
Chapo.
Sean Penn.

3713
02:41:27,591 --> 02:41:29,150
I've completely changed my opinion about
him.

3714
02:41:29,390 --> 02:41:32,090
I think he was a blowhard.
Linda did that chris rock thing.

3715
02:41:32,120 --> 02:41:36,500
I was very critical of him because the
chris rock made a joke and he's doing

3716
02:41:36,501 --> 02:41:39,950
his monologue and he made a joke about
jude law and sean penn comes out and

3717
02:41:39,951 --> 02:41:40,341
goes,
well,

3718
02:41:40,341 --> 02:41:42,220
the reason margaret,
like,

3719
02:41:42,300 --> 02:41:44,190
come on man,
you know,

3720
02:41:44,330 --> 02:41:49,330
so I goofed on them.
But that fucking guy went to Mexico to

3721
02:41:50,450 --> 02:41:53,930
the jungle to meet el chapo and
interview him and write about it for

3722
02:41:53,931 --> 02:41:55,370
rolling stone.
Wow.

3723
02:41:55,430 --> 02:41:58,040
Just to be a journalist,
dude.

3724
02:41:58,041 --> 02:42:00,740
He has everything to lose.
He's got a family,

3725
02:42:00,741 --> 02:42:02,600
he's got children,
he's got money,

3726
02:42:02,601 --> 02:42:04,610
he's got fame,
he's got everything.

3727
02:42:04,610 --> 02:42:08,210
He has no reason to want to do this.
And he decides to do it.

3728
02:42:08,450 --> 02:42:13,160
He decides to and people who are
criticizing him and it's really bizarre

3729
02:42:13,161 --> 02:42:16,550
way that first of all they said was one
of these guys said,

3730
02:42:16,551 --> 02:42:18,380
I read this tweet about it where you're
saying,

3731
02:42:18,650 --> 02:42:22,670
I wonder how sean penn feels about real
journalists being killed,

3732
02:42:23,380 --> 02:42:24,890
you know,
because of the narco is have killed

3733
02:42:24,891 --> 02:42:26,780
journalists that report on them.
Well guess what?

3734
02:42:26,781 --> 02:42:29,810
He's risking his life like you don't
think they would think it would be funny

3735
02:42:29,811 --> 02:42:31,640
to kill sean penn.
Like if,

3736
02:42:31,670 --> 02:42:33,710
if,
if somehow another sean penn had

3737
02:42:33,711 --> 02:42:36,790
irritated el chapo.
El chapo decided to have him killed.

3738
02:42:36,791 --> 02:42:38,870
It must've known the risk of that.
This guy doesn't care.

3739
02:42:39,020 --> 02:42:41,570
El chapo got out and tunnels.
I heard he was hiding out and justin

3740
02:42:41,571 --> 02:42:43,940
martindale's asshole.
I don't think justin martindale's

3741
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:45,300
assholes that little.
That's how.

3742
02:42:45,310 --> 02:42:46,820
No,
I'm saying that's the series of tunnels

3743
02:42:47,230 --> 02:42:49,780
and if you looked in there,
you know,

3744
02:42:49,940 --> 02:42:51,580
I mean that big a.

3745
02:42:52,740 --> 02:42:54,180
So we interviewed el chapo.
That's cool.

3746
02:42:54,181 --> 02:42:56,520
He went to Afghanistan during the
beginning of the war to right,

3747
02:42:56,521 --> 02:42:59,200
or a wreck.
One of those two street.

3748
02:43:00,170 --> 02:43:01,250
I don't.
I'm not sure about that.

3749
02:43:01,251 --> 02:43:02,270
I didn't.
I wasn't aware of that,

3750
02:43:02,271 --> 02:43:06,230
but what he did with el chapo was he got
in touch with some mexican actress who

3751
02:43:06,231 --> 02:43:09,270
knows el chapo,
she's probably ghetto chapels,

3752
02:43:09,390 --> 02:43:13,630
trembling sign and um,
el chapo,

3753
02:43:13,870 --> 02:43:16,530
uh,
arranged a meeting and uh,

3754
02:43:16,600 --> 02:43:18,710
they had like specific conditions like
what?

3755
02:43:18,760 --> 02:43:21,520
He had to read the story before it's
published,

3756
02:43:21,521 --> 02:43:23,530
which they've never granted before with
rolling stone.

3757
02:43:23,531 --> 02:43:26,590
They don't do that and they agreed to it
because it's just like such a critical

3758
02:43:26,690 --> 02:43:29,200
to illegally.
I'm not gonna let you me that it's sean

3759
02:43:29,230 --> 02:43:32,200
penn is interviewing,
but all these journalists are mad.

3760
02:43:32,500 --> 02:43:36,130
And Like what sean penn responsible for
the fact that el chapo was killed.

3761
02:43:36,131 --> 02:43:38,290
Other people like he shouldn't be
sitting down and talk.

3762
02:43:38,470 --> 02:43:42,540
You don't want a c,
a conversation and it's kilograms.

3763
02:43:42,730 --> 02:43:44,020
he is being a journal,
a killer.

3764
02:43:44,020 --> 02:43:44,940
But okay,
let's interview him.

3765
02:43:45,090 --> 02:43:48,580
But manson,
what does this kid shit like real

3766
02:43:48,581 --> 02:43:50,950
journalists like don't say that.
Like that guy.

3767
02:43:51,160 --> 02:43:55,000
That's a Crazy risk.
he took undeniably crazy risk.

3768
02:43:55,850 --> 02:43:58,630
Just cattiness for anybody to shit on
it.

3769
02:43:58,850 --> 02:44:00,100
Like to say that he shouldn't have done
that.

3770
02:44:00,101 --> 02:44:02,710
Like he's not going to keep people alive
by not going there.

3771
02:44:03,020 --> 02:44:04,030
He's,
and in fact,

3772
02:44:04,031 --> 02:44:09,031
they believe that the paper trail or the
electronic trail of them setting this up

3773
02:44:09,850 --> 02:44:12,830
is probably what led to them capturing
el chapo in the first place.

3774
02:44:12,850 --> 02:44:16,060
So really,
which they just did the whole thing it.

3775
02:44:16,550 --> 02:44:19,720
And then he just,
they only caught them like two days ago

3776
02:44:20,200 --> 02:44:22,580
and they caught them like,
right as this story is coming out with

3777
02:44:22,660 --> 02:44:25,960
almost of americans still fucking
rolling stone setup el chapo to make

3778
02:44:25,961 --> 02:44:27,520
their stores selling from better.
JamIe.

3779
02:44:27,910 --> 02:44:29,320
So are you thinking,
oh,

3780
02:44:29,470 --> 02:44:30,640
I can't believe you're saying that.

3781
02:44:31,780 --> 02:44:34,240
I don't know why you would say that
because I don't think the world works

3782
02:44:34,241 --> 02:44:35,540
that way.
God,

3783
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:38,870
jamie's like conspiracy.
They sell the extra stuff.

3784
02:44:39,490 --> 02:44:41,140
We just come down.
They want to,

3785
02:44:41,390 --> 02:44:43,030
they,
the United States is going to give

3786
02:44:43,031 --> 02:44:46,290
Mexico like a bunch of why?
Because he gasoline or struggles that

3787
02:44:46,291 --> 02:44:47,720
come here.
Uh,

3788
02:44:48,130 --> 02:44:50,140
because yeah,
he sold drugs in America.

3789
02:44:50,950 --> 02:44:54,040
So we get to pull them out of his
country of have jurisdiction because

3790
02:44:54,041 --> 02:44:56,770
they can't keep that fucker locked up.
We can keep them locked up.

3791
02:44:57,530 --> 02:44:59,720
They're like,
enough to help us with is withholding

3792
02:44:59,740 --> 02:45:01,960
this joker.
He fucking escaped twice.

3793
02:45:02,170 --> 02:45:03,910
We're done with this.
Let's stop.

3794
02:45:05,110 --> 02:45:05,651
I just,
uh,

3795
02:45:05,651 --> 02:45:07,630
I've completely changed my opinion on
sean penn.

3796
02:45:07,631 --> 02:45:08,520
What are you on p?
Yeah,

3797
02:45:08,710 --> 02:45:10,450
I knew it.
The interview was in october.

3798
02:45:11,380 --> 02:45:13,660
It wasn't october.
It was just coming out now.

3799
02:45:13,661 --> 02:45:15,490
Right.
Which might be added to your.

3800
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:16,880
It might be added to.
Why?

3801
02:45:17,090 --> 02:45:19,800
Why would release it now?
Conspiracy member.

3802
02:45:20,440 --> 02:45:23,800
It's illuminati controls all of the
media.

3803
02:45:23,890 --> 02:45:26,110
Do you think you'd get in trouble for,
for doing this at all?

3804
02:45:26,740 --> 02:45:27,573
Sean penn?
Yeah.

3805
02:45:27,730 --> 02:45:29,080
Fuck yeah,
foR sure.

3806
02:45:29,120 --> 02:45:30,130
Yeah.
Look,

3807
02:45:30,131 --> 02:45:30,790
man,
he,

3808
02:45:30,790 --> 02:45:35,790
he just got a story with one of the
biggest drug dealers or the apparently

3809
02:45:36,251 --> 02:45:39,670
the biggest drug dealer.
If he's to be believed ever it's ever

3810
02:45:39,671 --> 02:45:43,690
lived other than the other that's ever
lived,

3811
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:45,730
allegedly.
come on,

3812
02:45:45,731 --> 02:45:46,331
man.
I mean,

3813
02:45:46,331 --> 02:45:47,410
of course you can get in trouble for
that.

3814
02:45:47,411 --> 02:45:51,580
That's a dangerous move.
Like anybody that says that what sean

3815
02:45:51,581 --> 02:45:56,581
penn did didn't take any courage.
It's crazy in anybody who's like,

3816
02:45:57,010 --> 02:45:58,570
why criticize it?
Just look at it.

3817
02:45:58,600 --> 02:45:59,890
What it is,
what he got.

3818
02:45:59,950 --> 02:46:04,950
He had a conversation with a a known
gangster of incredible reputation.

3819
02:46:08,230 --> 02:46:09,560
I mean,
that's what that guy is.

3820
02:46:09,590 --> 02:46:14,330
He's an unknown gangster of incredible
reputation and sean penn met him in the

3821
02:46:14,331 --> 02:46:17,780
jungle in Mexico.
You don't think that's a ballsy move.

3822
02:46:17,781 --> 02:46:22,670
That's one of the ballsiest moves that a
person can do as a journalist,

3823
02:46:22,830 --> 02:46:26,480
but with sean penn did,
but to do it as a movie star,

3824
02:46:26,540 --> 02:46:29,540
a fucking guy who's won oscars or at
least an oscar,

3825
02:46:29,541 --> 02:46:30,510
right?
He's warning us ranks.

3826
02:46:30,930 --> 02:46:32,720
Look,
he's a bad motherfucker.

3827
02:46:33,020 --> 02:46:36,740
I rescind my previous criticism,
very big of you.

3828
02:46:36,810 --> 02:46:40,080
I heard that it was obviously a
conspiracy thing,

3829
02:46:40,081 --> 02:46:43,680
but I heard that the mexican government
might have led el chapo out to get the

3830
02:46:43,860 --> 02:46:47,430
cartels and gangs under control because
once they arrested him vacuum,

3831
02:46:47,460 --> 02:46:49,470
there was a vacuum.
Now that he was out,

3832
02:46:49,500 --> 02:46:52,470
he got everything wrapped up.
Now that pulled back in,

3833
02:46:52,950 --> 02:46:56,780
which is why he's been arrested again.
Jamie's with conspiracies over here

3834
02:46:56,790 --> 02:47:01,290
that's on the radio today.
How dare you to repeat these problems?

3835
02:47:01,380 --> 02:47:02,290
Oh,
who the fuck knows?

3836
02:47:02,291 --> 02:47:03,640
I don't think they let him out.
I think.

3837
02:47:03,880 --> 02:47:08,880
I think somebody paid a shitload of
money to have so many dig a tunnel and I

3838
02:47:09,101 --> 02:47:10,870
don't think they do a good job of
watching their prison.

3839
02:47:11,170 --> 02:47:14,170
That's most like or probably there's
probably some people in on it.

3840
02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:16,720
Probably got paid to.
Definitely write that.

3841
02:47:16,860 --> 02:47:18,790
That's why they're so that's why they
want to keep them here in the good old

3842
02:47:18,791 --> 02:47:20,980
us way.
We've got them locked down when we're

3843
02:47:20,981 --> 02:47:23,650
done with this shit.
I'm going to take them down to quantico,

3844
02:47:23,830 --> 02:47:25,930
put them down in place.
We got there.

3845
02:47:25,931 --> 02:47:30,220
And the bottom of the denver airport,
that's where he is comparing that.

3846
02:47:30,250 --> 02:47:33,150
Denver airport prison flights,
they always talk about.

3847
02:47:33,160 --> 02:47:34,810
I want to see that place.
Um,

3848
02:47:34,811 --> 02:47:37,030
yeah.
So I'm pretty sure it's bullshit.

3849
02:47:37,420 --> 02:47:39,730
It was a jail down there.
I think.

3850
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:42,060
A lot of jail.

3851
02:47:42,310 --> 02:47:43,260
Wow.
Yeah,

3852
02:47:43,330 --> 02:47:44,770
it doesn't.
Fenway park have a jail too.

3853
02:47:44,860 --> 02:47:46,560
I might've made that up.
I don't know.

3854
02:47:47,050 --> 02:47:48,520
I can see that.
Um,

3855
02:47:48,790 --> 02:47:50,260
but yeah.
So I'll chop.

3856
02:47:50,261 --> 02:47:52,260
I'll captured.
And sean penn brody.

3857
02:47:52,270 --> 02:47:54,210
Cool.
Then he went down there and fucking it'S

3858
02:47:54,230 --> 02:47:58,420
not the best story.
Writing musical to work will dry and

3859
02:47:58,480 --> 02:47:59,760
Points.
But uh,

3860
02:47:59,790 --> 02:48:01,420
but you still say it's wrong for him to
go,

3861
02:48:01,421 --> 02:48:06,250
like he's one of our finer sectors.
What he did was just unnecessary and he

3862
02:48:06,251 --> 02:48:10,420
was just trying to stand up for a guy
that he has for his craft who doesn't

3863
02:48:10,421 --> 02:48:11,330
get comedy.
Right.

3864
02:48:11,350 --> 02:48:15,100
But it's his craft that's he doesn't
have to be who he is to be able to do

3865
02:48:15,101 --> 02:48:19,270
harvey milk and to also be able to do
the fast times at ridgemont high and the

3866
02:48:19,271 --> 02:48:21,070
irish mob guy,
like he's,

3867
02:48:21,460 --> 02:48:24,100
he obviously knows how to get into his
work.

3868
02:48:24,250 --> 02:48:27,550
He doesn't do a shit job.
Like he's not doing an american sniper.

3869
02:48:27,760 --> 02:48:30,040
Right.
If you ever seen a movie where he plays

3870
02:48:30,041 --> 02:48:31,600
it,
where it seems like he's just phoning it

3871
02:48:31,601 --> 02:48:34,540
in like,
like moments you saw american sniper,

3872
02:48:34,541 --> 02:48:35,560
you're like,
this is not real,

3873
02:48:35,770 --> 02:48:38,080
you know,
you don't see sean penn and those movies

3874
02:48:38,440 --> 02:48:40,490
in that.
Like when here's like the scene where

3875
02:48:40,500 --> 02:48:43,810
you're criticizing the bradley cooper
scene where the girlfriend was banging

3876
02:48:43,811 --> 02:48:47,280
another guy and it just seeMs all fake.
Could you imagine sean penn and that

3877
02:48:47,281 --> 02:48:47,711
saying,
no,

3878
02:48:47,711 --> 02:48:49,210
of course you can.
It would be.

3879
02:48:49,420 --> 02:48:50,840
It would,
he would figure out how to make it more

3880
02:48:50,870 --> 02:48:51,820
to shut up,
brother.

3881
02:48:52,300 --> 02:48:53,860
He would,
he would figure out how to make it more

3882
02:48:53,861 --> 02:48:58,861
real or he wouldn't be doing it.
Like his quality of work is definitely

3883
02:48:58,961 --> 02:49:01,690
to be respected.
Like there's a few guys like that that

3884
02:49:01,691 --> 02:49:04,780
have that Daniel Day lewis,
you know him,

3885
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:06,100
a russell crowe.
There's like,

3886
02:49:06,310 --> 02:49:08,190
there's a few that have this

3887
02:49:08,220 --> 02:49:12,000
ability to like,
transform into like mariel hemingway,

3888
02:49:12,230 --> 02:49:16,590
a russell crowe puts out some stuff,
although he's dunaway may.

3889
02:49:16,800 --> 02:49:18,330
Faye dunaway.
Like from the beginning,

3890
02:49:18,331 --> 02:49:20,370
man,
you ever watch the original stoner?

3891
02:49:20,371 --> 02:49:22,100
That's the original rendition of a
stoney.

3892
02:49:23,010 --> 02:49:27,060
Everyone else is doing an impression of
that map wasted already.

3893
02:49:27,061 --> 02:49:31,630
Beats a sneaker or gets his head.
That was my head was.

3894
02:49:31,640 --> 02:49:32,950
How did you,
uh,

3895
02:49:33,480 --> 02:49:35,160
did you ever see chinatown?
Faye dunaway?

3896
02:49:35,890 --> 02:49:37,050
I don't know.
Good lord.

3897
02:49:37,051 --> 02:49:39,090
Jack nicholson to faye dunaway in
chinatown.

3898
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:41,730
Oh shit.
Yeah.

3899
02:49:41,731 --> 02:49:43,590
There's,
there's some fuckIng people you know

3900
02:49:43,591 --> 02:49:45,900
who's that broad?
That's a in all the coen brothers

3901
02:49:45,901 --> 02:49:47,760
movies.
She's really awesome.

3902
02:49:47,880 --> 02:49:50,700
She was in fargo.
She's amazing.

3903
02:49:50,820 --> 02:49:51,490
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

3904
02:49:51,490 --> 02:49:53,820
He was already out with the acts.
God damn it.

3905
02:49:54,270 --> 02:49:55,980
She was in the movie fargo.
She's Been in everything.

3906
02:49:55,981 --> 02:49:57,450
Yeah.
She's been in the movie fargo.

3907
02:49:57,480 --> 02:49:59,160
Frances mcdormand.
Yes.

3908
02:49:59,220 --> 02:50:01,590
She's.
She's one of those people that become

3909
02:50:01,720 --> 02:50:02,150
you.

3910
02:50:02,150 --> 02:50:03,450
It's.
I don't.

3911
02:50:03,480 --> 02:50:06,060
Yeah.
I don't care that she.

3912
02:50:06,090 --> 02:50:08,070
I know who it is.
Like she's so good.

3913
02:50:08,071 --> 02:50:08,940
Like you lose yourself.
Yeah.

3914
02:50:09,010 --> 02:50:10,830
If I go to see a movie and I'm like,
oh,

3915
02:50:10,831 --> 02:50:13,260
that's that guy.
How'd that guy get to play that guy?

3916
02:50:13,450 --> 02:50:14,330
It doesn't make any sense.
Like,

3917
02:50:14,610 --> 02:50:15,810
how is.
Wait a minute.

3918
02:50:16,050 --> 02:50:19,320
You know seth rogan is steve wasniak.
Nobody's not.

3919
02:50:19,400 --> 02:50:22,140
Seth rogen like,
what's going on here now?

3920
02:50:22,141 --> 02:50:24,240
He's playing somebody.
It's not that seth rogan's not good,

3921
02:50:24,241 --> 02:50:27,030
but you know what I mean?
Like I know who he is,

3922
02:50:27,180 --> 02:50:30,180
but she's so goddamn good.
You don't care who she is.

3923
02:50:30,420 --> 02:50:31,950
You don't care that it's frances
mcdormand.

3924
02:50:31,951 --> 02:50:34,710
When she's playing a role,
you bought hook,

3925
02:50:34,711 --> 02:50:37,380
line and sinker.
You're locked up in it,

3926
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:39,570
which is way harder to do.
You know?

3927
02:50:39,571 --> 02:50:41,790
It's way harder to do when you don't
know who the person is.

3928
02:50:41,940 --> 02:50:42,880
Like an ax maki.

3929
02:50:42,880 --> 02:50:44,820
Now I didn't know who any of these
fucking people were,

3930
02:50:44,850 --> 02:50:47,010
so it was perfect.
It just slipped right in,

3931
02:50:47,160 --> 02:50:50,130
but if one of those people have been tom
cruise or the other one was nicole

3932
02:50:50,160 --> 02:50:52,510
kidman had been like,
come on like this.

3933
02:50:52,590 --> 02:50:53,910
I know who you are,
fucker.

3934
02:50:54,630 --> 02:50:57,600
It's hard to see whenever your friend's
book anything and you're watching a

3935
02:50:57,601 --> 02:51:00,810
movie and you see like the or,
or anybody you know or you know,

3936
02:51:00,910 --> 02:51:01,481
Missouri.
Bronto,

3937
02:51:01,481 --> 02:51:01,741
like,
um,

3938
02:51:01,741 --> 02:51:02,690
ah.
Yeah.

3939
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,700
It's just real hard to get lost in it.
Yeah.

3940
02:51:05,820 --> 02:51:09,390
Almost imponderable know them bowl plus
it's not fun to get lost in it and it's

3941
02:51:09,391 --> 02:51:10,260
fun to go.
What's up?

3942
02:51:12,510 --> 02:51:13,740
That's what's fun,
right?

3943
02:51:14,090 --> 02:51:15,180
Yeah.
Cut.

3944
02:51:15,181 --> 02:51:18,360
Damn.
At ari shaffir are you enjoying your new

3945
02:51:18,361 --> 02:51:20,460
found success yet?
Man,

3946
02:51:20,461 --> 02:51:22,170
it's been great.
I get a little worried about certain

3947
02:51:22,171 --> 02:51:24,420
things.
I keep track of who traveled all over

3948
02:51:24,421 --> 02:51:26,490
the world though.
Having all the world's real fun as shit

3949
02:51:26,491 --> 02:51:28,650
I'm trying to do.
I realized I made this problems with

3950
02:51:28,651 --> 02:51:30,480
morrissey.
Paul morrissey a few years ago,

3951
02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:33,810
we were in a Denmark for some comedy
festival.

3952
02:51:34,290 --> 02:51:35,160
Nope.
Excuse me.

3953
02:51:35,550 --> 02:51:39,120
We're in montreux Switzerland for some
comedy festival and then went to

3954
02:51:39,121 --> 02:51:42,240
amsterdam afterwards and uh,
just for fun.

3955
02:51:42,330 --> 02:51:44,610
And we were like,
let's go to new countries every year.

3956
02:51:44,880 --> 02:51:47,430
Wow.
just to visit or to work,

3957
02:51:47,460 --> 02:51:48,570
whatever.
Either one.

3958
02:51:48,600 --> 02:51:49,470
Yeah.
I mean I've really.

3959
02:51:49,471 --> 02:51:52,020
One of the things I'd like to do in
another country to see what it's like to

3960
02:51:52,021 --> 02:51:54,210
do comedy there.
You should do a show in Thailand.

3961
02:51:54,840 --> 02:51:55,920
Thailand.
How many shows?

3962
02:51:55,980 --> 02:51:57,510
Just onE in bangkok.
How was it?

3963
02:51:57,680 --> 02:51:59,070
Fun as shit.
Wow.

3964
02:51:59,130 --> 02:52:01,730
That was a lot more thai people where
they there.

3965
02:52:01,740 --> 02:52:03,660
Then in China,
China was all ex pats.

3966
02:52:03,690 --> 02:52:05,290
Maybe one chinese person.
Wow.

3967
02:52:05,320 --> 02:52:06,040
Hong kong has been

3968
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:07,060
mixed,
but like Thailand,

3969
02:52:07,360 --> 02:52:11,340
they speak some english dudes.
So I might do a show in India this year.

3970
02:52:12,520 --> 02:52:15,130
They speak english in India.
That's how when you get your computer

3971
02:52:15,131 --> 02:52:15,964
fixed.
English.

3972
02:52:16,520 --> 02:52:18,670
India in India,
everybody speaks english so they don't

3973
02:52:18,671 --> 02:52:20,930
have to do it for not just experts,
but either way,

3974
02:52:21,070 --> 02:52:24,550
if you have an american express issue,
you're talking to someone in India

3975
02:52:24,580 --> 02:52:26,550
pretty crazy.
Found that out and then we named

3976
02:52:26,560 --> 02:52:27,670
wonderful.
They're renamed them.

3977
02:52:27,760 --> 02:52:30,160
My name is fred.
I am here today,

3978
02:52:30,520 --> 02:52:33,680
but he's a problem with your phone card,
man.

3979
02:52:33,850 --> 02:52:36,490
I'm manic unexpressed.
that has again,

3980
02:52:36,550 --> 02:52:39,300
a racist.
Just like he was saying this to most

3981
02:52:39,301 --> 02:52:41,230
sword,
this is more racist.

3982
02:52:41,231 --> 02:52:43,000
You're appropriating an accent.
No,

3983
02:52:43,001 --> 02:52:45,640
it's racist for they renamed those
people.

3984
02:52:45,790 --> 02:52:46,720
That's racist.
Yeah.

3985
02:52:47,060 --> 02:52:49,990
Clearly I don't think american doesn't
someone have a bid on that?

3986
02:52:50,410 --> 02:52:51,790
Someone has a bit.
I had a bit,

3987
02:52:51,791 --> 02:52:53,550
I used to have a bit about it was it,
you know,

3988
02:52:54,070 --> 02:52:56,260
you know,
eddie bravo had a real problem with

3989
02:52:56,261 --> 02:52:57,340
those people one point in time.

3990
02:52:57,580 --> 02:52:59,410
And you know,
eddie bravo is a real trickster.

3991
02:52:59,530 --> 02:53:04,530
He's hilarious.
Like eddie must have ordered like a um,

3992
02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:10,630
a prescription medication and used his
cell phone as the phone number.

3993
02:53:10,660 --> 02:53:11,330
You know,
like when you,

3994
02:53:11,330 --> 02:53:13,420
you get a prescription,
like what number do you leave?

3995
02:53:13,540 --> 02:53:16,860
He left his cell phone.
So somehoW or another that got,

3996
02:53:16,890 --> 02:53:21,890
this was like in the early two thousands
and somehow or another that got sold as

3997
02:53:22,751 --> 02:53:23,710
a list,
you know,

3998
02:53:23,711 --> 02:53:26,050
how that happens out.
Like oh,

3999
02:53:26,080 --> 02:53:28,300
this guy buys prescription drugs or this
guy.

4000
02:53:28,470 --> 02:53:30,010
Uh,
but as solar panels,

4001
02:53:30,011 --> 02:53:33,760
and it sounds like for whatever reason
you get a list that was like a big issue

4002
02:53:33,761 --> 02:53:35,380
with people.
They would sell your information.

4003
02:53:35,760 --> 02:53:38,500
So he started getting all these phone
calls from pharmacies and they lose

4004
02:53:38,540 --> 02:53:41,620
people that barely spoke english and
they're trying to sell him prescription

4005
02:53:41,621 --> 02:53:45,460
drugs because this was during the day
where there was a kind of a wild west

4006
02:53:45,461 --> 02:53:49,330
period where you'd buy all your drugs
from Canada and overseas and they would

4007
02:53:49,331 --> 02:53:52,000
ship them and so you could get things
without a prescription,

4008
02:53:52,030 --> 02:53:53,920
like really heavy stuff without a
prescription.

4009
02:53:54,430 --> 02:53:59,170
And so eddie would keep these people on
the phone for ever.

4010
02:53:59,400 --> 02:54:01,900
I mean forever.
He would have these conversations with

4011
02:54:01,901 --> 02:54:05,710
them and pretend that like some noises
going on in the background and he would

4012
02:54:05,711 --> 02:54:09,610
talk to him and say,
what do you have that I can use?

4013
02:54:09,670 --> 02:54:10,610
Oh hold on,
I'll be right back.

4014
02:54:10,620 --> 02:54:13,390
I have to clean my feet.
And then he would go and like put the

4015
02:54:13,391 --> 02:54:16,510
phone down for like five minutes and go
take a leak.

4016
02:54:16,511 --> 02:54:19,510
He would get something to drink and then
come back to it and then start talking

4017
02:54:19,511 --> 02:54:22,490
to them about what different drugs like
I text,

4018
02:54:22,990 --> 02:54:25,330
what do you have that gets your card?
Do you have anything that gets your dick

4019
02:54:25,331 --> 02:54:29,800
hard and like have these crazy
conversations with these people and they

4020
02:54:29,801 --> 02:54:31,080
would go on forever.
Man.

4021
02:54:31,100 --> 02:54:33,220
He would be laughing.
It would hold the phone up to his chest

4022
02:54:33,221 --> 02:54:37,030
and he loves playing tricks like that on
people especially like he felt he had

4023
02:54:37,031 --> 02:54:40,450
the green light because they're
contacting him so he would drag on

4024
02:54:40,490 --> 02:54:42,370
forever.
Hang up though,

4025
02:54:42,460 --> 02:54:43,660
let's be curse.
Exactly.

4026
02:54:43,661 --> 02:54:48,490
So he was dragging it on forever and he
would go to like give them an address to

4027
02:54:48,491 --> 02:54:52,150
send it to her credit card number.
But then he would have some ridiculous

4028
02:54:52,151 --> 02:54:53,260
excuse.
He had to put the phone down,

4029
02:54:53,261 --> 02:54:55,960
he put the phone down for like 10
minutes and then go back to it and pick

4030
02:54:55,961 --> 02:54:57,300
it up,
keep doing it.

4031
02:54:57,490 --> 02:55:00,040
And it was Just one second.
I need to deal with this idea of like

4032
02:55:00,041 --> 02:55:02,030
crazy fake arguments,
you know,

4033
02:55:02,100 --> 02:55:04,040
like in the background,
hold the phone down

4034
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:07,370
and fucking scream and yell.
And then you say he was about to get

4035
02:55:07,371 --> 02:55:10,250
raped and he called the police and video
record them.

4036
02:55:10,450 --> 02:55:11,630
No,
it was just for fun.

4037
02:55:11,660 --> 02:55:15,140
Just kept doing it for the of.
He would do it for like I'm telling you,

4038
02:55:15,141 --> 02:55:16,790
man,
he did a bunch of sort of remember

4039
02:55:16,791 --> 02:55:18,350
those.
You remember those?

4040
02:55:18,351 --> 02:55:18,981
Yeah.
Dude.

4041
02:55:18,981 --> 02:55:20,570
He would get excited when the phone
would ring.

4042
02:55:20,600 --> 02:55:21,950
Hello.
so what is the structure?

4043
02:55:22,040 --> 02:55:23,830
So glad you guys called me.
Yeah.

4044
02:55:25,680 --> 02:55:27,630
It just don't have that kind of
patience.

4045
02:55:28,190 --> 02:55:30,890
I don't have that mind either.
Got be bored.

4046
02:55:30,920 --> 02:55:32,630
You shouldn't be bored.
You got to be crazy.

4047
02:55:32,820 --> 02:55:34,280
Huh?
In a different way.

4048
02:55:34,940 --> 02:55:36,530
He loves doing that though.
He just.

4049
02:55:36,560 --> 02:55:39,140
He gets such a kick out of doing that or
he did.

4050
02:55:39,170 --> 02:55:42,410
I'm sure now he's too busy.
It's hilarious.

4051
02:55:44,780 --> 02:55:46,620
Yeah.
They don't do that anymore.

4052
02:55:46,621 --> 02:55:49,160
And do that call you.
It's supposed to not have your cell

4053
02:55:49,161 --> 02:55:50,230
phone.
I'll be like,

4054
02:55:50,240 --> 02:55:51,620
what am I supposed to call my cell phone
ever?

4055
02:55:51,621 --> 02:55:55,730
That was like a law change.
Imagine if they didn't know the lord.

4056
02:55:55,760 --> 02:55:58,340
I think it only came for when people
didn't have unlimited phone calls.

4057
02:55:58,700 --> 02:55:59,870
Wasn't like standard.
Like,

4058
02:56:00,230 --> 02:56:01,910
Hey,
you're using other people's fucking time

4059
02:56:01,911 --> 02:56:04,040
and money.
That's actually a good argument to keep

4060
02:56:04,041 --> 02:56:05,240
it the way it is.
Yeah,

4061
02:56:05,270 --> 02:56:06,470
because now they can be like,
what,

4062
02:56:06,560 --> 02:56:08,030
what's the difference?
Because if it's free,

4063
02:56:08,031 --> 02:56:09,740
if you get all the minutes in the world
all the time,

4064
02:56:09,741 --> 02:56:11,630
then people were free to contact you for
no reason.

4065
02:56:11,660 --> 02:56:14,660
Even fax machines,
as soon as we had fax machines within,

4066
02:56:15,460 --> 02:56:17,690
it was spam.
Spam,

4067
02:56:18,080 --> 02:56:21,820
just sending you some fucking ad.
You remember when you call someone on

4068
02:56:21,821 --> 02:56:22,870
the facts,
but she went answer.

4069
02:56:22,871 --> 02:56:27,280
Uh huh.
He blogged you mother fucker.

4070
02:56:31,320 --> 02:56:33,180
Ridiculous.
Yeah.

4071
02:56:33,900 --> 02:56:34,370
Alright.
Sphere,

4072
02:56:34,370 --> 02:56:36,290
we're out of time.
We've got to wrap this pitch up.

4073
02:56:36,360 --> 02:56:41,350
Conflicts some dates or something.
Do you just ran your hour special or you

4074
02:56:41,380 --> 02:56:42,640
register in my new.
YeaH,

4075
02:56:42,710 --> 02:56:45,260
in the belly room.
I walked in for a little bit,

4076
02:56:45,290 --> 02:56:48,380
so cell phone bit was hilarious.
It's going well.

4077
02:56:48,500 --> 02:56:49,370
thanks.
So,

4078
02:56:49,371 --> 02:56:50,040
uh,
when you,

4079
02:56:50,040 --> 02:56:51,860
you ready to do another one?
I'm getting,

4080
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:54,470
I mean I'm doing my hour on the road now
is pretty solid.

4081
02:56:54,471 --> 02:56:57,620
Like I don't feel like I'm the crowd's
not getting to full good show.

4082
02:56:57,740 --> 02:57:00,620
But unlike siding when I want to do it,
I think I had to hold off till october

4083
02:57:01,160 --> 02:57:02,900
because I'm going to do an edinburgh.
Oh,

4084
02:57:02,960 --> 02:57:05,060
in edinburgh for a month.
Say it right though.

4085
02:57:05,061 --> 02:57:08,270
Don't say an burnham brook at mad
edinburgh like you fucker.

4086
02:57:08,271 --> 02:57:09,980
You wouldn't even from here steering on
me.

4087
02:57:10,460 --> 02:57:13,220
So I don't want to waste that time on
the material.

4088
02:57:13,220 --> 02:57:17,600
I'm going to run at 25 times in the uk.
I want to add that would make it

4089
02:57:17,601 --> 02:57:19,190
stronger.
Yeah,

4090
02:57:19,191 --> 02:57:21,700
we'll definitely adapt to that
environment to,

4091
02:57:21,920 --> 02:57:23,060
you know,
you get a groove,

4092
02:57:23,330 --> 02:57:25,790
like what audiences are like in
different countries.

4093
02:57:25,791 --> 02:57:28,700
New there for a few days.
Specially my last special I ran in 10

4094
02:57:28,701 --> 02:57:30,260
countries.
Wow.

4095
02:57:30,530 --> 02:57:32,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

4096
02:57:33,210 --> 02:57:34,570
I like,
you know,

4097
02:57:34,700 --> 02:57:36,830
getting it to everybody and see if it
works everywhere.

4098
02:57:37,370 --> 02:57:39,250
Smart move man.
It's smart because it,

4099
02:57:39,600 --> 02:57:42,320
you know,
you know how guys in one town they'll

4100
02:57:42,321 --> 02:57:46,420
develop a style suitable the one town
and we started on third street.

4101
02:57:46,610 --> 02:57:48,050
Yeah.
It might not work in chicago.

4102
02:57:48,110 --> 02:57:50,540
like what the fuck is third street?
I don't know what you're talking about.

4103
02:57:50,810 --> 02:57:53,020
I have a bit of a farmer brokers in New
York and it's like

4104
02:57:54,590 --> 02:57:56,270
I've got to make it work outside of New
York.

4105
02:57:56,450 --> 02:57:58,730
Yeah,
it's hard regional materials hard,

4106
02:57:59,360 --> 02:58:01,540
but every two weeks I'm gonna be my
storytelling.

4108
02:58:04,830 --> 02:58:06,850
