00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,240
Hello Freak bitches for,

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:03,961
but even if we did,

3
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:04,800
it's worth repeating.

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,810
I talked about an article,

5
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,910
an article that was done
by some colleagues of mine,

6
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:09,601
I don't know them well,

7
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:09,951
but some,

8
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:12,270
some academics where they looked at the,

9
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,020
uh,

10
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,410
political affiliation
of professors at top,

11
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,850
I think it was California in schools,

12
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,680
whether they identified it or whether
they actually had democratic affiliation

13
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:23,514
or Republican.

14
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,920
And as you might imagine,

15
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:29,370
it was extraordinarily
skewed towards Democrats,

16
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,590
but then depending on the field of study,

17
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,311
so for example,

18
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:36,030
in sociology and in the
humanities and in women's studies,

19
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:36,721
women with a y,

20
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:37,140
by the way,

21
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,580
please don't write women with an e.

22
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,920
That would be sexist at even,

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,000
as I said,

24
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,360
the women's oftentimes
and women's studies,

25
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:46,194
they,

26
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,090
they think that to have men as part
of the word women is itself a form of

27
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:51,631
aggression.

28
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:54,180
So they've altered the
spelling to with men.

29
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:54,991
Oh no,

30
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:55,830
that's not real.

31
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,161
So you see,

32
00:00:56,161 --> 00:01:01,161
I know your audience already has the price
of admission covered with that story,

33
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,780
but it's still the word women,

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,171
right?

35
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:04,591
So anyway,

36
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:05,520
so the same word,

37
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:07,830
why do you have to change the letters?

38
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,420
So in sociology,

39
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,433
do you train,

40
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,440
change the word trigger because it
sounds like the n word or a right,

41
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,300
you're getting triggered.

42
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:19,021
I'm triggered,

43
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:19,854
I'm triggered.

44
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,091
Well,

45
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:21,240
I'm fucking triggered.

46
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,291
If I was black,

47
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,310
I'd be super triggered,

48
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,080
but I don't know if you
notice some of my tweets now,

49
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,640
whenever I tweet anything,

50
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,920
I put a trigger warning trigger warning.

51
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,920
It's not become part of the vernacular
to make it sit there vertical.

52
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,330
It's too close to the n word.

53
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,410
Way Too close.

54
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,303
I am triggered.

55
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,233
But anyways,

56
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:41,340
to to finish the point
about that study 44 to one,

57
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,530
the ratio in sociology.

58
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,070
So imagine if you are a student
doing an Undergrad in sociology,

59
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,790
right?

60
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,320
It's not a very good thing to have.

61
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:53,610
Almost all of the professors that you
will ever come across be of one particular

62
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:54,444
persuasion.

63
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:54,691
Now,

64
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:55,890
some people would write to me and say,

65
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,903
but what do you mean?

66
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,200
The Democrats have everything,

67
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:58,441
right?

68
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:01,560
They have truth on their side and
the Republicans are a bunch of hacks.

69
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,260
Now when it comes to evolution evolution,

70
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:04,920
that's true,

71
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,161
right?

72
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:05,330
If,

73
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:05,540
if,

74
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,720
if on average republicans are more likely
to deny evolution than that point is

75
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:10,554
well taken,

76
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,550
but when it comes to issues,

77
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,660
is the death penalty,

78
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,643
right or wrong?

79
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,990
What's kind of fiscal
policy should you have?

80
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,700
What type of foreign
policy should you have?

81
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,090
This is not a one plus
one scientific equation,

82
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,960
so you should be exposed
to multiple viewpoints,

83
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,140
but of course you shouldn't be because
you should only interact with people who

84
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:29,740
are similar to you will that,

85
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,180
that is a problem with a lot
of people that go to college,

86
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,021
graduate,

87
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:35,130
get their phd,

88
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,120
get their doctorate,

89
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,790
and then start teaching and
never enter the real world,

90
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,180
right?

91
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,180
They stay in this sort of insulated
world of academia and then they espouse

92
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:46,740
these same ideas.

93
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,390
They promote these same idea.

94
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:52,650
They promote the same way of thinking as
if this is the real world because this

95
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:53,760
is the only world they know.

96
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,300
True.

97
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,100
So my friend,

98
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,740
uh,

99
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,461
luther reigns,

100
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,294
he ended up,

101
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,390
he had a massive stroke and
now he's actually for somehow.

102
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,640
So when,

103
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,560
when you have withdrawals
from painkillers,

104
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,120
it feels like you're going to die.

105
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,830
And so when he had the stroke,

106
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:09,161
they said,

107
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:10,180
get his mother here,

108
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,770
he's not gonna make it through this.

109
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:16,660
And we can pump them full on full of
enough drugs for him to get through this.

110
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:17,080
He's gonna.

111
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,430
He's probably not going to make it.

112
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,850
Somehow miraculously the part of the,

113
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:22,684
uh,

114
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,190
the brain that is like 30 percent of
his brain got killed during the stroke.

115
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,140
Part of the brain that got killed was
the part that was responsible for feeling

116
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:32,974
withdrawals.

117
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,680
So somehow he fucking dodged a bullet.

118
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,670
We called the bulletproof bad boy.

119
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,610
I'm somehow he bullet,

120
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,893
he's alive.

121
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,070
He has no more hangovers.

122
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:46,570
He's completely sober and he goes around
and talks to kids and churches and

123
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,111
things like that.

124
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:48,580
So he's doing great work.

125
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,830
So he lost 30 percent of his brain.

126
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:51,641
Yeah.

127
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,530
But somehow he's still a cognitive.

128
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:54,011
He's still,

129
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:54,221
you know,

130
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:55,054
he's still there.

131
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,070
He's jacked.

132
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,290
I mean,

133
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,123
still.

134
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,210
So he's on steroids.

135
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,103
Yeah,

136
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,950
she's fucking Christ.

137
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,390
Might be to be on something.

138
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:04,690
Yeah.

139
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,930
So he's off the pain pills on
steroids and helping out kids.

140
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:08,201
Yeah.

141
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:09,034
There you go.

142
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,990
What the fuck out of a world we live in.

143
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,930
I love that one day we
were eating with them,

144
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,230
uh,

145
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,840
that we're grabbing a burger
or something and he's,

146
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,340
he's got this fanny pack on.

147
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,730
He's like pulling stuff out.

148
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,650
He's trying to find his money,

149
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,130
you know,

150
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:21,401
he's like,

151
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:21,491
oh,

152
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:22,630
I'll pay for it bro.

153
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,970
And he's like moving in slow motion.

154
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:26,020
He's fucking drooling.

155
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:26,321
I'm like,

156
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:27,310
this guy's amazing.

157
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,390
What is going on with this guy?

158
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,540
He's putting all these like
different bottles of pills,

159
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,920
like on the table,

160
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:37,921
he's got like Viagra and a bunch of
other shit and carries a bottle with him.

161
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:38,291
Yeah.

162
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,850
And then he put like his fanny pack.

163
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,500
Well there's Bob tools,

164
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:44,740
the many bottles and then he
puts down like a little bag,

165
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,870
like a clear bag of
something and he's like,

166
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,760
he looks at it and he grabs money clip
and he puts his money on the table and it

167
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:51,940
looks at the clear baggies like,

168
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:52,774
whoops.

169
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,703
And he puts that back,

170
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,850
whatever the fuck that was.

171
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,953
That was like,

172
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,760
that wasn't okay for
him to put on the table.

173
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,790
Everything else was fine for some reason.

174
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,650
He's like,

175
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,483
oops,

176
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,350
big old stack of cash.

177
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,650
That's so crazy.

178
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,380
Oh my God,

179
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:08,681
I was like,

180
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:08,891
dude,

181
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,010
what if you get your pills mixed up like
you're just running a ton of fucking

182
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,070
Viagra and shit like that,

183
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,660
but we have to be weird that when,

184
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,050
when people are taking these powerful
mind altering substances which can have

185
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:22,330
these wonderful things as
you and I have experienced,

186
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,050
we got to be aware that there are people
who are not as stable as they think

187
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:26,830
they are.

188
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,070
People who have deep seeded shit going
on and they don't know what's buried

189
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:33,640
that's going to come flying out
people or don't understand that yet.

190
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,490
If you're going to jump
jump from the first floor,

191
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,430
not the fifth floor,

192
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,580
so we got to make sure because
the jump from the first floor,

193
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,691
the ground floor,

194
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:41,141
the ground.

195
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:41,711
Exactly.

196
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:42,280
You know,

197
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,700
but that it's going to
be so key because I mean,

198
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:44,920
look,

199
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,870
just to shift away from
the sales for a second,

200
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,680
one of the issues we're working on big
time is trying to reduce the number of

201
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:54,970
people dying from overdoses involving
either heroin or pharmaceutical opiates.

202
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,380
For the last couple of years,

203
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,680
more people have died of an accidental
overdose involving heroin or other

204
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:01,520
pharmaceuticals.

205
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,780
They had a car accident is the number
one cause of accidental death in America

206
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:06,614
today.

207
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,070
I mean,

208
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,630
it's absolutely crazy stuff.

209
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,110
Right?

210
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,591
And in fact,

211
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:11,690
when we say overdoses
suggests you took too much.

212
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,750
Most of what our overdose is
actually or drug combinations.

213
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:15,890
They're typically doing this.

214
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:16,580
Opiate,

215
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,151
pharmaceutical,

216
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:17,541
opiate,

217
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,211
oxy Kodo,

218
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,340
and whatever it might be
might be prescribed to you
with booze or with Benzos,

219
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,360
valium type trucks.

220
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:23,840
Right?

221
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,280
So what we're trying to do is to put out
there the notion that don't care if you

222
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:28,611
do it.

223
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:29,390
Opiates,

224
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,890
don't combine it with booze.

225
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,750
Don't combine it with tranquilizers.

226
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,870
There's a miracle drug called the locks
up and we're trying to make that stuff

227
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:37,040
as widely available.

228
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:37,671
Reverses the.

229
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:39,110
It's like an antidote for an overdose.

230
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,220
Make it available.

231
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,370
We're passing nine slash
11 good Samaritan laws.

232
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,990
So if people are around and
a buddy there's overdoses,

233
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,220
they don't just flip out.

234
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,630
They call nine slash 11 right away.

235
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:48,680
The way it was a heart attack.

236
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,401
So you know,

237
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:51,380
it's true with the
psychedelics and marijuana,

238
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,550
but even with the drugs that we see as
less elevated in a way with that huge

239
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:56,930
numbers of people are using life,

240
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:57,764
the opiates.

241
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,390
It's really important that we become more
and more of a society that understands

242
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:06,500
the notion that we need to make
it safer to use these drugs.

243
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:06,861
Right?

244
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:10,070
We got to keep people from getting
hurt the way that people get hurt.
