1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:01,640
Hello,

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,880
freak bitches.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,690
Look for him like this is a win win.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,920
I mean this guy's.

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,470
He's theater hulk.

6
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:11,640
Hogan is theater.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,750
Everything is theater.

8
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:13,590
Did you hear the part?

9
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:17,870
And as in the questioning about his
a 10 inch penis that he said yeah,

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,350
his hogs not as big as the games.

11
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,541
The game,

12
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:22,830
the game doesn't even have to go to court.

13
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,050
It's like look bitch
know how big my dick is.

14
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:27,180
Unless it's a fake Dick,

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,150
the only thing they could do is they'd
have to have some sort of a deposition

16
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:30,984
would pull it out,

17
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,853
shows you,

18
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,580
but he might be a shower and not a
group or a grower and not a shower.

19
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,870
So like he might have to get worked up
to prove it or you're completely right or

20
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:40,441
it's just fake.

21
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,850
He just grabbed some girls Dildo,

22
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:42,661
put in his shorts,

23
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:44,740
tick a photo just to make everyone
go home and go to the copy.

24
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,241
You have a ticket.

25
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:46,360
I mean I've seem to connect.

26
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,580
Well that's you though.

27
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,180
You gotta understand you're
unusual and it's not.

28
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,110
It's connected.

29
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,090
Like the Dick is connected to them.

30
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,201
Like if you look at it,

31
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:56,870
it's obviously like it
doesn't look like a.

32
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,840
If it was a Dildo,

33
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:00,390
there'd be like a dropoff point
at the base and you're like,

34
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:00,780
wait a minute,

35
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,250
how exactly is this thing attached?

36
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,200
You know what I'm saying?

37
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,550
But they didn't have the ones that you
stick onto the side of the wall of the

38
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:07,490
shower maybe just went like on his.

39
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,333
Should be,

40
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,480
could be like he talked,

41
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,610
he talked and had that one too.

42
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:12,660
But even if he stuck it in,

43
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:13,710
it would be going forward.

44
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:15,430
It wouldn't be off to the side like that.

45
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,530
When you have spandex,

46
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:17,880
he probably just put it to the side.

47
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:19,590
It's one of those long double ended ones.

48
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,080
You know that the long snake one.

49
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,590
It's not connected though.

50
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:22,871
I,

51
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:23,071
look,

52
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:23,200
I,

53
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,100
I stared at his dick very carefully

54
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:28,290
and uh,

55
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,440
from what I'm seeing it's a real
dick and it goes with his body.

56
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,460
You know what I'm saying?

57
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,030
It's not like Tony Hinchcliffe has
a fucking oatmeal box in his pants.

58
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,700
So that's quaker oats box.

59
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,800
Somebody had the expression for it.

60
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,350
Somebody had that description I thought
was the funniest description ever.

61
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,040
Quaker oats box for addict.

62
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,390
Well,

63
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,020
who is,

64
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,580
he's holding it even looks like him.

65
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:49,170
This is another one that's even faker.

66
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,400
Um,

67
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,750
no.

68
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,680
It looks like he's
fully hard to tech guys.

69
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,131
Giant.

70
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:54,210
It's got a giant Dick.

71
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,891
Come on sign.

72
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:56,970
You know that Shit's real.

73
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,070
You want it to be real?

74
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,023
No,

75
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,113
I want.

76
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,543
I'm scared.

77
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,560
She that could just be.

78
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:04,940
Oh look.

79
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,710
He's got marijuana leaf
tattooed right above his dick.

80
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,011
Like,

81
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:08,910
what's that supposed to mean?

82
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,450
Yeah.

83
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,230
Smoke it,

84
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:10,561
smoke it.

85
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:15,420
If he got the hashtags he
has on there on his body

86
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,240
will change your life.

87
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,291
Drops.

88
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,124
Mike.

89
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,970
Restructure your day this Dick
and keep them edges slicked down.

90
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,540
This dick can file your nails.

91
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,643
This dick.

92
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,810
This tongue will make you late for work.

93
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:34,140
Wait,

94
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,730
this can be your best friend.

95
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,340
This dick console and bundles.

96
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,660
I'm not sure what that means.

97
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:43,981
If you can.

98
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,180
I'll eat your pussy.

99
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,163
Oh,

100
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,480
you can take the whole thing.

101
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,220
Can you not?

102
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,360
If you can only Hashtag.

103
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:56,361
If you can eat your pussy till
scandal comes back on next week.

104
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,220
He's

105
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,053
funny.

106
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,670
Tag Dick.

107
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,000
Game Strong,

108
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,043
I love that.

109
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,221
Let me tell you something.

110
00:03:07,221 --> 00:03:09,230
Chocolate Hershey's
chocolate with almonds.

111
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,040
Still to this day is fucking
bang up first charter,

112
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,023
which America,

113
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,360
Terry Hershey's chocolate
and Jif peanut butter.

114
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,120
Break off the fucking pieces of the
Hershey's chocolate with almonds and dig

115
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:26,270
into a big Vat of Jif peanut butter cup.

116
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:28,640
POW for skippy.

117
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:29,474
You want to get crazy

118
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,360
when they try to sell us that bullshit
where it was a stripe of jelly and a

119
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,340
striped peanut butter and a stripe.

120
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:38,630
Fuck you.

121
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,660
Unless you're eating with a spoon
straight out of the jar into your mouth,

122
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,020
it's like,

123
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,260
no.

124
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,480
I decide how much jelly,

125
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,450
how much peanut butter goes on it.

126
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,403
This is stupid.

127
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,790
We're having a party for uh,

128
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,211
for.

129
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:48,530
This is not happening for my show.

130
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:49,881
Every Tuesday night,

131
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:50,714
12:30 AM,

132
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,331
three episodes left.

133
00:03:53,331 --> 00:03:53,930
He has his color,

134
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,763
but anyway,

135
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,840
so we had s'mores.

136
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,340
We hit the back of Eric and sandy place.

137
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,183
There was a little fire pit,

138
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,250
smores and rock.

139
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,021
I just burned him.

140
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:01,160
I just burned the mushroom,

141
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,440
the mushroom marshmallow
and stick it on there.

142
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,650
And then Scott,

143
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,330
Brian Ball journey.

144
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:05,760
He's like,

145
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,090
dude,

146
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,190
I was a cub scout for 12 years.

147
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,053
That's not how you do it.

148
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,013
Let me show you,

149
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,290
and for the next 10 minutes he perfectly
browned this marshmallow from like

150
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,620
eight feet above the fire,

151
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,920
like just made it so long
and they turn into goes,

152
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,820
see now this is a slapped it on there

153
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,770
that was waiting for her to finish.

154
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,790
He's the Franklins of.

155
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,420
Oh my God.

156
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,810
That's hilarious.

157
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:41,320
Dude.

158
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,380
You just shit on the Franklin Morris.

159
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,280
I love slap people's heads.

160
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,880
I did it out of Gomez.

161
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,420
Had said he had an altoids
tin that was open for so long.

162
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,800
Hey Mike,

163
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,470
why you leave?

164
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,100
You're making.

165
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,370
I don't want to do this too.

166
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,010
You're forcing my hand and then you
just slapped it up and he goes to

167
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,623
the seller.

168
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,030
I'll look on the ground.

169
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,370
We found a lot of them

170
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,620
slept food,

171
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,810
so I would say it Josh
Martin and did that.

172
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,480
He was coming out of the
back with a fucking pretzel.

173
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,314
I'll cover with

174
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:18,940
just.

175
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,570
It's only great when they
can easily replace it.

176
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,291
Yes.

177
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:23,610
So you've got to get here
that five bucks back.

178
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,660
Go deal with it.

179
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,621
If I ever got a lot of money,

180
00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:27,540
I would smash people's iphones
and just stomp on them.

181
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,100
Here's $700.

182
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,950
But then what if they're in the middle
of like a really important conversation,

183
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:32,220
right?

184
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,820
Babysitter.

185
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,090
Yeah.

186
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:33,923
Now you get it.

187
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:35,671
Anyway,

188
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:35,941
Josh,

189
00:05:35,941 --> 00:05:36,601
mark comes out.

190
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:37,750
I just locked that it goes.

191
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,161
Oh.

192
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:39,480
And I can see he's looking at like,

193
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:40,320
maybe I'll eat it anyway.

194
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,240
You're making me step on this man.

195
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,520
Me Step on this.

196
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,640
You're leaving me no choice.

197
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,613
These are star.

198
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,840
These are the stars.

199
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:49,530
That debt.

200
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,720
So these purple ones are 200 milligrams.

201
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,710
This is what this is.

202
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,471
Take one of those.

203
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:56,430
I'll sleep for three days.

204
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,890
This is one to one.

205
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,310
Do you think you'd deal with this?

206
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,150
How many?

207
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,320
How many milligrams are in those 200
and this one you just threw a $200.

208
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,230
I had to go.

209
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,170
You got to go.

210
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,410
I don't want to take one of these days.

211
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,181
I don't know if you know,

212
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:13,250
but like an effective dose is 20.

213
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,890
What is he popping up to?

214
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:16,540
200.

215
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,373
Well I can't.

216
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,021
I can't.

217
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:18,854
I can't smoke.

218
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,300
I got the,

219
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,010
I could open up with three of these.

220
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,770
I can open up with 600 milligrams,

221
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,253
just

222
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,460
no idea how insanely good at bed at night.

223
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,241
Like a baby.

224
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,440
I put that mask on.

225
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,120
I sleep like a fucking baby
sometimes I get paranoid,

226
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,320
my sleep and I wake up
at three in the morning.

227
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,243
My heart pounds.

228
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,210
Wake my wife up.

229
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,183
I'll tell you what,

230
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,890
I'll tell you why I stay away from the
edible because like I like to smoke at

231
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:49,290
night,

232
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:49,690
right,

233
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,440
right.

234
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,711
Alright.

235
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,810
So I got high one night and
when I was at this one place,

236
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,190
they gave me some edibles.

237
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,660
They gave me a bag of popcorn.

238
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:57,843
Okay.

239
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,070
So I'm going to stand out and
I just want something to eat.

240
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:02,390
So I opened up the popcorn.

241
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,943
Okay.

242
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,460
Now the next day Valerie is.

243
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,070
She can't figure out
why I'm not waking up.

244
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,870
I slept for 19 hours and she
found the wrapper under the bed.

245
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:18,210
She was starting to panic
like what happened to it?

246
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,320
I slept till till midnight the next day.

247
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:23,301
She goes,

248
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,380
you wait for so big.

249
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:26,150
I said I didn't know I was stoned at.

250
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:27,320
I just want some need.

251
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,131
It was popcorn.

252
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:31,490
I didn't think they really like
Hadley even getting into popcorn.

253
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,840
They make it with the butter,

254
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,360
the cannabis butter and they pop it
in the butter and then they might even

255
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:40,010
sprinkle some butter on top of it.

256
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,630
Some cannabis butter and fuck you up.

257
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,513
Take on.

258
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,210
Now they had a benefit of pot benefit
at the store and they were handing out

259
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:48,044
those bags,

260
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,370
bags of that popcorn.

261
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,870
It was fucking death.

262
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:51,340
Death.

263
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,011
We'll open it up.

264
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:53,750
It smells like scared.

265
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,890
Pure fucking weed.

266
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,110
I felt so vulnerable.

267
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,660
I just love how open it is now.

268
00:07:59,710 --> 00:07:59,830
No,

269
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,231
it's great.

270
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,580
We can talk about a.

271
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,640
you're popping them like 10 packs,

272
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,150
but dice not everywhere else.

273
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,960
If you tried to do this in Texas,

274
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:09,170
still fucking die waiting for you outside.

275
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:09,411
Yeah,

276
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:11,420
but I have no reason to be in Texas.

277
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,800
You don't do shows in Texas?

278
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,813
I don't believe in it.

279
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,520
No.

280
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,650
I've gone to Texas,

281
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,381
but like,

282
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:18,601
uh,

283
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:18,731
uh,

284
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,131
you know,

285
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,510
in Vegas it's great.

286
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,160
Now that we're opening up places.

287
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:22,490
Yeah.

288
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,390
They got five stores,

289
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:23,770
right?

290
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,640
They haven't gone to any of them.

291
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,740
I normally bring my own stuff,

292
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,831
you know,

293
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:30,290
or if I go to New York,

294
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,610
I'll bring my own stuff.

295
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,210
It's one of the easiest businesses
and that the at the end of the day,

296
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,040
businessman want to be businessmen.

297
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,530
They want to make some money and they.

298
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:39,680
They look at this thing and they go,

299
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:40,200
Hey,

300
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,200
do you have much fucking money
they're making in Colorado?

301
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,860
They made more money in taxes in
Colorado from weed and they did alcohol.

302
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,360
That's never happened anywhere.

303
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,380
That's definitely take wheat over alcohol.

304
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,020
Anything 100 percent because you know
what I always say like with weed,

305
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,320
like a stone as you are,

306
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,681
let's say,

307
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,780
God forbid there's some kind of emergency.

308
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:58,861
You know what I mean?

309
00:08:58,861 --> 00:08:59,250
Right.

310
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,780
You just throw water in your face.

311
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,500
It's gone.

312
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,610
It's not like alcohol.

313
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,860
You know where you don't
know what you do it.

314
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,131
Right,

315
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:05,371
right,

316
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:05,491
right.

317
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:06,031
You know what I mean?

318
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:07,500
You could perform on the weeds.

319
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:09,150
You go bang on the weed.

320
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,030
You could bang more on the wheels.

321
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:13,570
Better listen to

322
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,500
you eat one of these doors.

323
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:21,420
Ain't no water going to help you fucking
fucking fire departments that you're

324
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:23,220
reading like a pint didit stuff.
