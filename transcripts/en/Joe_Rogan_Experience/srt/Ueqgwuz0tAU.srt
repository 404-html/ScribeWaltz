1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,760
Try My day,
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,493
People love both ways.
It's interesting like people love your 

3
00:00:08,081 --> 00:00:08,914
way,
but people also love like shit talking 

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,000
[inaudible] people love Nate Diaz for 
that.

5
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:15,220
And people love,
they love the drama,

6
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:18,900
but they also love someone like you walk
up to holly and hug her.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,833
Yeah.
Yeah.

8
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,980
Middle though,
because I get a lot of flack for,

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,091
you know,
my mouth like,

10
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:26,050
so you just can't get it.
I say what I'm thinking and I'm,

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,060
I'm pretty transparent and sometimes 
people think that,

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:29,910
you know,
I get a lot of flag,

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,890
oh,
you're fake or this.

14
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:32,390
And I'm like,
not really,

15
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:33,081
like,
just because,

16
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:33,561
you know,
I'm like,

17
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:35,630
I'll say this like I'm a fan of connor.
I am,

18
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:36,840
I like his fighting style.
And I,

19
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:37,311
I,
you know,

20
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:39,380
his antics at first were kind of like,
wait,

21
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:40,310
who is this guy?
What is it?

22
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:41,450
You know?
And then I'm like,

23
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:43,070
man,
props to him.

24
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,180
He's done amazing things like good for 
him and he's done really good things for

25
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:49,490
our sport.
But when you didn't show up to film that

26
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,490
commercial,
like I'm not getting,

27
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,520
you know,
I'll be honest,

28
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,383
like yeah,
I kind of rubbed me the wrong way 

29
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:56,000
because um,
people are like,

30
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:58,040
oh,
he does so much more media than you guys

31
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:58,400
do.

32
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,233
Yeah,
it probably does.

33
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,110
You know,
he probably does.

34
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:01,820
I do a lot.
He probably does more.

35
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,773
I agree.
But I don't have a private jet flying 

36
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:07,640
out to pick me up and bring me back and 
fly 20 people in my crew with me too.

37
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,533
He does more.
So he gets more when they bring them to 

38
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:11,390
Vegas,
they put them up in a penthouse,

39
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:13,010
you know,
they make sure he has everything that he

40
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:14,330
needs.
I don't get that.

41
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,710
You don't know.
That's fine.

42
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,700
You know,
he's earned that.

43
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,980
He's in that spot.
No problem with that.

44
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,590
But I think three months out from a 
fight camp,

45
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,513
you know,
you have a private jet coming to pick 

46
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:25,390
you up with.
You can bring 20 of your teammates.

47
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,263
You could probably work out on the jet 
if you want to on the way there because 

48
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:29,780
it's yours,
it's private.

49
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,010
Do whatever you want.
Right.

50
00:01:31,011 --> 00:01:32,450
You could probably hit mitts on a jet.
Yeah,

51
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,710
you could totally,
you know what I mean?

52
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:37,130
You're three months out and you don't 
want to show for your media obligations.

53
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:41,840
Like I don't really understand that.
I don't like it just,

54
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:43,280
I don't know.
I guess I'm trying to figure it out,

55
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:46,550
but the only issue that I had and it,
it doesn't bother me.

56
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:48,440
Like if he didn't want to do it,
that's his own thing.

57
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,303
The thing is,
is that I showed up the day to film the 

58
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,944
commercial and I had two segments I was 
supposed to film and that's all it was 

59
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,360
on my schedule.
And then they asked me like,

60
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,693
they were like,
can you please help us out because 

61
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:00,734
Connor's not here and uh,
we don't know what we're doing for this 

62
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,960
third segment of the commercial that was
supposed to be conor and nate.

63
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,100
So can you please come back later that 
day and film that segment.

64
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,680
And also with that was during my 
practice time,

65
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,510
so I had to come back and you know,
I did it.

66
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,500
So it was a company woman,
but like it was just frustrating because

67
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:19,760
it's like Dang,
you know,

68
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:20,594
if I had known about this,
I could've planned my training 

69
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:22,814
otherwise,
but now I kind of have to like scramble 

70
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:26,030
to get my second workout in and then it 
affected me.

71
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,040
So yeah,
his decision did,

72
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:29,450
and it probably is actually,
you know,

73
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,000
I haven't made any more money in the 
sport yet because of Connor.

74
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:34,160
A lot of people like to like,
oh you must have got a bigger payday.

75
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:35,150
Cause I'll ask them like,
no,

76
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:35,984
cause I wasn't the champion so I didn't 
get any more of like and get any paper 

77
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,280
views.
I didn't get any more money.

78
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:42,130
And now he's like not on this fight 
card.

79
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:43,700
So I'm like,
you know,

80
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:44,660
but it's where ever,
you know,

81
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:46,340
it's,
it's connors deal and,

82
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:46,920
uh,
I,

83
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,090
I don't hate connor,
but I going to say how I feel,

84
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,223
you know?
And I would say it if he was sitting 

85
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:52,580
here to be like,
dude,

86
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,710
why did you do that?
You'd probably,

87
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,410
well,
I,

88
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,410
I feel like there's a bunch of issues 
here and we know,

89
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,244
and the only way to really get a firm 
understanding of it is to sit down with 

90
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:06,760
everyone involved and say what was 
communicated your manager,

91
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:07,594
did he know what the,
what the appearance schedule was going 

92
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,890
to be like,
did you guys agree to this?

93
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,930
Did you understand what you were getting
into when you're fighting?

94
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:15,370
Maybe it's a misunderstanding,
you know,

95
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,930
who knows?
It's hard to say,

96
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:20,260
but it's the way he went about it was 
ridiculous.

97
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:21,430
Like saying,
I'm retired,

98
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,650
thanks for the cheese.
And then saying I'm not retired.

99
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:24,690
And then saying,
ah,

100
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,070
I'm glad the UFC decided to give the 
fans what they want and be a,

101
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,490
I'm going to be on UFC 200 numbers.
Like what?

102
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,403
And so like what he's doing is he's kind
of like using the media to try to get 

103
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,224
this thing to pass through,
but he doesn't understand Dana and 

104
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:45,070
Lorenzo and frank,
like that's never going to work.

105
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,090
Like you're you,
you're either in or you're not in.

106
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,430
Right.
And they're like real clear about that.

107
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,070
They have to set a precedent.
So like if you say fuck you,

108
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm not doing media.
And they kind of go,

109
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,411
oh well,
okay,

110
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:57,490
fuck you.
You're not fighting.

111
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,450
Yeah,
but hold on,

112
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:01,160
I'm conor mcgregor where the UFC,
yeah,

113
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,230
this is what it is.

114
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,660
Made my new stars.
They'll make many more.

115
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:04,800
Right.

116
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,530
And we might lose millions of dollars 
because you're not on UFC 200

117
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,380
yeah,
well he,

118
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,410
he,
he had put,

119
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,830
they put 10 million ended up promoting 
this Saturday tonight and he's like,

120
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:14,820
we're way over budget.
You know?

121
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:15,654
So that's why he's was like,
you've got to show up and do you know 

122
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,810
that's how connor was made.
Yes.

123
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,551
It's true.
That stuff.

124
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,384
So now like at what point do you get to 
decide that you don't have to do that 

125
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:26,550
anymore?
Like if that's what made you who you are

126
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:28,380
like I mean don't you kind of have to 
like,

127
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,830
does that make sense what I'm saying 
here?

128
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,473
I mean at what point do you get to 
decide like when you don't have to like 

129
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,153
I use the machine and now like I don't,
I just want to hop off now that I'm 

130
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:39,070
here,
you know,

131
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,903
and like,
I don't know.

132
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,750
So you kind of have to keep it the same

133
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,320
boys?
I think so.

134
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:46,030
But there,
there is also like a fine line,

135
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:47,230
right?
Like you can do too much.

136
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,590
Like when I was watching the Josie Aldo 
media tour,

137
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,030
when they were going all around the 
world,

138
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:52,864
I'm like,
okay,

139
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,530
I understand that you want to promote 
this fight.

140
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:57,364
Yeah.
But how much of this is helping the 

141
00:04:58,781 --> 00:04:59,614
actual fight itself?
How much of it is just conor mcgregor 

142
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:02,884
constantly talking Shit at press 
conferences and grabbing the belt and 

143
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:05,990
all that?
That,

144
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,860
I mean that's really kind of what 
selling the fight was that,

145
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,960
I don't know.
I did a lot of it,

146
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:13,990
but apparently connor was sick.
Like he was like,

147
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:17,080
I'm just constantly fighting off a cold.
It's really hard to get in shape,

148
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:19,660
really hard to train because every week,
you know,

149
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:21,850
you're traveling from here to there and 
there to here.

150
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:22,684
It's just,
you're constantly getting beaten down 

151
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,630
and you know what it's like if I give 
you up.

152
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,490
Have you ever flown to Brazil and 
fought?

153
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,950
No.
I fall in there for fight cards though.

154
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,180
What is the,
um,

155
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,920
the furthest you've ever had a flight of
fight?

156
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,510
Japan.
Japan.

157
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,850
So that's an interesting one.
Cause that's a long flight.

158
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:38,050
It's like 16 hours,
right?

159
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,741
Yeah.
What does it,

160
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:39,131
uh,
like,

161
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:39,964
like,
uh,

162
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,100
like adjusting and then competing?

163
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,173
Um,
I try to start adjusting my schedule at 

164
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:46,414
home,
like blacking out my windows a little 

165
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,310
bit or you know,
like to,

166
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:51,040
to make the timeframe,
but you've never get fully adjusted.

167
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,810
But the,
my mind frame is like when,

168
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,730
when push comes to shove,
when fight time comes,

169
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:57,040
well that's two in the morning,
my time or not like I'm going to be,

170
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,290
so I would just look at it that way.
But it's not fun.

171
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,230
Like,
I remember three weeks out from my fight

172
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:05,180
with written to Chi,
which I didn't even want to,

173
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,060
I didn't want to do that fight because 
she was so unknown.

174
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,953
She was undefeated.
I'm going over there to like fight on a 

175
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,310
newly blooming fight pass.
And I was like,

176
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,770
this is like,
feels like it does nothing for me.

177
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:16,860
And like,
and if she wins it,

178
00:06:16,861 --> 00:06:17,960
springboards her,
you know,

179
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,600
then she'll be 17 to know,
shove a judo background,

180
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:22,070
they're going to want to make that fight
for,

181
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,120
for her.
And Rhonda,

182
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:25,130
I know that's what they're trying to do 
is they're trying to use,

183
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,323
you know,
business use me as that springboard and 

184
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,510
was like I don't really want to spend,
I did it.

185
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,733
But three weeks before the fight they 
had me fly to Japan to do some 

186
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,620
promotional stuff and I was flying 
longer than I was even on the ground.

187
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,890
And they said like ticket sales went up 
and everything was really good.

188
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:41,750
But yeah,
that was exhausting.

189
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,740
So I do,
I understand that.

190
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,470
Yeah,
that's hard.

191
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,960
Really hard.
You're peaking right really hard.

192
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:48,080
Ramping it up three weeks

193
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,380
for hard.
And after my fight with the holly,

194
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:52,214
like I got to spend a little time in 
Australia and then I went straight from 

195
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:56,840
Australia to New York.
Spent a day there,

196
00:06:56,841 --> 00:07:00,530
did a full day of media,
went to Connecticut to espn,

197
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:02,000
did a full day of media,
went to Toronto,

198
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:03,350
did a full day meeting.
And it's just like,

199
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,880
it's non stop from like you start your 
first interview at eight in the morning,

200
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:09,714
so you'll pick up at like seven and you 
go until seven at night and even while 

201
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:16,940
you're driving to the next place they'll
have you on the phone.

202
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,620
Was with the,
with the,

203
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,550
with the,
you know,

204
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,990
with the radio interview,
you know,

205
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:22,970
I mean there's no break.
It's all,

206
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,740
it's,
it's pretty intense.

207
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,990
It's pretty crazy.
It's pretty exhausting site.

208
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,540
I get it.
And I have been in those shoes before,

209
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,610
but um,
you know,

210
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:32,570
it's,
I don't know,

211
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:34,940
maybe there's more extended research.
Maybe he was hurt or something.

212
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:36,740
Maybe you didn't want people to see like
maybe,

213
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,870
I don't know.
Like what if there's even something like

214
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:39,321
that.
Like,

215
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:40,154
what if he had like hurt himself or 
something and he didn't want like nate 

216
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:42,764
to know.

217
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,250
Yeah.
Who knows?

218
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,480
I Dunno.
Who knows?

219
00:07:45,481 --> 00:07:46,314
And it's also,
he also had to realize there was a lot 

220
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,220
of work that needed to be done to beat 
nate.

221
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,770
Yeah.
Like he's hit nate with some of his best

222
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:56,670
shots and nate was fine with it and it 
was a real problem.

223
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,043
That's more what it was,
is that he was just obsessed with 

224
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:00,270
beating nay.
And I,

225
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,163
I get that too.
I don't take that away from him for a 

226
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:03,684
minute.
Like he wanted to stay home and he was 

227
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:08,100
in Iceland I guess training and he wants
to train to be nate.

228
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:09,810
I get it.
Totally get it.

229
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,730
Yeah,
I get it too.

230
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,000
It seems like the only way also I felt 
like,

231
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,680
but then again he could have brought his
whole gym with him,

232
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,693
you know,
I mean it was going to be a difficult 

233
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,880
time just trying to find,
uh,

234
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,600
the,
the moments to train and do,

235
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:24,434
stay in shape and then obviously being 
exhausted from flying and all that jazz 

236
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,140
quick turnaround too.
You know,

237
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:30,974
like as far as like,
I don't think he was supposed to be 

238
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:32,984
there more than like two days.
I honestly think he's better off not 

239
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,314
doing it.
I honestly think he's better off like 

240
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:42,740
sequestering himself for a few months.
Like really focusing on what went wrong,

241
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,320
how to correct it and can you correct 
it?

242
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,183
Yeah.
I mean do you like when it comes to the 

243
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:50,810
ground game,
what I saw on the ground,

244
00:08:50,811 --> 00:08:52,760
I was like,
boy this is a long road.

245
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,650
Like you've got a long road to beat.
A guy like nate,

246
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,550
he's so much further along in,
in,

247
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,710
in ground and pound Jujitsu,
positioning everything.

248
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,590
When I was watching nate beat him up on 
the ground and choke him,

249
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:05,424
I was like,
Whoa,

250
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,650
that happened quick.
This is not like a,

251
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,493
like Weidman and rockhold was a 
prolonged beating before rockhold 

252
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:15,040
eventually stopped him the next round.
Yeah.

253
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,980
But with why with nate and connor wasn't
that prolonged.

254
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:22,920
It happened pretty quickly.
And when you see that you go,

255
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,050
Ooh,
like this is going to be,

256
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,943
this is a lot to overcome.
It's not an unsurmountable build that 

257
00:09:29,461 --> 00:09:30,770
those skill sets,
they don't just,

258
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,850
they don't come overnight.
You don't,

259
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,910
he can pick up your cardio pretty quick.
You can do a lot of things.

260
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:35,744
We can't,
you can't build a skill set any faster 

261
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:40,280
than it's going to go into your muscle 
memory and being your effort.

262
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,710
You've got to put thousands of reps in 
and there's no way around it.

263
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:44,963
There's no way.
There's no way to fast forward through 

264
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:47,460
that.
There's no way to cut the corner.

265
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,230
There's no,
there's nothing.

266
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:50,760
You can't just repetition,
repetition,

267
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:51,594
repetition would also,
it highlights all the various eccentric 

268
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:57,240
aspects of your training that people are
like,

269
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,950
hmm,
is this what makes connor great?

270
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,193
And you know,
and then you know nate calling it touch 

271
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:02,070
button,
the park,

272
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,320
like they do it,
all these cartwheels and stuff.

273
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,100
Then video is so funny.
Hilarious.

274
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,260
My God I was dying laughing areas.
So when this all,

275
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,310
you know he's doing all these,
this work with this movement guy.

276
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,473
But then you see what happens when it 
actually comes to fighting skills and 

277
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,530
you go oh maybe this is not the way to 
do it.

278
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,783
Cause like I've talked to a lot of 
people that were like this stuff that 

279
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:32,820
he's doing his utter horse shit like 
this,

280
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,370
doing cartwheels and being obsessed with
movement.

281
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,140
Here's the movements you need to be 
worried about.

282
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:38,610
Okay,
moving your feet,

283
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:39,444
throwing kicks and punches,
take down defense and Jujitsu on the 

284
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,380
ground.
That's it.

285
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,420
You know,
understanding takedowns yourself,

286
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:47,670
taking people down if you must trip 
sweeps,

287
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,533
all that stuff.
But all this cartwheels and what this 

288
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:52,044
guy was explaining to me and I want to 
name any names cause he's a prominent 

289
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:54,564
guy,
he was like you have to understand that 

290
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,114
there's a limited amount of energy you 
have in your time training and you are 

291
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:05,010
not perfect at all these other aspects 
of mma.

292
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,023
So if you are not perfect,
all these other aspects of him that you 

293
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:09,600
have to say,
okay how much?

294
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,513
Yeah,
how much of this stuff is going to help 

295
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:13,050
me?
Well a guy like George Saint Pierre,

296
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,033
he looked at gymnastics and he was like,
you know what's going to help me if I 

297
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:20,340
can be stronger physically and there's 
no better way.

298
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,010
I think like as far as like manipulating
your body.

299
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,120
Then gymnastics,
like doing the rings and developing.

300
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,483
Yeah.
You're learning how to manipulate your 

301
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:31,500
body and all kinds of contorted 
positions.

302
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,990
Being upside down and understanding 
where you are.

303
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:36,810
When you're upside down,
you're going to be with the momentum you

304
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:37,644
have.
You have to calculate that your math is 

305
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,550
doing constant algorithms and math 
equations.

306
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:42,384
Essentially.
When you're fighting to weight 

307
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,210
distribution,
where are we at?

308
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:46,750
Especially when you tie up with someone 
else,

309
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:47,584
then you have to feel their weight and 
you have to manipulate it in a way to 

310
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,260
get it where you want.
Whether it's against the cage or whether

311
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:54,430
it's on the ground.
Your body is using

312
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,690
a equation.
Yeah.

313
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,690
You know,
your mind is equating,

314
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,720
how much force do I need to make this 
happen?

315
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,450
How little force?
Like what if I go the opposite direction

316
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:05,284
because they're pushing into me.
There's all these different things that 

317
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:08,074
you have to over.
There's no other way to do it then than 

318
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:13,810
a trial and error process and over and 
over and over and over again.

319
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,750
Yeah.

320
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,700
Look at someone who's like really good 
at one aspect of it.

321
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:22,080
I may like Yoel Romero who's just a 
ridiculous wrestler and you go,

322
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:23,840
okay,
look how much touch button the park.

323
00:12:23,841 --> 00:12:25,800
Is that guy doing?
You know,

324
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,300
how many cartwheels is he doing?
Is he tumbling?

325
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,483
No,
but I bet you he does a hundred double 

326
00:12:30,661 --> 00:12:31,830
eggs a day.
Oh yeah,

327
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:32,843
it'll least,
well he's doing all kinds of eggs and 

328
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,200
then a hundred body locks.
Then you know,

329
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,660
connor lost,
everybody was like,

330
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,700
this is what we need.
We need a movement coach.

331
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,560
I need a movement coach.
You know,

332
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,483
and it still might,
I mean as we said with George Saint 

333
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,291
Pierre,
it,

334
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,950
it has massive benefits to get that kind
of coordination.

335
00:12:49,951 --> 00:12:50,650
Physical strength.

336
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,270
Do you like about connor though is like,
um,

337
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,060
his balance is impeccable and that could
be part of that.

338
00:12:57,061 --> 00:13:01,210
And like he's never over himself,
at least with the striking part of it.

339
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,063
And you know,
the ground is a completely different 

340
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,860
thing,
but when he's in striking range in his,

341
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:09,580
just his body,
his eye hand coordination is incredible.

342
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,210
And his balance.
Like he's never too far over a punch.

343
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:15,640
He's never too far back.
He's always centered,

344
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,590
is always centered.
He throws a kick,

345
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,671
he never gets,
you know,

346
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:19,504
you see people kick and they miss and 
they kind of like stumble like their 

347
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:23,920
weights off balance or,
or they kick and even land and even when

348
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:25,090
they put their foot down,
it's kind of like,

349
00:13:25,091 --> 00:13:26,680
it's not a good landing.
You know,

350
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,480
like I,
I'm not like the world's best kicker,

351
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:29,314
but when I watched conor do it,
it's like he kicks or push kicks and 

352
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,480
sticks it.
He is like,

353
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,520
uh,
like a a gymnast in the sense,

354
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:38,020
you know,
they do those flip and then they want to

355
00:13:38,021 --> 00:13:39,650
just boom,
stick it like,

356
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,030
and he's really,
really good at that.

357
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,530
Maybe that's where the movement does 
benefit,

358
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:47,020
I think.
So that he never is over himself and his

359
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:47,850
weight distribution,

360
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,683
isn't it the case that whenever someone 
loses though everyone always second 

361
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:55,150
guesses what they were doing.
Even if what they were doing was getting

362
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:58,300
them to be like 16 to know.
Totally undefeated world champion.

363
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,613
When you'd make a mistake or something 
goes wrong or something goes right for 

364
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:04,054
your opponent,
we should probably say immediately 

365
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,670
people start questioning everything you 
did.

366
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,450
Yeah,
definitely.

367
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,360
All the time it happened with me even,
you know,

368
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,130
when I lost to Toronto,
that guy,

369
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:14,630
you got to change this,
you gotta change everything.

370
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:15,800
But as long as you're winning people 
like,

371
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:16,790
yeah,
keep doing what you're doing,

372
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:17,624
it's working.
And then he lose and like change 

373
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:21,230
everything.
It's like,

374
00:14:21,231 --> 00:14:22,640
Geez,
that was quick.

375
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,490
It's

376
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,620
also the Rhonda criticism in the Holly 
Holm fight.

377
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:29,100
Everybody was like looking at her like a
dominating vechicle.

378
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,960
Heyo would stand up.
You know,

379
00:14:30,961 --> 00:14:33,390
I'm beating Sarah McMahon the way she 
did.

380
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:36,060
Alexis Davis beating her down the way 
she did and go,

381
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:36,894
well look,
Rhonda obviously is getting so good at 

382
00:14:38,581 --> 00:14:39,414
striking.
She's just such an elite athlete that 

383
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:41,724
she can do what she's doing to anybody.
And then her trainer saying that she 

384
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,580
could go box women professionals and 
knock them out.

385
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:51,060
And so you get this thing in your head 
that you can do,

386
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,990
you have been doing.
Yeah.

387
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,800
And then you fight someone like holly 
and you go,

388
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,311
Oh,
well,

389
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,290
okay,
yeah.

390
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,440
This is where there's,
so,

391
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,890
there's so many levels.
I mean,

392
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,753
it's one of the more fascinating things 
about martial arts is that there are so 

393
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:04,790
many levels.
Yeah.

394
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,620
There's never,
it's never ending.

395
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,310
Never ending story really is,
right.

396
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,593
Yeah.

397
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,430
[inaudible] okay.
