1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,623
Okay,

2
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,310
boom,

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,970
boom,

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:13,630
boom,

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:13,901
boom.

6
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:14,710
We're live.

7
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,521
We're live with the lines,

8
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:15,801
our boat.

9
00:00:15,801 --> 00:00:19,000
And he just got back spray and
chem trails for the past six hours.

10
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:19,551
All Crile.

11
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:21,070
I'm Joe Southern California.

12
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:23,290
He's controlling minds and the weather.

13
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,090
There's a reason why
it's cloudy out folks.

14
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:26,340
It's Alonzo Boden,

15
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:26,921
hilarious,

16
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:29,760
standup comedian slash
weather modification experts.

17
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:30,911
What's was up,

18
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:31,210
Joe?

19
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,770
Nothing was going to rain tonight.

20
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm just saying.

21
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,730
I'm just saying I can't
believe it that you know,

22
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:38,830
you might want to put the
top up when the convertible.

23
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,330
Why are you working for the man?

24
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,080
Hey,

25
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,920
it pays well,

26
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,840
but you make great money.

27
00:00:43,841 --> 00:00:44,531
You're a comic.

28
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:45,011
You do well.

29
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:45,910
You're very successful.

30
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:46,421
I know Joe.

31
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:46,781
But you know,

32
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,280
ever since Obama took over,

33
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,990
I mean he gave me a call.

34
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:50,261
He said,

35
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:50,620
look alive,

36
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,880
so we need a brother on the weather.

37
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:52,091
I said,

38
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:52,840
I got you.

39
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,710
I got you.

40
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:55,900
So this is part of that whole thing.

41
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,000
So it's part of like black lives matter.

42
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,440
I just want to let you in.

43
00:00:59,560 --> 00:00:59,711
Oh,

44
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:00,220
okay.

45
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:00,970
I understand.

46
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:01,803
That makes sense.

47
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:02,590
Look,

48
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,600
you gotta do what you gotta
do in this crazy world.

49
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,940
And a little weather
modification is on the menu.

50
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:07,901
Yeah.

51
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,290
Well,

52
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:08,740
you know,

53
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,431
then I'm kicking,

54
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:12,610
I'm getting some of the ski
resort money from mammoth.

55
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,241
You know,

56
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,560
that's like a side hustle.

57
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,840
They say this winter is
going to be fucking crazy.

58
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,250
The weather modification experts.

59
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:20,560
I'm just here to let you know El Nino,

60
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,090
do you believe in an El Nino?

61
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,973
But is that real?

62
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,411
Yeah,

63
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:24,244
I think that is,

64
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,671
but,

65
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:25,504
but whether,

66
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,190
you know what's so
funny about the weather?

67
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:28,024
Like they,

68
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,830
they really don't know it at
best it's an educated guess.

69
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,430
Right?

70
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,270
So when they say something like
there's a change in an ocean current,

71
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:38,350
like that's what El Nino is,

72
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:38,560
right?

73
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Like there's warm water flowing through
the ocean where it's normally cold and

74
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:46,540
that's going to bring more water vapor.

75
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,690
And I get that on the large scale,

76
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,430
but they can never say,

77
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:51,761
okay,

78
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:55,300
it's going to rain Tuesday
between noon and four o'clock.

79
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:58,810
Like th there are times
when they're so wrong.

80
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,171
It's comical.

81
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:04,510
Like in any other job you'd be fired
for being that far off and they're like,

82
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:04,770
oh,

83
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,603
we missed.

84
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,680
But compared to like how they used to be,

85
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,340
it's fucking amazing when they used to
just look up at the sky and when there

86
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,160
are clouds are running
well we better get inside.

87
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,790
That was it.

88
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,623
Yeah.

89
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,690
They knew a tornado was coming cause you
could see the tornado coming like that

90
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:22,924
was a,

91
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,501
you know,

92
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:23,740
but,

93
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,810
but then you have the other things like a,

94
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:28,450
in Phoenix they have whether people,

95
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,810
right?

96
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,810
Like what is your job from April
through November in Phoenix.

97
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:35,711
Yeah.

98
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:40,060
It's going to be hot zit
sunny hot feedback tomorrow.

99
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,050
Like there's,

100
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,110
there's nothing else in what
it in July they have oh yeah.

101
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:44,900
It's going to be monsoon.

102
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,160
It's going to rain between
three and four men.

103
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,160
It's going to be hot again.

104
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,090
Yeah.

105
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,900
There's no weather.

106
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,640
And then La,

107
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,340
the same thing.

108
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:51,611
I mean,

109
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:55,720
over the summer it's occasionally you
get like a little bit of rain in La.

110
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,041
Yeah.

111
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,000
What did it rain like
maybe four times this year?

112
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,540
Yeah.

113
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:58,811
Yeah.

114
00:02:58,811 --> 00:02:59,644
I,

115
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,813
I did a thing with,

116
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,031
uh,

117
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:01,571
what's his name?

118
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:03,700
The comics slash weatherman.

119
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,150
Uh,

120
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,983
Fritz Rogan.

121
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,010
Um,

122
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:06,641
Fred Rogan.

123
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:07,070
Fred?

124
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,280
No.

125
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,700
Or Fritz Fritz called Colmar.

126
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:09,400
It's cold.

127
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,910
I get him confused with
that other guys here.

128
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,450
Oh,

129
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,430
that's the sports guy.

130
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,283
Their partners,

131
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,200
right?

132
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,441
Yeah.

133
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:17,530
I did a thing with Fritz Coleman
and one of his funniest jokes.

134
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:17,891
He said,

135
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,630
you think it's easy doing weather in la?

136
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,530
He said,

137
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,850
think of 300 different ways to
say partly cloudy in the morning,

138
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,200
sunny in the afternoon.

139
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:28,810
Well,

140
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,190
it gives you a lot of time to write jokes.

141
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:30,600
Yeah,

142
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:30,970
absolutely.

143
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,130
Good Gig for comic.

144
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,063
Yeah.

145
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,410
Plus you get on TV if they
let you plug your gigs.

146
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:35,771
Yeah.

147
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:37,090
It'd be in the Ice House on Tuesday.

148
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:37,924
Come on down.

149
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,520
I think he does well because people see
the name and like when they walk into

150
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:43,001
the club,

151
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:43,834
they're like,

152
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,920
that's the weatherman.

153
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,521
You know what I mean?

154
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:49,450
Like it's an instant
recognition kind of Gig.

155
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:49,721
Yeah.

156
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:51,430
But he's got to like keep it super clean,

157
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:51,760
right?

158
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,091
Oh yeah.

159
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:52,361
He's,

160
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,290
he's nice.

161
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,243
Yes.

162
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,980
If you're a weather guy or a news guy.

163
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,431
Oh,

164
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:58,280
and if you just,

165
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,390
just straight slightly outside the lines,

166
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,820
people are looking at take you down,

167
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,110
but they still do it.

168
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,761
That's what's funny.

169
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:06,911
Yeah.

170
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:07,960
You always hear about the,

171
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:12,961
the little small town where the guy that
was in some weird thing like got caught

172
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:15,580
with a prostitute at a massage.

173
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,413
But you know what I mean?

174
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,470
Yeah,

175
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:17,741
I know,

176
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:18,150
but,

177
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,983
but,

178
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,190
but when you know you're that guy,

179
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,571
then you know,

180
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:23,890
you like gave that up,

181
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,641
you know what I mean?

182
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:25,121
Like you,

183
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:25,330
you,

184
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,530
you're not allowed to do that.

185
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,700
You won't get crazy.

186
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,061
You know,

187
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:28,421
you're like,

188
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:29,020
well,

189
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,870
I'm going to be on TV
every day so I can't,

190
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,141
you know,

191
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:33,880
I got to give up the hookers and blow.

192
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,230
Yeah.

193
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,200
You're not in the paid off.

194
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:35,770
Right,

195
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,250
right.

196
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,020
If you're even a comic or a comic,

197
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:38,830
yeah.

198
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,670
We can get busted.

199
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,180
Yeah.

200
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,070
And just you now you have a new bit,

201
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:43,320
like you can't exactly hymns.

202
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,690
Exactly.

203
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,970
I can't think of that.

204
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,780
I don't know what a comic could do.

205
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:51,550
I guess violence would be the only
thing unforgivable for a comic.

206
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:55,050
But when it comes to like
sex scandals or you know,

207
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,570
cheating on your wife or,

208
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,960
or drunk at the airport or whatever,

209
00:04:58,961 --> 00:04:59,860
like for comics,

210
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:00,190
they're like,

211
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:00,491
yeah,

212
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:01,840
well just makes it better.

213
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,913
He's

214
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,760
more,

215
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,910
more material like
looking at Kat Williams,

216
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:07,901
look at Kat Williams,

217
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:11,500
last special half of the special was all
this shit that he got arrested for over

218
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:12,520
the last two years.

219
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:12,890
Yeah.

220
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,350
Yeah.

221
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,600
And,

222
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,433
and,

223
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,281
and that,

224
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:16,001
that's a trip.

225
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:20,530
Like I worked on this
cruise line and they said,

226
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:20,740
yeah,

227
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,491
cat came,

228
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:22,330
but he had a gun.

229
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,611
And you're just like,

230
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:25,090
what?

231
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,220
You brought a gun to a cruise ship?

232
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:27,820
Like what?

233
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,840
What did you expect to
happen on a cruise ship?

234
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,733
You know what I mean?

235
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,570
Like maybe somebody could throw him off.

236
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,700
That's what freaked me
out about a crew shot.

237
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,700
Somebody throwing you off
because that has happened.

238
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:41,980
Like some guy through his
wife off and he's like,

239
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:42,191
oh,

240
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:42,911
I don't know what happened.

241
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:43,410
She was young,

242
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,800
she went out to get a drink and then,

243
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,653
uh,

244
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,390
well,

245
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,931
and they were like,

246
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:47,530
what?

247
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,990
It was like the reaction the guy
had to his wife falling over more,

248
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:52,480
the crocodile tears and they were like,

249
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:53,314
okay dude,

250
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,513
how was he?

251
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,060
This is a question.

252
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:57,070
So how,

253
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,100
how will you,

254
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,521
and Debbie,

255
00:05:58,521 --> 00:05:59,810
how are you guys getting along?

256
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,913
You know,

257
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,910
I guess fight a lot.

258
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,490
I do these charter cruises,

259
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,900
jazz cruises and stuff,

260
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,830
and you know,

261
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:07,790
after the cruise,

262
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,050
the guy who runs it will tell some of
the funny stories of what happened while

263
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:13,670
we were at sea and on one cruise,

264
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:18,671
newlyweds get into a fight the first
night she threw all of his clothes

265
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:19,514
overboard,

266
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,440
everything of his thrown overboard dad
to bring him to the ship's store and he

267
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:24,921
had to wear,

268
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:25,161
you know,

269
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:30,161
they sell like the little shorts and Polo
shirts from the cruise line and he had

270
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:31,850
to wear that all week.

271
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,211
Well,

272
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,010
I hope he stayed with her,

273
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,763
I hope.

274
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:36,800
Yeah.

275
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,720
I don't know how it worked
out in the long run.

276
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,600
The crews little throwing
clothes overboard.

277
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,230
I hope it didn't wreck a
beautiful future relationship.

278
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,820
Beautiful matrimony,

279
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,580
beautiful nuptials in the Lord's eyes.

280
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,460
You had to know that was in her though,

281
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:53,294
right?

282
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,141
You'd never know,

283
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:54,441
man,

284
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:54,591
I've,

285
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:59,180
I've met people that got married and
then immediately afterwards there checked

286
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:00,014
became a nightmare.

287
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,610
Really?

288
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah.

289
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,400
Yeah.

290
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,110
I've heard that more than I've heard.

291
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:04,401
I don't know.

292
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:05,990
I've heard some things but not,

293
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,160
but like to that extent I would think
that'd be flashes of psycho prior to that

294
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:12,830
level.

295
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,191
I don't know.

296
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,710
My Buddy said when his girl got pregnant,

297
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,280
like she was a little irritable
because you know she was pregnant,

298
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:19,611
but he said,

299
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:22,760
but then after the baby
came like the whole,

300
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,340
once she realized that he
was never going to leave,

301
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,020
cause he loves the baby and he loves,

302
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:27,720
he loves that,

303
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:27,980
you know,

304
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,611
having a family.

305
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:30,350
She just started ordering them around,

306
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,513
yelling at him,

307
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,610
barking orders on and telling
him what he can and can't do now.

308
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,391
And he was like,

309
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:37,100
what the fuck happened to you?

310
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,870
Like we're the same people.

311
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,220
We just have a baby now.

312
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,240
But in your mind,

313
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,780
no,

314
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,950
the relationships change.

315
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,580
We're going to have to reorganize
and restructure this deal.

316
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,560
We're going to have to sit down and uh,

317
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,341
this is how it's going to go.

318
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:50,031
Now I'm ready to go.

319
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:54,650
See your mouth is time to renegotiate
and you have no negotiating power in this

320
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:55,484
negotiation.

321
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,530
She kept threatening to take the kid away.

322
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,700
That was her big thing.

323
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,241
Take the kid away.

324
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:00,200
I'm gonna move in with my parents,

325
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:02,240
like all kinds of crazy shit,

326
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:02,530
man.

327
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,140
Yeah.

328
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,040
And just immediately,

329
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:04,460
and he,

330
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,650
he went from being like the happiest guy.

331
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:07,251
I'm sighing.

332
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:08,270
She's perfect.

333
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:09,590
We get along so well.

334
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,940
We're going to have a baby together.

335
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:12,290
There's going to be amazing too.

336
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,250
Fuck Dude.

337
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:14,210
I don't know what to do.

338
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,111
Fuck.

339
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:17,330
Like he was just constantly stressed down.

340
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,400
His eyes were darting
around the room and yeah.

341
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,420
That,

342
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,880
that sounds like the old days
when you had to stay married,

343
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,883
right.

344
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,551
That,

345
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:26,810
that was our parents' generation.

346
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,040
They stayed married.

347
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,150
They hated each other.

348
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,650
I'm not saying specifically,

349
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:31,371
but you know what I mean,

350
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:32,870
like that divorce,

351
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,160
they just didn't do it.

352
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:35,780
They just stayed married.

353
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,380
They would like,

354
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:36,681
yeah,

355
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,630
we've been married for 50 years.

356
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,310
Don't particularly like each other,

357
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,151
but,

358
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:41,390
uh,

359
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,610
we gotta stay married
because we made a vow,

360
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,130
you know?

361
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,760
I mean,

362
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,080
that,

363
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,861
that's how it was.

364
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:47,390
It was a generational pressure.

365
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,910
And now they say the opposite is true.

366
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:51,740
Like you have one bad day.

367
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,101
Yeah.

368
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:52,934
It's enough of this shit.

369
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,470
Well,

370
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,650
it's a religious thing too,

371
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:55,980
right?

372
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,281
You know,

373
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:59,370
like a lot of people don't want to get
like Catholics especially did not want to

374
00:08:59,371 --> 00:08:59,881
get divorced.

375
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:00,650
That was a big thing.

376
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:00,920
Yeah.

377
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,211
Yeah.

378
00:09:01,211 --> 00:09:04,350
It was like the like an unforgivable sin.

379
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,370
Yeah.

380
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:05,521
Yeah.

381
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:07,080
When I was young that was a big deal,

382
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:07,620
man.

383
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,120
Someone talk about but getting divorced,

384
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,350
I remember when I was a little kid,

385
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:13,800
like a lot of it was like they would
start bringing up the church about the

386
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:15,290
church doesn't want you
to getting divorced.

387
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,040
You know in the eyes of
the Lord you're married,

388
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,800
you should work this out and you don't,

389
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,740
part of the problem is
who you are when you meet.

390
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,070
Say If you meet your 25
you know you fall in love,

391
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,800
you get married and you're 30 who you
are at 30 is not who you are at 40 you

392
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,170
will,

393
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,160
you are a different fucking human being
but you have a much better chance then.

394
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,330
Then really young,

395
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:37,440
like I have a niece,

396
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:42,441
she's 26 and she's engaged and I'm
still waiting to see how this plays out

397
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:48,050
because he's 23 and I'm just like too
young like you know it because just think

398
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:54,501
who you are at 23 to who you are at 30
completely different totally though.

399
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,900
So it's like if you grow up together,

400
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,460
that's cool.

401
00:09:59,461 --> 00:09:59,761
And you,

402
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:00,091
you know,

403
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:04,410
you go through those bumps together
but it's too easy to be like a whole

404
00:10:04,411 --> 00:10:05,280
different person.

405
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,290
I mean when I moved out here,

406
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,160
when I came to La I,

407
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,250
I worked uh,

408
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,510
an aircraft so I went to
aviation high school in New York.

409
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,830
Lockheed aircraft discovered this high
school that trains airplane mechanics.

410
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,610
So they literally hired
hundreds of us like move to La,

411
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:21,444
you got a job.

412
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,810
I knew more guys 18 and 19 who married
their girlfriend cause they didn't want

413
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:29,220
to like they will leave at home,

414
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:29,850
you know what I mean?

415
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,810
Like I'm starting life,

416
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:31,740
we're going to get married.

417
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,851
Consequently,

418
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:35,850
I knew more guys who were divorced at 21

419
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,960
I would imagine my
girlfriend in high school,

420
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,420
my my eight when I was 18,

421
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,280
I would have definitely
married her really 100%.

422
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,590
How long you think it would last a week?

423
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,020
A couple of months at the most sheet.

424
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,510
She was a very nice girl,

425
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:52,344
but uh,

426
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:53,910
she moved across town,

427
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,510
uh,

428
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,081
not across town.

429
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:55,741
Across the state,

430
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:57,040
like an hour and a half away and just,

431
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,170
I was so sad.

432
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,523
I couldn't believe it.

433
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,930
God Damn saw the way over there.

434
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,150
If she wanted to get married
and we would be together,

435
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,013
I would have done it.

436
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,090
I will say without exaggeration,

437
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,510
without exaggeration of a hundred guys
I knew married before they were 20.

438
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,290
I only know two.

439
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,124
Still buried.

440
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,550
I only know 200 guys got married.

441
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,930
But they were,

442
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,750
yeah,

443
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,980
guys were coming out and
it was like their fruit.

444
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,520
Like I got a job,

445
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,750
I got an apartment,

446
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,700
let me send from my
girlfriend from New York.

447
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,090
Wow,

448
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:27,930
let's get married.

449
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,160
And they were just doing it.

450
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,640
There were two things that
we did on a regular basis.

451
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,820
Go to weddings and bail guys out of
jail cause everybody was getting Duis,

452
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:38,251
you know,

453
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:38,911
so it's like,

454
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:39,320
we were like,

455
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,571
all right,

456
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:43,230
let's just keep a Dui Fund for
whoever gets picked up this week.

457
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,100
You guys end up fund.

458
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,510
We practically did.

459
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:45,711
We,

460
00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:48,510
we had a network where we call like,

461
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:48,691
yeah,

462
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:49,650
so and so's in jail.

463
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,041
All right,

464
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:50,791
I got 50 bucks.

465
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:50,981
All right,

466
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:51,760
I got 100 bucks,

467
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,090
whatever.

468
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,040
And we get good amount.

469
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,201
Yeah.

470
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:53,980
How much does it cost to get

471
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,780
you out of jail for a Dui back then?

472
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,291
Let's see.

473
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,340
That was early eighties.

474
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,530
Probably about four or 500 bucks.

475
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,310
And it wasn't,

476
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,971
it wasn't,

477
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:01,181
yeah.

478
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:03,460
Back then it wasn't yet the big crime.

479
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:05,950
It is now like back in around,

480
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,881
this is 80,

481
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:07,391
81,

482
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:11,080
82 getting a DUI was
like a really bad ticket,

483
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,221
but they didn't,

484
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:12,521
you know,

485
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:14,080
you went to jail for one night,

486
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:16,420
but it wasn't like it is now where you,

487
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,313
you know,

488
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,400
now it's,

489
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,280
it's uh,

490
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,140
it was a matter of fact,

491
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:23,980
I taught comedy traffic school
and what the late nineties,

492
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,750
and they said a Dui then costs you
10,000 bucks by the time you paid for the

493
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:31,960
fine and drunk driving school
and a lawyer and all of that,

494
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,970
it's gotta be a lot more than that now.

495
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,280
It's probably 10 to 15 pedals,

496
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:37,920
a big crime now crime.

497
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,760
When I was in high school,

498
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:41,260
a kid I went to school with,

499
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,453
Nice Kid,

500
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,740
uh,

501
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,890
gotten a drunk driving accident,

502
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:45,724
killed his friend.

503
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,140
Never forget that.

504
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:47,860
That's,

505
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,510
I think that's the worst part.

506
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,081
If you,

507
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:53,380
if you have that because
you gotta live with that.

508
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,040
Yeah.

509
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,731
You know what I mean?

510
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:59,110
And I can't imagine it's bad
enough if you have an accident,

511
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,770
but if you're drunk and
you have an accident or you
kill your friend in the car

512
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:03,730
or some shit like that,

513
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,380
having to live with that,

514
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:06,214
it's gotta be the worst.

515
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,461
Yeah.

516
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:07,294
And he was like,

517
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,810
I don't think we're any older
than 17 or 18 at the time.

518
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:12,910
I think he was just learning
how to drive really.

519
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:13,841
And,

520
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:14,674
um,

521
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,120
I heard about it,

522
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,020
heard the whole story and I knew that
he had tried to commit suicide in the

523
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:20,411
hospital.

524
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:21,610
He tried to jump out the window.

525
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,690
The cops told him they came up to him
while he's in the hospital bed and said,

526
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,500
you know,

527
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,490
you're a murderer now.

528
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,121
And he's like,

529
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:28,570
what?

530
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:28,901
He's like,

531
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:29,740
your friend's dead.

532
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,880
You're a murderer now.

533
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,360
Yeah.

534
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,751
And he's like,

535
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:32,584
what,

536
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:32,921
what?

537
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:36,460
And he just freaked out and he just ran
towards the window and they grabbed him

538
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,230
and I was walking down the
street in my neighborhood and,

539
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:41,470
uh,

540
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,340
he was walking towards me and I saw
him and he saw me and we looked at each

541
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:46,600
other and I said,

542
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:47,434
how you doing man?

543
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:47,891
I said,

544
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:48,724
hi,

545
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,210
I'm just,

546
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:49,450
I'm,

547
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,370
I'll never forget the sadness.

548
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,850
The sadness was oozing out of his body.

549
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,081
Good.

550
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:57,170
They had this bastard,

551
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,640
they had this commercial and it was
like the last text of people who died

552
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:03,994
texting.

553
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,650
Did you ever see that one?

554
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:06,191
No,

555
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:07,024
but there was a guy,

556
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,763
I think he was

557
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,960
publicists to a Paris Hilton
or something like that.

558
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:14,981
Like one of those,

559
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:15,230
like,

560
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,210
I think it was Paris.

561
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:20,260
Hilton's publicist drove off
the fucking mountain in Malibu.

562
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,010
You know that that was a crazy
winding roads and he was a,

563
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,120
he made a text about his dog,

564
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:25,331
like,

565
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:25,961
lol,

566
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:26,890
she's so cute.

567
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,540
I like the dog was in the car with him

568
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,950
fucking off that for,

569
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:33,490
I forget the specific to the case,

570
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:36,880
but they found the dude at the bottom of
the canyon and then they deduced like,

571
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,061
oh,

572
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:40,480
this dumb fuck was was
texting one single passenger.

573
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:42,700
I mean a dog by himself,

574
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,470
not an accident and didn't
collide with anything.

575
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,890
Just went off the side of off the,

576
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,271
yeah.

577
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,010
Well I,

578
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,533
it's,

579
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,463
I dunno,

580
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,691
they'll never have them.

581
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:52,070
You'll never

582
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,270
had me on the podcast again.

583
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:53,841
People like this.

584
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:56,460
The sad as shit I've
ever heard a lot sadder.

585
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,550
We're 10 minutes in and everyone's dying.

586
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,460
Well,

587
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,120
you don't think when you're
driving and you're drunk,

588
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:02,954
especially,

589
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,580
you don't think it's
going to happen to you.

590
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,270
That's,

591
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,030
that's the real [inaudible].

592
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,840
Everyone thinks it's,

593
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,140
everyone thinks that
someone else I can drive.

594
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,363
I'm okay.

595
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:10,521
Well,

596
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:12,020
that's what alcohol does to you though.

597
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,600
Alcohol has you convinced that
everything's going to be fine.

598
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:14,871
Yeah.

599
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:18,050
You hold all of your
perceptions off so you think it.

600
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,440
Yeah,

601
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,100
I'm all right.

602
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,990
Which is like the exact opposite of pot.

603
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,071
When you smoke pot,

604
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:22,281
you're like,

605
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:23,250
I can't fucking drive,

606
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:23,980
dude.

607
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,240
There's no way I can drive like drive.

608
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:26,960
When you're high,

609
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,150
everything works like
you can hit the brakes.

610
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,440
You can make turns,

611
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,440
but you're convinced that
there's no fucking way you're
going to be able to make

612
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:34,274
this exit.

613
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,570
The exit's over there.

614
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:36,500
I got to get over there.

615
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:37,334
Fuck.

616
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,710
I remember one of the first times
I ever drove when I was high.

617
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,390
I just couldn't believe I was driving.

618
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:41,661
I was like,

619
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:42,740
this is so bad.

620
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,574
This is so bad.

621
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,270
Meanwhile,

622
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,250
I was going 55 miles an hour,

623
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,920
staying in the lane was
very aware of everything.

624
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:49,431
Looking left,

625
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:49,941
looking right,

626
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:50,840
looking in the rear view mirror.

627
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,120
But if I was drunk I'd been like,

628
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,030
I got this guy wouldn't,

629
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,420
when I used to get loaded,

630
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,890
I could drive high.

631
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,490
I never liked to be a drunk cause
I always felt out of control.

632
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,451
You know,

633
00:16:02,451 --> 00:16:03,000
just let,

634
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,200
not like crazy out of control
but sloppy out of control.

635
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,350
He wants terrible drug.

636
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,303
Yeah.

637
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,420
So especially the next morning when you
wake up sober in jail or you realize

638
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:17,804
what you did,

639
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,820
that's when it hits.

640
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,080
Have yet DUI before.

641
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,770
No,

642
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,160
Nah.

643
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,890
Knock Wood.

644
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,350
Got Arrested for possession once.

645
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,220
That's when I got sober.

646
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:30,430
Really got arrested for possession of
cocaine to dude who spent a night in jail

647
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:31,651
and a,

648
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:35,600
and I'm going to tell you the
happiest moment in court is when,

649
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:40,340
when you show up for your possession of
cocaine and as a public defender and I'm

650
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:40,881
sweating,

651
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:41,780
like I don't know,

652
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:43,490
like what's going to happen or,

653
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,120
or this or that because it
was crack that you know,

654
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:46,671
I had.

655
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:47,504
So I'm like,

656
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,040
and he's like,

657
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:49,971
you okay?

658
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:50,330
I'm like,

659
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:50,511
Eh.

660
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:51,260
He said,

661
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,400
did anyone tell you no?

662
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,180
He said,

663
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,421
oh,

664
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:53,991
whatever you had,

665
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:54,771
it wasn't cocaine.

666
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:57,200
So you're just here on driving
on a suspended license.

667
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:57,531
I was like,

668
00:16:57,531 --> 00:16:58,364
guilty.

669
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,590
Guilty.

670
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,150
What?

671
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,400
Suspended license out.

672
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,190
Someone's telling you some bullshit crack.

673
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,443
Thank God.

674
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,121
Wow.

675
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:08,954
What was it?

676
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,470
Uh,

677
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,130
who knows?

678
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,450
I don't know what it was.

679
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:12,290
Whatever it was.

680
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:13,190
When they tested it,

681
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:14,360
it was not cocaine.

682
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,560
I'll tell you what it was.

683
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:16,910
It was the greatest day of my life.

684
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,090
He,

685
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:24,020
Joey Diaz would tell stories about
giving girls chopped up aspirins and them

686
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:26,600
acting like it's the greatest coke
they've ever done in their life.

687
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,080
Yeah.

688
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,351
Yeah.

689
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:27,801
People,

690
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:28,041
well,

691
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,130
so much of it is like
psychological but with,

692
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:32,000
but with crack,

693
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,410
I mean when it hits you,

694
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:34,190
you know it,

695
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:34,880
but this one,

696
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,840
I listen,

697
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:36,110
Joe,

698
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,831
I got busted.

699
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:39,230
It was the dumbest thing.

700
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:39,471
Like,

701
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:39,650
uh,

702
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,210
I was on this street,

703
00:17:41,211 --> 00:17:41,660
you know,

704
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,381
crack road,

705
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:42,910
whatever you,

706
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,731
you go to cop.

707
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,564
Right.

708
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,800
So I had the rock and I knew to rock
because I had tried to smoke it and it

709
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:49,291
melted.

710
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:49,660
And I was like,

711
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,401
does it bullshit?

712
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:51,234
So I go back,

713
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,890
like I'm looking for the guy,

714
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:53,370
right?

715
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,330
Like what am I going to do?

716
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:55,081
I ain't gonna do shit.

717
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:56,010
Like I'm not hard.

718
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,701
You know what I mean?

719
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,534
I'm not a Crip,

720
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:02,250
I'm just going back looking for the guy
and the cop swooped on the street and

721
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:05,400
they come in from both sides with cars,

722
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:06,000
you know,

723
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,100
like it's a whole thing to
shut down the whole street.

724
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,530
So I throw the rock out of the window.

725
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,930
It hits the gutter above the
window and lands in my lap.

726
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,793
When the cop,

727
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,830
I had a rock my lap,

728
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,770
it's like I tried to get rid of,

729
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,890
you know how you think a cut like a rock.

730
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,720
If your windows open a rock,

731
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:29,040
you can just flick it like a bugger.

732
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,180
That's what I thought.

733
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,710
He tried to throw it out
the side window passenger.

734
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,160
No,

735
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,480
no.

736
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,200
Drivers bounced off.

737
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:41,240
Literally hit that gutter or you know
that little rail above the window and

738
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:41,971
bounced right.

739
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:44,100
Landed right in my lap to daddy's shit.

740
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:45,180
Luck man.

741
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,330
Great lucky.

742
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,730
Great luck in the long run.

743
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:48,600
But in the moment,

744
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,830
not good.

745
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,663
Wow.

746
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,790
So Dan was the moment you
decided to quit when I,

747
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:54,121
yeah,

748
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:55,410
that night in jail.

749
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:59,520
It was one of those things where like
it's one of those moments where you

750
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:01,350
realize I'm not supposed to be here.

751
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,031
You know what I mean?

752
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:03,390
Like,

753
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,510
like with everything that
had transpired in my life,

754
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:08,180
like I was still in aerospace then,

755
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,023
but you know,

756
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,980
licensed airplane mechanic,

757
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:11,790
good job,

758
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,001
blah,

759
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:12,121
blah,

760
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:12,390
blah,

761
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,230
everything else.

762
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,940
It just hit me in that moment.

763
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:18,570
Like this is not how it's supposed to
end because I knew guys who had gone down

764
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:19,110
that road,

765
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,650
you know what I mean?

766
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,290
Like I knew guys who were
doing time and shit like that.

767
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,040
And,

768
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,540
and for a lot of guys,

769
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,180
jail is just part of life.

770
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:27,871
You know what I mean?

771
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,790
Like I go away for a couple of years,

772
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:30,211
come back,

773
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:31,380
like I'm not that guy.

774
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,101
You know what I mean?

775
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:33,420
And I didn't want to,

776
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,550
I didn't want to become that guy.

777
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:40,551
I had no aspiration when I was a
kid that one of the neighbors' sons,

778
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,690
he was in Attica,

779
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,610
and I will never forget this.

780
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:48,900
We were going somewhere upstate
New York and we went to visit him.

781
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,650
And when you go in and that
gate closest behind you,

782
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:55,320
like I don't know if you've ever
been in a maximum security prison,

783
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,240
but when that gate,

784
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,113
it's

785
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,580
toluene never forgot that sound
for the rest of my was like,

786
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,480
oh fuck no.

787
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,370
They say whatever I do,

788
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,050
this ain't where I'm going to end up.

789
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,630
Where did he go to Attica for a robbery.

790
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,493
Armed robbery.

791
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,461
Yeah.

792
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,720
He was in the armed robbery.

793
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,491
He was a,

794
00:20:13,491 --> 00:20:14,700
he was a habitual criminal.

795
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,050
He'd spent the rest of his life.

796
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,680
He was never out of jail
for more than a year.

797
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,560
Because once you get in that system,

798
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,780
then you're always getting
picked up for something.

799
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,380
So,

800
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,320
and the people that you know and the
people that you surround yourself with,

801
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,230
it becomes a pattern that
you're constantly around.

802
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,700
People that are doing things like that.

803
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:33,630
It becomes normal.

804
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,110
That's it.

805
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,321
Yeah.

806
00:20:34,321 --> 00:20:34,981
That's what it is.

807
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:35,970
It becomes normal.

808
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,270
And,

809
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,800
and once it becomes normal,

810
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:38,001
it's,

811
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:39,090
it's tough to crack.

812
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:41,490
So how old were you when
you first tried crack?

813
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,420
Uh,

814
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,140
let's see.

815
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:48,140
Speaking of tough to crack 22,

816
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,140
maybe 23,

817
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:50,860
something like that.

818
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,910
And what was the scenario?

819
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,320
Uh,

820
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,900
well actually the first time I tried,

821
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,181
okay.

822
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:56,014
It started out,

823
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:56,951
you know,

824
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:59,230
like just party and as a kid smoking weed,

825
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,050
uh,

826
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,740
drink a beer,

827
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,151
whatever,

828
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:03,280
and then get into a little cocaine

829
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,783
here and there,

830
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,600
you know,

831
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,170
um,

832
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,003
snorting it.

833
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,580
And then I had a friend and
this had to be [inaudible] 84,

834
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:16,690
maybe 83,

835
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:17,380
whatever,

836
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,400
when people were still just
starting to get into freebase and,

837
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,790
and crack and stuff like that.

838
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,420
And he hit it and he gave me the
pipe and I hit it and I was like,

839
00:21:25,421 --> 00:21:26,260
Holy Shit.

840
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:26,770
And I was like,

841
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,431
it scared me.

842
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:27,731
I was like,

843
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:28,564
this is too good.

844
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,291
Like I said,

845
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:29,561
man,

846
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:30,394
you better.

847
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,930
You better get off this shit.

848
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:34,270
This is gonna like you're
gonna lose everything.

849
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:34,960
Wow.

850
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,850
Cause the high was so good,

851
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,361
you know?

852
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:38,350
And what does it feel like?

853
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:39,040
Describe it?

854
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,873
Uh,

855
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,070
it's a rush.

856
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,360
It's an overpowering rush
of energy and I don't,

857
00:21:49,821 --> 00:21:50,381
I don't know,

858
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:53,740
like a lightning bolt
hitting you with no pain but,

859
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:54,574
but just like,

860
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,330
like you're,

861
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,081
you're buzzing.

862
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,430
Like your whole body is just,

863
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,150
you know,

864
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,970
I guess cocaine works on whatever the,

865
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:01,804
um,

866
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,070
the receptors of good feelings and your,

867
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,790
I forget what it's
called me scientifically,

868
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:07,361
it's dopamine,

869
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:11,740
but they're also like nerve during nerve
endings that make you feel good and

870
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:13,570
cocaine works on these and,

871
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,140
and crack is such,

872
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,880
such an intense hit.

873
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,050
It's like doing it all at once and as
opposed to when you're snorting it,

874
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:24,910
you're getting high a
little here a little bit.

875
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,490
Now it's concentrated and it's a,

876
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:28,720
it's a rush but it,

877
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,400
but it's beyond anything else.

878
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:30,730
It is,

879
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:32,800
it is instantly addicting.

880
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,140
It is because it's a rush that you've
never felt before any or whatnot.

881
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,660
I've never shot up so I can't
compare it to shooting drugs.

882
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,260
But it,

883
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,820
I had never felt anything like
that and it literally scared me.

884
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:51,220
And then like a year and a half later
is when I got into doing it myself,

885
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:51,551
you know,

886
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:52,510
with some other guys.

887
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:54,430
And it was like me and this other guy,

888
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,460
we kind of said we're
going to watch each other.

889
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,181
You know what I mean?

890
00:22:58,181 --> 00:22:59,014
So it's like,

891
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,710
like he'll tell me when to stop
or I'll tell him when the state,

892
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:06,940
and it actually worked for as long
as we were both in the same room,

893
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,170
you know?

894
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,330
But then so you decided to be
like sitters for each other?

895
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:10,631
Yeah.

896
00:23:10,631 --> 00:23:10,931
Yeah.

897
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,400
With cause you knew because you,

898
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,660
cause we'd seen people,

899
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:16,360
we've seen people get
sprung and lose everything.

900
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,380
The first guy who,

901
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:19,120
who turned me on to it,

902
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,740
I watched him lose,

903
00:23:20,741 --> 00:23:23,170
he had this incredibly
beautiful girlfriend.

904
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,310
She dumped him.

905
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:26,920
Then he lost his card and
he lost his apartment.

906
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:28,690
Like it literally crack.

907
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:29,051
We'll take,

908
00:23:29,051 --> 00:23:29,590
you know,

909
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,190
I mean,

910
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,900
Richard Pryor's jokes like that shit is
true to pipe would tell you that ain't

911
00:23:34,901 --> 00:23:35,480
shit.

912
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,313
You and me,

913
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,480
it's you and me.

914
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:37,961
You Ain't,

915
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:39,100
you don't need this bitch.

916
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,780
You don't need that fucking car.

917
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,441
You don't need,

918
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:41,801
you know,

919
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:42,001
I,

920
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:43,300
I sold a crack car,

921
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:45,560
I sold a car I had for five bucks,

922
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,330
you know,

923
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:46,540
to,

924
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,840
to smoke that up.

925
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,390
How often were you smoking at the end?

926
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:50,840
I was,

927
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,690
I was daily.

928
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,420
As much as often as I
could get the money daily.

929
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:56,900
Yeah.

930
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,171
As,

931
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:58,250
as often as I could get.

932
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,710
I still had a job almost to the end,

933
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:01,851
you know what I mean?

934
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:03,500
And I got laid off from my job,

935
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:05,570
so when I got my paycheck,

936
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,000
that's when it would start and it,

937
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,420
and it was always the same bullshit.

938
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:08,990
Like,

939
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,321
all right,

940
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:11,180
I'm only going to do like one eight ball.

941
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:11,490
I mean,

942
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,323
that's like,

943
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,420
it's been 150 bucks that's going to be it,

944
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:14,751
you know?

945
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:16,820
So you get that and
then you smoke that up,

946
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:17,061
you're like,

947
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:17,331
all right,

948
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,150
I'm on gone 20 more like
I'm only gonna do 20 more.

949
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,260
I'm only gonna do 20 more.

950
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:21,710
And then you,

951
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,200
you do that and then next thing you know,

952
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:24,561
it's all,

953
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:28,460
it's the next day and it's
all gone and the money's gone.

954
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:28,790
And,

955
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,220
and I was,

956
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,141
like I said,

957
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:34,070
I'm not a criminal.

958
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,420
Like I didn't come from that.

959
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,800
That's where my head was.

960
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:37,070
My,

961
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,480
my next stop was,

962
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,321
okay,

963
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:42,380
how do I steal something or
rip somebody off or whatever.

964
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,390
Wow.

965
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,893
And um,

966
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,531
yeah,

967
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:46,350
it's totally,

968
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:46,551
I'm,

969
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:46,851
but,

970
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:50,390
but the bad thing is once
you get to that point,

971
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,580
you're not getting high anymore because
your brain's so fried that the drug's

972
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:56,181
not working,

973
00:24:56,181 --> 00:24:57,060
like whatever the,

974
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,860
the nerves and need the brain
cells and stuff are fried.

975
00:25:00,861 --> 00:25:01,880
So you're smoking it,

976
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:03,350
but you're not getting that,

977
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,940
that rush anymore.

978
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:05,691
You're chasing it,

979
00:25:05,691 --> 00:25:06,320
you want it,

980
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,340
but you can't find it.

981
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,110
So the initial rush that you get,

982
00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:10,070
the first time you do it,

983
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,180
it's just overwhelming.

984
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,210
And then everything else has to
diminish his more and more never,

985
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:14,961
you know,

986
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:15,261
like,

987
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:16,310
like shot a song.

988
00:25:16,311 --> 00:25:18,680
It's never as good as the first time that,

989
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,310
that,

990
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:19,960
that's what,

991
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,710
and that's the whole
thing with drug addiction.

992
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,970
With any drug.

993
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:28,130
It's so good that first time that you're
chasing it and you can't get that feel.

994
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:28,850
And again,

995
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,240
I think that's the difference
between addicts and regular people.

996
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,590
Like regular people.

997
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:35,630
Like you get high and you're like,

998
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,080
okay,

999
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,913
I'm good.

1000
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,340
You know,

1001
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,020
I'm a high,

1002
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,690
um,

1003
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,140
I'm in jail.

1004
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,050
I'm having a good time,

1005
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:40,641
but it said that,

1006
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:41,180
but,

1007
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,750
but when you're an addict it's like you
want that ultimate feeling that you got

1008
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,610
that one time and you will,

1009
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,650
you'll sacrifice everything to get it.

1010
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:49,481
Yeah.

1011
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,020
I've never fucked with coke.

1012
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,830
I don't know.

1013
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:56,830
I don't know what that feeling is
it coke in general is an up drug.

1014
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:01,610
It ups your energy and a
heightened sense of awareness.

1015
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:03,380
That's why like you get coke,

1016
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:04,041
paranoia.

1017
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,620
Like I had coke bugs one time cook bugs,

1018
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:06,961
coke,

1019
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:07,794
the crawling on you.

1020
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,020
It feels like something's crawling
in your skin and you're scratching.

1021
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,940
But people have cut themselves open.

1022
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,420
Oh,

1023
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,111
you know what I mean?

1024
00:26:15,111 --> 00:26:15,600
Could but,

1025
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,880
but I'll never forget that.

1026
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:21,110
That was the weirdest thing cause it
literally felt like there were bugs

1027
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:22,910
crawling out of my skin and I'm just like,

1028
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,300
ah.

1029
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,780
You know,

1030
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,613
and um,

1031
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,850
but it does that like,

1032
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,470
cause it affects your nervous system.

1033
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,000
And this is the extreme.

1034
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:29,834
This is beat.

1035
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,950
This isn't the,

1036
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,551
you know,

1037
00:26:31,551 --> 00:26:35,750
snort coke would a chick
in the bathroom of a club.

1038
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,381
You know,

1039
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:37,670
that this is beyond that.

1040
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,750
You know,

1041
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,220
this is beyond the fun part.

1042
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,740
Did the snorting grab you as much
as the smoking or was smoking it?

1043
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:44,490
We're really good.

1044
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,470
A snorting was,

1045
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:46,590
the snorting was good,

1046
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:48,780
but snorting is also hard on you.

1047
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:50,460
Like your nose gets fucked up.

1048
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:50,851
And you know,

1049
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:51,061
in the,

1050
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:56,061
in the 80s there were a lot of deviated
septums and there were a lot of plastic

1051
00:26:56,341 --> 00:26:59,130
surgeons putting noses
back together in the 80s.

1052
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,450
But what eats through your nose?

1053
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:00,891
Is that true?

1054
00:27:00,891 --> 00:27:01,900
It literally each three.

1055
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,300
If that was true,

1056
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:03,751
yeah,

1057
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:07,470
that's center membrane
goes away and you know,

1058
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:10,560
it just becomes one big nostril
and probably better for cardio.

1059
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,120
Yeah.

1060
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,820
What day you go,

1061
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,031
oh,

1062
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:12,930
I used to work out,

1063
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:13,021
man,

1064
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:15,840
I used to get coked up and
work out at a 24 hour gym.

1065
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,943
Eh,

1066
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,940
if I wasn't in shape,

1067
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:20,270
my heart would have
exploded with somebody.

1068
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,240
Shit I used to do.

1069
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:25,320
But you do it for the rush cause you're
coked up and then you start lifting and

1070
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:25,891
you know how it is.

1071
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:29,760
You get that pump and now you're like
that and you just feel like you can

1072
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:31,710
fucking explode,

1073
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:31,951
you know.

1074
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:32,101
And,

1075
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:32,260
um,

1076
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:32,550
my,

1077
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,870
I'm sure my heart was doing
150 beats a minute late.

1078
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,550
You were coked up lifting weights.

1079
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,350
Oh yeah,

1080
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,780
yeah.

1081
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,140
That,

1082
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,830
and that was one of the reasons I think
that I was able to hide it because I

1083
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:46,810
didn't look like a crackhead cause
I didn't lose weight cause I,

1084
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:47,250
I,

1085
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,960
I got coked up and worked out.

1086
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,483
So

1087
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,180
I ate when I wasn't on it.

1088
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,740
I didn't eat when I was on it,

1089
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:57,510
but I ate when I wasn't on it.

1090
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:57,991
So,

1091
00:27:57,991 --> 00:27:58,290
uh,

1092
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,220
you were doing it every day?

1093
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah.

1094
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,390
Yeah.

1095
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,011
But well,

1096
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:01,844
every day is,

1097
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,970
as long as I had the money,

1098
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,080
the money would run out.

1099
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:05,760
So if I got paid Thursday,

1100
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,830
every day lasted til Saturday,

1101
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:08,880
maybe Sunday.

1102
00:28:08,881 --> 00:28:11,340
And then you just get a little
chip here in that little piece,

1103
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:13,560
but nothing to keep your high all day.

1104
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:14,560
So I mean I,

1105
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,240
I did,

1106
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,650
I did a lot to hide it.

1107
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,170
You know,

1108
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,570
I led this dual life.

1109
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:22,560
Like I worked during the day and I was
the airplane mechanic and then when I got

1110
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:23,071
off work,

1111
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:26,670
I just lock myself up
in my apartment coke.

1112
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,410
I lived like that for

1113
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,040
my life was fully like that
for a little over a year.

1114
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:35,761
But the,

1115
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:36,930
but the worst part,

1116
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,970
the last two years was when it,

1117
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,833
when it was bad,

1118
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,363
it was bad.

1119
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,180
So you went crazy for a
year or you just dude,

1120
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:48,870
what you drink and just try to calm your
heart to know you drink because first

1121
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:49,351
of all you,

1122
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:50,820
your torch was um,

1123
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,210
a little cotton ball
dipped into one 51 rum.

1124
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,480
Oh,

1125
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,100
so you had one 51 there.

1126
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,140
So you would drink that cause
you have it and you drink torch.

1127
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:01,860
Yeah.

1128
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,290
And then other words like you didn't,

1129
00:29:03,291 --> 00:29:04,860
you don't cook crack with a lighter,

1130
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,220
you know,

1131
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,500
I hate giving crack lessons.

1132
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,680
Please do on the podcast.

1133
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:08,650
But no,

1134
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,340
you don't hope you don't hold the lighter.

1135
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,101
You need a torch.

1136
00:29:11,101 --> 00:29:12,420
You needed like a hotter flame.

1137
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:13,380
So you would take,

1138
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,970
and I'm trying to remember

1139
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,400
how we did it.

1140
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:18,180
Um,

1141
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:22,260
I'm trying to remember what you dipped
into the rum and it's great that I don't

1142
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:22,591
remember.

1143
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:23,790
Cause I remember the screen.

1144
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,710
Was this a chore boy,

1145
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,680
which was like a steel
wool but no soap in it.

1146
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,170
That's what you used as
a screen in the pipe.

1147
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,783
But that,

1148
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,590
I forget how I did the torch,

1149
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:35,071
but anyway,

1150
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:40,071
the torch you would dip it into one 51
rum and light that because that was a

1151
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:42,370
hotter than using a lighter.

1152
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,430
Whoa.

1153
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,543
But

1154
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:45,910
yeah,

1155
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,080
they came out with those,

1156
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:48,880
they came out with a torch lighters later.

1157
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,960
But like you knew certain crackhead things
and you would like when you were at a

1158
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:54,640
crackhead liquor store,

1159
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,411
you know what I mean?

1160
00:29:55,411 --> 00:29:55,690
They,

1161
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:58,510
you could tell by stuff they sold.

1162
00:29:58,511 --> 00:30:03,190
Like they would just have shore boy scrub
brushes and they would have like one

1163
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:04,090
51 rum,

1164
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:04,720
but like in,

1165
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,890
in half pints,

1166
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:06,431
you know,

1167
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:09,340
know who's buying a half pint out
at one 51 you know what I mean?

1168
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,174
And uh,

1169
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,830
you get bic lighters,

1170
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:16,150
you get that pack of five cause you'd
go through lighters all the time.

1171
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,140
So you just,

1172
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,950
you,

1173
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,520
but that was,

1174
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,300
that was it.

1175
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,081
That was the life.

1176
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:20,980
But it was the,

1177
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:22,510
it was the initial rush man.

1178
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:23,530
The rush was like,

1179
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:25,420
and once you hit it,

1180
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,530
once you hit that,

1181
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,690
then nothing else mattered.

1182
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,681
You know what I mean?

1183
00:30:29,681 --> 00:30:30,041
Like in,

1184
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:30,970
in other words,

1185
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,250
once you got that first hit,

1186
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,290
then you didn't care about and that's,

1187
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,320
that's why you hear about those
stories about people you know,

1188
00:30:38,321 --> 00:30:40,090
leaving the tragic stuff,

1189
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:43,810
leaving their kid in the car while they
are in the crack house or you know,

1190
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:47,650
the guy who never comes home or
whatever because you are out of your,

1191
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:48,110
mind.

1192
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,790
You,

1193
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,531
it took over.

1194
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:49,800
There were,

1195
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,800
there wasn't very rarely did you come
across a social crack user crack dominated

1196
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,763
life.

1197
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,100
Uh,

1198
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:57,550
what,

1199
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,420
what you saw,

1200
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:01,810
what you saw happened to
Chris Rock and new Jack City.

1201
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,740
That was it.

1202
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,573
That was real.

1203
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,470
And that's how it was done.

1204
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,730
That's how it would take you over.

1205
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,640
It's amazing that you kicked
it just from one arrest.

1206
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:10,871
Well,

1207
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:11,050
uh,

1208
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,530
again,

1209
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,640
that one arrest.

1210
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:13,060
What?

1211
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,301
Well,

1212
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:15,670
you got to remember your hate
yourself while you're doing it.

1213
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,410
You're not enjoying it.

1214
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:17,831
You know,

1215
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:18,041
you're,

1216
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:18,431
you're,

1217
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:21,160
you're in a place cause
you know you're fucking up.

1218
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,121
You know,

1219
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:22,451
I'm a,

1220
00:31:22,451 --> 00:31:22,781
I mean,

1221
00:31:22,781 --> 00:31:23,980
like in my case,

1222
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,653
I'm not going,

1223
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,290
uh,

1224
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,180
my family's in New York where I grew up.

1225
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,120
I'm not going home to visit anybody.

1226
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:32,800
I'm not going home on any holidays.

1227
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,071
I,

1228
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:33,904
uh,

1229
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,250
my last Thanksgiving now,

1230
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:36,610
I mean,

1231
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,020
I'm invited to at least two,

1232
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,730
three friends and families,

1233
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,001
you know,

1234
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:41,320
come over for Thanksgiving dinner,

1235
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:42,154
this or that.

1236
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,181
It's me,

1237
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:44,250
the pipe and,

1238
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,530
and identities take out
Thanksgiving dinner,

1239
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,371
you know what I mean?

1240
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:51,610
And you're sitting there and you
know that that's what fucks with you,

1241
00:31:51,611 --> 00:31:52,510
you know,

1242
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,381
and you're like,

1243
00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:53,591
well,

1244
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:55,360
one more hit and then I'm to go to,

1245
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,050
you know,

1246
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:56,980
so and so's house,

1247
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,350
I'm going to make it out the
house today and you don't,

1248
00:31:59,351 --> 00:31:59,581
and,

1249
00:31:59,581 --> 00:32:00,190
and then,

1250
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,070
and this is every week
and it's in your mind.

1251
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,281
Like,

1252
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:04,360
I just did it again.

1253
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,220
I didn't show up for this.

1254
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:07,210
I didn't show up for that.

1255
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:08,110
I'm missing work,

1256
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,183
whatever.

1257
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:09,971
I'm not,

1258
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:11,410
pay bills aren't paid.

1259
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:11,621
You know,

1260
00:32:11,621 --> 00:32:13,510
I went through bankruptcy the whole bit.

1261
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,100
And so,

1262
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:16,000
you know,

1263
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,950
you're destroying your life.

1264
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,260
And so the arrest was just like the,

1265
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:21,820
the,

1266
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,110
when it all came to a head,

1267
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,651
you know what I mean?

1268
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:28,651
Cause it now I'm just in jail by myself
sitting in Van Nuys jail with nothing

1269
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:29,711
but nothing.

1270
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:31,890
But my thoughts of this is how,

1271
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,793
this is what I did.

1272
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:33,521
Yeah.

1273
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:35,200
They say that you need a rock bottom,

1274
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:36,034
right?

1275
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,371
Yeah.

1276
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,300
It's different for,

1277
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:38,560
it's different for everybody,

1278
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,950
but you that bottom.

1279
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,500
And the only thing I remembered after
that when I went to rehab was I never want

1280
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:47,450
to feel like that again.

1281
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,321
You know,

1282
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:48,921
like whatever,

1283
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:50,540
whatever happens in my life,

1284
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,060
I don't want to feel like that again.

1285
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,793
Wow.

1286
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,260
So bad timing on the Rehab.

1287
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,230
That's a good rock bottom though
to good rock bottom story too.

1288
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,610
It's a real rock bottom.

1289
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:03,020
But when it comes to rehab,

1290
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,600
if I had walked out of
the house on last comic,

1291
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:07,850
standing into celebrity Rehab,

1292
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,770
how fucking famous would I be now?

1293
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:10,100
Joe?

1294
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,671
Pretty famous.

1295
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah,

1296
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,833
I blew it.

1297
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,340
He timed it more timing.

1298
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,820
When did you start doing stand up?

1299
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,220
Well,

1300
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,420
that's the funny thing.

1301
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:21,440
And it's literally one of those cases
where the worst thing in your life leads

1302
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:22,550
to the best thing in your life.

1303
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,400
So I go to Rehab.

1304
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,270
Um,

1305
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,190
and when you're in re I was in outpatient,

1306
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:32,810
so you're in these meetings and
there's psychologists and whatever.

1307
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:33,620
And so it was,

1308
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,000
this was in court appointed.

1309
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:36,170
This was like your own decision?

1310
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:36,681
My thing.

1311
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:36,980
Yeah.

1312
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,200
Cause I had gone when I had my job,

1313
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:41,900
I had tried rehab once
and I didn't make it,

1314
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:42,890
cause I didn't give a shit,

1315
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,191
you know,

1316
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:46,310
so I went back to the same
place and they let me back in.

1317
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:50,870
So four hours a day you're doing the
psychology thing and the meetings and

1318
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,853
whatever else.

1319
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,460
And this woman came in and she,

1320
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,490
she was from the people who are in
recovery go to rehabs and they tell people

1321
00:34:00,501 --> 00:34:01,760
like this is how it works,

1322
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:02,750
this is what it's like,

1323
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,613
blah blah blah.

1324
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:08,000
So she was hot as all I
remember is she was hot as hell,

1325
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:08,511
you know,

1326
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:09,800
and she was from New York.

1327
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:10,101
Right.

1328
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:10,670
So,

1329
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,990
so after she talks,

1330
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:12,920
I make my move,

1331
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:13,191
you know,

1332
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:15,140
cause I'm sober like three fucking days.

1333
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:15,530
Right.

1334
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,363
So,

1335
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,481
but she said,

1336
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:17,841
listen,

1337
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:20,990
I'm married but there are a lot of women
like me to go to a place called studio

1338
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:24,980
12 and studio 12 was a rehab for the crew.

1339
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:27,050
So the stars went to Betty Ford.

1340
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,290
But the crew that the electricians,

1341
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:31,190
the lighting guys,

1342
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:32,090
the makeup artists,

1343
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:32,924
the clothes,

1344
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:36,470
they all went to this place called
studio 12 and that's where she was from.

1345
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,900
So she took me over there and I met these
guys and I started going to meetings

1346
00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:42,680
there and I got,

1347
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,820
that's where I got sober.

1348
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,800
Those were the guys who helped me,

1349
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,060
who showed me,

1350
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:49,400
who I sponsored me with everything else.

1351
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,810
But they were also,

1352
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:52,890
they were in the
entertainment business and,

1353
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,590
and I always had a sense of humor.

1354
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:55,700
I could make people laugh,

1355
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:57,050
but I had never thought about it.

1356
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:58,640
Cause if you're not like,

1357
00:34:58,641 --> 00:34:58,881
you know,

1358
00:34:58,881 --> 00:35:01,400
I grew up in blue collar
home and then you,

1359
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:01,971
you grow up,

1360
00:35:01,971 --> 00:35:02,541
you go to school,

1361
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:03,231
you get a job,

1362
00:35:03,231 --> 00:35:04,700
like entertainment show business,

1363
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,260
nowhere on the radar.

1364
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,500
That's something that other
people do and you watch on TV.

1365
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,420
But now I know guys who were in it,

1366
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,680
I know people who are doing it.

1367
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,790
And I was teaching aerospace and
making people laugh and shit like that.

1368
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,271
And I said,

1369
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:18,290
I want to be a comic.

1370
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,360
And my AA sponsor was like,

1371
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:20,601
man,

1372
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:21,171
go for it,

1373
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:21,620
try it.

1374
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:21,850
And it,

1375
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:26,630
and I literally did one of those writing
classes and I did the five minute

1376
00:35:26,631 --> 00:35:30,230
graduation hooked and from then on that,

1377
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:32,060
so that's how my comedy career started.

1378
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,360
So it was it a writing like a sandy
shore type class and it was a,

1379
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:36,800
a guy named Len Ostvich,

1380
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,790
he to write for rich Jenny.

1381
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,020
Whoa.

1382
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,670
And he was um,

1383
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,330
he was in somewhere in Santa Monica.

1384
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:45,621
They would,

1385
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:48,630
they used to be a theater in Santa
Monica where they used to do,

1386
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,100
uh,

1387
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:50,911
I forget what it was,

1388
00:35:50,911 --> 00:35:53,370
this comedy central
half hour comedy thing,

1389
00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:54,600
I forget what it was called,

1390
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:55,450
but,

1391
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,011
but anyway,

1392
00:35:56,011 --> 00:35:58,440
he used to work there and
that's where he did the class.

1393
00:35:58,441 --> 00:35:59,310
So I did the,

1394
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,980
I did his six week writing class
and a five minute graduation show.

1395
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,411
And,

1396
00:36:05,411 --> 00:36:07,620
and just absolutely knew it.

1397
00:36:07,621 --> 00:36:08,311
Like I was like,

1398
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:09,270
this is what I'm going to do.

1399
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:11,220
Like I'm never going to
fix an airplane again.

1400
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,203
I'm doing this.

1401
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:12,691
And,

1402
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:13,524
and uh,

1403
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:14,041
then,

1404
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:14,490
you know,

1405
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,390
that's how it started.

1406
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:19,230
Then it was just open mikes and
grinding and everything else.

1407
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:19,800
And uh,

1408
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,120
I know a lot of dudes who got into it
because they would go to Aa and then

1409
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:26,310
they'd have those meetings and they go
up in the meetings and they would tell

1410
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:28,710
funny stories about shit they
did when they were fucked up.

1411
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,191
Yeah.

1412
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:29,791
I mean,

1413
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,290
I got laughs in meetings,

1414
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:31,800
but it was,

1415
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,330
it was almost unintentional.

1416
00:36:33,331 --> 00:36:34,051
It was just like,

1417
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:35,280
I'm telling a story,

1418
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,660
but it's coming out funny.

1419
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,460
Like I'm not trying to be funny.

1420
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:38,810
Right,

1421
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,090
right.

1422
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,100
It just comes out that
because you know how it is,

1423
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:43,410
if you have a sense of
humor when you tell a story,

1424
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,700
it's going to be funny,

1425
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,770
but I didn't know what I was doing,

1426
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,700
you know what I mean?

1427
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,510
It was just,

1428
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:51,720
I had this sense of humor
and what recovery did,

1429
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:54,120
it changed my sense of
humor from like this,

1430
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,680
this anger,

1431
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:56,700
belittling,

1432
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,670
ripping on people thing to jokes.

1433
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:00,720
Like I'm in on the joke,

1434
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:01,800
like now it's just funny,

1435
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,290
like instead of being an attack,

1436
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,101
oh,

1437
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:07,050
so before when you were doing coke,

1438
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,940
it was like aggressive,

1439
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:10,340
like angry at everybody.

1440
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,423
This guy,

1441
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:14,490
because you're paranoid
and you're fucked up and,

1442
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:16,830
and when you do talk
to people or whatever,

1443
00:37:16,831 --> 00:37:18,540
you're just kind of separate from him,

1444
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,420
you know?

1445
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,010
And uh,

1446
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:20,843
but anyway,

1447
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,301
yeah.

1448
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:21,781
So that,

1449
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,170
that literally it had I not gotten sober,

1450
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:26,340
I wouldn't have become a comic.

1451
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,383
I don't think.

1452
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:27,721
Jamie,

1453
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:28,590
can you throw some tea on?

1454
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:30,360
I don't know what the fuck
is going on in my throat,

1455
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,150
but I know that people
listening to this probably like,

1456
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,790
we stopped fucking clear on your throat.

1457
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:36,751
I can't,

1458
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:37,680
I can't help her folks.

1459
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:38,580
Um,

1460
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,270
I think it might,

1461
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,630
you might have gone a little heavy with
the grass fed butter and today's coffee.

1462
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:43,230
I don't know.

1463
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,063
Maybe that's it,

1464
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,830
but I'm never tried to butter in coffee.

1465
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:47,664
I heard it's better.

1466
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,050
It's better than sugar.

1467
00:37:49,051 --> 00:37:49,481
Try some,

1468
00:37:49,481 --> 00:37:52,210
you might start Fleming up
to maybe some of my age.

1469
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,370
I don't know.

1470
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,203
But um,

1471
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:54,990
for me,

1472
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,231
uh,

1473
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,190
when I was starting out,

1474
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,320
when I was an open mic or
if there was a lot of guys,

1475
00:37:58,321 --> 00:38:01,500
there was a guy named Dave Fitzgerald
who was a really funny guy.

1476
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,070
And uh,

1477
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,700
he was,

1478
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,211
he just,

1479
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:08,211
his whole life he was just doing blow
and partying and drinking and fucking up.

1480
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,190
And then he finally
got himself cleaned up,

1481
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:12,480
uh,

1482
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:12,991
started,

1483
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:13,400
uh,

1484
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:13,860
um,

1485
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,070
going to meetings and then started
making people laugh at these meetings.

1486
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:18,031
And he was a,

1487
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:18,811
he was a good writer,

1488
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:19,110
man,

1489
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:19,950
a funny comic.

1490
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,020
And then he got sick.

1491
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,161
He got sick one.

1492
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:23,971
I'm dying of cancer.

1493
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:24,750
He would've been,

1494
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,950
he would've been a big comic.

1495
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,843
He would have made it.

1496
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,560
He had a real good sense of humor.

1497
00:38:28,561 --> 00:38:29,400
He's a funny dude,

1498
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:30,511
but,

1499
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:30,710
uh,

1500
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:35,110
just the toll on his body all those years
and years of just fucking hitting it

1501
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:35,740
hard.

1502
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,220
I got,

1503
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,170
I have friends who that's happened to
mainly guys who shot drugs who like gave

1504
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:45,400
him up and then 20 years later
Hep c or something like that.

1505
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:46,234
Like some,

1506
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:52,020
some latent result from shooting drugs
in her twenties destroys their body in

1507
00:38:52,241 --> 00:38:53,074
their fifties.

1508
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:53,591
Yeah.

1509
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:54,890
That have seen one's a real pump.

1510
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,650
Real common one for guys who do heroin.

1511
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,513
Yeah.

1512
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,271
That was what,

1513
00:38:58,271 --> 00:38:59,104
um,

1514
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,010
the Tommy Lee,

1515
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:01,570
Pam Anderson accusation,

1516
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:01,840
right?

1517
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,310
It was,

1518
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:02,740
yeah.

1519
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,820
Cause they got tattoos together with
the same needle to show their love.

1520
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,360
Yeah.

1521
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:07,720
Who's,

1522
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,840
who's a tattoo artist.

1523
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,673
It doesn't,

1524
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:14,260
I don't know someone that loves Hep C,

1525
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,360
you know,

1526
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:16,660
I don't,

1527
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,940
I don't know a tattoo like
I know tattoo artists,

1528
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,380
like if you asked him to do they beat,

1529
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:20,740
uh,

1530
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,460
no.

1531
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,293
Like,

1532
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:23,531
no,

1533
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:23,800
I don't.

1534
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,060
The gloves they did.

1535
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:25,680
This is,

1536
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,051
this is,

1537
00:39:26,051 --> 00:39:26,830
uh,

1538
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:28,150
this is a real procedure.

1539
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,391
You know,

1540
00:39:28,391 --> 00:39:30,100
it's funny that you said that you,

1541
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,270
you grew up in a blue collar house and
that you didn't know like entertainment

1542
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:38,170
was never on the radar because I think
that's the case for a lot of people that

1543
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:39,550
once you're around someone,

1544
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,220
like when you're around those people
that were working in show business,

1545
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:42,520
you're like,

1546
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,380
oh these are just regular people.

1547
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:45,430
Like this is a job.

1548
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:45,651
Yeah,

1549
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:46,380
it's real.

1550
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:46,900
Yeah,

1551
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,733
it's real.

1552
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,930
That's the case with a lot of things,

1553
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:50,261
isn't it?

1554
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:51,400
It's all absolutely.

1555
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:51,851
Uh,

1556
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:53,440
we were talking about this the other day,

1557
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:55,780
we were talking about race car drivers,

1558
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:56,860
right?

1559
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,380
Cause a lot of drivers,

1560
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,260
their kids,

1561
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,940
their father was a race car driver.

1562
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,820
So to them that's normal.

1563
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,471
You know what I mean?

1564
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:05,711
Like,

1565
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:05,951
but,

1566
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:07,450
but to most people,

1567
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,510
the idea of driving a car to 150,

1568
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:11,740
200 miles an hour,

1569
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:13,030
they out Yada your mind.

1570
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,200
But like if you grow,

1571
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,520
but if your dad did it,

1572
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,030
then you start driving go karts
when you're like three years old.

1573
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:19,541
Yeah.

1574
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:20,201
You know what I mean?

1575
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:22,120
And then you grow up
and you do it and it's,

1576
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:24,670
you never think about like,

1577
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:25,870
this is unusual.

1578
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,430
Did you see that movie?

1579
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:27,820
Um,

1580
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,540
with Thor?

1581
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,200
What the fuck?

1582
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:29,471
Yeah.

1583
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:32,170
Rush rush for forever.

1584
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:35,260
I don't even know his
name and some bastard.

1585
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:36,310
I love it.

1586
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,121
I love that stuff.

1587
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:38,150
Formula One racing.

1588
00:40:38,151 --> 00:40:38,270
He,

1589
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,280
that's the real racing,

1590
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:39,610
right?

1591
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,170
Shit is his neck.

1592
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:43,600
I mean it's a whole different world,

1593
00:40:43,601 --> 00:40:48,520
but it's like so cool to be one of those
guys like the world champion now to

1594
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:50,890
Scott Lewis Hamilton out of England.

1595
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:54,250
Like this guy makes $30 million a year.

1596
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,200
He's got a private jet.

1597
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,920
I think his girlfriend was like the leader
of the spice girls or something like

1598
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:00,580
that for awhile.

1599
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,211
You know what I mean?

1600
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:01,780
And he,

1601
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,990
he flies his private jet to
Malibu to see his girlfriend.

1602
00:41:04,991 --> 00:41:08,920
And then they always show him like
hanging out at some award show.

1603
00:41:08,921 --> 00:41:09,371
Like he,

1604
00:41:09,371 --> 00:41:10,600
he knows everybody.

1605
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:11,434
They were like,

1606
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,540
he's in the Hamptons with Jamie Foxx.

1607
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:13,811
You're like,

1608
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:14,560
hell yeah.

1609
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,393
Like that's,

1610
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,860
that's how you're supposed
to screw all that.

1611
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:18,910
I'm training all at,

1612
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:20,560
I like this guy's living life.

1613
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,423
You know,

1614
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,910
you're like 30 years old and you're
kicking it in the Hamptons with Jamie Foxx

1615
00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:26,500
and banging the leader of the spice girl.

1616
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,633
Fuck yeah,

1617
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:28,690
that's,

1618
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,040
that's a world champion.

1619
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,950
That's Russian gas car.

1620
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:33,920
This,

1621
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,120
that

1622
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,450
you ain't drinking PBR.

1623
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:37,040
Yeah.

1624
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,000
The Nascar thing,

1625
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:38,360
I'm,

1626
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:38,751
I mean,

1627
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:41,360
I understand that people enjoy
it and I bet it's fun as hell.

1628
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,880
But that whole going left,

1629
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:44,480
I can't,

1630
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,490
I can't watch a race
where you only go left.

1631
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,780
I'm just can't watch.

1632
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,560
I couldn't 500 miles of the left.

1633
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,670
I was turning left.

1634
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:53,811
Well,

1635
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:54,830
there's a girl in there too.

1636
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:55,280
Yeah.

1637
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,220
Babette yeah.

1638
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:56,730
Yeah.

1639
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:57,890
And the Danica Patrick coming.

1640
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,611
Are there other girls?

1641
00:41:58,611 --> 00:41:59,444
Jamie,

1642
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,450
maybe one other room.

1643
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,830
The knock on Danica Patrick.

1644
00:42:03,831 --> 00:42:04,700
And it is true.

1645
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,540
It's like she ain't gonna win
and she has an attitude about it.

1646
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:10,400
It's like she did all the go daddy,

1647
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:10,711
you know,

1648
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:12,650
to bikini stuff and this and that.

1649
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:13,731
And then she's like,

1650
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:13,851
well,

1651
00:42:13,851 --> 00:42:18,650
why do you treat me like a girl
selling bikini pictures like you?

1652
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,450
You know,

1653
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,630
I don't think there's anything,

1654
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,170
you know,

1655
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,140
people will say there's
something that the,

1656
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,620
there's like it lessens a girl to sell
herself in bikinis or something like

1657
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:27,800
that.

1658
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,230
I think that is total bullshit.

1659
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,010
I know my take on it a girl's body,

1660
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:39,070
like when a girl has a hot body like
keys for a guy that is the most desirable

1661
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:41,060
thing to look at on the planet.

1662
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,500
When you see a girl like,

1663
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,480
like it has like Jennifer Lopez,

1664
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:45,314
his ass,

1665
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,660
you know that little thin waist
and big ass and like good luck.

1666
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,640
Like there was a girl in line to
take pictures with us after the show,

1667
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:57,290
the House of Blues in Houston and me and
Ian Edwards talked about her every 20

1668
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:58,760
minutes for the rest of the weekend.

1669
00:42:58,850 --> 00:42:59,683
Oh yeah.

1670
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:01,401
Oh No,

1671
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:01,821
I'm not.

1672
00:43:01,821 --> 00:43:04,490
This waste leg is like your arm.

1673
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:07,610
And then came and it was insane.

1674
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,570
It was insane.

1675
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,740
And we would be,

1676
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:14,270
we would be in the car and I would go
that it just didn't seem like a real body.

1677
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:14,631
And he goes,

1678
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:16,040
it didn't seem like a real body was like,

1679
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:16,910
what the fuck,

1680
00:43:16,911 --> 00:43:17,600
man,

1681
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,250
I'm not knocking her for doing it.

1682
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,150
This is my thing.

1683
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,170
Don't do it.

1684
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:23,330
And then complain when
people talk about it.

1685
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,021
You know what I mean?

1686
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:24,800
Like,

1687
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,670
like in other words,

1688
00:43:25,671 --> 00:43:27,230
Jennifer Lopez can never say,

1689
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,820
why aren't you looking at my ass?

1690
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:29,091
Well,

1691
00:43:29,091 --> 00:43:29,451
Jen,

1692
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:31,670
you call it j Lo,

1693
00:43:31,671 --> 00:43:32,630
you called us said,

1694
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:34,550
look at that ass and
I'm just playing alone.

1695
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,121
A lot of them,

1696
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:35,960
they started out,

1697
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:39,200
they start out trying to sell it that
way and then they want to be taken

1698
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:39,800
seriously.

1699
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,160
Right?

1700
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:40,371
Yeah.

1701
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:41,330
That does happen.

1702
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:43,010
But come on,

1703
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:44,960
you can still be taken seriously
if you're in your underwear.

1704
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:45,720
Who gives a shit?

1705
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,553
Yeah.

1706
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,710
Just admit that that's
what you're selling.

1707
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:49,490
Like you're,

1708
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:50,301
it's part of you.

1709
00:43:50,301 --> 00:43:51,200
It's not all of you,

1710
00:43:51,201 --> 00:43:51,960
but it's part of you.

1711
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,550
It was,

1712
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:52,821
you know,

1713
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:53,680
it story I loved.

1714
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:54,560
They went to the,

1715
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:55,394
um,

1716
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:56,503
women,

1717
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:56,810
uh,

1718
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:59,690
beach volleyball players and they said,

1719
00:43:59,691 --> 00:43:59,991
you know,

1720
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:01,390
you don't have to wear bikinis.

1721
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,900
You can change the uniform.

1722
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:03,681
And all of them were like,

1723
00:44:03,681 --> 00:44:03,831
no,

1724
00:44:03,831 --> 00:44:03,951
no,

1725
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:04,101
no,

1726
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:04,221
no,

1727
00:44:04,221 --> 00:44:04,610
no.

1728
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:07,700
We were wearing the Bikini's cause
they knew that they were like,

1729
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,211
yeah,

1730
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:12,020
we want people to watch
if we're wearing sweats.

1731
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,750
Nobody's watching beach volleyball.

1732
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:19,751
So I remember a knock when I first
started doing comedy especially,

1733
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,350
I always was like real nervous about
people seeing the fact that I had muscles

1734
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,520
seeing the fact that it worked out because
I always felt like that working out

1735
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,020
and comedy word,

1736
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,130
they just didn't go together.

1737
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:31,831
No Way.

1738
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:32,310
You couldn't,

1739
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:32,940
you couldn't have,

1740
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,530
you couldn't be built right.

1741
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,610
And do stand up,

1742
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:36,211
you know.

1743
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:40,890
But then I met guys like you and then I
met Nick Depaulo was the first one I met

1744
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:42,990
Nick Dipaolo in Boston does
back when he was young.

1745
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:44,400
He used to play football players,

1746
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:45,840
big giant neck fucking,

1747
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:46,890
and he was killing.

1748
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:47,220
Yeah.

1749
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:47,611
And I was like,

1750
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:48,241
this is bullshit.

1751
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:49,320
All you have to do is just be funny.

1752
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:49,990
Yeah.

1753
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:50,823
To hide it.

1754
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,400
Early in my career I
used to acknowledge it.

1755
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:54,960
I've stopped even acknowledging it,

1756
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:56,550
but it's always funny to
me when people are like,

1757
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:57,384
man,

1758
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,351
if they don't laugh,

1759
00:44:58,351 --> 00:44:59,280
you could just beat him up.

1760
00:44:59,340 --> 00:44:59,611
I'm like,

1761
00:44:59,611 --> 00:45:00,120
yeah,

1762
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,440
that's my second strategy.

1763
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:02,130
That's what we do.

1764
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:02,401
That's,

1765
00:45:02,401 --> 00:45:07,260
that's absolutely what I was going to
do because I'm a fucking Viking and I'm

1766
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:10,450
just going to jump into the crowd and
start beating the shit out of this is

1767
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:10,870
funny.

1768
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:11,703
Yeah.

1769
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:12,810
Yeah.

1770
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,130
The idea that uh,

1771
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,870
somehow or another like a person who's
fit or you have a good body or something

1772
00:45:18,871 --> 00:45:20,910
that that precludes you from being smart.

1773
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:22,110
Like that's a big thing with girls.

1774
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:23,400
Like if a girl is a hot body,

1775
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:27,060
thinks she's gotta be a fucking idiot
instantaneously you see grown in the

1776
00:45:27,061 --> 00:45:29,280
beginning a bikini with a nice body,

1777
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,090
a good percentage of the population wants
to write her off because it's an easy

1778
00:45:33,091 --> 00:45:33,924
ride for her.

1779
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:34,490
Cause if,

1780
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:36,180
cause we know that if
you are built like that,

1781
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:38,280
the odds that you're doing the work,

1782
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:42,030
the odds that you're really studying shit
and reading shit and paying attention

1783
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:45,810
and really analyzing your thoughts and
being objective and correcting mistakes,

1784
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:46,590
Eh,

1785
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:50,040
probably not cause you got dick thrown
at you like javelins all day long.

1786
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:51,120
You're just dodging deck.

1787
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:52,810
I mean a girl like that,

1788
00:45:52,811 --> 00:45:52,920
it's,

1789
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,960
it's easy to rest on your laurels,

1790
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,130
but it doesn't mean that,

1791
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,510
that to judge them on that.

1792
00:45:58,511 --> 00:45:58,681
I mean,

1793
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:00,180
if you've met enough people in your life,

1794
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:03,330
you realize that there's some really
hot chicks that are smart as fuck.

1795
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:03,780
Yeah.

1796
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,613
It's confusing.

1797
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,520
Definitely.

1798
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,353
But they're out there,

1799
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,231
but it happens.

1800
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:07,380
It,

1801
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,213
it's,

1802
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,250
it's like they say,

1803
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:14,040
and I found this to be true to the most
amazing women are the ones who got hot

1804
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,330
after high school.

1805
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,320
Hmm.

1806
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:16,740
Yeah.

1807
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:16,941
They,

1808
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:17,070
they,

1809
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:17,570
they,

1810
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:17,980
they,

1811
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:18,390
yeah,

1812
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:19,890
because they had to,

1813
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,860
they had a personality and they
were smart or this or that.

1814
00:46:22,861 --> 00:46:26,880
And then they hit their 20s and they kind
of figured out how all the parts come

1815
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:28,170
together and became like,

1816
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:29,340
Holy Shit hot.

1817
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:30,990
They still have that.

1818
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,240
They develop that personality or whatever.

1819
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:36,780
Whereas if you're born hot and
you just look great all your life,

1820
00:46:36,781 --> 00:46:37,614
and I've met,

1821
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,080
I've met women like this
that they have no clue.

1822
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:43,740
Like they really think life
is that easy for everyone.

1823
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,410
Right?

1824
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:44,780
Like they,

1825
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,570
it's like you understand like everyone,

1826
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:53,571
like some people have to wait in line
for shit club is some people like,

1827
00:46:53,761 --> 00:46:54,300
yeah,

1828
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:54,750
Eh,

1829
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,160
it's no knock against him.

1830
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:56,730
It's like,

1831
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,510
you know,

1832
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,460
certain people when the birth lottery,

1833
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:00,380
you know,

1834
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,800
you just want like Michael
Jordan ability to fly.

1835
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:05,490
Yeah.

1836
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,290
But Michael Jordan is a perfect example.

1837
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:07,471
I mean,

1838
00:47:07,471 --> 00:47:09,300
Michael Jordan didn't even
make his high school team,

1839
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:10,134
Michael Jordan,

1840
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:14,010
he failed like a lot and
then become obsessed,

1841
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,660
became obsessed with success.

1842
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,440
And then,

1843
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,690
but then he also happened to grow to six,

1844
00:47:18,691 --> 00:47:20,670
seven with the jumping ability.

1845
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,211
You know what I mean?

1846
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:22,830
It's like that was that,

1847
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:23,641
that helped.

1848
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:24,001
But yeah,

1849
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:24,271
it's,

1850
00:47:24,271 --> 00:47:25,920
it's great when you do all of that,

1851
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:28,020
but you still have to have,

1852
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,340
I think you have to have some talent.

1853
00:47:29,341 --> 00:47:29,791
It's like being,

1854
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,760
it's like comics,

1855
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:31,900
you know?

1856
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:36,250
I've always thought Dave Chappelle had
an unfair advantage because Dave looked

1857
00:47:36,251 --> 00:47:38,440
funny when he came out and I don't,

1858
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,100
Joey Diaz,

1859
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,330
I don't mean that as a knock.

1860
00:47:40,331 --> 00:47:43,390
I mean like when you see him on
stage before he opened his mouth,

1861
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:43,660
you're like,

1862
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:43,751
oh,

1863
00:47:43,751 --> 00:47:44,410
this guy's,

1864
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:45,580
this guy looks funny.

1865
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:46,630
This is going to be fun.

1866
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:48,040
You know Joey's like that.

1867
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:49,690
When Joey starts talking,

1868
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:50,441
you're like,

1869
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:53,470
this guy's hilarious
because you think Joey,

1870
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:54,940
Joey's one of those guys.

1871
00:47:54,941 --> 00:47:57,030
You he'd like a rocky look ports.

1872
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,940
Another one where you think they're
playing a character and then you find out,

1873
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:01,121
no,

1874
00:48:01,121 --> 00:48:02,200
this is really him.

1875
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:04,060
He's really that guy.

1876
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:07,480
So it makes it even funnier
if Joey's a human cartoon.

1877
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:09,940
I mean he just walks out and
as soon as he walks on stage,

1878
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,980
people start laughing.

1879
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:12,910
They start smiling.

1880
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:13,360
Yeah.

1881
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,150
What the fuck is this guy been
doing for the past 15 years?

1882
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,120
I love Joey Man.

1883
00:48:19,121 --> 00:48:20,410
He's my favorite of all time.

1884
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:22,000
I think he's the funniest
guy that's ever lived.

1885
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:22,893
I really do.

1886
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:23,451
I don't,

1887
00:48:23,451 --> 00:48:26,820
I don't think there's anybody any funnier
because I think if you look at common

1888
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:27,820
and you look at stand up comedy,

1889
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,460
I really think that we're right
now we're in the golden age.

1890
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,530
I don't think there's ever
been more funny comics.

1891
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:36,850
I think too because of the great comics
because the Internet guys like Joey that

1892
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:39,460
probably would have never made it on
television and they wouldn't have gotten a

1893
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:41,770
shot on the tonight show back in the day.

1894
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:45,370
Now you get to find out how funny they
really are from podcasts and you get to

1895
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:50,371
go see them do stand up and I think
if you look at like all the greats,

1896
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:52,840
like if you go back in time,

1897
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:55,600
comedy gets better over the years,

1898
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,400
like the greatest of all time.

1899
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,290
Like only Richard Pryor is,

1900
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:00,850
he's the one guy that like,

1901
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:04,510
I'll go back and I'll listen to his
old stuff and it's still really funny.

1902
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,380
It's still really funny but like you
go back and listen to Lenny Bruce,

1903
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:09,160
boom.

1904
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,410
It's hard to listen to them and
it's not really funny anymore.

1905
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,650
I think Carlin was always funny once he,

1906
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,140
once he got past that
Hippie weatherman thing,

1907
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,220
once,

1908
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,630
once he put that down,

1909
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,690
Carlin became just these,

1910
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,970
I mean the observations
he made were hilarious.

1911
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:25,371
And,

1912
00:49:25,371 --> 00:49:26,250
and Cosby and I,

1913
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:27,093
you know,

1914
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,210
obviously everything,

1915
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,310
everything with Cosby is now tainted.

1916
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,710
Yeah.

1917
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:32,111
Cause,

1918
00:49:32,111 --> 00:49:33,060
but he's still omic.

1919
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:33,700
Yeah.

1920
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,150
Was,

1921
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:34,630
it was a,

1922
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:35,440
he was a beast.

1923
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,250
Like you listen to it,

1924
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:39,700
Noah's Ark and some of that
old shit and it's like genius.

1925
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:40,421
That was great.

1926
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:41,620
Like it would still be,

1927
00:49:41,621 --> 00:49:41,831
you know,

1928
00:49:41,831 --> 00:49:44,290
we had this argument once
somebody threw it out,

1929
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:44,651
they said,

1930
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:46,330
if caused me started today,

1931
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,410
would he have made it?

1932
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:47,891
And I was like,

1933
00:49:47,891 --> 00:49:48,540
fuck yeah,

1934
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,090
yeah,

1935
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:49,780
for sure.

1936
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,630
He knew the adjusted,

1937
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,120
they,

1938
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:51,420
they,

1939
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,150
they all would have adjusted
to the new level of comedy.

1940
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,760
The level of comedy is
hire people expect more.

1941
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:58,481
It's just,

1942
00:49:58,481 --> 00:49:59,320
I think it's higher now.

1943
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,070
You know,

1944
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:02,170
I just think that as time goes on,

1945
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,033
things get better.

1946
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,270
Um,

1947
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,610
but at all the guys that I've ever seen,

1948
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,230
and I saw Kennison live,

1949
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:12,880
I s I worked with prior at the end a
bunch of times at the comedy store,

1950
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:14,680
but he wasn't really prior anymore.

1951
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:17,840
He was real sick and he was in a
wheelchair at the time and they,

1952
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,210
they would literally carry him
chewy from the comedy store and,

1953
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:22,803
and um,

1954
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:23,703
um,

1955
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:24,900
uh,

1956
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,270
what,

1957
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:26,140
what the fuck is her name?

1958
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:27,650
Um,

1959
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,311
Martinez,

1960
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:29,150
what the fuck is her name?

1961
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,100
Anyone.

1962
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,240
They would carry her,

1963
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,201
they would carry him,

1964
00:50:33,201 --> 00:50:34,034
they would carry,

1965
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,930
her husband would carry,

1966
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:36,620
um,

1967
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:41,150
Richard Pryor through the audience and
sit him down and then they would crank

1968
00:50:41,151 --> 00:50:41,750
the microphone.

1969
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,080
I'm like,

1970
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,250
Shh,

1971
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:44,420
real loud.

1972
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:44,720
Cause he,

1973
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:49,040
he could barely talk and he was on
medication and he would drink and he would

1974
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:49,970
drink and he would talk.

1975
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,100
And it just wasn't that
good and it was sad.

1976
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,120
So,

1977
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:53,510
but I,

1978
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:54,920
but I did get a chance to see him,

1979
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:55,370
you know,

1980
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:56,360
when I was younger,

1981
00:50:56,361 --> 00:50:56,791
I saw him,

1982
00:50:56,791 --> 00:50:56,960
you know,

1983
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,130
live in the sunset strip.

1984
00:50:58,131 --> 00:51:01,520
I saw the movies and then I saw prior,

1985
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:03,830
I saw Carlin live a few times.

1986
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,930
No one has ever made me laugh.

1987
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:08,600
Like Joey Diaz when that guy's on,

1988
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,220
when he's on and he went,

1989
00:51:10,221 --> 00:51:13,490
his face is red and he's fucking
screaming and going crazy.

1990
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,240
I just,

1991
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,560
I don't think there's anybody better.

1992
00:51:15,561 --> 00:51:16,430
I think he's the funny,

1993
00:51:16,431 --> 00:51:19,240
I think overall he's the
funniest guy that's ever lived.

1994
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:20,123
Yeah.

1995
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,493
I got to,

1996
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:22,443
I got to work with,

1997
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,150
uh,

1998
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:26,350
Carlin and I met Cosby.

1999
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:27,230
Never got to work with him,

2000
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:28,610
but I never got to meet prior.

2001
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:33,050
He was the only one last summer
I worked with Rickles railing.

2002
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:34,040
Rickles is,

2003
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,590
he's in his late eighties
and it's the same thing.

2004
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:37,850
Like he's off stage.

2005
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:38,960
They haven't been a wheelchair.

2006
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:39,681
He can walk,

2007
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:43,530
but it's like they helped them get around
and then they bring them out and then

2008
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:47,000
he sits at a piano and
the minute the lights hit,

2009
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:48,620
he's fucking Rickles.

2010
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,161
Why?

2011
00:51:49,161 --> 00:51:50,720
One of the highlights of my life,

2012
00:51:50,721 --> 00:51:53,330
I got it on video is backstage.

2013
00:51:53,331 --> 00:51:54,830
Rickles was ripping on me.

2014
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,533
Oh,

2015
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,900
you're fucking cry the next day.

2016
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:02,120
I don't know what he's six [inaudible]
nine six [inaudible] 10 he could kill

2017
00:52:02,121 --> 00:52:02,511
somebody,

2018
00:52:02,511 --> 00:52:03,051
God forbid.

2019
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:04,250
And you can catch them this weekend.

2020
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:08,390
At a San Quintin and he'll probably be
inside Friday cause you know Alonzo.

2021
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:08,571
Yeah,

2022
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:11,270
it took a white man's name so
he's not in jail and just shit.

2023
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:12,903
It's just

2024
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:15,381
Bam,

2025
00:52:15,381 --> 00:52:15,950
Bam.

2026
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:18,200
And all you can do is sit
there and fucking laugh.

2027
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:18,501
Yeah.

2028
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:20,090
Jeff Ross told me work with them too,

2029
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,320
and he said the same thing.

2030
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:25,100
He said once he went to the lights
are on and the microphone's on.

2031
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:25,940
He comes alive.

2032
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,420
Yeah.

2033
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,010
It's uh,

2034
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:27,320
it,

2035
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,960
it was great to watch and it's
one of those things like it's,

2036
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,820
that's a video I'll have forever.

2037
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:32,520
Like yeah,

2038
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,520
that was a nice brick walls ripped on me.

2039
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,680
So buddy hockey yelled at me once.

2040
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:37,791
Oh Man,

2041
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:40,010
I got a great fucking Buddy Hackett story.

2042
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:40,910
Yeah.

2043
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:41,450
I uh,

2044
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:46,450
doing a benefit and Robin Williams was
presenting Buddy Hackett with this award.

2045
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,040
So I'm outside.

2046
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:49,341
It was,

2047
00:52:49,341 --> 00:52:49,760
let's see,

2048
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,390
it was,

2049
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:51,470
I was on the show,

2050
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,380
I want to say shoemaker was on his show.

2051
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,353
And Anyway,

2052
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:58,400
so I'm just outside.

2053
00:52:58,401 --> 00:52:59,510
This is when I still smoke,

2054
00:52:59,511 --> 00:53:00,380
so I'm having a cigarette.

2055
00:53:00,381 --> 00:53:01,640
So Buddy Hackett walks up,

2056
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:01,851
right.

2057
00:53:01,851 --> 00:53:02,810
I've never met him.

2058
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,280
I don't know anybody.

2059
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,930
It's right after dawn and I missed it.

2060
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:07,320
The nappy headed hosting.

2061
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,211
Right.

2062
00:53:08,211 --> 00:53:09,230
So he comes up to me,

2063
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:09,531
he's like,

2064
00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:09,771
yeah,

2065
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:10,604
I know.

2066
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,770
I know you're going to let it happen.

2067
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,011
Right.

2068
00:53:13,011 --> 00:53:15,380
Cause you black comics when
it comes to being funny,

2069
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,120
I mean the colors you colored guys are
just so hilarious when you negro start,

2070
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,680
Jesse keeps going says keeps going.

2071
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,010
Saying the same thing.

2072
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,280
Different words for black and I am
fucking cracking up because it's like,

2073
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,323
I don't even know.

2074
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:34,260
But it was great.

2075
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,093
It was great.

2076
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:35,550
Those,

2077
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:36,600
those guys were,

2078
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:37,770
they had a thing,

2079
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,340
you know,

2080
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:42,960
it's different time at a different
time and they had a camaraderie and a,

2081
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:43,950
and when they were,

2082
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,020
when they weren't on TV
or on screen or whatever,

2083
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:49,520
they had no filter like they just did.

2084
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:53,610
That's why he was doing that because you
know back in the day that's what you,

2085
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:54,503
that's what you did,

2086
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:55,500
what you did.

2087
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,850
They fucked around with
each other and they,

2088
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:58,590
those guys didn't even have comedy clubs.

2089
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,960
Those guys had to start
off on variety shows.

2090
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:01,410
Yeah.

2091
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:05,460
Whether it'd be like a dancer or a band
and they'd be like the NMC and they'd

2092
00:54:05,461 --> 00:54:06,870
have to come out and you know,

2093
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:10,740
shuck and Jive and it would
mc strip clubs and jazz clubs.

2094
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,180
You ever had to a strip club?

2095
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,133
No,

2096
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,370
I did once I did a Jack and
Jill Strip club in Woonsocket,

2097
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:18,204
Rhode Island,

2098
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:20,580
Jack and Jill means a guy goes
out and the girl goes out.

2099
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,201
It was atrocious.

2100
00:54:22,201 --> 00:54:25,770
There was no one in the audience
and there was maybe like a no,

2101
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:26,460
no bullshit.

2102
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,870
Like six people in the audience
spread out like two here,

2103
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:29,580
one over there,

2104
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:30,413
three over there.

2105
00:54:30,510 --> 00:54:32,270
It was so bad that I couldn't even,

2106
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,880
I can't even say I bombed
because there was no response.

2107
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:36,330
It was,

2108
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:37,710
it didn't feel like a bombing.

2109
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,830
It felt like they weren't even
acknowledging that I was alive.

2110
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,960
It was the strangest thing ever.

2111
00:54:42,961 --> 00:54:46,740
And then this guy and this girl
who are both equally unattractive,

2112
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,270
the guy would dance first.

2113
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,130
I don't remember who danced
first guy or the girl,

2114
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:53,250
but they were both disgusting and
they both had terrible tattoos.

2115
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:57,330
The guy was coverage tattoos up with like
I on his arm and the girl had like the

2116
00:54:57,331 --> 00:54:59,310
way I described it on her ass,

2117
00:54:59,311 --> 00:55:04,311
it looked like someone tried to chew
into her ass like that ubid into hand,

2118
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:09,450
got the ink on your teeth and
tried to chew a snake into her ass.

2119
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:11,190
That's how bad the tattoo looked.

2120
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:12,010
It was just a,

2121
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,800
it was one of those moments where I go,

2122
00:55:13,801 --> 00:55:14,161
wow,

2123
00:55:14,161 --> 00:55:15,480
I'm never going to forget this place.

2124
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:16,740
I did have a moment.

2125
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:18,360
I worked with the chip and Dales guys.

2126
00:55:18,361 --> 00:55:18,640
What's,

2127
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,950
I guess this is hosting a straight,

2128
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:20,611
anybody try to blow,

2129
00:55:20,611 --> 00:55:21,830
you know,

2130
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,280
they didn't know I wasn't their type,

2131
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,253
but

2132
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,060
it was some little casino,

2133
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:27,751
you know,

2134
00:55:27,751 --> 00:55:31,290
one of those sides of the road casino
is about an hour and a half north of

2135
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:32,124
Sacramento.

2136
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:35,780
So we're in the middle of farm
country and you know what,

2137
00:55:35,781 --> 00:55:36,510
it's just like,

2138
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:36,811
okay,

2139
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:38,340
here's a casino for no reason.

2140
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:43,770
Had to be 1500 farmers' wives,

2141
00:55:43,771 --> 00:55:47,820
chicks in this crowd waiting
for the chip and Dales guys.

2142
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:48,091
Right.

2143
00:55:48,091 --> 00:55:49,470
So I go out there,

2144
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:54,950
so I'm out there for about maybe 12
seconds before the first take it off,

2145
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:56,400
you know?

2146
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,730
And it just was one of those
did just screaming right.

2147
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:00,001
So,

2148
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:00,751
so whatever.

2149
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:01,800
So I didn't,

2150
00:56:01,801 --> 00:56:02,880
I didn't even do jokes.

2151
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:04,880
I just yelled back at him and,

2152
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:07,980
and something in and I would
like open a button on my shirt,

2153
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:09,953
you know?

2154
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,820
But the funny thing was like it was
almost like they weren't in on it.

2155
00:56:14,821 --> 00:56:17,430
Like they were trying to
fuck the chip and Dales guys,

2156
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,010
you know these guys are like,

2157
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,130
it's like one of like it's
a lottery thing to find.

2158
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:23,921
Which one of these,

2159
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:24,970
it's a straight guy.

2160
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:28,120
And the other thing was
these guys were kids.

2161
00:56:28,121 --> 00:56:28,954
They were like,

2162
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:29,771
you know,

2163
00:56:29,771 --> 00:56:31,570
I guess it's a Chippendale's road crew.

2164
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:33,160
It's not like the main guys.

2165
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:38,510
These guys are like 20 2123 and these
women are like in their fifties you know,

2166
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:39,740
I was like,

2167
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,020
this is going to end badly.

2168
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:43,810
Monsters,

2169
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:44,800
farmer's wife,

2170
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,530
monsters screaming cigarette breath

2171
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,253
dragons.

2172
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:53,141
When I was a kid,

2173
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:57,060
I had two friends that were a male
strippers and one of them was a,

2174
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,990
an older guy used to work
out that they were pulled,

2175
00:56:58,991 --> 00:56:59,631
worked out to the gym.

2176
00:56:59,631 --> 00:57:01,110
I worked out and I'm,

2177
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,230
one of them was an older guy,

2178
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:02,531
one of them,

2179
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:04,690
the younger guy and the older guy,

2180
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,250
it was was real fucking weird.

2181
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:07,120
It's just real weird.

2182
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,010
Like he had a pair of
underwear that was a,

2183
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:13,150
an elephant trunk and his Dick would go
with the trunk is and when he had like

2184
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,110
little ears,

2185
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,113
you know,

2186
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,510
it was very fucking strange.

2187
00:57:16,511 --> 00:57:20,380
He would joke around but shit
got real one day when we're all,

2188
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:20,651
uh,

2189
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:21,580
we're all hanging around.

2190
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:23,950
He was talking about girls and you know,

2191
00:57:23,951 --> 00:57:24,650
go to this bat,

2192
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:25,091
any guy was,

2193
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:25,361
you know,

2194
00:57:25,361 --> 00:57:27,100
it was pretty built girls,

2195
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:27,300
they,

2196
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:27,610
you know,

2197
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,910
they go to these bachelor
party or Bachelorette parties
and you dance for these

2198
00:57:30,911 --> 00:57:34,060
girls and the girls get about to get
married and she winds up suck on my Dick.

2199
00:57:34,061 --> 00:57:34,894
It's crazy.

2200
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,220
And we're all sitting around laughing.

2201
00:57:36,221 --> 00:57:37,054
I go,

2202
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:41,730
you have to dance for guys and you get
to hear a pin drop in that fucking,

2203
00:57:41,731 --> 00:57:42,564
you know,

2204
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:43,810
and uh,

2205
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:44,890
he looks at me and I look at it,

2206
00:57:44,891 --> 00:57:46,630
I'm looking into his soul man.

2207
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:46,811
He goes,

2208
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:47,644
yeah,

2209
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:48,071
yeah,

2210
00:57:48,071 --> 00:57:48,670
but I,

2211
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:49,503
I hate it.

2212
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:54,580
It's the weirdest moment.

2213
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:57,130
I'll never forget that moment
looking at his eyes of him saying,

2214
00:57:57,131 --> 00:57:57,431
yeah,

2215
00:57:57,431 --> 00:57:58,510
but a hate it.

2216
00:57:59,030 --> 00:57:59,863
They hate it.

2217
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:00,341
I'm like,

2218
00:58:00,341 --> 00:58:01,360
you dance for guys.

2219
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:02,651
What's that like?

2220
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:03,550
And then everybody like,

2221
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:04,450
yeah,

2222
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:05,283
what's that like?

2223
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:07,240
Finally someone asked,

2224
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:08,620
finally someone asked,

2225
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,870
but the other dude was as younger guys,

2226
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:12,460
Young Puerto Rican kid
that I said work out with.

2227
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:13,410
And uh,

2228
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:15,820
he wound up doing a lot
of dance and for dudes,

2229
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:18,010
he went up to answer for
dudes and I think he told me,

2230
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:19,440
and let dude suck his dick too.

2231
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:20,653
It's just like,

2232
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:21,541
he goes,

2233
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:21,620
well,

2234
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:21,740
hey,

2235
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,050
as long as I'm not doing anything,

2236
00:58:23,051 --> 00:58:23,550
man,

2237
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:23,860
it goes,

2238
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,810
dude wants to give me
$1,000 to suck my Dick.

2239
00:58:25,811 --> 00:58:26,110
I'm like,

2240
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:26,943
what?

2241
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:27,281
Yeah,

2242
00:58:27,281 --> 00:58:28,600
I was going to say it's probably just,

2243
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:29,853
it's just money,

2244
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:30,341
you know,

2245
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:32,230
but I don't believe it
didn't do anything either.

2246
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:33,483
You know,

2247
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:34,251
dollars a suck.

2248
00:58:34,251 --> 00:58:34,811
Is that okay?

2249
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:36,400
Well 10,000 if you suck mine,

2250
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:37,031
well,

2251
00:58:37,031 --> 00:58:37,864
Hey,

2252
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,310
long as you're here.

2253
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:40,203
Yeah.

2254
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:41,860
Not going to take long.

2255
00:58:41,861 --> 00:58:42,131
Right.

2256
00:58:42,131 --> 00:58:43,060
So when you leave here,

2257
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,650
they're going to say you suck Dick.

2258
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:45,840
Whether you suck dick or nuts.

2259
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:46,840
So you might as well make pick,

2260
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:48,040
pick up 10 grand.

2261
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,040
You're already in the neighborhood
when a guy is sucking your Dick,

2262
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:52,240
you're already in the neighborhood.

2263
00:58:52,241 --> 00:58:52,570
Yeah.

2264
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,670
You might as well just suck his
dick and make the real money.

2265
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:55,960
It's,

2266
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:56,470
you know,

2267
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:56,690
I'm,

2268
00:58:56,690 --> 00:58:57,010
I'm,

2269
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,030
I was trying to think,

2270
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:00,760
I'm trying to think
what comedy is related.

2271
00:59:00,761 --> 00:59:04,030
Like if there's a comedy Gig
that's that bad where you're like,

2272
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:05,170
fuck it,

2273
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:06,003
you know,

2274
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:06,520
a in,

2275
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:06,911
but yeah,

2276
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:07,630
we don't have,

2277
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,280
there's no comment.

2278
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:11,810
There's no one nighter where you,

2279
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:15,480
where it is a possibility of you sucking
a guy's Dick because they know us.

2280
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:16,241
You're a gay dude.

2281
00:59:16,241 --> 00:59:18,790
Unless you're a gate and you're
trying to hook it up if you're trying.

2282
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:19,061
No,

2283
00:59:19,061 --> 00:59:20,560
I'm talking about where it's just,

2284
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,800
it just happens.

2285
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,210
Yeah.

2286
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:23,811
Yeah.

2287
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:26,330
Nor is there a Gig for
chicks where they wind up,

2288
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:27,463
you know,

2289
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,820
for chick comics?

2290
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,833
Yeah.

2291
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,370
I it,

2292
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,200
I don't know what it's,

2293
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,340
it's different for women
on the road though,

2294
00:59:34,341 --> 00:59:35,060
right?

2295
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:37,210
Like they don't go out and get,

2296
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,440
their whole energy is different.

2297
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,590
They get sad there.

2298
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:43,340
Their whole energy is,

2299
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:43,991
oh boy,

2300
00:59:43,991 --> 00:59:44,824
Dick.

2301
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,580
They know and don't like,

2302
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:47,630
I don't want Dick.

2303
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:49,220
I don't want you showing me a dick.

2304
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,170
Don't they usually bring dogs with them?

2305
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:52,340
They bring a little dog.

2306
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:54,650
A lot of them have dogs
and little tiny dog.

2307
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:58,370
The weirdest thing I heard
after we did last comic,

2308
00:59:58,371 --> 01:00:03,110
we were touring this and that and Tammy
passcode said she went to a Gig and a

2309
01:00:03,111 --> 01:00:08,111
guy had a life size cut out of her that
he brought to the Gig and he wanted her

2310
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:09,704
to sign.

2311
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:12,860
How fucking weird would that moment be?

2312
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:13,883
Ooh,

2313
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,370
that's rough.

2314
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,140
Is Tammy still live in
the middle of nowhere?

2315
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:19,400
She was like in Pennsylvania.

2316
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:20,420
Still in,

2317
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:20,721
yeah.

2318
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:22,100
She's in Pennsylvania.

2319
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:22,611
And,

2320
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:22,970
uh,

2321
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:23,781
she's doing good.

2322
01:00:23,781 --> 01:00:24,530
She's doing her,

2323
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:25,310
you know,

2324
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:26,330
she's doing great with Standup,

2325
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:26,540
right?

2326
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:26,741
Yeah.

2327
01:00:26,741 --> 01:00:27,910
She's doing great with standup.

2328
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:31,670
She though she was part of
Jenny Mccarthy's tour and
then she's doing her own

2329
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:32,270
gigs.

2330
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:32,380
Yeah,

2331
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:32,901
that's right.

2332
01:00:32,901 --> 01:00:34,190
She does her radio show too.

2333
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:34,431
Right.

2334
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:37,310
Then she got a Sirius XM radio show.

2335
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:38,480
Tammy's always cool.

2336
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:39,020
I love,

2337
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:39,810
always been cool.

2338
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:39,970
We,

2339
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:40,670
it's funny too,

2340
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,380
we had a good time when we did the show.

2341
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,430
Who else did you do it with
a wet season when you are,

2342
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,120
I was in seasons two and three.

2343
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,860
You weren't Bolsa you got,

2344
01:00:48,861 --> 01:00:49,220
well,

2345
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:52,970
three was three was the kind of thrown
together season where they took comics

2346
01:00:52,971 --> 01:00:55,610
from season one and put them
against the comics from season two.

2347
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:56,751
So,

2348
01:00:56,751 --> 01:00:58,640
but I did it with Heffron,

2349
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:00,200
Gary Gulman,

2350
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:01,280
Todd glass,

2351
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:02,900
Kathleen Madigan,

2352
01:01:02,901 --> 01:01:05,090
Tammy Corey Holcomb,

2353
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:05,983
aunt.

2354
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:07,250
Um,

2355
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,410
that's a good crew up to aunt.

2356
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,910
And it was the reason why I got
in a fight with Buddy Hackett.

2357
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:12,220
I know we,

2358
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:16,520
we know that story and I'm trying
to remember what's his name?

2359
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,420
Um,

2360
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,253
Jay London.

2361
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:18,921
Oh,

2362
01:01:18,921 --> 01:01:20,300
Jay Jay London.

2363
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,490
J London man.

2364
01:01:21,491 --> 01:01:22,400
He's a funny dude.

2365
01:01:22,401 --> 01:01:22,740
Man.

2366
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:23,630
Jay's funny man,

2367
01:01:23,631 --> 01:01:24,351
but he's a boy.

2368
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,820
You talking about a guy who was a mess.

2369
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:26,001
Oh,

2370
01:01:26,001 --> 01:01:26,834
he's crazy.

2371
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:27,351
We ain't,

2372
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:29,900
London was selling American
flags after nine 11.

2373
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,100
That's what he's doing for a living.

2374
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:31,610
Yeah.

2375
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:32,190
And uh,

2376
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:33,110
I work with them.

2377
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:38,290
The first Gig I ever did on television
in 1992 I want to say two or three.

2378
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,010
I did stand up spotlight
in New York and it was me,

2379
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:47,450
me and Jay London and a couple of other
people and Jay and I were friends,

2380
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:47,691
you know,

2381
01:01:47,691 --> 01:01:52,340
from the New York comedy scene and then
he just kinda like faded away and then

2382
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:57,110
he came to La and in 2001 he was
like basically like almost homeless.

2383
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:57,530
Yeah.

2384
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:57,771
Yeah.

2385
01:01:57,771 --> 01:01:58,960
Before he did last comp.

2386
01:01:58,961 --> 01:02:03,920
Like he was the only guy who stood in
line on last comic and made it to the

2387
01:02:03,921 --> 01:02:05,060
finals of the show.

2388
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,260
Wow.

2389
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,640
So he went through the whole line.

2390
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,920
You went through the whole
addition wait outside,

2391
01:02:09,921 --> 01:02:12,770
but I'll give it my best j London moment.

2392
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,211
We were,

2393
01:02:14,211 --> 01:02:14,870
uh,

2394
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:16,760
we were in the house and it was a game.

2395
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:17,271
Hef,

2396
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:18,890
Ron had called it 10.

2397
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,550
I don't know if you've ever heard of this,

2398
01:02:20,551 --> 01:02:25,320
but there's a group of people and you
start telling facts about your stuffs self

2399
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,780
starting from the most innocuous thing.

2400
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,010
That's number 10.

2401
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:29,910
Like I might say,

2402
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:30,421
you know,

2403
01:02:30,421 --> 01:02:31,260
my name's Alonzo,

2404
01:02:31,261 --> 01:02:32,280
I'm from New York City,

2405
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:33,001
you know,

2406
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:35,040
and you go around then number nine,

2407
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:35,281
you,

2408
01:02:35,281 --> 01:02:36,114
you know,

2409
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:39,660
I had my first girlfriend
at 18 or whatever.

2410
01:02:39,661 --> 01:02:40,201
You know what I mean?

2411
01:02:40,201 --> 01:02:40,591
Like you,

2412
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:43,920
you go number six j j London.

2413
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:49,250
Sometimes I get mad at myself and I ripped
pubic hairs out with pliers and I was

2414
01:02:49,741 --> 01:02:49,921
like,

2415
01:02:49,921 --> 01:02:51,210
that's your fucking six.

2416
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,810
Cause I had to go after him.

2417
01:02:54,811 --> 01:02:55,350
I was like,

2418
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:56,520
that's number six.

2419
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,650
What the fuck do I have?

2420
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:00,150
Like that's six.

2421
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:00,960
And he was serious.

2422
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:01,793
Absolutely,

2423
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,660
absolutely like mad at himself.

2424
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:04,680
Like what is your,

2425
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:05,341
what does number,

2426
01:03:05,341 --> 01:03:06,840
I don't think we got to number two.

2427
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,250
What is that amount of himself for?

2428
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:09,413
Who knows,

2429
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:10,140
who knows?

2430
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:10,460
Jay,

2431
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:11,490
Jay's a sweetheart.

2432
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:11,940
But uh,

2433
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:13,500
but definitely a tortured soul.

2434
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:14,580
There were a lot of demons.

2435
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:15,690
It was,

2436
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:20,610
it was fascinating watching him become
famous because knowing him as long as I

2437
01:03:20,611 --> 01:03:21,444
knew him.

2438
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:26,130
And then for us for a small window
of like a year or so after last comic

2439
01:03:26,131 --> 01:03:26,521
standing,

2440
01:03:26,521 --> 01:03:27,990
he was really well known low.

2441
01:03:27,991 --> 01:03:28,561
Absolutely.

2442
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:29,394
People loved him.

2443
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:29,970
Yeah.

2444
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:30,900
We were at the store.

2445
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:31,734
People would love him.

2446
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:32,370
He would,

2447
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:34,560
people come up to him at the
store and they'll go get,

2448
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:35,670
can I get a picture with you?

2449
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:36,480
And He'd be like,

2450
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,140
me,

2451
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:37,973
you want a picture with me?

2452
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,090
Like he was like,

2453
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:40,770
like genuinely confused.

2454
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,820
He never figured it out.

2455
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,630
He was a guy who needed
someone to take care of him.

2456
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:46,460
He needed a manager.

2457
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:46,651
Yeah.

2458
01:03:46,651 --> 01:03:48,120
He needed a man in here that would,

2459
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:48,360
uh,

2460
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,560
handle and take care of him,

2461
01:03:49,561 --> 01:03:50,680
which he didn't book them.

2462
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:51,780
Just get them booked.

2463
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:52,531
I mean,

2464
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:55,230
it's just like having him
manage his career on his own.

2465
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,550
Did he ever have a manager?

2466
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:57,240
He,

2467
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:59,570
he was with Barry briefly.

2468
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:00,453
Exactly.

2469
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:01,543
Exactly.

2470
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:01,800
Yeah.

2471
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,101
No,

2472
01:04:02,101 --> 01:04:02,880
he didn't.

2473
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,300
We,

2474
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:03,720
we,

2475
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,070
we toured with him for a while,

2476
01:04:05,071 --> 01:04:08,630
meet him and Gary Goldman toward
for about six months really.

2477
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:09,653
And um,

2478
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:14,010
me and Goldman would call it London
itis where you just get tired of Jay.

2479
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:14,821
Like you love him.

2480
01:04:14,821 --> 01:04:15,301
But man,

2481
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:16,650
I can't do it anymore,

2482
01:04:16,651 --> 01:04:17,340
you know?

2483
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,040
But he knew he needed
somebody to help him.

2484
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:20,610
It was fucked up because it was,

2485
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,580
it's one of those cases where
if somebody worked with him,

2486
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:25,350
he could have sustained it.

2487
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:25,950
You know,

2488
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:30,660
he's a guy who could just come in and
do 10 minute guest spots forever and

2489
01:04:30,661 --> 01:04:31,530
people would love him.

2490
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:31,951
Well,

2491
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:36,951
he opened up for Louie recently in La at
the comedy store when Louie was warming

2492
01:04:37,111 --> 01:04:37,891
up for his,

2493
01:04:37,891 --> 01:04:40,140
a standup special that he filmed there.

2494
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,280
And he was really funny,

2495
01:04:41,281 --> 01:04:41,670
man.

2496
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:42,950
He's got some great one liners.

2497
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:45,300
He's got some killer one had crabs.

2498
01:04:45,301 --> 01:04:46,620
I bought a fishnet stockings.

2499
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:49,870
I'll be over here,

2500
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:51,080
like move the microphone.

2501
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:51,871
He went in on a joke,

2502
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:52,680
didn't go well.

2503
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,860
He's the only guy I know who could
honestly do the same joke twice in,

2504
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,070
in one set because he forgot.

2505
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:01,590
And the crowd would laugh
because everyone knew,

2506
01:05:01,591 --> 01:05:03,090
like he honestly forgot.

2507
01:05:03,091 --> 01:05:04,470
He's already told that joke,

2508
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,570
but they were all nonsequitors.

2509
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:09,060
It was like one after
the other that didn't,

2510
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:10,470
that didn't make sense.

2511
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:11,760
Um,

2512
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:12,870
the Buddy Hackett story,

2513
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,630
if you didn't hear it
was Buddy Hackett and,

2514
01:05:15,631 --> 01:05:16,050
uh,

2515
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:18,160
and Monique and I

2516
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,083
were hosting,

2517
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:19,691
we were the,

2518
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:20,020
uh,

2519
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:22,150
the judges first season
of last comic standing,

2520
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,780
an aunt aunt's killing,

2521
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:26,081
right.

2522
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:26,914
Doing Great.

2523
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:27,830
And uh,

2524
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:31,360
but he does like a George Carlin
joke does a joke from a movie,

2525
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:32,081
does all the shits.

2526
01:05:32,081 --> 01:05:33,040
I compliment them.

2527
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:33,551
I say,

2528
01:05:33,551 --> 01:05:33,761
you're,

2529
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:34,990
you got great energy.

2530
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,130
Your delivery's awesome.

2531
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:37,061
You know,

2532
01:05:37,061 --> 01:05:38,110
he really got a lot of,

2533
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:39,580
there's a lot of charisma,

2534
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:41,230
but I've seen those jokes.

2535
01:05:41,290 --> 01:05:41,951
Like those are jokes.

2536
01:05:41,951 --> 01:05:43,330
Like you did a joke from a movie,

2537
01:05:43,331 --> 01:05:44,470
the movie boiler room,

2538
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,430
which I guess they stole from Jim David,

2539
01:05:48,431 --> 01:05:49,480
who's a comic in New York.

2540
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:51,310
The joke was a,

2541
01:05:51,311 --> 01:05:51,521
you know,

2542
01:05:51,521 --> 01:05:53,050
they should take you guys
to put them on an island.

2543
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:53,531
They did,

2544
01:05:53,531 --> 01:05:54,610
it's called Manhattan.

2545
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:55,270
Okay.

2546
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:55,451
You know,

2547
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,460
like when you say that and you live in La,

2548
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:57,821
like,

2549
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:58,451
come on bitch,

2550
01:05:58,451 --> 01:05:59,740
that ain't your joke right now.

2551
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:00,670
Like this is,

2552
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:02,260
that doesn't even make
any sense out of it yet.

2553
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:03,250
But,

2554
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:03,670
um,

2555
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:04,720
when I said that,

2556
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:05,260
you know,

2557
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:05,591
I said,

2558
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:05,950
look,

2559
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:07,090
a comic is supposed to be,

2560
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:08,030
when you're onstage,

2561
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,370
it's supposed to be your point of view.

2562
01:06:09,371 --> 01:06:10,780
Like that's what
everybody wants to go say.

2563
01:06:10,781 --> 01:06:11,261
They want to see,

2564
01:06:11,261 --> 01:06:12,370
here's the world through your eyes.

2565
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,220
Buddy Hackett just
started screaming at me.

2566
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,190
I ain't never high those jokes,

2567
01:06:17,191 --> 01:06:21,610
but far you'll fucking asshole just
screaming at me because all those old

2568
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:23,950
Vaudeville dudes would all stay all steel,

2569
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:24,850
all of them.

2570
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:28,420
They all would steal each other's shit
and they would go from town to town and

2571
01:06:28,421 --> 01:06:28,691
you know,

2572
01:06:28,691 --> 01:06:32,350
they would do jokes to Jews walking into
a bar and then they would have like a

2573
01:06:32,351 --> 01:06:35,800
little thing that they would
piece together because no
one did television back

2574
01:06:35,801 --> 01:06:36,010
then.

2575
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:37,030
They never did television.

2576
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:37,960
Nobody knew.

2577
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,793
Nobody knew anything.

2578
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:40,210
He just had a bunch of gags.

2579
01:06:40,211 --> 01:06:42,670
It was like your toolbox that you'd
bring with you need to go and do it.

2580
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:43,760
And uh,

2581
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,593
this is the only,

2582
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:45,220
I mean,

2583
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:47,380
we all knew that everyone
knew that as comics.

2584
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:48,100
And you talked to,

2585
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:48,820
Oh guys,

2586
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:49,990
they were alive back then.

2587
01:06:49,991 --> 01:06:51,190
They would always talk about that.

2588
01:06:51,191 --> 01:06:53,020
Like the Milton Berle
thing was the classic one,

2589
01:06:53,021 --> 01:06:53,410
right?

2590
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,270
Milton Berle stalled everybody shit.

2591
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:56,440
But um,

2592
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:56,950
he just,

2593
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:59,740
I just struck a chord and
he was screaming at me,

2594
01:06:59,741 --> 01:07:02,160
you fucking half owl to screaming.

2595
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,220
He had gloves on.

2596
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:06,280
And I remember trying to figure
out what I was going to do.

2597
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:07,210
Like,

2598
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:08,600
am I going to yell back at Buddy Hall?

2599
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:08,861
He's like,

2600
01:07:08,861 --> 01:07:09,850
fucking our buddy,

2601
01:07:09,851 --> 01:07:10,684
a hacker brother.

2602
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:12,730
He's like 80 something years old.

2603
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:15,880
He means it looks like he's on
death's door and he's a legend.

2604
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:16,181
You know,

2605
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:17,830
he's a comedy legend and you know,

2606
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:19,300
and he's screaming at me and I,

2607
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:23,590
and I know why screaming at me and am
I going to say you're just pissed off

2608
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:25,540
because your entire career stole.

2609
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,470
That's what you guys did.

2610
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,290
You guys all still,

2611
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:27,980
you weren't,

2612
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:30,400
you're with standup was back
then is not stand up now.

2613
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:31,000
This is,

2614
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,560
this is all in my mind and I'm not,

2615
01:07:32,561 --> 01:07:33,394
I can't say that.

2616
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:34,091
I just can't say it.

2617
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:34,600
It's not,

2618
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,351
it's not my place.

2619
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:36,190
I'll be crucified.

2620
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:38,080
So I decided to just eat it.

2621
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:39,490
I'm not going to say a word.

2622
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:43,000
So I just sit there while he's screaming
at me and I'm looking at them and I

2623
01:07:43,001 --> 01:07:43,541
don't say a word,

2624
01:07:43,541 --> 01:07:44,800
and I think to myself like,

2625
01:07:44,801 --> 01:07:45,100
God,

2626
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:45,671
did I do the right?

2627
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:45,851
They're like,

2628
01:07:45,851 --> 01:07:46,240
Shit.

2629
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,030
And then fucking Barry came over.

2630
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:49,330
W who I've never liked.

2631
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:50,291
He doesn't like me,

2632
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:51,124
I don't like him.

2633
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:53,980
And he was the producer of the show and
it was that weird controversy where all

2634
01:07:53,981 --> 01:07:55,150
the people that got on the show,

2635
01:07:55,151 --> 01:07:56,350
even though we didn't vote for him,

2636
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:59,080
they wound up getting in
because Barry was managing them.

2637
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:02,350
It was a disaster because he was producing
the show and managing people that

2638
01:08:02,351 --> 01:08:03,070
were on the show.

2639
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:04,300
It was fucking gross.

2640
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,560
That was when drew Carey and Brett
Butler walked off the show in the second

2641
01:08:08,561 --> 01:08:09,200
season.

2642
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,033
Reason.

2643
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,710
I'll talk to you about that.

2644
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:12,401
We'll do that next.

2645
01:08:12,401 --> 01:08:12,580
Yeah.

2646
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,840
So I decide,

2647
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:14,674
I go,

2648
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:15,921
I'm not gonna say anything.

2649
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:17,120
I'm gonna say it and bury him.

2650
01:08:17,121 --> 01:08:17,430
Come,

2651
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:18,263
came over to me.

2652
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:18,970
You know,

2653
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,600
you're such a professional,

2654
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:21,141
you just,

2655
01:08:21,141 --> 01:08:21,381
you,

2656
01:08:21,381 --> 01:08:21,561
you,

2657
01:08:21,561 --> 01:08:21,740
I'm,

2658
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:24,000
I'm really amazed that you just did that.

2659
01:08:24,001 --> 01:08:25,460
And then way you did
and that was beautiful.

2660
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:25,821
You just,

2661
01:08:25,821 --> 01:08:27,150
you just handled it perfect.

2662
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:27,950
Cool.

2663
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:28,401
Thanks.

2664
01:08:28,401 --> 01:08:29,234
Great.

2665
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:29,470
No,

2666
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:29,911
like I'm so,

2667
01:08:29,911 --> 01:08:30,830
I'm thinking to myself,

2668
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:31,100
yeah,

2669
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:31,791
I'm thinking to myself,

2670
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:32,091
Jesus,

2671
01:08:32,091 --> 01:08:33,110
I definitely did the wrong thing.

2672
01:08:33,111 --> 01:08:34,490
If Barry comes over and tells me that,

2673
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:37,731
so I,

2674
01:08:37,731 --> 01:08:38,001
you know,

2675
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:38,834
I just,

2676
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:40,580
and then Monique was like,

2677
01:08:40,581 --> 01:08:41,630
you made those jokes.

2678
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:42,463
You all sugar.

2679
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:44,000
Those are your jokes now.

2680
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:45,020
You made them yours.

2681
01:08:45,021 --> 01:08:45,350
I'm like,

2682
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:46,190
you made them yours.

2683
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,960
It's a fucking George Carlin joke.

2684
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,033
God dammit.

2685
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:52,670
He's doing the choke about George Carlin
talking about how fighters fight for a

2686
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:53,091
person.

2687
01:08:53,091 --> 01:08:53,924
They wear a belt.

2688
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:58,040
That's a Goddamn George Carlin bit and
he's doing this and he's going to do it

2689
01:08:58,041 --> 01:08:58,821
on television.

2690
01:08:58,821 --> 01:08:59,001
I'm like,

2691
01:08:59,001 --> 01:08:59,331
do you know what?

2692
01:08:59,331 --> 01:08:59,750
You're,

2693
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:00,830
what's happening here?

2694
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:01,730
I don't say a word.

2695
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:02,750
I just let it all happen.

2696
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:03,913
And um,

2697
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:04,880
two weeks later,

2698
01:09:04,881 --> 01:09:07,550
Buddy Hackett's dead two weeks.

2699
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:12,670
So his health was so fragile that
him screaming at me at that moment,

2700
01:09:13,611 --> 01:09:15,020
if I screamed back at him,

2701
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:17,690
he could've died on that show.

2702
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:18,051
I mean,

2703
01:09:18,051 --> 01:09:19,640
that's how fragile his health was.

2704
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:20,031
I mean,

2705
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:20,864
he was dead.

2706
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:22,160
I want to say two weeks.

2707
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:23,240
I might be wrong,

2708
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:25,910
but it was no more than
two months and he was dead.

2709
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:28,460
And so I was thinking like
if I yelled at him there,

2710
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:29,171
fuck you,

2711
01:09:29,171 --> 01:09:30,004
you'll cut.

2712
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:32,100
That would be a worst.

2713
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:32,710
Boom.

2714
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:34,390
His heart thing explodes.

2715
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:35,320
Yeah.

2716
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,970
Joe Rogan kills Buddy Hackett.

2717
01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:37,820
Yeah.

2718
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:38,740
Literally killed him.

2719
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,240
Literally killed him.

2720
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:41,930
And this was all,

2721
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:42,800
um,

2722
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,750
I want to say this is
all pre them and see,

2723
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:45,584
I think too,

2724
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:46,700
it was,

2725
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:48,500
it was right when was
the last comic standing?

2726
01:09:48,501 --> 01:09:49,334
What year?

2727
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:51,560
Oh five oh four oh five.

2728
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:54,740
So this was pre cause of them
and see anything was like 2007.

2729
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:55,250
Yeah.

2730
01:09:55,250 --> 01:10:00,250
Well what happened with Brett and a drew
Carey and I always felt that they set

2731
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:01,094
them up,

2732
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:02,090
you know,

2733
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:03,680
kind of set them up for this to happen.

2734
01:10:03,681 --> 01:10:06,470
So we're doing it the semifinals in Vegas,

2735
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:06,801
right?

2736
01:10:06,801 --> 01:10:11,420
There's 20 of us there and 10 of us are
going to go forward into the house and

2737
01:10:11,421 --> 01:10:12,254
do the show.

2738
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:16,280
So it came down to,

2739
01:10:16,281 --> 01:10:17,510
I think it was a,

2740
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,680
I think it was Dan that are
Herman and somebody else.

2741
01:10:21,681 --> 01:10:23,060
It was between the two of them.

2742
01:10:23,061 --> 01:10:24,830
And Nat Herman had had a killer set.

2743
01:10:24,831 --> 01:10:25,664
And I love anatomy.

2744
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:27,110
Anatomy is really funny,

2745
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:32,720
but I think they didn't see
everything that led up to that.

2746
01:10:32,721 --> 01:10:33,381
In other words,

2747
01:10:33,381 --> 01:10:36,320
we had done our auditions
in our various cities.

2748
01:10:36,321 --> 01:10:39,980
We had done New York and they
had us do some shit backstage.

2749
01:10:39,981 --> 01:10:41,570
Like we had a gambling night,

2750
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,370
we had a party and Dan doesn't
really interact like it's,

2751
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:46,821
you know,

2752
01:10:46,821 --> 01:10:47,630
a lot of comics.

2753
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:49,730
You stay to yourself like it's a thing.

2754
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:53,510
And I think all of that made
a difference in them picking.

2755
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:58,040
But they had Brett and drew under the
impression that they were going to pick

2756
01:10:58,041 --> 01:11:02,540
the 10 that went cause like one of the
other comics they picked wasn't going to

2757
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:06,500
get on cause they did the same set at
both auditions and they kill you for that.

2758
01:11:06,501 --> 01:11:06,891
They would like,

2759
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:07,101
look,

2760
01:11:07,101 --> 01:11:10,160
if you don't have two
different three minutes sets,

2761
01:11:10,161 --> 01:11:10,461
you know,

2762
01:11:10,461 --> 01:11:12,110
you're not ready for the show or whatever.

2763
01:11:12,111 --> 01:11:12,780
You know.

2764
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:16,140
So I felt they set uh,

2765
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,161
Brett up.

2766
01:11:17,161 --> 01:11:20,850
Cause I remember when Britain got pissed
and got up out the chair and walked off

2767
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:24,900
because I think we all knew that they
weren't making the final decision.

2768
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:25,591
You know what I mean?

2769
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:28,140
They were like celebrity judges
but they weren't going to,

2770
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:28,890
you know what I mean?

2771
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:29,430
It wasn't,

2772
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:30,480
you weren't really judging,

2773
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:33,840
they didn't take you into consideration
at all producer's decision,

2774
01:11:33,841 --> 01:11:37,320
which is why it was so frustrating for
people when they found out the barrier

2775
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:38,370
was managing people.

2776
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:38,910
Yeah.

2777
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:39,331
That one,

2778
01:11:39,331 --> 01:11:42,270
that one thing I can say
when all that went down,

2779
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:46,680
I had no connection with anybody
cause cause Barry managed some.

2780
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:48,480
And then I'm Ross,

2781
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:49,080
uh,

2782
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,260
Bob and uh,

2783
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,140
Ross from the tonight show,

2784
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:56,910
they had had a management company before
they were scouts for the tonight show.

2785
01:11:57,150 --> 01:12:00,990
And I think one or two of the comics
had been with their management company

2786
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:01,801
back.

2787
01:12:01,801 --> 01:12:02,551
But I was like,

2788
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:03,384
nope,

2789
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,440
check my history.

2790
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:05,363
I got nobody,

2791
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:06,960
no one pulling for me here.

2792
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:10,170
But then I went back a few years later,

2793
01:12:10,171 --> 01:12:12,480
season five and I was one of the judges.

2794
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:16,260
And so now I'm on the other side
of the table and I got to say,

2795
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:17,820
I don't know how it was when you did it.

2796
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,430
They didn't interfere with that.

2797
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:21,240
Like they didn't tell us who they want it,

2798
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:21,841
you know what I mean?

2799
01:12:21,841 --> 01:12:23,040
Like they didn't really,

2800
01:12:23,730 --> 01:12:28,050
the only thing they would tell us
if somebody did that act before,

2801
01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:28,501
you know,

2802
01:12:28,501 --> 01:12:29,071
in other words,

2803
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:34,071
like they tried out with it in oh five
and now they're back in Oh six with the

2804
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:35,004
same act.

2805
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:35,761
Cause they were like,

2806
01:12:35,761 --> 01:12:35,941
no.

2807
01:12:35,941 --> 01:12:38,190
And then there were a couple
of times I'll never forget,

2808
01:12:38,191 --> 01:12:39,120
there was this one,

2809
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:40,650
uh,

2810
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:44,070
this chick had been like Miss New
Jersey or something like that.

2811
01:12:44,071 --> 01:12:46,590
Like she was a beauty queen
and she was hot as hell.

2812
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:48,030
Not Funny at all,

2813
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:50,460
but just fucking amazing to look at.

2814
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:50,791
Right.

2815
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:51,624
So they were like,

2816
01:12:51,670 --> 01:12:52,800
are going to go in the house?

2817
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:53,731
I got to pass it.

2818
01:12:53,731 --> 01:12:53,861
Yeah.

2819
01:12:53,861 --> 01:12:54,211
They were like,

2820
01:12:54,211 --> 01:12:55,100
you got a passer,

2821
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:57,200
you got to bring her back
to the ninth audition.

2822
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:58,043
And we're like,

2823
01:12:58,090 --> 01:12:58,530
like,

2824
01:12:58,530 --> 01:12:58,980
no,

2825
01:12:58,980 --> 01:12:59,520
no.

2826
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,720
Like it's not going to,

2827
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,690
we brought her in when we
were at Gotham's in New York.

2828
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:04,943
Man,

2829
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:09,690
it was the most awkward
silence like her act.

2830
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:13,650
It was like this monologue and
just the crowd was just like,

2831
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,050
it's where it's not even bombing with it.

2832
01:13:16,110 --> 01:13:16,351
Yeah.

2833
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,090
The look on your face right now.

2834
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:19,720
I don't know if there's a camera on you,

2835
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:20,401
but if people,

2836
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:21,510
if you saw the face Joe,

2837
01:13:21,511 --> 01:13:22,344
just me.

2838
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:24,091
That was the whole,

2839
01:13:24,091 --> 01:13:24,331
yeah,

2840
01:13:24,331 --> 01:13:25,164
a lot of that

2841
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:27,511
painful feeling.

2842
01:13:27,511 --> 01:13:28,660
Beautiful little hidden short

2843
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:31,140
hair.

2844
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:32,190
Look at her hair,

2845
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:33,151
you know,

2846
01:13:33,151 --> 01:13:33,984
it was one of those,

2847
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:34,840
one of those,

2848
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:35,700
I have no idea.

2849
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:37,290
What if she got good,

2850
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:38,303
like really good?

2851
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:39,720
Could have maybe.

2852
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:39,990
Yeah,

2853
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:40,561
I don't think so.

2854
01:13:40,561 --> 01:13:41,520
I think she would have,

2855
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:47,040
she had been plucked into the actress
pool if she was funny at all and even

2856
01:13:47,221 --> 01:13:48,180
remotely decent.

2857
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:49,113
Yeah.

2858
01:13:49,890 --> 01:13:50,131
Yeah.

2859
01:13:50,131 --> 01:13:52,740
They didn't tell us anything who
they want and who they didn't,

2860
01:13:52,741 --> 01:13:55,830
but it was real obvious when we all like,

2861
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:58,110
we would talk about it like
before buddy got mad at me,

2862
01:13:59,040 --> 01:13:59,311
you know,

2863
01:13:59,311 --> 01:13:59,791
I like,

2864
01:13:59,791 --> 01:14:00,630
did you guys pick them?

2865
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:01,150
How did,

2866
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:02,010
how did this guy get through?

2867
01:14:02,011 --> 01:14:02,401
Like it was,

2868
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:02,620
it was,

2869
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:02,750
uh,

2870
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:05,400
there was a conversation when we were
trying to figure out how someone got

2871
01:14:05,401 --> 01:14:05,731
through that.

2872
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:07,560
We didn't pick that none of us pick,

2873
01:14:07,561 --> 01:14:08,550
Monique didn't pick him.

2874
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:09,391
That was what it was.

2875
01:14:09,391 --> 01:14:10,470
I don't think I was talking to a buddy.

2876
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:12,580
I think Monique didn't pick
him and I didn't pick them.

2877
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:12,791
I go,

2878
01:14:12,791 --> 01:14:13,870
you didn't pick them down and pick them.

2879
01:14:13,871 --> 01:14:14,200
Right?

2880
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:14,381
It goes,

2881
01:14:14,381 --> 01:14:16,300
well how this guy get through
that doesn't make any sense.

2882
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:17,231
And then there was,

2883
01:14:17,231 --> 01:14:18,064
um,

2884
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:18,641
there was,

2885
01:14:18,641 --> 01:14:19,000
uh,

2886
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,490
the Brett Butler thing and
then we had read that the,

2887
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:27,190
the judges would really just sort of for
show and that really is the producer's

2888
01:14:27,191 --> 01:14:29,070
decision who to get on
and knocking on the shelf.

2889
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:29,680
Ultimately.

2890
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,720
Ultimately it was because part of it,

2891
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:32,583
um,

2892
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,290
like I was talking with Jay,

2893
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:38,800
Katie Anderson about it,

2894
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,480
cause KP was working on a show.

2895
01:14:40,481 --> 01:14:41,590
He was writing for Jay,

2896
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:42,550
right?

2897
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:43,383
And Kp say,

2898
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:43,661
he said,

2899
01:14:43,661 --> 01:14:43,961
you know,

2900
01:14:43,961 --> 01:14:46,960
well part of it is you gotta
have a balance in comics,

2901
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:47,771
right?

2902
01:14:47,771 --> 01:14:52,600
So you can't have like all white guys
are all black guys or is it like they had

2903
01:14:52,601 --> 01:14:54,190
an idea of how many slots,

2904
01:14:54,191 --> 01:14:57,850
cause he told me to think when the
season I went on with Corey Holcomb.

2905
01:14:57,851 --> 01:14:58,121
He said,

2906
01:14:58,121 --> 01:14:58,954
look,

2907
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:01,560
they only thought there'd
be one black comic.

2908
01:15:01,561 --> 01:15:02,320
They were like,

2909
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:07,320
but you and Cory were both so funny and
so completely different that they were

2910
01:15:08,351 --> 01:15:08,951
just like,

2911
01:15:08,951 --> 01:15:09,400
yeah,

2912
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:10,390
bring them both on.

2913
01:15:10,391 --> 01:15:12,070
And then when it came down to,

2914
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,760
there were six of us and fought
going to be five finalists.

2915
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:16,360
Right.

2916
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,840
And me and Cory were both still
in the running and we were like,

2917
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:20,500
all right,

2918
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,580
one of us ain't gonna make it.

2919
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:24,760
Like it ain't gonna be two
brothers in the final five on NBC.

2920
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:25,930
That just ain't going to happen.

2921
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:28,300
So whichever one of us makes it,

2922
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:29,231
we,

2923
01:15:29,231 --> 01:15:29,531
you know,

2924
01:15:29,531 --> 01:15:30,850
we were back the other one,

2925
01:15:30,851 --> 01:15:31,510
you know,

2926
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:32,341
cause we knew,

2927
01:15:32,341 --> 01:15:34,360
we knew that doesn't make any sense.

2928
01:15:34,361 --> 01:15:35,560
If you guys were the two best,

2929
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:37,570
it should be a possibility.

2930
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:38,510
Yes.

2931
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:39,343
Should be.

2932
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:40,811
But it's,

2933
01:15:40,811 --> 01:15:41,111
it's,

2934
01:15:41,111 --> 01:15:42,430
but it's not just that show.

2935
01:15:42,431 --> 01:15:43,001
You know what I mean?

2936
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:43,181
Like,

2937
01:15:43,181 --> 01:15:44,440
that's how TV works.

2938
01:15:44,441 --> 01:15:44,891
Like you,

2939
01:15:44,891 --> 01:15:45,610
you know,

2940
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:49,690
I've always said that like when people
talk about discrimination and TV,

2941
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:51,760
there's definitely discrimination in TV,

2942
01:15:51,761 --> 01:15:52,541
but a lot of it,

2943
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:54,580
but one of the colors they see as green,

2944
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:55,961
you know what I mean?

2945
01:15:55,961 --> 01:15:57,190
And some of the shit they do,

2946
01:15:57,191 --> 01:15:58,510
like when they do stereotypes,

2947
01:15:58,511 --> 01:16:00,070
like we were talking about it earlier,

2948
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,100
you know,

2949
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:05,230
like Friday night I was one
doctor Ken show as a bouncer.

2950
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:06,220
Alright.

2951
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:07,750
I fucking nail bouncer.

2952
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:08,111
All right.

2953
01:16:08,111 --> 01:16:11,240
I've been a bouncer on most
sitcoms in more movies have,

2954
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,010
you know,

2955
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:12,311
could I,

2956
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:13,450
could I get mad and say,

2957
01:16:13,451 --> 01:16:13,631
well,

2958
01:16:13,631 --> 01:16:13,871
you know,

2959
01:16:13,871 --> 01:16:15,220
I can play a professor.

2960
01:16:15,221 --> 01:16:15,811
Yeah I could,

2961
01:16:15,811 --> 01:16:17,650
but I damn sure I could play bouncer.

2962
01:16:17,651 --> 01:16:18,390
You know?

2963
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:20,230
And it's like that's how TV works,

2964
01:16:20,231 --> 01:16:20,441
right?

2965
01:16:20,441 --> 01:16:25,441
Like every hot blonde is dumb on TV and
every Sitcom Dad is a bumbling idiot,

2966
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:27,190
you know?

2967
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:28,140
And it's like that's,

2968
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:28,993
that's how they,

2969
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,820
that's how they play the game.

2970
01:16:30,821 --> 01:16:33,250
So you can get mad at it to an extent.

2971
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:35,020
And I understood like,

2972
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:37,960
like the Emmy speech
that Viola Davis made,

2973
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:38,920
like I get that.

2974
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:39,671
Like she's like,

2975
01:16:39,671 --> 01:16:41,350
if we had more opportunities,

2976
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,940
there would be more black
actresses like me and that,

2977
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:49,260
and I never want to insult people who
act on that level by lumping myself in

2978
01:16:50,621 --> 01:16:51,311
that category.

2979
01:16:51,311 --> 01:16:52,930
Like I'm not an actor like the,

2980
01:16:52,931 --> 01:16:53,710
I am a,

2981
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:55,120
I love playing the bouncer.

2982
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,460
It's easy and I get health insurance,

2983
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:58,750
you know,

2984
01:16:58,750 --> 01:16:59,561
but as a common,

2985
01:16:59,561 --> 01:17:03,550
so you're a professional comics and legit
professional comic and the idea that

2986
01:17:03,551 --> 01:17:04,040
you,

2987
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:06,220
you wouldn't have you and Corey Holcomb,

2988
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:08,350
who's also a legit professional comic.

2989
01:17:08,351 --> 01:17:09,184
Hilarious.

2990
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:09,921
You too.

2991
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:10,581
Hilarious guys.

2992
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:12,320
That it's not possible that
you can get it to the finals.

2993
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:14,090
That's fuck it was possible.

2994
01:17:14,091 --> 01:17:17,960
But we kind of knew he knew of
the possible who you like this,

2995
01:17:17,961 --> 01:17:19,880
this the on UPN.

2996
01:17:20,220 --> 01:17:21,053
We got

2997
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:26,540
the WB on a WB shit.

2998
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:27,100
It would've been,

2999
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:27,590
they would've been,

3000
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:28,130
listen,

3001
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:28,431
listen,

3002
01:17:28,431 --> 01:17:28,930
Mister Hef,

3003
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:29,160
Ron,

3004
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,050
we got to see you later.

3005
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:32,880
Corey got business to take care of.

3006
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:33,321
Well,

3007
01:17:33,321 --> 01:17:33,941
at least half.

3008
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:34,680
Ron's funny.

3009
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:35,720
Heffrons hilarious.

3010
01:17:36,010 --> 01:17:38,960
And after all the dust settled,

3011
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:40,880
like we were all cool with it.

3012
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:41,661
You know what I mean?

3013
01:17:41,661 --> 01:17:42,260
Like it was,

3014
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:45,560
it was what it was and it was
a great shot for all of us.

3015
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,540
But I,

3016
01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:49,340
I liked it better than than I do now.

3017
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,750
I think the show was better when you
had all the reality and all that cause I

3018
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:56,950
think now it's just
straight stand up really.

3019
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:57,351
They just,

3020
01:17:57,351 --> 01:17:57,661
yeah,

3021
01:17:57,661 --> 01:18:02,661
it's like they just get up and do stand
up against each other and America votes.

3022
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:04,430
I don't even know.

3023
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:07,880
America don't even know if America votes
or I don't even know how they do it now

3024
01:18:07,881 --> 01:18:08,241
because we,

3025
01:18:08,241 --> 01:18:08,451
you know,

3026
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:09,081
when we did it,

3027
01:18:09,081 --> 01:18:10,880
they didn't have Twitter
and shit like that.

3028
01:18:10,881 --> 01:18:11,960
So crazy.

3029
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,170
I didn't lie.

3030
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:18,170
I did it when we had my space and I had
a girlfriend who would get mad at me

3031
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:23,540
because of things chicks would post
on my space after they saw me on TV.

3032
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:27,140
I got no control over this.

3033
01:18:27,141 --> 01:18:28,370
She would get mad at you for things.

3034
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:29,420
Other people posted it.

3035
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:30,254
She gets,

3036
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:30,981
she never,

3037
01:18:30,981 --> 01:18:33,980
she was never able to adjust to TV.

3038
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:35,181
But you know,

3039
01:18:35,181 --> 01:18:35,490
the,

3040
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:36,020
the,

3041
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:36,853
the,

3042
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:41,270
cause you know how TV is like pretty
women are like a decoration on TV,

3043
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:42,291
you know what I mean?

3044
01:18:42,291 --> 01:18:43,700
They're always around.

3045
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:45,650
And whenever there's an event,

3046
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:49,160
there's hot chicks there that nobody
really knows how they got there.

3047
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:50,061
You know what I mean?

3048
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:50,840
Like,

3049
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,670
I don't know who invited them or what.

3050
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:53,950
They're just here but that,

3051
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:54,860
but that's how it is.

3052
01:18:54,861 --> 01:18:55,001
It's,

3053
01:18:55,001 --> 01:18:56,450
it's always like that.

3054
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,030
And she was never comfortable with that.

3055
01:18:59,031 --> 01:18:59,571
And I was like,

3056
01:18:59,571 --> 01:18:59,781
look,

3057
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:00,950
if they're going to fuck anybody,

3058
01:19:00,951 --> 01:19:02,060
they're going to fuck a producer.

3059
01:19:02,061 --> 01:19:03,170
Like they know,

3060
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:05,300
they know how this game works.

3061
01:19:05,301 --> 01:19:08,540
They know they only going to get so
far fucking the winner of last comic

3062
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:11,510
standing that that's not a career.

3063
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:12,800
You might be a step though.

3064
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,120
I might be a stepping stone.

3065
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:17,240
So at best to get you across the creek,

3066
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:22,130
I might be able to get you backstage
where you could meet somebody,

3067
01:19:22,131 --> 01:19:22,551
you know?

3068
01:19:22,551 --> 01:19:22,881
But,

3069
01:19:22,881 --> 01:19:23,600
um,

3070
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:23,841
yeah,

3071
01:19:23,841 --> 01:19:24,260
she was,

3072
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:24,771
she never,

3073
01:19:24,771 --> 01:19:25,490
and she was hot,

3074
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:25,791
you know,

3075
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:27,560
but she never couldn't handle it,

3076
01:19:27,561 --> 01:19:27,831
couldn't,

3077
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:28,760
couldn't get used to it.

3078
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:29,391
There's,

3079
01:19:29,391 --> 01:19:29,690
um,

3080
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:30,800
there's some of those things,

3081
01:19:30,801 --> 01:19:34,430
some of those events where they bring
in girls and I knew girls that would get

3082
01:19:34,431 --> 01:19:35,264
hired,

3083
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:36,410
they would literally get hired.

3084
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:40,580
They'd get paid like 1000 bucks to go
to these events and parties and mingle

3085
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:41,500
cause they want to just be,

3086
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,531
that's what I'm saying,

3087
01:19:42,531 --> 01:19:45,080
it's just filled with hot
chicks but they're not like,

3088
01:19:45,081 --> 01:19:46,970
I used to always say they're not real.

3089
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:49,760
They're just here like not
meaning they're not real.

3090
01:19:49,761 --> 01:19:50,511
They're real people.

3091
01:19:50,511 --> 01:19:54,590
I'm sure they have a life and stuff but
in this atmosphere they're here to make

3092
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:55,580
this room look good.

3093
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:56,360
They're here too.

3094
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:57,193
They're also here.

3095
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:00,920
They also here to find some sort of a
producer that might be able to take care

3096
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:01,220
of them.

3097
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:03,620
There's a lot of that plus comp coyotes,

3098
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:04,741
bless him if you,

3099
01:20:04,741 --> 01:20:05,380
you know,

3100
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:06,830
they would find this to make it work.

3101
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:12,050
Some chubby Jewish dude and just start
working them a close it my friend and one

3102
01:20:12,211 --> 01:20:15,780
of my favorite comics met cause
then I got my own problems.

3103
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:21,270
Me and Matt be on the road and he'd say
that a hundred times whenever you read

3104
01:20:21,271 --> 01:20:22,140
something in the paper,

3105
01:20:22,141 --> 01:20:22,951
like some guy,

3106
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:23,670
you know,

3107
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:24,271
Tornado,

3108
01:20:24,271 --> 01:20:26,340
bluish trailer away in his dog died,

3109
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:26,680
man.

3110
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:26,970
I was like,

3111
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:27,660
yeah,

3112
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:28,493
I got,

3113
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:31,171
yeah,

3114
01:20:31,171 --> 01:20:34,530
you can concentrate on other people's
problems way too long and you get lost.

3115
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:35,790
You lose yourself.

3116
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:36,870
It's cheese to eat that.

3117
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:38,970
That's the other thing about social media.

3118
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,210
It's too easy to get caught up in nonsense
that really shouldn't affect you at

3119
01:20:42,211 --> 01:20:42,480
all.

3120
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:42,900
Yeah.

3121
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:47,060
And some people do more than like,

3122
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,480
like it's unreasonable.

3123
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:48,781
Like,

3124
01:20:48,781 --> 01:20:49,081
okay,

3125
01:20:49,081 --> 01:20:52,530
we can't save everyone from everything.

3126
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,870
Like in a perfect world we could,

3127
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,220
but no,

3128
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:57,061
the world's not perfect.

3129
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:57,430
Yeah.

3130
01:20:57,430 --> 01:20:57,650
And,

3131
01:20:57,650 --> 01:20:58,201
and you know,

3132
01:20:58,201 --> 01:21:01,690
and it's the same way with Hollywood
and show business like you,

3133
01:21:01,950 --> 01:21:04,080
you have to remember this shit ain't real.

3134
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:05,071
You know,

3135
01:21:05,071 --> 01:21:06,300
it is on some level,

3136
01:21:06,301 --> 01:21:10,320
but a lot of it is just glamorous and
they treat you good and they love you.

3137
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:10,950
And they,

3138
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:11,400
I,

3139
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,000
I think,

3140
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,380
I think what helped me was the fact that
I worked in the real world before I got

3141
01:21:16,381 --> 01:21:19,800
into this because I remember my first job,

3142
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:24,870
I was a truck driver for the show power
rangers for the kid show and I'd never

3143
01:21:24,871 --> 01:21:27,330
worked in TV and I didn't
know anything about it.

3144
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:32,220
And we go and there's breakfast and
then there's lunch and I'm like,

3145
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,054
what the fuck?

3146
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,511
And,

3147
01:21:34,511 --> 01:21:34,981
and you know,

3148
01:21:34,981 --> 01:21:35,760
I'm hearing,

3149
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,770
I'm hearing someone complained
and I wanted to say,

3150
01:21:37,771 --> 01:21:38,071
you know,

3151
01:21:38,071 --> 01:21:39,090
in the real world,

3152
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,440
you've got to get your own food.

3153
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:44,580
They feed you every day.

3154
01:21:44,581 --> 01:21:49,581
You might want to show a little gratitude
when you're on the power rangers.

3155
01:21:49,591 --> 01:21:50,580
You wish you were on friends.

3156
01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:52,380
It's just how it is.

3157
01:21:52,381 --> 01:21:53,880
Everybody always wants better.

3158
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:54,990
No one's ever happy.

3159
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:56,190
There's always a bigger,

3160
01:21:56,191 --> 01:21:57,570
better deal around the corner.

3161
01:21:58,110 --> 01:21:58,950
I had fun with that,

3162
01:21:58,951 --> 01:22:00,810
showed that that show was actually,

3163
01:22:00,811 --> 01:22:03,180
that's where I learned
everything about TV.

3164
01:22:03,181 --> 01:22:04,380
Like I learned to whatever,

3165
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:04,831
you know,

3166
01:22:04,831 --> 01:22:07,590
I learned what the best boy
is and what the key grip.

3167
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:09,420
Like you see all those
titles and you're like,

3168
01:22:09,421 --> 01:22:10,980
what the hell is that?

3169
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,500
And that's where I learned
who all those people are.

3170
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:18,270
I learned what upstage Matt while
I was on a television show told me,

3171
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:19,640
could you move upstage?

3172
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:20,483
I go,

3173
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:21,503
which way is that?

3174
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,860
Which way's upstage?

3175
01:22:23,870 --> 01:22:24,330
It's off.

3176
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:25,163
And you know they were,

3177
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:26,250
they were a bunch of people.

3178
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:27,210
Oh Geez,

3179
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:28,500
fuck did he get here?

3180
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,770
And Comics Mad.

3181
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:30,871
They were mad to,

3182
01:22:30,871 --> 01:22:32,070
I worked with some actress.

3183
01:22:32,071 --> 01:22:34,890
It really didn't like the fact that I
had never really done any acting before.

3184
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:36,330
And then it was easy.

3185
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,171
It's not that hard,

3186
01:22:37,171 --> 01:22:38,730
but upstage the way it used to be.

3187
01:22:38,731 --> 01:22:39,750
And those Victorians,

3188
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:41,250
Shakespearian stages,

3189
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:41,881
it was a,

3190
01:22:41,881 --> 01:22:42,750
a ramp,

3191
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:44,910
like the stage was not flat.

3192
01:22:45,150 --> 01:22:47,610
It was like it was elevated in the back.

3193
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:52,030
And the idea being that you could see it
through the entire complex as they move

3194
01:22:52,031 --> 01:22:54,000
to the back of the stage upstage.

3195
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,840
You could see in the back right there,

3196
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:58,800
otherwise the ramp so
everyone could see it.

3197
01:22:58,830 --> 01:22:59,161
Then they just,

3198
01:22:59,161 --> 01:23:01,170
they were flat figured out,

3199
01:23:01,171 --> 01:23:01,351
Hey,

3200
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:01,861
wait a minute.

3201
01:23:01,861 --> 01:23:03,840
If we put the seats in a ramp,

3202
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:06,690
we can make the stage floods.

3203
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:10,030
One of those great moments in
theater that nobody got credit for,

3204
01:23:10,031 --> 01:23:11,560
that the guy who said,

3205
01:23:11,561 --> 01:23:12,220
hey man,

3206
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:16,960
how about if we put the seats up hill
and we can keep the stage each flat.

3207
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:24,760
So I'm going to tell you my great Joe
Rogan story cause I don't know if you

3208
01:23:24,761 --> 01:23:25,930
remember this story.

3209
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:28,240
I will always remember this story.

3210
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:28,901
This,

3211
01:23:28,901 --> 01:23:29,531
this was,

3212
01:23:29,531 --> 01:23:29,890
no,

3213
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:34,630
this was a great that this is
my second year at Montreal.

3214
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:38,680
I had gone once and I had
done new faces and then um,

3215
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,753
you know,

3216
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:41,530
just doing whatever.

3217
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:44,990
It was great for me and that's
when I became a comic fulltime,

3218
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:45,701
Blah Blah Blah.

3219
01:23:45,701 --> 01:23:46,300
And you know,

3220
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:51,300
so I come back the next year and I bumped
into you and I think you were either

3221
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:56,290
your still on news radio or you had just
finished news radio or something like

3222
01:23:56,291 --> 01:23:56,620
that.

3223
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:57,340
What year was it?

3224
01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:00,340
This 99 98 yeah,

3225
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:00,640
probably.

3226
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,990
He's probably on it still.

3227
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:07,080
I think it ended at nine nine and then
Kevin James showed up and I think Kevin's

3228
01:24:07,091 --> 01:24:10,180
show was about to hit or it
just hit or something like that.

3229
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:12,190
And you grabbed me and you're like,

3230
01:24:12,191 --> 01:24:12,521
come on,

3231
01:24:12,521 --> 01:24:13,600
we're doing spots.

3232
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:16,060
And I rode around in a cab.

3233
01:24:16,061 --> 01:24:21,061
What you and Kevin James crashing stages
and now I'm just coming off new faces.

3234
01:24:21,581 --> 01:24:22,271
So I'm like,

3235
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:22,991
what the fuck?

3236
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:25,630
I'm hanging out with Joe
Rogan and Kevin James.

3237
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:27,400
I'm a fucking comic now.

3238
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:33,820
I'll always remember that man that
was so fucking cool at that time.

3239
01:24:33,821 --> 01:24:36,340
Cause you knew me from the
laugh factory but it wasn't,

3240
01:24:36,341 --> 01:24:37,010
but you know what it,

3241
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:37,541
you know what I mean?

3242
01:24:37,541 --> 01:24:42,100
Like you guys were both on sitcoms and
you'll recognize everywhere you walk in

3243
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:42,934
and I'm just this,

3244
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:44,110
that their security.

3245
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:44,750
Nice fun

3246
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:45,583
comic.

3247
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,461
I remember that.

3248
01:24:47,461 --> 01:24:48,061
I remember being,

3249
01:24:48,061 --> 01:24:49,430
I remember driving around with you,

3250
01:24:49,431 --> 01:24:50,264
but to me,

3251
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:53,160
I mean I never wanted to be on TV,

3252
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:53,491
you know?

3253
01:24:53,491 --> 01:24:54,960
So being on TV was just something like,

3254
01:24:54,961 --> 01:24:55,321
Whoa,

3255
01:24:55,321 --> 01:24:55,740
okay,

3256
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:56,400
I'll do that.

3257
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,210
That's a lot of money.

3258
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:57,541
Yeah.

3259
01:24:57,541 --> 01:24:57,811
All right.

3260
01:24:57,811 --> 01:24:58,644
I'm on TV.

3261
01:24:58,770 --> 01:25:03,660
But any moment while I was on t stand up
when I was on TV rather I was thinking

3262
01:25:03,661 --> 01:25:06,300
this is going to end and I'm gonna
go right back to being a stand up.

3263
01:25:06,370 --> 01:25:07,860
I always thought of myself as a standup.

3264
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:09,150
Yeah.

3265
01:25:09,150 --> 01:25:10,320
I love being a standup.

3266
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:11,660
You know it's,

3267
01:25:11,670 --> 01:25:15,750
I mean I would love that everyone
would love that hit TV thing.

3268
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,260
Yeah.

3269
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:17,610
That's the lottery payoff,

3270
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:17,881
right?

3271
01:25:17,881 --> 01:25:19,290
When you get one of those and you,

3272
01:25:19,291 --> 01:25:20,070
you know,

3273
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:21,000
make a ton of money.

3274
01:25:21,001 --> 01:25:24,720
But there's nothing
like being on stage and,

3275
01:25:24,730 --> 01:25:25,190
and the,

3276
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:29,280
and the other thing I've always loved
is the respect of the good comics.

3277
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:31,860
That's everything that's ever when,

3278
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:32,250
when the,

3279
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:33,061
when the good ones,

3280
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:33,900
when the pros,

3281
01:25:33,901 --> 01:25:34,660
the masters,

3282
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:35,550
whatever you want to call it,

3283
01:25:35,551 --> 01:25:36,470
when Hitler and,

3284
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:36,900
and you,

3285
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:37,381
you know,

3286
01:25:37,381 --> 01:25:37,951
you got it.

3287
01:25:37,951 --> 01:25:39,960
Cause they just treat you
like you're one of them.

3288
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,540
You know that that was always the thing.

3289
01:25:42,541 --> 01:25:43,590
When they talk to you,

3290
01:25:43,591 --> 01:25:44,520
they treat you like you're like,

3291
01:25:44,540 --> 01:25:45,030
okay.

3292
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:45,271
Yeah.

3293
01:25:45,271 --> 01:25:45,860
I mean,

3294
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:46,101
dude,

3295
01:25:46,101 --> 01:25:51,101
I was in the parking lot of the comedy
store in like 94 or something like that.

3296
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:52,940
And Damon Wayans,

3297
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,050
he had seen me on stage
and he looked at me,

3298
01:25:55,051 --> 01:25:55,580
he goes,

3299
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:57,260
you a funny motherfucker.

3300
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,780
Funny motherfucker.

3301
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:00,920
God Damn,

3302
01:26:00,921 --> 01:26:01,754
that was funny.

3303
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:03,950
And I remember like my whole was tingling.

3304
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:04,420
It was like,

3305
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:05,360
Ooh,

3306
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:07,790
Damon Wayans had that.

3307
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:09,560
Like to me that was like just the most,

3308
01:26:09,561 --> 01:26:11,630
like the most elevating thing
that could've ever happened.

3309
01:26:11,631 --> 01:26:11,871
I was like,

3310
01:26:11,871 --> 01:26:12,561
Holy Shit,

3311
01:26:12,561 --> 01:26:13,810
I'm legit now.

3312
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:14,810
Can you leave this?

3313
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:17,420
And then you become that guy crazy.

3314
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:17,871
You know,

3315
01:26:17,871 --> 01:26:19,520
like in the past five years,

3316
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:21,110
I've definitely become the old guy,

3317
01:26:21,690 --> 01:26:22,280
black guy.

3318
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,900
There's so many young comics.

3319
01:26:23,901 --> 01:26:24,170
I mean,

3320
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:24,651
oh man,

3321
01:26:24,651 --> 01:26:26,600
I was watching you and oh man,

3322
01:26:26,601 --> 01:26:27,321
just talking to you.

3323
01:26:27,321 --> 01:26:27,921
I'm learning.

3324
01:26:27,921 --> 01:26:28,371
And I'm like,

3325
01:26:28,371 --> 01:26:28,431
yeah,

3326
01:26:28,431 --> 01:26:29,264
I got you.

3327
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:32,510
Cause I remember like
George Wallace was my guy.

3328
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:35,810
Like I used to see George at the laugh
factory and I talked to him and this or

3329
01:26:35,811 --> 01:26:36,051
that.

3330
01:26:36,051 --> 01:26:37,700
And he's still fucks with me about it.

3331
01:26:37,701 --> 01:26:38,511
Like we were in Vegas,

3332
01:26:38,511 --> 01:26:39,470
we were having lunch or something.

3333
01:26:39,471 --> 01:26:39,681
He's like,

3334
01:26:39,681 --> 01:26:39,861
yeah,

3335
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:40,400
there's a lot.

3336
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,230
So just sitting around
waiting for me to die.

3337
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:43,310
I was like,

3338
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:44,210
Damn Right George.

3339
01:26:44,390 --> 01:26:48,530
I take over this whole
Las Vegas operation.

3340
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:53,330
He hated that operation man toward the
end I talked more about it at the comedy

3341
01:26:53,331 --> 01:26:53,931
Magic Club.

3342
01:26:53,931 --> 01:26:57,080
He came back backstage and I was there
and we were hanging out and talking and

3343
01:26:57,081 --> 01:26:57,740
he said it.

3344
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:58,071
He goes,

3345
01:26:58,071 --> 01:26:59,000
it is not easy.

3346
01:26:59,060 --> 01:26:59,930
He said it was hard.

3347
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:01,700
You know why they for Wallet?

3348
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:05,720
Because he had a pay for everything to
promote it because he was going up again.

3349
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:08,210
He said the reason he stopped
doing it because other clubs,

3350
01:27:08,211 --> 01:27:09,500
they were giving it away free,

3351
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:14,450
so he's four wall and then trying to sell
tickets when they're giving away free

3352
01:27:14,451 --> 01:27:19,451
tickets to so and so show because
they're backed by the casino and he said

3353
01:27:20,211 --> 01:27:22,340
that's why he said you just
got to where you couldn't.

3354
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:24,590
You can't compete with free also.

3355
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,190
Then you got to go on the road and you
haven't really established yourself on

3356
01:27:28,191 --> 01:27:32,780
the road and decades because all this
time he's been in Vegas doing this one

3357
01:27:32,781 --> 01:27:33,614
place,

3358
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:36,020
just trying to pack this one
place with people out of town.

3359
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:37,130
So he's got the billboards,

3360
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:37,991
he's got the,

3361
01:27:37,991 --> 01:27:38,191
the,

3362
01:27:38,191 --> 01:27:40,820
the things on top of the cabs
and all that shit and he's,

3363
01:27:40,821 --> 01:27:42,020
he's got a good hustle.

3364
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:43,790
I'd keeping it together in Vegas,

3365
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:45,950
but that shit doesn't mean
anything when you go to Philly.

3366
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:46,670
No,

3367
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:48,320
the people that haven't gone to Vegas,

3368
01:27:48,321 --> 01:27:49,160
they're like George who?

3369
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:50,030
George Wallace.

3370
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:50,311
Oh yeah,

3371
01:27:50,311 --> 01:27:51,144
I remember that guy.

3372
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:52,063
They're not going to come.

3373
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:52,290
They're,

3374
01:27:52,290 --> 01:27:52,690
we're not going to cut.

3375
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:54,210
They don't know what's better there.

3376
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:55,670
Was he on comedy central last year?

3377
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:56,361
You know,

3378
01:27:56,361 --> 01:27:57,830
w when was the last
time you had a special,

3379
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:59,280
that's always been my weakest thing.

3380
01:27:59,281 --> 01:28:00,590
I never been great at marketing.

3381
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:02,083
It's hard.

3382
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:02,810
Marketing.

3383
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:04,070
Marketing's a tough Gig,

3384
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:05,020
but he,

3385
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,290
he had a great run in Vegas,

3386
01:28:07,291 --> 01:28:09,960
so for a long time he
had a great run there.

3387
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:11,503
I think nine.

3388
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:12,340
Yeah,

3389
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:13,220
I think nine years.

3390
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:16,940
But I talked to another guy who had
one of those shows and he told me,

3391
01:28:16,941 --> 01:28:17,211
he said,

3392
01:28:17,211 --> 01:28:18,044
man,

3393
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:19,880
you said you'd see them taxis.

3394
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:20,960
I get a bill for that.

3395
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:22,100
Like every month,

3396
01:28:22,190 --> 01:28:23,960
like the casino gives me a bill.

3397
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:25,183
The Casino?

3398
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:25,841
Yeah.

3399
01:28:25,841 --> 01:28:30,841
Cause the casino puts up the money to
put your picture on top of a hundred taxi

3400
01:28:30,951 --> 01:28:31,784
cabs,

3401
01:28:31,970 --> 01:28:32,803
you know,

3402
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:36,950
and then at the end of the month you get
a bill for that or they take it out of

3403
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:39,170
what you've made in the box office.

3404
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:39,920
Wow.

3405
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:40,430
Yeah.

3406
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:40,821
So it,

3407
01:28:40,821 --> 01:28:41,061
yeah,

3408
01:28:41,061 --> 01:28:41,850
it's a tough,

3409
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:42,170
it's a,

3410
01:28:42,170 --> 01:28:43,040
unless you're,

3411
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:45,680
unless you're a big name,

3412
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:46,071
you know,

3413
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:48,770
unless you're one of those
big Vegas shows going in,

3414
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:51,500
but you have to be like Hosni
spears or something like that.

3415
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:54,290
Like I never hear about a
comic having a big name.

3416
01:28:54,291 --> 01:28:57,170
Like I guess carrot top he does well,

3417
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,150
he's more of a variety show.

3418
01:28:59,151 --> 01:29:00,620
I mean he's a comic for sure,

3419
01:29:00,621 --> 01:29:05,190
but he's more of a variety show because
he's got the props and he's been in

3420
01:29:05,191 --> 01:29:06,240
Vegas long enough.

3421
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,410
Like he's built,

3422
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:09,390
he's built a show there.

3423
01:29:09,420 --> 01:29:10,081
You know what I mean?

3424
01:29:10,081 --> 01:29:11,310
Like people know him.

3425
01:29:11,311 --> 01:29:13,680
It's Kinda like Siegfried
and Roy type thing.

3426
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:16,350
Like carrot top is a Vegas show.

3427
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:17,130
Yeah.

3428
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:17,370
He,

3429
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:18,360
how long has he been in there?

3430
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,410
I have no idea.

3431
01:29:19,411 --> 01:29:20,240
Probably like 10 years.

3432
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,840
He's been there longer than George.

3433
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:24,300
So does no one else though.

3434
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:24,840
I mean,

3435
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:25,673
what's her name?

3436
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:26,970
Rita Rudner was there.

3437
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:27,600
Rita Rudner.

3438
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:28,650
Louie Anderson.

3439
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:29,701
Oh yeah,

3440
01:29:29,701 --> 01:29:30,110
Louie.

3441
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:31,230
I had a show there.

3442
01:29:31,710 --> 01:29:32,790
I didn't remember his.

3443
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:33,713
And um,

3444
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:37,260
who else didn't Eddie Griffin do something
there for why I think Eddie Griffin

3445
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:39,290
still has a thing like,

3446
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:39,541
yeah,

3447
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:40,374
but it's not,

3448
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:41,310
it's not all week.

3449
01:29:41,311 --> 01:29:43,480
It's like weeknights.

3450
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:45,450
That's a weird thing.

3451
01:29:45,451 --> 01:29:47,100
It's like a Monday or Tuesday,

3452
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:48,210
Monday and Tuesday night
or something like that.

3453
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:49,290
Yeah.

3454
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:51,030
I've always wondered
what that would be like.

3455
01:29:51,031 --> 01:29:53,760
Like there was one time we
were negotiating to do a,

3456
01:29:53,761 --> 01:29:54,480
uh,

3457
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:59,250
they wanted to do a reality stars
thing in Vegas so they'd have like,

3458
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:03,000
like I was going to host it because I won
last comic standing and then they were

3459
01:30:03,001 --> 01:30:05,190
going to have like the winner
of the country singing.

3460
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:06,570
Like they couldn't get the big,

3461
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:07,080
you know,

3462
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,240
the American idol winners
and stuff like that,

3463
01:30:09,241 --> 01:30:14,241
but it was all the second tier reality
shows like the winter to country music

3464
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:19,620
singing show and the winter of this
that there's some show on country music

3465
01:30:19,621 --> 01:30:20,790
tells me like American idol,

3466
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,460
but for country singers and Ma,

3467
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:26,250
I probably get to 20 million people to
watch it and they wanted all of us to do

3468
01:30:26,251 --> 01:30:31,080
a show and I had hoped it went because
I wanted to see what it would be like to

3469
01:30:31,081 --> 01:30:35,430
just be on a Vegas show for like to
live in Vegas and work in Vegas for six

3470
01:30:35,431 --> 01:30:35,880
months.

3471
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:36,750
You had a,

3472
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:38,070
you could go crazy things,

3473
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:42,210
so I think you'd go crazy and I think
your world would get very weird.

3474
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:44,520
I think your world gets
weird if you live there.

3475
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:48,660
I think there's something strange
about being in the city that is a,

3476
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:50,070
I love Vegas,

3477
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:51,330
I love working there.

3478
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:52,830
I love doing the UFC there,

3479
01:30:52,831 --> 01:30:54,360
but I love getting the fuck out of there.

3480
01:30:54,361 --> 01:30:58,410
Just as much as I love getting in there
a week is pretty much as much Vegas as

3481
01:30:58,411 --> 01:30:59,000
you can.

3482
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Never even do a week.

3483
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:01,110
I do two days,

3484
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,590
that's all I've ever done and even
two days when Sunday rolls around,

3485
01:31:04,591 --> 01:31:07,930
I take the fucking 6:00
AM and I'm not kidding.

3486
01:31:07,931 --> 01:31:08,271
I've,

3487
01:31:08,271 --> 01:31:08,520
I've,

3488
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,680
I've stayed up all night and I say,

3489
01:31:10,681 --> 01:31:10,980
well,

3490
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:13,770
I'm just going to have a fucking red
ball and play with my kids on Sunday

3491
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:13,980
morning.

3492
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:14,140
I'm,

3493
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:14,610
I'm gonna,

3494
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:15,510
I'm gonna stay awake.

3495
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:16,291
Fuck this.

3496
01:31:16,291 --> 01:31:17,101
I'm getting out of here.

3497
01:31:17,101 --> 01:31:19,570
I'm not taking something new
and flight or 1:00 PM flight in.

3498
01:31:19,571 --> 01:31:21,990
The last thing you want
to do is try to drive.

3499
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:22,670
Yeah.

3500
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:23,760
He tried out on the weekend.

3501
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:25,230
If you're going to drive that a Vegas,

3502
01:31:25,231 --> 01:31:30,231
you better leave at Saturday night at
5:00 AM you got to do it because otherwise

3503
01:31:30,871 --> 01:31:31,920
it's going to take forever.

3504
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:32,461
I know people,

3505
01:31:32,461 --> 01:31:32,971
let's take eight,

3506
01:31:32,971 --> 01:31:34,650
nine hours when I go,

3507
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:35,700
when I do a club,

3508
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:37,083
Jamie,

3509
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,040
oh hang out.

3510
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,870
I don't hang out on the strip.

3511
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:41,040
Like I like,

3512
01:31:41,041 --> 01:31:45,510
I'll go to a gym somewhere off the strip
and I'll go eat somewhere off the strip

3513
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:48,300
and then you're there at
night and that's okay.

3514
01:31:48,301 --> 01:31:48,590
But,

3515
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:49,470
but the idea,

3516
01:31:49,530 --> 01:31:50,780
and I'm not a Gambler,

3517
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:54,030
like the idea of just
being in that casino,

3518
01:31:54,031 --> 01:31:56,640
doing that for a week,

3519
01:31:57,590 --> 01:31:57,980
but I,

3520
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:00,130
but I've talked to people who
work there and they're like,

3521
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:00,361
you,

3522
01:32:00,361 --> 01:32:00,971
if you work here,

3523
01:32:00,971 --> 01:32:02,380
you don't even hear the bells.

3524
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:04,330
Like they walk to the state,

3525
01:32:04,331 --> 01:32:04,891
you know what I mean?

3526
01:32:04,891 --> 01:32:05,150
Yeah.

3527
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:07,180
But they go on stage,

3528
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,620
go on stage,

3529
01:32:08,621 --> 01:32:09,311
do your show,

3530
01:32:09,311 --> 01:32:09,761
leave,

3531
01:32:09,761 --> 01:32:10,510
go home.

3532
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:13,600
You live somewhere else away
from the Strip and recommends,

3533
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:14,261
well,

3534
01:32:14,261 --> 01:32:15,550
I know people that live in Henderson,

3535
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:17,680
like my buddy Max lives in Henderson,

3536
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:19,750
like see no nice suburb.

3537
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:20,843
He loves it.

3538
01:32:20,890 --> 01:32:21,320
And now he,

3539
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:21,611
he,

3540
01:32:21,611 --> 01:32:22,930
he's a professional pool player,

3541
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:27,580
a lot of pool action in Vegas and there's
a lot of people that live outside of

3542
01:32:27,581 --> 01:32:28,060
it that,

3543
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:29,080
that really like it,

3544
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:29,621
you know?

3545
01:32:29,621 --> 01:32:30,090
But like,

3546
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:30,390
uh,

3547
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:31,010
I dunno if you know,

3548
01:32:31,010 --> 01:32:32,050
do you know Matt King?

3549
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:34,000
Matt King now Mac does it.

3550
01:32:34,001 --> 01:32:35,470
He's a magician.

3551
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:37,840
He has like an afternoon show.

3552
01:32:37,841 --> 01:32:38,890
I think it Harris,

3553
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:42,040
but he's been there like he just
sold his 2 million at the ticket.

3554
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:43,570
Like he's been there forever.

3555
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:46,480
It's his gig and he loves it and he,

3556
01:32:46,481 --> 01:32:46,751
you know,

3557
01:32:46,751 --> 01:32:50,680
it's like a one hour show at like four
in the afternoon for the whole family.

3558
01:32:50,681 --> 01:32:51,330
It's like,

3559
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:52,163
okay.

3560
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:53,223
And he loves it.

3561
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:53,800
Yeah.

3562
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:55,210
And he's been there

3563
01:32:57,130 --> 01:32:58,120
15 years.

3564
01:32:58,150 --> 01:32:58,331
Well,

3565
01:32:58,331 --> 01:33:00,910
if you had to choose to Chine living
in Vegas and living in Toledo,

3566
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:03,970
I'll take the fucking Vegas
every God Damn Day of the week.

3567
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:05,260
No offense to Lido,

3568
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:06,550
but you know what the fuck I'm saying.

3569
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:11,740
I think there's something weird though
about living in a city that is the place

3570
01:33:11,741 --> 01:33:13,210
that people go to get crazy.

3571
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:13,961
Yeah,

3572
01:33:13,961 --> 01:33:15,000
well you have to get away.

3573
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:15,923
That's why you can't,

3574
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:20,200
I don't know anyone who lives there who
goes to the strip on a regular basis.

3575
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:21,310
Yeah.

3576
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:23,050
Anyone I know who lives in Vegas,

3577
01:33:23,051 --> 01:33:23,530
they're like,

3578
01:33:23,530 --> 01:33:23,890
yeah,

3579
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:24,191
I'll go.

3580
01:33:24,191 --> 01:33:28,270
Occasionally there's a show they'll
go to or they'll take their friends,

3581
01:33:28,271 --> 01:33:29,590
their when their friends visit,

3582
01:33:29,591 --> 01:33:32,380
but otherwise they just
don't go to the strip.

3583
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,960
Have you ever been to that
bar on the top of Vegas?

3584
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:36,090
The top of a,

3585
01:33:36,100 --> 01:33:37,720
the men as it Mandalay Bay,

3586
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:39,610
I think it's Mandalay bay.

3587
01:33:39,611 --> 01:33:44,611
The bar at the top or it looks out over
like it's like the most or something

3588
01:33:45,041 --> 01:33:45,401
like that.

3589
01:33:45,401 --> 01:33:45,990
Yeah,

3590
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:46,823
it's insane.

3591
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:47,241
And you,

3592
01:33:47,241 --> 01:33:47,411
you,

3593
01:33:47,411 --> 01:33:51,280
you get up there and you look out at
all that neon and all that craziness.

3594
01:33:51,281 --> 01:33:55,660
And it literally is like an image of
the future from a science fiction movie.

3595
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:59,320
Like if you were in the
1920s or something like that.

3596
01:33:59,321 --> 01:33:59,760
And,

3597
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,120
and people like imagine,

3598
01:34:01,121 --> 01:34:03,580
what do you think it's going
to be like in 2015 well,

3599
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:05,590
this is what they would probably imagine.

3600
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:06,191
See,

3601
01:34:06,191 --> 01:34:07,630
the thing I love about Vegas,

3602
01:34:07,631 --> 01:34:09,910
and I've always said if somebody
came from another country,

3603
01:34:09,911 --> 01:34:10,211
they're like,

3604
01:34:10,211 --> 01:34:11,140
I want to see America.

3605
01:34:11,141 --> 01:34:12,130
I got five days,

3606
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:13,143
we're going to bed.

3607
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:14,981
Because you know,

3608
01:34:14,981 --> 01:34:15,400
you get,

3609
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,070
you get like the buffet at Circus Circus,

3610
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:19,090
right?

3611
01:34:19,090 --> 01:34:20,110
And you see,

3612
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:22,900
you see the Americans Hillbilly and his,

3613
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:23,620
you know,

3614
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:24,510
natural habit,

3615
01:34:24,970 --> 01:34:25,803
right?

3616
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:29,230
And then you go to like the
Bellagio and you see that,

3617
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:29,561
you know,

3618
01:34:29,561 --> 01:34:31,420
the beautiful millionaires.

3619
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:32,230
And you just,

3620
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:33,820
that's the thing I love about Vegas.

3621
01:34:33,821 --> 01:34:35,380
Like it is the craziest,

3622
01:34:35,650 --> 01:34:36,940
if you watch the strip,

3623
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:40,240
you will see the craziest
collision of cultures,

3624
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:41,140
you know?

3625
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:41,620
That's true.

3626
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:44,740
Is that a pimp talking
to a Kansas City grandma?

3627
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:45,370
Yeah,

3628
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:46,360
this is Vegas.

3629
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:46,931
Yeah.

3630
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,240
And that's a genuine
pimp right there in a,

3631
01:34:49,241 --> 01:34:50,440
in a green suit.

3632
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:51,101
Yeah.

3633
01:34:51,101 --> 01:34:52,660
He's right there walking the strip.

3634
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:52,990
You know,

3635
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:53,800
you just,

3636
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:55,120
that's what I love about Vegas.

3637
01:34:55,121 --> 01:34:55,540
It is,

3638
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:57,950
it is the best and of America.

3639
01:34:57,951 --> 01:34:58,100
It's

3640
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,050
like fine dining.

3641
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:00,861
You know what I mean?

3642
01:35:00,861 --> 01:35:01,670
Like just the,

3643
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:02,270
you know,

3644
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:07,270
steak house with the greatest cut
a meat you've ever had or you know,

3645
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:11,600
three 99 all you can eat shrimp.

3646
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:12,021
Oh yeah,

3647
01:35:12,021 --> 01:35:14,060
that's shrimp dies.

3648
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,033
Yeah.

3649
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:16,400
There's the circus.

3650
01:35:16,401 --> 01:35:17,780
Circus is a classic one.

3651
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:19,460
The Rivy areas to be classic,

3652
01:35:19,461 --> 01:35:20,294
but tearing

3653
01:35:21,530 --> 01:35:22,363
all the,

3654
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:27,400
it's all now it's all the corporate mall
casinos where you can't tell which one

3655
01:35:27,951 --> 01:35:28,784
you're in.

3656
01:35:29,530 --> 01:35:29,810
Well,

3657
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:31,160
they're just trying to rake up money,

3658
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:34,970
especially they were hit hard during
the downtime and the economy when,

3659
01:35:34,971 --> 01:35:35,300
uh,

3660
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:37,220
2008 when the economy crashed.

3661
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:40,400
I was in Vegas and I was asking one
of the guys who was a cab driver.

3662
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:41,120
I said,

3663
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:41,901
what do you think?

3664
01:35:41,901 --> 01:35:42,950
Like what's the down?

3665
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:44,450
Like how much is it down here?

3666
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:44,990
And he goes,

3667
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:46,550
it's about 50% yeah.

3668
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:50,060
They laid off a ton of people.

3669
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:53,390
Like the hotels were empty and all loads.

3670
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:54,111
Yeah.

3671
01:35:54,111 --> 01:35:55,880
Cab drivers and all that other stuff.

3672
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:57,890
A lot of them lost all the service people,

3673
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:02,720
all the people that were dependent
upon folks hopping around town and also

3674
01:36:02,721 --> 01:36:03,770
giving out tips.

3675
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:05,750
You know when people in the money's tight,

3676
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:07,550
those tips are the
first thing that dry up.

3677
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:09,200
Like you're on your own bitch.

3678
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:14,710
You know that that whole industry of
people relying on people coming there.

3679
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:17,930
That's a very tricky in
the housing being dropped,

3680
01:36:17,931 --> 01:36:21,380
all they built all those
condos and all of that shame.

3681
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:23,210
No shame.

3682
01:36:23,211 --> 01:36:25,460
Atosh he's a comic's comic store.

3683
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,740
She accidentally married
two different gay guys.

3684
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,240
She's fucking hilarious.

3685
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:31,730
She married two different dudes
and it turns out they were gay

3686
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:34,670
and gay guys,

3687
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:37,400
but she bought a house out
there for like a hundred grand.

3688
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:37,700
Yeah,

3689
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,930
and she said it's amazing.

3690
01:36:38,931 --> 01:36:40,970
She does a great house
in a nice neighborhood.

3691
01:36:40,971 --> 01:36:41,211
She goes,

3692
01:36:41,211 --> 01:36:42,110
I got a yard,

3693
01:36:42,111 --> 01:36:43,850
I got to know a few people who did that.

3694
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:44,090
Yeah,

3695
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:44,751
you've got a friend,

3696
01:36:44,751 --> 01:36:45,584
real house there,

3697
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:46,880
a buddy don Barnhart.

3698
01:36:46,881 --> 01:36:47,714
He did that.

3699
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:48,591
He moved there,

3700
01:36:48,591 --> 01:36:49,820
bought a nice house,

3701
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:50,541
you know,

3702
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:52,550
him and his wife and he's
been there for years.

3703
01:36:52,730 --> 01:36:53,720
And if you live in La,

3704
01:36:53,721 --> 01:36:56,300
the idea of a nice a hundred
thousand dollar house,

3705
01:36:56,301 --> 01:36:57,620
it's like a fucking Unicorn.

3706
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:59,150
Like what are you talking about?

3707
01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:00,740
$100,000.

3708
01:37:00,741 --> 01:37:01,220
That's it.

3709
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:02,660
That's all you have to
pay payment on a house.

3710
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:03,711
But you know,

3711
01:37:03,711 --> 01:37:04,431
lucky in,

3712
01:37:04,431 --> 01:37:05,420
in America,

3713
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:06,440
you see that?

3714
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,161
You know what I mean?

3715
01:37:07,161 --> 01:37:10,010
Like I was in Indianapolis and um,

3716
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:10,671
I don't know if you have,

3717
01:37:10,671 --> 01:37:11,660
did Bob and Tom?

3718
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:12,583
Yeah.

3719
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:13,311
And so,

3720
01:37:13,311 --> 01:37:13,641
you know,

3721
01:37:13,641 --> 01:37:16,250
to houses out there and I was like,

3722
01:37:16,251 --> 01:37:16,851
so how many should,

3723
01:37:16,851 --> 01:37:17,541
each guy was like,

3724
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:17,721
eh,

3725
01:37:17,721 --> 01:37:20,000
it's about three 54 huddle.

3726
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:21,213
What,

3727
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:23,310
like my townhouse cost mod,

3728
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:25,700
I could live like a king.

3729
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:26,040
Yeah.

3730
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,190
You get to be an Alison.

3731
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:27,980
I got Annapolis,

3732
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:29,320
but I gotta live in Indianapolis.

3733
01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:32,480
That is the problem with all
due respect to Indianapolis.

3734
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:33,703
It's not happening,

3735
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:35,450
but I'll do respect
Alonzo stay in the know.

3736
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:38,300
But you gotta think like,

3737
01:37:38,301 --> 01:37:41,180
like we were talking about with Tammy
Passkey telly as a touring comic,

3738
01:37:41,181 --> 01:37:42,014
you really,

3739
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:43,041
you know,

3740
01:37:43,041 --> 01:37:47,570
your home becomes just a base and you
travel out of it if you have somewhere

3741
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:48,291
with,

3742
01:37:48,291 --> 01:37:49,580
I remember Schimmel telling me,

3743
01:37:49,581 --> 01:37:52,370
cause Schimmel moved to
Scottsdale and he said,

3744
01:37:52,371 --> 01:37:53,090
man,

3745
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:54,200
I got a beautiful house.

3746
01:37:54,201 --> 01:37:54,560
He said,

3747
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:55,620
I got a airport.

3748
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:55,981
He said,

3749
01:37:55,981 --> 01:37:56,814
that's all you need.

3750
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:57,421
He said,

3751
01:37:57,421 --> 01:37:58,320
if you're a road comic,

3752
01:37:58,620 --> 01:37:59,820
if you got a good airport,

3753
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:01,800
you can live anywhere you want.

3754
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:02,880
It is all you need.

3755
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:05,730
But when you leave la or New York,

3756
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:11,030
you give up the weekday spots and you
give up the auditions and it isn't like

3757
01:38:11,761 --> 01:38:11,941
there,

3758
01:38:11,941 --> 01:38:15,510
there is an aspect of the business
you give up when you leave.

3759
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:17,580
New York and La do weekday spots are big.

3760
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:20,250
The weekday spots and also
being around great comics,

3761
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:20,791
you know,

3762
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:21,360
um,

3763
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:24,730
Tom Rhodes just moved
to La and Tom had been,

3764
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:25,290
uh,

3765
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:27,210
Tom has been like living like a,

3766
01:38:27,330 --> 01:38:28,890
like a vagabond.

3767
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:29,370
Like,

3768
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:30,960
he just lives out of a suitcase,

3769
01:38:30,961 --> 01:38:32,970
but living in hotel to hotel for years,

3770
01:38:32,971 --> 01:38:34,200
I think for like five years,

3771
01:38:34,201 --> 01:38:34,831
he hasn't had a,

3772
01:38:34,831 --> 01:38:35,850
an actual address.

3773
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:40,710
And He came to the comedy store and it
was like a Friday night or something like

3774
01:38:40,711 --> 01:38:40,861
that.

3775
01:38:40,861 --> 01:38:41,281
And he saw,

3776
01:38:41,281 --> 01:38:41,670
you know,

3777
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:42,690
borough was on,

3778
01:38:42,691 --> 01:38:43,800
I was on,

3779
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:46,950
it was just packed fucking room.

3780
01:38:46,951 --> 01:38:47,420
Uh,

3781
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:48,750
it just madness.

3782
01:38:48,751 --> 01:38:49,471
Just one,

3783
01:38:49,471 --> 01:38:51,660
one smash after another.

3784
01:38:51,661 --> 01:38:54,480
Like all these people were there
that were really high level.

3785
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,580
It was just a great night of,

3786
01:38:56,581 --> 01:38:56,821
of,

3787
01:38:56,821 --> 01:38:57,590
of comedy.

3788
01:38:57,590 --> 01:38:57,691
Uh,

3789
01:38:57,691 --> 01:38:59,160
Neil Brennan killed,

3790
01:38:59,190 --> 01:39:01,320
I think Chappelle mine
is stopped in that night.

3791
01:39:01,321 --> 01:39:02,610
It was just madness.

3792
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:04,110
And then he said,

3793
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:05,333
I got to fucking,

3794
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:06,031
I got to move here.

3795
01:39:06,031 --> 01:39:06,451
And he was like,

3796
01:39:06,451 --> 01:39:07,284
I can't,

3797
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:07,621
he goes,

3798
01:39:07,621 --> 01:39:08,910
I'm not seeing good comedy.

3799
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:09,571
Yeah.

3800
01:39:09,571 --> 01:39:10,980
It's too easy to,

3801
01:39:10,981 --> 01:39:11,430
uh,

3802
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:15,540
it's too easy to rest when you're
on the road and then you come here.

3803
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:17,100
Even last week,

3804
01:39:17,101 --> 01:39:21,360
like Tuesday night when we did
dumb show and it was like me,

3805
01:39:21,361 --> 01:39:21,841
Joey,

3806
01:39:21,841 --> 01:39:23,850
and you with Dom Irrera,

3807
01:39:24,050 --> 01:39:24,580
you know?

3808
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:24,930
Yeah.

3809
01:39:24,930 --> 01:39:25,763
That's,

3810
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:27,780
I don't get that in India.

3811
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:28,733
You're not going to get,

3812
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:29,840
it's you,

3813
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:30,150
you,

3814
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:31,770
it elevates your own level.

3815
01:39:31,771 --> 01:39:32,071
Because,

3816
01:39:32,071 --> 01:39:32,341
you know,

3817
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:32,941
you realize like,

3818
01:39:32,941 --> 01:39:34,350
I got to ramp my game up,

3819
01:39:34,410 --> 01:39:35,243
you know,

3820
01:39:35,290 --> 01:39:37,210
and like what we were
saying before that you're,

3821
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:39,400
that joke he did about wiggers like jet,

3822
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:39,930
Joey's,

3823
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:43,080
Joey and I were like howling on the
phone laughing about that one joke.

3824
01:39:43,081 --> 01:39:43,351
We're,

3825
01:39:43,351 --> 01:39:44,520
we're cracking it like that.

3826
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:46,620
That's important for comics to ha.

3827
01:39:46,650 --> 01:39:46,890
Yeah.

3828
01:39:46,890 --> 01:39:48,180
You have to get into,

3829
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:50,800
into town and in New York now is,

3830
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:52,410
it's going crazy like that,

3831
01:39:52,411 --> 01:39:52,741
but it,

3832
01:39:52,741 --> 01:39:53,520
but it,

3833
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,380
it pushes you because he like,

3834
01:39:55,381 --> 01:39:56,214
man,

3835
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:57,510
like these guys are good.

3836
01:39:57,511 --> 01:40:02,511
Like I got to stay sharp and now you
have the next generation coming up and

3837
01:40:02,941 --> 01:40:03,630
they're doing like,

3838
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:07,260
like I like working some
of those alternative rooms
and some of those youngster

3839
01:40:07,261 --> 01:40:09,930
rooms just to be around
something different.

3840
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:11,790
Like not the bullshit side,

3841
01:40:11,791 --> 01:40:13,380
but the ones who are real comics,

3842
01:40:13,381 --> 01:40:14,980
but they're coming up and they're there.

3843
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:16,020
They're just funny,

3844
01:40:16,021 --> 01:40:17,490
but they're doing it in a different way.

3845
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:18,200
Yeah.

3846
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:18,540
Yeah.

3847
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:19,620
I like being around that.

3848
01:40:19,950 --> 01:40:20,221
Well,

3849
01:40:20,221 --> 01:40:23,820
there's a group that are coming up
now that grew up with the Internet.

3850
01:40:24,150 --> 01:40:24,420
Yeah.

3851
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:25,320
This is the first,

3852
01:40:25,470 --> 01:40:28,320
the first generation of standup Comedians,

3853
01:40:28,590 --> 01:40:30,210
these guys that are in
their early twenties,

3854
01:40:30,470 --> 01:40:32,550
you got to think 1994,

3855
01:40:32,670 --> 01:40:34,530
20 fucking one years ago.

3856
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:35,940
That's when the Internet came around.

3857
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:36,240
Yeah.

3858
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:40,310
They all grew up with the inner when
they were five and six years old.

3859
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,000
Technology is normal to them.

3860
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:43,740
Totally normal and a part of life.

3861
01:40:43,741 --> 01:40:46,560
So we started talking about
looking at encyclopedias.

3862
01:40:47,150 --> 01:40:49,380
You break out the scrolls of the elders.

3863
01:40:50,430 --> 01:40:51,390
They should go to the,

3864
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:52,860
the sacred cabin in the,

3865
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:54,250
where they kept the scrolls.

3866
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:55,270
And then the other side,

3867
01:40:55,271 --> 01:40:58,840
when you see older comics
who don't change their act,

3868
01:40:58,870 --> 01:40:59,590
ah,

3869
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:02,200
said they'll make like a videotape
reference and you're like,

3870
01:41:02,530 --> 01:41:03,363
videotape.

3871
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:05,440
That's the worst,

3872
01:41:05,441 --> 01:41:05,741
you know,

3873
01:41:05,741 --> 01:41:09,910
and you've got to set the
clock on your set the clock.

3874
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:14,940
What you heard someone getting a joke
like that recently in the past three years

3875
01:41:14,981 --> 01:41:15,650
I've heard,

3876
01:41:15,650 --> 01:41:17,860
haven't heard set the clock on the VCR.

3877
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:19,990
There's nothing sadder
than a lot of these,

3878
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:20,470
uh,

3879
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:22,480
these guys that just don't write anymore.

3880
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:23,680
There's something about like,

3881
01:41:23,681 --> 01:41:25,180
musicians can pull that off.

3882
01:41:25,330 --> 01:41:28,180
Like musicians from the
1960s can do the same songs.

3883
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:29,440
If you went to see,

3884
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:30,131
you know,

3885
01:41:30,131 --> 01:41:30,964
fill in the blank,

3886
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,450
you know whatever band and they were doing
some shit from the 1960s you be like,

3887
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:35,590
oh shit,

3888
01:41:35,591 --> 01:41:36,424
that's a great song.

3889
01:41:36,910 --> 01:41:40,360
But if you went to see a comic and they
were doing jokes in the 1960s she'd be

3890
01:41:40,361 --> 01:41:40,541
like,

3891
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:43,180
what kind of sadness am I looking at?

3892
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:43,991
Like I said,

3893
01:41:43,991 --> 01:41:47,020
I do these jazz cruises and I love it
because I get to work with some of the

3894
01:41:47,021 --> 01:41:50,860
greatest jazz musicians in the
world and they're brilliant.

3895
01:41:50,861 --> 01:41:51,370
But I,

3896
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:54,640
I bring that up and they love when I
fuck with him about it cause I'm like,

3897
01:41:54,641 --> 01:41:55,180
look,

3898
01:41:55,180 --> 01:42:00,180
I got to do a show Monday and then I do
another show Friday and I got to do two

3899
01:42:00,191 --> 01:42:01,030
different shows.

3900
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:02,680
You are playing some shit.

3901
01:42:02,681 --> 01:42:07,681
Miles Davis wrote in 1947 and they
think you're a fucking genius.

3902
01:42:09,130 --> 01:42:13,600
You were playing some shit to dizzy
Gillespie played after the war.

3903
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:17,590
That would be world war two and they
think you're brilliant so and that,

3904
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:18,431
but I fuck with them.

3905
01:42:18,431 --> 01:42:22,180
They love it though because it is true
when you're a musician and if you have a

3906
01:42:22,181 --> 01:42:23,140
hit song,

3907
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:25,180
you have to play that song,

3908
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:25,601
you know,

3909
01:42:25,601 --> 01:42:28,120
no matter how old it is or whatever it is,

3910
01:42:28,121 --> 01:42:28,954
like yeah,

3911
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:30,670
you have to do that song.

3912
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:33,220
And like if I do a joke like uh,

3913
01:42:33,221 --> 01:42:36,820
we heard that one and
I could never be like,

3914
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:37,943
all right,

3915
01:42:38,180 --> 01:42:42,960
it's sort of Eddie Murphy and
delirious 1983 I like to do gunny Gugu

3916
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:46,720
there's no cover comics.

3917
01:42:46,721 --> 01:42:47,590
They used to be,

3918
01:42:47,890 --> 01:42:49,180
do you remember Ilan Gold?

3919
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:49,780
Yeah.

3920
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:54,430
He used to do impressions of Comedians
and doing it with their own material,

3921
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:58,210
but then people started getting mad at
him cause his impressions were dead on.

3922
01:42:58,240 --> 01:42:59,680
He did amazing impressions,

3923
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:01,690
but he would do it with their material.

3924
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:02,440
But that's,

3925
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:04,520
but that's funny cause
you're doing it right.

3926
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:07,480
You're not doing it as if
you came up with it yourself.

3927
01:43:07,510 --> 01:43:07,930
Right,

3928
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:08,171
right.

3929
01:43:08,171 --> 01:43:08,610
You know,

3930
01:43:08,610 --> 01:43:10,810
but he still had to stop doing it.

3931
01:43:10,811 --> 01:43:11,200
Yeah.

3932
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,640
He got in trouble a little bit.

3933
01:43:12,670 --> 01:43:13,503
People got mad at him.

3934
01:43:13,750 --> 01:43:14,620
I don't know who got mad at them,

3935
01:43:14,621 --> 01:43:15,640
but that's what I had heard.

3936
01:43:15,641 --> 01:43:18,970
So then he started doing impressions
of these comics with material that he

3937
01:43:18,971 --> 01:43:19,570
wrote.

3938
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:24,570
I heard some guy did an hour of Patrice
and put it on youtube as if it was his

3939
01:43:25,181 --> 01:43:25,750
own.

3940
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:26,011
Well,

3941
01:43:26,011 --> 01:43:30,190
he had done a bunch of other stuff about
that Patrice had done in the past and

3942
01:43:30,191 --> 01:43:31,120
not acknowledged it.

3943
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:32,220
And he tried to pretend that it was a,

3944
01:43:32,221 --> 01:43:35,200
obviously just an homage to Patrice,

3945
01:43:35,201 --> 01:43:38,440
but it wasn't the plagiarist.

3946
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:39,260
That's,

3947
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:40,150
that's insane.

3948
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:42,123
People are insane.

3949
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:42,760
Yeah.

3950
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:44,200
People think they can get away with shit.

3951
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:47,710
There's a lot of nutty people out there
that think that they're going to sneak

3952
01:43:47,711 --> 01:43:48,544
by.

3953
01:43:48,820 --> 01:43:49,211
And you know,

3954
01:43:49,211 --> 01:43:51,130
some of them do because
the audience doesn't,

3955
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:52,490
you know,

3956
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:52,971
we know,

3957
01:43:52,971 --> 01:43:54,200
but the audience doesn't.

3958
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:55,380
So yeah.

3959
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:56,800
So you fully audience,

3960
01:43:56,900 --> 01:43:59,150
there's some guys to this
day that it's knocked by.

3961
01:43:59,210 --> 01:44:02,840
You tell people that guy he got
famous by being a plagiarist.

3962
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:03,201
You're like,

3963
01:44:03,201 --> 01:44:04,034
what?

3964
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:04,791
And then you go,

3965
01:44:04,791 --> 01:44:05,031
yeah,

3966
01:44:05,031 --> 01:44:05,864
go Google it.

3967
01:44:05,870 --> 01:44:07,910
And you'll tell them like they'll
go Google it and like what?

3968
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:09,561
Yeah,

3969
01:44:09,561 --> 01:44:10,394
but they don't care.

3970
01:44:10,810 --> 01:44:11,570
You know?

3971
01:44:11,570 --> 01:44:12,450
They do.

3972
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:12,830
Yeah.

3973
01:44:12,830 --> 01:44:13,101
You know,

3974
01:44:13,101 --> 01:44:13,900
you can always tell them,

3975
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:14,030
no,

3976
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:14,390
I don't.

3977
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:16,220
I wonder if the artists cares,

3978
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:18,230
like if a comic or the whoever,

3979
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:19,000
you know what I mean?

3980
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,520
Cause you said you know it when you're,

3981
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:25,760
you know when you can bullshit
the crowd and you can make,

3982
01:44:25,790 --> 01:44:30,110
you could make millions of dollars but
then you're in the room or you're on the

3983
01:44:30,111 --> 01:44:33,560
show with the real comics and you know,

3984
01:44:33,561 --> 01:44:34,910
just same thing with singers,

3985
01:44:34,911 --> 01:44:35,451
you know what I mean?

3986
01:44:35,451 --> 01:44:35,781
If you're,

3987
01:44:35,781 --> 01:44:38,690
if you're one of these singers
where the machine is doing it,

3988
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:41,180
but now you're in a situation like,

3989
01:44:41,210 --> 01:44:41,721
Oh shit,

3990
01:44:41,721 --> 01:44:43,070
like award show these.

3991
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:43,460
Yeah,

3992
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:44,420
these are like,

3993
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:49,960
like you call yourself a diva but Aretha
Franklins in the room and you're like,

3994
01:44:50,181 --> 01:44:51,290
oh shit,

3995
01:44:51,291 --> 01:44:51,561
this,

3996
01:44:51,561 --> 01:44:52,160
this isn't it

3997
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:57,160
going to go it because like you were what
you were saying like that the respect

3998
01:44:57,981 --> 01:44:59,690
of the old guard,

3999
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:01,940
like the respect of respected
comedians like come,

4000
01:45:01,941 --> 01:45:02,780
coming up to like,

4001
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:04,093
you know,

4002
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:04,881
we've all had that.

4003
01:45:04,881 --> 01:45:07,940
Like I tell them that the
Damon Waynes while I'll never,

4004
01:45:07,941 --> 01:45:09,850
I'll never forget that because
it's in the parking lot.

4005
01:45:09,870 --> 01:45:10,161
I was like,

4006
01:45:10,161 --> 01:45:10,670
whoa.

4007
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:12,230
He probably doesn't
even remember right now.

4008
01:45:12,231 --> 01:45:13,460
But just being,

4009
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,740
becoming friends with Robert
Schimmel and I'm like,

4010
01:45:15,741 --> 01:45:17,650
I'm really friends with Robert Showman.

4011
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:18,620
Like he's real,

4012
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:20,810
he's a real comic and
I'm friends with them.

4013
01:45:20,811 --> 01:45:22,460
Like I guess I'm a comic now.

4014
01:45:22,461 --> 01:45:23,150
Like I'm a,

4015
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:24,140
I can be a comedian.

4016
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:27,020
Like it doesn't seem like now we both,

4017
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:29,270
we've been around so
long it's just normal,

4018
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:32,240
but damn the beginning
is so fucking shaky.

4019
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:33,133
Yeah.

4020
01:45:33,530 --> 01:45:37,700
I think they'll always be some moments
with some comics where you're like,

4021
01:45:37,701 --> 01:45:38,240
wow,

4022
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:38,601
yeah,

4023
01:45:38,601 --> 01:45:42,560
that's for sure cool that I notice
I'm friends with this guy or whatever.

4024
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:45,020
So those guys don't have that.

4025
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:47,420
Those guys know that we know
that they're full of shit.

4026
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:48,000
Yeah.

4027
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:48,251
That,

4028
01:45:48,251 --> 01:45:48,490
that,

4029
01:45:48,490 --> 01:45:49,550
that eats away at them.

4030
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:50,331
I then always ate it,

4031
01:45:50,331 --> 01:45:51,290
ate away at him and see Ya.

4032
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:54,320
That was on him and see his biggest
thing so that no comics liked him.

4033
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:55,740
His biggest things,

4034
01:45:55,741 --> 01:45:58,670
you can never got anybody's respect
and you see chew away at him.

4035
01:45:59,260 --> 01:45:59,510
Yeah.

4036
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:00,140
It's a,

4037
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:00,740
it's a tough,

4038
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:01,670
it's a tough place.

4039
01:46:01,671 --> 01:46:05,150
And then the other thing that's funny
is when they take an actor and they call

4040
01:46:05,151 --> 01:46:05,984
him a comic.

4041
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:07,783
Yeah.

4042
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:09,380
Michael Richards.

4043
01:46:09,420 --> 01:46:09,620
You know,

4044
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:10,191
that's what I've heard,

4045
01:46:10,191 --> 01:46:10,491
Richard.

4046
01:46:10,491 --> 01:46:12,780
It was like you're not a calm,

4047
01:46:12,781 --> 01:46:12,921
like,

4048
01:46:12,921 --> 01:46:14,090
you know what happened
with Michael Richards?

4049
01:46:14,091 --> 01:46:15,440
The same shit that got you arrested.

4050
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:21,200
Michael Richards came to the comedy
store before he went to the laugh factory

4051
01:46:21,201 --> 01:46:25,670
coked out of his mind and he was just a
real aggressive and talking crazy shit

4052
01:46:25,671 --> 01:46:29,900
and just wasn't just a Zahn
of it is just out of it.

4053
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:34,030
But I've watched him go up
at the comedy store and uh,

4054
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:35,390
my initial thought was like,

4055
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:36,051
Oh shit,

4056
01:46:36,051 --> 01:46:37,640
I didn't even know Michael
Richards does stand up.

4057
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:41,000
And he would go onstage
and the audience went nuts.

4058
01:46:41,570 --> 01:46:44,180
But then three minutes in they were like,

4059
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:46,130
when does this guy started telling jokes

4060
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:47,980
what he do?

4061
01:46:47,981 --> 01:46:49,350
I'd watch him and it'd done.

4062
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:50,100
Then he would just

4063
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,720
do a Seinfeld move,

4064
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:53,870
like the head shake law,

4065
01:46:53,900 --> 01:46:55,380
something like that from Seinfeld.

4066
01:46:55,381 --> 01:46:57,870
And the crowd would love
it for a little bit.

4067
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:58,530
Nothing.

4068
01:46:58,530 --> 01:46:59,160
Yeah.

4069
01:46:59,160 --> 01:46:59,721
Well you got it.

4070
01:46:59,721 --> 01:47:00,554
You know,

4071
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:01,251
that's the thing.

4072
01:47:01,251 --> 01:47:02,760
But that's the beauty of standup,

4073
01:47:02,761 --> 01:47:03,630
no matter who you are.

4074
01:47:03,631 --> 01:47:03,841
Right.

4075
01:47:03,841 --> 01:47:05,280
Even Seinfeld said that like,

4076
01:47:05,281 --> 01:47:06,420
no matter who you are,

4077
01:47:07,230 --> 01:47:08,190
you gotta be funny.

4078
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:12,720
Like he was like being Jerry Seinfeld
got me the first five minutes and then

4079
01:47:12,721 --> 01:47:13,350
they're like,

4080
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:13,681
all right,

4081
01:47:13,681 --> 01:47:14,514
what else you got?

4082
01:47:15,490 --> 01:47:15,721
Yeah,

4083
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:17,760
I mean it's fucking shows
an hour long and dude,

4084
01:47:17,761 --> 01:47:18,920
you better come with some funding.

4085
01:47:19,550 --> 01:47:21,420
What do you this Cosby thing,

4086
01:47:21,421 --> 01:47:21,631
man,

4087
01:47:21,631 --> 01:47:21,830
we're,

4088
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:22,860
we're talking about that,

4089
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:28,040
about how this guy for the longest time
was thought of as like one of the all

4090
01:47:30,001 --> 01:47:33,540
time greats and now people
look at him and they think,

4091
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:34,110
well,

4092
01:47:34,110 --> 01:47:35,190
here's a guy that's just,

4093
01:47:35,310 --> 01:47:37,080
he's just a piece of shit like that,

4094
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:41,340
that flip flop between
being like this respected,

4095
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:42,300
adored,

4096
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:44,520
idolized all time.

4097
01:47:44,520 --> 01:47:45,211
Great Comedians.

4098
01:47:45,211 --> 01:47:46,710
Like if you had to pick a Mt.

4099
01:47:46,710 --> 01:47:49,110
Rushmore standup comedy and
there's only four guys on there,

4100
01:47:49,290 --> 01:47:51,720
one of those fucking
guys until the last year.

4101
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:54,110
One of those guys is
going to be bill Cosby it,

4102
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:54,750
you know,

4103
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:56,550
I'm so torn because I love Cosby.

4104
01:47:56,551 --> 01:47:58,620
I think Cosby's one of the greatest,

4105
01:47:58,710 --> 01:48:01,890
if not the greatest of all time
definitely would be on the Mount Rushmore.

4106
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:02,941
So now it's like,

4107
01:48:02,941 --> 01:48:03,610
okay,

4108
01:48:03,610 --> 01:48:04,830
still a great comic,

4109
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:06,330
but bad guy,

4110
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:07,191
you know,

4111
01:48:07,191 --> 01:48:10,800
at at best flawed human being.

4112
01:48:10,801 --> 01:48:12,780
But I don't understand.

4113
01:48:12,781 --> 01:48:16,770
I'll never understand the motive it
head to beat and it's just my opinion.

4114
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:22,040
There had to be some weird fetish involved
because it's not like you can't get

4115
01:48:22,621 --> 01:48:24,210
laid if you're a bill Cosby.

4116
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:29,750
I think he quoted there had to be some
kind of weird turn on or something.

4117
01:48:31,251 --> 01:48:31,620
You know,

4118
01:48:31,620 --> 01:48:32,251
like I'd be,

4119
01:48:32,251 --> 01:48:35,970
I'd be interested in what
a psychologist would say.

4120
01:48:35,970 --> 01:48:37,830
Like why does someone do this?

4121
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:40,620
I think a lot of people used to do it.

4122
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,480
That's what I think can think so.

4123
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:45,930
I think in the 1960s
dosing people wasn't I,

4124
01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:49,020
you know how we were talking about
drunk driving in the early days,

4125
01:48:49,021 --> 01:48:49,590
drunk drivers,

4126
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:50,423
no big deal.

4127
01:48:50,430 --> 01:48:53,130
I think they used to think the
same way about dosing people.

4128
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:53,790
You know,

4129
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:56,820
cause bill Cosby used to have
a whole bit about Spanish fly.

4130
01:48:57,090 --> 01:48:57,280
Yeah.

4131
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:58,620
About giving girls true.

4132
01:48:58,810 --> 01:48:59,551
Slipping a girl.

4133
01:48:59,551 --> 01:49:02,190
I'm Mickey and she gets
all Horny and fucked up.

4134
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:03,090
I mean that's true.

4135
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:05,190
You're drugging someone
against their will.

4136
01:49:05,191 --> 01:49:06,024
They don't know it.

4137
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:08,460
I think that was a normal thing,

4138
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:09,251
I think.

4139
01:49:09,251 --> 01:49:09,750
And not,

4140
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:10,920
it was never a good thing.

4141
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:11,670
And you know,

4142
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:12,091
ethical,

4143
01:49:12,091 --> 01:49:12,924
moral,

4144
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:13,440
right.

4145
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,000
Reasonable people never did it.

4146
01:49:15,210 --> 01:49:19,140
But I think it was way more common
than we would like to believe.

4147
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:19,770
Yeah.

4148
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:21,780
I may be people dosed people.

4149
01:49:22,110 --> 01:49:22,830
I think it was like,

4150
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:26,820
you remember that scene in animal
house with the girl's passed out,

4151
01:49:26,821 --> 01:49:28,570
the dude's got the devil on
one shoulder and the angel,

4152
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:29,800
yeah,

4153
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,260
you lay leave her alone.

4154
01:49:31,290 --> 01:49:31,651
Fuck her.

4155
01:49:31,651 --> 01:49:32,484
Fuck her brains out.

4156
01:49:32,490 --> 01:49:33,323
Tucker tests.

4157
01:49:33,390 --> 01:49:35,370
Like you couldn't even do that today.

4158
01:49:35,430 --> 01:49:37,410
You couldn't have that in
the movie cause that's rape.

4159
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:42,300
But back then it was like there was at
least the possibility that this guy was

4160
01:49:42,301 --> 01:49:44,490
considering having sex
with this passed out woman.

4161
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:47,830
And then today the drug thing,

4162
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:48,070
like

4163
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:49,000
the Cosby thing,

4164
01:49:49,001 --> 01:49:51,340
drugging someone is thought
of as a heinous crime.

4165
01:49:51,341 --> 01:49:53,020
Like you drug people and you raped him.

4166
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:54,220
It's a heinous crime.

4167
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:55,060
Well and,

4168
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:56,480
and it was then,

4169
01:49:56,900 --> 01:49:57,351
but yeah,

4170
01:49:57,351 --> 01:50:00,650
you maybe society looked on it differently
or maybe it was something amongst the

4171
01:50:00,651 --> 01:50:01,484
boys.

4172
01:50:01,570 --> 01:50:02,180
Yeah.

4173
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:02,900
That you did.

4174
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:03,211
I don't,

4175
01:50:03,211 --> 01:50:03,560
I don't,

4176
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:04,430
I don't really know.

4177
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:06,220
Playboy mansion and it,

4178
01:50:06,290 --> 01:50:06,890
it's,

4179
01:50:06,890 --> 01:50:07,221
you know,

4180
01:50:07,221 --> 01:50:07,520
it's,

4181
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,770
it's horrible for everyone involved.

4182
01:50:10,010 --> 01:50:10,521
You know what I mean?

4183
01:50:10,521 --> 01:50:12,380
It's horrible for the women involved.

4184
01:50:12,381 --> 01:50:17,381
It's horrible for what's happened to
his lifelong reputation is all gone now.

4185
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:20,270
You know it.

4186
01:50:20,270 --> 01:50:21,350
And it's almost,

4187
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:23,330
it was like with Michael Jackson,

4188
01:50:23,331 --> 01:50:28,331
like there's a generation that only
thought of him as a freak and it's like,

4189
01:50:28,821 --> 01:50:33,821
you guys really don't understand who
he was musically to the seventies and

4190
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:34,730
eighties.

4191
01:50:34,730 --> 01:50:35,750
Cause in the 90s,

4192
01:50:35,751 --> 01:50:37,160
he just became a freak show.

4193
01:50:37,410 --> 01:50:38,070
You know,

4194
01:50:38,070 --> 01:50:39,060
when I was a kid,

4195
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:41,070
there was a radio station in,

4196
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:41,730
um,

4197
01:50:41,730 --> 01:50:43,950
in La or in a Boston rather.

4198
01:50:44,190 --> 01:50:49,020
It was a called the rock of Boston
w I think it was called [inaudible].

4199
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:49,883
I think that's what it was.

4200
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:55,460
And they played Michael Jackson when
Michael Jackson came out and that,

4201
01:50:55,620 --> 01:50:56,730
I remember the DJ saying,

4202
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:57,390
look,

4203
01:50:57,390 --> 01:50:59,970
I know what you're saying
that this is dance music,

4204
01:50:59,971 --> 01:51:00,804
but listen,

4205
01:51:00,930 --> 01:51:02,970
this is just a great song.

4206
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,930
And the guy who played,

4207
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:04,650
um,

4208
01:51:04,650 --> 01:51:05,730
I think it was a,

4209
01:51:06,330 --> 01:51:07,710
trying to remember what song it was.

4210
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:09,240
It might've been beat it.

4211
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:10,081
I don't know what it was,

4212
01:51:10,081 --> 01:51:11,430
but it was like that,

4213
01:51:11,610 --> 01:51:12,990
like d thriller,

4214
01:51:12,991 --> 01:51:14,100
when thriller came out,

4215
01:51:14,130 --> 01:51:16,740
everybody just stepped back and just said,

4216
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:17,850
what the fuck.

4217
01:51:17,851 --> 01:51:22,770
This is just genius on a level that
no one had been able to reach before.

4218
01:51:22,820 --> 01:51:23,151
Yeah.

4219
01:51:23,151 --> 01:51:23,391
I,

4220
01:51:23,391 --> 01:51:23,840
um,

4221
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:27,200
I did this award thing and they
were given an award to Quincy Jones,

4222
01:51:27,580 --> 01:51:27,890
you know,

4223
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:31,100
and he produced thriller and
I was joking with him about,

4224
01:51:31,101 --> 01:51:31,371
I said,

4225
01:51:31,371 --> 01:51:32,150
you know,

4226
01:51:32,150 --> 01:51:32,821
Quincy Jones,

4227
01:51:32,821 --> 01:51:35,240
dear brothers didn't know
who Eddie van Halen was.

4228
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:38,380
Van Halen doing or a
Michael Jackson record them.

4229
01:51:38,381 --> 01:51:39,620
Like only Quincy would think,

4230
01:51:39,621 --> 01:51:39,801
yeah,

4231
01:51:39,801 --> 01:51:44,750
let's get the baddest rock guitarist
and have him do a solo with Michael

4232
01:51:44,750 --> 01:51:45,510
Jackson.

4233
01:51:45,510 --> 01:51:47,870
Like who he played guitar,

4234
01:51:47,990 --> 01:51:48,800
you know,

4235
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:49,071
but,

4236
01:51:49,071 --> 01:51:50,240
but that was yeah.

4237
01:51:50,241 --> 01:51:50,711
And people,

4238
01:51:50,711 --> 01:51:51,800
but people don't know like,

4239
01:51:51,850 --> 01:51:52,050
and,

4240
01:51:52,050 --> 01:51:53,150
and the videos,

4241
01:51:53,890 --> 01:51:57,400
cause that was when video just
started and he had dance shit.

4242
01:51:57,410 --> 01:52:00,680
Like when he did that thing in smooth
criminal where he leaned forward,

4243
01:52:00,710 --> 01:52:01,543
you're like,

4244
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:04,160
that's not humanly possible,

4245
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:06,000
you know.

4246
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,151
No,

4247
01:52:06,151 --> 01:52:06,690
he,

4248
01:52:06,690 --> 01:52:07,140
uh,

4249
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:07,950
he was like,

4250
01:52:07,950 --> 01:52:09,330
no one before him.

4251
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:11,700
There was no one that
you could compare him to.

4252
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:12,060
Right.

4253
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:13,110
Like you could say,

4254
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:14,760
you look at Elvis and you go,

4255
01:52:14,761 --> 01:52:15,240
yeah,

4256
01:52:15,240 --> 01:52:18,000
Elvis was really good
singer and a good performer,

4257
01:52:18,001 --> 01:52:22,290
but Elvis kind of borrowed a little
bit from the old rhythm and blues guys.

4258
01:52:22,291 --> 01:52:25,440
And they borrowed a little bit from
the way Chuck Berry's to dance.

4259
01:52:25,441 --> 01:52:29,130
And there was a little bit of this and a
little bit of that when Michael Jackson

4260
01:52:29,131 --> 01:52:29,571
came along,

4261
01:52:29,571 --> 01:52:29,941
you gotta go,

4262
01:52:29,941 --> 01:52:30,740
okay.

4263
01:52:30,740 --> 01:52:31,573
Yeah.

4264
01:52:31,610 --> 01:52:32,443
Compare that to any,

4265
01:52:33,130 --> 01:52:35,270
and the other thing about Michael Jackson,

4266
01:52:35,271 --> 01:52:38,270
and I always said that this is
the part people don't talk about,

4267
01:52:38,271 --> 01:52:41,090
like he was world famous at 10.

4268
01:52:41,270 --> 01:52:43,400
[inaudible] like when you
talk about he's fucked up.

4269
01:52:43,401 --> 01:52:46,010
What can you imagine everyone in the

4270
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:48,860
world knowing who you were
when you're like 10 years old?

4271
01:52:48,861 --> 01:52:49,694
Like,

4272
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:50,181
you know,

4273
01:52:50,181 --> 01:52:53,480
by the time you're 15
adult women pass out,

4274
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:54,081
like,

4275
01:52:54,081 --> 01:52:57,590
can you imagine walking into a room and
having people pass out just because you

4276
01:52:57,591 --> 01:52:58,371
walked in a room,

4277
01:52:58,371 --> 01:53:01,460
they're overcome and they
literally think like,

4278
01:53:01,461 --> 01:53:02,990
how does that affect you,

4279
01:53:03,820 --> 01:53:04,310
you know,

4280
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:05,300
as a person?

4281
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:06,201
Well,

4282
01:53:06,201 --> 01:53:06,500
we,

4283
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:08,360
I think we all have that weird effect.

4284
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:09,140
Um,

4285
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:11,930
when we meet someone who we can't believe
we're really meeting them and we're

4286
01:53:11,931 --> 01:53:13,160
just like taken aback like,

4287
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:13,730
Whoa,

4288
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:15,260
we've all been starstruck before.

4289
01:53:15,261 --> 01:53:16,730
We've all had that weird effect.

4290
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:18,830
Even if it's on a low level,

4291
01:53:19,010 --> 01:53:19,311
like,

4292
01:53:19,311 --> 01:53:19,611
you know,

4293
01:53:19,611 --> 01:53:21,640
you're at a comedy club
and curse rock shows up,

4294
01:53:21,650 --> 01:53:22,040
right?

4295
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:22,281
Like,

4296
01:53:22,281 --> 01:53:23,450
like Whoa Shit Chris.

4297
01:53:23,451 --> 01:53:23,631
Right?

4298
01:53:23,631 --> 01:53:26,870
I mean you can be a professional
comic and Louis C K Kza like,

4299
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:27,340
oh shit,

4300
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:28,173
Louie c guys here.

4301
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:31,250
When that guy would walk into a room,

4302
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:33,140
it was that times a million,

4303
01:53:33,170 --> 01:53:33,830
right?

4304
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:36,890
There was nothing like it
and no way to prepare for it.

4305
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:38,240
And he never had a normal life.

4306
01:53:38,241 --> 01:53:41,810
Like you were talking about your career
as an airplane mechanic and like you,

4307
01:53:41,811 --> 01:53:43,970
you knew regular people,

4308
01:53:43,971 --> 01:53:45,440
you had regular jobs,

4309
01:53:45,670 --> 01:53:46,880
he had been to jail,

4310
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:47,301
you know,

4311
01:53:47,301 --> 01:53:47,421
the,

4312
01:53:47,421 --> 01:53:48,290
all the whole deal.

4313
01:53:48,291 --> 01:53:49,450
You ran the whole gamut as an,

4314
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:51,200
as a grown adult human being.

4315
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:56,330
This kid camera when he was in the
Jackson five and his fucking brothers,

4316
01:53:56,510 --> 01:54:01,040
his brothers who were all grown ass men
had a sit back and watch that little

4317
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:05,750
brother just run shit because
their dad gave birth to this one.

4318
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:07,220
Just super genius.

4319
01:54:07,221 --> 01:54:10,430
Like they had all these kids and
everybody was really talented.

4320
01:54:10,431 --> 01:54:12,500
Latoya and Janet and Jermaine.

4321
01:54:12,501 --> 01:54:13,400
Everybody was talented.

4322
01:54:13,790 --> 01:54:15,590
But then there was this
little motherfucker,

4323
01:54:15,650 --> 01:54:19,850
the last one out of the
box that just had magic,

4324
01:54:19,900 --> 01:54:20,330
right?

4325
01:54:20,330 --> 01:54:21,170
He hadn't magic.

4326
01:54:21,170 --> 01:54:22,730
And then you're getting back the Cosby,

4327
01:54:22,731 --> 01:54:23,810
what you're talking about.

4328
01:54:23,811 --> 01:54:28,811
The other thing is like how many hundred
million dollars did he give to United

4329
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:29,330
Negro College Fund?

4330
01:54:29,330 --> 01:54:32,660
Like are kids like bill Cosby
paid for my college education?

4331
01:54:33,230 --> 01:54:33,831
You know what I mean?

4332
01:54:33,831 --> 01:54:37,580
So it's just such a weird thing.

4333
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:38,390
And it's awesome.

4334
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:40,490
Often like human beings that are flawed,

4335
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:42,320
they're not flawed in every way,

4336
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:42,920
right?

4337
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:43,970
They're not all bad.

4338
01:54:43,990 --> 01:54:45,860
And there's a lot of people
that do terrible things,

4339
01:54:45,861 --> 01:54:48,170
but they were actually really
good with other things.

4340
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:50,510
It's,

4341
01:54:50,690 --> 01:54:51,440
you know?

4342
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:51,860
Yeah,

4343
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:52,281
it's crazy.

4344
01:54:52,281 --> 01:54:52,940
It's crazy.

4345
01:54:52,940 --> 01:54:53,773
It's crazy.

4346
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:56,930
My friend Eddie has an interesting
theory about bill Cosby.

4347
01:54:57,170 --> 01:54:57,650
He said,

4348
01:54:57,650 --> 01:54:58,161
you know what,

4349
01:54:58,161 --> 01:54:59,060
at the end of the day,

4350
01:54:59,270 --> 01:55:00,530
Bill Cosby at,

4351
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:04,400
even though he was super famous
and he probably got turned down,

4352
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:06,080
he probably got turned down occasionally.

4353
01:55:06,081 --> 01:55:07,730
It probably drove him
crazy and didn't like it.

4354
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,560
And so when like one of these,

4355
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:11,390
one of the stories that I was listening,

4356
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:12,313
I was reading rather,

4357
01:55:12,650 --> 01:55:12,900
uh,

4358
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:15,380
whether the girl was talking about
her experiences that Bill Cosby,

4359
01:55:15,381 --> 01:55:18,670
that it started out and it's like mentor
friendship sort of relationship that

4360
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:21,530
eventually he drugged her and then
fucked her while she was passed out,

4361
01:55:21,540 --> 01:55:23,150
like can and that she,

4362
01:55:23,151 --> 01:55:23,360
you know,

4363
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:25,310
she just felt violated and horrible.

4364
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:30,310
But it was this mentor thing that he
would angle in first and then when he

4365
01:55:30,951 --> 01:55:32,750
couldn't get the pussy
that way and was like,

4366
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:33,081
oh,

4367
01:55:33,081 --> 01:55:33,800
okay,

4368
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:34,820
have a Cappucino.

4369
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:35,130
Right.

4370
01:55:35,130 --> 01:55:36,020
Do you want a Cappuccino?

4371
01:55:36,021 --> 01:55:36,590
Here you go,

4372
01:55:36,590 --> 01:55:37,250
boom.

4373
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:38,031
And the next thing you know,

4374
01:55:38,031 --> 01:55:38,781
she's passed out.

4375
01:55:38,781 --> 01:55:42,290
Like he got tired of working for it and
decided to just go back to his bag of

4376
01:55:42,291 --> 01:55:43,030
tricks.

4377
01:55:43,030 --> 01:55:43,660
Might've been,

4378
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:43,890
I,

4379
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:44,620
I again,

4380
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:45,730
I have no,

4381
01:55:46,450 --> 01:55:47,860
I have no idea cause I,

4382
01:55:47,861 --> 01:55:49,900
I can't imagine it's also,

4383
01:55:49,901 --> 01:55:50,350
you know,

4384
01:55:50,350 --> 01:55:52,300
because it's something
I can't imagine doing.

4385
01:55:52,330 --> 01:55:54,310
So I don't know what
the motivation would be.

4386
01:55:54,690 --> 01:55:54,960
Yeah.

4387
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:55,571
You know what I mean?

4388
01:55:55,571 --> 01:55:56,080
Like it's,

4389
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:56,850
it's,

4390
01:55:56,850 --> 01:55:57,730
it's so evil.

4391
01:55:57,970 --> 01:55:58,803
Yeah.

4392
01:55:59,080 --> 01:55:59,790
Yeah.

4393
01:55:59,790 --> 01:56:00,061
And when,

4394
01:56:00,061 --> 01:56:00,271
you know,

4395
01:56:00,271 --> 01:56:03,060
this woman was on television
talking about it and,

4396
01:56:03,061 --> 01:56:03,660
uh,

4397
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:06,480
I think she was a lawyer
and she was saying,

4398
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:06,871
you know,

4399
01:56:06,871 --> 01:56:10,590
they were talking about the legal
ramifications and apparently one of these

4400
01:56:10,591 --> 01:56:11,424
women,

4401
01:56:11,490 --> 01:56:15,600
her accusation is inside of
the statute of limitations.

4402
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:16,141
Yeah.

4403
01:56:16,141 --> 01:56:17,550
But they're not going
to bring him to trial.

4404
01:56:17,670 --> 01:56:18,503
You don't think something that,

4405
01:56:19,110 --> 01:56:20,010
what do you think was going to happen?

4406
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:20,421
Uh,

4407
01:56:20,421 --> 01:56:20,820
he's going to,

4408
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:21,980
it's going to cost them a lot of money.

4409
01:56:22,280 --> 01:56:23,210
He's gonna pay,

4410
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:23,900
uh,

4411
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:24,231
you know,

4412
01:56:24,231 --> 01:56:24,740
whether they,

4413
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:25,700
whether it be some,

4414
01:56:25,701 --> 01:56:26,480
like,

4415
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:27,380
I think it's Gloria.

4416
01:56:27,381 --> 01:56:30,640
All red has the class action lawsuits.

4417
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:31,520
So whether it's like,

4418
01:56:31,521 --> 01:56:31,821
okay,

4419
01:56:31,821 --> 01:56:35,170
we give her a ton of money and she
divides it up amongst the women,

4420
01:56:35,290 --> 01:56:35,940
or she goes,

4421
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:40,140
I'm fucking crazy trip and buys a Rolls
Royce fingers or herself for the Gold

4422
01:56:40,141 --> 01:56:40,974
Dildo.

4423
01:56:41,410 --> 01:56:43,620
Or they come up with
something else like you.

4424
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:48,640
You know what I thought was was
like weird and it was funny,

4425
01:56:48,881 --> 01:56:51,190
but in a horrible way with Jared.

4426
01:56:51,790 --> 01:56:52,600
Oh yeah.

4427
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:57,600
With Jared paid like a 1.4 million
so that 14 victims get 100,000 each.

4428
01:57:00,671 --> 01:57:01,181
And it was like,

4429
01:57:01,181 --> 01:57:02,014
okay,

4430
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:05,260
so 14 kids who he solicited,

4431
01:57:05,261 --> 01:57:10,261
he offered money for sex to solution
is to pay them each $100,000 out of the

4432
01:57:10,991 --> 01:57:12,610
settlement as shit.

4433
01:57:12,611 --> 01:57:13,110
Just,

4434
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:13,870
you know,

4435
01:57:13,870 --> 01:57:15,790
it's a horrible thing to laugh at,

4436
01:57:15,791 --> 01:57:16,330
but it's like,

4437
01:57:16,330 --> 01:57:18,280
isn't it something wrong with that,

4438
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:20,380
but that's how it's going to go down.

4439
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:20,611
Well,

4440
01:57:20,611 --> 01:57:25,611
it's another parallel that Jared and
bill Cosby or like in that bill Cosby is

4441
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:28,220
undoubtedly a piece of shit.

4442
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:28,611
All right.

4443
01:57:28,611 --> 01:57:29,391
At this point in time,

4444
01:57:29,391 --> 01:57:30,640
anybody that thinks he's not guilty,

4445
01:57:30,710 --> 01:57:31,910
you gotta be crazy.

4446
01:57:31,940 --> 01:57:32,360
Right.

4447
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:33,290
So he's a piece of shit,

4448
01:57:33,410 --> 01:57:36,070
but he's also one of the
greatest comics of all time.

4449
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:36,250
Yeah.

4450
01:57:36,250 --> 01:57:39,440
You can't take that away from
him and Jared from subway,

4451
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:42,310
he still lost a hundred
pounds and I what to say?

4452
01:57:42,311 --> 01:57:42,841
He's hard.

4453
01:57:42,841 --> 01:57:43,010
Yeah.

4454
01:57:43,010 --> 01:57:44,060
It's hard to lose a hundred pounds.

4455
01:57:44,061 --> 01:57:45,260
He might've fucked a few kids,

4456
01:57:45,590 --> 01:57:48,420
but that guy lost a hundred pounds and uh,

4457
01:57:48,500 --> 01:57:50,180
he did it eat and shitty sandwiches.

4458
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:50,570
Yeah.

4459
01:57:50,570 --> 01:57:51,800
So it's even more impressive.

4460
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:54,193
I mean,

4461
01:57:54,230 --> 01:57:54,920
when you eat,

4462
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:57,410
if you're eating subway sandwiches
and still losing a hundred pounds,

4463
01:57:57,411 --> 01:57:58,790
you're fucking put in some work bed.

4464
01:57:58,820 --> 01:57:59,660
It's running uphill.

4465
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:00,830
Jared gets to say,

4466
01:58:00,831 --> 01:58:00,981
well,

4467
01:58:00,981 --> 01:58:02,660
I've got one thing in common Cosby,

4468
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:05,300
like if not really not,

4469
01:58:05,390 --> 01:58:06,020
no,

4470
01:58:06,020 --> 01:58:06,860
nothing in common.

4471
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:08,630
What a fucking freak.

4472
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:10,940
What a fucking freaky creep.

4473
01:58:12,580 --> 01:58:13,121
And again,

4474
01:58:13,121 --> 01:58:16,390
nobody knew it when his best
friend was like a pedophile.

4475
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:19,570
How did his best friend
come out as a pedophile?

4476
01:58:19,571 --> 01:58:20,230
Is that recent?

4477
01:58:20,230 --> 01:58:21,220
Is that a recent discovery?

4478
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:22,061
That's how they,

4479
01:58:22,061 --> 01:58:22,894
that's how they,

4480
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:24,840
I found him was through his best friend.

4481
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:27,600
I don't know when they knew
it about his best friend,

4482
01:58:27,601 --> 01:58:32,601
but his best friend like ran his charity
organization and I don't know if his

4483
01:58:33,031 --> 01:58:36,150
friend was a registered sex
offender or when it came up,

4484
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:37,253
but that's how they,

4485
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:38,880
that's what led to Jared first,

4486
01:58:38,881 --> 01:58:39,451
the friend.

4487
01:58:39,451 --> 01:58:41,350
And then rarely.

4488
01:58:41,410 --> 01:58:42,243
Yeah,

4489
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:43,150
I did not know that.

4490
01:58:43,890 --> 01:58:44,590
Yeah.

4491
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:45,550
Now that you're saying that.

4492
01:58:45,551 --> 01:58:48,610
I remember briefly by the time I was,

4493
01:58:48,970 --> 01:58:50,110
it was on my radar.

4494
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:51,310
He was already arrested.

4495
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:51,720
Yeah.

4496
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:52,870
And he was already going to jail.

4497
01:58:53,230 --> 01:58:53,471
No,

4498
01:58:53,471 --> 01:58:58,270
I first heard about it when his friend
got arrested and they would like this guy

4499
01:58:58,271 --> 01:59:03,271
runs Jareds charity organization and I
don't know if he had anything to do with

4500
01:59:03,911 --> 01:59:04,570
kids.

4501
01:59:04,570 --> 01:59:05,530
Like if it was like,

4502
01:59:05,980 --> 01:59:06,311
you know,

4503
01:59:06,311 --> 01:59:07,900
little league or whatever,

4504
01:59:07,901 --> 01:59:10,840
but there was something
wrong with this guy.

4505
01:59:10,841 --> 01:59:15,841
Being involved in a charity and helping
children does no worse cause they're

4506
01:59:16,061 --> 01:59:17,080
both awful.

4507
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:19,180
But somehow it is worse.

4508
01:59:19,210 --> 01:59:23,110
Somehow fucking kids is worse than drug
and people and having sex with them.

4509
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:23,810
Yeah.

4510
01:59:23,810 --> 01:59:24,490
It,

4511
01:59:24,490 --> 01:59:25,340
I mean when you do it,

4512
01:59:25,341 --> 01:59:26,230
it's all worse.

4513
01:59:26,540 --> 01:59:27,610
It's all sick.

4514
01:59:27,611 --> 01:59:31,030
But I think the thing about
kids is like kids aren't sexual.

4515
01:59:31,150 --> 01:59:31,983
Yeah.

4516
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:32,411
You know,

4517
01:59:32,411 --> 01:59:34,720
women are women like it.

4518
01:59:34,780 --> 01:59:37,210
If you have a sexual attraction to women,

4519
01:59:37,240 --> 01:59:38,350
that is normal.

4520
01:59:38,370 --> 01:59:40,090
I mean drugging them
and raping them isn't,

4521
01:59:40,091 --> 01:59:41,350
but they are women.

4522
01:59:42,190 --> 01:59:43,090
But with kids,

4523
01:59:43,091 --> 01:59:45,760
there's nothing sexual about a kid.

4524
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:46,180
Well,

4525
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:47,350
how old were,

4526
01:59:47,351 --> 01:59:49,330
they didn't have sex
with some 15 year olds.

4527
01:59:50,110 --> 01:59:50,943
Asexual.

4528
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:51,941
They might've been,

4529
01:59:51,941 --> 01:59:52,750
but I think some,

4530
01:59:52,750 --> 01:59:53,290
I don't know.

4531
01:59:53,290 --> 01:59:53,950
Well they,

4532
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:54,783
they only,

4533
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:57,820
part of his plea was only one count.

4534
01:59:58,600 --> 01:59:59,500
So he don't like,

4535
01:59:59,501 --> 02:00:00,071
in other words,

4536
02:00:00,071 --> 02:00:01,720
they're only charging them what one,

4537
02:00:01,750 --> 02:00:03,520
even though there were others involved.

4538
02:00:04,390 --> 02:00:07,840
So do you know what's even
so you know something,

4539
02:00:07,841 --> 02:00:08,890
you know what's funny about that?

4540
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:12,490
Like he's talking about a 15 year old
and like we were talking about this the

4541
02:00:12,491 --> 02:00:13,180
other night,

4542
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:13,511
you know,

4543
02:00:13,511 --> 02:00:14,080
like when,

4544
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:14,540
when uh,

4545
02:00:14,540 --> 02:00:18,700
the 50 year old guy has the 16 year old,

4546
02:00:18,701 --> 02:00:20,620
like a 15,

4547
02:00:20,621 --> 02:00:22,420
six year old girl could be hot,

4548
02:00:22,421 --> 02:00:24,640
but she still 15 or 16.

4549
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:25,900
If you're an adult man,

4550
02:00:25,901 --> 02:00:26,650
if you're,

4551
02:00:26,650 --> 02:00:28,570
if you're over 20,

4552
02:00:28,571 --> 02:00:29,440
21 late,

4553
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:33,100
you still like 18 and a
girl 16 that makes sense.

4554
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:34,360
If you're 48,

4555
02:00:34,870 --> 02:00:35,350
yeah,

4556
02:00:35,350 --> 02:00:36,100
she's a kid.

4557
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:36,650
That's a baby.

4558
02:00:36,650 --> 02:00:38,470
She's a kid that she may have developed.

4559
02:00:38,471 --> 02:00:39,760
She may have the body,

4560
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:40,960
she may,

4561
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,320
you know,

4562
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:42,820
walk around half naked.

4563
02:00:42,850 --> 02:00:43,750
Don't be alone with her,

4564
02:00:43,790 --> 02:00:47,470
but you can't get out of the room.

4565
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:48,610
It's still a kid.

4566
02:00:48,611 --> 02:00:49,510
It just doesn't,

4567
02:00:49,540 --> 02:00:50,373
you know,

4568
02:00:51,190 --> 02:00:52,770
the problem on the same day,

4569
02:00:53,470 --> 02:00:55,510
five instincts are horrible.

4570
02:00:55,840 --> 02:00:56,860
Instincts are horrible.

4571
02:00:56,861 --> 02:00:57,521
If you got a girl,

4572
02:00:57,521 --> 02:01:00,700
like that girl I was talking about in
Houston that Ian and I met Ted at this

4573
02:01:00,701 --> 02:01:01,421
tiny waist,

4574
02:01:01,421 --> 02:01:02,740
this big juicy ass,

4575
02:01:02,741 --> 02:01:04,090
like she was a grown woman.

4576
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:04,900
But if she was,

4577
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:08,310
she's probably built like that when
she was 14 I had a buddy he used,

4578
02:01:08,480 --> 02:01:08,860
he,

4579
02:01:08,860 --> 02:01:09,970
he's a principal now,

4580
02:01:09,971 --> 02:01:14,971
but he taught high school when he was
like 2124 so he's the guy that 16 and 17

4581
02:01:18,371 --> 02:01:18,881
year old girls,

4582
02:01:18,881 --> 02:01:20,850
they want him because he's,

4583
02:01:20,851 --> 02:01:21,730
and it was like,

4584
02:01:21,731 --> 02:01:22,564
man,

4585
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:24,040
I don't know how you do it.

4586
02:01:24,340 --> 02:01:28,900
I don't know how you do it because these
girls are coming at you hard and their,

4587
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:32,170
their bodies are perfect
and they're wearing nothing.

4588
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:33,071
You know what I mean?

4589
02:01:33,071 --> 02:01:34,570
Cause there's 16 right.

4590
02:01:34,571 --> 02:01:35,271
So there were it.

4591
02:01:35,271 --> 02:01:36,104
And it's like,

4592
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:37,713
and,

4593
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,380
and they're just starting
to be aware of it.

4594
02:01:39,410 --> 02:01:39,860
Yeah.

4595
02:01:39,860 --> 02:01:40,191
Yeah.

4596
02:01:40,191 --> 02:01:40,521
And they,

4597
02:01:40,521 --> 02:01:41,660
and he's a man,

4598
02:01:41,661 --> 02:01:41,870
like,

4599
02:01:41,870 --> 02:01:43,610
he's not the 17 year old boy.

4600
02:01:43,611 --> 02:01:44,600
Like he's a man,

4601
02:01:44,601 --> 02:01:46,610
but he's not an old man.

4602
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:48,260
Like he's not old,

4603
02:01:48,261 --> 02:01:49,250
creepy guy.

4604
02:01:49,610 --> 02:01:52,150
And the only a few
months away from legally.

4605
02:01:52,151 --> 02:01:53,030
Oh Man,

4606
02:01:53,031 --> 02:01:53,300
I,

4607
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:54,050
he,

4608
02:01:54,050 --> 02:01:55,250
he was a better man than me.

4609
02:01:55,251 --> 02:01:55,610
I was like,

4610
02:01:55,610 --> 02:01:56,443
I couldn't,

4611
02:01:56,780 --> 02:01:57,710
let me tell you something.

4612
02:01:57,711 --> 02:02:01,520
When in my early twenties I
have to work at a high school.

4613
02:02:03,020 --> 02:02:04,820
When I was in high school,

4614
02:02:04,821 --> 02:02:07,590
there was this kid that was
a not kid guy would be a kid.

4615
02:02:07,591 --> 02:02:09,350
Now if I was talking about him
because he was in his twenties,

4616
02:02:09,351 --> 02:02:11,420
he's a Spanish teacher and uh,

4617
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:12,590
he fucked one of my friends.

4618
02:02:12,980 --> 02:02:14,300
She was 15 she was,

4619
02:02:14,301 --> 02:02:14,600
uh,

4620
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:16,250
at the time I think,

4621
02:02:16,450 --> 02:02:18,890
I actually think she was 17 but still,

4622
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:19,550
you know,

4623
02:02:19,550 --> 02:02:20,383
he was fucking her.

4624
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:24,680
She was in high school and he was a
Spanish teacher and he was fucking hard.

4625
02:02:24,710 --> 02:02:25,371
It happens.

4626
02:02:25,371 --> 02:02:26,780
And this is pre internet.

4627
02:02:27,380 --> 02:02:28,310
She couldn't ran them out.

4628
02:02:28,520 --> 02:02:28,821
Yeah,

4629
02:02:28,821 --> 02:02:30,830
but it's not pre dad got a gun.

4630
02:02:32,820 --> 02:02:33,570
Yeah.

4631
02:02:33,570 --> 02:02:34,403
Yeah.

4632
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:38,900
It's not pre dad got a gun cause that's
some shit that they will not convict

4633
02:02:38,901 --> 02:02:39,140
you.

4634
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:39,321
Well,

4635
02:02:39,321 --> 02:02:41,300
ages of consent are very strange man.

4636
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:41,540
It's,

4637
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:42,110
it gets,

4638
02:02:42,110 --> 02:02:42,621
and there's also,

4639
02:02:42,621 --> 02:02:45,800
it's a weird gray areas that
come along with ages of consent.

4640
02:02:45,801 --> 02:02:45,951
Like,

4641
02:02:45,951 --> 02:02:50,450
here's one of the issues that's happening
right now with kids and technology is

4642
02:02:50,451 --> 02:02:54,890
that young people are taking photographs
of themselves naked and passing it out

4643
02:02:54,891 --> 02:02:58,610
to their friends and then getting
busted for child pornography.

4644
02:02:58,770 --> 02:03:03,020
Like there was a girl that she's 15 years
old and she would send dude's pictures

4645
02:03:03,021 --> 02:03:04,820
of her pussy and uh,

4646
02:03:04,821 --> 02:03:05,130
you know,

4647
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:08,090
just what it sent it to
them in text messages.

4648
02:03:08,660 --> 02:03:13,660
The cops arrested her and charged her
with trafficking child pornography to

4649
02:03:13,941 --> 02:03:14,810
other children.

4650
02:03:14,830 --> 02:03:15,000
Yeah.

4651
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:15,560
That's,

4652
02:03:15,560 --> 02:03:18,020
it's one of those that if
they want to bring you down,

4653
02:03:18,021 --> 02:03:19,430
they can use that charge.

4654
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:20,293
But they couldn't,

4655
02:03:20,300 --> 02:03:20,780
they was,

4656
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:22,760
she wound up getting cleared of
it because the judge was like,

4657
02:03:22,761 --> 02:03:23,001
wait,

4658
02:03:23,001 --> 02:03:24,260
what the fuck are you doing?

4659
02:03:24,310 --> 02:03:24,401
Right?

4660
02:03:24,401 --> 02:03:24,891
Like what do you,

4661
02:03:24,891 --> 02:03:25,090
why,

4662
02:03:25,090 --> 02:03:27,200
how coming out there arresting robbers.

4663
02:03:27,590 --> 02:03:31,010
Like why you trying to stop a young girl
from showing a picture of her pussy?

4664
02:03:31,180 --> 02:03:31,450
Yeah.

4665
02:03:31,450 --> 02:03:32,283
It's um,

4666
02:03:32,300 --> 02:03:33,410
it's one of those things,

4667
02:03:33,570 --> 02:03:34,101
like I said,

4668
02:03:34,101 --> 02:03:35,630
they can charge them with it.

4669
02:03:35,631 --> 02:03:36,680
They don't always,

4670
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:37,941
but there's a time,

4671
02:03:37,941 --> 02:03:39,590
like if they want to bring you down,

4672
02:03:39,740 --> 02:03:40,340
they can.

4673
02:03:40,340 --> 02:03:43,190
I think it's one of those things
they used as a threat against you,

4674
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:44,181
but again,

4675
02:03:44,181 --> 02:03:45,080
it's just,

4676
02:03:45,890 --> 02:03:46,251
you know,

4677
02:03:46,251 --> 02:03:50,000
I do not want any 15 year old
pussy pictures on my phone.

4678
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:51,021
I don't,

4679
02:03:51,021 --> 02:03:53,720
you know how you hear me joke
about it like they're young.

4680
02:03:53,721 --> 02:03:54,171
No,

4681
02:03:54,171 --> 02:03:54,561
I don't.

4682
02:03:54,561 --> 02:03:55,670
Too much trouble.

4683
02:03:55,820 --> 02:03:56,390
Yeah.

4684
02:03:56,390 --> 02:03:57,620
Too much drama,

4685
02:03:57,650 --> 02:03:58,610
energy,

4686
02:03:58,790 --> 02:03:59,480
whatever.

4687
02:03:59,480 --> 02:03:59,870
Nope.

4688
02:03:59,870 --> 02:04:00,051
No,

4689
02:04:00,051 --> 02:04:00,800
thanks.

4690
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:03,730
I got a friend who's a dentist
and he's in his 50s and,

4691
02:04:03,731 --> 02:04:03,860
uh,

4692
02:04:03,860 --> 02:04:05,060
he's divorced and,

4693
02:04:05,061 --> 02:04:05,570
uh,

4694
02:04:05,570 --> 02:04:06,710
he's talking about dating.

4695
02:04:06,740 --> 02:04:06,931
We're,

4696
02:04:06,931 --> 02:04:08,700
we're talking about it and I go,

4697
02:04:08,701 --> 02:04:09,380
uh,

4698
02:04:09,380 --> 02:04:09,711
I go,

4699
02:04:09,711 --> 02:04:10,810
do you like what,

4700
02:04:10,820 --> 02:04:12,320
how old did the other
girls that you dated?

4701
02:04:12,321 --> 02:04:12,561
He goes,

4702
02:04:12,561 --> 02:04:13,220
well,

4703
02:04:13,220 --> 02:04:14,053
here's the thing.

4704
02:04:14,210 --> 02:04:14,631
And it goes,

4705
02:04:14,631 --> 02:04:16,340
I don't mind a mature lady.

4706
02:04:16,490 --> 02:04:16,791
And he goes,

4707
02:04:16,791 --> 02:04:17,350
I don't mind them.

4708
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:18,390
A lady my age,

4709
02:04:18,391 --> 02:04:18,651
she goes,

4710
02:04:18,651 --> 02:04:19,070
I'm a,

4711
02:04:19,070 --> 02:04:20,450
I'm not a young guy anymore.

4712
02:04:20,570 --> 02:04:20,991
And it was,

4713
02:04:20,991 --> 02:04:22,280
I'm 58 years old.

4714
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:22,941
He goes,

4715
02:04:22,941 --> 02:04:25,700
I just looking for some Nice
company and go to dinner.

4716
02:04:25,970 --> 02:04:26,391
And he goes,

4717
02:04:26,391 --> 02:04:27,380
but he goes,

4718
02:04:27,381 --> 02:04:28,640
there's two different things going on.

4719
02:04:28,690 --> 02:04:28,971
He goes,

4720
02:04:28,971 --> 02:04:31,880
you've got the younger ones that are
like in their thirties they just want to

4721
02:04:31,881 --> 02:04:33,080
fuck he lives.

4722
02:04:33,081 --> 02:04:33,741
They want to fuck.

4723
02:04:33,741 --> 02:04:35,600
And then they want to get
out of there and he goes,

4724
02:04:35,610 --> 02:04:36,680
then you get the older ones,

4725
02:04:36,681 --> 02:04:37,200
they want,

4726
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:38,040
they want to settle down,

4727
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:39,780
but they want everything to be their way.

4728
02:04:39,850 --> 02:04:40,150
Yeah.

4729
02:04:40,150 --> 02:04:41,070
Cause they're all like,

4730
02:04:41,071 --> 02:04:41,851
they're in their forties.

4731
02:04:41,851 --> 02:04:42,401
He's a grown.

4732
02:04:42,401 --> 02:04:42,531
What?

4733
02:04:42,531 --> 02:04:43,560
They're not malleable,

4734
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:44,461
you know.

4735
02:04:44,461 --> 02:04:45,121
And that was interesting.

4736
02:04:45,121 --> 02:04:46,380
He was talking about how he goes,

4737
02:04:46,890 --> 02:04:48,420
these women are set in their ways.

4738
02:04:48,570 --> 02:04:49,500
Well I'm that guy,

4739
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:50,191
you know,

4740
02:04:50,191 --> 02:04:50,491
I'm the,

4741
02:04:50,491 --> 02:04:53,430
I'm the old bachelor and a yeah,

4742
02:04:53,670 --> 02:04:53,880

4743
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:55,500
how will do you know I'm 53?

4744
02:04:55,950 --> 02:04:56,191
Damn.

4745
02:04:56,191 --> 02:04:56,950
You look good.

4746
02:04:56,950 --> 02:04:58,470
Black don't crack black.

4747
02:04:58,471 --> 02:04:59,050
Don't crack.

4748
02:04:59,050 --> 02:05:00,690
It's just badly one day.

4749
02:05:01,790 --> 02:05:03,900
But you look great for 53 though,

4750
02:05:03,901 --> 02:05:04,500
man.

4751
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:06,420
Seriously post for 35 easy.

4752
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:09,450
The girls in their twenties,

4753
02:05:09,451 --> 02:05:10,500
it's just too young.

4754
02:05:10,530 --> 02:05:10,980
Like,

4755
02:05:10,980 --> 02:05:12,840
like on occasion,

4756
02:05:13,110 --> 02:05:16,500
if I get some 20 year old
pussy is a gift from the gods.

4757
02:05:16,510 --> 02:05:16,780
Yeah.

4758
02:05:16,780 --> 02:05:17,551
God was like,

4759
02:05:17,551 --> 02:05:17,881
all right,

4760
02:05:17,881 --> 02:05:18,571
I'm going to give you this.

4761
02:05:18,571 --> 02:05:19,620
Don't get attached to it,

4762
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:21,593
you know,

4763
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:24,060
just enjoy the day.

4764
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:25,080
But no kids,

4765
02:05:25,230 --> 02:05:25,441
no,

4766
02:05:25,441 --> 02:05:26,100
no kids.

4767
02:05:26,100 --> 02:05:26,490
Wow.

4768
02:05:26,490 --> 02:05:27,150
How'd you do that?

4769
02:05:27,150 --> 02:05:27,451
So,

4770
02:05:27,451 --> 02:05:28,020
uh,

4771
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:29,190
started comedy late,

4772
02:05:29,730 --> 02:05:31,290
started comedy at 30.

4773
02:05:31,830 --> 02:05:32,940
So in my thirties,

4774
02:05:32,941 --> 02:05:34,970
when most people have
kids and so religious,

4775
02:05:34,980 --> 02:05:36,650
I was an open miker well,

4776
02:05:36,651 --> 02:05:40,200
I did not want the obligation of a family.

4777
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:41,280
You know,

4778
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:41,971
it's hard,

4779
02:05:41,971 --> 02:05:42,300
man.

4780
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:46,860
I have a friend who is married and he
has children and he's just starting out

4781
02:05:46,861 --> 02:05:49,550
doing comedy and he doesn't
know what to do and he,

4782
02:05:49,551 --> 02:05:50,550
he can't,

4783
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:52,230
he can't struggle the way we struggled.

4784
02:05:52,270 --> 02:05:52,710
Right.

4785
02:05:52,710 --> 02:05:55,530
He can't go and just
do a set for 75 bucks,

4786
02:05:55,740 --> 02:05:56,940
five hour drive away,

4787
02:05:57,150 --> 02:05:58,010
all that shit.

4788
02:05:58,020 --> 02:05:58,860
You can't do all that.

4789
02:05:58,861 --> 02:05:59,790
So that was,

4790
02:05:59,791 --> 02:06:00,720
so that was that.

4791
02:06:01,200 --> 02:06:02,033
But uh,

4792
02:06:02,370 --> 02:06:02,851
but you know,

4793
02:06:02,851 --> 02:06:03,390
dating,

4794
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:07,320
like I started seeing this woman and
she's in her late forties and it's

4795
02:06:07,321 --> 02:06:10,170
fantastic because she's got a son,

4796
02:06:10,171 --> 02:06:10,670
but he's,

4797
02:06:10,670 --> 02:06:11,040
you know,

4798
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:12,960
almost like he's in his late teens,

4799
02:06:12,961 --> 02:06:14,490
so that's not a big hassle.

4800
02:06:14,490 --> 02:06:15,510
And she's a woman.

4801
02:06:15,511 --> 02:06:19,560
She's comfortable with who she is
and everything's cool and stuff.

4802
02:06:19,561 --> 02:06:20,520
But um,

4803
02:06:21,600 --> 02:06:21,871
yeah.

4804
02:06:21,871 --> 02:06:23,090
And then you get some,

4805
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:28,580
the worst ones for me early to mid
thirties when the date is an interview.

4806
02:06:30,630 --> 02:06:31,740
It's like,

4807
02:06:31,980 --> 02:06:35,310
so it's like you do find the right girl.

4808
02:06:36,180 --> 02:06:37,950
How long do you think it would
be before you got married?

4809
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:38,400
Yeah.

4810
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:38,900
Yeah.

4811
02:06:38,900 --> 02:06:39,210
Um,

4812
02:06:39,210 --> 02:06:40,590
so why don't you have kids?

4813
02:06:40,591 --> 02:06:41,490
Are you open to it?

4814
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:42,510
Do you think about it?

4815
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:42,810
Not,

4816
02:06:42,810 --> 02:06:43,201
you know,

4817
02:06:43,201 --> 02:06:43,471
blah,

4818
02:06:43,471 --> 02:06:44,304
blah blah.

4819
02:06:45,510 --> 02:06:46,180
Uh,

4820
02:06:46,180 --> 02:06:47,100
I tell him like,

4821
02:06:47,101 --> 02:06:47,370
look,

4822
02:06:47,370 --> 02:06:48,390
it just didn't,

4823
02:06:48,690 --> 02:06:50,490
I didn't have the right
one at the right time.

4824
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:50,791
I said,

4825
02:06:50,791 --> 02:06:52,560
now I'm open to it.

4826
02:06:52,561 --> 02:06:53,191
It could happen,

4827
02:06:53,191 --> 02:06:55,410
but I'm not really looking
at being an old dead,

4828
02:06:56,070 --> 02:06:56,371
you know,

4829
02:06:56,371 --> 02:07:00,000
I joke about it like if I
have a kid now when he's 16,

4830
02:07:00,001 --> 02:07:01,530
if I say you can't have the car,

4831
02:07:01,531 --> 02:07:01,951
and he says,

4832
02:07:01,951 --> 02:07:02,281
yes,

4833
02:07:02,281 --> 02:07:03,030
I can.

4834
02:07:03,030 --> 02:07:06,930
There ain't shit I'm going to be able
to do like son of a bitch took my car,

4835
02:07:08,490 --> 02:07:09,630
me 69.

4836
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:11,650
It's took my car,

4837
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:13,010
look at this,

4838
02:07:13,010 --> 02:07:14,610
the loan at 69.

4839
02:07:14,611 --> 02:07:15,900
He's fucking yolk still.

4840
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:16,400
Yeah.

4841
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:16,690
Yeah.

4842
02:07:16,690 --> 02:07:18,150
So I'll just do it.

4843
02:07:18,270 --> 02:07:18,781
And Dana,

4844
02:07:18,781 --> 02:07:21,310
Jim Smoking crack and
fucking hit those weights.

4845
02:07:21,690 --> 02:07:23,810
Some guys do it and
some guys have the APP.

4846
02:07:23,860 --> 02:07:24,810
I could have it,

4847
02:07:24,811 --> 02:07:25,350
you know,

4848
02:07:25,350 --> 02:07:26,880
like they say you could have as a man,

4849
02:07:26,881 --> 02:07:30,080
you could always have a kid
but do you want to and uh,

4850
02:07:31,290 --> 02:07:35,500
I think now it would be more likely like
if I met a woman who had a young kid

4851
02:07:35,501 --> 02:07:40,180
and I took him on as a
stepchild or something like
that would be more likely to

4852
02:07:40,181 --> 02:07:40,630
happen.

4853
02:07:40,630 --> 02:07:41,351
How crazy is that?

4854
02:07:41,351 --> 02:07:43,540
Your 53 and Joey's 52.

4855
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:45,273
Yeah,

4856
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:47,333
that's living,

4857
02:07:47,950 --> 02:07:48,760
living.

4858
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:50,490
That's fucking hard.

4859
02:07:50,510 --> 02:07:51,910
Miles man.

4860
02:07:51,911 --> 02:07:54,200
You know something we'll
all be gone and Joel,

4861
02:07:54,210 --> 02:07:56,510
you'll still be here and probably like,

4862
02:07:56,540 --> 02:07:57,720
like that's how it is.

4863
02:07:58,070 --> 02:07:58,360
You know?

4864
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:01,410
That's how it happens
isn't a true with comics.

4865
02:08:01,420 --> 02:08:04,660
The comics either die too
young or live forever.

4866
02:08:05,340 --> 02:08:06,220
You have a lot of them,

4867
02:08:06,221 --> 02:08:06,520
right?

4868
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:06,941
You don't,

4869
02:08:06,941 --> 02:08:08,650
you don't hear about a comic dying.

4870
02:08:08,651 --> 02:08:10,150
It's 68 years old.

4871
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:11,260
That's true.

4872
02:08:11,260 --> 02:08:11,640
Yeah.

4873
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:13,690
It's laughter's the best medicine.

4874
02:08:13,691 --> 02:08:15,160
Like that idea is a,

4875
02:08:15,161 --> 02:08:18,820
I think there is something real about
the fact that you're making people laugh

4876
02:08:18,821 --> 02:08:19,211
all the time.

4877
02:08:19,211 --> 02:08:20,200
You're having a good time,

4878
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:21,790
a lot of laughter and fun.

4879
02:08:21,791 --> 02:08:25,180
I mean we have more
laughs on a regular basis.

4880
02:08:25,181 --> 02:08:27,580
Then a great percentage of the people.

4881
02:08:27,640 --> 02:08:27,850
Yeah.

4882
02:08:27,850 --> 02:08:30,040
Because our friends are the
funniest people at world.

4883
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:31,980
I give you and I like you and I,

4884
02:08:32,070 --> 02:08:32,680
the other night,

4885
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:34,840
Tuesday night hanging
out at the laugh factory,

4886
02:08:34,841 --> 02:08:37,420
we were just how and laugh and just how,

4887
02:08:39,490 --> 02:08:40,660
and then you leave there.

4888
02:08:40,661 --> 02:08:41,920
Your whole body's like,

4889
02:08:41,970 --> 02:08:42,401
ah,

4890
02:08:42,401 --> 02:08:46,540
you're energized and you do that all
the time and there's nothing terrible.

4891
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:48,010
I mean our whole work day was like,

4892
02:08:48,011 --> 02:08:49,420
we both did 20 minutes said,

4893
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:50,561
well this is it.

4894
02:08:50,561 --> 02:08:51,311
Like people ask me,

4895
02:08:51,311 --> 02:08:52,070
what are you doing?

4896
02:08:52,070 --> 02:08:53,560
Well I'm doing Joe's podcasts.

4897
02:08:53,561 --> 02:08:55,210
Like that's my just my job today.

4898
02:08:55,540 --> 02:08:55,900
But the,

4899
02:08:55,900 --> 02:08:58,660
I think the other thing
is we don't stop doing it.

4900
02:08:58,870 --> 02:08:59,703
Yeah.

4901
02:08:59,830 --> 02:09:00,161
You know,

4902
02:09:00,161 --> 02:09:01,840
cause like my business manager,

4903
02:09:01,841 --> 02:09:02,351
she's like,

4904
02:09:02,351 --> 02:09:02,561
well,

4905
02:09:02,561 --> 02:09:02,831
you know,

4906
02:09:02,831 --> 02:09:05,080
we got this retirement
thing set up and this,

4907
02:09:05,081 --> 02:09:05,501
and I said,

4908
02:09:05,501 --> 02:09:06,250
really?

4909
02:09:06,250 --> 02:09:08,050
When have you ever heard
of a comic retiring?

4910
02:09:08,051 --> 02:09:08,281
She's like,

4911
02:09:08,281 --> 02:09:08,471
what are you?

4912
02:09:08,471 --> 02:09:08,770
I said,

4913
02:09:08,770 --> 02:09:09,590
we die.

4914
02:09:09,590 --> 02:09:10,151
It's what we do.

4915
02:09:10,151 --> 02:09:11,880
We do this and then we die.

4916
02:09:11,970 --> 02:09:14,800
We might work last what you find,

4917
02:09:14,830 --> 02:09:16,240
you'll find a different niche.

4918
02:09:16,241 --> 02:09:16,481
Like,

4919
02:09:16,481 --> 02:09:20,710
it may end up doing the old
folks home circuit in Florida,

4920
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:21,791
you know,

4921
02:09:21,791 --> 02:09:24,910
but I'm still going to be doing my
20 minute spots at seven o'clock.

4922
02:09:26,230 --> 02:09:27,520
I look at Carlin,

4923
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:29,230
I'm doing 20 after Jello,

4924
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:32,830
didn't come and die in a hotel
room somewhere on the road,

4925
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:33,880
you know,

4926
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:34,990
died in his hotel room.

4927
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:35,170
Well,

4928
02:09:35,170 --> 02:09:35,561
even,

4929
02:09:35,561 --> 02:09:36,100
um,

4930
02:09:36,100 --> 02:09:36,581
what's his name?

4931
02:09:36,581 --> 02:09:37,414
George Burns.

4932
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:38,890
Like he died at a hundred,

4933
02:09:38,891 --> 02:09:42,920
but like he did his last set at his
hundredth birthday or something like,

4934
02:09:42,950 --> 02:09:43,541
you know what I mean?

4935
02:09:43,541 --> 02:09:44,374
Like,

4936
02:09:44,450 --> 02:09:44,760
and,

4937
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:45,551
and I remember,

4938
02:09:45,551 --> 02:09:46,570
I remember when,

4939
02:09:46,571 --> 02:09:47,404
um,

4940
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:49,870
when Rodney was coming
to the left factory,

4941
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:51,250
you know,

4942
02:09:51,250 --> 02:09:52,900
and in his last days,

4943
02:09:52,901 --> 02:09:55,210
Rodney was coming to the
laugh factory in a bathrobe.

4944
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:56,180
Yup.

4945
02:09:56,180 --> 02:09:57,100
I remember that.

4946
02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:00,220
He would just come down the
hill from his house in his robe.

4947
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:00,640
Well,

4948
02:10:00,640 --> 02:10:01,360
he go home.

4949
02:10:01,360 --> 02:10:03,250
Stay front of arenas in a bathrobe.

4950
02:10:03,310 --> 02:10:03,910
Yeah.

4951
02:10:03,910 --> 02:10:07,570
I was working when I was 19 years old
at Great Woods in Mount Mansfield,

4952
02:10:07,571 --> 02:10:08,171
Massachusetts.

4953
02:10:08,171 --> 02:10:08,711
It's like this,

4954
02:10:08,711 --> 02:10:10,120
a performing arts center.

4955
02:10:10,390 --> 02:10:11,440
And I was backstage,

4956
02:10:11,441 --> 02:10:15,100
I was one of the security
guards and Rodney was backstage
and I watched him walk

4957
02:10:15,101 --> 02:10:16,030
around with a bathrobe on,

4958
02:10:16,360 --> 02:10:17,680
well that's how Rickles was.

4959
02:10:17,681 --> 02:10:18,820
But that's because of that.

4960
02:10:18,850 --> 02:10:22,720
Back in the day you didn't put your
pants on because you would mess up the

4961
02:10:22,721 --> 02:10:23,554
crease.

4962
02:10:23,950 --> 02:10:25,110
So we were doing,

4963
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:25,441
yes.

4964
02:10:25,441 --> 02:10:26,260
So when we,

4965
02:10:26,260 --> 02:10:26,620
um,

4966
02:10:26,620 --> 02:10:28,510
there was a Seinfeld episode about that,

4967
02:10:28,511 --> 02:10:29,710
but it really is true.

4968
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:33,890
When Rickles was backstage
in Montreal was in a rope,

4969
02:10:34,370 --> 02:10:35,810
I'm going to start performing in a robe.

4970
02:10:36,260 --> 02:10:36,481
No,

4971
02:10:36,481 --> 02:10:37,314
he fuck it.

4972
02:10:38,150 --> 02:10:39,370
Fuck it out of.

4973
02:10:39,420 --> 02:10:40,253
I Dunno.

4974
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:41,593
I Dunno.

4975
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:43,040
I Dunno if you're a robe guy.

4976
02:10:43,041 --> 02:10:43,874
Slippers,

4977
02:10:43,910 --> 02:10:44,743
a robe.

4978
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:45,150
No,

4979
02:10:45,150 --> 02:10:45,983
no one's aware.

4980
02:10:46,030 --> 02:10:46,170
I,

4981
02:10:46,170 --> 02:10:46,761
it's slippery.

4982
02:10:46,761 --> 02:10:47,594
Where do you buy?

4983
02:10:48,530 --> 02:10:52,040
I think you can only get slippers
for the month before Christmas.

4984
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:57,380
That's the only time
slippers are for sale.

4985
02:10:57,470 --> 02:10:59,150
I guess he get them online.

4986
02:11:00,990 --> 02:11:03,080
I don't see a store that sells slippers.

4987
02:11:03,170 --> 02:11:03,531
He doing,

4988
02:11:03,531 --> 02:11:04,311
I'm going online.

4989
02:11:04,311 --> 02:11:05,360
I'm looking for slippers.

4990
02:11:05,750 --> 02:11:06,290
You know,

4991
02:11:06,290 --> 02:11:09,940
Rodney was party until
the fucking very end too.

4992
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:11,870
That was one of the things
that people said about Rodney.

4993
02:11:12,050 --> 02:11:15,680
He was doing blow and drinking
and having a great time.

4994
02:11:15,681 --> 02:11:16,700
Smoking joints,

4995
02:11:16,910 --> 02:11:19,850
smoked joints for every
show to the bitter end.

4996
02:11:19,970 --> 02:11:20,540
Why not?

4997
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:21,373
Why not?

4998
02:11:21,610 --> 02:11:22,100
You know,

4999
02:11:22,100 --> 02:11:22,490
cause it,

5000
02:11:22,490 --> 02:11:23,600
cause if you're Rodney,

5001
02:11:23,601 --> 02:11:25,310
you can what?

5002
02:11:25,430 --> 02:11:26,260
Somebody can tell you.

5003
02:11:26,260 --> 02:11:26,660
Aa.

5004
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:27,493
Rodney,

5005
02:11:27,700 --> 02:11:28,221
slow down.

5006
02:11:28,221 --> 02:11:29,960
We don't want your high before this show.

5007
02:11:31,790 --> 02:11:35,690
Well Rodney is one of those crazy stories
too because he took a long time off

5008
02:11:35,750 --> 02:11:37,670
and was like aluminum siding,

5009
02:11:37,671 --> 02:11:38,091
sales.

5010
02:11:38,091 --> 02:11:39,590
Race is family or something.

5011
02:11:39,591 --> 02:11:41,960
And then went back to comedy forties yeah,

5012
02:11:42,050 --> 02:11:47,050
I think it was like 46 when he went back
to comedy and then hit and then did you

5013
02:11:47,661 --> 02:11:50,030
know all those movies
and all that crazy shit?

5014
02:11:50,080 --> 02:11:50,230
Yeah.

5015
02:11:50,230 --> 02:11:53,110
They ran with Rickles
in his robe back stage.

5016
02:11:53,260 --> 02:11:54,830
That's a classic picture.

5017
02:11:55,670 --> 02:11:56,930
Oh my God.

5018
02:11:56,931 --> 02:11:58,220
That is classic.

5019
02:11:58,221 --> 02:11:58,790
Yeah.

5020
02:11:58,790 --> 02:12:00,860
Look at him with a knee high socks.

5021
02:12:01,270 --> 02:12:02,310
Rope Dude.

5022
02:12:02,311 --> 02:12:02,871
Send that to me.

5023
02:12:02,871 --> 02:12:03,920
I want to put that on Instagram.

5024
02:12:03,921 --> 02:12:04,190
Yeah,

5025
02:12:04,190 --> 02:12:05,023
I will.

5026
02:12:05,180 --> 02:12:06,020
That's awesome.

5027
02:12:06,170 --> 02:12:07,070
That's hilarious.

5028
02:12:07,071 --> 02:12:07,904
That was a,

5029
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:08,840
you know,

5030
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:09,890
different generation,

5031
02:12:10,190 --> 02:12:11,180
different generation.

5032
02:12:11,181 --> 02:12:12,560
And someone's going to
be saying that about us.

5033
02:12:12,561 --> 02:12:13,130
I'm the,

5034
02:12:13,130 --> 02:12:13,963
yeah,

5035
02:12:14,200 --> 02:12:15,800
those guys just working t shirts.

5036
02:12:16,910 --> 02:12:17,810
What were they thinking?

5037
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:18,980
Those guys used to,

5038
02:12:19,070 --> 02:12:20,540
there was no internet when they started.

5039
02:12:20,570 --> 02:12:23,630
They had to promote themselves
by going to local radio shows.

5040
02:12:23,940 --> 02:12:24,510
He would be like,

5041
02:12:24,510 --> 02:12:24,860
hey,

5042
02:12:24,860 --> 02:12:26,280
they had radio back then.

5043
02:12:28,460 --> 02:12:30,410
But that works sometimes,

5044
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:30,890
you know,

5045
02:12:30,890 --> 02:12:31,880
if it was a good market,

5046
02:12:31,881 --> 02:12:32,610
if it's a yeah.

5047
02:12:32,610 --> 02:12:33,410
Or if it's,

5048
02:12:33,410 --> 02:12:36,590
if it's the morning guy who's
been there for 30 years,

5049
02:12:37,200 --> 02:12:39,360
if it's a good show today,

5050
02:12:39,380 --> 02:12:40,213
you still have those?

5051
02:12:40,580 --> 02:12:42,780
There's a guy in Rochester weeds.

5052
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:43,520
Oh yeah.

5053
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:46,010
The week he's still around.

5054
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:46,820
Still kicking it.

5055
02:12:46,820 --> 02:12:47,520
Yeah.

5056
02:12:47,520 --> 02:12:47,840
And,

5057
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:49,850
and it's like in the
morning and Rochester,

5058
02:12:49,851 --> 02:12:51,320
everyone listens to brother weeds.

5059
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:54,860
Like you literally go on
there and sell out your show.

5060
02:12:55,070 --> 02:12:55,770
Wow.

5061
02:12:55,770 --> 02:12:56,603
Yeah.

5062
02:12:56,750 --> 02:12:57,830
There's a few of those guys.

5063
02:12:57,831 --> 02:12:59,840
John Dare and Kansas City.

5064
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:00,410
Yeah.

5065
02:13:00,410 --> 02:13:02,030
There's a few of those
guys are still out there.

5066
02:13:02,060 --> 02:13:02,751
They used to be,

5067
02:13:02,751 --> 02:13:03,200
uh,

5068
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:04,730
used to be a good one in Phoenix.

5069
02:13:05,300 --> 02:13:06,200
I wonder if they're still on this.

5070
02:13:06,450 --> 02:13:08,510
This has been a few that like still,

5071
02:13:08,511 --> 02:13:10,200
but it's fucking hard.

5072
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:14,810
The syndicated guys have
taken over the whole country.

5073
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:15,771
Yeah.

5074
02:13:15,771 --> 02:13:18,950
Guys like a Bob and Tom that has
like a hundred different markets or,

5075
02:13:18,951 --> 02:13:19,600
um,

5076
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:20,060
um,

5077
02:13:20,060 --> 02:13:20,660
Steve,

5078
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:20,960
uh,

5079
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:22,630
Steve Harvey does he do that?

5080
02:13:22,630 --> 02:13:22,971
But yeah,

5081
02:13:22,971 --> 02:13:24,290
he's got a big radio show.

5082
02:13:24,291 --> 02:13:25,250
Tom Joiner,

5083
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:26,720
Steve Harvey's one of those dudes.

5084
02:13:26,721 --> 02:13:28,910
Like he's got so many jobs.

5085
02:13:29,180 --> 02:13:32,070
He does so many things that he puts
out a new book like every year.

5086
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:33,420
Does he write those books?

5087
02:13:33,690 --> 02:13:35,460
I think he probably wrote the first one.

5088
02:13:35,461 --> 02:13:36,570
I don't know how much he writes.

5089
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:38,470
I don't know how much more but,

5090
02:13:38,580 --> 02:13:38,961
but they,

5091
02:13:38,961 --> 02:13:39,661
but it's not,

5092
02:13:39,661 --> 02:13:39,871
and,

5093
02:13:39,871 --> 02:13:44,730
and the funny thing is it's
not like any genius advice,

5094
02:13:44,731 --> 02:13:45,570
you know what I mean?

5095
02:13:45,571 --> 02:13:45,811
Like,

5096
02:13:45,811 --> 02:13:45,991
well,

5097
02:13:45,991 --> 02:13:47,370
if you want to keep a good man,

5098
02:13:47,850 --> 02:13:49,980
don't be a whole no,

5099
02:13:50,130 --> 02:13:50,963
like,

5100
02:13:51,310 --> 02:13:52,770
like where your dress a little long,

5101
02:13:52,771 --> 02:13:53,150
it puts,

5102
02:13:53,150 --> 02:13:54,300
put away your whole shoes,

5103
02:13:54,301 --> 02:13:54,631
you know,

5104
02:13:54,631 --> 02:13:55,461
stuff like that.

5105
02:13:55,461 --> 02:13:55,801
It's like,

5106
02:13:55,801 --> 02:13:56,251
Oh yeah,

5107
02:13:56,251 --> 02:13:57,240
I never thought of that.

5108
02:13:58,030 --> 02:13:58,650
Oh,

5109
02:13:58,650 --> 02:14:00,270
so I shouldn't be a Ho.

5110
02:14:00,970 --> 02:14:03,090
He's an odd character that Steve Harvey.

5111
02:14:03,140 --> 02:14:03,460
Yeah,

5112
02:14:03,460 --> 02:14:06,380
I met him once for a loop.

5113
02:14:06,420 --> 02:14:10,050
We joked around a little while he
was hosting the Apollo and I did it.

5114
02:14:10,950 --> 02:14:11,311
And,

5115
02:14:11,311 --> 02:14:12,030
um,

5116
02:14:12,030 --> 02:14:12,661
they was cool,

5117
02:14:12,661 --> 02:14:14,130
but I don't know him,

5118
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:14,611
you know,

5119
02:14:14,611 --> 02:14:15,570
I don't have any,

5120
02:14:16,530 --> 02:14:17,940
any relationship with him.

5121
02:14:17,941 --> 02:14:19,890
I had somebody the other day texted me,

5122
02:14:20,370 --> 02:14:21,000
can I,

5123
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,100
can I get them tickets to Kevin Hart?

5124
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:25,050
Shit,

5125
02:14:25,050 --> 02:14:26,130
I couldn't get me tickets.

5126
02:14:27,660 --> 02:14:28,021
I did.

5127
02:14:28,021 --> 02:14:29,970
I did bt with Kevin Hart once,

5128
02:14:29,971 --> 02:14:30,804
an old one.

5129
02:14:30,810 --> 02:14:32,820
I don't think Kevin's gonna
stop shitting and say,

5130
02:14:32,821 --> 02:14:34,440
Oh fuck Alonzo's at the door.

5131
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:37,201
Well,

5132
02:14:37,201 --> 02:14:38,550
they think that we know everybody,

5133
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:39,070
that,

5134
02:14:39,070 --> 02:14:39,361
you know,

5135
02:14:39,361 --> 02:14:40,000
everybody in this,

5136
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,610
there's so many people in that business.

5137
02:14:41,760 --> 02:14:42,600
But even when you know,

5138
02:14:42,601 --> 02:14:44,520
people at certain times
when it's a little,

5139
02:14:44,521 --> 02:14:47,340
I think it's a little
awkward to hit him up.

5140
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:48,030
Yeah.

5141
02:14:48,030 --> 02:14:48,301
You know,

5142
02:14:48,301 --> 02:14:48,571
like,

5143
02:14:48,571 --> 02:14:53,190
like Chapelle was doing a bunch of
shows in Montreal and I know him,

5144
02:14:53,191 --> 02:14:53,941
I don't know him well,

5145
02:14:53,941 --> 02:14:54,511
but I know him,

5146
02:14:54,511 --> 02:14:55,740
but I just bought tickets.

5147
02:14:55,741 --> 02:14:56,574
I'm not going to,

5148
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:57,601
you know what I mean?

5149
02:14:57,601 --> 02:14:59,420
Try to get to him and then like,

5150
02:14:59,940 --> 02:15:01,200
then it gets fucking awkward,

5151
02:15:01,260 --> 02:15:01,561
you know,

5152
02:15:01,561 --> 02:15:02,071
cause you know,

5153
02:15:02,071 --> 02:15:06,120
a thousand people are hitting
them up while you're up there.

5154
02:15:06,121 --> 02:15:06,750
So it's like,

5155
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:07,140
you know,

5156
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:07,973
just,

5157
02:15:08,250 --> 02:15:09,960
I'd rather just go and have a good time.

5158
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:10,321
Yeah.

5159
02:15:10,321 --> 02:15:13,620
Those are the awkward calls or texts
you get from people that you barely know

5160
02:15:13,621 --> 02:15:14,700
and they want something you,

5161
02:15:14,770 --> 02:15:15,603
yeah.

5162
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:17,190
Yeah.

5163
02:15:17,190 --> 02:15:19,080
And do you don't feel
weird asking me for this.

5164
02:15:19,570 --> 02:15:19,890
Right.

5165
02:15:19,890 --> 02:15:20,461
It doesn't end.

5166
02:15:20,461 --> 02:15:20,911
It doesn't,

5167
02:15:20,911 --> 02:15:22,140
it doesn't bother them a bit.

5168
02:15:22,260 --> 02:15:22,381
Now.

5169
02:15:22,381 --> 02:15:23,520
Some people are brutal too.

5170
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:24,413
They just keep hitting it.

5171
02:15:24,750 --> 02:15:28,260
And it's really funny when
you ask me for someone else.

5172
02:15:28,750 --> 02:15:29,220
Yeah.

5173
02:15:29,220 --> 02:15:29,760
Like,

5174
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:29,941
Hey,

5175
02:15:29,941 --> 02:15:31,590
I heard you on Joe Rogan's podcast.

5176
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:33,000
I want to go to UFC.

5177
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:34,171
Really?

5178
02:15:34,171 --> 02:15:35,310
I'm sure they sell tickets.

5179
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:36,390
Joey Diaz gets that.

5180
02:15:36,630 --> 02:15:37,650
He gets out all the time.

5181
02:15:37,670 --> 02:15:37,890
He'll,

5182
02:15:37,890 --> 02:15:38,191
he gets,

5183
02:15:38,191 --> 02:15:38,670
I bet.

5184
02:15:38,670 --> 02:15:39,120
I bet.

5185
02:15:39,120 --> 02:15:40,230
Cause you guys are tight.

5186
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:41,580
He gets angry at people.

5187
02:15:41,930 --> 02:15:42,100
You know,

5188
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:45,510
people want to get on this podcast
and they tried to go through Joey.

5189
02:15:46,230 --> 02:15:46,640
He gets,

5190
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:49,230
he can't go through Joey
and then fucking angry.

5191
02:15:49,680 --> 02:15:53,670
The thing is the people you would give
it to are the ones who will never ask.

5192
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:54,570
Exactly.

5193
02:15:54,570 --> 02:15:54,851
Yeah.

5194
02:15:54,851 --> 02:15:56,550
You know the ones you'd
be happy to do it for.

5195
02:15:56,551 --> 02:15:59,970
They're the ones who
would never ask you for,

5196
02:15:59,971 --> 02:16:00,240
uh,

5197
02:16:00,240 --> 02:16:00,970
for anything.

5198
02:16:00,970 --> 02:16:03,960
There's a lot of people that have that
distorted misconception that this,

5199
02:16:03,990 --> 02:16:08,790
this business is all about finding
the right connections and then those

5200
02:16:08,791 --> 02:16:09,511
connections,

5201
02:16:09,511 --> 02:16:10,860
like you have to work those connections.

5202
02:16:10,861 --> 02:16:11,940
And that's how you get to the business.

5203
02:16:12,090 --> 02:16:13,110
That's what you get for those.

5204
02:16:13,111 --> 02:16:14,340
Some people do that.

5205
02:16:14,610 --> 02:16:14,761
Yeah,

5206
02:16:14,761 --> 02:16:15,594
but they're not good.

5207
02:16:15,630 --> 02:16:16,080
You're right.

5208
02:16:16,080 --> 02:16:16,531
It is good.

5209
02:16:16,531 --> 02:16:16,740
One,

5210
02:16:16,740 --> 02:16:17,510
not talent,

5211
02:16:17,510 --> 02:16:18,490
it's just,

5212
02:16:18,870 --> 02:16:20,880
it's salesmanship backstage.

5213
02:16:21,050 --> 02:16:22,650
It's being everyone's friend.

5214
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:26,640
One thing that does happen for sure is
that you find someone who's really funny

5215
02:16:26,641 --> 02:16:27,091
and then you go,

5216
02:16:27,091 --> 02:16:27,211
well,

5217
02:16:27,211 --> 02:16:28,260
who's that dude hanging out with?

5218
02:16:28,650 --> 02:16:29,230
And then you out.

5219
02:16:29,230 --> 02:16:29,561
Oh,

5220
02:16:29,561 --> 02:16:30,310
he's got friends.

5221
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:32,380
Like Garrett guarantee you
their friends are funny.

5222
02:16:32,620 --> 02:16:33,341
If they're funny,

5223
02:16:33,341 --> 02:16:35,530
like if you know Ari
should fear and you go,

5224
02:16:35,531 --> 02:16:36,430
Ari's funny shit.

5225
02:16:36,431 --> 02:16:36,611
Who,

5226
02:16:36,611 --> 02:16:37,570
who's always friend,

5227
02:16:37,630 --> 02:16:38,200
you know,

5228
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:40,510
like Ari has some friends from
New York that I don't even know.

5229
02:16:40,780 --> 02:16:41,261
And then,

5230
02:16:41,261 --> 02:16:41,470
uh,

5231
02:16:41,470 --> 02:16:41,801
I,

5232
02:16:41,801 --> 02:16:42,221
you know,

5233
02:16:42,221 --> 02:16:43,510
he tells me about them and I'm like,

5234
02:16:43,511 --> 02:16:43,601
oh,

5235
02:16:43,601 --> 02:16:44,470
I want to meet that dude.

5236
02:16:44,471 --> 02:16:44,651
You know,

5237
02:16:44,651 --> 02:16:45,191
like I go,

5238
02:16:45,191 --> 02:16:46,200
I want to have that guy.

5239
02:16:46,220 --> 02:16:48,370
Cause they wouldn't be hanging
out with him if they weren't.

5240
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:50,620
If he tells you they're funny.

5241
02:16:50,650 --> 02:16:51,483
They're funny.

5242
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:52,720
There's definitely that.

5243
02:16:52,721 --> 02:16:54,550
There's that sort of connection
that definitely helps.

5244
02:16:54,551 --> 02:16:55,660
But you gotta be talented.

5245
02:16:56,020 --> 02:16:56,853
Cause if you're not,

5246
02:16:57,310 --> 02:17:01,600
we all have those few friends that were
friends with back from 15 whatever years

5247
02:17:01,601 --> 02:17:02,740
ago and then not really that good,

5248
02:17:02,741 --> 02:17:04,630
but you're still kind of friends
with them and they're like,

5249
02:17:04,631 --> 02:17:05,121
hey man,

5250
02:17:05,121 --> 02:17:05,410
you know,

5251
02:17:05,410 --> 02:17:06,430
why don't you take me
on the road with you?

5252
02:17:06,670 --> 02:17:07,270
Hey man,

5253
02:17:07,270 --> 02:17:08,590
how come you never work
on your fucking act?

5254
02:17:08,610 --> 02:17:08,980
Yeah.

5255
02:17:08,980 --> 02:17:09,520
Hey man,

5256
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:10,960
how can we not really comedian,

5257
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:12,200
you know,

5258
02:17:12,200 --> 02:17:17,200
to people I admired the people who weren't
funny who got funny because I mean I

5259
02:17:18,501 --> 02:17:20,180
think I was pretty funny from the start,

5260
02:17:20,181 --> 02:17:20,491
but I,

5261
02:17:20,491 --> 02:17:22,190
I know some people who just weren't,

5262
02:17:22,490 --> 02:17:23,150
and I had my,

5263
02:17:23,150 --> 02:17:28,150
cause you kept doing it hammering when
nobody believed in you when nobody

5264
02:17:28,461 --> 02:17:29,061
thought you were.

5265
02:17:29,061 --> 02:17:30,470
And maybe you weren't funny.

5266
02:17:30,471 --> 02:17:31,610
Maybe you were just bombing,

5267
02:17:31,611 --> 02:17:35,660
but you knew there was something
there and you kept doing it.

5268
02:17:35,690 --> 02:17:36,740
Like I admire that.

5269
02:17:36,741 --> 02:17:41,741
I think that's a lot harder than being
funny and just going out and being funny.

5270
02:17:41,960 --> 02:17:42,770
I think you're right.

5271
02:17:42,770 --> 02:17:43,850
I don't want to name any names,

5272
02:17:43,851 --> 02:17:44,410
but I know for

5273
02:17:44,410 --> 02:17:45,250
guys that are like that,

5274
02:17:45,251 --> 02:17:47,140
they just incrementally got better.

5275
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:47,500
Yeah.

5276
02:17:47,500 --> 02:17:48,430
And then you know,

5277
02:17:48,431 --> 02:17:50,560
just kept chipping away
and kept chipping away.

5278
02:17:50,561 --> 02:17:53,230
And then once they started to
develop in real confidence,

5279
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:54,820
then it started taking off for them.

5280
02:17:54,830 --> 02:17:56,350
Then we started getting some momentum.

5281
02:17:57,820 --> 02:17:58,900
It's hard to figure out man.

5282
02:17:58,960 --> 02:17:59,620
Yeah.

5283
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:00,161
That's why,

5284
02:18:00,161 --> 02:18:00,491
you know,

5285
02:18:00,491 --> 02:18:02,620
like you were saying
like meat and Comedians,

5286
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:03,800
you know like uh,

5287
02:18:03,820 --> 02:18:07,330
Kevin James and I had taken
you for a tour of a Montreal.

5288
02:18:07,331 --> 02:18:08,164
It's like yeah,

5289
02:18:08,170 --> 02:18:09,800
I'm in awe man.

5290
02:18:10,050 --> 02:18:13,280
Cause it doesn't seem like
in the beginning it just
doesn't seem like it's going

5291
02:18:13,281 --> 02:18:13,990
to work.

5292
02:18:13,990 --> 02:18:14,530
Fuck.

5293
02:18:14,530 --> 02:18:16,580
It's like it's so it's all of it.

5294
02:18:16,581 --> 02:18:16,660
Yeah.

5295
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:18,910
It's so slippery and they're so big.

5296
02:18:18,911 --> 02:18:22,510
Like I remember when I started out
when I was opening for Tommy Davidson,

5297
02:18:22,720 --> 02:18:25,180
like it's been a summer opening for Shami.

5298
02:18:25,690 --> 02:18:26,471
And I was like,

5299
02:18:26,471 --> 02:18:27,304
man,

5300
02:18:27,370 --> 02:18:31,420
when they say his name there's
more applause than my best joke.

5301
02:18:32,230 --> 02:18:33,970
Just saying his name.

5302
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,290
He got a bigger applause,

5303
02:18:35,291 --> 02:18:36,040
break them.

5304
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:40,450
But I always felt like it's funny cause
sometimes you meet people or you have

5305
02:18:40,451 --> 02:18:41,590
somebody open and for you,

5306
02:18:41,591 --> 02:18:42,730
I don't know if you get this,

5307
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:44,050
cause you probably bring yours,

5308
02:18:44,051 --> 02:18:45,550
but you took like,

5309
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:46,420
how long have you been doing this?

5310
02:18:46,630 --> 02:18:47,463
12 years.

5311
02:18:47,470 --> 02:18:47,740
I'm like,

5312
02:18:47,740 --> 02:18:48,573
what?

5313
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:51,250
And you're hosting like what was your,

5314
02:18:51,251 --> 02:18:52,870
do you have any ambition?

5315
02:18:53,140 --> 02:18:54,250
Like even back then,

5316
02:18:54,251 --> 02:18:55,630
like my thing was like,

5317
02:18:55,631 --> 02:18:55,871
yeah,

5318
02:18:55,871 --> 02:18:57,100
I want his job.

5319
02:18:57,130 --> 02:18:57,701
You know what I mean?

5320
02:18:57,701 --> 02:18:59,800
Like any headline or I opened for,

5321
02:19:00,250 --> 02:19:01,570
I wanted to beat them.

5322
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:02,860
I never even thought like,

5323
02:19:02,930 --> 02:19:03,280
um,

5324
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:06,160
I guess I want to open for
you for the next nine years.

5325
02:19:06,190 --> 02:19:06,640
No,

5326
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:07,001
fuck,

5327
02:19:07,001 --> 02:19:07,990
I want your job.

5328
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:10,140
But there's a lot of guys
that are like local guys,

5329
02:19:10,141 --> 02:19:11,850
like in Nashville or whatever,

5330
02:19:11,851 --> 02:19:14,570
that just host when comics
are in town and yeah,

5331
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:16,080
you got to get out of those cities.

5332
02:19:16,250 --> 02:19:16,640
Yeah.

5333
02:19:16,640 --> 02:19:16,850
And,

5334
02:19:16,850 --> 02:19:19,430
and some do it for fun,

5335
02:19:19,940 --> 02:19:20,751
which I get,

5336
02:19:20,751 --> 02:19:23,480
but if you have real
ambition in the business,

5337
02:19:24,020 --> 02:19:25,310
you gotta you gotta be,

5338
02:19:25,340 --> 02:19:25,641
you know,

5339
02:19:25,641 --> 02:19:26,474
like I tell,

5340
02:19:26,510 --> 02:19:27,343
I tell,

5341
02:19:27,410 --> 02:19:27,771
it's like,

5342
02:19:27,771 --> 02:19:28,041
you know what,

5343
02:19:28,041 --> 02:19:30,080
your job is be funnier than the middle.

5344
02:19:31,420 --> 02:19:33,590
You need to blow that middle off stage.

5345
02:19:33,591 --> 02:19:34,970
That's what you have to do.

5346
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:36,200
Cause it cause you,

5347
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:37,700
if you want his job,

5348
02:19:38,180 --> 02:19:39,440
you got to show you can do it.

5349
02:19:40,090 --> 02:19:43,430
You true sit here and if you
got to announce a drinks,

5350
02:19:43,431 --> 02:19:46,610
you better come up with a
funny way to announce drinks.

5351
02:19:47,090 --> 02:19:48,020
You know that's,

5352
02:19:48,040 --> 02:19:49,190
that's part of your job.

5353
02:19:49,610 --> 02:19:49,881
Yeah.

5354
02:19:49,881 --> 02:19:50,750
That's why it's,

5355
02:19:50,820 --> 02:19:52,850
it's tricky working with
people on the road to,

5356
02:19:52,851 --> 02:19:53,710
do you find the,

5357
02:19:53,711 --> 02:19:56,450
do you ever work with guys that try
to steal your shit and step on it?

5358
02:19:56,480 --> 02:19:59,510
They like twist it around a little
bit to fuck with your premises.

5359
02:19:59,570 --> 02:20:00,740
I've heard guys,

5360
02:20:01,730 --> 02:20:02,960
not so much that,

5361
02:20:02,961 --> 02:20:03,830
a little bit of that,

5362
02:20:03,831 --> 02:20:08,340
but I've heard them doing something
from somebody I know who had been there.

5363
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:10,521
You know what I mean?

5364
02:20:10,521 --> 02:20:12,110
So they're doing up in Lincoln.

5365
02:20:12,111 --> 02:20:13,430
That sounds familiar.

5366
02:20:14,360 --> 02:20:14,991
And then you're like,

5367
02:20:14,991 --> 02:20:15,441
wait a minute,

5368
02:20:15,441 --> 02:20:16,790
he was here last month.

5369
02:20:17,540 --> 02:20:20,660
But you know when they do that
they're not going to get out of that.

5370
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:22,400
They're not going to
get out of that circle.

5371
02:20:22,550 --> 02:20:23,181
You know what I mean?

5372
02:20:23,181 --> 02:20:23,391
Like,

5373
02:20:23,391 --> 02:20:23,661
say,

5374
02:20:23,661 --> 02:20:28,460
say they're a middle act and the south
and they're stealing material from

5375
02:20:28,461 --> 02:20:30,260
headliners tour in the country,

5376
02:20:30,650 --> 02:20:32,860
you're going to stay a middle
act and the south because,

5377
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:34,130
cause once you leave,

5378
02:20:34,131 --> 02:20:36,350
people know who did that.

5379
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:37,670
They know who wrote that.

5380
02:20:37,850 --> 02:20:38,580
Yeah.

5381
02:20:38,580 --> 02:20:39,410
Yeah.

5382
02:20:39,410 --> 02:20:40,460
It's a different world now.

5383
02:20:40,490 --> 02:20:40,880
Yeah.

5384
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:42,650
Are you doing a podcast at all?

5385
02:20:42,651 --> 02:20:43,041
You ever thought?

5386
02:20:43,041 --> 02:20:43,430
Yeah,

5387
02:20:43,430 --> 02:20:43,731
yeah,

5388
02:20:43,731 --> 02:20:44,840
I do a podcast.

5389
02:20:44,841 --> 02:20:45,230
It's,

5390
02:20:45,230 --> 02:20:45,780
it's,

5391
02:20:45,780 --> 02:20:46,171
and it's,

5392
02:20:46,171 --> 02:20:47,000
it's very interesting.

5393
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:51,470
I love my podcasts called who's paying
attention and I do kind of a weekly news

5394
02:20:51,471 --> 02:20:52,430
wrap up thing,

5395
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:54,770
but it's just me talking about shit.

5396
02:20:54,771 --> 02:20:55,900
I read in the news and,

5397
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:57,080
and some of it by yourself,

5398
02:20:57,081 --> 02:20:57,231
like,

5399
02:20:57,231 --> 02:20:59,370
don't burn us the morning podcast.

5400
02:20:59,371 --> 02:21:00,580
Some of it is,

5401
02:21:01,230 --> 02:21:06,230
some of it is the more insightful stuff
that I can't do in the comedy world.

5402
02:21:06,321 --> 02:21:10,970
So I'll give my real opinion on it than
other stuff is just me joking about some

5403
02:21:10,971 --> 02:21:13,730
crazy shit in the news or making
fun of some stuff in the news.

5404
02:21:13,731 --> 02:21:15,770
But on occasion I have guests,

5405
02:21:15,771 --> 02:21:19,520
like I did the La podcast festival
and I had guests and people like it.

5406
02:21:19,521 --> 02:21:20,630
So I guess I need to,

5407
02:21:20,631 --> 02:21:21,260
uh,

5408
02:21:21,260 --> 02:21:22,790
I need to take it to the next level.

5409
02:21:22,820 --> 02:21:23,541
What is that like?

5410
02:21:23,541 --> 02:21:25,340
What does the podcast festival like?

5411
02:21:25,341 --> 02:21:25,491
I've,

5412
02:21:25,491 --> 02:21:27,410
I've heard of it was just never been,

5413
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:28,850
it was actually pretty cool.

5414
02:21:29,270 --> 02:21:31,250
It's just doing a lot of podcasts.

5415
02:21:31,251 --> 02:21:35,030
Like you would do your podcasts
in a room with a big audience.

5416
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:36,373
That's just it,

5417
02:21:36,380 --> 02:21:37,460
that that's what it is.

5418
02:21:37,490 --> 02:21:37,850
You're,

5419
02:21:37,850 --> 02:21:41,030
they have different ballrooms set up,

5420
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:41,721
you know,

5421
02:21:41,721 --> 02:21:42,710
different sizes,

5422
02:21:42,711 --> 02:21:47,390
I guess from like 50 seats to maybe a few
hundred seats or I don't know what the

5423
02:21:47,391 --> 02:21:48,350
biggest ones were,

5424
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:49,460
but um,

5425
02:21:49,460 --> 02:21:49,731
yeah,

5426
02:21:49,731 --> 02:21:54,731
and you just do your podcast live for
an audience there and they do them one

5427
02:21:54,891 --> 02:21:55,551
after another.

5428
02:21:55,551 --> 02:21:57,110
So the audience that,

5429
02:21:57,111 --> 02:22:02,111
I guess they buy a ticket and say they
might listen to your podcast and then

5430
02:22:02,450 --> 02:22:07,450
walk out of yours and go listen to Todd
glass for a while and come listen to me

5431
02:22:08,391 --> 02:22:08,931
or whatever.

5432
02:22:08,931 --> 02:22:09,231
You know,

5433
02:22:09,231 --> 02:22:09,711
it's like,

5434
02:22:09,711 --> 02:22:10,544
uh,

5435
02:22:11,180 --> 02:22:12,013
excuse me.

5436
02:22:12,100 --> 02:22:16,130
Just that a weekend of podcasts
all in one place this year.

5437
02:22:16,370 --> 02:22:16,730
Yeah,

5438
02:22:16,730 --> 02:22:17,240
I did it.

5439
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:17,870
It was fun.

5440
02:22:17,870 --> 02:22:20,750
I was surprised it was last month.

5441
02:22:20,990 --> 02:22:21,440
Oh really?

5442
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:21,860
Yeah.

5443
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:24,910
I was surprised because they had
asked me to do it before and,

5444
02:22:25,220 --> 02:22:26,220
and I don't think

5445
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:27,420
a lot about my podcast.

5446
02:22:27,421 --> 02:22:28,254
Like I'm always,

5447
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:31,980
I'm always flattered when people
listen to and I get to eat.

5448
02:22:31,981 --> 02:22:33,270
Like when's the next podcast?

5449
02:22:33,271 --> 02:22:36,870
Cause I do it about every week but I
don't have a set day to do it and I'm like

5450
02:22:37,050 --> 02:22:37,883
you're listening.

5451
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:40,530
Well that was the name of various,

5452
02:22:40,550 --> 02:22:44,130
anybody paying very flattered that you
were listening to on a regular basis.

5453
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:44,851
But yeah,

5454
02:22:44,851 --> 02:22:45,510
I liked doing it.

5455
02:22:45,510 --> 02:22:49,230
I like it because I get to
just give my opinion on shit.

5456
02:22:49,290 --> 02:22:50,123
You know.

5457
02:22:50,130 --> 02:22:50,963
How long have you done it?

5458
02:22:51,580 --> 02:22:54,780
My book episode one 20 so
it's been about two years.

5459
02:22:54,800 --> 02:22:55,020
Yeah.

5460
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:55,853
Wow.

5461
02:22:56,050 --> 02:22:58,770
The won't those things build man now
you're going to get a lot more people

5462
02:22:58,771 --> 02:22:59,604
listening to it.

5463
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:00,260
Listen to this.

5464
02:23:00,260 --> 02:23:00,531
Yeah,

5465
02:23:00,531 --> 02:23:00,900
this,

5466
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:02,040
this is fantastic.

5467
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:06,030
I mean this is great because you're one
of the big ones and you've got a huge

5468
02:23:06,031 --> 02:23:07,020
following and this and that.

5469
02:23:07,020 --> 02:23:09,180
But it's also because you
and me and we talk about it,

5470
02:23:09,181 --> 02:23:10,720
we don't get to hang that often.

5471
02:23:11,130 --> 02:23:12,690
We've known each other a long time.

5472
02:23:12,691 --> 02:23:14,220
We cross paths here and there,

5473
02:23:14,221 --> 02:23:15,480
but it's just this was,

5474
02:23:15,870 --> 02:23:19,050
that's why this was always
something I wanted to do and fun.

5475
02:23:19,051 --> 02:23:20,160
Just cause I like you.

5476
02:23:21,970 --> 02:23:26,670
My phone was the last text that I had
with you was a year ago before this.

5477
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:27,533
The recent one?

5478
02:23:27,540 --> 02:23:27,751
Yeah.

5479
02:23:27,751 --> 02:23:30,780
We ran into each other at the laugh
factory and then the last one we were

5480
02:23:30,781 --> 02:23:35,040
planning on doing a podcast
but we just pulled it off.

5481
02:23:35,070 --> 02:23:35,490
Why not?

5482
02:23:35,490 --> 02:23:35,851
You know,

5483
02:23:35,851 --> 02:23:36,271
and that's,

5484
02:23:36,271 --> 02:23:37,020
that's how it is,

5485
02:23:37,020 --> 02:23:37,351
you know,

5486
02:23:37,351 --> 02:23:38,550
cause we're both traveling,

5487
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:40,230
doing our thing and this and that.

5488
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:42,690
I mean that's the other thing
about being friends with comics.

5489
02:23:42,691 --> 02:23:44,430
When you reach the headliner level,

5490
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:46,290
you don't see each other anymore.

5491
02:23:46,350 --> 02:23:46,651
Yeah.

5492
02:23:46,651 --> 02:23:47,660
Unless you work together,

5493
02:23:47,730 --> 02:23:51,370
you work together or that's like a
festival or a show or something like that.

5494
02:23:51,410 --> 02:23:52,400
The store or the laugh,

5495
02:23:52,410 --> 02:23:53,460
archery or the Improv.

5496
02:23:53,490 --> 02:23:55,800
That's one of the reasons why I
take guys on the road with me too.

5497
02:23:55,980 --> 02:23:56,260
You know,

5498
02:23:56,260 --> 02:23:56,550
I,

5499
02:23:56,550 --> 02:23:57,330
I don't,

5500
02:23:57,330 --> 02:23:59,610
I never use like a local guy.

5501
02:23:59,640 --> 02:24:01,980
I always take people on the road
with me cause I want to work with,

5502
02:24:02,190 --> 02:24:02,521
first of all,

5503
02:24:02,521 --> 02:24:04,020
I want to work with really funny guys.

5504
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:05,940
And then I also don't want to be alone.

5505
02:24:06,330 --> 02:24:07,380
I want to work with friends.

5506
02:24:07,410 --> 02:24:09,420
I take people when I can,

5507
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:11,400
but a lot of times they are like,

5508
02:24:11,430 --> 02:24:13,890
the places don't want to
give up a room or they don't.

5509
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:15,353
They're like,

5510
02:24:15,540 --> 02:24:18,030
we got a local guy that
we pay 50 bucks a show.

5511
02:24:18,360 --> 02:24:19,193
So if you're a guy,

5512
02:24:19,290 --> 02:24:20,880
come in and do 50 bucks,

5513
02:24:20,910 --> 02:24:21,300
you know,

5514
02:24:21,300 --> 02:24:22,133
whatever.

5515
02:24:22,620 --> 02:24:23,460
I always paid,

5516
02:24:23,730 --> 02:24:25,500
I paid for the hotel room,

5517
02:24:25,501 --> 02:24:27,270
I paid extra money for the guys.

5518
02:24:27,271 --> 02:24:28,590
I always get more money than me.

5519
02:24:29,270 --> 02:24:29,880
It's like,

5520
02:24:29,880 --> 02:24:31,320
I don't know if you're aware of this,

5521
02:24:32,370 --> 02:24:33,330
but even when I didn't,

5522
02:24:34,020 --> 02:24:34,980
even when I didn't,

5523
02:24:35,010 --> 02:24:35,610
I was like,

5524
02:24:35,610 --> 02:24:36,200
ah,

5525
02:24:36,200 --> 02:24:39,330
I did it too many times by
myself and it was a crap shoot.

5526
02:24:39,331 --> 02:24:41,430
Like sometimes you'd work on the
road and the guys would be fun.

5527
02:24:41,460 --> 02:24:44,790
You'd work with a great middle
act and he'd make a new friend.

5528
02:24:45,150 --> 02:24:47,220
But that was half the time.

5529
02:24:47,250 --> 02:24:47,550
Yeah.

5530
02:24:47,550 --> 02:24:50,610
And the other half the time
you'd work with idiots and you'd,

5531
02:24:50,611 --> 02:24:53,340
you'd hate yourself and then you'd have
to plug your ears while they were on

5532
02:24:53,341 --> 02:24:54,690
stage because they were so terrible.

5533
02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:57,060
You hated the audience by
the time he got up there.

5534
02:24:57,120 --> 02:25:00,090
I hate the places that
have their local favorite,

5535
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:01,620
you know,

5536
02:25:01,620 --> 02:25:06,620
and they put him on your show and either
he's like some filthy guy or it's just

5537
02:25:07,501 --> 02:25:08,310
not funny.

5538
02:25:08,310 --> 02:25:08,941
You know what I mean?

5539
02:25:08,941 --> 02:25:09,774
Like it,

5540
02:25:09,990 --> 02:25:14,820
like he's fooling that one audience at
that club every week and he thinks he's

5541
02:25:14,821 --> 02:25:15,540
great,

5542
02:25:15,540 --> 02:25:16,130
but you're like,

5543
02:25:16,130 --> 02:25:16,830
ah,

5544
02:25:16,830 --> 02:25:17,401
yeah,

5545
02:25:17,401 --> 02:25:18,480
I've experienced that.

5546
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:18,960
It's,

5547
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:19,410
you know,

5548
02:25:19,410 --> 02:25:20,040
and you just,

5549
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:25,040
or the other thing I hate is when the
green room is the hangout for the local

5550
02:25:25,331 --> 02:25:25,680
comics.

5551
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:26,110
Oh,

5552
02:25:26,110 --> 02:25:26,920
that's the worst.

5553
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:28,000
And I've always thought like,

5554
02:25:28,001 --> 02:25:29,890
that's why you have a road manager.

5555
02:25:30,030 --> 02:25:30,270
Yeah.

5556
02:25:30,270 --> 02:25:31,570
Cause you have somebody to say,

5557
02:25:31,571 --> 02:25:32,404
all right,

5558
02:25:32,590 --> 02:25:33,423
everybody out.

5559
02:25:33,430 --> 02:25:36,820
You know that the worst is when they start
bullshitting with you and like you're

5560
02:25:36,821 --> 02:25:37,860
about to go on stage,

5561
02:25:37,960 --> 02:25:41,650
you're going over your notes and they
want to fuck around and hang out and

5562
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:44,060
they're talking to the
waitress and complaining.

5563
02:25:44,061 --> 02:25:44,950
And they're drinking.

5564
02:25:44,951 --> 02:25:45,341
And you're like,

5565
02:25:45,341 --> 02:25:45,630
what?

5566
02:25:45,630 --> 02:25:46,570
What is this?

5567
02:25:46,600 --> 02:25:47,000
Yeah,

5568
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:48,130
but you don't even work in here.

5569
02:25:48,370 --> 02:25:51,520
I remember like this was back
when I was opening for Tommy.

5570
02:25:51,850 --> 02:25:56,080
We were somewhere and his security guy
wouldn't let me in the green room really?

5571
02:25:56,081 --> 02:25:56,741
And I was like,

5572
02:25:56,741 --> 02:25:57,011
Hey,

5573
02:25:57,011 --> 02:25:57,490
uh,

5574
02:25:57,490 --> 02:25:57,881
you know,

5575
02:25:57,881 --> 02:25:59,230
and I fucked with Tommy about it.

5576
02:25:59,230 --> 02:26:01,610
Cause I knew Tommy and I
don't think Tommy knew,

5577
02:26:01,611 --> 02:26:02,444
but I was like,

5578
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:02,921
yeah,

5579
02:26:02,921 --> 02:26:07,921
I'm kind of on the show friend of his
like not just a fan with the guy wouldn't

5580
02:26:09,911 --> 02:26:10,660
let,

5581
02:26:10,660 --> 02:26:12,990
he wouldn't let me in living color areas.

5582
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:13,650
Yeah.

5583
02:26:13,650 --> 02:26:14,800
Well he was huge back then.

5584
02:26:14,801 --> 02:26:15,040
Yeah.

5585
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:16,210
What is he up to these days?

5586
02:26:16,260 --> 02:26:19,360
He sees door and he's doing
this thing working live.

5587
02:26:19,420 --> 02:26:19,780
Um,

5588
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:24,780
he did a tour with Tony
Rock and some more.

5589
02:26:24,970 --> 02:26:27,070
Tony Rock is fucking hilarious.

5590
02:26:27,340 --> 02:26:27,791
That dude,

5591
02:26:27,791 --> 02:26:29,230
it's funny at Tony's funny.

5592
02:26:29,350 --> 02:26:30,370
So they were on tour.

5593
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:31,900
They did a tour together.

5594
02:26:31,901 --> 02:26:32,141
But yeah,

5595
02:26:32,141 --> 02:26:34,220
Tommy still around still
in the game taught.

5596
02:26:34,300 --> 02:26:35,710
Tony Rock is one of
those guys who were like,

5597
02:26:35,980 --> 02:26:40,000
he might have actually been held back by
the fact that his brothers Chris Rock,

5598
02:26:40,810 --> 02:26:41,230
I don't,

5599
02:26:41,230 --> 02:26:42,063
you know,

5600
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:43,451
I don't know.

5601
02:26:43,451 --> 02:26:44,201
It's funny,

5602
02:26:44,201 --> 02:26:48,940
like I see more similarity in them
now than when I first met Tony,

5603
02:26:49,270 --> 02:26:51,100
but not intentional similarity.

5604
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:53,470
Just in similarity in the
sense that they're brothers.

5605
02:26:54,130 --> 02:26:54,580
But,

5606
02:26:54,580 --> 02:26:55,413
um,

5607
02:26:56,740 --> 02:26:59,110
it's weak because he
never talked about it,

5608
02:26:59,590 --> 02:27:00,341
but you know,

5609
02:27:00,341 --> 02:27:01,480
he's Chris's brother,

5610
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:02,711
you know what I mean?

5611
02:27:02,711 --> 02:27:03,071
It's so,

5612
02:27:03,071 --> 02:27:04,090
it wasn't the same.

5613
02:27:04,360 --> 02:27:07,030
It wasn't the same as like
the weigh ins where you know,

5614
02:27:07,031 --> 02:27:10,420
their family and they worked together
and they do projects and stuff like that.

5615
02:27:10,421 --> 02:27:12,910
I don't know if Tony's ever
been on the same stage as Chris.

5616
02:27:13,150 --> 02:27:13,983
Whoa.

5617
02:27:14,550 --> 02:27:15,370
That's kind of crazy.

5618
02:27:15,370 --> 02:27:15,851
I don't know.

5619
02:27:15,851 --> 02:27:16,690
Maybe he had,

5620
02:27:16,691 --> 02:27:17,370
maybe as,

5621
02:27:17,370 --> 02:27:17,711
I'm not,

5622
02:27:17,711 --> 02:27:18,850
I'm not saying he hasn't,

5623
02:27:18,851 --> 02:27:19,780
I don't know.

5624
02:27:20,200 --> 02:27:21,460
But he never,

5625
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:23,620
he never pushed that.

5626
02:27:23,621 --> 02:27:24,910
He's Chris Rock's brother,

5627
02:27:24,911 --> 02:27:25,451
but you know,

5628
02:27:25,451 --> 02:27:26,470
he's Chris Rock's brother.

5629
02:27:26,950 --> 02:27:27,161
Yeah.

5630
02:27:27,161 --> 02:27:31,120
But I'm saying that he's so good that
like people almost don't take him

5631
02:27:31,121 --> 02:27:34,960
seriously because he's the brother of
one of the greatest comics of all time.

5632
02:27:34,990 --> 02:27:35,600
Yeah.

5633
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:37,660
He doesn't get the props is he deserves,

5634
02:27:37,810 --> 02:27:38,140
right.

5635
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:39,280
Cause people think he's,

5636
02:27:39,430 --> 02:27:42,430
but he's not riding his
brother now in any way.

5637
02:27:43,090 --> 02:27:44,950
It's like the opposite of nepotism here.

5638
02:27:44,951 --> 02:27:46,060
I'm going to suffers from it.

5639
02:27:46,380 --> 02:27:48,160
And so he's not Jim Belushi,

5640
02:27:48,940 --> 02:27:50,050
like Charlie Murphy,

5641
02:27:50,080 --> 02:27:53,230
like jokes around about bringing
and Eddie Murphy's brother,

5642
02:27:53,231 --> 02:27:53,951
like people like,

5643
02:27:53,951 --> 02:27:54,191
you know,

5644
02:27:54,191 --> 02:27:55,450
like he's like,

5645
02:27:55,660 --> 02:27:55,871
you know,

5646
02:27:55,871 --> 02:27:57,130
like people would just yell at them.

5647
02:27:57,131 --> 02:27:57,461
Charlie,

5648
02:27:57,461 --> 02:27:58,090
my bay,

5649
02:27:58,090 --> 02:27:59,110
like they yell at him and he goes,

5650
02:27:59,111 --> 02:28:00,040
does that ever get tired?

5651
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:01,113
And he goes,

5652
02:28:01,300 --> 02:28:01,840
no.

5653
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:02,231
He goes,

5654
02:28:02,231 --> 02:28:05,560
as long as they're not saying
there's Eddie Murphy's brother,

5655
02:28:05,620 --> 02:28:05,920
like,

5656
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:08,200
because for years I was
just Eddie Murphy's brother.

5657
02:28:08,230 --> 02:28:08,740
He goes,

5658
02:28:08,740 --> 02:28:10,750
I'm happy when people yell
out of Charlie Murphy.

5659
02:28:10,751 --> 02:28:11,770
They know my fucking name,

5660
02:28:12,340 --> 02:28:13,173
you know?

5661
02:28:13,270 --> 02:28:13,541
Yeah.

5662
02:28:13,541 --> 02:28:13,811
I guess.

5663
02:28:13,811 --> 02:28:14,141
I mean,

5664
02:28:14,141 --> 02:28:19,110
that's the price you pay when there's
Famor talent like that in the family and

5665
02:28:19,111 --> 02:28:22,280
just such immense fame and talent.

5666
02:28:22,290 --> 02:28:22,970
Yeah.

5667
02:28:22,970 --> 02:28:23,151
I mean,

5668
02:28:23,151 --> 02:28:24,440
in those two situations,

5669
02:28:24,650 --> 02:28:26,780
Eddie Murphy and Chris
Rock to the funniest,

5670
02:28:26,810 --> 02:28:28,370
most famous guys of all time.

5671
02:28:29,330 --> 02:28:29,900
And you,

5672
02:28:29,900 --> 02:28:30,410
you know,

5673
02:28:30,410 --> 02:28:32,060
and they have brothers do standup too.

5674
02:28:32,210 --> 02:28:33,043
Yeah.

5675
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:33,800
That's a grind.

5676
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:34,311
Well that was,

5677
02:28:34,311 --> 02:28:35,210
I just watched,

5678
02:28:35,211 --> 02:28:35,960
um,

5679
02:28:35,960 --> 02:28:37,370
Chris Farley documentary.

5680
02:28:37,930 --> 02:28:38,390
Oh.

5681
02:28:38,390 --> 02:28:41,210
And his brothers on stage doing stand up.

5682
02:28:41,480 --> 02:28:42,020
Whoa.

5683
02:28:42,020 --> 02:28:42,853
And it's like,

5684
02:28:43,490 --> 02:28:45,920
I mean he's talking about how
funny Chris was and stuff,

5685
02:28:45,921 --> 02:28:46,371
but it's like,

5686
02:28:46,371 --> 02:28:46,940
yeah,

5687
02:28:46,940 --> 02:28:47,730
it's Kinda,

5688
02:28:47,730 --> 02:28:49,160
it was only one of those in the family,

5689
02:28:50,030 --> 02:28:50,631
you know what I mean?

5690
02:28:50,631 --> 02:28:51,151
Like that.

5691
02:28:51,151 --> 02:28:54,170
That's Kinda probably not
going to be another one.

5692
02:28:54,350 --> 02:28:55,183
No.

5693
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:57,380
Well he was definitely
not doing enough coke.

5694
02:28:57,410 --> 02:28:57,860
Yeah,

5695
02:28:57,860 --> 02:28:59,030
you gotta you gotta do more coke.

5696
02:28:59,100 --> 02:28:59,261
Yes.

5697
02:28:59,261 --> 02:29:00,200
You want to be like Chris,

5698
02:29:00,770 --> 02:29:01,603
you gotta be,

5699
02:29:02,060 --> 02:29:02,511
you gotta be,

5700
02:29:02,511 --> 02:29:07,511
but apparently up he was like that all
his life from when he was a little kid.

5701
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:09,860
I met him at the,

5702
02:29:09,870 --> 02:29:10,670
uh,

5703
02:29:10,670 --> 02:29:12,380
backstage at the,

5704
02:29:12,381 --> 02:29:13,750
a set of news radio.

5705
02:29:13,751 --> 02:29:15,770
He was friends with Andy Dick and this is,

5706
02:29:15,800 --> 02:29:16,041
you know,

5707
02:29:16,041 --> 02:29:17,690
Andy Dick was a hard partier,

5708
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:18,910
hard harp.

5709
02:29:18,950 --> 02:29:19,790
He's all sober now,

5710
02:29:19,791 --> 02:29:21,710
but he was hard partier.

5711
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:23,810
Chris rock or a Chris Rock.

5712
02:29:23,811 --> 02:29:28,811
Chris Farley was there with two very
hot looking young girls who look like

5713
02:29:28,821 --> 02:29:30,020
they've been up for days.

5714
02:29:30,230 --> 02:29:34,970
They were very attractive but just
looked fucked up and he was gray.

5715
02:29:35,330 --> 02:29:36,320
And when I mean gray,

5716
02:29:36,321 --> 02:29:38,300
I mean like wet cardboard,

5717
02:29:38,301 --> 02:29:39,020
Gray.

5718
02:29:39,020 --> 02:29:44,020
He looked like he could die any second
now he was sweaty and gray and pale and

5719
02:29:44,331 --> 02:29:44,871
his eyes,

5720
02:29:44,871 --> 02:29:49,871
there's like bags under his eyes and he
was just on some kind of crazy bender

5721
02:29:50,390 --> 02:29:54,770
and he was there with these two girls
and I had always heard that he was this

5722
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:55,850
wild partier.

5723
02:29:56,250 --> 02:29:58,040
And it wasn't long after
that that he died either.

5724
02:29:58,430 --> 02:29:59,360
But I remember seeing them,

5725
02:29:59,361 --> 02:29:59,960
they're like,

5726
02:29:59,960 --> 02:30:00,441
whoa,

5727
02:30:00,441 --> 02:30:02,570
they weren't fucking around like
this kid is really doing it.

5728
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:03,350
But that's what,

5729
02:30:03,350 --> 02:30:04,490
that's what I was talking about.

5730
02:30:04,491 --> 02:30:05,930
That's when it's not fun.

5731
02:30:06,110 --> 02:30:06,780
No,

5732
02:30:06,780 --> 02:30:07,700
you're beyond like,

5733
02:30:07,701 --> 02:30:08,570
it's not a party.

5734
02:30:09,470 --> 02:30:14,470
And what kills guys like that is you
have the unlimited money to do that.

5735
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:15,560
Yeah.

5736
02:30:15,560 --> 02:30:17,900
And you basically had permission to do it.

5737
02:30:17,960 --> 02:30:22,960
As long as you can make another movie
or another show or another record or

5738
02:30:23,061 --> 02:30:23,481
whatever.

5739
02:30:23,481 --> 02:30:25,520
Like I read Clapton's book,

5740
02:30:25,880 --> 02:30:27,170
which was actually really good.

5741
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:29,930
And in the beginning of the book he says,

5742
02:30:29,931 --> 02:30:30,291
you know,

5743
02:30:30,291 --> 02:30:33,140
with the amount of drugs and
alcohol I did in my life,

5744
02:30:33,650 --> 02:30:34,700
I should have been dead.

5745
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:35,420
Right.

5746
02:30:35,420 --> 02:30:40,420
And then about two thirds of the way
through the book is when he sobers up and

5747
02:30:40,491 --> 02:30:40,791
you're like,

5748
02:30:40,791 --> 02:30:41,451
Holy Shit,

5749
02:30:41,451 --> 02:30:42,830
how is he not dead?

5750
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:48,040
Like when you read about how much he did
and the quantities and the just at the,

5751
02:30:48,111 --> 02:30:48,944
you're like,

5752
02:30:49,750 --> 02:30:51,410
this guy's not human.

5753
02:30:51,411 --> 02:30:51,681
Like,

5754
02:30:51,681 --> 02:30:51,951
yeah,

5755
02:30:51,951 --> 02:30:53,000
you should have been dead.

5756
02:30:53,020 --> 02:30:53,140
Well,

5757
02:30:53,140 --> 02:30:53,781
what was he doing?

5758
02:30:53,781 --> 02:30:54,614
Just,

5759
02:30:54,970 --> 02:30:55,310
uh,

5760
02:30:55,310 --> 02:30:55,970
everything,

5761
02:30:55,970 --> 02:30:56,271
uh,

5762
02:30:56,271 --> 02:31:00,550
and large amounts of
pills and cocaine and me,

5763
02:31:00,710 --> 02:31:01,610
he talks about,

5764
02:31:01,940 --> 02:31:05,870
he did one show for like 23,000
people in a total blackout.

5765
02:31:05,870 --> 02:31:09,230
Didn't know he was there and you know,

5766
02:31:09,231 --> 02:31:09,531
yeah.

5767
02:31:09,531 --> 02:31:12,140
Just tons of pills and alcohol.

5768
02:31:12,141 --> 02:31:13,310
And how was the show?

5769
02:31:13,340 --> 02:31:14,173
They would

5770
02:31:15,380 --> 02:31:16,550
imagine it was pretty good,

5771
02:31:16,580 --> 02:31:18,100
you know,

5772
02:31:19,670 --> 02:31:20,820
take her out.

5773
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:21,571
Yeah.

5774
02:31:21,571 --> 02:31:22,530
That was the life though.

5775
02:31:22,531 --> 02:31:24,210
That was what those guys were embracing.

5776
02:31:24,470 --> 02:31:24,910
It was,

5777
02:31:24,910 --> 02:31:27,390
there wasn't a generation before me.

5778
02:31:27,420 --> 02:31:29,340
There was a jazz musicians before them,

5779
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:30,001
you know,

5780
02:31:30,001 --> 02:31:30,361
there was,

5781
02:31:30,361 --> 02:31:30,560
uh,

5782
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:30,990
some,

5783
02:31:30,990 --> 02:31:32,680
the older blues guys that,

5784
02:31:32,730 --> 02:31:35,760
that fucked around with drugs and
did heroin and stuff like that.

5785
02:31:35,761 --> 02:31:36,630
But for the most part,

5786
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:40,600
those hard party and rock stars
from the 60s and Seventies.

5787
02:31:40,601 --> 02:31:42,540
And it was no one was like,

5788
02:31:42,930 --> 02:31:44,580
they took it and there were new drugs,

5789
02:31:44,970 --> 02:31:45,390
you know,

5790
02:31:45,390 --> 02:31:46,740
acid was new.

5791
02:31:46,770 --> 02:31:47,603
Cocaine was,

5792
02:31:47,670 --> 02:31:48,001
I guess,

5793
02:31:48,001 --> 02:31:51,000
relatively new as Ellen
on the consumer level.

5794
02:31:51,110 --> 02:31:51,943
Was it really?

5795
02:31:52,140 --> 02:31:52,471
Yeah.

5796
02:31:52,471 --> 02:31:54,120
I think cocaine had been around,

5797
02:31:54,121 --> 02:31:58,680
but they weren't a lot of people
who did cocaine before the 70s.

5798
02:31:58,740 --> 02:31:58,861
Well,

5799
02:31:58,861 --> 02:32:00,300
they would just get it from Coca Cola.

5800
02:32:00,410 --> 02:32:03,210
You wanted to get fucked
up cola early days.

5801
02:32:03,211 --> 02:32:04,590
It was in Coca Cola.

5802
02:32:04,591 --> 02:32:06,510
And then you watch that show.

5803
02:32:06,511 --> 02:32:07,081
Narcos.

5804
02:32:07,081 --> 02:32:07,471
Did you see?

5805
02:32:07,471 --> 02:32:07,760
I know.

5806
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:09,300
I keep hearing about it,

5807
02:32:09,301 --> 02:32:09,691
man.

5808
02:32:09,691 --> 02:32:10,231
I keep hearing.

5809
02:32:10,231 --> 02:32:10,950
It's amazing.

5810
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:12,300
I'm in the middle of it now.

5811
02:32:12,301 --> 02:32:13,051
It's pretty good.

5812
02:32:13,051 --> 02:32:16,470
But they said that was one of Pablos
things like Pablo Escobar was like,

5813
02:32:16,500 --> 02:32:18,160
I'm going to put coke back into cold

5814
02:32:22,100 --> 02:32:22,670
calls.

5815
02:32:22,670 --> 02:32:23,310
Coco.

5816
02:32:23,310 --> 02:32:23,431
Well,

5817
02:32:23,431 --> 02:32:23,671
you know,

5818
02:32:23,671 --> 02:32:25,860
Coca Cola still uses
cocaine for flavoring.

5819
02:32:25,980 --> 02:32:26,400
Yeah.

5820
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:27,720
They still use coca leaves.

5821
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:31,020
They're like one of the biggest
producers of medical cocaine.

5822
02:32:31,230 --> 02:32:34,200
The same company that
takes the coca leaves,

5823
02:32:34,410 --> 02:32:36,150
they extract the cocaine out of it,

5824
02:32:36,151 --> 02:32:37,540
use whatever flavor that makes.

5825
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:39,840
That's why Coca Cola
tastes better than Pepsi.

5826
02:32:40,350 --> 02:32:42,170
I had medical cocaine,

5827
02:32:42,171 --> 02:32:43,320
I had liquid cocaine.

5828
02:32:43,930 --> 02:32:44,763
Um,

5829
02:32:44,940 --> 02:32:49,940
I cut my retina like playing
ball and end it is pain.

5830
02:32:51,180 --> 02:32:52,200
Like you would not,

5831
02:32:52,201 --> 02:32:52,830
you know,

5832
02:32:52,830 --> 02:32:53,091
it's,

5833
02:32:53,091 --> 02:32:57,360
it's as painful as it sounds and
apparently that's what the treatment is.

5834
02:32:57,360 --> 02:33:00,660
Like he gave me this eyedrop and
the pain went away instantly.

5835
02:33:00,661 --> 02:33:00,901
I'm like,

5836
02:33:00,901 --> 02:33:01,301
what was that?

5837
02:33:01,301 --> 02:33:02,134
He said cocaine.

5838
02:33:02,290 --> 02:33:02,790
I was like,

5839
02:33:02,790 --> 02:33:03,511
oh can I,

5840
02:33:03,511 --> 02:33:03,901
and he said,

5841
02:33:03,901 --> 02:33:04,081
no,

5842
02:33:04,081 --> 02:33:04,914
we don't prescribe it.

5843
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:09,060
You got to come in and we
put the drop in your eye.

5844
02:33:09,061 --> 02:33:09,571
But yeah,

5845
02:33:09,571 --> 02:33:10,320
it was,

5846
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:11,131
and it was one of the,

5847
02:33:11,131 --> 02:33:14,400
you know how you go to the doctor when
you're hurt and you want it to stop

5848
02:33:14,401 --> 02:33:15,540
hurting right away.

5849
02:33:16,050 --> 02:33:16,883
It did.

5850
02:33:17,010 --> 02:33:19,890
Like it was one of those rare times
when you go to the doctor like Yep,

5851
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:21,930
that stopped the pain instantly.

5852
02:33:21,931 --> 02:33:22,764
Thank you doc.

5853
02:33:23,310 --> 02:33:23,941
But that's what,

5854
02:33:23,941 --> 02:33:24,774
that's what they use it.

5855
02:33:25,020 --> 02:33:27,120
I'm sure it has other uses uses,

5856
02:33:27,121 --> 02:33:27,660
but yeah,

5857
02:33:27,660 --> 02:33:28,860
when I had my nose fixed,

5858
02:33:28,890 --> 02:33:30,390
they put light of keen in there,

5859
02:33:30,480 --> 02:33:32,250
which is like the gay cousin of cocaine.

5860
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:36,700
Cocaine's cocaine's less talented brother

5861
02:33:38,730 --> 02:33:39,510
and uh,

5862
02:33:39,510 --> 02:33:41,130
it tastes horrible.

5863
02:33:41,130 --> 02:33:41,911
It tastes fucking,

5864
02:33:41,911 --> 02:33:42,960
but it numbs everything up.

5865
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:44,360
But all it does is now everything up.

5866
02:33:44,400 --> 02:33:44,910
You don't get,

5867
02:33:44,910 --> 02:33:45,571
you don't get sick,

5868
02:33:45,571 --> 02:33:48,990
but you do get this weird jittery feeling.

5869
02:33:49,030 --> 02:33:50,190
Like I went out that night,

5870
02:33:50,550 --> 02:33:52,470
I went to dinner and uh,

5871
02:33:52,471 --> 02:33:53,301
I tried to eat,

5872
02:33:53,301 --> 02:33:53,790
I just,

5873
02:33:53,790 --> 02:33:54,930
I couldn't eat.

5874
02:33:55,150 --> 02:33:57,690
It was like my appetite was
all fucked up and I was all,

5875
02:33:57,820 --> 02:33:58,040
I'm,

5876
02:33:58,040 --> 02:33:58,770
I realize like,

5877
02:33:58,770 --> 02:34:02,310
Oh I guess this is like the effects of
that light king shit cause they'd been

5878
02:34:02,311 --> 02:34:05,330
squirting up my nose and you know,

5879
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:07,830
it's weird with drugs what people like,

5880
02:34:08,070 --> 02:34:08,341
you know,

5881
02:34:08,341 --> 02:34:08,670
like,

5882
02:34:08,670 --> 02:34:09,180
like I,

5883
02:34:09,180 --> 02:34:13,140
I went through a surgery and they gave
me that morphine drip like Ooh yeah I got

5884
02:34:13,141 --> 02:34:15,570
one bus and some people love it.

5885
02:34:15,571 --> 02:34:16,230
And I was like,

5886
02:34:16,230 --> 02:34:16,891
this is like,

5887
02:34:16,891 --> 02:34:17,950
it would put me to sleep.

5888
02:34:17,951 --> 02:34:18,070
But

5889
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:21,160
I had no desire to,

5890
02:34:21,220 --> 02:34:22,510
to feel like that.

5891
02:34:23,050 --> 02:34:24,580
Whereas if you're a heroin addict,

5892
02:34:24,610 --> 02:34:26,980
you want to feel like that all the time.

5893
02:34:27,100 --> 02:34:30,250
Maybe I can be a heroin addict then
because I fucking loved it man.

5894
02:34:30,251 --> 02:34:31,880
I had my ACL reconstructed.

5895
02:34:31,940 --> 02:34:33,430
You'd go more that way I think.

5896
02:34:33,431 --> 02:34:38,431
Cause you're naturally so you're naturally
a high energy like active person.

5897
02:34:38,471 --> 02:34:38,921
So yes.

5898
02:34:38,921 --> 02:34:43,600
So your high was probably be
a slow down whereas I'm more,

5899
02:34:43,630 --> 02:34:43,961
you know,

5900
02:34:43,961 --> 02:34:48,160
I'm naturally slow laid
back so my high was more up.

5901
02:34:48,760 --> 02:34:52,630
I think that's why I took the pot so
well this is pot like gave me a chance to

5902
02:34:52,631 --> 02:34:54,040
slow down and look at things.

5903
02:34:54,910 --> 02:34:57,700
I always felt like most of
my life was always like,

5904
02:34:57,800 --> 02:35:02,800
oh just fucking go just and then
can away get out of your own way.

5905
02:35:03,370 --> 02:35:07,000
Cause like the momentum of all the
Shit I had done before was always like

5906
02:35:07,050 --> 02:35:08,920
knocking on my door and my keep moving.

5907
02:35:10,510 --> 02:35:11,050
No,

5908
02:35:11,050 --> 02:35:13,010
no time for introspective thinking.

5909
02:35:13,330 --> 02:35:14,740
No time for objectivity,

5910
02:35:14,741 --> 02:35:16,000
just fucking run.

5911
02:35:16,270 --> 02:35:17,440
And if you get success,

5912
02:35:17,441 --> 02:35:17,951
good.

5913
02:35:17,951 --> 02:35:21,190
That success justifies all
this behavior and motion.

5914
02:35:21,191 --> 02:35:22,090
So keep going.

5915
02:35:22,480 --> 02:35:24,190
And Pot was the first
thing that made me go,

5916
02:35:26,260 --> 02:35:26,531
oh,

5917
02:35:26,531 --> 02:35:27,340
what am I doing?

5918
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:27,860
Like what am,

5919
02:35:27,860 --> 02:35:28,631
why am I doing this?

5920
02:35:28,631 --> 02:35:28,791
Why,

5921
02:35:28,791 --> 02:35:29,091
why,

5922
02:35:29,091 --> 02:35:29,371
why,

5923
02:35:29,371 --> 02:35:29,830
why?

5924
02:35:29,830 --> 02:35:31,270
What is the purpose of all of this?

5925
02:35:31,271 --> 02:35:31,601
What is,

5926
02:35:31,601 --> 02:35:32,560
what is my path?

5927
02:35:32,561 --> 02:35:33,140
Where,

5928
02:35:33,140 --> 02:35:33,410
what,

5929
02:35:33,410 --> 02:35:33,671
what do,

5930
02:35:33,671 --> 02:35:34,810
what makes me happy?

5931
02:35:34,840 --> 02:35:35,740
What do I want to do?

5932
02:35:35,741 --> 02:35:36,190
What?

5933
02:35:36,190 --> 02:35:37,300
What makes me unhappy?

5934
02:35:37,330 --> 02:35:38,350
How do I stop doing that?

5935
02:35:38,380 --> 02:35:38,560
You know,

5936
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:40,390
like made me think about things in a way,

5937
02:35:40,391 --> 02:35:44,110
but when I had my ACL
reconstructed the first one,

5938
02:35:44,320 --> 02:35:45,131
the second one,

5939
02:35:45,131 --> 02:35:46,030
they didn't do shit.

5940
02:35:46,060 --> 02:35:47,560
The second one was so easy.

5941
02:35:47,710 --> 02:35:48,550
I had to,

5942
02:35:48,670 --> 02:35:50,980
and I tell everybody if you have a chance,

5943
02:35:51,400 --> 02:35:52,120
um,

5944
02:35:52,120 --> 02:35:53,680
then they offer you a,

5945
02:35:53,681 --> 02:35:55,190
that is two different types of,

5946
02:35:55,530 --> 02:35:56,050
there's a,

5947
02:35:56,050 --> 02:35:57,240
there's three different types of use.

5948
02:35:57,240 --> 02:35:58,420
They sometimes use hamstring,

5949
02:35:58,421 --> 02:36:00,790
which was really rough and a lot of rehab.

5950
02:36:00,791 --> 02:36:00,851
They,

5951
02:36:00,851 --> 02:36:01,220
Terry,

5952
02:36:01,220 --> 02:36:04,420
they cut a chunk of your hamstring and
it takes a long time for that to come

5953
02:36:04,421 --> 02:36:04,841
back.

5954
02:36:04,841 --> 02:36:05,920
And some people,

5955
02:36:05,921 --> 02:36:10,921
they don't feel like it ever is 100%
and they put that and they use that as a

5956
02:36:11,080 --> 02:36:11,830
tendon.

5957
02:36:11,830 --> 02:36:13,900
But I had the Patella tendon graft,

5958
02:36:13,901 --> 02:36:18,140
they take a piece of bone out of your
shin and a piece of bone out of your knee

5959
02:36:18,141 --> 02:36:22,900
cap and then they slice the Patella
tendon and it's connected with these two

5960
02:36:22,901 --> 02:36:25,720
pieces of bone and the
Patella 10 is a very thick,

5961
02:36:25,721 --> 02:36:29,500
wide tendon and they use that
as a replacement for your ACL.

5962
02:36:29,860 --> 02:36:31,080
I had that done in my left knee,

5963
02:36:31,081 --> 02:36:33,310
and that's the one that
did the a morphine drip.

5964
02:36:33,340 --> 02:36:34,121
The right knee,

5965
02:36:34,121 --> 02:36:35,560
they used a cadaver.

5966
02:36:35,710 --> 02:36:37,120
They use an achilles tendon,

5967
02:36:37,121 --> 02:36:42,010
so it's much thicker than an ACL and
it's like a 150% stronger and they use

5968
02:36:42,011 --> 02:36:42,220
that.

5969
02:36:42,220 --> 02:36:42,971
They screw that in place.

5970
02:36:42,971 --> 02:36:44,770
I went to a party five days later,

5971
02:36:44,771 --> 02:36:46,300
I was walking around without crutches.

5972
02:36:46,301 --> 02:36:46,631
I was like,

5973
02:36:46,631 --> 02:36:47,590
this is crazy.

5974
02:36:47,920 --> 02:36:48,910
It was so much better.

5975
02:36:49,210 --> 02:36:50,500
But the first one,

5976
02:36:50,501 --> 02:36:54,490
the Patella tendon was like
fire was gone through my veins.

5977
02:36:54,491 --> 02:36:57,240
It was like I would get
up off the couch and uh,

5978
02:36:57,250 --> 02:36:58,750
I didn't like take pain pills.

5979
02:36:59,650 --> 02:37:01,090
I hated the way those made me feel.

5980
02:37:01,450 --> 02:37:02,470
I don't remember what it was,

5981
02:37:02,471 --> 02:37:03,760
percocets or Vicodins,

5982
02:37:03,761 --> 02:37:04,720
I don't remember which one it was,

5983
02:37:04,721 --> 02:37:07,930
but I remember I sold them to this due
to the pool hall because I was like,

5984
02:37:08,760 --> 02:37:09,880
these are fucking bullshit.

5985
02:37:09,881 --> 02:37:10,714
I hate that.

5986
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:13,270
I'd rather be in pain than be that stupid.

5987
02:37:13,310 --> 02:37:13,870
Yeah.

5988
02:37:13,870 --> 02:37:17,920
But the trip at the
hospital was like being a,

5989
02:37:18,350 --> 02:37:21,080
it was like having your
balls cradled by angels.

5990
02:37:21,860 --> 02:37:24,560
It was just like you
were being hugged by God.

5991
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:27,630
It was like the world was just
giving you this big warm hug.

5992
02:37:27,631 --> 02:37:29,360
It's like everything's gonna be fine.

5993
02:37:29,750 --> 02:37:33,560
I was on this machine that constantly
straightened my leg and bent.

5994
02:37:33,561 --> 02:37:38,090
It is like this constant motion machine
because they're trying to keep your leg

5995
02:37:38,091 --> 02:37:39,800
from going stiff after they,

5996
02:37:39,801 --> 02:37:40,250
you know,

5997
02:37:40,250 --> 02:37:43,820
fucking chisel into it and start
script putting screws in and all that.

5998
02:37:44,120 --> 02:37:45,080
So this machine is going

5999
02:37:47,960 --> 02:37:49,160
and I'm going click

6000
02:37:51,410 --> 02:37:54,290
and I'm just melting
into this fucking bed.

6001
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:57,080
And the last time I had that feeling was,

6002
02:37:57,081 --> 02:37:57,410
uh,

6003
02:37:57,410 --> 02:37:58,191
in the early,

6004
02:37:58,191 --> 02:37:58,580
uh,

6005
02:37:58,580 --> 02:37:59,630
maybe the late nineties,

6006
02:37:59,631 --> 02:38:00,464
I guess it was.

6007
02:38:00,810 --> 02:38:01,820
It must've been the late nineties.

6008
02:38:01,821 --> 02:38:02,230
Cause I,

6009
02:38:02,230 --> 02:38:02,481
I,

6010
02:38:02,481 --> 02:38:03,314
uh,

6011
02:38:03,650 --> 02:38:08,650
I remember I lived out here and I got
ahold of some of the real nyquil before

6012
02:38:08,841 --> 02:38:10,370
they took that shit off the market.

6013
02:38:10,600 --> 02:38:12,330
The alcohol with the coding in it.

6014
02:38:12,331 --> 02:38:12,830
Yeah.

6015
02:38:12,830 --> 02:38:14,210
Oh God.

6016
02:38:14,211 --> 02:38:17,860
It was 25 proof with coding or something.

6017
02:38:17,870 --> 02:38:18,190
Yeah,

6018
02:38:18,190 --> 02:38:19,490
it was so good.

6019
02:38:19,610 --> 02:38:20,470
It was so good.

6020
02:38:20,520 --> 02:38:21,650
Forgot you had a cold.

6021
02:38:21,830 --> 02:38:22,491
I knew a comic,

6022
02:38:22,491 --> 02:38:25,100
you said drink that shit
of people used to drink it.

6023
02:38:25,130 --> 02:38:27,050
He used to get bottles of it.

6024
02:38:27,100 --> 02:38:27,540
Dill,

6025
02:38:27,540 --> 02:38:31,640
the the people that worked at the
Comedy Club at Rascals in New Jersey.

6026
02:38:31,641 --> 02:38:32,510
I go to rascals.

6027
02:38:32,511 --> 02:38:35,780
You'd have to bring bottles of fucking
Nyquil and they would always just talk

6028
02:38:35,781 --> 02:38:36,111
about it.

6029
02:38:36,111 --> 02:38:36,291
Yeah.

6030
02:38:36,291 --> 02:38:38,060
He fucking wants bottles of Nyquil.

6031
02:38:38,360 --> 02:38:39,330
It just drinks nyquil.

6032
02:38:39,370 --> 02:38:40,780
It goes into his hotel room and drinks.

6033
02:38:40,810 --> 02:38:41,330
NYQUIL.

6034
02:38:41,330 --> 02:38:41,710
Yeah.

6035
02:38:41,710 --> 02:38:45,620
My knees have no cartilage
like that's just beat up.

6036
02:38:45,621 --> 02:38:47,420
So when they hurt my doctor's like,

6037
02:38:47,421 --> 02:38:47,571
yeah,

6038
02:38:47,571 --> 02:38:48,470
we're going to replace them.

6039
02:38:48,471 --> 02:38:49,041
We just wait.

6040
02:38:49,041 --> 02:38:49,460
Don't,

6041
02:38:49,460 --> 02:38:49,821
don't,

6042
02:38:49,821 --> 02:38:50,480
don't listen.

6043
02:38:50,480 --> 02:38:52,190
If that's all it is is just cartilage.

6044
02:38:52,670 --> 02:38:53,780
You got to get stem cells.

6045
02:38:53,870 --> 02:38:54,800
Stem cell shots.

6046
02:38:54,860 --> 02:38:55,671
Oh my God,

6047
02:38:55,671 --> 02:38:56,001
Dude.

6048
02:38:56,001 --> 02:38:57,200
It's the greatest thing of all time.

6049
02:38:57,470 --> 02:38:59,120
They actually regenerate tissue.

6050
02:38:59,330 --> 02:39:00,800
They can regenerate meniscus,

6051
02:39:01,010 --> 02:39:03,770
regenerate cartilage and
bone on bone situations.

6052
02:39:04,010 --> 02:39:05,180
I'll hook you up with his doctor.

6053
02:39:05,181 --> 02:39:06,930
I'll go get you connected to him there.

6054
02:39:06,950 --> 02:39:09,350
It's just over the last couple of
years they're doing these things.

6055
02:39:09,351 --> 02:39:12,880
They're having a miraculous results
with stem cells dies and someone was,

6056
02:39:12,950 --> 02:39:15,610
someone online complained
to me on Twitter though.

6057
02:39:15,611 --> 02:39:16,040
They're good.

6058
02:39:16,040 --> 02:39:17,780
Go load of people can't afford themselves.

6059
02:39:18,050 --> 02:39:19,310
What do you want me to not talk about it?

6060
02:39:19,670 --> 02:39:22,310
Should I not talk about how awesome
it is because people can't afford it.

6061
02:39:22,311 --> 02:39:23,540
I mean that's the way our,

6062
02:39:23,620 --> 02:39:23,961
you know,

6063
02:39:23,961 --> 02:39:24,711
medicine is,

6064
02:39:24,711 --> 02:39:25,140
but yeah,

6065
02:39:25,140 --> 02:39:25,640
I get it.

6066
02:39:25,640 --> 02:39:26,001
I get it.

6067
02:39:26,001 --> 02:39:28,160
It's annoying to you
that you can't afford it,

6068
02:39:28,161 --> 02:39:30,380
but I'm not going to not talk.

6069
02:39:30,381 --> 02:39:31,520
I had it in my shoulder.

6070
02:39:31,650 --> 02:39:33,380
I had that stem cell shot in my shoulder.

6071
02:39:33,590 --> 02:39:35,900
I was like probably a couple
months away from surgery.

6072
02:39:35,901 --> 02:39:36,734
I was like,

6073
02:39:37,130 --> 02:39:40,190
just trying to figure out when I could
schedule it because just it was so

6074
02:39:40,191 --> 02:39:40,580
annoying.

6075
02:39:40,580 --> 02:39:43,580
Every time I'd work out it'd be in pain
for a few days and then I would do it

6076
02:39:43,581 --> 02:39:47,090
again and ice it and all this
different shit and I was like,

6077
02:39:47,091 --> 02:39:49,430
I'm going to have to fucking bite
the bullet and get this thing fixed.

6078
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:50,840
One stem cell shot,

6079
02:39:51,230 --> 02:39:51,711
boom.

6080
02:39:51,711 --> 02:39:54,260
Within two weeks it feels
a hundred percent better,

6081
02:39:54,360 --> 02:39:56,750
but other than a month it felt
better than I've felt in a year.

6082
02:39:57,110 --> 02:39:58,010
And now it's like,

6083
02:39:58,280 --> 02:39:59,400
I mean occasionally it's,

6084
02:39:59,420 --> 02:40:00,050
it's sore.

6085
02:40:00,050 --> 02:40:03,710
Like yesterday I lifted and I lifted
this morning and he's kind of a little

6086
02:40:03,711 --> 02:40:04,131
sore,

6087
02:40:04,131 --> 02:40:05,650
but nothing to complain about.

6088
02:40:05,960 --> 02:40:06,830
No big deal.

6089
02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:11,180
It's funny when you're talking about how
they take part of the shin bone and the

6090
02:40:11,181 --> 02:40:12,014
other bone to put it.

6091
02:40:12,260 --> 02:40:12,500
Oh,

6092
02:40:12,500 --> 02:40:13,800
when doctors do shit like that,

6093
02:40:13,801 --> 02:40:14,010
I'm like,

6094
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:15,390
how smart are you?

6095
02:40:16,080 --> 02:40:17,160
You know what I mean like that,

6096
02:40:17,161 --> 02:40:17,970
that like,

6097
02:40:17,970 --> 02:40:18,803
wow,

6098
02:40:18,810 --> 02:40:20,730
you can actually do that.

6099
02:40:20,760 --> 02:40:21,241
You know,

6100
02:40:21,241 --> 02:40:24,500
like I shattered my wrist and the doc,

6101
02:40:24,510 --> 02:40:26,810
I got to know the doctor
who first I could crash.

6102
02:40:26,910 --> 02:40:27,410
Yeah,

6103
02:40:27,410 --> 02:40:28,890
I know it on a race track.

6104
02:40:28,920 --> 02:40:29,181
Not,

6105
02:40:29,181 --> 02:40:29,320
oh,

6106
02:40:29,320 --> 02:40:30,900
not ordinary circumstance,

6107
02:40:30,930 --> 02:40:34,050
but I was talking to
the doctor and you know,

6108
02:40:34,051 --> 02:40:36,420
and we become friends over time.

6109
02:40:36,421 --> 02:40:36,690
We,

6110
02:40:36,690 --> 02:40:37,830
I fuck with him about it.

6111
02:40:37,831 --> 02:40:38,670
He fucks with me.

6112
02:40:39,130 --> 02:40:39,930
Like when he,

6113
02:40:39,930 --> 02:40:42,480
when he did the surgery and
he said he'll do it again.

6114
02:40:42,481 --> 02:40:42,691
I'm like,

6115
02:40:42,691 --> 02:40:42,841
well,

6116
02:40:42,841 --> 02:40:44,430
you couldn't get shit
right the first time.

6117
02:40:44,670 --> 02:40:45,151
And he's like,

6118
02:40:45,151 --> 02:40:45,361
well,

6119
02:40:45,361 --> 02:40:47,040
if you hadn't fucked it up so bad,

6120
02:40:47,070 --> 02:40:47,581
you know,

6121
02:40:47,581 --> 02:40:48,550
it's like that kind of,

6122
02:40:48,940 --> 02:40:49,220
but,

6123
02:40:49,220 --> 02:40:50,580
but sometimes I just looked at him like,

6124
02:40:50,880 --> 02:40:52,110
how smart are you?

6125
02:40:52,550 --> 02:40:55,000
Could you just put bodies back together?

6126
02:40:55,040 --> 02:40:56,400
His shit is amazing.

6127
02:40:56,780 --> 02:40:57,091
He's like,

6128
02:40:57,091 --> 02:40:57,490
well you,

6129
02:40:57,490 --> 02:40:59,040
I tell fucking Dick joke,

6130
02:41:00,540 --> 02:41:03,450
you go inside the human
body and repair it.

6131
02:41:03,480 --> 02:41:04,530
That's certainly amazing.

6132
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:05,650
Different kinds of smart.

6133
02:41:06,100 --> 02:41:07,410
How about that Ben Carson Guy,

6134
02:41:07,411 --> 02:41:08,700
that guy that runs for president,

6135
02:41:08,850 --> 02:41:13,850
how was a neurosurgeon that he fixed
conjoined twins at the head and yet you'd

6136
02:41:15,101 --> 02:41:16,080
listened to him talk,

6137
02:41:17,160 --> 02:41:20,670
now you talk about the
disconnect that I honestly,

6138
02:41:21,150 --> 02:41:24,960
it's not like Herman Cain cause obviously
I make fun of all these guys and the

6139
02:41:24,961 --> 02:41:29,430
black Republican is always going to be
hilarious because it's like everyone else

6140
02:41:29,431 --> 02:41:29,880
knows,

6141
02:41:29,880 --> 02:41:30,770
nobody told you.

6142
02:41:32,280 --> 02:41:37,280
But to be that smart and yet when you
listen to some of his political stuff,

6143
02:41:37,981 --> 02:41:38,814
you're like,

6144
02:41:39,300 --> 02:41:40,230
how does that work?

6145
02:41:40,260 --> 02:41:43,560
I don't understand that because you're
in neurosis and you're not just a

6146
02:41:43,561 --> 02:41:44,281
neurosurgeon.

6147
02:41:44,281 --> 02:41:47,310
Like you worked your way up from nowhere.

6148
02:41:47,311 --> 02:41:49,230
It wasn't like you were born into,

6149
02:41:49,260 --> 02:41:49,710
you know,

6150
02:41:49,710 --> 02:41:52,180
a silver spoon in your
mouth or whatever light.

6151
02:41:52,181 --> 02:41:53,280
So yeah,

6152
02:41:53,281 --> 02:41:53,730
I don't,

6153
02:41:53,730 --> 02:41:56,370
I don't understand Ben Carson at all.

6154
02:41:56,610 --> 02:41:57,240
Well,

6155
02:41:57,240 --> 02:41:58,560
it's hard when you start,

6156
02:41:58,561 --> 02:42:00,060
when he starts talking about religion,

6157
02:42:00,300 --> 02:42:01,380
when he starts talking about,

6158
02:42:01,381 --> 02:42:01,740
uh,

6159
02:42:01,740 --> 02:42:05,670
the Big Bang and evolution is a
myth and the big bang is bullshit.

6160
02:42:05,730 --> 02:42:07,320
Like he doesn't believe in evolution,

6161
02:42:07,350 --> 02:42:07,800
right?

6162
02:42:07,800 --> 02:42:10,320
He mean he might think the
earth is 10,000 years old.

6163
02:42:10,321 --> 02:42:11,280
He had been one of those guys.

6164
02:42:11,281 --> 02:42:12,000
Yeah.

6165
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:12,211
Yeah.

6166
02:42:12,211 --> 02:42:13,920
He's got some really wacky ideas,

6167
02:42:13,921 --> 02:42:16,200
but when it comes to fixing a brain,

6168
02:42:16,201 --> 02:42:17,580
he knows what the fuck to do.

6169
02:42:17,610 --> 02:42:17,911
Yeah.

6170
02:42:17,911 --> 02:42:19,020
And but that's what I mean.

6171
02:42:19,021 --> 02:42:22,440
Like how do you put those two together
like in the course of learning to fix a

6172
02:42:22,441 --> 02:42:23,274
brain,

6173
02:42:24,690 --> 02:42:26,850
didn't they teach you any other science?

6174
02:42:26,851 --> 02:42:31,290
Wasn't there any other science classes
you went to when you doesn't buy it?

6175
02:42:31,470 --> 02:42:32,370
Not to buy it?

6176
02:42:32,850 --> 02:42:33,211
I don't know,

6177
02:42:33,211 --> 02:42:33,411
man.

6178
02:42:33,411 --> 02:42:34,244
Maybe it's,

6179
02:42:34,440 --> 02:42:37,920
maybe it's like the Hubris that you
have to have to be so confident that you

6180
02:42:37,921 --> 02:42:39,200
could fix conjoined twins.

6181
02:42:39,210 --> 02:42:43,830
Cause apparently conjoined twins at the
head is like one of the most dangerous.

6182
02:42:43,850 --> 02:42:44,760
Oh absolutely.

6183
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:46,560
It took more than 20 hours.

6184
02:42:46,561 --> 02:42:48,990
They brought in surgeons from
all over the world to assist him,

6185
02:42:49,350 --> 02:42:50,910
but he figured out a way to,

6186
02:42:51,180 --> 02:42:55,680
they shared one artery between like a
major artery between the two brains and he

6187
02:42:55,681 --> 02:42:59,130
figured out a way to
channel it and make it work.

6188
02:42:59,460 --> 02:43:01,200
So that's two votes he's going to get.

6189
02:43:04,170 --> 02:43:05,430
He's ahead of Trump now.

6190
02:43:05,490 --> 02:43:05,851
I know.

6191
02:43:05,851 --> 02:43:08,160
That's what's really crazy
and the most recent polls,

6192
02:43:08,161 --> 02:43:08,994
he's ahead of Trump.

6193
02:43:09,030 --> 02:43:10,230
That's because this is the,

6194
02:43:10,231 --> 02:43:12,130
this is the reality show portion

6195
02:43:12,610 --> 02:43:15,010
and then next year they
get to the real election.

6196
02:43:15,011 --> 02:43:15,590
You know what I mean?

6197
02:43:15,590 --> 02:43:18,790
Next years when they're next to
you is when the real candidates,

6198
02:43:18,880 --> 02:43:22,630
do you think that's why Trump is so
gung ho already knows it's bullshit.

6199
02:43:22,660 --> 02:43:26,760
I know Trump's going to sell books
and get a TV show or whatever.

6200
02:43:26,770 --> 02:43:27,311
You know what I mean?

6201
02:43:27,311 --> 02:43:29,050
Like this is all publicity for Trump.

6202
02:43:29,650 --> 02:43:30,420
My theory.

6203
02:43:30,420 --> 02:43:30,701
Yeah.

6204
02:43:30,701 --> 02:43:34,840
My theory is that around
December or January,

6205
02:43:34,841 --> 02:43:37,720
Trump comes up with a
way to back out like,

6206
02:43:37,750 --> 02:43:39,970
I don't want to work with
these politicians are,

6207
02:43:39,971 --> 02:43:40,570
this is bull.

6208
02:43:40,570 --> 02:43:41,141
You know what I mean?

6209
02:43:41,141 --> 02:43:42,790
He comes up with something like that.

6210
02:43:42,910 --> 02:43:47,910
Like when I was running for governor
and he backs out of it and then he rides

6211
02:43:48,161 --> 02:43:50,020
the wave of the publicity.

6212
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:53,110
He might be right or president Trump,

6213
02:43:53,170 --> 02:43:54,070
what have you fucking wins?

6214
02:43:54,100 --> 02:43:55,270
What if he gets in there?

6215
02:43:55,330 --> 02:43:55,691
I mean,

6216
02:43:55,691 --> 02:43:57,370
would that be the biggest,

6217
02:43:57,371 --> 02:43:59,320
I just can't see it happening.

6218
02:43:59,350 --> 02:44:00,130
Why not?

6219
02:44:00,130 --> 02:44:02,200
Because for one thing,

6220
02:44:02,201 --> 02:44:06,970
he knows nothing about policy or
how government works or you know,

6221
02:44:07,940 --> 02:44:09,040
but how hard is that to learn?

6222
02:44:09,730 --> 02:44:09,911
Oh,

6223
02:44:09,911 --> 02:44:12,250
it's very hard on them on that level.

6224
02:44:12,400 --> 02:44:16,450
Even like even Barack Obama
who went in knowing it,

6225
02:44:16,451 --> 02:44:20,440
I think like his first two years
in office was an education.

6226
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:22,000
Because I think you,

6227
02:44:22,030 --> 02:44:26,590
when you really find out how hard it
is to make this work and to get these

6228
02:44:26,591 --> 02:44:29,800
people to work together
and to get anything done,

6229
02:44:29,801 --> 02:44:30,461
you know what I mean?

6230
02:44:30,461 --> 02:44:31,294
Like I think,

6231
02:44:32,170 --> 02:44:37,170
I think he learned a lot about like
how to try to make politics work.

6232
02:44:38,441 --> 02:44:39,850
How did you get anything done?

6233
02:44:39,880 --> 02:44:42,070
And Trump,

6234
02:44:42,070 --> 02:44:42,930
Trump is more like,

6235
02:44:42,990 --> 02:44:43,990
like Schwartz Nigga,

6236
02:44:43,991 --> 02:44:47,950
when Schwarzenegger thought he was going
to go in and call the legislature girly

6237
02:44:47,951 --> 02:44:52,600
men and be the terminator and
they were like Fuck Outta here.

6238
02:44:52,640 --> 02:44:53,710
Like he had like,

6239
02:44:53,711 --> 02:44:54,850
he got slapped,

6240
02:44:54,851 --> 02:44:55,211
you know,

6241
02:44:55,211 --> 02:44:56,830
and it would be the same thing with Trump.

6242
02:44:56,831 --> 02:44:57,041
They'd be,

6243
02:44:57,041 --> 02:44:58,270
what do you mean you're fired?

6244
02:45:00,100 --> 02:45:00,933
Shut up.

6245
02:45:01,180 --> 02:45:01,520
You know,

6246
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:02,321
this is being,

6247
02:45:02,321 --> 02:45:06,340
that Trump would probably make a big
deal out of explaining where all these

6248
02:45:06,580 --> 02:45:07,570
bottlenecks are.

6249
02:45:07,840 --> 02:45:10,530
He'll probably make a big deal
about explaining to the public,

6250
02:45:10,540 --> 02:45:12,670
doing press conferences
and not playing ball.

6251
02:45:12,890 --> 02:45:13,030
Yeah.

6252
02:45:13,030 --> 02:45:13,751
Cause you know,

6253
02:45:13,751 --> 02:45:14,470
can rich,

6254
02:45:14,470 --> 02:45:15,220
but there's no,

6255
02:45:15,220 --> 02:45:16,420
that's no secret though.

6256
02:45:16,421 --> 02:45:17,560
Everyone knows that,

6257
02:45:18,070 --> 02:45:18,371
you know,

6258
02:45:18,371 --> 02:45:19,610
we all know about party,

6259
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:20,590
you know,

6260
02:45:20,591 --> 02:45:21,131
and we,

6261
02:45:21,131 --> 02:45:21,964
you know,

6262
02:45:22,090 --> 02:45:22,923
and,

6263
02:45:23,830 --> 02:45:28,660
and to get in with all the back
door deals and stuff like that,

6264
02:45:28,661 --> 02:45:29,380
like you got,

6265
02:45:29,380 --> 02:45:30,213
you know,

6266
02:45:30,910 --> 02:45:32,950
you got to have some serious backing.

6267
02:45:33,340 --> 02:45:33,641
You know,

6268
02:45:33,641 --> 02:45:35,080
like he has a lot of money,

6269
02:45:35,110 --> 02:45:40,110
but he doesn't have Koch brothers money
or what's that guy who owns the casinos

6270
02:45:40,331 --> 02:45:41,380
in Vegas?

6271
02:45:41,470 --> 02:45:42,303
Um,

6272
02:45:42,740 --> 02:45:43,180
I,

6273
02:45:43,180 --> 02:45:44,260
I don't even know his name.

6274
02:45:44,261 --> 02:45:46,510
He owns a Venetian and stuff like,

6275
02:45:46,540 --> 02:45:46,930
you know,

6276
02:45:46,930 --> 02:45:48,670
I don't want to say his
name sounds like candy man.

6277
02:45:49,280 --> 02:45:52,390
You want to say that's too
much money or these or,

6278
02:45:52,480 --> 02:45:53,051
or you know,

6279
02:45:53,051 --> 02:45:55,150
on the Democrat side
they have some people,

6280
02:45:55,151 --> 02:45:55,810
I mean you got,

6281
02:45:55,810 --> 02:45:56,141
you know,

6282
02:45:56,141 --> 02:45:58,190
Spielberg and Geffin and all of that.

6283
02:45:58,200 --> 02:45:59,710
Like Trump has money,

6284
02:45:59,711 --> 02:46:00,820
he doesn't have their money,

6285
02:46:00,850 --> 02:46:02,950
nor does he have their influence.

6286
02:46:03,430 --> 02:46:03,790
He does.

6287
02:46:03,790 --> 02:46:08,790
He doesn't have their influence when it
comes to the media and when it comes to

6288
02:46:09,681 --> 02:46:10,280
everything

6289
02:46:10,280 --> 02:46:11,113
else involved.

6290
02:46:11,270 --> 02:46:11,481
You know,

6291
02:46:11,481 --> 02:46:12,320
what's annoying to me,

6292
02:46:12,350 --> 02:46:15,980
how many women that want to vote for
Hillary just because she's a woman and I'd

6293
02:46:15,981 --> 02:46:18,680
like to know how much shady
shit is going on with her.

6294
02:46:18,681 --> 02:46:20,780
Like I've had these
conversations like I'll vote for,

6295
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:22,250
I want a woman in office,

6296
02:46:22,251 --> 02:46:22,490
Mike,

6297
02:46:22,490 --> 02:46:23,323
but do you under,

6298
02:46:23,540 --> 02:46:25,460
do you know how shady she is?

6299
02:46:25,461 --> 02:46:27,050
Do you know that when she
was a criminal lawyer,

6300
02:46:27,330 --> 02:46:27,670
she,

6301
02:46:27,670 --> 02:46:27,790
uh,

6302
02:46:27,790 --> 02:46:28,910
she was a defense lawyer.

6303
02:46:28,911 --> 02:46:31,940
She got some guy off for raping a kid.

6304
02:46:32,090 --> 02:46:32,781
There was like some,

6305
02:46:32,781 --> 02:46:37,781
there's like a video or a recording of
her joking around about it from like the

6306
02:46:37,821 --> 02:46:39,940
1980s or whatever the fuck it was when,

6307
02:46:39,941 --> 02:46:40,774
when this happened,

6308
02:46:41,090 --> 02:46:42,980
if you're going to be a politician,

6309
02:46:43,520 --> 02:46:44,353
your bed,

6310
02:46:44,630 --> 02:46:45,171
you know what I mean?

6311
02:46:45,171 --> 02:46:45,621
Like you're,

6312
02:46:45,621 --> 02:46:46,454
you're like,

6313
02:46:46,490 --> 02:46:48,230
but even before she was a politician,

6314
02:46:48,740 --> 02:46:53,740
the way either email and even then she
was in it because bill has been in it

6315
02:46:53,961 --> 02:46:54,740
from the beginning.

6316
02:46:54,740 --> 02:46:55,310
Yeah.

6317
02:46:55,310 --> 02:46:55,870
The thing I,

6318
02:46:55,870 --> 02:46:59,750
the thing I like about Hillary is
she knows how the game's played.

6319
02:46:59,751 --> 02:47:02,450
Like she has experienced
and she's very smart.

6320
02:47:03,320 --> 02:47:03,791
So I,

6321
02:47:03,791 --> 02:47:04,700
I give her that.

6322
02:47:04,701 --> 02:47:05,390
Is she per,

6323
02:47:05,390 --> 02:47:06,590
I don't think she's perfect.

6324
02:47:06,591 --> 02:47:08,630
I think she's the best of them.

6325
02:47:09,080 --> 02:47:10,130
Of the ones who run it.

6326
02:47:10,131 --> 02:47:11,120
I think she's the best.

6327
02:47:11,240 --> 02:47:12,073
She scares me.

6328
02:47:12,140 --> 02:47:14,180
And the thing about Bernie Sanders,

6329
02:47:14,181 --> 02:47:16,310
although I like a lot of what he says,

6330
02:47:16,970 --> 02:47:18,320
it's not going to get done.

6331
02:47:19,220 --> 02:47:19,640
Like what,

6332
02:47:19,640 --> 02:47:20,473
what particular,

6333
02:47:20,540 --> 02:47:21,500
what about the taxes?

6334
02:47:21,960 --> 02:47:23,180
He talks crazy about tax,

6335
02:47:23,181 --> 02:47:25,730
about 12 fucking shit out of Richmond.

6336
02:47:26,220 --> 02:47:27,500
Well he wants to do,

6337
02:47:27,501 --> 02:47:30,950
he wants to do what some other countries
do with the government provides a lot

6338
02:47:30,951 --> 02:47:31,970
more services,

6339
02:47:32,450 --> 02:47:34,940
but it's paid for by a lot more taxes.

6340
02:47:35,210 --> 02:47:35,690
Yeah.

6341
02:47:35,690 --> 02:47:36,201
And so,

6342
02:47:36,201 --> 02:47:40,940
so now you're going to have to somehow
get that rich 1% that ain't paying to

6343
02:47:40,941 --> 02:47:45,941
suddenly be willing to pay
and to make college free.

6344
02:47:47,870 --> 02:47:49,070
Sounds good.

6345
02:47:49,940 --> 02:47:51,440
But now you're talking about chain.

6346
02:47:51,470 --> 02:47:51,891
See it.

6347
02:47:51,891 --> 02:47:55,010
When you start talking about
changing an entire system,

6348
02:47:55,280 --> 02:47:59,540
when you talk about cutting money
out of defense to pay for things.

6349
02:47:59,720 --> 02:48:00,051
Yeah,

6350
02:48:00,051 --> 02:48:00,950
it sounds great.

6351
02:48:00,951 --> 02:48:02,390
But the problem is this.

6352
02:48:02,450 --> 02:48:07,450
This has been this deaf
military industrial defense
complex business that said

6353
02:48:08,991 --> 02:48:13,280
like how many military bases that we have
where it's just welfare for the town.

6354
02:48:14,180 --> 02:48:15,170
They don't need the base,

6355
02:48:15,171 --> 02:48:17,090
but the base is there
cause the base employees,

6356
02:48:17,091 --> 02:48:19,460
everyone in the town and
if you shut down to base,

6357
02:48:19,880 --> 02:48:20,930
the town goes broke.

6358
02:48:20,960 --> 02:48:22,970
I mean that's true all across America.

6359
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:24,260
And then you have an,

6360
02:48:24,261 --> 02:48:28,640
the congressmen from that town
will fight to the death like that.

6361
02:48:28,670 --> 02:48:32,780
There's a a naval base in West Virginia.

6362
02:48:34,910 --> 02:48:36,200
What's in the ocean?

6363
02:48:36,230 --> 02:48:37,063
There's no ocean.

6364
02:48:38,090 --> 02:48:39,980
But they had this congressmen,

6365
02:48:39,981 --> 02:48:41,000
I forget his name,

6366
02:48:41,001 --> 02:48:41,900
but he was like,

6367
02:48:41,930 --> 02:48:42,890
that was his thing.

6368
02:48:42,891 --> 02:48:43,970
He was that guy.

6369
02:48:43,971 --> 02:48:44,804
And he's like,

6370
02:48:44,900 --> 02:48:49,040
I'm getting these jobs and
this money to my district.

6371
02:48:49,190 --> 02:48:49,821
You know what I mean?

6372
02:48:49,821 --> 02:48:50,151
So,

6373
02:48:50,151 --> 02:48:52,010
so when you get a Bernie Sanders,

6374
02:48:52,280 --> 02:48:53,810
when you get someone who's talking about,

6375
02:48:53,811 --> 02:48:55,460
I'm going to change the whole system.

6376
02:48:55,461 --> 02:48:59,750
And I think this was a thing with Barack
when Barack Obama ran initially and it

6377
02:48:59,751 --> 02:49:03,890
was about hope and change and a bunch
of young people college age got on board

6378
02:49:03,891 --> 02:49:07,680
and they wanted everything to change
and it was great and I think he really

6379
02:49:07,681 --> 02:49:08,160
meant

6380
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:08,993
it.

6381
02:49:09,210 --> 02:49:10,920
And then he got there and it was like,

6382
02:49:10,950 --> 02:49:11,131
oh,

6383
02:49:11,131 --> 02:49:12,180
this ain't going to get done.

6384
02:49:12,210 --> 02:49:12,721
Because he,

6385
02:49:12,721 --> 02:49:15,390
when he got there and he
had a democratic congress,

6386
02:49:15,391 --> 02:49:18,300
like if there was any
chance of him doing it,

6387
02:49:18,301 --> 02:49:19,930
it was when he had the,

6388
02:49:20,070 --> 02:49:22,830
the president and the
Congress from the same party.

6389
02:49:22,831 --> 02:49:24,570
And even then congress was like,

6390
02:49:24,571 --> 02:49:25,021
well no,

6391
02:49:25,021 --> 02:49:26,340
we ain't changing that shit.

6392
02:49:26,400 --> 02:49:26,850
You know,

6393
02:49:26,850 --> 02:49:28,170
we're not going to mess with that.

6394
02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:29,580
It's like they say,

6395
02:49:29,581 --> 02:49:33,030
moving to the United States is
like turning an aircraft carrier.

6396
02:49:34,310 --> 02:49:34,810
You know,

6397
02:49:34,810 --> 02:49:35,420
it,

6398
02:49:35,420 --> 02:49:36,151
it turns,

6399
02:49:36,151 --> 02:49:37,710
but it takes a long time.

6400
02:49:37,740 --> 02:49:39,690
That's the one thing I really
love about Bernie Sanders,

6401
02:49:39,691 --> 02:49:41,040
the idea of free college.

6402
02:49:41,100 --> 02:49:43,470
I think the idea that these kids
come out of college and they're,

6403
02:49:43,910 --> 02:49:47,490
oh hundreds of thousands of dollars
in student loans and they're fucked.

6404
02:49:47,580 --> 02:49:49,950
And then I just drives me crazy.

6405
02:49:50,010 --> 02:49:52,540
It makes so much sense that you're,

6406
02:49:52,541 --> 02:49:55,650
you're almost baffled
that why we don't do it.

6407
02:49:55,970 --> 02:49:57,270
There was one state,

6408
02:49:57,271 --> 02:50:01,170
and I want to say it was
Iowa one say it was Iowa and,

6409
02:50:01,200 --> 02:50:03,510
and I only know about this
because a friend of mine,

6410
02:50:03,511 --> 02:50:08,340
her kid was in school at the time and
she was divorced and her husband lived

6411
02:50:08,341 --> 02:50:09,174
there and,

6412
02:50:09,360 --> 02:50:10,410
but they had this deal.

6413
02:50:10,411 --> 02:50:14,820
They said the first 10 cents of every
tax dollar goes to the schools and you

6414
02:50:14,821 --> 02:50:15,900
can't mess with that.

6415
02:50:15,901 --> 02:50:17,790
You can't change it.

6416
02:50:17,791 --> 02:50:18,270
You can't be.

6417
02:50:18,270 --> 02:50:19,920
And what they noticed,

6418
02:50:20,010 --> 02:50:20,970
they didn't plan it,

6419
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:21,751
but about seven,

6420
02:50:21,751 --> 02:50:22,584
eight years later,

6421
02:50:22,980 --> 02:50:25,080
their jail population started dropping.

6422
02:50:26,040 --> 02:50:26,790
Wow.

6423
02:50:26,790 --> 02:50:27,380
Yeah.

6424
02:50:27,380 --> 02:50:28,021
But you know,

6425
02:50:28,021 --> 02:50:29,550
I could have kids go to school,

6426
02:50:29,940 --> 02:50:30,900
they don't go to jail,

6427
02:50:30,930 --> 02:50:31,321
you know,

6428
02:50:31,321 --> 02:50:36,321
and you look at the cost of putting a
guy in jail for one year versus putting

6429
02:50:36,331 --> 02:50:37,860
them in college for a year.

6430
02:50:38,430 --> 02:50:40,230
It just makes so much more sense.

6431
02:50:40,260 --> 02:50:42,130
Not to mention the fact that it how,

6432
02:50:42,370 --> 02:50:46,800
how is an educated populace bad other
than the fact you can't control it.

6433
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:49,200
That's the only negative to,

6434
02:50:49,250 --> 02:50:50,640
to educating people.

6435
02:50:50,641 --> 02:50:51,570
You can't control them.

6436
02:50:51,620 --> 02:50:52,221
Well that,

6437
02:50:52,221 --> 02:50:55,610
and if you do have an educated
populace that's in debt,

6438
02:50:55,970 --> 02:50:58,220
they're going to have to work three and
a have to work and they're going to have

6439
02:50:58,221 --> 02:51:02,600
to keep your fucking mouth shut and stay
inside the boundaries of the system.

6440
02:51:02,610 --> 02:51:03,080
But

6441
02:51:03,080 --> 02:51:03,481
that's what,

6442
02:51:03,481 --> 02:51:07,310
but I'm talking about if you do away with
the debt so that more people can go to

6443
02:51:07,311 --> 02:51:07,791
college.

6444
02:51:07,791 --> 02:51:08,571
Like in other words,

6445
02:51:08,571 --> 02:51:10,400
the more people that go to college,

6446
02:51:10,401 --> 02:51:11,930
the better a country we are.

6447
02:51:12,620 --> 02:51:13,400
And yet they,

6448
02:51:13,400 --> 02:51:15,400
they literally fight against,

6449
02:51:15,530 --> 02:51:15,891
you know,

6450
02:51:15,891 --> 02:51:16,071
and,

6451
02:51:16,071 --> 02:51:20,690
and it's always funny when you see
people fight against their best interest,

6452
02:51:20,691 --> 02:51:20,961
you know,

6453
02:51:20,961 --> 02:51:21,980
like why don't think it is there

6454
02:51:22,030 --> 02:51:24,460
best interest because they make
money off of the fact that college,

6455
02:51:24,461 --> 02:51:25,060
I mean,

6456
02:51:25,060 --> 02:51:25,891
college education,

6457
02:51:25,891 --> 02:51:26,900
this country subsidized.

6458
02:51:26,901 --> 02:51:27,140
I mean,

6459
02:51:27,140 --> 02:51:27,350
neither.

6460
02:51:27,350 --> 02:51:30,610
One of the reasons why it's so expensive
is because the government is involved,

6461
02:51:30,611 --> 02:51:34,210
the governments involved in all these
loans and there's money in that.

6462
02:51:34,211 --> 02:51:37,750
And whenever you have a tremendous
amount of money that's being generated by

6463
02:51:37,780 --> 02:51:38,291
anything,

6464
02:51:38,291 --> 02:51:41,890
whether it's college or law
enforcement or the drug war,

6465
02:51:42,160 --> 02:51:42,610
you become,

6466
02:51:42,610 --> 02:51:43,630
it becomes an industry.

6467
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:44,021
Well,

6468
02:51:44,021 --> 02:51:44,350
yeah,

6469
02:51:44,350 --> 02:51:44,591
yeah.

6470
02:51:44,591 --> 02:51:45,850
But you're talking about the military,

6471
02:51:45,851 --> 02:51:47,050
like shutting down those bases.

6472
02:51:47,440 --> 02:51:51,700
The same thing would would happen if you
figured out a way to pay for college is

6473
02:51:51,701 --> 02:51:52,690
through tax dollars.

6474
02:51:53,050 --> 02:51:53,883
There would be,

6475
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:54,851
without a doubt,

6476
02:51:54,851 --> 02:51:56,020
some people would lose their jobs,

6477
02:51:56,470 --> 02:51:57,180
lose their gigs.

6478
02:51:57,180 --> 02:51:58,400
But what I what I mean,

6479
02:51:58,401 --> 02:51:58,460
yeah.

6480
02:51:58,460 --> 02:51:58,820
Is

6481
02:51:58,820 --> 02:52:00,800
that is the overall,

6482
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:01,551
in other words,

6483
02:52:01,551 --> 02:52:02,960
the overall health of the nation,

6484
02:52:02,961 --> 02:52:03,840
like if any way better,

6485
02:52:03,870 --> 02:52:04,760
smarter,

6486
02:52:04,790 --> 02:52:05,380
yeah,

6487
02:52:05,380 --> 02:52:05,770
we're,

6488
02:52:05,770 --> 02:52:06,070
we're

6489
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:06,903
better off.

6490
02:52:07,210 --> 02:52:08,290
The one thing we look,

6491
02:52:08,291 --> 02:52:09,700
if you want to make the nation strong,

6492
02:52:09,790 --> 02:52:10,750
make less losers.

6493
02:52:10,870 --> 02:52:11,620
It's real simple.

6494
02:52:11,620 --> 02:52:14,740
I mean that's the number one argument
for cleaning up all these impoverished

6495
02:52:14,741 --> 02:52:15,670
areas in our country,

6496
02:52:15,840 --> 02:52:16,001
right?

6497
02:52:16,001 --> 02:52:17,740
All these like we look at what Baltimore,

6498
02:52:17,890 --> 02:52:22,810
I had this Guy Michael Wood on this
podcast that was a former cop in Baltimore

6499
02:52:22,811 --> 02:52:23,021
and he,

6500
02:52:23,021 --> 02:52:23,380
they,

6501
02:52:23,380 --> 02:52:24,250
when they were there,

6502
02:52:25,030 --> 02:52:25,811
when he was working there,

6503
02:52:25,811 --> 02:52:30,220
they found some papers from the 1970s
that showed all the crime areas and all

6504
02:52:30,221 --> 02:52:32,200
the tactics they were using and he's like,

6505
02:52:32,230 --> 02:52:35,350
we're fucking doing the same shit
they were doing in the 1970s.

6506
02:52:35,351 --> 02:52:36,340
We're spinning our wheels.

6507
02:52:36,860 --> 02:52:39,640
What if you want to fix that area?

6508
02:52:39,700 --> 02:52:42,590
Like concentrating
resources on that area and,

6509
02:52:42,591 --> 02:52:42,870
and,

6510
02:52:42,870 --> 02:52:45,340
and figuring out a way to solve this,

6511
02:52:45,341 --> 02:52:45,820
uh,

6512
02:52:45,820 --> 02:52:50,410
this poverty cycle that just keeps
going on and crime cycle that just keeps

6513
02:52:50,411 --> 02:52:51,190
going on.

6514
02:52:51,190 --> 02:52:52,840
Like you will have less losers,

6515
02:52:52,841 --> 02:52:54,970
you'll have less people
that you have to prosecute.

6516
02:52:55,100 --> 02:53:00,100
You're talking about education because
education and opportunity don't exist.

6517
02:53:01,851 --> 02:53:02,450
I mean that is,

6518
02:53:02,450 --> 02:53:06,800
that is the one thing about the cycle
of poverty that I think a lot of people

6519
02:53:06,801 --> 02:53:07,970
can't understand.

6520
02:53:07,971 --> 02:53:08,804
It's like,

6521
02:53:08,890 --> 02:53:09,260
you know,

6522
02:53:09,260 --> 02:53:09,810
we'll get it.

6523
02:53:09,810 --> 02:53:10,730
Just get a job.

6524
02:53:10,731 --> 02:53:12,040
Like we'll know you,

6525
02:53:12,041 --> 02:53:13,040
you don't have that.

6526
02:53:13,041 --> 02:53:13,371
You know,

6527
02:53:13,371 --> 02:53:16,130
and when you go to school
and your books are,

6528
02:53:16,220 --> 02:53:18,050
are eight years old,

6529
02:53:18,470 --> 02:53:18,741
you know,

6530
02:53:18,741 --> 02:53:21,650
like when you say like this
generation grew up with the Internet,

6531
02:53:22,370 --> 02:53:23,810
but a lot of kids don't,

6532
02:53:23,840 --> 02:53:24,141
you know,

6533
02:53:24,141 --> 02:53:24,710
a lot of kids,

6534
02:53:24,710 --> 02:53:29,510
like that's where the separation is
where you have an iPad when you were in

6535
02:53:29,511 --> 02:53:34,040
school or did you have an eight year
old textbook and then you get to the

6536
02:53:34,041 --> 02:53:35,120
college level.

6537
02:53:35,810 --> 02:53:39,620
Now you're supposed to compete
with the kid who had the IPAD,

6538
02:53:39,680 --> 02:53:40,150
you know,

6539
02:53:40,150 --> 02:53:40,580
it,

6540
02:53:40,580 --> 02:53:41,810
the whole system.

6541
02:53:42,350 --> 02:53:42,651
Yeah.

6542
02:53:42,651 --> 02:53:42,851
And,

6543
02:53:42,851 --> 02:53:43,200
and it,

6544
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:43,550
it's,

6545
02:53:43,550 --> 02:53:48,260
it's one of those things that it
just makes sense to do something,

6546
02:53:48,261 --> 02:53:48,561
you know,

6547
02:53:48,561 --> 02:53:48,801
it's,

6548
02:53:48,801 --> 02:53:49,880
it's like guns.

6549
02:53:49,880 --> 02:53:50,713
It's like

6550
02:53:52,160 --> 02:53:53,170
we have to admit that,

6551
02:53:53,180 --> 02:53:53,451
okay,

6552
02:53:53,451 --> 02:53:54,950
we got to do something like that.

6553
02:53:54,951 --> 02:53:56,900
That's the first thing
before we do anything,

6554
02:53:57,050 --> 02:54:01,040
let's just admit we have to do something
because whatever we're doing isn't

6555
02:54:01,041 --> 02:54:01,820
working.

6556
02:54:01,820 --> 02:54:04,040
And then once we realized
we have to do something,

6557
02:54:04,041 --> 02:54:05,450
then figure out what to do.

6558
02:54:05,451 --> 02:54:07,550
But instead we're,

6559
02:54:07,551 --> 02:54:09,500
we're always us versus them.

6560
02:54:10,070 --> 02:54:10,903
So it's like,

6561
02:54:12,140 --> 02:54:12,501
you know,

6562
02:54:12,501 --> 02:54:14,570
either no guns at all or,

6563
02:54:14,571 --> 02:54:17,480
or just carry your AK to a grocery store.

6564
02:54:17,690 --> 02:54:22,690
Like I'm sure there's somewhere
in between those two that works.

6565
02:54:23,211 --> 02:54:23,571
And,

6566
02:54:23,571 --> 02:54:28,571
and we have become a nation that has
become so divided on every issue.

6567
02:54:29,750 --> 02:54:34,070
And sometimes when it's no reason to be
divided other than the other side said

6568
02:54:34,071 --> 02:54:36,800
it and it just keeps
anything from getting done.

6569
02:54:36,830 --> 02:54:37,790
I don't know.

6570
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,970
I don't know what this country
is going to be in 50 years.

6571
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:41,430
You know,

6572
02:54:41,430 --> 02:54:45,150
it's going to be very different because
we're all these complications that we

6573
02:54:45,151 --> 02:54:45,751
have right now,

6574
02:54:45,751 --> 02:54:46,830
all the problems that we have right now,

6575
02:54:46,831 --> 02:54:47,970
they're going to be accelerated.

6576
02:54:48,210 --> 02:54:50,630
They're going to be accelerated
when the growth of the population,

6577
02:54:50,650 --> 02:54:53,150
when more and more people
around it's going to,

6578
02:54:53,190 --> 02:54:54,510
there's going to be
more and more problems.

6579
02:54:54,511 --> 02:54:56,850
And then there's going to be
all these technological issues.

6580
02:54:57,120 --> 02:54:58,500
There's going to be cyber crime is,

6581
02:54:58,501 --> 02:54:58,771
it's gonna be,

6582
02:54:58,771 --> 02:55:02,100
it's gonna be really difficult to
keep money in your bank account.

6583
02:55:02,101 --> 02:55:04,040
People are just going to be
stealing from bank accounts

6584
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:04,873
left and right.

6585
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:06,740
You're going to have virtual reality.

6586
02:55:06,890 --> 02:55:10,910
You're going to have people escaping
reality in all sorts of ways that they're

6587
02:55:10,911 --> 02:55:12,020
not really doing yet.

6588
02:55:12,260 --> 02:55:14,570
And that's going to be
just as addictive as crack.

6589
02:55:14,640 --> 02:55:14,781
Yeah.

6590
02:55:14,781 --> 02:55:17,600
It was going to be people that are just
dropping out of society and living in

6591
02:55:17,601 --> 02:55:18,434
the headset.

6592
02:55:18,500 --> 02:55:20,750
I'm going to put on
virtual reality goggles,

6593
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:21,110
you know,

6594
02:55:21,110 --> 02:55:21,943
or we're going to,

6595
02:55:22,070 --> 02:55:26,450
or people are going to be figured out
how to use it and how to make society

6596
02:55:26,451 --> 02:55:27,080
work,

6597
02:55:27,080 --> 02:55:30,170
you know better or educate people more or,

6598
02:55:30,410 --> 02:55:32,180
or allow for communication.

6599
02:55:32,181 --> 02:55:33,050
You know what I mean?

6600
02:55:33,230 --> 02:55:36,230
When you talk about these kids who grew
up with the Internet and other thing

6601
02:55:36,231 --> 02:55:38,180
knew growing up is there
growing up globally,

6602
02:55:39,570 --> 02:55:42,560
they have friends in
Europe and shit like that,

6603
02:55:42,561 --> 02:55:45,080
like that communicate with people
from other countries all the time.

6604
02:55:45,081 --> 02:55:45,740
And you,

6605
02:55:45,740 --> 02:55:48,080
you learn so much.

6606
02:55:48,430 --> 02:55:49,640
Like there's so much cult,

6607
02:55:49,641 --> 02:55:51,860
more culturally savvy because of that.

6608
02:55:51,900 --> 02:55:52,733
Then so,

6609
02:55:52,880 --> 02:55:53,700
eh,

6610
02:55:53,700 --> 02:55:54,830
it's one of those things,

6611
02:55:54,831 --> 02:55:58,610
it's like we can become
much better or much worse.

6612
02:55:58,611 --> 02:55:59,750
And I don't really know.

6613
02:55:59,751 --> 02:56:00,561
Sometimes I think,

6614
02:56:00,561 --> 02:56:00,741
well,

6615
02:56:00,741 --> 02:56:03,080
we're going to be better than
some shit happens you like,

6616
02:56:03,081 --> 02:56:03,914
wow,

6617
02:56:03,980 --> 02:56:05,870
we can't be trusted with anything,

6618
02:56:06,380 --> 02:56:06,861
you know,

6619
02:56:06,861 --> 02:56:08,990
so I don't know.

6620
02:56:09,020 --> 02:56:09,500
Uh,

6621
02:56:09,500 --> 02:56:11,000
I don't know what's going to happen.

6622
02:56:11,030 --> 02:56:11,541
And you know,

6623
02:56:11,541 --> 02:56:12,620
and that's where you have,

6624
02:56:12,621 --> 02:56:14,780
like when you have Trump,

6625
02:56:15,750 --> 02:56:16,100
you know,

6626
02:56:16,100 --> 02:56:16,611
honestly,

6627
02:56:16,611 --> 02:56:21,140
when you have this visit viable
presidential candidate saying what?

6628
02:56:21,141 --> 02:56:25,850
We're going to build a war wall between
here and Mexico cause name on rapists

6629
02:56:25,851 --> 02:56:27,080
and it put my name on it.

6630
02:56:27,110 --> 02:56:27,770
You're like,

6631
02:56:27,770 --> 02:56:28,460
okay.

6632
02:56:28,460 --> 02:56:29,150
No.

6633
02:56:29,150 --> 02:56:29,420
Like,

6634
02:56:29,420 --> 02:56:30,290
that's no,

6635
02:56:30,380 --> 02:56:30,801
you know,

6636
02:56:30,801 --> 02:56:31,580
so,

6637
02:56:31,580 --> 02:56:35,420
well that's like some new land and
Stalin type shit putting his name on it.

6638
02:56:35,421 --> 02:56:35,810
Yeah.

6639
02:56:35,810 --> 02:56:40,810
And yet yet you have a percentage of the
Polish population who honestly believes

6640
02:56:43,041 --> 02:56:43,874
that,

6641
02:56:44,030 --> 02:56:44,690
you know what I mean?

6642
02:56:44,690 --> 02:56:49,690
Like we still have what 40%
of the Republicans in the
south or whatever that's

6643
02:56:51,551 --> 02:56:54,740
still believe Barack
Obama's a Muslim undercover.

6644
02:56:54,830 --> 02:56:56,360
He's not sorry,

6645
02:56:56,361 --> 02:56:57,194
Jill,

6646
02:56:57,440 --> 02:56:58,730
I didn't mean to ruin else.

6647
02:56:58,760 --> 02:57:00,140
I didn't mean to ruin it for you.

6648
02:57:00,560 --> 02:57:01,101
We're out of time.

6649
02:57:01,101 --> 02:57:01,400
Dude.

6650
02:57:01,400 --> 02:57:02,091
We ran out of time,

6651
02:57:02,091 --> 02:57:02,451
man,

6652
02:57:02,451 --> 02:57:02,741
hit that.

6653
02:57:02,741 --> 02:57:03,740
We hit the three hour mark.

6654
02:57:03,800 --> 02:57:04,400
Bam.

6655
02:57:04,400 --> 02:57:05,360
This was amazing.

6656
02:57:05,600 --> 02:57:06,500
It was fun to do it again.

6657
02:57:06,710 --> 02:57:07,170
Do it again.

6658
02:57:07,170 --> 02:57:07,730
Thank you.

6659
02:57:07,730 --> 02:57:08,481
You're in town all the time,

6660
02:57:08,481 --> 02:57:08,600
right?

6661
02:57:08,600 --> 02:57:08,880
Thank you.

6662
02:57:08,880 --> 02:57:09,713
Anytime.

6663
02:57:09,890 --> 02:57:10,990

How do we remember that?

6668
02:57:16,970 --> 02:57:17,803
I don't know.

6669
02:57:18,140 --> 02:57:18,590

Sinai iTunes on jazz.

02:57:26,480 --> 02:57:27,680
All that glorious.

6681
02:57:27,681 --> 02:57:28,131
