1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,013
Do Do,
do

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,390
and we're live.
Ladies and gentlemen with status.

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,270
Russell pretended to be a morning Dj.
Alright.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,520
Hey,
how liberally going out there in the

5
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,920
wild and wacky world of being a
professor?

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,630
I got to leave.
Sorry.

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,830
You gotta leave.
We can't do this.

8
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,440
You didn't get fired since last time?
Not yet.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,680
That's good.
I'm trying hard.

10
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,840
Are you being on here?
Sure.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,990
Doesn't help.
It doesn't.

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,220
Did you get any heat at all?
Yeah,

13
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:34,380
it did actually.
What'd you get heat about it?

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,640
Oh God.
Here we go.

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,850
Uh,
I uh,

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,260
know someone complained about the
podcast.

17
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,140
One person,
someone who was raised,

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,550
someone who was referenced in that,
but not,

19
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:46,000
not by name,
but someone who is referenced.

20
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,310
Oh,
like one of the people that we

21
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:49,290
complained about,
someone complained to the administration

22
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,600
about what we talked about.
Oh my goodness.

23
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,430
And what did they say?
Nothing was done to me.

24
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,500
I don't know.
I was just told that there was a

25
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:57,900
complaint made.
So how does that work?

26
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,410
Did they have to examine every complaint
for a severely?

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,360
They did not.
They didn't pay us.

28
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,560
Yeah,
I was totally,

29
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:08,250
it was a formal complaint,
but then nothing,

30
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,830
as far as I know it was done about it.
So I'm still there,

31
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:12,960
although I'm probably leaving Occidental
anyway.

32
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,540
Oh my goodness.
Is this a news flash?

33
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:16,830
Uh,
yeah,

34
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:18,330
it is actually.
I guess I breaking news.

35
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,660
Yeah.
I might be taking a new position at

36
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:23,940
Willamette University in Oregon.
Oh,

37
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,320
but you got to move up there and I'm
going to split time between Lin and

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:27,871
they're,
oh,

39
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:29,130
you're a glutton for punishment.
Yeah,

40
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,450
my son,
my son is here,

41
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:31,760
so I got to,
yeah,

42
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:34,320
that's how long commute isn't that?
Well,

43
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:35,940
actually hours in a plane.
You know,

44
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:38,670
it's funny.
It's like an hour and a half and then

45
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:41,670
it's about the same as what I'm doing
now between the east side of La and the

46
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:43,650
west side of la where,
where his mother lives.

47
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,960
Um,
so actually it's not that much

48
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:47,340
different.
Different commute for me.

49
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,500
Oh,
the traffic versus the flight?

50
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

51
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,031
I mean,
I haven't done it yet,

52
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:53,790
so we'll see.
But I think it'll work out.

53
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,070
Wow.
What an optimistic fellow you are.

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,460
I Love Oregon though.
It's all so beautiful.

55
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:02,910
And they have water,
they have much water of water and they

56
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:05,040
have green plants.
Everything's green.

57
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,030
It's incredibly great.
Yeah,

58
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:06,441
it's,
it's,

59
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:08,160
it's,
it's an interesting trade off.

60
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:11,220
It's like they get a lot of rain,
but because of that,

61
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:13,770
the,
the grass is like this vibrant,

62
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,470
almost like glowing Greens.
Like the opposite of La.

63
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,540
Yeah.
Everything's alive and lush.

64
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,510
Yeah.
It gets a little dreary though.

65
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,360
Like when you don't see the son,
I'm worried about like February,

66
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,830
March,
April.

67
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:28,320
But I've heard the summers are great.
The summers are amazing.

68
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,230
Same as Seattle.
Like I was just in Seattle recently and

69
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,010
it rained three days in a row and by the
time the third day rolled around we were

70
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:36,000
like,
okay,

71
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:36,890
let's get out of here.

72
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,490
Exactly.
It was fun cause you know,

73
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,190
I was visiting some friends and I was
with my family,

74
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,510
so [inaudible] took the kids and they're
just love the fact that it's different,

75
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:46,770
you know,
because it never rains out here.

76
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:47,820
They're like,
Yay.

77
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,240
You get to go play splashing in puddles
and running around.

78
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:51,810
Yeah.
But if that's every day,

79
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,540
you're like,
oh look,

80
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,540
the 90th day in a row they've had,
I think they had like a flip of rain in

81
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:01,180
the last month they've had a,
but last winter they had like an

82
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,130
incredibly dry winter and it was
amazing.

83
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,060
Yeah.
No,

84
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:05,140
but I'm looking forward to it because
you know,

85
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:08,920
I love hiking and camping in the
mountains and the ocean and all that

86
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,810
stuff.
That's a great spot to be grounded by

87
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:11,080
it.
Yeah.

88
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,990
And you say it's Willamette?
Willamette?

89
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,150
We'll laminate and Sam Salem,
which is just south of Portland.

90
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,230
Oh,
okay.

91
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,100
Wow.
That's awesome.

92
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,600
That's great country up there.
Yeah.

93
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,850
So a,
would that,

94
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,560
was that part of the incentive to get
you to go there?

95
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,810
Well,
the deal is my,

96
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,900
my partner or girlfriend got a job as a
vice president there.

97
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,400
Partner slash girlfriend,
partner,

98
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,091
girlfriend.
I don't know.

99
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,130
I hate that.
There's no good term for it right now.

100
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,780
You're seeing that your special lady
friends were married?

101
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:37,390
You know,
before I was married,

102
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,310
I'd call my wife,
my special lady friend.

103
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,710
But yeah,
sometimes I call her my lady,

104
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,600
but I can't do that on the campus.
You know what I mean?

105
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:45,580
Like you can get in trouble for that.
I get totally in trouble.

106
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:46,780
Yeah.
How hilarious is that?

107
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,700
Well,
since you've been here,

108
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,560
the uh,
social justice warrior,

109
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:54,280
yeah.
Crusade has ramped up considerably.

110
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,220
Um,
including what happened in Yale,

111
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,560
uh,
with the woman who she,

112
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,590
I guess she sent out a letter saying
that you should allow people a certain

113
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,280
amount of leeway to be offensive.

114
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,180
Like you shouldn't,
we shouldn't restrict what kind of

115
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:13,660
costumes kids can wear,
including if they want to wear things

116
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:16,210
that are,
that appropriate other cultures and

117
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:18,010
things along those lines.
So you should give people the

118
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,260
opportunity to be offensive,
I think is what she said.

119
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,094
Right.
Um,

120
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,800
I,
I guess opening up the door for free

121
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:25,450
expression,
the idea is that you're supposed to be

122
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:28,570
learning in these schools.
You're supposed to be exploring

123
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,360
different ways of thinking and whether
or not something is of,

124
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,360
is this a,
is this humorous?

125
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:38,620
Is is valid in our culture or is it not?
Should you be offended?

126
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:40,810
Is it pointless to be offended?
Is it silly?

127
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,660
Does it offend everyone?
If it doesn't offend people who it's

128
00:04:43,661 --> 00:04:47,740
supposed to be culturally appropriating,
then what's,

129
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:50,140
what's it on you?
So it was this opening up this can of

130
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:50,770
worms,
right?

131
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,880
Yeah,
it is.

132
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,130
It's a can of worms.
It's a very complex issue.

133
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:56,050
I mean,
it is a lot to unpack here.

134
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,370
So first of all,
I don't know if you know,

135
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:58,900
she quit for good.
Yes.

136
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:00,760
That professor,
I believe her husband did as well,

137
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:01,960
right?
The Dean,

138
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,450
the Dean of Silliman College.
I didn't think so.

139
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,290
Okay.
I could be wrong.

140
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,430
Um,
so yeah,

141
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:11,740
it's been all over the country.
It's been very intense at Occidental,

142
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:12,574
by the way.
Yeah.

143
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:14,560
And I've been in meetings and I've seen
a lot of it there.

144
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:16,000
I've been sort of in the middle of it.
Um,

145
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,570
it's a,
it's a complete cluster fuck.

146
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,980
There's no doubt about that.
I mean,

147
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:22,510
that's,
that's my scholarly opinion.

148
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,270
It is really,
it's,

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,930
it's gone to the level of being a
caricature of political correctness,

150
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,460
Pcu,
the movie you've ever seen,

151
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:32,800
that it's really,
it really often looks like that.

152
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,780
Yeah.
It's like a south park episode,

153
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:35,960
almost a South Park episode.

154
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,110
It really is to the level of caricature
now.

155
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,510
Um,
and so,

156
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,510
you know,
obviously a lot of what the student

157
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:48,250
protesters are saying is hysteria.
I mean they talk as if they're in

158
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:53,140
Alabama in 1960 when they're actually at
Yale or Occidental college and they are

159
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:56,320
among the most privileged people on the
planet,

160
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,190
right?
Just by being there.

161
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,720
Um,
and uh,

162
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:04,070
many of their demands are essentially
totalitarian,

163
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,860
you know,
demanding diversity training,

164
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:09,560
mandatory diversity training for all
faculty and staff,

165
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:10,220
which,
you know,

166
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,420
I'm assuming would be teaching me how to
think about race and gender and

167
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:15,380
sexuality,
right.

168
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,650
Telling me what I should should say in
my classrooms and not say in my

169
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:20,780
classrooms.
Um,

170
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,570
that Occidental,
the faculty themselves,

171
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:25,580
some of the faculty,
I actually took it upon themselves to

172
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:27,300
propose,
uh,

173
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,530
a mechanism in which students can report
micro aggressions committed against them

174
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,780
by five faculty.
The faculty,

175
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,280
the students didn't even demand this.

176
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,570
How is this happening?
I will say,

177
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:43,250
I will say,
just to be clear here,

178
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,970
it hasn't been voted.
The faculty hasn't voted for that yet,

179
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,100
but it was a significant minority of
faculty propose that significant like

180
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,310
30% probably around there.
Yeah,

181
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,090
I'd say about a third to a,
a mechanism to report microaggressions.

182
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,010
Microaggressions.
Meaning like,

183
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,180
Oh,
90 shirt.

184
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,950
Well,
I could look at you and go,

185
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,710
nice shirt.
We can be specific because they've

186
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:10,610
actually listed micro aggressions in
many places and one of them is asking

187
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:12,320
the question,
where are you from?

188
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,830
Oh my God.
Oh God,

189
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:17,330
that's a microaggression.
Where are you from?

190
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:19,100
Is One way.
Where are you from?

191
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,010
Uh,
another one is what are you all right,

192
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,910
what are you
following up with?

193
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:30,260
What are you really well,
what are you seems like a good question

194
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:33,110
today because you have to be really
careful with gender pronouns.

195
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,420
Indeed.
So why can't you just say,

196
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,580
what are you,
what are you doesn't seem offensive at

197
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:39,940
all.
Could be you could be a g j uh,

198
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,020
she,
uhZ,

199
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,150
,
I'm not even sure how it's pronounced,

200
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,830
but,
but when someone says,

201
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:49,040
what are you like,
I think that that's gender neutral.

202
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,870
So that's actually should be politically
correct.

203
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,010
Oh yeah.
But it's not race neutral.

204
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,420
Oh,
okay.

205
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:54,950
So it's a question about race,
right?

206
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,460
But why is it a question about race?
You're like a Mulatto Looking,

207
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:02,690
oh mama say Mulatto and don't think
you'll have a similar story from 1971

208
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,450
it's not good.
No,

209
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,910
but I don't even believe it's,
it shouldn't be mixed race because

210
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,200
you're,
you're a human,

211
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,660
you know,
it's all one race that's been proven

212
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,850
scientifically.
It could.

213
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,300
The question is what race are you?
Which is sort of a silly question and a

214
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:21,330
little bit terrible question.

215
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,460
Slightly rude.
Sure.

216
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,770
But it's also like scientifically
invalid.

217
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,240
Yeah.
Because there's only one race.

218
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,440
It might be different ethnicities,
different parts of the world where your

219
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:34,190
ancestors and different cultures,
but he's the only one race.

220
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,800
Like this idea of what's your race?
It's fucking stupid.

221
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,640
Yeah,
absolutely.

222
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,710
But so that's,
but that's considered to be that kind of

223
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:43,310
ignorance is considered to be violent.
And I mean that violence,

224
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,500
hostile racism,
because the refresh,

225
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,680
the refrain is we are unsafe on this
campus.

226
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,120
That's,
that's the word that's used.

227
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,830
If someone says,
what are you doing?

228
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,430
You become unsafe.
Yes,

229
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,950
I am.
That's not an exaggeration.

230
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,790
Sure.
That's exactly what it said guys with

231
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,350
hoods and yeah,
so,

232
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:02,640
right,
so coaches,

233
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,070
there's this incredible conflation that
goes on,

234
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:10,071
which drives me insane because certainly
there is some racism on campuses.

235
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,530
You know,
there is some racial insensitivity,

236
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:16,290
no doubt,
but they conflate that stuff that goes

237
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:21,291
on at Yale with Ferguson and Baltimore
and Birmingham,

238
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:26,760
Alabama in 1956 and South Africa under
apartheid,

239
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,540
right?

240
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,520
It all becomes the same thing,
right?

241
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:31,560
It all becomes white supremacy.
It's all racism.

242
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:34,290
It's all structural racism.
It's all systemic racism.

243
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,960
Uh,
and so we need to start sort of

244
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,530
differentiating here cause there's
clearly some differences among those.

245
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,520
So what are you as one,
what are you really is the followup,

246
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:47,310
which is like the death where you
doubled down on your racism.

247
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,210
Um,
what are some other ones?

248
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:51,390
So it would make me feel like a double
micro aggression,

249
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,920
but it's the mother one.
Um,

250
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,263
where are you from?
Who are,

251
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,620
what are you?
Um,

252
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,150
well then there's things,
you know,

253
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:04,680
that there's things that clearly are
rude,

254
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,120
possibly racist,
like you're really smart or you're

255
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:12,450
really articulate to a black person.
Wait a minute,

256
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,730
wait a minute.
Wait,

257
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,550
wait.
Why?

258
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,530
Why?
What if he's really articulate?

259
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,260
What if he talking to a woman and she's
black and she's super articulate and you

260
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:20,791
know,
wow,

261
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:21,810
you're really articulate.

262
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,860
Or whether you're talking to a white man
and he's really articulate and go,

263
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:27,300
wow,
you're really articulate.

264
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,860
As I said,
it might be racist,

265
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,900
but it might just be a compliment.
Well,

266
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:32,580
it's just that,
that's what's often been said.

267
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,443
I mean,
you have to understand.

268
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,530
I do often been said,
you know,

269
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,980
remember what Joe Biden said about Obama
during the election,

270
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:38,930
right?
He said he's very,

271
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,740
the people like him,
cause he's so articulate and well

272
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:41,391
spoken,
right?

273
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,050
It's,
it's what's classically been said,

274
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,110
but why is that racist?
That's just show model black people.

275
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:48,210
Why is that racist?
Because you're comparing him to the

276
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:49,740
former president,
George W.

277
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,610
Bush was totally the opposite of that
was not right.

278
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,180
He was terrible at it.
So when you get a guy like Obama,

279
00:10:54,181 --> 00:10:56,130
he's clearly articulate,
intelligent,

280
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,870
right?
Why is that racist at all?

281
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,471
Well,
again,

282
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:01,170
it's because it's been said about the
model black person.

283
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,170
Right?
Uh,

284
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,430
but unless you use it in that context,
unless you say as a black guy,

285
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,290
he's very articulate.
Right?

286
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,090
Which has been said to you on campuses.
You know,

287
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,960
and often they'll say things like,
to a black guy in particular,

288
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:13,980
oh,
you must be an athlete.

289
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,590
You must be on a sports team.
Um,

290
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,290
what if they're yoked yet?
Well,

291
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:22,130
with their black higher and the fucking,
you know,

292
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,300
right.
They could just like Lebron James,

293
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:26,310
Physics major lifts a lot of weights
though.

294
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,360
Come on,
Jay could be,

295
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,430
but I mean,
why is that a bad thing to say you,

296
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,090
you must be really good moving your
body.

297
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,890
It's footing it.
Annoy you.

298
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,431
It wouldn't.
No,

299
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:36,120
you wouldn't.
It.

300
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,420
What if somebody asks you if you were
black and someone said that to you,

301
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,610
oh,
you're here because you must be on the

302
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,480
floor.
Okay.

303
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:45,150
Well if it was that,
if it was like the insinuation that the

304
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:48,270
only reason why you got into the college
was because of your athletic prowess,

305
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,710
not your intelligence,
what it is.

306
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,371
Yeah.
Okay.

307
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:51,810
Yeah.
That these things are not completely

308
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,740
groundless.
It's not,

309
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:53,980
it's mostly

310
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,390
hysteria.
I see what you're saying.

311
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,120
There is a lot that's legitimate.
That's real.

312
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:00,190
That I understand that I have compassion
for,

313
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,770
I've never been a black person.
I've never been a black college student,

314
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:06,550
but I've always been sure that it must
be at least uncomfortable for black

315
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:08,830
people on the,
on these campuses that are mostly white.

316
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,990
Yeah.
In some circumstances for sure.

317
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,840
Well that makes sense.
But I mean it seems like socially that

318
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:17,020
stuff all weeds itself out.
Like people realize who the decks are

319
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,400
and you avoid those people.
They said we were talking about like the

320
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:26,401
word microaggression is suitable for
that and that is a micro aggression.

321
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:28,120
It's so micro,
it's all like,

322
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,360
it's this kind of slightly dicky.
Right.

323
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:35,440
And so the question is do you have a
macro response to a micro grid in its

324
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,830
form of policy,
which limits freedom of speech?

325
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,450
Which limits academic freedom,
which you rex the surveillance system.

326
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,140
Right.
Essentially,

327
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,720
which is essentially what they're asking
for with microaggressions.

328
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,770
Uh,
limits,

329
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:50,370
humor to it certainly limits humor.
It eliminates,

330
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,190
well,
you know,

331
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,930
college campuses,
there's no,

332
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,540
there's no fun being had.
I mean there's no end though.

333
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,410
Funniness right.
It's a,

334
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,140
it's in fact,
I was just talking about this with

335
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:00,250
someone the other night.
They said,

336
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:02,260
well,
you guys are crack a lot of jokes.

337
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:02,630
I said,
no,

338
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,463
no,
there are no,

339
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,480
there no jobs.
They used to be like animal house.

340
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:08,950
No,
I mean I do,

341
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,580
I do joke in my classroom,
but sort of the space outside of the

342
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:16,540
classroom on campus,
sort of in public arenas on campus.

343
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:20,170
No,
you've gotta be really dour and earnest

344
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:21,730
all the time.
Oh God.

345
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,950
It's so tiresome.
It certainly is,

346
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,170
but that's not life.
Now.

347
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:27,440
What are they preparing people for?

348
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,510
That's the thing.
Right.

349
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,800
Um,
you know,

350
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:31,420
so I mean,
what if you're going to,

351
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,600
John mcwhorter is this brilliant black
Columbia linguistics professor.

352
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,920
Micro microaggression.
Yeah.

353
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:39,340
Right?
Yeah.

354
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,180
I say black.
I did,

355
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:41,950
I'm sorry.
Uh,

356
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,750
to him and everyone,
he has said that when he was in college

357
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:50,950
in the 1980s,
he heard a few times statements that

358
00:13:50,951 --> 00:13:54,170
were clearly racist that we're even sort
of hostile and racist eating.

359
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,270
They're not no doubt about it.
He said,

360
00:13:55,271 --> 00:14:00,271
but he said it never occurred to me that
I might be damaged by that.

361
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,490
That it might hurt me to hear these
things.

362
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,520
I just assumed that these people were
worthless when they said it.

363
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,340
That they're like gum on my shoe.
Yeah,

364
00:14:09,341 --> 00:14:13,780
exactly right.
So what's happening now is kids on

365
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:18,781
campuses either have been trained or
have trained themselves to feel damaged.

366
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,400
Devastated is the word actually that's
often used by things like micro

367
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:26,890
aggressions.
Hmm.

368
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,380
Well,
so that what you're doing is you are

369
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:34,590
stating and claiming status as a weak
person,

370
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,330
right?
Someone who can be damaged by the

371
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:38,620
slightest.
Slight.

372
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,900
Right?
So then what happens when you're in the

373
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:43,090
real world where there really are
racists,

374
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,700
where there really are people who will
pull you over for being black,

375
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,490
who will throw him in prison for being
black,

376
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:51,710
who will shoot you for being black,
who will not give you a job for black,

377
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,390
you know,
real racism,

378
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:55,310
real structural racism.
What do you do then?

379
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,040
Well,
I think the idea is that they're going

380
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:03,041
to eliminate that by raising people
through their system that never have

381
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:04,550
these thoughts.
Um,

382
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,230
so we're gonna clean up the world.
If that were a plan,

383
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,260
at least it would be a plan.
I don't see that as the plan though.

384
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,600
Well,
the professional victim status,

385
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,280
that that's a real issue because people
claiming to be victims when there is no

386
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:23,150
real problem.
They're looking for victims.

387
00:15:23,151 --> 00:15:24,560
They're looking for,
rather,

388
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:27,590
we're looking for things that are
targeting them.

389
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,190
And I always assumed that the reason why
people do that is because there's not

390
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:35,030
enough real problems.
The real problems have become so minute.

391
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,310
Like this is the safest time to live
ever.

392
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,140
And on campus.
I mean,

393
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,180
outside of the normal things that you're
going to deal with when you have a bunch

394
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:46,850
of young people together and you know,
uh,

395
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,080
social interactions and alcohol and all
the other crap that happens between

396
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:52,730
human beings,
when you get them together in a young,

397
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:55,460
and they don't have,
even when they're older,

398
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:57,560
you know,
you get a group of people together,

399
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,360
you're likely to have some disputes.

400
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,880
But outside of that,
what's the fucking worst thing that's

401
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:04,100
happening in these kids?
I think I actually looked up the

402
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:05,360
statistics because I,
you know,

403
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:07,880
people during,
when the Missouri thing was happening at

404
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:08,960
the University of Missouri,
right?

405
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,070
Yes.
Claims about,

406
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:12,620
you know,
nigger being said and you know,

407
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,380
racist violence in there.
And I thought,

408
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:16,400
really,
is that possible?

409
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:17,091
So I looked it up.
I mean,

410
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:18,890
there's not,
there has not been a,

411
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,630
a racist hate crime on a college campus
in the United States in 30 years.

412
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,280
Wow.
And in fact,

413
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:26,540
in that one,
which was in the early,

414
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,920
uh,
30 years ago was a guy who wasn't a

415
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:32,480
student.
He wasn't affiliated with the campus at

416
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:35,480
all with the college at all.
Who bombed some dormitory that had black

417
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:37,610
people in it.
So basically it's,

418
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:39,530
yes,
of course it is an extremely safe place

419
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,364
to be.

420
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,940
And everyone don't you think that in
those extremely safe environments,

421
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,780
sometimes people just go around looking
for problems that don't exist?

422
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:48,291
Well,
I mean,

423
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:52,970
this has been the case at an American
colleges for decades.

424
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,680
I mean,
when I was in college in the 1980s,

425
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,580
that's all we did.
We,

426
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,030
we needed to fight the devil we needed
to.

427
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,170
And then,
then you had to find the devil.

428
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:01,810
And the problem was he wasn't there.
Right.

429
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,920
The Ku Klux Klan wasn't actually on
campus.

430
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:06,080
Right.
The police weren't even really on

431
00:17:06,081 --> 00:17:07,250
campus.
You know,

432
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:11,300
you didn't have these terrible sexist
and racist on campus,

433
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:14,120
so you had to invent them.
And what you did was you invented them

434
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:16,520
in the form of the president of the
college often.

435
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:18,470
Right.
He became the villain that you had to

436
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:19,191
attack.
Right.

437
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:21,200
And I did that.
Um,

438
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,460
and that's what's going on now.
So the,

439
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:25,820
one of the main demands of students at
Occidental was the resignation of the

440
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:26,570
president.

441
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,980
Why?
What did he do wrong?

442
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,840
It's a great question and I haven't
actually gotten a specific answer to

443
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:35,600
that.
There's no answer cause he a white guy.

444
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,740
Yeah.
Well fuck him.

445
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,220
Well he embodies privilege.
Of course he does.

446
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,760
Uh,
but everyone at Occidental and buddy's

447
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,200
privileged,
everyone does.

448
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,990
Right?
Everyone at Yale and bodies privilege.

449
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,720
Right.
Of course.

450
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,160
Will students as faculty of luck,
Asca,

451
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,210
Filipino peasant,
you know what they think of student

452
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:53,370
yells at students at Yale,
whether they're privileged or not,

453
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:54,070
right?
Yes.

454
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,720
Um,
so does it have specific trees?

455
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,680
A tremendous lack of specificity,
which also drives me crazy.

456
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,720
Um,
I often say,

457
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,700
I don't even know what they're talking
about.

458
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,380
I be,
and I don't know what's happened to

459
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:09,180
them.
What has he actually done?

460
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,150
So there's been a demand for a black
studies program at Occidental for

461
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:13,530
decades,
since the 60s.

462
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:15,030
Okay.
So that hasn't been instituted.

463
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:17,310
But you know,
he's only the most recent president who

464
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:18,540
hasn't done that.
And by the way,

465
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,330
it's a faculty decision anyway,
whether I have a black studies program.

466
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,780
Other than that,
I couldn't even tell you.

467
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,860
I really couldn't tell you.
It's so racial charge kind of.

468
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,840
It's also about the sexual assault
stuff.

469
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:36,410
But the sexual assault stuff was so
bizarre and also lacking in specificity

470
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,980
there.
They're being sued by the young man who

471
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:44,670
was accused of sexual assault while the
woman that he had sex with was not.

472
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,470
Yes.
And the reason why he was accused of

473
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:48,290
being,
of being the assaulter,

474
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,620
it's cause he's a male.
Well,

475
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:51,300
they were both drinking,
but that's the only,

476
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,340
that's the only conclusion you could
draw for.

477
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,350
People don't know the story.
You can google the story.

478
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,450
It's fascinating.
And we talked about it the last time we

479
00:18:57,451 --> 00:18:58,740
were here.
Um,

480
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,300
but,
uh,

481
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,210
a man and a woman,
because they're both over 18,

482
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,250
they were going to college there.
They,

483
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:07,770
uh,
got liquored up and decided to hook up

484
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,840
and they exchanged some text messages
where she said,

485
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:10,650
do you have condoms?

486
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,920
Come on over.
And she told her friend,

487
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,220
I'm going to have sex,
lol,

488
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:15,900
that kind of thing.
And uh,

489
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:19,410
after they had sex,
someone either convinced her or she

490
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:24,030
convinced herself that it was rape.
Because when two people are drinking,

491
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:28,050
the woman cannot.
Consent was the only time in the world

492
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:31,170
where you're not responsible for your
actions because you've been drinking.

493
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,790
If you get in a car and you drank and
you drive drunk and plow into people,

494
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,780
you can never say,
I'm not responsible because I was drunk

495
00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:41,190
and he can't say that.
But for whatever reason,

496
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,810
these social justice warriors have taken
upon themselves to,

497
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,680
again,
in part victim status only on women that

498
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:52,620
are in these scenarios.
So that the man is always the ugly

499
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:55,170
oppressor,
the ugly pursuer,

500
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,500
the penetrator of the vagina is evil
man.

501
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,440
And so this kid got kicked out of
college for having sex while drunk.

502
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,420
That's really what it is.
The most outrageous thing was at the

503
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:07,770
college itself actually officially
determined that the sex was consensual.

504
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,720
Yeah.
But he got expelled.

505
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,880
Yeah.
And he's suing now.

506
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:14,260
He should fucking close that place down.
Yeah.

507
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,620
And then light it on fire and turn it to
Disneyland too.

508
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,741
Yeah.
I mean,

509
00:20:19,741 --> 00:20:23,370
I think a revolution is coming or it's
maybe already begun in higher education,

510
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,420
you know?
Wow.

511
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,010
Well,
I think what we're doing right now,

512
00:20:26,011 --> 00:20:27,840
I think what you've been doing,
I think stuff like this,

513
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:29,430
I think podcasting,
I think,

514
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,760
uh,
it started with blogs 20 years ago now.

515
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:37,761
There's all sorts of online courses.
I think there's a tremendous demand for

516
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,800
learning and I think there are a lot of
curious people out there who can't

517
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:44,130
afford to go to college or don't want to
go to these nut houses that are

518
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:46,950
colleges.
But what is it that's causing these not

519
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,040
houses to,
to

520
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,360
flourish this way where it's so common.
It's not an oddity.

521
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,440
It's not just dartmouth where they
stormed into the library or the,

522
00:20:56,441 --> 00:20:57,970
uh,
the study hall and started screaming

523
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:02,800
black lives matter while fucking white
and black people were going over their

524
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:04,720
work.
They're sitting there trying to do their

525
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,650
homework and all these fucking white
dorks are running through the hallway

526
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:10,060
screen.
Black lives matter,

527
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,160
black lives matter.
And I'm watching that.

528
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:15,160
I'm going,
why is this like these people aren't

529
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:16,180
oppressors,
the,

530
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,130
their,
their students or fellow students,

531
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:20,620
like,
and you're being shamed if you don't

532
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:23,620
join in,
you're being shamed if you don't stop

533
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:26,230
whatever you're doing.
What is this?

534
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,310
How is this happening?

535
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,790
It's so difficult to unpack.
Well,

536
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,540
so here's it actually.
It actually stems from a sort of

537
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:39,541
sophisticated social theory,
which is that discourse can be violence.

538
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,500
That discourse is power and discourse
can therefore be violence.

539
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,940
Just stay with me.
I know.

540
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,900
Um,
and so if discourse is violence than any

541
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:55,420
means are necessary to defend oneself
from discursive violence.

542
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,350
Oh boy.
Right?

543
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,140
And then on top of that,
and I agree with this part,

544
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,490
I mean silence can be discourse to,
right,

545
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,830
right.
So sure.

546
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,140
Silence in the case of these kids in the
Dartmouth Library,

547
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:06,430
right,
was violence.

548
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,390
If you carry that argument to its
logical extreme,

549
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:12,250
which is what obviously is happening
here,

550
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:14,890
it's a perversion of French
poststructuralism,

551
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,760
which made this intervention about 40
years ago about discourse being power

552
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:20,410
and,
and also being violence.

553
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,780
So that's,
they're kind of running with the idea.

554
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,650
And if you run with it all the way,
it becomes totalitarian.

555
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,440
Right.
And then you're back in like Maoist

556
00:22:28,441 --> 00:22:29,730
China.
Uh,

557
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:34,690
because everyone who says the wrong
thing or doesn't say the right thing is

558
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:38,920
a criminal is an enemy and must be dealt
with by any means necessary.

559
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,700
Oh
yeah.

560
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:43,534
No,
it's bad.

561
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:44,411
It's bad.
Now,

562
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:49,411
the good news is that right now these
people don't have much power.

563
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,540
Right.
They aren't right now these kids aren't

564
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:56,890
running congress.
The bad news is that they will be

565
00:22:56,891 --> 00:23:00,460
running America pretty soon,
but isn't the good news is that with

566
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:04,000
time and maturity and life experiences,
they'll become like you.

567
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,160
One would hope we're like them.
Yes.

568
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:07,660
I was.
One would hope,

569
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:09,730
and that's it's probably true to some
extent.

570
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:11,290
However,
I don't know if you know about this,

571
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:16,291
but there's been some recent polling
done of millennials by the Pew Research

572
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,950
Organization and they found that
millennials are much more hostile to the

573
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:23,620
principle of free speech than previous
generations.

574
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,410
Yeah.
I saw that the students in Yale,

575
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:29,740
actually,
there was a significant majority voted

576
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,660
to resend the first amendment.
Yup.

577
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,223
Yeah.
No,

578
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,490
no.
What is this?

579
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,491
What is that,
Jay?

580
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:38,200
We,
do you know what that one is that that

581
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,103
that study,
they,

582
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,440
I think it was like 39% or something.
Some,

583
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:42,700
yeah.
Saying amounts about,

584
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:43,301
right?
Yeah.

585
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:46,250
I mean they're really,
they state

586
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,880
regulation of speech.
That is so crazy.

587
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,530
Not a majority,
I don't think,

588
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:55,760
but a hefty minority of millennials do
in a larger,

589
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,860
a larger portion of them than any other
generation,

590
00:23:57,861 --> 00:23:59,660
whatever.
40% of millennials.

591
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:01,850
Okay.
With limiting speech defenses to mind

592
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,010
there in minorities.
Hefty minority.

593
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:07,160
There you go.
But do they understand like what,

594
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,620
what the state is,
so that's really depressing.

595
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,960
That's something to be afraid of.
Yeah,

596
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,940
because these are the people that,
as I said,

597
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:15,740
they have no institutional power now,
but they will.

598
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,630
They will.
Yeah.

599
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,580
These are,
these are kids in elite colleges who

600
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:20,414
believe this.
Right?

601
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,130
What do you,
what,

602
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:22,370
what do you think those elite colleges
do?

603
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:25,820
They train people to take power people.
It's like,

604
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,320
well,
if you asked anyone,

605
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:31,040
no one thinks that you should say rude
things to minorities.

606
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,040
No one thinks you should say offensive
things to anybody.

607
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:39,020
No one thinks that.
But when you decide what is offensive

608
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,700
and what you shouldn't,
shouldn't say,

609
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,610
you limit discourse,
you,

610
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,221
you,
you,

611
00:24:43,221 --> 00:24:47,710
you have power over other people's
ability to express themselves and you,

612
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,340
you,
what you do is you create these splinter

613
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:51,950
groups where people get off together and
they fucking,

614
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:53,370
they closed the blinds and go,
yeah,

615
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:55,420
all right,
now it's time to talk about Mexico.

616
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,900
Exactly.
And they get together and they say

617
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:59,210
racist shit and the Fintech groups,
right?

618
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,870
So you can,
you can see it like in comments sections

619
00:25:02,871 --> 00:25:03,561
on the web,
right?

620
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:05,750
You can see it and read it and you can
see it anywhere.

621
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,090
There's a novice users on the,
on the Internet,

622
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,010
right?
That's what repression does.

623
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:12,320
I mean,
there's like clearly hardcore racism and

624
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:15,590
sexism and misogyny and rape culture in
those corners.

625
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,210
Yes.
It's all anonymous.

626
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:17,780
Right?
And these are,

627
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,330
these are the repressed,
this is the repressed talking.

628
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,560
Yes.
That's what happens.

629
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,820
Right?
And um,

630
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,600
so yeah,
but it's also,

631
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,870
I think it's even worse than this,
right?

632
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:29,000
Because as I said the last time I was
here,

633
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:29,834
you know,
it's,

634
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,020
it is inherently conservative what
they're calling for,

635
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:34,640
even though it's a sort of a left wing
movement.

636
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,290
They're asking for big brother,
either the college president or the

637
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:44,291
United States government to protect us
from ideas and speech and words.

638
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,070
Right?
So then what are we interested in?

639
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:51,310
We're interested in those people having
the power,

640
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,980
having more power.
That doesn't sound very left wing or

641
00:25:54,981 --> 00:25:57,420
liberatory to know or radical at all.
No.

642
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,480
And even these ideas,
I mean,

643
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,910
to stray slightly from this,
when,

644
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:06,350
when people are talking about socialism,
ideas about taxing the rich moore.

645
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,000
Well,
where the fuck do you think that money's

646
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,860
going?
Exactly.

647
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,430
Can I go to the government going to
Bernie Sanders?

648
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,293
Yeah.
Well,

649
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,370
when Bernie Sanders says that,
I'm like,

650
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:14,680
Bernie,
do you,

651
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:15,800
are you,
you,

652
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:18,830
you're a senator.
You understand where this money goes to

653
00:26:18,831 --> 00:26:19,441
him as,
I mean,

654
00:26:19,441 --> 00:26:20,600
I mean,
it goes to him to control.

655
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:23,660
Well,
it's the idea behind you take more money

656
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:27,410
from people and give to the government
to make things even that is fucking

657
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:29,630
crazy talk.
That's not how it works.

658
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,160
If you want to encourage charitable
donations on a wide scale and encourage

659
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,800
some sort of like broad range
philanthropists from uh,

660
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:42,260
amongst people and figure out some way
to institute that voluntarily,

661
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
that's great.
But,

662
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,330
but Joe,
we all know that when you give the

663
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:47,640
government lots of money,
it uses it wisely.

664
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,600
Oh,
that's true.

665
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,280
I forgot.
And it doesn't ever use the money to

666
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:51,190
hurt anyone.
No,

667
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,950
never know that.
And they never wasted.

668
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,060
You're being silly.
Yeah,

669
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:55,890
I'm right.
But that actually is sort of this,

670
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,863
that is,
I mean,

671
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,170
it is that absurd.

672
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,790
I mean,
that's the assumption underneath this is

673
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:02,550
that if we give them more money,
they're going to do nice things with it.

674
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,490
They're going to feed orphans with it.
I had a friend.

675
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,050
No,
actually they're going to drop bombs on

676
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:08,990
orphans 100%.
I mean,

677
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,440
you can look,
either you don't get a,

678
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,300
um,
like a,

679
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:17,160
an itemized sheet of where your money
when like phone bombs,

680
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,560
I'm all for that.
Itemized taxes.

681
00:27:19,561 --> 00:27:20,500
Yeah,
it'd be amazing.

682
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,550
Would it be amazing to,
if we can link it up online where

683
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:25,710
everybody could take your itemized tax
sheets and say,

684
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,960
okay,
let's just make sure that they used all

685
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:30,780
of our money.
Everybody submit your itemized tax

686
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:34,200
sheets so we can show we're all,
we're missing $1 billion.

687
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:35,820
How weird where?
How Fun would that be?

688
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,050
Be like Afghanistan?
No.

689
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,450
Yeah.
Well we don't even have any idea where

690
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:40,080
our money goes.

691
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,070
It's one of the weirdest things cause
you give a significant percentage if you

692
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:45,120
make more than,
what is it?

693
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:49,920
$250,000 a year.
You pay 40% plus in taxes.

694
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,520
I think that's the number.
That's how a lot of money and you don't,

695
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,610
you don't even get a receipt less than
in Scandinavia.

696
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,970
The taxes,
how much they give them for the wealthy.

697
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,670
I Dunno,
but I think it bumps up against 90 in

698
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:04,290
some countries.
90 I think so.

699
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,450
Yeah.
90% tax.

700
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,293
It's around there.
Yeah.

701
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,320
Isn't that what Bernie wants to do?
He's a Scandinavian social democrat.

702
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,510
Yeah.
Where's all that money going?

703
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,670
The problem with that.
It's like even if you do that,

704
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,300
like his ideas as they've been explained
to me by people who understand the

705
00:28:18,301 --> 00:28:22,050
economy,
like you'd have to charge $18 trillion

706
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,920
as the number.
Yeah.

707
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,920
You would have to tax everyone in this
country 100% of everything they make and

708
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:29,190
you still wouldn't have enough money,
right?

709
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:29,670
Yeah.
If you,

710
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,130
if you liquidated all the assets of all
the wealthy,

711
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,880
I'll all the wind percent even I think
the 2% you couldn't pay for his stuff.

712
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,270
They've done the math.
This is not even controversial.

713
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:40,920
Like he's even admitted this,
he's admitted this.

714
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:42,720
So what does he say he did?
They did on Bill Maher.

715
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,460
Actually just a few,
like a couple months ago,

716
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:45,571
he said,
well,

717
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:48,370
maybe I guess we'd have to tax the
middle class a bit to something.

718
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,640
Of course you would,
of course,

719
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:53,490
$18 trillion what he's calling for.
Um,

720
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,340
maybe it would make this society a
better society.

721
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:59,550
I mean I liked the idea of free
healthcare and maybe free education,

722
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:02,760
but then again,
when we're talking about in that case is

723
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:07,470
public education for everyone.
Public education is run by whom?

724
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:09,800
It's run by the government.
Yeah.

725
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,200
Do you want people need to think more
clearly about this.

726
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Like isn't there a way to do free
education online with ads the way,

727
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:20,280
the way you have youtube ads?
Totally.

728
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,070
Why wouldn't you do that?
I mean as long as the ads aren't

729
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:24,990
offensive and well as long as the ads
aren't,

730
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,940
you know,
some ridiculous property.

731
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:29,700
That's exactly the question that should
be raised with Bernie Sanders and his

732
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:30,540
supporters.
Right?

733
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,420
Why?
Why do we need a government run

734
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:34,590
education system?
Why do you,

735
00:29:34,591 --> 00:29:37,230
what are different way?
Why do you want that?

736
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,810
Because I think there's something else
going on here with them.

737
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,480
I don't think it's just they want free
education for everyone.

738
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,690
I do think they're interested in social
control and that's a great way to

739
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:50,110
control the populace is to control their
education,

740
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,460
right?
For the government to control their

741
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:52,750
education.
So when you say there,

742
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,710
they are interested in social control,
like to what extent you'd have to ask

743
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,130
them?

744
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,000
I mean,
I don't know.

745
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,360
Why hasn't this,
especially because every socialist has

746
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:02,530
been interested in that.
I mean,

747
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:03,910
that's,
I used to be a socialist.

748
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:06,280
I hung out with socialist.
My parents were revolutionary

749
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:07,810
socialists.
I've studied them.

750
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,270
How many bills did you have to pay
before you stopped being a socialist one

751
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,830
witness?
Which I know is when I looked at my

752
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:19,680
parents' tax returns and saw that they
made $11,000 a year in the 1970s is it?

753
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,270
Oh,
this is,

754
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,090
seems like not,
not much fun to me.

755
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,680
Uh,
yeah.

756
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,990
So yeah,
it's,

757
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:26,520
it's,
it's a,

758
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,130
it's,
it's,

759
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,470
there's a,
there's a longstanding tradition of a

760
00:30:29,471 --> 00:30:32,010
desire for social control on the left.
There's nothing about that.

761
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,540
I mean,
the progressive's 120 years ago,

762
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,970
and then the hardcore socialists and the
contract deal,

763
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,970
the right used to be,
it would leave you alone.

764
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,900
That was the idea of conservatives was
that it would leave you alone,

765
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:44,080
right.

766
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,810
That you,
you know,

767
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,430
they didn't want big government.
They didn't want the government

768
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:53,431
interfering with your life.
But then it sort of got confused and

769
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:56,590
then it became,
it became a lot of religious issues

770
00:30:56,591 --> 00:31:00,940
involved in the Reagan administration.
Once they started incorporating,

771
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,610
um,
the religious right into their,

772
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,750
their,
their plans,

773
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,690
like when they started using the
religious right in order to get into

774
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:10,660
power and to vote,
that's the things started getting really

775
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:15,010
weird because then conservativism wasn't
necessarily leave people on.

776
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:19,090
Then it became about gay rights.
It became about gay marriage and all

777
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:21,850
those other weird stuff started getting
in there.

778
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,080
Right.
Well,

779
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,390
yeah.
So the right that you're talking about,

780
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:26,890
we now call the old,
right,

781
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,820
because it no longer exists pretty much.
There's a little tiny magazine called

782
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:34,000
the American conservative where you can
find the old right and call themselves

783
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:35,260
Paleo conservatives now.

784
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,860
Paleoconservative that's hilarious.
So it's a,

785
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,340
that's a tiny little faction,
but they're interesting and,

786
00:31:41,341 --> 00:31:44,350
and I sorta liked them at least because
they're truly conservatives,

787
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,390
but it used to be,
it used to be about fiscal

788
00:31:46,391 --> 00:31:48,180
responsibility.
You still see it.

789
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:48,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

790
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,910
But also leaving people alone.
Right.

791
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,520
And then what we got was,
was the neoconservatives,

792
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,301
right?
And so,

793
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:55,991
well,
there's two things.

794
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:57,520
There's two.
The wing you're talking about is the

795
00:31:57,521 --> 00:32:00,430
religious right.
We came along and you've summarized that

796
00:32:00,431 --> 00:32:02,380
really well,
but then also the neoconservatives came

797
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:05,410
along who really were progressive's to
begin with.

798
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:08,470
And that's,
those are the people who have run the

799
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:11,560
United States into Iraq and Afghanistan
and around the world,

800
00:32:11,561 --> 00:32:12,520
right?
Um,

801
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,750
sort of right wing intellectuals,
sort of around the Bush administration

802
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:21,751
in particular who are very aligned with
Israel and want it to protect Israel,

803
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:26,791
but also most importantly wanted to make
the world in America's image very much

804
00:32:26,831 --> 00:32:28,360
committed to that vision.
Right?

805
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:31,090
And they started off as actually
progressive's or even socialists.

806
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:32,470
Right?
And if you think about it,

807
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,640
progressivism and socialism is
homogenizing ideology.

808
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,310
It's the,
you're interested in making everyone

809
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,243
same

810
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,120
equality,
right?

811
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,130
Right.
And if you have cultural sameness,

812
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,600
you will,
you will reach,

813
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,790
uh,
economic sameness as well.

814
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,600
So that's where they come from.
That's who took over the Bush

815
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:54,110
administration to make the world in the
image of the United States.

816
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:58,040
You got to invade places,
you got to send the army in to take over

817
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,220
and teach them how to live properly to
live like Americans.

818
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:02,840
And that's exactly what Iraq was all
about.

819
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,520
The Iraq war.
That's exactly what Afghanistan,

820
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:09,650
the Afghanistan occupation is about.
The textbooks being taught to Afghany

821
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:13,280
children right now were written by the
United States army.

822
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,170
Whoa.
Yeah.

823
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,900
It's in the New York Times.
I mean they publish this,

824
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:21,770
I mean it's the United States Army wrote
the history textbooks that are being

825
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:25,970
used in Afghany schools right now.
Do they have historians at work for the

826
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:29,810
army for probably they hired somebody
who was willing to write the proper

827
00:33:29,811 --> 00:33:30,740
history for them.

828
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,690
Yeah.
So then they vet it,

829
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,180
make sure that it fits their standard.
Yeah.

830
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,000
I'm sure.
Uh,

831
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,180
I,
according to the times,

832
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,280
there is no mention of the Afghanistan
war in those textbooks.

833
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,330
What?
Yeah.

834
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,310
Well cause you don't want to talk about
the naughtiness,

835
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,110
right.
The bad stuff.

836
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,330
Yeah.
So I mean that's,

837
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,060
that's pretty naked imperialism,
right?

838
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:56,240
I mean that's what really clearly
attempting to remake the world in your

839
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:58,790
own end.
It's also super dangerous to deny

840
00:33:58,791 --> 00:33:59,624
history.
Sure.

841
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,190
It's done.
Because then people find out the truth

842
00:34:01,191 --> 00:34:04,210
and then they resent you and then become
upset and then you never trusted the

843
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,300
Taliban.
Yes,

844
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:06,470
exactly right.
Yes,

845
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:07,281
exactly.
So right.

846
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:09,550
It's also self defeating.
Yeah.

847
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,130
Ultimately probably.
But for a long time they'll have some

848
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:15,590
control and they'll kill a lot of people
in the process.

849
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,800
So we,
we started this whole rant out trying to

850
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:24,890
figure out where this all started from,
does it,

851
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,590
where this social justice movement on
campus,

852
00:34:27,591 --> 00:34:32,210
it's ridiculous exaggeration of
microaggressions and things along those

853
00:34:32,211 --> 00:34:34,580
lines.
How much of it has to do with social

854
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:36,800
media though?
Because it seems like social media,

855
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,430
if they support each other and then they
find like minded groups,

856
00:34:40,431 --> 00:34:43,670
they get confirmation bias.
They all join together and these little

857
00:34:43,671 --> 00:34:45,700
uh,
message boards and what have you and

858
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,730
little twitter hashtag groups and then
they feed off of each other and then

859
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:51,950
explain to each other various things.

860
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,880
Yes.
I would say that just makes it louder,

861
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,700
but it's always been around.
I mean the stuff I'm seeing on campus

862
00:34:56,701 --> 00:34:58,830
now is what I saw in the 1980s.
It's just,

863
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,900
it's the,
it's just that in the 1980s it could,

864
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:02,670
it didn't get off campus because there
was no twitter.

865
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:03,481
Oh,
okay.

866
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:07,770
So like this youtube video of the
students in Yale screaming at the dean,

867
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:12,510
um,
students at my college,

868
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:15,750
Antioch College in Ohio took a shit on
the desk of the president.

869
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:23,280
They broke into his office at night and
do wrong and we call them all kinds of

870
00:35:23,281 --> 00:35:23,881
stuff.
You know,

871
00:35:23,881 --> 00:35:26,760
we thought he was the great oppressor
cause there was no oppressor around.

872
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,190
So we had to create one and he was at
poor guy.

873
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,240
So this Occidental God that they're
trying to kick out the,

874
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,530
the,
the dean,

875
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,663
the president,
president,

876
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,580
what,
what do they,

877
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,100
what they want to replace him with

878
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,330
a trans black woman.
That's a great question.

879
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,730
Gender Queer.
And that has been raised a few times.

880
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:46,680
So who do you think you're going to get
to replace him?

881
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,470
Like who is there out there?
Who will be better for you?

882
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,580
Right.
No one,

883
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:53,460
they have at least a list of offenses
that he's committed.

884
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,110
Other than not having a black studies
class or program,

885
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,360
there's a list of demands.
You can go online and see them.

886
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:07,050
Those are demands.
They're not necessarily grievances.

887
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,270
It's,
it's unclear what the specific

888
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:10,380
grievances are.
Well,

889
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:12,400
and who gets to vote on these demands
too?

890
00:36:12,401 --> 00:36:14,730
I mean,
is it a small tiny shell group?

891
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,360
Well,
the faculty has power over curricular

892
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:22,950
issues and then administrative issues or
the president in his office as basically

893
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,630
okay.
Um,

894
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:29,490
it,
it's sort of embarrassing to talk about

895
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:32,100
this stuff because it's so ridiculous
and I am a part of it,

896
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,020
you know,
I feel embarrassed to be associated with

897
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:35,010
it,
you know.

898
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,320
Do you remember that moment when,
um,

899
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,840
there was the,
the pepper spray incident on,

900
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,591
uh,
well,

901
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:42,480
I forget what campus,
Uc Davis.

902
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:42,950
Thanks.
Well,

903
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:46,740
they pepper sprayed those kids that were
sitting there peacefully on their knees

904
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,550
and they were,
they were protesting the raising of

905
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:53,550
tuition and they wouldn't leave.
So these cops,

906
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,950
this cop pepper sprays him in the face
and then,

907
00:36:55,951 --> 00:36:57,720
uh,
after all the commotion settled,

908
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,510
was it the dean?
Who is that what it was the woman who

909
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:03,930
left and no one said a word as she
walked by.

910
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:08,931
It was totally eerily silent and that
was a powerful statement,

911
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:14,280
a real powerful statement.
Instead of screaming at her instead of

912
00:37:14,281 --> 00:37:15,870
like,
you called the police on this,

913
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:16,820
like,
look what's happened.

914
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:20,310
The pepper spray kids,
no one said a word and this woman walked

915
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:24,300
and she was being escorted to our car
and just dead silence.

916
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,270
So how do you interpret that?
It was just insanely powerful.

917
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,470
It was a,
there was a real,

918
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:30,240
it was like,
it was palpable.

919
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:32,460
You could see like first of all it was
shame.

920
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,450
The whole thing was like shameful.
Like what that cop did was shameful.

921
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:40,080
What the kids were doing was pro.
That's like a legit protest.

922
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,700
Like you're charging too much for
school,

923
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:43,620
you raising the rate that's a legit
protest.

924
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,180
And the fact that they were pepper
sprayed for doing that and by some

925
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:53,181
fucking asshole cop spraying chemicals
in the face of these kids and then this

926
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:59,931
woman leaving in total silence debt.
But that was a response to a real

927
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:02,670
situation.
Like some,

928
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:05,240
something real happen,
something real went down.

929
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,070
It was really like a cultural tragedy.
I mean,

930
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:09,390
he's,
microaggressions are real.

931
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,020
I mean,
I've,

932
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,520
I've seen these huge websites that sort
of document specific microaggressions

933
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:17,370
that have happened in all sorts of
campuses and I all sounds believable to

934
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:17,580
me.

935
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,840
I think it's all happened.
You know,

936
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,000
where are you from?
What are you,

937
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,430
what are you really that was going to be
dicky people?

938
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:25,290
Are you an athlete?
I think it's all true.

939
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,510
Um,
the question is how do you,

940
00:38:27,511 --> 00:38:29,840
how should you feel about that?
Right?

941
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,810
And my war,
John mcwhorter,

942
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:35,811
his argument is by you have a choice.
He has that you have a choice,

943
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,181
right?
You can,

944
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:40,120
you can choose to be damaged by that.
And I think these kids really do feel

945
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:45,121
damaged by it.
Or you can think this is a parochial

946
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,190
knucklehead who said this,
why should I care?

947
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,570
Right?
What does idiot thanks.

948
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:51,640
Right?
Which is a quarters attitude,

949
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:53,170
right?
When he was at rutgers or whatever it

950
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:53,891
was,
he was just like,

951
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:54,611
he's,
and he found,

952
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:58,960
he came across some actual racists who
said things to him and he thought they

953
00:38:58,961 --> 00:38:59,794
were inferior.

954
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,810
And he says,
that's why the what they should be

955
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:03,790
thinking now about people who say these
things,

956
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,230
you're an idiot.
Right?

957
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,000
Um,
they're,

958
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:11,110
they're making themselves damaged and
you're right.

959
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,870
This doesn't rise to the level of your
tuition.

960
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,910
Uh,
your scholarship being cut,

961
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,980
right?
Your financial aid being taken away.

962
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:21,880
It doesn't rise to the level of a cop
spraying you in the face with pepper

963
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,140
spray.
Right?

964
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:27,820
Those things are real grievances that
have to be dealt with.

965
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,870
I think an extreme ways.
Interesting that that was the response.

966
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:36,871
Like in a real situation,
everybody just just stayed quiet.

967
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,360
And this,
this eerie silence as this woman left,

968
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,970
right?
That was a real protest like that that

969
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:46,000
like rang out like you've watched that
video to this day and it's fucking

970
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:47,140
creepy.
Have you seen it?

971
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,750
Um,
I don't recall the woman walking way.

972
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:51,590
I've seen the video of the video pepper
spray.

973
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,010
Yeah,
the pepper spray videos.

974
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,020
Disturbing.
But this is really kind of powerful when

975
00:39:56,021 --> 00:39:59,620
the woman's leaving and she's being
escorted out.

976
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,330
No one says a fucking word.
I mean,

977
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:05,020
there's a thousand people out there and
no one says a word that can be

978
00:40:05,021 --> 00:40:05,854
effective,
I think.

979
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,870
I think it was,
that process was effective.

980
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:10,600
It was because there was a video that
went out on social media and everyone

981
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:11,434
saw it.
Right.

982
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,090
But I mean,
in the moment,

983
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:14,890
I think it was effective for everyone
who was there.

984
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:16,390
And I think leaving her,
I think,

985
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,480
I think fucking shit up as effective to
actually,

986
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,261
oh,
look at you.

987
00:40:20,261 --> 00:40:21,190
You anarchist.
Yeah.

988
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,430
There's no question about it.
Would you like to fuck things up?

989
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,200
Well,
I think if you look at the history of

990
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:29,620
riots in this country,
you see tremendous social progress

991
00:40:29,621 --> 00:40:31,950
immediately following them.
So you're pro riot.

992
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,180
What's that?
Uc Davis.

993
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,600
Um,
I am not pro riot.

994
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,700
I'm just,
uh,

995
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,170
but it sounds like it.
Well,

996
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:42,430
maybe I got to get in trouble.
I,

997
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:43,270
yeah,
I'm already in trouble.

998
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,170
I'm already in.
Hell No.

999
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:48,670
It's true though.
I mean if you look at sort of police

1000
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:49,504
brutality,
right?

1001
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,420
Most riots in this country have been in
response to police brutality.

1002
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,420
And you look at the cities in which
rights have happened since the 1930s you

1003
00:40:55,421 --> 00:40:57,580
will see a decline in police brutality
in those cities,

1004
00:40:57,581 --> 00:40:59,410
almost across the board.
Almost in every case,

1005
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:00,550
right?
Just in Baltimore.

1006
00:41:00,551 --> 00:41:02,800
Recently,
right after those riots,

1007
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:05,050
those cops were indicted.
Now they may get off,

1008
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,610
but they were indicted,
which is a rare thing for call.

1009
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,610
Let's put the headphones on so you could
hear this

1010
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:16,530
cause it's kind of crazy.
She's leaving and there's fucking

1011
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:25,270
thousands of people there and no one's
saying a word or,

1012
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,310
oh,
I do remember this.

1013
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,160
So creepy.
Just dead quiet.

1014
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,440
No one's talked to them.
They're protesting her.

1015
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:37,240
Yeah,
right.

1016
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,360
Yeah.
Well she was the one that called the

1017
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:39,194
cops,
right.

1018
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,810
On these,
these students and had them pepper

1019
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:45,500
sprayed in the face.
So she has this long walk of shame

1020
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:52,460
and people are taking photographs,
but no one's saying a word and it's

1021
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:56,410
really intense.
If you know the story behind us,

1022
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,410
even more intense,
I mean,

1023
00:41:57,411 --> 00:42:00,770
this sauce for quite a while and no one
says anything and did,

1024
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,680
did she resign or was she fired?
It's a good question.

1025
00:42:03,681 --> 00:42:04,820
I can't,
that would be,

1026
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,010
that's the question to,
to answer,

1027
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:07,701
right?
Yeah.

1028
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:08,940
I don't know.
I don't know.

1029
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,500
Um,
but this video got out and I'm sure this

1030
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:16,610
whole scenario was brutally stressful
and it had a cost,

1031
00:42:16,611 --> 00:42:19,700
some form of change.
Oh,

1032
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:20,780
it definitely did.
I mean,

1033
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,000
I don't know if she suffered,
but,

1034
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:27,350
but I know that Uc Davis Institute,
I think the cop was fired.

1035
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,340
Oh yeah.
It was,

1036
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,600
was threatened in that guy's life was
absolutely right.

1037
00:42:31,601 --> 00:42:35,510
And you can be sure that it's less
likely for a protester at that campus to

1038
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,890
get pepper sprayed,
source it for just sitting there.

1039
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,400
I mean,
that's disgusting.

1040
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:44,240
You're supposed to do stuff like that
when people are dangerous and violent

1041
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,300
and that's supposed to do stuff that the
kids are just sitting down.

1042
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:51,380
But in Los Angeles it is much safer even
though it's not safe,

1043
00:42:51,381 --> 00:42:53,750
but it's much safer for black people,
uh,

1044
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,580
in dealing with the cops now than it was
in the 1980s because of the 1992 riot.

1045
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,400
There's no doubt about that.
I mean the cops,

1046
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:04,700
the police,
lapd instituted wide ranging reforms and

1047
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:08,660
you can ask anyone who's lived in la in
the 80s and lives here now.

1048
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,470
It's a huge difference in the way that
the cops deal with black people in this,

1049
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,423
in this city now.

1050
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:17,480
And that was from one video,
the Rodney king video and then the trial

1051
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:20,000
in the subsequent acquittal of the
officers.

1052
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:24,590
And then from then what we're dealing
with is the new wave of these videos

1053
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,140
we're seeing over and over again.
All these videos,

1054
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:31,070
evidence of police brutality,
and that's probably having an effect on

1055
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:33,620
it as well.
People are much more aware of what they

1056
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:36,800
do and what they don't do.
There've been more indictments of cops

1057
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:41,801
this year or this last year then I think
ever because of black lives matter and

1058
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:43,220
social media,
there's no doubt about it.

1059
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,840
Right.
It's very effective.

1060
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:48,890
And you know,
you have Bernie Sanders and Hillary

1061
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,550
Clinton and Martin and molly talking
about police brutality constantly now.

1062
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:55,010
And that's clearly only because of black
lives matter.

1063
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,590
Bernie Sanders didn't want to talk about
it,

1064
00:43:56,591 --> 00:43:59,840
and until those kids got on the stage
with him in Seattle and shamed him and

1065
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:00,730
yelled at him,
right.

1066
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,230
And they were mocked for that too.
But they were very effective in doing

1067
00:44:03,231 --> 00:44:04,130
that.
And then,

1068
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:06,710
so the next day,
Bernie Sanders starts talking about

1069
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:09,980
police brutality and the criminal
justice system and Hillary Clinton,

1070
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,810
like a week or two later,
it starts doing it too.

1071
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:13,730
And ever since then,
they can't shut up about it.

1072
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:15,920
Uh,
so it's a very effective,

1073
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,980
disruptive protest.
They recognize that it's just up to a,

1074
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:21,680
a powerful talking point.
Well,

1075
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:24,560
they're forced to talk about it because
they've had these disruptive protests.

1076
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:25,683
Right.
Uh,

1077
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,160
so in that sense,
you're in favor of those kinds of

1078
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:32,730
protests when I'm,
when I'm in solidarity with the cause.

1079
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:33,391
Yeah.
I mean,

1080
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:34,710
it's,
it's a question of tactics.

1081
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:36,420
Like what does an effective tactic,
right.

1082
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:41,220
And there's just no doubt that
disruptive protests and in many cases,

1083
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:43,950
violent protests in the form of riots
has been very effective.

1084
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:49,610
Do you think that the future involves
these kinds of institutions?

1085
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,750
He's longstanding institutions like
Stanford and Harvard and Yale?

1086
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:59,100
Or do you think that the future is going
to be something where people get their

1087
00:44:59,101 --> 00:45:02,490
education online more likely than not?
Well,

1088
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,990
I think the future is the university.
I'm going to start next year.

1089
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,960
I'm a,
I'm going to Alam it only part time,

1090
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:12,900
but what I'm really doing this coming
year as launching a,

1091
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:16,830
what I'm calling a renegade university,
which will be an online education set,

1092
00:45:16,831 --> 00:45:19,110
of course,
his lectures and interactive seminars.

1093
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:22,620
For anyone who's interested in learning
about history and political philosophy,

1094
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:25,350
current events,
looking at things through in a new way

1095
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,090
and you offer degrees,
uh,

1096
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,520
not yet.
I think most people wouldn't be

1097
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:31,170
interested in that.
I think this is just for people who are

1098
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:32,880
just like,
you are just curious about the world,

1099
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:36,180
right?
There's a huge demand for this in the

1100
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:39,750
world and it's so expensive to colleges
now.

1101
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,850
Uh,
it's unaffordable for most people now or

1102
00:45:41,851 --> 00:45:44,010
many people now.
Um,

1103
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:47,100
and also you have to sort of enter this
loony bin as we know,

1104
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,360
to learn these things now.
So,

1105
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:50,480
I mean,
I think people are kind of bypassing

1106
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:53,820
colleges and universities more and more
through online education,

1107
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,940
through podcasting,
through all these other media forms.

1108
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,350
So that's what I'm going to do.
I'm going to offer sort of what I've

1109
00:46:01,351 --> 00:46:06,351
been teaching in my classes in colleges
for 20 years to anyone online for a tiny

1110
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:08,190
fraction of the cost.
Right.

1111
00:46:08,191 --> 00:46:08,971
There's,
you know,

1112
00:46:08,971 --> 00:46:13,971
it's much cheaper to do this then for
them then to pay tuition at a Yale or

1113
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:15,870
Occidental College.
Well,

1114
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:18,120
that sounds excellent.
And I think we're,

1115
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:21,600
we're in a unique time now where
something like that is very appealing to

1116
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:24,150
people because a lot of people are
getting,

1117
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,290
I mean,
at the end of the day,

1118
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,360
education is information,
right?

1119
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,141
That's what it is.
You're,

1120
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:29,400
you're learning things,
you're,

1121
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:32,370
you're taking in things and we're
educating ourselves constantly.

1122
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,880
You're constantly educating yourself
with articles and books and things,

1123
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:37,470
you,
documentaries that you watch.

1124
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:39,450
There's always information that's coming
in.

1125
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,130
It's just the idea is that to get an
education in air quotes,

1126
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:48,030
you have to go to a place and you have
to follow their rules and you have to

1127
00:46:48,031 --> 00:46:50,610
sit in the class with all these other
people that are trying to do the same

1128
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:52,740
and you have to somehow or another do it
together.

1129
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,260
Right.
Why that doesn't make sense to me

1130
00:46:55,261 --> 00:46:56,730
because you don't live your life like
that.

1131
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,361
You know,
your,

1132
00:46:57,361 --> 00:46:59,340
your life is,
doesn't involve like,

1133
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,870
you know,
you don't go to a place and learn about

1134
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:06,570
people.
You live and you learn about people.

1135
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,200
You know,
I,

1136
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:12,200
I think that it's very,
it's kind of confining and archaic to

1137
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,740
have these,
these institutions where you have to go

1138
00:47:16,741 --> 00:47:21,741
there and then the whole tenure process
and the politics of the staff and the

1139
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:27,900
teaching and what can and can't be in
the curriculum and who it does and

1140
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:29,070
doesn't offend or appeal.

1141
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,320
Yeah,
it's archaic.

1142
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:32,890
It's actually medieval.
I mean,

1143
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:36,700
the modern university is based on
colleges and universities in the mid,

1144
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:38,110
in the Middle Ages,
schools in the Middle Ages.

1145
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,370
What's the oldest running university
today in the United States?

1146
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:43,570
It's Harvard.
Uh,

1147
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,030
when was that established?
Um,

1148
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,710
s 17th century I believe.
Wow.

1149
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,080
I believe that's hilarious.
Yeah.

1150
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,190
Uh,
Columbia,

1151
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:55,330
the United States.
Yeah.

1152
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:56,500
Yeah.
Wow.

1153
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:57,790
What,
what the fuck was it here?

1154
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,580
1636,
right.

1155
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:03,940
Sane.
That is insane.

1156
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,980
Good Lord.
Yeah.

1157
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:11,480
It's based on schools in middle ages.
Right?

1158
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:13,230
Wow.
It's truly archaic.

1159
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,060
It's a bizarre place.
The modern college.

1160
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:17,200
Yeah.
It's a bizarre,

1161
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:18,910
bizarre place.
There's no other place like it.

1162
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:20,860
Some of that's good.
I mean,

1163
00:48:20,861 --> 00:48:22,930
it's a night.
It's nice to have this space where you

1164
00:48:22,931 --> 00:48:25,660
can talk about ideas.
The problem is that's happening less and

1165
00:48:25,661 --> 00:48:28,240
less in colleges.
Isn't it good though for a lot of people

1166
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:31,960
to get away from their parents,
go someplace to be around other young

1167
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:34,510
kids that are experiencing this sort of
new freedom for themselves.

1168
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:39,750
And then to be thrust into this is this
sort of pressure cooker of ideas.

1169
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,250
Yeah.
But do you have to go to college to get

1170
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:42,971
that?
Well,

1171
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:45,370
otherwise you're stuck with your parents
and then what are you gonna do?

1172
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:47,620
Are you going to get a job to pay your
rent this way?

1173
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:49,360
You're in a dorm?
You know,

1174
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:49,871
you're,
you're,

1175
00:48:49,871 --> 00:48:50,830
you know,
you show up,

1176
00:48:50,831 --> 00:48:53,230
Brian Bell rings go to class.
Well,

1177
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:55,480
like in the 1960s,
people just went to San Francisco

1178
00:48:55,481 --> 00:48:56,111
instead.
Right.

1179
00:48:56,111 --> 00:48:57,070
And they just hung out.
Oh,

1180
00:48:57,071 --> 00:48:58,120
that's true.
Yeah.

1181
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:02,340
So good to San Francisco folks.
Denver's the New San Francisco.

1182
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:02,921
Well,
I mean it,

1183
00:49:02,921 --> 00:49:03,970
yeah,
whatever it is.

1184
00:49:03,971 --> 00:49:05,050
I mean,
Not San Francisco now,

1185
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:07,630
obviously,
but someplace San Francisco now you'll

1186
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:10,780
be homeless.
If you make more than less than $200,000

1187
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:11,770
a year,
you're going to be homeless.

1188
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,490
That's not happening.
Joke either.

1189
00:49:14,491 --> 00:49:18,220
Now I know that place is fucking insane.
My parents just moved out of there.

1190
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:19,810
Um,
yeah,

1191
00:49:19,811 --> 00:49:23,260
so I mean it's making less and less
sense to people.

1192
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:28,030
So if you look at just economically,
you look at the price of a degree has

1193
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:33,031
gone up and up and up and the value of a
degree has gone down and down and down

1194
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:34,720
because everyone's got a college degree
now.

1195
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,280
It's like the new high school diploma,
right.

1196
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:40,140
As far as you returned to immediate,
able to get a job and doesn't.

1197
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:40,601
Right.
Uh,

1198
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:44,410
so employers are looking at degrees as
being less and less valuable.

1199
00:49:44,411 --> 00:49:47,020
So you know,
that's a clear bubble happening.

1200
00:49:47,021 --> 00:49:48,970
I mean that's a real problem
economically.

1201
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,180
Um,
and then maybe more importantly,

1202
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:54,550
there's all these other ways to learn
stuff now,

1203
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,110
right?
Mostly online,

1204
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,150
right?
That's cheap or free,

1205
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:03,310
either formal online courses or just
listening to podcasts or reading blogs

1206
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:04,810
or you know,
are going on twitter.

1207
00:50:04,811 --> 00:50:07,780
I've said there's more,
and I really mean this,

1208
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:12,010
there is more intellectual debate in one
hour of twitter.

1209
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,280
Then there was a four years of college.
I mean there's far more conflict of

1210
00:50:17,351 --> 00:50:22,000
ideas on social media now than there is
in a college classroom because college

1211
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:26,260
classrooms are dominated and have been
for decades by left liberals.

1212
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:27,980
That's discourse that goes on

1213
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,930
in there.
You don't hear conservative ideas,

1214
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:33,860
you don't hear libertarian ideas,
you don't even hear some radical left

1215
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:38,861
wing ideas.
It's this very narrow discourse that is

1216
00:50:38,871 --> 00:50:41,210
pretty much only allowed in the college
classroom.

1217
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:46,211
And that's to me the most,
the biggest problem with the modern

1218
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:49,130
university,
there is no diversity of ideas.

1219
00:50:49,131 --> 00:50:51,170
Everybody's obsessed with diversity of
color,

1220
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,580
skin color.
But no one cares about a diversity,

1221
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,800
diversity of ideas about real debate.
I want in my university to have a real

1222
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,620
debate about big ideas.
I want the best minds from conservatism

1223
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:11,330
and liberalism and socialism and
libertarianism to have it out too.

1224
00:51:11,331 --> 00:51:16,331
Let's talk about the big ideas and let's
go for it and have the best people argue

1225
00:51:16,491 --> 00:51:18,530
the points on their merits against each
other.

1226
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:24,300
Why is it that there's such a narrow
path of ideas that exists right now in

1227
00:51:27,011 --> 00:51:29,310
college?
It's why is it just as tenured tenure?

1228
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:30,200
Tenure?

1229
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,070
Yeah.
I mean,

1230
00:51:31,071 --> 00:51:35,900
so what happened was conservatives
basically dominated colleges until the

1231
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:40,901
1960s and then the 1960s generation of
radicals had nowhere to go when they

1232
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,790
went into their twenties and thirties so
they decided to move into the academy.

1233
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:50,300
So they all got phds and they became
professors and they've dominated ever

1234
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:54,050
since.
There's also this system of tenure and

1235
00:51:54,051 --> 00:51:56,180
universities,
which is supposed to protect academic

1236
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:59,000
freedom.
And what it actually does is it enforces

1237
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:01,100
intellectual conformity,
right?

1238
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,790
Because you have a lifetime appointment
and you die and you control hiring,

1239
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:07,040
right?
The faculty controls hiring.

1240
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:09,020
Who,
who are you going to hire?

1241
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:10,640
You're going to hire somebody who agrees
with you,

1242
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:13,360
who says what you think should be said.
Uh,

1243
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:16,370
so that's the problem with tenure,
right?

1244
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:21,050
It sort of protects academic freedom,
but mostly it enforces intellectual

1245
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:24,520
conformity.
That's disturbing.

1246
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,760
It's disturbing because you,
it's a priesthood.

1247
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:28,810
Yeah.
In a way,

1248
00:52:28,811 --> 00:52:29,270
right?
Yeah.

1249
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:29,890
Right.
You're,

1250
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:32,980
you're a priest for life.
And who are you going to recruit into

1251
00:52:32,981 --> 00:52:35,200
the priesthood.
A true believer.

1252
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:36,980
Okay.

1253
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,320
That's what goes on in universities with
faculty hiring.

1254
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,320
So if you have 10 year,
there's essentially no way you can get

1255
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:45,440
fired on this radical crime.
You have to rape a student or you have

1256
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:47,600
to be schizophrenia or,
yeah,

1257
00:52:47,601 --> 00:52:50,360
I mean it's almost impossible.
It seems kind of ridiculous as well

1258
00:52:50,361 --> 00:52:53,360
because like what if someone starts
putting out poor work?

1259
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,400
Like A,
here's perfect example.

1260
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:58,040
A guy who has tenure,
who is at the University of California

1261
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,020
Berkeley.
I'm that guy,

1262
00:53:00,021 --> 00:53:00,920
um,
who,

1263
00:53:00,921 --> 00:53:03,740
uh,
believes that a Duesberg Peter Duesberg,

1264
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:05,630
he,
I've had him on the podcast before and

1265
00:53:05,631 --> 00:53:08,360
it was probably the most hate I ever got
from,

1266
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,720
but he's,
he's got this radical idea that aids is

1267
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,030
not a,
um,

1268
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,090
it's not a disease.
It's caused by HIV and that HIV is a

1269
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:19,400
weak virus and HIV,
uh,

1270
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,980
exist in these people because they
already have a compromised immune

1271
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:24,980
system.
And that what's really going on is they

1272
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:25,950
have,
um,

1273
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,050
they,
they're taking recreational drugs and

1274
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:31,740
partying and depleting their immune
system to the point where HIV can

1275
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:34,440
actually show up.
And that HIV is not the cause of aids,

1276
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:38,190
but it's just the symptom of a depleted
immune system.

1277
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:42,000
But he's a fucking professor of biology
at the University of California,

1278
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:45,600
Berkeley,
and he's widely hated by AIDS

1279
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:48,960
researchers,
like people who understand HIV at a

1280
00:53:48,961 --> 00:53:52,260
deeper level and they think he's a
fucking moron and what he's doing is

1281
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:53,580
dangerous.
But meanwhile,

1282
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:54,414
he has tenure.
Right?

1283
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:56,290
So let them have it out.
I mean,

1284
00:53:56,291 --> 00:53:58,390
he's,
he's reviled by the profession.

1285
00:53:58,391 --> 00:53:59,800
So what's the problem here?
Right?

1286
00:53:59,801 --> 00:54:03,010
I mean,
let him have it out with his opponents.

1287
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,800
Let them,
let them argue this.

1288
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:06,070
And they won't even argue with them.
No,

1289
00:54:06,071 --> 00:54:08,110
because it's like arguing with a
Holocaust denier.

1290
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:12,040
It's like if you,
if you get on a day with a Holocaust

1291
00:54:12,041 --> 00:54:14,320
denier and you start debating,
I'm like,

1292
00:54:14,321 --> 00:54:17,230
you're,
you're giving him merit by just being

1293
00:54:17,231 --> 00:54:19,420
there.
And I think the market should decide.

1294
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:20,710
It doesn't decide.
Right.

1295
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,510
Meaning the students should decide.
Right.

1296
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,180
Broadly speaking,
the students,

1297
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:26,800
let's do the broad student body.
People who might go to college,

1298
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:28,570
who might take his class should decide.
Right.

1299
00:54:28,571 --> 00:54:30,520
They don't get to decide though because
he has tenure.

1300
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:33,670
That's the problem.
He removes it from market forces.

1301
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,601
Right,
right,

1302
00:54:34,601 --> 00:54:36,040
right.
Whereas if the students decided,

1303
00:54:36,041 --> 00:54:37,420
but,
but you know,

1304
00:54:37,421 --> 00:54:41,620
the students are trying to get rid of
the president of Occidental for no

1305
00:54:41,621 --> 00:54:42,730
fucking reason at all.

1306
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,800
The market often does things we don't
like,

1307
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:48,070
but the market should be able to do that
as well.

1308
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:49,870
Sure.
Yeah.

1309
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:51,880
So they'll be able to kick out of what
the market is.

1310
00:54:51,881 --> 00:54:53,080
The market learns.
Right.

1311
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,730
So at Occidental,
they would kick out,

1312
00:54:54,731 --> 00:54:57,010
if they were had their way,
they would kick out the president and he

1313
00:54:57,011 --> 00:55:01,390
would be replaced by someone who is just
as bad or some or worse,

1314
00:55:01,391 --> 00:55:05,020
someone like them or slightly better.
Or if someone that maybe they would look

1315
00:55:05,021 --> 00:55:06,430
out and they would find someone just
like them.

1316
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:10,180
But that seems impossible because the
president of a college has to keep the

1317
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,590
place afloat.
Right?

1318
00:55:12,790 --> 00:55:14,410
Right.
Yeah.

1319
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:17,680
So they have fiscal responsibilities.
They have taken in consideration fiscal

1320
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:18,940
responsibilities.
Exactly.

1321
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,920
What,
why was 10 you're created in the first

1322
00:55:20,921 --> 00:55:21,754
place.
What was the idea?

1323
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:23,650
Protect academic freedom.
Right.

1324
00:55:23,651 --> 00:55:26,170
To allow us to say what we want in the
classroom.

1325
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,020
Free from fear of being fired by the
administration.

1326
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,420
And when was,
when was it an institute?

1327
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:32,770
It's,
it's,

1328
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,230
it's ancient.
That's system,

1329
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:40,000
but it wasn't really fucked until the
sixties that's when,

1330
00:55:40,001 --> 00:55:40,900
you know,
it's always been fucked.

1331
00:55:40,901 --> 00:55:41,460
It's always been,
yeah.

1332
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,610
I mean,
so you know,

1333
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:47,640
in the 1920s and thirties and forties
and 50s the schools were dominated by,

1334
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:49,650
it's kind of,
you know,

1335
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:52,150
straight white male elites,
right.

1336
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,380
Wealthy people.
Right.

1337
00:55:53,381 --> 00:55:55,120
And they had a very narrow discourse.
Two,

1338
00:55:55,121 --> 00:55:57,010
it was just a very different one than
we're taught now.

1339
00:55:57,070 --> 00:55:59,170
Right.
But they were protected from market

1340
00:55:59,171 --> 00:56:00,550
forces as well.
Right.

1341
00:56:00,551 --> 00:56:02,980
And there was no intellectual diversity
there either.

1342
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,360
Right.
It was just as bad.

1343
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,580
It's just a different,
it was just a different discourse.

1344
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,900
So the problem is tenure,
the,

1345
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:11,260
the heart of it,
you know,

1346
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,330
um,
it also,

1347
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:17,110
you know,
there's just this huge generation,

1348
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:21,640
which I belong to have scholars with
phds who are very good teachers and very

1349
00:56:21,641 --> 00:56:24,250
good scholars who can't get jobs.
There's this tremendous

1350
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:26,620
overproduction of phds in the last 50
years,

1351
00:56:26,621 --> 00:56:27,850
right?
Not Enough.

1352
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,330
And not a lot of jobs.
We have to have more churn.

1353
00:56:31,331 --> 00:56:33,430
We have to have more turnover.
We have to have people.

1354
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,490
There's all these people who are much
better than tenured professors out there

1355
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:40,300
who can't teach and can't have solid,
secure jobs.

1356
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:44,170
We have to eliminate tenure to make
these places better.

1357
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:49,180
So because of 10 year,
you're getting people that establish

1358
00:56:49,181 --> 00:56:51,190
that position.
Then like here's a perfect example.

1359
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,680
There was a,
one of the people that was talking about

1360
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:56,290
the woman in Missouri that,
Oh,

1361
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:59,530
was calling for muscle and Melissa
Click,

1362
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:00,960
yeah,
this is their name.

1363
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:05,200
W W it was this insane video.
She's telling some young man he couldn't

1364
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:07,460
be there in a public place taking
photographs.

1365
00:57:07,461 --> 00:57:08,650
And he's like,
actually I can,

1366
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:12,100
and she,
she calls for muscle to get this guy

1367
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:12,850
kicked out of there.

1368
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,190
It's just like insane.
Well,

1369
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:18,410
one of the criticisms was by this guy
who is a,

1370
00:57:18,411 --> 00:57:21,520
a,
a professor and he said that her mistake

1371
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,560
was that she did this before she got
tenure.

1372
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,170
We wait until you get tenure and then
you shake things up.

1373
00:57:26,171 --> 00:57:27,004
Like,
no,

1374
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:27,941
no,
no.

1375
00:57:27,941 --> 00:57:32,470
Her mistake was saying,
can I get some muscle to take us to not

1376
00:57:32,471 --> 00:57:33,670
only that,
the woman,

1377
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,680
same woman,
uh,

1378
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:38,290
just a day before was calling for the
media to cover this event.

1379
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:40,570
And she's,
and she's a professor of communications.

1380
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,150
Yes.
Which is the whole thing is the whole

1381
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:44,460
thing is just insane.
Right?

1382
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:48,850
But it's this detachment from objective
reasoning,

1383
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,880
this complete detachment and this,
this insistence on staying within this,

1384
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:59,940
this idea that they're enforcing of safe
spaces have a intolerance to anyone with

1385
00:58:01,661 --> 00:58:02,494
a,
uh,

1386
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:05,230
uh,
opinions other than what they're trying

1387
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:09,040
to conform and what they're trying to
enforce on these kids.

1388
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:11,590
I mean,
I would imagine that Melissa Click

1389
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:16,620
believed that those students protesting
and the tents on that quad were being

1390
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:20,110
harmed,
had been harmed and were being harmed,

1391
00:58:20,111 --> 00:58:25,111
were actively being oprah test by racism
on that campus and they needed to be

1392
00:58:25,121 --> 00:58:27,460
protected from that harm.
Now,

1393
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,070
what actually happened on the University
of Missouri campus,

1394
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:34,000
allegedly two people use the word nigger
in a six month period.

1395
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,060
That's it.
And that's not,

1396
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:38,620
it hasn't even been proven,
by the way.

1397
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:43,270
Are these two people that did it well,
who no one knows.

1398
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,410
Oh,
it's just like it's in the air to two

1399
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:49,150
students claimed to know,
two students claimed that they were

1400
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,440
called nigger.
God.

1401
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:51,670
That's it.
Yeah.

1402
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:55,150
With no,
no descriptions of,

1403
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:57,880
you know,
and this could have happened,

1404
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,130
it should have happened,
but no one else could have happened.

1405
00:59:00,131 --> 00:59:01,270
This is a part of the problem.

1406
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:04,120
Kids make shit up.
Always have,

1407
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:06,850
especially to enforce that victim
mentality.

1408
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,940
Right.
So we reward victims.

1409
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,580
Yeah.
Well that's the cultural problem.

1410
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,560
There's a recreational victim mentality
that's going on where people are looking

1411
00:59:17,561 --> 00:59:20,980
for reasons why they were victims.
And uh,

1412
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,340
in,
in that situation,

1413
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:27,260
you've got a hunger strike or two people
using that word over six months.

1414
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,330
Yeah.
And there's a hunger strike.

1415
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,610
It's a demand to be treated like a
child.

1416
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:34,370
Yeah.
It's a demand for more paternalism.

1417
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:35,990
Right.
Protect me.

1418
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:41,020
I'm a victim or you know,
cleanse this area of all it's impure

1419
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,060
thoughts and reasoning.
Right.

1420
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,460
And make it into like a playpen.
Well,

1421
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,380
making it into a safe space.
Yeah.

1422
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,070
Well I play then they play pens.
They Brown.

1423
00:59:51,071 --> 00:59:52,300
That's a bouncy house.
Yeah.

1424
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:54,710
We'll at Brown.
You know about the safe spaces of Brown,

1425
00:59:54,711 --> 00:59:55,580
right.
University.

1426
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:56,870
What have they done?
Oh,

1427
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,360
um,
Christina Hoff summers talked about it

1428
00:59:59,361 --> 00:59:59,890
on,
yeah.

1429
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:00,441
Yeah.
But I mean,

1430
01:00:00,441 --> 01:00:01,580
for everybody,
I'm sorry.

1431
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:04,310
Yeah.
They created a safe space that had like

1432
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:07,130
coloring books for students to go to
because of video.

1433
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,920
If the idea is they heard were too
troubling for them.

1434
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,050
Videos of puppies and videos of puppies,
I guess.

1435
01:00:12,051 --> 01:00:14,060
Yeah.
So she said these are allegations,

1436
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:14,810
who knows?
But yeah,

1437
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:16,760
I believe it to some extent.
Yeah.

1438
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:21,200
And that was because of a woman who's a
feminist coming on to talk about the

1439
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:26,201
problems with using incorrect data and
biased studies to reinforce ideas that

1440
01:00:28,131 --> 01:00:30,530
may or may not be true,
which she believes damage actual

1441
01:00:30,531 --> 01:00:31,520
feminism.
All right,

1442
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:35,390
so before we continue to trash the
students too much,

1443
01:00:35,391 --> 01:00:38,690
I have to say this all this is true.
Everything we've said is completely true

1444
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:41,750
and I agree with you on all of it.
However,

1445
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:45,170
I've been teaching for 20 years for
different colleges,

1446
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:47,030
elite schools,
both coasts.

1447
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:50,930
This is a minority of college.
Students were talking about,

1448
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,660
this is not most of them.
It's a vocal minors is not most of them.

1449
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,630
In fact,
it's a fairly small minority.

1450
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:58,100
Um,
most of my students,

1451
01:00:58,101 --> 01:01:00,230
as far as I know,
have not been like this at all.

1452
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,450
In fact,
most of them are pretty disdainful of

1453
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:04,790
this kind of stuff and just want to
learn.

1454
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,730
Well,
I think a lot of kids today also because

1455
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:10,280
of social media,
because they get to watch videos of all

1456
01:01:10,281 --> 01:01:13,880
this nonsense going on at Yale and all
this craziness going on in Missouri,

1457
01:01:13,881 --> 01:01:16,850
and they,
they get to read blogs about it and they

1458
01:01:16,851 --> 01:01:21,170
get to participate in conversations on
social media.

1459
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:24,140
They're understanding how stupid at all
is there understanding that you're

1460
01:01:24,141 --> 01:01:28,340
dealing with a bunch of fucking babies.
And so there's probably some pushback in

1461
01:01:28,341 --> 01:01:30,230
that regard.
So what's been,

1462
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,870
I keep saying the most troubling thing
to me,

1463
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:38,240
one of the most troubling things to me
is that the faculty have been mostly

1464
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:39,440
silent about this.

1465
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:42,350
And it seems worse than that if the
faculty's trying to,

1466
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:45,080
well,
some or some sort of mechanism summer,

1467
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:48,650
some of them are egging them on,
but most I would say,

1468
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,340
just aren't saying anything.
And I'm talking about tenured senior

1469
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:55,370
faculty with lifetime job security or
not saying anything.

1470
01:01:55,371 --> 01:01:58,790
And I know many of them have
reservations about what's going on,

1471
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:01,610
but they won't talk about it.
It's really infuriating.

1472
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,420
Um,
and I can't quite explain it except that

1473
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:08,930
they're just cowards,
but it's a terrible thing,

1474
01:02:08,931 --> 01:02:09,261
right?
I mean,

1475
01:02:09,261 --> 01:02:12,470
because the idea is these kids are
espousing,

1476
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,360
they've gotten from the classrooms,
right?

1477
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:16,640
They've gotten from these faculty,
well,

1478
01:02:16,641 --> 01:02:20,160
don't you want to take back your ideas
or try to teach these kids?

1479
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,350
Isn't that what we're here for?
Yeah.

1480
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:23,790
Right.
Yeah.

1481
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:26,880
Discourse can be violent,
but that doesn't mean we should

1482
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,670
eliminate free speech because of it.
Right.

1483
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,860
Of course,
that intervention is not being made by

1484
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:34,140
faculty though.
I'm not hearing that being said,

1485
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:35,850
not publicly,
not on campuses,

1486
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,750
but that's where it gets confusing
because if the faculty does have tenure,

1487
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,700
wouldn't they want to express
themselves?

1488
01:02:41,701 --> 01:02:43,410
Like you don't have to worry about
getting fired.

1489
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:46,590
Like don't you see the problems with
this kind of thinking in this kind of

1490
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:51,830
enforcing this very rigid idea of what
you can and can't say or who you are and

1491
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:56,070
how you behave.
But the worst thing that can happen to a

1492
01:02:56,071 --> 01:02:59,400
white liberal,
and I know this is to be called a

1493
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:02,070
racist.
That's the worst thing that can happen

1494
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:03,410
to you.
Hmm.

1495
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,700
Maybe worse than losing your job.
Really.

1496
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:06,210
Yeah.

1497
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:08,370
Being called a racist and having people
believe it.

1498
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,020
And that's,
that's a terrifying prospect for a white

1499
01:03:13,021 --> 01:03:15,090
liberal.
Terrifying.

1500
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:20,480
So they'll do anything to avoid that
being called a sexist wouldn't be so hot

1501
01:03:21,211 --> 01:03:22,790
either.
But being called a racist is,

1502
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:25,280
it's worse than being a sexy,
so wow.

1503
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:28,170
Yeah.
Where's like trends phobic fall on that

1504
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,820
list that's catching up.
Yeah.

1505
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,860
That's moving up the list pretty fast.
It transphobic was weird because there's

1506
01:03:34,861 --> 01:03:37,030
so few transgender people,
like the,

1507
01:03:37,031 --> 01:03:39,150
the percentage of people that are
transgender.

1508
01:03:39,151 --> 01:03:43,140
It's amazing that that has caught so
much steam publicly because it's not

1509
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:47,580
like you're responding to like a,
a real issue that's happening.

1510
01:03:47,581 --> 01:03:49,140
It's almost like,
uh,

1511
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:50,000
like,
like a,

1512
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:52,440
a pet thing to,
uh,

1513
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,250
to reinforce the Trans Movement is,
is interesting.

1514
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:57,120
So,
you know,

1515
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:02,010
the Trans Movement started basically
after stonewall 1969,

1516
01:04:02,011 --> 01:04:04,200
1970s as part of the Gay Liberation
Movement.

1517
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:10,310
And the thrust of that was leave us
alone and we don't care what you think

1518
01:04:10,801 --> 01:04:11,634
about us.

1519
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:13,740
We're going to do whatever we want to
do.

1520
01:04:13,741 --> 01:04:15,390
We're going to dress as women are
dressed as men.

1521
01:04:15,391 --> 01:04:16,590
We're going to behave it however we
want.

1522
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:18,360
We don't care what you think about us.
Right?

1523
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:21,540
That's a very liberatory movement.
I'm a,

1524
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,130
I'm a big fan of that,
right?

1525
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,900
They're my heroes.
That generation,

1526
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:27,390
and by the way route Paul is kind of a
descendant of them.

1527
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,860
This is what he keeps saying over and
over again.

1528
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:30,630
I don't care if you call me a she or a
he.

1529
01:04:30,631 --> 01:04:31,800
I don't care.
He says,

1530
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:34,890
I'm going to do whatever I want to do.
Are you allowed to say he or is it she

1531
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:36,870
ru Paul says he doesn't care.
He says he,

1532
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,850
he says he doesn't hit her.
He says,

1533
01:04:38,851 --> 01:04:40,260
you can call me.
Either he or she.

1534
01:04:40,261 --> 01:04:41,670
So you can't miss gender him.
Nope.

1535
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,340
Good for him.
He's free her.

1536
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,590
Exactly right.G ,
G.

1537
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:48,423
G.
Zay.

1538
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,480
So now what you see a lot,
but not entirely,

1539
01:04:51,481 --> 01:04:54,120
but a lot among trans people is,
you know,

1540
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:57,840
they're really concerned about what you
and I think about them.

1541
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:02,100
That seems to be their,
their primary concern is what we think

1542
01:05:02,101 --> 01:05:03,090
about them.
Again,

1543
01:05:03,091 --> 01:05:05,550
it's like it's asking for more
paternalism.

1544
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,280
It's giving us more power.
Well,

1545
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:13,281
asking people too,
when you meet someone immediately ask,

1546
01:05:13,831 --> 01:05:18,280
what are your preferred gender pronouns?
Have you seen Steven crowder

1547
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,170
did a video?
We applied that in real life.

1548
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:22,030
No,
it's fucking hilarious.

1549
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,700
He went out,
the guys,

1550
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:29,260
he something,
he went out all over the place and uh,

1551
01:05:29,261 --> 01:05:32,680
was asking people what their preferred
gender Pronoun would be.

1552
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,770
The look that people gave him like in
the real world,

1553
01:05:35,771 --> 01:05:37,120
like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

1554
01:05:37,121 --> 01:05:40,000
Like over and over and over again.
He's asking these people what their

1555
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:43,200
preferred gender Pronoun would be.
How should I refer it to you?

1556
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:44,680
You know,
it just,

1557
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,300
wouldn't it be better if we just didn't
care?

1558
01:05:46,870 --> 01:05:49,090
Yeah.
I mean I don't,

1559
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:54,360
I think this idea that a man has a woman
inside of them and he really is a man or

1560
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:00,190
a woman trapped in a man's body or a man
trapped in a woman's body and you would

1561
01:06:00,191 --> 01:06:02,800
like to transfer,
you know like this idea that now it's a

1562
01:06:02,801 --> 01:06:03,880
she or now it's a he.

1563
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:08,170
I really think that you should be able
to do whatever you want to do and I

1564
01:06:08,171 --> 01:06:11,110
think that even if you're not a woman
trapped in a man's body,

1565
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:14,800
but if you wake up one day and go,
I think it'd be cool to just get an

1566
01:06:14,801 --> 01:06:18,400
operation and become a woman and started
taking female hormones and see if I like

1567
01:06:18,401 --> 01:06:19,960
it.
You should totally be able to do that.

1568
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:25,140
I'm 100% for that.
The real problem becomes when you make

1569
01:06:26,021 --> 01:06:30,040
whatever choices your doing,
you make it a big deal to everyone else

1570
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:34,470
and you start making it so that people
have like very specific ways you're

1571
01:06:34,471 --> 01:06:37,960
supposed to address you and talk to you.
You change your name to Caitlyn.

1572
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:41,440
Now you're kate,
you were bruce for 60 fucking years.

1573
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:43,690
But now I have to make a new noise with
my face.

1574
01:06:43,691 --> 01:06:46,210
That means you,
and if I don't make that new noise in my

1575
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:49,090
face,
I'm an asshole and I'm mis-gendering and

1576
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:50,500
I'm insensitive and rude.

1577
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:53,050
Well,
there is a slight possibility you might

1578
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:54,940
be fucking crazy.
And uh,

1579
01:06:54,941 --> 01:06:58,450
if you decide that you're a Fox,
do I call you a Fox skin?

1580
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,830
Like what?
What do I do now?

1581
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:00,990
What if,
what if you do?

1582
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:03,550
I mean,
people don't like those comparisons.

1583
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,410
They don't like to,
but those are valid.

1584
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:06,251
Like you,
you,

1585
01:07:06,251 --> 01:07:10,960
you're doing something,
you're having surgery and hormones to

1586
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:14,650
become normal.
That alone should make you go,

1587
01:07:14,651 --> 01:07:16,300
okay,
what are we dealing with here?

1588
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:18,280
What exactly are we allowed to discuss
this?

1589
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:20,290
We are not.
And that's where things get tricky.

1590
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:25,240
You're not allowed to discuss this and
you have to stay within a very rigid set

1591
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,640
of rules and,
and,

1592
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,150
and,
and what behaviors,

1593
01:07:28,151 --> 01:07:29,710
you don't want to call them crazy though
to you.

1594
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:31,600
Some of them are crazy.
How do you know that?

1595
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:34,030
Well,
I think some people are crazy.

1596
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:37,540
I would assume that there's a certain
amount of people in this world,

1597
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:41,380
whether it is 1% or one 10th of 1% that
are crazy.

1598
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:46,360
Now a certain amount of men who are
cisgendered heterosexual men are fucking

1599
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:49,090
crazy.
A certain amount of CIS gendered

1600
01:07:49,091 --> 01:07:52,480
heterosexual women are fucking crazy.
You got to define crazy,

1601
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:55,120
insane,
ridiculous,

1602
01:07:55,121 --> 01:07:58,120
preposterous.
That's been said about people who get

1603
01:07:58,121 --> 01:07:59,470
punched in the face for a living.
Sure.

1604
01:07:59,471 --> 01:08:01,480
A lot of crazy.
It's true though,

1605
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,200
but it's true.
So my point being like when you decide

1606
01:08:05,201 --> 01:08:06,670
what's normal,
what's not normal,

1607
01:08:06,671 --> 01:08:09,400
what we have to accept and not accept
and what we're allowed to comment on.

1608
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,500
That's when things get weird.
Like when you're,

1609
01:08:11,501 --> 01:08:14,500
when you're not allowed to comment on
certain things because you become

1610
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:15,980
insensitive,
but you're putting

1611
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,790
out this thing in the public,
you're making it this big social issue.

1612
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:22,070
Right.
And you only have one way.

1613
01:08:22,071 --> 01:08:23,840
You're allowed to communicate and look
at it.

1614
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:24,411
Yeah.
I mean,

1615
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:26,020
I would,
I really dislike is the,

1616
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,470
as I said,
the concern for what I think about it.

1617
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,140
Right.
Rather than you should,

1618
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,650
you should really be free of that.
You should be free of me.

1619
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:36,260
Yeah,
but that seemed to be con entirely

1620
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:38,270
concerned with what I think and what I
say.

1621
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,830
Yes.
Again,

1622
01:08:39,831 --> 01:08:43,940
this is a repudiation of the 1960s and
Seventies Gay Liberation Movement and

1623
01:08:43,941 --> 01:08:45,680
the Trans Liberation Movement of that
time,

1624
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:47,990
that the whole point of that movement
was,

1625
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:51,800
we don't care what you think about us.
We're going to fucking the streets.

1626
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,840
We're going to be naked,
we're going to dress however we want.

1627
01:08:53,841 --> 01:08:57,140
We're going to act however we want.
We don't care.

1628
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:58,970
That was true freedom.
Now it's,

1629
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:03,620
it's about wanting to be treated
properly by parents,

1630
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:05,780
by making us into their parents.

1631
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:08,480
Well,
it's also sort of reinforcing this new

1632
01:09:08,481 --> 01:09:13,481
society standards of acceptance,
which I'm 100% in favor of the idea

1633
01:09:13,641 --> 01:09:14,600
that,
you know,

1634
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:19,270
it is okay if your dad just decided to
become a woman at 60 years old and

1635
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,350
starts wearing dresses.
If it makes him feel better,

1636
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,010
which I'm 100% for,
right?

1637
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:25,160
But why shouldn't,
I mean I'm,

1638
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:29,900
I'm a big believer in choice.
I'm a big believer what's all being

1639
01:09:29,901 --> 01:09:32,420
different and I wouldn't be in the
business of calling people crazy.

1640
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:35,180
Well that's because you're a professor.
You're not a comedian.

1641
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:37,790
I'm,
I'm in the business of calling people

1642
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:38,990
crazy,
but I think they're crazy.

1643
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:41,500
Well,
it just doesn't mean a lot crazy.

1644
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,540
Doesn't mean a lot.
And it doesn't my world because it's so

1645
01:09:44,541 --> 01:09:45,351
arbitrary.
Right?

1646
01:09:45,351 --> 01:09:47,090
Yeah.
It's been applied to certainly everyone.

1647
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,160
I certainly,
I'm sure you've been called crazy.

1648
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:50,060
I've been called crazy.

1649
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:51,880
Everyone's been crazily crazy.
Yeah.

1650
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:54,890
Well it depends on your standard.
Yeah.

1651
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,530
But,
but so you really want to allow people

1652
01:09:57,531 --> 01:10:00,380
to do whatever they want.
Certainly then don't call them crazy.

1653
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,520
Why does that have any effect on whether
or not they do whatever I want?

1654
01:10:04,610 --> 01:10:07,730
Not saying it's stopping some of my
favorite people doing whatever they want

1655
01:10:07,731 --> 01:10:10,070
or fucking public that you want to
encourage people to do whatever they

1656
01:10:10,071 --> 01:10:11,690
want.
Um,

1657
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:14,900
I do,
but I don't think that calling someone

1658
01:10:14,901 --> 01:10:18,050
crazy for crazy behavior stops that.
And if it does,

1659
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:22,260
then maybe you're not free enough.
Yeah.

1660
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:22,821
I,
again,

1661
01:10:22,821 --> 01:10:24,320
they should not care too much about
what,

1662
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:29,860
that's my main point here,
but if you're really in favor of making

1663
01:10:30,501 --> 01:10:33,110
people feel free to make whatever
choices they want,

1664
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,770
then using terms like insane and crazy
is not helpful.

1665
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:38,450
Well,
I could see that point,

1666
01:10:38,451 --> 01:10:42,140
but also there's,
there's a very real possibility that

1667
01:10:42,141 --> 01:10:44,450
people with all sorts of dysmorphia
issues,

1668
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:48,260
whether it is a Anorexia,
whether it's bodybuilder dysmorphia,

1669
01:10:48,261 --> 01:10:51,680
where they never can be big enough that
all of these are,

1670
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:55,370
these are conditions that are
psychological,

1671
01:10:55,371 --> 01:10:58,250
mental conditions that you could say
this person's crazy.

1672
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:01,910
Like when you see a bodybuilder and they
can't stop getting bigger because

1673
01:11:01,911 --> 01:11:03,620
they're out of their mind,
they look at themselves in the mirror

1674
01:11:03,621 --> 01:11:06,980
and they think they're tiny and so that
there are 350 fucking pounds and they're

1675
01:11:06,981 --> 01:11:09,680
doing steroids and lifting weights 24
hours a day.

1676
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:11,750
You can say,
that guy's crazy,

1677
01:11:11,751 --> 01:11:12,590
right?
No,

1678
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:14,033
what

1679
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:15,253
you can,
okay,

1680
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:19,800
you're in this weird pc area now that
you have kind of accepted because you go

1681
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:23,190
to school and you teach and you're a
part of it now,

1682
01:11:23,191 --> 01:11:27,990
but that's a crazy person we're doing.
We're talking about a man who's a

1683
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:31,590
bodybuilder who lifts so much weight so
that his body is like virtually

1684
01:11:31,591 --> 01:11:35,400
exploding and they,
they have a dysmorphia where they cover

1685
01:11:35,401 --> 01:11:36,960
themselves up because they always look
tiny.

1686
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,360
You don't think that there's a
psychological condition there?

1687
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,970
There's a psychological condition.
Doesn't that make you crazy?

1688
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,400
Um,
what,

1689
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:45,620
what does crazy mean?
I don't,

1690
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,500
I mean,
ah,

1691
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,450
we're good.
And again,

1692
01:11:47,451 --> 01:11:50,160
Mantis here doing Jujitsu is called
crazy.

1693
01:11:50,161 --> 01:11:52,290
You know,
I mean it's being a professor has been

1694
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:53,790
called crazy.
Sure.

1695
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:55,770
So why,
why do you have issue with the word

1696
01:11:55,771 --> 01:11:59,730
crazy then?
Because you're pathologizing people's

1697
01:11:59,731 --> 01:12:02,370
choices.
You're saying I'm pathologizing people's

1698
01:12:02,371 --> 01:12:02,730
choices.

1699
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:04,950
If they lift weights until their body
explodes.

1700
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:06,600
I knew a dude who,
uh,

1701
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:07,940
who literally did that.
He,

1702
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:12,510
he was a bodybuilder and he died,
I think he was like 31 or 32.

1703
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:17,660
We used to call them garden hoses cause
his arms had veins that were like garden

1704
01:12:18,061 --> 01:12:19,470
hoses.
There were these giant,

1705
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:20,610
I mean,
it was insane.

1706
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:23,010
You looked at them,
you'd never seen a human being like him.

1707
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,720
He would lift weights.
He was a white guy.

1708
01:12:24,721 --> 01:12:27,000
Like is,
why did you he would turn fucking

1709
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:28,530
purple.
I mean purple.

1710
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,620
He was just 80% steroids.
His body was just overrun.

1711
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:35,220
He was out of his mind.
He was definitely crazy.

1712
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,590
Would you call that guy crazy?
No.

1713
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:40,980
He lifted weights until he died.
You don't think that's crazy.

1714
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:43,110
What about martial artists do not use
crazy at all?

1715
01:12:43,111 --> 01:12:44,240
Is that what's going on on a martial
artist?

1716
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,320
He was crazy.
Do you use the term crazy?

1717
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:48,240
I try not to.
What's a school shooter?

1718
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,790
Is that a crazy person?
It's someone I want to avoid.

1719
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:52,320
Not Crazy.
Huh?

1720
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,560
Do you limit speech and your own mind?
Are you limiting your own speech?

1721
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,830
Censoring myself all the time.
A little bit with what?

1722
01:12:58,831 --> 01:13:00,810
The word crazy.
You have a problem with the word crazy.

1723
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:02,690
Do why?
I do I?

1724
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:05,220
As I said,
I think it pathologizes people's

1725
01:13:05,221 --> 01:13:08,670
choices.
I think it contributes to a limitation

1726
01:13:08,671 --> 01:13:11,940
of freedom.
Crazy contributes a limitation for you

1727
01:13:11,941 --> 01:13:16,200
and it's been used against all sorts of
behaviors that you would absolutely

1728
01:13:16,201 --> 01:13:18,540
consider to be normal now.
Right.

1729
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:20,310
But I don't,
it doesn't affect me.

1730
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:23,170
Not only that you consider normal,
but that you considered to be a

1731
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:25,260
preferable,
like what behaviors?

1732
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:29,460
Like I said,
like martial arts or driving a fast

1733
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:30,420
sports car.

1734
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:32,340
Yeah.
But it doesn't affect me in a negative

1735
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:34,590
way.
Like if you say that I'm crazy because I

1736
01:13:34,591 --> 01:13:37,100
like to do stand up when I'm high,
like that's,

1737
01:13:37,101 --> 01:13:38,490
that's not,
that's not gonna affect me.

1738
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,460
Well,
Eh,

1739
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:46,470
well it's in a way your infant towel,
your infant [inaudible] that's on the

1740
01:13:46,471 --> 01:13:49,350
word.
Infantilizing infantilizing um,

1741
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:53,670
people that you would use that moniker
on.

1742
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:55,380
Well,
what do you gain from calling someone

1743
01:13:55,381 --> 01:13:56,214
crazy?
It's fun.

1744
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:56,701
Oh,
okay.

1745
01:13:56,701 --> 01:13:58,130
That's fine.
I like calling.

1746
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:01,440
I'm not,
what do you gain by any adjective?

1747
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:04,560
The question is what you wanted,
what you want to accomplish.

1748
01:14:04,561 --> 01:14:07,170
So I'm not moralizing against you using
that term.

1749
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:09,900
Go ahead.
But if you're interested in human

1750
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:11,200
freedom,
right.

1751
01:14:11,201 --> 01:14:12,070
And encouraging him

1752
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:16,000
and freedom than I would discourage
using the term crazy to describe

1753
01:14:16,001 --> 01:14:17,530
people's choices.
Wow.

1754
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:18,100
That's,
but,

1755
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:22,900
but I use it all the time and I'm in
favor of people's freedom and I think

1756
01:14:22,901 --> 01:14:24,790
he's crazy and he's awesome.
Like,

1757
01:14:24,791 --> 01:14:27,820
is that okay?
It's not about being okay or not.

1758
01:14:27,821 --> 01:14:29,020
Okay.
I'm just saying again,

1759
01:14:29,021 --> 01:14:31,090
it's about objectives.
What is your objective?

1760
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,690
If it's maximizing human freedom,
that's the word that doesn't reach that

1761
01:14:34,691 --> 01:14:35,240
objective.
Well,

1762
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,270
the idea behind that would be then
somehow or another,

1763
01:14:37,271 --> 01:14:40,340
the word crazy would have a negative
impact on the person that you,

1764
01:14:40,341 --> 01:14:42,940
you use it on what you're doing by
saying something as crazy as you're

1765
01:14:42,941 --> 01:14:44,690
saying.
They should not do this thing.

1766
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,480
No,
not at all.

1767
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:47,370
No.
I thought you were.

1768
01:14:47,370 --> 01:14:48,970
Oh,
about the bustle of the muscle.

1769
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:52,180
The bodybuilder.
I don't give a fuck if he lifts himself

1770
01:14:52,181 --> 01:14:53,620
to death.
It was my kid.

1771
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:55,080
I'd probably try to get them help.
Okay.

1772
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:57,370
Well,
but it's obviously it's used,

1773
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,620
you admit it's usually it's used in that
way though.

1774
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:01,090
It's used as a negative.
Right.

1775
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,330
Usually it's you're saying you should
not do that.

1776
01:15:04,331 --> 01:15:07,840
That's a bad thing to do.
You should not ride a motorcycle without

1777
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:09,220
a helmet.
That's crazy.

1778
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:12,610
It is.
But you're going to die anyway,

1779
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,290
you know?
I mean,

1780
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:18,370
I then I'm,
the way I view crazy is there's broad

1781
01:15:18,371 --> 01:15:19,660
ranges of crazy,
right?

1782
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:22,840
Like there's the crazy guy that walks in
the street talking to himself and he's

1783
01:15:22,841 --> 01:15:25,120
not on a Bluetooth headset.
He's just,

1784
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:28,000
you know,
having internal dialogues externally,

1785
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:29,470
that guy,
that's crazy person,

1786
01:15:29,471 --> 01:15:30,304
right?
Yeah.

1787
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:31,630
It's not crazy person.
Okay.

1788
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:38,740
What is that?
So it's very dangerous because people

1789
01:15:38,741 --> 01:15:41,440
have been locked up,
right.

1790
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:45,940
For behaviors that were called crazy
that you would never consider to be

1791
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:47,200
crazy now.
Right?

1792
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:48,940
Right.
Against their will.

1793
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:53,230
All kinds of behaviors have been
punished harshly,

1794
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:56,800
right.
Because they were deemed to be crazy or

1795
01:15:56,801 --> 01:15:57,940
insane.
Right.

1796
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,340
Or pathological.
So I,

1797
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:01,720
I,
you can do whatever you want,

1798
01:16:01,721 --> 01:16:04,450
but I don't want to be in the business
of labeling things,

1799
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,650
behaviors,
choices,

1800
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:09,280
other people's choices as those things,
because I know where I can lead them,

1801
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:12,040
they can lead them to lock up.
Well,

1802
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:13,050
I think there's a,
we're,

1803
01:16:13,051 --> 01:16:15,640
we're dealing with a broad definition of
the word crazy.

1804
01:16:15,641 --> 01:16:18,880
And some of them are pejorative and some
of them that are actually positive.

1805
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:22,450
And there's a lot of people that I find
to be crazy that I enjoy very much.

1806
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:24,040
And there was some of my favorite
people.

1807
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,750
It's also utterly arbitrary,
right?

1808
01:16:25,751 --> 01:16:30,190
So it becomes basically meaningless
isn't necessarily your crazy is someone

1809
01:16:30,191 --> 01:16:31,870
else's normal?
Well,

1810
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:35,440
if you watch a guy and he's walking a
tight rope in between two buildings,

1811
01:16:35,441 --> 01:16:37,630
a hundred stories up,
that guy's fucking crazy.

1812
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:42,160
I'm not saying that he should go to jail
or anyone wants to stop his choices,

1813
01:16:42,161 --> 01:16:45,860
but that is a fucking crazy thing to do
is I don't know.

1814
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:47,710
What does that mean though?
What do you think?

1815
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:49,840
We're playing games here like what are
we doing here?

1816
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:50,681
You,
you,

1817
01:16:50,681 --> 01:16:55,540
you've got on this road because,
because of the possibility that someone

1818
01:16:55,541 --> 01:16:58,210
who is transgender might be crazy like
this.

1819
01:16:58,211 --> 01:17:02,080
This should be taken into consideration
or the possibility that someone who gets

1820
01:17:02,081 --> 01:17:06,100
their face tattoo definition
pathologizing something by calling it

1821
01:17:06,101 --> 01:17:08,760
crazy.
You're saying that it's not normal it

1822
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:12,530
and basically you're suggesting at least
suggesting or just straight out saying

1823
01:17:12,531 --> 01:17:15,330
that it should not be done on a tight
rope.

1824
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:17,540
You shouldn't dress on.
She shouldn't dress as a woman.

1825
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:18,830
You should do whatever you want.
Okay.

1826
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,390
I a hundred percent think that you
should.

1827
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:22,190
If you really want to lift yourself to
death,

1828
01:17:22,191 --> 01:17:24,410
you should do it.
If you really want to walk on a tie rope

1829
01:17:24,411 --> 01:17:26,150
across two buildings,
you should do it.

1830
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:27,730
What is not?
I mean,

1831
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:30,140
how does one live?
Is there someone who's lived in the

1832
01:17:30,141 --> 01:17:32,600
world without being crazy?
That's a good point.

1833
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:37,670
It sounds like a very boring place.
I'm sure there is like a very non Joe

1834
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:39,620
Rogan kind of place to live in and the
non crazy place.

1835
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:41,510
Don't you think maybe like a guy who
works at a deli?

1836
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:43,820
Yeah.
Or just make sandwiches all,

1837
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,240
we should all make sandwiches.
All the sandwiches are fucking crazy.

1838
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:49,670
The term.
I see what you're saying.

1839
01:17:49,671 --> 01:17:52,880
But what if he's a trans sandwich maker?
Um,

1840
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:56,600
well maybe he's crazy.
Maybe it's just crazy.

1841
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:59,420
Yeah,
maybe he's crazy and a normal sandwich

1842
01:17:59,421 --> 01:18:01,730
guy.
Maybe he's a CIS gendered White Crazy

1843
01:18:01,731 --> 01:18:06,500
Sandwich Guy who hears words in his head
but doesn't respond to them.

1844
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:11,210
You just don't like to work crazy.
I don't,

1845
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:12,081
oh,
that's a good word.

1846
01:18:12,081 --> 01:18:13,580
I don't know.
I think it's a bad word.

1847
01:18:13,581 --> 01:18:14,450
No,
no.

1848
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:16,550
Go ahead.
Give you get like a little fucking

1849
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:17,930
rollercoaster ride.
You Go.

1850
01:18:17,931 --> 01:18:19,130
Holy Shit.
That was crazy.

1851
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:21,440
Do you ever say that?
I use it all the time.

1852
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:27,400
I just judge myself harshly.
I should have shame session,

1853
01:18:29,811 --> 01:18:30,770
you know,
by myself.

1854
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,580
I see what you're saying though.
What you're saying is you don't want to

1855
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:40,220
shame people or in any way affect our
choices and um,

1856
01:18:40,221 --> 01:18:43,350
you want to give them the freedom to do
whatever they want and by saying someone

1857
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,280
might be crazy,
you're possibly limiting that.

1858
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:48,020
Yes.
It's a shaming.

1859
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:49,370
It could be.
It can be,

1860
01:18:49,371 --> 01:18:51,820
not always,
but it will also are people with like

1861
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:56,950
legitimate pathologies that get involved
in all sorts of body modification things

1862
01:18:57,530 --> 01:18:58,080
like,
uh,

1863
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,070
there was a guy who got his nose cut off
and uh,

1864
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:04,060
he literally turned himself into the red
skull.

1865
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:04,791
Is that what it is?
The Guy,

1866
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:06,920
the captain America guy.
It's fucking terrifying.

1867
01:19:06,921 --> 01:19:10,640
He was a handsome guy,
but he had his nose cut off like the tip

1868
01:19:10,641 --> 01:19:13,790
of his nose cut off.
He had all these bolts put in his head.

1869
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:15,690
What's wrong with that?
No,

1870
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:17,360
it looks,
looks awesome.

1871
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,120
What is wrong with that?
Is that guy crazy areas.

1872
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:21,560
Look at that guy.
Wow.

1873
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:23,240
Wow.
Yeah.

1874
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:26,330
Well,
he seems like a normal guy to me.

1875
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:27,643
No,
he doesn't.

1876
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:29,900
Is that guy came home with your
daughter,

1877
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:31,100
would you do?
I'm not,

1878
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:33,020
I wouldn't call him crazy because I'm
scared of him.

1879
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,020
Oh,
because you are scared of Oh yeah.

1880
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:38,000
Yeah,
because he's obviously willing to do

1881
01:19:38,001 --> 01:19:39,800
this to his body.
What would he do to you?

1882
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:42,770
He had his eyeballs turned black with
tattoo ink.

1883
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:47,210
I would certainly say it's unusual.
What he is definitely unusual.

1884
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:49,490
It's possibly unique.

1885
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:51,560
It's really strange.
And what's really crazy?

1886
01:19:51,561 --> 01:19:53,270
If you see what he looked like
beforehand and go,

1887
01:19:53,271 --> 01:19:55,190
who was a pretty pretty good looking
guy,

1888
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:57,680
man.
Yeah.

1889
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:59,000
Yeah.
That's him beforehand,

1890
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:00,470
right?
I mean that is crazy.

1891
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:01,910
And thank you.
Yeah.

1892
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:02,630
Okay.
I'll give you,

1893
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:04,040
where do we draw the line?
I'll give you one.

1894
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:05,060
No,
I don't think it's crazy.

1895
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:06,410
Oh,
you don't think it's crazy?

1896
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:08,190
No kidding.
It'd be called crazy.

1897
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:11,850
It's arbitrary.
It's meeting those cutoffs face dyed red

1898
01:20:11,851 --> 01:20:13,590
and your,
your eyeballs tattooed.

1899
01:20:13,591 --> 01:20:15,690
Meaningless term.
Meaningless.

1900
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:19,290
It has a good meaning,
I think if you know,

1901
01:20:19,490 --> 01:20:22,620
if it,
if it helps sort of direct you in your

1902
01:20:22,621 --> 01:20:23,700
choices,
you know,

1903
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:26,060
like,
or if it helps describe like a,

1904
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:31,070
if that's your son and he does that and
someone says he sees that as his boy

1905
01:20:31,441 --> 01:20:35,640
went fucking crazy.
I'm not saying my son did that to his

1906
01:20:35,641 --> 01:20:36,740
face.
Right.

1907
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:39,090
But I wouldn't call it crazy.
What would you call it?

1908
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,390
Awesomely unique.
Call it.

1909
01:20:44,250 --> 01:20:48,360
I would call it unfortunate for me.
I look at him.

1910
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:49,560
Well,
no,

1911
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,630
because that's what he wants to do,
I guess.

1912
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:54,000
Does he though?
Maybe he's just crazy

1913
01:20:57,810 --> 01:21:01,950
people fucking stock.
I just to stop shaking.

1914
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:06,380
This'll never 30 minutes on the subject
of crazy.

1915
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:09,120
Um,
I see what you're saying though.

1916
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:10,980
I do.
I really do.

1917
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:11,843
I mean,
seriously,

1918
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:14,670
martial arts come on like crazy.
My God,

1919
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,600
you know,
if you're going to call it 100% people,

1920
01:21:16,601 --> 01:21:21,180
like people call that crazy all the time
and it's why it's illegal in some

1921
01:21:21,181 --> 01:21:22,170
states.
Well,

1922
01:21:22,171 --> 01:21:23,460
I mean it's a,
it's a reason.

1923
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,870
It's a cultural,
not really.

1924
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:26,540
Well,
I know the restaurant workers,

1925
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:29,850
not only that,
like martial arts aren't illegal in New

1926
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:32,310
York.
You granted it's considered crazy by

1927
01:21:32,311 --> 01:21:35,010
much of the population and if it works.
If it were not,

1928
01:21:35,011 --> 01:21:36,960
it probably would be legal everywhere.

1929
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:38,040
No,
that's not true.

1930
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:42,690
The only reason why it's illegal in New
York state is because of corruption.

1931
01:21:42,691 --> 01:21:43,910
That's the only reason why.
Well,

1932
01:21:43,911 --> 01:21:46,200
because boxing is not illegal and
kickboxing,

1933
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:47,910
it's not illegal and neither one of
those things are illegal.

1934
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:51,390
Those things are brutal and violent and
they are combat sports,

1935
01:21:51,391 --> 01:21:53,430
so it's not the combat sports are
illegal.

1936
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:56,790
It is that mixed martial arts is illegal
because of the culinary union and their

1937
01:21:56,791 --> 01:21:59,190
influence,
particularly on one politician who is

1938
01:21:59,191 --> 01:22:03,000
now going to jail most likely for the
rest of his life because of corruption

1939
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:06,960
and we're hoping to be getting into
Madison Square Garden in April.

1940
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:07,853
I know,
I know.

1941
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:08,820
I know all this.
I do,

1942
01:22:08,821 --> 01:22:09,930
but if,
if all,

1943
01:22:09,931 --> 01:22:12,990
if the entire New York state population
thought that mixed martial arts was

1944
01:22:12,991 --> 01:22:15,120
totally normal,
it would be legal.

1945
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:16,990
No,
that's not true because culinary again

1946
01:22:16,991 --> 01:22:18,630
would not have.
It's the power that it does,

1947
01:22:18,631 --> 01:22:21,750
but they do because a lot of the
population thinks that it's barbaric.

1948
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:22,561
Oh,
I don't know that.

1949
01:22:22,561 --> 01:22:25,470
They didn't vote on it.
The population has never voted or they

1950
01:22:25,471 --> 01:22:26,900
think,
of course the much of the popular,

1951
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:29,980
they haven't voted on it.
The population hasn't voted no,

1952
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,640
but you,
you do grant that much of the population

1953
01:22:32,641 --> 01:22:35,190
thinks it's sparked Paris.
There's a large percentage of people

1954
01:22:35,191 --> 01:22:36,810
that don't like any violence,
sports,

1955
01:22:36,811 --> 01:22:38,630
whether it's football,
whether it's boxing,

1956
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,860
whether it's mma.
I think it's animalistic barbaric.

1957
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:43,390
It is.
And a lot of wind cock fighting.

1958
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:45,590
Those guys are pussies though.
So I don't listen to this.

1959
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,900
What I hear,
are you allowed to use the word pussy?

1960
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:49,970
Oh my God,
he's Craig.

1961
01:22:49,971 --> 01:22:51,160
Kidding.
People are pussies within.

1962
01:22:51,161 --> 01:22:52,230
Not Crazy.
Wow.

1963
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:54,780
Interesting.
I can't even imagine what would happen

1964
01:22:54,781 --> 01:22:57,390
to me if I use that on a campus.
That's true.

1965
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:00,630
Calling some,
it's an interesting because pussy can be

1966
01:23:00,631 --> 01:23:03,000
a pejorative,
just like Dick can be a pejorative,

1967
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:05,820
but a very different kind of pejorative.
Dick is a,

1968
01:23:05,821 --> 01:23:06,060
uh,

1969
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:08,350
a forceful Pajaro.
He's a Dick.

1970
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:10,990
I could sell a mean person pussy.
There's weakness.

1971
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:11,843
Yes.
Right,

1972
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:13,480
right.
Or it can be awesome.

1973
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:15,360
Right.
I,

1974
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:18,220
I've noticed that people are starting to
call women Dick's now.

1975
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:20,260
Really haven't,
you know?

1976
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:21,820
Yeah.
And assholes.

1977
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:24,670
Assholes used to be only men.
Now it's now often women are called

1978
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:26,670
asshole.
I think women have always been called

1979
01:23:26,671 --> 01:23:28,720
that assholes,
but not,

1980
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:32,050
I don't think so.
Man gendered a lot of men are called

1981
01:23:32,051 --> 01:23:33,770
[inaudible] these days.
I know.

1982
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:35,040
That's one of your favorites.
I love it.

1983
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,033
Yeah,
it's a good one.

1984
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:37,540
Yeah.
I mean actually,

1985
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,600
you know,
I first heard people using cunt.

1986
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,280
Um,
it was,

1987
01:23:42,281 --> 01:23:44,450
uh,
feminists actually in college really

1988
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:46,300
used that for them,
uh,

1989
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:49,210
for,
for other women in a negative way.

1990
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:52,050
Sort of how black people.
Yeah.

1991
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:56,050
It's kind of like the Nigga of like
feminists of the 1980 [inaudible] he was

1992
01:23:56,350 --> 01:23:57,183
really was.

1993
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:02,520
That's my,
that's my country cut.

1994
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:05,620
Wow.
That's hilarious.

1995
01:24:05,621 --> 01:24:06,730
It's kind of true actually.
Yeah.

1996
01:24:06,731 --> 01:24:09,250
I don't think that's done anymore.
But I remember in the 80s and at least

1997
01:24:09,251 --> 01:24:12,550
in my circles,
it was definitely one of my favorite

1998
01:24:12,551 --> 01:24:15,940
things about going to the UK is how
freely they throw that around.

1999
01:24:15,941 --> 01:24:17,620
I know,
but in a good way,

2000
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:18,340
like,
hey,

2001
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:19,430
he's a good con.
Exactly.

2002
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,080
It's fucking con.
They love it.

2003
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:28,240
They throw it around like a beach ball,
like 30 or 40 years behind the U S in

2004
01:24:29,141 --> 01:24:31,510
gender politics,
which may be good or bad,

2005
01:24:31,511 --> 01:24:31,961
but I mean,
you know,

2006
01:24:31,961 --> 01:24:33,670
they haven't,
they're always behind a bit.

2007
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,220
Like I still call women girls.
It's,

2008
01:24:36,221 --> 01:24:38,050
that's common there.
But do you,

2009
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,760
yeah.
Do you ever say you girlfriend where

2010
01:24:39,761 --> 01:24:41,410
that's not correct?
The United States.

2011
01:24:41,411 --> 01:24:43,060
Do you get corrected when you say my
girlfriend?

2012
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:47,030
No,
but I,

2013
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,120
I,
it's hard coming out of my mouth

2014
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:54,240
considering our age.
I kinda like it and I wish I could say

2015
01:24:54,431 --> 01:24:55,530
girlfriend,
you can,

2016
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:56,860
you can do whatever you want.
Yeah.

2017
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,091
Come on,
man.

2018
01:24:58,091 --> 01:25:00,710
Freedom.
I'm trying to be on it.

2019
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,380
I'm working on it.
I'm trying to get out.

2020
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:05,440
You're my avenue out.
Am I helping you?

2021
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:07,180
Oh yeah.
These kind of conversations.

2022
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:08,560
Trouble.
Totally.

2023
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:10,150
None of getting in trouble is good.
Right?

2024
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:11,990
Because that forces you out of places
you shouldn't be in,

2025
01:25:11,991 --> 01:25:13,780
in the first place.
Well,

2026
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:17,380
I,
I certainly think that the boxy confines

2027
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:22,030
of ideas that you seem to be forced into
when you're a professor at a college,

2028
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:26,620
it definitely reinforces this sort of
self censorship.

2029
01:25:27,070 --> 01:25:28,210
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

2030
01:25:28,211 --> 01:25:30,430
I'm always,
you have to watch yourself all the time.

2031
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:32,680
That seems so exhausting.
Yeah.

2032
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:36,760
I have like a standup comedian spirit.
I'm not saying I'm as funny,

2033
01:25:36,761 --> 01:25:39,790
but like the spirit of a comedian,
but in a professor's body.

2034
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:41,440
So do you,
um,

2035
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:45,820
like a range,
certain bits of humor in your,

2036
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:48,970
in your curriculum,
in your courses that you teach?

2037
01:25:48,971 --> 01:25:49,960
Do you have like,
I mean,

2038
01:25:49,961 --> 01:25:51,010
in my teaching?
Sure.

2039
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,130
I mean,
I think I,

2040
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:53,650
I'm funny sometimes.
Yeah.

2041
01:25:53,651 --> 01:25:57,850
And I'm much freer in the classroom
cause the other professors aren't there.

2042
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:00,340
Right.
But do you have to be careful of

2043
01:26:00,341 --> 01:26:02,400
children because it's not videotaped.
Right.

2044
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:02,930
Oh,
right,

2045
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:03,471
right.
Yeah.

2046
01:26:03,471 --> 01:26:04,040
So it won't get

2047
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:04,401
out.
I mean,

2048
01:26:04,401 --> 01:26:06,260
it could though.
You could get out.

2049
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:07,640
I mean,
but only by word of mouth.

2050
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:10,010
Um,
it's not gonna be on Youtube.

2051
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:15,260
That's such a drag.
It's a real drag.

2052
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,750
Yeah.
So we're going to reinvent it though.

2053
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:20,630
Renegade University.
It's coming.

2054
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:22,730
Do you worry about that word being kind
of Douchey?

2055
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,620
Which one?
Renegade.

2056
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:26,150
Oh,
is it Douchey?

2057
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:29,350
What's a little bit us?
A little bit like almost my brand man.

2058
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:31,130
I know Ben to get history of the United
States.

2059
01:26:31,131 --> 01:26:32,120
Your book,
my brand.

2060
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:37,190
But the word renegade and like you know
you're gonna got a bunch of dudes are

2061
01:26:37,191 --> 01:26:39,350
sons of anarchy fan,
so shitty tee shirts.

2062
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:40,970
I've seen that.
Yeah.

2063
01:26:40,971 --> 01:26:45,680
There's been some renegades bro.
I have noticed the Douche tinge renegade

2064
01:26:45,681 --> 01:26:47,820
might be careful with that word
renegades.

2065
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,600
A tricky word.
It's,

2066
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,800
it works for the,
for a book of renegade history of the

2067
01:26:51,801 --> 01:26:52,634
United States.

2068
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:56,600
But as far as for a whole university,
I'll see.

2069
01:26:56,690 --> 01:26:58,490
I don't know,
maybe just call it crazy.

2070
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,550
You've raised you.
Well a friend of mine suggested it

2071
01:27:01,551 --> 01:27:04,640
should be called fuck you.
Which I like that friends.

2072
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:05,540
Probably crazy.
Yeah,

2073
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:12,590
I'm sure it is.
So you look at it like it's your brand,

2074
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:14,570
like the word renegade is because of the
book.

2075
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:17,240
Oh yeah.
I mean the idea is I'm going to be

2076
01:27:17,241 --> 01:27:19,550
teaching in the university will be
influenced,

2077
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:22,160
come out of the boom.
Do you feel like though that it's

2078
01:27:22,161 --> 01:27:25,790
possible to like limit the people that
are willing to enroll at renegade

2079
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:28,070
university?
Because it just the name,

2080
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:29,210
the moniker.
Oh,

2081
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:34,400
perhaps that'll turn off some customers
perhaps that are looking for,

2082
01:27:34,410 --> 01:27:35,670
they don't like this name.
Um,

2083
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,880
I don't mind.
It wouldn't hold me back,

2084
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:40,490
but I just see there could,
it could be limiting.

2085
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:41,790
Uh,
I don't know.

2086
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:43,250
We'll see.
We'll see.

2087
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:45,350
Maybe those are the people I don't want
anyway.

2088
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:46,670
That's a good point.
Yeah.

2089
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,800
Maybe.
I know what you mean though.

2090
01:27:48,801 --> 01:27:52,790
It can't has like a sons of anarchy.
It's kind of got vibe a little bit.

2091
01:27:52,791 --> 01:27:53,390
Like,
yeah.

2092
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:56,720
Somebody might be riding a harley trying
to escape from nothing.

2093
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:58,640
Right,
right.

2094
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:02,030
I'm a renegade,
bro.

2095
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,180
I gotta fuck a jolly Roger Tattooed on
my ass.

2096
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:08,910
I don't know.
It's just people are strange that's

2097
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,430
trained with words,
but not crazy.

2098
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:14,360
Um,
when you're formulating this university,

2099
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:15,950
do you have,
uh,

2100
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:20,180
like a,
a plan for launching it and for like,

2101
01:28:20,181 --> 01:28:23,030
how are you going to roll out courses
and are you going to,

2102
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:25,210
you got to create all the courses?
Yeah,

2103
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:26,720
I mean it's going to start,
uh,

2104
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:29,840
with sort of standalone lectures that
you can download and listen to like

2105
01:28:29,841 --> 01:28:31,880
podcasts or you can watch the videos of
them.

2106
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:35,990
Um,
and then if there's sufficient interest,

2107
01:28:35,991 --> 01:28:38,720
I'll have interactive seminars.
There's lots of great platforms for

2108
01:28:38,721 --> 01:28:40,450
that,
uh,

2109
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:41,120
where you can,
you know,

2110
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:45,580
talk to me and we can have an exchange
online and you do a chat or email with

2111
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:48,290
other students.
The exact format we haven't worked out

2112
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:49,910
yet.
Or are you going to have the time to do

2113
01:28:49,911 --> 01:28:51,320
that?
Well,

2114
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:54,290
I'm gonna stop teaching and these
colleges the idea,

2115
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:58,250
so the idea is to completely dedicate
all your time to this ultimate,

2116
01:28:58,251 --> 01:28:59,690
that's what I would like.
Wow.

2117
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:00,553
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2118
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:02,730
And will you stay in Oregon if you do
that or were you,

2119
01:29:02,731 --> 01:29:03,960
uh,
uh,

2120
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:06,690
I dunno.
I mean I probably do it both in Oregon

2121
01:29:06,691 --> 01:29:09,600
and in La.
Both go back and forth.

2122
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:12,660
Yeah.
So do you have like a,

2123
01:29:12,661 --> 01:29:14,760
it's like a five year plan or a 10 year
plan?

2124
01:29:14,761 --> 01:29:15,630
Like how are you,
uh,

2125
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:16,650
how you kind of rolled this out?

2126
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,480
Who knows?
It's going to roll out next year.

2127
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,180
If it's successful,
it could be for the rest of my life.

2128
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,800
Wow.
I would like it to be.

2129
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:23,880
And so,
um,

2130
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:25,320
how are you structuring this?
Like,

2131
01:29:25,321 --> 01:29:26,160
do you,
do you,

2132
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:31,110
do you have like a gigantic powerpoint
you've laid out or like how are you?

2133
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:32,400
Um,
yeah,

2134
01:29:32,401 --> 01:29:34,680
I mean there'll be,
there'll be some production and there'll

2135
01:29:34,681 --> 01:29:36,930
be some powerpoint stuff,
graphics,

2136
01:29:36,931 --> 01:29:38,700
you know,
I might actually use an old school

2137
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:43,080
whiteboard in the background depending
on what I'm presenting or videos and

2138
01:29:43,081 --> 01:29:43,860
videos.
Right.

2139
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:44,693
So,
um,

2140
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:46,170
be multimedia.
Yeah.

2141
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:49,080
Wow.
How long have you been thinking about

2142
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:49,620
those years?
Really?

2143
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:50,160
Yeah.
I mean,

2144
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:54,450
I started becoming disaffected with
colleges and universities probably 10

2145
01:29:54,451 --> 01:29:55,950
years ago,
uh,

2146
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:59,160
after getting fired from Barnard College
and Columbia.

2147
01:29:59,190 --> 01:30:01,140
Um,
and then I get fired for,

2148
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,990
did you talk about in the last podcast
he being a white man?

2149
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:04,381
Oh,
why?

2150
01:30:04,381 --> 01:30:06,120
Why'd you leave?
Because of my ideas.

2151
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:07,820
What ideas,
um,

2152
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:10,320
about is really both those reasons.
Yeah.

2153
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:11,183
People just,
well,

2154
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,870
I mean,
I'd say things you're not supposed to

2155
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:13,950
say.
And My,

2156
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:15,700
the renegade history stuff is,
didn't,

2157
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:20,400
didn't go over well with a lot of the
professoriate and they wanted to,

2158
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:22,590
they wanted a black woman also for that
job.

2159
01:30:22,591 --> 01:30:24,330
And then it's happened to me again at
Occidental.

2160
01:30:24,331 --> 01:30:27,720
I was disqualified from a tenure track
job about two years ago because of my

2161
01:30:27,721 --> 01:30:31,290
race.
And because of your race specifically?

2162
01:30:31,291 --> 01:30:34,470
That's what they said.
I was told behind the scenes.

2163
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:35,304
Yes.
Hmm.

2164
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,880
How'd they say it?
We weren't going to hire a white guy.

2165
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:42,270
Wow.
So yes,

2166
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:43,710
it's happened twice.
Yeah.

2167
01:30:43,711 --> 01:30:45,390
It's very depressing.
So depressing.

2168
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:46,380
Yeah.
I mean it's just,

2169
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:49,800
it's,
I don't know if it's equally depressing

2170
01:30:49,801 --> 01:30:51,810
that they wouldn't hire a black woman.

2171
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:54,540
Um,
I think it's probably more depressing.

2172
01:30:54,541 --> 01:30:56,490
They wouldn't hire a black woman for
whatever reason,

2173
01:30:56,491 --> 01:30:58,740
cause there's so many more white men
doing your job,

2174
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:00,240
but it's just,
it's,

2175
01:31:00,241 --> 01:31:02,910
it's,
it's not much less depressing.

2176
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:04,860
It's,
it's racist.

2177
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,750
It's ways.
It's also illegal.

2178
01:31:07,230 --> 01:31:07,771
Yeah.
I mean,

2179
01:31:07,771 --> 01:31:11,580
you can't do it according to the civil
rights act of 1964 they do it all the

2180
01:31:11,581 --> 01:31:13,020
time.
They just do it without,

2181
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:15,360
you know,
without making it public.

2182
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:20,160
What is this recent trend amongst kids
where they're saying that white people

2183
01:31:20,161 --> 01:31:22,590
can't be racist?
It's absurd.

2184
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:24,660
Excuse me.
Black people can't be racist.

2185
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,650
Black people can't be racist towards
white people because they don't have any

2186
01:31:28,651 --> 01:31:32,880
power.
And that racism is imposing your own

2187
01:31:32,881 --> 01:31:35,310
prejudices on other people.
And this is like,

2188
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:37,110
but they're,
they're trying to redefine it.

2189
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:40,410
And people were saying,
check the wikipedia for the definition

2190
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:41,670
of racism.
Like what?

2191
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:46,410
Yeah,
so racism in its classical sense is the

2192
01:31:46,411 --> 01:31:51,411
belief that there are distinct and
hierarchical biological races of human

2193
01:31:51,571 --> 01:31:52,530
beings,
right?

2194
01:31:52,531 --> 01:31:53,670
Yes.
Okay.

2195
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,140
That's racism,
right?

2196
01:31:55,141 --> 01:31:56,370
It's classical sense.
Right?

2197
01:31:56,371 --> 01:31:59,350
Then there's like prejudice and cultural
dislike and you know,

2198
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:03,280
but that's um,
so anyone can be racist against anyone

2199
01:32:03,281 --> 01:32:04,030
else.
Right.

2200
01:32:04,030 --> 01:32:06,880
Um,
there is a point to be made there that

2201
01:32:06,881 --> 01:32:11,881
some groups have power and some don't.
So some who are racist can do things

2202
01:32:12,551 --> 01:32:13,860
about it,
right?

2203
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:16,210
And some can't.
But of course,

2204
01:32:16,211 --> 01:32:19,960
black people can be racist if they think
that there are biologically distinct and

2205
01:32:19,961 --> 01:32:22,780
hierarchical races of human beings,
which some do.

2206
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:26,380
I watched some white rapper,
they just can't put anybody in prison

2207
01:32:26,381 --> 01:32:27,820
about it.
And people were,

2208
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:30,100
this was so frustrating as young kids
were saying,

2209
01:32:30,101 --> 01:32:32,710
he's woke as fuck.
Like he's woke,

2210
01:32:32,990 --> 01:32:34,360
he woke,
he's awake,

2211
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:36,580
he's woke,
he woke as fuck.

2212
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,920
And then people were like saying,
you know,

2213
01:32:38,921 --> 01:32:41,440
you're ignorant to two people that
disagreed.

2214
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:44,300
Y'all need to check wikipedia.
Like what?

2215
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:46,660
Check wikipedia.
This is amazing.

2216
01:32:46,661 --> 01:32:51,660
Like they've redefined the term racist.
They're saying white people can only,

2217
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:54,250
or black people can only be prejudice.
They can't be racist.

2218
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:58,450
Black people can be racist.
They just can't do much about it.

2219
01:32:58,510 --> 01:32:59,440
Well,
they can against,

2220
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,050
I mean if they are an employer and they
don't want to hire a Chinese,

2221
01:33:02,051 --> 01:33:04,870
some blacks can veer a black guy and you
have a business.

2222
01:33:04,871 --> 01:33:06,730
You don't want to hire Chinese people
because you don't like Chinese.

2223
01:33:07,130 --> 01:33:09,790
Just as a group,
they can't do much unless they're in

2224
01:33:09,791 --> 01:33:12,730
South Africa where they control the
government.

2225
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:15,730
Right.
10 black people can not only be racist,

2226
01:33:15,731 --> 01:33:18,520
but they can put you in jail if you're
the wrong race.

2227
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:20,230
I just,
I'm struggling for the time to be able

2228
01:33:20,231 --> 01:33:21,100
to use that term.

2229
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:24,210
He's woke as fuck.
The day is coming,

2230
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:28,210
woke the term,
woke

2231
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:34,690
all these wacky kids today telling you,
well,

2232
01:33:34,691 --> 01:33:37,330
I just don't understand that there's no
benefit.

2233
01:33:37,331 --> 01:33:40,660
And redefining the words.
Of course people can be,

2234
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:44,350
they can do wrong things,
whether they're based on racial

2235
01:33:44,351 --> 01:33:49,120
prejudices or sociological prejudices or
economic or class,

2236
01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:52,210
whatever the fuck it is.
This of course there's prejudices.

2237
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:53,111
You know,
why,

2238
01:33:53,111 --> 01:33:55,930
why redefine them like that?
Like why even waste any time.

2239
01:33:55,931 --> 01:33:58,780
It's just,
it seems like there's all this frivolous

2240
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:03,220
bantering of,
of what should and shouldn't be used as

2241
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:08,221
far as like language,
racism and sexism and homophobia are

2242
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:11,200
almost meaningless now because they're
applied to almost everything.

2243
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:12,191
So,
you know,

2244
01:34:12,191 --> 01:34:13,930
saying,
I don't like Chinese food has been

2245
01:34:13,931 --> 01:34:15,670
called racist.
It's not,

2246
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:19,210
you can even say,
I don't like Chinese people and not

2247
01:34:19,211 --> 01:34:20,620
necessarily be racist.
Right.

2248
01:34:20,621 --> 01:34:22,060
That's just a cultural preference.

2249
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:23,500
Right.
Um,

2250
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:27,670
if you say Chinese people are
biologically,

2251
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:30,610
naturally better at math,
that is racist.

2252
01:34:30,611 --> 01:34:31,421
Don't you think?
If you say,

2253
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:33,340
I don't like Chinese people,
that's racist.

2254
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:36,790
Not in a general the,
it's not necessarily you,

2255
01:34:36,850 --> 01:34:40,090
but you're generalizing about a billion
plus people.

2256
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:40,511
Yeah.
Oh,

2257
01:34:40,511 --> 01:34:41,620
sure.
It's stupid.

2258
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:43,840
I mean,
it's ignorance and it's a gross

2259
01:34:43,841 --> 01:34:46,480
generalization,
but it's not necessarily a belief that

2260
01:34:46,481 --> 01:34:49,720
they are biologically distinct.
It could be a preference.

2261
01:34:50,160 --> 01:34:52,770
You don't like the way they look,
they feed,

2262
01:34:52,850 --> 01:34:55,770
you don't wear the clothes they wear,
you know,

2263
01:34:55,810 --> 01:34:56,531
whatever.
I'm just,

2264
01:34:56,531 --> 01:34:58,480
I'm not in the jasmine.
Right,

2265
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:01,880
right.
I like using fois silk,

2266
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:05,330
all these silk paddler's.
What am I even saying?

2267
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,070
Um,
yeah.

2268
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:08,170
I,
it's,

2269
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:12,680
we're going to have to somehow or
another get over this as a race.

2270
01:35:12,681 --> 01:35:15,370
We're going to have to get over
ridiculous vice president.

2271
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:16,640
Yeah.
As a race.

2272
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:18,950
I mean,
not as a human race.

2273
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:23,950
We're going to have to get over that
origins or your ancestors and languages

2274
01:35:24,531 --> 01:35:27,380
that you speak and just be able to
appreciate each other for what the fuck

2275
01:35:27,381 --> 01:35:30,770
we are.
But how's that going to happen?

2276
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,790
Well,
but then again,

2277
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:33,650
we don't want to get rid of cultural
differences,

2278
01:35:33,651 --> 01:35:34,250
right?
No,

2279
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:35,130
no,
that's not what I'm saying.

2280
01:35:35,131 --> 01:35:37,010
Yeah.
I'm saying appreciate each other for

2281
01:35:37,011 --> 01:35:42,011
what we are and just this idea that
people can generalize or be racist and

2282
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:45,920
that,
that seems to be a counterproductive

2283
01:35:45,921 --> 01:35:47,840
idea that I don't understand.
It's,

2284
01:35:47,841 --> 01:35:48,674
it's,
it's,

2285
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:53,210
it's a kin to tribalism,
which is sort of dissipating and

2286
01:35:53,211 --> 01:35:56,120
nationalism,
which was also sort of dissipating over

2287
01:35:56,121 --> 01:35:59,630
time as we integrate with all these
other cultures all throughout the world.

2288
01:35:59,631 --> 01:36:03,080
And you have google translate and you
can understand what people were saying

2289
01:36:03,081 --> 01:36:07,010
and other places.
But because of the separations of

2290
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,920
languages and cultures and things like
that,

2291
01:36:09,921 --> 01:36:13,250
you're always going to have people that
are wary of people that they don't know

2292
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,113
or understand.

2293
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:16,970
I mean,
classical racism has declined

2294
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:18,560
dramatically.
Oh,

2295
01:36:18,561 --> 01:36:19,580
I'm sure.
Last hundred years.

2296
01:36:19,581 --> 01:36:20,900
I mean,
until World War II,

2297
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:22,640
it was dominant and respectable.
I mean,

2298
01:36:22,641 --> 01:36:25,280
it was taught and at Harvard and all the
Ivy League schools,

2299
01:36:25,281 --> 01:36:26,570
it was,
everyone talked about,

2300
01:36:26,660 --> 01:36:27,730
well,
how about braces?

2301
01:36:27,731 --> 01:36:30,010
Interracial couples like black.
Anyway,

2302
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:32,300
Connie was illegal rise,
illegal for them to get married and so

2303
01:36:32,301 --> 01:36:33,380
many teen sixties.
Right?

2304
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,590
And so that was all replaced after World
War II,

2305
01:36:36,591 --> 01:36:37,250
basically,
in,

2306
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:40,160
in respectable discourse.
Not that racists went away,

2307
01:36:40,161 --> 01:36:42,860
but in respectable discourse,
you couldn't use the n word anymore.

2308
01:36:42,861 --> 01:36:44,270
Right.
Um,

2309
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:45,340
and what,
what,

2310
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:48,440
what road was replaced by is what we
call racial liberalism,

2311
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:51,080
which is this paternalist stuff we've
been talking about that goes on in

2312
01:36:51,081 --> 01:36:54,260
campuses,
which was assimilationist as well.

2313
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:58,010
The idea was we need to get these black
people into our institutions to train

2314
01:36:58,011 --> 01:36:59,200
them to become like us,
right?

2315
01:36:59,201 --> 01:37:01,310
It's a Brown v Board of education,
1954,

2316
01:37:01,311 --> 01:37:03,380
the integration supreme court decision.

2317
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:07,130
That was what was said in that decision.
We need to get black people into our

2318
01:37:07,131 --> 01:37:10,250
schools so that we can make them into
good citizens,

2319
01:37:10,251 --> 01:37:12,020
good soldiers,
and good workers.

2320
01:37:13,070 --> 01:37:15,200
Right?
So that's what these black kids in

2321
01:37:15,201 --> 01:37:16,730
colleges are dealing with.
Right?

2322
01:37:16,731 --> 01:37:19,670
So they're not completely crazy.
They have real legitimate grievances.

2323
01:37:19,671 --> 01:37:22,640
They are there for two reasons.
One,

2324
01:37:22,641 --> 01:37:25,610
to assimilate into the dominant culture,
right?

2325
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:28,310
To shed their own culture.
It's not so cool.

2326
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:30,020
And to,
and this has been said,

2327
01:37:30,021 --> 01:37:34,400
it's very explicit to enrich the
experiences of the white students in

2328
01:37:34,401 --> 01:37:35,870
colleges.
That's hilarious.

2329
01:37:35,871 --> 01:37:38,450
That's a diversity has been stated as
its purpose.

2330
01:37:38,451 --> 01:37:42,920
So bringing in African students will
enrich the American students from

2331
01:37:42,921 --> 01:37:45,380
Nebraska.
That is the argument that has been made

2332
01:37:45,381 --> 01:37:49,760
explicitly for decades.
White kids benefit from being around

2333
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:52,070
other cultures,
other people's,

2334
01:37:52,071 --> 01:37:53,930
other races.
How bizarre.

2335
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:54,891
Oh yeah.
Well,

2336
01:37:54,891 --> 01:37:59,891
but imagine being the one black kid in
the class of 20 people or 30 people.

2337
01:38:01,230 --> 01:38:03,390
Right.
And knowing that you're there for that

2338
01:38:03,391 --> 01:38:05,730
reason,
that would make me crazy.

2339
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:07,650
It'd be pissed.
It would make you pissed off.

2340
01:38:07,680 --> 01:38:08,250
Definitely.
Yeah.

2341
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:10,020
Well that's,
I think that's actually the source of a

2342
01:38:10,021 --> 01:38:13,350
lot of the rage that's going on.
It gets expressed in all kinds of funky

2343
01:38:13,351 --> 01:38:16,410
ways that I'm not a fan of.
But I do think that's at the heart of a

2344
01:38:16,411 --> 01:38:19,220
lot of it.
Oh Wow.

2345
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:22,050
That has to be acknowledged.
And a lot of the students do say this.

2346
01:38:22,051 --> 01:38:22,591
I mean,
they're very,

2347
01:38:22,591 --> 01:38:23,940
a lot of them,
most of them I think are,

2348
01:38:23,950 --> 01:38:27,150
are aware of that.
This tokenism that goes on and

2349
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:30,090
assimilation ism and they know they're
in that class for that reason.

2350
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:31,800
It's,
it's kind of disgusting.

2351
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:33,750
What are your feelings on Trans Racial
people?

2352
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,020
Oh,
like Rachel Dolezal and the the guy who

2353
01:38:37,021 --> 01:38:40,320
was until recently,
he was in the black lives matter and

2354
01:38:40,321 --> 01:38:41,154
they found that shocking.

2355
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:42,870
I don't believe that actually.
I think,

2356
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,910
I believe what I believe that his father
was black,

2357
01:38:45,030 --> 01:38:47,580
but his mom and his dad are both white.
Well,

2358
01:38:47,581 --> 01:38:50,100
the story is that his mom had an affair
with a black man.

2359
01:38:50,101 --> 01:38:53,490
It's only his story and unsubstantiated.
I don't know.

2360
01:38:53,550 --> 01:38:55,590
He was right.
He refuses to take DNA tests.

2361
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:58,140
But you agreed that racism is,
fuck,

2362
01:38:58,141 --> 01:39:02,790
I don't think I have many times I am.
Even these,

2363
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,220
he's got the little pencil thin mustache
in order to try to accentuate the,

2364
01:39:06,221 --> 01:39:07,920
but you said there's only an American
looks.

2365
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:12,090
I know,
but you said there's only one human race

2366
01:39:12,490 --> 01:39:14,460
all,
it's all a con studies.

2367
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:17,100
He's appropriating African American
culture.

2368
01:39:17,430 --> 01:39:18,750
Oh,
that's what I think.

2369
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:19,800
That's okay too.
Right?

2370
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,960
Well,
it's like there's been stories written

2371
01:39:21,961 --> 01:39:24,750
about this,
like where they've gone pretty deep into

2372
01:39:24,751 --> 01:39:29,190
this guy's passed and no one agrees.
Not only that he wrote on when he was a

2373
01:39:29,191 --> 01:39:32,340
victim of a hate crime back then.
He wrote his race as white.

2374
01:39:33,150 --> 01:39:34,260
Like,
that's what he wrote on the police

2375
01:39:34,261 --> 01:39:36,600
report.
Like you're talking about a guy like

2376
01:39:36,601 --> 01:39:37,530
there's,
I don't know,

2377
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:38,601
just guessing.
Yeah,

2378
01:39:38,601 --> 01:39:41,310
we were,
we can't know and he looks white to me,

2379
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:43,610
but let's say he is a Rachel Dolezal
type.

2380
01:39:43,611 --> 01:39:44,410
Right?
Okay.

2381
01:39:44,410 --> 01:39:47,370
Pretty sure.
And if race is a social construct than

2382
01:39:47,371 --> 01:39:49,620
their whatever,
they will be all Africans.

2383
01:39:49,621 --> 01:39:51,440
Even you take a pasty fine.
No,

2384
01:39:51,450 --> 01:39:55,110
thank you.
We're all Irish.

2385
01:39:55,170 --> 01:39:56,003
Pink Self.

2386
01:39:58,350 --> 01:39:59,820
A little Jewish.
Russian,

2387
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:01,250
Russian.
Well,

2388
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:02,240
Sean,
while you're African,

2389
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:03,093
totally African.
Yeah.

2390
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,840
Well everybody is.
It's where the cradle of civilization.

2391
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:07,440
So Shaun King could be whatever he wants
to be.

2392
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:10,080
That's what I think I,
that's what my argument was for Rachel

2393
01:40:10,081 --> 01:40:15,081
dolls me to spray Tan herself and
exactly do herself up in a fro.

2394
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:20,250
Wasn't it amazing how you had social
justice warriors saying that she

2395
01:40:20,251 --> 01:40:22,740
couldn't do that,
but Caitlin Jenner,

2396
01:40:22,770 --> 01:40:24,180
yes.
It should be celebrated.

2397
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:25,290
Yes.
That's my point.

2398
01:40:25,291 --> 01:40:26,280
Right.
That was my point.

2399
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:28,470
Amazing.
That was an amazing moment.

2400
01:40:28,471 --> 01:40:29,790
It's adorable.
That contradiction.

2401
01:40:29,791 --> 01:40:32,700
Yeah.
Why can't you decide that you are more

2402
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:37,020
properly identify with people that are
African Americans,

2403
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:41,340
but do you think people would get pissed
if you appropriated the Polish culture?

2404
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:42,960
Those people wouldn't give a fuck.
Yeah.

2405
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:48,020
My book is full of examples going back
250 years of whites appropriating in a

2406
01:40:48,601 --> 01:40:50,370
celebratory way,
black culture,

2407
01:40:50,371 --> 01:40:52,530
loving it,
wanting to be black,

2408
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:54,400
as many of them have claimed to be
black.

2409
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:59,400
There was a jazz musician named Mez,
Mez Rao in the 20th century who he said,

2410
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:01,420
he never said he was actually black,
but he said,

2411
01:41:01,421 --> 01:41:04,240
I'm renouncing my whiteness.
I'm going to be with black people.

2412
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:06,820
He married a black woman,
hang out with black people all the time,

2413
01:41:06,821 --> 01:41:08,200
ma'am.
He said he,

2414
01:41:08,201 --> 01:41:10,060
I didn't want to be wide.
He only wanted to be black.

2415
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:10,960
Good for him.
Mine.

2416
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:12,640
Why not raise a fuck.
Yeah,

2417
01:41:12,641 --> 01:41:13,750
exactly.
More fun.

2418
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:18,100
I just think that when you make stories
up about your past,

2419
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,890
oh,
why don't we find out that's not true.

2420
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:24,010
Well,
you've created some sort of a fantasy

2421
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,660
narrative.
Yeah.

2422
01:41:25,661 --> 01:41:28,720
That's not what Mez and Ezra was doing.
He was always up front about everything.

2423
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:30,130
And he was like a Jewish guy,
I think.

2424
01:41:30,131 --> 01:41:30,701
And he said,
no,

2425
01:41:30,701 --> 01:41:32,110
I'm not.
I'm just not gonna be Jewish anymore.

2426
01:41:32,650 --> 01:41:33,870
I was Jewish.
I'm not anymore.

2427
01:41:34,050 --> 01:41:35,350
Hmm.
Interesting.

2428
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:36,970
Yeah.
But Jewish is not really,

2429
01:41:37,290 --> 01:41:39,880
that's a religion.
Well,

2430
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,550
again,
Jewish is a weird one though.

2431
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:42,281
You're asking.
I mean,

2432
01:41:42,281 --> 01:41:43,810
right,
of course it's been defined in many

2433
01:41:43,811 --> 01:41:46,210
ways.
It's kind of a race and a religion and a

2434
01:41:46,211 --> 01:41:46,831
lot of ways,
right?

2435
01:41:46,831 --> 01:41:48,790
I think we talked about this last time.
So the Jews,

2436
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:51,910
uh,
until World War Two were considered to

2437
01:41:51,911 --> 01:41:53,410
be a separate race,
very much so.

2438
01:41:53,411 --> 01:41:55,600
And there was a debate about whether
they were black.

2439
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:57,880
Many,
many scholars thought they were black.

2440
01:41:57,881 --> 01:42:00,280
Wow.
Or whether they were sort of an ape sort

2441
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:02,260
of missing link,
the missing link,

2442
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:04,390
or they were just something else
entirely.

2443
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:08,050
But they were definitely not white.
What's amazing about Jewish people is

2444
01:42:08,051 --> 01:42:11,590
how many European Jews have won Nobel
prizes.

2445
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:16,150
How many European Jews,
brilliant scientists and mathematicians.

2446
01:42:16,151 --> 01:42:17,740
And that's incorrect.
It's a what?

2447
01:42:17,741 --> 01:42:19,840
A what an amazing gene pool.

2448
01:42:19,870 --> 01:42:21,220
Well,
it's in the European Jews.

2449
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:22,540
I mean,
it's always been an intellectual

2450
01:42:22,541 --> 01:42:23,480
culture.
You know,

2451
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:27,220
the rabbis and studying the texts and
the town would,

2452
01:42:27,221 --> 01:42:29,320
and you know what I mean?
It's always been a heady intellectual

2453
01:42:29,321 --> 01:42:31,030
culture.
I think that's where it comes from.

2454
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:32,590
So that's most likely,
right?

2455
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:33,250
Yeah.
And that's,

2456
01:42:33,250 --> 01:42:36,370
I think that's why they're also
overrepresented in politics in

2457
01:42:36,371 --> 01:42:38,490
particular radical politics.
Um,

2458
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:41,950
if you look at socialism and communism
and anarchism,

2459
01:42:41,951 --> 01:42:42,551
it's just,
you know,

2460
01:42:42,551 --> 01:42:46,210
huge percentages of Jews participating.
And I think it's because they're

2461
01:42:46,270 --> 01:42:48,460
essentially intellectual movements.
Right?

2462
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:50,470
Um,
so yeah,

2463
01:42:50,471 --> 01:42:50,890
no,
it's,

2464
01:42:50,890 --> 01:42:54,280
it's an amazing Jewish,
oh yeah.

2465
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:56,850
Right.
Huge representation in standup comedy.

2466
01:42:56,851 --> 01:42:59,170
It's right from the beginning.
That's right.

2467
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:00,940
I mean,
wasn't Lenny Bruce Jewish?

2468
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:02,070
Very,
very,

2469
01:43:02,071 --> 01:43:03,490
the greatest of the greats.
I mean,

2470
01:43:03,491 --> 01:43:04,420
he was,
without him,

2471
01:43:04,421 --> 01:43:07,480
there would be no modern standup comedy
where I would've taken a lot longer to

2472
01:43:07,481 --> 01:43:07,900
develop.

2473
01:43:07,900 --> 01:43:09,440
It's all blacks and Jews.
Yeah.

2474
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:10,420
Right.
It's not comedy.

2475
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:11,740
Yeah.
Woody Allen,

2476
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:13,653
mort,
Saul.

2477
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:15,390
Sure.
It goes on and on,

2478
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:19,660
especially that early golden era,
know that that generation was,

2479
01:43:20,190 --> 01:43:22,690
they would choose dominated for sure.
Yeah.

2480
01:43:22,691 --> 01:43:26,590
It's interesting how many of them were
involved in nightclub performing right

2481
01:43:26,591 --> 01:43:30,550
now.
Isn't it amazing that standup comedy is

2482
01:43:30,551 --> 01:43:33,400
nowhere else really in the world?
It is now.

2483
01:43:33,401 --> 01:43:35,500
Well,
but us just dominates.

2484
01:43:35,501 --> 01:43:37,630
I mean,
most standup comedy right,

2485
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:40,060
is in the United States.
Well I wouldn't say that anymore.

2486
01:43:40,090 --> 01:43:42,630
They're a vibrant,
very vibrant elsewhere.

2487
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:43,690
Melbourne,
Australia.

2488
01:43:43,691 --> 01:43:45,110
And they had a vibrant culture.
Yeah,

2489
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:46,940
I know.
Yeah.

2490
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,741
Well he,
yeah,

2491
01:43:47,741 --> 01:43:48,574
he's,
he's uh,

2492
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:50,380
I think it was from Sydney,
but um,

2493
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:51,920
he might prefer from,
Oh,

2494
01:43:51,921 --> 01:43:52,160
where's

2495
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:54,200
your outside of Sydney.
But outside of English speaking

2496
01:43:54,201 --> 01:43:57,740
countries there is,
it's just not as big.

2497
01:43:57,770 --> 01:43:59,240
Yeah.
Well America is where it started.

2498
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:01,040
That's hard to explain.
Yeah.

2499
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:03,230
I don't know why that is.
Cause we got the fuck away from

2500
01:44:03,231 --> 01:44:05,480
everybody else.
And once we got the fuck away from

2501
01:44:05,481 --> 01:44:08,210
everybody else who started talking shit.
So once we started talking shit,

2502
01:44:08,211 --> 01:44:10,040
well,
they believe that the first modern

2503
01:44:10,041 --> 01:44:12,410
standup comedian was actually Mark
Twain.

2504
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:17,570
Mark Twain used to give these readings
and in these readings they would be very

2505
01:44:17,571 --> 01:44:21,470
humorous and he would essentially be
doing a monologue and it was like a

2506
01:44:21,471 --> 01:44:25,880
standup monologue.
And Mark Twain has some still brilliant,

2507
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:30,320
insightful and resonating quotes that he
wrote hundreds of years ago.

2508
01:44:30,321 --> 01:44:31,154
Right.
What was this?

2509
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,590
What year was Dwayne?
Late 19th century.

2510
01:44:33,610 --> 01:44:34,880
Yeah.
Or a hundred,

2511
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:35,870
I should say.
More.

2512
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:36,950
A little more than a hundred years.
Yeah,

2513
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:38,840
a hundred plus years ago.
Um,

2514
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:42,470
but brilliant,
brilliant stuff that he created back

2515
01:44:42,471 --> 01:44:42,680
then.

2516
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:46,220
And he would go on stage in front of
these people and read these things and

2517
01:44:46,221 --> 01:44:49,220
they would laugh.
And so he became like a humorous

2518
01:44:49,221 --> 01:44:52,640
lecturer.
And that was sort of the beginning of

2519
01:44:52,641 --> 01:44:55,790
standup comedy,
but not Jewish Mark Twain?

2520
01:44:55,850 --> 01:44:56,810
Not at all.
No.

2521
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:58,120
And not black.
Oh.

2522
01:44:58,190 --> 01:45:00,680
Although he was certainly influenced by,
Oh yeah.

2523
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:02,270
I mean,
I think some other people have said that

2524
01:45:02,271 --> 01:45:04,880
the first standups were ex slaves.
Hmm.

2525
01:45:05,900 --> 01:45:07,100
I don't know.
I mean,

2526
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:11,230
and Vaudeville it's hard to,
Vaudeville is happening when Mark

2527
01:45:11,230 --> 01:45:13,850
Twain's going on and there's lots of
comedy going on in Vaudeville and that

2528
01:45:13,851 --> 01:45:17,270
was Jewish and black.
I wonder what kind of speeches they

2529
01:45:17,271 --> 01:45:19,400
would do it.
What kind of jokes they would tell if

2530
01:45:19,401 --> 01:45:20,270
they would do it.
Like,

2531
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:21,850
I think a lot of it was,
um,

2532
01:45:21,870 --> 01:45:24,440
the MCS,
like that's one of the things that Lenny

2533
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:25,700
Bruce,
she's do early in the day.

2534
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:30,830
He was sort of an MC for other acts.
Like you would tell a few jokes and then

2535
01:45:30,831 --> 01:45:34,010
bring up a band and then tell a few
jokes and bring up a dancer.

2536
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:38,330
They had these variety shows,
variety shows were big deal back then.

2537
01:45:38,690 --> 01:45:41,690
And uh,
the MC would often be a standup comedian

2538
01:45:41,691 --> 01:45:45,590
and you'd be armed with jokes.
And it was like the catskills era.

2539
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:50,330
It's one of the weird things is that
they had sort of street jokes and like

2540
01:45:50,331 --> 01:45:52,160
you would have jokes and I would,
you know,

2541
01:45:52,161 --> 01:45:53,810
use kind of the same jokes at you would
do.

2542
01:45:53,811 --> 01:45:56,840
So you would be in one place and that
would be in another place and we might

2543
01:45:56,841 --> 01:45:58,640
be doing the same jokes,
you know?

2544
01:45:58,641 --> 01:46:03,080
And then Lenny Bruce was like the guy
that started talking about life.

2545
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:08,590
Whereas instead of having these jokes,
he was trying to explain why some of the

2546
01:46:09,741 --> 01:46:11,420
parts of our culture didn't make any
sense.

2547
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,760
Why some of the things that we do are
preposterous.

2548
01:46:13,761 --> 01:46:17,900
Why there's these hypocritical aspects
of our society that should be addressed

2549
01:46:17,901 --> 01:46:22,280
and maybe we could live in a better,
more happy world if we kind of looked at

2550
01:46:22,281 --> 01:46:26,000
these more more clearly.
I think he was at first to do that.

2551
01:46:26,001 --> 01:46:30,230
So what we think of a standup comedy is
so broad because there's like Steven

2552
01:46:30,230 --> 01:46:32,090
Wright standup comedy,
which is like joke,

2553
01:46:32,091 --> 01:46:32,924
joke,
joke,

2554
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:35,660
you know a non sequiturs not,
not connected.

2555
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:38,420
And then there's George Carlin,
which is like,

2556
01:46:38,421 --> 01:46:43,220
he would create sort of a new monologue
every year and then he would do that new

2557
01:46:43,220 --> 01:46:45,950
hour on hbo,
throw it away and start all over again

2558
01:46:45,951 --> 01:46:48,950
the next year.
Observational humor is what you're

2559
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:49,770
talking about,
right?

2560
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:53,400
With some ways,
but like Jerry Seinfeld's observational,

2561
01:46:53,401 --> 01:46:57,120
but he doesn't have any like deep
political insight or social inside or

2562
01:46:57,121 --> 01:46:59,670
sexual insight.
Whereas Lenny Bruce would,

2563
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:00,110
yeah.

2564
01:47:00,110 --> 01:47:02,420
It's like he's more restricted in his,
sir,

2565
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:05,850
did you ever known us a deal?
He put a sock in the dryer where that's

2566
01:47:05,851 --> 01:47:07,170
all gone.
It's gone.

2567
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:10,170
Like that kind of shit like that.
That's observational.

2568
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:14,610
There were lenny bruce wasn't the first
political observational comedian though.

2569
01:47:14,611 --> 01:47:16,110
I mean,
woody Allen was doing that stuff in the

2570
01:47:16,111 --> 01:47:18,810
fifties he wasn't radical like Lenny
Bruce,

2571
01:47:18,811 --> 01:47:23,080
lenny bruce was the first radical
popular observational humorist.

2572
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:23,791
I think.
Well,

2573
01:47:23,791 --> 01:47:25,920
the halls credit him as being the
originator.

2574
01:47:26,130 --> 01:47:29,610
I don't know if woody Allen was before
woody allen definitely talking about

2575
01:47:29,611 --> 01:47:32,210
politics in the fifties I would like to
see,

2576
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:34,020
but he was talking about like the
presidential races.

2577
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:37,350
It wasn't talking about daily life.
He wasn't talking about race and the way

2578
01:47:37,351 --> 01:47:41,550
that Lenny Bruce did doing some stuff,
some stuff that wasn't even funny.

2579
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:43,590
Right?
Like one of the things that he did was

2580
01:47:43,591 --> 01:47:46,530
he was talking about how they,
um,

2581
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:51,560
they lied when Jackie Onassis was
jumping out of the limousine after JFK

2582
01:47:52,231 --> 01:47:54,830
got shot or Jackie Kennedy when,
and they were,

2583
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:58,770
they were saying that she was trying to
help him and that she was trying to go

2584
01:47:58,771 --> 01:47:59,250
for help.

2585
01:47:59,250 --> 01:48:00,720
Like she was,
he name was like,

2586
01:48:00,721 --> 01:48:04,080
she was saving her ass.
She was trying to get out of that

2587
01:48:04,081 --> 01:48:06,480
fucking limousine because they shot the
president in the head.

2588
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:09,150
His head exploded and she jumped out of
that Limo.

2589
01:48:09,450 --> 01:48:11,520
And you're lying to people if you say
any differently.

2590
01:48:11,521 --> 01:48:14,180
And it just like this weird moment when
he was onstage.

2591
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:17,640
I've heard the recordings where he's
explaining this like he's,

2592
01:48:17,641 --> 01:48:21,900
he's explaining like you're trying to
sell a false narrative about an

2593
01:48:21,901 --> 01:48:24,750
important historical event and it's
going to fuck with people's heads.

2594
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:27,690
Like of course she's tried to get away.
She was trying to get away because they

2595
01:48:27,691 --> 01:48:29,900
just shot and killed her husband,
you know?

2596
01:48:29,910 --> 01:48:32,490
But that wasn't funny at all.
So there's like some stuff that he was

2597
01:48:32,491 --> 01:48:33,390
doing,
they like,

2598
01:48:33,391 --> 01:48:37,080
he just sort of like,
he had like crossed this boundary,

2599
01:48:37,081 --> 01:48:40,320
this weird,
strange divide into commentary that

2600
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:42,060
mustn't even necessarily funny.

2601
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,520
Yeah.
But he's flipping the script though.

2602
01:48:44,521 --> 01:48:46,530
I mean,
he's turning things upside down even

2603
01:48:46,531 --> 01:48:49,140
when he's not being funny.
Not necessarily towards the end.

2604
01:48:49,141 --> 01:48:51,120
All he was doing was like reporting,
you know,

2605
01:48:51,121 --> 01:48:54,060
towards the end when he was going crazy,
he would just go on stage with his court

2606
01:48:54,061 --> 01:48:57,090
transcripts and just read from his court
transcripts.

2607
01:48:57,091 --> 01:48:58,830
And people are like,
what the fuck is this?

2608
01:48:58,831 --> 01:49:01,020
It's like you watch videos of it.
I've watched them.

2609
01:49:01,210 --> 01:49:06,210
There is so bizarre.
He's going over finite or find details

2610
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:12,080
of his court case wasn't neither last
comedian to be prosecuted for obscenity.

2611
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:15,400
I think Karlyn was,
I think Carl Carlos to prosecute him.

2612
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:16,380
Oh yeah.
Really?

2613
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:18,720
Carla went to jail for obscenity.
Yeah,

2614
01:49:18,721 --> 01:49:20,110
he was arrested.
Yeah,

2615
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:20,760
I'll,
I'll know.

2616
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:25,170
I'll know how much he went through the
court system in regards to it,

2617
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:27,180
but I know for sure he was arrested for
it.

2618
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:31,110
Murders for our freedom.
Great.

2619
01:49:31,111 --> 01:49:32,580
Great Heroes.
Yeah.

2620
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:37,140
Well if it wasn't for those guys
exposing how ridiculous and I mean our

2621
01:49:37,141 --> 01:49:40,410
culture went through this radical shift
right from the fifties,

2622
01:49:40,411 --> 01:49:43,200
the 60s,
sixties to seventies and they tried to

2623
01:49:43,201 --> 01:49:47,770
put a cork on it in the 70s and then
this sweeping psychedelic legislation

2624
01:49:47,771 --> 01:49:48,010
that was

2625
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,180
passed,
uh,

2626
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:52,690
in the 1970 where they,
they fucking made everything's scheduled

2627
01:49:52,691 --> 01:49:55,230
one and they started locking down,
um,

2628
01:49:55,720 --> 01:50:00,310
what you can and can't do that there was
some big giant shifts.

2629
01:50:00,530 --> 01:50:04,720
If you look at the shift in our culture
between 1950 and in 1980,

2630
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:07,390
I mean,
what a crazy fucking 30 years.

2631
01:50:07,870 --> 01:50:11,920
Whereas opposed to you look at like 1980
to today,

2632
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:17,400
not nearly as 85 to 2015.
What you get is more information.

2633
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:19,840
You know,
you get the clothes don't look as

2634
01:50:19,841 --> 01:50:21,490
stupid,
but you know,

2635
01:50:21,491 --> 01:50:24,580
no one's wearing z cavariccis and I
don't know about that.

2636
01:50:24,581 --> 01:50:27,450
I mean I think there's been many
revolutions and you know,

2637
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:30,070
in terms of the culture,
in terms of freedom of speech,

2638
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:32,350
I think we were saying,
we're saying things we didn't say five

2639
01:50:32,351 --> 01:50:34,990
years ago.
Bajan lost 100%.

2640
01:50:35,020 --> 01:50:36,250
You know,
one of the big heroes in this,

2641
01:50:36,251 --> 01:50:39,910
he never gets talked about in this way
as Larry Flynt had it.

2642
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:45,040
He waged many,
many successful court cases on obscenity

2643
01:50:45,610 --> 01:50:48,670
issues and he went all the,
all the way to the Supreme Court and he

2644
01:50:48,671 --> 01:50:51,730
won many of them.
And he really opened up a lot of space

2645
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:55,030
for speech in the media and the,
in his seventies,

2646
01:50:55,031 --> 01:50:56,860
80s and 90s.
That's a very interesting point.

2647
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:57,850
There's no one would,
uh,

2648
01:50:57,910 --> 01:51:02,830
even if they did believe that was true,
they would leave that out because he's a

2649
01:51:02,831 --> 01:51:03,571
pornographer,
right?

2650
01:51:03,571 --> 01:51:04,490
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2651
01:51:04,530 --> 01:51:05,470
Not Funny.
Yeah.

2652
01:51:05,770 --> 01:51:08,140
He wanted me to write the foreword to
his book.

2653
01:51:08,230 --> 01:51:09,063
Did you say?
No,

2654
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:13,720
I did not because of who he was,
but because the book was not a good book

2655
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:16,720
and I did my name associated with it.
It just wasn't not have well done book.

2656
01:51:16,721 --> 01:51:18,640
But what was the book about?
But I had lunch with them.

2657
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:21,280
It was a fascinating experience.
Um,

2658
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:25,720
it's a book about the sex scandals of
presidents.

2659
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:27,190
It's,
it's not interesting.

2660
01:51:27,250 --> 01:51:29,440
It's stuff that's just not very
important.

2661
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:33,880
Sex scandals of presidents,
like sexual secrets of the presidents.

2662
01:51:34,030 --> 01:51:36,820
Wasn't Nixon supposed to be gay?
They were all supposed to be gay.

2663
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,350
Really?
A lot of them.

2664
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:40,240
I mean,
that's a lots and had like a little dog

2665
01:51:40,270 --> 01:51:42,250
and a boyfriend.
They traveled everywhere.

2666
01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:43,750
Never heard of that.
Nixon being gay.

2667
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:44,800
Yeah.
Never heard that.

2668
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:46,420
Yeah.
Somebody wrote a book about it recently.

2669
01:51:46,421 --> 01:51:49,450
Nixon was definitely crazy.
But he was locked.

2670
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:50,313
Yeah.
No,

2671
01:51:50,830 --> 01:51:52,840
he wasn't.
He was an unusual man,

2672
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:56,130
that's for sure.
He was definitely unusual fastener into

2673
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:59,440
strange castering bizarre man.
Did you ever,

2674
01:51:59,441 --> 01:52:02,430
um,
see hunter s Thompson's interview where

2675
01:52:02,431 --> 01:52:06,190
you talked about sharing a limousine
ride with Nixon because Nixon want to

2676
01:52:06,191 --> 01:52:09,610
talk to them about football because he
knew that a hunter was a football

2677
01:52:09,611 --> 01:52:10,960
fanatic.
So he's like,

2678
01:52:10,961 --> 01:52:11,800
he said,
no,

2679
01:52:11,801 --> 01:52:13,780
no,
talk about politics at all deal.

2680
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:14,591
And they said,
okay.

2681
01:52:14,591 --> 01:52:17,440
And they got it and they just talked
about football and Nixon apparently knew

2682
01:52:17,441 --> 01:52:20,200
about first,
second round draft picks and guys from

2683
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:24,310
obscure colleges and Nixon was a
football fanatic and hunter and Nixon

2684
01:52:24,311 --> 01:52:28,990
just shared this limousine ride to the
airport and just talk nothing about

2685
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:31,900
about nothing but,
but football then he definitely wasn't

2686
01:52:31,901 --> 01:52:33,340
gay.
I don't know.

2687
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:36,220
This is when it was just a lot of gay
people that like football.

2688
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:38,830
Um,
but this was when hunter was doing fear

2689
01:52:38,831 --> 01:52:40,990
and loathing on the campaign trail.
And so,

2690
01:52:40,991 --> 01:52:44,110
uh,
I don't think they understood quite the

2691
01:52:44,111 --> 01:52:46,240
extent of how deranged

2692
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:50,420
honner was.
They took a chance with him in the

2693
01:52:50,421 --> 01:52:52,040
fucking limousine with the,
uh,

2694
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:55,070
with the president only in the 70s.
Right.

2695
01:52:55,071 --> 01:52:58,220
Would that happen?
That's a total 70 story.

2696
01:52:58,250 --> 01:52:58,821
Yeah.
Well,

2697
01:52:58,821 --> 01:53:02,120
especially a president like Nixon.
He's,

2698
01:53:02,590 --> 01:53:04,880
he was one of the oddest presidents
ever.

2699
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:06,140
Like,
it's,

2700
01:53:06,140 --> 01:53:08,980
it's hard to think of another man even
remotely like him.

2701
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:10,910
Well,
I'm just thinking about like sort of

2702
01:53:10,911 --> 01:53:13,760
establishment figures mixing with
countercultural people.

2703
01:53:13,990 --> 01:53:15,790
You would never see that now,
right?

2704
01:53:15,890 --> 01:53:19,310
I don't think they kind of knew totally
how counterculture a hunter was.

2705
01:53:19,311 --> 01:53:22,620
Like he would show,
it's one of the things in the Gonzo fear

2706
01:53:22,621 --> 01:53:23,660
and loathing,
um,

2707
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:24,331
um,
the,

2708
01:53:24,331 --> 01:53:24,771
the,
the,

2709
01:53:24,771 --> 01:53:27,200
the life and times of hunter s Thompson,
the,

2710
01:53:27,201 --> 01:53:29,180
uh,
the documentary sort of talked about how

2711
01:53:29,181 --> 01:53:33,110
when he decided to write that book and
he went to,

2712
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:34,120
um,
the,

2713
01:53:34,121 --> 01:53:36,920
the campaign trail,
he was on it for a year and nobody knew

2714
01:53:36,921 --> 01:53:40,400
who he was,
where it's like all the politicians,

2715
01:53:40,401 --> 01:53:42,680
they all knew the other writers from all
these other places.

2716
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:46,580
And Hunter would show up and all these
people wanted to take photos with them.

2717
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:47,660
And they're like,
who is this guy's,

2718
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:48,950
you know,
the astronaut or something like,

2719
01:53:48,951 --> 01:53:50,240
no,
nobody knew who the fuck he was.

2720
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:52,640
And then some,
cause he'd already written fear and

2721
01:53:52,641 --> 01:53:56,390
loathing in Las Vegas and hell's angels
to hugely popular books.

2722
01:53:56,391 --> 01:54:00,350
But these people had no idea.
They just were so outside of that

2723
01:54:00,351 --> 01:54:03,290
cultural loop,
they kind of let this guy in and didn't

2724
01:54:03,291 --> 01:54:05,390
know who he was until it was almost too
late.

2725
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,790
Right.
But can you imagine the Obama

2726
01:54:06,791 --> 01:54:09,410
administration not vetting the shit out
of someone like that?

2727
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:10,540
No.
Yeah.

2728
01:54:10,630 --> 01:54:11,770
No,
I couldn't imagine.

2729
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,180
I mean,
well,

2730
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:14,920
I,
uh,

2731
01:54:14,920 --> 01:54:17,410
you know,
so what he did was he found Mark Marin.

2732
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:20,590
Yes.
And went on that podcast and I,

2733
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:25,570
I tweeted at mark and I said,
what George Carlin say about a standup

2734
01:54:25,571 --> 01:54:30,571
comedian giving a platform,
an uncritical platform to a politician

2735
01:54:31,150 --> 01:54:33,520
or a head of state.
And he blocked me.

2736
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:36,190
He blocked too because of that.
What a pussy.

2737
01:54:36,250 --> 01:54:39,190
But I really,
he blocked you for that question.

2738
01:54:39,191 --> 01:54:40,390
Did.
Wow.

2739
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:42,220
That is insane.
Fine.

2740
01:54:42,221 --> 01:54:42,650
I mean,
I just,

2741
01:54:42,650 --> 01:54:45,430
I,
I would like for him to answer the

2742
01:54:45,431 --> 01:54:48,430
question because it really bothered me
what bothered you.

2743
01:54:48,431 --> 01:54:50,020
But he did that,
that he gave this platform.

2744
01:54:50,230 --> 01:54:51,730
Now,
if he had brought him on and asked him

2745
01:54:51,731 --> 01:54:52,810
hard questions,
fine.

2746
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:53,890
Right.
But he didn't,

2747
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:55,660
it was clearly,
you know,

2748
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:57,900
Obama,
the Obama administration found mirror

2749
01:54:57,901 --> 01:54:59,980
and knew that it would be safe and they
were right.

2750
01:55:00,720 --> 01:55:03,160
Um,
and Marin delivered for them.

2751
01:55:03,161 --> 01:55:06,490
He just gave him softball questions and
didn't challenge him one bit.

2752
01:55:06,491 --> 01:55:08,050
And basically Obama,
I don't know if you listen to it,

2753
01:55:08,051 --> 01:55:10,270
but just basically given like an hour
long speech,

2754
01:55:10,300 --> 01:55:13,540
that's all it was in Marin.
Kind of celebrated him and cheer them

2755
01:55:13,541 --> 01:55:16,060
on.
And I thought this is,

2756
01:55:16,120 --> 01:55:19,270
this is a countercultural and quotes
comedian,

2757
01:55:19,630 --> 01:55:20,620
right?
Doing this.

2758
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,200
That's what countercultural comedians
do.

2759
01:55:23,230 --> 01:55:26,170
I thought that they challenged power.
They asked questions of power.

2760
01:55:26,171 --> 01:55:28,480
They made power absurd.
Like Lenny Bruce did.

2761
01:55:28,481 --> 01:55:31,180
Like George Carlin did.
This is like the opposite to me of what

2762
01:55:31,181 --> 01:55:34,020
standup comedians should do.
I don't necessarily think I would

2763
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:36,520
categorize,
mark has countercultural.

2764
01:55:36,640 --> 01:55:36,981
Well,
no,

2765
01:55:36,981 --> 01:55:38,200
that,
I think he's thought of that way.

2766
01:55:38,830 --> 01:55:41,230
I don't think he is at all.
I think he's absolutely establishment

2767
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:42,910
and conservative in that way,
but he,

2768
01:55:42,911 --> 01:55:44,010
I,
he's considered to

2769
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:47,940
be by many to be sorta countercultural.
I always thought of him as like a guy

2770
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:52,230
who like looks at himself and kind of
mocks himself and mocks but not like,

2771
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:55,320
it's not like,
you know like Doug Stan hope will be

2772
01:55:55,321 --> 01:56:00,120
much more counter culture but also
degenerate drunk.

2773
01:56:00,121 --> 01:56:03,180
And the last person that Obama would sit
down with,

2774
01:56:03,181 --> 01:56:07,200
and if I had them on I would have to ask
him questions about drones.

2775
01:56:07,201 --> 01:56:12,201
I'd ask him what does it feel like to me
too to be a part of a program that has

2776
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:18,090
80 plus percent depending on who you ask
innocent casualty rates.

2777
01:56:18,450 --> 01:56:21,380
Like what is it like to make these
decisions knowing that people are going

2778
01:56:21,381 --> 01:56:23,820
to die.
What is it like when you,

2779
01:56:23,821 --> 01:56:28,821
when you see someone like Edward Snowden
come out against the NSA's spying

2780
01:56:29,791 --> 01:56:34,710
platform and then you realize that on
your own campaign when the hope and

2781
01:56:34,711 --> 01:56:38,250
change website,
you had all these provisions in there to

2782
01:56:38,251 --> 01:56:43,251
protect and and help whistleblowers
whistleblowers who were exposing actual

2783
01:56:43,441 --> 01:56:44,670
laws that are being broken.

2784
01:56:44,910 --> 01:56:47,490
Like what is,
how did you make this change?

2785
01:56:47,491 --> 01:56:49,320
Like what is your thought process behind
that?

2786
01:56:49,321 --> 01:56:50,700
Like,
what do you think about a guy like

2787
01:56:50,701 --> 01:56:52,440
Julian assange?
What do you think about someone like

2788
01:56:52,441 --> 01:56:54,720
Chelsea Manning?
What do you think about someone who

2789
01:56:54,721 --> 01:56:59,640
delivers information to a new source and
that new source exposes things that are

2790
01:56:59,641 --> 01:57:03,240
absolutely crimes that the United States
public hates,

2791
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:05,760
that,
that people don't ever want to think of

2792
01:57:05,761 --> 01:57:09,660
when they think of the American people.
Then they think of this good just um,

2793
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:13,590
leader of democracy in the world.
He don't want to think about those

2794
01:57:13,591 --> 01:57:16,350
things.
And this is why Obama will never be in

2795
01:57:16,351 --> 01:57:17,670
this chair that I'm sitting in right
now.

2796
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:19,350
He might,
he might take a chance.

2797
01:57:19,470 --> 01:57:21,240
You never know.
Just disqualified yourself.

2798
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:23,880
I don't know about that because I think
those are questions that he probably has

2799
01:57:23,881 --> 01:57:26,070
answers to.
I don't think that he doesn't have

2800
01:57:26,071 --> 01:57:27,000
answers to those questions.

2801
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,130
I think those are very,
very complicated subject.

2802
01:57:29,131 --> 01:57:33,240
Do you not want him being challenged in
a freewheeling way for three hours?

2803
01:57:33,330 --> 01:57:34,770
No Way.
That's why they chose Marin.

2804
01:57:35,010 --> 01:57:37,680
We'll also Marin's not live,
he's not live,

2805
01:57:37,681 --> 01:57:40,410
but he also worked for Air America and I
knew what his politics were.

2806
01:57:40,770 --> 01:57:43,440
They knew he wasn't going to challenge a
super liberal the way that you would.

2807
01:57:43,441 --> 01:57:45,150
Yeah.
And he sort of party line liberal,

2808
01:57:45,210 --> 01:57:46,740
right?
Yeah.

2809
01:57:46,741 --> 01:57:47,700
I guess.
Yeah.

2810
01:57:47,701 --> 01:57:48,870
I just thought,
you know,

2811
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:52,200
standup comedians should never be giving
a platform to a politician.

2812
01:57:52,740 --> 01:57:54,750
Hmm.
I'd like to talk to Bernie Sanders.

2813
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:57,840
Jimmy Kimmel did that too.
Had had obama basically made them just

2814
01:57:57,841 --> 01:58:01,500
look cool and hip.
I just really pisses me off.

2815
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:04,020
Did you,
is that this you Ui more or less than

2816
01:58:04,021 --> 01:58:06,600
when Jimmy cried for the lion?
Oh,

2817
01:58:07,030 --> 01:58:08,700
Jimmy,
I didn't know he cried for Cecil the

2818
01:58:08,701 --> 01:58:09,000
lion.

2819
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,190
We did.
He was very upset that the dentist who

2820
01:58:11,191 --> 01:58:14,310
he named on his television show who
legally killed that line,

2821
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:15,710
by the way,
they just made lions.

2822
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:16,573
Um,
they,

2823
01:58:16,620 --> 01:58:19,410
they put them under some endangered
species protection.

2824
01:58:19,590 --> 01:58:21,180
So now nobody has to worry about that
anymore.

2825
01:58:21,181 --> 01:58:23,220
I don't think you're allowed to be an
American.

2826
01:58:23,490 --> 01:58:26,310
I don't think you're allowed to go over
to Africa and kill lions anymore.

2827
01:58:26,340 --> 01:58:29,730
As far as I know.
I think that's the recent provision.

2828
01:58:29,731 --> 01:58:32,970
Americans aren't allowed to kill lions.
I'm pretty sure that's what they've,

2829
01:58:32,971 --> 01:58:35,060
just because there's an ancient scan,
well,

2830
01:58:35,270 --> 01:58:36,650
you certainly can.
Yeah.

2831
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:38,520
Yeah.
And well not just Africans,

2832
01:58:38,521 --> 01:58:40,140
but people from other countries.
That's interesting.

2833
01:58:40,141 --> 01:58:41,860
I don't know how the law works,
but it was a,

2834
01:58:41,861 --> 01:58:42,694
there's a,
um,

2835
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:45,670
look,
I don't think,

2836
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:49,270
uh,
I don't think,

2837
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:56,250
I think certainly that there are animals
in this world that are beautiful and

2838
01:58:56,861 --> 01:58:59,890
she'd be protected and I don't think you
should really kill things that you're

2839
01:58:59,891 --> 01:59:00,724
not going to eat.

2840
01:59:00,790 --> 01:59:04,930
And I don't necessarily understand why
anybody would want to go to a place like

2841
01:59:04,931 --> 01:59:09,640
Africa and kill a lion.
But it's incredibly complicated when you

2842
01:59:09,641 --> 01:59:14,641
look at the reality of what these
hunting camps are in Africa because they

2843
01:59:14,891 --> 01:59:18,070
have taken these animals that were on
the brink of extinction and they've made

2844
01:59:18,071 --> 01:59:20,560
them plentiful.
And the way they've done that is by

2845
01:59:20,561 --> 01:59:22,450
fencing in these enormous,
like,

2846
01:59:22,451 --> 01:59:25,300
you know,
100,000,

2847
01:59:25,301 --> 01:59:29,380
200,000 Acre areas and turn them into
these hunting preserves and they bred

2848
01:59:29,381 --> 01:59:31,150
these animals in there.
It's kind of fucked up.

2849
01:59:31,151 --> 01:59:36,151
It's canned hunting and they have areas
where these lions are free roaming like

2850
01:59:36,791 --> 01:59:41,410
in Zimbabwe where I'm this cecil,
the lion was killed where there's areas

2851
01:59:41,411 --> 01:59:44,410
where they're preserved or they're not
allowed to hunt and then areas where

2852
01:59:44,411 --> 01:59:49,240
they are allowed to hunt and that the
money that goes to these hunts is what

2853
01:59:49,241 --> 01:59:50,550
pays for conservation.

2854
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:53,200
It's super,
it's super conflicted.

2855
01:59:53,201 --> 01:59:55,210
What do hunters need?
They need animals.

2856
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:58,510
They need to conserve animals.
They are naturally necessarily

2857
01:59:58,511 --> 02:00:00,880
conservationists.
I mean in that sense,

2858
02:00:00,900 --> 02:00:02,920
yes,
Sierra club and hundreds organizations

2859
02:00:02,921 --> 02:00:05,020
have worked together on many,
many things for this reason,

2860
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:08,620
but it just seems counter intuitive,
productive.

2861
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:13,540
It seems to me shooting something that
you never planned on eating unless it's

2862
02:00:13,541 --> 02:00:15,640
a danger.
Like there's one thing they have to do,

2863
02:00:15,641 --> 02:00:17,590
like they have to shoot certain amount
of coyotes.

2864
02:00:17,591 --> 02:00:20,470
If they,
if I'm the cattle ranchers have calves,

2865
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:24,670
they have to be very careful because the
coyotes will literally pull the calves

2866
02:00:24,671 --> 02:00:27,940
out of the females as they're giving
birth and kill the calves.

2867
02:00:27,941 --> 02:00:28,750
Like they,
they,

2868
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:32,980
they have to keep them away if they want
to keep a healthy population of cows and

2869
02:00:32,981 --> 02:00:35,740
sheep and a lot of other animals.
That makes sense to me.

2870
02:00:35,740 --> 02:00:39,040
Like you have to,
you have to manage Predator populations,

2871
02:00:39,490 --> 02:00:43,530
but it's not what you're doing when you
fly to Africa to go shoot a lion,

2872
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:45,130
you're just want to put a head on your
wall.

2873
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:46,900
It's something kind of creepy about
that.

2874
02:00:46,901 --> 02:00:49,000
And I think that's why people responded
the way they did.

2875
02:00:49,870 --> 02:00:51,790
Yeah.
I mean I've never had a desire to hunt,

2876
02:00:51,820 --> 02:00:54,910
but I can understand,
I suppose why someone would want to do

2877
02:00:54,911 --> 02:00:55,661
that.
You know,

2878
02:00:55,661 --> 02:00:57,670
it's,
it's a spectacular thing to see at a

2879
02:00:57,671 --> 02:00:59,230
lion's head on your wall.
Right.

2880
02:00:59,231 --> 02:01:00,640
And it's a,
it's quite a trophy.

2881
02:01:01,270 --> 02:01:01,751
Yeah.
I mean,

2882
02:01:01,751 --> 02:01:03,430
I guess so.
I get it.

2883
02:01:03,490 --> 02:01:04,570
Um,
I guess so.

2884
02:01:04,840 --> 02:01:05,860
I,
um,

2885
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:10,780
I could see that someone would want that
or why someone would want that.

2886
02:01:10,870 --> 02:01:12,130
I just don't understand it.
I mean,

2887
02:01:12,131 --> 02:01:14,440
I know you're into eating what you kill.
Yeah.

2888
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:16,480
Um,
but you do understand why,

2889
02:01:16,481 --> 02:01:19,030
I'm sure you understand why people get a
charge out of,

2890
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:19,540
oh yeah.

2891
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:22,760
Shooting a giant deer or large game
animal or,

2892
02:01:22,990 --> 02:01:24,940
yeah.
Well you definitely get a charge out of

2893
02:01:24,941 --> 02:01:27,160
it as well as get the food from it.
There's a,

2894
02:01:27,161 --> 02:01:31,330
there's a,
there's this gigantic experience.

2895
02:01:31,331 --> 02:01:34,840
It's attached to it,
but unless you wanted to eat a lion,

2896
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:38,080
apparently people eat mountain lion and
it tastes good.

2897
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:38,870
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2898
02:01:38,870 --> 02:01:42,770
Mount Line is supposed to be,
I know a guy and he hunts mountain lions

2899
02:01:42,771 --> 02:01:45,890
all winter long.
And in Colorado they do it all legally.

2900
02:01:45,891 --> 02:01:48,380
He's a guide and they love mountain
lion.

2901
02:01:48,381 --> 02:01:51,110
I think it'd be really muscular.
They are not so good.

2902
02:01:51,230 --> 02:01:54,060
But so as a pig,
pigs are really muscular too,

2903
02:01:54,380 --> 02:01:55,071
you know?
Um,

2904
02:01:55,071 --> 02:01:55,970
so as,
uh,

2905
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,520
like elk,
elk are extremely muscular.

2906
02:01:58,910 --> 02:02:01,100
You know,
a deer are very muscular as well,

2907
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:03,140
but it's one of the reasons why they're
so lean,

2908
02:02:03,650 --> 02:02:04,461
you know,
it's,

2909
02:02:04,461 --> 02:02:05,990
um,
there's a lot of,

2910
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:08,720
it's a lot of what they call,
um,

2911
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:14,900
there are certain animals that people,
they just decide that you're not

2912
02:02:14,961 --> 02:02:16,670
supposed to hunt or eat them.

2913
02:02:16,940 --> 02:02:17,930
You know?
Um,

2914
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:21,650
charismatic megafauna is how my friend
Steve Rinella describes some as like

2915
02:02:21,651 --> 02:02:24,560
bears or one of them,
but bears had been eaten by people

2916
02:02:24,561 --> 02:02:27,320
forever.
It's a black bear.

2917
02:02:27,321 --> 02:02:29,930
Especially they're,
they're very delicious and they're,

2918
02:02:29,931 --> 02:02:32,270
they're thought of as game animals for a
long time.

2919
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:34,370
Yeah.
I was just thinking about the selective

2920
02:02:34,371 --> 02:02:35,680
outrage about Cecil,
right.

2921
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:40,370
These lions get poached,
killed all the time in Africa,

2922
02:02:40,371 --> 02:02:42,470
don't they?
I mean by Africans and others.

2923
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:45,080
Right.
But when some privileged white dentist

2924
02:02:45,081 --> 02:02:48,560
from Minnesota does it,
then it's this international outrage.

2925
02:02:48,580 --> 02:02:50,090
Well,
it's also because the line was named,

2926
02:02:50,091 --> 02:02:52,880
which was one of the more hilarious
aspects in the door and turned out he

2927
02:02:52,881 --> 02:02:53,990
wasn't cecil though.
No,

2928
02:02:53,991 --> 02:02:56,060
it was,
he sold his brother Jericho.

2929
02:02:56,270 --> 02:02:58,960
They were worried was killed too because
people had create this narrative that

2930
02:02:58,961 --> 02:03:01,400
Jericho's not going to take care of
Cecil's babies forum,

2931
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:02,960
which is so fucking hilarious.

2932
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:05,600
Cause first of all,
if you don't know anything about lions

2933
02:03:05,601 --> 02:03:08,270
and how they,
how a male becomes the head of a pride,

2934
02:03:08,450 --> 02:03:10,640
they murder all the cubs.
Okay.

2935
02:03:10,641 --> 02:03:13,430
That's a fact.
So if there are females and they're,

2936
02:03:13,431 --> 02:03:15,470
they're giving birth to another male's
babies,

2937
02:03:15,590 --> 02:03:18,050
that line will come in and murder all
those babies.

2938
02:03:18,170 --> 02:03:22,970
So Cecil was a baby murderer,
100% all of the heads of prides,

2939
02:03:23,030 --> 02:03:25,790
those are all baby murders.
So of Jericho came along.

2940
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:28,130
Not only would he not protect Cecil's
babies,

2941
02:03:28,131 --> 02:03:29,810
he would fucking killed him with his
face.

2942
02:03:30,170 --> 02:03:32,840
Okay.
So they were worried that Jericho had

2943
02:03:32,841 --> 02:03:35,090
been killed too.
And there was a story saying that they

2944
02:03:35,091 --> 02:03:39,140
believe Jericho had been poached and
then they said there was a relief

2945
02:03:39,290 --> 02:03:42,770
because it turned out that the line that
was killed was not Jericho,

2946
02:03:42,890 --> 02:03:46,910
but with some other no name bitch ass
line that nobody cared about because

2947
02:03:46,911 --> 02:03:50,740
nobody had made a noise that you
associate with this fucking lying lying

2948
02:03:50,760 --> 02:03:51,620
to be a bitch ass.

2949
02:03:51,650 --> 02:03:52,483
I don't,
yes,

2950
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:56,180
100% if he doesn't have a name.
I Dunno.

2951
02:03:56,270 --> 02:03:58,240
Why aren't you Jericho?
You don't even have an aim.

2952
02:03:58,460 --> 02:04:02,210
Jericho has got a name bitch ass lion.
Well,

2953
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:04,520
um,
I don't even know how we got started on

2954
02:04:04,521 --> 02:04:05,420
this,
but um,

2955
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:07,820
the idea was,
um,

2956
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:10,870
you know,
hunting these things.

2957
02:04:10,871 --> 02:04:14,190
So it was Jimmy Kimmel.
That's what it was crying about it.

2958
02:04:14,820 --> 02:04:16,820
It's just irritating.
I'm not outraged.

2959
02:04:16,821 --> 02:04:21,260
I'm outraged by,
by standup comedians who have some sort

2960
02:04:21,261 --> 02:04:25,000
of veneer of countercultural.
I Dunno,

2961
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:26,990
rebel to them.
This is really,

2962
02:04:27,180 --> 02:04:29,060
I didn't get some platform to the
politician is just,

2963
02:04:29,061 --> 02:04:32,440
I didn't listen to the Obama interview.
He didn't listen to boring.

2964
02:04:32,450 --> 02:04:32,811
It's not,
it's,

2965
02:04:32,811 --> 02:04:35,390
it sounds like a press conference or at
worse,

2966
02:04:35,391 --> 02:04:38,190
it sounds like a speech because there
are no questions that are any,

2967
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:40,860
that are difficult for him.
I'm most offended that Mark Marin

2968
02:04:40,861 --> 02:04:42,720
blocked you for asking a question like
that.

2969
02:04:42,780 --> 02:04:43,710
Yeah.
It was pretty weak.

2970
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:47,220
It was pretty weak.
That's not even insulting.

2971
02:04:47,250 --> 02:04:49,080
Plus he's my neighbor.
Is He really?

2972
02:04:49,081 --> 02:04:50,190
Yeah.
We live in the same neighborhood and

2973
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:51,430
yeah.
Ah,

2974
02:04:51,431 --> 02:04:53,520
see I'm a trader Joe's.
Ah,

2975
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:54,660
does he next,
you know.

2976
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:55,510
Well,
I dunno.

2977
02:04:55,510 --> 02:04:59,160
It does now.
He better guarantee you he's going to be

2978
02:04:59,790 --> 02:05:01,020
getting here.
This will be upset.

2979
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:01,920
Yeah.
Um,

2980
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:05,970
I think for a guy like him,
it's an opportunity to just sit down

2981
02:05:05,971 --> 02:05:09,810
with someone who he thinks you know,
because you follow his politics.

2982
02:05:09,811 --> 02:05:12,960
He's very left wing.
He probably thinks is a great president.

2983
02:05:12,990 --> 02:05:16,080
If you look at what Obama has done,
if you look at the numbers,

2984
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:19,560
what he's done economically as far as
like job creation,

2985
02:05:19,561 --> 02:05:23,730
as far as the rebound of the economy,
I don't understand all that stuff,

2986
02:05:23,731 --> 02:05:25,710
but if you look at,
it all looks fairly positive.

2987
02:05:25,710 --> 02:05:27,870
If you look at the raw numbers,
the raw data,

2988
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:32,250
but he had very little to do with that.
With unemployment going down to 5% I

2989
02:05:32,251 --> 02:05:36,660
mean his policies or the Congress has
policies had very little effect on that.

2990
02:05:37,170 --> 02:05:40,110
What do you think that that was the
economy churning itself?

2991
02:05:40,410 --> 02:05:42,270
You know,
so the economy rebounding,

2992
02:05:42,271 --> 02:05:44,970
like do you mean the most economist I
think would agree with that,

2993
02:05:45,010 --> 02:05:49,170
that the fiscal policies by the
government had negligible effect on

2994
02:05:49,171 --> 02:05:51,970
that.
Most comms believe that exam.

2995
02:05:52,150 --> 02:05:54,010
Yeah.
They would say they are.

2996
02:05:54,030 --> 02:05:58,260
I think very few would give much of
their credit to po to government

2997
02:05:58,410 --> 02:06:00,450
government policies.
What about the bail out?

2998
02:06:00,490 --> 02:06:03,000
Wouldn't that have some sort of a
significant impact?

2999
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:05,310
Yeah,
I mean it was a catastrophe.

3000
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:06,180
I mean it was,
you know,

3001
02:06:06,210 --> 02:06:10,500
trillions to Wall Street and GM and what
did we get for it?

3002
02:06:10,501 --> 02:06:13,140
I mean the,
the recovery didn't happen then it took

3003
02:06:13,141 --> 02:06:14,220
many years after that.

3004
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:17,880
It was not the plan all along was that
it was going to be a sort of a trickle

3005
02:06:17,881 --> 02:06:19,410
down from the,
the,

3006
02:06:19,411 --> 02:06:20,970
the recovery.
Yeah.

3007
02:06:20,971 --> 02:06:23,840
But would we have been better off if
we'd let them fail many of those things.

3008
02:06:23,841 --> 02:06:26,220
So I did it.
Delay,

3009
02:06:26,450 --> 02:06:28,050
delay the recovery,
right.

3010
02:06:28,051 --> 02:06:29,700
You,
you've bail out these failing

3011
02:06:29,701 --> 02:06:32,080
institutions that clearly are not
working well.

3012
02:06:32,081 --> 02:06:33,570
Would you have asked what are you going
to get?

3013
02:06:33,571 --> 02:06:35,610
You're going to get more failing,
right.

3014
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:37,050
You know,
procedures.

3015
02:06:37,130 --> 02:06:39,060
Well,
once something becomes too big to fail,

3016
02:06:39,061 --> 02:06:40,080
that is a weird,
yeah,

3017
02:06:40,081 --> 02:06:41,290
right.
It's a weird state matter.

3018
02:06:41,410 --> 02:06:43,170
Like what does that mean?
I let them fail.

3019
02:06:44,190 --> 02:06:46,080
Let the market work.
Yeah.

3020
02:06:46,090 --> 02:06:49,010
They're worried about all these people
losing all their money had in the banks.

3021
02:06:49,011 --> 02:06:50,240
Just like the say.
That's what happened anyway.

3022
02:06:50,241 --> 02:06:51,990
Isis and the 80s but that's what I'm in
anyway.

3023
02:06:52,100 --> 02:06:53,980
Yeah.
A lot of people certainly did.

3024
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,660
Right.
Yeah.

3025
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:56,910
What would you have asked the president
who was there with you?

3026
02:06:56,940 --> 02:06:58,470
Oh my God.
I mean all the things you asked him.

3027
02:06:58,890 --> 02:07:00,180
Those are great questions,
but yeah.

3028
02:07:00,540 --> 02:07:02,100
You know,
I don't expect,

3029
02:07:02,101 --> 02:07:05,400
you know,
Mark Marin to be a policy wonk in a

3030
02:07:05,401 --> 02:07:07,860
situation like that.
But like you could ask him things like,

3031
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:10,050
how do you feel,
right?

3032
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:12,060
When you pull the trigger in,
you know,

3033
02:07:12,180 --> 02:07:15,270
drone in Yemen that ends up killing a 16
year old.

3034
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:16,380
Right?
How does that feel?

3035
02:07:16,381 --> 02:07:20,550
How do you,
how do you reconcile your past

3036
02:07:20,551 --> 02:07:23,400
experience as a student activist at
Occidental College?

3037
02:07:23,401 --> 02:07:27,510
By the way,
I'm with now being the head of the

3038
02:07:27,511 --> 02:07:29,610
biggest killing machine in world
history,

3039
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:30,510
you know,
how do you,

3040
02:07:30,930 --> 02:07:35,560
how do you,
how do you reconcile your feelings as

3041
02:07:35,561 --> 02:07:40,561
Barry Obama who was protesting against
apartheid in South Africa with being the

3042
02:07:41,111 --> 02:07:44,470
president who murders Brown people in
Africa,

3043
02:07:45,490 --> 02:07:45,850
right?

3044
02:07:45,850 --> 02:07:46,720
I mean,
that's what he's doing.

3045
02:07:46,810 --> 02:07:51,810
So I want to know sort of personally
what in Africa and what are you

3046
02:07:52,061 --> 02:07:52,894
referring to?
There are,

3047
02:07:52,930 --> 02:07:55,720
there are troops on the ground in Africa
doing,

3048
02:07:55,870 --> 02:07:58,300
you know,
murdering people and there's drones in

3049
02:07:58,301 --> 02:08:02,610
North Africa murdering people and in the
Middle East and,

3050
02:08:02,620 --> 02:08:03,850
right.
So that's what he's doing.

3051
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:05,980
And these are all brown people.
He's killing.

3052
02:08:06,190 --> 02:08:07,590
Um,
you know,

3053
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:09,730
how did,
how do you feel about that or off?

3054
02:08:09,790 --> 02:08:11,860
Wouldn't you want to know?
Also,

3055
02:08:12,010 --> 02:08:15,220
I would want to know like what is it
like inside,

3056
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:17,650
like what is,
what's the mechanism?

3057
02:08:17,651 --> 02:08:19,990
Like what's it like once you get into
office?

3058
02:08:20,380 --> 02:08:22,720
Like how,
how different is it than what you

3059
02:08:22,721 --> 02:08:24,820
thought it was when you were running?
So one of them,

3060
02:08:24,821 --> 02:08:26,170
yes,
I would love to get into that.

3061
02:08:26,171 --> 02:08:28,840
And one of the main claims it's made
about him is that he's actually a

3062
02:08:28,841 --> 02:08:31,930
Peacenik who's forced to do these things
by the military industrial

3063
02:08:31,931 --> 02:08:32,530
establishment.

3064
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:33,920
Right.
Uh,

3065
02:08:34,030 --> 02:08:35,290
is that true?
I would ask him,

3066
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:39,700
do you have any agency as president or
are you forced to make these decisions

3067
02:08:39,701 --> 02:08:40,640
by other people?
Right.

3068
02:08:40,740 --> 02:08:42,850
How do the decisions get made when you
know,

3069
02:08:43,360 --> 02:08:46,930
when a drone strike is made?
Is it really you and your advisors

3070
02:08:46,931 --> 02:08:49,840
making that decision or are you forced
to buy this thing called the military

3071
02:08:49,841 --> 02:08:51,280
industrial complex?
Is that true?

3072
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:54,010
Is this true?
What we've been told that the president

3073
02:08:54,011 --> 02:08:56,320
actually has no power over foreign
policy.

3074
02:08:56,321 --> 02:08:57,520
I mean,
I don't think that's true,

3075
02:08:57,521 --> 02:08:59,200
but I'd like to hear him say that.
Right.

3076
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:03,280
And if it is true that he has no power,
then what's the point of having a

3077
02:09:03,281 --> 02:09:06,010
president of,
of getting excited about the first black

3078
02:09:06,011 --> 02:09:08,230
president about getting excited about
any precedent.

3079
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:12,430
If Bernie Sanders gets into office,
will he be doing the same thing then

3080
02:09:12,431 --> 02:09:13,630
that would be hilarious.

3081
02:09:14,020 --> 02:09:17,080
Wouldn't it be amazing if Bernie Sanders
got an office and just start fucking

3082
02:09:17,110 --> 02:09:21,070
full-scale drone attacks,
cutting down a whistle blowers and

3083
02:09:21,370 --> 02:09:25,160
ramped up the NSA spying program?
He probably would because he did it.

3084
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:27,070
What did Obama run on?
Right?

3085
02:09:27,071 --> 02:09:29,950
He ran on,
I'm going to end the war in Iraq.

3086
02:09:30,580 --> 02:09:32,140
Uh,
and I'm going to,

3087
02:09:32,170 --> 02:09:36,370
you know,
be good for civil liberties and right,

3088
02:09:36,371 --> 02:09:39,390
I'm going to roll back all the policies
of the Bush administration was down

3089
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:41,200
Guantanamo Bay,
close down Guantanamo.

3090
02:09:41,201 --> 02:09:42,940
And what did he do?
We actually ramped up all those

3091
02:09:42,941 --> 02:09:45,460
policies,
extended Bush's policies.

3092
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:48,190
Now when you talk to someone like Sam
Harris,

3093
02:09:48,430 --> 02:09:52,720
what he believes is that Obama gets into
office ans then presented with the

3094
02:09:52,721 --> 02:09:57,220
reality of the ongoing situation in the
Middle East with Islamic terrorism,

3095
02:09:57,221 --> 02:10:00,940
with radical fundamentalists and all
across the grow the globe.

3096
02:10:00,941 --> 02:10:04,360
Does it mean to do America harm that
he's presented with this overwhelming

3097
02:10:04,361 --> 02:10:07,720
evidence that the world is way more
fucked than we're being led to believe?

3098
02:10:08,280 --> 02:10:09,610
Yeah.
Well that's them Harris's take.

3099
02:10:09,611 --> 02:10:11,380
I mean,
Sam Harris thinks the world is far more

3100
02:10:11,381 --> 02:10:12,640
dangerous than I do.
I mean,

3101
02:10:12,641 --> 02:10:15,070
he thinks that Islam is inherently
violent,

3102
02:10:15,850 --> 02:10:19,810
is the jihad is a necessary outgrowth of
Islam.

3103
02:10:19,900 --> 02:10:23,350
That if we don't take action,
lethal action against them,

3104
02:10:23,351 --> 02:10:26,710
that they will come and kill us.
So I don't buy that.

3105
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:30,430
I know that that's his analysis.
He necessarily thinks you have to take

3106
02:10:30,431 --> 02:10:32,500
legal action against him.
I think lethal lethal,

3107
02:10:32,501 --> 02:10:33,600
lethal,
legal aside,

3108
02:10:33,610 --> 02:10:35,150
legal,
lethal action against him,

3109
02:10:35,151 --> 02:10:39,860
I think he believes that there is a,
a fundamental flaw in the ideology that

3110
02:10:39,861 --> 02:10:42,740
wants all people who leave the religion
killed.

3111
02:10:43,100 --> 02:10:44,450
And that,
uh,

3112
02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:47,870
that a religion that believes,
well,

3113
02:10:47,871 --> 02:10:52,070
a religion was founded by a warlord.
It's a different style of religion than

3114
02:10:52,071 --> 02:10:55,610
say like Jesus who was a Peacenik.
I don't,

3115
02:10:55,611 --> 02:10:59,270
I don't think he necessarily thinks that
we need to take lethal action against

3116
02:10:59,271 --> 02:10:59,480
them.

3117
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:04,480
I think that he is more concerned about
what they are capable of doing than the

3118
02:11:05,541 --> 02:11:08,000
average person.
So there's no doubt that there are

3119
02:11:08,180 --> 02:11:10,370
Muslims who do you believe that stuff?
Right.

3120
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:15,860
The question is why are they targeting
the French and the United States

3121
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:17,120
specifically?
Right.

3122
02:11:17,121 --> 02:11:21,620
And I think that is because not,
not because of their religion entirely.

3123
02:11:21,621 --> 02:11:26,621
I think it's largely because France and
the United States has intervened in the

3124
02:11:27,050 --> 02:11:31,580
Middle East against Arabs and in France
against their own Arab and Muslim people

3125
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:34,670
in discriminatory,
lethal,

3126
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:39,440
murderous ways for decades.
I think it is blow back.

3127
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:42,230
I think that explains why they attacked
us specifically.

3128
02:11:42,231 --> 02:11:46,610
Now it doesn't explain,
obviously everything those Muslims do in

3129
02:11:46,611 --> 02:11:48,860
the Middle East,
it doesn't explain why they insist on

3130
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:53,870
women wearing burka is it doesn't
explain why they shoot gay people.

3131
02:11:53,871 --> 02:11:56,210
It doesn't explain why they attack other
Muslims.

3132
02:11:56,211 --> 02:11:59,660
But I think it does explain blow back,
I think does explain why they're

3133
02:11:59,690 --> 02:12:02,870
interested in attacking us and that's
what it needs to be addressed in my

3134
02:12:02,871 --> 02:12:03,704
view.

3135
02:12:03,830 --> 02:12:06,080
Right.
Stop giving them a reason to hate us.

3136
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:08,000
Right.
Take that away.

3137
02:12:08,001 --> 02:12:12,470
If they continue to fly planes into our
buildings after we've withdrawn from the

3138
02:12:12,470 --> 02:12:14,390
Middle East,
then we can talk about the religion and

3139
02:12:14,391 --> 02:12:16,370
we can talk about them as criminals.
Psychopaths,

3140
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:18,500
fine,
but that's not the case yet.

3141
02:12:18,590 --> 02:12:21,860
Let's remove that reason from there for
them attacking us,

3142
02:12:22,070 --> 02:12:24,050
then we can,
then we can see what happens.

3143
02:12:24,890 --> 02:12:27,110
Yeah.
Removing troops from the Middle East is

3144
02:12:27,111 --> 02:12:32,111
a real hot subject and I would love to
hear what the president would say about

3145
02:12:32,991 --> 02:12:36,660
the consequences of doing that.
The vacuum created and like what,

3146
02:12:36,661 --> 02:12:39,230
what's going on right now with Isis?
The,

3147
02:12:39,590 --> 02:12:43,370
this vacuum that has been created is now
filled up with the most dangerous

3148
02:12:43,371 --> 02:12:45,740
radical fundamentalist group in recent
memory.

3149
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:47,480
Yeah.
I mean clearly,

3150
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:51,200
I mean the big heavy weaponry that isis
is using is all American made.

3151
02:12:51,350 --> 02:12:54,320
It's weapons that were left by the u s
military in that region.

3152
02:12:54,350 --> 02:12:55,850
Right.
How fucked is up.

3153
02:12:55,880 --> 02:12:57,230
Right.
And what you were saying,

3154
02:12:57,231 --> 02:13:00,230
like they created this vacuum,
this power vacuum in that area.

3155
02:13:00,231 --> 02:13:03,470
Right.
Which these nut bags just easily and

3156
02:13:03,471 --> 02:13:04,700
quickly filled.
Well,

3157
02:13:04,701 --> 02:13:07,220
we're seeing that in Libya as well.
We're seeing that everywhere you get rid

3158
02:13:07,221 --> 02:13:08,180
of a dictator.
Exactly.

3159
02:13:08,240 --> 02:13:12,440
You get rid of the dictator and then
people line up to see who becomes the

3160
02:13:12,440 --> 02:13:13,340
next day.
It's not just getting rid of the

3161
02:13:13,341 --> 02:13:15,170
dictator,
it's getting rid of the government,

3162
02:13:15,171 --> 02:13:16,250
the structure.
Right.

3163
02:13:16,550 --> 02:13:18,020
Um,
there was,

3164
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:20,090
there was nothing to oppose them.
Now I don't think,

3165
02:13:20,091 --> 02:13:22,550
I think isis is going to fall on its own
accord.

3166
02:13:22,551 --> 02:13:24,310
I mean,
I don't think these guys can manage a

3167
02:13:24,311 --> 02:13:27,560
society you've already seeing.
You're seeing evidence of people sort of

3168
02:13:27,561 --> 02:13:30,320
fleeing and leaving,
not because they don't like the

3169
02:13:30,321 --> 02:13:31,154
religion,
they just don't,

3170
02:13:31,170 --> 02:13:32,100
all these rules

3171
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:35,970
that Isis is imposing its sharia law.
Um,

3172
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,240
I can't imagine they could sustain a
society for very long.

3173
02:13:39,270 --> 02:13:41,310
Well,
it should also be pointed out that I

3174
02:13:41,311 --> 02:13:44,820
think something around the neighborhood
of 80 plus percent of the people that

3175
02:13:44,821 --> 02:13:47,820
are fighting against Isis are Muslims.
Of course.

3176
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:48,690
Yeah.
And,

3177
02:13:48,690 --> 02:13:50,670
and almost all of their victims are
Muslim.

3178
02:13:50,730 --> 02:13:51,563
Yeah.
Right.

3179
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:54,330
Yeah.
So let them,

3180
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:56,850
let them hang themselves.
Is My,

3181
02:13:56,970 --> 02:14:01,890
my position pull out entirely?
The U s resident Thaddeus Russell has

3182
02:14:01,891 --> 02:14:02,940
spoken.
There you go.

3183
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:04,590
Are you ready?
You ready to run?

3184
02:14:04,620 --> 02:14:05,221
Uh,
no.

3185
02:14:05,221 --> 02:14:07,470
God.
Now a couple years after you get the

3186
02:14:07,471 --> 02:14:08,520
renegade,
the universities,

3187
02:14:08,521 --> 02:14:11,340
I've been writing city up and running
and be the renegade president except

3188
02:14:11,341 --> 02:14:13,560
that's kind of douchey yet here renegade
president.

3189
02:14:13,590 --> 02:14:15,540
Yeah.
Do you have any aspirations politically?

3190
02:14:15,570 --> 02:14:15,991
No.
God,

3191
02:14:15,991 --> 02:14:17,580
no.
But you think so much about it.

3192
02:14:18,630 --> 02:14:20,100
Um,
I first of all,

3193
02:14:20,101 --> 02:14:23,370
I think I'm,
I think anyone is far more effective

3194
02:14:23,430 --> 02:14:25,410
outside the establishment,
right?

3195
02:14:25,580 --> 02:14:27,540
Um,
I think I can actually get more done and

3196
02:14:27,541 --> 02:14:31,440
change minds and change the culture
which ultimately influencing policies

3197
02:14:31,470 --> 02:14:32,880
simply by talking,
by doing this.

3198
02:14:32,881 --> 02:14:34,080
Right.
I think we all do that.

3199
02:14:34,140 --> 02:14:36,450
I think we are much,
I think you have far more power than a

3200
02:14:36,451 --> 02:14:38,290
congress man does.
Um,

3201
02:14:38,470 --> 02:14:40,110
no doubt about that.
How scary.

3202
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:43,170
Oh yeah.
I mean honestly,

3203
02:14:43,171 --> 02:14:47,250
I mean I think that take legalization of
drugs,

3204
02:14:47,310 --> 02:14:49,260
right?
How fast that's happening now.

3205
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:51,600
I'm not going to give you all the credit
for it,

3206
02:14:51,601 --> 02:14:53,190
but clearly you had something to do with
that.

3207
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:53,880
I mean,
you cha,

3208
02:14:53,880 --> 02:14:56,610
you participated in this massive
cultural shift,

3209
02:14:56,611 --> 02:14:58,530
right?
I mean there were many people doing it,

3210
02:14:58,531 --> 02:15:00,410
but I would say that your voice was one
of the loudest and I'd,

3211
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:04,940
I'd give you quite a bit of credit for
moving it as fast as it has moved is

3212
02:15:04,990 --> 02:15:05,820
that it's ridiculous.

3213
02:15:05,820 --> 02:15:08,090
I don't know if that's really,
but I dunno what,

3214
02:15:08,250 --> 02:15:09,830
well,
I represented very weird.

3215
02:15:09,870 --> 02:15:14,870
I represent the jockish guy who also is
in a psychedelic drugs.

3216
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:19,890
I'm the bridge between the meat heads in
the potheads that's in that,

3217
02:15:19,891 --> 02:15:23,400
in that sense.
So it's got a lot more people that go,

3218
02:15:23,430 --> 02:15:25,680
oh,
I didn't think about it that way when

3219
02:15:25,681 --> 02:15:29,460
they sort of people that wanted those
two groups to be much more clearly

3220
02:15:29,461 --> 02:15:32,130
defined.
And I'm letting them know when it's not.

3221
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:35,790
And there's a lot of benefits,
like especially like martial arts.

3222
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:39,600
Like one thing that I definitely
probably done is turned a lot of people

3223
02:15:39,601 --> 02:15:42,840
that it would never been involved in
martial arts onto martial arts.

3224
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:47,250
And just just by
talking about the benefits of it,

3225
02:15:47,370 --> 02:15:50,220
like praising the benefits of it.
I have seen,

3226
02:15:50,330 --> 02:15:55,020
I know I'm not here to kiss your ass,
but I have seen evidence of your

3227
02:15:55,021 --> 02:15:57,240
influence in the drug policy debate.

3228
02:15:57,480 --> 02:16:00,660
I've seen many people reference it.
I've seen you mentioned,

3229
02:16:00,661 --> 02:16:05,460
I've seen you're a prominent figure
being in favor of legalization.

3230
02:16:05,461 --> 02:16:08,310
That alone changes people's minds.
It's like,

3231
02:16:08,311 --> 02:16:09,031
Oh,
if he,

3232
02:16:09,031 --> 02:16:12,000
if he's for this,
maybe it's not such a crazy idea.

3233
02:16:12,210 --> 02:16:13,620
Right.
I really do.

3234
02:16:13,621 --> 02:16:16,350
I mean you're not the only one.
Of course I think other celebrities have

3235
02:16:16,351 --> 02:16:18,220
come out to,
but like being,

3236
02:16:18,240 --> 02:16:21,360
but you've been very consistent about,
he's really pushed it and I think you've

3237
02:16:21,361 --> 02:16:26,361
also activated your base guys who were
just into martial arts or into smoking

3238
02:16:26,371 --> 02:16:30,160
pot became political about this issue.
I think

3239
02:16:30,550 --> 02:16:34,480
in part because of you,
and I think my point is that you get a

3240
02:16:34,481 --> 02:16:37,240
lot more done actually by changing the
culture and the only way to change the

3241
02:16:37,241 --> 02:16:40,360
culture as being outside of the
establishment,

3242
02:16:40,660 --> 02:16:43,600
right.
Congressman can't lead cultural shifts.

3243
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:44,951
Right?
Right.

3244
02:16:44,951 --> 02:16:47,680
And presidents certainly can't.
They have to sort of follow what the

3245
02:16:47,681 --> 02:16:49,840
culture dictates.
I see what you're saying.

3246
02:16:49,841 --> 02:16:51,550
Right.
We changed the culture.

3247
02:16:51,560 --> 02:16:53,860
Those guys have to do our bidding.
Well,

3248
02:16:53,861 --> 02:16:57,100
that's one of the things that concerns
me the most about the trends that are

3249
02:16:57,101 --> 02:17:00,430
going on in schools today because I
think that if you really do want to

3250
02:17:00,431 --> 02:17:02,830
change the culture,
would you have to change his young

3251
02:17:02,831 --> 02:17:05,260
people.
You have to open the eyes and the minds

3252
02:17:05,261 --> 02:17:09,430
of young people and to all the
possibilities and to the fact that what

3253
02:17:09,431 --> 02:17:13,420
our culture really is is just this
established pattern that we're all

3254
02:17:13,421 --> 02:17:14,254
following.

3255
02:17:14,350 --> 02:17:18,400
That doesn't necessarily suit you,
help you or even make sense,

3256
02:17:18,610 --> 02:17:20,980
but it's a,
it's got momentum behind it and it's a

3257
02:17:20,981 --> 02:17:23,560
habit.
The schools are a dead end.

3258
02:17:23,561 --> 02:17:28,420
I mean
people need to run really like deal with

3259
02:17:28,421 --> 02:17:33,280
this.
This fact most American children are

3260
02:17:33,281 --> 02:17:36,610
trained in schools run by the
government.

3261
02:17:36,910 --> 02:17:39,580
Okay.
What is the government going to train

3262
02:17:39,581 --> 02:17:43,660
those kids to be trained them to be good
American citizens?

3263
02:17:43,930 --> 02:17:46,480
What are they not going to introduce in
those schools as ideas?

3264
02:17:46,540 --> 02:17:48,220
Anything that challenges the
establishment?

3265
02:17:48,280 --> 02:17:51,340
Anything that challenges the status quo
in any significant way,

3266
02:17:51,370 --> 02:17:55,570
right?
People are sort of the cognitive

3267
02:17:55,571 --> 02:17:58,120
dissonance and this,
they don't ever sort of address that

3268
02:17:58,121 --> 02:18:00,100
fact,
which is just there,

3269
02:18:00,130 --> 02:18:01,510
right?
These are government schools.

3270
02:18:01,511 --> 02:18:03,760
What is the government going to do in
schools?

3271
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:07,450
What are they going to train those kids
to do and be and how to think.

3272
02:18:07,510 --> 02:18:08,760
But when you say that,
like who?

3273
02:18:08,761 --> 02:18:13,120
Who's responsible for the curriculum?
The Sacramento in California,

3274
02:18:13,420 --> 02:18:15,310
State Capitol,
legislators,

3275
02:18:16,300 --> 02:18:18,580
politicians,
Democrats and Republicans,

3276
02:18:18,640 --> 02:18:20,290
but and communicators,
right?

3277
02:18:20,470 --> 02:18:21,340
No,
when you,

3278
02:18:21,370 --> 02:18:23,050
when you get a job as a public school
teacher,

3279
02:18:23,051 --> 02:18:26,080
the curriculum is set for you and now
with the common core,

3280
02:18:26,170 --> 02:18:27,700
it's,
it's set nationally.

3281
02:18:27,730 --> 02:18:30,490
It's a national curriculum.
No,

3282
02:18:30,491 --> 02:18:33,240
you don't get a choice.
I mean they sneak in there.

3283
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:35,410
Certainly their ideas.
I have friends who were public high

3284
02:18:35,411 --> 02:18:37,630
school teachers and they sneak in their
ideas of course,

3285
02:18:38,050 --> 02:18:40,960
but they're not supposed to and the
curriculum is handed to them.

3286
02:18:41,680 --> 02:18:44,020
You're given a textbook.
This is what you're going to teach these

3287
02:18:44,021 --> 02:18:46,300
your lesson plans.
These are the topics,

3288
02:18:46,750 --> 02:18:48,490
right?
You're not going to be able to talk

3289
02:18:48,491 --> 02:18:51,070
about Lenny Bruce,
but you should.

3290
02:18:51,190 --> 02:18:53,470
Right.
So you can't have like a creative

3291
02:18:53,560 --> 02:18:56,710
assignment for a class.
You can't like come in and and and say,

3292
02:18:56,711 --> 02:18:59,980
you know what,
my job is to teach history but I want to

3293
02:18:59,981 --> 02:19:03,340
give these people a real perspective
only so much that you can do it on the

3294
02:19:03,341 --> 02:19:04,174
down low.

3295
02:19:04,210 --> 02:19:06,610
Sure.
Teachers Cheat of course,

3296
02:19:06,640 --> 02:19:11,640
but they're not supposed to and you can
get fired for it from I think Lenny

3297
02:19:12,010 --> 02:19:16,180
Bruce and the history of standup comedy.
It should be a central part of any

3298
02:19:16,181 --> 02:19:18,460
education.
I mean I think that is one of the most

3299
02:19:18,461 --> 02:19:23,461
important things in modern US history.
No doubt about that is it mentioned

3300
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:24,880
haver.
Never.

3301
02:19:25,220 --> 02:19:26,890
Certainly not in the official
curriculum.

3302
02:19:27,530 --> 02:19:30,050
Cause those guys said bad words and they
said naughty things.

3303
02:19:31,070 --> 02:19:33,680
So the official curriculum,
what is the goal behind it to do,

3304
02:19:33,681 --> 02:19:35,780
to be the most efficient at educating
kids?

3305
02:19:35,781 --> 02:19:37,880
Or will you try,
you think they're trying to programs.

3306
02:19:37,881 --> 02:19:41,960
So the margin.
So the American public school system was

3307
02:19:41,961 --> 02:19:46,310
modeled after the Prussian system of the
19th century and early American

3308
02:19:46,311 --> 02:19:49,100
educators who founded this thing,
public schools,

3309
02:19:49,101 --> 02:19:54,101
Horace Mann and others said explicitly
this should be a means to train children

3310
02:19:55,311 --> 02:19:56,510
to be workers.

3311
02:19:58,670 --> 02:20:01,220
This was explicit at the time.
It was explicit.

3312
02:20:01,330 --> 02:20:03,140
That's disturbing.
So it's actually,

3313
02:20:03,320 --> 02:20:06,620
if you look at the way schools are
operated and the format of them,

3314
02:20:06,621 --> 02:20:08,030
it's like a factory,
right?

3315
02:20:08,031 --> 02:20:10,910
It's like an assembly line.
They go from this class to that class,

3316
02:20:10,911 --> 02:20:14,060
to that class,
get trained in this and this and this.

3317
02:20:14,650 --> 02:20:17,630
And then they get,
and they leave the doors and they go

3318
02:20:17,660 --> 02:20:22,660
work in a corporation.
That's what it's explicitly designed for

3319
02:20:22,820 --> 02:20:27,820
based on the PRUSSIAN system.
So I mean that's not explicit anymore

3320
02:20:27,891 --> 02:20:30,320
cause I would turn off a lot of people,
but that's what's being done.

3321
02:20:31,070 --> 02:20:33,980
They're not training them.
Why would the government trained them to

3322
02:20:33,981 --> 02:20:38,420
be critical intellectuals?
Why would the government train them to

3323
02:20:38,421 --> 02:20:41,060
think critically about everything?
No,

3324
02:20:42,710 --> 02:20:44,000
they can't.
The government can't.

3325
02:20:44,030 --> 02:20:49,030
The government has to have citizens who
are law abiding and who don't question

3326
02:20:49,791 --> 02:20:51,710
the,
the fundamentals of the society.

3327
02:20:52,730 --> 02:20:57,730
So do you specifically believe that they
set the students up and they set the

3328
02:20:58,041 --> 02:21:01,550
classes up in that manner?
Or do you think they do it because they

3329
02:21:01,551 --> 02:21:05,330
feel like that's the most efficient way
to produce the goals that they want to

3330
02:21:05,331 --> 02:21:07,850
achieve,
which is higher GPA,

3331
02:21:07,851 --> 02:21:08,481
heart,
you know,

3332
02:21:08,481 --> 02:21:11,390
higher sat scores.
We have to compete with China and India.

3333
02:21:11,750 --> 02:21:13,370
Yeah.
So it's all internalized.

3334
02:21:13,371 --> 02:21:16,220
I don't think anybody in the schools is
thinking what I just say,

3335
02:21:16,460 --> 02:21:19,580
you're not thinking [inaudible] well of
course you've got,

3336
02:21:19,581 --> 02:21:21,930
they've got to be good in math and
engineering cause we've got to come,

3337
02:21:22,010 --> 02:21:23,510
you know,
that's how you get a good job and that's

3338
02:21:23,511 --> 02:21:24,590
how you're a good American.
And you know,

3339
02:21:24,591 --> 02:21:29,591
I mean you can talk about Rosa parks now
because she's now safe because we now

3340
02:21:30,561 --> 02:21:32,690
live in an integrated society.
Right.

3341
02:21:32,750 --> 02:21:34,820
But 60 years ago you didn't talk about
her.

3342
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:35,870
She was dangerous.
Right.

3343
02:21:35,871 --> 02:21:38,110
That had to be sort of inserted.
Um,

3344
02:21:39,800 --> 02:21:41,540
but now it doesn't challenge the status
quo.

3345
02:21:41,690 --> 02:21:44,810
It doesn't challenge sort of fundamental
ideas of the society.

3346
02:21:45,050 --> 02:21:48,230
Do you think they really debate
democracy and public schools?

3347
02:21:48,680 --> 02:21:50,360
No.
Should it be debated?

3348
02:21:50,510 --> 02:21:51,810
Of course.
Right.

3349
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:52,673
And this is,
this is,

3350
02:21:52,850 --> 02:21:56,440
this is a major idea here.
Is that the platform to do it in the

3351
02:21:56,441 --> 02:21:57,620
high school?
Do you think,

3352
02:21:57,640 --> 02:22:00,860
why 90 democracy?
I know lots of lots and lots of high

3353
02:22:00,861 --> 02:22:05,000
school students who would love to have
that debate and are not able to in their

3354
02:22:05,001 --> 02:22:07,250
high school.
So what they do is they read books and

3355
02:22:07,251 --> 02:22:11,030
they listen to podcasts instead.
When you talk about the government

3356
02:22:11,031 --> 02:22:14,240
itself isn't the idea of a
representative government kind of an

3357
02:22:14,241 --> 02:22:18,260
archaic thing in terms of it was all
created back when communication was

3358
02:22:18,261 --> 02:22:22,040
incredibly difficult when you wanted a
state representative.

3359
02:22:22,070 --> 02:22:24,770
And one of the reasons for us,
cause like you just,

3360
02:22:24,771 --> 02:22:25,830
you couldn't,
no one

3361
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:28,080
could get ahold of everyone in the
state.

3362
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:31,140
You couldn't all get together and speak
your mind about something.

3363
02:22:31,141 --> 02:22:35,610
But now because of social media and the
Internet as we know it now,

3364
02:22:35,611 --> 02:22:38,040
forget about what the Internet is going
to be like 10 15 years from now,

3365
02:22:38,041 --> 02:22:41,300
which is going to be even more intense.
But you,

3366
02:22:41,301 --> 02:22:45,510
you could express yourself in a way now
that just wasn't available before.

3367
02:22:45,511 --> 02:22:49,830
You don't necessarily need a
representative government and the reason

3368
02:22:49,831 --> 02:22:52,570
why they have to go to these fucking
places like Iowa and,

3369
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:54,330
and,
and campaign there,

3370
02:22:54,331 --> 02:22:58,080
and it's a big part of the campaign
trail is just because of this weird

3371
02:22:58,081 --> 02:23:00,330
fucking setup that they have.
Yeah.

3372
02:23:00,331 --> 02:23:01,470
We'll the electoral college system,

3373
02:23:01,480 --> 02:23:04,630
it's in the primaries to party.
Do opoly Oh yeah.

3374
02:23:04,631 --> 02:23:05,920
It's a mess.
It's disgusting.

3375
02:23:05,950 --> 02:23:07,540
It's basically a monopoly,
right,

3376
02:23:07,541 --> 02:23:09,950
because the two parties differ only
slightly,

3377
02:23:10,030 --> 02:23:13,750
very tiny amounts.
The most exciting thing that happened in

3378
02:23:13,751 --> 02:23:15,790
2008 was not Barack Obama.
To me,

3379
02:23:15,791 --> 02:23:20,650
it was a Ron Paul and Ralph Nader joined
forces with some other third party

3380
02:23:20,651 --> 02:23:25,651
candidates to,
to break down the rules that bar third

3381
02:23:26,021 --> 02:23:28,810
party candidates make it much more
difficult for third party candidates to

3382
02:23:28,811 --> 02:23:30,800
have a viable,
um,

3383
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,890
campaign.
Um,

3384
02:23:33,040 --> 02:23:34,930
that hasn't,
I haven't seen that renewed really in

3385
02:23:34,931 --> 02:23:37,520
any serious way since then.
But that's what has to happen.

3386
02:23:37,610 --> 02:23:39,700
We don't have real choice.
You have to have real choice.

3387
02:23:39,701 --> 02:23:40,930
In Europe,
they have real choice.

3388
02:23:40,931 --> 02:23:43,420
They have parliamentary democracy where
there are many,

3389
02:23:43,421 --> 02:23:46,960
many parties and you have in all sorts
of parties are represented in the

3390
02:23:46,961 --> 02:23:48,220
legislature's.
Right.

3391
02:23:48,250 --> 02:23:50,830
You don't have that here.
And I think that's why we have such low

3392
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:52,540
voter turnout.
Right.

3393
02:23:52,541 --> 02:23:55,300
If there was actual choice,
if you could actually see yourself

3394
02:23:55,301 --> 02:23:57,400
represented among the politicians
running,

3395
02:23:57,700 --> 02:24:00,490
I think many more people would vote.
Yeah.

3396
02:24:00,491 --> 02:24:02,240
I think there's a certain amount of
utility

3397
02:24:02,850 --> 02:24:06,090
people feel when they look at the two
party system and then they see where a

3398
02:24:06,091 --> 02:24:09,590
guy like Barack Obama arguably at least,
uh,

3399
02:24:09,620 --> 02:24:14,620
w with po in returns from like military
policy as as conservative as Gw

3400
02:24:15,720 --> 02:24:17,430
policy,
civil liberties,

3401
02:24:17,730 --> 02:24:18,960
state surveillance,

3402
02:24:19,550 --> 02:24:22,120
whistleblowers.
There's no difference and freedom of

3403
02:24:22,121 --> 02:24:23,350
speech,
freedom of the press,

3404
02:24:23,740 --> 02:24:25,810
the way they've gone after the press

3405
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:29,060
and then education policy.
So this common core that I was talking

3406
02:24:29,061 --> 02:24:30,650
about,
this national curriculum that's now

3407
02:24:30,651 --> 02:24:32,210
being imposed on all the schools.
Right.

3408
02:24:32,510 --> 02:24:34,160
Where did that start?
The Bush administration,

3409
02:24:34,161 --> 02:24:36,830
it was called no child left behind is
this national curriculum,

3410
02:24:36,831 --> 02:24:40,430
this idea of homogenizing the culture,
the neoconservatives.

3411
02:24:40,790 --> 02:24:43,640
They invented that die fucking thing in
the 1960s.

3412
02:24:43,641 --> 02:24:46,010
It was their idea.
Irving Kristol came up with this idea.

3413
02:24:46,011 --> 02:24:48,020
I said,
we need to have a common core to make

3414
02:24:48,021 --> 02:24:53,021
all Americans similar culturally that
became no child left behind in the 19,

3415
02:24:53,571 --> 02:24:54,141
in,
in,

3416
02:24:54,141 --> 02:24:56,060
under the Bush administration and the
two thousands.

3417
02:24:56,360 --> 02:24:58,400
And then what did Obama do?
He just ramped it up.

3418
02:24:58,850 --> 02:25:01,760
He calls it race to the top now gave it
more funding,

3419
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:04,610
uh,
required schools to follow it,

3420
02:25:04,611 --> 02:25:07,310
more stringently punished schools for
not following it.

3421
02:25:07,311 --> 02:25:10,520
Now the common core is this,
this national homogenizing curriculum.

3422
02:25:11,090 --> 02:25:13,580
It's a catastrophe.
I mean,

3423
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:18,760
the idea that a kid in key west Florida
should have the same education as my son

3424
02:25:19,550 --> 02:25:23,590
in Los Angeles or a kid in Mississippi.
Right?

3425
02:25:23,950 --> 02:25:27,400
Why?
Why shouldn't the parents in those areas

3426
02:25:27,401 --> 02:25:30,280
have some say over how their children
are taught?

3427
02:25:30,550 --> 02:25:34,810
Shouldn't there be some diversity of
ideas and cultures in the schools?

3428
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:37,900
Do we all need to have the same common
culture?

3429
02:25:38,920 --> 02:25:39,753
I don't think so.

3430
02:25:40,260 --> 02:25:42,050
Well,
there's also an issue in a,

3431
02:25:42,051 --> 02:25:46,590
in a huge one in the way that teachers
are financially

3432
02:25:48,450 --> 02:25:50,750
compensated for work.
Uh,

3433
02:25:50,850 --> 02:25:55,620
the amount of money that teachers make
is so small and the,

3434
02:25:55,650 --> 02:25:59,910
the what the like the,
with the way we look at teachers,

3435
02:25:59,911 --> 02:26:04,350
we don't look at teachers like if you,
if you thought about someone who is

3436
02:26:04,351 --> 02:26:07,650
educating your child about the ways of
the world influencing them.

3437
02:26:07,860 --> 02:26:11,280
And we all have ideas in our head about
really positive and really negative

3438
02:26:11,281 --> 02:26:13,140
teacher experiences that we had as a
child.

3439
02:26:13,500 --> 02:26:15,450
You know,
I have a few really positive ones that

3440
02:26:15,451 --> 02:26:20,130
to this day I think back about this guy.
Like I had a science teacher in seventh

3441
02:26:20,131 --> 02:26:25,131
grade that for the first time ever
introduced in my mind the idea of

3442
02:26:25,561 --> 02:26:27,390
infinity.
And uh,

3443
02:26:27,391 --> 02:26:30,030
I'd never considered it before and he
was a really unique guy.

3444
02:26:30,031 --> 02:26:30,750
He,
uh,

3445
02:26:30,750 --> 02:26:33,120
would grow his own vegetables and bring
them in and,

3446
02:26:33,290 --> 02:26:34,140
and talk.

3447
02:26:35,310 --> 02:26:38,970
And he's really passionate ways about
what it's like to grow the food that you

3448
02:26:38,971 --> 02:26:40,710
actually eat.
And this is,

3449
02:26:40,890 --> 02:26:42,090
you know,
I was,

3450
02:26:42,150 --> 02:26:43,740
you know,
whenever I was 12 or something,

3451
02:26:43,741 --> 02:26:45,510
what are you and your yeah to seventh
grade.

3452
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:48,390
I was a little kid and I was like,
what the fuck is this guy going on

3453
02:26:48,391 --> 02:26:51,930
about?
He was talking about what it's like to

3454
02:26:51,931 --> 02:26:55,380
have food that you grow,
like do to understand the actual process

3455
02:26:55,381 --> 02:27:00,090
of a seed becoming your food and then to
eat it and it bring it into lunch.

3456
02:27:00,091 --> 02:27:02,290
And you know,
and he was talking about these radishes.

3457
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:04,860
It had grown in his garden that he's
eating right now.

3458
02:27:05,150 --> 02:27:08,280
And,
and then he was trying to explain to us

3459
02:27:08,580 --> 02:27:13,440
that everything in the entire world,
including human beings has essentially

3460
02:27:13,441 --> 02:27:17,280
made out of materials that came from a
star that exploded.

3461
02:27:18,270 --> 02:27:19,590
And then we were like,
what?

3462
02:27:19,950 --> 02:27:23,940
And then he was trying to explain that
our star is going to explode.

3463
02:27:24,270 --> 02:27:26,880
That we all,
there's only a certain amount of time in

3464
02:27:26,881 --> 02:27:29,460
every star and the sun that we,
you know,

3465
02:27:29,461 --> 02:27:32,940
our star w who we call our son only has
a certain amount of time.

3466
02:27:33,480 --> 02:27:35,280
And I remember this guy like saying this
to me,

3467
02:27:35,310 --> 02:27:40,310
and there are an infinite number of
stars in the galaxy as far as we know,

3468
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:42,420
the Gal or the,
the the universe rather,

3469
02:27:42,540 --> 02:27:44,700
as far as we know,
the universe has no end.

3470
02:27:44,970 --> 02:27:47,700
It goes on and on.
So just stop and think about that.

3471
02:27:47,940 --> 02:27:52,200
How much time it would take light,
just light to get to the nearest solar

3472
02:27:52,201 --> 02:27:55,440
system outside of ours.
And then think about that in terms of

3473
02:27:55,441 --> 02:27:59,520
how big the galaxies with hundreds of
billions of stars,

3474
02:27:59,700 --> 02:28:03,870
each one with their own little planets
and then hundreds of billions of

3475
02:28:03,871 --> 02:28:05,820
galaxies.
And I remember leaving that class just

3476
02:28:05,821 --> 02:28:10,260
mind fucked at 12 or 13 years old and it
stuck.

3477
02:28:10,590 --> 02:28:13,380
Like it's stuck with me like for years,
for decades.

3478
02:28:13,620 --> 02:28:16,380
That one teacher,
but that wasn't,

3479
02:28:16,620 --> 02:28:18,090
that was him.
It was,

3480
02:28:18,091 --> 02:28:20,850
his idea is this wasn't,
this wasn't a part of some state

3481
02:28:21,290 --> 02:28:21,980
curriculum that

3482
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:23,990
he had to follow.
And it was a public school,

3483
02:28:23,991 --> 02:28:24,470
right?
Yeah,

3484
02:28:24,470 --> 02:28:25,070
yeah,
yeah.

3485
02:28:25,070 --> 02:28:26,330
So he's the exception,
right?

3486
02:28:26,350 --> 02:28:26,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

3487
02:28:26,900 --> 02:28:29,990
And there's no reason he should exist in
that system.

3488
02:28:30,470 --> 02:28:34,070
Right.
The system has no reason to encourage

3489
02:28:34,071 --> 02:28:37,520
creativity to encourage thinking outside
one's world like that,

3490
02:28:37,521 --> 02:28:38,840
right?
It must,

3491
02:28:38,870 --> 02:28:42,350
it must reinforce itself,
reinvigorate itself,

3492
02:28:42,380 --> 02:28:44,060
right?
The system must sustain itself.

3493
02:28:44,061 --> 02:28:47,210
And it does that by training new
workers,

3494
02:28:47,211 --> 02:28:48,520
new participants,
new citizens,

3495
02:28:48,530 --> 02:28:52,790
we soldiers look at it when,
when they want to justify the core

3496
02:28:52,791 --> 02:28:54,710
system,
how do they,

3497
02:28:54,770 --> 02:28:56,600
how do they promote it?
How do they,

3498
02:28:56,810 --> 02:28:59,000
how do they describe it?
Uh,

3499
02:28:59,030 --> 02:29:04,030
that it will cause the shitty schools in
Mississippi to rise to the level of the

3500
02:29:04,881 --> 02:29:07,400
good schools in Santa Monica and
Manhattan.

3501
02:29:07,850 --> 02:29:10,040
That it standardizes the curriculum.
Right?

3502
02:29:10,041 --> 02:29:13,130
So that the,
the argument is that kids in poor areas

3503
02:29:13,131 --> 02:29:17,210
get worse education and their schools,
the curriculum is not as good as in the

3504
02:29:17,390 --> 02:29:18,150
wealthy area.

3505
02:29:18,150 --> 02:29:21,350
So the standardizes,
it raises them all to the same level.

3506
02:29:22,450 --> 02:29:25,130
Um,
but also very much the argument was

3507
02:29:25,131 --> 02:29:26,090
made,
uh,

3508
02:29:26,091 --> 02:29:28,490
that it,
it helps us compete with India and

3509
02:29:28,491 --> 02:29:31,970
China.
So stem is a big part of this,

3510
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:34,940
right?
So training kids to be better in stem,

3511
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:38,240
um,
is a huge part of the common core.

3512
02:29:38,300 --> 02:29:40,130
Explain stem,
science,

3513
02:29:40,131 --> 02:29:41,900
technology,
engineering and mathematics.

3514
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:42,650
Okay.
Right?

3515
02:29:42,650 --> 02:29:47,030
So if you want to build shit,
if you want to make super conductors and

3516
02:29:47,031 --> 02:29:49,580
computers and technology and all that
stuff that the Chinese and Indians are

3517
02:29:49,581 --> 02:29:51,890
doing and some people in the United
States are doing,

3518
02:29:52,370 --> 02:29:56,630
you have to be good at that.
So that was the argument made by Arnie

3519
02:29:56,630 --> 02:29:58,670
Duncan,
the secretary of education and Obama

3520
02:29:58,730 --> 02:30:02,330
throughout with race to the top,
we have to standardize the teaching of

3521
02:30:02,331 --> 02:30:07,080
stem so that we compete,
can compete with India and China does

3522
02:30:07,190 --> 02:30:08,023
working.

3523
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:10,280
Not really.
What are the results?

3524
02:30:10,330 --> 02:30:10,911
I mean,
well,

3525
02:30:10,911 --> 02:30:12,320
it's just started.
It's just been moved out.

3526
02:30:12,321 --> 02:30:13,730
It's been about a year or two.
Well,

3527
02:30:13,740 --> 02:30:17,000
I have a friend who's got kids in public
school in Manhattan,

3528
02:30:17,001 --> 02:30:19,630
and he was going crazy about it.
Like what the,

3529
02:30:19,631 --> 02:30:21,680
the changes that it's made to their,
uh,

3530
02:30:22,180 --> 02:30:23,350
to what they have to study.
See,

3531
02:30:23,351 --> 02:30:25,280
Kay has been railing about it too.
Yeah.

3532
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:27,260
The whole twitter rant about it.
Yeah.

3533
02:30:27,261 --> 02:30:28,890
His kids are in Manhattan schools,
I think.

3534
02:30:29,340 --> 02:30:30,141
Um,
yeah.

3535
02:30:30,141 --> 02:30:32,000
My son's in Santa Monica schools,
public schools,

3536
02:30:32,001 --> 02:30:33,200
and he's,
he's been dealing with it.

3537
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:35,870
It's not.
So the common core as such is not a

3538
02:30:35,871 --> 02:30:37,760
terrible curriculum.
I don't think it's the worst thing in

3539
02:30:37,761 --> 02:30:39,620
the world.
My argument is that it shouldn't be

3540
02:30:39,621 --> 02:30:40,640
standardized.
Right.

3541
02:30:40,880 --> 02:30:44,720
I think the parents in localities should
have some decision over what is taught

3542
02:30:44,721 --> 02:30:45,630
to their children.
Right.

3543
02:30:46,130 --> 02:30:48,710
And I like cultural diversity.
I like intellectual diversity,

3544
02:30:48,711 --> 02:30:50,330
right?
This destroys that.

3545
02:30:51,290 --> 02:30:53,720
All the kids in the country will think
the same way is the,

3546
02:30:53,750 --> 02:30:57,290
is not that they're actually going to,
but that's what is intended with this

3547
02:30:57,840 --> 02:31:01,010
and it'll certainly push them toward
thinking in the same way.

3548
02:31:01,700 --> 02:31:05,480
It's a standardization of thinking.
It's the worst thing we can do.

3549
02:31:05,900 --> 02:31:08,270
Yeah.
Standardization of thinking.

3550
02:31:08,300 --> 02:31:13,300
Is it the idea of conformity on a mass
scale like that without leaving in any

3551
02:31:13,941 --> 02:31:18,941
room for creativity or any room for
exploring the possibilities of the

3552
02:31:19,471 --> 02:31:20,040
wonders

3553
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:24,210
of the unknown of your future instead of
just trying to create a robot that can

3554
02:31:24,211 --> 02:31:25,500
compete with China?
Yeah,

3555
02:31:25,950 --> 02:31:27,750
that's what it's about.
Race to the top.

3556
02:31:27,751 --> 02:31:31,320
It's the name of it.
Race to the top of the world.

3557
02:31:32,320 --> 02:31:32,941
See,
I just,

3558
02:31:32,941 --> 02:31:34,830
I think the,
one of the coolest trends in this

3559
02:31:34,831 --> 02:31:39,831
country right now is,
is not people that are trying to do

3560
02:31:40,111 --> 02:31:41,790
that,
but rather people that are trying to do

3561
02:31:41,791 --> 02:31:45,060
their own thing.
And that what we're getting out of the

3562
02:31:45,061 --> 02:31:49,470
Internet is we're getting a lot more
small independent businesses where

3563
02:31:49,471 --> 02:31:51,750
people leave their job and say,
Hey,

3564
02:31:51,751 --> 02:31:54,320
I'm going to sell blank.
I'm going to make my own clock.

3565
02:31:54,321 --> 02:31:55,800
So I'm going to do this,
I'm going to do that,

3566
02:31:56,070 --> 02:31:57,720
and I'm going to find something.
I'm passionate.

3567
02:31:57,721 --> 02:31:58,200
And,
and,

3568
02:31:58,200 --> 02:32:01,380
and through the Internet there's a,
an avenue where I can pursue this as a

3569
02:32:01,381 --> 02:32:02,980
career where I,
you know,

3570
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:05,370
dental have to join some gigantic
fucking corporation.

3571
02:32:05,370 --> 02:32:08,340
It'd be a cog in the wheel.
I can do something that I actually

3572
02:32:08,341 --> 02:32:09,174
enjoy.
Right?

3573
02:32:09,330 --> 02:32:13,680
And we're seeing this in like,
there's this trend in restaurants where

3574
02:32:13,681 --> 02:32:18,681
they want like raw wood tables and like
old style lighting and everything's sort

3575
02:32:18,961 --> 02:32:23,610
of rustic with metal and wood.
It's almost like this is longing for

3576
02:32:23,611 --> 02:32:27,570
something that's not homogenized and
pasteurized and mass produced.

3577
02:32:27,930 --> 02:32:30,120
Like we have this longing for things
that are,

3578
02:32:30,121 --> 02:32:32,090
they're crafted.
Like we,

3579
02:32:32,130 --> 02:32:35,100
you keep these seeing these fucking hand
crafted sandwiches.

3580
02:32:35,101 --> 02:32:38,280
What does that even mean?
Like you got robots making your fucking

3581
02:32:38,281 --> 02:32:40,140
sandwiches in some places,
I don't know about,

3582
02:32:40,330 --> 02:32:44,100
but that that term handcrafted cocktails
and handcraft unit,

3583
02:32:44,370 --> 02:32:47,100
that is a,
that that's a common thing that you hear

3584
02:32:47,101 --> 02:32:51,150
over and over again and it kind of
represents this desire that people have

3585
02:32:51,330 --> 02:32:54,300
to get away from this gigantic system of
things.

3586
02:32:54,460 --> 02:32:55,090
Yeah.
That's not,

3587
02:32:55,090 --> 02:32:56,800
that's happening outside of the school
system.

3588
02:32:56,950 --> 02:32:58,870
Yeah.
That's happening outside of mainstream

3589
02:32:58,871 --> 02:33:00,070
politics,
right?

3590
02:33:00,071 --> 02:33:04,120
That's happening just in the real world
that's happening among entrepreneurs

3591
02:33:04,121 --> 02:33:06,940
that's happening in commerce,
that's happening just in the culture

3592
02:33:06,941 --> 02:33:08,890
generally.
That's happening in technology that's

3593
02:33:08,891 --> 02:33:12,130
happening on social media where people
are pursuing happiness,

3594
02:33:12,131 --> 02:33:13,930
spontaneous.
It's run.

3595
02:33:13,960 --> 02:33:17,110
It's driven by individuals and
individual desires.

3596
02:33:17,170 --> 02:33:19,540
Right.
Not by standardization,

3597
02:33:19,541 --> 02:33:23,080
not by had a need to compete as a nation
against another nation.

3598
02:33:23,170 --> 02:33:23,851
Right.
It's an,

3599
02:33:23,851 --> 02:33:25,930
it's a beautiful thing and yeah,
you're right.

3600
02:33:25,931 --> 02:33:29,020
I mean there's much more of that now.
It's a great time to be an entrepreneur.

3601
02:33:29,021 --> 02:33:33,580
It's a great time to do your own thing,
to make a living as I'm trying to do

3602
02:33:33,581 --> 02:33:34,480
myself.
Right.

3603
02:33:34,840 --> 02:33:37,000
Doing what you're passionate about it.
I was going to bring it back to that.

3604
02:33:37,030 --> 02:33:37,360
Yeah.

3605
02:33:37,360 --> 02:33:41,380
So that's,
it's kind of unique in the sense that,

3606
02:33:41,381 --> 02:33:43,780
uh,
I don't know a lot of other professors

3607
02:33:43,781 --> 02:33:46,810
that have decided to try to separate
from the system and create their own

3608
02:33:46,811 --> 02:33:48,100
courses.
I don't know of any.

3609
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:50,740
So you're a fucking rebel.
You're a rebel.

3610
02:33:51,130 --> 02:33:52,960
I haven't heard of any.
It's possible.

3611
02:33:53,190 --> 02:33:55,840
Maybe we should call it that instead.
Rebel university.

3612
02:33:55,841 --> 02:34:00,841
That might be a picture and dudes with
like American flag Bandana.

3613
02:34:01,130 --> 02:34:03,700
Not Good.
That is not the image I want to present.

3614
02:34:04,390 --> 02:34:05,440
Um,
yeah,

3615
02:34:05,441 --> 02:34:06,191
no,
I've been surprised.

3616
02:34:06,191 --> 02:34:08,920
I've been researching and I haven't been
able to find anyone who's done it.

3617
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:09,773
Um,
I mean,

3618
02:34:11,020 --> 02:34:12,370
so there are,
there is ed ex,

3619
02:34:12,371 --> 02:34:13,640
there's Coursera,
there's you,

3620
02:34:13,641 --> 02:34:14,680
udacity.
There's these,

3621
02:34:14,681 --> 02:34:17,140
these,
these big moocs,

3622
02:34:17,170 --> 02:34:17,980
massive online

3623
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:20,800
courses that are basically,
they're just in partnership with

3624
02:34:20,810 --> 02:34:21,641
universities.
Right.

3625
02:34:21,641 --> 02:34:24,820
And so they get professors in as
universities to teach these moocs.

3626
02:34:24,850 --> 02:34:27,160
Right.
But these people already have jobs.

3627
02:34:27,161 --> 02:34:28,390
They have tenure usually.
Right.

3628
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:30,910
So they don't need to go independent
entirely.

3629
02:34:31,480 --> 02:34:32,830
Yeah.
I haven't seen anyone who's gone

3630
02:34:32,831 --> 02:34:34,120
independent entirely.
I mean I,

3631
02:34:34,180 --> 02:34:39,180
I am unusual in that I have a phd and
I've been a professor and I have a book

3632
02:34:41,141 --> 02:34:43,450
that's given me a fairly big public
platform.

3633
02:34:44,380 --> 02:34:45,213
Right.
So Mit,

3634
02:34:45,220 --> 02:34:46,990
they're an aren't a lot of people like
that.

3635
02:34:47,020 --> 02:34:49,840
There are a lot of people with phds and
there are a lot of people with big

3636
02:34:49,841 --> 02:34:50,680
books,
but not,

3637
02:34:50,681 --> 02:34:52,420
there's very few people with both those
things.

3638
02:34:52,450 --> 02:34:53,890
I'm going to say the thing who we're
also,

3639
02:34:53,891 --> 02:34:55,780
adjuncts were not actually tenured.
Right.

3640
02:34:55,781 --> 02:34:59,260
So I'm sorta unique in that position.
I'm going to say the thing that people

3641
02:34:59,261 --> 02:35:00,580
hate me when I say,
okay,

3642
02:35:00,640 --> 02:35:01,990
why don't you start a podcast?

3643
02:35:02,050 --> 02:35:04,150
I am.
See they go,

3644
02:35:04,151 --> 02:35:05,170
Jamie,
I am,

3645
02:35:06,250 --> 02:35:08,500
I only get so mad at me.
Why are you telling everybody to give

3646
02:35:08,501 --> 02:35:11,410
him make it her own fucking podcast?
Cause I think someone's interesting.

3647
02:35:11,411 --> 02:35:13,420
I think they should do a podcast.
I am.

3648
02:35:14,010 --> 02:35:15,040
This is,
I'm announcing this.

3649
02:35:15,070 --> 02:35:16,360
I would like to listen for the first
time.

3650
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:17,313
Cool,
man.

3651
02:35:17,790 --> 02:35:18,191
Yeah,
no,

3652
02:35:18,191 --> 02:35:20,500
I'm going to roll that out this year to
probably say,

3653
02:35:20,501 --> 02:35:23,110
because Jocko sent me a text message
today.

3654
02:35:23,111 --> 02:35:24,870
Jocko willink is,
uh,

3655
02:35:24,900 --> 02:35:29,620
his podcast is live now.
The Jocko podcast just went live on

3656
02:35:29,621 --> 02:35:31,690
itunes,
so they go fuckers.

3657
02:35:31,710 --> 02:35:32,420
Yup.
Yeah.

3658
02:35:32,420 --> 02:35:35,770
Eric Jocko podcast.
Podcasting is exploding.

3659
02:35:35,771 --> 02:35:37,270
It's a beautiful,
beautiful thing.

3660
02:35:37,300 --> 02:35:39,820
Well,
it's the freest form of expression

3661
02:35:39,850 --> 02:35:40,870
available.
Oh my God.

3662
02:35:41,170 --> 02:35:44,770
No one can stop you from just speaking
your mind and making errors and

3663
02:35:44,771 --> 02:35:47,260
corrections and debating things like,
like for instance,

3664
02:35:47,440 --> 02:35:51,160
where in the world other than a podcast,
can you have a half hour discussion on

3665
02:35:51,161 --> 02:35:51,430
the word?

3666
02:35:51,430 --> 02:35:52,263
Crazy.
Yeah,

3667
02:35:52,660 --> 02:35:53,290
I know.
And,

3668
02:35:53,290 --> 02:35:56,050
and half joking the entire time.
I mean,

3669
02:35:56,110 --> 02:36:01,110
it doesn't exist anywhere else.
People don't remember or they don't know

3670
02:36:01,330 --> 02:36:04,780
that.
Not Very long ago there were three TV

3671
02:36:04,781 --> 02:36:05,501
networks.
Oh,

3672
02:36:05,501 --> 02:36:08,650
I remember that shit.
A handful of radio stations and about

3673
02:36:08,651 --> 02:36:12,190
three national newspapers and that was
it.

3674
02:36:12,220 --> 02:36:14,260
That's how I grew up.
And they all said the same thing.

3675
02:36:14,320 --> 02:36:16,420
I remember when Fox came around and
everybody was like,

3676
02:36:16,421 --> 02:36:20,890
what is Rupert Murdoch?
What is Rupert Murdoch as evil as he may

3677
02:36:20,891 --> 02:36:21,940
be?
In some ways.

3678
02:36:21,970 --> 02:36:25,600
He is primarily responsible for breaking
that monopoly and allowing all this

3679
02:36:25,601 --> 02:36:26,980
stuff to happen now.
Right.

3680
02:36:26,981 --> 02:36:28,510
He's,
he's the one who came in and challenged

3681
02:36:28,511 --> 02:36:33,511
the FCC and got that other band and
established Fox and Fox people forget,

3682
02:36:34,120 --> 02:36:35,920
was very,
very edgy when it started.

3683
02:36:36,160 --> 02:36:37,330
It's still is in some ways,
right?

3684
02:36:37,331 --> 02:36:39,460
If you look at,
you look at Fox programming,

3685
02:36:39,461 --> 02:36:42,340
it's actually,
it's far edgier than the other networks.

3686
02:36:42,340 --> 02:36:45,640
Right.
But he had to do that on Fox was always

3687
02:36:45,641 --> 02:36:47,900
thought of as literally as simpsons.
Yes.

3688
02:36:48,020 --> 02:36:49,090
Married with children.
Yeah,

3689
02:36:49,150 --> 02:36:49,811
totally.
Yeah.

3690
02:36:49,811 --> 02:36:52,030
So I mean,
Murdoch gets a lot of credit for that.

3691
02:36:52,060 --> 02:36:53,770
The left will never say that,
but they should.

3692
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:55,001
Well,
yeah,

3693
02:36:55,001 --> 02:36:57,970
I mean,
someone can be evil and still do good.

3694
02:36:57,971 --> 02:36:58,900
Absolutely.
I mean,

3695
02:36:58,901 --> 02:37:01,570
there's a lot of disagree with many of
his politics of course.

3696
02:37:01,900 --> 02:37:04,330
But my God,
he did a wonderful thing for everyone.

3697
02:37:04,690 --> 02:37:07,840
I don't think any of them thought the
Internet was going to be what it is now.

3698
02:37:07,841 --> 02:37:09,610
The things,
nobody saw that comment.

3699
02:37:09,611 --> 02:37:10,990
Now I remember thinking,
Oh,

3700
02:37:11,590 --> 02:37:13,510
I'm never going to buy anything on this
thing.

3701
02:37:13,720 --> 02:37:15,980
Yeah.
I'm maybe I'll read New York Times on

3702
02:37:15,981 --> 02:37:17,870
it,
but I'm not going to actually buy

3703
02:37:17,871 --> 02:37:19,040
anything.
You know what I've read?

3704
02:37:19,041 --> 02:37:23,960
It's a staggering statistic.
39% of everything that's bought online

3705
02:37:23,961 --> 02:37:26,480
is bought through amazon.com yeah,
I know.

3706
02:37:26,630 --> 02:37:27,770
That's awesome.
Amazing.

3707
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:30,910
Remember when Amazon was a failure for
years to make any,

3708
02:37:31,490 --> 02:37:32,720
oh yeah.
There was a joke that it should be

3709
02:37:32,721 --> 02:37:35,360
amazon.org because there was no profit.
Really?

3710
02:37:35,390 --> 02:37:35,871
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

3711
02:37:35,871 --> 02:37:38,150
For years be Zos made not a dime.
I'm pretty sure.

3712
02:37:38,480 --> 02:37:41,210
Pretty sure for years he made no mother
fuckers laughing.

3713
02:37:41,211 --> 02:37:44,240
Now when he was,
when he was only selling books and then

3714
02:37:44,241 --> 02:37:46,730
he started selling whatever toothpaste
and stuff and still it wasn't making

3715
02:37:46,731 --> 02:37:47,211
money,
and then,

3716
02:37:47,211 --> 02:37:52,100
I don't know,
archery products by archery releases and

3717
02:37:52,101 --> 02:37:54,520
arrows.
And did you hear what he's brought heads

3718
02:37:54,640 --> 02:37:55,770
rolling out now?
Well,

3719
02:37:55,790 --> 02:38:00,740
one hour delivery,
you can order something on Amazon and

3720
02:38:00,741 --> 02:38:03,110
get it delivered in an hour.
How is that possible?

3721
02:38:03,140 --> 02:38:04,820
I don't know.
They're going to set up these Amazon

3722
02:38:04,940 --> 02:38:05,990
outlet.
That's what they're doing.

3723
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:07,910
Sprinters,
you got people with wings and their feet

3724
02:38:07,911 --> 02:38:09,350
and then the Amazon buttons.

3725
02:38:09,470 --> 02:38:12,350
You know about the Amazon buttons,
you have these like stick on buttons you

3726
02:38:12,351 --> 02:38:13,580
can put on.
Oh yeah.

3727
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:15,010
And if you need a replacement,
as I said,

3728
02:38:15,080 --> 02:38:17,690
and it just automatically assuming it'll
show up in an hour,

3729
02:38:18,220 --> 02:38:20,690
like laundry detergent,
boom there in an hour.

3730
02:38:20,720 --> 02:38:22,520
Whoa.
That's bizarre.

3731
02:38:22,790 --> 02:38:27,650
But that seems like kind of silly
because unless there's something like

3732
02:38:27,651 --> 02:38:31,580
super critical that you need.
Like if this one item only like

3733
02:38:31,581 --> 02:38:34,280
otherwise you're going to need a bunch
of shell get out of a toothpaste button

3734
02:38:34,281 --> 02:38:36,440
and a fucking toilet paper button.
You know,

3735
02:38:36,540 --> 02:38:38,360
you don't have to have it,
but it sounds,

3736
02:38:38,390 --> 02:38:40,910
it's kind of weird.
Yeah,

3737
02:38:41,450 --> 02:38:42,530
but good.
Yeah.

3738
02:38:42,590 --> 02:38:43,351
Oh No,
listen,

3739
02:38:43,351 --> 02:38:45,740
that's great.
What I don't like about Amazon is what I

3740
02:38:45,741 --> 02:38:47,360
hear about the way their employees are
treated.

3741
02:38:47,450 --> 02:38:49,730
What I don't like about it,
as I hear about the pressure that

3742
02:38:49,731 --> 02:38:52,520
they're under and they have to run from
one spot to the other and deliver these

3743
02:38:52,521 --> 02:38:54,800
things and they're yelled at and you
know,

3744
02:38:54,860 --> 02:38:57,080
yeah,
it's a big high pressure factory.

3745
02:38:57,080 --> 02:38:57,620
I mean,
those are,

3746
02:38:57,620 --> 02:39:00,320
those are terrible places to work and
always have been.

3747
02:39:00,670 --> 02:39:03,020
Right.
But convenience.

3748
02:39:03,021 --> 02:39:06,140
I'm assuming they're better than the
alternatives for those people.

3749
02:39:06,680 --> 02:39:09,590
Otherwise they wouldn't work there.
I saw like sweatshops,

3750
02:39:10,130 --> 02:39:12,110
sweatshops and Vietnam are terrible
places,

3751
02:39:12,111 --> 02:39:14,870
but obviously they're better than the
alternatives for those people that work

3752
02:39:14,871 --> 02:39:16,100
in them.
Otherwise they wouldn't work in them.

3753
02:39:16,101 --> 02:39:17,070
It's true.
I mean it's,

3754
02:39:17,090 --> 02:39:20,060
they have a choice between working in a
sweatshop and being an abject poverty.

3755
02:39:20,810 --> 02:39:22,640
You know,
I'm not saying it's a good thing to work

3756
02:39:22,641 --> 02:39:27,380
in a sweatshop or an Amazon factory,
but I am saying undoubtedly it's better

3757
02:39:27,410 --> 02:39:31,310
than what else there is.
Whatever happened to that company that

3758
02:39:31,311 --> 02:39:36,140
was making phones that were supposed to
be more ethical.

3759
02:39:36,620 --> 02:39:38,260
Um,
what was the idea behind it?

3760
02:39:38,261 --> 02:39:41,480
Fairphone they call themselves a
fairphone but they fucked up and they

3761
02:39:41,481 --> 02:39:43,550
only had like three g and everybody's
like,

3762
02:39:44,600 --> 02:39:46,970
you know,
you can have no slave labor and everyone

3763
02:39:46,971 --> 02:39:50,060
gets paid a fine wage,
but you only get three g fuck you.

3764
02:39:50,270 --> 02:39:52,940
I want four g.
You can feel really good about yourself

3765
02:39:52,941 --> 02:39:54,260
but you won't be able to make a call.
Yeah,

3766
02:39:54,261 --> 02:39:57,530
you won't get any pictures quick,
but they ha there it is.

3767
02:39:57,531 --> 02:39:59,680
Fairphone is it still up?
Fair.

3768
02:39:59,830 --> 02:40:02,390
Fair trade phone fairphone to now
shipping.

3769
02:40:02,580 --> 02:40:05,600
Let's see the statistics and see if it
gets four g lte yet.

3770
02:40:05,810 --> 02:40:10,810
Cause if it doesn't they can fuck off
because it was like it was very limited.

3771
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:16,980
What you're saying is that you preferred
of slaves make your phone.

3772
02:40:17,010 --> 02:40:18,570
No,
that's exactly what you just said.

3773
02:40:18,590 --> 02:40:19,650
I'm,
I'm joking.

3774
02:40:19,920 --> 02:40:23,970
32 gigabytes of internal storage.
You fucking clowns.

3775
02:40:24,420 --> 02:40:25,253
Hey,
getting by.

3776
02:40:27,690 --> 02:40:29,520
How are you getting by with that?
Oh,

3777
02:40:29,521 --> 02:40:31,650
it's a good five inch display.
Gorilla glass.

3778
02:40:31,651 --> 02:40:34,350
I liked that expandable storage.
Micro SD slot,

3779
02:40:34,590 --> 02:40:38,460
but 32 gigabyte internal.
Who's making that thing for them too?

3780
02:40:39,510 --> 02:40:43,560
I hope it's only fat.
Privileged white people who make them

3781
02:40:43,561 --> 02:40:45,630
work the fair at Yale.
At fairphone.

3782
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:48,090
Okay.
I like how they got a black guy with a

3783
02:40:48,091 --> 02:40:49,570
brick phone.
Why?

3784
02:40:50,160 --> 02:40:52,130
What the fuck are you doing?
What is that point?

3785
02:40:52,380 --> 02:40:55,920
Why do you have that guy with a brick?
They get the black eye of brick and he's

3786
02:40:55,921 --> 02:40:57,240
standing in front of us.
Swamped with,

3787
02:40:58,940 --> 02:41:02,400
but why they give me rick from,
from a fucking rap video in the 80s

3788
02:41:03,590 --> 02:41:04,620
bless you.
Have that.

3789
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:06,750
You're supposed to be selling these fair
phones.

3790
02:41:07,050 --> 02:41:09,810
Do they have good cameras too?
Was the camera say Jamie?

3791
02:41:11,630 --> 02:41:12,860
The statistics?

3792
02:41:15,780 --> 02:41:18,540
It doesn't say,
it doesn't say what the cameras out dare

3793
02:41:18,541 --> 02:41:21,000
they.
So I can safely say we're boycotting

3794
02:41:21,001 --> 02:41:21,900
this shit.
Why?

3795
02:41:21,901 --> 02:41:24,450
I just,
I don't know how fair it really is.

3796
02:41:24,451 --> 02:41:25,950
Like where are they getting their
minerals?

3797
02:41:25,980 --> 02:41:30,330
That's what's important because the
minerals fair trade generally is a scam.

3798
02:41:30,450 --> 02:41:31,250
Is it?
Yeah,

3799
02:41:31,250 --> 02:41:32,280
it's not really,
well,

3800
02:41:32,281 --> 02:41:34,170
what does it mean look fair?
Trade coffee.

3801
02:41:35,270 --> 02:41:36,210
Well,
all right,

3802
02:41:36,211 --> 02:41:39,210
here's a perfect example.
My friend owns caveman coffee and

3803
02:41:39,211 --> 02:41:40,800
caveman coffee is the coffee that we
have.

3804
02:41:41,090 --> 02:41:43,980
It is owned by a family in Columbia.
It's a single family,

3805
02:41:43,981 --> 02:41:46,620
single origin farm.
So when you buy it from them,

3806
02:41:46,740 --> 02:41:49,020
you are literally buying from the
farmers.

3807
02:41:49,380 --> 02:41:51,480
So like they,
they get it from the farmers,

3808
02:41:51,481 --> 02:41:55,490
they roast it and they sell it.
They hire all American labor and they

3809
02:41:55,530 --> 02:41:58,380
sell it in America.
So that's like fair trade.

3810
02:41:58,410 --> 02:42:01,140
Okay.
So what's unfair trade and unfair trade

3811
02:42:01,170 --> 02:42:04,230
is those people that live in those
places where they have the nets,

3812
02:42:04,400 --> 02:42:07,110
right,
that make iphones and they have to put

3813
02:42:07,111 --> 02:42:09,690
fucking nets around the building to keep
them from jumping off.

3814
02:42:09,691 --> 02:42:13,680
Like that seems unfair that they have to
live in these dormitories and that they,

3815
02:42:13,860 --> 02:42:17,100
they're so concerned with suicides,
they put nets all around the like

3816
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:20,520
that's,
that's something that you need to fix.

3817
02:42:20,521 --> 02:42:21,354
Right?

3818
02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:25,230
So again,
like what's the alternative?

3819
02:42:25,231 --> 02:42:25,591
I mean,
yeah,

3820
02:42:25,591 --> 02:42:27,510
of course,
but like how is that going to happen?

3821
02:42:27,511 --> 02:42:29,550
Should we sort of impose it from
without,

3822
02:42:29,551 --> 02:42:34,260
should you Americans fix those factories
in China and Vietnam for them?

3823
02:42:34,500 --> 02:42:37,560
Or should the Chinese and Vietnamese
workers work that out?

3824
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:41,070
Well,
Americans probably shouldn't get their

3825
02:42:41,071 --> 02:42:45,330
phones made there if the people that are
making their phones are being paid.

3826
02:42:45,331 --> 02:42:48,480
So then you disempower.
People want to lose their question.

3827
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:51,330
But how'd they get employed in the first
place that American's create this

3828
02:42:51,331 --> 02:42:53,520
problem?
By going over there to the slave labor

3829
02:42:53,521 --> 02:42:56,790
factories and having their phones built
there instead of having a built in Ohio,

3830
02:42:56,820 --> 02:43:00,930
they wouldn't work in those factories if
it wasn't better than the alternative.

3831
02:43:00,960 --> 02:43:03,270
They're making more in those factories,
undoubtedly.

3832
02:43:03,420 --> 02:43:05,490
Otherwise they wouldn't be in there.
I can see that argument.

3833
02:43:05,491 --> 02:43:07,560
They are wood outside those factories.

3834
02:43:07,590 --> 02:43:11,260
But the only reason why they are making
those phones in those factories is

3835
02:43:11,270 --> 02:43:14,350
because they make substantially last
than someone who works in America.

3836
02:43:14,390 --> 02:43:16,090
Yeah.
And if you look at the conditions that

3837
02:43:16,091 --> 02:43:19,090
they live and work under,
their horrific capitalist development

3838
02:43:19,091 --> 02:43:21,440
sucks in a lot of ways.
Right.

3839
02:43:21,490 --> 02:43:23,920
But it's also necessary to get to
something much better.

3840
02:43:23,950 --> 02:43:26,200
Right.
So our ancestors worked in factories

3841
02:43:26,350 --> 02:43:27,490
worse than those.
Right.

3842
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:30,070
But thank God they did.
Because as a society,

3843
02:43:30,071 --> 02:43:33,760
we advanced tremendously because of it.
So in quotes,

3844
02:43:33,910 --> 02:43:34,900
that is,
Russell says,

3845
02:43:34,901 --> 02:43:37,170
slave labor is awesome for the future.
Right?

3846
02:43:38,110 --> 02:43:40,360
I thought you were the one who wanted a
slave made phone.

3847
02:43:40,390 --> 02:43:42,880
Now that
I don't,

3848
02:43:43,030 --> 02:43:45,160
you want an axiom slavery.
I just think that,

3849
02:43:45,161 --> 02:43:47,320
uh,
I would like to fairphone sounds like an

3850
02:43:47,321 --> 02:43:49,090
awesome idea.
It does sound like there was another

3851
02:43:49,091 --> 02:43:51,010
company that had an interesting idea
too.

3852
02:43:51,400 --> 02:43:53,410
Then we're going to switch things out
modularly.

3853
02:43:53,620 --> 02:43:56,980
So like your screen could be switched
out when a new,

3854
02:43:56,981 --> 02:43:59,800
more improved screen came along.
They get switched out.

3855
02:43:59,801 --> 02:44:03,910
Your motherboard switch out on it.
It would be like different parts that it

3856
02:44:03,911 --> 02:44:08,200
was like a segmented sort of a phone.
And the idea being that we're doing is

3857
02:44:08,201 --> 02:44:11,830
incredibly wasteful.
We have this whole unit as a phone and

3858
02:44:11,831 --> 02:44:14,230
then we get a new one every year and a
half,

3859
02:44:14,231 --> 02:44:15,490
two years,
whatever the fuck it is.

3860
02:44:15,730 --> 02:44:17,650
And he throw the old one out and get the
whom new one.

3861
02:44:17,860 --> 02:44:19,570
What they're saying is no,
instead,

3862
02:44:19,571 --> 02:44:21,910
when they come up with new improvements,
like a new and improved camera,

3863
02:44:21,911 --> 02:44:25,630
you should be able to put that camera
section and take the old one out.

3864
02:44:25,631 --> 02:44:26,920
Put a new one in.
It sounds good.

3865
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:27,873
Yeah,
we're not,

3866
02:44:28,510 --> 02:44:30,430
I mean they're all made by slaves,
but who's making either,

3867
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:34,090
um,
what does that,

3868
02:44:34,091 --> 02:44:35,650
is that the,
what's it called?

3869
02:44:35,650 --> 02:44:37,330
Project Arra.
Google.

3870
02:44:37,780 --> 02:44:38,613
Oh,
okay.

3871
02:44:38,830 --> 02:44:40,030
Interesting.
Okay.

3872
02:44:40,810 --> 02:44:42,550
Ara,
project Ara.

3873
02:44:43,630 --> 02:44:45,400
Well,
Google is also got a new interesting

3874
02:44:45,401 --> 02:44:49,240
thing they're doing with their phones.
What's their flagship phone called?

3875
02:44:50,130 --> 02:44:52,660
Nexus with the nexus phones,
they're not,

3876
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:56,560
um,
they're not constrained to a carrier.

3877
02:44:57,040 --> 02:45:01,150
So say if you have a nexus foam,
it'll work on sprint,

3878
02:45:01,180 --> 02:45:04,270
t mobile,
whoever's got the signal and then you

3879
02:45:04,271 --> 02:45:06,520
just pay google,
you pay Google,

3880
02:45:06,521 --> 02:45:10,840
whatever the fee is that they charge and
they make some sort of deals out with

3881
02:45:10,841 --> 02:45:12,730
all the carriers.
Is that good for us?

3882
02:45:12,910 --> 02:45:14,560
It's good for you if you want good
service.

3883
02:45:14,590 --> 02:45:15,460
Oh,
well then that's good.

3884
02:45:15,490 --> 02:45:16,323
Yeah.
And I like it.

3885
02:45:16,570 --> 02:45:17,330
Yeah,
because you're,

3886
02:45:17,330 --> 02:45:18,760
look,
if you're in a place where t mobile

3887
02:45:18,761 --> 02:45:20,620
doesn't work,
but you can get,

3888
02:45:21,070 --> 02:45:23,230
you know,
at and t or verizon or what have you,

3889
02:45:23,530 --> 02:45:25,180
you have a google phone or to work.

3890
02:45:25,200 --> 02:45:26,550
Yeah.
If you have one of those next nexus

3891
02:45:26,551 --> 02:45:29,080
friends,
any institution or organization changed

3892
02:45:29,170 --> 02:45:32,200
human life more dramatically than
google?

3893
02:45:32,280 --> 02:45:33,280
No,
I don't think so.

3894
02:45:33,400 --> 02:45:34,870
No.
They're nuts.

3895
02:45:35,220 --> 02:45:38,650
It's really crazy company for the
better.

3896
02:45:38,860 --> 02:45:39,371
I see.
Crazy.

3897
02:45:39,371 --> 02:45:40,410
In a good way.
I know that ain't good.

3898
02:45:40,420 --> 02:45:41,440
That's a good,
you can do that,

3899
02:45:41,441 --> 02:45:44,500
that's fine.
But I mean nothing is ever advanced

3900
02:45:45,250 --> 02:45:47,980
human existence.
No more,

3901
02:45:48,940 --> 02:45:49,990
uh,
broadly,

3902
02:45:49,991 --> 02:45:54,250
dramatically and swiftly than Google and
almost entirely for the good.

3903
02:45:54,520 --> 02:45:55,680
Yeah.
Almost entirely.

3904
02:45:55,930 --> 02:45:58,120
If you lived in the bay area,
you wouldn't know it,

3905
02:45:58,490 --> 02:45:59,650
right?
Cause they're the devil.

3906
02:46:00,220 --> 02:46:03,220
Well they're the devil because the
people that are being forced out can't

3907
02:46:03,221 --> 02:46:04,900
afford the homes anymore.
And you know,

3908
02:46:04,901 --> 02:46:07,900
I have a friend who was an executive at
Google for a long time and she just left

3909
02:46:07,901 --> 02:46:09,190
recently,
um,

3910
02:46:09,410 --> 02:46:10,010
for another

3911
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:11,900
evil corporation.
But um,

3912
02:46:12,200 --> 02:46:13,280
when,
you know,

3913
02:46:13,281 --> 02:46:16,340
they would tell me how much the houses
in their neighborhood costs.

3914
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:18,770
I was like,
this doesn't make any sense.

3915
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:20,570
They,
there was a house in their neighborhood

3916
02:46:20,571 --> 02:46:23,510
that was $14 million and it was just a
fucking house.

3917
02:46:23,810 --> 02:46:25,760
I mean it was just a house.
It was a house.

3918
02:46:25,800 --> 02:46:29,270
I know is that house is in Nebraska
would cost 200 grand and it didn't make

3919
02:46:29,271 --> 02:46:30,680
any sense.
What are you going to do about it?

3920
02:46:31,070 --> 02:46:31,910
Nothing.
Right.

3921
02:46:32,420 --> 02:46:35,900
I mean that's what happens is so San
Francisco will no longer be a

3922
02:46:35,901 --> 02:46:39,050
countercultural center at all.
Not at all for sure,

3923
02:46:39,080 --> 02:46:41,780
nor Manhattan,
but those people will move.

3924
02:46:41,900 --> 02:46:44,630
But go somewhere else.
Then establish a new portland hub,

3925
02:46:44,690 --> 02:46:46,820
your spot Portland.
We'll actually,

3926
02:46:46,850 --> 02:46:49,490
that's super counter called Portland's
going to become too expensive.

3927
02:46:49,491 --> 02:46:51,230
And then the moved somewhere else.
Eugene.

3928
02:46:51,560 --> 02:46:52,880
Yeah.
Well where I'm going and Salem,

3929
02:46:54,510 --> 02:46:55,460
which is right down the road.

3930
02:46:55,460 --> 02:46:57,320
Yeah.
So I mean it just things move,

3931
02:46:57,321 --> 02:46:58,400
things shift,
you know?

3932
02:46:58,401 --> 02:47:01,700
I mean it's with San Francisco,
always a counter cultural capital.

3933
02:47:01,701 --> 02:47:02,381
No,
of course not.

3934
02:47:02,381 --> 02:47:06,230
It started in the 1960s right?
It's only for about two decades.

3935
02:47:06,231 --> 02:47:10,310
Was it anything important?
Those to San Francisco in New York,

3936
02:47:10,311 --> 02:47:13,010
losing those two,
like I had my friend Judas freelander

3937
02:47:13,011 --> 02:47:16,970
who was in here a couple of weeks ago
and he lives in Manhattan.

3938
02:47:16,971 --> 02:47:18,890
He was talking to me about how much
Manhattan has changed.

3939
02:47:18,891 --> 02:47:20,240
It's all just bankers.
Totally.

3940
02:47:20,450 --> 02:47:21,480
He's like,
it's all what?

3941
02:47:22,210 --> 02:47:26,020
So now the cool people are in Brooklyn
and Queens and Jersey City and you know,

3942
02:47:26,480 --> 02:47:28,940
they move around.
That's not a bad thing necessarily.

3943
02:47:28,941 --> 02:47:29,571
I mean,
why do we,

3944
02:47:29,571 --> 02:47:32,810
why does Manhattan have to be the place
where all the cool shit's happening?

3945
02:47:33,170 --> 02:47:34,730
And it's true.
It's a good way of looking at it,

3946
02:47:34,731 --> 02:47:37,500
but it's always has been.
So for a lot of people in the Stone Age,

3947
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:40,730
as I said,
only for really just our lifetimes.

3948
02:47:41,150 --> 02:47:42,920
That's it.
That's a blip in history.

3949
02:47:43,010 --> 02:47:44,930
That's true.
It's one way of looking at it,

3950
02:47:44,931 --> 02:47:47,210
but it's also the,
I think in a lot of people's eyes,

3951
02:47:47,211 --> 02:47:51,200
especially in Manhattan,
it's being overtaken by the evil side of

3952
02:47:51,201 --> 02:47:54,230
our civilization.
The people that are making money by just

3953
02:47:54,231 --> 02:47:59,231
moving numbers around and fucking with
interest rates and dividends and yeah.

3954
02:47:59,530 --> 02:48:01,760
Well Wall Street is,
no,

3955
02:48:01,761 --> 02:48:04,580
I'm not a fan,
but partly partly because,

3956
02:48:04,610 --> 02:48:05,600
well,
tech,

3957
02:48:05,601 --> 02:48:06,470
I am a huge fan.
Yeah,

3958
02:48:06,471 --> 02:48:08,630
that's what I'm saying.
Google in San Francisco is an entirely

3959
02:48:08,631 --> 02:48:09,560
different story,
right?

3960
02:48:09,590 --> 02:48:11,870
Because pretty much all they're doing is
great things.

3961
02:48:11,900 --> 02:48:14,330
Yeah.
Tech is tech is the bright side of

3962
02:48:14,331 --> 02:48:17,240
prosperity and my eyes,
what's going on in San Francisco,

3963
02:48:17,241 --> 02:48:19,730
although all those people aren't being
pushed out of their neighborhood,

3964
02:48:19,731 --> 02:48:22,490
what you're getting is insane
innovation.

3965
02:48:22,550 --> 02:48:26,510
I mean unbelievably staggering
improvements to the quality of life for

3966
02:48:26,511 --> 02:48:28,100
people that are in,
here's what's missed all the time

3967
02:48:28,101 --> 02:48:30,440
because people talk about inequality all
the time.

3968
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:32,510
Economic inequality.
It's true that there's greater

3969
02:48:32,511 --> 02:48:35,510
inequality now,
but it would no one talks about is that

3970
02:48:35,511 --> 02:48:40,511
the poor live way better than the poor
did 10 2030 50 years ago.

3971
02:48:41,001 --> 02:48:42,740
And that's largely because of
technology,

3972
02:48:42,770 --> 02:48:45,620
right.
There is not a person basically in the

3973
02:48:45,621 --> 02:48:47,330
United States who doesn't own a cell
phone.

3974
02:48:47,630 --> 02:48:49,370
That's ridiculous.
There's more cell phones than there are

3975
02:48:49,371 --> 02:48:50,080
people.
Yeah.

3976
02:48:50,080 --> 02:48:51,780
Sub Saharan Africa that,
yeah.

3977
02:48:51,950 --> 02:48:54,670
Sub Saharan Africa there,
I think it's a majority of people in sub

3978
02:48:54,671 --> 02:48:56,810
Saharan Africa own cell phones now.
Wow.

3979
02:48:56,840 --> 02:48:57,830
Right.
And you know,

3980
02:48:57,860 --> 02:48:59,570
I mean,
that's something that was unimaginable

3981
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:01,880
just 10 or 20 years ago.
Right.

3982
02:49:01,910 --> 02:49:06,050
This incredible magical machine that the
very poor own,

3983
02:49:06,350 --> 02:49:07,380
right.
I mean,

3984
02:49:07,381 --> 02:49:08,160
that's an incredible

3985
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:09,600
advance.
And the way people live,

3986
02:49:10,230 --> 02:49:13,320
huge numbers of poor people live in air
conditioned buildings.

3987
02:49:13,350 --> 02:49:16,140
They didn't in the 1960s and seventies
right.

3988
02:49:16,170 --> 02:49:18,240
They drive,
they own cars or they have access to

3989
02:49:18,241 --> 02:49:19,500
cars.
Most didn't.

3990
02:49:19,501 --> 02:49:22,200
Most poor people didn't until 2030 years
ago.

3991
02:49:23,010 --> 02:49:23,690
Right.
So it's,

3992
02:49:23,690 --> 02:49:25,110
Eh,
we miss this,

3993
02:49:25,140 --> 02:49:27,510
right?
There's this huge advance for everyone.

3994
02:49:27,511 --> 02:49:29,760
Yes,
it's true that the very poor are farther

3995
02:49:29,761 --> 02:49:32,850
from the very rich now,
but if the very poor are living better

3996
02:49:32,851 --> 02:49:37,851
and also by the way,
have much more access to power through

3997
02:49:38,520 --> 02:49:40,440
social media,
through the Internet,

3998
02:49:40,530 --> 02:49:42,210
through technology.
Right.

3999
02:49:42,420 --> 02:49:45,600
Then ever before you can be poor and
have a public voice now.

4000
02:49:46,500 --> 02:49:48,840
Right.
You can certainly be middle class and

4001
02:49:48,841 --> 02:49:52,140
have a large public voice that wasn't
possible before when there was three

4002
02:49:52,141 --> 02:49:52,974
networks

4003
02:49:53,230 --> 02:49:57,700
and this kind of balanced perspective
will be available to you at renegade

4004
02:49:57,701 --> 02:50:02,410
