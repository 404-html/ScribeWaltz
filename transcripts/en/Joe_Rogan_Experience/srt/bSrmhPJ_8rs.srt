1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:05,660
I got a story that I don't want to
tell because in front of my girlfriend,

3
00:00:05,661 --> 00:00:06,900
because it will upset because a,

4
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:09,230
I would make my life a bit harder
and I don't want to tell it on,

5
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:10,700
on any tonight shows or anything.

6
00:00:10,701 --> 00:00:11,280
So I'll tell her here.

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,730
But I just did a Zombie
movie in Australia,

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,320
which isn't anything to do with the story,

9
00:00:15,321 --> 00:00:16,250
but they're always in Australia.

10
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,541
And so,

11
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:17,751
I mean,

12
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:18,171
it's dry.

13
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:22,190
And my parents drive to Canberra where
we were at on the weekend to spend a day

14
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:22,491
with me.

15
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:23,031
It's fair enough.

16
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:24,560
I don't see my parents and
in six months or something,

17
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:26,690
so I'm spending time with my mom and dad.

18
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,840
Now back in the early nineties my father
was getting closer to retirement and

19
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:35,870
then he found a credit card bill because
my mother took care of the money fan at

20
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:35,991
that.

21
00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:39,560
She'd run up $90,000 worth of bills,

22
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:42,770
which made my dad had to work an extra
sort of eight years past retirement to

23
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:44,720
pay these all often
she'd kept it all secret.

24
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,583
All right.

25
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,420
So now my parents who've
got to retirement,

26
00:00:47,421 --> 00:00:50,450
they own the house and they just get a
pension of like Australian government

27
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:53,060
gives each person like
$300 a week pension,

28
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,520
which is like two 60 American,

29
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,413
right?

30
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,340
So my parents live off that and then,

31
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,500
but my father takes care of all the money.

32
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:03,620
He pays all the bills and he bounced books
cause my mom can't be trusted when it

33
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:04,454
comes to shopping.

34
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,810
And so I'm talking to my parents,

35
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:06,350
my mom goes,

36
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,080
all I want is my half of the money,

37
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,400
his half of the money and then we'll see.

38
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,650
He can have his half of the money,

39
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,680
it will split the bills and then I
can do what I want with my money.

40
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,950
But instead I'm given an allowance
because I'm not responsible enough money.

41
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:19,191
I said,

42
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:19,371
mom,

43
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,230
you can't take care of the money ma'am.

44
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,330
You can't because you'll fuck it up.

45
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,220
You'll go online,

46
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,710
you've,

47
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,930
you've found Internet shopping
now you'll fuck it up,

48
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:27,411
you'll get rid of,

49
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:28,670
you'll lose everything
and get more credit.

50
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,660
Cards will be terrible.

51
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,800
And she goes,

52
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,560
Oh,

53
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,620
I'm not the problem with money anymore.

54
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,560
Your father's the one
that spends all the money.

55
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,710
Now we're in a public bar,

56
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:37,221
by the way.

57
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:38,990
There's many people sitting around us.

58
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:39,830
It's a very public,

59
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:40,664
open area.

60
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,020
Your father's the one who spends all
the money now and then she pointed,

61
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:44,690
my dad goes,

62
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,380
tell him,

63
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,670
tell him what you spend your money on.

64
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:48,650
And I've already clicked what
this white be and I've gone,

65
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,280
oh no,

66
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,550
wait,

67
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,210
look,

68
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,043
I don't want to know.

69
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,890
I don't want to know.

70
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:52,561
And then what my,

71
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:53,180
there goes.

72
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,770
Your father gets prostitutes,

73
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,233
right?

74
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,853
And I've gone,

75
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,360
oh,

76
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,650
just shut up both of your
police and she's gone.

77
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,610
Yeah.

78
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,320
Every Wednesday your father,

79
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:08,810
before he goes to play
lawn bowls goes off.

80
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,400
It gets himself a prostitute.

81
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,140
And then my dad went,

82
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,820
not every Wednesday,

83
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,703
not

84
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,100
every Wednesday may seem,

85
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,470
sounds like at least three
out of four Wednesdays.

86
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:25,220
It takes a week.

87
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,450
Cough every now and again,

88
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,650
like it costs,

89
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,410
you mean Australian money
for a very cheap prostitute.

90
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,230
It's legal in Australia in a brothel,

91
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,960
maybe a hundred bucks for a pretty low
end sort of girl or Robin tag power.

92
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,660
So he went to a place to get it done.

93
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:39,220
He didn't?

94
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,441
No,

95
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:39,560
no,

96
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:39,711
no.

97
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:42,560
It's not like here where you've got to
go to a hotel and that type of stuff.

98
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,120
They just brothels in there.

99
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:46,670
They're very league and they've
very well sign posted and stuff.

100
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:47,360
It's not,

101
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,580
it's not such a big deal in Australia.

102
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:53,090
It's actually makes it a bit safer,

103
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:53,541
if anything,

104
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,900
because the girls have to get tested.

105
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:56,660
They have to bring their
results in all the time,

106
00:02:56,661 --> 00:02:57,510
and they're paying tax.

107
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,430
He makes it safer.

108
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,620
It's like else.

109
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,990
As soon as the government
says it can't be a legal,

110
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:04,150
when it's something that
people really enjoy doing,

111
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,100
low is doesn't work substantially,

112
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:06,963
of course does.

113
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,051
Sure it does.

114
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:08,884
Yeah.

115
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,750
I don't begrudge my dad for doing this.

116
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:11,970
I just don't want to hear about it.

117
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,890
They're in their seventies
my mom's morbidly obese.

118
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,180
My Dad's still quite fit.

119
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:16,571
Of course.

120
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,400
He wants to get his ender way sometimes.

121
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,340
Okay.
