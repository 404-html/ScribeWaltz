1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,810
Drive by day Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:04,651
So,

3
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:05,550
so let's back up.

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,530
I made a note here on
that Jon Jones thing.

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,190
Did you follow the whole Johnstones
drama and the most recent one?

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,390
The only post drama?

7
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:12,670
Yeah.

8
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,060
Was that he had a press
conference the next day.

9
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:15,900
Did,

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,640
did you follow that
press conference at all?

11
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,410
I saw the crying pictures.

12
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:19,720
Okay.

13
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,553
Jamie sent them to me.

14
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,300
All right.

15
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,740
I went to that press conference and there
was a couple of takeaways and this is

16
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:26,700
all speculative,

17
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,550
but for this doesn't make
John innocent at all.

18
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:29,881
Well,

19
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:30,481
John's guilty.

20
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:30,930
They've got,

21
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,691
they've got the sample.

22
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:32,041
It's guilty,

23
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,020
but his actions were not
that of a guilty man.

24
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,110
Historically guilty guys go
bury their head in the sand.

25
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,310
They try to outrun this thing.

26
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:39,330
They get with their legal teams.

27
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:40,141
They show up at the hearing.

28
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:41,070
They hope for the worst,

29
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,090
for the best.

30
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,350
They get the worst than they deal with it.

31
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,210
John faced the music 12 hours later he
came through the hotel his whole life

32
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:48,931
pulling apart.

33
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:50,760
Right now I imagine he
didn't even sleep that night.

34
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:52,200
He comes to the hotel with the fans.

35
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,180
He comes into the media PR one oh one
says you read a script that was written

36
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,190
for you and you exit the stage.

37
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,260
Instead he read no script.

38
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:05,070
He took every question asked of him and
that's just not what a guilty guy does.

39
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,810
Not understand that he's
guilty in terms of Lusaka,

40
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,830
but what we care about his intent was he
trying to get over on somebody who was

41
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,280
he trying to hide something?

42
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:16,080
His actions would
represent that he did it,

43
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:17,640
but here was the problem
with the press conference.

44
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:18,474
Joe,

45
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,800
when you hold a press conference,

46
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,940
you have,

47
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,230
you have one goal in mind,

48
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:25,410
which is to win over the media and that
they say nice things about you before

49
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:27,480
you do go home and bury
your head in the sand.

50
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,313
Secondly,

51
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,820
you want to break something.

52
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,430
You want to get something out
there to get ahead of the story.

53
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:34,290
That's the whole reason you
show up at these things.

54
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,090
The only car that he had to play
is what did you test positive for?

55
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,350
That was the only thing we didn't know
and they refuse to reveal it so that,

56
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,050
that was a little bit weird
and where I was sitting,

57
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,070
cause I've been at John Spot and here
was the thing that happened with me.

58
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:50,960
We're,

59
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,930
we're talking about John,

60
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:56,910
this whole thing's going on with John
based on a test that took place on June

61
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,640
16th the reason that was relevant
when I went through my thing,

62
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,840
I was,

63
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,970
he tested positive for
semesters in blockers.

64
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,220
Those don't really have
anything to do with anything.

65
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:05,900
They don't help you.

66
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,870
They're silly.

67
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,570
I think you might've
just revealed something.

68
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:10,020
Yeah,

69
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,030
he tested positive for two estrogen,

70
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,920
but you just no one else knew that.

71
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,521
There you go.

72
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:18,180
I'm revealing it broke
personal information.

73
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,380
That's what we're doing here though.

74
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:19,680
Right?

75
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:19,950
Wow.

76
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,610
But this is like,

77
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,700
this is like the only way that anybody
could find that out is if you talked

78
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:24,534
about it.

79
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,470
Boom.

80
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,131
It's out there.

81
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:26,311
Right.

82
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,240
And that we're doing here,

83
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:28,290
aren't we creating some news?

84
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,090
That's a big news day.

85
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:30,721
But listen,

86
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:31,620
but here's the relevance.

87
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,480
And let me tie myself into this.

88
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:34,560
When I went through this job,

89
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,240
I had something silly in there.

90
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:36,511
In fact,

91
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:37,440
I had an estrogen blocker.

92
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:40,650
I just something silly in there
and everybody for gay I was,

93
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,850
I was going to be suspended,

94
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:42,684
but fox,

95
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,500
I was fine.

96
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,370
Everybody looked at it,

97
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:44,641
okay,

98
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:46,800
well you know we changed the rules
and the Tesla and everything was fine,

99
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:47,880
but what I had to live with,

100
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,870
what only I knew there was
another test out there,

101
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,680
but the results hadn't come back yet and
I didn't know what that test was going

102
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:55,891
to show.

103
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:57,320
I know what it could have shown.

104
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,740
I knew what it should have shown,

105
00:02:58,741 --> 00:02:59,980
but I what the other test could

106
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,910
have been should have as well.

107
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:03,970
So you're sitting there hoping
how good is this damn test?

108
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,020
That's all you're thinking about.

109
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,231
Well,

110
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:05,441
we,

111
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,850
you and I had a conversation.

112
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,630
You're the guy called you were
on stage and I'm blowing you up.

113
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:10,871
You're like,

114
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:11,231
hey man,

115
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,100
I'm doing a show.

116
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:12,821
Can I call you tomorrow?

117
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,654
I go to night.

118
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,120
I will stay at capital letters to night.

119
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,650
I need to hear from you tonight.

120
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,930
I remember the exact words he said,

121
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:20,350
well,

122
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:20,681
you know,

123
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:24,460
we were wondering how
stringent these new tests are.

124
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,010
Turns out they're really good.

125
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,160
Turns out it's a pretty good test.

126
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,310
Turns out it's not like the old a one
800 requests a test that costs $99 okay?

127
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:35,920
There's a reason this caught
this test is 40 plus grand.

128
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,683
But the thing that I'm,

129
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,800
I'm wondering,

130
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,110
does John have another test out there?

131
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:42,760
If he does it doesn't mean
it's going to come back,

132
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,980
but that was the same spot I was in.

133
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,810
There was a shoe that could drop for me.

134
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:47,441
It did for him.

135
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:48,400
Is there another test out there?

136
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,061
And if there's not,

137
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,530
then who saw has got
some explaining to do?

138
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,760
If you're telling me a guy that's got
a track record that tested positive for

139
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:55,140
cocaine,

140
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,060
going to fight in the biggest fight of
his career and the last time you tested

141
00:03:58,061 --> 00:03:59,470
him was one month before the bow.

142
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,420
Then Osad has got some explaining to do,

143
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:03,340
but there's more to the story now.

144
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,420
What do we hear it does?

145
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,710
He passes the end up in the spot.

146
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:06,341
I don't know,

147
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:06,910
but that's,

148
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,410
that's the piece that's still missing.

149
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,070
Well,

150
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,680
there's one aspect to his,

151
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:11,980
uh,

152
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,980
test is positive tests that people are
saying could possibly play a factor and

153
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,970
it's a supplements that he
could possibly have been taking.

154
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,590
Something that like,

155
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:28,390
this is what happened to Tim means this
is what happened Yoel Romero where they

156
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:32,530
get a supplement and it says it has a
bunch of stuff on it says you look through

157
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,190
the ingredients.

158
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:33,491
Okay,

159
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:35,290
creatine B12 we're good,

160
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,100
we're good.

161
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,050
But then when you run it through a lab,

162
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:39,760
it turns out there's a bunch
of other stuff in there too.

163
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,910
And that's why it's so effective
and that's why it sells.

164
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,760
So it is possible that
that could be the case.

165
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,810
We don't know yet.

166
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,370
Cause then if that's the case,

167
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,030
then John has to give them all the
supplements that he was taking.

168
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,680
And then they have to go to a store,

169
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:54,880
buy them independently,

170
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:58,530
test them and verify that these
ingredients were in not just the bachelor,

171
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,373
he hands them,

172
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,970
but also in other batches.

173
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:02,110
So it's not like he doctored,

174
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:03,130
it shows some stuff in there.

175
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,993
Sure.

176
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,990
But estrogen blockers are usually when
people are getting off of steroids.

177
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,580
When you're coming off a cycle.

178
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:09,760
Yeah,

179
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,630
and it's a blocker.

180
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:10,931
You know,

181
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:12,210
men don't want estrogen anyway,

182
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,090
but it's a blocker.

183
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:13,271
It's,

184
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:13,901
it's not going to.

185
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:15,550
So as far as that substance goes,

186
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:16,001
and that's all,

187
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:17,490
that's all he's going
to have to live with.

188
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,530
You're not going to explain,

189
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,870
explain how they work.

190
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,480
Like for someone who doesn't understand
what an estrogen blocker will do.

191
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:24,100
If you up your testosterone,

192
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,250
then your estrogen just naturally
ops and guys don't want estrogen.

193
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:27,791
So if you're a guy,

194
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:28,230
you,

195
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,250
you take a blocker that can block that,

196
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:30,631
bring it to it,

197
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,690
you won't get a,

198
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:33,100
you know that the man's moves.

199
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,000
Where there are you making the,

200
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,790
I'm trying to think of the word guide.

201
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,640
Gas Stove.

202
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:36,971
I can't,

203
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:39,250
even when I came from Mitch
tits is all that comes to mind.

204
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:41,410
I can't think of the word guide.

205
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,673
We're closed guide.

206
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,060
I know.

207
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,760
God I know.

208
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,593
Got a mass to go.

209
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,160
At any rate,

210
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,510
it can stop some of those things.

211
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:48,580
So that's the speculation.

212
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,730
The reason that that's on the list is
they find that that's a way they can catch

213
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:52,720
you after the fact,

214
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:52,841
Hey,

215
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:53,890
if we missed you during the cycle,

216
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:54,730
we can catch you here.

217
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,001
Well,

218
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:55,990
it's not just that the,

219
00:05:55,991 --> 00:06:00,410
the reason why they take it after the
cycle is because you get hypogonadism,

220
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:00,621
your,

221
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:00,830
your,

222
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,830
your body stops producing testosterone
because you took exogenous testosterone.

223
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:06,290
That's right.

224
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:06,880
And so the,

225
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,850
to restart it,

226
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,200
they'd take this stuff,

227
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,730
these estrogen blocker.

228
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,110
Yeah,

229
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,530
that's right.

230
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:11,980
Yeah.

231
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,780
I tested positive for an estrogen
blocker and it was that exact thing.

232
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,191
Same thing.

233
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:16,120
They banned testosterone.

234
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:17,590
I went on something called Hcg.

235
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,940
She'll return your testes back on
and then you have to clomiphene,

236
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,480
which is by definition an estrogen
blocker for that same thing,

237
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:28,720
but can also help get your body
going back on testosterone.

238
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,823
So their band,

239
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,770
John's got a problem.

240
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:31,181
And again,

241
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:32,440
this comes back to the press conference.

242
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:32,981
He said,

243
00:06:32,981 --> 00:06:37,030
I have not taken anything new that
I have not taken my entire career.

244
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,100
So somebody gave him a followup question.

245
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:41,140
He quickly realized what
he just said and he goes,

246
00:06:41,141 --> 00:06:41,291
wow,

247
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:41,600
I,

248
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,150
I do have a new supplement company.

249
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,400
I,

250
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,070
I have taken some new supplements.

251
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,400
So he realized he put
himself in one point,

252
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:48,310
you need to get out of it.

253
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,190
The supplement company then
who dropped him immediately,

254
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:51,520
quit,

255
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,550
came out with a press release,

256
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:52,721
said,

257
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:54,040
do not put this on us.

258
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,980
We don't have anything to do with that
and we'll turn over any samples you want.

259
00:06:56,981 --> 00:06:57,241
So that,

260
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:57,610
that's,

261
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,850
that's the downside to holding the press
conference is if there's anything that

262
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:01,780
commission hates,

263
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,060
it's when somebody isn't honest with them.

264
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:04,211
Well,

265
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:07,240
if there's anything who Sada hates and
it's with Lance Armstrong found out,

266
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,500
it's when you deny the scientific
accuracy of their test,

267
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,950
that's the risk with
holding a press conference.

268
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:17,590
And that's why most legal
teams will tell you,

269
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,603
go home,

270
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,331
be quiet,

271
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:21,100
rewrite a right to remain silent.

272
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,150
Execute that.

273
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,290
Show up at your hearing date,

274
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:23,951
gets sworn in,

275
00:07:23,951 --> 00:07:24,701
say your piece,

276
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:25,810
and then go on about your life.

277
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,040
How does John not have a trusted handler?

278
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,430
How does John not have someone who
realizes that you don't just have like a,

279
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,810
uh,

280
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,430
a high level athlete?

281
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,760
You have arguably the greatest
light heavyweight of all time,

282
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,511
who has not,

283
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:44,141
in my opinion,

284
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:48,280
reached his potential yet I think John
has massive potential outside of what

285
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:51,910
he's actually shown because when he moved
to Albuquerque and we saw that he was

286
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:55,100
training all the time and we saw the
most recent footage before he fought over

287
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:57,340
in Saint Pru where he's power lifting,

288
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,780
he looks fucking huge.

289
00:07:58,870 --> 00:07:59,830
He's dedicated,

290
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:00,820
his eating clean,

291
00:08:00,821 --> 00:08:03,700
he's making these Instagram videos
of all this healthy food he's eating.

292
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,250
We're assuming he's getting the proper
rest and all these other things.

293
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,660
We're assuming you'll get the wild man.

294
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:08,231
Days are gone.

295
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:09,490
He still got the wild man's mind,

296
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,910
but now he's going to approach this
like a real competitive athlete.

297
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,990
Here's my question to you.

298
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,250
When someone is wild and
talented and impulsive,

299
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:20,530
just a wild motherfucker
like Jon Jones is,

300
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,890
is it even smart to reign that guy in Ken,

301
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,970
Ken,

302
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,930
it affect him.

303
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,471
I mean,

304
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:31,471
is it a positive thing to reign him in
or is part of what he is and why he's so

305
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:37,090
good and why he's willing to open
with a flying knee on a shogun?

306
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,950
The their their first fight,

307
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,980
I mean the first fight for a title it,

308
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,411
what was He,

309
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:46,060
2123 or 20 he opens up
with a flying knee on,

310
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:46,570
you know,

311
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,130
one of the legends of MMA,

312
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,220
former pride champion or fry pride up
Grand Prix tramp champion and UFC champion

313
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:54,220
as well.

314
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,491
You will,

315
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,920
you look at a like John and the,

316
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,370
the way he competes in the way he's,

317
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,850
he's so creative and wild
in there and impulsive.

318
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,730
It's almost like that's
a part of his success.

319
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,630
I fully agree and historically I could
bring up athletes where that is true or

320
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,240
they go sober where they go straight
in there when they find God,

321
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:16,860
whatever these things are and
they change something that yeah,

322
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:18,150
the dominoes start to fall.

323
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:20,550
The problem is when you've
got a wild man like John,

324
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,510
he's in a box and it's a loose
box and he's having some fights,

325
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,090
but usually that continues to escalate.

326
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:29,790
So he kinda needs to keep
himself right in that framework.

327
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,730
And the bad news is it
usually just keeps getting,

328
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,500
it just usually just keeps pushing.

329
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:35,580
So that's a very important,

330
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:36,540
that becomes a problem.

331
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,600
That's a very important point where
people escalate things like billionaires

332
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:40,650
want more billions,

333
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:40,980
right?

334
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,060
They want islands now.

335
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:44,310
They want fucking jets and spaceships and,

336
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,410
and with a pro athlete or a
wild person is doing crazy shit.

337
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,000
They want to do more crazy shit.

338
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,880
They want to drive 150 miles an hour.

339
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,190
Right?

340
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,360
They want to Ah,

341
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:55,771
man,

342
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:57,840
but it just seems like
whatever the fuck you do,

343
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:58,210
just,

344
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,270
just nerf everything around him,

345
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:00,810
you know?

346
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,320
Right.

347
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,460
By up to town.

348
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,010
Fucking have three guys that he trusts.

349
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:08,340
Follow him around everywhere and make
sure that he doesn't eat anything that

350
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:08,981
he's not supposed to eat.

351
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:09,360
Sure.

352
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,980
Don't take any pills you're
not supposed to take.

353
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:11,814
Don't,

354
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,110
most of us don't drive.

355
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:13,501
I mean,

356
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:16,710
that was his biggest problem was getting
behind the wheel in front of everything

357
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:17,341
else he was doing.

358
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:17,961
It's like John Jay,

359
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:18,600
you got to get,

360
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,540
you got to get a show for it.

361
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:20,191
You've got to get Uber,

362
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:21,090
you got to take a taxi,

363
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,470
don't get behind the wheel.

364
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:24,210
That was the most of his problems.

365
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,021
He had some other ones,

366
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:26,160
but that was the most of it.

367
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:28,380
If you just took him out
of the driver's seat,

368
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,120
a lot of this doesn't exist.

369
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,380
Yeah.

370
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,590
A lot of it doesn't exist.

371
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:34,560
But this most recent one obviously
it does and the most like,

372
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:34,801
yeah,

373
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,460
he had those,

374
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,710
the co two major car accidents,

375
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:40,740
we had that beautiful Bentley
and slid it into a tree.

376
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,603
Right.

377
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,181
And then,

378
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:42,401
uh,

379
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:45,540
obviously the one where you crashing that
woman and left the scene of the crime,

380
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:46,560
which was horrendous.

381
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,510
He survived that though.

382
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,111
You know,

383
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:49,771
he survived that.

384
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:50,540
He came back and the,

385
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,050
and Saint [inaudible] he won,

386
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:57,090
he beat a top six guy on short notice
and then this happens and two is he get

387
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,290
positive and something that as a is
small and innocuous as estrogen blockers.

388
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:04,621
Yeah,

389
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:05,101
I agree.

390
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:07,140
So you go back to that
open state proof fight.

391
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,620
Single worst performance is a
performance of John's career.

392
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,080
Single worst by light years.

393
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,640
And then you break it
down a little further.

394
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,130
He won the grapple and he won the
strike and he won every round.

395
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,640
He didn't,

396
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,720
he didn't back off.

397
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:19,560
You didn't get tired.

398
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:20,430
He was stronger.

399
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,990
And that was on a bad day.

400
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,520
I didn't think it was a bad fight.

401
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:23,731
I,

402
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:24,150
you know,

403
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,710
everyone says the single
worst performance.

404
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,040
I have a great deal of respect for open
St Pru and I think [inaudible] is a very

405
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:32,880
dangerous guy.

406
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,440
He's very explosive.

407
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,020
His left power kick is extremely strong.

408
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,490
He has a nasty left hook.

409
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:40,890
He's a southpaw and he fights odd.

410
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:42,450
He has a very odd style.

411
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,460
I would agree about elephants.

412
00:11:44,461 --> 00:11:47,370
I think your assessment there is fair
and I think his stock went up that night,

413
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:48,240
but when I'm watching John,

414
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:48,511
I'm going,

415
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:48,751
okay,

416
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:49,430
this isn't that.

417
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,610
This is a rusty John.

418
00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:51,391
This is slower.

419
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:54,070
The outputs a little
bit down the bottom line

420
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,940
is on a bad day,

421
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:56,680
he left with a world
championship on a bed.

422
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:57,520
That's how good he is.

423
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,290
The other side of John,

424
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,140
you know when you're talking about the
car wrecks or one more time about the

425
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:03,430
cocaine or what he's going through now,

426
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:03,821
and again,

427
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:05,410
this was my takeaway from
the press conference.

428
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,060
The biggest takeaway was John won't
own anything and it's like John,

429
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:13,000
at some point you can't
do the routine about,

430
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,980
I don't know why God put me in this spot.

431
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:15,814
This is a bit,

432
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,230
I don't know why God put me in the spot.

433
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:18,520
Everything happens for a reason.

434
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:19,720
I'm going to come out
better on the other side,

435
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:20,554
it's like John,

436
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,280
you're acting like you got diagnosed
with diabetes or cancer or something,

437
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,270
you know and that you're the victim.

438
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,560
You were in a hit and run.

439
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:27,371
You did the hidden,

440
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,180
and you did the running.

441
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,013
That was your fault.

442
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,160
On the cocaine thing.

443
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:30,641
You didn't say,

444
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:31,750
somebody slipped me a Mickey.

445
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:31,991
You said,

446
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:32,920
I was at a party in Brazil.

447
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:34,410
I rolled up a hundred and
went down to the table.

448
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,273
That was your fault.

449
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:40,000
Now you're in a jam here for two banned
substances and you're still not taking

450
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,890
respond and you think
God's put you in this spot.

451
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:42,430
It's like John said,

452
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,130
you put yourself in this spot and at
some point if you're the baddest dude in

453
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,000
the world and you are,

454
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,010
you got to man up on these things.

455
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,000
You got to man up and go,

456
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:49,151
Hey,

457
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:51,100
I'm guilty and I how exactly it happened.

458
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:51,230
I'm,

459
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,540
I'm going to try to figure that out,

460
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,000
but I'm definitely guilty
who Sada does a good job.

461
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:55,870
I trust those labs.

462
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:56,710
Let's get to the bottom of it.

463
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,680
Jail son in public relations.

464
00:12:58,681 --> 00:12:59,191
This is what we need.

465
00:12:59,191 --> 00:13:01,260
We need to here need a little earpiece.

466
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,820
You put in John Jones ear.

467
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,290
You sit behind the screens,

468
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:05,124
you have a monitor.

469
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,730
You Go,

470
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:05,911
no,

471
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:06,021
no,

472
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:06,201
no,

473
00:13:06,201 --> 00:13:06,351
no,

474
00:13:06,351 --> 00:13:06,561
no.

475
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:06,920
John.

476
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,540
This is not just stop.

477
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,770
Stop right there,

478
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,630
but no more victim no more.

479
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,470
Yeah,

480
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,050
you stand up like Tony Montana
and that fucking restaurant.

481
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,380
You're looking at the back guy
there to say hello there it is.

482
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,120
Low through the bad guy.

483
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:20,871
Yeah.

484
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:21,651
I liked to party.

485
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:22,160
Bitch,

486
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,821
I fucked up.

487
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:23,654
I took some shit.

488
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,140
Uh,

489
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,331
what,

490
00:13:24,331 --> 00:13:29,331
so what supplements would
have testosterone blockers
or estrogen blockers,

491
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,790
excuse none that I've
ever heard of and again,

492
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,253
but,

493
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,170
but if they boost testosterone,

494
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,610
estrogen blockers,

495
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,860
apparently the is more
of an effective test off.

496
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:41,850
How's it work?

497
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,120
I'm not,

498
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,070
I've never heard that.

499
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:43,990
And that could be true.

500
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,830
I think of myself as kind of an expert
in this field from being on the wrong

501
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:48,131
side.

502
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:48,521
But you know,

503
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:49,450
being on both sides of it.

504
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,340
But uh,

505
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,820
I've never heard of that.

506
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:53,650
I can't imagine why I supplement
company would do that.

507
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:57,280
And this supplement company wasn't like
Tim Means his company or Eol Ramirez,

508
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:59,470
they came out with a
press release instantly.

509
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,090
So do not put this on us.

510
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,680
Let us know what you need from us.

511
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:04,330
We'll drop it off at the lab ourselves.

512
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,041
Jamie,

513
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:06,780
see if you find this online,

514
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:10,050
because someone told me about it this
weekend and I never got a chance to look

515
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:10,410
at.

516
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,410
Someone said that there are certain
things in supplements that you know,

517
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,690
could have been sold by a company that
would allow you to test positive for

518
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:22,110
these very things.

519
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,260
See if,

520
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,380
see if you can find that in,

521
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:26,970
in relationship to John Jones is test.

522
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:28,800
Cause I remember someone
talking about it and I said,

523
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,210
I got to remember to look this up.

524
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,320
It's only there only those two chemicals.

525
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:37,350
The only exist like in
a pharmaceutical world,

526
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:37,680
right?

527
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:37,831
Yeah,

528
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:38,550
that's right.

529
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,500
So it's not like it's a root or something.

530
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,210
No.

531
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:41,680
Okay.

532
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,080
No.

533
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,900
And then what exactly they got him
for me that that's still coming out.

534
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:45,800
But that was one of the things,

535
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,930
again to go back to the
press conference and I think,

536
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,730
I think John did more
good than he did bay.

537
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,530
I think it was kind of a
good thing that came out.

538
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:52,131
He show courage.

539
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:52,851
He didn't read the script,

540
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:53,750
he answered all the questions.

541
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,240
But the bad was he didn't tell
us what he tested positive for.

542
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:57,720
Right.

543
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,760
And the bad news.

544
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,050
Now he's stuck with speculation.

545
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:01,790
If he were to come out and
tell us exactly what it was,

546
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,870
you and I won't have to gas and go to
the Internet and Spec and speculation and

547
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:06,680
rumors is which what you don't need.

548
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,100
Right.

549
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,980
I don't know why he held
that with understanding.

550
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,860
Osada is going to tell us if
you don't tell us who Sada,

551
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,753
I don't think they know.

552
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,010
No,

553
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:14,251
I don't.

554
00:15:14,251 --> 00:15:14,601
I really,

555
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:17,510
I think if they're going to
charge him and they getting sued,

556
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,410
we have,

557
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,540
they're going to charge him
and they are within the event.

558
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:20,781
Oh,

559
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:22,850
that I'm going for for
breaking only one year.

560
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:23,730
Like y'all take it,

561
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,321
go information,

562
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:25,154
you'll take it.

563
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:25,491
No,

564
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,810
not if it's medical information.

565
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,160
I suppose you're right with Hipaa,

566
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,080
but this doesn't fall under that.

567
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,590
The commission is going to bring charges
against him for certain supplements are

568
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:34,251
going to bring him in,

569
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:35,390
require that he's there.

570
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,190
They're going to have to address it.

571
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:38,240
Then he's going to say his piece,

572
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:38,391
look,

573
00:15:38,391 --> 00:15:38,841
I took this.

574
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:41,090
I didn't think I'd get caught or
I don't know anything about it.

575
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:41,351
That's,

576
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:42,860
that's a route guys go as well,

577
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,690
but the bottom line is
it's going to come out.

578
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:49,010
I thought he had a good opportunity to
tell us what it was and perhaps give a

579
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:51,980
guess as to how it got an assist
him if he's going to take that path.

580
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,300
The outright denial path,

581
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:55,130
that's not a great one historically,

582
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,910
but some guys take it if that's the route
he's going to go down outright denial.

583
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,343
Tell us what it is.

584
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,893
Okay.

585
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:10,400
Okay.
