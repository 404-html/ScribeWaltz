1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,920
Yes.

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,290
That's almost start everything from now
on.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,570
Yes.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,130
Like Diego Sanchez style.
Uh,

5
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:17,360
what's up folks?
How are you guys?

6
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:18,080
Good.
How are you doing?

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,600
Thank you for coming here.
Really appreciate it.

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,100
I'm doing good at it.
An answer your question.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,390
It's one of those questions,
you know.

10
00:00:23,391 --> 00:00:24,200
Hey,
what's up man?

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,940
What's up man?
Like neither one answers,

12
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:29,510
but it's acceptable for whatever reason.
We've got to change that.

13
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,240
We've going to change a lot of things.
Documentary freaking the fuck out.

14
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,940
Let's talk about it.
Cowspiracy um,

15
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,820
if you haven't seen it,
pause as podcasts.

16
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:39,350
Go to Netflix.
It's only on Netflix.

17
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,270
I tried to find on apple TV and I was
like,

18
00:00:41,271 --> 00:00:43,790
what?
Only netflix.

19
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,070
Netflix continues to kill it.
Um,

20
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,120
but your,
your,

21
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:49,880
uh,
your documentary is very scary.

22
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,390
It's one of those documentary suite.
You can look at a lot of documentaries

23
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:54,320
and go,
well,

24
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,510
there's a bias in this documentary and
these guys,

25
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:57,890
you know,
they're thinking that,

26
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,724
uh,
the,

27
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,480
the negative aspects of this outweigh
the positive aspects of it.

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,020
But it's debatable when you look at your
documentary.

29
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:08,600
It's one of those things where you go
like,

30
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:12,260
I shut it off after it was over.
It was like one o'clock in the morning.

31
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:16,100
I was getting ready to go to bed,
which is not a good idea to plan the

32
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:18,860
fucking rest of your life.
Think about the future of the world,

33
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:20,360
FTC,
a documentary like yours.

34
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,980
Uh,
and I'm sitting there going,

35
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,080
well,
there's nothing.

36
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,710
He's not much.
You can say like when you look at the

37
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:32,060
devastation that's being done with
livestock in this country,

38
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,460
when you look soberly,
look at it soberly,

39
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,880
look at the numbers.
He's soberly look at the amount of land

40
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:41,390
they need to graze.
You soberly look at the amount of people

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,680
that we smoosh into these little areas
where we don't grow shit and we call

42
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:48,050
them cities and we have to truck
everything in.

43
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,590
When you soberly look at the amount of
methane that's being reduced but

44
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,980
produced by cow shit and cow farts,
and then the reaction that you guys got

45
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,380
when you tried to bring up that aspect
of it,

46
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,930
that was the weirdest part of your
documentary.

47
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,650
I expected going in that the documentary
would sort of highlight some issues that

48
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,500
people have already with factory farming
and show you,

49
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,010
you know,
what effect it had on the environment.

50
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,100
I didn't anticipate it would be that
much of an effect and I didn't

51
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:21,170
anticipate the,
you would get the kind of resistance

52
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:26,171
that you got from activists,
activists that are scared of that

53
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:28,950
industry.
You know,

54
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,130
what was it like making that documentary
that was actually more to the Mo,

55
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,970
more of the motivation was that these
environmental groups,

56
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:37,190
the greenpeaces reinforce section that
work,

57
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,190
uh,
Sierra Club that they didn't address

58
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:44,900
this issue was more of inspiration to
make the film and pissed us off to the

59
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:48,560
point of making the film more than the
actual facts themselves.

60
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,870
And the facts are so overwhelming when I
found them out,

61
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,240
but the fact that they didn't talk about
this,

62
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,103
I like,
I felt,

63
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,520
you know,
betrayed and,

64
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:55,971
and then,
then,

65
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:57,260
you know,
once I started calling them,

66
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,850
it became really kind of off.
This is kip Andersen talking,

67
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,220
by the way.
And Keegan Kuhn is the other gentlemen

68
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,110
to his right.
Um,

69
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:05,891
you know,
to me,

70
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:08,020
I kind of liking it a little there.
They're scared.

71
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,010
They're obviously scared this or they're
complicit is one of two things,

72
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:14,050
right?
Either they're scared or they're taking

73
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:17,020
money from these environmental groups
could be both.

74
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,270
Right.
And another one.

75
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:21,910
And also they're contributing to it and
they imagine you're the America.

76
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,340
That's what it meant when I said taking
money from these environmental groups.

77
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,470
I switched around,
I met the environmental groups are

78
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:30,430
taking money from that industry.
And also to imagine you're the American

79
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,050
Lung Association and you're sitting
around board of director meetings,

80
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:34,670
you all smoking cigarettes and then
you're telling somebody not smoke

81
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:35,170
cigarettes.

82
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,170
And that's a huge part of it.
We,

83
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,830
we walked in a couple organizations
groups during lunch and here they're,

84
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,140
you know,
they're in front of like a

85
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:45,880
slaughterhouse eating their lunch and
they're discussing how to say the rain

86
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:47,020
forest and it's like,
wait,

87
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:50,740
while we connect your connection here,
they're eating burgers and shit.

88
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,170
Talks about the rain forest.
Um,

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,390
you know,
another thing that really disturbed me

90
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:59,050
about your documentary was when that
gentleman who was a former cattle

91
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:03,730
rancher was talking about his,
his being sued and how the industry sued

92
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:06,550
him and he'd gotten some real deep legal
trouble,

93
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:11,551
cost him a ton of money.
But how now today with the Patriot Act,

94
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,760
he would have never won the case because
it doesn't matter if you're correct now.

95
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,150
Now if you have an action,
like you make a documentary,

96
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:23,260
you do something that adversely affects
that industry or any industry where they

97
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:26,560
can prove they're losing money by the
Patriot Act,

98
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,580
your league,
you're legally complicit or you legally

99
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:31,310
guilty.
Right?

100
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,200
Isn't that how it works?
Yeah.

101
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:35,200
Well so there is a law created call the
Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act and it

102
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:37,990
was focused on just animal rights
activists and environmental rights

103
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:38,920
activist and it,
yeah,

104
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:41,830
the law says anyone who disrupts the
business of an animal enterprise is

105
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:44,530
committing an act of terrorism.
Jesus fucking Christ.

106
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:45,550
That's scary,
right?

107
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,470
I mean cause then that goes,
it's so far reaching.

108
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:51,430
That's from someone who saves one
chicken from a farm or someone who does

109
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:54,850
a protest or I mean there's three
activists up in the bay who are arrested

110
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:58,810
under the law for doing passing out
leaflets and doing chalk outlines on

111
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:01,000
sidewalks.
It's just crazy.

112
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,010
Total violation of first amendment
that's so,

113
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,070
so

114
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,640
fucking wrong.
It's so wrong and so dangerous when you

115
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:11,200
let an industry just dictate just by
sheer money what people can and can't

116
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:14,650
protest feet deep things that people
find morally reprehensible.

117
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,230
There's a reason why there's these ag
gag laws.

118
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,560
What ag gag laws,
if you're not aware,

119
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,170
if you listen to this,
there's laws against taking film footage

120
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:26,920
of those pigs that are shoved into those
cages and chicken shoved into cages and

121
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,260
cruelty to animals.
If you've ever watched any of those

122
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,070
disturbing,
uh,

123
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,980
videos at p to puts up,
well,

124
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:37,240
they'll show like a guy like sheering
wool and kicking the shit out of the

125
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,860
lamb.
It's fucking,

126
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,600
it's hard to watch,
man.

127
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,860
It's,
it's weird.

128
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,470
Or is it a sheep or lamb?
Lamb was a young one,

129
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:45,400
right?
Is that what what it is?

130
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,070
Yeah.
These guys like you think,

131
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:48,581
Oh,
I'm wearing,

132
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,870
whoa,
it's just a,

133
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:51,310
they just give him a haircut.

134
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,860
Bullshit.
They beat the fuck out of those things

135
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,410
because those things don't want a
haircut and they're,

136
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,290
they bleed and cause they're not gentle
with those sheers.

137
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,220
Oh,
obviously I don't know if it's just one

138
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:04,190
time that they filmed this and it's just
one asshole.

139
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,560
But there's laws against filming those
things now.

140
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,070
So the only way that that ever stops,
the only way people ever go,

141
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:13,100
hey man,
I'm only gonna eat free range this or

142
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:13,970
grass fed.
That.

143
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,230
The only way that happens ever as you
have to know what the consequences of

144
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:20,290
not doing that are,
you have to know if you off,

145
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,740
you're buying this factory raised meat.
This is how it lives.

146
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,930
Are you cool with that?
Most people are not cool with that.

147
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,450
So instead of fixing it and making it
better,

148
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,650
they make it illegal to report all this
unethical,

149
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:37,430
fucked up dark shit they're doing the
animals that is,

150
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,980
that's so fucking anti-american.

151
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,050
It at every level.
Yeah.

152
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:44,090
But I mean that's shows how powerful
this industry is.

153
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:46,340
It literally can dictate to the
government what they want the laws to

154
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:47,031
be.
Cause Yeah.

155
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,160
The yag lost dump benefit consumers in
any way.

156
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,010
They are completely written by the
industry themselves.

157
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,010
Those motherfuckers need to take
mushrooms.

158
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,270
All those people that are involved in
those chicken farms and pig farms to the

159
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:02,540
cows just grow some please.
You do.

160
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,270
You don't understand.
I understand they're making a fuck load

161
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:06,081
of money.
I get it.

162
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:07,970
They don't want to stop making a fuck
load of money.

163
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,430
But the idea that that's all you have to
do is just have so much money coming in

164
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:16,730
that you can get away with this.
How is that any different than like

165
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,850
animal beastiality?
How's it any different than animal

166
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:21,560
torture?
Like animal torture is illegal.

167
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:25,700
If like Michael Vick got in trouble
because he was shooting his dogs and

168
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:28,400
killing him,
how has that really different than the

169
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,480
way they treat pigs?

170
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,380
As I say,
you know the,

171
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:32,180
at least the dogs had a chance,
you know,

172
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:34,910
these animals had no chance at all.
You know those dogs?

173
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,070
Yeah.
Like I guess a dogs have a chance.

174
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,370
I mean,
the thing about pit bulls is the real,

175
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,550
the ones they use for fighting,
they breed them to not have any animal

176
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:45,080
aggression.
You could beat the shit out of them.

177
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:49,490
They don't fight back then they're bred
to never sort of go after people.

178
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:51,680
It's very weird.
Anyway,

179
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:54,110
that doesn't beside the point.
The point is this,

180
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,160
this industry has so much fucking money
that they're able to do something that I

181
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:02,780
think pretty much everybody would
disagree with and that stop you from

182
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:08,330
letting people be aware of the
consequences of their purchase power.

183
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,830
They're buying.
Like if you buy,

184
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,130
you want to buy the cheapest meat,
you want to buy the cheapest meat

185
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:13,880
possible.

186
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,560
This is how it's grown.
This is,

187
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,980
this is how it's managed.
This is how they bring these things to

188
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,900
slaughter.
Are you comfortable with that thing is

189
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:21,860
too.
It's not only,

190
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:24,500
you know,
even if even if you have organic or the

191
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:29,060
free range or you know all these other
more more than anything in marketing

192
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:30,230
terms,
they don't let you,

193
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,440
they don't let you in these places as
well as across the board.

194
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,300
I have a friend,
my friend Doug during,

195
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:36,760
he lives in Wisconsin and he,
oh,

196
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,890
he owns a farm and he has grass fed cows
and uh,

197
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:44,090
I had one idea of what it's like to be
grass fed cow and then I visited his

198
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:46,550
farm.
So my idea of what it's like to be a

199
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:49,840
grass fed cow and he only has a few cows
and it's not a gigantic farms,

200
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:50,840
a few hundred acres.
And it's,

201
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,460
you know,
it's not his main business.

202
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,920
It's like a family thing that he does
and he grows his own beef.

203
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,410
Those cows are fucking terrified.
If you go in that cage though,

204
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,090
they fucking run.
They run and they bunch up and I,

205
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:04,020
and I was out there and went,
oh,

206
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:08,010
they know what the fuck is going on.
And it's not that much space.

207
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,260
I mean,
even if they have a giant pasture,

208
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:13,140
you obviously have to be able to rope
them in cause you're gonna eventually

209
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:14,760
kill him and they kind of know it

210
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,250
go anywhere near those fuckers.
You think of it as like those pigs in

211
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:20,400
your documentary,
those pigs that those people were

212
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:22,990
raising in northern California,
which were kind of like pets.

213
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,170
They came over and these little kids
were petting them and stuff.

214
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,290
That's not how his cows are.
Cows are fucking running for their life,

215
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,330
and the thing is those cows,
they know,

216
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:33,160
they know,
they know what's going on and they're

217
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:33,994
only,
they're just,

218
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,230
they're just babies.
You know,

219
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,770
they get killed at 18 months.
Imagine they can live as long as dogs.

220
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:41,890
Imagine a puppy getting killed at 18
months.

221
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,350
They know what's going on in 18 months
is the grass fed,

222
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,000
no grain fed,
right?

223
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,180
Grass beds even longer.
It's about 24 months because they have

224
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:51,610
to take some longer to grow.
They're just there.

225
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,690
They're eating their natural diet.

226
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,360
What did we do?
So how'd we get here?

227
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,810
How the fuck did human beings can get to
this position where,

228
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,560
I mean,
I think it's wonderful in terms of our

229
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:05,110
ability to innovate,
create technology,

230
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:06,670
educate each other.
You know what I mean?

231
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:07,411
Wow.
What a,

232
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:12,411
what a gigantic relief.
It's been to remove the daily necessity

233
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:16,210
of gathering food.
It's been a gigantic relief and it's

234
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,260
caused the human race to accelerate,
to technologically innovate at a before

235
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:24,760
never seen pace.
I mean,

236
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:27,490
what we've been able to do over the last
hundred years,

237
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:32,491
it's been nothing short of insane,
but the consequences seem to be not

238
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:37,861
thought out and um,
not planned for and no solution in place

239
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,633
to mitigate it.

240
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,600
Yeah.
And that's the thing is the,

241
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,880
when we talk about population in the
film,

242
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,270
you know,
and was at 19 1800 is one 1 billion,

243
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,600
1901.5 2000 2012,
7 billion just exploded.

244
00:10:54,501 --> 00:10:58,490
And then not only that though,
the necessity to the meat consumption in

245
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,860
dairy consumption and just in the last
50 years.

246
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,410
So a lot of these people have this
notion of,

247
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:04,940
you know,
the grass fed,

248
00:11:04,941 --> 00:11:06,260
that's where get into and they're
organic,

249
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:08,270
but they're living in a time where it's
50 years ago,

250
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:11,060
a hundred years ago,
we're in 2000 now.

251
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:13,520
16 that's,
it's not a reality.

252
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:15,590
It's a myth.
There's too many of us,

253
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,180
dammit.
But people are cool.

254
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:23,050
I like a micron is around a lot around.
It's weird,

255
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:23,894
you know,
it's,

256
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,960
it's a,
it's such a catch 22 like,

257
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,890
but there's definitely do many of us,
but fuck,

258
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,510
it's awesome having so many people

259
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,330
because having somebody be,
I find uh,

260
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,820
I love like going into a rural areas,
the mountains and stuff like that,

261
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:41,500
but I think living there I would miss
the amount of people that you get and

262
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,930
like the Los Angeles area,
you get a lot of like really cool

263
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:47,060
people.
You get the in giant groups you are,

264
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,190
you're more likely to find a large
number of cool people just by sheer

265
00:11:51,191 --> 00:11:53,920
volume just by numbers.
But

266
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,500
fuck man,
that's one thing that's looked at in the

267
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:57,540
film is that yeah,
they'll,

268
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,850
how do you feed 7.2 billion people and
the only way you're really going to do

269
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:03,220
it is to eat as ecologically as
possible.

270
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:06,340
And that's a plant based diet or getting
as close to a plant based diet as she

271
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:06,920
can.

272
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,460
Yeah.
Well,

273
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,920
it seems like,
like what I like to do,

274
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,340
I grow a lot of my own vegetables and
I've been the last few years I've been

275
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:18,170
hunting in this year eating,
trying to at least exclusively stuff

276
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,900
that I've killed myself.
But everybody can't do that.

277
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,360
You know,
you can't preach that as an ethic.

278
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,700
You can't,
cause it's just not possible first of

279
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:26,450
all,
time wise,

280
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,330
not possible for most folks with
families or with jobs.

281
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:32,900
It's just they just don't have the time
to gather that much meat to feed your

282
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:34,730
whole family for a year.
If you eat meat,

283
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,770
you know,
three or four days a week,

284
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,810
even you,
you're not going to be able to do it.

285
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:40,910
And then two,
the other thing is there's just not

286
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:42,920
enough animals.
There's just not,

287
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,290
there's not enough white tail.
There's more white tailed deer right now

288
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,990
than there have ever been ever in the
history of this continent,

289
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,770
just by management,
by wildlife protection agencies and um,

290
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,660
uh,
go fish and game departments,

291
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,530
making sure that,
you know,

292
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,410
these animals have adequate habitat and
they only take a certain amount per year

293
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:03,560
and things along those lines.
So there's more whitetail deer than

294
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:06,110
there have ever been in North America,
but not enough to feed everybody,

295
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,060
not even close,
not even close.

296
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:10,220
We would kill them all and we would
still be starving.

297
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,261
That's it.
Yeah.

298
00:13:11,261 --> 00:13:13,300
I mean hunting really.
Cause people have brought that up.

299
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:14,860
They say,
well what about sustainable hunting?

300
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,670
And the truth is that we've replaced
most of the wild animals on the planet

301
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,690
with our domesticated animals and we've
taken the wild animals land and we've

302
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,460
used it to grow feed to feed livestock
or to graze livestock.

303
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,590
And so yeah,
just as you said,

304
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,960
I mean,
we've literally replaced 90% of wildlife

305
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,290
with our own species.
Like what wildlife isn't there anymore?

306
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,900
That was besides obvious ones like
buffalo.

307
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,090
Yeah.
I mean there's the obvious like

308
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,420
megafauna.
Um,

309
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,070
but it's also,
I mean,

310
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,520
you'll have to look at timber wolves.
Eastern timberwolves were basically

311
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:49,210
wiped out primarily for fur trade and
because they preyed on cattle.

312
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,980
Um,
and so then you have other species that

313
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:53,800
move in and so you see an explosion of,
for example,

314
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:54,760
yeah,
whitetail deer.

315
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But that's because we've eliminated all
the other species around them,

316
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,530
laminated all the predators because the
predators are a threat to the livestock.

317
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,860
And so once you eliminate the predators,
now you have all these deer running

318
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:08,650
around and multiplying,
and then that's where wildlife

319
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:11,230
management comes in,
which is complete bullshit because we're

320
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:12,940
true.
Wildlife management is good already

321
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:17,020
getting ready rid of the cows and
getting rid of all the other wildlife,

322
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,140
all the other wildlife,
wildlife doc,

323
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,770
getting rid of it.
Yeah,

324
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,103
yeah,
yeah,

325
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,120
yeah.
So basically what's happening,

326
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:27,160
just one,
just one year ago,

327
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,170
um,
what was the stats on how many,

328
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,870
oh,
I mean,

329
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,810
US Department of Agriculture has a
wildlife services program and they

330
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:38,980
eliminate wild animals who prey on the
livestock industry.

331
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,540
So they killed mountain lions.
Coyotes mean it's like 60,000 coyotes

332
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,360
last year were killed by the US
government because they're perceived as

333
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:49,630
a threat to this industry.
400 wolves,

334
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,100
500 black guys.
I'm sure you're

335
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,070
aware of the reintroduction of wolves,
you know about all that and like how

336
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:57,020
they reintroduce wolves to North America
from,

337
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,490
uh,
from actually from Canada.

338
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,571
Right.
Fascinating.

339
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:00,690
It's very controversial.
Oh,

340
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,430
for sure.
Yeah.

341
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,320
Yeah.
Because a elk population has been

342
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:05,780
decimated,
but then they've also attacked some

343
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:08,810
livestock in British Columbia.
When my friend Mike Lives,

344
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:11,660
I'm,
his neighbor's cow was taken out by a

345
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,100
wolf.
I think they were,

346
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,490
they were all sitting around from the
fucking bedroom window watching a pack

347
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:20,150
of monsters tear cal park,
like right in this little pen.

348
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,810
It's gotta be fucking spooky.
I mean,

349
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,020
but still mean wolf populations aren't
even anywhere close to what they were a

350
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,801
century ago.
That's true.

351
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,320
But in some states,
they have exceeded the number that they

352
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:32,840
intended to let them get too.
Right.

353
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:34,550
And so that's what happened.
Is that when you,

354
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:36,970
cause that's going back to these
environmental realizations.

355
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,830
Sierra club's got a big campaign by save
the wolves and all these organizations

356
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:40,641
save the,
we'll say the lowest,

357
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:42,920
but they're not talking about why wolves
are on the verge of collapse.

358
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:45,230
Again,
it's like we got these species off the

359
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:48,650
endangered species list and now they've
opened up out to hunting in Idaho and

360
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,830
you know at the states that the
population that bloomed again and it's

361
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:54,770
because of the cattle industry is not
that the wolves have exceeded that

362
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,520
ecological capacity,
your carrying capacity of the ecosystem.

363
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:00,920
It's the fact that they're competing
with livestock.

364
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,150
Well they've also reached a number that
have passed the number where the

365
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:06,650
scientists,
the biologist,

366
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:11,150
wildlife biologist deemed there would be
a healthy sustainable population and not

367
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:13,640
be a problem.
And when they get to,

368
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,790
you know what we call a problem,
of course it's when they interfere with

369
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,410
agriculture,
that's when they started eating

370
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,250
livestock.

371
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,860
Exactly.
And people's dogs and occasionally

372
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:23,000
joggers,
you know,

373
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,160
she didn't shit goes wrong with walls,
man.

374
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,550
You really,
the issue is um,

375
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,190
management right now.
What does that mean?

376
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,280
To some people it means like leave
nature alone and let nature sorted out.

377
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,500
But two people in indigenous areas like
um,

378
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,110
you know,
native Americans and people in Canada,

379
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:46,460
like a lot of them rely on moose and
deer to feed themselves.

380
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,500
I,
this is where they get their meat from

381
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,900
and they have to keep both populations
down.

382
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:52,910
If they don't keep wolf populations down
the wolf,

383
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,890
they,
they've already as it is,

384
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:59,891
wolves and bears kill something like 50%
of all calves and the fonts that come

385
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:02,120
out of deer and Moose.
So they do,

386
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,760
since there's no nothing that kills
wolves,

387
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,060
like you have to kill them,
otherwise they get to the point where

388
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,590
have you ever been to like a upstate New
York and drive through those areas where

389
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,770
there's so many deer you have to drive
like 20 miles an hour because at

390
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:18,110
nighttime they just darted in front of
your car like fucking rats.

391
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,800
They're everywhere.
It's,

392
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,170
it's nuts.
How many deer there are in some places.

393
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,590
And one of the reasons for it,
because there's no population control,

394
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:27,110
there's no predators.
And these are areas where there's just

395
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:29,330
not that many people and not that many
people hunting.

396
00:17:29,331 --> 00:17:32,600
So you just get fuck load of these
fucking deer running around everywhere.

397
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:33,471
Yeah.
I mean it's,

398
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:36,470
that is that imbalance.
And that's what we've seen with ecology

399
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,600
around the world.
Indigenous communities have found,

400
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:39,950
I mean,
it's like a hunter gatherer.

401
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:42,530
Communities around the world have shown
that you can live in balance with

402
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:43,550
nature.
Um,

403
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,760
but that's not what we're living today.
Wildlife biologist,

404
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:50,130
they'll do believe that the way to
balance out as you have to keep

405
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,090
populations of predators down.
And that's why if you go back to

406
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:56,610
history,
all the fairy tales,

407
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:58,320
the big bad wolf,
Little Red Riding Hood,

408
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:00,420
all that stuff,
three little pigs were all wolves.

409
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,630
Wolves are fucking dangerous.
They're real dangerous.

410
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,710
And in terms of like recent history and
World War One,

411
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,360
the Russians and the Germans had a cease
fire because they were trying to kill

412
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:15,870
each other and wolves kept killing them.
They were getting so many soldiers

413
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:18,690
killed by wolves.
They literally had a ceasefire and just

414
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:22,110
went on a wolf killing rampage.
That's how scary wolves are.

415
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,420
They can stop armies from killing each
other.

416
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:29,510
So I think we all as compassionate and
people who love nature,

417
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:34,230
we have some beautiful ideas of what
nature is and some beautiful ideas of

418
00:18:34,231 --> 00:18:37,290
how North American populations of
animals should be managed.

419
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:42,291
But Wildlife Biologists look at this
with a very sober I and they're,

420
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:47,930
the reason why they're opening up
hunting for wolves in Idaho and some

421
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:52,410
other areas is not just to protect
agriculture.

422
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,530
It's also to keep these motherfuckers
from getting out of control.

423
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,750
Cause there are wolves.
They're beautiful,

424
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:59,280
they're amazing.
I love them.

425
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:03,210
I love that they're here.
Even if they do jack a giant percentage

426
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:07,200
of the elk population and it's fucking
cool man.

427
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:08,580
Wolves are cool,
you know,

428
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:12,060
to be out in here and see like a fucking
pack of,

429
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:12,894
um,
there's a,

430
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,780
uh,
an electrical living beauty and all

431
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,310
that,
that if it's gone,

432
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:19,710
it's gone forever and you can never
bring it back.

433
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,840
And right now it's here and I think we
should enjoy it.

434
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,120
Be got to keep a fucking eye on that
man.

435
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,150
And when the wildlife biologist,
the sober ones go,

436
00:19:27,151 --> 00:19:28,980
hey,
you've got too many,

437
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,950
you've got a problem,
you've got to open up hunting for them

438
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,370
because if you don't,
they just keep breeding and then what do

439
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:35,910
you do?
And we'll,

440
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,940
so there's this really dangerous
Predator that roams around the planet,

441
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:40,040
walks on two legs,
called him,

442
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:40,590
and I get it.

443
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,960
That's the most dominant species on the,
like that creditor,

444
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,770
no,
they're cool,

445
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,710
but,
but you can't advocate for those.

446
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,730
They've gotten out of control.
You can't eliminate them,

447
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,860
but she can move away from them.
I mean,

448
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:51,150
if,
if human beings,

449
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,960
but the wools kept human beings come in
and start jacking and killing people.

450
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:57,960
That's what's called war.
And that's why we have armies to protect

451
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,600
against human beings when human beings
do get out of control.

452
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,870
But if wolves were cool and they were
hanging around and I squirrels and they

453
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,940
never killed your dog and then ever
threaten your children,

454
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,620
yeah,
it would be a totally different

455
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:08,980
experience.
For sure.

456
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,760
When was the last death of a wolf and
say,

457
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,950
I last year we'll ask now.
Alaska.

458
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:14,900
I mean,
look,

459
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,070
there's not that many people are
wandering through the woods by

460
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:20,470
themselves and wolves are usually aware
then when they see human beings are

461
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:24,270
either in cars or their rifles,
but I've had friends that were stocked

462
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:24,990
by wolves.

463
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,420
I've had friends that were on bow
hunting expeditions where they thought

464
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:30,360
they were going to die because they were
stocked by wolves because wolves,

465
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,120
if they can get away with it,
they will fucking kill you.

466
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,090
Well,
they had bows and our hands to their

467
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,010
listen man,
I ain't gonna kill you.

468
00:20:38,011 --> 00:20:40,980
Ain't going to kill them all.
You might get one wolf you if you're

469
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:43,200
lucky,
but a compound bow and a wolf's running

470
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,520
at you,
good fucking luck.

471
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,740
You've got to set your sight crock
correctly.

472
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,580
You've got to adjust it.
When the wolf's coming in,

473
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,980
get out,
he's speaking like say about Idaho,

474
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,860
you know the,
the wildlife in there is cows,

475
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,450
the kids,
cows and a few wolves,

476
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,111
you know,
and,

477
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:57,810
and,
and the cows take up.

478
00:20:57,811 --> 00:20:59,920
So right.
Take up so much space.

479
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:04,030
If you remove all those fences,
all those millions of miles and fences

480
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:07,330
and millions of acres,
and you let the wolves have that land

481
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:09,940
again,
and then you let the other predators

482
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:12,370
come back in,
then you have a balance going on.

483
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,290
But it's the fences and that's the,
you know,

484
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,450
you talk about the wildlife management,
it's,

485
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,640
it's,
it's bullshit because just by killing

486
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:21,460
some wolves and not addressing the cows
and the fences,

487
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,110
that's,
that's the problem.

488
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,030
Well,
there is certainly a lot of cows,

489
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:26,890
nine home,
but there's also a lot of wild game.

490
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,980
There's a lot of like deer hunting in
Idaho is famous,

491
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,980
like elk hunting in Idaho.
So we one of the best places to go in

492
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:35,860
the world.
So it's not entirely true.

493
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,210
There's a lot of wildlife,
Idaho,

494
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,080
if you've gone to other people,
they have this idea of Idaho is being

495
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:43,510
like sort of this like boring,
flat,

496
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,460
you know,
like the people don't go there.

497
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,960
They think of it as like one of those
states.

498
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:49,150
I'm never going to visit Idaho.
Spectacular.

499
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:50,530
Have you been?
Oh yeah,

500
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,550
that's from the fucking mountains.
It's just a spectacular place.

501
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,090
So there's a lot of wildlife and a lot
of sports men,

502
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,900
hunter people,
and a lot of Fisher people fishing.

503
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,440
Then that's the amazing thing.
I used to live in Alaska and you'd just

504
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:06,260
see Moose everywhere.
Yeah.

505
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:07,590
It's amazing.
Incredible.

506
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,270
Um,
but we still,

507
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,880
we don't have that perspective of that
200 years ago,

508
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,970
the biodiversity and they mount of
animals was that much more,

509
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,730
and 500 years ago was even now much
more,

510
00:22:16,731 --> 00:22:20,250
I'm living in the bay and when we talk
about the indigenous people literally

511
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:23,460
didn't go more than 10 miles from where
their village was because there's so

512
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:24,990
many animals.
There's so much food.

513
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,760
Right.
And we've just eliminated that.

514
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,010
But if you want to have an apple store,
you have to do that.

515
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,080
But also too,
you know,

516
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,160
the wildlife and the Idaho that you're
talking about,

517
00:22:34,161 --> 00:22:36,050
it wasn't,
there's not that much predators.

518
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:39,000
You know,
there's a lot more predators and will

519
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,540
the world's,
but we know they're real big populations

520
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,120
of wolves now the,
but it still,

521
00:22:44,121 --> 00:22:46,130
it says a fraction of what action,
what it used to be.

522
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,110
And then you also like as far as the
West,

523
00:22:48,111 --> 00:22:53,090
the bears and the cougars and the
coyotes that are just getting destroyed.

524
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,420
And people talk about wildlife cause
there's a bunch of Moose and a bunch of

525
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,370
elk and uh,
well the payers,

526
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,010
the bears and cougars and wolves are not
getting,

527
00:23:01,011 --> 00:23:03,920
they're not getting destroyed.
Like they have very strict numbers of

528
00:23:03,921 --> 00:23:07,220
how many you can kill,
whether it's cougars or whether it's

529
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:10,310
bears or whatever.
And bears are extremely hard to kill.

530
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,240
Like in California in particular,
they've made it so it's almost

531
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:15,350
impossible to kill bears.

532
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,510
You can't use bait and you can't use
dogs.

533
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,420
So you have to go find them.
And walls,

534
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,740
I mean,
bears are way smarter than then.

535
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:23,900
You give him credit for it.
They smell things a mile away.

536
00:23:23,901 --> 00:23:25,520
They hear things you're never going to
hear.

537
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,050
And if you start coming through the
woods,

538
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:32,051
they're just kind of not be there.
It's not like there's this overwhelming

539
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,730
idea that we have to go out and decimate
all of the coyotes and all of the bears

540
00:23:37,731 --> 00:23:40,760
and all of the wolves and all of the
cougars that's not going on.

541
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,930
Coyotes are the only one out of that
whole list.

542
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,840
You can shoot as many as you want.
Like people worry about coyotes

543
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,910
encroaching upon urban areas and killing
cats and dogs.

544
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:51,950
And my neighbor's dog was killed by a
coyote.

545
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,390
It's,
it happens all the time,

546
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,210
you know,
but it's not like they're out there

547
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,470
killing all the bears.

548
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,960
Like you're just fucking serious jail
time.

549
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,860
If you kill a bear and you don't have a
tag and you can't even kill them in

550
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:04,830
California,
uh,

551
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,260
cougars,
we can't even kill them.

552
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,320
So mountain lions in California or just
running all over the place.

553
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:10,970
Killing cattle.
Yeah.

554
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,550
The reason though is that we've gotten
to that place.

555
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:16,460
We've decimated this,
the populations to such a low point that

556
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:19,940
now they have to put in these mandates
and controls to try and keep the species

557
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:20,870
alive.
Yeah.

558
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,300
Well that's true.
The reason why they did it though.

559
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,480
It was like when they started killing
all these wolves back in the day when

560
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:29,870
they started poisoning them,
they did it because they were dangerous.

561
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,100
Like they had gotten to high numbers and
they had realized that as soon as people

562
00:24:34,101 --> 00:24:35,850
start stockpiling,
um,

563
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,670
uh,
livestock,

564
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,260
this is an easy place to hit.

565
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,360
And so they would just keep coming back
to them.

566
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,990
I'm sure you've heard of the Russian
super packs of wolves that they've had

567
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,090
issues with in Siberia where these guys,
they're,

568
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,550
you know,
they can't do a damn thing about it

569
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:53,410
because there's a hundred Wolf's tearing
apart a horse and there that's,

570
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,850
that happens.
It does happen with wolves.

571
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,860
So it's,
I don't think this is something,

572
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,220
I see all of your points on nature and I
agree with you 100% on the factory

573
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,720
farming situation,
but I think we have to be real careful

574
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:11,840
when it comes to just letting wildlife
be wild.

575
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,560
I think there's a certain amount of
predators that you can have before

576
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:16,610
things get dangerous.

577
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,980
The big one,
you know,

578
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:22,310
that the film addresses is the,
is the livestock,

579
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:23,690
you know,
and that's what's gotten out of control

580
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:26,840
and that's what's literally destroying
and taking over the wildlife.

581
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:28,610
So if you really concerned about
wildlife,

582
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:32,540
if you're real wildlife person,
the last thing you do was not only

583
00:25:32,541 --> 00:25:34,520
consume,
say factory farm,

584
00:25:34,521 --> 00:25:37,290
but that's a whole thing about our film.
People think it's about factory farm.

585
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,700
We don't even talk about factory farm.
We talk about the grass fed beef,

586
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:43,010
we talk about the organic,
the organic,

587
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:44,330
a free rein,
uh,

588
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:49,100
organic grass fed milk.
And that's what's killing the wildlife.

589
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:50,890
And that's the whole point of what we,
we,

590
00:25:50,891 --> 00:25:54,800
we jumped past the factory farm.
Cause ironically for wildlife,

591
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:58,200
if you care truly about wildlife and
that's what they discuss when we talk to

592
00:25:58,201 --> 00:26:01,880
the animals animal agriculture alliance,
they say,

593
00:26:01,881 --> 00:26:04,340
they say people think we're living in
somewhere 50 years ago,

594
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:04,940
a hundred years ago.

595
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,860
We're not.
We're living in a place with 7 billion

596
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:09,440
people.
The only way to efficiently feed people

597
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:12,080
who want to eat meat is to do,
put them in factory farms,

598
00:26:12,081 --> 00:26:13,670
their factory farms because they're
efficient.

599
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,180
They only take around two acres per cow
or is the grass fed cow?

600
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,890
You're talking about your buddy and
Wisconsin.

601
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:21,590
The guy in our film,
he had cattle in Wisconsin.

602
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:26,150
He said 50 acres,
50 acres for one fucking cow.

603
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,250
One cow.
50 acres.

604
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,350
50 acres.
Think how big that is.

605
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:33,650
No other wildlife can enter that.
So that's the last thing you'd want to

606
00:26:33,651 --> 00:26:36,650
eat is grass fed beef.
The last thing you wanted to be fed is

607
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:38,270
um,
would beating as these,

608
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:41,360
uh,
organic dairy farms as destroying all

609
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:43,100
our water,
water resources,

610
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,810
the rivers and destroying all these
predators.

611
00:26:45,811 --> 00:26:46,650
And these,
uh,

612
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,060
you know,
the other wildlife that you're talking

613
00:26:48,061 --> 00:26:48,300
about.

614
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,230
But the argument would be that when you
have a grass fed cow and it's eating on

615
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:54,570
50 acres,
that's where it's getting its food from.

616
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,510
Whereas if you have a factory raised
animal,

617
00:26:56,511 --> 00:26:59,190
it's getting corn.
That corn is raising independently on

618
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:01,860
some other large area.
Two acres or two acres?

619
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:05,370
Two eight two acres to,
yeah cause you can grow a corn so much

620
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,270
prager and grass fed.
It needs 50 acres that no other horse,

621
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:11,280
no other bear,
no other cougar.

622
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:13,110
Know that all these animals that you're
talking about,

623
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:16,800
no other animal can live on that area.
Is that during the life of the animal?

624
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,850
That's,
that's just period.

625
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:21,280
That's just till slaughter.
That's constantly so mad.

626
00:27:21,281 --> 00:27:23,970
You're on a 50 foot fence.
Nothing else.

627
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,500
What's way more than 50 foot?
50 50 50 acres.

628
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,550
50 acres for one.
So that's the last thing you want to be

629
00:27:29,551 --> 00:27:30,990
eating is grass fed beef.

630
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,640
If you really care about the
environment,

631
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,440
if you really care about wildlife,
you,

632
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,920
you need to say either I fucked the cow,
screw the cow.

633
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,020
The cow is a miserable life.
But you know,

634
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:42,520
I care a lot about more like a,
you know about the,

635
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:46,740
the elk and the Moose and the wolves.
I care more about wildlife than I do

636
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:49,020
about this cow.
You've got to choose one or the other if

637
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:50,850
you're going to do it.
And if you could really care about

638
00:27:50,851 --> 00:27:53,280
wildlife,
you got to say screw the cow.

639
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,390
And then Sco,
uh,

640
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,180
with factory farm.
And that's the whole irony of this whole

641
00:27:57,181 --> 00:28:00,120
grass fed myth that's happening.
Um,

642
00:28:00,121 --> 00:28:02,730
and that's what's,
that's what's kind of ironic about the

643
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:04,620
film and people don't expect that.
Shocking.

644
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:08,430
If human beings right now stopped
growing,

645
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,220
I can for the population in the United
States state of 300 million,

646
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,220
can we feed ourselves right now with how
we're doing it?

647
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,180
Uh,
like business as normal?

648
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,100
Yeah.
Not Sustainably.

649
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,500
Not intro to perpetuity.
Yeah.

650
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,170
Why is that?
Um,

651
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,520
right now,
half of the United States,

652
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:28,550
lower 48 land is designated to raising
animals for food,

653
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,920
whether growing the 50%.
It's crazy.

654
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,600
Yes.
No other wildlife.

655
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,530
Yeah.
And so,

656
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,450
so we've already passed that tipping
point where we're,

657
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,820
we're on ecological collapse so we can't
continue business as normal.

658
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,070
Um,
50% of it.

659
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:44,720
When you say pass that tipping point,
why isn't it sustainable?

660
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,340
Um,
the simple fact that we're draining the

661
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:51,140
aquifers at extreme rates and the uncle,
all aquifer large stock for North

662
00:28:51,141 --> 00:28:53,360
America drops by I think six feet per
year.

663
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:58,340
50% of 55% of all water consumed in the
United States goes into animal

664
00:28:58,341 --> 00:28:59,400
agriculture.
Um,

665
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:02,390
so we're pumping ground waters,
totally unsustainable in California,

666
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,280
you know,
massive drought,

667
00:29:04,281 --> 00:29:05,270
47% of cattle

668
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,010
as opposed to domestic is 5%.
Every single thing you do in your home,

669
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,650
all everything you do in their home is
only 5%.

670
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,770
And why a culture?
55% and we're talking about how we're in

671
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:16,570
a drought,
it's called uh,

672
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,560
um,
you know,

673
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,500
it's clearly the food and water shortage
shortage.

674
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,351
I mean,
what is,

675
00:29:20,351 --> 00:29:21,730
uh,
what's golf courses?

676
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,390
Golf course is less than 2%.
That's still a lot.

677
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:26,410
It's over just for,
sorry,

678
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,161
sorry,
sorry.

679
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:27,860
Just for,

680
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,050
just for California,
for the,

681
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:31,010
for the United States,
it doesn't even register as a percent.

682
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,160
So in California,
5% is for humans.

683
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,460
Just 4% for plastic.
2% is for golf.

684
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,410
Yeah.
That's 50,

685
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,890
55% for,
let's listen.

686
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,010
Let's get rid of important

687
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,780
shit first.
Get rid of the golf,

688
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:44,531
the song.
Okay,

689
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:47,590
now we're down to 2%.
We're doing a way better.

690
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,190
That's your goal.
But you know,

691
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:52,240
that's,
that's a big one.

692
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,740
So water water's John was a big one with
a huge issue.

693
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,800
Alienation technology that's emerging.
Sadly that's really not a solution

694
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:01,690
either because of how much energy goes
into it.

695
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:04,480
And so the greenhouse gas emissions that
are attributed to each gallon of water.

696
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:07,110
How about nuclear son?
I would do some nuclear desalination,

697
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,700
put it right on a fault line.
Um,

698
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:13,170
another part of it is a top soil erosion
leading causes,

699
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,170
topsoil erosion is from hoofed animals
grazing on animal on land that never had

700
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:18,270
hooked animals.
Um,

701
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,960
it's how we tilled soils to grow corn
and soy and Alfalfa.

702
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,100
That's an issue,
right?

703
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:28,270
That you guys also addressed that maybe
some people aren't aware of,

704
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:32,620
is that you can't just keep pulling it
the same plant over and over again from

705
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:33,454
soil.

706
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,130
And when you do that,
you deplete these farmlands.

707
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,001
And there,
you know,

708
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,850
there's a guy named Dr Joel Wallach.
I don't know if you've ever heard of

709
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:41,230
him.
Controversial character,

710
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:43,120
but he had this fascinating book called
dead doctors.

711
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:45,820
Don't lie.
It's all about mineral deficiencies.

712
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,670
And about these farm lands in the United
States had been minerally deficient.

713
00:30:49,671 --> 00:30:52,540
So it's like the 1930s and they'd been
aware of it forever.

714
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:55,120
And so they have to supplement the,
the farm,

715
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,370
the ground with uh,
with minerals.

716
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:59,380
But it's barely enough.
You know,

717
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:01,120
it's not good.
It's not good for your health.

718
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,580
You know,
it's the kind of vegetables that you get

719
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:05,090
from those places.
They're,

720
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:07,030
um,
they're not the healthiest.

721
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,751
That's it.
I mean,

722
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:09,610
there,
some soil scientists are saying that

723
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:11,980
we'll,
we won't have livable top soils in the

724
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:14,980
next 50 years in the United States
because how we farm and they know that's

725
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:15,670
a huge issue.

726
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,121
And then,
you know,

727
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:18,970
what ends up happening to all of that
top soil runs off into streams and

728
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:21,250
rivers and that's when it's flushed out
to the oceans.

729
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,210
We have these massive dead zones that
are completely devoid of life all from,

730
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,010
you know,
the primary cause it because of raising

731
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:28,690
animals that we have the greenhouse
gasses.

732
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,720
And then when 50% is cleared away,
imagine 50% of that land reverts back to

733
00:31:33,911 --> 00:31:35,020
actual wildlife,
you know,

734
00:31:35,021 --> 00:31:40,021
to actual the Fanta growing back then,
now you're talking crazy talking stop

735
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:43,720
factory farming and agriculture.
That's it.

736
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:47,680
Just forest forest and a bunch of holes
just going to be eaten.

737
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:50,950
Bark like that fucking survivor dude.
Um,

738
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,320
yeah,
I don't think that's going to happen,

739
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,810
but I don't think anybody knew that this
had happened.

740
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,680
I think that's part of the problem of a
documentary like this is it catches

741
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:00,010
people.

742
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:00,843
Like what,
what,

743
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,010
what,
how did this happen?

744
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:04,840
You,
you get to that.

745
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:07,010
How did this happen?
Like it's one of the things that I've

746
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:09,550
realized as an adult,
I used to have a bit about this,

747
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:12,460
is there just no grownups,
there's just a bunch of people that got

748
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:14,260
older.
Like when you're a little kid,

749
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:17,350
you think that one day there's going to
be a grownup and you know,

750
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,370
you're,
you're gonna,

751
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,410
you're going to be growing up as well.
And it's gonna make sense.

752
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,100
Like,
oh,

753
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,690
one day I'll,
I'll be all grown up.

754
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,880
But no,
you get grown up and then you realize,

755
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,100
oh,
nobody knows what the fuck is going on

756
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,220
and we're all operating on momentum and
somehow or another,

757
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:35,250
their momentum of these greedy cunts has
created this environment where you can't

758
00:32:36,101 --> 00:32:41,101
even talk about what they're doing
animals and you can't talk about how far

759
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:45,840
gone we are and we're so disconnected.
Most of us are just as long as we can go

760
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:48,440
to the store and buy some food,
we don't have shit to think about.

761
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:49,280
Dude,
okay,

762
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:51,530
fucking game of thrones is on.
I don't have time.

763
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,470
And because of that,
these guys have gotten away with it,

764
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,300
but it's like,
um,

765
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,750
it's like,
like a crime that you're watching.

766
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,590
I mean there's like crime.
It seems like it should be crying.

767
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,350
I mean we are,
we are literally living in the largest

768
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:09,260
mass extinction in the planet's ever
seen 65 million years ago when all the

769
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:12,050
dinosaurs died off is nothing compared
to the rate of extinction we're seeing

770
00:33:12,051 --> 00:33:14,480
right now.
Are Those animals are all losers though.

771
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,030
All losers.
And then also I heard that 90% of

772
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,530
everything that's ever lived as extinct.
Yeah.

773
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,013
Yeah.

774
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,270
Do you want to keep animals around
forever?

775
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:30,080
Are they the perfect animal?
Can't they just go in a new thing comes

776
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,000
in their place?
Al's the one,

777
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:36,110
you know what I'm saying?
I mean intellectually I totally,

778
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,340
I'm not,
not that I'm ever,

779
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,660
but if I was intellectual,
I would say that ultimately,

780
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,710
um,
this whole thing is happening a lot.

781
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,180
Life is taking place and it's moving at
this very strange,

782
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:49,820
bizarre pace.
I think that ethically though,

783
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,030
the one of the bigger issues of the,
the PR maybe,

784
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,610
perhaps the biggest issue is how did we
allow,

785
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,040
um,
laws in place like laws where you can go

786
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:00,680
to jail for filming cruelty,
right?

787
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,870
That doesn't make any sense as
Americans,

788
00:34:02,871 --> 00:34:06,410
as human beings,
as people that are living in the age of

789
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:10,970
information of 2016 to deny,
deny information shouldn't,

790
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:13,070
you know,
if you buy a pair of pants at that pair

791
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:15,380
of pants is made by fucking slaves.
Shouldn't,

792
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:17,900
you know,
if you went to the pair of pants factory

793
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,830
and you saw a guy whipping the people
that were making the pair of pants,

794
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:25,310
wouldn't you want to be aware of that?
So how is it any different?

795
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:27,920
How is it any different?
How is it any different than it's

796
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:31,490
illegal to film someone being cruel to
animals.

797
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,840
That's fucked up

798
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,520
cause people don't want to see it.
People don't want to see what they're

799
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:36,720
doing to their,
their,

800
00:34:36,721 --> 00:34:38,370
you know,
they're eating three times a day.

801
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,200
They don't want to see it.
They don't,

802
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,390
I don't think that's the case.
I think the big thing is,

803
00:34:42,391 --> 00:34:43,650
is that it's money.
It's,

804
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,860
I think it's way more money than it is.
People don't want to see it cause people

805
00:34:46,861 --> 00:34:48,270
say that to all all the time.
They're like,

806
00:34:48,271 --> 00:34:49,890
they see the film,
they feel really inspired.

807
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:51,450
And I'm like well what do we do?
You know,

808
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:52,950
I should write my congressman,
I should,

809
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,500
you know,
talk to my legislators and that's great.

810
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:57,360
If they think that's where the solutions
are going to happen,

811
00:34:57,361 --> 00:34:59,070
can we just do an ice bucket challenge
type thing?

812
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,070
Yeah.
Right now we know,

813
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,390
but it really,
it was going to come down to is that as

814
00:35:03,391 --> 00:35:06,120
long as this industry has money and has
the money to funnel into the government,

815
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,230
things are going to continue.

816
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,450
You know?
And so it's,

817
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,293
you know,
I think it's kind of,

818
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,000
it's undermining the baseline with that
one.

819
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,330
You know,
we toured around with the film and

820
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,173
people talk,
you know,

821
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,720
the politicians are,
are,

822
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:19,860
are the bad ones are the anomia culture
groups are the bad ones,

823
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,720
the government and it,
once again,

824
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:23,700
it goes back to those environmental
groups.

825
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,020
Those are the ones,
you know,

826
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,470
those are the ones that you need to,
they need to be held accountable.

827
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:32,250
That's why they make their billions of
dollars collectively and they're not

828
00:35:32,251 --> 00:35:34,070
doing it.
And that's why they're there.

829
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,770
Here.
I mean that is the one that did animal

830
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,100
agriculture.
There's doing their business,

831
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,390
you know,
they're good businessmen.

832
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:41,070
They got their lobbies,
they got the government,

833
00:35:41,071 --> 00:35:42,750
they got,
they own filtration now to these

834
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,940
environmental groups.
They're doing a good job.

835
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:48,120
So how about pure hold people
accountable to step up what they're

836
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:51,300
doing and hold themselves accountable
whilst rather than saying,

837
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:52,170
screw you,
screw you,

838
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:52,831
screw you.
I'll say,

839
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:54,480
you know,
look in the mirror and what can I do?

840
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:58,530
What can I do to make a difference and
what can I do with these environmental

841
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,900
groups that are actually palpable and
just from the making the film to

842
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:04,280
actually now starting to address it.
So it's,

843
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,820
it's pretty cool they're finally doing
it.

844
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,940
Well,
it's interesting because if you look at

845
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,030
the,
uh,

846
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,840
the agriculture business,
if you look at factory farming business,

847
00:36:11,841 --> 00:36:13,970
like I was a business,
I do look at just the raising of

848
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:17,060
livestock in this country.
There's a gigantic diffusion of

849
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:22,061
responsibility aspect to it all because
each person is one part of this enormous

850
00:36:22,821 --> 00:36:25,760
industry and this industry has existed
before they came along.

851
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,810
So you grow up and it seems normal
because everybody's buying steak at the

852
00:36:29,811 --> 00:36:31,700
butcher shop and everybody's,
you know,

853
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:34,520
getting their cows from this fucking guy
and their milk from this store.

854
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:38,450
And it seems totally normal.
But as you get older,

855
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,880
you become a part of that system
yourself.

856
00:36:40,881 --> 00:36:44,480
You start becoming a farmer,
so you take on a job that is,

857
00:36:44,481 --> 00:36:48,320
is already exists and it's acceptable.
It's a normal part of your community and

858
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:50,510
your culture.
And then you know,

859
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:54,260
you run into some problems and you need
some loans so you get alone and you

860
00:36:54,261 --> 00:36:57,320
expand your business and then you get
involved with lobbyists and the

861
00:36:57,321 --> 00:36:59,120
lobbyists combine and they say,
hey listen,

862
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:03,650
we've passed a new law that makes it
illegal for people to film you while

863
00:37:03,651 --> 00:37:05,090
you're beating the fuck out of your
pigs.

864
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,290
All right,
cool.

865
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,670
I guess shit,
fuck,

866
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,620
whatever.
Long as they can't run me out of

867
00:37:09,621 --> 00:37:10,760
business,
I got loans,

868
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:14,330
I got loans from the fucking government,
I've got to pay off and this is what a

869
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:15,081
lot of it,
what's going on?

870
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:18,530
You're not dealing with individuals that
are evil.

871
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:21,140
You're dealing with almost like an evil
concept.

872
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,440
And the evil concept is to be able to
take life and to turn it into something

873
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:30,850
that's profitable.
I have to take life and to smash it into

874
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:35,330
the small space possible.
Feed it the most fattening shit

875
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:38,240
possible.
Pump it full of whatever chemicals we

876
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:40,970
have that make it grow quicker and then
chop it up.

877
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,440
That's it.
It's like,

878
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,210
and I think it'd be in the film,
we don't demonize people who are

879
00:37:45,211 --> 00:37:47,370
involved in this industry because
they're all trying to,

880
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,721
you know,
pay the bills,

881
00:37:48,721 --> 00:37:50,310
feed their families.
My Dad was a rancher.

882
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:51,480
Yeah.
And so it's like,

883
00:37:51,481 --> 00:37:52,680
this is,
again,

884
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:54,270
these aren't,
these aren't bad people.

885
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,860
These are people caught up in a bad
system.

886
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,640
Yeah.
I think that's a real good point to

887
00:37:57,641 --> 00:37:59,290
make.
It's a real good point to make.

888
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:01,870
Whoever's made those laws is definitely
responsible.

889
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,240
Whoever let that happen.
Why whoa,

890
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,240
that having that put into like this one
thing,

891
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:09,700
if you have people that are fucking,
I've seen people that interrupt

892
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:10,960
restaurants and then,
you know,

893
00:38:10,961 --> 00:38:14,020
you've seen videos of those people,
they get in and they just fucking start

894
00:38:14,021 --> 00:38:17,470
screaming about meat is murder.
And like this is not the place for it.

895
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,790
It's just not.
It's like you're,

896
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,500
you're interrupting people's business.
You,

897
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,220
you're making a moral judgment and you
might be right in your eyes,

898
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:26,510
but in this person's eyes,
you're wrong and you're,

899
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:28,390
you're fucking with their space.
You know,

900
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,370
there's that.

901
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:30,660
Yeah,
but that's what's interesting is,

902
00:38:30,661 --> 00:38:32,370
you know,
when people talk about,

903
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:34,530
you know,
that's a judgment of what other people

904
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:36,100
do.
I don't condone that at all.

905
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,710
But you know,
we discussed in the film is what other

906
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:40,660
people are doing with their choices.
They're saying,

907
00:38:40,661 --> 00:38:41,530
you know,
say someone's like,

908
00:38:41,531 --> 00:38:42,610
Oh,
you're Vegan or vegetarian.

909
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,270
Well,
you know,

910
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,230
I,
I do what I want.

911
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,360
You do what you would want.
Don't judge me.

912
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,021
It's like,
well,

913
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:48,850
you know what,
you're destroying our wildlife.

914
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:52,570
You're destroying my future generation.
I'm paying taxes for your hamburger.

915
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:57,571
Like in the film about the guy who wrote
mean denomix we're paying around on him

916
00:38:57,911 --> 00:39:01,690
on a big Mac.
Was it $7 normally costs,

917
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:05,290
it costs about $3.
It's Pecans 10 it would cost $10.

918
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,980
Yet we are the ones paying the taxes on
this with,

919
00:39:08,981 --> 00:39:10,480
through the,
um,

920
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:13,600
but do you understand that?
Saying that to people and talking to

921
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,910
them like that makes people think that
vegans are annoying,

922
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:20,911
which makes it baffled because
people are annoying.

923
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,940
There's a percentage of people that are
annoying for no,

924
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,200
no getting around it.

925
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,100
And when you ever met somebody who just
started fucking doing something like,

926
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:30,980
you know,
uh,

927
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,410
just started playing tennis and all they
want to do is talk about fucking tennis.

928
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,790
Like Jesus Christ,
man,

929
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,880
enough about fucking tennis.
That's how a lot of people are with

930
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:42,130
everything,
including becoming a Vegan.

931
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,470
You know,
I'm guilty of it with sting.

932
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,290
Things that I get into because when I
get into things,

933
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,900
that's all I want to talk about.
When when people find that moral high

934
00:39:49,901 --> 00:39:53,470
ground in particular,
they tend to fucking plant the flag and

935
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:56,200
blow trumpets.
And so when you say to someone,

936
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:56,771
Hey,
you know,

937
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:58,570
it's not because I'm paying taxes on
your burger.

938
00:39:58,571 --> 00:39:59,171
They're like,
oh dude,

939
00:39:59,171 --> 00:40:00,370
fuck off.
You know,

940
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:02,860
this is not the way to talk to people
cause they don't want to hear it.

941
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:06,220
Even if you,
you're making sense with your facts and

942
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:07,054
your statistics.

943
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,160
Most people,
first of all,

944
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:12,760
if they haven't seen your documentary or
many other documentaries where it's food

945
00:40:12,761 --> 00:40:17,440
inc or whether it's king corn or whether
there's a series of them you can watch

946
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:22,441
it sort of give you this complicated,
multifaceted Pete picture of what's

947
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:26,290
going on with food in this country.
And it's not,

948
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:31,000
it's not good.
It's real bad on all levels because

949
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,250
that's what people really love the film
is that we,

950
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,800
we don't say one thing to anybody.
You know,

951
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:37,840
when you watch the film,
we don't make one judgment.

952
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:41,050
We don't say anything,
not one point in pointing the entire

953
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:42,640
film.
It's just following my journey,

954
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,130
what I personally went through about six
years ago,

955
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,960
because it's all about providing
information.

956
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,460
Even that,
you know,

957
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,290
just providing information about the
taxes,

958
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:50,861
just like,
you know,

959
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:52,420
this is,
this is the truth.

960
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,150
It just know the information and then
make your own choices.

961
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,081
Well,
yeah,

962
00:40:56,081 --> 00:40:58,150
you don't really have to put a spin on
it.

963
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,261
You know,
when you,

964
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:01,700
when you break down the actual numbers
as far as account,

965
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,270
what does,
the other thing that was incredible when

966
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:06,460
you show like how much,
uh,

967
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:11,610
area you need to grow plants versus how
much area you need to grow livestock to

968
00:41:12,131 --> 00:41:13,220
feed the same amount of people.
You know,

969
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,760
it's,
it's about one 600 acre to feed a Vegan

970
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:18,850
for a year and then it's 18 times that
were so skinny.

971
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:19,690
Man,
they look tiny.

972
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,990
Got To have the 300 pound Vegan in here,
man.

973
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,930
These dudes eating pizza all the time.
When you,

974
00:41:25,931 --> 00:41:28,180
when you flying over the country and
look at all the extra spot,

975
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,640
there's a lot of space.
They put the fuck's going on with that

976
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:32,200
space.
Like when you fly over,

977
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,190
it was nothing.
Nothing happened for a long time,

978
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,320
which is actually is kind of amazing.
It's like,

979
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:38,690
especially in the American West,
you'd drive through Nevada and you're

980
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:39,021
like,
oh,

981
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:41,600
there's all this open space.
But then you stopped cows there,

982
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,261
but she stopped.
Yeah.

983
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:44,060
You see,
and there's one cow every hundred acres.

984
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:48,140
And so it's,
this is land that the US has been very

985
00:41:48,141 --> 00:41:51,150
efficient at utilizing this land.
What was going on with

986
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,880
that whole Bundy ranch thing that that
had to do with ranchers and public land

987
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:57,500
for grazing as well.
Right?

988
00:41:57,501 --> 00:42:01,190
Like the one wanted to charge them more
money and so they fucking got together

989
00:42:01,191 --> 00:42:04,580
with her white supremacists,
but allegedly or they rights premises.

990
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,170
Uh,
they're definitely the white elliot.

991
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:12,200
What is the Lgma Mormon might as well,
they're mormons with guns.

992
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:13,680
That's weird.
Guns for [inaudible].

993
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,500
Well,
so when he was the Mormons in the U s we

994
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:18,980
have federal lands that's managed by the
bureau of Land Management Blm.

995
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,600
And that land belongs to all of us.
So you can get a permit to mine on that

996
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:27,650
land.
You can hunt and fish and shoot guns and

997
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,860
ride atvs and all that sort of stuff
because it's just all in by all of us.

998
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,260
Um,
but you can also get a permit to grace

999
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:35,510
livestock.
And so ranchers get these permits,

1000
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:39,230
grave livestock on federal lands.
They pay a fraction of what they would

1001
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,290
normally pay.
So that basically subsidized by all of

1002
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:43,410
us.
Um,

1003
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,520
and so then Bundy and his cronies all
wanted to,

1004
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,780
they say no,
you know,

1005
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,260
they hadn't paid their,
their basically their fees.

1006
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,510
And so blm took their cattle and said,
hey,

1007
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:54,720
you haven't paid,
you know,

1008
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,390
you're,
you're basically stealing from the u s

1009
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,471
citizens,
you know,

1010
00:42:57,471 --> 00:43:01,580
by grazing animals illegally.
And so they did their whole crew and you

1011
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:03,170
know,
trying to overthrow the government

1012
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,580
lemon.
It's just,

1013
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,121
it's nuts.
But,

1014
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:05,841
so again,
this is,

1015
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:08,360
and what's going on right now in Oregon
and same sort of thing is that they,

1016
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,100
they believe that this land is for them
to use because no one else is up there.

1017
00:43:13,101 --> 00:43:14,420
And so they can graze their cattle.
It's like,

1018
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:17,090
well right now they're,
they're cutting down fences and wildlife

1019
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:19,130
refuges to graze cattle.
It's like,

1020
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,740
I mean it's just the,
it doesn't benefit ecology and anyway,

1021
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,510
it doesn't benefit us as people first

1022
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,880
one to call those guys.
Y'all Qaeda something,

1023
00:43:27,881 --> 00:43:31,950
someone did it on the podcast allegedly.
I don't know who it was.

1024
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,040
It sounds like something Tony would say,
but he's not really political,

1025
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,870
so I don't,
I don't think he would be aware of the

1026
00:43:36,871 --> 00:43:39,050
Bundy ranch thing.
All Kinda,

1027
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:41,070
yeah.
But it's been on twitter for a while and

1028
00:43:41,071 --> 00:43:44,610
someone attributed to someone who was a
guest on this show and I don't remember

1029
00:43:44,611 --> 00:43:46,110
who it was.
If it had happened,

1030
00:43:46,111 --> 00:43:48,450
I would like to give them credit cause
it's fucking hilarious.

1031
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:54,870
So those ranchers,
they do have huge power though right now

1032
00:43:54,871 --> 00:43:57,390
there's wild horses in American west
that are being rounded up.

1033
00:43:57,391 --> 00:44:00,270
There's more wild horses in federal
captivity then there are free on the

1034
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:00,811
range.
Yeah,

1035
00:44:00,811 --> 00:44:02,130
I saw that.
That was,

1036
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,650
I found that to be fascinating too.
That was a part of your pot.

1037
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,920
You're a documentary that I totally
didn't expect.

1038
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,240
Yeah.
And that's again,

1039
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:12,450
because of the cattle industry now this
federal land,

1040
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,200
that's when you say that they get,
they get their animals can graze on it

1041
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:18,570
for a fraction of the cost.
Um,

1042
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,190
fraction of the cost of doing it on
private land.

1043
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:24,690
So what you mean exactly,
but federal land is owned by all the

1044
00:44:24,691 --> 00:44:26,910
people,
so shouldn't it be kind of a fraction of

1045
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:31,320
the cost if you do hand out permits,
like if you want to like you could that

1046
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:33,240
land to go camping,
to hike,

1047
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:36,660
to do cause it's all this is,
well Theodore Roosevelt,

1048
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,220
when he was in office,
he was very controversial because one of

1049
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:45,360
the things that he did is he wanted to
protect gigantic chunks of land in this

1050
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:49,950
country and make them public land and
make it so that people will always have

1051
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:52,440
the great outdoors.
You could always go and enjoy these.

1052
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,170
They,
you can't overdeveloped them.

1053
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,420
Like he had a very amazing foresight in
that,

1054
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:59,340
in that regard.
He really saw the future and a lot of

1055
00:44:59,341 --> 00:45:01,950
ways and man,
they'd been trying to fucking sell that

1056
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:05,340
shit off forever.
And as recently as,

1057
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:09,180
I'm just one of those guys running for
President Ryan.

1058
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,060
Paul Ryan said his name.
I believe he was one of the guys that

1059
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:15,750
was ahead of this idea to sell that
land,

1060
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:20,100
to pay off the debt that the United
States allegedly has to some fucking

1061
00:45:20,101 --> 00:45:22,980
invisible man.
I don't even understand the depth that

1062
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:24,150
we have.
Like to who?

1063
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:27,210
Like what's going on the federal bank.
Why is it called the Federal Bank?

1064
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:28,560
Is it a federal thing?
No,

1065
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:29,730
it's not just the name of it.
Oh,

1066
00:45:29,731 --> 00:45:31,440
what the fuck is going on?
We owe,

1067
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:33,060
how much?
How do we owe that much?

1068
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:34,980
Why are we paying them that much?
What are we paying them for?

1069
00:45:34,981 --> 00:45:36,090
Exactly?
They make money.

1070
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,860
What?
We can't make our own fucking money.

1071
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,980
What's going on here?
So you can go down a rabbit hole.

1072
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:43,830
My point.
But if you do go down that rabbit hole,

1073
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,170
like shouldn't those people like,
shouldn't you,

1074
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:48,630
if you have chickens Shinny,
allow your chickens to fucking run

1075
00:45:48,631 --> 00:45:49,464
around on,
on,

1076
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,460
on public land.

1077
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,550
It's,
it's the difference is profiting off of

1078
00:45:52,551 --> 00:45:53,990
it.
So it's if they haven't,

1079
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,780
you know,
they're private industry making money on

1080
00:45:56,781 --> 00:45:58,550
public lands,
but they do pay taxes,

1081
00:45:58,551 --> 00:45:59,360
right?
Uh,

1082
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,650
yeah,
I'm actually taxes.

1083
00:46:00,651 --> 00:46:02,540
So it's not like they do it for free.
No,

1084
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:06,380
but they're heavily subsidized.
But back to that whole big Mac thing,

1085
00:46:06,381 --> 00:46:08,840
you know,
it's $3 but it's really should be around

1086
00:46:08,841 --> 00:46:09,250
10

1087
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:12,010
well sort of because it's all money
that's going to the government,

1088
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,990
right?
It's like they taking money from you.

1089
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,720
Are you really paying taxes from it or
are they paying less taxes?

1090
00:46:16,721 --> 00:46:19,060
You could say that you're paying taxes
for it,

1091
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,710
but it's really that they're paying
less.

1092
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:23,170
That's really what it is actually mean.
Received checks.

1093
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,550
I mean,
so it's like they get like the oil

1094
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:26,200
industry does,
you get subsidized.

1095
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:30,610
So like the corn industry does to huge,
which apparently they can't survive

1096
00:46:30,611 --> 00:46:31,670
without that.
Like,

1097
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,030
I'm gonna pick the hog industry in North
Carolina.

1098
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,950
You know,
we've read a report that said they

1099
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:37,930
wouldn't be able to survive here.
There wasn't people that of subsidies,

1100
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,390
hundreds of millions a year.
So how does that happen?

1101
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,790
Explain key.
I don't know if you can,

1102
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:43,390
can you explain that to me?
I mean,

1103
00:46:43,391 --> 00:46:46,690
so what it is is that the US government
has policies around food.

1104
00:46:46,691 --> 00:46:48,490
That food has to be affordable for a
citizens.

1105
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,590
And that's a,
it's a huge thing.

1106
00:46:49,591 --> 00:46:51,400
Do you want to come to the revolution
from happening?

1107
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,520
Definitely keep people well fed.
And so we have that what it is fucking

1108
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:57,130
government man keeping us fat and lazy.

1109
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,040
Oh well you look at the,
I mean what happened in the Arab spring

1110
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:02,160
that was mostly because of food prices
lease.

1111
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,510
A lot of economists are saying that.
Yeah,

1112
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,670
but so we want to keep food affordable
than the u s so when a industry is

1113
00:47:09,671 --> 00:47:12,070
struggling,
the government stepped in and said,

1114
00:47:12,071 --> 00:47:12,940
hey,
we'll help you out.

1115
00:47:12,941 --> 00:47:15,490
We'll keep food prices artificially low.
So like corn for example,

1116
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,260
have huge,
huge subsidies to it.

1117
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:19,690
70% of corn in the United States has fed
to livestock.

1118
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:22,450
So that subsidy is then passed onto the
livestock industry.

1119
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,240
You have industry,
like a hog industry has,

1120
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,480
you know,
a porcine epidemic where all these

1121
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,980
sounds dying.
And

1122
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,660
so the US government bails him out and
says,

1123
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:32,494
Oh,
here's,

1124
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:35,380
you know,
$10 billion to get your industry out of,

1125
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,790
you know,
out of deep water.

1126
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,560
Uh,
and that stuff happens all the time.

1127
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:41,680
But then that's to make sure that the
food supply stays adequate.

1128
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:42,580
Cause I mean,
right now,

1129
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:47,590
chicken in the United States is cheaper,
like astronomically cheaper than it was

1130
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:53,770
50 years ago even.
And even including inflation,

1131
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,581
I mean it's,
well,

1132
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:55,660
you know,
that was one of,

1133
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:57,480
I believe Roosevelt's,
um,

1134
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,820
I think it was roosevelt with his
campaign slogans was a chicken in every

1135
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:03,460
pot because chickens were like lobster
back then.

1136
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,040
It was like really expensive.
See if that was,

1137
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,800
I think it was Roosevelt,
but that,

1138
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,110
you know,
that animal was a,

1139
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:13,420
a wealthy person's meall,
right?

1140
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,310
Yeah.
And it's become the standard.

1141
00:48:15,311 --> 00:48:17,410
And then the reason for this is it's
artificially low.

1142
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,453
Hoover.
Yeah.

1143
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:20,690
Hoover,
one of those old dead dudes.

1144
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,730
Nothing.
Again,

1145
00:48:22,731 --> 00:48:25,620
that's just one aspect of it is that we,
we,

1146
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:26,980
cause people will say that,
they'd be like,

1147
00:48:26,981 --> 00:48:27,610
well,
you know,

1148
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,860
it's really expensive to eat plant based
foods.

1149
00:48:29,861 --> 00:48:31,330
And you know,
I've traveled around the world,

1150
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:33,910
I've lived around the world.
Plant based foods are the cheapest foods

1151
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:37,720
around the world except for in young,
extreme remote areas where they can't

1152
00:48:37,721 --> 00:48:39,160
grow vegetables.
Um,

1153
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,740
we can,
the reason why you can buy a 99 cent

1154
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,170
hamburger though is because of federal
subsidies,

1155
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,910
you know?
Um,

1156
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:50,680
so subsidies that keep food prices low.
Here's part of the problem.

1157
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:55,770
I agree that it's probably a good idea
to keep food prices low because people

1158
00:48:56,171 --> 00:48:58,300
don't make so much money,
but then you go down that rabbit hole.

1159
00:48:58,301 --> 00:48:58,711
Well,
wow.

1160
00:48:58,711 --> 00:49:00,070
How can people who don't make so much
money?

1161
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,530
Like why,
why is the fucking minimum wage so low?

1162
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:04,570
How the hell you live on that?
You can't live on that.

1163
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,270
You really can't.
And when we interviewed,

1164
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:09,250
uh,
Lauren or Nellis from food empowerment

1165
00:49:09,251 --> 00:49:10,600
project,
and that's one of the things they talk

1166
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:11,670
about is that,
you know,

1167
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:14,920
we look at food deserts that are
happening in and around urban areas.

1168
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:17,890
People can't afford food and it's
because we don't have a living wage.

1169
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,450
It's like you want to solve food
deserts,

1170
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:20,740
please?
He's a food desert.

1171
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,920
Areas that don't have access to fresh
foods.

1172
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:24,611
So it's,
you know,

1173
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:28,390
you look at a community and they're only
grocery store is a liquor store that has

1174
00:49:28,391 --> 00:49:30,400
chips and you know,
junk food.

1175
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,121
Oh,
I see.

1176
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:32,980
So you're just talking about like
neighborhoods,

1177
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:38,140
neighborhoods that have
the weirdest part about going to poor

1178
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,150
neighborhoods is how many fucking liquor
stores,

1179
00:49:40,151 --> 00:49:40,901
man.
That's it.

1180
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:42,130
And so,
and again,

1181
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:45,040
the federal subsidies,
it's like they're not subsidizing

1182
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:46,270
healthy fruits and vegetables.

1183
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,820
It's like you're not,
you know,

1184
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,010
the organic fruits and vegetables
industries aren't heavily subsidized.

1185
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,540
They're not subsides even at all for a
moment.

1186
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:53,600
Most of them,
uh,

1187
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:56,380
they subsidizing really unhealthy foods,
high fructose corn syrup,

1188
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,000
you know,
animal products,

1189
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,010
foods that are actually killing us.
Well,

1190
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:04,060
that was another super disturbing part
of king corn when they went over their

1191
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:07,210
own bodies,
they got their bodies examined and found

1192
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:10,900
out how much of the carbon in their body
had come from corn to there were made

1193
00:50:10,901 --> 00:50:13,540
out of fucking corn.
And then they go through the supermarket

1194
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:17,380
aisle and examine all the different
products to find evidence of corn

1195
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,810
products in them and look,
Ooh,

1196
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:24,460
that's crazy.
It's a har how does happen in a hundred

1197
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,630
years,
in a hundred years.

1198
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,010
I mean,
you go back to 1915

1199
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,380
and everything was normal.
People were eating normal shit,

1200
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,191
you know,
I mean,

1201
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:33,620
people were,
there were the farms where normal people

1202
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:36,080
get their milk delivered to their door
in the morning,

1203
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,050
you know,
in a glass jug that came from a farm.

1204
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:40,730
It was,
it was normal.

1205
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,780
I remember somewhere along the line.
Yeah,

1206
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:45,900
well it really came from,
from War World War One and World War Two

1207
00:50:45,901 --> 00:50:47,420
is they started producing,
you know,

1208
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:52,160
chemical nitrogen for mustard gas and
for chemical weapons and they realize,

1209
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:52,881
Whoa,
you know,

1210
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:55,430
you can grow plants with this stuff.
She knows the story behind that.

1211
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,270
Yeah,
a little bit.

1212
00:50:56,270 --> 00:51:00,650
The hopper method,
that guy became a fucking war criminal.

1213
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:05,930
The guy who invented the nitrogen that's
responsible for like 50% of the fucking

1214
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:10,100
nitrogen in your body right now has come
from the hopper method where they take

1215
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:13,610
it.
He's had some bizarre way of extracting

1216
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:17,090
nitrogen from the air because the air is
very nitrogen rich.

1217
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:20,270
So instead of using fertilizer,
they figured out how to get nitrogen out

1218
00:51:20,271 --> 00:51:22,670
of the fucking air.
This same guy came up with the idea of

1219
00:51:22,671 --> 00:51:27,050
gassing people.
He gassed the allied troops in World War

1220
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:32,051
One and then created xy clon be that
fucking gas that they will,

1221
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:36,800
these xy Klein a and Zyklon b.
And he came up with Zyklon a and he

1222
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:40,190
figured out a way to make it so it has a
very strong smell.

1223
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:44,150
So you would know it was a pesticide so
that you would know that you,

1224
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:45,770
if you smelled it,
get the fuck away from it.

1225
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:50,510
And then the Nazis turned into Zyklon b.
So they just took out whatever element

1226
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:53,000
that gave it a horrible smell.
And he was a Jew.

1227
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,860
And that sick dark story,
it all happened after he was,

1228
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:59,280
well,
he,

1229
00:51:59,281 --> 00:52:01,130
it was,
most of it happened after he was dead,

1230
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:01,851
like the,
uh,

1231
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:04,100
the Nazis using Zyklon b.

1232
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,950
But while he was alive,
they were,

1233
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:07,701
I mean,
he,

1234
00:52:07,701 --> 00:52:11,150
he was like a man without a country and
the United States,

1235
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:13,040
oh,
they'd given him a fucking Nobel prize.

1236
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:15,980
And then they wanted to try him as a war
criminal at the same time.

1237
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:18,040
It was fucking bananas.
He's,

1238
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:21,380
he's one of the weirdest stories ever in
science for sure.

1239
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,870
Yeah.
And that's basically how we got to where

1240
00:52:23,871 --> 00:52:26,660
we are.
It's like you can offer sudden grow corn

1241
00:52:26,661 --> 00:52:29,030
and places that you could never grow
foods before.

1242
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,860
If anybody wants to hear more about
that.

1243
00:52:30,861 --> 00:52:33,200
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but there's a radio lab podcast on it.

1244
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:34,760
Go check it out.
I wish I could remember the name of it,

1245
00:52:34,761 --> 00:52:36,840
but if you google,
what does it do?

1246
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:40,010
You just say something right here.
It's how you solve a problem.

1247
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,980
It wasn't a topper,
that's what's called,

1248
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,340
it might've been more than one,
but I think it was the bad show.

1249
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,620
Hmm.
Yeah.

1250
00:52:48,621 --> 00:52:50,660
I don't know if that's the actual pot.
Either way you'll,

1251
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:53,150
you'll find it folks,
but it's worth listening to if you're

1252
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:54,980
in,
if you haven't heard of radio lab,

1253
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:58,220
it's a fucking amazing podcast for sure.
So that's,

1254
00:52:58,221 --> 00:52:58,940
I mean,
that's,

1255
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,260
he's,
he's a big reason why.

1256
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:01,550
I mean we,
right now we have,

1257
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,620
that's what a lot of population to
explode.

1258
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:06,230
Um,
agriculture really is what lot of

1259
00:53:06,231 --> 00:53:09,230
populations to explode.
It's like once we started cultivating

1260
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,030
plants,
populations,

1261
00:53:11,031 --> 00:53:12,710
you know,
we're not spending 90% of our time

1262
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,690
hunting and gathering.
It's amazing that the pill,

1263
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,840
the birth control pill didn't put up
fucking Denton.

1264
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:20,000
Anything.
Didn't even know there was like throwing

1265
00:53:20,001 --> 00:53:22,130
up some cheese cloth,
try to stop a raging river.

1266
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,040
Ah,
just didn't do Jack Shit.

1267
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,400
They thought like,
oh,

1268
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,220
we're going to have this down now.
All I have does take a pill.

1269
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:30,470
Who,
boy,

1270
00:53:30,471 --> 00:53:32,100
we'll figure that out just in the nick
of time.

1271
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:34,223
That's it,
man.

1272
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:35,520
Magic.
There was no pill.

1273
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,880
Probably be the same amount of people.
Probably stupid as fuck.

1274
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:39,810
Yeah,
I mean the real,

1275
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,580
the real thing.
If you want to control populations,

1276
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:43,590
educate girls,
that's what it comes down to.

1277
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:47,040
Doesn't work Saturdays.
Christ people do educate boys.

1278
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,170
Doesn't matter.
You can't some,

1279
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,300
first of all,
I definitely can't put it on girls cause

1280
00:53:50,301 --> 00:53:52,470
they get horny just like boys get
baffled.

1281
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,760
But in mass,
the whole thing and said,

1282
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:56,370
you look at populations whose birth the
rates are going down.

1283
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,170
It's when they started educating girls
when you,

1284
00:53:58,171 --> 00:54:00,750
when they stop segregating were only
boys were going to school.

1285
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,710
Just one correlation though.
But he also populations go down in

1286
00:54:04,711 --> 00:54:06,840
places that are more,
um,

1287
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:12,030
more advanced and places that a or a
high population areas with more uh,

1288
00:54:12,281 --> 00:54:13,260
affluent people.

1289
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,500
Populations go down.
People were there more career oriented

1290
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:17,820
people,
populations go down.

1291
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,680
Right.
But so there's a lot of different

1292
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:20,640
factors in that,
right?

1293
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,380
Totally.
But they have to be edited on chicks.

1294
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:22,830
Oh No,
no,

1295
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:23,471
no.
I mean it's,

1296
00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:25,230
it's the fact that we got it.
Yeah.

1297
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:27,390
What do we have 50 kids?
Cause you're a fucking whore.

1298
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,730
That's why,
uh,

1299
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,570
well I mean old woman who's got an
education isn't,

1300
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,030
isn't concerned about,
you know,

1301
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,410
having 10 kids.
She's interested in having a career.

1302
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:38,520
Some of them.
Yeah.

1303
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,350
Yeah.
I mean I come from a family of eight

1304
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:41,300
kids,
so it's like,

1305
00:54:41,301 --> 00:54:43,350
yeah,
I'll talk about human population all day

1306
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,260
long.
People are goofing.

1307
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,151
I don't know.
They fucking,

1308
00:54:45,151 --> 00:54:46,980
they make people,
it's just ridiculous.

1309
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:50,370
At this point in time,
sex is the only way to make people like,

1310
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,680
you know,
it should figure out a way better and

1311
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:56,700
more obvious way to make people than do
something that your body is urging you

1312
00:54:56,701 --> 00:54:56,940
to do.

1313
00:54:56,940 --> 00:54:59,610
All the time.
I make what do we amoebas and like God

1314
00:54:59,611 --> 00:55:01,130
damn gets get past that.
Well we,

1315
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,300
I mean that's one of the most important
things,

1316
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:07,950
even as important as factory farming,
figuring out a way where it's completely

1317
00:55:07,951 --> 00:55:10,350
sober and non pleasurable to make a
person

1318
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:14,700
where it's not like a desire like you
bro,

1319
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,630
like you've been holding your breath for
an hour,

1320
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:20,070
just like that's what it's like with
people and they have sex.

1321
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,740
Just such a fucking overwhelming
feeling.

1322
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:26,040
And that's how you make a person that's
pathetic to biological trick of the

1323
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:29,820
highest order.
Mother Nature is a trickster and dirty

1324
00:55:29,821 --> 00:55:31,630
trickster.
Um,

1325
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,240
well,
you know,

1326
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,610
that's at least something that's
addressed and people talk about one,

1327
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:41,430
the thing that I think I find the most
disturbing about all this is how few

1328
00:55:41,431 --> 00:55:45,300
people are aware of the reality of
factory farming.

1329
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:48,180
It sorta seems like a ghost that's
whispered in the woods,

1330
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,650
you know,
factory farming.

1331
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,020
It's fucking terrible.
You know.

1332
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,870
No one really thinks about it too much
because it's not really in our face

1333
00:55:54,871 --> 00:55:58,290
enough.
And the idea that that now is covered by

1334
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:00,990
the Patriot Act,
if you do put it in people's faces that

1335
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:04,380
you mean,
it's essentially like by way of creating

1336
00:56:04,381 --> 00:56:07,410
a law like that,
they've made it so that you'll never

1337
00:56:07,411 --> 00:56:09,690
make it better.
There's no need to make it better.

1338
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,720
And as soon as there's no need to
improve the conditions that these

1339
00:56:12,721 --> 00:56:16,170
animals live under,
then it's just not going to get better.

1340
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,230
If it doesn't help being businesses
don't operate that way,

1341
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,660
it doesn't help profits.
That's not going to get back.

1342
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:23,040
That's the thing though with the,
the,

1343
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,160
you know,
again the film,

1344
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,140
it's not just the factory farms,
it's everything.

1345
00:56:26,141 --> 00:56:30,770
It's with a population as big as it is.
There's just no way to feed this meat

1346
00:56:30,771 --> 00:56:32,410
consumption and dairy with,
uh,

1347
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,490
you know,
the demand.

1348
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:37,120
But is the,
is the ultimately is the move to make

1349
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:39,610
everybody vegetables or the move to make
less people?

1350
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:43,880
Can we just start killing stupid people?
Can we just like have a pole?

1351
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:46,480
How old is your earth?
Usually it's more than 10.

1352
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:49,990
Less than 10,000 years old.
You win a prize and we have them all

1353
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:51,850
show up and just push him into a
volcano.

1354
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:53,470
No.
Well,

1355
00:56:53,471 --> 00:56:56,650
and again,
I don't work,

1356
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,830
but it's like who chooses that some Nazi
shit right there.

1357
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,620
Can't do that.
I mean I had to choose.

1358
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,200
I think it's looking at both of them.
I think you can't ignore population when

1359
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:06,560
talking about sustainability.
They,

1360
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,790
they go hand in hand.
I think having a very honest,

1361
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:13,210
serious conversation about human
population is very important.

1362
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,830
Um,
but there's no real,

1363
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,380
you know,
ethical way to control population that I

1364
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:18,430
know of right now.

1365
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,340
And so we have to figure out,
well how do we feed people while we also

1366
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:22,340
educate them?
I mean,

1367
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,010
cause I take it serious.
I mean I actually,

1368
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:26,650
I had myself sterilized on us 24 years
old could move,

1369
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,281
Dude.
Yeah.

1370
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:29,050
That's one of the best decisions I ever
made in my whole life.

1371
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:30,470
Really?
Yeah.

1372
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,300
Yeah.
Because,

1373
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,000
I mean,
I just looked at the situation,

1374
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:35,860
I'm care about sustainability and ma,
I don't want it to contribute to that.

1375
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,630
I want to live as sustainably as
possible.

1376
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:39,430
And then as far as feeding people,
you know,

1377
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:42,730
one of the scientists on our film,
they said if everyone did just the

1378
00:57:42,731 --> 00:57:44,680
plants,
you know that that would happen is that

1379
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:48,190
you could feed around fifth,
14 15 billion people.

1380
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,070
It's 7 billion.
And the way we're eating right now,

1381
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:55,840
we need two and a half planets.
So right now we're screwed.

1382
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,670
But you know,
it's more than a population issue.

1383
00:57:57,671 --> 00:58:00,580
It's like what the population is doing,
what do people just lose weight?

1384
00:58:00,581 --> 00:58:03,250
People are fat as fuck.
What have everybody just stops eating so

1385
00:58:03,251 --> 00:58:05,380
much?
Can we just drop it drastically?

1386
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:09,040
But if people ate enough to be lean and
healthy like you're supposed to,

1387
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:11,470
what difference in the consumption would
that be?

1388
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,031
I mean,
it's,

1389
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:14,110
it's how many calories go into per
calorie.

1390
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:17,770
So it's a unit of energy that's a big
part of it.

1391
00:58:17,771 --> 00:58:19,210
So that's a part of the
unsustainability.

1392
00:58:19,211 --> 00:58:24,211
So the unsustainable bill on
sustainability is the topsoil is eroded

1393
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:26,680
to the point where,
you know,

1394
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:31,090
there's just not that much that they can
do with it and at certain point in time

1395
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:32,770
is going to become sterile.
So that's one part of the

1396
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:34,450
unsustainability.
And the other part of the

1397
00:58:34,451 --> 00:58:37,870
unsustainability is that the population
is not staying the same and it's

1398
00:58:37,871 --> 00:58:39,070
continuing to jump up.

1399
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,930
I think in my lifetime the United States
has gone up something like 60 million

1400
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,350
plus people just in my lifetime I
wouldn't be as bad as it was more than

1401
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:48,011
that.
It's probably,

1402
00:58:48,011 --> 00:58:49,330
it was more than that.
I'm probably making sure it up.

1403
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:52,480
What do I know?
But I've watched a film the other day

1404
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:55,660
and it was a about um,
the 19,

1405
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:58,690
I guess 1960s,
early 1960s.

1406
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:01,990
And they were driving around and those
old cars and there's fucking nobody on

1407
00:59:01,991 --> 00:59:02,824
the road,
man.

1408
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,710
Like you look at New York City,
you could get anywhere.

1409
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:08,320
You could just drive around and you
watch and you're like,

1410
00:59:08,321 --> 00:59:09,490
wow,
that's crazy.

1411
00:59:09,491 --> 00:59:12,700
Look at everyone just driving like just
no traffic jam.

1412
00:59:12,701 --> 00:59:17,440
Did he even know what a traffic jam was
and then you look 60 years later or

1413
00:59:17,441 --> 00:59:19,330
whatever it is,
it's nuts.

1414
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:22,250
Like now it's just a sworn and then you
would have to extrapolate,

1415
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,460
okay,
well what's going to happen in a hundred

1416
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,810
years from now?
What's that going to be like?

1417
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:28,610
That's it.
I mean they're,

1418
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:31,460
they're expecting 9 billion people by
2050.

1419
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:33,470
Um,
and those are people all,

1420
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,490
all we're going to want to eat and
that's,

1421
00:59:35,491 --> 00:59:37,910
that's a big part of it.
We're going to have like apartment

1422
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:40,650
buildings stacked up with cows and side
of them so that they're going to

1423
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:45,470
eventually do in Japan actually there
really speed that up and they do it.

1424
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,950
That's always fucked up when you have a
ridiculous idea that you don't think

1425
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:50,180
anyone's ever going to do.
And they go,

1426
00:59:50,181 --> 00:59:51,770
oh,
they're already doing that Japanese one

1427
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:52,670
step ahead.
And usually,

1428
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:57,380
well they,
they have that wide you fucking cow

1429
00:59:57,381 --> 01:00:00,230
thing going on,
which I had never understand why people

1430
01:00:00,231 --> 01:00:03,770
want to pay all that money for a cow
that's basically like a job at the hut

1431
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:06,680
cow that's like going to die like
bodies.

1432
01:00:06,681 --> 01:00:08,870
Just riddled with fat.
Like you,

1433
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:12,500
you look at that meet and it's just like
that animal is sick.

1434
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:15,890
That is a sick,
sick animal that's super unhealthy.

1435
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,030
Oh,
it's so juicy though.

1436
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:18,830
It's still delicious.
Just the best.

1437
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:23,720
He's the best.
And the big thing there too though about

1438
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:27,200
like the sustainability is the fact that
we're clearing forests to graze cattle.

1439
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:30,740
Amazon,
you're 91% of the Amazon destruction has

1440
01:00:30,741 --> 01:00:32,960
been in Brazil.
It has been associated with grazing

1441
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:34,010
cattle.
The um,

1442
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,070
the assassinations too.
That was the other thing that you guys

1443
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:40,460
covered when you showed that none who
got taken out by the cattle industry

1444
01:00:40,461 --> 01:00:42,140
allegedly down.
They're like,

1445
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:43,550
Ooh,
that's it.

1446
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,780
I mean the shot a none.
There was,

1447
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:47,870
she was,
she spoke out against the cattle

1448
01:00:47,871 --> 01:00:50,330
industry because they killed was a good
documentary on her.

1449
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,820
Yeah.
Dorothy standing at this thing and like

1450
01:00:52,821 --> 01:00:55,130
the,
the Hitman who was paid by a rancher to

1451
01:00:55,131 --> 01:00:56,900
kill her,
he went to prison for what?

1452
01:00:56,901 --> 01:00:59,240
One year?
Two years tried and then he got laid

1453
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:00,520
off.
It was good documentary on him.

1454
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:05,160
Over a thousand,
over a thousand forced activists have

1455
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:07,540
been killed in Brazil.
And just what the past 20

1456
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,373
years,
20 years.

1457
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,000
And I'm this guy who,
who uh,

1458
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:12,460
paid him off.
Did he get in trouble?

1459
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,710
The guy who paid for this,
a hitman.

1460
01:01:15,010 --> 01:01:16,470
Oh No.
Did they name him?

1461
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:17,390
Yeah.
Yeah,

1462
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:18,910
that documentary.
It was a while ago.

1463
01:01:18,911 --> 01:01:21,190
But it's really good and just shows how
corrupt it is.

1464
01:01:21,191 --> 01:01:22,540
It's crazy.
Yeah.

1465
01:01:22,541 --> 01:01:24,850
Well Brazil,
especially when it comes to poverty,

1466
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,730
it's a totally different situation.
Have you been well,

1467
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:28,301
socks.
So you know,

1468
01:01:28,301 --> 01:01:32,140
this is my fee was my favorite favorite
country and then making this film,

1469
01:01:32,141 --> 01:01:32,950
I was like,
Eh,

1470
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:34,660
I'm not going there for awhile.
It's not,

1471
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,160
you know,
it's not everyone.

1472
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:38,980
It's Brazil's awesome.
I love Brazil.

1473
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,310
It's amazing.
Like,

1474
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:43,150
uh,
I've been there probably six times.

1475
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:48,190
The people are so friendly and so happy
and so proud to be Brazilian.

1476
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:52,480
Like they love that you enjoy Brazil,
but whenever you have poverty,

1477
01:01:52,481 --> 01:01:55,210
man,
he uses a lot of haves and have nots in

1478
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,020
Brazil.

1479
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:59,290
There's a extreme poverty and extreme
wealth and there's,

1480
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,560
it's weird when you go through
neighborhoods and you see really high

1481
01:02:02,561 --> 01:02:04,690
fences with barbed wire around them and
shit.

1482
01:02:04,691 --> 01:02:05,524
And I was like,
Whoa,

1483
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:08,470
like this is a business.
It was kind of crazy.

1484
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,930
Like these,
these like these really nice houses that

1485
01:02:10,931 --> 01:02:12,730
are protected,
like it's a prison,

1486
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:14,860
you know?
It's unfortunate.

1487
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:16,840
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1488
01:02:16,841 --> 01:02:19,270
But the,
the assassinations and everything,

1489
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:21,150
um,
that they're having in Brazil,

1490
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:25,260
it's all people that are trying to stop
the deforestation of the rain forest,

1491
01:02:25,261 --> 01:02:28,060
which is unbelievably devastating to the
tune of how,

1492
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:28,980
what was it,
one acre?

1493
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:29,761
How,
how long?

1494
01:02:29,761 --> 01:02:30,430
A minute.

1495
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:33,910
It's up to one acre every second up to
every second.

1496
01:02:33,911 --> 01:02:36,130
Like a football field.
Think of a whole football field every

1497
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:38,200
second.
Jesus Christ.

1498
01:02:38,201 --> 01:02:41,210
So right now up to,
or it varies too.

1499
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:44,740
It varies depending on the year.
It went down for a few years and then

1500
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:47,890
two acres a second.
And then a few years ago it went down

1501
01:02:47,891 --> 01:02:51,010
and then they just released the,
this law that made it go down.

1502
01:02:51,011 --> 01:02:53,710
Now they're backup back up again to
where it used to be.

1503
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:58,030
That's literally unconceivable and
inconceivable.

1504
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,340
And that's the thing too.
Then you look at the environmental

1505
01:03:00,341 --> 01:03:01,930
organizations,
you would think this would be their

1506
01:03:01,931 --> 01:03:02,980
forefront issue.
You know,

1507
01:03:02,981 --> 01:03:07,420
right now you go to any inbox or
rainforest action organization,

1508
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:12,450
they're going to be talking about palm
oil and pulp in timber and dams and

1509
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:15,760
fossil fuels when still today,
the leading causes of rainforest

1510
01:03:15,761 --> 01:03:17,540
destruction around the world life is
animal.

1511
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:20,340
That's fascinating.
Um,

1512
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:22,740
was anybody willing to talk to you guys
about that?

1513
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,180
Not In the,
not Amazon much.

1514
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:27,960
Amazon Watch Ya,
you know,

1515
01:03:27,961 --> 01:03:30,870
when it was kind of the turn of all
talking to all these groups and then

1516
01:03:30,871 --> 01:03:34,170
finally it was this big long drawn out
thing where she was kind of stumbling,

1517
01:03:34,171 --> 01:03:35,160
stumbling,
stumbling.

1518
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,020
Finally she said,
you know what?

1519
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:39,660
You're right there.
This is,

1520
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:43,620
this is screwed up and this is the
reason why we're not talking about it.

1521
01:03:43,621 --> 01:03:44,131
And then,
you know,

1522
01:03:44,131 --> 01:03:46,980
these interviews are two hours long and
sometimes we go to these,

1523
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:50,400
go to these screenings and you have
someone from Greenpeace or Sierra Club

1524
01:03:50,401 --> 01:03:50,971
and they say,
Oh,

1525
01:03:50,971 --> 01:03:52,980
you guys manipulated the editing of the
film.

1526
01:03:52,981 --> 01:03:53,814
It's like,
you know,

1527
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:56,400
you watched the full edits to the film.
It's more bizarre.

1528
01:03:56,401 --> 01:03:58,880
It's more of a cover up.
So it was more fun.

1529
01:03:58,881 --> 01:03:59,714
You have that.

1530
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:03,420
Who was accusing of us was accusing you
guys of manipulating the data all the

1531
01:04:03,421 --> 01:04:04,460
time.
When we go on tour,

1532
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,120
some will stand up and they'll say,
they'll say the,

1533
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,060
the edits of our interviews,
you know,

1534
01:04:09,061 --> 01:04:11,490
that was the most bizarre part and the
most funniest part,

1535
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:16,410
they say you manipulated the edits to
make it the most funny or the most,

1536
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,700
you know,
cover up and said,

1537
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,830
say no.
If you see the longer edit to that,

1538
01:04:19,831 --> 01:04:22,620
it's worse than it appears.
Why don't you guys just put the long

1539
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,680
edits on Youtube?
We're going to do,

1540
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:25,950
we've been doing that,
but we,

1541
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:27,780
uh,
we've been working on other stuff,

1542
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,250
so,
whew.

1543
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:31,580
Um,
it's just,

1544
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:33,250
it's very,
uh,

1545
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:37,490
very disconcerting to think that these
animal rights at are these,

1546
01:04:37,491 --> 01:04:38,100
um,
uh,

1547
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,820
green peace activists and these
environmental activists and all these

1548
01:04:40,821 --> 01:04:44,590
different people that are involved in
this campaign to save the rain forest

1549
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:48,710
are also maybe even taking money from,

1550
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:52,000
you mean animal agriculture?
Is that,

1551
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,700
is that,
I mean her to say?

1552
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:54,950
Yeah,
I mean there's definitely,

1553
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:58,670
there's links to shell that these,
some of these organizations do except

1554
01:04:58,671 --> 01:05:02,210
money straight from the industry.
And World Wildlife Fund doesn't make any

1555
01:05:02,211 --> 01:05:04,280
qualms about it.
They may get money from the,

1556
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,170
uh,
beef industry.

1557
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:09,230
Um,
but then you can also look at,

1558
01:05:09,231 --> 01:05:10,370
yeah,
who's on their board,

1559
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:11,810
you know,
what's their background?

1560
01:05:11,811 --> 01:05:12,561
And it's,
and it's,

1561
01:05:12,561 --> 01:05:14,300
you know,
to be honest in all fairness is that

1562
01:05:14,301 --> 01:05:15,830
it's,
it's such a massive industry.

1563
01:05:15,831 --> 01:05:18,190
It's hard not to be associated them in
some way or another.

1564
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:19,211
Um,
but you know,

1565
01:05:19,211 --> 01:05:22,690
Greenpeace's largest grant on record
comes from a guy who raises and

1566
01:05:22,691 --> 01:05:25,300
slaughters 40,000 animals for his
restaurants every year.

1567
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:28,300
So it's like,
how are you going to speak at bad about

1568
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:30,760
an industry when one of your huge donors
is doing that?

1569
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,960
Now,
how do you decipher that?

1570
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:36,520
Because do you say,
well,

1571
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:40,660
maybe this guy who slaughters all these
animals for his restaurants that Ted

1572
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:41,340
Turner.
Yup.

1573
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:44,580
I knew it.
Um,

1574
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,560
maybe he really is legit.
That's why I said Ted Turner,

1575
01:05:47,561 --> 01:05:50,350
because I think he legitimately does
have concerns about the environment.

1576
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:52,900
It seems like a guy who really loves the
great outdoors.

1577
01:05:52,901 --> 01:05:55,900
He's massive ranches and it goes to them
and shit.

1578
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,940
I mean,
I don't doubt that these organizations

1579
01:05:57,941 --> 01:05:59,990
really believe in what they're doing.
They,

1580
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:02,140
they want to help the environment and
they do good work.

1581
01:06:02,141 --> 01:06:03,850
You know,
it's like the reason why we have a,

1582
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:06,670
I think a big part of why we have an
environmental movement in the United

1583
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:09,880
States is because of Greenpeace and
they've opened doors to be able to talk

1584
01:06:09,881 --> 01:06:10,980
about things and,
and I'm,

1585
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:12,040
I'm so thankful for that.

1586
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,630
But to fail to talk about,
you know,

1587
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:15,140
kip has an analogy about,
you know,

1588
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,370
the house on fire basically.
You know,

1589
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:20,890
imagine a house that's burning on fire
and he's organization groups.

1590
01:06:20,891 --> 01:06:22,360
You know,
the Sierra Club's writing for a section

1591
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:23,500
at work,
at green pieces.

1592
01:06:23,501 --> 01:06:27,580
They come houses on fire.
One of them comes and cleans the window

1593
01:06:27,581 --> 01:06:28,420
cause it's a little,
you know,

1594
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:32,100
little dusty and other one dust counter
top one though those leaky faucet.

1595
01:06:32,101 --> 01:06:35,620
And meanwhile there's a bonfire in the
middle of the House that's burning the

1596
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:37,160
house down.
That's a great analogy.

1597
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:39,670
And that's essentially what's happening.
Yeah.

1598
01:06:39,671 --> 01:06:41,980
So I think they,
they are doing good work,

1599
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,260
but they're failing to address the most
destructive industry.

1600
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,250
Ted Turner's scenario.
Does he have you say he slaughters all

1601
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:50,710
these animals for his restaurants?
Are they his own animals?

1602
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:52,360
He has.
Does he have ranches and he grows these

1603
01:06:52,361 --> 01:06:52,900
cattle?

1604
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:53,350
Yeah.
He said,

1605
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,810
I think the second largest land owner in
the United States.

1606
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:58,120
Um,
and so he raises really?

1607
01:06:58,170 --> 01:06:59,220
Yeah.
Wow.

1608
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,480
Um,
and so therefore his restaurants,

1609
01:07:01,481 --> 01:07:02,500
the,
whatever they're called,

1610
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:05,370
Ted's tag,
it's called teds and they aren't all

1611
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:06,550
wildlife preserves,
you know,

1612
01:07:06,551 --> 01:07:10,120
their cow preserves.
So when he's growing these,

1613
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:12,880
these cows,
like is he doing it in a sustainable way

1614
01:07:12,881 --> 01:07:15,130
and his property at least,
I mean he was he doing it.

1615
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:17,770
He raises buffalo as well.
And,

1616
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:20,650
and if you,
people are going to raise animals for

1617
01:07:20,651 --> 01:07:23,230
consumption,
they should be raising native species.

1618
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,550
I mean,
I don't think people should be raising

1619
01:07:24,551 --> 01:07:28,510
animals is just super inefficient.
It's like 16 pounds of input to get one

1620
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,680
pound out.
Um,

1621
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:33,250
but you could at least do an indigenous
species.

1622
01:07:33,251 --> 01:07:35,530
And so cow nonindigenous where's it come
from?

1623
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,850
Asia.
Really?

1624
01:07:36,851 --> 01:07:38,380
American cows confirmation.
Yeah.

1625
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:40,170
Goddammit.
Think about that.

1626
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:43,170
Texans greet and Chinese food.
I know what you think.

1627
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:47,920
You think Merck and we'll sit down hill
at stake and then pure for pure

1628
01:07:47,921 --> 01:07:49,210
sustainability,
the most,

1629
01:07:49,211 --> 01:07:52,360
uh,
the most sustainable way to grow is

1630
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:54,220
through factory farms.
If you're just talking,

1631
01:07:54,221 --> 01:07:54,701
not,
you know,

1632
01:07:54,701 --> 01:07:58,240
not efficiency,
nobody factory farms buffalo,

1633
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:03,300
that seems like sin.
It's weird just seeing them in

1634
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:04,630
supermarkets,
you know,

1635
01:08:04,631 --> 01:08:07,720
you can buy Bison.
So bizarre wasn't that on the only one

1636
01:08:07,721 --> 01:08:09,960
thing almost dead?
The ones that was most,

1637
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:13,000
well,
the most bizarre thing was how many,

1638
01:08:13,001 --> 01:08:14,790
you know,
there's a guy named Dan Flores that

1639
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,280
wrote a thing about bison

1640
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,590
ecology.
It's really fascinating and I'm kind of

1641
01:08:18,591 --> 01:08:19,730
get him on the podcast,
but,

1642
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:25,140
um,
his ascertation is that the native

1643
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,650
Americans,
just with the introduction of firearms

1644
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,530
and horses,
they would have probably wiped the

1645
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:33,020
buffalo out.
Even like,

1646
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:33,831
Gee,
you know,

1647
01:08:33,831 --> 01:08:38,831
without the Americans are without the
Europeans landing and becoming a part of

1648
01:08:39,321 --> 01:08:40,880
this.
But it wouldn't happen as quick cause

1649
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:43,670
the,
the overall slaughter was fueled by

1650
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:44,331
money.
You know,

1651
01:08:44,331 --> 01:08:44,790
the,
the,

1652
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:46,220
the hide slaughter,
I mean,

1653
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,320
the amount of buffalo hides they were
getting,

1654
01:08:48,321 --> 01:08:50,990
and this is insane,
mean we've all seen the stacks of bones.

1655
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:51,830
But,
uh,

1656
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:53,360
he believes that the,
um,

1657
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:58,070
what had happened was there had been a
massive decline in the population of

1658
01:08:58,071 --> 01:09:00,320
native Americans.
And during that time,

1659
01:09:00,321 --> 01:09:04,520
the buffalo grew to staggering
proportions that before that they had

1660
01:09:04,521 --> 01:09:06,650
kind of kept them in check more cause I
had eaten them.

1661
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:10,640
But there was like a,
I believe there's like a 90% decline in

1662
01:09:10,641 --> 01:09:15,230
the populations of native Americans that
probably was linked to Europeans moving

1663
01:09:15,231 --> 01:09:18,380
here and giving them diseases that they
didn't have immune systems for.

1664
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:20,420
Fascinating.
Fascinating subject,

1665
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:23,360
obviously off of yeah,
but I mean guns,

1666
01:09:23,361 --> 01:09:24,980
germs and steel.
That's an awesome book.

1667
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:27,080
Same similar sort of thing where it
talks about that,

1668
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:30,610
that introduce technology to a
population and see what happens.

1669
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:31,551
Well,
his,

1670
01:09:31,551 --> 01:09:32,550
um,
Flores is,

1671
01:09:32,551 --> 01:09:35,570
is it backs historical,
a recollections of,

1672
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:38,480
um,
different people who had come before the

1673
01:09:38,481 --> 01:09:41,630
decline in native American populations
and they really didn't discuss bison

1674
01:09:41,631 --> 01:09:43,700
herds.
They didn't ever seen like these million

1675
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:44,900
herds of Bison.
Like,

1676
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,280
you know,
they described in the,

1677
01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:48,470
you know,
the 17 hundreds of people had gotten

1678
01:09:48,471 --> 01:09:50,150
there and be like,
what the fuck?

1679
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:53,840
Just thunderous hills.
So that was kind of an imbalanced as

1680
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:55,940
well.
So our idea of that being like,

1681
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:57,980
it used to be a million buffalo,
eh,

1682
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:00,200
for a very short period of time.
And that was a mistake.

1683
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:02,570
And that was just a,
an imbalance that probably would have

1684
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:05,720
been corrected by the introduction of
guns and horseback.

1685
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,730
But Buffalo,
Dave,

1686
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,500
even more grass and who require even
more land than cow do.

1687
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:13,160
Right.
Yeah.

1688
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:14,120
Um,
I,

1689
01:10:14,121 --> 01:10:15,920
you know,
I don't know if I bet efficiency like

1690
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:18,620
per pound of meat they put on their
bones,

1691
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:20,960
you know,
for what they consume I counts are

1692
01:10:20,961 --> 01:10:21,980
really efficient.
Um,

1693
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:24,430
but they just eat different things too.
It's like they float too.

1694
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:26,180
Yeah.
They call evolved with the grasses.

1695
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:28,720
I mean there's a reason why they call it
buffalo grass is cause buffalo's

1696
01:10:28,721 --> 01:10:30,140
actually he never heard of buffalo
grass.

1697
01:10:30,141 --> 01:10:31,400
Yeah.
So that's like what the prayer is used

1698
01:10:31,401 --> 01:10:35,540
to be covered in was the buffalo wings,
different

1699
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:40,040
tiny little buffaloes.
Miniature Buffalo.

1700
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:43,040
There was a fucking episode of the
Jessica Simpson Show.

1701
01:10:43,041 --> 01:10:44,960
Remember she's delivered that dude
where,

1702
01:10:44,961 --> 01:10:46,490
uh,
she was trying to figure out how they

1703
01:10:46,491 --> 01:10:49,010
got wings from Buffalo,
allegedly.

1704
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:51,620
She might've been playing dumb.
I Dunno.

1705
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,300
Um,
it'd be fucking cool though.

1706
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:54,020
Buffalo.
Well,

1707
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,790
buffalo are dangerous as fuck too,
by the way,

1708
01:10:55,791 --> 01:10:57,740
ladies and gentlemen,
if you account or buffalo,

1709
01:10:57,741 --> 01:11:00,260
especially during the Rut in a yellow
stone,

1710
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,050
get the fuck away from them.
They run you over,

1711
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:04,730
they'll kill you.
They think you're going to kill them.

1712
01:11:04,731 --> 01:11:06,290
They're going to kill you.
They're wild animals.

1713
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:08,750
Like people get fucked up by buffalo all
the time.

1714
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,200
There's a hilarious video I saw this guy
wants to get clothes.

1715
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,210
She's got to take a of these buffalo and
the buffalo just sees him.

1716
01:11:15,211 --> 01:11:15,900
Turns out,
he was like,

1717
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,010
oh,
are you fucking kidding me?

1718
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:20,190
And just charges at him to the man.
When I lived in Alaska,

1719
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:23,130
you'd see tourists all the time going up
to bull Moose.

1720
01:11:23,131 --> 01:11:24,640
Just think they're going to get a
picture of me.

1721
01:11:24,641 --> 01:11:26,910
And literally they seen people walk up
to black bears just like,

1722
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:28,320
oh,
like they're in a zoo.

1723
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:29,131
Yeah.
People does not,

1724
01:11:29,131 --> 01:11:30,660
like,
people don't really understand the fact

1725
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:33,360
that animals,
and that's really kind of all animals

1726
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:36,150
are potentially very dangerous,
but particularly wild animals.

1727
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,470
Well,
including people.

1728
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:38,340
By the way,
you know,

1729
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:41,280
we're just so used to this civil
environment where people can come up to

1730
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:44,340
other people and say hi bears don't just
come up to bears and say hi.

1731
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:47,640
They have to know the bear.
They have to be reasonably sure the bear

1732
01:11:47,641 --> 01:11:50,490
is not going to bite them in the face
and they get to know each other.

1733
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,500
You know,
when a new bear comes into town,

1734
01:11:52,501 --> 01:11:54,570
it's a fucking war going on.
It's chaos.

1735
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:58,830
Just like how it used to be with people.
So that's the world that a fucking moves

1736
01:11:58,831 --> 01:12:01,410
is living in.
You just can't walk up on that Moose

1737
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:03,390
Dude that Louis is fighting off bears
all the time.

1738
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:06,270
I mean,
imagine being a Moose in Alaska and you

1739
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:10,440
have to deal with some potentially 10 11
foot tall,

1740
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:15,030
gigantic furry monster that just eats
everything he can.

1741
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:16,530
I mean,
what does a bear weigh?

1742
01:12:16,531 --> 01:12:20,400
A thousand fucking pounds a grizzly and
you think of that thing is just running

1743
01:12:20,401 --> 01:12:23,490
around looking for you.
You'd be on edge build little on edge.

1744
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,600
So I'm fucking fat guy with a Las Vegas
visor on comes at you.

1745
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,850
It lives iphone.
Fuck him.

1746
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:32,370
They're going to trample that dude.
I think you're cute.

1747
01:12:32,371 --> 01:12:33,870
You're going to take a selfie with me,
bitch.

1748
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:35,930
I live in a different world.
Motherfucker.

1749
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:37,240
Trump.
Yeah,

1750
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,240
they're,
they're gigantic man.

1751
01:12:39,241 --> 01:12:41,460
I saw my first moose couple of years ago
in Alaska.

1752
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,840
I just couldn't believe it,
man.

1753
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:44,310
I just couldn't believe how big they
were.

1754
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:45,510
It's a,
yeah,

1755
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,580
it's Saturday.
I was living in the interior about a

1756
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:50,100
hundred miles from uh,
Fairbank's and he's like you some,

1757
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:51,530
you see a bull moose,
you know,

1758
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:54,330
mature Bull Moose.
You can feel like you'd walk right under

1759
01:12:54,331 --> 01:12:54,991
his stomach.
Yeah.

1760
01:12:54,991 --> 01:12:55,980
You probably could.
Yeah.

1761
01:12:56,190 --> 01:12:58,050
People have driven under them in car
accidents.

1762
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:03,120
They made it underneath the car.
Just clip the roof on the underbelly of

1763
01:13:03,121 --> 01:13:04,800
the car.
Fuck.

1764
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:07,230
Or an underbelly of the Moose.
Bison.

1765
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:12,000
Bison in person is a faces about as tall
as you are.

1766
01:13:12,001 --> 01:13:13,290
Yeah.
It's crazy.

1767
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:16,830
They're monstrous.
Monstrously huge and so fucking cool

1768
01:13:16,831 --> 01:13:20,460
looking at when you see a bison,
they seem like some star wars animal.

1769
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,860
It really does seem like something from
star wars,

1770
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,550
like with his crazy lion kind of main
thing going on.

1771
01:13:26,551 --> 01:13:29,490
You know they have the extra for in the
front and like what?

1772
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:33,720
Like why did you grow so big?
Why did nature want you to be so fucking

1773
01:13:33,721 --> 01:13:37,230
enormous?
Just step destroyer of grasses and

1774
01:13:37,231 --> 01:13:38,590
either of grasses.
That's crazy.

1775
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,580
Look at that thing.
Fuck.

1776
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:44,700
I mean if that wasn't real and you saw
that in a movie,

1777
01:13:44,701 --> 01:13:46,920
that's a total star wars monster in
itself,

1778
01:13:46,921 --> 01:13:47,550
right?

1779
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:52,290
Like you would see like some dude with
like black motorcycle goggles on it with

1780
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:56,280
a metal helmet riding it.
It's going over the top of the hill.

1781
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:58,500
And then what is the only thing he eats
his plants.

1782
01:13:58,501 --> 01:14:00,570
That's as crazy now it's like all the
skinny,

1783
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,400
skinny a plant jokes,
but it's,

1784
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:04,440
then you've got the gorillas and these
huge,

1785
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:06,630
massive strong animal.
Sure.

1786
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:07,890
Elk,
Moose,

1787
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:10,080
all of them eating grasses.
Yeah.

1788
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,940
Gorillas are real weird because they're
not just gigantic,

1789
01:14:12,941 --> 01:14:15,880
but they also have fangs and they're the
per pound per pound.

1790
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:19,090
The strongest animal in the whole world
eaten Broccoli and shit.

1791
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:22,540
Yeah.
It's,

1792
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,030
um,
it's very strange when you see the d the

1793
01:14:25,031 --> 01:14:28,990
diversity of wildlife and you have to
think that all of this stuff,

1794
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:33,880
if you believe that evolution bullshit,
all this stuff came from single celled

1795
01:14:33,881 --> 01:14:35,710
organisms and eventually,
you know,

1796
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:41,310
evolved and changed and mutated and
adapted and random mutation pressure

1797
01:14:43,781 --> 01:14:46,240
from the environment and then they
became what they are now.

1798
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:51,190
This is what a bizarre world we live in.
And I think that that's also a big part

1799
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:56,110
of what's wrong with factory farming and
what's wrong with our disconnection from

1800
01:14:56,111 --> 01:15:00,190
our food is that we're very rarely
around animals.

1801
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,660
And to the point where I think most
human beings think of it as like people

1802
01:15:04,661 --> 01:15:07,150
and animals,
but it's not,

1803
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:09,760
it's life.
It's all over the place.

1804
01:15:09,950 --> 01:15:12,880
It was a lot of different life.
We've just cleared off most of it to

1805
01:15:12,881 --> 01:15:15,700
like all you see is like birds and
squirrels and you don't even think of

1806
01:15:15,701 --> 01:15:18,850
them cause they're around so often
though as another fucking bird shit on

1807
01:15:18,851 --> 01:15:21,050
my car asshole,
he drive off.

1808
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:25,500
But when you're around wild life,
like if you've ever been in the woods

1809
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:26,920
and seeing like,
you know,

1810
01:15:26,921 --> 01:15:31,921
a population of Fox walk by and you see
like the mama bear or in a couple of

1811
01:15:32,351 --> 01:15:36,040
cubs and you see these kinds of animals
in the wild and you realize like,

1812
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:37,630
these fuckers are here.
They are.

1813
01:15:37,631 --> 01:15:38,890
They've been here,
they're staying,

1814
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:40,720
they breed here.
This is normal.

1815
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:45,870
They've been this way since Lewis and
Clark like hundreds of years ago.

1816
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:48,280
They were just like this and they're
just like this right now.

1817
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:52,000
We just never go into that world.
So we forget that worlds even there.

1818
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:54,230
That's it.
I think we have a huge disconnect.

1819
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:55,011
You know,
as you said,

1820
01:15:55,011 --> 01:15:57,050
from our food and from the natural
world.

1821
01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:01,340
It's like we live in concrete boxes and
we drive in cars and it's like we forget

1822
01:16:01,341 --> 01:16:03,560
that we are part of this whole system.
Um,

1823
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:05,490
and that's,
I think a big part of what cowspiracy

1824
01:16:05,510 --> 01:16:07,910
does too,
is that remind people that you're part

1825
01:16:07,911 --> 01:16:08,830
of the system.
You know,

1826
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,970
whether you want to or not.
Like you're part of the system.

1827
01:16:10,971 --> 01:16:12,740
You're dependent upon the atmosphere for
your air.

1828
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:14,780
You're dependent upon the ground for
your water.

1829
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:17,170
It's like you're presenting on the soil
for your food.

1830
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,760
It's like this is it.
There's no way getting out of it.

1831
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:22,850
Well,
this is the first time I think our

1832
01:16:22,851 --> 01:16:24,680
generation,
or I'm older than you guys,

1833
01:16:24,681 --> 01:16:25,670
I think,
um,

1834
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:30,050
the generations of the last 20 years,
the people that are alive today,

1835
01:16:30,051 --> 01:16:32,830
let's just call it the people that are
awake and alive and paying attention

1836
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:33,350
today.

1837
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:38,300
This is really probably unprecedented
amount of understanding of the

1838
01:16:38,301 --> 01:16:40,320
consequences of the way we're living.
I don't,

1839
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,920
I really don't think it's ever been like
this before.

1840
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:48,100
We're so many people are so aware of
what has been set up and this system

1841
01:16:48,111 --> 01:16:51,050
that we're born into,
the system that we just,

1842
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:51,890
we,
you know,

1843
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:54,610
we went to school and we got to high
school and we got jobs and we became

1844
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:55,401
part of it.
And we,

1845
01:16:55,401 --> 01:16:58,040
we,
and then as adults we start looking

1846
01:16:58,041 --> 01:17:01,580
around and going,
who fucking design the Democrats and the

1847
01:17:01,581 --> 01:17:02,630
Republicans?
That's it.

1848
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,740
It's the only these fucking two people,
the only people and their idea,

1849
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:10,070
why is this fucking wear this meat
sandwich come from?

1850
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,940
How can I just go through this spot and
I could reach my hand out my metal box

1851
01:17:13,941 --> 01:17:18,200
with rubber tires and can this guy paper
and he gives me a ground meat sandwich.

1852
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:21,800
I just drive off
that this cool.

1853
01:17:21,801 --> 01:17:22,460
The uh,
you know,

1854
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:26,540
the film ends as a real inspiring ways
that people are turning on now.

1855
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:28,790
You know,
so it's something just in the past

1856
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:29,780
couple of years you can just kind of
feel it.

1857
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:32,810
Like this transformation of just
information passes so fast.

1858
01:17:32,811 --> 01:17:35,000
You can't hide things from people.
Well,

1859
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:39,080
do you think that,
do you worry at all that something like

1860
01:17:39,081 --> 01:17:42,170
that Patriot Act thing could be somehow
or another applied to people make

1861
01:17:42,171 --> 01:17:45,260
documentaries that expose?
We always like that.

1862
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:47,390
When we made the film,
it was kind of how it went down.

1863
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,224
You know,
when I,

1864
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:50,960
we really took a step back,
we'd,

1865
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:52,660
after we talked to Howard Lyman that
the,

1866
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:53,930
the rancher,
he's scared,

1867
01:17:53,931 --> 01:17:54,950
he's scared the shit out of us.

1868
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:57,620
He really did.
And we were talking once we released the

1869
01:17:57,621 --> 01:17:59,540
film,
should we go to Cuba for a couple of

1870
01:17:59,540 --> 01:17:59,901
months?
We were,

1871
01:17:59,901 --> 01:18:02,180
so we was,
he scared us and he says,

1872
01:18:02,181 --> 01:18:02,931
you know,
watch out.

1873
01:18:02,931 --> 01:18:04,310
You know,
this is serious shit.

1874
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,240
And then so we realized finally,
you know,

1875
01:18:08,241 --> 01:18:09,560
what are we going to do if we just
stand,

1876
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:11,300
stand back and do nothing,
stay silent,

1877
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:12,560
we're all screwed.
You know,

1878
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:15,500
the,
the fear of not doing something has to

1879
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:18,260
supersede the fear of one individual
doing something.

1880
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:20,930
You know,
we have to step up and all do something

1881
01:18:20,931 --> 01:18:23,210
because if not,
what are we going to live in a world

1882
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:24,590
full of cows,
you know?

1883
01:18:24,591 --> 01:18:27,590
And that's in a monoculture of cows and
destruction and we're not going to be

1884
01:18:27,591 --> 01:18:29,300
run anyway.
So it was scary.

1885
01:18:29,301 --> 01:18:31,010
But now at the point it's been,
you know,

1886
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:34,010
a year and a half since we released it
and we're already on door,

1887
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:34,880
uh,
you know,

1888
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,370
or new new project coming along right
now too.

1889
01:18:37,371 --> 01:18:39,830
So,
so you haven't had any blow back at all

1890
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:42,620
when we released the film,
because we originally,

1891
01:18:42,621 --> 01:18:46,760
we did a crowd funding campaign,
we released the film and a week after we

1892
01:18:46,761 --> 01:18:49,100
premiered it,
beef magazine did a write up about the

1893
01:18:49,101 --> 01:18:51,890
film called [inaudible] magazine,
which apparently,

1894
01:18:51,891 --> 01:18:55,400
so he porn magazines,
like I think it's the other one.

1895
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:59,090
Or is it a rap battle magazine?
It's a,

1896
01:18:59,091 --> 01:19:01,140
yeah.
So they do this write up called a why

1897
01:19:01,141 --> 01:19:02,750
ranchers should be concerned about the
documentary.

1898
01:19:02,751 --> 01:19:04,130
Cowspiracy and I saw,
hey,

1899
01:19:04,131 --> 01:19:06,110
this film's coming out.
It's got these stats and you should know

1900
01:19:06,111 --> 01:19:08,090
your numbers because this is coming down
the pipeline.

1901
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,820
And we've had a couple other industries
say that sort of stuff.

1902
01:19:10,821 --> 01:19:12,230
And we get,
you know,

1903
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,640
we get some threatening sort of messages
and facebook posts and stuff like that,

1904
01:19:16,641 --> 01:19:17,480
but boy,
they say,

1905
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:17,991
ah,
you know,

1906
01:19:17,991 --> 01:19:20,570
just the same bullshit that anyone that
gets on the Internet.

1907
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:24,200
Um,
but I guess a lot of people don't get

1908
01:19:24,201 --> 01:19:26,290
threats from the cattle industry.
Like what kind of,

1909
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,000
I'm kind of threats are you giving?
Oh,

1910
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:28,671
I mean it's,
you know,

1911
01:19:28,671 --> 01:19:30,760
you guys should fucking die.
Um,

1912
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:33,470
you know,
I hope somebody fucking shoot you guys,

1913
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,340
you know,
that sort of,

1914
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:38,190
Whoa,
I hope somebody shoots you guys boys.

1915
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:43,400
So why did they say,

1916
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:45,590
I mean there's,
you were the film,

1917
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,560
you know,
shows and exposes the atrocities of this

1918
01:19:48,561 --> 01:19:50,900
industry and that's a threat to a lot of
people's livelihood.

1919
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:52,450
And so of course there's going to be
pushed back

1920
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:55,790
saying that you should die because you
showed facts.

1921
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:56,990
Yeah,
that's the thing we'd say,

1922
01:19:56,991 --> 01:20:00,130
nothing ourselves.
We do is interview people interview.

1923
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:00,621
Well,
you,

1924
01:20:00,621 --> 01:20:03,150
you know,
you narrate a few of the facts and then

1925
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:05,000
the numbers and statistics,
but

1926
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:06,770
we're not telling anybody what to do.
Exactly.

1927
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:07,980
How could someone say

1928
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:09,480
that you should die because of that.
And uh,

1929
01:20:09,481 --> 01:20:11,300
you know,
one of the most emotional screenings we

1930
01:20:11,301 --> 01:20:13,480
went to Idaho because my dad's from
Idaho and um,

1931
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:14,363
you know,
he's a rancher.

1932
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,230
My grandfathers or interest,
both of them.

1933
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:20,310
And so I very sympathetic to what
they're going through and what we,

1934
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,450
what were,
you know,

1935
01:20:21,451 --> 01:20:24,750
there are next level of,
of switch that has to happen or we're

1936
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:25,890
screwed.
You know,

1937
01:20:25,891 --> 01:20:27,450
what do they do?
Are they going to learn a new trade all

1938
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:29,310
of a sudden,
like how to grow organic vegetables when

1939
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:31,200
there's within been doing it's tough.
Well,

1940
01:20:31,201 --> 01:20:33,600
it's a giant issue also that a lot of
them are in debt.

1941
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:36,900
A lot of them are barely getting by as
it is.

1942
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:41,930
The world of being a farmer is
incredibly labor intensive and very

1943
01:20:41,941 --> 01:20:45,420
expensive and hard to turn a profit.
It's hard,

1944
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,490
you know,
and we all know of farms that have gone

1945
01:20:47,491 --> 01:20:50,550
under him and that's why they started
those farm aid concerts and you know,

1946
01:20:50,551 --> 01:20:53,690
Willie Nelson was it John Mellencamp was
and a bunch of those kinds of,

1947
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,570
I mean that was what that was all about.
Try to help the American farmer.

1948
01:20:57,730 --> 01:20:58,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

1949
01:20:59,260 --> 01:20:59,980
But I mean,
again,

1950
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:02,500
it's about providing information.
Let people make up their own minds.

1951
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,840
Um,
but so we had concern,

1952
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:07,390
major concern about the film.
We just kind of let it go.

1953
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:08,740
Um,
we just feel like,

1954
01:21:08,741 --> 01:21:10,450
hey,
we're protected by all the people who

1955
01:21:10,451 --> 01:21:12,880
back us up who supported the film.
Um,

1956
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:17,970
and then Leonardo Dicaprio saw the film
and got super excited about it.

1957
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:22,960
They caught in touch with us and his,
one of his producers,

1958
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:23,950
Jennifer Davidson,
said,

1959
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:25,240
Hey,
Leo saw your film,

1960
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:27,610
loves it,
wants to be executive producer,

1961
01:21:27,611 --> 01:21:30,420
wants to take it to Netflix.
Actually took it to Netflix already and

1962
01:21:30,421 --> 01:21:31,780
they,
they're interested in taking the film

1963
01:21:31,781 --> 01:21:32,650
on.
Whoa.

1964
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:34,920
Right away he brought it to Netflix
without asking,

1965
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:36,250
not even talking to us,
which is awesome.

1966
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:37,340
So gangster.
Yeah.

1967
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:39,460
Um,
but so they,

1968
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:41,230
you know,
of course they had major concern like,

1969
01:21:41,231 --> 01:21:42,400
hey,
Leonardo Dicaprio,

1970
01:21:42,401 --> 01:21:44,290
like a list celebrity,
biggest name.

1971
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,230
Like he's putting his name on a super
controversial film.

1972
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:51,880
And so we went through the film again
and we just scoured it for all of our

1973
01:21:51,881 --> 01:21:54,490
facts and back everything up.
So like on our website,

1974
01:21:54,491 --> 01:21:58,240
all the stats that we were throwing out
through this podcast and in the film or

1975
01:21:58,241 --> 01:22:00,340
on our website,
cowspiracy.com there's a fact page.

1976
01:22:00,341 --> 01:22:02,530
It has linked to every single study and
reference.

1977
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:05,200
Um,
but so that was in major concern.

1978
01:22:05,201 --> 01:22:05,561
Like,
Hey,

1979
01:22:05,561 --> 01:22:08,230
once a huge name and this hits totally
mainstream,

1980
01:22:08,231 --> 01:22:10,780
went on Netflix back in September and
it's just blown up.

1981
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:13,330
Um,
are we going to get even more pushback?

1982
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,400
And so far we're,
you know,

1983
01:22:15,401 --> 01:22:16,960
I think the industry,
if the injury is smart,

1984
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:20,110
which is questionable,
they'll continue to ignore us as best

1985
01:22:20,111 --> 01:22:22,690
they can because it's only going to draw
more attention if they come after us.

1986
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:25,540
Is it possible that they can adapt?

1987
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:28,070
Absolutely.
And that's the hall they do.

1988
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:30,040
Well that's the awesome thing is that,
um,

1989
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:34,450
you know,
silk soy milk was owned by one of the

1990
01:22:34,451 --> 01:22:37,450
largest dairy companies in the u s
because they looked at it and they said,

1991
01:22:37,451 --> 01:22:37,751
hey,
look,

1992
01:22:37,751 --> 01:22:41,410
we're losing part of our market to plant
based milks.

1993
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,570
We should by plant based milks because
hey,

1994
01:22:43,571 --> 01:22:45,350
they're not really interested in hurting
animals.

1995
01:22:45,351 --> 01:22:46,780
They're not interested in hurting the
planet.

1996
01:22:46,781 --> 01:22:48,010
So I don't make money.
You want to make money.

1997
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,920
So it's like when people switch over to
more sustainable foods,

1998
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:53,110
that's where they see the money and
they're just going to follow the money.

1999
01:22:53,111 --> 01:22:55,210
So that's one of the real hopefuls for
me.

2000
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:57,580
There was another dark part of the movie
is watching,

2001
01:22:57,581 --> 01:23:00,160
um,
dairy cows watching how they're

2002
01:23:00,161 --> 01:23:01,450
extracting the milk from and you're
like,

2003
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,690
uhhh.
And that was,

2004
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:04,540
that was the best farm.
I was like,

2005
01:23:04,541 --> 01:23:05,740
sure.
So the best,

2006
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,930
kind of like when you said you visited
your buddy's farm,

2007
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:10,540
we thought it was going to be nice and
like,

2008
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:11,710
wow,
there's going to be kind of a weird part

2009
01:23:11,711 --> 01:23:13,690
of the film.
Cause you can see these beautiful cows

2010
01:23:13,691 --> 01:23:17,530
and that's just one of those,
they know their kids are up on the hill

2011
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,840
face the other way and they hang out by
them.

2012
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:21,310
Kind of stare at them.
And just this,

2013
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:22,203
this,
you know,

2014
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:27,330
thousand cows that the visceral feeling
you can feel in the air of just sadness.

2015
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:30,640
It was,
that was the toughest day we went to a

2016
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:33,100
slaughterhouse on fear factor once,
you know,

2017
01:23:33,130 --> 01:23:35,200
this,
this stunt they had to do in a

2018
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:36,850
slaughterhouse.
And uh,

2019
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:41,260
I remember the feeling that you got when
you were in the building.

2020
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:42,660
It was like,
Whoa,

2021
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:46,480
dude,
I give this is there's like a feeling in

2022
01:23:46,481 --> 01:23:47,500
the air here.

2023
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,230
Like,
I don't want to be all hippie dippie woo

2024
01:23:50,231 --> 01:23:54,340
crystals and all that jazz.
But I really felt like you could feel

2025
01:23:54,341 --> 01:23:55,750
despair.
It was,

2026
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:59,020
you could eat,
it was almost like a vibration that you

2027
01:23:59,021 --> 01:24:01,750
could detect.
Like this is very strange.

2028
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:04,140
It's a very strange feeling.
And then it's like,

2029
01:24:04,150 --> 01:24:05,740
you know,
those animals feel that and then it goes

2030
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:08,560
into adrenaline and all of these
hormones are pumping through their

2031
01:24:08,561 --> 01:24:11,290
system the moment that they're killed
and then you're eating that.

2032
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:14,650
And um,
I was maybe that's a good point for,

2033
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:17,230
so talking about fear,
uh,

2034
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,150
addressing the animal agriculture
industry.

2035
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,190
We were going to make an announcement on
your show.

2036
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:25,270
Super stuck that we are making our new
film and it's called what the health,

2037
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:28,120
that the exact same thing is happening
to the health industry,

2038
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:31,180
the leading cause of diseases,
heart disease,

2039
01:24:31,181 --> 01:24:34,030
diabetes,
cancer is from eating animal products.

2040
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:36,550
And the same thing's happening in the
American Cancer Society,

2041
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:40,090
the American diabetic society.
All these organizations are not telling

2042
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:42,850
the information that's coming out of all
these facts.

2043
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:43,781
That's,
you know,

2044
01:24:43,781 --> 01:24:47,260
countless medical studies of what's
really killing us and causing diseases.

2045
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:49,660
Um,
so that's coming out here soon too.

2046
01:24:49,661 --> 01:24:52,150
So that's exciting.
So what are the facts as far as like

2047
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:54,580
what's causing cancer and how has that
been proven?

2048
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:56,410
So there's been a couple of studies that
show,

2049
01:24:56,411 --> 01:24:59,050
I mean there's the obvious ones.
Like the World Health Organization just

2050
01:24:59,051 --> 01:25:02,440
announced that the processed meat is
linked to colon rectal cancer.

2051
01:25:02,441 --> 01:25:04,870
Okay.
So process me being meet with chemical

2052
01:25:04,871 --> 01:25:06,670
preservatives,
they included Bacon,

2053
01:25:06,671 --> 01:25:07,820
Ham,
um,

2054
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:09,910
you know,
all process meet with chemical

2055
01:25:09,911 --> 01:25:12,420
presented.
They put it in the same category as a,

2056
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:17,200
our cynic can't,
it's carcinogenics yes.

2057
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:22,310
Exact same category as tobacco smoking.
And that was after thousands of studies.

2058
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:25,600
And that blew people away because they
cannot believe they actually announced

2059
01:25:25,601 --> 01:25:26,860
that I was one of the biggest things.

2060
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:28,960
And um,
and then now all these other

2061
01:25:28,961 --> 01:25:30,700
organizations,
they're slowly,

2062
01:25:30,701 --> 01:25:32,060
you know,
kind of putting in the back of their,

2063
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:33,730
their website,
maybe mentioning it,

2064
01:25:33,731 --> 01:25:35,740
maybe not.
So we're doing the same thing in this

2065
01:25:35,741 --> 01:25:39,250
film is that word or interviewing these
organizations and uncovering,

2066
01:25:39,251 --> 01:25:41,710
and it's so crazy out.
It's like the exact same thing as

2067
01:25:41,711 --> 01:25:43,640
cowspiracy.
Um,

2068
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:48,790
but there have also been studies linking
grassfed beef to healthy fats and that

2069
01:25:48,791 --> 01:25:51,850
it's actually healthy for you to eat
grass fed animals.

2070
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:54,490
So I think what you're talking about is
just preservatives.

2071
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:57,930
She's talking about chemically processed
animals unfortunately now.

2072
01:25:57,931 --> 01:26:00,580
And because like the World Health
Organization's showed that red meat

2073
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:02,830
unprocessed,
just broad red meat is off,

2074
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:04,280
there's type two carcinogen.

2075
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,140
And how are they making that
distinction?

2076
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:07,910
Like how,
what are they following?

2077
01:26:07,911 --> 01:26:11,660
People that ate a healthy diet,
healthy vegetables as long with red

2078
01:26:11,661 --> 01:26:14,120
meat,
they'll do these huge,

2079
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:15,950
um,
like the epic health study,

2080
01:26:15,951 --> 01:26:16,820
which has fallen,
you know,

2081
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:18,780
250,000 people,
uh,

2082
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:22,310
for over the last 40 years.
And so there's these massive population

2083
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:23,600
studies.
Um,

2084
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:25,410
but you know,
the,

2085
01:26:25,411 --> 01:26:27,890
the studies and that's something we go
into in the film because there was

2086
01:26:27,891 --> 01:26:29,360
there,
you can look at it and be like,

2087
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,400
Hey,
red meat causes heart disease.

2088
01:26:31,401 --> 01:26:32,450
And then you'll have another study.
It says,

2089
01:26:32,451 --> 01:26:32,960
no,
no,

2090
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,670
you know,
these meats are actually good for you.

2091
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:38,030
And then you just look at the funding so
well who funded the studies and the

2092
01:26:38,031 --> 01:26:39,620
fund,
the studies who are saying that meat's

2093
01:26:39,621 --> 01:26:44,510
bad for you are funded by universities
and the studies are saying this stuff is

2094
01:26:44,511 --> 01:26:44,900
good for you.

2095
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,390
It's funded by the industry.
I mean like literally paid for by the

2096
01:26:47,391 --> 01:26:48,440
American beef council.
And then,

2097
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:51,140
I mean this film is crazy.
You're going to probably crazier in a

2098
01:26:51,141 --> 01:26:54,440
way than cal spirit.
Cause we also add in the link that we

2099
01:26:54,441 --> 01:26:56,130
didn't have to deal with in the first
issue.

2100
01:26:56,131 --> 01:26:57,350
You're talking about like fear and
stuff.

2101
01:26:57,590 --> 01:27:00,620
The pharmaceutical company,
how they're tied into this trinity.

2102
01:27:00,621 --> 01:27:02,900
You know you have the anti culture
industry of the lobby group,

2103
01:27:02,901 --> 01:27:06,170
you have the government,
you have the health organizations.

2104
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:10,220
Then you have the,
the pharmaceutical companies that profit

2105
01:27:10,221 --> 01:27:12,530
off people getting sick from eating
their products.

2106
01:27:12,531 --> 01:27:15,620
So you have this crazy,
so you're saying the pharmaceutical

2107
01:27:15,621 --> 01:27:19,400
companies that profit off of people
getting sick from eating meat support

2108
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:23,360
meet because they willingly are aware.
Willingfully are aware that people are

2109
01:27:23,361 --> 01:27:27,260
getting sick from them and they want to
make sure that they have unhealthy

2110
01:27:27,261 --> 01:27:28,094
people to treat.

2111
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:28,990
We look,
you've got,

2112
01:27:28,990 --> 01:27:33,230
you have a $2 trillion stint industry,
you have,

2113
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:36,080
you don't have literally trillion dollar
industries who make,

2114
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:38,000
uh,
drugs and who make,

2115
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:38,983
you know,
surgeries.

2116
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:42,020
They don't want that to go away.
They want that to continue.

2117
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:44,420
So you,
but you really think they're actively

2118
01:27:44,421 --> 01:27:47,550
trying to keep people unhealthy.
I mean,

2119
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:48,441
you know,
again,

2120
01:27:48,441 --> 01:27:51,020
it's just about inflammation.
It's about suppressing information.

2121
01:27:51,021 --> 01:27:52,310
It's about suppressing.
It's not,

2122
01:27:52,311 --> 01:27:54,680
you know,
want to keep upl keeping people healthy.

2123
01:27:54,681 --> 01:27:55,820
It's,
again,

2124
01:27:55,821 --> 01:27:57,290
you look to these,
you look to these whole,

2125
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:59,270
to health organizations,
that's what you look to,

2126
01:27:59,271 --> 01:28:01,340
to tell us the truth.
You look at the environmental groups,

2127
01:28:01,670 --> 01:28:05,360
they're suppressing this information of
the thousands of thousands of studies

2128
01:28:05,361 --> 01:28:07,940
upon studies that have this information
over and over.

2129
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:10,040
Yet it's not being told to us.
Right?

2130
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:13,700
But the pharmaceutical companies,
do they even have to suppress

2131
01:28:13,701 --> 01:28:16,490
information?
Most people willfully ignore

2132
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:17,450
information.

2133
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:21,140
So why would they go out of their way to
suppress information when it doesn't

2134
01:28:21,141 --> 01:28:24,500
seem like there's any sort of pressure
or trend so that people to get

2135
01:28:24,501 --> 01:28:26,450
healthier?
Absolutely.

2136
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:28,280
But it's pretty interesting when you
follow,

2137
01:28:28,281 --> 01:28:30,290
you look at these health organizations,
you look at their donors,

2138
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:32,990
they're their biggest donors are
pharmaceutical companies.

2139
01:28:32,991 --> 01:28:36,200
And the next second biggest donors are
meat and dairy producers.

2140
01:28:36,620 --> 01:28:40,640
So do you think that that's to ensure
that people stay ignorant?

2141
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:46,240
I think that the,
the simple fact if you have diabetes

2142
01:28:47,061 --> 01:28:50,750
type two diabetes leading cause of type
two diabetes is from eating animal

2143
01:28:50,751 --> 01:28:51,820
proteins.
Um,

2144
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:52,700
yeah.
But it was,

2145
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:55,670
here's the problem with saying that the,
they're eating other things as well.

2146
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,820
And how are you monitoring these
people's diets?

2147
01:28:58,470 --> 01:29:01,950
Are you making sure that you're watching
what these people put in their body?

2148
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:05,130
They're not putting in processed foods,
are not putting in chemicals,

2149
01:29:05,131 --> 01:29:07,050
they're only eating meat and vegetables.

2150
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:08,970
Okay.
Are they only eating me like what the

2151
01:29:08,971 --> 01:29:11,240
fuck are they eating?
How do you know this awesome thing?

2152
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:15,600
There's a study,
a NIH study that looked at follow

2153
01:29:15,601 --> 01:29:17,580
people's diets for,
I think four years.

2154
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:20,040
Huge Group of people and looked at just
that,

2155
01:29:20,041 --> 01:29:20,431
you know,
it's like,

2156
01:29:20,431 --> 01:29:21,540
Hey,
what is the role?

2157
01:29:21,541 --> 01:29:23,610
What is the link?
And so I or mental,

2158
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:24,120
yeah,
exactly.

2159
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:25,020
Been cities.
Yeah,

2160
01:29:25,021 --> 01:29:26,550
totally.
And so the stress levels,

2161
01:29:26,551 --> 01:29:27,990
all the huge,
huge,

2162
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:29,910
uh,
all the different aspects.

2163
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,810
Then they took just animal products out.
They left them have their total shitty,

2164
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,230
you know,
die at sea and just totally processed

2165
01:29:36,231 --> 01:29:39,360
crappy sugar food.
They monitor these people or they let

2166
01:29:39,361 --> 01:29:41,860
these people report their diets and
there's a couple,

2167
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:44,940
there's at least five studies that have
done similar sort of things and I think

2168
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,850
some of them had been straight like
monitored and how many people were

2169
01:29:47,851 --> 01:29:48,900
talking about in these studies?

2170
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:52,430
Thousands and thousands.
Thousands of people that they need aid

2171
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:55,080
report their diet and then told them
they couldn't eat meat but they could

2172
01:29:55,081 --> 01:29:55,990
eat shitty foods.
Yeah.

2173
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:59,040
They sat and they listened while,
I mean that's far as we know.

2174
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:00,370
Yeah,
I know.

2175
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:01,590
Totally.
I mean I think I,

2176
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:05,070
high level skepticism is totally needed.
It got to a point when it's study after

2177
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:06,850
study after study and there's this
corollary,

2178
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:11,870
see I haven't seen study after study
after study is these things are talking

2179
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:14,620
about digging deep and investigating.
You know,

2180
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:17,280
people have been eating meat forever,
right?

2181
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:20,280
And so it's,
it's this link between carbohydrates and

2182
01:30:20,281 --> 01:30:21,330
fat.
So you can eat,

2183
01:30:21,331 --> 01:30:23,310
you can eat a high fat diet,
right?

2184
01:30:23,370 --> 01:30:26,040
And low carbohydrates and you won't
necessarily develop diabetes.

2185
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:31,140
Devoted genic ketogenic diet is also
prevents diabetes,

2186
01:30:31,150 --> 01:30:32,610
not diabetes.
Epilepsy,

2187
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:34,800
right?
That's a huge issue in children when

2188
01:30:34,801 --> 01:30:39,120
they started giving them high fat diets,
they're finding that low carbohydrate,

2189
01:30:39,121 --> 01:30:43,260
high fat diets that introduce a state of
Ketosis is actually very good at

2190
01:30:43,261 --> 01:30:46,500
preventing symptoms of epilepsy in
children.

2191
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:48,870
My partner,
she works with a younger with epilepsy

2192
01:30:48,871 --> 01:30:50,130
and she's on the kid.
It's amazing.

2193
01:30:50,190 --> 01:30:52,890
But she's actually,
she's brought Vegan too even and still

2194
01:30:52,891 --> 01:30:55,020
ketogenic so you can still not avocado
oil,

2195
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:57,400
peanut oil.
Um,

2196
01:30:57,900 --> 01:31:00,540
but you know at that doesn't necessarily
protect you from heart disease,

2197
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:02,020
diabetes,
right?

2198
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,440
So when you eat a high carbohydrate,
high fat diet,

2199
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:08,340
so that's when you develop.
Now what about sedentary lifestyle?

2200
01:31:08,341 --> 01:31:10,800
What about all the different factors
that come into play?

2201
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:12,620
We're keeping about a person's body
health.

2202
01:31:12,621 --> 01:31:16,080
They're like our preferred that one of
the primary factors in cardiovascular

2203
01:31:16,081 --> 01:31:20,670
disease is sedentary lifestyle is the
fact that your body atrophies as much as

2204
01:31:20,671 --> 01:31:23,130
your muscles atrophy and your back
deteriorates,

2205
01:31:23,131 --> 01:31:26,100
your heart does as well.
And that a lot of that can be mitigated

2206
01:31:26,101 --> 01:31:27,990
with exercise.
And then one of the correlations that

2207
01:31:27,991 --> 01:31:32,820
people are ignoring when they study diet
and the Diet and in relationship to

2208
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:35,220
people's health is what are they doing
with their body?

2209
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:39,300
What is the,
was the physical daily activity level of

2210
01:31:39,301 --> 01:31:41,520
their body and how much is that factored
in?

2211
01:31:41,521 --> 01:31:43,590
Because you can't just factor in a
person's diet.

2212
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:48,540
That's like your body is a machine,
your body is this biological diverse

2213
01:31:48,541 --> 01:31:51,510
machine that is a whole ecosystem inside
of it.

2214
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:54,570
And if you don't stress it,
and if you don't force it to work,

2215
01:31:54,571 --> 01:31:56,220
it gets weak.
It just does.

2216
01:31:56,221 --> 01:31:59,340
It just does.
If you don't demand resources,

2217
01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:00,323
it will

2218
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,430
slowly deteriorate slowly.
But we explore that too.

2219
01:32:03,431 --> 01:32:06,550
You know how much a exercise has a role
and it's huge.

2220
01:32:06,551 --> 01:32:09,580
It's massive.
But you still have to clean your engine

2221
01:32:09,581 --> 01:32:11,110
out.
You have to clean your pipes out,

2222
01:32:11,111 --> 01:32:12,040
you know,
and that's what it's doing.

2223
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:13,240
It's,
it's pumping the engine.

2224
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:17,050
But when you have a clogged arteries,
there comes a point where it can be

2225
01:32:17,051 --> 01:32:17,950
dangerous.
And if,

2226
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:18,461
uh,
you know,

2227
01:32:18,461 --> 01:32:20,320
you just do a clean diet for even,
you know,

2228
01:32:20,321 --> 01:32:23,650
try 30 days or something,
all that flushing out of you and when

2229
01:32:23,651 --> 01:32:26,140
you're sitting on the toilet for four or
five times a day,

2230
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:28,270
uh,
our of 10 times a day,

2231
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:31,290
it's just flushing all this shit inside
of you and even your extra hours

2232
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:32,950
exercising every time a day.
That's just,

2233
01:32:32,951 --> 01:32:36,340
that's trying to process this food that
you're putting into it,

2234
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:40,300
that it can't do just their exercise,
but there's not food.

2235
01:32:40,300 --> 01:32:42,490
It's like laying inside your body.
That's a myth.

2236
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:46,300
There's not like caked food inside of
people's by like that whole idea that

2237
01:32:46,301 --> 01:32:50,410
every moon of six pounds of undigested
meet and you're dead if that's the case.

2238
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:52,660
But you do have plaque building up in
your arm.

2239
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:54,910
There's definitely plaque.
But again,

2240
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:57,480
that speaks to a person's level of
physical activity.

2241
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:00,730
There's different nutritional demands
for someone that has a rigorous physical

2242
01:33:00,731 --> 01:33:05,410
activity schedule and someone who does
it and when you give your body the same

2243
01:33:05,411 --> 01:33:08,990
amount of food is someone who like say a
fucking sprint or something like that

2244
01:33:08,991 --> 01:33:10,570
were a marathon runner,
someone who's,

2245
01:33:10,571 --> 01:33:13,330
they're constantly burning off fuel.
If you give your body,

2246
01:33:13,331 --> 01:33:15,910
if you have a sedentary lifestyle in
front of a computer sitting in a cubicle

2247
01:33:15,911 --> 01:33:19,540
all day and you give your body the same
amount of food that the person who's a

2248
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:22,150
jogger consumes,
you're going to get fat and fucked up

2249
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:25,020
because you're taking in too many
calories and that's a contributor,

2250
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:28,950
a massive contributor to heart disease.
That has to be considered always.

2251
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,030
Definitely.
When you're talking about what's going

2252
01:33:31,031 --> 01:33:33,460
on with the person's body,
then you've got bio diversity,

2253
01:33:33,670 --> 01:33:35,200
like where are these people from?
Like what?

2254
01:33:35,201 --> 01:33:37,510
What part of the world are their
ancestors from?

2255
01:33:37,690 --> 01:33:40,210
Because your,
your genetics have different biological

2256
01:33:40,211 --> 01:33:41,590
requirements.
We go into genetics,

2257
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,710
we have a whole chapter on genetics
edge.

2258
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:46,160
What does genetics was only,
I mean,

2259
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,700
well as far as diseases,
but as far as diet too,

2260
01:33:48,701 --> 01:33:51,040
I mean that's,
that's another side subject that we get

2261
01:33:51,041 --> 01:33:53,520
into it.
So that's one of the aspects that I've

2262
01:33:53,521 --> 01:33:55,600
looked going to back to the lifestyle
and exercise.

2263
01:33:55,601 --> 01:34:00,601
There's huge study that just came out.
It's 40,000 people in Sweden and they

2264
01:34:00,731 --> 01:34:05,731
showed that having a,
being active versus Allah,

2265
01:34:07,871 --> 01:34:10,240
it's a little bit different,
but it looked at the difference between

2266
01:34:10,330 --> 01:34:14,770
someone who exercises all the time who's
overweight and someone who is skinny,

2267
01:34:14,771 --> 01:34:19,690
who sedentary.
You are less likely to die from being

2268
01:34:19,691 --> 01:34:24,040
sedentary and skinny than being
overweight and active.

2269
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,000
Oh,
that makes sense.

2270
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:25,791
Right,
and we'll also,

2271
01:34:25,791 --> 01:34:28,850
you're dealing with someone whose body
has gotten to a point where it's

2272
01:34:28,851 --> 01:34:33,050
deteriorated so poorly that the actual
stress of exercise can be detrimental.

2273
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:34,940
Exactly.
Like there's some people that they

2274
01:34:34,941 --> 01:34:35,870
actually say like,
look,

2275
01:34:35,871 --> 01:34:37,730
before you engage in any sort of
exercise,

2276
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:41,090
you're going to have to lose weight and
you're going to have to change your diet

2277
01:34:41,091 --> 01:34:43,970
and give your body a lot of nutrients.
Like you,

2278
01:34:43,971 --> 01:34:46,640
you have a really nutrient deficient
diet.

2279
01:34:46,910 --> 01:34:51,060
I'm going of course osteoporosis.
There's a lot of different diseases that

2280
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:54,740
people get from having nutrient
deficient diets.

2281
01:34:54,741 --> 01:34:57,890
It's a big contributed to it.
That's why when women have to give them

2282
01:34:57,891 --> 01:34:58,670
calcium.

2283
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:00,980
So one of the things that mitigates it.
Yeah.

2284
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:02,240
Well I mean,
so this is,

2285
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:05,600
this new film goes into huge depth about
it.

2286
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:08,240
Similar to cowspiracy,
it's just packed full of information.

2287
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:12,380
My point about this disease thing like
saying that it causes cancer and all

2288
01:35:12,381 --> 01:35:14,960
these things,
it's not just trying to be skeptical

2289
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:17,120
just for no reason.
They said what?

2290
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:22,540
What is stopping these people from
eating nutrient rich vegetables and you

2291
01:35:23,541 --> 01:35:28,541
know and and really
broad variety of nutrient rich foods as

2292
01:35:31,551 --> 01:35:32,810
well as meat.
Well,

2293
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,760
if you did that,
would that be bad for you?

2294
01:35:35,240 --> 01:35:39,050
If you had a rigorous exercise schedule
and you took care of your body,

2295
01:35:39,051 --> 01:35:43,400
you drank a lot of water and you ate
nutrient dense foods as well as me,

2296
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:46,550
what kind of cancer you getting there?
Because that's really how people are

2297
01:35:46,551 --> 01:35:50,120
supposed to live.
Like it's not necessarily that the only

2298
01:35:50,121 --> 01:35:53,240
problem is that they're eating meat,
that that may be a problem.

2299
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:55,490
But it may not be.
It may be a problem just because your

2300
01:35:55,491 --> 01:35:58,100
body's just shit cause you're not doing
anything with it.

2301
01:35:58,360 --> 01:35:59,181
Yeah,
I mean it's,

2302
01:35:59,181 --> 01:36:00,590
it's definitely not something the film
explores.

2303
01:36:00,591 --> 01:36:04,730
It says the associations to these strong
associations between certain types of

2304
01:36:04,731 --> 01:36:07,070
foods and lifestyle.
So that's what the whole film is about.

2305
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,290
It's what the health,
cause it's asking that question.

2306
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:11,960
It's like what the hell is going on with
our health in the United States.

2307
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:14,270
There's another study that came out
recently that talked about living in

2308
01:36:14,271 --> 01:36:16,550
urban environments takes 10 years off
your life,

2309
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:19,910
like where you were breathing in brake
dust all the time and not even thinking

2310
01:36:19,911 --> 01:36:22,250
about it.
Everybody's worried about carbon dioxide

2311
01:36:22,251 --> 01:36:23,830
and the poison that comes out of,
you know,

2312
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:28,250
exhaust engines from engines but brake
dust fucking terrible for you.

2313
01:36:28,390 --> 01:36:31,580
And it's,
it's a leading polluter of waterways and

2314
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:34,190
the stuff that washes off into the
ocean.

2315
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:37,550
It's like there's something to be
considered about that as well.

2316
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:38,570
It's totally,
it's crazy.

2317
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,510
There's so many stats,
which is we've been editing nonstop.

2318
01:36:41,511 --> 01:36:42,111
So it's like,
you know,

2319
01:36:42,111 --> 01:36:46,490
running on three hours of sleep that I
want to share about how just eating once

2320
01:36:46,491 --> 01:36:49,100
a week when you add the f cancer,
was it diabetes?

2321
01:36:49,101 --> 01:36:52,580
How just like once a week,
how it raised a certain percentage of

2322
01:36:52,581 --> 01:36:55,040
coming back again,
just one time a week.

2323
01:36:55,070 --> 01:36:56,960
What do you mean by eating once a week?
For example,

2324
01:36:56,961 --> 01:36:59,870
like eating,
if you have a woman who has had breast

2325
01:36:59,871 --> 01:37:04,820
cancer by eating one serving of whole
dairy a day increases her chance of

2326
01:37:04,821 --> 01:37:06,260
dying from breast cancer.
Okay.

2327
01:37:06,261 --> 01:37:08,540
You weren't being clear on,
unfortunately what you're saying,

2328
01:37:08,541 --> 01:37:12,830
but once a week or eating two servings
of processed meat a day increases your

2329
01:37:12,831 --> 01:37:14,980
chance of developing.
I mean,

2330
01:37:15,050 --> 01:37:16,370
yeah,
day though,

2331
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:21,290
it increases your chance of dying from
colorectal cancer by 40%.

2332
01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:22,640
I mean,
it's just a huge,

2333
01:37:22,641 --> 01:37:24,200
huge correlations.
Um,

2334
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:26,120
it's,
again,

2335
01:37:26,121 --> 01:37:27,770
it's a huge,
whole complex issue.

2336
01:37:27,771 --> 01:37:30,590
Just in the same way cowspiracy when we
went into doing cowspiracy,

2337
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:31,821
we went in,
you know,

2338
01:37:31,821 --> 01:37:33,530
just looking,
looking at the information and just

2339
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,600
presenting it all and just finding out
where,

2340
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:38,690
where's the study's coming from,
what are their sources?

2341
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:40,190
And then we're doing the same thing with
this film.

2342
01:37:40,191 --> 01:37:42,110
It's,
it's really shaping up to be,

2343
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,690
uh,
I mean it's heavy.

2344
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:47,840
It's scary.
It's got comic aspects of the same like

2345
01:37:47,841 --> 01:37:49,410
cowspiracy does.
Um,

2346
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:50,810
super controversial.
And again,

2347
01:37:50,811 --> 01:37:53,460
it doesn't tell people what to do.
It's just provides the information that

2348
01:37:53,461 --> 01:37:54,590
allows people to make up their own
minds.

2349
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,070
And You bring up great points

2350
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:57,960
though about exercise and all of those
stuff.

2351
01:37:58,050 --> 01:38:00,900
And we'll also in,
in consuming nutrient rich foods,

2352
01:38:00,901 --> 01:38:04,080
like in saying that meat is the issue.
Well no one is always a big one.

2353
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:06,930
Like the days the dairies just not
fucking good for you.

2354
01:38:06,931 --> 01:38:07,920
Yeah,
it tastes awesome.

2355
01:38:07,921 --> 01:38:09,420
Now unfortunately it's great with
cookies,

2356
01:38:09,900 --> 01:38:11,550
but it's just not,
it's not good for you.

2357
01:38:11,551 --> 01:38:12,071
It's,
it's,

2358
01:38:12,071 --> 01:38:14,100
it's creates a lot of phlegm and you
know,

2359
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:17,040
raw milk is better than,
than homogenized,

2360
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:19,260
pasteurized milk.
But you know,

2361
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:20,870
it's not the best shit for you.
Right.

2362
01:38:21,120 --> 01:38:25,860
But my point being like,
how can you isolate that it is the

2363
01:38:25,861 --> 01:38:29,880
consumption of meat causes cancer and
not the lack of nutrients from nutrient

2364
01:38:29,881 --> 01:38:34,410
dense foods along with me.
And is it an imbalance in the diet or is

2365
01:38:34,411 --> 01:38:35,670
it meat causing cancer?
Well,

2366
01:38:35,671 --> 01:38:36,630
it's Kinda,
that's what they did.

2367
01:38:36,631 --> 01:38:37,740
So that's a big part of it.

2368
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:41,280
There's so much correlations to the
tobacco industry that happened about 20

2369
01:38:41,281 --> 01:38:42,720
years ago to the meat and dairy
industry.

2370
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:46,170
Kind of like how Keegan was saying.
You see these other studies that you'll

2371
01:38:46,171 --> 01:38:47,004
hear of,
um,

2372
01:38:47,010 --> 01:38:47,441
you know,
the,

2373
01:38:47,441 --> 01:38:48,870
the,
the butterfat is good for you.

2374
01:38:48,871 --> 01:38:50,730
The cholesterol is good for the brain,
the brain,

2375
01:38:50,820 --> 01:38:51,750
uh,
grain brain.

2376
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,490
And then you see who is funding.
You know,

2377
01:38:53,491 --> 01:38:55,650
you look deep into it.
Is that,

2378
01:38:55,651 --> 01:38:58,860
um,
is that where the studies come from and

2379
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:00,330
what,
what the,

2380
01:39:00,331 --> 01:39:00,970
the,
you know,

2381
01:39:00,970 --> 01:39:03,240
there's a new movie out.
Have you seen merchants of doubt?

2382
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:05,970
Amazing.
And that's what's happening with this

2383
01:39:05,971 --> 01:39:08,580
industry.
All you have to create his doubt and

2384
01:39:08,581 --> 01:39:11,850
people playing that movie if you want,
because people might not have seen it

2385
01:39:11,851 --> 01:39:14,640
and it's really an important movie,
but it basically explores,

2386
01:39:14,641 --> 01:39:16,350
and that's a big part of this film and
it happened.

2387
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:18,440
The tobacco industry,
you don't have to prove that to,

2388
01:39:18,441 --> 01:39:21,000
to that cigarette smoking is going to
kill it.

2389
01:39:21,001 --> 01:39:23,970
You just have to just put a little bit
of doubt,

2390
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,830
just a little bit of doubt.
And it just like,

2391
01:39:25,831 --> 01:39:29,070
remember when butter was on the cover of
time and then everybody,

2392
01:39:29,071 --> 01:39:31,020
oh my God,
butter or you know,

2393
01:39:31,021 --> 01:39:33,360
just recently about how let us or bacon
was,

2394
01:39:33,361 --> 01:39:36,000
um,
more lettuce was more sustainable than

2395
01:39:36,001 --> 01:39:37,680
Bacon and,
and it's like,

2396
01:39:37,710 --> 01:39:38,730
Oh God,
thank God.

2397
01:39:38,731 --> 01:39:41,910
Now I can eat a bacon.
And just that little bit of doubt.

2398
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:44,280
And if that's all you have,
then boom,

2399
01:39:44,281 --> 01:39:46,320
you got them.
So the tobacco industry did that for

2400
01:39:46,321 --> 01:39:48,240
years and years.
And just like you're talking about how

2401
01:39:48,241 --> 01:39:51,840
do they know these studies?
Because there's thousands of studies and

2402
01:39:51,841 --> 01:39:52,710
then there'll be one,
two,

2403
01:39:52,711 --> 01:39:54,930
three of these other ones.
And there was one,

2404
01:39:54,931 --> 01:39:55,410
two,
three.

2405
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:57,420
Oh my God,
that's the one I want to see it hired

2406
01:39:57,421 --> 01:40:02,421
these people to go on these shows and,
and argue against the idea that tobacco

2407
01:40:02,461 --> 01:40:06,390
smoke was cancerous.
And so they did it in such a voice,

2408
01:40:06,391 --> 01:40:07,530
Juror,
boisterous,

2409
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:11,650
loud,
robust way that people started believing

2410
01:40:11,651 --> 01:40:12,451
that.
And now you have the,

2411
01:40:12,451 --> 01:40:13,480
you know,
the Paleo and the,

2412
01:40:13,481 --> 01:40:14,320
the butter,
you know,

2413
01:40:14,330 --> 01:40:15,150
the,
the fat,

2414
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:18,120
the fat is good for you.
You have these very strong personalities

2415
01:40:18,121 --> 01:40:19,890
that top,
this isn't people though that were doing

2416
01:40:19,891 --> 01:40:22,650
it about the environment.
That's what was confusing and scary.

2417
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:26,610
These guys that they were working for,
the tobacco companies initially then

2418
01:40:26,611 --> 01:40:29,190
started doing it about issues with the
environment.

2419
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:31,350
And you realize that the same people and
you're like,

2420
01:40:31,351 --> 01:40:33,240
what in the fuck?
Like,

2421
01:40:33,241 --> 01:40:34,220
Whoa,
this is great.

2422
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:35,580
And then you find out where they're
getting paid.

2423
01:40:35,581 --> 01:40:35,940
You,
you're like,

2424
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:37,770
this is so transparent.
Right?

2425
01:40:37,771 --> 01:40:39,180
And then now it's the mean their
industry.

2426
01:40:39,181 --> 01:40:41,010
It's kind of like the last to fall of
these.

2427
01:40:41,510 --> 01:40:43,200
Um,
and then that's when it comes down to,

2428
01:40:43,201 --> 01:40:44,160
uh,
you know,

2429
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:46,410
where a,
where it's getting funded and where that

2430
01:40:46,411 --> 01:40:48,840
merchant of doubt,
where were those guys working now?

2431
01:40:48,841 --> 01:40:49,674
Where,
where does this,

2432
01:40:49,740 --> 01:40:50,371
this,
this,

2433
01:40:50,371 --> 01:40:53,410
uh,
industry where they're putting their of

2434
01:40:53,411 --> 01:40:54,244
marketing?

2435
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:55,360
Well,
there's a lot.

2436
01:40:55,361 --> 01:40:57,910
It's going to the one of most,
if not the most powerful industry in the

2437
01:40:57,911 --> 01:41:00,300
entire planet mean dairy.
Well,

2438
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:03,550
I think we can all agree that as human
beings,

2439
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:08,620
what we need for sure is access to
information about things that affect us

2440
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:10,660
when it comes to health and when it
comes to diet.

2441
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:13,300
When it comes to when you,
when you find out that studies,

2442
01:41:13,301 --> 01:41:15,220
like I used to do this joke about,
um,

2443
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:17,890
I'm sure you're aware that the
partnership for drug free America,

2444
01:41:17,891 --> 01:41:20,950
it was funded by alcohol and tobacco
companies and pharmaceutical companies.

2445
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:23,470
That's where they got all their money
from and they would do these commercials

2446
01:41:23,471 --> 01:41:25,390
against pot.
And I said that's like hookers doing

2447
01:41:25,391 --> 01:41:28,360
commercials against strippers.
It's the most ridiculous fucking shit

2448
01:41:28,361 --> 01:41:30,700
ever.
But if you ever watched those proposed

2449
01:41:30,990 --> 01:41:32,440
postures,
commercials,

2450
01:41:32,441 --> 01:41:35,080
like the girl with the talking dog,
she comes home from school and her dogs

2451
01:41:35,110 --> 01:41:39,040
toner stop getting high,
like that's funded by pill companies.

2452
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:42,400
And the idea behind that,
that that could be legal,

2453
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:45,370
that you can do that and then you could
put that commercial on television and

2454
01:41:45,371 --> 01:41:48,610
not say,
hey the pill co partnership for drug

2455
01:41:48,611 --> 01:41:50,440
free America.
Like what does that mean?

2456
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:54,730
Drug companies stopping other business.
That's exactly what it is.

2457
01:41:55,090 --> 01:41:58,870
And we need information and we needed to
be really clear.

2458
01:41:58,871 --> 01:42:02,680
And if you are trying to stop
information like that stupid fucking

2459
01:42:02,770 --> 01:42:05,770
part of the Patriot Act,
we try and stop information from getting

2460
01:42:05,771 --> 01:42:09,280
to people that is on American.
Okay.

2461
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:13,030
That is non progressive.
That is something that we shouldn't

2462
01:42:13,031 --> 01:42:17,530
allow in this age of information.
You can't stop information when it

2463
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:19,760
pertains to the health and the,
the,

2464
01:42:19,761 --> 01:42:23,860
the ethical considerations of an entire
population of a country.

2465
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:25,660
You just fucking can't.
Exactly,

2466
01:42:25,790 --> 01:42:28,280
exactly.
And that's again what our whole mission

2467
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:30,500
is just providing information.
Like people say like,

2468
01:42:30,501 --> 01:42:31,940
Hey,
don't tell people how to live their

2469
01:42:31,941 --> 01:42:33,260
lives.
I'm full on.

2470
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,060
Don't tell people how to live it.
And you didn't.

2471
01:42:35,090 --> 01:42:36,800
Yeah.
The first way you get someone to put up

2472
01:42:36,801 --> 01:42:39,440
a wall is tell them what to do.
Like give them the information,

2473
01:42:39,441 --> 01:42:41,480
allow people to make their own minds.
And that's exactly what we're seeing.

2474
01:42:41,481 --> 01:42:45,110
We're seeing people making massive
lifestyle changes and political changes

2475
01:42:45,290 --> 01:42:47,810
based off of our first film.
Cowspiracy um,

2476
01:42:48,290 --> 01:42:49,790
and you know,
the potential again,

2477
01:42:49,791 --> 01:42:51,490
is there for,
for any film to do that,

2478
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:55,100
just give the information unbiased.
Let people decide for themselves.

2479
01:42:55,101 --> 01:42:57,050
And,
and that's where I'm super excited about

2480
01:42:57,051 --> 01:42:59,000
the new film for that reason,
that it's,

2481
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:01,670
it's another chapters,
another window into a world that we

2482
01:43:01,671 --> 01:43:02,990
haven't really gotten to see before.

2483
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:05,470
Well,
wherever there's money,

2484
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,770
right,
you're going to have someone who's

2485
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:11,530
trying to make more of it and trying to
stop any information that gets out,

2486
01:43:11,531 --> 01:43:13,270
it's going to prevent them from making
more of it.

2487
01:43:13,690 --> 01:43:17,530
And money's just sort of fines,
holes and cracks and leaks through.

2488
01:43:17,980 --> 01:43:21,640
And that's a,
that's sort of like a river or

2489
01:43:21,641 --> 01:43:22,750
something.
And they're like,

2490
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:25,750
streams of water just finds a way
through this.

2491
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:28,030
That's what's so cool.
Like at the end of the film where we

2492
01:43:28,130 --> 01:43:32,020
show that it was so dark in the making
the food of actually making it.

2493
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:32,861
And we said,
you know,

2494
01:43:32,861 --> 01:43:35,200
let's look if there's a glimmer of hope.
And then we saw these,

2495
01:43:35,201 --> 01:43:36,034
you know,
these plants,

2496
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:39,070
uh,
beyond meeting the beyond egg.

2497
01:43:39,071 --> 01:43:41,020
And then we found out Bill Gates and
the,

2498
01:43:41,021 --> 01:43:42,880
uh,
the guys from twitter,

2499
01:43:43,330 --> 01:43:46,360
they're putting their money into these
new,

2500
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:49,480
these new plant based foods because they
see this as the future.

2501
01:43:49,481 --> 01:43:50,860
You know,
these billionaires look five,

2502
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:52,160
10 years down the road

2503
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,360
and that's where they're putting their
money.

2504
01:43:53,361 --> 01:43:55,880
So now the money's going.
They're not ethically I nine for the

2505
01:43:55,881 --> 01:43:57,500
environment.
They're doing it because they see it's

2506
01:43:57,501 --> 01:44:00,290
making money.
Now this is also happening a few plants

2507
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,660
that have a full amino acid profile,
right?

2508
01:44:02,690 --> 01:44:04,820
There's only a few plants that are
complete proteins.

2509
01:44:04,821 --> 01:44:07,700
It's like Keywan hamp and there's a few
other ones.

2510
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:11,150
Well they all have a complete,
they all have all the amino acids.

2511
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:12,770
It's just they haven't been different
levels.

2512
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:13,731
So it's like,
you know,

2513
01:44:13,731 --> 01:44:17,690
you have your 23 amino acids,
there'll be high and six and low and you

2514
01:44:17,691 --> 01:44:20,360
know the others,
but they don't all have the same amino

2515
01:44:20,361 --> 01:44:22,110
acids that meat does.
Yes.

2516
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,200
So they have all,
all of them do.

2517
01:44:24,201 --> 01:44:25,610
Every,
every plant that has protein,

2518
01:44:25,611 --> 01:44:28,250
like Broccoli has protein.
So Broccoli has all the amino acids

2519
01:44:28,251 --> 01:44:28,820
that,
uh,

2520
01:44:28,820 --> 01:44:29,270
that,
uh,

2521
01:44:29,270 --> 01:44:30,410
does as far as I know.

2522
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:31,580
Yeah.
And so what it is,

2523
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:33,800
cause they used to be that belief that
you had to combine foods.

2524
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:34,421
And so it's like,
yeah,

2525
01:44:34,421 --> 01:44:36,620
to eat brown rice and Broccoli.
But the truth is,

2526
01:44:36,621 --> 01:44:40,430
is that just eat a very diet and you get
the exact levels that you need.

2527
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:44,180
Um,
the belief of in like that eating meat

2528
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,220
is,
is the,

2529
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,480
you know,
has the amino acids that are closest to

2530
01:44:47,481 --> 01:44:49,970
our own proteins.
It's,

2531
01:44:49,971 --> 01:44:52,040
well then that logically we should eat
human beings.

2532
01:44:52,041 --> 01:44:55,010
That'd be the healthiest food to eat,
but that's not really the healthiest

2533
01:44:55,011 --> 01:44:56,940
food for people.
Why would that be the case though?

2534
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:59,570
That that's the whole basis of that like
meat,

2535
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:02,360
that's where the amino acids is arguing
that.

2536
01:45:02,361 --> 01:45:03,920
Right.
And with what they're saying is that you

2537
01:45:03,921 --> 01:45:06,620
should eat what we've eaten up until
now,

2538
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:11,060
like all the thousands of years of human
development we've developed specifically

2539
01:45:11,061 --> 01:45:12,410
for certain diets.

2540
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:15,170
That's why biodiversity,
when you talk to people from different

2541
01:45:15,171 --> 01:45:17,540
parts of the world,
they might require different nutrients

2542
01:45:17,541 --> 01:45:20,000
because their genetics have adapted to
the nutrients that are in their

2543
01:45:20,001 --> 01:45:21,050
environment.
Right?

2544
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:22,220
Right,
right.

2545
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:23,840
So no one's saying that you should eat
people.

2546
01:45:23,841 --> 01:45:25,550
And so it's kind of disingenuous
argument,

2547
01:45:25,551 --> 01:45:26,361
right?
Well,

2548
01:45:26,361 --> 01:45:27,290
yeah,
but I mean,

2549
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:30,620
but to say that we have to eat meat
because that's often the argument is

2550
01:45:30,621 --> 01:45:33,110
that well we have to eat these foods.
And they're saying,

2551
01:45:33,111 --> 01:45:34,670
I think what they're trying to,
sorry to interrupt you,

2552
01:45:34,671 --> 01:45:37,790
but I think they're saying to optimize,
to optimize your performance,

2553
01:45:37,791 --> 01:45:40,010
your health,
your vitality,

2554
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:43,130
that animal based proteins are more
efficient.

2555
01:45:44,570 --> 01:45:47,780
And that's the part or you know,
film goes into like efficiency,

2556
01:45:47,781 --> 01:45:49,970
efficiency in long endurance athletes,
you know,

2557
01:45:49,971 --> 01:45:53,810
say you're talking about ritual are
Scott Jurek,

2558
01:45:53,811 --> 01:45:54,250
you know,
the,

2559
01:45:54,250 --> 01:45:55,520
the biggest,
longest,

2560
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:58,730
the most healthiest longer south athlete
right now.

2561
01:45:58,730 --> 01:46:01,700
Just Scott Jurek,
he's strictly on a plant based Diet

2562
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:04,220
because it's the most efficient form of,
you know,

2563
01:46:04,221 --> 01:46:05,390
converting,
right?

2564
01:46:05,391 --> 01:46:07,100
But you're talking about endurance
athletes,

2565
01:46:07,101 --> 01:46:09,080
you're talking about skinny guys that
run a long time.

2566
01:46:09,150 --> 01:46:11,810
You're not spending an hour talking
about,

2567
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,450
look when you,
if you looked at like mixed martial

2568
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:17,540
artists for example,
or boxers or explosive athletes that

2569
01:46:17,541 --> 01:46:19,850
have to optimize the physical capacity
of their body.

2570
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:21,260
There's very,
very,

2571
01:46:21,261 --> 01:46:21,981
very,
very,

2572
01:46:21,981 --> 01:46:25,640
very few that have vegan diets.
And few have tried it and they felt

2573
01:46:25,641 --> 01:46:26,560
weak.
Uh,

2574
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:28,850
John Fitch was one of them.
John Fitch who did it,

2575
01:46:28,851 --> 01:46:31,940
I believe for ethical reasons also
because he wanted to try to optimize his

2576
01:46:31,941 --> 01:46:34,790
health.
He just found himself to be much weaker

2577
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:37,580
when it was on a Vegan Diet.
It's a big thing about that.

2578
01:46:37,610 --> 01:46:39,590
I mean there's the Mac Danzek,
he was,

2579
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:40,680
you know,
Vegan.

2580
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:41,930
Yes.
And again,

2581
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:43,520
mack,
who's a good fighter,

2582
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:45,710
never reached a championship level.

2583
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:49,860
He was very smart guy,
very intelligent guy and did it for all

2584
01:46:49,861 --> 01:46:53,660
the right reasons and a real
environmentalist and I'm very aware of

2585
01:46:53,661 --> 01:46:55,680
guy and she's a real brilliant guy all
around,

2586
01:46:56,010 --> 01:47:01,010
but he never reached that championship
potential that some feel that you need

2587
01:47:02,401 --> 01:47:05,100
to eat animal based protein and it's
just an argument for that.

2588
01:47:05,430 --> 01:47:06,420
Yeah,
I mean it's definitely,

2589
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:07,950
it's an interesting argument.
I think the big,

2590
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:10,770
the big part of is that there's so few
vegan athletes right now.

2591
01:47:10,771 --> 01:47:13,140
I think you're right.
I think that is in a population there's

2592
01:47:13,141 --> 01:47:16,110
only 1% of vegans.
So you know if that person,

2593
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:19,230
and what's the percent of percentage of
an elite athlete,

2594
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:23,880
right 0.01 add to elite athletes.
What percentage of elite athletes are

2595
01:47:23,881 --> 01:47:26,100
vegans actually looking into that?
Because you know,

2596
01:47:26,120 --> 01:47:29,070
depending on what you're looking into,
long durrance like when Carl Lewis,

2597
01:47:29,071 --> 01:47:31,740
when he was at his peak,
he said he was completely vegan when

2598
01:47:31,780 --> 01:47:32,610
he's at his peak.

2599
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:34,390
But he was also on steroids.
No,

2600
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:35,273
no.
Yeah.

2601
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:38,190
How does help?
Um,

2602
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:38,970
I mean,
you know,

2603
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:40,890
he was caught with something.
He was caught with some sort of a

2604
01:47:40,891 --> 01:47:43,320
stimulant.
It was at the same time that Glen

2605
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:45,030
Johnson was caught or Ben Johnson
rather,

2606
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:46,740
you know,
when Ben Johnson was caught with

2607
01:47:46,741 --> 01:47:48,630
steroids,
Carlos is caught with something too.

2608
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:50,790
And Carlos had been caught with other
things before.

2609
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:51,720
Like,
you know,

2610
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:53,770
when I had,
I'm Victor Conte in here,

2611
01:47:53,771 --> 01:47:56,370
it was with the ball ball co guy.
And um,

2612
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:58,560
he sort of explained all the,
uh,

2613
01:47:58,561 --> 01:48:00,420
the different modalities and methods at
these.

2614
01:48:00,421 --> 01:48:02,850
He's like every track and field athletes
dirty.

2615
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:04,050
He's like,
they're all dirty.

2616
01:48:04,370 --> 01:48:05,910
He,
and he was saying the same thing about

2617
01:48:05,911 --> 01:48:07,950
Tour de France.
He's like this idea that these guys are

2618
01:48:07,951 --> 01:48:10,050
doing it clean bullshit.
They're all dirty.

2619
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,590
So when you say these guys are doing
amazing,

2620
01:48:12,610 --> 01:48:17,610
they're on a plant based diet and epo
and testosterone and hgh and blood

2621
01:48:18,841 --> 01:48:20,430
doping and,
but like you said,

2622
01:48:20,431 --> 01:48:21,930
a lot going on everyone else's too.

2623
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:22,800
Yes,
that's true.

2624
01:48:23,010 --> 01:48:27,150
So one thing that the strongest guy in
Germany puts a Patrick boot Patrik

2625
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:30,300
strung guy in Germany,
one strong man,

2626
01:48:30,350 --> 01:48:33,510
his job,
one of those barrel toss and characters,

2627
01:48:33,930 --> 01:48:37,410
world record holder.
He's the yet has two Guinness Book of

2628
01:48:37,411 --> 01:48:40,890
World Records for Yolk lifts and just
super beast.

2629
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:43,290
100% Vegan.
Interesting.

2630
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:44,490
But you know,
I think that it's,

2631
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:45,740
it's one aspect of it.
Yeah.

2632
01:48:45,890 --> 01:48:49,500
You're saying like we're machines and so
it's like put the right fuel in the

2633
01:48:49,501 --> 01:48:51,480
machine to run it.
I'm the wrong guy to have this

2634
01:48:51,481 --> 01:48:55,260
conversation with you guys honestly
because I just don't know enough and I

2635
01:48:55,261 --> 01:48:59,610
would love to have some sort of someone
who really understands human physiology.

2636
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:02,250
That's why I don't want to throw out
numbers cause there's so much editing

2637
01:49:02,251 --> 01:49:04,140
we're still going through.
It's just blowing our mind though.

2638
01:49:04,141 --> 01:49:05,520
It's,
you know,

2639
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:07,920
someone from the Paleo community that's
really small,

2640
01:49:07,921 --> 01:49:10,120
like a Rob Wolf guy would be a good guy
to talk to you guys.

2641
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:12,090
And that's the other thing too,
is that we're,

2642
01:49:12,150 --> 01:49:15,690
I don't think we're even equipped to
make the arguments because we're not

2643
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:16,581
running to doctors.
Right,

2644
01:49:16,581 --> 01:49:17,880
right.
I mean it's the same thing with

2645
01:49:17,881 --> 01:49:19,230
cowspiracy.
People want to argue with us on

2646
01:49:19,231 --> 01:49:20,250
statistics and say,
hey look,

2647
01:49:20,251 --> 01:49:21,860
we're just reporting what other people
have.

2648
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:24,060
Oh boy it be,
if I wanted to get two guys together,

2649
01:49:24,061 --> 01:49:27,540
like a rob wolf and then a scientist
who's supporting the Vegan Diet,

2650
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:29,430
who would those two?
Garth Davis,

2651
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:30,570
Garth Davis,
Davis.

2652
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:34,290
Just because there's a few people who
just go off on the whole Paleo Paleo

2653
01:49:34,291 --> 01:49:37,800
thing from,
from a physiological level to,

2654
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:39,930
you know,
to every single level of what Paleo is

2655
01:49:39,931 --> 01:49:43,650
actually really ate and what they will
consume that sort of that,

2656
01:49:43,710 --> 01:49:46,530
it's just the name.
I think the problem is with the name

2657
01:49:46,531 --> 01:49:48,040
Paleo,
but the idea

2658
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,350
of people eating things that are easily
digestible,

2659
01:49:50,351 --> 01:49:54,820
that's normal food like lettuces and
grasses and vegetables and meats and

2660
01:49:54,821 --> 01:49:57,010
chicken and fish.
Like that's,

2661
01:49:57,070 --> 01:49:59,620
that's what their ideas about.
Davis is a good one.

2662
01:49:59,650 --> 01:49:59,910
He's,
yeah,

2663
01:49:59,910 --> 01:50:00,710
he's a character too.

2664
01:50:00,710 --> 01:50:01,790
That would be cool.
That'd be cool.

2665
01:50:01,791 --> 01:50:02,211
Okay.
All right.

2666
01:50:02,211 --> 01:50:03,044
That guy,
Connie,

2667
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:05,600
he's wanting to try to fly the wealth
that will give you a contact if you want

2668
01:50:05,601 --> 01:50:05,961
us.
You know,

2669
01:50:05,961 --> 01:50:09,110
people always complain that I have these
one sided conversations with people like

2670
01:50:09,111 --> 01:50:12,170
you guys and I don't bring anybody into
and then I'm stuck trying to do it

2671
01:50:12,171 --> 01:50:14,810
myself and I'm feel equipped.
Garth Davis,

2672
01:50:14,811 --> 01:50:17,750
that's the one cool thing I think about
your show is that you have,

2673
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:20,810
you have super eclectic guests.
You have people from so many different

2674
01:50:20,811 --> 01:50:21,644
spectrums.
Like,

2675
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:25,370
um,
I mean again from from one end of,

2676
01:50:25,371 --> 01:50:28,280
you know,
Hardcore Paleo sort of folks to,

2677
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:30,890
to Yara friend retro who says hi by the
love.

2678
01:50:30,891 --> 01:50:32,480
That dude is awesome.
He's awesome.

2679
01:50:32,510 --> 01:50:33,410
Awesome Guy,
great,

2680
01:50:33,411 --> 01:50:34,230
great guy.
Yeah.

2681
01:50:34,230 --> 01:50:37,250
Plant base and durrance athletes.
So I try to have an open mind

2682
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:41,040
been as,
as possible while trying to enjoy this

2683
01:50:41,041 --> 01:50:44,180
experience and watch what your health,
when it comes out loud,

2684
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:49,240
what the health when it comes out.
And you'll get two hours of sleep when,

2685
01:50:50,930 --> 01:50:52,920
I'm sorry.
Um,

2686
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:55,140
yeah.
Well I'll definitely watch it 100%.

2687
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:58,380
I think you guys did a fantastic job
with this documentary.

2688
01:50:58,381 --> 01:50:59,520
I really do.
And I think,

2689
01:50:59,540 --> 01:51:00,940
I hope that,
uh,

2690
01:51:00,990 --> 01:51:02,940
you know,
as I said that I think information is

2691
01:51:02,941 --> 01:51:05,700
the most important thing.
And when people were trying to deny

2692
01:51:05,701 --> 01:51:09,110
information or restrict information
based on the worry that they're gonna

2693
01:51:09,130 --> 01:51:11,430
lose money because they're doing
something unethical,

2694
01:51:11,610 --> 01:51:15,270
that should be a fucking crime.
It shouldn't be a crime that you filmed

2695
01:51:15,271 --> 01:51:17,610
that,
that that shouldn't be a crime.

2696
01:51:17,611 --> 01:51:20,150
It shouldn't be a crime that you show
someone kicking a fucking cow,

2697
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:21,490
beating over the head with a
sledgehammer.

2698
01:51:21,570 --> 01:51:22,403
Like we have seen.

2699
01:51:22,590 --> 01:51:25,140
If you watch those videos,
it shouldn't be a crime to film.

2700
01:51:25,141 --> 01:51:28,650
That should be a crime to do that.
And it should be a crime to support

2701
01:51:28,651 --> 01:51:29,220
that,
that,

2702
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:31,800
that that's,
it's fucked up.

2703
01:51:31,830 --> 01:51:34,200
It's,
it's against what people want in this

2704
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:36,810
day and age.
And I think the analogy of like finding

2705
01:51:36,811 --> 01:51:38,640
out that slaves make your genes is
right.

2706
01:51:39,570 --> 01:51:40,650
It really is.
I mean,

2707
01:51:40,651 --> 01:51:42,300
it's probably worse because you're
eating it,

2708
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:43,171
you know,
it's,

2709
01:51:43,171 --> 01:51:46,290
it's a different thing because it's
actually becoming a part of your body is

2710
01:51:46,291 --> 01:51:49,620
just as bad or not worse or whatever.
It's bad.

2711
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:52,380
Why am I quantifying?
Um,

2712
01:51:52,410 --> 01:51:53,650
is there anything else you guys would
like to say?

2713
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:55,100
40 ramps up.
Uh,

2714
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:56,230
you know,

2715

The film on Netflix,

2718
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:06,370
we had a book that just came out that,
uh,

2719
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:09,730
called the sustainability secret that
covers even more statistics and

2720
01:52:09,731 --> 01:52:12,010
information and behind the scenes stuff
that happened in the film.
