1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:04,840
Are we live?

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,500
Yeah.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,333
Holy Shit.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:10,720
For Reals Joe Rogan experience podcast
is brought to you by the flashlight.

5
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,680
I'm going to stumble and fuck.

6
00:00:11,681 --> 00:00:12,700
You know that when I,

7
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:13,960
when I start these things off I,

8
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:17,770
it's almost like maybe I should pretend
to do a podcast for like 10 minutes

9
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:21,490
before I do a podcast just to
warm my fucking stupid face up.

10
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:21,741
Well,

11
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:25,180
it's also the freshness of just coming
off of be getting stone to where like she

12
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:25,600
wasn't yet.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,130
The world is listening.

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,061
Jesus,

15
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:28,894
Brian

16
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,941
back to us.

17
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:32,050
We don't work for ESPN.

18
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,280
The Joe Rogan experience.

19
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:33,580
Prague.

20
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,600
Imagine if we did.

21
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,190
Yeah,

22
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,930
I was listening to that
man that Josh grows.

23
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,780
That was interesting.

24
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:37,930
Yeah.

25
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,800
You can't panicked.

26
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,580
That's weird.

27
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,480
Hanging out with people that can,

28
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,790
cause we're so used to hanging out with
comics and hanging out with somebody

29
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:43,480
that has to be like,

30
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:43,601
oh,

31
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:46,120
I can't smoke something because
I don't want to get him fired.

32
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:46,421
Well,

33
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:46,961
not only that,

34
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:47,794
he's a writer.

35
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,070
Yeah.

36
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:48,801
Jesus Christ.

37
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:50,470
Do you want the writers to suck?

38
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:50,721
Yeah.

39
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:51,521
Like you don't want it.

40
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:52,690
The writers of smoke weed.

41
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:53,710
Are you crazy?

42
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,210
What you do not want.

43
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:56,290
Colorful pros.

44
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,101
Do you not want,

45
00:00:57,101 --> 00:00:57,401
you know,

46
00:00:57,401 --> 00:00:59,050
a an imaginative piece?

47
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,550
Do you not want something that engages
you and captures your imagination and

48
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,041
lets you think,

49
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:03,191
wow,

50
00:01:03,191 --> 00:01:07,000
this guy is coming from a very unique
point of view instead of the same tired,

51
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:07,301
old,

52
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,560
stupid shit.

53
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,880
Listen to ESPN.

54
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,680
Let your people have some flavor.

55
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:11,911
Yeah,

56
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:14,320
it's like Disney and not letting
their artists eat mushrooms.

57
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:14,531
Well,

58
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:15,450
I bet they also wouldn't.

59
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,030
If I had a thing with ESPN.

60
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:18,910
I bet they wouldn't let me be
sponsored by the flashlight.

61
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:19,300
I,

62
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,133
but that's an issue.

63
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,340
I bet that's an issue with people.

64
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,533
It's athletic.

65
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,633
It is.

66
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:24,400
That's true.

67
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,060
It's not like it does.

68
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,631
It does.

69
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:26,464
It itself,

70
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:26,950
it's,

71
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,620
it's technology applied to
something that people are scared of.

72
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,320
Exactly.

73
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Skewed touch that a PP scared of people
knowing that you masturbate of people

74
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:37,510
knowing that you give yourself pleasure.

75
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,680
Ha ha ha.

76
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:39,820
Anyway,

77
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,560
if you go to Joe rogan.net and click on
the link for the flashlight and entering

78
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,061
the code name,

79
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:43,570
Rogan,

80
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,480
you will get 15% off the
number one sex toy format.

81
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,350
We are also brought to you by
[inaudible] Dot com o n n I t,

82
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,960
makers of Alpha Brain shroom,

83
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:53,261
tech,

84
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:54,010
sport,

85
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:54,880
new mood,

86
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,780
and the man who started
all this bullshit is here.

87
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,461
Used to be.

88
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:04,180
Chris knows some shit
went down in the jungle.

89
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,040
How many people can say that?

90
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:06,940
What's your name?

91
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,480
Well,

92
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,680
most people know me as Chris and my name
is Aubrey because some shit went down

93
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:12,300
to the junkers.

94
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,133
Yeah,

95
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:13,690
yeah,

96
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,630
that's a good one and we're going
to get involved with all that stuff.

97
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,710
We've got a lot to talk about.

98
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,420
Aubrey and I are going to restructure the,

99
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,500
the the earth today.

100
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,070
We've decided we were going to
figure out a better way to run this.

101
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,800
You dirty little fuckers anyway.

102
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,210
If you go to Joe rogan.net,

103
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:30,220
click on the Alpha brain link
and throwing the code name,

104
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:30,970
Rogan.

105
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,550
You will get 10% off or don't.

106
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,061
All right.

107
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:35,350
I'm tired of you.

108
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:40,351
Whiny little Internet twats
don't have to buy the vitamins.

109
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:41,430
You don't have to enjoy,

110
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,251
you don't have to be healthy.

111
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:43,120
You can smoke cigarettes,

112
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:43,811
you could drink whiskey,

113
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:46,480
you can do whatever the fuck you want.

114
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,230
But if you're interested in
the subject of Nootropics,

115
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,440
I suggest that you go
online and do some research.

116
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:58,441
It's a very interesting topic and there's
a lot of evidence to support the idea

117
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:00,220
that are certain nutrients

118
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,200
that enhance the way your brain works.

119
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,371
You know there are days,

120
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:05,290
we all know this where we don't feel,

121
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,000
you don't feel clear,

122
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,961
you feel like shit,

123
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:08,710
you feel cloudy.

124
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,060
What is that folks?

125
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:10,281
What,

126
00:03:10,281 --> 00:03:10,550
what,

127
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,540
what gentle balance is off when you're,

128
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,960
when you're having off days and can
that be enhanced with nutrition?

129
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,900
I believe at Kent and if
you are interested in,

130
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,430
I encourage you to just go look up
the subject before you buy anything.

131
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,280
Read some of the things that
had been written and you know,

132
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,690
draw your own conclusions,

133
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:29,650
be objective about it.

134
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,300
I also suggested if you'd think that our
stuff is too expensive to just copy the

135
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:34,901
ingredients,

136
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:35,380
man,

137
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,340
just go online,

138
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,870
buy your shit and bulk copy it.

139
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:38,591
Good luck to you.

140
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:40,960
I swear to God we're not that greedy.

141
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,550
The proof that we're not that greedy
is if you don't like it is a hundred

142
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,570
percent money back guarantee.

143
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,980
Who the fuck else does that?

144
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,431
Yeah,

145
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:48,791
it's true.

146
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,950
And you can't do it any cleaner.

147
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:51,701
Okay.

148
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:52,420
I know you don't.

149
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,770
If you don't believe in vitamins,

150
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:54,820
you say you piss them all out.

151
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,080
That's all good dude.

152
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:56,681
You know,

153
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:56,851
I,

154
00:03:56,851 --> 00:03:58,300
I know from personal experience,

155
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:03,301
from actual health issues that vitamins
have a key benefit and your wellbeing

156
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,700
hundred percent your health and
wellbeing are affected by vitamins.

157
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:07,910
I don't care if you see,

158
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,290
you know,

159
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,460
the bullshit about,

160
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:09,640
you know,

161
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,270
studies that disproves study's approved.

162
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,310
I don't think you can accurately get an
assessment about that unless we get into

163
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:20,311
some really fucking much more detailed
tests of diet and exercise and you know,

164
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:21,651
and,

165
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:24,520
and test people that aren't doing it and
test people that aren't and then draw

166
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:25,420
your conclusions.

167
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,280
But I think vitamins enhance.

168
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,060
I absolutely feel like they
enhance so bar shit or not,

169
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:31,894
whatever,

170
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,651
whatever,

171
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:33,071
whatever.

172
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:34,300
We got a lot of shit to talk about.

173
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,111
Cue The music,

174
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:35,944
Brian.

175
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,893
All right.

176
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,360
[inaudible]

177
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,750
coolest moment of my life as
a professional broadcaster.

178
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,250
What's that Ufo sound,

179
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:54,521
Brian,

180
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:55,390
when you try and do us,

181
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,210
I don't know how to stop that thing.

182
00:04:58,211 --> 00:04:58,990
What is it?

183
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,380
Oh go.

184
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,370
After awhile it was some special
effects that I was doing early on.

185
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,180
The outro,

186
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,660
Brian,

187
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,950
it's not going away now.

188
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:06,784
It's just in your head.

189
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,780
No,

190
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,730
come on Brian.

191
00:05:08,731 --> 00:05:09,564
You got to shut that off.

192
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,960
Do you really not know
how to shut that off?

193
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,183
It's gone.

194
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,660
This is lizards like last until a slow
beat and I was going to drive me crazy

195
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:18,790
cause I'm going to hear a
beat every like 30 seconds.

196
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,740
I want to hear it in the background.

197
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:21,440
Well,

198
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,870
a little constant distraction.

199
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,340
That's not a good sound effect.

200
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,210
Let's not use that one again.

201
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,910
I love that freaking everybody out,

202
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:28,360
man.

203
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,050
There's a lot of people that that they
listened to this podcast man and they're

204
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:32,884
on some shit.

205
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,721
Okay.

206
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:37,420
The hardest freaking out
with fucking alien noises.

207
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,471
Did you see that?

208
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,120
A spaceship that there's,

209
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:40,681
it's been though.

210
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:41,590
It was unlike a,

211
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,230
I believe it was end
gadget and or Gizmodo,

212
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:47,210
one of those a gadget websites
where they were talking about a,

213
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,210
there's all these photos of this crazy
spacecraft at the government was driving

214
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,340
on the back of a truck and it was,

215
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:55,390
yeah it was like through Kansas.

216
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,540
We who knows what the fuck it was.

217
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,840
It could have been a weather balloon.

218
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,840
They're all weather balloons.

219
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:00,200
Right.

220
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,980
But they known that word.

221
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,500
We're using drones now
cause the guy was arrested,

222
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,940
a guy who was a cattle dispute and I mean
the only way this even makes sense is

223
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:08,391
that someone,

224
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:12,080
no I must have insane money and hate
this guy cause the story doesn't make any

225
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:12,351
sense.

226
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:17,351
But they used a drone to determine that
there was cows in this guy's property

227
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,020
that weren't his and that
he did not alert the other.

228
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,630
The other,

229
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,010
you know,

230
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,390
ranch that their cattle had wandered onto
his and they used a drone to determine

231
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:27,110
this.

232
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,170
And I'm like Jesus Christ,

233
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,530
how does

234
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,060
other guy get that drove,

235
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:33,430
find out who that guy is and follow him.

236
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,470
Being the guy who can
call someone and say,

237
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:35,741
Hey,

238
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:35,951
yeah,

239
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:37,030
I'm having a cow problem,

240
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:38,080
my asshole neighbor,

241
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,270
can I borrow one of those fucking drones?

242
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,950
Can I borrow one of those Predator
things and search around this asshole's

243
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,760
property?

244
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,110
Holy Shit Man.

245
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,180
They sound like a crazy violation.

246
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:52,540
And the only thing that could catch on
him was that some cows had wandered over

247
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,470
to his property.

248
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,750
What the fuck man?

249
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:58,780
How many cows worth of money
does it cost to hire a drone?

250
00:06:58,970 --> 00:06:59,500
Yeah.

251
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,120
Was like an episode of American Dad.

252
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:02,811
You know what I mean?

253
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:05,200
Like using his power.

254
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,030
Like I just take my drone over there.

255
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,310
That's exactly what it sounds like.

256
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,140
It sounds like south park or something.

257
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:11,500
Yeah,

258
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,240
it's fucking completely ridiculous.

259
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,541
Yeah,

260
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,380
they caught the guy.

261
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,173
I should look up the,

262
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,030
the actual full story.

263
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,600
Drone use cattle case is that,

264
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,540
did you know Seth
Mcfarlane's up for a grammy?

265
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:30,370
He's against like Barbara Streisand
right now because he has a music CD now.

266
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,563
What?

267
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,290
Like he's,

268
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,100
I don't know,

269
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,790
it's like a seed,

270
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,390
like a singer.

271
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,680
Cattle Rustling family.

272
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:36,400
Maybe my,

273
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,230
my take on is wrong because
they're addressing them.

274
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:40,060
And as a cattle rustling family.

275
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,130
So they're saying that these
people were stealing Cadillac.

276
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,500
Jess armed with a search warrant that
Nelson County Sheriff Keith Janky went

277
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,150
looking for six missing cows.

278
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:49,631
Wow.

279
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:50,350
Really?

280
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,183
That's it.

281
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,270
Six cows.

282
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,270
You use a fucking drone to find six cows.

283
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,321
Wow.

284
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:57,580
This is creepy.

285
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,540
That's American data.

286
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,200
Big.

287
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,400
There's some old laws,

288
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,110
horse stealing and cattle.

289
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,850
Super Harsh.

290
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,410
Like the decisions are made,

291
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,010
but they're just,

292
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,550
this is like the first
like instances of this,

293
00:08:09,551 --> 00:08:10,090
right?

294
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,490
Is this something that like
the Patriot Act allows for?

295
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:13,563
It must be

296
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:13,870
right.

297
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,830
I think drones,

298
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,470
yeah.

299
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,900
And I'm not kidding Tam.

300
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,910
How else are we going to get fucked?

301
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:20,190
Are going have drones following us?

302
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:20,840
Or

303
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,501
even worse?

304
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,510
The Nda that just passed the,

305
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,640
the National Defense Authorization Act,

306
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,250
that's really scary
because it allows them to,

307
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,103
uh,

308
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,320
treat the United States as a battlefield
and that means that they can stop

309
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:34,250
things with troops.

310
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,460
Like they're going to use our
military against American citizens.

311
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,290
It's like a war against the people.

312
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,124
It was civil war.

313
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:40,581
I'm like,

314
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:42,260
it's really completely insane.

315
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,100
And the indefinite detention.

316
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,530
The fact that you don't
have to have a warrant.

317
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:45,741
They,

318
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:46,790
if they think you're a threat,

319
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,590
they can just attain you indefinitely.

320
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,920
You know when you see John Mccain
out there like supporting that,

321
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:52,191
you're like,

322
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:53,030
wow man,

323
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,920
you don't see where this is going to go.

324
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,980
You really

325
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,420
think that that should be allowed.

326
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,430
You start to put the pieces
of the puzzle together.

327
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:00,264
Obama,

328
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,200
you know,

329
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,800
authorizing 20,000 extra troops
here for the domestic front.

330
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,540
I think you sent a tweet out about that,

331
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,670
so scared to put the pieces together.

332
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:11,730
It looks like they know some shit's going
to go down and they're preparing for

333
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:12,840
the instance in which it does,

334
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:13,674
which is,

335
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,391
which is scary.

336
00:09:14,391 --> 00:09:19,391
It looks like the only way this would be
getting past the only way this would be

337
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:23,840
accepted by so many people and not enrage
others is that they know there's going

338
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:25,350
to be a massive civil unrest.

339
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,360
They know there's going
to be something nutty.

340
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:27,930
Yeah,

341
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,650
you get that.

342
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,760
You got that feeling for sure.

343
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,020
Although that's terrifying.

344
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:31,741
It is terrifying.

345
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:32,250
But I,

346
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,390
as I thought about it too,

347
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:36,750
I mean back in the days
where you crushed rebellions,

348
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:36,901
you know,

349
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:39,630
there's plenty of tyrannies that have
crushed rebellions throughout history.

350
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,490
There was always certain factors present.

351
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:43,530
There was a lack of
information able to circulate.

352
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:44,820
They would close down those things.

353
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,700
The governments hinting at
different ways of trying to do that,

354
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:49,350
but I don't think they'll
ever be successful.

355
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,640
The Internet's too prevalent.

356
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:51,331
It's too powerful,

357
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,110
as you've said.

358
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,351
You know,

359
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:53,640
they'll build ways around it.

360
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,091
You know,

361
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:55,350
they'll find ways to communicate.

362
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:56,184
And then also,

363
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:56,550
you know,

364
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,660
the people they were suppressing,

365
00:09:57,661 --> 00:10:02,661
we're generally not as well armed as the
people who are trying to suppress them.

366
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,410
So they had an overwhelming,

367
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,130
you know,

368
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,760
force mature of technological
superiority in their arms.

369
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,500
But this is a well armed nation and I
just can't imagine that even our troops,

370
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:13,861
the,

371
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:15,270
some that are brainwashed or not,

372
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:15,870
whatever,

373
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,510
really want to take out their
real guns against our citizens.

374
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:20,940
But the citizens when pushed hard enough,

375
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:21,571
you know,

376
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:22,110
we're all,

377
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,980
we're all armed.

378
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,050
I mean at a certain point where you know,

379
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,820
they're abusing our people grandly and
it could get really bad and I just can't

380
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:32,010
imagine that it could get to that level.

381
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,450
I can't imagine that it can either,

382
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:35,430
but it really seems like
they're preparing for it.

383
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:40,460
And when you see how things have slid
in certain parts of this country,

384
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:42,060
how far things have gone.

385
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,760
Like if you ever see like any
of the documentaries on Detroit,

386
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,130
well they show you like how bad it is.

387
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:49,380
They're now 47% illiteracy rate.

388
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,900
I mean the functional literacy rate,

389
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,690
47% that's half the people can't read.

390
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,100
And that's incredible.

391
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,120
And these houses that are,

392
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:57,450
you know,

393
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,550
up for sale for like $1,000 you know,

394
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,850
a $500 just abandoned building
after abandoned building.

395
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:03,780
It's like wow.

396
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,350
Like we know in our lifetime
that this is all changed.

397
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:07,891
We know,

398
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:10,200
we know it's possible for
things to go horribly wrong.

399
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,250
Completely fall apart.

400
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:11,851
Yeah,

401
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:12,200
I I,

402
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,901
I agree.

403
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:16,320
I just think that final step that they're
trying to prepare for as a step that's

404
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:17,940
ultimately destined for failure.

405
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:19,470
Like they won't be able
to pull that trigger.

406
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,000
It's kind of like in a nuclear,

407
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,230
in the nuclear age,

408
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:22,650
you know,

409
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,560
there's a certain level of
warfare that you just can't do.

410
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,101
You know,

411
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:30,600
like you can't get massive group of people
and attack another country that has a

412
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:32,730
nuclear armament because
they'll just use the nuke.

413
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:37,200
Like you can't push the Americans too
hard cause we're all fucking armed,

414
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:37,771
you know,

415
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:39,600
and we're all going to be able
to communicate with each other.

416
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:43,080
Like there's a certain boundary
point where it's destined to fail.

417
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:45,270
So I think they have a weird strategy.

418
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,480
It's like they're preparing for
something but the end game can't work.

419
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:52,230
Like they can't push that final button
where they put live rounds in the troops

420
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,500
and start us.

421
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:54,040
Like

422
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,020
we just will not fucking allow
that under any circumstance.

423
00:11:57,021 --> 00:12:00,430
And that's what the founders and creating
the second amendment I believe they

424
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:03,970
had in mind was not to protect against
their enemies but also against our own

425
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:04,630
government.

426
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,250
Misusing the power of the army.

427
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,000
It's funny how few people are
willing to engage that idea,

428
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:10,750
you know,

429
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,750
willing to even even throw it out there
that it's possible that there could be

430
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,890
some sort of a massive civil war in
this country and then literally we might

431
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:21,491
have troops,

432
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:26,491
American troops fighting against
Americans that nobody wants to think that.

433
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:28,330
Nobody wants to think
that that's possible.

434
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:28,661
You know?

435
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:29,321
That's why I wouldn't,

436
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:29,651
you know,

437
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:29,761
they,

438
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:31,270
they talk about the second amendment,

439
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:31,571
you know,

440
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:32,830
allowing for an armed militia.

441
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:33,130
Right.

442
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,230
Isn't that like they are
the well regulated militia.

443
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:35,521
Yeah.

444
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,130
Something like that.

445
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,671
And people go,

446
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:38,680
what do you know what your
rise against the government,

447
00:12:38,681 --> 00:12:40,930
just 10 years ago that
sounded like nonsense.

448
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,700
That sounded like the
stupidest thing in the world.

449
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:44,020
Like why the fuck would you do that?

450
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,430
This is the greatest country on earth.

451
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,170
But within the 10 years,

452
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,230
since nine 11 the deterioration of what
this country stood for to me and to I

453
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:55,360
think a lot of us,

454
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,433
it's just,

455
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,850
it's been shit on.

456
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:58,210
Yeah.

457
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:58,810
It's been,

458
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,040
it's been used.

459
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:00,874
It's just like,

460
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,110
like what we're supposed,

461
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:07,130
like one of the reasons why everybody
was so horrified after nine 11 it's like,

462
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,230
you know,

463
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,190
people who don't pay that much
attention to foreign politics,

464
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,120
they don't know exactly what
all the complaints are and what,

465
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,780
what countries were occupying,

466
00:13:16,781 --> 00:13:18,070
what's sacred land where,

467
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,390
you know,

468
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,180
we have fucking troops marching on every
day if they don't understand like what,

469
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:22,741
what the,

470
00:13:22,741 --> 00:13:27,741
the actual reason for someone being
pissed off at us for their view of the,

471
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,560
the United States,

472
00:13:29,561 --> 00:13:30,220
most likely.

473
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,690
It's like really pretty rosy.

474
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,060
Like were there like the
peacekeepers are the world and yeah,

475
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,620
Vietnam was a little shady,

476
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:37,060
but we did fuck up Hitler.

477
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:37,730
Okay.

478
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,010
And Japan was ready to take over.

479
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:41,050
We took care of that
nonsense to the Russia.

480
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:42,340
We bankrupt them bitches.

481
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:42,761
All right,

482
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:43,420
we're good.

483
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,290
We got this.

484
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,700
But you,

485
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,240
you dig deeper and you pay more attention
to it and you go look at what could

486
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:50,560
happen in 10 years.

487
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,650
Look how it can just slide
away from you in 10 years.

488
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,150
Things like the Patriot Act,

489
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:58,510
things like tapping into people's fucking
cell phones on a regular basis with no

490
00:13:58,511 --> 00:13:59,141
warrants.

491
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:04,141
And the fact that the Patriot Act was
only used a handful of times for actual

492
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:05,920
terrorist attacks,

493
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,850
but was used hundreds and
thousands of times for drugs.

494
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,520
Hundreds and thousands of times.

495
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:13,720
I forget the real number,

496
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:18,670
but it was just a ridiculous
disproportionate number
were the majority of the

497
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:20,740
Times they use the
Patriot Act was for drugs.

498
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,850
That's what people,

499
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,181
yeah,

500
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:24,010
I mean if you allow that power,

501
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,500
it's going to be used in
whatever means possible.

502
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:27,334
That's why,

503
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:27,671
you know,

504
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:31,720
preventing these things like that act
that just passed is so vital because you

505
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:32,920
give a law,

506
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:33,221
you know,

507
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:34,900
you let a lot pass with one intention.

508
00:14:34,901 --> 00:14:35,051
Well,

509
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:36,730
it doesn't really matter
what the intentions are.

510
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,280
Even the people trying to pass
a may have those intentions,

511
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:41,650
but ultimately with that power enabled,

512
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,610
the corruption is inevitable and it
happens extremely fast and that's even a

513
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,230
benevolent kind of view.

514
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:48,190
The other view is,

515
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,551
yeah,

516
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:52,040
we'll get it passed under these auspices
and then we'll really use it to,

517
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,551
you know,

518
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:53,690
to do whatever their other men,

519
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,410
their means are so set up
that they have now where the,

520
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,480
they're allowed to like come up with
laws and then these few handful of

521
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,460
motherfuckers that have
gotten to the cool kids party,

522
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,330
they get to vote on everything that
it goes through the Senate and it goes

523
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:09,950
through Congress and they agreed to it.

524
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,480
And then if the president doesn't veto it,

525
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:12,290
that's it.

526
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,041
It went through this,

527
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:13,311
you know,

528
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:14,360
x amount of people,

529
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:19,361
300 million people are changed now and
affected by this corrupt stupid fucking

530
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,420
shit bag unconstitutional idea that these
fuckheads past and it's just somehow

531
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:27,680
or another they're allowed to do that.

532
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,380
That's a red [inaudible]
form of government.

533
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:30,921
I mean,

534
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:31,731
that's ridiculous.

535
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:32,001
I don't care.

536
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:32,211
I mean,

537
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:32,781
you know,

538
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:33,980
representative or not,

539
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:34,970
that's stupid.

540
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:39,620
That's a terrible way for really
important shit to get introduced into our

541
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:40,454
culture.

542
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,150
You know,

543
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,420
and the fact that that is
the way the system is set up,

544
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:49,040
it's like ultimately the whole thing
needs to be like radically overhauled.

545
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,260
It's not like a little minor tweak.

546
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,400
It needs to be radically overhauled
because there's so much that gets done and

547
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:57,050
so much that sucks out there.

548
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:58,320
That's just be just,

549
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,240
we just follow it because it's written
somewhere and because everybody agreed to

550
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:02,960
it at one point in time.

551
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,240
But as we've gotten older and you know,

552
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:08,780
you get a much better grasp on how
fucked up the world really is and how

553
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:12,290
ridiculous some of the laws that are
in place and what the actual origin of

554
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:16,220
those laws are and if the fact that
they're actually based in real clear and

555
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,500
measurable corruption and you know,

556
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:21,950
it should be like a fuck load of people
should be in jail is what it should be,

557
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,521
you know?

558
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:25,700
But instead it just kind
of like it is the law.

559
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,451
It's the way it is.

560
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:27,350
It's on the paper.

561
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,521
I think there's,

562
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:28,731
you know,

563
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:30,020
there's two ways to approach it.

564
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:32,450
And I think one of the interesting
things that we're going to do is,

565
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,020
uh,

566
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,853
you know,

567
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,551
there's two problems.

568
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:35,900
One is what's wrong with,

569
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,750
you know,

570
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,590
the currently the society that
we're in and how to bridge that gap.

571
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,010
But I think as important as
anything is to just start fresh,

572
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:44,330
take away all that momentum,

573
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,313
all of those,

574
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:45,570
you know,

575
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,010
different people trained in the different
ways what you expect and just kind of

576
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:51,980
start from scratch and say if
you could start from scratch,

577
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,410
you know,

578
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,570
how could you set this up?

579
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:57,650
Knowing what we know now and knowing
the different pathways that history of

580
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:58,484
already paid,

581
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,080
how do you prevent these disasters?

582
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:01,340
How do you prevent this corruption?

583
00:17:01,341 --> 00:17:04,760
How do you create a model that will
create momentum going the other way?

584
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,450
And then the question just becomes how
do you bridge these two situations?

585
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:09,284
Is it possible?

586
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,130
Is it possible to go from our current
situation to the ideal situation?

587
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,791
If so,

588
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,440
how?

589
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,820
And then,

590
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,750
and then kind of fill that in
with the real issue is financial.

591
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:17,961
Like,

592
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:19,070
what do you do with all the money?

593
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,180
Do you divvy it up?

594
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,010
What do you do?

595
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,350
You know?

596
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,010
And there's a lot of people out there
that are at zero right now that would love

597
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,230
that they would love,

598
00:17:26,231 --> 00:17:28,370
like everybody gets a fair shake,

599
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:29,120
man.

600
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,440
Everybody gets a fear piece,

601
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,270
which is not supposed to be how it is.

602
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:36,140
Everybody has the opportunity to go out
and make money by whatever means you

603
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:36,861
want to do it.

604
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:38,780
And if your means or unsuccessful,

605
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:40,190
it doesn't mean the system sucks.

606
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,290
It means that for whatever reason,

607
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,710
whether you're in a saturated
environment or whether you know the,

608
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,990
the job that you want is highly,

609
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,380
highly touted and it's one
that everybody wants to get.

610
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:52,620
And there's a lot of competition.

611
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:53,431
Is that what it is?

612
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:54,540
What is the reason?

613
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,880
Ultimately you're not able
to do what you're doing,

614
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,451
you know?

615
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,910
Because it's gotta be a reason for it.

616
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,331
Yes.

617
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:03,030
The situation we're currently
in economically sucks,

618
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,420
but I think a lot of these dudes
are just willing to lay down.

619
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,040
A lot of these dudes are willing to go,

620
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:08,780
it's rigged.

621
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,511
Thing is rigged,

622
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:09,751
man.

623
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:10,320
I can't,

624
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,260
they're not even willing to try
to figure out some way through it.

625
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,960
We all know that at the
beginning of you what I mean,

626
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,070
I'm sure you must've felt this a points
in your life and I certainly felt it as

627
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:21,600
a a struggling comedian.

628
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,490
There's point points where you know,

629
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:25,500
you feel like you're not going to make it.

630
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:25,771
You know,

631
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,010
you feel like this is ridiculous pursuit.

632
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:29,431
I'm going to,

633
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:30,810
I'm a fucking failure,

634
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,261
you know,

635
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:31,680
this is,

636
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,071
and if,

637
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:32,310
if,

638
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,731
if I,

639
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:36,270
if I was doing that and then I thought
if I had these like self defeating

640
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:38,310
thoughts and then I thought
that the system was rigged.

641
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,230
Like if I was,

642
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,720
you know,

643
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,270
going to college to get some
sort of a job in business,

644
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:44,220
then I realized this system is rigged.

645
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,331
And now I'm,

646
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:47,730
I mean that's self defeating stage
and then I'm marching around.

647
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,580
That might not necessarily
be the best move for you.

648
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,061
Yeah,

649
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:51,301
no,

650
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:54,840
that's gonna that's gonna cause an
end to this situation prematurely.

651
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,550
Sure.

652
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:59,670
People recognize that about any big giant
movement is that they're not entirely

653
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,340
pure.

654
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:00,690
Oh sure.

655
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,021
You know,

656
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:04,500
like there's a lot of people that are in
this occupy movement that make a lot of

657
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:05,250
fucking sense.

658
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,000
There's a lot of people that are saying
a lot of really important shit and then

659
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:11,640
there's a lot of crazy
assholes pee themselves.

660
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,803
Exactly.

661
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,360
I read,

662
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,680
I read an interesting piece on that
and there is a Dutch economist,

663
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:18,460
I think it's got a Haber mass and uh,

664
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,770
his point was that they're leading this
almost anarchist movement without any

665
00:19:22,771 --> 00:19:27,771
set defined principles as a form of kind
of awareness for self correction by the

666
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:31,350
majority basically saying that
there's nothing that they can say,

667
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:31,981
no bill,

668
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:32,880
no law,

669
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,900
no rule that will be respected enough
to actually come out and say do this

670
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,990
because the whole system is so corrupt
and nepotistic and circular that somehow,

671
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:42,751
you know,

672
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:45,210
they would get that concession
and then it would be over.

673
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,210
But by creating this kind of anarchist
state where they're just in certain areas

674
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:51,210
and they're just there,

675
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,940
they're causing people
like us to be more aware,

676
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:58,800
to heighten that sense of self awareness
and self critical side side of things

677
00:19:58,801 --> 00:20:03,090
and may actually affect the majority to
change and a much broader level than if

678
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:05,370
they actually had demands and
actually started to do it.

679
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,090
So yeah,

680
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,470
I mean you can criticize the people.

681
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:08,970
I mean I think I've said it before,

682
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:11,430
playing hacky sack out
on the Austin City Hall,

683
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:11,971
you know,

684
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:14,580
it's not exactly going to inspire
the most amount of people,

685
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,970
but it is going to cause people to
talk about it and cause you know,

686
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:19,230
room for self reflection.

687
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:22,800
And I think that kind of
anarchist protest almost,

688
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:23,481
which one it is,

689
00:20:23,481 --> 00:20:24,060
is,

690
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,320
is effective in that way.

691
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,041
Yeah.

692
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,730
I think it definitely gets an energy out
there and that energy is most certainly

693
00:20:29,731 --> 00:20:32,850
interpreted with no question whatsoever.

694
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,290
And everybody's mad,

695
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,580
this is not good.

696
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:36,414
We're not happy.

697
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,560
And we were so unhappy that
we're going to camp out in tents.

698
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,090
Yeah.

699
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:40,380
You know,

700
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,790
it's really kind of ridiculous.

701
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:42,001
I mean,

702
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:42,720
and then it didn't.

703
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,040
Then it has to be,

704
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,890
do we unite with these people
and try to bring them all back or

705
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,730
is it us against them and when it becomes
us against them and then they start

706
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:56,140
preparing for us against them
with like this NDA passage,

707
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,801
you know,

708
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:57,940
that's what it sounds like to me.

709
00:20:57,941 --> 00:20:59,950
It sounds like they're
preparing for some sort of a,

710
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,620
almost a military style,

711
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:04,330
civil unrest in this country.

712
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,111
Well,

713
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:05,891
the pain is on,

714
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,300
they just minor at this point.

715
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:08,230
Really nothing.

716
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:09,310
Look what's going on in Egypt,

717
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:09,461
man.

718
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:09,700
Yeah.

719
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,570
Did you see some of these,

720
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:11,050
uh,

721
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,400
these beatings in Egypt,

722
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,130
they are beating the fuck
out of these protesters,

723
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:15,371
man.

724
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:15,671
I mean,

725
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:16,630
beat him to death.

726
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,580
It's horrendous man.

727
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,810
Horrendous Shit.

728
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,771
It's really,

729
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:22,860
really hard to watch these
people running on the street.

730
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:26,410
There are hundreds of them and they
encounter like one or two protesters and

731
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,590
just club the fuck out of them
while they're unconscious.

732
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:33,730
They're jumping on them and booting him
in the head and cracking them full blast

733
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:36,430
in the head with Bhutan's
while they're unconscious.

734
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,680
They s this guy jumped on this woman.

735
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,090
One guy was dragging her and this
guy jumped and stomped on her chest.

736
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,781
She was a woman.

737
00:21:43,781 --> 00:21:45,060
She had a bra on.

738
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,390
It was like a blue bra.

739
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,400
She was skinny and he just jumped
up and stomped down on our chest.

740
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,260
It is inhumane.

741
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,930
It's horrific to watch and you know,

742
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,291
that's,

743
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:58,000
that country right now is fucked.

744
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,361
There's,

745
00:21:58,361 --> 00:21:59,194
you know,

746
00:21:59,390 --> 00:21:59,770
it's,

747
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,480
it's the new boss.

748
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,830
Same as the old boss,

749
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,401
you know,

750
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:07,600
all the sudden this guy who had been
running shit as a dictator for 20 plus

751
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:08,740
years has gone.

752
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,630
And who the fuck runs things?

753
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:10,841
No,

754
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:11,290
I do.

755
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:11,531
No,

756
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:12,100
I do.

757
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,270
And then there's a jocking and
there's just crazy lawlessness now.

758
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:17,680
It's horrific to watch,

759
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:18,370
man.

760
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,091
When you see that,

761
00:22:19,091 --> 00:22:21,310
when you see these
protesters getting beaten,

762
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:23,830
like that man that the savagery involved,

763
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:24,730
it's just like,

764
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:25,211
man,

765
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,880
you have no concern for
their health or wellbeing.

766
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:29,920
It was like if people were running,

767
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:30,371
shooting,

768
00:22:30,371 --> 00:22:32,050
just running and shooting guns,

769
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,650
running forward towards these people
towards the protest to and just shooting

770
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:36,484
guns,

771
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,230
I'm in it.

772
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,190
They are not taking it.

773
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,970
Where do you see that video on Youtube?

774
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:40,350
Man,

775
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,940
it was on youtube
because it's not graphic.

776
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:44,290
You can't see any blood or anything.

777
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,771
You know,

778
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:46,690
it's like kind of shitty quality.

779
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,490
What's up with shitty quality nowadays?

780
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,420
I mean come on.

781
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,170
Yeah,

782
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:50,381
yeah,

783
00:22:50,381 --> 00:22:50,720
right.

784
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,470
She has some old ass
fucking Motorola cell phone.

785
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,321
Yeah.

786
00:22:54,321 --> 00:22:55,570
I mean that's what it was filmed on.

787
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:55,801
I don't know.

788
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:58,690
It was filmed on now you know where you
dropped it as cell phones off in the

789
00:22:58,691 --> 00:22:59,261
boxes.

790
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:00,610
Lance is like donate your cell phones.

791
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:02,260
I it goes to Egypt,

792
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,100
it goes to anywhere in
the world is fucked up.

793
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:06,550
Yeah.

794
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,221
I think the,

795
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:07,600
the,

796
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,520
the economic pain that
were kind of feeling,

797
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,061
it's bad.

798
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:14,350
I mean definitely a lot of people are
hurting but it's not too great depression

799
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,190
levels right now.

800
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,641
You know,

801
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:19,600
it's not even to levels that we've already
seen happen before here in America.

802
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:23,740
And I think everybody recognizes that
we are right now in a very unshaking

803
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,350
exactly.

804
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,720
Foundation one.

805
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,300
And when it gets worse,

806
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,920
then the occupy movement,

807
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,370
I mean,

808
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:30,851
what's going to,

809
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:32,130
cause you know,

810
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,540
the people who are on the fringe
to just come out in numbers.

811
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:37,750
I think there'll be a kind of a tipping
point effect where people are going to

812
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:38,051
be like,

813
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:38,884
fuck this.

814
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,930
Fuck the corruption in the government.

815
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:41,890
We need a new system.

816
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:42,310
You know,

817
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,530
we need to stop spending
money to bail out the banks.

818
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:46,130
We need what you less so ever

819
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,130
convinced the government to revamp the
system and take away their power and how

820
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,300
they would ever do that.

821
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:54,860
It takes an uprising like that.

822
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:55,670
I mean it takes,

823
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,850
it takes the people to cause the movement
and when has the government ever done

824
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:00,860
shit without the people moving first.

825
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:04,340
I mean women's suffrage for example of
women weren't marching around doing that

826
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:04,670
thing.

827
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,140
They may still not be able to vote.

828
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,010
I mean it takes the people rising up
in order to change the government's the

829
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:12,260
only fucking way because
power is going to breed power.

830
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,690
They're going to just keep
the snitch system status quo.

831
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,110
I mean maybe one or two examples
where Lincoln abolish slavery,

832
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:18,500
you know,

833
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,460
on his own kind of,

834
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,770
before there was massive upscale,

835
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:23,120
but that was during a time of war.

836
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:24,290
It had certain advantages,

837
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:24,551
et cetera.

838
00:24:24,551 --> 00:24:26,990
There is a variety of different
things involved in that,

839
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:31,040
but it's always the people who demand
something first that caused the government

840
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:31,520
to change.

841
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,450
And I think,

842
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:32,841
you know,

843
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:35,780
right now people are talking
and they're talking voice.

844
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,230
I think pretty soon they're going to
have to start yelling and I think that's

845
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,240
ultimately what's going
to happen and change.

846
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:42,770
But before they start yelling,

847
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,380
unfortunately they'd asked to hurt worse.

848
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,260
And I think that's probably
where we're heading,

849
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:48,770
you know,

850
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,240
as to is the more economical,

851
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:52,070
and I never thought this
was going to be going down.

852
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,400
I remember when you were younger when
Clinton was president and looked like the

853
00:24:55,401 --> 00:24:59,210
world is just a rosy fucking
beautiful place to be.

854
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:05,170
I miss that guy just he
was just a comfortable guy.

855
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,400
What an amazing and a comfortable time.

856
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,353
20 years,

857
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:12,200
20 years a world has just changed
beyond recognition almost.

858
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,300
But I think it's part of
the natural cycle of things.

859
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:14,571
I mean,

860
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:16,970
things don't go in a steady curve.

861
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:18,440
They have to go in these cycles.

862
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,030
These,

863
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,670
you know,

864
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,440
gets way too far out of line.

865
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:23,270
Then it maybe goes back
too far the other way.

866
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:23,810
I mean,

867
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,610
probably there'll be a point where,

868
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,090
you know,

869
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:28,610
the sentiments get too roused
in the other direction.

870
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:28,821
You're like,

871
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:29,121
wait,

872
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:29,331
wait,

873
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:29,811
wait a minute.

874
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:30,021
You know,

875
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:30,801
we gotta have banks,

876
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:33,440
we've got to have this need
to keep civilization together.

877
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,090
We need credit cards.

878
00:25:35,091 --> 00:25:36,870
I don't want to be carrying gold bullion.

879
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,750
Let's pull the shit together.

880
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,000
God,

881
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,500
goddammit.

882
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,040
Yeah.

883
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,873
It's just,

884
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:41,810
you know,

885
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,643
we've got to get rid of,

886
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,480
you got to get rid of that stock market.

887
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,520
I watched that fucking thing on TV.

888
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:47,660
I sound like a grandpa.

889
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,070
I watched that stock market.

890
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,060
We've got to get rid of that.

891
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,500
But I watched it on TV.

892
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:56,030
I was watching some won some financial
report and there's the ticker tape going

893
00:25:56,031 --> 00:25:56,741
on because it,

894
00:25:56,741 --> 00:25:58,670
cause it's like an alien program to me.

895
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,500
The ticker tapes going on beneath it.

896
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,131
And then,

897
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:01,401
you know,

898
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:03,350
this guy starts talking about,

899
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:03,830
uh,

900
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,101
you know,

901
00:26:04,101 --> 00:26:07,760
a lack of confidence in this company
and a confidence that there's a lot of

902
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:10,940
confidence behind this company and
I'm watching these numbers spin.

903
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:11,211
I'm like,

904
00:26:11,211 --> 00:26:12,650
this is insanity.

905
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,461
This is like,

906
00:26:13,461 --> 00:26:14,121
these guys are like,

907
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:14,601
there's like a,

908
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:15,740
a virus,

909
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,130
a virus of numbers is
horrible like hurricane,

910
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:20,750
like virus of numbers.

911
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,750
And then there's a few people in there
that sort of know how to decipher it and

912
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:27,260
they're pulling numbers out and seeing
which way the waves are blowing.

913
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:27,801
I'm like,

914
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:31,670
what a wacky fucking
system based on confidence.

915
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:32,720
What?

916
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,500
Based on how people feel about companies
and shit and whether or not a new

917
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:37,610
product just came out,

918
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:39,890
oh we're going to buy by apple by,

919
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:40,610
by,

920
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,510
and you can actually,

921
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:41,991
you know,

922
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:43,620
you can affect that somehow.

923
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:44,460
Like what,

924
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,390
what kind of,

925
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,120
what,

926
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,070
what are we basing on any of our
time on this wonky shit for this is a

927
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:51,170
ridiculous set up.

928
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,140
The speculatory frenzy around stocks and
these things is pretty outrageous and

929
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:55,591
it really,

930
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:57,960
it takes away from what
originally the idea is,

931
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:58,741
which is to own a,

932
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:02,430
share an interest in a company that you
thought was going to make money and do

933
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,350
things as a positive form of investment.

934
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:04,830
You know,

935
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,050
ultimately really wacky.

936
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,950
Was it the Reagan administration when,

937
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,381
when they,

938
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:11,670
when were they allowed to do,

939
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:15,810
like when did they allow women to let
loud have like derivatives and stuff?

940
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,930
Probably in the 80s in
the 80 [inaudible] got it.

941
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:23,820
Got The wackiest cause the markets were
still pretty new in the 70s and things.

942
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:24,090
I mean,

943
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,450
but the stock market has had
its nonsenses since the 1920s.

944
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:31,830
I mean you can read the big crash of
the stock operator and there was some of

945
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:32,664
the same madness,

946
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,880
but there were safeguards who were put
in place after the big crash of the

947
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:36,450
whatever it was,

948
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,980
the 20s into Great Depression.

949
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:38,790
Um,

950
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,151
there was,

951
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:41,790
there were safeguards that are put in
place that were eventually dropped,

952
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:42,120
right?

953
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,953
Weren't there?

954
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,381
Yeah.

955
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:43,651
I mean,

956
00:27:43,651 --> 00:27:45,900
depending on how much the market
can drop in a certain day,

957
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:48,000
basically limits so it can go limit down.

958
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:48,210
There's,

959
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,620
there's a lot of those
things in different,

960
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,660
in different commodities markets as well.

961
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,240
There'll be a limit to how far
the price can move in one day.

962
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,550
But the thing is that's just per day.

963
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:59,520
They don't limit it permanently cause
that would cause massive inefficiency.

964
00:27:59,521 --> 00:28:03,810
So it just kinda curves that
initial panic like holy fuck,

965
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,860
we got to sell everything,

966
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:05,161
sell,

967
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:05,401
sell,

968
00:28:05,401 --> 00:28:05,701
sell,

969
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:09,960
and then lots of way below where it needs
to and then the margin calls kick in

970
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:10,794
and then people,

971
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:11,490
you know,

972
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,330
lose all their money.

973
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:13,440
They're jumping out of buildings.

974
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,370
It's just a mess.

975
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,563
At that point.

976
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,260
They tried to curb that
so ridiculous this buy,

977
00:28:19,261 --> 00:28:19,501
buy,

978
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:19,831
buy,

979
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:20,191
sell,

980
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:20,461
sell,

981
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:20,790
sell.

982
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:24,240
It seems so ridiculous that
accompany could actually,

983
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:29,241
like we'll go by that like that could
have any sense whatsoever in the world of

984
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:30,750
business and still,

985
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,730
but looking at these equity markets,

986
00:28:32,731 --> 00:28:34,830
they're way better off
than the credit markets.

987
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:36,040
Then the debt markets,

988
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,680
that's where all of
these problems are going.

989
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:40,290
People swap and debt and
derivatives and all of these things.

990
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:40,620
I mean,

991
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,700
at least these are companies,

992
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:43,440
at least ultimately at the end of the day,

993
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,440
you can poke a CEO and the
chest and hold something,

994
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:49,650
a service or a product that
he created at the company,

995
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:50,740
created a,

996
00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:51,031
you know,

997
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:52,260
all of these other pieces.

998
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:52,810
What are they?

999
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,790
There's these numbers that are circulated
in a variety of ways where everybody

1000
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:58,280
makes money and if you lose money,

1001
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:58,801
guess what?

1002
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:00,930
You don't lose money because the
government will bail you out.

1003
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,890
So how the fuck are they
not going to do that?

1004
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,531
A no risk.

1005
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:05,790
It's a no risk situation.

1006
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,391
You know?

1007
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:06,601
Let's,

1008
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:06,841
yeah,

1009
00:29:06,841 --> 00:29:07,950
let's be super aggressive.

1010
00:29:07,951 --> 00:29:08,790
Let's be super risky.

1011
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:10,110
We'll make a bunch of money on the way up.

1012
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,093
If we lose,

1013
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,030
no big deal.

1014
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:13,200
Uncle Sam will come in,

1015
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:14,034
they'll pay it all.

1016
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,670
I mean,

1017
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,470
how are we not expected
for them to have it?

1018
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:19,770
That's why I think one of my biggest
beefs with the occupy Wall Street movement

1019
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:20,280
is,

1020
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,650
you know,

1021
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,470
really should be occupy Washington.

1022
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:22,920
I mean,

1023
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,390
you're telling these sharks that,

1024
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:24,810
hey,

1025
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,560
play this game.

1026
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,570
You can make all the money
you want and if you lose,

1027
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,590
we're going to bail you out.

1028
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:28,831
Well,

1029
00:29:28,831 --> 00:29:29,580
who's fault is that?

1030
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,361
They're going to be sharks.

1031
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:31,410
Sharks are going to be sharks.

1032
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,810
These men are putting their
positions for being greedy,

1033
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,780
for being the most aggressive in their,

1034
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,643
in their,

1035
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,790
of their class.

1036
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,160
And then we're expecting them
to behave in these dramatically

1037
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,870
moral ways and not do it.

1038
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:44,081
No,

1039
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:46,240
it's not going to happen if they have no,

1040
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:46,870
you know,

1041
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,670
no room for failure at the end of the day.

1042
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,050
Why the fuck wouldn't they do that?

1043
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,930
Has there ever been a stock market movie
where they weren't really in it for the

1044
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:55,270
money and they would just
kind of really cool guys.

1045
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:58,470
So a lot of principals
stock market moving.

1046
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,830
I saw a tower heist with
the Eddie Murphy and um,

1047
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,550
um,

1048
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,310
uh,

1049
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,090
who the fuck is it?

1050
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:04,923
The other guy,

1051
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,970
Ben Stiller.

1052
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,770
Jesus Christ.

1053
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,070
How can I blank on Ben Stiller?

1054
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,270
Hilarious fucking movie.

1055
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:10,810
Really.

1056
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,643
But again,

1057
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,663
evil banker,

1058
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,283
you know,

1059
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,940
evil stock market guy.

1060
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,280
Is there ever a nice stock market guy?

1061
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:18,671
Like,

1062
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:19,001
you know,

1063
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:20,830
think about like a boiler room.

1064
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,970
Everyone's doing coke.

1065
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,110
Everyone's fucking crazy.

1066
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:24,190
They're all over the edge.

1067
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,190
Is there a stock market movie
where everybody's like really cool?

1068
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,540
It's a breed of animal.

1069
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,950
It's like I to go to work with
pictures of their kids Bible passages.

1070
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,040
It's like asking if there's a great
white shark movie where the shark doesn't

1071
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,030
eat the fuck out of people.

1072
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:37,210
Go.

1073
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:37,471
Yeah,

1074
00:30:37,471 --> 00:30:38,291
get the fuck out of people.

1075
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:39,940
It's just the nature of the beast.

1076
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:41,140
I mean there's some great stock guys,

1077
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:41,980
I've known a lot of them,

1078
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,450
some great hedge fund managers,

1079
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:44,284
I've known a lot of them,

1080
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:44,950
but you know,

1081
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,580
ultimately they are super aggressive and
they're going to take advantage of any

1082
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:49,570
market that they see.

1083
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:53,290
There's a dude I used to do taekwondo
with who became a stock market guy and I

1084
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:55,150
didn't see him for a couple
of weeks and I saw him.

1085
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:57,370
It was like he had a suit
on and shit and I was like,

1086
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:58,161
what are you doing man?

1087
00:30:58,161 --> 00:30:58,331
I'm like,

1088
00:30:58,331 --> 00:30:59,141
what's going on with you?

1089
00:30:59,141 --> 00:30:59,471
And he's like,

1090
00:30:59,471 --> 00:30:59,821
look dude,

1091
00:30:59,821 --> 00:31:00,970
I'm fucking selling stocks.

1092
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:01,810
Fuck it.

1093
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,510
He was like this really
aggressive psycho dude.

1094
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:04,930
Yeah.

1095
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:08,410
And all of a sudden he was like really
into this game of selling stocks,

1096
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:11,590
but the way he was talking about was
like it was going to financial war every

1097
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,060
day.

1098
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,240
He will fuck them bitches up,

1099
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:13,421
bro.

1100
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:13,780
We got,

1101
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,250
we got the fucking best team.

1102
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,000
They know.

1103
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,020
Let me invest so many money.

1104
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:18,250
Get the fuck Outta here.

1105
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:18,431
What?

1106
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:19,740
This crazy ass hole.

1107
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:21,521
No,

1108
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:22,190
I know.

1109
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,110
It's a silly system.

1110
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,310
Weird.

1111
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:27,040
Show me your impersonation
of a sad north Korean.

1112
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,300
Oh,

1113
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,760
oh.

1114
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,510
Stepping down.

1115
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,470
It's like the worst acting ever.

1116
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,300
Every time a camera's on them.

1117
00:31:37,301 --> 00:31:38,270
Like you're sad,

1118
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,623
you're sad.

1119
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,160
Fallen down.

1120
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:43,180
Oh

1121
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:43,871
pressing,

1122
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:44,950
no tears,

1123
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,873
no tears.

1124
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,620
Documentary the other day in that country,

1125
00:31:47,621 --> 00:31:49,690
and this was right before he died,

1126
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:50,410
I was like,

1127
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:54,040
I watched this and it was showing
like how all the kids are like,

1128
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:57,130
people are blind and North Korea,

1129
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:58,420
they're going blind because their,

1130
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,050
their diets are so bad that they're
getting cataracts and there was kids,

1131
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,750
just tons of kids with
cataracts because there,

1132
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,100
how poor their diet is.

1133
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,520
I mean,

1134
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,090
wow,

1135
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,811
40%.

1136
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:12,811
I think it was a 40 or 45% of the
children in North Korea are starving like,

1137
00:32:13,301 --> 00:32:13,810
like,

1138
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,170
like,

1139
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,970
like dying because of starvation.

1140
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,580
If you're interested in any of this,

1141
00:32:17,581 --> 00:32:20,070
go to vice guide for North Korea.

1142
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,010
Go to vice.com and check out the thing
that they have up cause they have a,

1143
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:24,530
uh,

1144
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,830
a bunch of shit today,

1145
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:27,870
including all this North Korean,

1146
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:28,410
uh,

1147
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:32,840
labor camp footage where they have
all the little slaves slave footage.

1148
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:33,921
That's crazy.

1149
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:34,310
And that's,

1150
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,140
that's what the whole country,

1151
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,870
uh,

1152
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:38,930
is around those slave.

1153
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:39,980
That's what makes the

1154
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,930
fear that makes all these people act
this way is because of the slave camps.

1155
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,231
Yeah.

1156
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:45,620
The people have no power there.

1157
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:45,801
I mean,

1158
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:47,000
it's really amazing what,

1159
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,680
and when you see a dictatorship,

1160
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:50,060
like it's horrific.

1161
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:50,810
It's,

1162
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:51,181
you know,

1163
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:51,360
it's,

1164
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,230
it's the worst way a human
being can be treated,

1165
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,360
but it's also quite impressive.

1166
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,310
It's really amazing that some guy is
just allowed to just straight run shit.

1167
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,061
You know,

1168
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:03,170
like in Thailand,

1169
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:05,600
some American just got locked up in jail,

1170
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:08,770
I think for a year for
talking bad about the king.

1171
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,273
The king,

1172
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,120
the king actually doesn't even run.

1173
00:33:12,121 --> 00:33:12,170
Yeah.

1174
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:15,130
In the country in Thailand as far
as I remember from when I was like,

1175
00:33:15,131 --> 00:33:16,280
you can't talk shit about it.

1176
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,320
But there is a special rule about,

1177
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:19,850
about talking bad about the king.

1178
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,241
You know,

1179
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:20,541
it's a,

1180
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:25,010
it's a weird situation where they have
some kind of control on the verbiage

1181
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:25,671
towards the king,

1182
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,970
but he actually has not as
much governmental power as,

1183
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:29,810
um,

1184
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,700
as the general other Thai leaders.

1185
00:33:31,701 --> 00:33:34,310
I don't know what they have as
far as that's interesting person,

1186
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:34,940
but yeah.

1187
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,721
He apparently,

1188
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:37,580
he's like legitimately beloved.

1189
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,593
Yeah,

1190
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,533
yeah,

1191
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:40,190
yeah.

1192
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,030
It's not amazing.

1193
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,320
Wow.

1194
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:42,770
Yeah.

1195
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,090
That's a strange fucking place,

1196
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:44,660
man,

1197
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,080
is

1198
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,350
do you think we're withdrawing our troops
so we can send them into North Korea?

1199
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:48,981
Dude,

1200
00:33:48,981 --> 00:33:49,970
we're not going on North Korea.

1201
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,530
No minerals in North Korea.

1202
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:55,880
There's no goal in North Korea is there's
a whole country of people that are

1203
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,361
kind of,

1204
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:56,691
I don't know.

1205
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:57,860
That's kind of Nazi shit,

1206
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:58,461
in my opinion,

1207
00:33:58,461 --> 00:33:58,970
is,

1208
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,270
well,

1209
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,950
it's Communist.

1210
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:03,440
Dictatorship is 100% like that.

1211
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,501
I mean it's,

1212
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,020
it's actually worse than Nazi,

1213
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:06,690
right?

1214
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:06,981
I mean,

1215
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:07,820
I don't want to say worse,

1216
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:09,260
but you don't think it's team America?

1217
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:10,970
Same exact vein of it,

1218
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,271
you know?

1219
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:11,541
I mean,

1220
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:14,900
they're not out there causing
genocide and attacking other nations,

1221
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:15,670
but I mean,

1222
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,371
they're puking,

1223
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:16,730
you know,

1224
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,320
that's a terrible way to live.

1225
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,190
You know what about it?

1226
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,870
They said that Kim Jong was the
number one buyer of Hennessy,

1227
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,870
number one single person that
buys the most of Hennessy.

1228
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,300
Do you almost imagine kind
of fucking rapper parties?

1229
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,021
He must have had,

1230
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:31,790
rappers are so mad about that right now,

1231
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:32,720
that price they're going to,

1232
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,490
they're going to change that.

1233
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:33,970
Do you think,

1234
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,030
do you think maybe that the,

1235
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,060
that we have our planning
set up by the way?

1236
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,341
No,

1237
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,390
it's 100% true.

1238
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,530
I swear to fucking God,

1239
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:39,901
look it up.

1240
00:34:39,901 --> 00:34:40,490
Leave you.

1241
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:45,200
But do you think maybe that we a poisoned
Kim Jong to give him a heart attack

1242
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:47,660
and you think what were planning
all this to go to North Korea?

1243
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,243
No,

1244
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,600
he's an old dude.

1245
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,050
But it is kind of fun if you want to be
a conspiracy theorist and really start

1246
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,910
thinking about it and think about,

1247
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,480
you know,

1248
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,480
Gadhafi and Osama bin Ladin and
Kim Jong Il and all Mubarak's gone.

1249
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,500
Think about all these
people who've been moved,

1250
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:10,130
replace or died just really recently.

1251
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,330
It's like,

1252
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,150
have you ever seen a general Anthony?

1253
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,300
What does is no,

1254
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,153
Wesley Clark,

1255
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,200
do you remember that guy that was
running for president for awhile?

1256
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,723
He's a,

1257
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:20,870
I think he's a general,

1258
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,090
some bad ass army guy.

1259
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:23,930
And uh,

1260
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:24,200
let me,

1261
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,610
let me look it up so I can give him

1262
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,513
the right.

1263
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:31,170
May just be part of this sign of the
times have changed that it's kind of

1264
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,490
sweeping over everybody.

1265
00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:35,040
It seems like there's
this tumultuous period,

1266
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:35,370
you know,

1267
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,050
as we're coming into this this age,

1268
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,370
it's causing change

1269
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,810
to happen at a more rapid rate.

1270
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,240
You,

1271
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,621
Brian,

1272
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:41,880
pull up the plan.

1273
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,050
I want you to pull up the plan
according to General Wesley Clark.

1274
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:50,190
You can just Google Wesley Clark General
Wesley Clark and this'll come up in

1275
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,024
youtube.

1276
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,660
Um,

1277
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:56,660
but my point was this general Wesley
Clark actually in I believe it was 2007 he

1278
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,200
predicted all of this and he said,

1279
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,040
this is the plan.

1280
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,000
This is what they want to do.

1281
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:04,110
They're going to get rid of Gaddafi.

1282
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:05,220
They're going to go into this country.

1283
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:08,190
They're going to take over an Iraq
who are going to kill Saddam Hussein.

1284
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:08,670
I mean,

1285
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,770
he like literally spells it out.

1286
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,120
Everything that we did,

1287
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:12,340
right?

1288
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,520
10 days after nine 11,

1289
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:18,550
I went to the Pentagon and I shot
Secretary Rumsfeld and and deputy searcher

1290
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:18,970
woeful,

1291
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:22,510
which I went downstairs just shale over
some of the people on the joint staff

1292
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:23,860
who would use general western crying.

1293
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,330
One of the generals call me and he said,

1294
00:36:25,331 --> 00:36:25,511
sir,

1295
00:36:25,511 --> 00:36:28,480
you got to come in and you got to
come in and talk to me a second.

1296
00:36:28,481 --> 00:36:28,691
I said,

1297
00:36:28,691 --> 00:36:28,781
well,

1298
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:29,351
you're too busy.

1299
00:36:29,351 --> 00:36:29,591
He said,

1300
00:36:29,591 --> 00:36:29,851
no,

1301
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:30,520
no.

1302
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,353
He says,

1303
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,400
we've made the decision.

1304
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:35,140
We're going to war with Iraq.

1305
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,480
This was on or about
the 20th of September.

1306
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:38,681
I said,

1307
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:40,030
we're going to war with Iraq.

1308
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:40,864
Why?

1309
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,113
He said,

1310
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,013
I don't know.

1311
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,031
He said,

1312
00:36:46,031 --> 00:36:47,590
I guess they don't know what else to do.

1313
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,890
So,

1314
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:50,080
uh,

1315
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,411
I said,

1316
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:50,511
well,

1317
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:51,730
did they find some information,

1318
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:52,750
collect connecting,

1319
00:36:52,751 --> 00:36:53,980
sit to al Qaeda?

1320
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,853
He said,

1321
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,151
no,

1322
00:36:55,151 --> 00:36:55,381
no.

1323
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:55,691
It was just,

1324
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:57,430
there's nothing new that way.

1325
00:36:57,431 --> 00:37:00,310
They've just made the decision
to go to war with Iraq.

1326
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,061
He said,

1327
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:04,120
I guess it's like we don't know
what to do about terrorists,

1328
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:07,960
but we've got a good military
and we can take down governments.

1329
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:13,620
So I came back to see him a few weeks
later and by that time we were bombing in

1330
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:14,381
Afghanistan.

1331
00:37:14,381 --> 00:37:14,591
I said,

1332
00:37:14,591 --> 00:37:16,030
are we still going to war with Iraq?

1333
00:37:16,031 --> 00:37:16,361
And he said,

1334
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:16,511
oh,

1335
00:37:16,511 --> 00:37:17,500
it's worse than that.

1336
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,690
You said he reached over on his desk.

1337
00:37:19,691 --> 00:37:20,980
He picked up a piece of paper and he said,

1338
00:37:20,981 --> 00:37:21,814
I just,

1339
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,241
he said,

1340
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,040
I just got this down from upstairs,

1341
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:25,690
mean saturated benched office today.

1342
00:37:25,691 --> 00:37:26,310
And he said,

1343
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:31,090
this is a memo that describes how we're
going to take out seven countries in

1344
00:37:31,091 --> 00:37:34,140
five years starting
with Iraq and in Syria,

1345
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:35,590
11 on Libya,

1346
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:36,131
Somalia,

1347
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:36,641
Sudan,

1348
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:38,290
and finishing off Iran

1349
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,440
to go through the countries again.

1350
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,950
We're all starting with
Iraq and Syria and Lebanon.

1351
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,670
Then Libya than Somalia and
Sudan and then back to her ran.

1352
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,250
Okay.

1353
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,890
Ask her what 2007 wow.

1354
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,110
This is the General Wesley Clark.

1355
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:56,921
I mean,

1356
00:37:56,921 --> 00:37:57,520
this is,

1357
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,150
you know,

1358
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:58,990
he's not a Kook,

1359
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,000
Jesus Christ and Nutty,

1360
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,490
but it's weird that he would,

1361
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:04,210
uh,

1362
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:04,720
I mean,

1363
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,220
is he still alive if you know that?

1364
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:06,970
Yeah.

1365
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:07,390
Well,

1366
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:07,691
I mean,

1367
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:08,290
I think,

1368
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:08,651
yeah,

1369
00:38:08,651 --> 00:38:08,920
he's,

1370
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,753
he's alive man.

1371
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,481
But I mean,

1372
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:10,900
if you,

1373
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,430
if you know that and you don't tell,

1374
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,580
you're probably much more
likely to get killed.

1375
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,900
You know what I'm saying?

1376
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:21,380
It's true.

1377
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:21,891
Like you,

1378
00:38:21,891 --> 00:38:24,950
you might be thinking about telling
somebody that once it's out.

1379
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,401
Yeah.

1380
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:26,240
Once it's out,

1381
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:26,900
it's out.

1382
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,711
And if they get you,

1383
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:28,910
it's almost obvious.

1384
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:29,541
But if,

1385
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:29,931
you know,

1386
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:32,360
if you've worked one of these dudes
and you know some shit like that,

1387
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:33,990
she better get on a talk show son.

1388
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:34,290
Okay.

1389
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:34,640
Yeah.

1390
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,471
You know what I like,

1391
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:36,430
if someone knows that,

1392
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:37,264
you know that,

1393
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:37,901
I mean,

1394
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,480
I'm sure they wouldn't tell Wesley
Clark because he's a fucking general.

1395
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:41,470
And on top of that,

1396
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,650
he's probably been a part of
a bunch of shit in his past,

1397
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,000
but maybe he did may agree combination
to a lock box with a lot worse.

1398
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:50,710
Sure.

1399
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,690
It shows up unexplainably dead.

1400
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,260
Yeah.

1401
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,250
And look,

1402
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:58,870
nobody knows more about how the world
really runs in high ranking generals

1403
00:38:59,050 --> 00:38:59,530
period.

1404
00:38:59,530 --> 00:38:59,711
You know,

1405
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:02,590
they get pushed into situations where
they absolutely know that they're doing it

1406
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:03,940
for a very specific reason.

1407
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:04,810
That uh,

1408
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,950
Smedley Butler,

1409
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:09,460
a article that was written
in the 1930s war is a racket,

1410
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:10,721
you know,

1411
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:11,440
amazing,

1412
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,430
amazing article.

1413
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:15,580
When you think about the fact
that this guy wrote this in like,

1414
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,950
I think it was like 19 something,

1415
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,590
1930 something and you would say,

1416
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:20,920
you know,

1417
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,551
back then,

1418
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:21,821
man,

1419
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:24,460
there's no way people had
figured it out back then.

1420
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:25,040
You know,

1421
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,060
people were wearing,

1422
00:39:27,061 --> 00:39:27,400
uh,

1423
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,260
a corrupt country back then.

1424
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,970
Back then all the wars were just,

1425
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:32,290
it was real bad people over there.

1426
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,760
Not according to this dude,

1427
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:34,594
man,

1428
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,850
this is a major u s marine,

1429
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:38,890
Major General Smedley Butler,

1430
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,480
and it's a really brilliant,

1431
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:41,760
is 19.

1432
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,350
Actually in 1930 he wrote,

1433
00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:44,490
yeah,

1434
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:49,490
it was published in 1935 but he wrote it
in 1930 it's called war is a racket and

1435
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:50,051
this guy,

1436
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:50,830
uh,

1437
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,830
had a career in the military
and got out and just said,

1438
00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:54,640
listen,

1439
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,690
this is how it goes.

1440
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,523
Wars are racking.

1441
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,370
It always has been.

1442
00:39:57,371 --> 00:39:58,480
It's possibly the oldest,

1443
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,740
easily the most profitable.

1444
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:01,060
Surely the most vicious.

1445
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,060
It is the only one international in scope.

1446
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:08,470
It is the only one which the profits
are reckoned in dollars in the losses in

1447
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:08,980
lives.

1448
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,390
Arachat is best described,

1449
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:11,200
I believe,

1450
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,560
as something that is not what it seems
to be to the majority of the people.

1451
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,140
Only a small inside group
knows what it's about.

1452
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,960
It's conducted for the
benefit of the very few,

1453
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,720
at the expense of the
very many out of war.

1454
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,580
Few people can make huge fortunes
and this is a 19 motherfucking 30.

1455
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:29,830
This guy wrote that
because that incredible.

1456
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,383
It's like

1457
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,273
he sucked,

1458
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,000
really sucked.

1459
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,740
We just been better recovering it up.

1460
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,630
If we had the internet in 1930,

1461
00:40:38,631 --> 00:40:38,901
you know,

1462
00:40:38,901 --> 00:40:39,610
people would be like,

1463
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,730
what the fuck are we?

1464
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,050
Why are we in Mexico?

1465
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:42,921
You know,

1466
00:40:42,921 --> 00:40:44,030
what's going on in Haiti?

1467
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,470
What are we doing in Cuba?

1468
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,970
There's probably some truth to that.

1469
00:40:46,971 --> 00:40:48,220
I think the,

1470
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,930
so if we had to do it that we've,

1471
00:40:49,931 --> 00:40:51,020
we've talked about this Joe,

1472
00:40:51,021 --> 00:40:51,831
so if we had to,

1473
00:40:51,831 --> 00:40:52,210
uh,

1474
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,450
if we had to start it all over,

1475
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,430
let's say some cataclysm happens,

1476
00:40:55,431 --> 00:40:56,780
economic collapse happens,

1477
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,670
a situation where like minded people
who were able to before it happens.

1478
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:00,801
Say,

1479
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:01,310
all right,

1480
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:01,670
listen,

1481
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,920
we got to scope out in North Dakota.

1482
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,240
This is going to be our spot.

1483
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,230
Let's go there.

1484
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,000
Is that the only way to do it or is it
possible that the way to do it is to not

1485
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,350
have everything completely fall apart,

1486
00:41:12,351 --> 00:41:14,510
but everybody's sort of come to
some sort of an understanding?

1487
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,080
I would much rather have that absolutely.

1488
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,110
Maybe we can ease into a second
economy by starting off slowly.

1489
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,170
Like you don't have to use the entire un,

1490
00:41:24,171 --> 00:41:24,440
you know,

1491
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:24,711
don't,

1492
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:26,240
you don't have to use US currency.

1493
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,870
Maybe we can have an alternative
currency that we all agreed to.

1494
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,340
They tried that in the US,

1495
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,700
the Austrian town of [inaudible]
during the Great Depression,

1496
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,780
I think 1932.

1497
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:36,980
And it's a pretty interesting story.

1498
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,541
The,

1499
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:39,290
the currency had had two features,

1500
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:40,970
one that it was commodities backed,

1501
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,710
so it wasn't just backed by gold,

1502
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,670
which is one way to do it.

1503
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:46,310
But the problem with just
the gold back is your,

1504
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,480
that's contingent on people actually
Viking Goldstone then one and goal that if

1505
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:53,840
someone's going to wake up
eventually the fuck is this gold.

1506
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:54,890
You can't eat it.

1507
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,371
You can't,

1508
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:56,620
you can't kill anybody with it.

1509
00:41:56,621 --> 00:41:57,454
Make Hammers.

1510
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:57,701
Yeah.

1511
00:41:57,701 --> 00:41:59,150
So you make a catapult,

1512
00:41:59,170 --> 00:41:59,420
right.

1513
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,260
So you gotta I mean,

1514
00:42:00,261 --> 00:42:01,094
obviously go,

1515
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,380
it'd be,

1516
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:02,541
yeah,

1517
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:03,560
it'd be a heavy something,

1518
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,060
but a no good weapon.

1519
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:08,180
If you could catapult a
bowl of giant gold ball,

1520
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:09,321
fuck you up,

1521
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:09,470
man.

1522
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,860
It was what it cost.

1523
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,451
Ironic.

1524
00:42:11,451 --> 00:42:12,284
Way To die.

1525
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:14,931
Well,

1526
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:18,500
you know the whole story
about the Zechariah stitching
story about why gold was

1527
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:19,820
valuable to ancient humans.

1528
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:20,360
Yeah.

1529
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,710
He believes that the Ammo knocky
who created the human out of,

1530
00:42:23,711 --> 00:42:23,850
uh,

1531
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:24,410
the,

1532
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:27,230
the lower hominid and
the alien genetics would,

1533
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:32,060
they needed us to mine for gold because
they needed gold and massive amounts to

1534
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:34,280
suspend in their atmosphere
to protect their atmosphere.

1535
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,230
It sounds completely ridiculous,

1536
00:42:36,231 --> 00:42:40,980
but when you really go back to like how
long people have been using gold and

1537
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,770
they were like nomads man.

1538
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:43,401
Like why,

1539
00:42:43,401 --> 00:42:45,620
what did you give a fuck
about this little shiny,

1540
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,521
weird,

1541
00:42:46,521 --> 00:42:49,160
soft metal that you can't
even make a tool out of owl?

1542
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,100
This Huxley has a different theory that
I think is actually pretty interesting

1543
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:52,431
as well.

1544
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:56,210
He says that the reason people like gold
is cause it approximates some of the

1545
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,290
shiny visions that you see under the
psychedelic or mystic experience.

1546
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,000
So that's the reason why we like gems.

1547
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,440
That's the reasons why we like gold.

1548
00:43:03,441 --> 00:43:04,910
I mean now metal is everywhere.

1549
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:05,541
It's ubiquitous.

1550
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:09,620
But back then that was the only shiny
shit that you found in the earth was metal

1551
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:10,580
that you mind right now.

1552
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:11,500
We mass produce it.

1553
00:43:11,501 --> 00:43:12,880
So it's not that you know,

1554
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,510
mystical are beholding anymore,

1555
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,740
but he says,

1556
00:43:15,741 --> 00:43:15,921
you know,

1557
00:43:15,921 --> 00:43:16,191
he's like,

1558
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:20,270
why are we digging in the dirt to
find these shiny pebbles still?

1559
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,590
And he says it's because when you're on
these kinds of mescaline or DMT or are

1560
00:43:24,591 --> 00:43:25,610
these other experiences,

1561
00:43:25,611 --> 00:43:27,410
you see these multifaceted,

1562
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:28,550
you know,

1563
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:30,330
colors and lights and shine.

1564
00:43:30,331 --> 00:43:30,860
You know,

1565
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,480
different kind of makes sense to me.

1566
00:43:32,481 --> 00:43:37,481
But many more people have gotten into
diamonds and rubies then have had

1567
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,050
psychedelic experiences.

1568
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:39,261
Right?

1569
00:43:39,261 --> 00:43:39,861
But we're all,

1570
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:42,860
but we all know some
knowledge of that realm,

1571
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,251
you know,

1572
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:44,001
and that's his,

1573
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:44,660
that's his idea.

1574
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,350
His concept is that your mind is
just a filter and it symbolizes this,

1575
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,640
the things that you see so that you can
walk around and you do the normal daily

1576
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:53,210
stuff.

1577
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,500
But when you remove that filter,

1578
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:57,140
like through psychedelics or
through other different methods,

1579
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:01,190
some of that starts to peer through and
you see the colors in the way that they

1580
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:05,060
are in the void and the different
aspects outside of our physical confines.

1581
00:44:05,061 --> 00:44:07,250
And that's what's so mystical about them.

1582
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:08,450
And that's why we seek that.

1583
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,490
Even if we haven't seen
it in psychedelics,

1584
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,361
we know it.

1585
00:44:11,361 --> 00:44:12,470
And that's part of like,

1586
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,070
you know,

1587
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:16,820
part of our soul and knowledge or at least
part of the collective mind at large.

1588
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,031
Well,

1589
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:18,410
everyone's had a dream.

1590
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,660
Any dream state is just,

1591
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,180
might as well be a psychedelic experience.

1592
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:23,661
I mean,

1593
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,860
how many times have dream
states just been like,

1594
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:26,320
you know,

1595
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,470
you're involved in something that
is just completely ridiculous.

1596
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:31,980
It makes no sense and you're
just kinda going with it,

1597
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:32,670
you know?

1598
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:32,851
I mean,

1599
00:44:32,851 --> 00:44:33,231
that's all.

1600
00:44:33,231 --> 00:44:34,530
I got a lot of like really nutty,

1601
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:35,221
crazy dreams,

1602
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:35,610
right?

1603
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:35,701
Well,

1604
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:36,210
that is a,

1605
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:40,860
like a second dog experience and most
likely even caused by psychedelic

1606
00:44:40,861 --> 00:44:41,790
compounds in the brain.

1607
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:42,450
This,

1608
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,580
they've don't totally
understand how that works,

1609
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:45,120
man.

1610
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,950
They don't totally understand like why
dimethyltryptamine is in your brain and

1611
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:53,670
five methoxy dimethyltryptamine
and when is it actually released?

1612
00:44:53,671 --> 00:44:53,761
The,

1613
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:57,830
there's like theories that it's released
in periods of high stress and there's

1614
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,250
something like the anecdotal evidence,

1615
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,930
but they really have to develop these,

1616
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:01,260
uh,

1617
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:02,220
much more,

1618
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:02,460
uh,

1619
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,780
sensitive ways of determining like
when the actual DMT is released during

1620
00:45:06,781 --> 00:45:08,460
various stages of human activity.

1621
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,653
Because right now,

1622
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,561
from what I understand,

1623
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:13,290
one of the only ways to find
out is when someone dies,

1624
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:15,210
like does DMT flood the
brain when they die?

1625
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:19,350
Well you have to like get in there like
within seconds after they're dead and

1626
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:20,220
measure that shit.

1627
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:20,641
You know,

1628
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:21,040
within,

1629
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:21,400
you know,

1630
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,620
I mean when you,

1631
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,330
your body processes,

1632
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,360
it's 10 15 minutes and
you're back to baseline.

1633
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:27,770
I mean it's,

1634
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:27,990
so,

1635
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,490
it's a really quick experience.

1636
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,990
So like when someone dies,

1637
00:45:30,991 --> 00:45:32,220
if they get that blast,

1638
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,690
if that's what happens and you know,

1639
00:45:33,691 --> 00:45:37,170
you have a psychedelic trip
that like whether it eases your,

1640
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:37,501
you know,

1641
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:41,220
your departure from the earth or whether
it opens up some fucking gateway to

1642
00:45:41,221 --> 00:45:42,630
something in nature that's next,

1643
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,531
whatever the hell it is,

1644
00:45:43,531 --> 00:45:45,090
it's gone pretty good damn quickly.

1645
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,170
It's Poof,

1646
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:46,441
you know,

1647
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:47,490
it's there and it's not,

1648
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,300
so they would have to like open your
fucking head up real quick and get to that

1649
00:45:51,301 --> 00:45:53,370
gland and then start testing.

1650
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:53,660
Right.

1651
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,940
I think maybe there's,

1652
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,100
there's something to it obviously,

1653
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:56,751
but what is it?

1654
00:45:56,751 --> 00:45:57,584
I mean,

1655
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,793
yeah,

1656
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:01,970
I spent a long time telling
that story about the,

1657
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:02,330
you know,

1658
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:02,660
the,

1659
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,790
the jungle when I was down
there and taking Iowasca.

1660
00:46:04,791 --> 00:46:07,610
And since then I had a very deep,

1661
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,650
um,

1662
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:08,900
you know,

1663
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,110
silicide been experience
and in contrast and,

1664
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:12,920
uh,

1665
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,760
there's something particular about the
DMT molecule that I'm convinced that's

1666
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,800
transcend area to what,

1667
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:19,160
you know,

1668
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,530
in the framework of the jungle
where I was when I was there,

1669
00:46:21,531 --> 00:46:22,364
that's,

1670
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:22,910
you know,

1671
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:26,690
causes you to go to different
dimensions than even a suicide and trip.

1672
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,440
I felt,

1673
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,180
I felt like there was the DMT molecule
is some form of gateway that opens doors

1674
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,740
that you can't even get,

1675
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,101
you know,

1676
00:46:34,101 --> 00:46:36,320
with other energy medicine,

1677
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:37,460
psychoactive compounds.

1678
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,250
There's something particularly
special about that.

1679
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,020
And uh,

1680
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:41,541
I couldn't,

1681
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:43,250
couldn't help but feel
that overwhelming feeling.

1682
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,750
I actually was able to,

1683
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:48,950
I saw a lot of the same kind of figures
and a lot of things like trying to pull

1684
00:46:48,951 --> 00:46:49,760
me up and like,

1685
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,900
that was the large part of my vision
was these reaching down in and trying to

1686
00:46:53,901 --> 00:46:55,550
pull me up into these higher levels.

1687
00:46:55,551 --> 00:46:55,971
But there's,

1688
00:46:55,971 --> 00:46:56,990
the fuel wasn't there.

1689
00:46:56,991 --> 00:46:57,824
Like I couldn't,

1690
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,480
I couldn't open that door,

1691
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,580
the same door that I went
through back in the jungle.

1692
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,460
And maybe that has something to do with
the sham and maybe it has to do with the

1693
00:47:04,461 --> 00:47:04,911
other things,

1694
00:47:04,911 --> 00:47:07,500
but I think it has to do with
totally different compound,

1695
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,540
totally different compounds.

1696
00:47:08,541 --> 00:47:10,430
So each one has their own specialist.

1697
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:13,190
I think that is a part of
the compound of psilocybin.

1698
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,090
I think nn dimethyltryptamine
is actually like a part of it.

1699
00:47:17,091 --> 00:47:21,620
I think it's something like for Fox four
[inaudible] and end dimethyltryptamine

1700
00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:21,861
it's so,

1701
00:47:21,861 --> 00:47:25,430
it's very closely related
it and it certainly is,

1702
00:47:25,431 --> 00:47:26,264
but there was,

1703
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:28,160
I don't know for whatever
reason there was some,

1704
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:29,023
some others,

1705
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,370
maybe not.

1706
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:31,270
How much did you have?

1707
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,680
It was probably two and a half
grams maybe since he left side.

1708
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,400
But it was really,

1709
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:38,290
yeah,

1710
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:38,921
you got silly.

1711
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:39,521
That's not enough.

1712
00:47:39,521 --> 00:47:40,360
You need five.

1713
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,800
Five is the magic number.

1714
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,460
Yeah.

1715
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,450
But if I've taken,

1716
00:47:43,451 --> 00:47:44,400
I've taken a good amount of,

1717
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,790
Brian did like seven recently and by
mistake the world disappeared on him for a

1718
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:49,624
little while.

1719
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,580
Yeah.

1720
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,360
There's different
situations cause different,

1721
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:52,811
different,

1722
00:47:52,811 --> 00:47:53,020
uh,

1723
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:53,741
different results.

1724
00:47:53,741 --> 00:47:54,910
But it's a pretty remarkable,

1725
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:57,970
I haven't done DMT in
several years and uh,

1726
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,870
it's been a couple because the last
time I did it was the only time ever,

1727
00:48:01,871 --> 00:48:02,231
ever,

1728
00:48:02,231 --> 00:48:02,411
I mean,

1729
00:48:02,411 --> 00:48:04,360
I've had a lot of bunch of
psychedelic experiences,

1730
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:09,340
but the last time I did DMT was the only
time where I ever was not sure what was

1731
00:48:09,341 --> 00:48:11,170
real and what was,

1732
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,340
what was imagination and
fantasy for about two weeks.

1733
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,660
For about two weeks.

1734
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,220
The world itself,

1735
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,210
like as I was driving
seemed malleable and like,

1736
00:48:22,211 --> 00:48:25,180
it seemed like if I
concentrated on car accidents,

1737
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:25,811
you know,

1738
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:27,880
I might wind up in a fucking car accident,

1739
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:28,331
you know,

1740
00:48:28,331 --> 00:48:29,800
if I concentrate on it raining out,

1741
00:48:29,801 --> 00:48:30,491
it might rain out.

1742
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,324
I mean,

1743
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,750
it sounded completely ridiculous and I
didn't believe that I could make anything

1744
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:35,860
happen with my mind at a,

1745
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:37,150
by any stretch of the imagination.

1746
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:40,600
But what I also didn't believe
was that reality was 100% real.

1747
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:45,900
Because what happens when you have a real
mind blowing fucking trip is first of

1748
00:48:48,131 --> 00:48:48,311
all,

1749
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:51,390
you get terrified that
it's that close that Oh,

1750
00:48:51,391 --> 00:48:52,900
you have to do is smoke that stuff.

1751
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:53,920
And it's right there.

1752
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:55,570
I can get there in 30 seconds,

1753
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:58,630
a minute and I get to
some impossible place.

1754
00:48:58,780 --> 00:48:59,920
Like if you could,

1755
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:05,100
if you had the journey across the earth
to get to some spot in Tibet where you,

1756
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:05,531
you know,

1757
00:49:05,531 --> 00:49:07,600
you look into the DMT realm,

1758
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:11,620
you know you have to climb through a
fucking cave and repel and you camp out

1759
00:49:11,621 --> 00:49:15,100
there and it takes days and some
people die like climbing Mt.

1760
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:15,250
Everest.

1761
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,180
But if you get there,

1762
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:17,200
if you get to that spot,

1763
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,210
you look out and you see God,

1764
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,540
you look out and you see
the most purest wisdom,

1765
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:22,970
the,

1766
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:23,220
the,

1767
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:23,461
the,

1768
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,420
the most knowledgeable love,

1769
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:28,570
the most sympathetic voice,

1770
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:32,770
the most knowledge that you could ever
possibly imagine coming from something in

1771
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,900
a way that's not even language,

1772
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:36,760
like very difficult to describe,

1773
00:49:36,761 --> 00:49:39,370
but so intense and humbling man.

1774
00:49:39,371 --> 00:49:40,120
People would,

1775
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,920
they would take trips to go to that.

1776
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:42,491
They would,

1777
00:49:42,491 --> 00:49:43,180
it would be,

1778
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:43,871
you know what I'm saying?

1779
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:45,640
Like if there was like a
guy that you could go to,

1780
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:46,780
they would give you this feeling.

1781
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,610
But essentially there is,

1782
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:48,941
and it's,

1783
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:49,860
it's if,

1784
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:50,940
if everyone knew,

1785
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:53,980
if it was legal and you could go to
places where they could prescribe it,

1786
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:54,671
boy,

1787
00:49:54,671 --> 00:49:55,930
would that change the world?

1788
00:49:55,931 --> 00:49:56,171
I mean,

1789
00:49:56,171 --> 00:49:57,400
would that change the world?

1790
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:58,780
That changed the fucking,

1791
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,740
if you seen,

1792
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,180
if people have seen what you've seen,

1793
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:04,420
could you imagine there
are totally different,

1794
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:05,560
but if you brought that up,

1795
00:50:05,561 --> 00:50:06,550
people say like,

1796
00:50:06,551 --> 00:50:07,990
you're a fucking crazy person.

1797
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:08,621
Like what are you doing?

1798
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:10,360
You got to give people drugs,

1799
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:12,460
the hallucinations and they're going to,

1800
00:50:12,461 --> 00:50:12,611
oh,

1801
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:15,610
that's gonna make them a better
person while the driving another,

1802
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:16,300
you know,

1803
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:20,050
theory from Huxley is that the driving
force behind all religion was seeking

1804
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:20,650
that,

1805
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,330
that kind of transcendental place.

1806
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:24,880
And people got to it through
a variety of different means.

1807
00:50:24,881 --> 00:50:25,510
He said,

1808
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:25,691
you know,

1809
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:28,160
all the chanting that you find
in these mystical traditions

1810
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:32,450
that raises the CO2 level because you end
up breathing out more than you breathe

1811
00:50:32,451 --> 00:50:33,400
in when you're doing it.

1812
00:50:33,401 --> 00:50:34,970
Unless you're a highly trained singer,

1813
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:35,211
you know,

1814
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:35,721
and your expert.

1815
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:39,440
But most of these ecstatic chanting
and yelling and all that is designed to

1816
00:50:39,441 --> 00:50:42,140
raise that co two level breathe
out more than you breathe in.

1817
00:50:42,141 --> 00:50:43,190
How's that even possible?

1818
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:44,121
Just,

1819
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:44,421
well,

1820
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:46,580
just in a normal bread.

1821
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,550
All sides as well.

1822
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:54,560
Just cause no more [inaudible] it's
like a rapper made that one of the

1823
00:50:59,321 --> 00:51:02,870
[inaudible] dick hole fills
up my lungs from the bottom.

1824
00:51:02,871 --> 00:51:03,704
Yo.

1825
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:04,963
Well anyway,

1826
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:05,790
that's how he put it.

1827
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:06,680
I there's some,

1828
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:08,930
there's some ways really
shit like that man.

1829
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:09,770
It drives me nuts,

1830
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:10,640
you know,

1831
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,680
and then you repeated accidentally not,

1832
00:51:12,681 --> 00:51:15,120
not thinking about it and then you
know someone else has to come along.

1833
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:15,861
Go wait a minute man,

1834
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:16,820
what the fuck did you just say?

1835
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:17,661
And then he'd go,

1836
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:17,901
yeah,

1837
00:51:17,901 --> 00:51:19,070
what the fuck did I just say?

1838
00:51:19,071 --> 00:51:19,551
God Damn,

1839
00:51:19,551 --> 00:51:21,170
I'm just repeating some stupid shit.

1840
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:24,710
Somebody told me in martial
arts I was always a problem.

1841
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:25,840
There's always going,

1842
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,620
could be the wrong way to go about it.

1843
00:51:27,621 --> 00:51:30,660
But either either case he's saying that
was one mile example of raising the co

1844
00:51:30,661 --> 00:51:31,131
two levels.

1845
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:32,360
There are certain breathing exercises.

1846
00:51:32,361 --> 00:51:33,081
It's certainly do that.

1847
00:51:33,081 --> 00:51:34,740
So that does something to the air.

1848
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,470
It's more carbon dioxide that ends up
reducing that what he calls the cerebral

1849
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,281
reducing valve.

1850
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:43,100
That is what keeps everything
symbolized because that vision,

1851
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:43,851
what you're talking about,

1852
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:44,780
you're saying it's right there.

1853
00:51:44,781 --> 00:51:46,790
It's right there because
it's around us all the time.

1854
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:49,090
And that's why when you take
something or smoked Dmt,

1855
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:50,270
you get to it instantly.

1856
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:52,590
You don't have to travel to it
cause it's there all the time.

1857
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,453
The only thing.

1858
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:58,560
But isn't it possible that it's also
perturbing your mind and giving your mind

1859
00:51:59,200 --> 00:51:59,440
a,

1860
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,580
an excess of chemicals to deal with.

1861
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:05,180
So it distorts your visual
perception of the world.

1862
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:09,500
I mean it seems to me that there you
have to look at every single possibility

1863
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,890
and you have to look at the possibility
that if the brain produces all these

1864
00:52:12,891 --> 00:52:17,150
different chemicals at varying doses
and we believe that it varies the doses

1865
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:18,560
based on stress levels.

1866
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:18,951
Wow.

1867
00:52:18,951 --> 00:52:20,210
There might be something to that.

1868
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,180
There might be something to this
possibility that there is a gateway,

1869
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,870
but there's also a possibility that you
just getting fucked up on some wacky

1870
00:52:26,871 --> 00:52:28,760
drug and seeing some nutty shit.

1871
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:31,070
And it's so humbling
because you don't expect it,

1872
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:32,210
that when you come back,

1873
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:34,580
you have like all these
rationalizations and all this,

1874
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:35,101
you know,

1875
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:36,560
this either way,

1876
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,840
if you believe that it can
make you a great person,

1877
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:40,511
it's like,

1878
00:52:40,511 --> 00:52:40,910
you know,

1879
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:41,490
it's like,

1880
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:42,590
like a lot of religions,

1881
00:52:42,591 --> 00:52:42,960
man.

1882
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,810
I don't think there's
anything wrong Christianity.

1883
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:45,051
I mean,

1884
00:52:45,051 --> 00:52:45,801
if it works for you,

1885
00:52:45,801 --> 00:52:46,610
it works for you.

1886
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:48,950
I know people that it works for them
and it actually does make them a better

1887
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:49,760
person,

1888
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,240
you know?

1889
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:50,541
Um,

1890
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:51,440
and if you believe in it,

1891
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:52,100
it can work.

1892
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,090
It can make you a better person,

1893
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:53,960
you know?

1894
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:58,550
And if you believe that your psychedelic
experience was truly connecting with

1895
00:52:58,551 --> 00:52:59,510
the divine well,

1896
00:52:59,511 --> 00:53:00,770
that can make you a better person.

1897
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:05,360
But it could also be your system is just
over flooded by some shit that's not

1898
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:08,000
supposed to be there
and rocket fuel doses.

1899
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:09,590
And it was just a wash.

1900
00:53:09,591 --> 00:53:11,720
And like usually when it gets a sip of,

1901
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,730
it's at the bottom of a river of,

1902
00:53:13,731 --> 00:53:14,300
of,

1903
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:14,751
you know,

1904
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:17,000
this crazy fucking fluid.

1905
00:53:17,001 --> 00:53:17,271
That's,

1906
00:53:17,271 --> 00:53:18,620
I think that's us actually,

1907
00:53:18,621 --> 00:53:20,390
I think a more accepted
theory than houses,

1908
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:24,080
which is that you're actually taking
away your filter instead of adding

1909
00:53:24,081 --> 00:53:24,711
something else.

1910
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:26,190
And he on to talk about,

1911
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:26,521
you know,

1912
00:53:26,521 --> 00:53:30,200
probably more convincing arguments than
the chanting argument basically that um,

1913
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,610
there was a famous st
that the curate to ours,

1914
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:33,121
uh,

1915
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:33,450
this,

1916
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:37,170
this French saint and he used to say
that when he would flagellate himself,

1917
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,690
God could deny him nothing and he
would have access to that Ms. Dot.

1918
00:53:40,691 --> 00:53:41,700
Was about popular thing.

1919
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:41,841
Right?

1920
00:53:41,841 --> 00:53:42,240
Yeah.

1921
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,610
People don't know that means you're
beat the fuck out of yourself.

1922
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:45,271
So you would do it,

1923
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:45,800
you know,

1924
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,720
so these long periods and
pull a fart out or something.

1925
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,111
Oh,

1926
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:49,831
flatulence.

1927
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:54,830
You know flagellate it's like they use
like a little whip did either nodded

1928
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,360
leather or actual barbs on it and it
would cause they're back to bleed when he

1929
00:53:58,361 --> 00:54:02,100
was tearing themselves apart and the
era before soap that would cause,

1930
00:54:02,101 --> 00:54:02,281
you know,

1931
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:05,340
first of all the actual beating would
cause a lot of adrenaline to rush through

1932
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:07,920
your body and Histamines to
rush through your body as,

1933
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,910
as this was going on,

1934
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,790
that in combination with the
fasting that was very popular,

1935
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:14,430
obviously lent winter was
kind of a forced fast.

1936
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,620
And with the flagellation that caused,

1937
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:16,831
you know,

1938
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,840
an error before soap,

1939
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:19,560
there's would almost always fester.

1940
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:22,290
So there would be all these
decomposing protein in your system.

1941
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,020
It would basically reduce your,

1942
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:25,560
you know,

1943
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:29,370
your cerebral capacity to the point
where you could enter psychedelic trance

1944
00:54:29,371 --> 00:54:31,080
states and actually commune,

1945
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:31,560
you know,

1946
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,800
with God underneath your,

1947
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,560
oh Whoa,

1948
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:33,921
whoa,

1949
00:54:33,921 --> 00:54:34,231
whoa,

1950
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:35,970
break that shit down again.

1951
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,940
So you're saying because they were dirty,

1952
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:43,140
stinky people that didn't wash that
good so they didn't like scrub off the

1953
00:54:43,141 --> 00:54:47,250
outside layer of skin that somehow the
penetrating that would change their

1954
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:48,084
state.

1955
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:48,900
Well,

1956
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:51,390
this is in combination
with a variety of things.

1957
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,840
So basically at the brain needs
vitamins and nutrients to function.

1958
00:54:54,841 --> 00:54:55,231
Normally,

1959
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,411
you know,

1960
00:54:55,411 --> 00:54:57,210
you go through these
long periods of fasting.

1961
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,520
That was one way to reach
the mystical experience.

1962
00:54:59,521 --> 00:55:00,720
40 days of fasting,

1963
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,510
you're basically denying your
brain of all the glucose,

1964
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,030
all the vitamins necessary
to function optimally.

1965
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:08,190
And that's when a lot of
these people had visions.

1966
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:11,700
While the reason they had
visions according to Huxley
was because the brain was

1967
00:55:11,701 --> 00:55:12,600
just not funk,

1968
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:17,430
be able to function as its
normal symbolizing cerebral
nature that it does to

1969
00:55:17,431 --> 00:55:18,330
make us all survive.

1970
00:55:18,331 --> 00:55:22,110
So you were able to take in more
of the capital m mind at large,

1971
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,170
which we call the collective now
because of the lack of vitamins.

1972
00:55:25,171 --> 00:55:29,070
And he was saying also the flagellation
usually used in conjunction with that,

1973
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:29,641
you know,

1974
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:33,630
so you got your brain basically
running on very little little,

1975
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:33,900
you know,

1976
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,720
just trying to hang in there
and then you beat yourself.

1977
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,100
And then at that point,

1978
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:38,461
you know,

1979
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:38,910
you got,

1980
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:39,810
you got adrenaline,

1981
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:41,010
you got histamines,

1982
00:55:41,011 --> 00:55:44,910
and then you got festering wounds
on your back that are causing more,

1983
00:55:44,911 --> 00:55:45,150
you know,

1984
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:46,830
more kind of toxins to your brain.

1985
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:50,520
So at that point your brain just kind
of shuts off and it allows more of that

1986
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:52,020
mystical experience to come through.

1987
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:52,861
Wow.

1988
00:55:52,861 --> 00:55:56,880
So you beat the fuck out of yourself to
achieve enlightenment after you starve

1989
00:55:56,881 --> 00:55:59,160
yourself for a month or so.

1990
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:00,420
Can you mention farts before?

1991
00:56:00,421 --> 00:56:00,810
So,

1992
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:01,211
and that's,

1993
00:56:01,211 --> 00:56:01,981
but that's how,

1994
00:56:01,981 --> 00:56:05,580
that's how important seeking
that mystical experience was.

1995
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:06,061
These people,

1996
00:56:06,061 --> 00:56:06,990
they were willing to do that.

1997
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:08,550
And how would they find
out about it though?

1998
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:11,130
Unless someone wants to meet someone
and then there's someone said,

1999
00:56:11,131 --> 00:56:12,180
thank you for starving,

2000
00:56:12,181 --> 00:56:15,660
maybe beat the fuck out of me because
I learned a lot about myself maybe,

2001
00:56:15,661 --> 00:56:15,990
maybe,

2002
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:18,090
well the winter was
basically a forced fast.

2003
00:56:18,091 --> 00:56:21,300
They had hardly any vitamin or in the
winter that they were able to be able to

2004
00:56:21,301 --> 00:56:22,620
store a certain amount of things.

2005
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:26,500
And then coming off winter was also a
time that that caused a lot of these

2006
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:27,334
visions to come.

2007
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,091
And at that point,

2008
00:56:28,091 --> 00:56:28,271
yeah,

2009
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:29,960
somebody may be got taken to the whip.

2010
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:31,240
Whipping was a common,

2011
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,360
was a common way to treat
any kind of petty offense.

2012
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:37,960
Someone gets whipped after 40 after
three months of fasting for winter,

2013
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,040
40 days of lent,

2014
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:39,881
and they get whipped.

2015
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:43,210
They very well may see
God and that was his idea.

2016
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:46,420
But he said now at the state
that we know about psychedelics,

2017
00:56:46,421 --> 00:56:49,630
trying to get to the mystical
state through that reason is like,

2018
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:50,020
you know,

2019
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:51,700
burning the house down to cook a pig.

2020
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:52,061
You know,

2021
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:53,780
it's like you don't
need to do that anymore.

2022
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,910
You can go out and you can find
these tools that were placed here on

2023
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,830
the earth that's get you that
experience really amazing.

2024
00:56:59,831 --> 00:57:01,270
And I never heard that before.

2025
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:05,230
I'd never heard that before about
the flagellation and starving.

2026
00:57:05,231 --> 00:57:06,430
It totally makes sense.

2027
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:07,293
Yeah,

2028
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,460
it's a crazy a possibility.

2029
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:11,620
I've always wondered why the fuck
they beat the shit on themselves.

2030
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:14,320
I just figured it's like Jerry Sandusky,

2031
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,340
like they hate themselves.

2032
00:57:15,341 --> 00:57:15,590
You know,

2033
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:16,210
to hear.

2034
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:17,650
One of the things that Jason Dusky said,

2035
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:19,420
and one of the interviews he
said he wished he was dead.

2036
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:19,991
You know,

2037
00:57:19,991 --> 00:57:21,130
he's talking to this woman.

2038
00:57:21,131 --> 00:57:22,270
The woman was asking him like,

2039
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:24,530
why he touched her son or any sign.

2040
00:57:24,531 --> 00:57:26,590
I didn't mean it to be that way.

2041
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:27,430
I wish I was dead.

2042
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,180
Wow.

2043
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:28,930
Wow.

2044
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:29,431
You know,

2045
00:57:29,431 --> 00:57:31,870
like that's like these big horn cells,

2046
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,880
whips with fucking Barb's.

2047
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,560
That's a person that hates himself,

2048
00:57:35,561 --> 00:57:35,801
right?

2049
00:57:35,801 --> 00:57:36,230
Yeah.

2050
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:36,471
Well,

2051
00:57:36,471 --> 00:57:36,920
the guilt,

2052
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,290
the guilt that was fostered
by the beliefs and the time,

2053
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,150
I mean would cause people
to hate themselves.

2054
00:57:41,151 --> 00:57:44,450
They'd have this constant sense of nine
guilt that they couldn't get rid of.

2055
00:57:44,451 --> 00:57:45,920
So how do you get rid of guilt?

2056
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:46,130
Well,

2057
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,440
somebody has to punish you if
nobody else is going to do it.

2058
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,530
Punish yourself.

2059
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:54,530
Isn't it amazing how the human mind can
be programmed like that with religion or

2060
00:57:55,321 --> 00:57:56,460
with nationalism,

2061
00:57:56,461 --> 00:57:56,671
you know,

2062
00:57:56,671 --> 00:57:59,640
with North Korea or whether
it's to fucking inquisition.

2063
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:00,721
It's amazing,

2064
00:58:00,721 --> 00:58:01,320
really.

2065
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,280
It's amazing the human beings
can all fall into a pattern.

2066
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:09,810
The pattern just has to be really clear
and enforced and scare the fuck out of a

2067
00:58:09,811 --> 00:58:10,291
few people.

2068
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:13,350
While it's being enforced and then boom,

2069
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:13,741
it's a,

2070
00:58:13,741 --> 00:58:14,670
it spreads,

2071
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:15,690
you know,

2072
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,190
it's really amazing.

2073
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:17,820
It's just,

2074
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,050
we're so weird,

2075
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:19,681
you know,

2076
00:58:19,681 --> 00:58:22,590
we're capable of such
brilliance and such beauty,

2077
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:25,170
but we're also so fucking dumb.

2078
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,960
We're so easy to trick.

2079
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,890
Or some of them were
so easy to program and,

2080
00:58:31,891 --> 00:58:32,131
and,

2081
00:58:32,131 --> 00:58:35,130
and make act completely
ridiculous and absurd.

2082
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,300
What's so easy?

2083
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:37,500
Well I think there's,

2084
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:39,060
there's a couple of things
that are going on there.

2085
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:43,740
I think there's a certain amount of people
who are very easily programmable and

2086
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:44,180
I've,

2087
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:45,600
I've read some figures,

2088
00:58:45,601 --> 00:58:48,120
some estimations that there's
20% of the population,

2089
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:48,630
uh,

2090
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:48,960
like,

2091
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,270
like a hypnotist who brings a
bunch of people up on stage.

2092
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,250
Those certain people are very,

2093
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:53,521
you know,

2094
00:58:53,521 --> 00:58:57,210
very susceptible to suggestion was to
bring this up because people think I'm a

2095
00:58:57,211 --> 00:58:57,780
dummy.

2096
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,610
I've got a bunch of tweets from people,

2097
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,271
the real leg,

2098
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:00,781
fuck you.

2099
00:59:00,781 --> 00:59:02,850
Stupid comedy hypnotist aren't real.

2100
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:04,770
I know you don't think they're real.

2101
00:59:04,771 --> 00:59:05,491
Cause guess what?

2102
00:59:05,491 --> 00:59:06,990
I didn't think they're real either.

2103
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,120
When I first saw a comedy show,

2104
00:59:09,121 --> 00:59:10,920
it's stitches comedy Club in Boston.

2105
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,980
I saw Frank Santos to are rated hypnotist.

2106
00:59:13,981 --> 00:59:14,460
And I said,

2107
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:15,690
this is bullshit.

2108
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,490
This is so fucking stupid.

2109
00:59:17,491 --> 00:59:18,324
This is bullshit.

2110
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:19,650
But it's not bullshit.

2111
00:59:19,651 --> 00:59:20,910
It just wouldn't work on you.

2112
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:21,261
Yu,

2113
00:59:21,261 --> 00:59:22,290
the skeptical person

2114
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:22,551
that's like,

2115
00:59:22,551 --> 00:59:23,384
this is bullshit.

2116
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,840
Generally you probably fairly intelligent
and it's not going to work on you.

2117
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:27,110
Right?

2118
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,080
But if you're one of those
dudes with a nine volt brain,

2119
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:32,030
there's a lot of people
out there like that.

2120
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,950
You can hypnotize them.

2121
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:35,750
It doesn't seem like it should work.

2122
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:40,250
It seems completely preposterous to
you or to me or to you because you,

2123
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,680
we couldn't be hypnotized like that.

2124
00:59:41,681 --> 00:59:41,990
Right.

2125
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:42,860
But to that dude,

2126
00:59:42,861 --> 00:59:45,260
it's absolutely possible
and that's amazing.

2127
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:45,800
It's like,

2128
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,550
it's almost like there's people set up
around us and we have the cheat codes for

2129
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:50,060
them,

2130
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:50,421
you know,

2131
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:51,170
and you throw it,

2132
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:51,501
throw it,

2133
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:52,580
throw them into God mode,

2134
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:53,061
you know,

2135
00:59:53,061 --> 00:59:54,010
like literally,

2136
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,850
literally like people can be hacked.

2137
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:57,590
That's amazing.

2138
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:00,500
And people and people know that
had been taking advantage of that.

2139
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:01,580
So there's that factor.

2140
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:05,420
There's this 20% let's say people that
can be basically hypnotizer basically

2141
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,730
walking somnambulists,

2142
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:07,060
you know,

2143
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:08,750
like able to be hypnotized easily.

2144
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,340
Is that a biological thing?

2145
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,391
I think so.

2146
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:13,700
I think it's just the way that
their mind works in a certain way.

2147
01:00:13,701 --> 01:00:16,040
And I don't think it's necessarily
a lack of intelligence.

2148
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:19,920
It's just a certain circuitry that
their mind works on where they're at,

2149
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:20,670
that it goes,

2150
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:21,171
I don't know.

2151
01:00:21,171 --> 01:00:22,970
Definitely the lack of
objective reasoning.

2152
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:23,540
Sure,

2153
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,373
sure.

2154
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:28,790
Part of the mind is probably getting
steered around for a certain cause that

2155
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,830
hardly rational individual,

2156
01:00:30,831 --> 01:00:31,311
but they're,

2157
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:32,144
you know,

2158
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,670
their emotional intelligence
might be off the charts,

2159
01:00:34,671 --> 01:00:34,851
you know,

2160
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:39,851
like they might be able to
be very insightful as far
as their intuition and what

2161
01:00:40,731 --> 01:00:41,361
they're able to see.

2162
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:41,930
But,

2163
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:45,740
but certainly there's some critical aspect
that they're able to just circumvent

2164
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:47,180
and shut off completely.

2165
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:47,660
And,

2166
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:48,231
and that's,

2167
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:49,490
that's I think obvious.

2168
01:00:49,491 --> 01:00:51,260
But once you get that majority,

2169
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:55,550
let's say that 20% human
beings are naturally creatures,

2170
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:56,450
social creatures.

2171
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:58,310
So if you start to see a majority,

2172
01:00:58,311 --> 01:00:58,610
like it's,

2173
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:00,500
if you start to see a
bunch of people running,

2174
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:00,921
you know,

2175
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:03,560
you're going to start jogging
the same direction and be like,

2176
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:04,011
Oh shit,

2177
01:01:04,011 --> 01:01:05,090
I don't know what I'm jogging,

2178
01:01:05,091 --> 01:01:07,580
but these people are fucking
going and I'm outta here.

2179
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,860
So I think that's part of what happens.

2180
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:11,330
They get a certain minority,

2181
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:11,870
you know,

2182
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:12,591
convinced,

2183
01:01:12,591 --> 01:01:13,251
hypnotize,

2184
01:01:13,251 --> 01:01:15,770
basically just some nonsense
and then everybody else is like,

2185
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,490
Oh shit,

2186
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:17,330
look at all these people.

2187
01:01:17,331 --> 01:01:18,260
They can't all be wrong.

2188
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:19,940
And then they hop on board as well.

2189
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:20,961
It's amazing.

2190
01:01:20,961 --> 01:01:23,720
We have to fix the
design of the human body.

2191
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:24,471
You know,

2192
01:01:24,471 --> 01:01:27,770
I was just saying this on stage for
years that we've got to stop making,

2193
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:30,620
having sex have to do with making babies.

2194
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,940
That's ridiculous.

2195
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,330
It should be way harder to make
babies and it should be based,

2196
01:01:35,331 --> 01:01:35,721
you know,

2197
01:01:35,721 --> 01:01:36,270
on you,

2198
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:38,420
you should have to like do something,

2199
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,080
you know,

2200
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:39,710
together.

2201
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:40,910
Maybe go do something,

2202
01:01:40,911 --> 01:01:43,790
go somewhere to get to go
through a ceremony together
and then you make a baby.

2203
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,460
Horse shoes have to be easier.

2204
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:46,910
Like it has to be an APP on your phone.

2205
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:48,201
That problem.

2206
01:01:48,201 --> 01:01:50,660
The problem with abortion
is the abortion idea.

2207
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:52,820
It's like got to catch it quick,

2208
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,350
he catch it quick and it doesn't count.

2209
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:56,450
It's like well are you sure?

2210
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:57,261
Cause it is.

2211
01:01:57,261 --> 01:01:58,020
It is it,

2212
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:00,770
it doesn't count or is it
like stepping on an ant?

2213
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:01,131
Like,

2214
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:02,570
if I step on an ant in my house,

2215
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:04,370
nine times out of 10 I
don't even clean it up.

2216
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:05,690
If I step on a mouse,

2217
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:06,830
I got to clean it up,

2218
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:07,880
you know?

2219
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,070
And basically if a mouse
is a size of an ant,

2220
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:11,090
I wouldn't give a fuck.

2221
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:11,691
All right.

2222
01:02:11,691 --> 01:02:11,931
There's,

2223
01:02:11,931 --> 01:02:15,350
there's something about when things get
bigger that they start becoming real.

2224
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:16,580
That's crazy.

2225
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,180
You know?

2226
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,200
I mean there's a,

2227
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:20,490
there's a lot of holes in that argument.

2228
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,210
There's a lot of,

2229
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:25,500
it's a weird sort of an acceptance
of what's essentially killing a life.

2230
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:26,011
You know,

2231
01:02:26,011 --> 01:02:26,940
if you let it go,

2232
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:28,380
it is going to be another person.

2233
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:28,781
So what,

2234
01:02:28,781 --> 01:02:29,910
what you decide,

2235
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,550
and I'm not saying you shouldn't have the
right to choose because you absolutely

2236
01:02:32,551 --> 01:02:32,851
shouldn't.

2237
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:35,040
And I don't want to be the one that
tells you what to do with your body.

2238
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:35,971
Don't get me wrong,

2239
01:02:35,971 --> 01:02:38,750
but as a philosophical argument of,

2240
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,410
of what it is and when,

2241
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:41,620
when does it start and when,

2242
01:02:41,621 --> 01:02:42,480
when is it life,

2243
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:42,811
you know,

2244
01:02:42,811 --> 01:02:43,260
it's like,

2245
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,470
how about we just figured out a way to
completely prevent it unless you want it.

2246
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,240
That seems like much smarter.

2247
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:51,780
Like we should be doing that to
kids at a like a really early age.

2248
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:53,190
I'm not saying we should neuter him,

2249
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:55,350
but we should fucking get
them on birth control.

2250
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:56,430
Lickety split,

2251
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:57,890
you know gummy bear.

2252
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:58,810
Well Jesus.

2253
01:02:58,830 --> 01:02:59,500
Yeah,

2254
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,270
like give them a chance to get
out of high school and keep them,

2255
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:03,780
you know,

2256
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,870
when you're in high school and your
bone and your raw dogging it and you're

2257
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:08,250
barely pulling out on time,

2258
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,230
then it's like the best
time to make a person.

2259
01:03:10,231 --> 01:03:11,760
Like your body's ready to go.

2260
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:15,010
Your buddies young and fresh
and you'd got bitches there.

2261
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:16,830
Eggs are fallen into their socks.

2262
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:17,251
You know,

2263
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,300
there's so many eggs,

2264
01:03:18,301 --> 01:03:18,570
man,

2265
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:19,740
they're ready to drop.

2266
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:24,060
It's so easy to have a baby
then and that's just the
most ridiculous thing ever.

2267
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:24,481
You know,

2268
01:03:24,481 --> 01:03:25,291
the worst set up,

2269
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:28,590
the same way that we were set up back
when it was really hard to stay alive.

2270
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:33,000
We know are our biological setup is set
up for back when we didn't have houses,

2271
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:33,361
you know,

2272
01:03:33,361 --> 01:03:35,190
we were out there with
sleeping under the stars.

2273
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:36,930
One guy had to stay awake with a stick.

2274
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:37,830
You know,

2275
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:40,530
and then we're wondering around chasing
after these animals cause we have to

2276
01:03:40,531 --> 01:03:41,370
follow the herd.

2277
01:03:41,371 --> 01:03:42,690
Otherwise we'll starve to death.

2278
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:43,710
You know,

2279
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:45,060
God damn man.

2280
01:03:45,061 --> 01:03:46,380
What a shit design.

2281
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:46,681
Yeah,

2282
01:03:46,681 --> 01:03:49,530
the whole world is changed
and we're the same.

2283
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,120
That's what's really fucked up.

2284
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:55,260
We in our little fucking interesting
minds have figured out a way to manipulate

2285
01:03:55,261 --> 01:03:59,540
the earth so radically that we've
polluted the ocean and fucked up the,

2286
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:04,700
the air and left big fucking giant
spots where no one can go for a hundred

2287
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:05,760
thousand years.

2288
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,840
There's a gang of them.

2289
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:09,960
Well we drop nuclear bombs just
to fucking see what would happen.

2290
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,450
We had to get rid of nuclear waste.

2291
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:15,900
We've done this like
we've done it so quickly.

2292
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:17,670
It's really amazing.

2293
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:18,271
And,

2294
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:21,960
but we're the same animal
that we were 50,000 years ago.

2295
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,330
Not that I was creating
so many of the problems.

2296
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:24,571
I mean,

2297
01:04:24,571 --> 01:04:25,081
I think the,

2298
01:04:25,081 --> 01:04:25,914
uh,

2299
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,570
the Guy Maltus he's a
politician and you know,

2300
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:34,620
economist and he basically
said food production increases
arithmetically and you

2301
01:04:34,641 --> 01:04:34,810
know,

2302
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:38,550
population increases
geometrically so that ultimately,

2303
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:38,791
you know,

2304
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:41,310
the way things are going and we see this
and all of these third world countries,

2305
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:42,210
you know,

2306
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:44,370
reproduction has far outpaced,

2307
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:44,851
you know,

2308
01:04:44,851 --> 01:04:46,440
the amount of food supply and the things,

2309
01:04:46,441 --> 01:04:48,180
and this happens at
various periods in history.

2310
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:51,900
And so either nature is going to take
care of it either in one fell swoop

2311
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:55,800
through a giant famine or through
disease or through other kind of

2312
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:57,510
overpopulation of facts.

2313
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:00,330
Then nature will kind of
auto correct these mistakes.

2314
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:05,360
Or you have to take different methods of
contraception very seriously and start

2315
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:06,930
teaching that,

2316
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:07,381
you know,

2317
01:05:07,381 --> 01:05:08,360
at an early age.

2318
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:09,460
And you know,

2319
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:12,120
putting that in people's
minds from the start.

2320
01:05:12,121 --> 01:05:14,870
And I think that's one area
where we're terrible at.

2321
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,150
I mean,

2322
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:18,610
we don't want to talk about
fucking still preaching abstinence,

2323
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:19,920
which is nonsense.

2324
01:05:19,921 --> 01:05:22,450
Just that Michele Bachmann is hilarious.

2325
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:25,360
It is amazing that broad is
still running for president.

2326
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:30,040
It is amazing with her big gay husband
when they run around and tell everybody

2327
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:31,120
not to have sex.

2328
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:31,901
I mean,

2329
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:33,820
it is really fucking funny,

2330
01:05:33,821 --> 01:05:34,390
man.

2331
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:35,530
Somebody got a fall.

2332
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:36,400
That dude around.

2333
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:36,940
I mean,

2334
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:37,331
I can't,

2335
01:05:37,331 --> 01:05:37,620
I,

2336
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:37,930
I,

2337
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:38,470
you know,

2338
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:42,220
I started paying attention to the
polls and you know when Ron Paul,

2339
01:05:42,221 --> 01:05:44,860
especially when Ron Paul's
ahead in Iowa right now,

2340
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:45,910
he's got the lead.

2341
01:05:45,911 --> 01:05:48,760
He's number one in Iowa and
everybody shit in their pants.

2342
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:50,560
But that Michele Bachmann broad,

2343
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,060
she's still in it,

2344
01:05:52,061 --> 01:05:52,660
man.

2345
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,770
She's still in it.

2346
01:05:53,771 --> 01:05:54,604
She's in it to win it.

2347
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:55,240
She's,

2348
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,530
I can't believe it.

2349
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,101
I would've thought,

2350
01:05:57,101 --> 01:05:59,590
doesn't everybody know
she's off fucking loon?

2351
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:00,221
Like have it,

2352
01:06:00,221 --> 01:06:01,270
hasn't that been figured out yet?

2353
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,410
Have you seen her husband?

2354
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,470
Have you seen him talk like
that guy can't hold it in?

2355
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,290
Flowers come out of his asshole.

2356
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,133
What he farts,

2357
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:08,800
I mean,

2358
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,670
he's a guy.

2359
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,460
If he threw his hands
up randomly in the air,

2360
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,940
glitter would just magically
come out of the air.

2361
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,080
It wouldn't matter whether it was,

2362
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:17,650
you know,

2363
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:21,130
whether it came from his skin or came
from the universe recognizing that gayness

2364
01:06:21,131 --> 01:06:22,300
that he exudes,

2365
01:06:22,301 --> 01:06:24,400
it needs to be a glorified glitter.

2366
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:25,660
He could create glitter,

2367
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:26,583
he can create.

2368
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:26,851
He,

2369
01:06:26,851 --> 01:06:28,630
he's a fucking peacock man.

2370
01:06:28,930 --> 01:06:30,220
He's hilarious.

2371
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:33,850
He's one of the gayest people to
ever walk the face of the planet.

2372
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:34,773
At least he looks like he,

2373
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:35,723
yeah.

2374
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:36,520
Yeah.

2375
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:41,410
And she's running around talking
about about gay marriage and you know,

2376
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:45,880
and they have a pray the gay away sort
of a clinic for the one guy did an expo

2377
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:46,691
say on there,

2378
01:06:46,691 --> 01:06:49,450
pray the gay away clinic and
there was a guy behind him.

2379
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:49,950
Somehow or another,

2380
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:52,510
they do this thing where they all get
together and they hold onto each other and

2381
01:06:52,511 --> 01:06:52,751
he says,

2382
01:06:52,751 --> 01:06:54,580
the guy behind him clearly has a hard on

2383
01:06:56,210 --> 01:06:57,640
the fuck you doing,

2384
01:06:57,641 --> 01:06:58,474
man.

2385
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,430
And these people are
running for president,

2386
01:07:00,431 --> 01:07:00,671
man.

2387
01:07:00,671 --> 01:07:01,690
It's amazing.

2388
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:04,690
But she's got a lot of people
that think that she can win.

2389
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:05,561
I mean,

2390
01:07:05,561 --> 01:07:07,210
not enough to actually win,

2391
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:07,751
I don't think,

2392
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:09,400
unless everybody else fucks up bat.

2393
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,110
But the problem is they keep fucking up.

2394
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:12,100
Everybody keeps talking about.

2395
01:07:12,310 --> 01:07:12,881
It's like there's no,

2396
01:07:12,881 --> 01:07:13,810
Rick Perry is still in it,

2397
01:07:13,811 --> 01:07:15,070
but it's just cursory at this point.

2398
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:15,701
It's like,

2399
01:07:15,701 --> 01:07:16,241
what is he doing?

2400
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:16,780
Come on dude.

2401
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,800
Everybody knows you're an idiot.

2402
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:18,381
You know,

2403
01:07:18,381 --> 01:07:19,211
like you're done,

2404
01:07:19,211 --> 01:07:19,571
man.

2405
01:07:19,571 --> 01:07:20,980
You fucking can't talk.

2406
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:21,431
All right.

2407
01:07:21,431 --> 01:07:22,360
You forget shit.

2408
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:23,111
And you know,

2409
01:07:23,111 --> 01:07:23,920
you're like,

2410
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:28,000
George Bush was way better and people
were offended by how dumb he was.

2411
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:28,900
You know,

2412
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,240
Rick Perry's like really fucking stupid.

2413
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:33,220
George Bush was better than this guy,

2414
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,390
like way better at talking,

2415
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:35,231
you know?

2416
01:07:35,231 --> 01:07:35,441
I mean,

2417
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:36,400
he seemed like,

2418
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:36,770
you know,

2419
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:38,140
he wasn't an intellectual,

2420
01:07:38,141 --> 01:07:38,890
but he seemed like,

2421
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:40,770
especially back when he
was running for governor,

2422
01:07:40,771 --> 01:07:42,610
if it seems like you put
some fucking words together,

2423
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:43,960
this guy's an embarrassment.

2424
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:44,891
So it was like,

2425
01:07:44,891 --> 01:07:46,360
who else does,

2426
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:46,901
no one laughed.

2427
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:47,170
I mean,

2428
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:49,570
what Mitt Romney and fucking,

2429
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:50,170
um,

2430
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,250
the other guy with a big head,

2431
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:52,360
it's gotta be around Paul.

2432
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:52,991
Yeah.

2433
01:07:52,991 --> 01:07:53,471
But yeah,

2434
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,660
but really that seemed,

2435
01:07:55,661 --> 01:07:55,901
I mean,

2436
01:07:55,901 --> 01:07:57,010
they got to let that happen.

2437
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:58,330
I doubt it.

2438
01:07:58,330 --> 01:07:58,751
I doubt it.

2439
01:07:58,751 --> 01:08:00,370
But Mitt Newt Gingrich,

2440
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:01,600
how hilarious is that?

2441
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:02,820
That's like somebody that,

2442
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,450
you know what that would
be like if new king,

2443
01:08:04,451 --> 01:08:05,350
which should be president.

2444
01:08:05,351 --> 01:08:08,530
It'd be like if you dated this girl and
she was a cunt and her dad was a country

2445
01:08:08,531 --> 01:08:09,364
or cunt,

2446
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:10,630
that's Newt Gingrich.

2447
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:11,621
You know,

2448
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:15,860
like if you dated a girl and she was
just a fucking choose nagging pain in the

2449
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:16,460
ass

2450
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:18,920
and then you had to go over and meet
her parents and her dad is like,

2451
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:20,150
you better be nice to my daughter.

2452
01:08:20,151 --> 01:08:21,290
I'll tell you that right now.

2453
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:23,660
I don't take any bullshit from kids,

2454
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:24,583
you know?

2455
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,070
Oh,

2456
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:26,300
can I deal with your dad?

2457
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:26,961
He's like,

2458
01:08:26,961 --> 01:08:27,680
someone's dad,

2459
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,400
he's a monster.

2460
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,630
Where does glitter go?

2461
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,200
You never throw glitter away.

2462
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:31,761
Is it like,

2463
01:08:31,761 --> 01:08:35,180
are we breathing in glitter or are we
starting with complex on where you live

2464
01:08:35,181 --> 01:08:37,730
because you have glitter on your
right now you don't even know it.

2465
01:08:37,731 --> 01:08:38,330
And it's like,

2466
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:39,500
where does that go though?

2467
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:40,420
Yeah,

2468
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:41,151
it does.

2469
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:45,260
It just fall on the ground and it's
the strip clubs now it's on your,

2470
01:08:45,261 --> 01:08:47,690
on your face right below your
elbow from my little ones.

2471
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,870
They have when you have little
ones and they have glitter.

2472
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:52,460
We always playing with glitter
is always like glue and glitter.

2473
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,480
There was making things.

2474
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:54,181
Where does it go?

2475
01:08:54,181 --> 01:08:54,711
It gets thrown away.

2476
01:08:54,711 --> 01:08:58,250
I guess we're probably breeding glitter
and you might go and die from good or

2477
01:08:58,251 --> 01:08:58,700
Brian,

2478
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,610
don't worry about that shirt.

2479
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:00,560
To go back to this,

2480
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:01,650
the point that you had a,

2481
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:03,170
you were talking about sex earlier,

2482
01:09:03,171 --> 01:09:05,070
cause I thought about this a lot for uh,

2483
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:05,540
you know,

2484
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:09,060
in building a society and some of
the solutions that people had to,

2485
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:09,491
to,

2486
01:09:09,491 --> 01:09:10,200
uh,

2487
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:10,580
to the,

2488
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:15,140
the population growth problem was
actually teaching a form of Tantra,

2489
01:09:15,141 --> 01:09:18,560
which is where you withhold your
seed when you're having sex.

2490
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:19,453
So

2491
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,070
in all fairness,

2492
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:22,821
all fairness,

2493
01:09:22,821 --> 01:09:23,690
I gave it a go.

2494
01:09:23,691 --> 01:09:24,010
Right,

2495
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:24,530
right.

2496
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:25,670
And it's pretty,

2497
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:26,840
it's pretty interesting,

2498
01:09:26,841 --> 01:09:27,501
the dynamics.

2499
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:27,770
Now,

2500
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:29,120
I don't think I would try this,

2501
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:29,511
you know,

2502
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:30,620
personally very often,

2503
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:34,670
but if you created a system where you
actually taught sex and this was one of

2504
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,990
the ways that you could do it and not how
was tantra any better than the pullout

2505
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:38,630
method?

2506
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:38,850
You know,

2507
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:39,111
I don't,

2508
01:09:39,111 --> 01:09:42,590
I barely trust people to drive
cars pull out all the time.

2509
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:42,891
You know,

2510
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:44,000
that feeling that you get,

2511
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:46,200
it doesn't matter if you're
having sex or if you're,

2512
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,450
if you're masturbating,

2513
01:09:47,451 --> 01:09:47,691
whatever,

2514
01:09:47,691 --> 01:09:49,310
you get that feeling after you're done.

2515
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:51,200
That's just kind of a bummer.

2516
01:09:51,201 --> 01:09:51,531
Anyway.

2517
01:09:51,531 --> 01:09:52,460
You look at it really,

2518
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:53,450
it's kind of like,

2519
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:55,370
ah yeah,

2520
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:55,851
a little bit.

2521
01:09:55,851 --> 01:09:57,530
It's been way better with
sex and masturbating.

2522
01:09:57,531 --> 01:09:58,730
Like if you're using a flashlight,

2523
01:09:58,731 --> 01:10:00,440
the feeling is like it's like 10 times,

2524
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:02,090
but even when you're having sex it's like,

2525
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:02,540
eh,

2526
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:06,830
sometimes there's that that kind of
really cool like glowy feeling afterward.

2527
01:10:06,831 --> 01:10:07,664
I guess.

2528
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:08,570
I understand that,

2529
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:09,910
but it kind of,

2530
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:11,600
it kind of allows you to keep,

2531
01:10:11,601 --> 01:10:11,921
first of all,

2532
01:10:11,921 --> 01:10:15,500
it allows you to keep doing
it like indefinitely for
like a long period of time.

2533
01:10:15,501 --> 01:10:18,590
So you can just go to the point
of climax and then you cool off,

2534
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:19,341
you chill out,

2535
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:20,750
you're hanging out and after,

2536
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:21,021
you know,

2537
01:10:21,021 --> 01:10:22,100
after you do that with a person,

2538
01:10:22,101 --> 01:10:22,790
it's not like,

2539
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:23,130
hey,

2540
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:23,840
go get cleaned up.

2541
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,310
We're going to,

2542
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,561
you know,

2543
01:10:24,561 --> 01:10:25,490
sort something else out.

2544
01:10:25,491 --> 01:10:26,900
You're like still in the mindset.

2545
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:29,660
So you can stretch it out for
these long periods of time.

2546
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,540
You're blue ball and yourself to death.

2547
01:10:31,541 --> 01:10:36,541
So you could basically occupy a massive
amount of time having sex and it's

2548
01:10:36,801 --> 01:10:37,131
pretty,

2549
01:10:37,131 --> 01:10:37,964
it's pretty fun.

2550
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:40,940
The chicken all drives like
motherfucker lose just come

2551
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:45,800
piece up for a little while.

2552
01:10:45,801 --> 01:10:47,870
But I mean that was one
of the ideas that they,

2553
01:10:47,871 --> 01:10:48,501
that they taught.

2554
01:10:48,501 --> 01:10:51,380
I mean obviously contraception
is super important but you know,

2555
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:55,090
just teaching different
methods is going to be vitally.

2556
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,100
I don't think we should teach
them Tantra fuck all day.

2557
01:10:58,101 --> 01:10:59,120
This is what I want you to do,

2558
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:01,400
but hold onto your lows and fuck all day.

2559
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:04,100
But imagine how much more
entertaining that is.

2560
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:06,560
Then just fucking for five
minutes and then that's it.

2561
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:07,370
That's all you're done.

2562
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:10,450
You got to stretch out something
that's constantly medium.

2563
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:11,451
Yeah,

2564
01:11:11,451 --> 01:11:11,811
maybe.

2565
01:11:11,811 --> 01:11:12,051
Yeah,

2566
01:11:12,051 --> 01:11:12,441
a fucker.

2567
01:11:12,441 --> 01:11:13,440
And then take her out to dinner

2568
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,540
and always do it in that order.

2569
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:16,411
You know,

2570
01:11:16,411 --> 01:11:19,800
the worst is when you see a guy who takes
a girl to a comedy club and he know he

2571
01:11:19,801 --> 01:11:23,850
hasn't fucked her yet and she's all
mouthy and shit and yell and shit out,

2572
01:11:23,851 --> 01:11:24,211
and you're like,

2573
01:11:24,211 --> 01:11:25,050
why is this?

2574
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:25,771
I'll tell you why.

2575
01:11:25,771 --> 01:11:27,180
Because you didn't fuck her.

2576
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:28,530
You didn't fuck her before you leave.

2577
01:11:28,531 --> 01:11:29,460
And that's true shit.

2578
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:31,980
If you gorilla fuck a girl
before you leave the house,

2579
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:33,001
she first of all,

2580
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:33,600
she's not.

2581
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,220
She's not trying to draw an extra tension.

2582
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:37,650
Her genetics tell her she's
already gotten fucked today.

2583
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:38,700
Chill out.

2584
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:39,540
You don't need any,

2585
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:42,420
any extraordinary amount of attention.

2586
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,471
Don't need me.

2587
01:11:43,471 --> 01:11:44,790
Extraordinary love.

2588
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:46,440
Just settle the fuck down.

2589
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:47,550
But if you don't fuck them,

2590
01:11:47,551 --> 01:11:50,190
and then you take them out into the
wild and they're pumping out all those,

2591
01:11:50,191 --> 01:11:51,330
someone's going to fuck me tonight.

2592
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:53,190
Hormones and it might be you.

2593
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:54,150
Hopefully it's you,

2594
01:11:54,151 --> 01:11:55,800
but if she's a crazy bitch,

2595
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,020
she's trying to like see if
there's another offer out there.

2596
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:58,621
She's like,

2597
01:11:58,621 --> 01:11:58,921
maybe,

2598
01:11:58,921 --> 01:12:00,150
maybe I'm not even to stay with him.

2599
01:12:00,151 --> 01:12:00,661
Who knows?

2600
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:01,401
Whoa,

2601
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:02,070
where it's fucking,

2602
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,903
I'm funny.

2603
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,870
A lot of those effects and not only
evening dependent but whole relationship

2604
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:09,030
depending on the shoe ever properly.

2605
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:11,190
Never probably get by a lot.

2606
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:11,900
Yeah,

2607
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:12,640
yeah,

2608
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,350
yeah.

2609
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:14,730
Or never been with a man.

2610
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:15,031
I mean,

2611
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:16,680
how many girls have you
ever met that like date?

2612
01:12:16,681 --> 01:12:20,580
Like really weak do is because they're
terrified of being in a situation where a

2613
01:12:20,581 --> 01:12:24,360
man controls them because either someone
was a man was abusive earlier in their

2614
01:12:24,361 --> 01:12:29,220
life or they had a bad father
relationship or stepfather relationship.

2615
01:12:29,221 --> 01:12:33,600
There's something where they
shy away from any strong man,

2616
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:34,171
you know,

2617
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:36,780
where they were literally forced to be
the man and the relationship and they

2618
01:12:36,781 --> 01:12:37,140
have,

2619
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:41,090
I mean I know girls that are
constantly involved in like Beta men,

2620
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:44,160
like guys were like real issues
that can never get it together.

2621
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,440
They're always fucking
falling behind on their bills.

2622
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:46,950
They're always,

2623
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:47,281
you know,

2624
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:50,250
and these girls are always like nagging
at them to get their shit together.

2625
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,820
And it's this weird relationship man
with a woman makes more of the money and

2626
01:12:53,821 --> 01:12:57,150
the woman pot pays for the car and he
asked to borrow it from her when he wants

2627
01:12:57,151 --> 01:12:57,721
to go out.

2628
01:12:57,721 --> 01:12:58,554
And it's like,

2629
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:59,280
wow.

2630
01:12:59,280 --> 01:12:59,761
You know,

2631
01:12:59,761 --> 01:12:59,941
it's,

2632
01:12:59,941 --> 01:13:02,760
it's such a clear situation
to everybody else.

2633
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,200
Like you'd see on the outside,

2634
01:13:04,201 --> 01:13:04,441
you're like,

2635
01:13:04,441 --> 01:13:04,651
look,

2636
01:13:04,651 --> 01:13:05,430
this is not good.

2637
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:07,500
This is fucking completely unnatural dude.

2638
01:13:07,501 --> 01:13:08,880
There's a reason why she's yelling at you.

2639
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:09,990
You know,

2640
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:10,681
hey man,

2641
01:13:10,681 --> 01:13:11,790
we're all equal.

2642
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:12,870
We're all even,

2643
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,040
it's all the same.

2644
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:14,911
Who cares man,

2645
01:13:14,911 --> 01:13:15,750
she makes the money.

2646
01:13:15,751 --> 01:13:16,231
You know,

2647
01:13:16,231 --> 01:13:17,400
I help out around the house,

2648
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:18,930
the fuck Outta here.

2649
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:20,250
You know,

2650
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:22,500
there's no way you're
fucking her correctly.

2651
01:13:23,390 --> 01:13:24,210
You've got to fuck her.

2652
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:25,170
Like you have all the money.

2653
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,430
That's the only way you're
supposed to fuck them.

2654
01:13:27,431 --> 01:13:28,141
You're supposed to fuck them.

2655
01:13:28,141 --> 01:13:29,160
Like you have all the money,

2656
01:13:29,161 --> 01:13:29,341
dad,

2657
01:13:29,341 --> 01:13:31,800
he's going to take care of
everything and he can't say that.

2658
01:13:31,801 --> 01:13:32,101
I just like,

2659
01:13:32,101 --> 01:13:34,110
daddy can't even take care
of its own fucking car bill.

2660
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:37,350
Oh bench make my dick go
live and chickens ugly.

2661
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:42,560
There's some definite masculinizing
movement that has caused a whole crop of

2662
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:43,590
males to be,

2663
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:44,370
you know,

2664
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:45,330
pretty ineffectual.

2665
01:13:45,331 --> 01:13:45,940
I think when it,

2666
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:49,230
I think a lot of it is because women
have to take care of themselves and they

2667
01:13:49,231 --> 01:13:50,430
don't want to hear bullshit.

2668
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,150
And then men want those women to
like them so they become emasculated,

2669
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:55,310
emasculated,

2670
01:13:55,310 --> 01:13:56,910
divorce is brutal.

2671
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:57,781
That chops away.

2672
01:13:57,781 --> 01:14:00,240
A guy living with your mom at a small age,

2673
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:00,541
you know.

2674
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:01,300
Awesome.

2675
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:01,510
Oh,

2676
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:02,343
just with your mom.

2677
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,410
I lived with my mom and my sister.

2678
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:04,831
It turned,

2679
01:14:04,831 --> 01:14:05,510
you know,

2680
01:14:05,510 --> 01:14:06,343
your boy,

2681
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:10,310
I got to fuck with a real dog.

2682
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,153
Well it's not a real,

2683
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:12,130
but it's better

2684
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:12,721
than a real doll.

2685
01:14:12,721 --> 01:14:13,554
Last they uh,

2686
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:17,740
we had this Santa Roast at desk squad
where we just roasted Sam AAA dress up as

2687
01:14:17,741 --> 01:14:19,770
Santa Claus and everyone and uh,

2688
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:23,150
this company from called
synthetics.com whoa.

2689
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:24,103
I more than that picture.

2690
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:25,071
And He,

2691
01:14:25,071 --> 01:14:27,010
he's this guy and his girlfriend.

2692
01:14:27,011 --> 01:14:27,500
Spell it.

2693
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:28,000
Alright.

2694
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:28,810
Synthetics,

2695
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:29,860
s y n s,

2696
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,980
I n t h e t,

2697
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:35,770
I c s.com.com.

2698
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:39,220
And it's just him and his wife and
that he does everything by hand.

2699
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:44,150
And he just sculpts these beautiful
fucking like real dog type things and it,

2700
01:14:44,210 --> 01:14:44,630
it,

2701
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:45,310
it would have been,

2702
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:46,180
it's so perfect.

2703
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:50,880
I wish like him and fleshlight would
team up because he has like apart like

2704
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:51,621
these vaginas that,

2705
01:14:51,621 --> 01:14:51,810
that,

2706
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:52,070
that,

2707
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,950
that you can take out and
clean and stuff like that.

2708
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:56,230
And they're kind of like flashlight ish.

2709
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:57,243
But uh,

2710
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:00,490
I could just imagine him putting a real
flashlight in that thing because it felt

2711
01:15:00,491 --> 01:15:01,030
real.

2712
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:03,940
It looked real and it was
so weird seeing Sam Tripoli.

2713
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:05,080
Like after the show was done,

2714
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:05,351
we just,

2715
01:15:05,351 --> 01:15:08,620
when we were all hanging out and Sam was
just sitting there staring at it like a

2716
01:15:08,621 --> 01:15:11,260
little kid looking at
boobs for his first time.

2717
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:14,500
And that's what the reaction to everybody
that was looking at these things.

2718
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,341
I didn't fuck one of these.

2719
01:15:15,341 --> 01:15:15,850
No,

2720
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:17,220
we just had a couple
of the Christmas party.

2721
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:20,620
That's about 5,000 dude,

2722
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:22,130
it's amazing how life like this,

2723
01:15:22,131 --> 01:15:22,331
this,

2724
01:15:22,331 --> 01:15:22,510
this,

2725
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:23,380
this was feel real.

2726
01:15:23,381 --> 01:15:24,640
You open up the mouth.

2727
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:25,360
I mean it's,

2728
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:25,740
it's,

2729
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:26,270
it's,

2730
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:27,820
it's creepy when you're looking at this.

2731
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:28,270
Awesome.

2732
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:30,370
This is amazing how realistic it looks.

2733
01:15:30,371 --> 01:15:30,691
I'm Rick,

2734
01:15:30,691 --> 01:15:31,524

2735
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:32,680

me and Jaden cold.

2738
01:15:35,290 --> 01:15:38,260
Like we were just raping
this one and this one girl.

2739
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:42,510
Yeah cause it's cooling cause he's just
pulled down a pants and look at her bio

2740
01:15:42,530 --> 01:15:42,940
and stuff.

2741
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:46,870
It was and her bubble comes out so you
can put new kinds of buttholes in and

2742
01:15:46,871 --> 01:15:47,140
stuff.

2743
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:48,220
It's really weird.

2744
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:48,701
Wow.

2745
01:15:48,701 --> 01:15:50,200
They have a bunch of different models.

2746
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,150
It's crazy and it's cool cause I was,

2747
01:15:52,151 --> 01:15:52,360
I,

2748
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,670
I got to talk to them and it's
like how do you design them?

2749
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:55,031
And he's like,

2750
01:15:55,031 --> 01:15:55,691
well this girl,

2751
01:15:55,691 --> 01:15:55,850
you know,

2752
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:59,710
started off with a photo of Megan Fox
and then we took the body using this like

2753
01:15:59,711 --> 01:16:00,850
famous uh,

2754
01:16:00,851 --> 01:16:01,230
you know,

2755
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:03,730
seven crush that website have really?

2756
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:04,300
Yeah.

2757
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,860
I feel bad just like that.

2758
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:06,551
We crushed it.

2759
01:16:06,551 --> 01:16:07,690
I can't even get on it anymore.

2760
01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:11,440
It's fun.

2761
01:16:11,740 --> 01:16:12,730
I love when that happens.

2762
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:14,710
But he said anytime you,

2763
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:14,940
uh,

2764
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,690
if you want to do a
podcast at the ice house,

2765
01:16:16,691 --> 01:16:17,610
you'll bring a couple of bites.

2766
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:19,190
We can play around with
it and we could meet him,

2767
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:20,441
tell him to get,

2768
01:16:20,441 --> 01:16:22,600
get with the flashlight people
and come up with a better cooter.

2769
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:22,871
Yeah.

2770
01:16:22,871 --> 01:16:24,170
How do you clean that thing out man?

2771
01:16:24,171 --> 01:16:24,441
It's odd.

2772
01:16:24,441 --> 01:16:26,200
The fleshlight where you
unscrew the bottom of it,

2773
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:29,680
the parts that you fuck
up a have like this,

2774
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:30,130
uh,

2775
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:34,780
they can pull out kind of like a
fleshlight and a refrigerator and like the

2776
01:16:34,781 --> 01:16:35,011
button,

2777
01:16:35,011 --> 01:16:35,620
what comes out.

2778
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:38,690
The next level is going to be hooking
that up to a computer program where you

2779
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:43,720
get like some artificial intelligence
said he wants to take the iPhone dock and

2780
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,001
the neck of it.

2781
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:51,001
So you can talk to Siri through the
iPhone or through them and she'd be like,

2782
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,120
hello.

2783
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:56,740
You know whether you can get it to the
point where it was like a sexual training

2784
01:16:56,741 --> 01:16:57,574
device.

2785
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:00,400
Apparently they're going to come out
with some sort of an apple device.

2786
01:17:00,401 --> 01:17:04,240
We're Siri communicates to your phone
through like something that you were,

2787
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:07,390
so you'll be doing like almost
everything through Siri,

2788
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:08,320
you know,

2789
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,410
this is the idea to it.

2790
01:17:09,411 --> 01:17:10,070
And like you'll press

2791
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,821
a button and say,

2792
01:17:10,821 --> 01:17:11,211
Siri,

2793
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:12,260
what emails do I have?

2794
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:13,010
And you know,

2795
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:13,640
as Siri,

2796
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:14,960
he gets more and more advanced.

2797
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:18,230
So whatever's in your pocket you'll
be doing everything through voice

2798
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:19,340
recognition software.

2799
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,560
So series going to control the,

2800
01:17:21,561 --> 01:17:22,110
so cereal,

2801
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:23,140
chill the fuck robot.

2802
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:26,600
Well hopefully fuck
first the destruct later.

2803
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:28,670
Once we realize that we're fucking there,

2804
01:17:28,671 --> 01:17:29,990
their robot daughters,

2805
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:30,881
that's an,

2806
01:17:30,881 --> 01:17:31,970
they're going to come after us.

2807
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:33,500
It was one thing.

2808
01:17:33,501 --> 01:17:36,260
What's funny is that his version
of like that the pussy part,

2809
01:17:36,261 --> 01:17:36,830
which was like,

2810
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:37,070
you know,

2811
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:38,480
kind of fleshlight ish.

2812
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:40,400
But it was definitely,

2813
01:17:40,401 --> 01:17:40,701
you know,

2814
01:17:40,701 --> 01:17:43,280
you could see the quality of
flashlight was a billion times better.

2815
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:45,460
What is it in the softness of it is like,

2816
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:49,130
I think it uses maybe a close
similar kind of material with it.

2817
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:51,590
But what was different about
his is that he actually,

2818
01:17:51,591 --> 01:17:52,700
his wife or a girlfriend,

2819
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:53,150
uh,

2820
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:55,730
paint painted like the
lips of different color,

2821
01:17:55,731 --> 01:17:56,031
you know,

2822
01:17:56,031 --> 01:17:57,470
like kind of beat him up a little.

2823
01:17:57,470 --> 01:17:58,840
Kind of like really,

2824
01:17:58,880 --> 01:17:59,713
really

2825
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:02,540
like the makeup job.

2826
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:03,800
Like catching him tattoo.

2827
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:06,740
Also just catching dick for decades.

2828
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:12,980
The entryways all skidded like fucking
Lego to plan keeps coming in for

2829
01:18:12,981 --> 01:18:13,420
Atlantic.

2830
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:14,000
Yeah,

2831
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:14,833
exactly.

2832
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:17,210
Just skid elbow.

2833
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:18,740
It's like skid marks on a,

2834
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:20,840
on a fucking pool table.

2835
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,150
Fear factor was awesome last night,

2836
01:18:23,151 --> 01:18:23,301
man.

2837
01:18:23,301 --> 01:18:27,860
It was really interesting to see
that the two muscle guys like the,

2838
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,090
there was two guys on the show,

2839
01:18:29,091 --> 01:18:30,050
like the big buff,

2840
01:18:30,051 --> 01:18:30,561
like rip.

2841
01:18:30,561 --> 01:18:33,560
The guys had such a hard
time early on I was like,

2842
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:34,070
wow,

2843
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:37,150
those two little gay guys
is these little muscles.

2844
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:38,600
Not a way to be man.

2845
01:18:38,601 --> 01:18:39,170
That's not,

2846
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:41,990
you mean they were saying that
there are agile and they move well,

2847
01:18:41,991 --> 01:18:45,830
but the bottom line is you're carrying
around a bunch of unnecessary muscle.

2848
01:18:45,831 --> 01:18:47,810
It's not aiding you in your frame.

2849
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,940
The way you move with it
requires a lot of fuel.

2850
01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:51,770
You get really tired really easily.

2851
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:52,940
Like those guys that have,

2852
01:18:52,941 --> 01:18:56,290
like when you see a guy that has an
extraordinary amount of muscle on them,

2853
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:58,930
look to someone who like does Jujitsu.

2854
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,230
Just someone who does MMA.

2855
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:01,490
You look at that guy and go,

2856
01:19:01,491 --> 01:19:02,630
how long can you laugh?

2857
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:03,591
You can't.

2858
01:19:03,591 --> 01:19:05,120
Last I'll have to do
is grab a hold of you.

2859
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:07,610
All you have to do is engage
a guy like that in a fight.

2860
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:09,650
All the gains you might have
five to get a hold of them.

2861
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:11,660
I mean there could be really explosive,

2862
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:13,011
all that muscle,

2863
01:19:13,011 --> 01:19:14,540
he could really have a powerful punch.

2864
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:15,680
You have to be like really careful.

2865
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:18,800
But if you can get past that and somehow
or another managed to get ahold of them

2866
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:19,800
and you know,

2867
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:20,833
just hang on,

2868
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:25,930
just make them struggle to get off you
and in 10 15 seconds he's at 30% of what

2869
01:19:26,091 --> 01:19:27,800
he was 15 seconds ago.

2870
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:28,491
Like literally.

2871
01:19:28,491 --> 01:19:29,151
It's amazing.

2872
01:19:29,151 --> 01:19:34,151
Like there were like guys like that are
always like one good exertion away from

2873
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:36,980
the heart fucking
exploding of their chest.

2874
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:38,660
It's like they have a computer,

2875
01:19:38,661 --> 01:19:43,460
like a seller on 300 processor and they
got a jacked up to four 25 you're not

2876
01:19:43,461 --> 01:19:45,400
supposed to be carrying
around that much weight man.

2877
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:46,071
You're just not.

2878
01:19:46,071 --> 01:19:47,210
And it's not natural.

2879
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:48,740
It's really hard to do.

2880
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:52,640
You got to put a bunch of shit in your
system to make yourself carrying that

2881
01:19:52,641 --> 01:19:53,474
much weight.

2882
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,120
And most of those guys are non athletic.

2883
01:19:56,121 --> 01:19:56,570
You know,

2884
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:57,590
here's a question about the show.

2885
01:19:57,591 --> 01:19:59,430
I don't know if you can answer this if,

2886
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:00,800
if I caught something,

2887
01:20:00,801 --> 01:20:02,090
but is there a,

2888
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:03,350
did the,

2889
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:04,161
do you guys say like,

2890
01:20:04,161 --> 01:20:04,580
Hey,

2891
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:07,800
you guys need to just make fun of each
other because that chick last night was

2892
01:20:07,801 --> 01:20:08,040
just like,

2893
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:12,990
your ugly face is fucking crazy girl.

2894
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:14,970
Talk some shit about her eyelashes first.

2895
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:17,190
The other girl opened
up the gates of hell,

2896
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:20,460
but once she realized she didn't want to
fuck with that girl because that black

2897
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:21,930
chick was me and,

2898
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:23,340
and she was getting in her face about it.

2899
01:20:23,341 --> 01:20:24,660
You so ugly.

2900
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,780
I was Kansas not talking
about my eyelashes.

2901
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:27,391
You so ugly.

2902
01:20:27,391 --> 01:20:27,781
She was like,

2903
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:28,614
you look like a,

2904
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:31,870
the the evil step sister surprised.

2905
01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:33,840
There's not more Jerry
Springer Shit on that show.

2906
01:20:34,230 --> 01:20:34,561
Well,

2907
01:20:34,561 --> 01:20:35,580
we keep it to a minimum.

2908
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,380
We showed very little of that,

2909
01:20:37,381 --> 01:20:38,131
that argument.

2910
01:20:38,131 --> 01:20:39,480
But that argument was a big argument.

2911
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:41,010
That shit went on for a while.

2912
01:20:41,011 --> 01:20:42,150
I had to calm them down.

2913
01:20:42,151 --> 01:20:42,520
I will say,

2914
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:42,781
Hey,

2915
01:20:42,781 --> 01:20:43,290
come on.

2916
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:43,710
Listen,

2917
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:45,330
you guys are saying some mean shit.

2918
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:45,721
No,

2919
01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:47,520
I shouldn't say you guys
cause it was just the girl.

2920
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,121
Cause once,

2921
01:20:48,121 --> 01:20:50,280
once Tanika started talking shit,

2922
01:20:50,281 --> 01:20:50,980
then the,

2923
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,550
the girl shut the fuck up quick,

2924
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:53,460
you know,

2925
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:58,170
and how she treated her own
husband like well again,

2926
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:00,900
you know the fucking
water seeks its own level.

2927
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:01,920
It's like we were talking about it.

2928
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:04,950
I'm like that's not the kind of
behavior that you want to hear.

2929
01:21:04,951 --> 01:21:05,940
I want to hear in a girl.

2930
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:07,350
But for some dudes they,

2931
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:07,830
you know,

2932
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:09,960
they seek that out and I get it man.

2933
01:21:09,961 --> 01:21:10,331
Like I,

2934
01:21:10,331 --> 01:21:10,680
you know,

2935
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:11,850
I don't know if you
remember it the other day,

2936
01:21:11,930 --> 01:21:15,330
aster gave us a bunch of those
drinks for drinks and I had,

2937
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:18,600
I had one the other day cause she left
one over in the fridge and it was an

2938
01:21:18,601 --> 01:21:19,230
orange,

2939
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:21,180
a pineapple or something like that.

2940
01:21:21,390 --> 01:21:24,970
And I was drinking it and suddenly
in my mouth a bug like uh,

2941
01:21:25,190 --> 01:21:26,240
like you know,

2942
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:27,900
lightening bugs,

2943
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:28,681
what those look like,

2944
01:21:28,681 --> 01:21:31,530
the ones that aren't lightening bolts
but look exactly like a lightening bolt.

2945
01:21:31,531 --> 01:21:35,310
So it got in the juice and I was just
pouring out and right there I was like

2946
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:36,061
about to Puke.

2947
01:21:36,061 --> 01:21:36,780
Like I was like,

2948
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:40,350
I couldn't even imagine drinking a
whole fucking milkshake of that shit.

2949
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:41,250
Impossible for me.

2950
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,181
So yeah,

2951
01:21:42,181 --> 01:21:44,820
you wouldn't be a good
candidate and heights.

2952
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:45,780
Impossible for me.

2953
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:46,621
Never.

2954
01:21:46,621 --> 01:21:47,940
You don't like to move that much.

2955
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:49,850
So that's not good for you.

2956
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:50,581
Unique factor.

2957
01:21:50,581 --> 01:21:52,050
I'm on fear factor now.

2958
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:52,920
In fact,

2959
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,753
when you,

2960
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:55,980
I hate to like be morose though,

2961
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,250
but when you see people get sick and
you see people that are unhealthy,

2962
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:00,420
do you ever stop and think,

2963
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:00,691
man,

2964
01:22:00,691 --> 01:22:03,840
eventually I'm going to have
to quit smoking cigarettes
and actually get my body

2965
01:22:03,841 --> 01:22:04,651
in some sort of shape.

2966
01:22:04,651 --> 01:22:07,410
Does that ever come up or you just gonna
ride that bitch until the wheels fall

2967
01:22:07,411 --> 01:22:07,830
off?

2968
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:08,663
Um,

2969
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:11,520
or are you not thinking about it
until something breaks on you?

2970
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:12,361
Yeah,

2971
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:12,691
Prague,

2972
01:22:12,691 --> 01:22:13,201
more of that.

2973
01:22:13,201 --> 01:22:17,190
So I'm probably more Raffi Mang and now
I'm going to be like no more marijuana

2974
01:22:17,191 --> 01:22:18,000
for me.

2975
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:18,833
I'm like,

2976
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:19,340
wait,

2977
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:20,370
she's something breaks.

2978
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:21,900
You'll get super healthy.

2979
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:22,830
Diet wise.

2980
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,070
Weightwatchers I,

2981
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:24,930
you know,

2982
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:26,190
I know you don't believe this,

2983
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,180
but I'm at the Diet wise,

2984
01:22:27,181 --> 01:22:28,420
I eat really healthy and I,

2985
01:22:28,421 --> 01:22:31,660
I'm constantly like
doing like juicing and,

2986
01:22:31,661 --> 01:22:33,330
and make some,

2987
01:22:33,331 --> 01:22:34,380
some healthy things.

2988
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:35,580
But then I definitely,

2989
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:35,821
you know,

2990
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:38,640
I'll have like an olive garden here or
there or something like that where I

2991
01:22:38,641 --> 01:22:39,000
would just,

2992
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:39,211
you know,

2993
01:22:39,211 --> 01:22:39,750
fuck,

2994
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:42,540
I'm just eating like shit going crazy.

2995
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:44,190
But for the most part if
you look at my refrigerator,

2996
01:22:44,191 --> 01:22:45,024
it's all like,

2997
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,070
it's kind of like your
refrigerator for the most part.

2998
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:47,480
Really?

2999
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:47,800
Yeah.

3000
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,560
I mean I don't eat much though.

3001
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:50,490
That's the problem I eat.

3002
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:55,820
Like last night I ate my first meal at
1:00 AM oh that's like it was all fucked

3003
01:22:56,401 --> 01:22:58,230
up and you drink a coffee during the day.

3004
01:22:58,530 --> 01:23:01,830
I drink coffee and that pretty much
it makes me not hungry for a good five

3005
01:23:01,831 --> 01:23:02,664
hours.

3006
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:06,010
I think an important concept applies
to the muscle men and applies

3007
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,101
to,

3008
01:23:06,101 --> 01:23:08,530
everybody actually wrote
about it on the Onnit blog.

3009
01:23:08,531 --> 01:23:10,300
It's called are you fit enough to survive?

3010
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:12,580
And I think there's an
important concept in there,

3011
01:23:12,581 --> 01:23:14,890
like take away all of the normal rules.

3012
01:23:14,891 --> 01:23:18,240
Let's go back to like a primitive state
where you have to chase food for awhile,

3013
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:21,850
maybe run after him a few days and you
have to do certain explosive movements in

3014
01:23:21,851 --> 01:23:23,380
a fight against an animal or another.

3015
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:23,810
That's,

3016
01:23:23,810 --> 01:23:24,720
I answered the question.

3017
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:26,080
It just take a little bit of shoe.

3018
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,750
You might fall off the car answer.

3019
01:23:30,751 --> 01:23:31,584
Yes.

3020
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:32,350
There's a certain,

3021
01:23:32,350 --> 01:23:36,280
the amount of physicality that I think
is necessary to maintain a proper mental

3022
01:23:36,281 --> 01:23:36,650
balance

3023
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:38,000
either to even for sales.

3024
01:23:38,420 --> 01:23:39,141
For some folks,

3025
01:23:39,141 --> 01:23:39,920
yes.

3026
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,420
For other folks I don't,

3027
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:44,000
I think some people are
averse to physical activity.

3028
01:23:44,001 --> 01:23:44,181
It,

3029
01:23:44,181 --> 01:23:47,610
it reminds them a fucking gym
class or whatever and they like it

3030
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:48,430
that hot.

3031
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:49,030
Especially if,

3032
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:52,270
I think especially for men that haunts
part of their physical psyche to know

3033
01:23:52,470 --> 01:23:56,740
that they wouldn't on a basic primal
level be fit enough to survive in a

3034
01:23:56,741 --> 01:23:59,340
situation where there weren't
all these rules in supermarkets

3035
01:23:59,550 --> 01:24:04,550
unless they have now mad Asperger's and
they don't know what the fuck is going

3036
01:24:04,801 --> 01:24:06,780
on and they're just sitting
there counting numbers.

3037
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:09,660
I think everyone's bodies are totally
designed different because like you work

3038
01:24:09,661 --> 01:24:09,961
out,

3039
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:11,250
you feel good when you work out.

3040
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:12,030
I work out,

3041
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:12,863
I fucking hate him.

3042
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:13,411
Always hate it.

3043
01:24:13,411 --> 01:24:15,630
Even when I was like smoking
a pack of cigarettes a day,

3044
01:24:15,631 --> 01:24:17,020
you eat dog shit all day.

3045
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:17,850
Even when I was a kid,

3046
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:18,690
even in gym class,

3047
01:24:18,691 --> 01:24:19,080
even,

3048
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:19,920
even anything.

3049
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:20,440
I hate it.

3050
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:20,671
Oh,

3051
01:24:20,671 --> 01:24:20,911
well,

3052
01:24:20,911 --> 01:24:21,181
yeah.

3053
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:21,361
I,

3054
01:24:21,361 --> 01:24:21,691
you know,

3055
01:24:21,691 --> 01:24:22,524
I think you're,

3056
01:24:22,670 --> 01:24:23,490
you enjoy it.

3057
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:23,970
Yes.

3058
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:26,020
Well we very different Brian.

3059
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:27,900
I don't know if you figured that out yet.

3060
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:29,940
Especially bodywise man,

3061
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,510
you know,

3062
01:24:30,510 --> 01:24:30,870
uh,

3063
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:31,710
I don't know how much,

3064
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:32,040
I mean,

3065
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,341
look,

3066
01:24:32,341 --> 01:24:34,440
I know that the way I'm built is,

3067
01:24:34,441 --> 01:24:37,140
a lot of it is genetics
because my mom's built like me,

3068
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:40,110
my mom is short and why my
mom's bill like a bulldog,

3069
01:24:40,111 --> 01:24:40,430
man.

3070
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:40,770
She's,

3071
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:41,603
she's a,

3072
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,510
she's not a petite lady by any
stretch of the imagination.

3073
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:47,520
She's these big ass wide feet and
they were always breaking shoes.

3074
01:24:47,521 --> 01:24:50,670
Like she has all these problems with her
feet because her feet were always way

3075
01:24:50,671 --> 01:24:52,020
too wide for women's shoes.

3076
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:52,740
You know?

3077
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:57,150
I mean it's good if you want like
a sturdy brick carrying Sicilian,

3078
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:58,440
you know,

3079
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,670
that's what my mom's probably,

3080
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:03,780
her genetics are really good for carrying
heavy shit around like back in the

3081
01:25:03,781 --> 01:25:04,614
homeland.

3082
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:07,290
But that's like I got those genetics,

3083
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:07,681
you know,

3084
01:25:07,681 --> 01:25:07,981
it's like,

3085
01:25:07,981 --> 01:25:11,100
it's real clear that
like if I don't work out,

3086
01:25:11,130 --> 01:25:12,390
I don't trust myself.

3087
01:25:12,391 --> 01:25:12,781
I don't,

3088
01:25:12,781 --> 01:25:15,210
I don't like the way I resolve issues.

3089
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,240
I don't like how quick,

3090
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:17,630
quick my temper is.

3091
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:18,400
I don't like it.

3092
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:19,890
I see that Shit doesn't happen for me.

3093
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:20,490
Aw,

3094
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:21,061
what's also,

3095
01:25:21,061 --> 01:25:22,740
but then there's the nature
versus nurture thing.

3096
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,300
Cause I know the certain
amount of his biological,

3097
01:25:24,301 --> 01:25:25,470
but a certain amount of it is also,

3098
01:25:25,471 --> 01:25:30,450
I've been feeding my body this
adrenaline energy potion and my,

3099
01:25:30,451 --> 01:25:35,070
my body from the time I was all small
boy has been exploding on things,

3100
01:25:35,071 --> 01:25:36,090
just smashing things.

3101
01:25:36,091 --> 01:25:38,340
And when your body grows up like that,

3102
01:25:38,341 --> 01:25:38,881
and it's sort of,

3103
01:25:38,881 --> 01:25:42,600
it's sort of like engineer's itself
to perform under those balance loads,

3104
01:25:42,601 --> 01:25:43,080
you know,

3105
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:46,800
under those extreme loads rather then
when it builds up for that and then when

3106
01:25:46,801 --> 01:25:47,521
there's no load,

3107
01:25:47,521 --> 01:25:48,271
there's no release,

3108
01:25:48,271 --> 01:25:49,200
there's no explosion.

3109
01:25:49,201 --> 01:25:49,740
There's no,

3110
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:50,550
there's no,

3111
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:51,600
there's no sprints.

3112
01:25:51,601 --> 01:25:52,710
There's no smash,

3113
01:25:52,711 --> 01:25:53,071
smash,

3114
01:25:53,071 --> 01:25:53,670
smash.

3115
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:57,150
All of a sudden he just got all this
smashed juice and it's not going anywhere

3116
01:25:57,180 --> 01:25:58,470
and somebody cuts you off in traffic.

3117
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,393
Fuck you.

3118
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:01,920
I'll fucking spoon my smash juice on you.

3119
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:02,550
You know?

3120
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:03,383
I mean when you,

3121
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:03,980
there's a

3122
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,440
lot of people that you see in traffic man,

3123
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:09,350
and they're fucking freaking
out and going off on someone.

3124
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:11,750
A lot of those people just need,

3125
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:13,460
they need a physical thing.

3126
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:16,130
They need a physical thing to
keep their body in balance.

3127
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:16,581
It's,

3128
01:26:16,581 --> 01:26:17,750
the body is not,

3129
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:18,920
it's not even,

3130
01:26:18,921 --> 01:26:20,000
everybody's are different.

3131
01:26:20,001 --> 01:26:20,780
Everybody has a car,

3132
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:22,970
but for a lot of us,

3133
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,140
we're not getting nearly as
much smash out as the buyer.

3134
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:26,781
Why?

3135
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:27,350
Really?

3136
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:27,921
It's everybody.

3137
01:26:27,921 --> 01:26:29,660
I really think everybody
can benefit from it.

3138
01:26:29,661 --> 01:26:31,850
The human organism was
designed for activity,

3139
01:26:31,851 --> 01:26:35,120
not for sitting in front of a
computer for nine hours in front of,

3140
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:35,451
you know,

3141
01:26:35,451 --> 01:26:37,520
driving home and then
sitting and watching TV.

3142
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:38,900
We're not designed that way.

3143
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:39,141
You know,

3144
01:26:39,141 --> 01:26:41,570
we're designed to be active
and so to compensate,

3145
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:45,200
we have to create particularly
intense one hour sessions often.

3146
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:46,970
But because we are going to be
sitting in the rest of the time,

3147
01:26:46,971 --> 01:26:49,100
it's just the nature of how our jobs are.

3148
01:26:49,101 --> 01:26:51,740
But that physical release
I think is important,

3149
01:26:51,741 --> 01:26:52,551
not just for the body.

3150
01:26:52,551 --> 01:26:54,950
Obviously the health benefits
of the body are immense.

3151
01:26:54,951 --> 01:26:56,060
But for the mind as well.

3152
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,220
You know what I've been doing man,

3153
01:26:57,221 --> 01:27:01,510
I've been doing light workouts throughout
the day instead of like just one big

3154
01:27:01,511 --> 01:27:03,460
fucking crazy workout a day.

3155
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:04,000
Um,

3156
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,110
I had a back issue.

3157
01:27:05,111 --> 01:27:07,410
I kept getting the same muscle
pull on my back cause I,

3158
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:08,410
you know,

3159
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:11,410
I would let it get like three quarters
of the way healed and then jump back into

3160
01:27:11,411 --> 01:27:13,420
Jujitsu class and fuck it up again.

3161
01:27:13,421 --> 01:27:15,640
So I had to take like a
certain amount of time off.

3162
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:16,750
And when I took time off,

3163
01:27:16,751 --> 01:27:19,930
I found out there's a lot of shit that I
could still do that wasn't fucking with

3164
01:27:19,931 --> 01:27:20,260
me.

3165
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:21,640
So I did it like easily.

3166
01:27:21,641 --> 01:27:22,331
So I said,

3167
01:27:22,331 --> 01:27:23,110
let me just,

3168
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:27,220
today I'm just going to do a couple sets
of Chin ups and a couple sets of dips

3169
01:27:27,221 --> 01:27:28,060
and that's it.

3170
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:29,740
Let's see if that fucks with my bag.

3171
01:27:29,741 --> 01:27:29,951
No,

3172
01:27:29,951 --> 01:27:30,401
it doesn't,

3173
01:27:30,401 --> 01:27:33,100
well let me try it tomorrow I'm going to
just do a gut and then I started doing

3174
01:27:33,101 --> 01:27:34,510
all these things throughout the day.

3175
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:35,980
I would do it like several times a day.

3176
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:38,520
I would do just a few
kettlebell exercises,

3177
01:27:38,521 --> 01:27:39,160
a few,

3178
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:41,380
and I've found that I was
getting like less sore,

3179
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:43,420
but I was getting like strength gains.

3180
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:46,120
It's like it was because when I was
doing it over the course of a few months,

3181
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:47,350
I was noticing that when I,

3182
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:49,420
when I do like these
little smaller workouts,

3183
01:27:49,421 --> 01:27:53,560
like a friend of mine told me that he
got the best results on his chin ups when

3184
01:27:53,561 --> 01:27:54,130
he would just,

3185
01:27:54,130 --> 01:27:57,640
he installed a chin up bar in his house
and every day he would just do 10 chin

3186
01:27:57,641 --> 01:27:58,580
ups every day.

3187
01:27:58,600 --> 01:27:59,290
Not that hard,

3188
01:27:59,290 --> 01:27:59,561
you know,

3189
01:27:59,561 --> 01:28:00,400
10 Z Z one,

3190
01:28:00,401 --> 01:28:00,581
two,

3191
01:28:00,581 --> 01:28:02,080
three you'd do 10 and he's done.

3192
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:06,130
But he did it every day and they said
after a while I could do 20 and he goes

3193
01:28:06,131 --> 01:28:06,611
crazy.

3194
01:28:06,611 --> 01:28:07,530
It's just like your body.

3195
01:28:07,531 --> 01:28:09,850
It just gets strong at doing that.

3196
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:12,280
And there was never a day
where he did it to failure.

3197
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:13,960
He just did it to 10 you know,

3198
01:28:13,961 --> 01:28:15,640
but you do it every
day and your body goes,

3199
01:28:15,641 --> 01:28:15,911
all right,

3200
01:28:15,911 --> 01:28:18,190
we need to this fucking
ligaments need more blood,

3201
01:28:18,191 --> 01:28:18,510
you know,

3202
01:28:18,510 --> 01:28:20,200
in fixing and fixing this forearm up.

3203
01:28:20,201 --> 01:28:22,240
And then next thing you know his body,

3204
01:28:22,241 --> 01:28:25,270
it was almost like no pain but gain,

3205
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:26,000
you know

3206
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,110
those bodyweight workouts.

3207
01:28:27,111 --> 01:28:28,700
A lot of people who've had
a lot of success with that,

3208
01:28:28,701 --> 01:28:30,830
I think it was Herschel Walker
that did just a ridiculous

3209
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:31,580
push ups.

3210
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:33,770
A lot of people say that Hershel
Walker also lifted weights,

3211
01:28:33,771 --> 01:28:34,610
that he lies about it.

3212
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:35,481
I don't know.

3213
01:28:35,481 --> 01:28:35,871
That's true.

3214
01:28:35,871 --> 01:28:36,130
I don't know.

3215
01:28:36,130 --> 01:28:37,310
I don't discredit them.

3216
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:40,610
But I do want to put that out there that
I did read a lot of crazy shit that he

3217
01:28:40,611 --> 01:28:40,791
said.

3218
01:28:40,791 --> 01:28:45,050
Like he only drinks like a cup of soup
and a fucking low for a couple of pieces

3219
01:28:45,051 --> 01:28:46,880
of bread and a salad that's all eat.

3220
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:47,540
And he,

3221
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:49,280
he'll eat once a day and you're like,

3222
01:28:49,281 --> 01:28:49,970
okay,

3223
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:51,320
where's all of that mass coming from?

3224
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:53,840
You gotta be numbers involved here.

3225
01:28:53,841 --> 01:28:54,351
There's gotta be,

3226
01:28:54,351 --> 01:28:56,440
there's how something has
to come in and fill that.

3227
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,710
That doesn't even make any sense and
apparently he wants people to think of

3228
01:29:00,711 --> 01:29:02,070
himself as what he is.

3229
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,230
He takes a lot of pride in
being an athletic freak,

3230
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:07,440
meaning whatever the fuck he is doing
and eating and whatever weights he was

3231
01:29:07,441 --> 01:29:07,710
lifting.

3232
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,980
The guy's 48 years old,

3233
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:11,790
he's an amazing monster shape,

3234
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:12,331
you know,

3235
01:29:12,331 --> 01:29:14,640
I mean he's still like
a real super athlete,

3236
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:15,810
but you know,

3237
01:29:15,811 --> 01:29:16,920
he had like a,

3238
01:29:16,921 --> 01:29:20,850
I believe it was trauma induced
multiple personality disorder.

3239
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:22,920
I believe it was trauma induced,

3240
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:23,600
you know,

3241
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,630
I mean from all the years of playing
football and funny a lot of issues,

3242
01:29:27,631 --> 01:29:28,381
you know and I think you,

3243
01:29:28,381 --> 01:29:30,060
I believe he wrote a book about that so.

3244
01:29:30,390 --> 01:29:32,550
So who knows how much he remembers.

3245
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:37,910
There might be one per Herschel's is seat
steak all day and fucking doing squats

3246
01:29:38,341 --> 01:29:38,761
and Herschel.

3247
01:29:38,761 --> 01:29:39,320
It's Herman.

3248
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:39,750
Yeah,

3249
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:43,950
that's her ghost who
somebody is working out,

3250
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:44,600
I'll tell you that.

3251
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,460
I mean he obviously does the pushups
and sit ups and everything else too,

3252
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:48,343
the guys and just,

3253
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:49,590
he's just one of those dudes.

3254
01:29:49,591 --> 01:29:50,460
It's just in monster,

3255
01:29:50,461 --> 01:29:51,300
monster shape.

3256
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:55,890
He if he ever gotten a flip or a
into MMA when he got into football.

3257
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:57,120
If it was around back then,

3258
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:59,160
he might've been like an all time great.

3259
01:29:59,400 --> 01:29:59,970
You know,

3260
01:29:59,970 --> 01:30:00,803
because you think,

3261
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:01,800
oh my God,

3262
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:03,210
we haven't really seen that yet.

3263
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,790
We haven't really seen a
guy who was like a soup.

3264
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:07,440
We were seeing it and Jon Jones,

3265
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:08,581
Jon Jones,

3266
01:30:08,581 --> 01:30:09,150
we're seeing it.

3267
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:10,380
But before Jon Jones,

3268
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:15,180
we were never seen like some guy who
just can learn shit really fast and he's

3269
01:30:15,181 --> 01:30:17,550
ridiculously strong and
it seems like he's just,

3270
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:22,240
he just has a advantage over everyone
he faces when Jon Jones Gravelly Yoda

3271
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:24,300
cheat it and that fucking
standing he a teen,

3272
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,900
you know like you just knew Liotta
was not getting out like his,

3273
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,580
his strength,

3274
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:29,911
you know,

3275
01:30:29,911 --> 01:30:31,980
his ability to manipulate bodies.

3276
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:33,750
It's really freaky to watch,

3277
01:30:33,751 --> 01:30:34,320
man.

3278
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,510
He's got like some car I describe it.

3279
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:39,120
It's like he's got like
some crazy aunt strength.

3280
01:30:39,670 --> 01:30:43,050
We see an ant pick things up
effortlessly and picks up a leaf.

3281
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:43,351
And I was like,

3282
01:30:43,351 --> 01:30:43,831
I'm a fuck.

3283
01:30:43,831 --> 01:30:44,201
Is that again,

3284
01:30:44,201 --> 01:30:45,001
just picking up that thing.

3285
01:30:45,001 --> 01:30:46,110
If you look at it in relation to it,

3286
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:46,951
to his body,

3287
01:30:46,951 --> 01:30:47,790
like my God,

3288
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:48,960
I did it like effortlessly.

3289
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:52,680
More impressive to me was his Ryan
Bader fight invaders about us.

3290
01:30:52,681 --> 01:30:55,360
He's a great rest of the
strong base fucks dude.

3291
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:56,550
He just throws it around.

3292
01:30:56,551 --> 01:30:57,300
It was impressive.

3293
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:58,650
Nobody's ever even had him on his back.

3294
01:30:58,651 --> 01:30:58,831
I mean,

3295
01:30:58,831 --> 01:30:59,450
has anybody,

3296
01:30:59,450 --> 01:30:59,960
does everybody,

3297
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,080
have you ever seen him?

3298
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,000
The hit him a couple of times.

3299
01:31:03,001 --> 01:31:03,240
Good.

3300
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:04,770
He does the first time and take a shot.

3301
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:05,430
You can take a shot.

3302
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:06,450
He took some hard shots.

3303
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:07,021
Yeah,

3304
01:31:07,021 --> 01:31:07,531
but you know what?

3305
01:31:07,531 --> 01:31:09,300
How about he figured out Leo striking.

3306
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:10,141
How about that man?

3307
01:31:10,141 --> 01:31:13,260
He had an one tough round and then he
came back in a second round him out,

3308
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:14,130
cracked up,

3309
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:15,240
got him to the ground.

3310
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:15,900
He cracked him.

3311
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,490
The fucking hard elbow or a punt.

3312
01:31:17,491 --> 01:31:17,931
It was a punch.

3313
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:18,770
Her elbows number one.

3314
01:31:18,771 --> 01:31:22,410
The first one was like a left hook I think
is [inaudible] was coming in time and

3315
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:23,490
then got him to the ground,

3316
01:31:23,491 --> 01:31:25,950
smashed him with an elbow and
that was basically all she wrote.

3317
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:27,030
It was one elbow,

3318
01:31:27,031 --> 01:31:28,440
the auto got up and he was dizzy.

3319
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:30,450
I mean he really said he couldn't focus.

3320
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:31,290
He couldn't see well.

3321
01:31:31,291 --> 01:31:32,850
And then John got Ahold of that neck.

3322
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:33,451
You know,

3323
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:37,170
it's like that could be Herschel Walker
could have been like one of those guys.

3324
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:37,650
You know,

3325
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:38,100
he could,

3326
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:38,520
you know,

3327
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:39,600
there are guys out there,

3328
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:40,170
you know,

3329
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:42,740
the human body as we've
talking about reports,

3330
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:43,613
they're not equal.

3331
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,513
They're just not.

3332
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:46,680
And some of them were getting
better and better and better,

3333
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:47,520
you know.

3334
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:48,510
And back in the day,

3335
01:31:48,511 --> 01:31:50,130
someone like John Jones would have,

3336
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:50,491
you know,

3337
01:31:50,491 --> 01:31:52,800
a few thousand babies cause
they should be on some,

3338
01:31:53,070 --> 01:31:53,281
you know,

3339
01:31:53,281 --> 01:31:55,350
the top warrior and some and some,

3340
01:31:55,351 --> 01:31:55,650
uh,

3341
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:56,350
yeah,

3342
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:57,061
rotting fourth.

3343
01:31:57,061 --> 01:31:57,241
You know,

3344
01:31:57,241 --> 01:31:57,690
I read it,

3345
01:31:57,690 --> 01:31:58,441
I read a stat,

3346
01:31:58,441 --> 01:31:59,274
that gang,

3347
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,250
they found

3348
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:05,250
a certain DNA and his y chromosome
and Gaviscon is related to 0.5% of the

3349
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:07,210
world's population.

3350
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:08,250
Holy Shit,

3351
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:08,981
5%.

3352
01:32:08,981 --> 01:32:11,350
It's like 8% of all the Asiatic people,

3353
01:32:11,351 --> 01:32:15,880
but 0.5% of the entire world because of
just the amount of people that he had

3354
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:18,040
sex with and his descendants had sex with.

3355
01:32:18,220 --> 01:32:21,090
Because the cube Lecan then
went into power and he would,

3356
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:21,250
you know,

3357
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:22,750
he ran the Chinese dynasty.

3358
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:24,100
But that kind of effect,

3359
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:24,551
you know,

3360
01:32:24,551 --> 01:32:25,000
we won't,

3361
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,700
we won't ever see anything like that
handling 10% 10% of America will

3362
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:30,850
Chamberlain's DNA.

3363
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:32,411
It's crazy.

3364
01:32:32,411 --> 01:32:35,050
But there was something to be sending
people decent Gingiss count fucked.

3365
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:36,520
And he didn't even have viagara back then.

3366
01:32:39,440 --> 01:32:40,260
He was dead.

3367
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:40,750
He was,

3368
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:42,100
he was planning inside.

3369
01:32:42,101 --> 01:32:42,151
He,

3370
01:32:42,151 --> 01:32:42,301
I mean,

3371
01:32:42,301 --> 01:32:44,260
he was trying to have panguses,

3372
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:44,560
you know,

3373
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,460
and then there was no
pulling out for Gaviscon.

3374
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,433
Yeah,

3375
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:48,191
yeah.

3376
01:32:48,191 --> 01:32:50,020
He must've just shot loads and it all day.

3377
01:32:50,021 --> 01:32:52,660
All this amazing that that's
how people rolled back then.

3378
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:54,580
They just made as many kids as they could.

3379
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:54,780
Yeah.

3380
01:32:54,780 --> 01:32:54,970
Well,

3381
01:32:54,970 --> 01:32:55,151
I mean,

3382
01:32:55,151 --> 01:32:55,871
not everybody,

3383
01:32:55,871 --> 01:32:56,290
but gangs,

3384
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:56,650
Kong,

3385
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:57,483
his boys.

3386
01:32:57,490 --> 01:32:57,731
Well,

3387
01:32:57,731 --> 01:32:57,990
you know,

3388
01:32:57,990 --> 01:32:58,661
just assuming,

3389
01:32:58,661 --> 01:32:59,200
right.

3390
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,100
We just fucking,

3391
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:00,371
this is,

3392
01:33:00,371 --> 01:33:04,840
might be slanders pussies must be so
disgusting at the DNA test for Ganga

3393
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:05,651
[inaudible] in particular,

3394
01:33:05,651 --> 01:33:06,850
but it probably didn't smell good.

3395
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:08,350
But I think,

3396
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:11,200
I think there's something to be said
for that kind of phenomenon because

3397
01:33:11,201 --> 01:33:12,730
nowadays the best,

3398
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:13,001
I mean,

3399
01:33:13,001 --> 01:33:13,290
gangs,

3400
01:33:13,290 --> 01:33:14,590
Khan was not only physically,

3401
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:15,673
you know,

3402
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:18,940
unbeatable as he rose up to
the tribes and the Mongol,

3403
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:19,241
you know,

3404
01:33:19,241 --> 01:33:20,400
step in the plateau.

3405
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:21,280
Nobody could defeat him.

3406
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,450
He won all his tribal battles.

3407
01:33:22,451 --> 01:33:24,520
But then as a military mastermind,

3408
01:33:24,521 --> 01:33:26,020
he was brilliant as far as what he did.

3409
01:33:26,021 --> 01:33:28,810
Kind of revolutionized a lot
of the theories of warfare.

3410
01:33:28,811 --> 01:33:30,190
So very intelligent,

3411
01:33:30,191 --> 01:33:31,450
very physically capable.

3412
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:33,130
And by his,

3413
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:33,730
you know,

3414
01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:34,900
sexual encounters,

3415
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:36,070
at least the genetics part.

3416
01:33:36,071 --> 01:33:38,740
I mean fatherhood was a whole
other issue and you know,

3417
01:33:38,741 --> 01:33:40,480
the humanity involved in all the ratio.

3418
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:41,860
Here's a great part as far as,

3419
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:45,610
as far as genetically,

3420
01:33:45,611 --> 01:33:49,030
and this is how strip clubs
were genetically advancing.

3421
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:49,930
You know,

3422
01:33:49,930 --> 01:33:53,290
the genetic race probably played
some positive part in that.

3423
01:33:53,291 --> 01:33:54,520
And that'll never happen again.

3424
01:33:54,521 --> 01:33:56,320
Like the geniuses of our world,

3425
01:33:56,470 --> 01:34:00,460
like the most amazing people who
could genetically speaking purely,

3426
01:34:00,790 --> 01:34:01,061
you know,

3427
01:34:01,061 --> 01:34:02,110
advance the human race.

3428
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,030
They're not having a
thousand babies anymore.

3429
01:34:04,031 --> 01:34:06,640
They're not even having 10
they're having one or two,

3430
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:07,151
you know.

3431
01:34:07,151 --> 01:34:11,350
But really probably what would be
beneficial would be if they had tons of

3432
01:34:11,351 --> 01:34:11,770
babies.

3433
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:11,951
I mean,

3434
01:34:11,951 --> 01:34:14,020
that would really actually
further the human rights.

3435
01:34:14,021 --> 01:34:18,430
That's what the principal of sexual
selection as it happens in the animal

3436
01:34:18,431 --> 01:34:19,000
kingdom,

3437
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:19,870
that's how it works.

3438
01:34:19,871 --> 01:34:20,321
The biggest,

3439
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:20,771
smartest,

3440
01:34:20,771 --> 01:34:22,780
baddest line has the most babies.

3441
01:34:22,781 --> 01:34:23,021
You know?

3442
01:34:23,021 --> 01:34:27,250
It doesn't happen in man that as we
approach some sort of a symbiotic

3443
01:34:27,251 --> 01:34:29,620
relationship with
computers and technology,

3444
01:34:29,621 --> 01:34:30,730
that's inescapable.

3445
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:33,550
The power of the physical
becomes less important.

3446
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:34,663
Sure.

3447
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:36,260
It should be the smartest person,

3448
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:37,270
the smartest people,

3449
01:34:37,310 --> 01:34:40,450
but have to get that puts the people
who have the power now aren't the

3450
01:34:40,451 --> 01:34:41,440
physically strongest.

3451
01:34:41,441 --> 01:34:42,251
They're the smartest.

3452
01:34:42,251 --> 01:34:43,084
They get the money,

3453
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:43,590
the money.

3454
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:45,210
You got to listen to Albert.

3455
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:45,401
Gina,

3456
01:34:45,401 --> 01:34:46,550
you get first you get the money,

3457
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:47,291
then you have the power.

3458
01:34:47,291 --> 01:34:48,124
Then you get the women.

3459
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:49,100
He didn't say women.

3460
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:49,661
He said pussy,

3461
01:34:49,661 --> 01:34:50,494
Bro.

3462
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:52,870
Don't ever clean it up by the foot.

3463
01:34:52,871 --> 01:34:53,704
You'll get the money.

3464
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:54,910
Then you'll get the power.

3465
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:56,140
Then you'll get the post.

3466
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:56,731
Well,

3467
01:34:56,731 --> 01:34:57,531
maybe he was at Scarface.

3468
01:34:57,531 --> 01:34:58,130
Scarface.

3469
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:00,560
Did he say you get the posing
or women can't remember?

3470
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:00,731
I've,

3471
01:35:00,731 --> 01:35:03,680
I've only seen that once and I have
never seen it usually like watching the

3472
01:35:03,681 --> 01:35:04,630
Italian movies.

3473
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:06,270
Did you say Italian movies?

3474
01:35:06,271 --> 01:35:06,440
Yeah,

3475
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,450
I don't really like the
Italian movies too much,

3476
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:09,403
Brian.

3477
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,311
Oh,

3478
01:35:10,311 --> 01:35:11,240
Brian.

3479
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:12,290
Um,

3480
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:12,620
yeah.

3481
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:16,340
Obviously the smart people are not
getting to breathe at the same rate as

3482
01:35:16,341 --> 01:35:17,210
Gingiss Kahn did,

3483
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:18,710
but um,

3484
01:35:18,740 --> 01:35:22,400
I think people in general are just
much smarter and much more aware,

3485
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,170
much more in tune than,

3486
01:35:24,171 --> 01:35:25,004
than ever before.

3487
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:25,701
But as far as like,

3488
01:35:25,701 --> 01:35:25,911
yeah,

3489
01:35:25,911 --> 01:35:26,990
like Super Geniuses,

3490
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:27,531
the rain,

3491
01:35:27,531 --> 01:35:30,410
the biological race over
the technological race,

3492
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:34,610
it seems to me the technological is so
fucking far ahead of the biological that

3493
01:35:34,611 --> 01:35:38,150
it's almost ridiculous to assume that
the biological is ever going to catch up,

3494
01:35:38,151 --> 01:35:39,710
whether it's through
natural selection or not.

3495
01:35:39,890 --> 01:35:44,210
It just seems like technology in the
short amount of time that it's been around

3496
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:47,630
has achieved so much momentum
and so much innovation.

3497
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:52,630
It's gone so many generations and models
greater than what it was when it was

3498
01:35:52,641 --> 01:35:55,940
first introduced that it seems like
inevitable that that's going to be the big

3499
01:35:55,941 --> 01:35:56,421
tip off.

3500
01:35:56,421 --> 01:36:00,230
It's going to be a
technological innovation sort
of a thing that that changes

3501
01:36:00,231 --> 01:36:03,650
everything and that the idea that the
human body is going to like get good

3502
01:36:03,651 --> 01:36:04,790
enough to catch up to that.

3503
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:05,930
I think that's ridiculous.

3504
01:36:05,931 --> 01:36:08,780
I think what's going to happen is there's
going to be some sort of a large scale

3505
01:36:08,781 --> 01:36:10,730
genetic engineering of the human body.

3506
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:11,420
We're too late,

3507
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:12,370
we're too late for the,

3508
01:36:12,530 --> 01:36:13,550
we're going to be super people,

3509
01:36:13,551 --> 01:36:13,910
Bro.

3510
01:36:13,910 --> 01:36:14,630
We're going to be,

3511
01:36:14,630 --> 01:36:15,560
we're going to be Thor,

3512
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:15,891
you know,

3513
01:36:15,891 --> 01:36:16,400
we're gonna have,

3514
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,950
we're gonna have the ability to fly.

3515
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:18,920
And that's creating,

3516
01:36:18,921 --> 01:36:22,970
I mean a lot of this technology's
moved by genius people,

3517
01:36:22,971 --> 01:36:25,550
outliers for a lot of the
time and we're also not,

3518
01:36:25,551 --> 01:36:25,890
we're,

3519
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:30,770
we're closing down the possibilities for
the genius to genius mating that would

3520
01:36:30,771 --> 01:36:32,000
naturally occur to create.

3521
01:36:32,210 --> 01:36:35,510
That's okay cause a genius can just shoot
a load into a cup and make a million

3522
01:36:35,511 --> 01:36:36,410
new people from it.

3523
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:38,290
I mean I think that's true.

3524
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:42,740
Maybe then when we figured out
how the body is actually created,

3525
01:36:42,741 --> 01:36:44,390
how organs are created,

3526
01:36:44,391 --> 01:36:46,430
and we've figured out the
ability to replicate them,

3527
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:48,620
we're going to be able to figure
out the way to make a super body,

3528
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:49,191
you know,

3529
01:36:49,191 --> 01:36:53,390
and whether it's through some sort of a
genetic manipulation to a person that is

3530
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:55,400
already exist in a certain form,

3531
01:36:55,401 --> 01:36:56,810
like in fucking captain America.

3532
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:59,900
When they lock them into that tube and
he's Zap him with all that blue shit and

3533
01:36:59,901 --> 01:37:00,770
then boom,

3534
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:02,330
he comes out of super person.

3535
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:03,230
I mean that's,

3536
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:04,940
that's not too far away.

3537
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:06,500
Don't you think?

3538
01:37:06,501 --> 01:37:11,450
That seems to me like it would be way
easier to do then it would be to send

3539
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:16,451
picture through the air and have it go
to someone else in Australia or China or

3540
01:37:16,941 --> 01:37:17,570
something like that.

3541
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:21,260
That seems to me way more impossible.

3542
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:24,080
Then you can improve a biological unit.

3543
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,370
We understand sells,

3544
01:37:25,371 --> 01:37:26,510
we understand cell division,

3545
01:37:26,511 --> 01:37:28,800
we understand the my mitochondria,

3546
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:31,250
the power plants of the cells.

3547
01:37:31,251 --> 01:37:32,420
We understand genetics.

3548
01:37:32,421 --> 01:37:34,160
We sort of mapped out the human genome,

3549
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:37,150
our understanding increases and
that we shouldn't say our cause.

3550
01:37:37,151 --> 01:37:38,660
It's people far smarter than you or I,

3551
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:40,040
but those people,

3552
01:37:40,041 --> 01:37:40,371
the people,

3553
01:37:40,371 --> 01:37:40,850
the head of it,

3554
01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:43,730
their understanding
increases every single year.

3555
01:37:43,850 --> 01:37:45,050
Their data grows,

3556
01:37:45,051 --> 01:37:46,310
their abilities grow.

3557
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:47,930
It's going to reach some point.

3558
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:48,801
Really,

3559
01:37:48,801 --> 01:37:51,920
it seems obvious that in the future it's
going to reach some point where they're

3560
01:37:51,921 --> 01:37:53,900
going to be able to make
a fucking superhuman.

3561
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:58,500
Well then the moral spiritual implications
as far as whether that's a good thing

3562
01:37:58,501 --> 01:38:00,420
or a not a good thing come into play.

3563
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:00,811
Yeah.

3564
01:38:00,811 --> 01:38:03,180
It's like who the saw
movies of exploring what is,

3565
01:38:03,181 --> 01:38:04,980
why is there a good thing at all?

3566
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:06,480
Why is there a bad thing?

3567
01:38:06,481 --> 01:38:06,710
Why?

3568
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:09,540
Why does the universe have
that even as an option?

3569
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:10,021
Well,

3570
01:38:10,021 --> 01:38:12,180
it seems to be that you
have to have it in order to,

3571
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,310
to inspire movement.

3572
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,920
It's almost like you
have to have tyranny to,

3573
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,930
to really come up with freedom.

3574
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:19,831
You have to like,

3575
01:38:19,831 --> 01:38:20,071
you know,

3576
01:38:20,071 --> 01:38:21,900
you have to have people pushing you down.

3577
01:38:21,901 --> 01:38:23,070
Resistance from the opposite.

3578
01:38:23,071 --> 01:38:23,580
Yeah.

3579
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:24,030
Yeah,

3580
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:24,750
exactly.

3581
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:25,170
I mean it's,

3582
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:26,003
it seems,

3583
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,530
why else would the universe have evil?

3584
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:30,270
I mean all this stuff that exists,

3585
01:38:30,271 --> 01:38:31,260
terrible feelings,

3586
01:38:31,261 --> 01:38:31,891
horrible things.

3587
01:38:31,891 --> 01:38:32,850
You see atrocities.

3588
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:35,610
The guy in Brooklyn who lit the
woman on fire and the elevator.

3589
01:38:35,611 --> 01:38:35,881
Why?

3590
01:38:35,881 --> 01:38:37,160
Why do these even exist?

3591
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:40,140
Why does the universe
have this as an option?

3592
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:45,260
If this does seem to be some sort of
a mechanism or a program that's moving

3593
01:38:45,481 --> 01:38:49,260
towards a very specific
and idea or a goal,

3594
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:51,020
something specific is going to,

3595
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:52,320
there's something going on.

3596
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:55,740
There's a process that the human beings
involved in just like bees making a

3597
01:38:55,741 --> 01:38:56,251
beehive.

3598
01:38:56,251 --> 01:38:59,940
There's were involved in some
really super complicated process.

3599
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:01,090
I think that,

3600
01:39:01,090 --> 01:39:01,980
I agree with that,

3601
01:39:01,981 --> 01:39:02,910
but I think that there's,

3602
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:03,661
you know,

3603
01:39:03,661 --> 01:39:06,210
that's kind of looking at it kind
of a linear curve of progress.

3604
01:39:06,211 --> 01:39:09,360
And I think there's some things missing
from our evolution and I think our

3605
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:11,340
spiritual base has gotten thrown way off.

3606
01:39:11,341 --> 01:39:14,340
And I don't know if that's just the
bottom of the religions or think it's

3607
01:39:14,341 --> 01:39:15,750
possible that that's natural.

3608
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:18,310
Do you think it's possible that this,

3609
01:39:18,311 --> 01:39:18,470
uh,

3610
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:22,290
this lack of a connection
to the spiritual,

3611
01:39:22,291 --> 01:39:27,291
it was almost necessary to create this
technological fucking bizarro world that

3612
01:39:28,891 --> 01:39:29,340
we live,

3613
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:33,750
we live in with no conscience and no
thinking about the future and no planning.

3614
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:36,090
It's almost like you need a disconnect.

3615
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:38,880
In order for this thing to
arise out of the human animal,

3616
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,720
we need to become some sort
of a technological zombie
that just creates and goes

3617
01:39:42,721 --> 01:39:43,920
forth and does its bidding.

3618
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:45,540
Does the bidding of the technology,

3619
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:47,190
much like those fucking mushrooms,

3620
01:39:47,191 --> 01:39:49,680
I think it's a quarter Samsung washer
and it gets inside the fucking ants head

3621
01:39:49,681 --> 01:39:51,420
and makes them bloat and the moth.

3622
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:52,310
Yeah.

3623
01:39:52,310 --> 01:39:52,831
Well it does it.

3624
01:39:52,831 --> 01:39:53,461
The ants too,

3625
01:39:53,461 --> 01:39:53,761
right?

3626
01:39:53,761 --> 01:39:54,800
Isn't there a fungus that grows it?

3627
01:39:54,860 --> 01:39:55,693
I've seen.

3628
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:57,570
I mean that's really what it's like.

3629
01:39:57,571 --> 01:39:58,320
It's like we are,

3630
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,210
we were infected with technology.

3631
01:40:00,510 --> 01:40:03,620
It's almost like technology
is what's keeping us from,

3632
01:40:03,650 --> 01:40:08,280
from recognizing all these other spiritual
realms and keeping us pushing forth

3633
01:40:08,281 --> 01:40:09,031
in a certain direction.

3634
01:40:09,031 --> 01:40:11,610
Because if you think about it
without any technology whatsoever,

3635
01:40:11,611 --> 01:40:13,020
they would never be
able to stop mushrooms.

3636
01:40:13,021 --> 01:40:13,831
They would never be able to stop,

3637
01:40:13,831 --> 01:40:14,101
pause.

3638
01:40:14,101 --> 01:40:15,510
They wouldn't know
anything where anything is.

3639
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:16,590
They wouldn't be able to rescue.

3640
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:17,820
They wouldn't be able to put you in jail.

3641
01:40:17,821 --> 01:40:18,930
They wouldn't be able to make laws.

3642
01:40:19,110 --> 01:40:19,740
They wouldn't be able to,

3643
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:20,040
you know,

3644
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:20,680
communicate.

3645
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:22,110
It wouldn't have the news,

3646
01:40:22,111 --> 01:40:22,890
they wouldn't have,

3647
01:40:22,890 --> 01:40:23,723
there would be nothing,

3648
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:24,511
there'd be nothing.

3649
01:40:24,511 --> 01:40:25,830
So it would be impossible.

3650
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:29,850
So technology allows people
to be suppressed as much
as it gives them freedom

3651
01:40:30,030 --> 01:40:35,030
and also allows people to be suppressed
and stay zombies and keep on the task.

3652
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:36,900
Keep on the task.

3653
01:40:37,140 --> 01:40:37,621
I wonder,

3654
01:40:37,621 --> 01:40:37,831
man,

3655
01:40:37,831 --> 01:40:38,041
I mean,

3656
01:40:38,041 --> 01:40:39,210
everything else is natural.

3657
01:40:39,211 --> 01:40:40,140
We look at wolves,

3658
01:40:40,350 --> 01:40:43,800
wolves is whatever fucked up thing they
do where they push the Beta male out and

3659
01:40:43,801 --> 01:40:44,850
he's going to starve to death.

3660
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:45,361
We look at,

3661
01:40:45,361 --> 01:40:46,051
it's horrible,

3662
01:40:46,051 --> 01:40:49,500
but we also know that it's natural and
it happens over and over and over and

3663
01:40:49,501 --> 01:40:50,220
over again.

3664
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:53,860
And then there's of course a bunch of
different scenarios that can take place.

3665
01:40:53,861 --> 01:40:54,010
There's

3666
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,480
a lot of different things that can happen,

3667
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,840
but ultimately they're moving in the
same sort of a natural direction every

3668
01:40:58,841 --> 01:40:59,590
time.

3669
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:03,370
How did we not know that our lives
are not exactly the same way,

3670
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:07,630
just far more complex and
intertwined and we're aware of it.

3671
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:10,570
So it gives us this illusion
that somehow or another,

3672
01:41:10,571 --> 01:41:12,940
this is just a random series of events.

3673
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:13,881
Yeah,

3674
01:41:13,881 --> 01:41:14,690
I mean,

3675
01:41:14,690 --> 01:41:15,070
you know,

3676
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:15,920
obviously that's,

3677
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:17,270
that's certainly a possibility,

3678
01:41:17,271 --> 01:41:21,500
but I think that I do strongly believe
that there were certain situations in

3679
01:41:21,501 --> 01:41:26,060
which key people in the wrong moments
and key movements in society kind of

3680
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:29,840
debilitated this natural spiritual
flourishing that should have grown in

3681
01:41:29,841 --> 01:41:31,340
conjunction with the technology.

3682
01:41:31,370 --> 01:41:34,340
Maybe technology was always
destined to out pace it a little bit

3683
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,660
job to eliminate people.

3684
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:37,680
Maybe that's why you're here.

3685
01:41:37,681 --> 01:41:38,520
You ever thought about that?

3686
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:39,271
Like this,

3687
01:41:39,271 --> 01:41:42,990
this conversation is getting heard
about hundreds of thousands of small,

3688
01:41:42,991 --> 01:41:43,410
humble,

3689
01:41:43,410 --> 01:41:45,090
like a little tiny spark,

3690
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:45,931
a little little,

3691
01:41:45,931 --> 01:41:46,380
little,

3692
01:41:46,380 --> 01:41:48,960
little hot shoe that
gets into the fucking,

3693
01:41:49,230 --> 01:41:50,970
the blood screens dream of the world,

3694
01:41:50,971 --> 01:41:52,920
a little little virus
that spreads out there.

3695
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:55,110
I think that is part of the
Movement for change right now.

3696
01:41:55,111 --> 01:41:58,590
I think we're out of balance as
a society and I think as a world,

3697
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:00,830
and I think we had to get back into it,

3698
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:03,780
probably our indignation is natural.

3699
01:42:03,810 --> 01:42:05,310
All the reaction is natural.

3700
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,050
Me In a Ron Paul shirt is natural.

3701
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:08,680
It's all natural.

3702
01:42:08,680 --> 01:42:08,880
It's,

3703
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:13,050
it's a push into a certain direction
and then that's the natural mode,

3704
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:14,213
you know,

3705
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:15,090
of response.

3706
01:42:15,091 --> 01:42:15,924
It's what's supposed to do.

3707
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:17,640
And I think it has to happen.

3708
01:42:17,641 --> 01:42:18,210
I mean,

3709
01:42:18,210 --> 01:42:19,620
a lot of laws have to change.

3710
01:42:19,621 --> 01:42:20,490
Things have to be dropped.

3711
01:42:20,491 --> 01:42:20,671
I mean,

3712
01:42:20,671 --> 01:42:22,170
we have shortcuts to get there.

3713
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:23,280
That's the fucked up thing.

3714
01:42:23,281 --> 01:42:25,860
And these shortcuts grow
naturally all over the,

3715
01:42:25,950 --> 01:42:26,850
all over the world.

3716
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:28,860
And there just happened to be illegal.

3717
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:29,701
And uh,

3718
01:42:29,701 --> 01:42:32,820
we gotta we gotta change that and we got
to give people the shortcuts but also

3719
01:42:32,821 --> 01:42:34,020
the foundation behind it.

3720
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:34,411
I mean,

3721
01:42:34,411 --> 01:42:35,460
having somebody just saying,

3722
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:35,881
yeah,

3723
01:42:35,881 --> 01:42:36,541
take mushrooms,

3724
01:42:36,541 --> 01:42:37,111
go willy nilly.

3725
01:42:37,111 --> 01:42:40,020
It's like telling someone to go
into the deep jungle and not saying,

3726
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:40,331
hey,

3727
01:42:40,331 --> 01:42:40,680
you got,

3728
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:41,910
you got to bring mosquito repellent.

3729
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:43,210
You got to bring this to sign.

3730
01:42:43,230 --> 01:42:44,520
Here's some scuba equipment.

3731
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:47,160
[inaudible] good idea either.

3732
01:42:47,161 --> 01:42:47,401
I mean,

3733
01:42:47,401 --> 01:42:48,360
you still have to,

3734
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:51,150
there's these structures in place and
the Shamans of had it figured out,

3735
01:42:51,151 --> 01:42:55,590
it's thousands of years of lineage of
teaching and how to explore these realms.

3736
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:56,241
Like you say,

3737
01:42:56,241 --> 01:42:57,870
it's scuba gear is the perfect analogy.

3738
01:42:58,030 --> 01:42:58,260
You know,

3739
01:42:58,260 --> 01:43:01,740
don't go deep water diving unless
you know exactly what you're doing.

3740
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:02,730
But if you do,

3741
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:03,031
you know,

3742
01:43:03,031 --> 01:43:06,600
you can get to these realms that
give you direct access to God.

3743
01:43:06,601 --> 01:43:09,540
And the reason why religions
have pushed against that,

3744
01:43:09,541 --> 01:43:12,360
if you have direct access
to the all to the universe,

3745
01:43:12,361 --> 01:43:12,721
to God,

3746
01:43:12,721 --> 01:43:13,920
whatever name you want to put on it,

3747
01:43:14,250 --> 01:43:15,870
then you don't need the priests.

3748
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:16,960
And if you don't need the priests,

3749
01:43:16,961 --> 01:43:17,794
they have no power.

3750
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:18,301
You know?

3751
01:43:18,301 --> 01:43:22,590
So all of these religions came up putting
intermediaries in place so that they

3752
01:43:22,591 --> 01:43:25,830
could develop these massive power
structures using guilt and different

3753
01:43:25,831 --> 01:43:27,630
mechanisms to control the people.

3754
01:43:27,900 --> 01:43:28,733
And it's a,

3755
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:32,070
I think we got off course and
now here's a chance to correct.

3756
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:32,421
Well,

3757
01:43:32,421 --> 01:43:35,840
that was John Marco Legros thoughts for
the whole creation of the Bible in the

3758
01:43:35,841 --> 01:43:36,441
first place.

3759
01:43:36,441 --> 01:43:40,760
That it's suppression of information
that the original stories were hidden in

3760
01:43:40,761 --> 01:43:41,001
these,

3761
01:43:41,001 --> 01:43:41,301
you know,

3762
01:43:41,301 --> 01:43:41,930
these,

3763
01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:46,910
these a little tails in the Bible
with all these little hidden clues,

3764
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:49,460
but that really was all about
was psychedelic mushrooms.

3765
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:52,250
That these people were just
trying preserve this information

3766
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:53,630
when they were captured by the Romans.

3767
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:55,610
It's fascinating if that is the,

3768
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:55,951
the,

3769
01:43:55,951 --> 01:43:56,290
the,

3770
01:43:56,290 --> 01:43:57,530
the root of it all.

3771
01:43:57,670 --> 01:43:58,130
Yeah,

3772
01:43:58,130 --> 01:43:58,821
the root of it all.

3773
01:43:58,821 --> 01:44:02,810
Just a few people trying to keep this
experience connection to something else

3774
01:44:02,811 --> 01:44:03,320
going,

3775
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,430
whether it's real or not,

3776
01:44:04,431 --> 01:44:05,720
whether it's real or imagined.

3777
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:06,680
Like I said,

3778
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:08,390
Christianity may maybe not real,

3779
01:44:08,391 --> 01:44:09,950
but fucking helps you for sure.

3780
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:10,341
Well,

3781
01:44:10,341 --> 01:44:11,210
something's going on.

3782
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:11,700
If something,

3783
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:14,450
if it's fake and yet it still helps.

3784
01:44:14,451 --> 01:44:16,520
I know a lot of people believe it or not,

3785
01:44:16,521 --> 01:44:19,250
they believe and because they
believe they become better,

3786
01:44:19,251 --> 01:44:20,450
their lives have been enriched.

3787
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:22,340
So that's an effective tool,

3788
01:44:22,470 --> 01:44:23,030
you know?

3789
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:23,510
Sure.

3790
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:23,811
Well,

3791
01:44:23,811 --> 01:44:24,081
I mean,

3792
01:44:24,081 --> 01:44:25,190
you also have to think,

3793
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:25,611
you know,

3794
01:44:25,611 --> 01:44:28,790
obviously there needs to be a place
for that and Christianity can fill it,

3795
01:44:28,791 --> 01:44:31,130
but is it the best tool to fill that?

3796
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:32,773
Well,

3797
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:36,530
that's the difference between like,

3798
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:36,861
you know,

3799
01:44:36,861 --> 01:44:37,880
a lot of people say like,

3800
01:44:37,881 --> 01:44:39,020
why would you,

3801
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:42,890
why would you talk bad
about someone's ideas,

3802
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:43,160
uh,

3803
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:44,270
when it comes to like Christianity,

3804
01:44:44,271 --> 01:44:47,000
but yet you espoused all these
ridiculous ideas when it comes to drugs.

3805
01:44:47,480 --> 01:44:48,080
Well,

3806
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:48,913
first of all,

3807
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:50,570
it's not all drugs,

3808
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:51,530
it's psychedelics.

3809
01:44:51,531 --> 01:44:52,364
And second of all,

3810
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:53,233
just try one.

3811
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:56,540
Just take a deep mushroom trip and
tell him we've got something going on.

3812
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:00,290
It's really one of those things
where it's a repeatable experience.

3813
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:01,131
You know,

3814
01:45:01,131 --> 01:45:02,060
anyone can do it.

3815
01:45:02,061 --> 01:45:02,810
You really can.

3816
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:05,810
And then you'll understand what the fuss
is all about because it's not as simple

3817
01:45:05,811 --> 01:45:06,860
as a hallucination.

3818
01:45:06,861 --> 01:45:07,694
It's not,

3819
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:08,031
you know,

3820
01:45:08,031 --> 01:45:08,630
there is,

3821
01:45:08,630 --> 01:45:11,870
there's definitely some
perturbing of your visual senses.

3822
01:45:11,871 --> 01:45:13,580
There's your perceptions of the world,

3823
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:15,800
but then there's also a voice and others,

3824
01:45:15,801 --> 01:45:19,910
our conversation with something that
seems outer worldly that's communicating

3825
01:45:19,911 --> 01:45:22,640
with you and some sort
of a telepathic way.

3826
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:27,050
And there's always a deep insight into
how your life works and a really clear

3827
01:45:27,051 --> 01:45:29,870
illumination of all the issues
that you've got going on,

3828
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:32,760
which is like why would
there be an inexperience?

3829
01:45:32,930 --> 01:45:36,440
It's both humbling and
enlightening and guiding and why?

3830
01:45:36,441 --> 01:45:37,550
Why would there be that?

3831
01:45:37,610 --> 01:45:39,980
And is it just in your imagination,

3832
01:45:40,190 --> 01:45:40,430
you know,

3833
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:41,061
is it really,

3834
01:45:41,061 --> 01:45:42,110
is it that simple?

3835
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:43,970
Is it that sample or is it,

3836
01:45:44,090 --> 01:45:45,730
is this how a life form community?

3837
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:46,191
I mean,

3838
01:45:46,191 --> 01:45:47,240
there's two ways to look at it.

3839
01:45:47,241 --> 01:45:47,451
Yeah,

3840
01:45:47,451 --> 01:45:49,250
there's the what is
actually happening away.

3841
01:45:49,251 --> 01:45:50,900
But then there's the simple pragmatic,

3842
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:51,530
you know,

3843
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:53,840
effect of how it affects
people who take it.

3844
01:45:53,841 --> 01:45:57,320
And overwhelmingly the people who have
taken these in the right with the right

3845
01:45:57,321 --> 01:46:01,430
intent and the right setting have these
mystical experiences that change their

3846
01:46:01,431 --> 01:46:02,360
life for the positive.

3847
01:46:02,361 --> 01:46:04,640
So whatever you're
accessing pragmatically,

3848
01:46:04,641 --> 01:46:05,750
it's a positive benefit.

3849
01:46:05,751 --> 01:46:07,910
It feels this void defined the mystic,

3850
01:46:07,930 --> 01:46:08,091
you know,

3851
01:46:08,091 --> 01:46:11,540
obviously it myself and you believe that
there is something else out there that

3852
01:46:11,541 --> 01:46:12,630
you're accessing for sure.

3853
01:46:12,631 --> 01:46:13,910
And the traditions do as well.

3854
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:14,601
But either way,

3855
01:46:14,601 --> 01:46:17,030
just on a purely pragmatic approach,

3856
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:20,690
it's having positive benefits
on positive studyable.

3857
01:46:20,691 --> 01:46:22,670
The Johns Hopkins University did the,

3858
01:46:22,671 --> 01:46:22,921
you know,

3859
01:46:22,921 --> 01:46:25,000
the recent magic mushrooms study,

3860
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:27,410
they did improve long
term psychological health.

3861
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:28,221
I mean this is,

3862
01:46:28,221 --> 01:46:28,461
you know,

3863
01:46:28,461 --> 01:46:29,660
it's a legit university.

3864
01:46:29,661 --> 01:46:32,000
They're coming to this conclusion
after doing tests on people.

3865
01:46:32,150 --> 01:46:34,280
The point there is they say
they found a sweet spot.

3866
01:46:34,281 --> 01:46:37,880
We can optimize the positive persistent
effects and avoid some of the fear and

3867
01:46:37,881 --> 01:46:40,700
anxiety that can occur
and be quite disruptive.

3868
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,770
Says Lead Author Roland Griffiths,

3869
01:46:42,771 --> 01:46:45,290
professor of behavioral
biology at Hopkins.

3870
01:46:45,380 --> 01:46:48,380
So what he's essentially saying
is what everyone's been saying.

3871
01:46:48,381 --> 01:46:49,460
You need a Sharman.

3872
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:53,130
Sharman doesn't just like throw
you out into the fucking woods,

3873
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:56,790
but gives you the correct dose
and allows you to achieve this,

3874
01:46:56,791 --> 01:46:58,320
this state of oneness.

3875
01:46:58,470 --> 01:46:58,651
You know,

3876
01:46:58,651 --> 01:46:59,371
that whatever it is,

3877
01:46:59,371 --> 01:46:59,731
a state,

3878
01:46:59,731 --> 01:47:00,810
let's just call it bliss.

3879
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:02,550
So we take out all the woo woo,

3880
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:03,181
let's take,

3881
01:47:03,181 --> 01:47:07,830
let's just call this state of an enhanced
experience that is a s a psychedelic

3882
01:47:07,831 --> 01:47:08,371
bliss,

3883
01:47:08,371 --> 01:47:12,990
bliss mixed with self reflection and
critical hands and Aaron's very fair,

3884
01:47:13,050 --> 01:47:13,621
very fair,

3885
01:47:13,621 --> 01:47:14,550
honest and,

3886
01:47:14,551 --> 01:47:14,841
and uh,

3887
01:47:14,841 --> 01:47:16,020
uncomfortable at times.

3888
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:16,340
Sure.

3889
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:16,620
You know,

3890
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:19,910
and that's a hallmark of all psychedelic
experiences that this is the,

3891
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:22,590
the personal reflection
in eating marijuana.

3892
01:47:22,591 --> 01:47:22,821
He didn't.

3893
01:47:22,821 --> 01:47:25,350
Marijuana is one of the most personal
reflecting things you can do.

3894
01:47:25,470 --> 01:47:26,760
That's why a lot of people hate it.

3895
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:27,180
You know,

3896
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:30,360
they hate when they go too deep when they
fuck up and eat a Brownie and like you

3897
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:34,020
bitch and then they sit down and freak
out about the fucking world as much as

3898
01:47:34,021 --> 01:47:35,940
you think you are looking
at the whole thing.

3899
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,160
I bet you're not looking at
it all because you can't,

3900
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:42,810
in order to get in your fucking car and
get on the four oh five every day and

3901
01:47:42,811 --> 01:47:44,460
drive into downtown La.

3902
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:47,280
The only way you can do that
every day as if you compartment,

3903
01:47:47,610 --> 01:47:49,020
compartmentalize your thinking.

3904
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:50,130
And if you're,

3905
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:51,440
if you're thinking about the,

3906
01:47:51,441 --> 01:47:53,430
the very structure of the universe,

3907
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:54,930
you thinking about you,

3908
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:57,090
you get subatomic particles,

3909
01:47:57,091 --> 01:47:59,800
you start thinking about
waves and string theory and,

3910
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:05,160
and craziness and what is cells and
biology and the different organisms that

3911
01:48:05,461 --> 01:48:10,461
live in your body and the healthy bacteria
consume and yogurt and fucking acid

3912
01:48:10,471 --> 01:48:11,211
off the list.

3913
01:48:11,211 --> 01:48:11,670
And like,

3914
01:48:11,670 --> 01:48:12,930
what's going on here?

3915
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,070
What do you can't?

3916
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:15,270
There's not enough room for that,

3917
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:15,690
right?

3918
01:48:15,690 --> 01:48:17,010
You can't process all that shit.

3919
01:48:17,011 --> 01:48:18,450
So you got to put your blinders on,

3920
01:48:18,690 --> 01:48:19,860
but then they eat that browning.

3921
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:23,190
It all just blast into focus.

3922
01:48:23,191 --> 01:48:23,700
You know,

3923
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:26,100
it feel your heartbeat seems weird.

3924
01:48:26,740 --> 01:48:27,720
It seems tired.

3925
01:48:29,370 --> 01:48:30,220
The best analogy,

3926
01:48:30,221 --> 01:48:30,291
right?

3927
01:48:30,291 --> 01:48:30,390
The

3928
01:48:30,390 --> 01:48:31,890
best analogy I heard was that,

3929
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:32,220
you know,

3930
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:34,710
taking psychedelics is like
a banquet for the spirit.

3931
01:48:34,711 --> 01:48:34,891
You know,

3932
01:48:34,891 --> 01:48:36,150
it takes a while to prepare,

3933
01:48:36,151 --> 01:48:36,631
takes a lot.

3934
01:48:36,631 --> 01:48:37,500
It's very rich.

3935
01:48:37,501 --> 01:48:39,000
Take some time to digest.

3936
01:48:39,210 --> 01:48:40,350
You can't do that every day.

3937
01:48:40,351 --> 01:48:41,430
But you know,

3938
01:48:41,580 --> 01:48:42,660
and what fills the void,

3939
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:43,080
you know,

3940
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:46,320
eating dinner in this analogy is
meditation and just doing a little bit,

3941
01:48:46,321 --> 01:48:47,011
it could be yoga,

3942
01:48:47,011 --> 01:48:48,930
it could be 10 minutes in your house,

3943
01:48:48,931 --> 01:48:51,900
but actually finding that point
of stillness in our lives,

3944
01:48:51,901 --> 01:48:52,501
that's dinner.

3945
01:48:52,501 --> 01:48:56,520
And then the banquet is when you get to
really go into the void and bring back

3946
01:48:56,521 --> 01:48:58,200
some knowledge and some
different experiences.

3947
01:48:58,201 --> 01:49:00,660
But I think that would be the one thing.

3948
01:49:00,661 --> 01:49:02,310
If we could create one rule,

3949
01:49:02,311 --> 01:49:04,650
and if I could say I had omnipotent power,

3950
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:07,130
the one rule would be that
there would be some shot,

3951
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:07,380
you know,

3952
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:10,230
shamanistic tradition
that had a coming of age,

3953
01:49:10,231 --> 01:49:15,231
custom ceremony and an in the world in
which when you came of age as this as a

3954
01:49:15,661 --> 01:49:16,494
society,

3955
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:16,771
you know,

3956
01:49:16,771 --> 01:49:20,640
you had a psychedelic mystical
experience with the train guide,

3957
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:24,300
with your peers and with your elders
and had this community experience only,

3958
01:49:24,330 --> 01:49:25,740
even if it was only just one.

3959
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:27,810
So you got to experience and taste.

3960
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:29,250
That's something else that's holy,

3961
01:49:29,251 --> 01:49:33,360
other than just yourself and kind of
transcend your own ego even for one

3962
01:49:33,361 --> 01:49:33,990
evening.

3963
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:38,550
And I think that would make
single handedly the most
difference as far as change

3964
01:49:38,551 --> 01:49:39,384
in society.

3965
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:42,600
You know that one coming
of age ritual in which,

3966
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:42,931
you know,

3967
01:49:42,931 --> 01:49:44,160
they got to experience that.

3968
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:45,180
I think that would be it.

3969
01:49:45,330 --> 01:49:48,040
Unless someone made it like now

3970
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,540
you are a warrior

3971
01:49:52,150 --> 01:49:55,240
and you fucking take your short and go
out in the world and try to fucking cut

3972
01:49:55,241 --> 01:49:56,074
down your kingdom.

3973
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:56,540
Yeah,

3974
01:49:56,540 --> 01:49:56,711
no,

3975
01:49:56,711 --> 01:49:57,491
that couldn't be like that.

3976
01:49:57,491 --> 01:49:58,320
But the Shamans don't.

3977
01:49:58,320 --> 01:49:58,550
You know,

3978
01:49:58,550 --> 01:49:59,383
they never,

3979
01:49:59,540 --> 01:49:59,720
no,

3980
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:00,401
I wouldn't say never.

3981
01:50:00,401 --> 01:50:01,630
Obviously there's different Shawmut's,

3982
01:50:01,631 --> 01:50:03,490
but the tradition is not in that.

3983
01:50:03,491 --> 01:50:05,340
It's in transcending the ego and all.

3984
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:08,830
A lot of those kind of warmongering
mentalities is very ego driven.

3985
01:50:08,831 --> 01:50:09,040
Like,

3986
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:11,650
I will stomp you because I am strong.

3987
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:12,191
You know,

3988
01:50:12,191 --> 01:50:14,200
you don't get that from
the psychedelic experience.

3989
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:14,771
I mean,

3990
01:50:14,771 --> 01:50:16,510
you could get that endorsement.

3991
01:50:16,620 --> 01:50:17,320
Yeah,

3992
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:19,360
they got it from Anita Musk area.

3993
01:50:19,361 --> 01:50:19,670
They would.

3994
01:50:19,670 --> 01:50:20,503
They would.

3995
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:21,160
Zucker,

3996
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:21,401
yeah.

3997
01:50:21,401 --> 01:50:24,430
You can certainly channel it
into some very invincible,

3998
01:50:24,431 --> 01:50:25,540
aggressive states.

3999
01:50:25,570 --> 01:50:27,220
Especially if that's like your reality.

4000
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:28,130
That's what you,

4001
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:28,360
you know,

4002
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:28,990
your Wa,

4003
01:50:28,990 --> 01:50:30,640
you want Odin to guide you to victory,

4004
01:50:30,641 --> 01:50:30,970
man.

4005
01:50:30,970 --> 01:50:31,151
I mean,

4006
01:50:31,151 --> 01:50:31,331
your,

4007
01:50:31,331 --> 01:50:32,530
your reality is not,

4008
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:34,300
there are no vacation homes.

4009
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:35,290
Okay.

4010
01:50:35,290 --> 01:50:36,550
For the fucking Vikings,

4011
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:39,610
there is no Disneyland resort
that you can take the kids,

4012
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:40,091
you know,

4013
01:50:40,091 --> 01:50:42,550
it's about cutting people's heads
off where they cut your heads off.

4014
01:50:42,730 --> 01:50:43,090
Right.

4015
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:43,841
That's about storming.

4016
01:50:43,841 --> 01:50:45,250
The beach isn't taken all the women.

4017
01:50:45,530 --> 01:50:48,430
And so that's what he wants some
mushrooms to help them out with this.

4018
01:50:48,790 --> 01:50:50,050
There was no other way to live,

4019
01:50:50,110 --> 01:50:50,590
you know?

4020
01:50:50,590 --> 01:50:51,380
Were there any,

4021
01:50:51,380 --> 01:50:51,700
you know,

4022
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:52,870
pacifist vikings?

4023
01:50:53,910 --> 01:50:54,100
No,

4024
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:54,933
they didn't survive.

4025
01:50:55,340 --> 01:50:57,160
Like they didn't make babies.

4026
01:50:58,030 --> 01:50:59,230
None of that going on back then.

4027
01:50:59,231 --> 01:50:59,621
Bitch,

4028
01:50:59,621 --> 01:51:02,760
you there for one reason to make
little baby Brock Lesnar's yeah,

4029
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:04,053
that's it.

4030
01:51:04,210 --> 01:51:04,871
That was the goal.

4031
01:51:04,871 --> 01:51:05,704
Yeah.

4032
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:06,461
I think,

4033
01:51:06,461 --> 01:51:08,620
I think mushrooms in particular allow you,

4034
01:51:08,650 --> 01:51:09,210
I,

4035
01:51:09,210 --> 01:51:09,430
you know,

4036
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:12,850
I believe that there's kind of two
energetic forces out there and they're not

4037
01:51:12,851 --> 01:51:14,170
good and they're not evil ones.

4038
01:51:14,171 --> 01:51:14,650
Just,

4039
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:14,810
you know,

4040
01:51:14,810 --> 01:51:15,810
you can call it the dark or,

4041
01:51:15,811 --> 01:51:16,571
and call it the light,

4042
01:51:16,571 --> 01:51:19,330
but once more really the primal side of,

4043
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:19,961
of life,

4044
01:51:19,961 --> 01:51:21,670
it's that kill or be killed.

4045
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:23,440
It's that kind of savage animal,

4046
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:25,000
a dominant side,

4047
01:51:25,030 --> 01:51:28,420
and that has a certain energy that
has some destruction elements to it.

4048
01:51:28,421 --> 01:51:28,841
But it's all,

4049
01:51:28,841 --> 01:51:29,351
like you said,

4050
01:51:29,351 --> 01:51:30,520
it's all part of the same thing.

4051
01:51:30,521 --> 01:51:32,680
You can in some people know,

4052
01:51:32,681 --> 01:51:36,940
some people don't have it and some
people are really purely intellectual and

4053
01:51:36,941 --> 01:51:37,691
they're just not,

4054
01:51:37,691 --> 01:51:38,980
they're not connected to the physical,

4055
01:51:38,981 --> 01:51:39,940
but their intellectual.

4056
01:51:40,090 --> 01:51:41,470
It's like off the fucking charts.

4057
01:51:41,471 --> 01:51:44,370
And I think that's also a part
of this big crazy puzzle is it?

4058
01:51:44,410 --> 01:51:45,730
There's a you and there's a mean,

4059
01:51:45,731 --> 01:51:46,860
there's a Brian and then you know,

4060
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:48,640
there's sure it's like that old song.

4061
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:50,780
It takes him to Africa and the people,

4062
01:51:53,150 --> 01:51:53,820
I mean,

4063
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:56,170
it sounds so stupid and
ridiculous and simple,

4064
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:57,250
but it really does.

4065
01:51:57,251 --> 01:51:59,390
I mean in order to
accomplish this greater goal,

4066
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:00,290
just bizarre,

4067
01:52:00,510 --> 01:52:00,820
you know,

4068
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:01,900
multicultural,

4069
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:02,441
Uber,

4070
01:52:02,441 --> 01:52:03,640
complex civilization,

4071
01:52:03,641 --> 01:52:06,880
it really does require almost
every conceivable personality,

4072
01:52:06,881 --> 01:52:07,714
all work.

4073
01:52:07,790 --> 01:52:10,660
I still think that people should
strive for internal balance.

4074
01:52:10,661 --> 01:52:12,250
I think that leads to
the biggest happiness.

4075
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:13,960
I think access both.

4076
01:52:14,050 --> 01:52:15,280
If you're pulled towards that,

4077
01:52:15,281 --> 01:52:16,031
if you feel like,

4078
01:52:16,031 --> 01:52:17,440
you know it's missing in your life,

4079
01:52:17,830 --> 01:52:18,101
you know,

4080
01:52:18,101 --> 01:52:19,510
and for a lot of people that is the case.

4081
01:52:19,511 --> 01:52:20,380
A lot of people feel,

4082
01:52:20,650 --> 01:52:22,120
a lot of people are very unhappy.

4083
01:52:22,150 --> 01:52:22,840
You know,

4084
01:52:22,840 --> 01:52:25,270
a lot of people do not feel fulfilled.

4085
01:52:25,690 --> 01:52:30,690
I feel very lucky that everything
I enjoyed that I do for,

4086
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:31,350
you know,

4087
01:52:31,350 --> 01:52:31,691
for my,

4088
01:52:31,691 --> 01:52:32,441
in my life.

4089
01:52:32,441 --> 01:52:33,610
I enjoy these things.

4090
01:52:33,790 --> 01:52:35,800
I enjoy every podcast I do.

4091
01:52:35,801 --> 01:52:37,870
I enjoy all of my friends except Saturday,

4092
01:52:37,871 --> 01:52:38,860
Saturday just kind of sucks.

4093
01:52:39,010 --> 01:52:39,910
But that wasn't your fault.

4094
01:52:39,970 --> 01:52:40,990
Shit happen man.

4095
01:52:41,020 --> 01:52:41,510
You just,

4096
01:52:41,510 --> 01:52:44,770
you can't get Darryl right in a porn star
in one room and expect fucking sparks.

4097
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:46,010
Um,

4098
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:46,843
you know,

4099
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:47,141
I,

4100
01:52:47,141 --> 01:52:49,520
and if you can figure
out a way to do that,

4101
01:52:49,521 --> 01:52:52,790
to find whatever it is you do that
you really get satisfaction of with,

4102
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:54,410
whether it's carpentry or whether it's,

4103
01:52:54,411 --> 01:52:54,771
you know,

4104
01:52:54,771 --> 01:52:55,161
a painting,

4105
01:52:55,161 --> 01:52:56,450
pictures and whatever the fuck it is,

4106
01:52:56,750 --> 01:52:58,630
then really is number,

4107
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,620
like one of the most important things.

4108
01:53:00,740 --> 01:53:02,360
And then no cons.

4109
01:53:02,630 --> 01:53:03,620
Have a no rule,

4110
01:53:04,010 --> 01:53:04,701
just no cons.

4111
01:53:04,701 --> 01:53:05,480
Don't be a cunt.

4112
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:06,260
Just stop it.

4113
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:08,000
You know when people get mad
at me on the message board,

4114
01:53:08,001 --> 01:53:10,310
cause I keep fucking pinking
people in banning people.

4115
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:15,050
The way my message board is set up on
the Joe rogan.net is there's a bunch of

4116
01:53:15,051 --> 01:53:15,561
moderators.

4117
01:53:15,561 --> 01:53:16,790
All of them I know personally,

4118
01:53:16,850 --> 01:53:20,000
or at least I know I'm online and they're
all really cool and they don't want

4119
01:53:20,001 --> 01:53:20,810
you to being a Douche bag.

4120
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:21,501
It's really simple.

4121
01:53:21,501 --> 01:53:22,580
If you act too annoying,

4122
01:53:22,581 --> 01:53:23,390
you're trying,

4123
01:53:23,390 --> 01:53:24,930
trying to fucking hard you.

4124
01:53:24,930 --> 01:53:27,350
You stumble in and Piss off people,

4125
01:53:27,351 --> 01:53:28,310
you get conti,

4126
01:53:28,730 --> 01:53:31,100
you just get moved to the
stupid room and the stupid room.

4127
01:53:31,101 --> 01:53:32,720
You get a pink name and you know,

4128
01:53:32,721 --> 01:53:34,130
and now everybody knows you fucked up.

4129
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:38,360
You either acted like an asshole or
you were rude or you got annoying.

4130
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:39,170
What are the fucking has?

4131
01:53:39,170 --> 01:53:40,130
You're not being cool,

4132
01:53:40,131 --> 01:53:41,480
you're not enhancing things.

4133
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:46,550
And for some reason people think that
you're supposed to buy by giving them free

4134
01:53:46,551 --> 01:53:47,240
speech.

4135
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:49,790
You're allowed Lao them
in near little cyber room,

4136
01:53:49,820 --> 01:53:54,820
allow them to be cunts like people have
mistaken free speech for you can be a

4137
01:53:55,741 --> 01:53:57,320
client with no repercussions like,

4138
01:53:57,321 --> 01:53:58,154
yeah,

4139
01:53:58,580 --> 01:53:59,780
what about free speech?

4140
01:53:59,930 --> 01:54:00,171
It's like,

4141
01:54:00,171 --> 01:54:01,100
this isn't speech.

4142
01:54:01,101 --> 01:54:02,090
You're just cunty.

4143
01:54:02,210 --> 01:54:03,620
It's all you were allowed to talk,

4144
01:54:03,621 --> 01:54:04,850
but I don't have to listen.

4145
01:54:05,090 --> 01:54:05,960
I shut you off.

4146
01:54:05,961 --> 01:54:07,130
I don't want you around.

4147
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:10,370
Do you not understand that
you're an unpleasant vibe?

4148
01:54:10,610 --> 01:54:11,240
It's not.

4149
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:13,970
No one's stopping you from
starting your own message board,

4150
01:54:14,120 --> 01:54:14,953
no one starting you.

4151
01:54:15,050 --> 01:54:17,570
But what they're saying
is in a cyber home,

4152
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:20,120
you're not welcome anymore
because you're annoying.

4153
01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:24,230
Cause he come over and you bring a bad
vibe and people for whatever fucking

4154
01:54:24,231 --> 01:54:24,591
reason,

4155
01:54:24,591 --> 01:54:27,980
because they're so entitled with
this sense of anonymity and this,

4156
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:28,431
this,

4157
01:54:28,431 --> 01:54:32,450
this unnatural way of behaving that
people have because there's no social

4158
01:54:32,451 --> 01:54:33,284
repercussions.

4159
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:35,000
The norm is to be country.

4160
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:38,780
The norm is to say bitchy shit that would
make me tell you to get the fuck out

4161
01:54:38,781 --> 01:54:39,590
of my party.

4162
01:54:39,590 --> 01:54:42,410
And you think you could just do that
and they think they could just do it and

4163
01:54:42,411 --> 01:54:44,330
get away with it and you're
an asshole if you call him.

4164
01:54:44,350 --> 01:54:44,780
I'm like,

4165
01:54:44,780 --> 01:54:44,991
dude,

4166
01:54:44,991 --> 01:54:46,190
just stop talking about me.

4167
01:54:46,191 --> 01:54:47,060
Stop being a dick.

4168
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:48,020
Go Away.

4169
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:49,130
Bye Bye.

4170
01:54:49,390 --> 01:54:53,190
Imagine having a party and some guy
comes over and just criticizes you.

4171
01:54:53,370 --> 01:54:57,020
You know everything you're saying and
you know it says you're half retarded and

4172
01:54:57,070 --> 01:54:58,100
some of your ideas like,

4173
01:54:58,130 --> 01:54:58,281
oh,

4174
01:54:58,281 --> 01:54:58,670
okay,

4175
01:54:58,670 --> 01:54:59,750
get out of my fucking house,

4176
01:54:59,751 --> 01:55:00,021
Dude.

4177
01:55:00,021 --> 01:55:00,854
Just go.

4178
01:55:00,890 --> 01:55:01,250
You.

4179
01:55:01,250 --> 01:55:02,083
Obviously

4180
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:06,320
there's other ways to communicate you
fuck and you're thinking that there's only

4181
01:55:06,321 --> 01:55:09,560
one way because you've been doing
it this way for so fucking long.

4182
01:55:09,650 --> 01:55:13,850
You actually feel entitled to be a
cunt to treat it like it's a house.

4183
01:55:14,090 --> 01:55:16,340
Would you come over someone's house
and you're meeting them and would you

4184
01:55:16,341 --> 01:55:17,450
communicate with them like that?

4185
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:18,441
If you would,

4186
01:55:18,441 --> 01:55:19,274
I would kick you out.

4187
01:55:19,730 --> 01:55:20,780
It's really that simple.

4188
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:24,440
Don't think you can come into my cyber
house and not get kicked out for being

4189
01:55:24,441 --> 01:55:24,860
annoying.

4190
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:26,000
Don't make me boot ballet you.

4191
01:55:26,001 --> 01:55:26,480
Oh Shit.

4192
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:27,320
I just dish.

4193
01:55:27,370 --> 01:55:28,161
Have you been booed blade?

4194
01:55:28,161 --> 01:55:28,994
Is there an update?

4195
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:30,153
I haven't seen.

4196
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:31,143
I haven't seen any of their,

4197
01:55:31,430 --> 01:55:32,960
what they call that bublé denial.

4198
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:33,590
Dude,

4199
01:55:33,590 --> 01:55:34,880
I haven't seen a goddamn thing.

4200
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:36,030
It's true life.

4201
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:37,251
No,

4202
01:55:37,251 --> 01:55:38,120
I don't want this for a fact.

4203
01:55:38,121 --> 01:55:41,070
That last night I had to,

4204
01:55:42,180 --> 01:55:42,470
I had

4205
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:44,520
to tweet it and I was tweeting live.

4206
01:55:44,610 --> 01:55:45,270
Oh yeah.

4207
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:48,720
I was wondering if you
were doing that for them.

4208
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:49,573
I'll do it.

4209
01:55:49,910 --> 01:55:50,230
It's,

4210
01:55:50,230 --> 01:55:50,551
it's fun,

4211
01:55:50,551 --> 01:55:50,881
but I can't,

4212
01:55:50,881 --> 01:55:52,080
I can't give away spoilers.

4213
01:55:52,230 --> 01:55:52,620
Right.

4214
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:53,630
I have to make sure that,

4215
01:55:53,631 --> 01:55:54,420
uh,

4216
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:55,920
everything I'm saying is like MMM,

4217
01:55:56,230 --> 01:55:56,640
no,

4218
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:57,360
no spoilers.

4219
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:57,880
Yeah.

4220
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:02,760
Just gotta protect information from the
people speak when you were watching it

4221
01:56:02,761 --> 01:56:03,630
east coast time.

4222
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:04,621
How the fuck is that?

4223
01:56:04,621 --> 01:56:05,371
Because you have direct TV.

4224
01:56:05,371 --> 01:56:05,701
Oh,

4225
01:56:05,701 --> 01:56:06,960
I just know shit though.

4226
01:56:06,961 --> 01:56:08,130
Y'All dog.

4227
01:56:08,131 --> 01:56:10,290
I know people I know to hook that shit up.

4228
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:11,370
I see.

4229
01:56:11,370 --> 01:56:12,030
Um,

4230
01:56:12,030 --> 01:56:13,710
I wanted to bring something out.

4231
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:14,790
Why while uh,

4232
01:56:15,030 --> 01:56:16,680
Aubrey's here and yes,

4233
01:56:16,740 --> 01:56:17,850
his name used to be Chris.

4234
01:56:18,030 --> 01:56:18,751
If you go back and go,

4235
01:56:18,751 --> 01:56:18,961
man,

4236
01:56:18,961 --> 01:56:21,990
they used to be a second thoughts as
the guy looked just like that lock.

4237
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:22,873
No second thoughts.

4238
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:24,930
It's actually finally
got to the point where,

4239
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:25,411
you know,

4240
01:56:25,411 --> 01:56:26,700
Chris sounds weird to me,

4241
01:56:26,760 --> 01:56:27,031
you know,

4242
01:56:27,031 --> 01:56:31,260
really it's not that many people that
can pull off changing their fucking name,

4243
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:32,700
you know,

4244
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:34,680
and having us not make fun of it.

4245
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,100
We had to make fun of a little,

4246
01:56:38,101 --> 01:56:39,290
I guess you got a little of it,

4247
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:40,670
but it ain't,

4248
01:56:40,670 --> 01:56:41,180
it ended up,

4249
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:42,500
I still got a few of the like,

4250
01:56:42,530 --> 01:56:42,670
well,

4251
01:56:42,670 --> 01:56:43,261
who's that girl?

4252
01:56:43,261 --> 01:56:45,210
Aubrey was Texas,

4253
01:56:45,211 --> 01:56:45,970
I would imagine.

4254
01:56:45,970 --> 01:56:46,460
Yeah,

4255
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:47,670
go named Aubrey.

4256
01:56:48,470 --> 01:56:48,840
Yeah.

4257
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:51,120
Do you ever wear a beaded bracelets?

4258
01:56:51,180 --> 01:56:52,013
Do you ever do that?

4259
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:53,000
No,

4260
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,390
because usually I do have,

4261
01:56:54,570 --> 01:56:58,410
I do you have like
wooden beads is a shells.

4262
01:56:58,860 --> 01:56:59,693
Oh,

4263
01:57:00,330 --> 01:57:02,610
isn't not a John Half Ron joke is it?

4264
01:57:03,250 --> 01:57:03,510
Hey,

4265
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:04,343
I wanted to talk,

4266
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:05,521
you know,

4267
01:57:05,521 --> 01:57:06,330
obviously,

4268
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:06,780
uh,

4269
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:08,610
we know each other originally
from the flashlight.

4270
01:57:08,611 --> 01:57:09,630
A lot of people might not know that.

4271
01:57:09,631 --> 01:57:12,510
And then we're sort of in business
together and on it and uh,

4272
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:15,660
make an Alpha brain and shroom tech sport.

4273
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:16,610
And um,

4274
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:17,800
I,

4275
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:18,151
by the way,

4276
01:57:18,151 --> 01:57:19,640
I love that I fucking
Trump type that stuff,

4277
01:57:19,641 --> 01:57:20,800
that shit before Jujitsu.

4278
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:22,080
It's great for working out,

4279
01:57:22,230 --> 01:57:23,610
but this is your beat 12 in that too.

4280
01:57:23,670 --> 01:57:24,120
There is,

4281
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,890
how much be 12 methylcobalamin.

4282
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:26,910
There's um,

4283
01:57:27,630 --> 01:57:29,040
2000 micrograms in there.

4284
01:57:29,190 --> 01:57:30,030
That's a good amount.

4285
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:30,983
But the,

4286
01:57:30,990 --> 01:57:34,830
but the Methylcobalamin is a different
type of B12 and the Cyanocobalamin,

4287
01:57:35,170 --> 01:57:37,390
a Cyanna Cobell and
extra creates a molecule,

4288
01:57:37,391 --> 01:57:39,540
a cyanide when it's
released into the body.

4289
01:57:39,541 --> 01:57:41,730
But methylcobalamin is called Methyl B 12.

4290
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:43,890
A lot healthier for the
body and a lot better.

4291
01:57:44,070 --> 01:57:45,330
But a lot of people take,

4292
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:46,193
you know,

4293
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:48,840
like an athlete that
gets an injection time,

4294
01:57:48,841 --> 01:57:49,201
that's,

4295
01:57:49,201 --> 01:57:49,470
you know,

4296
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:51,450
tens of thousands of
micrograms would be 12.

4297
01:57:51,451 --> 01:57:52,620
So it's water soluble,

4298
01:57:52,810 --> 01:57:53,100
uh,

4299
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:54,570
releases any excess,

4300
01:57:54,690 --> 01:57:55,890
just releases through urine.

4301
01:57:55,891 --> 01:57:58,290
So the body will utilize
what it can and then,

4302
01:57:58,291 --> 01:57:58,650
uh,

4303
01:57:58,650 --> 01:58:00,060
and then just pee out the rest.

4304
01:58:00,061 --> 01:58:00,841
And the quarter steps.

4305
01:58:00,841 --> 01:58:03,690
Mushroom was first used
by Chinese athletes.

4306
01:58:03,691 --> 01:58:04,111
Is that who,

4307
01:58:04,111 --> 01:58:04,410
uh,

4308
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:05,940
they figured it out first Chinese,

4309
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:08,040
but they figured it out 2000 years ago.

4310
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:08,993
The courthouse steps,

4311
01:58:09,690 --> 01:58:11,580
the herdsmen in northern Tibet and China,

4312
01:58:11,830 --> 01:58:13,560
they're an extremely high altitudes.

4313
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:14,870
And now up there and those altitudes,

4314
01:58:14,890 --> 01:58:16,770
the herds and the people
get very sluggish.

4315
01:58:17,010 --> 01:58:21,180
And they noticed that when a certain
type of mushroom was available and on the

4316
01:58:21,181 --> 01:58:22,290
ground and the herds would eat it,

4317
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:26,110
the herds would become particularly
active and there would be moving around.

4318
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:27,000
They'd have more endurance,

4319
01:58:27,001 --> 01:58:29,190
they'd be able to push them
harder and they'd be playing more.

4320
01:58:29,460 --> 01:58:30,150
And so the,

4321
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:30,480
you know,

4322
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:31,111
back in the day,

4323
01:58:31,111 --> 01:58:34,050
that was your biggest cue if you were
just a person kind of looking around.

4324
01:58:34,051 --> 01:58:37,620
So they took a look at these and they
tried them themselves and found the same,

4325
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:38,760
same results.

4326
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,830
And what we know now is that
the court accepts mushroom.

4327
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:44,350
It's actually a symbiont
to the ghost moth,

4328
01:58:44,650 --> 01:58:47,230
which is the host for this,

4329
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:47,800
uh,

4330
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:48,633
for the mushroom.

4331
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:52,750
And what they believe that it does is
the same thing that it does in people and

4332
01:58:52,751 --> 01:58:54,130
in other animals and ingest it.

4333
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:59,140
It increases the oxygen utilization
and cellular energy of the animal,

4334
01:58:59,141 --> 01:59:04,090
of the moth itself to allow the moth in
this extremely high altitude plane to be

4335
01:59:04,091 --> 01:59:05,050
able to fly better,

4336
01:59:05,051 --> 01:59:07,900
to be able to fly longer and
actually survive and adapt.

4337
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:09,730
And then when the moth dies,

4338
01:59:09,910 --> 01:59:12,100
the quarter's hubs mushroom
actually springs out of it.

4339
01:59:12,610 --> 01:59:17,610
And so the first people to discover it
in form of like real athletic competition

4340
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:18,693
was um,

4341
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:22,150
coach Meyer and the
Chinese Olympic team today,

4342
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:25,990
shroom tech and then you die on mushrooms
going to grow your fucking head.

4343
01:59:26,230 --> 01:59:27,041
I'm serious,

4344
01:59:27,041 --> 01:59:27,291
man.

4345
01:59:27,291 --> 01:59:28,660
Sports is it like those,

4346
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:29,830
those uh,

4347
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:30,670
those ants,

4348
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:32,680
it's like those ants and fucking in the,

4349
01:59:32,681 --> 01:59:33,101
in the,

4350
01:59:33,101 --> 01:59:33,340
uh,

4351
01:59:33,340 --> 01:59:34,240
is it the Amazon?

4352
01:59:34,270 --> 01:59:35,260
Whatever jungle it is,

4353
01:59:35,261 --> 01:59:35,681
where those,

4354
01:59:35,681 --> 01:59:35,891
uh,

4355
01:59:35,891 --> 01:59:40,150
those ants get infected by spores and
then those spores explode other fucking

4356
01:59:40,151 --> 01:59:41,620
head and contaminate the other hand.

4357
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:42,820
These are dead and dried.

4358
01:59:42,821 --> 01:59:43,470
Otherwise,

4359
01:59:43,470 --> 01:59:43,690
you know,

4360
01:59:43,690 --> 01:59:44,650
it could be possibly no,

4361
01:59:44,680 --> 01:59:45,161
it really,

4362
01:59:45,161 --> 01:59:47,870
these are dead and dried and
take their dead and dried.

4363
01:59:47,871 --> 01:59:48,591
Then what is the,

4364
01:59:48,591 --> 01:59:48,671
uh,

4365
01:59:48,671 --> 01:59:49,271
the benefit?

4366
01:59:49,271 --> 01:59:50,290
Where's the benefit coming from

4367
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:52,120
coming from what's inside?

4368
01:59:52,150 --> 01:59:53,110
What's inside the mushroom?

4369
01:59:53,111 --> 01:59:55,150
There's a lot of available raw identizine,

4370
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:56,770
which is what is,

4371
01:59:56,771 --> 01:59:56,981
uh,

4372
01:59:56,981 --> 01:59:58,530
an important factor in ATP,

4373
01:59:58,531 --> 01:59:58,970
ADP,

4374
01:59:58,970 --> 01:59:59,730
ADP.

4375
01:59:59,730 --> 02:00:03,180
So don't go grown your own cordyceps
mushroom and just eating them.

4376
02:00:04,460 --> 02:00:04,800
Well,

4377
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:05,900
we'll kill all that anyways,

4378
02:00:05,901 --> 02:00:06,280
but,

4379
02:00:06,280 --> 02:00:07,113
but it does,

4380
02:00:07,230 --> 02:00:08,990
but it's a different mushroom.

4381
02:00:08,991 --> 02:00:09,824
France.

4382
02:00:09,830 --> 02:00:11,390
Cordyceps is only found in the north,

4383
02:00:11,391 --> 02:00:12,500
in the high regions of,

4384
02:00:12,501 --> 02:00:13,011
of Tibet.

4385
02:00:13,011 --> 02:00:16,400
And China and it was actually the most
expensive nutritional compounds in the

4386
02:00:16,401 --> 02:00:16,701
world.

4387
02:00:16,701 --> 02:00:19,760
For a while it was getting
up to over $20,000 a kilo.

4388
02:00:19,850 --> 02:00:22,760
Holy Shit steps mushroom at some point
because it's really hard to grow.

4389
02:00:23,010 --> 02:00:25,490
It's impossible to grow really until,

4390
02:00:25,491 --> 02:00:28,660
until they could only wild
cultivated from these mosques.

4391
02:00:28,670 --> 02:00:31,340
It was very difficult
until a Aloha nutritional,

4392
02:00:31,341 --> 02:00:33,560
the the company that we get
it from doctor John Holiday,

4393
02:00:33,561 --> 02:00:38,210
he made some real advances in medicine
that allowed him to cultivate it and in a

4394
02:00:38,211 --> 02:00:42,290
competitive substrate that allows the
quadriceps to grow and be very effective

4395
02:00:42,291 --> 02:00:42,800
in a,

4396
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,030
in a cultivated state.

4397
02:00:44,060 --> 02:00:47,720
Otherwise they had to explain
the competitive aspect
of it cause that's really

4398
02:00:47,721 --> 02:00:48,710
fucking fascinating.

4399
02:00:48,710 --> 02:00:48,831
Yeah.

4400
02:00:48,831 --> 02:00:52,080
So they grow it in like a brown
rice kind of compote substrate.

4401
02:00:52,100 --> 02:00:55,670
And what they found is it mushrooms have
to compete for a variety of things when

4402
02:00:55,671 --> 02:01:00,470
they come upon a log or any kind of
different environment with Marin.

4403
02:01:00,690 --> 02:01:01,130
Um,

4404
02:01:01,130 --> 02:01:02,450
depending on what's out there,

4405
02:01:02,451 --> 02:01:05,000
they will put out
anti-competition compounds,

4406
02:01:05,001 --> 02:01:06,620
which actually both strengthen their own,

4407
02:01:06,860 --> 02:01:10,190
their own species and also
eliminate the other species.

4408
02:01:10,191 --> 02:01:11,600
So if there's a bunch of bacteria,

4409
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:13,640
they'll excrete certain
certain things to work.

4410
02:01:13,641 --> 02:01:16,340
The bacteria that's trying to
get at the decomposing log.

4411
02:01:16,341 --> 02:01:17,540
But if there's other mushrooms,

4412
02:01:17,750 --> 02:01:21,410
there's certain anti-competition compounds
available in those mushrooms that's

4413
02:01:21,411 --> 02:01:24,230
going to allow the mushroom
to actually thrive.

4414
02:01:24,231 --> 02:01:28,280
And some of those anti-competition
compounds are some of
the bioactive compounds

4415
02:01:28,490 --> 02:01:29,660
that are found in the mushrooms.

4416
02:01:30,110 --> 02:01:30,500
Wow,

4417
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:31,970
that's fucking bad ass.

4418
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:34,130
But putting them in a
competitive environment,

4419
02:01:34,140 --> 02:01:35,330
it makes them make more strong,

4420
02:01:35,331 --> 02:01:36,200
stronger in the court,

4421
02:01:36,201 --> 02:01:40,130
accepts you get more rod adenosine
and the oxygen is another really

4422
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,771
cool thing.

4423
02:01:40,771 --> 02:01:40,940
And,

4424
02:01:40,940 --> 02:01:41,600
and that,

4425
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:43,520
that's very easy to test actually.

4426
02:01:43,550 --> 02:01:47,840
Cause you can actually take a mask and
the oxygen level is normally 20% and you

4427
02:01:47,841 --> 02:01:52,750
breathe it out at 13% and then you put
the mask on and after taking cordyceps

4428
02:01:52,820 --> 02:01:53,600
for two weeks,

4429
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:57,680
you'll come out and oxygen you intake
is still at instill at 20% but you're

4430
02:01:57,681 --> 02:02:01,010
breathing out at 8% which was one
of the studies that they show.

4431
02:02:01,011 --> 02:02:02,660
So that's a 50% increase,

4432
02:02:02,661 --> 02:02:05,840
roughly 40% seems like that every
night he would have to take it then.

4433
02:02:05,841 --> 02:02:06,830
Is that really possible?

4434
02:02:06,831 --> 02:02:07,940
That seems like too high.

4435
02:02:08,270 --> 02:02:09,500
I don't notice it that high.

4436
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:09,790
I don't,

4437
02:02:09,790 --> 02:02:10,990
I don't feel like it's that high one.

4438
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:13,790
I don't feel like I
have 50% more endurance.

4439
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:15,740
Well that's just oxygen
utilization though.

4440
02:02:15,741 --> 02:02:16,580
That's not endurance.

4441
02:02:16,581 --> 02:02:21,110
It's not measuring the actual endurance
capacity utilization should be a huge

4442
02:02:21,111 --> 02:02:21,540
part of that.

4443
02:02:21,540 --> 02:02:21,921
Shouldn't be.

4444
02:02:21,921 --> 02:02:22,850
It should be a big part.

4445
02:02:22,851 --> 02:02:24,200
And that study that study's been out,

4446
02:02:24,201 --> 02:02:25,400
it's actually posted on the site.

4447
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:25,700
Uh,

4448
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:26,810
other studies have shown,

4449
02:02:26,811 --> 02:02:27,021
you know,

4450
02:02:27,021 --> 02:02:27,980
varying different degrees,

4451
02:02:27,981 --> 02:02:30,080
but always oxygen utilization is a key.

4452
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:31,530
And also adenosine,

4453
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:32,060
um,

4454
02:02:32,060 --> 02:02:35,600
providing increased ATP
synthesis versus ADP.

4455
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:39,620
The biggest boost that I ever gotten
during swatched when I had my nose fixed

4456
02:02:39,860 --> 02:02:41,810
because my nose was all
fucked up and talks and sign.

4457
02:02:41,811 --> 02:02:42,800
I couldn't get any air through it.

4458
02:02:42,801 --> 02:02:43,640
It was a mouth breather.

4459
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:45,650
And then once I got my nose fixed,

4460
02:02:45,651 --> 02:02:48,500
I was like literally like I
got a 20% bump in my party.

4461
02:02:48,501 --> 02:02:49,280
It's a big difference.

4462
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:50,000
It's amazing.

4463
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:50,420
You know,

4464
02:02:50,420 --> 02:02:52,370
that was the most amazing,

4465
02:02:52,371 --> 02:02:53,150
obvious,

4466
02:02:53,150 --> 02:02:53,840
uh,

4467
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:54,740
thing that I realized.

4468
02:02:54,741 --> 02:02:57,200
But this is a fucking close second.

4469
02:02:57,530 --> 02:02:57,980
When I,

4470
02:02:57,980 --> 02:03:00,110
when I have like real hard workouts man,

4471
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:00,441
you know,

4472
02:03:00,441 --> 02:03:01,850
especially like Jujitsu class,

4473
02:03:01,851 --> 02:03:03,050
like you know,

4474
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:03,913
I uh,

4475
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:06,100
I rode for the first time
in a while last night and I,

4476
02:03:06,101 --> 02:03:07,010
I rolled like,

4477
02:03:07,150 --> 02:03:07,460
you know,

4478
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:09,500
deep into the class like a lot of times,

4479
02:03:09,501 --> 02:03:09,681
you know,

4480
02:03:09,681 --> 02:03:12,440
you go five or six guys and you
just don't want to do it anymore.

4481
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:13,340
You've just done.

4482
02:03:13,670 --> 02:03:16,430
But this like gets me one extra role.

4483
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:18,560
I feel like it's not easy but it gets,

4484
02:03:18,561 --> 02:03:20,780
we one extra role and at the
end of it where I'm like,

4485
02:03:20,781 --> 02:03:21,171
wow,

4486
02:03:21,171 --> 02:03:22,490
I feel like I feel all right,

4487
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:24,031
100%.

4488
02:03:24,031 --> 02:03:27,460
It gives you a boost but it doesn't
give me that cracked out red bull.

4489
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:27,931
There's no,

4490
02:03:27,931 --> 02:03:28,970
there's no stimulants in it.

4491
02:03:28,971 --> 02:03:30,560
So surrounding the quarter steps,

4492
02:03:31,010 --> 02:03:33,800
which is providing cellular
energy versus glandular energy,

4493
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:37,310
glandular energy is basically tricking
your body to release adrenaline.

4494
02:03:37,311 --> 02:03:40,760
That's where caffeine and all these things
are doing basically re releasing more

4495
02:03:40,761 --> 02:03:41,151
adrenaline.

4496
02:03:41,151 --> 02:03:42,560
So you feel like you have energy,

4497
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:43,970
but your actual cells,

4498
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:47,510
which are still using the
ATP cycle to produce energy,

4499
02:03:47,511 --> 02:03:48,860
don't have any extra energy.

4500
02:03:48,861 --> 02:03:52,490
So you push harder because you think
you have the crush your adrenals and you

4501
02:03:52,491 --> 02:03:53,271
crush your adrenals.

4502
02:03:53,271 --> 02:03:53,631
This had been,

4503
02:03:53,631 --> 02:03:55,070
James was told by his doctor,

4504
02:03:55,071 --> 02:03:56,360
he had to stop drinking coffee.

4505
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:56,780
Yeah,

4506
02:03:56,780 --> 02:03:57,613
it's killing us.

4507
02:03:57,710 --> 02:04:01,280
Just pushing that button over and over
again until the button just doesn't have

4508
02:04:01,281 --> 02:04:03,470
as much to get out and just
turns to a leathery sad.

4509
02:04:03,500 --> 02:04:06,680
This is operating on a totally different
mechanism and that's why you get that

4510
02:04:06,681 --> 02:04:08,150
kind of physical burst.

4511
02:04:08,160 --> 02:04:08,251
It,

4512
02:04:08,251 --> 02:04:08,990
it's uh,

4513
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:10,250
it's subtler than people.

4514
02:04:10,251 --> 02:04:11,360
People were used to taking it.

4515
02:04:11,380 --> 02:04:11,601
Oh,

4516
02:04:11,601 --> 02:04:12,231
explode.

4517
02:04:12,231 --> 02:04:12,381
You know,

4518
02:04:12,381 --> 02:04:12,921
they might be like,

4519
02:04:12,921 --> 02:04:13,131
oh,

4520
02:04:13,131 --> 02:04:13,790
this shit sucks.

4521
02:04:13,790 --> 02:04:14,571
That's a good question.

4522
02:04:14,571 --> 02:04:15,560
I'm wanting to ask you about this.

4523
02:04:15,561 --> 02:04:16,161
I liked that.

4524
02:04:16,161 --> 02:04:18,530
Jack Three d I liked that
stuff before I work out.

4525
02:04:18,531 --> 02:04:19,520
Can I take the two of them together?

4526
02:04:19,521 --> 02:04:21,980
And just literally there are no
negative repercussions doing it.

4527
02:04:22,010 --> 02:04:23,630
They're doing completely different things.

4528
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:24,200
So,

4529
02:04:24,200 --> 02:04:24,441
you know,

4530
02:04:24,441 --> 02:04:26,210
Jack Three d makes you fucking,

4531
02:04:26,270 --> 02:04:28,880
you just feel like you
got some energy to good.

4532
02:04:28,881 --> 02:04:29,361
And by the way,

4533
02:04:29,361 --> 02:04:31,610
we have no affiliation
with Jack Three d use,

4534
02:04:31,611 --> 02:04:34,100
whichever nitric oxide
supplement you enjoy.

4535
02:04:34,370 --> 02:04:36,260
But a buddy of mine told me
about Jack Three d is like,

4536
02:04:36,261 --> 02:04:36,441
dude,

4537
02:04:36,441 --> 02:04:37,110
I like this stuff.

4538
02:04:37,110 --> 02:04:37,810
And I'd started taking,

4539
02:04:37,810 --> 02:04:38,643
I was like,

4540
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:39,631
give you a little boost.

4541
02:04:39,631 --> 02:04:40,110
Yeah.

4542
02:04:40,110 --> 02:04:43,110
You know what else is great
to Beta Alanine Beta Alanine.

4543
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:44,880
Dr Ulous told me about this,

4544
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:45,450
um,

4545
02:04:45,450 --> 02:04:45,930
uh,

4546
02:04:45,930 --> 02:04:48,000
you was a famous sports
doctor and he said,

4547
02:04:48,001 --> 02:04:51,270
this is one of the few things that he's
noticed like over the past few years,

4548
02:04:51,450 --> 02:04:55,770
supplements that he finds to be really
legit as far as like a muscle building,

4549
02:04:55,771 --> 02:04:57,450
like a muscle recovery.

4550
02:04:57,610 --> 02:04:58,051
And he's,

4551
02:04:58,051 --> 02:05:00,320
he's found that he makes a
big gains of this stuff or,

4552
02:05:00,321 --> 02:05:01,410
or quicker gains.

4553
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:03,330
She has used to and he's
pretty in tune with his body.

4554
02:05:03,480 --> 02:05:04,510
That's another thing about this,

4555
02:05:04,511 --> 02:05:05,640
a shroom tech stuff.

4556
02:05:05,730 --> 02:05:07,470
I think you have to be
in tune with your body.

4557
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:08,221
And you know,

4558
02:05:08,221 --> 02:05:09,060
when people ask me like,

4559
02:05:09,061 --> 02:05:09,241
Hey,

4560
02:05:09,241 --> 02:05:11,040
what should I buy this stuff?

4561
02:05:11,070 --> 02:05:12,180
Should I buy that shroom tech stuff?

4562
02:05:12,181 --> 02:05:13,670
Like do you work out how to,

4563
02:05:13,710 --> 02:05:14,543
how hard you work?

4564
02:05:14,580 --> 02:05:15,720
If you don't work out really hard,

4565
02:05:15,930 --> 02:05:16,700
save your money.

4566
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:18,190
It'd be nice just for the energy boost.

4567
02:05:18,200 --> 02:05:19,880
So instead of having Starbucks everyday.

4568
02:05:20,650 --> 02:05:21,040
Yeah.

4569
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:23,310
But Starbucks different energy.

4570
02:05:23,311 --> 02:05:24,144
A different kind of,

4571
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:26,280
once you start working out,

4572
02:05:26,310 --> 02:05:28,020
that's when you really start to feel it.

4573
02:05:28,050 --> 02:05:28,350
Yeah,

4574
02:05:28,350 --> 02:05:28,861
I get that.

4575
02:05:28,861 --> 02:05:29,470
Starbucks.

4576
02:05:29,470 --> 02:05:30,930
Do you mean when you hit a fucking,

4577
02:05:30,931 --> 02:05:31,280
you know,

4578
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:31,500
uh,

4579
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:34,320
a [inaudible] coffee at
Starbucks and you two sips in it.

4580
02:05:34,321 --> 02:05:35,610
You fucking love everything.

4581
02:05:35,910 --> 02:05:37,980
Pukka I want to go fucking paint my car.

4582
02:05:37,981 --> 02:05:38,490
You know,

4583
02:05:38,490 --> 02:05:41,040
you get like almost like a meth crank.

4584
02:05:41,070 --> 02:05:44,190
Sort of like really excited feeling to it.

4585
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:46,940
You don't ever get that
with shroom tech Trent.

4586
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:47,491
Oh my God.

4587
02:05:47,491 --> 02:05:49,590
It's 30 ounces and it's
the size of your stomach.

4588
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:49,771
Dude.

4589
02:05:49,771 --> 02:05:50,604
You're going to die.

4590
02:05:50,850 --> 02:05:53,550
I do one of those a day that's
going to Jack your whole system,

4591
02:05:53,551 --> 02:05:54,384
man.

4592
02:05:54,640 --> 02:05:55,473
Um,

4593
02:05:55,830 --> 02:05:56,663
sleep.

4594
02:05:57,150 --> 02:05:57,580
Yeah,

4595
02:05:57,580 --> 02:05:57,880
you're,

4596
02:05:57,880 --> 02:05:58,440
you gotta be,

4597
02:05:58,440 --> 02:05:59,610
you must be massively addicted.

4598
02:05:59,611 --> 02:06:00,930
The other stream tech product though,

4599
02:06:00,931 --> 02:06:01,560
everybody.

4600
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:02,600
Everybody should definitely.

4601
02:06:03,860 --> 02:06:04,800
And what is the difference?

4602
02:06:04,801 --> 02:06:05,251
What's the,

4603
02:06:05,251 --> 02:06:05,481
the,

4604
02:06:05,481 --> 02:06:06,001
the stuff,

4605
02:06:06,001 --> 02:06:06,391
insurance,

4606
02:06:06,391 --> 02:06:07,590
a whole different set of mushrooms.

4607
02:06:07,591 --> 02:06:08,430
So from,

4608
02:06:08,460 --> 02:06:08,700
you know,

4609
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:09,780
from Aloha medicinals,

4610
02:06:09,781 --> 02:06:10,710
Dr John Holidays,

4611
02:06:10,711 --> 02:06:13,470
his kind of flagship product is
this product called Iowa Immune,

4612
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:16,890
which takes certain elements of these
mushrooms that he grows together and the

4613
02:06:16,891 --> 02:06:17,590
substrate,

4614
02:06:17,590 --> 02:06:17,970
um,

4615
02:06:17,970 --> 02:06:21,630
it's actually a very specific part of
it and they're called triple righthand

4616
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:26,760
helix polysaccharide Beta glucans and
what these particular mushrooms do and

4617
02:06:26,761 --> 02:06:27,270
their president,

4618
02:06:27,270 --> 02:06:28,410
Chaga mushrooms in particular,

4619
02:06:28,411 --> 02:06:29,430
the strong quantity.

4620
02:06:29,431 --> 02:06:30,120
I take that.

4621
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:30,750
Yeah.

4622
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:31,350
And uh,

4623
02:06:31,350 --> 02:06:33,850
what they do is they actually trigger a,

4624
02:06:34,090 --> 02:06:35,940
an innate response from the immune system.

4625
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:38,310
So in the body's natural immune system,

4626
02:06:39,030 --> 02:06:41,610
the gut is responsible for a lot of the,

4627
02:06:41,690 --> 02:06:41,910
you know,

4628
02:06:41,910 --> 02:06:45,180
natural killer cells that actually
fight all the pathogens and entering

4629
02:06:45,181 --> 02:06:45,871
bacteria,

4630
02:06:45,871 --> 02:06:46,704
viruses,

4631
02:06:46,740 --> 02:06:48,000
cancer cells that are shed.

4632
02:06:48,270 --> 02:06:52,170
And what happens at an early age for us
is with all the antibiotics that are in

4633
02:06:52,171 --> 02:06:52,831
our water,

4634
02:06:52,831 --> 02:06:53,360
and then,

4635
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:53,571
you know,

4636
02:06:53,571 --> 02:06:54,390
that we take,

4637
02:06:54,390 --> 02:06:57,930
we ended up killing scores of these
probiotic bacteria in our stomachs.

4638
02:06:57,930 --> 02:07:02,730
So they are no longer available to create
the amount of immune cells that can go

4639
02:07:02,731 --> 02:07:05,790
attack any invading pathogens
that get us sick all the time.

4640
02:07:05,970 --> 02:07:08,670
So we're at a natural
disadvantage what the,

4641
02:07:08,671 --> 02:07:11,100
and they've done a ton of
studies on this io immune.

4642
02:07:11,101 --> 02:07:15,060
They're using it in Q and a at the
same time as cancer patients getting

4643
02:07:15,061 --> 02:07:17,460
treatment for chemotherapy
at the same time that,

4644
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:17,820
uh,

4645
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:20,690
hepatitis B patients are getting
treatment with the [inaudible],

4646
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:21,600
which is a viral,

4647
02:07:21,730 --> 02:07:22,250
um,

4648
02:07:22,250 --> 02:07:22,410
uh,

4649
02:07:22,410 --> 02:07:24,570
prescribed pharmaceutical
viral therapy and having,

4650
02:07:24,730 --> 02:07:24,990
you know,

4651
02:07:24,990 --> 02:07:28,950
dramatically positive results
in combination with other
treatments because it's

4652
02:07:28,951 --> 02:07:31,530
raising the body's natural immune system.

4653
02:07:31,531 --> 02:07:35,010
And how it does it is these triple
righthand Beta Glucan polysaccharide

4654
02:07:35,020 --> 02:07:35,471
molecules,

4655
02:07:35,471 --> 02:07:36,304
which are unique

4656
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:37,330
to these mushrooms.

4657
02:07:37,590 --> 02:07:38,290
Um,

4658
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:41,050
they are recognized by the
body as foreign elements,

4659
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:41,650
but,

4660
02:07:41,650 --> 02:07:45,070
and so the body mounts up their
charge of innate and natural killers,

4661
02:07:45,071 --> 02:07:49,480
these B t cells and different killer
cells and basically builds an army to deal

4662
02:07:49,481 --> 02:07:50,050
with this.

4663
02:07:50,050 --> 02:07:51,520
That's actually a benign threat.

4664
02:07:51,580 --> 02:07:54,790
So there's a cardboard army coming at
them and they have a hundred nukes.

4665
02:07:54,850 --> 02:07:55,360
Yeah,

4666
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:55,931
exactly.

4667
02:07:55,931 --> 02:07:56,351
Exactly.

4668
02:07:56,351 --> 02:07:56,920
So that's crazy.

4669
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:57,521
They're mounting,

4670
02:07:57,521 --> 02:08:00,610
they're rallying and they're creating
more immune cells that are capable of

4671
02:08:00,611 --> 02:08:02,230
handling actual threats.

4672
02:08:02,290 --> 02:08:04,390
And is that taxing on your system at all?

4673
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:04,780
No.

4674
02:08:04,780 --> 02:08:05,540
It's what the,

4675
02:08:05,540 --> 02:08:09,070
the system is supposed to have more
natural killer cells in it naturally,

4676
02:08:09,071 --> 02:08:09,521
innately.

4677
02:08:09,521 --> 02:08:09,611
And,

4678
02:08:09,611 --> 02:08:10,660
and as I was mentioning,

4679
02:08:10,661 --> 02:08:12,170
I think you might've been rummaging,

4680
02:08:12,270 --> 02:08:12,760
you know,

4681
02:08:12,760 --> 02:08:13,481
doing something,

4682
02:08:13,481 --> 02:08:14,390
but um,

4683
02:08:14,980 --> 02:08:19,150
what happens is when the gut gets all
that probiotic bacteria gets killed from

4684
02:08:19,151 --> 02:08:20,950
all the antibiotics in
our different foods,

4685
02:08:20,951 --> 02:08:22,510
we water in different drugs,

4686
02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:24,880
they're not able to produce
an adequate quantity.

4687
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:29,080
So we're actually at an immune deficits
and naturally do antibiotics actually

4688
02:08:29,081 --> 02:08:31,540
make it from a cow into
your body when you,

4689
02:08:31,541 --> 02:08:32,470
when you eat a cow,

4690
02:08:32,990 --> 02:08:36,400
the who believe so proven.

4691
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:37,630
I don't know if it's been proven.

4692
02:08:37,631 --> 02:08:37,930
That's,

4693
02:08:37,930 --> 02:08:38,763
that's kind of a,

4694
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:40,960
but that's kind of the
theory that goes on.

4695
02:08:40,961 --> 02:08:42,720
And I'd have to do some
more research on it.

4696
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:43,121
Makes Sense.

4697
02:08:43,121 --> 02:08:44,290
I know water with,

4698
02:08:44,291 --> 02:08:44,591
you know,

4699
02:08:44,591 --> 02:08:46,400
they say that there's stuff in the water,

4700
02:08:47,350 --> 02:08:50,530
but everybody who hasn't taken
courses of heavy antibiotics,

4701
02:08:50,620 --> 02:08:51,430
all of us now,

4702
02:08:51,430 --> 02:08:52,450
and when you do that,

4703
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:53,650
you kill the probiotics.

4704
02:08:53,651 --> 02:08:55,930
And what moves in instead
in its place is yeast.

4705
02:08:56,140 --> 02:08:57,340
And the analogy that I use,

4706
02:08:57,341 --> 02:08:59,560
it's like once you get
crabgrass in your lawn,

4707
02:08:59,770 --> 02:08:59,981
you know,

4708
02:08:59,981 --> 02:09:01,300
you can sprinkle more seed.

4709
02:09:01,301 --> 02:09:03,100
Like by taking kind of probiotics,

4710
02:09:03,340 --> 02:09:04,930
you can sprinkle more seed over the lawn,

4711
02:09:04,931 --> 02:09:06,380
but it's not going to kill the crab grass.

4712
02:09:06,390 --> 02:09:08,860
They've taken up an occupied that spot.

4713
02:09:08,980 --> 02:09:10,030
So we're operating,

4714
02:09:10,031 --> 02:09:10,300
you know,

4715
02:09:10,300 --> 02:09:14,440
our natural immune cell producers are not
there in the quantity that they should

4716
02:09:14,441 --> 02:09:15,580
be that they used to be.

4717
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:16,540
And so,

4718
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:16,811
you know,

4719
02:09:16,811 --> 02:09:19,360
really taking these particular mushroom,

4720
02:09:19,630 --> 02:09:20,050
uh,

4721
02:09:20,050 --> 02:09:24,520
stimulators is one way that we can
actually build our army back up so it can

4722
02:09:24,521 --> 02:09:25,300
fight off.

4723
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:26,380
Not only the little things,

4724
02:09:26,381 --> 02:09:27,160
a little colds,

4725
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:27,941
the little flus,

4726
02:09:27,941 --> 02:09:29,650
the little stuff that we
just kind of deal with.

4727
02:09:29,890 --> 02:09:30,431
But also,

4728
02:09:30,431 --> 02:09:30,701
you know,

4729
02:09:30,701 --> 02:09:32,440
a lot of the big things start small,

4730
02:09:32,590 --> 02:09:32,861
you know,

4731
02:09:32,861 --> 02:09:35,750
different cells shed
different mutated made itself.

4732
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:38,170
A dendritic cell should
be around to just say,

4733
02:09:38,290 --> 02:09:38,471
oh,

4734
02:09:38,471 --> 02:09:39,370
that thing's fucked up.

4735
02:09:39,371 --> 02:09:40,210
I'm going to eat that.

4736
02:09:40,360 --> 02:09:41,560
But a lot of times that's,

4737
02:09:41,561 --> 02:09:45,070
and that doesn't happen just because we
don't have the available immune innate

4738
02:09:45,071 --> 02:09:46,630
response to challenge that.

4739
02:09:46,631 --> 02:09:49,580
So shrimp tech immune
combines that patented,

4740
02:09:49,670 --> 02:09:49,960
you know,

4741
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:52,360
the proprietary compound io immune,

4742
02:09:52,361 --> 02:09:53,540
which has been well studied in,

4743
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:54,580
in a bunch of the studies,

4744
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:56,140
combines it with Chaga mushroom,

4745
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:57,970
which is also another great mushroom that,

4746
02:09:57,971 --> 02:09:58,360
uh,

4747
02:09:58,360 --> 02:10:01,030
has a lot of the same triple
righthand helix Beta glucans.

4748
02:10:01,240 --> 02:10:01,391
Uh,

4749
02:10:01,391 --> 02:10:03,070
it also has Estrella NAIC acid,

4750
02:10:03,071 --> 02:10:06,070
which comes actually from the
birch tree in which it is found.

4751
02:10:06,071 --> 02:10:10,120
So wild harvested Chaga is actually
better for you than cultivated Chaga.

4752
02:10:10,270 --> 02:10:13,670
There was a dude who had some
whole video is pushing chocolate.

4753
02:10:13,690 --> 02:10:13,811
There's,

4754
02:10:13,811 --> 02:10:14,680
when I first started doing it,

4755
02:10:14,681 --> 02:10:16,510
some crazy guys tattooed all over.

4756
02:10:16,511 --> 02:10:17,770
His whole body was weird,

4757
02:10:17,771 --> 02:10:18,970
like different inks and shit.

4758
02:10:18,971 --> 02:10:20,260
So it was a mushroom specialist,

4759
02:10:20,590 --> 02:10:21,430
but he had one,

4760
02:10:21,431 --> 02:10:24,400
he had a Chaga mushroom that he's
holding up and it's like this big fucking

4761
02:10:24,670 --> 02:10:25,750
crazy looking thing,

4762
02:10:25,751 --> 02:10:25,931
man.

4763
02:10:25,931 --> 02:10:26,890
It doesn't look like a mushroom.

4764
02:10:26,891 --> 02:10:27,611
It looks weird,

4765
02:10:27,611 --> 02:10:27,761
man.

4766
02:10:27,761 --> 02:10:28,410
It looks like a,

4767
02:10:28,410 --> 02:10:29,980
a hunk of a log or something.

4768
02:10:30,040 --> 02:10:30,371
Right?

4769
02:10:30,371 --> 02:10:30,910
Yeah.

4770
02:10:30,910 --> 02:10:31,940
So weird looking at lusher.

4771
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:32,550
This yeah.

4772
02:10:32,550 --> 02:10:33,170
Grows,

4773
02:10:33,170 --> 02:10:33,770
you know,

4774
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:34,100
only

4775
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:35,630
on the birch tree naturally in the wild.

4776
02:10:35,930 --> 02:10:38,720
Mushrooms are closer to
animals and the art of plants.

4777
02:10:39,530 --> 02:10:40,280
Yeah,

4778
02:10:40,280 --> 02:10:40,491
yeah.

4779
02:10:40,491 --> 02:10:41,840
It's a very interesting species.

4780
02:10:41,870 --> 02:10:43,250
We're fucking thing around forever.

4781
02:10:43,670 --> 02:10:47,930
Organism in the world is a mushroom
colony that lives in the Pacific northwest

4782
02:10:47,931 --> 02:10:48,400
and Emma,

4783
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:51,560
Nita Barbosa I think is the
species name of that colony.

4784
02:10:51,561 --> 02:10:52,160
Is that what it is?

4785
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:53,540
The conference 37 acres,

4786
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:57,140
giant organism that like is in the ground.

4787
02:10:57,450 --> 02:10:58,220
You know,

4788
02:10:58,220 --> 02:10:59,090
it's really nuts.

4789
02:10:59,150 --> 02:10:59,661
It is Jim.

4790
02:10:59,661 --> 02:11:02,990
Imagine at 37 Acre being,

4791
02:11:03,620 --> 02:11:04,580
I mean yeah,

4792
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:07,010
you could take chunks of
it and make other beings,

4793
02:11:07,011 --> 02:11:08,450
you can import them other places,

4794
02:11:08,451 --> 02:11:10,190
but essentially it's one,

4795
02:11:10,191 --> 02:11:12,890
one sort of a being and
it's like a network,

4796
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:13,671
you know,

4797
02:11:13,671 --> 02:11:13,911
if,

4798
02:11:13,911 --> 02:11:16,310
if mushrooms really do have intelligence,

4799
02:11:16,311 --> 02:11:17,600
you know like when you eat well,

4800
02:11:17,660 --> 02:11:19,640
you know there's a lot of people that
believe that plants have a certain

4801
02:11:19,641 --> 02:11:20,330
intelligence,

4802
02:11:20,330 --> 02:11:22,160
they don't just don't have
the ability to communicate,

4803
02:11:22,610 --> 02:11:25,130
but if these mushrooms have an ability,

4804
02:11:25,160 --> 02:11:28,130
somehow our ability to communicate because
they're all connected like that and

4805
02:11:28,131 --> 02:11:30,140
they have this intelligence that
can communicate with each other.

4806
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:35,150
Like that's some incredible
like information superhighway
that's in the forest

4807
02:11:35,151 --> 02:11:35,600
up there.

4808
02:11:35,600 --> 02:11:36,200
Yeah,

4809
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:37,340
it sounds very avatar,

4810
02:11:37,341 --> 02:11:38,360
but it's very hot.

4811
02:11:38,370 --> 02:11:38,791
Yeah,

4812
02:11:38,791 --> 02:11:43,730
it does look avatars based on a lot
of like Hippie dippie woo ideas about,

4813
02:11:43,731 --> 02:11:44,061
you know,

4814
02:11:44,061 --> 02:11:44,291
the,

4815
02:11:44,291 --> 02:11:44,520
the,

4816
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:44,711
the,

4817
02:11:44,711 --> 02:11:46,100
the intelligence of plants.

4818
02:11:46,520 --> 02:11:47,660
But I've talked to people,

4819
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:49,610
I have to research
whether or not it's real,

4820
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:53,000
but like plants can tell when they're
around certain persons who have harmed

4821
02:11:53,001 --> 02:11:53,241
them.

4822
02:11:53,241 --> 02:11:53,460
You know,

4823
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:56,770
someone comes along and chops a fucking
plant with an ax and then that person's

4824
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:57,410
near the plant.

4825
02:11:57,410 --> 02:11:58,940
You can register it on a plant.

4826
02:11:59,330 --> 02:12:02,540
Don't know if there's some interesting
studies on the music influencing the

4827
02:12:02,541 --> 02:12:03,374
growth of plants,

4828
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:06,320
like death metal versus
classical real asco music.

4829
02:12:06,321 --> 02:12:06,471
Yeah.

4830
02:12:06,471 --> 02:12:08,150
There's some really
interesting studies on that.

4831
02:12:08,151 --> 02:12:09,020
How nobody likes,

4832
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:11,450
it's not even the plants.

4833
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:12,673
Even plants,

4834
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:15,290
they live in dirt and
they'd survive on cow shit,

4835
02:12:15,291 --> 02:12:17,930
but they have better
taste than death metal.

4836
02:12:18,160 --> 02:12:22,370
Something about that energy
that deal with Alpha brain is a,

4837
02:12:22,371 --> 02:12:26,210
is a very fucking polarizing
subject I've found on the Internet.

4838
02:12:26,211 --> 02:12:27,470
And so it's a fascinating thing,

4839
02:12:27,471 --> 02:12:27,980
man.

4840
02:12:27,980 --> 02:12:28,700
MMM.

4841
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:29,570
Nootropics.

4842
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:29,871
You know,

4843
02:12:29,871 --> 02:12:32,540
we've been talking about nootropics on
my message board for like the longest

4844
02:12:32,541 --> 02:12:35,810
time and I've been experimenting
with them for years,

4845
02:12:36,140 --> 02:12:38,840
but until we started getting in the
business of actually selling them,

4846
02:12:38,841 --> 02:12:41,120
I didn't realize how country
people can deal with this things.

4847
02:12:41,570 --> 02:12:41,841
But,

4848
02:12:41,841 --> 02:12:42,674
um,

4849
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:43,910
one of the criticisms,

4850
02:12:43,911 --> 02:12:45,170
and I think there's some legitimacy.

4851
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:48,860
This is the way it's marketed
and one of the things is,

4852
02:12:48,861 --> 02:12:49,670
um,

4853
02:12:49,670 --> 02:12:50,300
and you know,

4854
02:12:50,300 --> 02:12:52,250
it's not on purpose.

4855
02:12:52,340 --> 02:12:52,970
I don't think,

4856
02:12:52,970 --> 02:12:53,211
uh,

4857
02:12:53,211 --> 02:12:57,680
I think what the way you set it up was
you just trying to be enthusiastic about

4858
02:12:57,681 --> 02:12:57,860
it.

4859
02:12:57,860 --> 02:13:00,380
And the problem with
somebody once said that,

4860
02:13:00,830 --> 02:13:01,490
uh,

4861
02:13:01,490 --> 02:13:02,510
I forgot where I wrote this.

4862
02:13:02,850 --> 02:13:03,061
I,

4863
02:13:03,061 --> 02:13:03,210
I've,

4864
02:13:03,210 --> 02:13:03,370
I've,

4865
02:13:03,370 --> 02:13:03,950
I've,

4866
02:13:03,950 --> 02:13:05,060
I believe I read it today,

4867
02:13:05,070 --> 02:13:05,320
something,

4868
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:06,590
it might've been on the message board,

4869
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:11,300
but it was about in first impression that
it's very difficult to take that back.

4870
02:13:11,330 --> 02:13:15,440
And once you create something and you
put something out there and people get an

4871
02:13:15,441 --> 02:13:16,400
idea who you are,

4872
02:13:16,550 --> 02:13:21,350
it's very difficult for them to
correct that and normalize and come.

4873
02:13:21,590 --> 02:13:24,200
So you have to be really careful
what your initial first thing is.

4874
02:13:24,470 --> 02:13:28,670
And one of the things that we get
criticized with is this Guy Steve Novella,

4875
02:13:29,060 --> 02:13:29,391
who's,

4876
02:13:29,391 --> 02:13:30,224
um,

4877
02:13:30,590 --> 02:13:30,860
I dunno,

4878
02:13:30,860 --> 02:13:31,920
some super smart dude.

4879
02:13:32,340 --> 02:13:32,851
There's some,

4880
02:13:32,851 --> 02:13:33,960
what do you know what,

4881
02:13:33,961 --> 02:13:34,794
what,

4882
02:13:34,890 --> 02:13:35,161
what,

4883
02:13:35,161 --> 02:13:35,880
uh,

4884
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:36,181
yeah,

4885
02:13:36,181 --> 02:13:37,280
he was Ashley's from,

4886
02:13:37,430 --> 02:13:37,950
uh,

4887
02:13:37,950 --> 02:13:38,780
thought it was,

4888
02:13:38,780 --> 02:13:39,090
yeah,

4889
02:13:39,090 --> 02:13:40,680
maybe perhaps Yale University.

4890
02:13:40,681 --> 02:13:41,514
He's a,

4891
02:13:41,910 --> 02:13:42,661
he doesn't say,

4892
02:13:42,661 --> 02:13:43,890
but essentially what he's,

4893
02:13:43,891 --> 02:13:46,290
he's criticizing the way that the,

4894
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:47,153
um,

4895
02:13:47,850 --> 02:13:49,440
that the way that it's marketed,

4896
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:51,870
the way there's a studies
were put out there.

4897
02:13:52,700 --> 02:13:53,533
Yeah.

4898
02:13:53,740 --> 02:13:53,951
You know,

4899
02:13:53,951 --> 02:13:56,140
I think looking at that criticism I think,

4900
02:13:56,170 --> 02:13:57,850
and any variety of criticism,

4901
02:13:57,851 --> 02:13:58,240
I mean,

4902
02:13:58,240 --> 02:13:58,730
I think,

4903
02:13:58,730 --> 02:13:59,563
uh,

4904
02:13:59,710 --> 02:14:02,260
you have to just learn and
adapt and get better from it.

4905
02:14:02,261 --> 02:14:03,094
And I think he,

4906
02:14:03,220 --> 02:14:05,530
I think he has a very skeptical mindset,

4907
02:14:05,531 --> 02:14:08,230
which I think in a lot of
avenues is very positive.

4908
02:14:08,231 --> 02:14:08,980
But I think,

4909
02:14:08,980 --> 02:14:09,251
you know,

4910
02:14:09,251 --> 02:14:10,120
it can be overdone.

4911
02:14:10,121 --> 02:14:11,770
He actually runs a few shows called,

4912
02:14:11,930 --> 02:14:12,190
you know,

4913
02:14:12,190 --> 02:14:13,030
the skeptic,

4914
02:14:13,330 --> 02:14:13,810
um,

4915
02:14:13,810 --> 02:14:16,420
some skeptic hour or some
variety of different things.

4916
02:14:16,421 --> 02:14:18,040
So he has that kind of framework in mind.

4917
02:14:18,041 --> 02:14:18,731
But you know,

4918
02:14:18,731 --> 02:14:20,380
some of his criticisms are fair,

4919
02:14:20,410 --> 02:14:20,681
you know,

4920
02:14:20,681 --> 02:14:21,430
really,

4921
02:14:21,430 --> 02:14:22,060
and what,

4922
02:14:22,060 --> 02:14:22,390
you know,

4923
02:14:22,390 --> 02:14:23,890
taking that criticism and you know,

4924
02:14:23,891 --> 02:14:28,080
a lot of criticism from the board that
even if it's very negatively put a

4925
02:14:28,100 --> 02:14:29,380
applying that has helped,

4926
02:14:29,470 --> 02:14:30,100
I believe,

4927
02:14:30,100 --> 02:14:30,460
you know,

4928
02:14:30,460 --> 02:14:31,420
us to become better,

4929
02:14:31,421 --> 02:14:34,690
at least myself as a person to become
better as far as marketing that.

4930
02:14:34,720 --> 02:14:35,531
And you know,

4931
02:14:35,531 --> 02:14:38,290
there's certain areas that you got to
shore up and you gotta be tighter and you

4932
02:14:38,291 --> 02:14:42,520
got to be better and really
try and present information
so that just people have

4933
02:14:42,521 --> 02:14:45,370
as much information as possible
can make educated decisions.

4934
02:14:45,610 --> 02:14:45,941
I mean,

4935
02:14:45,941 --> 02:14:46,181
the,

4936
02:14:46,181 --> 02:14:49,720
the many people who take Alpha
brain and about amazing results,

4937
02:14:49,900 --> 02:14:50,141
you know,

4938
02:14:50,141 --> 02:14:50,974
that is,

4939
02:14:51,030 --> 02:14:52,360
that will be evidence for,

4940
02:14:52,630 --> 02:14:52,871
you know,

4941
02:14:52,871 --> 02:14:54,340
for a lot of people to give it a try.

4942
02:14:54,341 --> 02:14:54,881
And you know,

4943
02:14:54,881 --> 02:14:55,810
if they don't like it,

4944
02:14:56,080 --> 02:14:56,411
then,

4945
02:14:56,411 --> 02:14:56,651
uh,

4946
02:14:56,651 --> 02:14:59,230
then they can get their money back and
they don't even have to send the bottle

4947
02:14:59,231 --> 02:14:59,651
back in.

4948
02:14:59,651 --> 02:15:02,500
We'll give you your money back on your
first bottle without even sending it in.

4949
02:15:02,550 --> 02:15:03,810
Some people have,

4950
02:15:03,811 --> 02:15:03,991
um,

4951
02:15:03,991 --> 02:15:05,910
a lot of people have
experienced positive results.

4952
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:08,430
I S I personally experienced
positive results.

4953
02:15:08,431 --> 02:15:09,510
I use it every day.

4954
02:15:09,540 --> 02:15:10,373
I enjoy it.

4955
02:15:10,470 --> 02:15:11,490
I think it makes a difference.

4956
02:15:11,491 --> 02:15:12,330
When I don't take it,

4957
02:15:12,331 --> 02:15:13,164
I feel it.

4958
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:13,740
Um,

4959
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:14,730
it's not a huge difference,

4960
02:15:14,731 --> 02:15:15,421
but it's something,

4961
02:15:15,421 --> 02:15:16,350
it's a clarity.

4962
02:15:16,380 --> 02:15:17,820
I believe in it 100%.

4963
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:18,590
And I've,

4964
02:15:18,590 --> 02:15:18,810
I've,

4965
02:15:18,810 --> 02:15:19,920
I've really like,

4966
02:15:19,970 --> 02:15:20,370
um,

4967
02:15:20,370 --> 02:15:22,080
just like with the quadriceps
mushroom supplement,

4968
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:23,760
I work out a lot.

4969
02:15:23,790 --> 02:15:24,930
I eat really healthy.

4970
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:28,830
I know for the most part what's going
on with my body and I feel I can feel

4971
02:15:28,831 --> 02:15:29,401
differences.

4972
02:15:29,401 --> 02:15:30,690
I know when I'm tired,

4973
02:15:30,870 --> 02:15:31,050
you know,

4974
02:15:31,050 --> 02:15:32,070
because of too much,

4975
02:15:32,071 --> 02:15:32,371
you know,

4976
02:15:32,371 --> 02:15:33,450
not enough sleep,

4977
02:15:33,451 --> 02:15:34,021
too much work,

4978
02:15:34,021 --> 02:15:34,380
whatever.

4979
02:15:34,380 --> 02:15:38,450
I know when things are in sync and when
things are in sync and I've taken out

4980
02:15:38,451 --> 02:15:39,090
for brain,

4981
02:15:39,090 --> 02:15:39,960
I feel boost.

4982
02:15:39,961 --> 02:15:40,920
I feel a difference.

4983
02:15:41,460 --> 02:15:41,730
Um,

4984
02:15:41,730 --> 02:15:42,780
but other people know,

4985
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:44,010
other people don't.

4986
02:15:44,011 --> 02:15:45,330
Not only do they not feel something,

4987
02:15:45,331 --> 02:15:46,164
they get sick.

4988
02:15:46,230 --> 02:15:49,710
Like I've talked to people online and
there's too many of them to ignore it,

4989
02:15:49,711 --> 02:15:51,060
but they say it made him feel like shit.

4990
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:51,691
You know,

4991
02:15:51,691 --> 02:15:52,524
what does that,

4992
02:15:52,540 --> 02:15:52,740
I,

4993
02:15:52,740 --> 02:15:56,060
there's a certain sensitivity to
pursue serrato which is creating an

4994
02:15:56,061 --> 02:15:57,110
acetylcholine boost.

4995
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:57,831
And,

4996
02:15:57,831 --> 02:15:58,460
um,

4997
02:15:58,460 --> 02:15:58,821
you know,

4998
02:15:58,821 --> 02:15:59,870
that's something that,

4999
02:15:59,900 --> 02:16:02,510
that we're addressing and
in future form and it's not,

5000
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:05,360
it will actually make
somebody feel potentially,

5001
02:16:05,370 --> 02:16:06,740
and this is our only,

5002
02:16:06,770 --> 02:16:06,951
you know,

5003
02:16:06,951 --> 02:16:08,630
this is our best estimation
of what's happening,

5004
02:16:08,631 --> 02:16:11,570
but it seems like the case when
they take too big of a dose,

5005
02:16:11,730 --> 02:16:11,970
uh,

5006
02:16:11,970 --> 02:16:15,560
the Acetylcholine levels get
to get basically two high end.

5007
02:16:15,860 --> 02:16:16,611
I tell people,

5008
02:16:16,611 --> 02:16:17,444
take one,

5009
02:16:17,450 --> 02:16:18,021
take one,

5010
02:16:18,021 --> 02:16:18,791
start off with one.

5011
02:16:18,791 --> 02:16:19,070
Yeah,

5012
02:16:19,070 --> 02:16:20,150
it's best to be conservative.

5013
02:16:20,151 --> 02:16:20,361
I mean,

5014
02:16:20,361 --> 02:16:22,100
this is no wonder without food,

5015
02:16:22,101 --> 02:16:22,430
what do you,

5016
02:16:22,430 --> 02:16:23,263
how do you recommend it

5017
02:16:23,850 --> 02:16:24,211
meal?

5018
02:16:24,211 --> 02:16:25,560
Especially if you're on a,

5019
02:16:25,561 --> 02:16:27,120
especially if you're on taking one,

5020
02:16:27,140 --> 02:16:27,331
you know,

5021
02:16:27,331 --> 02:16:28,200
maybe a very,

5022
02:16:28,260 --> 02:16:30,040
not a completely dead empty stomach,

5023
02:16:30,041 --> 02:16:30,550
but you should,

5024
02:16:30,550 --> 02:16:32,770
if you pile it on to a giant cheeseburger,

5025
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:33,041
you know,

5026
02:16:33,041 --> 02:16:34,420
you've got so much stuff going on,

5027
02:16:34,421 --> 02:16:37,280
it's going to be very difficult and
it might just get pushed through.

5028
02:16:37,281 --> 02:16:39,460
But does it enhance its
absorption using food?

5029
02:16:39,760 --> 02:16:40,150
Um,

5030
02:16:40,150 --> 02:16:40,391
no.

5031
02:16:40,391 --> 02:16:42,780
It's just an enhances
its tolerability too.

5032
02:16:42,910 --> 02:16:43,750
To a certain degree.

5033
02:16:43,751 --> 02:16:44,620
It doesn't bother me at all.

5034
02:16:44,621 --> 02:16:45,570
I take it on an empty stomach.

5035
02:16:45,610 --> 02:16:46,181
I do too.

5036
02:16:46,181 --> 02:16:46,571
I do too.

5037
02:16:46,571 --> 02:16:46,901
But it's,

5038
02:16:46,901 --> 02:16:47,320
it's,

5039
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:47,531
you know,

5040
02:16:47,531 --> 02:16:49,660
some people that may
actually enhance the effects.

5041
02:16:49,661 --> 02:16:51,010
So until you get,

5042
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:52,570
until you get kind of comfortable with it,

5043
02:16:52,720 --> 02:16:54,670
I think definitely best
to be conservative,

5044
02:16:54,671 --> 02:16:55,990
invest to take some breaks to,

5045
02:16:55,991 --> 02:16:56,170
you know,

5046
02:16:56,170 --> 02:16:57,040
start with one.

5047
02:16:57,230 --> 02:16:57,760
Um,

5048
02:16:57,760 --> 02:17:00,190
see how you feel and you don't
have to take it every day.

5049
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:01,870
What percentage of
people do you think are,

5050
02:17:02,020 --> 02:17:03,820
have a sensitivity to it?

5051
02:17:03,821 --> 02:17:04,970
It's a very small percentage,

5052
02:17:04,971 --> 02:17:05,800
a small percentage.

5053
02:17:05,800 --> 02:17:05,981
I mean,

5054
02:17:05,981 --> 02:17:08,620
overwhelmingly the response has
been positive and we get that.

5055
02:17:08,621 --> 02:17:09,371
We get those people,

5056
02:17:09,371 --> 02:17:10,060
all those people,

5057
02:17:10,060 --> 02:17:10,271
you know,

5058
02:17:10,271 --> 02:17:12,040
contact us for their money back.

5059
02:17:12,041 --> 02:17:13,870
We give them their money
back and it's a very,

5060
02:17:13,871 --> 02:17:14,860
very small percent.

5061
02:17:14,861 --> 02:17:15,101
I mean,

5062
02:17:15,101 --> 02:17:15,281
our,

5063
02:17:15,281 --> 02:17:16,000
our,

5064
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:20,830
that rate I would have to say is
less than one out of every 200.

5065
02:17:20,980 --> 02:17:21,401
But you know,

5066
02:17:21,401 --> 02:17:21,601
the,

5067
02:17:21,601 --> 02:17:21,971
it is,

5068
02:17:21,971 --> 02:17:25,060
it is definitely a bummer and it's
something we want to address and at least,

5069
02:17:25,061 --> 02:17:28,330
especially by telling people to start
conservative with their dosage and then

5070
02:17:28,331 --> 02:17:29,650
taking a look at,

5071
02:17:29,680 --> 02:17:30,100
um,

5072
02:17:30,100 --> 02:17:32,410
at the Hoop Herzliya Serrata
and we actually have,

5073
02:17:32,640 --> 02:17:32,831
you know,

5074
02:17:32,831 --> 02:17:34,720
have some things in mind for the proper,

5075
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:35,080
you know,

5076
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:36,410
proper balances of see,

5077
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:41,480
oh Perseus Durata to GPC calling to make
sure that those are going to be better

5078
02:17:41,741 --> 02:17:42,574
tolerated,

5079
02:17:42,700 --> 02:17:43,180
um,

5080
02:17:43,180 --> 02:17:44,590
throughout the future of Alpha brain.

5081
02:17:44,590 --> 02:17:45,423
So,

5082
02:17:45,460 --> 02:17:45,910
you know,

5083
02:17:45,910 --> 02:17:47,140
hopefully just like I said,

5084
02:17:47,141 --> 02:17:47,351
you know,

5085
02:17:47,351 --> 02:17:48,480
you learn and a,

5086
02:17:48,490 --> 02:17:51,550
you try and improve and be the
best product for everybody.

5087
02:17:51,700 --> 02:17:52,750
I think for some people,

5088
02:17:52,751 --> 02:17:53,021
you know,

5089
02:17:53,021 --> 02:17:53,711
it won't work.

5090
02:17:53,711 --> 02:17:54,580
And for some people,

5091
02:17:54,710 --> 02:17:55,060
uh,

5092
02:17:55,060 --> 02:17:55,691
they may not,

5093
02:17:55,691 --> 02:17:57,100
they may have an adverse reaction,

5094
02:17:57,101 --> 02:17:57,660
but,

5095
02:17:57,660 --> 02:17:57,910
you know,

5096
02:17:57,910 --> 02:18:01,020
the overwhelming majority is
spoken very positively and it's,

5097
02:18:01,230 --> 02:18:01,420
you know,

5098
02:18:01,420 --> 02:18:02,860
it's great to hear that feedback from,

5099
02:18:02,861 --> 02:18:03,400
uh,

5100
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:06,820
from the product is one of the
dudes who's on the message board.

5101
02:18:06,870 --> 02:18:07,150
Uh,

5102
02:18:07,150 --> 02:18:09,400
his name is James MMA,

5103
02:18:09,580 --> 02:18:10,780
very bright guy,

5104
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:11,730
and he's a,

5105
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:13,840
one of the skeptics are critics.

5106
02:18:14,140 --> 02:18:16,510
And you had a conversation with him about,

5107
02:18:16,570 --> 02:18:17,320
uh,

5108
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:18,370
he'd asked you,

5109
02:18:18,640 --> 02:18:18,851
you know,

5110
02:18:18,851 --> 02:18:19,100
how,

5111
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:21,790
how it works improving cognitive function.

5112
02:18:21,791 --> 02:18:22,900
Like what the fuck could does?

5113
02:18:23,230 --> 02:18:23,881
And we,

5114
02:18:23,881 --> 02:18:24,471
you said the,

5115
02:18:24,471 --> 02:18:27,580
basically that Alpha brain is designed
to provide the precursors and raw

5116
02:18:27,581 --> 02:18:31,600
nutrients necessary to raise levels
of important neurotransmitters such as

5117
02:18:31,601 --> 02:18:33,520
Acetylcholine and dopamine and Gaba.

5118
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:34,480
Now,

5119
02:18:34,480 --> 02:18:36,010
how is that done?

5120
02:18:36,100 --> 02:18:36,491
What is,

5121
02:18:36,491 --> 02:18:36,851
what does it,

5122
02:18:36,851 --> 02:18:41,851
what's the mechanism that allows it to
raise these levels of these important

5123
02:18:42,011 --> 02:18:42,940
neurotransmitters?

5124
02:18:43,600 --> 02:18:43,871
Well,

5125
02:18:43,871 --> 02:18:44,860
it's just depends on,

5126
02:18:44,930 --> 02:18:45,370
uh,

5127
02:18:45,370 --> 02:18:46,870
which neurotransmitter
you're talking about.

5128
02:18:46,871 --> 02:18:49,570
But if you're talking about acetylcholine
and we come at that in two fronts.

5129
02:18:49,810 --> 02:18:50,471
The GPC,

5130
02:18:50,471 --> 02:18:54,310
Coleen is one of the raw
nutrients involved in the
production of Acetylcholine.

5131
02:18:54,311 --> 02:18:56,920
So by providing the more
of the raw ingredient,

5132
02:18:57,100 --> 02:18:58,840
it allows the body to produce more.

5133
02:18:58,990 --> 02:18:59,741
And then who Percy.

5134
02:18:59,741 --> 02:19:01,390
Serratus is coming at a different angle.

5135
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:03,730
That's actually a inhibiting.

5136
02:19:03,910 --> 02:19:04,743
Um,

5137
02:19:05,350 --> 02:19:06,760
it's actually inhibiting the,

5138
02:19:06,790 --> 02:19:10,120
the amount of Acetylcholine
at the body breaks down.

5139
02:19:10,300 --> 02:19:14,830
So it's providing more acetylcholine
from a kind of a different angle by

5140
02:19:14,831 --> 02:19:19,420
actually creating a surplus of what
you currently have rather than the,

5141
02:19:19,600 --> 02:19:20,920
than the GPC calling,

5142
02:19:20,921 --> 02:19:21,790
which is creating,

5143
02:19:21,990 --> 02:19:22,720
um,

5144
02:19:22,720 --> 02:19:26,320
more raw material to provide
the acetylcholine and the other,

5145
02:19:26,321 --> 02:19:30,020
the other neurotransmitters fall more
along the lines of the GPC Coleen,

5146
02:19:30,021 --> 02:19:33,830
where you're just providing the raw
nutrients to allow the body to take the

5147
02:19:33,831 --> 02:19:38,831
steps to produce those raw nutrients and
turn those into the neuro transmitters.

5148
02:19:39,230 --> 02:19:40,790
And this is actually another thing.

5149
02:19:40,791 --> 02:19:43,070
This is the foundation
of the new mood formula,

5150
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:44,210
which is providing,

5151
02:19:44,240 --> 02:19:44,421
you know,

5152
02:19:44,421 --> 02:19:48,410
there's four major neurotransmitters
as identified by Dr Braverman.

5153
02:19:48,650 --> 02:19:49,100
Um,

5154
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:54,100
and the other one is serotonin and
five HTP is the direct precursor to

5155
02:19:55,371 --> 02:19:56,204
Serotonin.

5156
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:59,000
And in the same way in that product,

5157
02:19:59,140 --> 02:19:59,420
uh,

5158
02:19:59,420 --> 02:20:03,650
by providing the raw nutrient that
the body then converts into Serotonin,

5159
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:07,130
you create a surplus of
serotonin without having to take,

5160
02:20:07,310 --> 02:20:07,700
um,

5161
02:20:07,700 --> 02:20:09,350
any other kind of prescription drugs.

5162
02:20:09,410 --> 02:20:12,560
And there's actually a cool study on
that front to illustrate the point.

5163
02:20:12,561 --> 02:20:17,270
There's actually been a bit more research
on the serotonin effect because of the

5164
02:20:17,420 --> 02:20:21,680
massive amounts of Ssri and
prescription drugs in that field.

5165
02:20:21,870 --> 02:20:22,110
Uh,

5166
02:20:22,110 --> 02:20:24,950
there's been a good amount
of study done on five HTP.

5167
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:30,040
Dr Pollinger had a study in 1991 where
he compared five HTP to fluvoxamine,

5168
02:20:30,261 --> 02:20:31,940
which is a Ssri.

5169
02:20:32,270 --> 02:20:37,100
And the study showed that the SSRI
stands for selective Serotonin reuptake

5170
02:20:37,101 --> 02:20:39,650
inhibitor and that's
like Zoloft and Prozac.

5171
02:20:39,980 --> 02:20:40,813
Paxil.

5172
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:41,420
Yup.

5173
02:20:41,420 --> 02:20:42,140
And um,

5174
02:20:42,140 --> 02:20:45,350
and basically it showed
that the five HTP dosage,

5175
02:20:45,351 --> 02:20:47,240
which was a hundred
milligrams a few times a day,

5176
02:20:47,241 --> 02:20:50,810
was equal to the
fluvoxamine and of efficacy,

5177
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:53,270
but far out paced it as far as tolerance,

5178
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:58,310
just because the body was
able to go through its natural
process and create more

5179
02:20:58,520 --> 02:21:00,290
of its serotonin and a,

5180
02:21:00,300 --> 02:21:02,120
the study turned out extremely positively.

5181
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:05,240
The problem is that there is no
patent available on five HTP.

5182
02:21:05,570 --> 02:21:06,261
So you know,

5183
02:21:06,261 --> 02:21:07,430
everybody can go out and get it.

5184
02:21:07,431 --> 02:21:08,450
They can buy our product,

5185
02:21:08,451 --> 02:21:11,960
they can buy anybody else's product
and get those similar effects.

5186
02:21:11,961 --> 02:21:12,400
So

5187
02:21:12,400 --> 02:21:16,810
I found out about five HTP for my friend
Neil Brennan and a Neil told me he's on

5188
02:21:16,811 --> 02:21:16,941
it.

5189
02:21:16,941 --> 02:21:17,561
And he loves it.

5190
02:21:17,561 --> 02:21:18,394
It makes him feel good.

5191
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:20,380
But Neal's also on an antidepressant.

5192
02:21:20,530 --> 02:21:20,651
Well,

5193
02:21:20,651 --> 02:21:25,570
his doctor told him to get off the
five HTP and stay on the antidepressant

5194
02:21:25,571 --> 02:21:29,860
because he said taking the five HTP is
like taking a second antidepressant.

5195
02:21:30,370 --> 02:21:31,121
So I said to him,

5196
02:21:31,121 --> 02:21:31,430
I was like,

5197
02:21:31,430 --> 02:21:32,263
whoa.

5198
02:21:32,410 --> 02:21:34,750
Have you ever thought about
just taking the five HTP?

5199
02:21:34,751 --> 02:21:35,584
Is that possible?

5200
02:21:35,650 --> 02:21:38,200
Because it seems like that might be
the better move than to have to get a

5201
02:21:38,201 --> 02:21:42,910
prescription for some shit and like you'd
get five HTP to fucking GNC store in

5202
02:21:42,911 --> 02:21:43,661
the middle of Omaha,

5203
02:21:43,661 --> 02:21:44,231
Nebraska,

5204
02:21:44,231 --> 02:21:45,940
just show up and get me
and you can be on the road.

5205
02:21:46,090 --> 02:21:49,150
It's not like you're saddled down to a
fucking pharmacy and you need to have

5206
02:21:49,151 --> 02:21:51,820
your doctor call in a prescription
during business hours.

5207
02:21:52,170 --> 02:21:52,320
Well,

5208
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:52,920
it's annoying.

5209
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:56,580
Dr Pollinger study shows a lot
of those ancillary benefits of,

5210
02:21:56,690 --> 02:21:57,210
you know,

5211
02:21:57,210 --> 02:22:02,090
not taking a prescription drug versus
taking the natural drug and you can look

5212
02:22:02,110 --> 02:22:02,250
up,

5213
02:22:02,250 --> 02:22:03,950
does it have the same
effect for everybody?

5214
02:22:04,790 --> 02:22:06,950
Five HTP for everybody boosts Serotonin?

5215
02:22:07,070 --> 02:22:07,580
It does,

5216
02:22:07,580 --> 02:22:07,881
yeah.

5217
02:22:07,881 --> 02:22:08,720
It definitely boosts search.

5218
02:22:08,730 --> 02:22:09,410
I mean,

5219
02:22:09,410 --> 02:22:10,970
how can you say something for everybody?

5220
02:22:10,971 --> 02:22:13,220
But in the people studied in the
many studies that they've done,

5221
02:22:13,221 --> 02:22:14,540
five HTP has shown,

5222
02:22:14,670 --> 02:22:14,991
you know,

5223
02:22:14,991 --> 02:22:16,430
a dramatic improvement in those,

5224
02:22:16,610 --> 02:22:18,200
in those serotonin dependent,

5225
02:22:18,390 --> 02:22:18,860
um,

5226
02:22:18,860 --> 02:22:19,580
issues being,

5227
02:22:19,580 --> 02:22:21,230
and the new mood is mixed with fo,

5228
02:22:21,270 --> 02:22:21,720
uh,

5229
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:22,970
El Tryptofan as well.

5230
02:22:22,990 --> 02:22:23,220
Yeah,

5231
02:22:23,220 --> 02:22:23,720
ultra map.

5232
02:22:23,720 --> 02:22:26,220
So the chain reaction goes l Tryptophan

5233
02:22:26,220 --> 02:22:30,180
converts to five HTP and then
five HTP converts to five HTP,

5234
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:31,200
five ht,

5235
02:22:31,350 --> 02:22:32,610
which is actually serotonin.

5236
02:22:32,730 --> 02:22:34,080
If you ingested pure five,

5237
02:22:34,081 --> 02:22:36,570
ht the body would destroy it
and it wouldn't get anywhere.

5238
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:38,250
But following it through the chain,

5239
02:22:38,340 --> 02:22:39,600
the body's able to do that.

5240
02:22:39,601 --> 02:22:42,150
Especially with the help of
vitamin B six pyridoxine,

5241
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:42,700
uh,

5242
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:46,560
it's able to kind of complete that chain
reaction of El Tryptophan to becoming

5243
02:22:46,561 --> 02:22:47,580
five HTP,

5244
02:22:47,640 --> 02:22:48,870
two becoming serotonin.

5245
02:22:48,871 --> 02:22:53,871
So new mood is pretty unique in that it
has both El Tryptophan and five HTP as

5246
02:22:54,301 --> 02:22:56,010
well as the catalyst vitamin B six.

5247
02:22:56,011 --> 02:22:56,520
So,

5248
02:22:56,520 --> 02:22:57,353
um,

5249
02:22:57,660 --> 02:22:59,190
I'd love to study this in the future.

5250
02:22:59,310 --> 02:23:02,090
The theory behind it being
that we're creating both in,

5251
02:23:02,130 --> 02:23:02,430
you know,

5252
02:23:02,430 --> 02:23:07,410
more immediate transition between the
five HTP to five ht and then a longer term

5253
02:23:07,411 --> 02:23:11,910
transition between the l Tryptophan
to the five HTP to the five ht.

5254
02:23:12,150 --> 02:23:15,150
So kind of providing a further
spectrum along the chain.

5255
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:18,180
And then we also combine it with
a bunch of [inaudible] herbs,

5256
02:23:18,300 --> 02:23:20,550
herbs to kind of relax you and um,

5257
02:23:20,760 --> 02:23:21,241
you know,

5258
02:23:21,241 --> 02:23:22,950
help you help with insomnia.

5259
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:23,821
One of our herbs,

5260
02:23:23,821 --> 02:23:25,860
Valerian actually has a similar study,

5261
02:23:25,861 --> 02:23:30,861
that study done by Dr
Pollinger as comparing it to
an over the counter and not

5262
02:23:31,231 --> 02:23:33,460
an over a prescription
drug called [inaudible],

5263
02:23:33,810 --> 02:23:36,360
which is in the same category of a Benzo.

5264
02:23:36,361 --> 02:23:36,881
It's a Benzo,

5265
02:23:36,881 --> 02:23:38,460
it's same category as Xanax.

5266
02:23:38,760 --> 02:23:39,480
Um,

5267
02:23:39,480 --> 02:23:44,280
and it compared Valerian to Oxa possum
with the similar results to the five HTP

5268
02:23:44,281 --> 02:23:44,581
study.

5269
02:23:44,581 --> 02:23:46,670
Being that Valerian had the same anxiety,

5270
02:23:46,720 --> 02:23:49,260
alytic insomnia reducing effects,

5271
02:23:49,470 --> 02:23:51,600
but without the negative
side effects of that.

5272
02:23:51,601 --> 02:23:55,410
So that's another powerful herb and the
combination and a few others as well,

5273
02:23:55,530 --> 02:24:00,360
just to kind of ease your body into
a state of relaxation and positive

5274
02:24:00,570 --> 02:24:03,270
neurotransmitter boosting fundamentals.

5275
02:24:03,870 --> 02:24:06,340
A homeboy had another
question and this was a,

5276
02:24:06,370 --> 02:24:07,111
the same dude,

5277
02:24:07,111 --> 02:24:08,190
this James Omega,

5278
02:24:08,191 --> 02:24:10,080
I think he had a really good point about,

5279
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:12,200
he's saying that your claim was that,

5280
02:24:12,260 --> 02:24:12,780
uh,

5281
02:24:12,780 --> 02:24:14,610
Alpha brain enhances memory focus,

5282
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:16,440
mental speed and mental drive.

5283
02:24:16,530 --> 02:24:17,363
Uh,

5284
02:24:17,400 --> 02:24:18,900
and he said,

5285
02:24:18,901 --> 02:24:19,734
can we meant,

5286
02:24:20,010 --> 02:24:22,170
can we rename mental drive to motivation?

5287
02:24:22,410 --> 02:24:22,831
First of all,

5288
02:24:22,831 --> 02:24:22,950
the,

5289
02:24:22,950 --> 02:24:23,250
you know,

5290
02:24:23,250 --> 02:24:24,120
mental drive was like,

5291
02:24:24,121 --> 02:24:24,391
God,

5292
02:24:24,391 --> 02:24:25,410
how subjective is that?

5293
02:24:25,411 --> 02:24:27,040
Like who can say what's,

5294
02:24:27,390 --> 02:24:27,660
you know,

5295
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:28,471
how you're driven.

5296
02:24:28,471 --> 02:24:28,920
I mean,

5297
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:30,150
even if it gives you like clarity,

5298
02:24:30,151 --> 02:24:31,890
does it actually drive you sort?

5299
02:24:32,080 --> 02:24:32,510
Right,

5300
02:24:32,510 --> 02:24:32,820
right.

5301
02:24:32,820 --> 02:24:33,480
Sure.

5302
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:34,313
Um,

5303
02:24:34,770 --> 02:24:35,580
so he's saying,

5304
02:24:35,580 --> 02:24:40,470
would you say that those four are all of
what Alpha brain is supposed to do is,

5305
02:24:40,471 --> 02:24:44,970
are other effects of which you want
your product to claim than that?

5306
02:24:44,971 --> 02:24:45,510
Okay.

5307
02:24:45,510 --> 02:24:46,780
Then I'd like to hear them as well.

5308
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:48,290
Right now he's Kinda being nit picky.

5309
02:24:48,500 --> 02:24:48,650
The

5310
02:24:48,650 --> 02:24:49,040
dream,

5311
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:51,080
the dream effect is
something that a lot of our,

5312
02:24:51,250 --> 02:24:51,910
our,

5313
02:24:51,910 --> 02:24:52,340
you know,

5314
02:24:52,340 --> 02:24:53,720
the takers really enjoy.

5315
02:24:53,721 --> 02:24:54,920
And that's caused by,

5316
02:24:54,921 --> 02:24:55,101
you know,

5317
02:24:55,101 --> 02:24:56,480
I think I mentioned this in the last time,

5318
02:24:56,481 --> 02:25:00,380
but that's caused by acetylcholine
being the regulator of the rem state.

5319
02:25:00,710 --> 02:25:02,690
So with more Acetylcholine,

5320
02:25:02,691 --> 02:25:06,290
you have a deeper and broader rem
state and rem being the dream state,

5321
02:25:06,440 --> 02:25:11,000
you're able to access longer periods
of that dreaming unconsciousness for,

5322
02:25:11,060 --> 02:25:11,390
you know,

5323
02:25:11,390 --> 02:25:12,140
so to speak,

5324
02:25:12,140 --> 02:25:16,040
and also have more of a chance of
turning those dreams lucid because of the

5325
02:25:16,190 --> 02:25:18,410
breadth of the dream state that you're in.

5326
02:25:18,411 --> 02:25:22,370
And also waking up during one of those
states in which you will remember your

5327
02:25:22,371 --> 02:25:25,150
dreams a lot better than if you wake
up during one of the really deep,

5328
02:25:25,330 --> 02:25:25,961
Slow Wave,

5329
02:25:25,961 --> 02:25:27,010
non dreaming sleeps.

5330
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:31,060
This is theoretical or is it a sextant
improving you can as far as waking up

5331
02:25:31,061 --> 02:25:32,200
during rem sleep drink,

5332
02:25:32,250 --> 02:25:34,220
they proven the dreams
happen during rem state.

5333
02:25:34,350 --> 02:25:34,500
Right.

5334
02:25:34,500 --> 02:25:35,333
And that's what I mean.

5335
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:38,890
And they've proven that when
you wake up during rem sleep,

5336
02:25:39,100 --> 02:25:42,340
you're more likely to remember your
dreams and when you wake up during slow

5337
02:25:42,341 --> 02:25:42,641
wave.

5338
02:25:42,641 --> 02:25:45,730
And how does the Acetylcholine
play into that though?

5339
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:46,870
Was it an improvement?

5340
02:25:46,900 --> 02:25:50,920
Has drink that's kind of
your cycles are regulated by,

5341
02:25:51,070 --> 02:25:51,791
by the brain.

5342
02:25:51,791 --> 02:25:53,320
Unconsciously as it goes through.

5343
02:25:53,321 --> 02:25:57,850
And acetylcholine is they found one of
the triggers for actually triggering the

5344
02:25:57,851 --> 02:25:57,990
Di,

5345
02:25:57,990 --> 02:25:58,210
you know,

5346
02:25:58,210 --> 02:26:01,360
slow wave versus a rem verses,

5347
02:26:01,390 --> 02:26:01,571
you know,

5348
02:26:01,571 --> 02:26:02,650
interphase one or two,

5349
02:26:02,660 --> 02:26:03,190
whatever,

5350
02:26:03,190 --> 02:26:04,023
whatever that is.

5351
02:26:04,150 --> 02:26:08,080
Acetylcholine is the trigger that actually
triggers the length of rem sleep that

5352
02:26:08,081 --> 02:26:08,800
you have.

5353
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:10,780
So if you have more
acetylcholine available,

5354
02:26:10,781 --> 02:26:13,690
it's going to trigger a
longer and deeper rem sleep.

5355
02:26:13,730 --> 02:26:16,390
Should you take Alpha brain at
night to enhance your sleep.

5356
02:26:16,391 --> 02:26:18,130
Does that make sense or is it bullshit?

5357
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:20,380
It was a lot of people
say it makes them buzzy.

5358
02:26:20,710 --> 02:26:21,101
Yeah,

5359
02:26:21,101 --> 02:26:22,120
I wouldn't take it at night.

5360
02:26:22,121 --> 02:26:23,410
I don't think you need
to take it at night.

5361
02:26:23,411 --> 02:26:24,730
I think if you take it during the day,

5362
02:26:24,731 --> 02:26:28,270
your levels are still going to be
enhanced for for quite a while.

5363
02:26:28,271 --> 02:26:30,430
So I don't like to take it at night.

5364
02:26:30,530 --> 02:26:32,800
The latest I'll take it
would be around three,

5365
02:26:32,801 --> 02:26:36,580
four o'clock because there is a kind
of a stimulatory effect from the

5366
02:26:36,581 --> 02:26:37,750
Acetylcholine as well.

5367
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:39,700
And Rm is not the deepest,

5368
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:40,150
you know,

5369
02:26:40,150 --> 02:26:40,990
part of your sleep.

5370
02:26:40,991 --> 02:26:42,400
It's actually one of the lighter parts.

5371
02:26:42,401 --> 02:26:43,000
It's not.

5372
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,260
So it will,

5373
02:26:44,290 --> 02:26:44,710
you know,

5374
02:26:44,710 --> 02:26:46,360
I do like to take it a little bit earlier.

5375
02:26:46,361 --> 02:26:49,720
I still get that dream kind of
the wild dream boost where um,

5376
02:26:50,020 --> 02:26:50,231
you know,

5377
02:26:50,231 --> 02:26:53,590
like the other night where I was pulling
a hammerhead shark out of a swimming

5378
02:26:53,591 --> 02:26:57,040
pool and doing a variety
of different crazy things.

5379
02:26:57,270 --> 02:26:57,610
Um,

5380
02:26:57,610 --> 02:26:58,480
I still get that boost,

5381
02:26:58,481 --> 02:27:01,300
taking it early in the day and I
think a lot of people will as well.

5382
02:27:01,300 --> 02:27:02,380
But um,

5383
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:04,210
I would recommend that more than anything.

5384
02:27:04,211 --> 02:27:06,310
And then taking something
like the new mood,

5385
02:27:06,430 --> 02:27:09,250
you would take that at night to kind
of relax you and still make sure you're

5386
02:27:09,251 --> 02:27:11,800
getting the most out of the restorative
parts of your sleep as well.

5387
02:27:11,950 --> 02:27:12,311
To me,

5388
02:27:12,311 --> 02:27:15,520
it seems like one of my dreams
aren't so cool when I'm tired,

5389
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:16,780
when I'm really beat down.

5390
02:27:16,781 --> 02:27:17,860
I've been doing a lot of traveling.

5391
02:27:17,861 --> 02:27:18,250
They don't,

5392
02:27:18,250 --> 02:27:19,750
they don't hit me with this big,

5393
02:27:20,050 --> 02:27:20,441
you know,

5394
02:27:20,441 --> 02:27:22,690
really a bizarre,

5395
02:27:22,691 --> 02:27:24,520
realistic style dreams.

5396
02:27:24,730 --> 02:27:27,730
But what I'm really well rested and
I'm taking the Alpha and that's what I

5397
02:27:27,731 --> 02:27:28,041
noticed.

5398
02:27:28,041 --> 02:27:29,290
A really freaky fucking dreams.

5399
02:27:29,291 --> 02:27:29,740
Yeah,

5400
02:27:29,740 --> 02:27:30,381
that's what I like.

5401
02:27:30,381 --> 02:27:30,850
They're like,

5402
02:27:30,850 --> 02:27:31,271
they're like,

5403
02:27:31,271 --> 02:27:33,190
so there are so durable.

5404
02:27:33,460 --> 02:27:34,510
Like in the middle of the dream,

5405
02:27:34,511 --> 02:27:37,090
you wake up knowing that you're in the
dream and somehow they're staying in the

5406
02:27:37,091 --> 02:27:37,924
dream.

5407
02:27:38,580 --> 02:27:41,050
Find that more when I'm well rested,

5408
02:27:41,470 --> 02:27:42,303
when I'm healthy,

5409
02:27:42,920 --> 02:27:43,930
I guess then you know,

5410
02:27:43,931 --> 02:27:44,231
you're,

5411
02:27:44,231 --> 02:27:47,710
you're calm or I guess I don't know what
it do when you're drawing to that as

5412
02:27:47,711 --> 02:27:48,910
needy when you're sleeping,

5413
02:27:49,030 --> 02:27:53,050
your body might be pushing you into more
deeper restorative kind of physically

5414
02:27:53,051 --> 02:27:54,160
restorative sleep.

5415
02:27:54,430 --> 02:27:56,410
When you're in that
kind of run down state,

5416
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:57,790
in which case you aren't having,

5417
02:27:57,791 --> 02:27:59,080
even with the Alpha brain present,

5418
02:27:59,081 --> 02:28:03,310
you aren't having that kind of length
of rem and breadth of rem sleep.

5419
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:05,710
So it was one of the things
this guy is saying is,

5420
02:28:05,711 --> 02:28:06,130
uh,

5421
02:28:06,130 --> 02:28:06,940
sometimes,

5422
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:07,120
uh,

5423
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:10,660
justice a something I do know via
my own studies in neuroscience,

5424
02:28:10,661 --> 02:28:14,050
the vast majority of people to not
have a particular deficiency in

5425
02:28:14,051 --> 02:28:14,920
Acetylcholine,

5426
02:28:16,420 --> 02:28:17,590
dopamine or Gaba.

5427
02:28:18,640 --> 02:28:19,001
Well,

5428
02:28:19,001 --> 02:28:19,361
there's,

5429
02:28:19,361 --> 02:28:19,541
you know,

5430
02:28:19,541 --> 02:28:21,140
there's certainly
different theories on that.

5431
02:28:21,141 --> 02:28:21,411
I mean,

5432
02:28:21,411 --> 02:28:22,130
I think,

5433
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:22,490
uh,

5434
02:28:22,490 --> 02:28:24,890
in the optimal state of
being with perfect diet,

5435
02:28:24,891 --> 02:28:25,670
perfect sleep,

5436
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:26,000
you know,

5437
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:26,330
good,

5438
02:28:26,330 --> 02:28:26,901
good health,

5439
02:28:26,901 --> 02:28:28,610
good workouts and all of that.

5440
02:28:28,611 --> 02:28:30,230
Probably your optimally functioning.

5441
02:28:30,420 --> 02:28:30,770
Um,

5442
02:28:30,770 --> 02:28:32,180
does that mean that you know,

5443
02:28:32,181 --> 02:28:36,050
going above optimal functioning is okay
from time to time and actually has some

5444
02:28:36,051 --> 02:28:36,980
benefit and value?

5445
02:28:37,190 --> 02:28:37,941
I believe it does.

5446
02:28:37,941 --> 02:28:38,774
I believe you can,

5447
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:41,570
even if you are naturally
healthy at a baseline,

5448
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:41,931
you know,

5449
02:28:41,931 --> 02:28:43,760
we're not kind of trying
to cover deficiency,

5450
02:28:43,761 --> 02:28:45,110
we're not trying to cure disease,

5451
02:28:45,260 --> 02:28:48,770
we're trying to give people a
feeling of boost that can help them,

5452
02:28:49,040 --> 02:28:49,281
you know,

5453
02:28:49,281 --> 02:28:51,290
function in maneuver and
accomplish their goals,

5454
02:28:51,291 --> 02:28:52,910
whatever very they may be.

5455
02:28:52,910 --> 02:28:53,600
So,

5456
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:54,051
you know,

5457
02:28:54,051 --> 02:28:55,550
I think that a,

5458
02:28:55,551 --> 02:28:56,500
I do think that norm,

5459
02:28:56,590 --> 02:29:00,800
a lot of people are a little bit run
down and I know I rely on Dr Braverman of

5460
02:29:00,801 --> 02:29:03,010
the brain Princeton brain bio.

5461
02:29:03,090 --> 02:29:07,310
He did a lot of work there and he's doing
a lot of active work now as the basis

5462
02:29:07,311 --> 02:29:08,510
for kind of my thinking on this.

5463
02:29:08,511 --> 02:29:11,840
But he did a bunch of tests on
me and I'm a fairly healthy dude.

5464
02:29:11,841 --> 02:29:14,270
I eat well and I do my
best to stay in shape.

5465
02:29:14,450 --> 02:29:18,170
But all of my levels of neurotransmitters
were actually depressed below.

5466
02:29:18,230 --> 02:29:19,011
And before,

5467
02:29:19,011 --> 02:29:19,940
before I went to see him,

5468
02:29:19,941 --> 02:29:20,810
I had been doing a little,

5469
02:29:21,020 --> 02:29:21,260
you know,

5470
02:29:21,260 --> 02:29:22,850
doing a little party
and he was in New York.

5471
02:29:22,851 --> 02:29:25,160
So I saw some buddies in New
York went out to the bars.

5472
02:29:25,400 --> 02:29:26,001
And you know,

5473
02:29:26,001 --> 02:29:29,840
it made sense to me that
my neurotransmitters were
functioning at a lower level

5474
02:29:29,841 --> 02:29:30,350
at that point.

5475
02:29:30,350 --> 02:29:31,071
Cause I could feel it.

5476
02:29:31,071 --> 02:29:31,970
I was kind of cloudy,

5477
02:29:31,971 --> 02:29:32,804
kind of groggy.

5478
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:35,720
And he pointed to that in all
of the myriad tests he did.

5479
02:29:35,721 --> 02:29:37,490
We did tests over five days,

5480
02:29:37,491 --> 02:29:40,280
blood tests in different cognitive
tests and different things.

5481
02:29:40,520 --> 02:29:41,320
Um,

5482
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:41,590
and,

5483
02:29:41,590 --> 02:29:42,171
and found that,

5484
02:29:42,171 --> 02:29:44,060
and I think a lot of
people operate on that.

5485
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:44,480
You know,

5486
02:29:44,480 --> 02:29:47,150
just by the lifestyles that they live,

5487
02:29:47,151 --> 02:29:50,810
the operating this state where they're
under a lot of stress and they're under a

5488
02:29:50,811 --> 02:29:51,644
lot of,

5489
02:29:51,710 --> 02:29:52,220
you know,

5490
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:53,053
different,

5491
02:29:53,210 --> 02:29:53,660
uh,

5492
02:29:53,660 --> 02:29:54,110
you know,

5493
02:29:54,110 --> 02:29:57,800
different things like caffeine and
alcohol and these things that are causing

5494
02:29:58,010 --> 02:29:59,360
adrenaline and different,

5495
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:03,470
different functionality to happen so
that there are more people who have at

5496
02:30:03,471 --> 02:30:06,620
least temporary deficiencies in
a lot of these neurotransmitters.

5497
02:30:06,830 --> 02:30:08,180
And then for the people who don't,

5498
02:30:08,450 --> 02:30:09,080
you know,

5499
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:11,900
getting this extra boost might
just be a little bit over the top.

5500
02:30:12,020 --> 02:30:12,141
Well,

5501
02:30:12,141 --> 02:30:13,290
how many people actually get them,

5502
02:30:13,470 --> 02:30:15,380
get it actually tested.

5503
02:30:15,410 --> 02:30:19,100
That's why I get uncomfortable when
someone says that the majority of people

5504
02:30:19,101 --> 02:30:21,230
don't have particularly
deficiency and Acetylcholine,

5505
02:30:21,500 --> 02:30:23,930
the majority of people aren't
tested for Acetylcholine deficiency.

5506
02:30:23,931 --> 02:30:25,040
Not and a lot of people,

5507
02:30:25,041 --> 02:30:25,760
a lot of people who,

5508
02:30:25,760 --> 02:30:26,790
if you could talk to them or anything,

5509
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:29,610
the majority of people aren't
tested for fucking vitamin B.

5510
02:30:29,610 --> 02:30:29,660
Yeah.

5511
02:30:29,660 --> 02:30:32,450
Tony Know How many people get blood
work to check their vitamin levels.

5512
02:30:32,451 --> 02:30:33,030
How many people are,

5513
02:30:33,030 --> 02:30:33,560
you know,

5514
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:34,940
very few actually with violence.

5515
02:30:35,180 --> 02:30:36,590
Isn't that the only way to tell it?

5516
02:30:36,591 --> 02:30:36,981
Is it,

5517
02:30:36,981 --> 02:30:37,590
is it actually

5518
02:30:37,590 --> 02:30:38,131
vitamin D?

5519
02:30:38,131 --> 02:30:41,550
They're finding massive deficiencies
when they're actually doing large scale

5520
02:30:41,551 --> 02:30:42,384
testing on that.

5521
02:30:42,460 --> 02:30:42,940
So

5522
02:30:42,940 --> 02:30:45,070
it's very hard to tell
someone saying that.

5523
02:30:45,071 --> 02:30:45,550
It's just a,

5524
02:30:45,550 --> 02:30:46,600
that's a bullshit thing to say.

5525
02:30:46,660 --> 02:30:47,493
Right,

5526
02:30:47,570 --> 02:30:48,403
right.

5527
02:30:48,580 --> 02:30:50,780
But there are certainly a
lot of healthy people and,

5528
02:30:50,870 --> 02:30:51,440
and,

5529
02:30:51,440 --> 02:30:52,070
and you know,

5530
02:30:52,070 --> 02:30:53,360
they may have adequate levels,

5531
02:30:53,361 --> 02:30:57,380
but it's still doesn't invalidate
the point of having an out for brain.

5532
02:30:57,381 --> 02:31:00,230
I do still do think that
you can feel even better.

5533
02:31:00,260 --> 02:31:00,771
You know what I mean?

5534
02:31:00,771 --> 02:31:03,830
These are nutrients that are going
to drive you in a certain direction.

5535
02:31:03,831 --> 02:31:04,520
So,

5536
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:04,701
you know,

5537
02:31:04,701 --> 02:31:06,230
there's kind of both
sides of the coin there,

5538
02:31:06,231 --> 02:31:06,710
I guess,

5539
02:31:06,710 --> 02:31:07,670
depending on how you look at it.

5540
02:31:07,930 --> 02:31:10,930
And here's the subtle yet conti
last questions that he has.

5541
02:31:10,931 --> 02:31:14,230
I'm curious as to why it took so long
to answer this question given that you

5542
02:31:14,231 --> 02:31:15,370
answered questions before.

5543
02:31:15,371 --> 02:31:19,470
And I asked this one quite like this
before I ask this one on questions after

5544
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:21,600
when it should be the easiest
question for you to answer.

5545
02:31:22,170 --> 02:31:23,730
That's a Kentucky question,

5546
02:31:23,731 --> 02:31:24,240
sir.

5547
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:27,300
That belays that exposes your,

5548
02:31:27,330 --> 02:31:28,440
your country nature.

5549
02:31:28,590 --> 02:31:32,220
That is a [inaudible] and his
fucking photo of who is that

5550
02:31:32,290 --> 02:31:32,471
guy?

5551
02:31:32,471 --> 02:31:33,304
What's that guy's name?

5552
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:33,990
The,

5553
02:31:33,990 --> 02:31:34,823
um,

5554
02:31:34,910 --> 02:31:36,400
the author?

5555
02:31:36,520 --> 02:31:36,920
No,

5556
02:31:36,920 --> 02:31:37,930
looks like Ben Stiller.

5557
02:31:38,110 --> 02:31:39,730
Sam a something or other,

5558
02:31:39,731 --> 02:31:40,564
um,

5559
02:31:41,010 --> 02:31:42,550
letters to a Christian nation.

5560
02:31:42,790 --> 02:31:43,720
What the fuck's the guy's name,

5561
02:31:47,320 --> 02:31:49,570
but he's got an intellectual,

5562
02:31:49,960 --> 02:31:50,231
you know,

5563
02:31:50,231 --> 02:31:51,070
I certainly,

5564
02:31:51,071 --> 02:31:52,840
I appreciate all the challenges that,

5565
02:31:52,890 --> 02:31:53,651
that people have.

5566
02:31:53,651 --> 02:31:54,380
I think it's,

5567
02:31:54,380 --> 02:31:54,640
you know,

5568
02:31:54,640 --> 02:31:56,140
it's good to think about all these things.

5569
02:31:56,141 --> 02:31:56,501
And I,

5570
02:31:56,501 --> 02:31:57,200
you know,

5571
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:57,480
Sam,

5572
02:31:57,480 --> 02:31:59,580
as much criticism is as a,

5573
02:31:59,590 --> 02:32:01,330
I get personally on it gets,

5574
02:32:01,331 --> 02:32:03,670
I think ultimately if you take kind of,

5575
02:32:03,910 --> 02:32:04,150
you know,

5576
02:32:04,150 --> 02:32:05,800
what you may call the
crunchiness out of it,

5577
02:32:05,801 --> 02:32:06,430
there's,

5578
02:32:06,430 --> 02:32:10,800
this is kind of like real reflection on
yourself that you can take a gaze at.

5579
02:32:10,801 --> 02:32:11,860
It's like fighters who,

5580
02:32:11,980 --> 02:32:12,160
you know,

5581
02:32:12,160 --> 02:32:14,850
either you either train with people
who all love you and care about you.

5582
02:32:14,851 --> 02:32:18,370
You go with savages that want to
kill you and take your head off.

5583
02:32:18,371 --> 02:32:18,820
Well,

5584
02:32:18,820 --> 02:32:20,350
you'll learn more from the savages,

5585
02:32:20,380 --> 02:32:20,691
you know,

5586
02:32:20,691 --> 02:32:21,820
and you'll learn how to,

5587
02:32:22,030 --> 02:32:23,530
you learn different things about yourself,

5588
02:32:23,531 --> 02:32:24,910
holes in your game and weaknesses.

5589
02:32:24,911 --> 02:32:25,420
So,

5590
02:32:25,420 --> 02:32:25,691
uh,

5591
02:32:25,691 --> 02:32:25,901
you know,

5592
02:32:25,901 --> 02:32:27,490
I think actually you even talking to you,

5593
02:32:27,491 --> 02:32:29,230
it's not an easy thing to learn,

5594
02:32:29,231 --> 02:32:33,610
but learning to just take the meat of
the criticisms and try and not take the,

5595
02:32:33,611 --> 02:32:33,970
uh,

5596
02:32:33,970 --> 02:32:34,990
the barbs of it.

5597
02:32:35,050 --> 02:32:36,310
So it's hard,

5598
02:32:36,311 --> 02:32:36,521
you know,

5599
02:32:36,521 --> 02:32:39,280
I know you kind of created a
lot of what the website is,

5600
02:32:39,380 --> 02:32:40,071
but you know,

5601
02:32:40,071 --> 02:32:41,750
I go to the website and
there's certain stuff.

5602
02:32:41,751 --> 02:32:42,081
I look,

5603
02:32:42,081 --> 02:32:42,470
I don't go,

5604
02:32:42,470 --> 02:32:44,000
it's a little fucking marketing,

5605
02:32:44,220 --> 02:32:44,531
you know,

5606
02:32:44,531 --> 02:32:44,930
it was a little,

5607
02:32:44,930 --> 02:32:45,750
you know what I mean?

5608
02:32:45,750 --> 02:32:46,010
I,

5609
02:32:46,010 --> 02:32:46,361
we'll,

5610
02:32:46,361 --> 02:32:46,550
we'll,

5611
02:32:46,550 --> 02:32:47,271
we'll go over it.

5612
02:32:47,271 --> 02:32:51,050
We'll go over it because I don't
personally think it needs to be that way.

5613
02:32:51,080 --> 02:32:52,520
I think the product stands on its own.

5614
02:32:52,521 --> 02:32:54,800
And I think the subject
is very interesting.

5615
02:32:55,070 --> 02:32:58,520
And what I always tell people on the
program as you just look into nootropics,

5616
02:32:58,521 --> 02:32:58,940
I mean,

5617
02:32:58,940 --> 02:33:00,500
this is one of the reasons
why I wanted to have you,

5618
02:33:00,501 --> 02:33:00,741
uh,

5619
02:33:00,741 --> 02:33:03,810
address some of the shit
that that's been said and um,

5620
02:33:03,980 --> 02:33:07,280
and let people know there's no evidence
whatsoever that any of this stuff was

5621
02:33:07,281 --> 02:33:07,761
dangerous,

5622
02:33:07,761 --> 02:33:08,290
right?

5623
02:33:08,290 --> 02:33:08,740
No.

5624
02:33:08,740 --> 02:33:11,860
What happened to roll on and
roll off what's been kind of

5625
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:14,433
mood is taking,

5626
02:33:14,600 --> 02:33:17,740
he's taking over the rollover
and it'd become a mess.

5627
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:18,230
Another,

5628
02:33:18,230 --> 02:33:20,050
the partying aspect people don't have,

5629
02:33:20,560 --> 02:33:21,970
those are the origins of this,

5630
02:33:22,420 --> 02:33:22,841
of this,

5631
02:33:22,841 --> 02:33:23,320
uh,

5632
02:33:23,320 --> 02:33:24,153
experiment.

5633
02:33:24,160 --> 02:33:26,240
People for whatever reason have a,

5634
02:33:26,290 --> 02:33:26,850
you know,

5635
02:33:26,850 --> 02:33:27,301
if you,

5636
02:33:27,301 --> 02:33:29,020
you can't be a serious person.

5637
02:33:29,050 --> 02:33:32,110
So rollovers pretty much the shroom tech.

5638
02:33:32,140 --> 02:33:32,620
Uh,

5639
02:33:32,620 --> 02:33:33,290
no.

5640
02:33:33,290 --> 02:33:38,020
And then what's role on now anything
Rolando Kinda got divided into two aspects

5641
02:33:38,021 --> 02:33:39,760
that it was trying to do
too many things at once.

5642
02:33:39,761 --> 02:33:43,210
So the shroom tech sport provides that
kind of energy element and then the

5643
02:33:43,211 --> 02:33:46,390
shroom tech immune provides the
health element that was missed.

5644
02:33:46,391 --> 02:33:47,890
That was the second component.

5645
02:33:47,891 --> 02:33:49,930
So that's kind of been divided into two,

5646
02:33:50,050 --> 02:33:50,883
right?

5647
02:33:50,980 --> 02:33:52,150
Problem is,

5648
02:33:52,151 --> 02:33:52,620
um,

5649
02:33:52,620 --> 02:33:55,840
a lot of people automatically
assume that people are full of shit.

5650
02:33:56,110 --> 02:33:56,980
And uh,

5651
02:33:57,040 --> 02:34:00,790
when you have any thing that
they can criticize anything,

5652
02:34:00,791 --> 02:34:01,200
any,

5653
02:34:01,200 --> 02:34:03,850
any weakness in the link that
they can point to and go,

5654
02:34:03,880 --> 02:34:04,061
oh,

5655
02:34:04,061 --> 02:34:05,710
he sells fucking Alpha nails.

5656
02:34:06,170 --> 02:34:06,600
Yeah.

5657
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:07,021
Hey,

5658
02:34:07,021 --> 02:34:07,854
let me see your nails.

5659
02:34:08,140 --> 02:34:09,450
You doesn't have Alpha nails on.

5660
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:10,993
Totally normal.

5661
02:34:11,100 --> 02:34:11,401
I mean,

5662
02:34:11,401 --> 02:34:12,234
come on man.

5663
02:34:12,390 --> 02:34:14,940
It's Alpha nails is like a
Saturday night live sketch.

5664
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:16,411
Well,

5665
02:34:16,411 --> 02:34:17,500
you know how that developed.

5666
02:34:17,501 --> 02:34:17,911
I was,

5667
02:34:17,911 --> 02:34:18,140
you know,

5668
02:34:18,140 --> 02:34:18,611
I was glad to,

5669
02:34:18,611 --> 02:34:23,080
fighters were a lot of fun and instill
and I'm one of my best friends is Roger,

5670
02:34:23,081 --> 02:34:26,470
where today we are talking about it and
all of these fighters still have to go

5671
02:34:26,471 --> 02:34:31,471
to that Sally Jensen Aisle
in the supermarket and buy
those dainty little nail

5672
02:34:31,811 --> 02:34:32,644
Polish

5673
02:34:33,820 --> 02:34:34,900
nail Polish.

5674
02:34:34,990 --> 02:34:35,823
They don't but,

5675
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:36,550
but they,

5676
02:34:36,550 --> 02:34:37,390
but they can do it.

5677
02:34:37,391 --> 02:34:38,224
So they do

5678
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:41,980
well there are some benefits.

5679
02:34:41,981 --> 02:34:43,090
Some of the fighters say that,

5680
02:34:43,110 --> 02:34:43,320
you know,

5681
02:34:43,320 --> 02:34:45,970
they put it on their toes because if
they'd been stomped in the toe and their

5682
02:34:45,990 --> 02:34:46,930
nails gonna fall off,

5683
02:34:46,931 --> 02:34:48,640
it'll hide that potential damage.

5684
02:34:48,820 --> 02:34:50,460
Some people just say it and you know,

5685
02:34:50,910 --> 02:34:51,430
I don't know.

5686
02:34:51,430 --> 02:34:55,330
There's a few practical reasons also that
it prevents chipping and kind of your

5687
02:34:55,331 --> 02:34:56,410
nail from breaking,

5688
02:34:56,411 --> 02:34:57,700
coming apart and having a tiny,

5689
02:34:57,970 --> 02:35:02,970
well it's kind of like putting a coat
of glue over the top of your frank Trigg

5690
02:35:02,981 --> 02:35:06,550
started using and they used to call
them twinkle toes trig because he would

5691
02:35:07,150 --> 02:35:09,040
paint up his nails like to protect the,

5692
02:35:09,050 --> 02:35:11,710
they can use clear coat,

5693
02:35:11,711 --> 02:35:12,910
but they don't use clear coat.

5694
02:35:12,911 --> 02:35:16,420
They use pink because why the fuck not
because they're fighters in anybody who

5695
02:35:16,480 --> 02:35:18,130
says they're gay or not.

5696
02:35:18,131 --> 02:35:18,730
So,

5697
02:35:18,730 --> 02:35:19,180
uh,

5698
02:35:19,180 --> 02:35:19,690
but it's,

5699
02:35:19,690 --> 02:35:19,961
you know,

5700
02:35:19,961 --> 02:35:20,241
it's,

5701
02:35:20,241 --> 02:35:23,290
it's something that we kind of developed
as a different alternative for that,

5702
02:35:23,291 --> 02:35:24,041
but it,

5703
02:35:24,041 --> 02:35:24,281
you know,

5704
02:35:24,281 --> 02:35:24,701
it's funny.

5705
02:35:24,701 --> 02:35:25,520
People will,

5706
02:35:25,520 --> 02:35:25,841
you know,

5707
02:35:25,841 --> 02:35:26,740
people get pretty,

5708
02:35:26,741 --> 02:35:27,910
pretty serious about,

5709
02:35:27,911 --> 02:35:28,360
uh,

5710
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:28,930
about,

5711
02:35:28,930 --> 02:35:29,763
you know,

5712
02:35:29,890 --> 02:35:31,460
criticizing Islam variety.

5713
02:35:31,461 --> 02:35:33,460
There's some beautiful
dopiness right here.

5714
02:35:33,461 --> 02:35:35,380
This is discontinuous,

5715
02:35:35,570 --> 02:35:36,820
his guys talking about a

5716
02:35:36,900 --> 02:35:37,441
Alpha brand.

5717
02:35:37,441 --> 02:35:37,711
He goes,

5718
02:35:37,711 --> 02:35:39,360
if you're under 35 and you take it,

5719
02:35:39,361 --> 02:35:40,470
you're effectively throwing,

5720
02:35:40,471 --> 02:35:43,830
you're perfectly balanced
neurotransmitter levels out of balance.

5721
02:35:43,980 --> 02:35:44,580
Hmm.

5722
02:35:44,580 --> 02:35:48,570
I wonder if that's and capital the reason
why some people say it makes them sick

5723
02:35:48,571 --> 02:35:49,500
or it doesn't work.

5724
02:35:49,560 --> 02:35:50,310
Ugh.

5725
02:35:50,310 --> 02:35:55,140
Just the sick typical business tactics
that virtually everyone in the industry

5726
02:35:55,141 --> 02:35:55,974
uses.

5727
02:35:56,280 --> 02:35:58,050
Like you dumb fuck,

5728
02:35:58,051 --> 02:35:59,610
are you not listening to any of this?

5729
02:35:59,611 --> 02:36:00,930
You fucking shithead.

5730
02:36:01,080 --> 02:36:04,350
There's some people it can benefit
stupid and if you don't like it,

5731
02:36:04,500 --> 02:36:06,210
you don't have to focus on it.

5732
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:07,440
If it's not your thing,

5733
02:36:07,441 --> 02:36:08,340
you don't have to get into it.

5734
02:36:08,341 --> 02:36:10,790
But people are looking for
something to point a finger on.

5735
02:36:10,810 --> 02:36:11,040
Sure.

5736
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:13,350
There's a lot of people out there
that are looking to be empowered by

5737
02:36:13,351 --> 02:36:14,520
criticizing the,

5738
02:36:14,540 --> 02:36:17,820
it'd be be empowered by pointing
a finger if you don't like it,

5739
02:36:17,821 --> 02:36:19,080
don't buy it stupid.

5740
02:36:19,081 --> 02:36:20,790
And if you're under 35 and you take it,

5741
02:36:20,820 --> 02:36:22,230
oh cause you've done extensive studies,

5742
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:24,180
you know the exact time
when people need it.

5743
02:36:24,360 --> 02:36:24,751
Shut up.

5744
02:36:24,751 --> 02:36:25,380
Stupid.

5745
02:36:25,380 --> 02:36:26,220
You just being a cunt.

5746
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:26,581
Yeah.

5747
02:36:26,581 --> 02:36:26,760
I was

5748
02:36:26,760 --> 02:36:29,550
well under 35 when I was
studied and certainly not a,

5749
02:36:29,580 --> 02:36:33,090
not a large candidate for it and I was
shown to be deficient in a variety of

5750
02:36:33,091 --> 02:36:34,810
these neurotransmitters and I was um,

5751
02:36:34,950 --> 02:36:35,850
I promise I was,

5752
02:36:35,880 --> 02:36:36,151
you know,

5753
02:36:36,151 --> 02:36:36,421
as,

5754
02:36:36,421 --> 02:36:39,090
as healthy or healthier than
a good amount of people.

5755
02:36:39,091 --> 02:36:42,330
So will we ever see on it
in stores like absolutely.

5756
02:36:42,331 --> 02:36:44,130
We're working on trying to get my dad on.

5757
02:36:44,131 --> 02:36:44,964
Yeah.

5758
02:36:45,620 --> 02:36:47,990
We'll send it to him
man and sell it to him.

5759
02:36:48,110 --> 02:36:48,960
I meant to send it to them.

5760
02:36:49,020 --> 02:36:51,430
[inaudible] dad's money,

5761
02:36:52,460 --> 02:36:53,293
Bro.

5762
02:36:54,220 --> 02:36:54,781
Bro.

5763
02:36:54,781 --> 02:36:55,800
Come on Daddy.

5764
02:36:55,920 --> 02:36:58,830
They'll always be the advantage of buying
it directly from us because we'll be

5765
02:36:58,831 --> 02:37:02,760
able to honor that money back guarantee
that it will be up to the stores if you

5766
02:37:02,761 --> 02:37:03,630
buy it in the stores.

5767
02:37:03,631 --> 02:37:04,290
But um,

5768
02:37:04,290 --> 02:37:05,550
you need to get that on Amazon,

5769
02:37:05,551 --> 02:37:06,090
man.

5770
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:07,770
Amazon's just so easy nowadays.

5771
02:37:07,830 --> 02:37:10,170
Just like with food items on,

5772
02:37:10,171 --> 02:37:11,790
if any of the grocery
items you can have it.

5773
02:37:11,791 --> 02:37:14,730
So it's sets every month just to
automatically send you certain items.

5774
02:37:14,731 --> 02:37:15,980
Like I do it with coconut

5775
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:17,390
water and stuff like that.

5776
02:37:17,391 --> 02:37:18,201
It's so nice.

5777
02:37:18,201 --> 02:37:19,034
It's like

5778
02:37:19,060 --> 02:37:20,530
gifts every Joe,

5779
02:37:20,531 --> 02:37:21,364
I'm sorry,

5780
02:37:22,170 --> 02:37:23,003
what Brian,

5781
02:37:23,010 --> 02:37:23,820
is that you?

5782
02:37:23,820 --> 02:37:24,653
Are you there

5783
02:37:26,720 --> 02:37:27,553
anyway?

5784
02:37:28,300 --> 02:37:29,680
We want to talk about nothing.

5785
02:37:30,130 --> 02:37:30,963
Okay guys,

5786
02:37:31,380 --> 02:37:32,213
I've got to fucking,

5787
02:37:32,260 --> 02:37:33,910
I got a message board filled with idiots.

5788
02:37:34,870 --> 02:37:35,141
Why?

5789
02:37:35,141 --> 02:37:37,830
I think barring other
comedians jokes onstage.

5790
02:37:37,870 --> 02:37:38,560
Okay,

5791
02:37:38,560 --> 02:37:41,980
I should pick this guy just cause
it's so fucking stupid either.

5792
02:37:41,981 --> 02:37:43,030
He's trolling.

5793
02:37:43,240 --> 02:37:45,130
First of all I know's
will be controversial,

5794
02:37:45,160 --> 02:37:46,390
but hear me out.

5795
02:37:46,630 --> 02:37:49,270
I think it's okay to borrow other
comedians material we could stand up.

5796
02:37:49,271 --> 02:37:50,890
Comedy is a performance art.

5797
02:37:51,050 --> 02:37:52,120
They does it in all caps.

5798
02:37:52,240 --> 02:37:55,780
Why is it when idiots want to make a
point and they think it's profound.

5799
02:37:55,781 --> 02:37:56,860
They put it in all caps.

5800
02:37:57,010 --> 02:37:58,090
Oh it's a performance art.

5801
02:37:58,480 --> 02:37:58,781
Shut up.

5802
02:37:58,781 --> 02:37:59,081
Stupid.

5803
02:37:59,081 --> 02:38:01,270
It's dealing joke that simple.

5804
02:38:01,900 --> 02:38:04,110
He's got a thing about Dennis
leery about talking about.

5805
02:38:04,120 --> 02:38:04,690
Great Dennis.

5806
02:38:04,690 --> 02:38:05,170
Hilarious.

5807
02:38:05,170 --> 02:38:08,740
I could hardly handle your message
board and mark as currently hat waiter

5808
02:38:08,741 --> 02:38:09,010
anymore.

5809
02:38:09,010 --> 02:38:12,580
Some girl the other day on our guy on
Twitter the other day ask my girlfriend if

5810
02:38:12,581 --> 02:38:16,720
she would like to be kidnapped
and raped for a couple of days.

5811
02:38:16,740 --> 02:38:17,511
But what do you think bro?

5812
02:38:17,511 --> 02:38:18,850
You put it out there in the podcast.

5813
02:38:18,851 --> 02:38:19,684
What to expect.

5814
02:38:19,870 --> 02:38:20,031
No,

5815
02:38:20,031 --> 02:38:20,140
no,

5816
02:38:20,140 --> 02:38:20,560
no.

5817
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:23,080
This is a guy that doesn't
know about me or anything.

5818
02:38:23,190 --> 02:38:26,800
This is just a creepy gag cause he does
it to a lot of girls and they look at,

5819
02:38:27,730 --> 02:38:29,580
you look at his Twitter and
he's just like this angry.

5820
02:38:29,581 --> 02:38:29,771
You're like,

5821
02:38:29,771 --> 02:38:30,011
man,

5822
02:38:30,011 --> 02:38:32,350
what if I'd fought for a chick to say,

5823
02:38:32,351 --> 02:38:34,720
yeah come come fuck raped
the shit out of me son.

5824
02:38:36,930 --> 02:38:37,570
I don't know.

5825
02:38:37,570 --> 02:38:40,600
I almost wonder like would it be cool
to like have like your own Internet?

5826
02:38:40,601 --> 02:38:42,400
Like like it's a friends
list of your Internet.

5827
02:38:42,401 --> 02:38:43,480
So like everything,

5828
02:38:43,530 --> 02:38:45,280
well that's sort of what it is on Twitter.

5829
02:38:45,281 --> 02:38:46,510
You know when you block somebody's,

5830
02:38:46,511 --> 02:38:48,640
you know you find shit has you block them.

5831
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:49,620
That's sort of what it is.

5832
02:38:49,640 --> 02:38:52,510
The message board when Shit
heads pop up you block them.

5833
02:38:52,750 --> 02:38:54,820
You know what bothers me man,

5834
02:38:54,821 --> 02:38:58,630
is just the numbers on the message
board or are so great at this point,

5835
02:38:58,780 --> 02:38:58,961
right?

5836
02:38:58,961 --> 02:39:01,210
It's like it's gotten to such
a crazy point where there's,

5837
02:39:01,390 --> 02:39:03,670
there's over 6 million
posts on this fucking bored,

5838
02:39:03,910 --> 02:39:04,390
you know,

5839
02:39:04,390 --> 02:39:05,440
or 5 million,

5840
02:39:05,441 --> 02:39:07,990
798,000 that's crazy.

5841
02:39:08,140 --> 02:39:09,130
So many people,

5842
02:39:09,340 --> 02:39:11,110
it's so hard to keep
track of it but it's so,

5843
02:39:11,140 --> 02:39:11,973
it's so hard to,

5844
02:39:12,070 --> 02:39:15,040
which you got to do is just weed out
the cons when you find weeds and your

5845
02:39:15,041 --> 02:39:15,551
grass,

5846
02:39:15,551 --> 02:39:16,870
just pull them out and pluck them.

5847
02:39:17,350 --> 02:39:20,800
But there's so many of them and there's
so many trolls are so many people that

5848
02:39:20,801 --> 02:39:22,120
are just doing it for reactions.

5849
02:39:22,121 --> 02:39:23,470
Even my friends like a non,

5850
02:39:23,770 --> 02:39:24,370
he just,

5851
02:39:24,370 --> 02:39:26,730
he trolls all the time
and I just look at this,

5852
02:39:26,740 --> 02:39:29,170
the arguments that he presents
and they're just so ridiculous.

5853
02:39:29,171 --> 02:39:31,900
But then he'll be a
fucking 30 page argument,

5854
02:39:31,930 --> 02:39:32,291
you know,

5855
02:39:32,291 --> 02:39:35,470
30 pages of people biting
his troll and then he

5856
02:39:37,300 --> 02:39:37,940
on it.

5857
02:39:37,940 --> 02:39:38,701
It's a waste.

5858
02:39:38,701 --> 02:39:39,880
It's sort of,

5859
02:39:39,940 --> 02:39:40,561
but it's a,

5860
02:39:40,561 --> 02:39:41,980
it's a massive waste.

5861
02:39:42,010 --> 02:39:43,300
Maybe we should have an old truck,

5862
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:46,500
no trolls zone where you're
not allowed to troll like one,

5863
02:39:46,540 --> 02:39:48,040
but it's also an intelligence test.

5864
02:39:48,041 --> 02:39:48,874
A lot of people,

5865
02:39:48,970 --> 02:39:51,640
cause some trolls are so fucking obvious
when people were jumping on him and

5866
02:39:51,641 --> 02:39:51,881
you're like,

5867
02:39:51,881 --> 02:39:54,620
God really like the one
with the guy who just,

5868
02:39:54,660 --> 02:39:56,470
we talked about a comedian stealing.

5869
02:39:56,620 --> 02:39:59,260
He's either reason idiot or
that's a successful troll.

5870
02:39:59,260 --> 02:40:00,190
You've got us to talk about it,

5871
02:40:00,191 --> 02:40:00,730
right?

5872
02:40:00,730 --> 02:40:01,031
You know,

5873
02:40:01,031 --> 02:40:03,250
people love that for
whatever fucking reason.

5874
02:40:03,430 --> 02:40:08,430
All these dingbats out there love just
getting someone's reaction when you

5875
02:40:08,681 --> 02:40:09,390
respond to that,

5876
02:40:09,390 --> 02:40:10,630
it gives a win.

5877
02:40:10,830 --> 02:40:12,520
Like what a weird way to win.

5878
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:17,140
Just a massively annoying
con until someone calls you
out on it and then you go

5879
02:40:17,280 --> 02:40:18,200
poned,

5880
02:40:19,510 --> 02:40:20,071
what is that?

5881
02:40:20,071 --> 02:40:22,980
A ridiculous game you're playing
where it's impossible for you lose.

5882
02:40:23,100 --> 02:40:26,640
All you have to do is just be really
annoying until someone calls you on it and

5883
02:40:26,641 --> 02:40:27,510
then you're a winner.

5884
02:40:27,990 --> 02:40:31,230
Like what to talk about
setting the bar low man.

5885
02:40:31,470 --> 02:40:31,651
I mean,

5886
02:40:31,651 --> 02:40:33,390
is that like the lowest bar ever?

5887
02:40:33,780 --> 02:40:38,010
All you have to do is be enough of a
shithead that somebody points it out and

5888
02:40:38,011 --> 02:40:38,940
then you're a winner.

5889
02:40:41,730 --> 02:40:45,390
Everybody's going to have to be their
own fucking name soon that's going to fix

5890
02:40:45,391 --> 02:40:45,691
everything.

5891
02:40:45,691 --> 02:40:47,850
And it's one of the things with Twitter
that somebody pointed out that's a

5892
02:40:47,851 --> 02:40:48,684
really good point.

5893
02:40:48,860 --> 02:40:49,140
He said,

5894
02:40:49,140 --> 02:40:50,250
most people on Twitter,

5895
02:40:50,251 --> 02:40:50,550
it's,

5896
02:40:50,550 --> 02:40:51,021
you know,

5897
02:40:51,021 --> 02:40:52,170
I look at your fucking name,

5898
02:40:52,171 --> 02:40:52,561
boom,

5899
02:40:52,561 --> 02:40:53,394
there's your name.

5900
02:40:54,190 --> 02:40:54,720
You know,

5901
02:40:54,720 --> 02:40:57,060
most people have Joshua Blah,

5902
02:40:57,061 --> 02:40:57,181
blah,

5903
02:40:57,181 --> 02:40:57,660
blah.

5904
02:40:57,660 --> 02:40:59,550
They have their fucking
name on their Twitter page.

5905
02:40:59,720 --> 02:41:02,630
Somehow Facebook just added
my fucking phone number on.

5906
02:41:02,650 --> 02:41:03,380
I didn't eat,

5907
02:41:03,380 --> 02:41:06,500
I didn't put my phone number
on my Facebook and the
other day somebody was like,

5908
02:41:06,501 --> 02:41:07,360
why do you have your real phone?

5909
02:41:07,450 --> 02:41:09,260
Like real phone number
on your Facebook page?

5910
02:41:09,261 --> 02:41:09,531
And I'm like,

5911
02:41:09,531 --> 02:41:10,610
are you fucking serious?

5912
02:41:10,930 --> 02:41:14,570
And it's like my app or my iPhone
must have done it or something.

5913
02:41:14,810 --> 02:41:15,643
Wow.

5914
02:41:15,680 --> 02:41:17,000
You might want to check that shit man.

5915
02:41:17,001 --> 02:41:18,130
Cause I didn't do it and

5916
02:41:18,330 --> 02:41:18,750
yeah,

5917
02:41:18,750 --> 02:41:20,070
I don't have my phone on anything.

5918
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:21,840
That's ridiculous though.

5919
02:41:22,930 --> 02:41:24,340
And then like this Twitter shit,

5920
02:41:24,460 --> 02:41:25,090
like uh,

5921
02:41:25,090 --> 02:41:30,090
the location it's set to default on
the other day and I'm like great.

5922
02:41:30,311 --> 02:41:32,290
I just told everybody where I live.

5923
02:41:33,750 --> 02:41:35,070
You don't remember I got,

5924
02:41:35,130 --> 02:41:35,880
I got hacked,

5925
02:41:35,880 --> 02:41:37,930
my Twitter got hacked and they
were saying something about it.

5926
02:41:38,010 --> 02:41:41,130
I'll join a contest and win an iPad too.

5927
02:41:41,430 --> 02:41:42,600
They've got lady Gaga,

5928
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:44,401
Lady Gaga.

5929
02:41:44,401 --> 02:41:46,830
I sent out a tweet to
like 100 million people.

5930
02:41:46,831 --> 02:41:49,620
Whoever the fuck she's gotten her
Twitter page about an iPad too.

5931
02:41:49,770 --> 02:41:50,160
Wow.

5932
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:53,140
Cause apparently lady Gaga does her
own Twitter and everybody likes to know

5933
02:41:53,150 --> 02:41:53,311
that,

5934
02:41:53,311 --> 02:41:54,144
which I do too.

5935
02:41:54,360 --> 02:41:55,770
I'm not comparing myself to lady Gaga.

5936
02:41:59,130 --> 02:42:00,420
No one can compare to Gaga.

5937
02:42:00,900 --> 02:42:01,530
Uh,

5938
02:42:01,530 --> 02:42:02,363
you know,

5939
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:04,500
they can do that somehow or another,

5940
02:42:04,501 --> 02:42:05,790
they get into your account.

5941
02:42:05,791 --> 02:42:06,624
Like if you,

5942
02:42:06,660 --> 02:42:07,860
I dunno what what you have to do,

5943
02:42:07,861 --> 02:42:11,730
but there must be some legal way they're
doing it because it can be as simple as

5944
02:42:11,731 --> 02:42:14,700
they get your password because they
don't seem to be sending a bunch of other

5945
02:42:14,701 --> 02:42:15,534
shit out with it.

5946
02:42:15,690 --> 02:42:18,870
It's just as one tweet
that keeps repeating about,

5947
02:42:18,960 --> 02:42:19,290
you know,

5948
02:42:19,290 --> 02:42:20,490
sign up for an iPad too.

5949
02:42:20,491 --> 02:42:22,450
That seems to be the one
that everybody gets gangs.

5950
02:42:22,620 --> 02:42:24,870
Well that's a money market money.

5951
02:42:25,160 --> 02:42:28,240
The most machines pointed at hacking.

5952
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:29,191
How do they do that?

5953
02:42:29,191 --> 02:42:29,880
How are they getting,

5954
02:42:29,880 --> 02:42:32,210
are they getting your password generators?

5955
02:42:32,630 --> 02:42:36,110
Is that what we're running full time board
generators and you click on a link in

5956
02:42:36,111 --> 02:42:36,201
it,

5957
02:42:36,201 --> 02:42:38,510
you're not logged in and
you log in by mistake.

5958
02:42:39,100 --> 02:42:43,840
Someone hits you with like a keystroke
tracker or some other more devious virus

5959
02:42:43,841 --> 02:42:44,231
like that.

5960
02:42:44,231 --> 02:42:46,450
But usually it's just kind
of password generators.

5961
02:42:47,140 --> 02:42:48,610
Complicated passwords are important.

5962
02:42:48,820 --> 02:42:51,660
Are those that a common
keystroke generators like uh,

5963
02:42:51,940 --> 02:42:52,870
like is that what happens?

5964
02:42:52,871 --> 02:42:53,170
Like,

5965
02:42:53,170 --> 02:42:53,950
say if someone,

5966
02:42:53,950 --> 02:42:55,030
if you get a virus,

5967
02:42:55,050 --> 02:42:59,080
Dale w w what will happen is like if you
go to somewhere and use a credit card,

5968
02:42:59,230 --> 02:43:00,130
it'll like store that.

5969
02:43:00,520 --> 02:43:01,180
Oh yeah.

5970
02:43:01,180 --> 02:43:01,511
Yeah.

5971
02:43:01,511 --> 02:43:03,280
It records everything
you do kind of like that.

5972
02:43:03,281 --> 02:43:04,640
That shit.

5973
02:43:04,641 --> 02:43:05,061
Yeah.

5974
02:43:05,061 --> 02:43:05,200
Iq,

5975
02:43:05,200 --> 02:43:05,531
client,

5976
02:43:05,531 --> 02:43:06,364
whatever it was.

5977
02:43:06,580 --> 02:43:06,940
Yeah.

5978
02:43:06,940 --> 02:43:07,773
Have you seen that shit?

5979
02:43:07,970 --> 02:43:08,410
It's the,

5980
02:43:08,410 --> 02:43:10,270
is they found out there
was some sort of a,

5981
02:43:10,271 --> 02:43:11,104
what does it Iq?

5982
02:43:11,350 --> 02:43:11,870
Is that what it is?

5983
02:43:11,870 --> 02:43:13,160
I CQ Kleiner game.

5984
02:43:13,350 --> 02:43:14,183
Um,

5985
02:43:14,470 --> 02:43:15,070
there was a,

5986
02:43:15,070 --> 02:43:15,570
um,

5987
02:43:15,570 --> 02:43:19,570
a program that they found running in the
background of droids that was storing

5988
02:43:19,780 --> 02:43:21,460
every single stroke that you made,

5989
02:43:21,461 --> 02:43:24,550
every number that you dialed every word
that you sent a text message and sending

5990
02:43:24,551 --> 02:43:25,600
it to a database somewhere.

5991
02:43:26,280 --> 02:43:26,470
Yeah.

5992
02:43:26,470 --> 02:43:28,650
And there's some giant
class action lawsuit.

5993
02:43:28,660 --> 02:43:29,493
Matt.

5994
02:43:30,670 --> 02:43:31,251
It's nuts,

5995
02:43:31,251 --> 02:43:32,084
man.

5996
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:33,063
You gotta be,

5997
02:43:33,440 --> 02:43:36,500
you gotta Watch out for these
different things as technology expands,

5998
02:43:36,501 --> 02:43:37,370
but I dunno,

5999
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:38,510
it's difficult to fight.

6000
02:43:38,600 --> 02:43:38,901
Yeah.

6001
02:43:38,901 --> 02:43:40,880
Except you have to at
least be in it a little.

6002
02:43:40,881 --> 02:43:42,530
I was talking to my sister
yesterday cause she's like,

6003
02:43:42,531 --> 02:43:43,410
should I get an iPhone?

6004
02:43:43,440 --> 02:43:43,641
I'm like,

6005
02:43:43,641 --> 02:43:43,821
yeah,

6006
02:43:43,821 --> 02:43:44,611
it's just got an iPhone.

6007
02:43:44,611 --> 02:43:44,871
They're like,

6008
02:43:44,871 --> 02:43:48,620
well t mobile is saying I could have
this free my touch three or whatever.

6009
02:43:48,621 --> 02:43:50,990
My seriously get off of t mobile,

6010
02:43:50,991 --> 02:43:51,711
go to Verizon,

6011
02:43:51,711 --> 02:43:52,440
get an iPhone,

6012
02:43:52,440 --> 02:43:52,970
whatever.

6013
02:43:52,970 --> 02:43:53,271
She's like,

6014
02:43:53,271 --> 02:43:54,104
are you sure?

6015
02:43:54,140 --> 02:43:56,570
And then she's like asking me
these other questions about tech,

6016
02:43:56,571 --> 02:43:58,220
but some technology
people love droids zone.

6017
02:43:58,720 --> 02:43:58,960
Yeah,

6018
02:43:58,960 --> 02:43:59,250
yeah,

6019
02:43:59,250 --> 02:43:59,990
I know.

6020
02:43:59,990 --> 02:44:01,540
But uh,

6021
02:44:01,620 --> 02:44:04,490
but she was asking me these
other questions of technology
and around her house

6022
02:44:04,491 --> 02:44:04,600
does,

6023
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:05,090
she goes,

6024
02:44:05,090 --> 02:44:08,720
how much would I have paid
just to get Wifi in my house?

6025
02:44:08,721 --> 02:44:10,310
Is it like 70 $80?

6026
02:44:10,340 --> 02:44:10,581
I'm like,

6027
02:44:10,581 --> 02:44:11,240
what?

6028
02:44:11,240 --> 02:44:12,050
And she's like,

6029
02:44:12,050 --> 02:44:15,210
she said she thought you had to
pay $80 a month just for Wifi.

6030
02:44:15,370 --> 02:44:18,800
And so I had to explain to her like how
no Wifi is just a box that hooks up to

6031
02:44:18,801 --> 02:44:21,280
your Internet that you already
have and then you can use.

6032
02:44:21,430 --> 02:44:22,670
If so for what?

6033
02:44:22,671 --> 02:44:23,330
10 years?

6034
02:44:23,330 --> 02:44:26,120
She hasn't had wifi cause she
thought it was like 70 bucks a month.

6035
02:44:27,020 --> 02:44:27,860
Why didn't she ask them?

6036
02:44:27,861 --> 02:44:29,180
Why they don't know?

6037
02:44:30,140 --> 02:44:30,973
I,

6038
02:44:31,410 --> 02:44:32,091
I dunno man.

6039
02:44:32,091 --> 02:44:33,410
That's just the thing on your sister.

6040
02:44:33,440 --> 02:44:34,650
I don't think you'd use it,

6041
02:44:34,940 --> 02:44:36,370
but there's a lot of
people that are like that,

6042
02:44:36,371 --> 02:44:36,530
that,

6043
02:44:36,530 --> 02:44:37,350
that,

6044
02:44:37,350 --> 02:44:37,840
yeah.

6045
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:38,673
Refused to.

6046
02:44:38,810 --> 02:44:40,440
And my sister's younger
than me and I'm like,

6047
02:44:40,441 --> 02:44:42,970
he should be more of a
computer to the shit.

6048
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:43,833
Yeah,

6049
02:44:44,060 --> 02:44:46,330
totally out of it that
she has on a smartphone.

6050
02:44:46,340 --> 02:44:47,750
She's still on a flip phone,

6051
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:48,320
you know?

6052
02:44:48,320 --> 02:44:48,760
Wow.

6053
02:44:48,760 --> 02:44:49,251
And it's just like,

6054
02:44:49,251 --> 02:44:49,611
come on,

6055
02:44:49,611 --> 02:44:49,671
you're,

6056
02:44:49,671 --> 02:44:49,900
you're,

6057
02:44:49,900 --> 02:44:51,260
you're a younger girl.

6058
02:44:51,490 --> 02:44:53,110
Some people don't want anymore

6059
02:44:53,230 --> 02:44:54,250
distractions in their lives.

6060
02:44:54,251 --> 02:44:56,200
Didn't want to be able to
watch TV on their phone.

6061
02:44:56,410 --> 02:44:56,830
Right.

6062
02:44:56,830 --> 02:44:58,090
For some people it's porn.

6063
02:44:58,100 --> 02:45:00,160
There's some dudes have a
problem with porn on their phone.

6064
02:45:00,430 --> 02:45:01,390
I was reading about this,

6065
02:45:01,391 --> 02:45:05,860
like guys have like fucking gigs of
porn on their phone as her house porn on

6066
02:45:05,861 --> 02:45:06,300
their phone.

6067
02:45:06,300 --> 02:45:06,970
Really?

6068
02:45:06,970 --> 02:45:10,870
She used to sometimes like someone
that's grocery wants a girl,

6069
02:45:11,230 --> 02:45:14,860
especially the little one like Esther
just thinking about are just shoving

6070
02:45:14,861 --> 02:45:15,694
things in there.

6071
02:45:16,840 --> 02:45:19,780
So as we bring this
fucking odd podcast home,

6072
02:45:19,900 --> 02:45:22,840
we never really did figure out
a way to fix this situation,

6073
02:45:23,440 --> 02:45:25,520
but we can drive it around
it and we just did it.

6074
02:45:25,530 --> 02:45:26,140
We gave it,

6075
02:45:26,140 --> 02:45:27,820
we gave it the date that's looking around.

6076
02:45:28,140 --> 02:45:30,260
What a fucking to take care of it.

6077
02:45:30,610 --> 02:45:30,971
Yeah.

6078
02:45:30,971 --> 02:45:34,420
Well I think the number one thing that's
going to happen at some of the people

6079
02:45:34,421 --> 02:45:34,931
that are in power,

6080
02:45:34,931 --> 02:45:36,340
I have to slowly die off.

6081
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:40,420
They have to get old and pass on and
then the young people have to move into a

6082
02:45:40,421 --> 02:45:44,050
position of power where they kind of grow
up with the Internet and they grow up

6083
02:45:44,051 --> 02:45:48,400
with a better understanding of how they're
perceived and how the world works and

6084
02:45:48,401 --> 02:45:51,820
how things don't have to be as greedy
and fucked up and corrupt as they are.

6085
02:45:52,030 --> 02:45:55,090
Halliburton didn't have to make that much
money and Ron didn't have to make that

6086
02:45:55,091 --> 02:45:55,820
much money.

6087
02:45:55,820 --> 02:45:56,200
You know,

6088
02:45:56,200 --> 02:45:58,690
so much of what happened
didn't have to happen.

6089
02:45:58,691 --> 02:46:00,100
So much of the money that changed,

6090
02:46:00,490 --> 02:46:02,210
changed hands and you know,

6091
02:46:02,410 --> 02:46:04,240
so much of the transactions
that transpire,

6092
02:46:04,241 --> 02:46:06,820
they weren't necessarily
like it got too crazy.

6093
02:46:07,270 --> 02:46:07,541
You know?

6094
02:46:07,541 --> 02:46:10,990
And I think the upcoming generations
will see that that will be

6095
02:46:11,030 --> 02:46:11,511
historically,

6096
02:46:11,511 --> 02:46:12,500
I think we're seeing it now.

6097
02:46:12,501 --> 02:46:13,400
And I think that,

6098
02:46:13,401 --> 02:46:13,800
you know,

6099
02:46:13,800 --> 02:46:14,950
this talk of the return,

6100
02:46:14,951 --> 02:46:15,591
it cuts a quad,

6101
02:46:15,591 --> 02:46:18,050
all the new type of that
that's going to change things.

6102
02:46:18,230 --> 02:46:20,900
I think really what that
may be is just the movement.

6103
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:22,730
And I think we're all part of that.

6104
02:46:22,760 --> 02:46:25,100
That kinda new person that's arriving,

6105
02:46:25,130 --> 02:46:27,260
that new consciousness
that's creating itself.

6106
02:46:27,261 --> 02:46:30,140
And I think there will be leaders
that will emerge from that movement.

6107
02:46:30,141 --> 02:46:31,910
But the movement itself is what's key.

6108
02:46:31,911 --> 02:46:34,350
And I think all of us who are playing are,

6109
02:46:34,590 --> 02:46:36,530
are part kind of expanding.

6110
02:46:36,790 --> 02:46:37,010
You know,

6111
02:46:37,010 --> 02:46:40,610
what we're open to and our beliefs
and both riding that balance between

6112
02:46:40,611 --> 02:46:42,260
skepticism and an open mind,

6113
02:46:42,261 --> 02:46:42,471
you know,

6114
02:46:42,471 --> 02:46:43,220
have to be,

6115
02:46:43,220 --> 02:46:44,900
you have to have both
and you have to have,

6116
02:46:45,170 --> 02:46:48,520
have that kind of truth seeking
aspect of yourself to doe,

6117
02:46:48,830 --> 02:46:49,400
you know,

6118
02:46:49,400 --> 02:46:52,330
find the ways between that
silage or absurdness of,

6119
02:46:52,560 --> 02:46:54,020
of the skepticism and the,

6120
02:46:54,280 --> 02:46:54,530
you know,

6121
02:46:54,530 --> 02:46:56,180
to open in [inaudible] and,

6122
02:46:56,330 --> 02:46:57,650
and find where the truth lies.

6123
02:46:57,651 --> 02:46:58,610
And I think that's uh,

6124
02:46:58,880 --> 02:47:02,810
that's going to be the key key trade of
what we need to do here going forward.

6125
02:47:02,811 --> 02:47:05,540
And that's going to create the
movement that will inspire the leaders.

6126
02:47:06,170 --> 02:47:09,410
I just hope it stays
together in some form.

6127
02:47:09,411 --> 02:47:13,850
I hope we don't have to
rebuild civilization cause
that would fucking suck cause

6128
02:47:13,851 --> 02:47:15,440
I live around too many dummies.

6129
02:47:15,710 --> 02:47:16,071
You know,

6130
02:47:16,071 --> 02:47:19,340
there's just too many dummies out there
to just rely on the people that are at

6131
02:47:19,341 --> 02:47:22,550
hand right now and I have some sort of
an even vote and have everything work.

6132
02:47:22,551 --> 02:47:23,170
Right.

6133
02:47:23,170 --> 02:47:23,870
Yeah.

6134
02:47:23,870 --> 02:47:24,321
It's just,

6135
02:47:24,321 --> 02:47:27,410
we're not prepared but like little
children toss into the woods,

6136
02:47:28,480 --> 02:47:28,970
right?

6137
02:47:28,970 --> 02:47:29,430
Yeah.

6138
02:47:29,430 --> 02:47:31,400
Well we're not prepared
to be running shit.

6139
02:47:32,210 --> 02:47:33,690
God dammit heats.

6140
02:47:33,740 --> 02:47:34,521
Keep it together.

6141
02:47:34,521 --> 02:47:37,160
To a certain extent people would be,

6142
02:47:37,480 --> 02:47:38,810
it would be better than severe.

6143
02:47:39,290 --> 02:47:39,740
We don't,

6144
02:47:39,740 --> 02:47:41,820
we don't need anything fucking traumatic.

6145
02:47:41,821 --> 02:47:42,980
The more we do preemptive,

6146
02:47:42,990 --> 02:47:46,290
I really like the more you go out there
and push aggressively now the better

6147
02:47:46,291 --> 02:47:47,124
that's going to be.

6148
02:47:47,160 --> 02:47:50,760
If we just kind of let things happen
that's no ball comes crashing hard.

6149
02:47:50,761 --> 02:47:52,140
But if we're out there pushing it now,

6150
02:47:52,141 --> 02:47:52,590
like,

6151
02:47:52,590 --> 02:47:55,110
like we're doing here on the
podcast player in our small part,

6152
02:47:55,260 --> 02:47:57,990
everybody else play in their small
part to open their consciousness,

6153
02:47:57,991 --> 02:48:00,810
open their friends consciousness
and find that truth,

6154
02:48:01,080 --> 02:48:01,700
then uh,

6155
02:48:01,700 --> 02:48:01,890
you know,

6156
02:48:01,890 --> 02:48:05,010
hopefully it'll fall a little less
hard when it actually comes to crash.

6157
02:48:05,050 --> 02:48:05,831
Listen Arbor,

6158
02:48:05,831 --> 02:48:07,600
you got a lot of haters
on my message board.

6159
02:48:07,601 --> 02:48:09,970
One of the reasons is because you
change your fucking name to Aubrey.

6160
02:48:10,270 --> 02:48:13,360
The other is because you're a little bit
too handsome and do's don't like that.

6161
02:48:13,420 --> 02:48:16,180
It makes them uncomfortable then
then all of the marketing stuff.

6162
02:48:16,181 --> 02:48:17,830
But people always ask me,

6163
02:48:17,831 --> 02:48:19,120
why am I involved with you?

6164
02:48:19,121 --> 02:48:20,140
Why am I involved with this?

6165
02:48:20,141 --> 02:48:24,430
Cause I know you and I
know you're really good,

6166
02:48:24,431 --> 02:48:24,851
dude,

6167
02:48:24,851 --> 02:48:26,290
you're a hundred percent legit.

6168
02:48:26,291 --> 02:48:27,850
And this,

6169
02:48:27,880 --> 02:48:31,240
the reason why I'm involved with
you is because you're that guy.

6170
02:48:31,241 --> 02:48:32,021
You're 100%,

6171
02:48:32,021 --> 02:48:32,440
you're legit.

6172
02:48:32,440 --> 02:48:32,860
You're,

6173
02:48:32,860 --> 02:48:33,340
you know,

6174
02:48:33,340 --> 02:48:36,100
a lot of people were skeptical
and I totally understand that.

6175
02:48:36,940 --> 02:48:38,380
I give you the stamp,

6176
02:48:38,430 --> 02:48:39,580
I'll give you a stamp of approval.

6177
02:48:39,581 --> 02:48:40,750
You're an exceptional human being,

6178
02:48:40,751 --> 02:48:43,570
and I appreciate every time
we talk in the podcast.

6179
02:48:43,571 --> 02:48:44,540
I enjoy the fuck out of it.

6180
02:48:44,541 --> 02:48:45,670
I enjoy hanging out with you.

6181
02:48:46,030 --> 02:48:46,863
It's always cool.

6182
02:48:47,650 --> 02:48:49,270
Thank you to everybody for tuning in.

6183
02:48:49,271 --> 02:48:50,051
We appreciate you.

6184
02:48:50,051 --> 02:48:51,100
Even the fucking haters,

6185
02:48:51,101 --> 02:48:51,641
as we said,

6186
02:48:51,641 --> 02:48:52,151
without you,

6187
02:48:52,151 --> 02:48:53,950
we would not have that harsh,

6188
02:48:53,951 --> 02:48:57,730
brutal criticism that sometimes makes
you really see things from a different

6189
02:48:57,731 --> 02:48:58,564
perspective.

6190
02:48:58,720 --> 02:48:59,110
Uh,

6191
02:48:59,110 --> 02:49:00,880
thank you to the fleshlight.

6192
02:49:00,930 --> 02:49:01,210

02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:12,700

6199
02:49:12,701 --> 02:49:14,550

6205
02:49:19,260 --> 02:49:20,160
you got to masturbate.

6206
02:49:20,640 --> 02:49:21,900
I didn't say that that smoothly,

6207
02:49:21,901 --> 02:49:22,711
but we know what the fuck.

6208
02:49:22,711 --> 02:49:23,544
I'm fine.

6209
02:49:24,330 --> 02:49:25,980
Thank you to [inaudible] Dot Com o.

6210
02:49:25,981 --> 02:49:26,251

Or don't do not understand.

6217
02:49:36,060 --> 02:49:37,950
Our life is not dependent
on you following that.

6218
02:49:37,951 --> 02:49:38,784
You don't have to listen to me.

6219
02:49:38,940 --> 02:49:39,780
Don't get crazy though.

6220
02:49:39,781 --> 02:49:40,740
Don't get upset.

6221
02:49:41,070 --> 02:49:41,910
Settle down.

6222
02:49:42,350 --> 02:49:42,840
Um,

6223
02:49:42,840 --> 02:49:44,250
if you're interested in nootropics,

6224
02:49:44,251 --> 02:49:45,630
please Google them.

6225
02:49:45,631 --> 02:49:46,830
Read up on them.

6226
02:49:46,860 --> 02:49:48,690
Educate yourself.

6227
02:49:48,750 --> 02:49:50,760
If you can't afford what we're selling,

6228
02:49:51,240 --> 02:49:55,800
but you're interested by the shit and
you know on bulk and make your own copy

6229
02:49:55,801 --> 02:49:56,580
our formula,

6230
02:49:56,580 --> 02:49:57,930
we really don't care.

6231
02:49:58,020 --> 02:50:00,030
And if you don't like it
and you buy it from us,

6232
02:50:00,180 --> 02:50:02,580
you get a hundred percent
money back guarantee.

6233
02:50:02,700 --> 02:50:03,830
We can't make it easier,

6234
02:50:03,850 --> 02:50:04,683
bitches.

6235
02:50:04,710 --> 02:50:07,820
It's impossible to make
it easier to focus.

6236
02:50:09,780 --> 02:50:12,720
I'm trying to make it as easy as possible.

6237
02:50:12,721 --> 02:50:15,210
You fuck settle down.

6238
02:50:15,660 --> 02:50:16,351
Keep it together.

6239
02:50:16,351 --> 02:50:17,160
Pitches.

6240
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:21,840
We're all in this together and shit has
just started to get strange ice house

6241
02:50:21,841 --> 02:50:22,561
this Friday,

6242
02:50:22,561 --> 02:50:23,191
the 23rd,

6243
02:50:23,191 --> 02:50:23,401
right?

6244
02:50:23,401 --> 02:50:26,640
We're doing a show and this
will be our second anniversary.

6245
02:50:26,760 --> 02:50:29,580
We are number one in the comedy
section of iTunes right now.

6246
02:50:29,760 --> 02:50:30,930
Praise Odin.

6247
02:50:31,200 --> 02:50:33,820
Thank you to everybody who
tunes in and you know the,

6248
02:50:33,920 --> 02:50:36,440
the thing about the iTunes
that's the most satisfying,

6249
02:50:36,490 --> 02:50:38,340
so satisfying to us and said,

6250
02:50:38,341 --> 02:50:39,420
everybody told us that,

6251
02:50:39,421 --> 02:50:39,601
you know,

6252
02:50:39,601 --> 02:50:41,220
you shouldn't have your shit on Stitcher,

6253
02:50:41,340 --> 02:50:42,840
you shouldn't have your shit on Ustream,

6254
02:50:42,841 --> 02:50:45,630
you shouldn't have your shit on Vimeo
because then it'll affect your iTunes

6255
02:50:45,631 --> 02:50:46,020
numbers.

6256
02:50:46,020 --> 02:50:47,130
The fact that we have,

6257
02:50:47,380 --> 02:50:47,790
uh,

6258
02:50:47,790 --> 02:50:51,480
the number one podcast in the comedy
section of iTunes on top of all that other

6259
02:50:51,481 --> 02:50:52,201
stuff that we do,

6260
02:50:52,201 --> 02:50:53,400
having it out there in the APP,

6261
02:50:53,401 --> 02:50:57,060
having it as an RSS feed just means that
you guys are enjoying it and that means

6262
02:50:57,061 --> 02:50:59,130
the fucking world to me
and I could not be happier.

6263
02:50:59,370 --> 02:51:00,151
We'd love doing it.

6264
02:51:00,151 --> 02:51:02,640
We're never going to stop doing it and
we're never going to start charging money

6265
02:51:02,641 --> 02:51:02,910
for it.

6266
02:51:02,910 --> 02:51:03,750
It's always going to be free.

6267
02:51:03,940 --> 02:51:05,850
Thank you bitches.

6268
02:51:05,851 --> 02:51:07,420
We love you and we'll see you soon.

6269
02:51:07,930 --> 02:51:11,790
Listen to the Josh gross a interview and
people had to have a note that she had

6270
02:51:11,791 --> 02:51:12,351
Josh growth.

6271
02:51:12,351 --> 02:51:13,100
Is that his name?

6272
02:51:13,100 --> 02:51:13,933
He has.

6273
02:51:14,550 --> 02:51:17,040
We just released that episode
yesterday on the Death Squad layer,

6274
02:51:17,130 --> 02:51:18,120
which is very little bit.

6275
02:51:18,150 --> 02:51:18,840
Yeah.

6276
02:51:18,840 --> 02:51:20,080
We talked to him a little bit about,

6277
02:51:20,081 --> 02:51:20,190
uh,

6278
02:51:20,190 --> 02:51:22,440
how he can't say that he
smokes weed and how he can't,

6279
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:26,670
that he fucked up when he released the
information for the ultimate fighter.

6280
02:51:26,750 --> 02:51:26,990
Right.

6281
02:51:26,990 --> 02:51:27,650
You know,

6282
02:51:27,650 --> 02:51:28,560
which I think is,

6283
02:51:28,561 --> 02:51:30,060
I think that's just stupid.

6284
02:51:30,090 --> 02:51:30,660
I mean like,

6285
02:51:30,660 --> 02:51:31,000
like I,

6286
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:32,470
I agreed that's a spoiler,

6287
02:51:32,471 --> 02:51:33,151
but that's like going,

6288
02:51:33,151 --> 02:51:33,880
hey Bambi,

6289
02:51:33,880 --> 02:51:34,860
his mom died.

6290
02:51:34,861 --> 02:51:35,251
You know,

6291
02:51:35,251 --> 02:51:35,611
and that's,

6292
02:51:35,611 --> 02:51:36,444
come on,

6293
02:51:37,740 --> 02:51:38,550
don't be like,

6294
02:51:38,550 --> 02:51:38,851
yeah,

6295
02:51:38,851 --> 02:51:41,070
there's a fine line between
a journalist and a spoiler.

6296
02:51:41,660 --> 02:51:42,001
I don't,

6297
02:51:42,001 --> 02:51:42,241
yeah.

6298
02:51:42,241 --> 02:51:42,700
I don't know.

6299
02:51:42,700 --> 02:51:42,880
I mean,

6300
02:51:42,880 --> 02:51:43,080
I,

6301
02:51:43,080 --> 02:51:44,370
I see where his point of view is.

6302
02:51:44,371 --> 02:51:45,330
I disagree with it though.

6303
02:51:45,360 --> 02:51:46,440
It's as far as that goes.

6304
02:51:46,590 --> 02:51:48,180
I don't want to know the fucking results.

6305
02:51:48,181 --> 02:51:48,601
Like I told you,

6306
02:51:48,601 --> 02:51:49,710
I could find out who won.

6307
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:51,270
I can find out one every season.

6308
02:51:51,271 --> 02:51:53,550
I W I go through the whole
process like everybody else does.

6309
02:51:54,450 --> 02:51:56,460
You sneak peek and bitches.

6310
02:51:56,580 --> 02:51:56,881
All right.

6311
02:51:56,881 --> 02:51:59,070
This podcast is fucking over.

6312
02:51:59,400 --> 02:52:00,480
Thank you very much.

6313
02:52:00,481 --> 02:52:01,314
We already did that.

6314
02:52:01,530 --> 02:52:01,741
Yeah,

6315
02:52:01,741 --> 02:52:02,061
we did it.

6316
02:52:02,061 --> 02:52:02,181
Oh,

6317
02:52:02,181 --> 02:52:02,870
I didn't know that.

6318
02:52:02,870 --> 02:52:03,510
I thought her Donna.

6319
02:52:03,510 --> 02:52:03,691
Oh,

6320
02:52:03,691 --> 02:52:04,061
we did it.

6321
02:52:04,061 --> 02:52:04,561
Both of them,

6322
02:52:04,561 --> 02:52:05,080
Bro.

6323
02:52:05,080 --> 02:52:05,711
You're out of it,

6324
02:52:05,711 --> 02:52:05,921
man.

6325
02:52:05,921 --> 02:52:06,040
You

6326
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:08,040
need some brain needs.

6327
02:52:08,120 --> 02:52:08,953
Some memory.

6328
02:52:09,070 --> 02:52:12,040
Fucking electrodes are
so some shock therapy.

6329
02:52:12,220 --> 02:52:15,160
I've been eating my flashlights and
fucking lamp for brains by mistake.

6330
02:52:15,220 --> 02:52:19,420
Oh one one notification for those who
couldn't get the product in in Europe were

6331
02:52:19,421 --> 02:52:22,360
coming up with a formula that's
going to be able to cross all the,

6332
02:52:22,361 --> 02:52:23,320
all the different borders.

6333
02:52:23,321 --> 02:52:24,670
What is the hold up in Europe?

6334
02:52:25,880 --> 02:52:26,830
Different random things.

6335
02:52:26,831 --> 02:52:30,670
Although some of it's even vitamin B six
is illegal and a in a couple of places.

6336
02:52:30,680 --> 02:52:31,410
Ireland.

6337
02:52:31,410 --> 02:52:31,610
Yeah.

6338
02:52:31,610 --> 02:52:34,370
Pirate vitamin B six they
don't want to healthy.

6339
02:52:35,070 --> 02:52:38,800
They want to keep going a doc and fucking
pay it and angry and drunk and fucking

6340
02:52:39,880 --> 02:52:41,860
fucking asshole.

6341
02:52:42,190 --> 02:52:42,881
Thank you very much.

6342
02:52:42,881 --> 02:52:44,980
That was the worst Irish
accent I think I've ever done.

6343
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:45,810
But we'll have,

6344
02:52:45,810 --> 02:52:46,840
we'll have something out here for you.

6345
02:52:46,860 --> 02:52:47,601
Partial Gaelic.

6346
02:52:47,601 --> 02:52:49,060
And there was a little
Australian thrown in there.

6347
02:52:49,090 --> 02:52:49,923
It's fucking shows over.

6348
02:52:49,930 --> 02:52:50,230
Good night.

6349
02:52:50,230 --> 02:52:50,800
