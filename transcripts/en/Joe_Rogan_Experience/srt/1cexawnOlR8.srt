1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,480
Hey everybody,

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,703
what's up?

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,790
How was your weekend?

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,773
Don't answer that.

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,123
We're not really talking.

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,310
That's just the awkward thing though.

7
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,050
The get the get the podcast started words,

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,310
they don't really mean anything.

9
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,830
It takes a few words from here on out.

10
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,000
Everything means something.

11
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,230
Allegedly.

12
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,900
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is brought to you by Squarespace.

13
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,620
Congratulations to all those folks
who won the Squarespace contest.

14
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,900
He should be getting all your goods,

15
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:32,520

swag bag from Squarespace and you get

16
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:35,610
a free year of Squarespace service.

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,690
There was some really cool,

18
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,380
um,

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,070
entrance,

20
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,840
a lot of them really too many to,

21
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:40,710
to pick four,

22
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,740
but we managed to pick four that we're,

23
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:43,320
uh,

24
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,280
we're pretty striking.

25
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:44,881
So,

26
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:45,530
uh,

27
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,110
the what,

28
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,960
what Squarespace is for people to,

29
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,291
in going,

30
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,230
what the fuck's he talking about?

31
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,800
Squarespace is a fantastic
website for creating websites.

32
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,150
It's really intuitive,

33
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:55,530
super easy to use.

34
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,910
It's one that I've had
virtually zero complaints about,

35
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:03,330
not virtually actually when
I say virtually because I
was trying to sound smart.

36
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,590
It seems like a good word to fit in there.

37
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,910
Um,

38
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,590
it's used by,

39
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:07,960
you know,

40
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,250
somebody,

41
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,090
different companies that would have
ordinarily had to pay someone a,

42
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:15,150
a tremendous amount of money to create
something just as cool and slick the way

43
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:20,151
they have it is set up so that if you
can do normal computer things like go

44
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:21,031
online,

45
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:21,950
dragon drop,

46
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,993
you know,

47
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,150
click on things.

48
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:24,420
It's,

49
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,970
if you could do like normal
things in the Internet,

50
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:28,470
create a word document,

51
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,770
you could figure out how to make your
own beautiful website with things like

52
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:35,460
having an online store,

53
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:38,400
very easy to set up for musicians,

54
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:41,580
musicians can sell digital
music from Squarespace.

55
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,930
It's just a really cool company that

56

help website that will deliver better

61
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:06,240
customer service.

62
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,490
They actually have an ad
running during the Superbowl.

63
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,950
Damn Squarespace is stepping up.

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:11,940
Um,

Just a perfect examples of what
can be done because it really,

70

71
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,660
you know,

72
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,280
like most people's websites,

73
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,580
you either had someone make it a new
what they're doing or your website looks

74
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:33,414
like shit,

75
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,220

80
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,510
Creepy baby holding a guy.

81
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:52,500
That's a baby.

82
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,430
Wow.

83
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,750
Why are you trying to freak me out man?

84
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,273
I know your bet.

85
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,510
They're trying to freak me out.

86
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,170
That is weird.

87
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,080
These babies in weird
ways and w commercials,

88
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,790
it's very unusual the just for men
baby and is this a bunch of like weird

89
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,630
commercials with babies?

90
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,400
Get to talk babies,

91
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:10,930
do things that normal people do.

92
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,390
We're fucking weird man.

93
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,373
Humans are weird.

94
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,580
Anyway,

95
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,410
we're also brought to you by legal zoom.

96
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,160
Um,

97
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,390
much like Squarespace,

98
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:21,550
which a lot of our friends
have used legal zoom.

99
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,270
It's been used by a lot of our friends
on it was formed through legal zoom.

100
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,400
Brian formed his death squad
company through legal zoom.

101
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,530
You can't get a better,

102
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:30,100
simpler,

103
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,100
easier way to to do law type shit that
you would ordinarily have to go to a

104
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:36,970
lawyers office for.

105
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:37,900
You would not ordinarily,

106
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,010
you'd have to make an appointment,

107
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,630
he'd have to go there.

108
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,040
You'd have to wait in line.

109
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:42,580
You'd have to,

110
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,510
I don't know if you wait in line,

111
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,380
you have to wait to wait.

112
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,420
I don't think there's a line.

113
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,513
I'm exaggerating.

114
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,920
The point is it costs a lot of
fucking money to go to the lawyer,

115
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,210
but you can start a business
incorporate or start an lll LLC.

116
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:55,690
Well,

117
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,800
I don't know what an ELA is,

118
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,330
but you can start an LLC,

119
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,000
which is like limited
legal something or another.

120
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:01,750
What does that stand for?

121
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,070
Limited liability company.

122
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:03,790
Yeah,

123
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,980
and you could do that for just 99 bucks.

124
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,120
You can also do a last
will for just 69 bucks,

125
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:11,020
get a living trust,

126
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:11,771
power of attorney,

127
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:12,041
more,

128
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:12,874
all that kind of stuff.

129
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,950
And legal zoom also has a connection
to a series of independent attorney.

130
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,180
So if you panic and you're like,

131
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:20,740
this is the fuck I can't do this,

132
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,330
legal zoom will connect you to independent
attorneys who can help you through

133
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,164
the process,

134
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,640
help you through your process.

135
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,450
Um,

136
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,040
if you're in the middle
of it and you're like,

137
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:30,731
this can't be legal,

138
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:31,301
I'm going to jail.

139
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:31,721
I'm scared.

140
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:32,800
I need to talk to a real lawyer.

141
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,230
Don't panic legals and we'll hook you up.

142
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,460
Legal Zoom is not a law firm,

143
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:39,970
but they can connect to you with a third
party attorney and provide you with

144
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:41,440
self help services.

145
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,460

148
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,990
this is probably the easiest way,

149
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:53,824
ladies and gentlemen,

150
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,990
that you can be naked and do law.

151
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,420
You can do legal things
completely naked from the freedom.

152
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,590
Yeah,

153
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,300
but you've got to put a
piece of tape over your,

154
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,970
you're a little webcam because
the fucking government,

155
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:04,600
man,

156
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,280
they're sneaking in there looking at you.

157
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,440
Do you have a piece of
tape over their address?

158
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,101
Even better.

159
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,750
I have an eff sticker.

160
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:14,350
Eff The electronic frontier foundation
that fights for civil liberties on the

161
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:15,730
Internet and they have their own brand.

162
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:16,660
It's thinkers you can buy,

163
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,120
so they have their own
stickers that cover webcams.

164
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,451
Yes,

165
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:19,991
and they don't,

166
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:20,824
they don't leave.

167
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,440
They don't leave glue residue.

168
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,490
So you can peel it off and put it back
on if you want to talk someone into do

169
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,333
video.

170
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:26,700
Right.

171
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,450
It's beautiful.

172
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:27,710
Yeah.

173
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,720
It's a great little thing.

174
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,501
The Internet,

175
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:30,640
you can't fuck with the Internet.

176
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,870
It's too strong.

177
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,980
It got out of control.

178
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,240
You fucked up government,

179
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:34,660
I think.

180
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,430
Just keep it on the government.

181
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:37,264
You fucked up.

182
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,163
You messed up.

183
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:38,820
He just,

184
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,210
an Internet was your downfall.

185
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,540
When they go look in the history of
the human beings and they go back to

186
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,374
different errors,

187
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,393
they will look at the,

188
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,380
the history of the Internet called bullae.

189
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,150
They didn't see that coming.

190
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,620
Oh my goodness.

191
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,720
Anyway on the Internet,

192
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,790
go to legal zoom.com how about that?

193
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,770
Get yourself an LLC.

194
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,830
The is right.

195
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,610
Uh,

196
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,570
patents and things.

197
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,141
Well,

198
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:03,650
that's the most important
thing that I'll see on legal.

199
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:04,450
Zoom did gym.

200
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,460
The thing is a lot of this law
stuff is not that complicated,

201
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,630
but they make you pay,

202
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:08,961
you know,

203
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:12,740
150 bucks to do it with an attorney and
they really just fill in a form for you.

204
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,540
Most people can do it themselves,

205
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,021
so it's,

206
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:15,291
yeah,

207
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:15,771
it works.

208
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:16,330
It's great.

209
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,350
It's a trap.

210
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,623
It's a trap,

211
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,711
but for now,

212
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:21,760
legal zooms legal.

213
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,700
Who knows what's going to happen.

214
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,220
Go there.

215
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,000
Legal zoom.com and a used the row,

216
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,840
the word Rogan in the referral
box at checkout for more savings.

217
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,080
We're also brought to you
by on@dotcomonig.com the
human optimization website.

218
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,780
What is essentially is
all things that I use,

219
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:43,030
whether it's a physical fitness equipment,

220
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,620
strength and conditioning equipment
like kettle bells or battle ropes or ab

221
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:52,621
wheels or anything that we find that
is that can aid human performance,

222
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:56,170
whether it's human physical performance,

223
00:06:56,171 --> 00:06:57,880
whether it's cognitive performance,

224
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,150
whether it aids and enhancing your mood.

225
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,700
We actually have a supplement called new
mood that's a five HTP and l tryptofan

226
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,670
supplement that actually enhances your
body's ability to produce dopamine.

227
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:10,600
It makes you feel better.

228
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,890
So much so that there's people that are
on antidepressants or their doctors tell

229
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:18,280
them to not take five HTP cause you
don't want to get too much of that.

230
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:20,460
Good loving too much of that.

231
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:20,691
Yeah.

232
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,051
What's that?

233
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:21,791
Ecstasy like?

234
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:21,951
Why?

235
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:23,220
Why wouldn't you want to go to,

236
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,990
I guess serotonin

237
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,070
overload or something like that?

238
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:26,440
You can,

239
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,420
you kind of real issues.

240
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,051
You're not,

241
00:07:28,051 --> 00:07:28,740
you know,

242
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,970
it's like too much of a bat,

243
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:30,631
a good thing.

244
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:31,464
It's still bad.

245
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,490
That's why if guys do steroids and
they get to be 350 pounds there,

246
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,180
Dick just shuts down your Dick's
done too much of a good thing.

247
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:39,601
You know,

248
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:40,800
your liver is freaking out.

249
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:43,110
It's got to process all the shit
that you're pumping into it.

250
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,020
It's all about balance,

251
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,830
balance and uh,

252
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:50,790
all the things that on it.

253
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,630
Um,

254
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,441
whether it's uh,

255
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:55,140
the strength and conditioning equipment
or the supplements I'll share that I

256
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:55,501
use.

257
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:56,820
And if we find something out there,

258
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,810
we tried to sell it.

259
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,880
We tried to sell you the best coconut oil.

260
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:01,890
We tried to sell you
the best buffalo bars,

261
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,390
best hemp seed oil from the finest hemp
seed with the highest levels of protein

262
00:08:06,391 --> 00:08:06,900
in it.

263
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,440
We just tried to sell you the very
best shit available and we sell some

264
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:11,460
controversial things,

265
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,120
uh,

266
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,380
things like nootropics.

267
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,041
And we,

268
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:14,221
uh,

269
00:08:14,221 --> 00:08:17,520
we funded a double blind placebo study
that we'll be able to talk more about in

270
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:18,354
February,

271
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,440
but we were spending a lot of money
to back up the existing science on

272
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:26,880
nootropics because I know a lot of
people fear that things are snake oil.

273
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,131
And I,

274
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:27,281
I,

275
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:28,320
that's a good fear.

276
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,183
It's good.

277
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,810
And it's good because it forces companies
who sell legitimate things to do the

278
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:36,270
proper testing and just show you,

279
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,570
there's plenty of examples
of things on late night TV.

280
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:42,590
They're telling you that your Dick's
going to grow or you know this.

281
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,230
I mean that's just one example of things
that you know are dubious and you know

282
00:08:46,231 --> 00:08:48,450
they're making money because if they
weren't making money they wouldn't be

283
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:49,410
having these commercials.

284
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,620
There is nothing that
makes your Dick Rowe.

285
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:53,820
If they did on it would have
it on the God damn front page.

286
00:08:53,821 --> 00:08:54,990
We'd have Dick Rowe pills,

287
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:55,411
weed,

288
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,071
fucking sell them,

289
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:56,820
buy crates.

290
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,960
The shit doesn't work.

291
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,340
Nothing makes your Dick Rowe.

292
00:08:59,341 --> 00:08:59,551
Okay.

293
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:01,290
Did the moment they figure it out.

294
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,090
Go to on.com O.

295
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:03,361
N.

296
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:03,631
N.

297
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:03,841
I.

298
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:04,650
T.

299
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,760
We'll fucking have it.

300
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,780
If there's something out there,

301
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:07,350
we'll have it,

302
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,260
but until now we're just trying to
sell you this stuff that does work.

303
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,520
Because of the controversy.

304
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,320
We have a very loose
money back guarantee on,

305
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,320
on their supplements,

306
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,240
on things like new mood or Alpha brain.

307
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,950
There is a 90 pill,

308
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:20,761
30 day,

309
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,620
100% money back guarantee.

310
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,161
Excuse me,

311
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:23,994
30 pill

312
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,913
coffin here,

313
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,833
I reversed it.

314
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,920
It's a 30 pill,

315
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:29,754
90 day.

316
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,440
So the first 30 pills,

317
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,050
you have a 90 day 100%
money back guarantee and you
don't even have to return

318
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:37,884
the product.

319
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,180
You don't have to send it back in.

320
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:39,660
You just,

321
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,980
you use what you just said.

322
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:41,814
This stuff's socks.

323
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,683
You get your money back.

324
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,190
The what we're trying to do is sell you
something that is so good that you don't

325
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:48,300
have that temptation.

326
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,200
And if you honestly do try Alpha brain
and you say it didn't do anything for

327
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:53,034
you,

328
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,330
I want you to have your money back.

329
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,710
I think that's good.

330
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,191
Don't buy it.

331
00:09:56,191 --> 00:09:56,820
And again,

332
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,121
don't,

333
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:57,990
don't buy it anymore.

334
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,351
And you know,

335
00:09:58,351 --> 00:09:59,280
maybe it's just not for you,

336
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,990
but that's,

337
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,350
I don't,

338
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,710
I don't want anybody to feel ripped off.

339
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,940
We're so confident that what we're
selling is effective and works for us.

340
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,420
That we're willing to have such a,

341
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,720
uh,

342
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,160
a loose and limber moneyback guarantee,

343
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,860
but we're just going to continue to try
to sell you the best shit that we can

344
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:14,694
find.

345
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,100
And,

346
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,933
uh,

347
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,570
whatever science that we can
do on one of her supplements,

348
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:19,800
we will absolutely do that as well.

349
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,330
You use a codeword Rogan and you will
save 10% off any and all supplements.

350
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,380
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,

351
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,750
thanks to everybody who
came out to Chicago.

352
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,640
We had a great fucking
time this past weekend.

353
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,563
It was cold as shit,

354
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,950
but the people are cool as fuck.

355
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,293
Um,

356
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,160
Andreas Antonopoulos is here.

357
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,460
We're going to talk about cryptocurrency
and we're going to let some bitches,

358
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:39,294
no,

359
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,060
the Joe Rogan experience.

360
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,840
Hey Joe Rogan podcast all day.

361
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,970
So I love the fact that you can get on
the Internet and you have a conversation

362
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,690
on Twitter with anybody and
the word bitcoin comes up.

363
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:04,050
And then this swarm of people from
like all these different directions.

364
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,500
Andreas Antonopoulos,

365
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:05,681
judge,

366
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:06,011
judge,

367
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:06,191
judge,

368
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:06,341
judge,

369
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:06,551
judge,

370
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:07,120
judge,

371
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,631
Bitcoin,

372
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:08,171
Jesus,

373
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:08,470
g,G ,

374
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,641
G,

375
00:11:08,641 --> 00:11:08,840
G,

376
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,250
g.

377
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,150
So you know,

378
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:10,811
eye contact,

379
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:10,991
you,

380
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:11,920
you contact me.

381
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,000
Boom.

382
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,470
A week later we're sitting in front of
each other and want to talk about bitcoin

383
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:15,821
in a million.

384
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:16,720
People are going to hear about it.

385
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,000
I mean,

386
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,930
does the Internet is fucking beautiful.

387
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,130
It's magic.

388
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,001
I mean it's just,

389
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:23,530
it is what it should have.

390
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,490
The would communication with human
beings should have been a long time ago.

391
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,880
I think it would have all the things
that took off and gained ground and gain

392
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,990
momentum throughout human history,

393
00:11:34,991 --> 00:11:38,560
whether it's religion or
whether it's colt rituals,

394
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,420
ritualistic behavior like the,

395
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,840
all that shit wouldn't have
happened if the Internet was around.

396
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,400
The Internet would have went under Dah,

397
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:45,491
Dah,

398
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:45,641
Dah,

399
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:45,761
Dah.

400
00:11:45,761 --> 00:11:46,271
It's not that.

401
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:46,840
It's this,

402
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,291
why does it,

403
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:47,950
does it stop?

404
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,640
What are you saying?

405
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,473
Look right here.

406
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:49,850
Here's,

407
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,683
here's the studies.

408
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,720
There's so much misconception and so
disinformation that human beings have been

409
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:56,650
fed throughout history.

410
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:01,090
I think we're just now starting to grasp
how huge it is that this is the first

411
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:06,091
time in history where information just
flows just back and forth and the most

412
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:09,160
valuable stuff is free.

413
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,070
The most valuable information
that you can get online,

414
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,030
absolutely free,

415
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:13,900
which is,

416
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,620
you know what's the best thing about the
internet is that it's a dumb network.

417
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,360
It transmits information from point a
to point B and it doesn't care what that

418
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:23,194
information is.

419
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,120
So if you come up with a new idea,

420
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:25,990
a new application,

421
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,270
and you stick it on the
edge of the network,

422
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,820
you can transmit that
information to anybody else.

423
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,640
And there's a cellist principle behind it,

424
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,700
net neutrality that you don't prioritize
your content instead of somebody

425
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:37,534
else's,

426
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,390
you allow equal access
to all for all contents.

427
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,980
And the Internet doesn't care.

428
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,761
It's just Ip.

429
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,890
All that seizes bites
and it just moves them.

430
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,500
And then one day somebody invented a new
application and stuck it on the edge,

431
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,890
the Internet of money.

432
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,400
And that's what I'm here to talk about
today because they didn't need to ask

433
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:55,360
anybody permission.

434
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,480
And they launched bitcoin and it happened.

435
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,340
And now that it's here,

436
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,320
it's enabling other people to launch money
applications on the Internet and it's

437
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:08,350
going to fuel the Internet even
faster than we've seen before.

438
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,231
Yeah,

439
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:10,850
this is a very strange time,

440
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,240
uh,

441
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:11,631
in,

442
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:15,830
in that there's actually people that
are just starting to accept bitcoin.

443
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,560
One of the first crypto currencies for,

444
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:23,270
for solid objects like tiger direct
is starting to accept bitcoin.

445
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:24,230
For computers.

446
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,830
You can order a computer on tiger
direct from fucking bitcoins.

447
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:31,730
And I'll send you a God damn actual
computer that you can get online with that

448
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:32,920
starts becoming real

449
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,230
well tiger direct can very simply take
that bit coin and immediately converted

450
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:42,231
into dollars so they don't even have
any exchange risk and other people are

451
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:45,060
willing to give them dollars for
it because they see it as valuable.

452
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,830
And that's all money is.

453
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,810
It's a shared understanding that this
thing has value because it's scarce that

454
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,520
it's not around a lot.

455
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,290
It's hard to make.

456
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,580
You can't copy it,

457
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:57,540
you can't fake it.

458
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,550
And once you have those three things,

459
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,533
you have money.

460
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:00,940
Okay,

461
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,773
then it has value.

462
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,480
Plain those.

463
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,650
How is it possible?

464
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:04,891
Well,

465
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:09,720
what exactly is bitcoin for people that
are completely on the outside on this

466
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,520
and they listen to this
podcast and I'm like,

467
00:14:11,521 --> 00:14:12,870
what the fuck is he talking about?

468
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:13,681
New Money,

469
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:14,310
bitcoin.

470
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,730
What is,

471
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,110
what is a bitcoin?

472
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,850
So there's layers to this.

473
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,950
I'll start at the top layer at the top.

474
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:21,281
Player.

475
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:26,281
Bitcoin is cash on the intranet and I say
cash because it's not just any kind of

476
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:27,431
money.

477
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:29,380
It's not like an account or credit card.

478
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:30,430
It's not like paypal.

479
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,481
This is cash,

480
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:32,830
which means that when you have it,

481
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,400
you have it sitting on your
computer as digital cash.

482
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,570
And then when you send it,

483
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,630
it goes directly from your computer to
the recipients wallet as digital cash.

484
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,850
Now that's the top layer underneath.

485
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,970
This is basically a shared ledger.

486
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:53,660
That means that everyone can see all of
the transactions and the whole network

487
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:56,330
agrees that Andrea sent Joe,

488
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,231
you know,

489
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,190
a 10th of a bitcoin.

490
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:58,550
Great.

491
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,660
Now the whole network knows it.

492
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:02,990
So that means Joel has a 10th of a
bitcoin and simply based on that,

493
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,370
you can move money around.

494
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,330
Um,

495
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:07,340
there's a lot of security
in some complex math,

496
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,130
but basically bitcoin is a standard.

497
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:12,350
It's an agreement on how to
exchange money on the Internet,

498
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:15,680
just like the web is a standard on
how to create pages and view them in a

499
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,514
browser.

500
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,980
There's a lot of skepticism
when it comes to bitcoin.

501
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,570
Um,

502
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:21,880
uh,

503
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,880
I've spoken to people that are financial
wizards that are skeptical and I've

504
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:29,320
spoken to people that are just,

505
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,311
you know,

506
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:33,970
the that have just looked
into cryptocurrencies
because of the rise of the

507
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:35,260
popularity of bitcoin.

508
00:15:35,261 --> 00:15:35,521
They said,

509
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:36,460
this doesn't make sense.

510
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,620
There's no room for inflation.

511
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,060
There's not enough people,

512
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,400
not enough bitcoins does it?

513
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:43,234
It's not going to work.

514
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,500
How are they going to create more?

515
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,510
There's all these different arguments
about why do you think that what we're

516
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:54,511
seeing with the rise of bitcoin is
instead of just addressing all these

517
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,500
financial concerns and all these people
that are used to the current market and

518
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,300
the place that it's at right now,

519
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,271
the the the,

520
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:06,250
the standards that the way they run things
instead of that bitcoin just creates

521
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:11,251
a completely new network driven community
driven money and says fuck all your

522
00:16:12,851 --> 00:16:13,430
old rule.

523
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,840
It's social network of funny.

524
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,070
It's peer to peer money.

525
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,460
It means to wrecked from one individual
to another individual no matter where

526
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:24,461
they are on the world in seconds for
almost free and that has never happened

527
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:24,960
before.

528
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,630
Do you think that part of the skepticism
though is because of the fact this

529
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:28,950
other system exists?

530
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,250
Sure.

531
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,810
And that this other system is our norm,

532
00:16:30,811 --> 00:16:31,644
our standard.

533
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,580
And we don't want to look
at like something like
bitcoin objectively just say,

534
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:35,881
okay,

535
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:38,790
let's pretend that our current
system of stocks and bonds,

536
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:39,843
but it's not just,

537
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,301
yeah,

538
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:41,560
and it's not just the system.

539
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,620
It's so much part of our culture.

540
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,290
Money is one of the first technologies,

541
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:47,981
you know,

542
00:16:47,981 --> 00:16:49,420
fire wheel money.

543
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,360
Money has existed for tens
of thousands of years,

544
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,520
going back to shells and feathers and
knots on string and giant rocks in the

545
00:16:57,521 --> 00:17:02,521
Polynesian islands and then through the
Iron Age to minted coins stamped with

546
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:03,940
emperors faces.

547
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,450
This stuff has been part of our
culture for tens of thousands of years.

548
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,561
And as a result,

549
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,300
it's no longer just technology.

550
00:17:10,301 --> 00:17:14,080
It's a cultural phenomenon and you are
steeped in it from the moment you're

551
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:14,943
born.

552
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:19,540
And so you acquire certain notions
of what money is and how it works.

553
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:23,620
And you think that the current system
by which money works is the only system

554
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:25,990
because we've had it
for thousands of years.

555
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,120
And even in computer science,

556
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:32,590
the idea of getting distributed
computers to agree on something without

557
00:17:32,591 --> 00:17:33,370
cheating,

558
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,260
we thought that problem couldn't be solved
until 2008 when the invention behind

559
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:41,620
bitcoin solve that problem and
created a new way of doing money.

560
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,990
And it's going to take a lot
of time to understand it.

561
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,140
Primarily because people don't really
understand money as it is today.

562
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:48,850
They don't understand how banks work.

563
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:51,690
They understand how the
Federal Reserve creates money.

564
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:54,390
They don't understand a
debt based system for money.

565
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,291
I've read about it.

566
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,124
I don't understand it.

567
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:56,760
Well,

568
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,190
I read,

569
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,100
I read many things.

570
00:17:58,101 --> 00:17:59,700
I've watched documentaries understand it.

571
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,920
Most of the people when
they first face bitcoin,

572
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,850
they start asking questions about money
and it quickly becomes apparent to all

573
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:06,930
of us when we do this,

574
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:08,390
that we don't know much about money.

575
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:10,620
So then we learned about money
and we start reading about money.

576
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:11,930
But um,

577
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,391
you know,

578
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:12,601
it's,

579
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:15,990
it's very much part of the culture to
the point where I'll talk to people about

580
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:16,980
bitcoin and they'll say,

581
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:17,191
well,

582
00:18:17,191 --> 00:18:18,390
it's not backed by gold.

583
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:20,010
So how can it have value?

584
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,400
The dollar hasn't been backed
by gold for like 60 years in,

585
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,630
and you talk to the average person in
the streets and they still think there's

586
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:29,760
some gold in a vault
and that stuff does it.

587
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,481
It doesn't exist.

588
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:32,850
I'm happen to all the
gold in the vault watches.

589
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,301
Well,

590
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:34,800
that's a whole other question.

591
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:35,190
I mean,

592
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,570
the real issue is this heath,

593
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,600
we haven't been on a gold standard for
decades and all of the currencies in the

594
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:45,870
world are created based on the productive
capacity of the country and the legal

595
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:46,231
system,

596
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:47,760
and because they have value,

597
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:52,410
because you pay your taxes with them and
then they just float freely in exchange

598
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:52,681
rates.

599
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,990
So they very against each other in the,

600
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,700
because the dollar is used to buy oil,

601
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:59,280
it's the world reserve currency and
all the other currencies are measured

602
00:18:59,281 --> 00:18:59,731
against that,

603
00:18:59,731 --> 00:19:02,640
but there is no gold and that's fine.

604
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,930
That doesn't mean it doesn't have value.

605
00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:04,764
It absolutely has.

606
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,040
That fucks up a lot of old action movies,

607
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:07,730
man.

608
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,270
Yeah,

609
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,110
it really does.

610
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,090
Those movies where you
would break into the vault.

611
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:11,550
Yeah,

612
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,383
Lone Ranger.

613
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,930
The bars of gold there would
always be brick shaped.

614
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:20,370
Well the thing is gold isn't
that efficient for building
a currency on because

615
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:22,380
the rates of which you can produce gold,

616
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,130
um,

617
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:24,030
is his face.

618
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,500
Then it's hoarded and you know,

619
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:26,880
you have certain problems.

620
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,610
Now the Nice thing about
bitcoin is that it takes,

621
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,240
um,

622
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,040
it takes the same concept of scarcity a,

623
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,610
of having something that
is a limited resource,

624
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,530
but it does it by algorithm.

625
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:42,210
So you essentially have math
that says that every 10 minutes,

626
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:47,211
25 new bitcoin is created by the network
as a whole with all of the computing

627
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:48,330
capacity of the network.

628
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,910
And that's fixed.

629
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,360
And every four years we create
half as much every 10 minutes.

630
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,360
So in four years it goes down to 12
and a half bitcoin every 10 minutes.

631
00:19:57,361 --> 00:20:00,300
And then it goes down to six and a
quarter and it keeps going down until you

632
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:01,480
meant the last bit coin.

633
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,080
And then you're done 21 million coins.

634
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,800
It's done.

635
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,830
And the idea is that you
provide a sound basis for money.

636
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,910
Something that is rare,

637
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,200
cannot be forged,

638
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,730
is easily transportable.

639
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,560
And that is the form of currency.

640
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,700
So 21 million bitcoins and then it's over.

641
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,390
They will,

642
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:17,631
well,

643
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:18,290
there's our,

644
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,360
you can divide a Bitcoin,

645
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,660
100 million pieces,

646
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,120
so it goes down to eight digits.

647
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,940
And that means the lowest
units is called a Satoshi.

648
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,070
And there's 100 million
satoshis in a bitcoin.

649
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,740
So 21 million times 100 million,

650
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,780
21 quadrillion coins,

651
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,703
plenty coins.

652
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,031
Jesus Christ.

653
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:35,340
Why am,

654
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,710
why is that so complicated?

655
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,080
Why is it like 100 million?

656
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,320
Um,

657
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,320
well I think part of the reason is that
it's easier to write a number without a

658
00:20:45,781 --> 00:20:49,630
decimal points and just to write a
smaller units with lots of Zeros after it.

659
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,380
Um,

660
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,970
it's easier in computer terms,

661
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:53,080
the handle numbers that way,

662
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:53,800
but,

663
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,760
but most importantly,

664
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:57,980
it doesn't matter because what you see
on your screen at today might be a bit

665
00:20:57,981 --> 00:20:58,570
coin.

666
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:58,901
Actually,

667
00:20:58,901 --> 00:20:59,860
on my wallets,

668
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,780
I use Millie bet coins,

669
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,260
thousands of a bitcoin because of
corresponds more to my daily purchases.

670
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:05,921
You know,

671
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:09,220
maybe a few years from now you're going
to be using a millions of a bitcoin to

672
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:10,300
look at your balance.

673
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,460
It doesn't matter what you call a unit.

674
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,001
Uh,

675
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:16,780
the point is what value
does it have because someone
else is willing to give you

676
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,130
that amount of money.

677
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:18,470
Well,

678
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,150
but we have like sort of this
established ideal in our hand,

679
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,150
what a dollar is worth.

680
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,300
This is a $100 that looks like
a thousand dollar computer.

681
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:25,660
Sure.

682
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:25,810
You know,

683
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,440
we have this idea in our head and that
idea will be completely out the window.

684
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:33,100
And you started talking about millions
of bitcoins and trying to like figure out

685
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:35,620
like how much is a laptop from tiger dot.

686
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,580
If I buy a laptop,

687
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:39,460
is that 200 millions of a bitcoin?

688
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:39,731
Well,

689
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:39,881
no,

690
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,860
we just talk in millibits and
millibit is almost about a dollars.

691
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,620
It's about 800 something today.

692
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,580
Um,

693
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,060
so,

694
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:46,151
uh,

695
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:46,631
middle of bed.

696
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:48,940
So a computer with cost
you about 1200 millivolts,

697
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,970
1200 megabits.

698
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:50,241
All right,

699
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:55,241
that seems normal as long as we can get
it down to numbers that like correspond

700
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:56,270
with dollars.

701
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,223
But here's the thing,

702
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:57,920
do you know what I mean?

703
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,650
This is a global

704
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,050
bull phenomenon and there are so many
countries out there whether currency,

705
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:06,040
very 30% a year and some
now for 30% a month.

706
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:10,420
And in those countries there is no
stable anything and even the dollar,

707
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,420
we look at it today and we have
this idea of what its value is,

708
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:17,980
but if you look back historically it's
value has been declining for almost a

709
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,850
century now and today's dollar
is worth the same as you know,

710
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:24,700
13 cents at the beginning
of the previous century.

711
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,050
We don't see that on a day to day base
because it's one of the most stable

712
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:29,741
currencies,

713
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:34,300
but there's 193 currencies out
there and 180 of them are far,

714
00:22:34,301 --> 00:22:36,550
far worse than the dollar
in terms of management.

715
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,430
And a couple of handful of
them absolutely horrible.

716
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:43,000
And the people trapped in these
countries can now use bitcoin.

717
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,640
So this is a lot broader
than just the U s dollar.

718
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,360
It's not just a matter of is this
going to be comfy for consumers?

719
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,890
This can bring people from
countries that have extreme poverty,

720
00:22:53,891 --> 00:22:55,030
extreme problems,

721
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,270
that are not necessarily
based on a lack of technology,

722
00:22:58,271 --> 00:22:59,530
that have phones,

723
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:01,270
that can use bitcoin for example.

724
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,030
But because of politics that
trapped in this situation recently,

725
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:08,110
I was in Argentina in Buenos Iris and
now they're having an even worst currency

726
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:08,944
crisis.

727
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:09,400
Uh,

728
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,650
they devalued 18% last week,

729
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,281
uh,

730
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:13,540
locked that lockdown.

731
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,160
They can't take money out of the country.

732
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:17,050
They can't buy things online.

733
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,400
If they buy something online,

734
00:23:18,401 --> 00:23:21,790
they have to go pick it up from a
customs office and pay 50% tax on it.

735
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:22,451
The,

736
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:24,430
the countries trying to lock in the money,

737
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,360
right?

738
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,680
And you have these extreme situations
and then you have a choice suddenly.

739
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:32,020
So bitcoin is a lot bigger than just,

740
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,411
you know,

741
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,330
a consumer thing for here in the u s

742
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,900
how would someone get bitcoins
from those environments?

743
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:38,080
Like,

744
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,800
so let's say you're in some poor third
world country with a really incredibly

745
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,620
corrupt system and fucked up economy.

746
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,250
How someone from

747
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:46,820
that,

748
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,440
that environment get a bitcoin?

749
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,540
Well.

750
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,020
So,

751
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,853
um,

752
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,660
even in Argentina for example,

753
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:53,680
which is not,

754
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:54,230
uh,

755
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,581
you know,

756
00:23:54,581 --> 00:23:57,130
this a second world
country that was once the,

757
00:23:57,131 --> 00:23:57,341
you know,

758
00:23:57,341 --> 00:24:00,190
the Paris of Latin America and
it's still a beautiful place.

759
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,120
Um,

760
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,190
but it has these difficult
political problems.

761
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,510
It's illegal to trade on the
black market dollars for pesos,

762
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,021
right?

763
00:24:08,021 --> 00:24:10,150
So you can't go in and if
you're a tourist and say,

764
00:24:10,151 --> 00:24:10,361
okay,

765
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:12,280
I'm just going to give some
dude on the street to hundred,

766
00:24:12,281 --> 00:24:13,114
that's illegal.

767
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,890
And yet on every street corner,

768
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:16,420
the someone who will sell you pesos.

769
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,550
And last time I went to,

770
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:18,191
I just asked them,

771
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:19,120
will you take bitcoin?

772
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,343
And guess what?

773
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,400
Some of them said,

774
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,271
never heard of it.

775
00:24:22,271 --> 00:24:23,170
And some of them said,

776
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:23,591
yeah,

777
00:24:23,591 --> 00:24:24,610
we're trying to do that now.

778
00:24:24,611 --> 00:24:25,444
Can you help us?

779
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,410
Whoa.

780
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:31,030
So suddenly you have Jordi have this black
market or gray market for currencies.

781
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:31,580
And,

782
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,400
and in the u s you never see this,

783
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,750
but if you travel abroad,

784
00:24:34,751 --> 00:24:35,950
you see this all the time.

785
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,660
Most places in the world,

786
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,080
the official currency rate versus
the one you can get from a corner.

787
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:41,621
Uh,

788
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:41,981
you know,

789
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,390
a street sale seller who is,

790
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:43,601
you know,

791
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:47,710
selling vegetables and the
local currency for dollars.

792
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:48,460
You know,

793
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,890
you can do that to ever in so
many countries in the world.

794
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:52,150
And for them it's a normal thing.

795
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:52,920
Now,

796
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,550
this,

797
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,670
this novel idea of this new currency,

798
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:00,720
is this something that anyone
right now is Lik living off of?

799
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:05,190
Is anybody getting paid by bitcoin and
paying their rent by bitcoin buying their

800
00:25:05,191 --> 00:25:06,390
food with bitcoin?

801
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,701
So first of all,

802
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:08,660
my income is entirely,

803
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,700
bitcoin has been for several months now.

804
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,653
How many months?

805
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,650
Um,

806
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,210
since October perhaps.

807
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:19,610
And before that I just didn't have as
much income because I've been working on

808
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,000
Bitcoin,

809
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,620
you know,

810
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:21,880
to,

811
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,240
to a level almost obsession because it's
such a fascinating technology for me.

812
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:29,000
And as someone who works in
security and distributed systems,

813
00:25:29,001 --> 00:25:29,580
this is,

814
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,030
you know,

815
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,430
a once in a lifetime opportunity to
be involved in something monumental.

816
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:37,950
Just like when I was involved in
the early days of the Internet as,

817
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:38,151
as a,

818
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:42,710
as a young scientist and now I
can do it again with bitcoin.

819
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:43,730
So I've been obsessed,

820
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:48,350
but since October I've also been making
a living off bitcoin and I get paid in

821
00:25:48,351 --> 00:25:48,910
bitcoin.

822
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:49,450
Wow.

823
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,530
And how do you pay your rent?

824
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:54,060
I convert some of it to dollars to pay
my landlord until I can persuade them to

825
00:25:54,061 --> 00:25:54,990
take bitcoin directly.

826
00:25:54,991 --> 00:25:58,620
But it won't take that long because
every time I pay in dollars I say,

827
00:25:58,621 --> 00:25:59,880
would you rather take bitcoin?

828
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,730
And that's one of the easiest
ways to get bitcoin by the ways.

829
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,250
So find someone who wants to
pay for something with bitcoin.

830
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,100
Wow.

831
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,470
And so they're not ready to yet,

832
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,020
but you think that perhaps
they're thinking about it.

833
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,060
I might be able to pay
your rent in bitcoin.

834
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:13,420
I'm

835
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,970
always surprised by WHO's
going to take my bitcoin.

836
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:19,240
Sometimes it's a taxi driver in Germany.

837
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:21,730
Sometimes you know it's a,

838
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:24,850
it's a give it to them that they
install an app on their phone.

839
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:26,790
I'm going to give you some before
the end of the show for sure.

840
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,710
They installed an APP on their phone and
I just zap it across just like I could

841
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:32,050
zap it from hair to Kuala
Lumpur in two seconds.

842
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:33,460
I can stop it across the table.

843
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,900
Whoa.

844
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,500
It's just like sending an email and,

845
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,363
and in fact it's,

846
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,530
it's remarkably similar.

847
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:39,011
I just get,

848
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:42,220
you'll install an app and then
you'll give me your bitcoin address,

849
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:43,980
which is like your email kinda.

850
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,210
And then I'll zap some bitcoin across
the u and few seconds later you'll see it

851
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:49,110
pop up on your phone.

852
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:50,670
And that is real bitcoin.

853
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,090
It's,

854
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,110
and it's on your phone.

855
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,610
It's not sitting in a bank somewhere.

856
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,210
You don't have the promise that
maybe when you try to withdraw it,

857
00:26:56,211 --> 00:26:57,044
you're going to have it.

858
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,133
This isn't,

859
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:58,621
you know,

860
00:26:58,621 --> 00:27:00,180
a credit or something like that.

861
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,420
This is the actual digital
amount is locked by a key
that's on your phone and is

862
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:08,580
recognized by the entire
network is a valid transaction.

863
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,920
If you left your phone
behind in a drunken stupor,

864
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,360
someone got ahold of your phone,

865
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:13,800
could they wreck you financially?

866
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,630
Yeah.

867
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,463
Dammit.

868
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,710
Say No.

869
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,160
So No,

870
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,993
I'm going to be,

871
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,770
I'm going to be 100% honest.

872
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,430
There are,

873
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,410
there are ways to protect yourself.

874
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:22,561
So,

875
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:23,161
for example,

876
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:23,641
on mine,

877
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,480
phone wallet,

878
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,030
first of all it has my phone has a pin.

879
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:28,770
Then my wallet has a pin of its own.

880
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,250
And then there's one thing that I
can't do with a wallet right away,

881
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,630
which is I can't send money.

882
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,680
I can look at my balance,

883
00:27:34,681 --> 00:27:35,341
I can receive money,

884
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:36,720
all of that just with a pin.

885
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,960
But if I want to send money and have to
enter another password or pin personal

886
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:40,950
identification numbers.

887
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:41,200
Yeah.

888
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,730
So I've got a couple of
different passwords so that
my wallet isn't just sitting

889
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:45,270
there.

890
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,320
But again,

891
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:46,801
as I said,

892
00:27:46,801 --> 00:27:47,940
this is digital cash.

893
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:51,390
So if you had a wallet stuffed with
cash and you left isn't a cafe,

894
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:52,350
what happens to it?

895
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,690
Somebody steals it or
you get really lucky.

896
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:55,710
And so when he gives it back to you.

897
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:56,100
Yeah,

898
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,541
exactly.

899
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,374
I'm some of that money.

900
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,080
Exactly.

901
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,913
But most likely,

902
00:27:59,090 --> 00:27:59,341
you know,

903
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:01,140
you don't have someone to call and say,

904
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:01,974
Hey,

905
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,150
get that cash back for me.

906
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:04,680
It was stolen from so-and-so location.

907
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:05,760
It's gone back up.

908
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,271
Yes,

909
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:07,200
you lose your phone.

910
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:08,430
Can you back up from,

911
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,293
from a cloud.

912
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:09,511
Well,

913
00:28:09,511 --> 00:28:12,930
that's the nice thing about it
because unlike physical money,

914
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:13,800
this is digital money.

915
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:14,760
You can make copies of it.

916
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,050
You can't spend both copies,

917
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:17,010
you can only spend one,

918
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,290
but you can make copies
so you can make backups.

919
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,840
You can even back up right
onto a piece of paper,

920
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,150
which is what I do in this
called a paper wallet.

921
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,400
So I have printed pieces of paper with
Bitcoin keys on them and I make two

922
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:34,320
copies and I put one in a safe and I put
the other in a safety deposit box and I

923
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:36,060
send bitcoin to those wallets.

924
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,840
And then I basically have my
bitcoin sitting on paper in a bank.

925
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,930
What kind of like a bearer bond?

926
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,310
It's like a bearer bonds,

927
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:44,611
you know,

928
00:28:44,611 --> 00:28:46,020
or like a stock certificate.

929
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,610
But the only differences that that magic
number that's on there allows me to

930
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:52,530
redeem that bitcoin anywhere in the world.

931
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,630
This is way more sophisticated
than I thought it was.

932
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:56,220
I thought it was a bunch
of dorks running round,

933
00:28:56,221 --> 00:28:58,650
fake fucking duns and dragons money.

934
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,701
Oh No,

935
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:00,210
this is,

936
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,480
this is way more sophisticated.

937
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,380
We'll get to talking about how
you can use this to do stocks,

938
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:04,921
bonds,

939
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:06,120
distributed companies,

940
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:07,350
autonomous companies.

941
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,910
Now when you pay your kinds of things,

942
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,890
when you pay your rent
and you take your bitcoin,

943
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:11,850
you convert it to money,

944
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,620
who's giving you money for Bitcoin?

945
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,940
People want to buy bitcoin.

946
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,890
So how do you find these
people on craigslist?

947
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:18,090
So there's a number of ways.

948
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:18,800
The,

949
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,051
the,

950
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:19,740
the uh,

951
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,940
the straightforward one,

952
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:26,180
if you come from the old banking style
world is you open a brokerage account on

953
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:29,010
a virtual currency exchange
that will exchange dollars,

954
00:29:29,011 --> 00:29:29,371
yen,

955
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:30,120
euros,

956
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,890
whatever to bitcoin or even
some other cryptocurrencies.

957
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,340
And then you can go there
and you can wire transfer,

958
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,150
um,

959
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:39,570
you know,

960
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,710
using your bank account,

961
00:29:40,711 --> 00:29:44,110
you can wire transfer money into the
brokerage account as you would to buy IBM

962
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:44,860
stock.

963
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,220
You wire him some money to your brokerage
and then you buy some IBM stock.

964
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:51,100
Well here you are some money there
and you buy some bitcoin with it.

965
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,180
Whoa.

966
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,840
So traditional brokerages
deal in Bitcoin as well.

967
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,470
No,

968
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,690
this is a specialized exchange
that deals in Bitcoin,

969
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:00,340
but it works just like
a brokerage account.

970
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:04,570
So you have a number of
different currencies in it
and you can buy one and sell

971
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:05,100
the other.

972
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,620
Are there any brokers
who deal in bitcoins,

973
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:08,790
uh,

974
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,620
of like traditional,

975
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,120
large scale?

976
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:12,510
No,

977
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,343
not yet.

978
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,273
Not yet.

979
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,480
But you think that's coming?

980
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:15,901
Oh,

981
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:16,734
absolutely.

982
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,670
Yeah.

983
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,630
Because the thing is,

984
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,051
it's,

985
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:19,884
it's a,

986
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,270
it's one of the skills they have,

987
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,200
right?

988
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,790
They also have the physical locations
and branches to sell bed coin and before

989
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:27,241
long board,

990
00:30:27,241 --> 00:30:29,670
we're going to see as the same thing
that happened in the entertainment

991
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:30,061
industry.

992
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,440
When MP3 hit the scene.

993
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,360
Like at first everyone was like,

994
00:30:33,361 --> 00:30:33,751
Whoa,

995
00:30:33,751 --> 00:30:35,100
we don't want to even touch this.

996
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,780
And then somebody started thinking,

997
00:30:36,781 --> 00:30:37,350
Hey,

998
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,960
if I start playing with
this before everybody else,

999
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,400
it's going to hurt all of us,

1000
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,130
but it's going to hurt me less
than I can start taking advantage.

1001
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,980
And they peel off the herd and boom,

1002
00:30:46,981 --> 00:30:47,791
you have adoption.

1003
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:50,280
And I think the same thing is going
to start happening with banking.

1004
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,540
Wow.

1005
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,410
Some of the banks,

1006
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,660
perhaps not the big six US banks,

1007
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:55,441
they've got a nice,

1008
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:56,020
uh,

1009
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,250
uh,

1010
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:56,761
comfortable,

1011
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:59,910
$70 billion a month
from the Fed right now.

1012
00:30:59,911 --> 00:31:01,020
Why would they do innovation?

1013
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,660
But maybe one of the
more nimble banks may be,

1014
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,231
you know,

1015
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:04,591
in,

1016
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:09,570
in a country like Cyprus that's been hit
hard by these bail ins and you have a

1017
00:31:09,571 --> 00:31:11,310
very open banking environment.

1018
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,040
Maybe Singapore is going to decide
this is a good strategic move.

1019
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,780
May Been Mccall who knows.

1020
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,570
The point is in an international
financial environment,

1021
00:31:18,571 --> 00:31:19,500
all it takes is one.

1022
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,300
Yeah.

1023
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,050
One ball gets rolling and then
creates the avalanche and then,

1024
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,960
and then the stem piece and
then the standard changes.

1025
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,853
Right.

1026
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,850
Wow.

1027
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,110
This is very exciting.

1028
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,820
It's very complex though.

1029
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,010
And this is what I'm trying
to wrap my head around.

1030
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,090
The,

1031
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:41,090
the amount of this bitcoin that's
created every year is limited in fixed.

1032
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,020
Who determined all of this?

1033
00:31:43,021 --> 00:31:43,470
Who Do,

1034
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,670
who created bitcoin?

1035
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:45,990
Who invented the concept?

1036
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:47,310
Was there several people or,

1037
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:47,571
yeah,

1038
00:31:47,571 --> 00:31:48,890
you said when you exchanged money it's,

1039
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,060
it's almost free.

1040
00:31:50,061 --> 00:31:50,481
I heard.

1041
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:52,130
So that money goes somewhere.

1042
00:31:52,131 --> 00:31:53,090
Who's getting this money?

1043
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,820
So this is where it gets
a bit more complicated.

1044
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,690
And,

1045
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:57,260
um,

1046
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,410
but keep in mind the internet in 1992,

1047
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,360
you had to know unix command line skills
to send an email and it took two days

1048
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:05,300
across the network.

1049
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,890
We can get simpler and easier
for most people over time,

1050
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,120
but it's still a bit geeky.

1051
00:32:11,121 --> 00:32:11,451
So I'll,

1052
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:11,661
I'll,

1053
00:32:11,661 --> 00:32:12,380
I'll get into it.

1054
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,490
One question at a time though.

1055
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,830
Who created this?

1056
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,230
So this was created by Satoshi Nakamoto,

1057
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,970
a cryptographer who used an anonymous
identity or pseudonymous identity.

1058
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,241
Uh,

1059
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:23,690
he,

1060
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:28,130
he basically wrote a paper
and the basic software,

1061
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,830
a scientific paper that
explains how it works.

1062
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,520
It's actually the best
way to understand bitcoin.

1063
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,890
If you have a bit of understanding of,

1064
00:32:35,891 --> 00:32:36,890
of basic science,

1065
00:32:36,891 --> 00:32:37,400
you can,

1066
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,060
you can read it.

1067
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,110
It's very accessible.

1068
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,670
And if you look for those Satoshi Nakamoto
bitcoin paper or the bitcoin paper,

1069
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:44,690
you'll find it online.

1070
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:45,501
Um,

1071
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:50,390
so he wrote a paper and at the same time
he created the software that runs the

1072
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:50,900
system,

1073
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,530
right?

1074
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,050
And then gave it out to people
and people started running it.

1075
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,910
Now keep in mind,

1076
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,920
bitcoin is an agreement.

1077
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:58,970
It's a standard.

1078
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:02,960
It's how you do certain things on
the bitcoin network that's matters,

1079
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:03,650
right?

1080
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,930
And then there's software that
implements that agreement.

1081
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:07,460
The runs according to those rules,

1082
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:10,430
just like the internet
doesn't belong to anyone,

1083
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,460
is just an agreement of how you
transmit things across the Internet.

1084
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,820
And then everybody can write
software that can use that standard.

1085
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,830
So Satoshi Nakamoto created
the standards in 2008,

1086
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:22,790
2008.

1087
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:27,790
The paper came out in 2008 and followed
shortly thereafter by the code.

1088
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,240
The discussion actually lasted about
a here as he was mulling this over and

1089
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:32,720
discussing it.

1090
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,351
And keep in mind,

1091
00:33:33,351 --> 00:33:34,700
digital money is not new.

1092
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,420
We've been doing digital money
since the probably the mid eighties.

1093
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:39,410
I think the first,

1094
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,660
a notable one was David showmes,

1095
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:46,661
Digi cash and he created a form of
digital money using the new technology of

1096
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:47,900
cryptography at the time.

1097
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:48,830
Um,

1098
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,590
he and cryptography is,

1099
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:54,530
is a way of scrambling and unscrambling
messages and doing digital signatures

1100
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,640
and using mathematics to,

1101
00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:58,940
to prove things basically on computers.

1102
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:02,180
It's also what you use to protect your
browsing session when you connect to your

1103
00:34:02,181 --> 00:34:05,180
bank and it puts that little
lock that's using cryptography,

1104
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:06,920
you're doing an an an encrypted session.

1105
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,290
So at the time,

1106
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:09,860
uh,

1107
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,980
David Chaum basically
created additional money.

1108
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,610
And what it is is you can have a
number that has a signature on it,

1109
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:17,690
the proof's who owns it.

1110
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,100
And then you can spend that.

1111
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,260
The problem is that you,

1112
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,940
because it's digital,

1113
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:23,750
you can copy it.

1114
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,400
So what happens if you spend it twice?

1115
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:26,234
Well,

1116
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,700
you have to have some
kind of central authority,

1117
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,070
the checks to see that
you don't spend it twice.

1118
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,580
And so he put some servers together
and they could handle all of the

1119
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:39,090
transactions and make sure nobody spent
the money twice and issue the money into

1120
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,700
all of the kind of Federal Reserve Central
Bank functions and then ran it on the

1121
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:44,840
network and it worked.

1122
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,310
So unfortunately,

1123
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:50,480
if you have a central server and you
try to go against the banking system,

1124
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,710
they stomp on you.

1125
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,360
So they stomp on you.

1126
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,460
In this case,

1127
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,293
uh,

1128
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:55,810
there,

1129
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:59,270
there was a series of legal battles and
then eventually the service got down.

1130
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,840
And so we've seen this happen maybe four
or five times with different attempts

1131
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:07,820
to do digital cash with various
levels of centralization.

1132
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,950
But the basic problem was this,

1133
00:35:09,951 --> 00:35:14,030
how do you ensure that the
network remains trusted and honest

1134
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,940
without having someone in the middle
who checks everything and authority?

1135
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,680
How do you put trust?

1136
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:26,510
Not In an institution or central
authority as most hierarchal system work,

1137
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,440
but in a con,

1138
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,480
but spread that trust
across the whole network.

1139
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,620
And in 2008,

1140
00:35:30,621 --> 00:35:34,340
Satoshi Nakamoto solve that problem and
he solved it by putting together four or

1141
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:38,220
five ideas that each of
them had been done somewhat

1142
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:38,790
before,

1143
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:42,900
but he put them together in an incredible
combination that just worked and

1144
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:44,040
worked beautifully.

1145
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,460
So what the system does is
it forces everyone who's
participating on the network

1146
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,680
to do a bit of a computing,

1147
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:53,940
um,

1148
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,601
with our system,

1149
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:55,500
which is called mining.

1150
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,480
And so if you,

1151
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,560
if you just have a wallet,

1152
00:35:58,561 --> 00:35:59,161
you don't do this,

1153
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:03,630
but if you want to be part of
the bitcoin network as a minor,

1154
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:07,260
what you do is you run on a specialized
computer and it solves this very

1155
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:08,094
difficult problem.

1156
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,630
And it's kind of like a competition.

1157
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,470
It's like looking for a
magical number is that,

1158
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,730
that if you plug it into an equation,

1159
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,600
it's,

1160
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,500
it's the right number.

1161
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:16,760
It's,

1162
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,690
it's almost like a global competition,

1163
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,760
like solving a giant Sudoku puzzle.

1164
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,020
So everyone's trying,

1165
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,100
and then somebody,

1166
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:27,210
every 10 minutes on average finds a
solution and that becomes a new block of

1167
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:28,044
transactions.

1168
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,940
And when they find that solution,

1169
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,710
they get some bitcoin,

1170
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,461
which is new.

1171
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:34,050
Bitcoin is created for the first time.

1172
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:34,740
I'm confused.

1173
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,010
Yeah,

1174
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:35,843
I know.

1175
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,590
Find a solution for what?

1176
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,653
All right.

1177
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,880
So basically the idea is everybody's
trying to find a way to create a new block

1178
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,490
of transactions,

1179
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,300
right?

1180
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,990
And in this block they also get
a reward for creating the block.

1181
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,630
What is a block of transactions?

1182
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,510
It's basically,

1183
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,673
um,

1184
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,240
it's basically a,

1185
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,920
an entry on the ledger.

1186
00:36:58,921 --> 00:36:59,754
So,

1187
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,050
as I mentioned before,

1188
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,100
there's,

1189
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,850
um,

1190
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,100
there's a way to have,

1191
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:08,340
there's a central transaction ledger where
you can see everybody's transactions.

1192
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,870
In order to write on that,

1193
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:13,620
in order to create a new transaction
to the entire network trusts,

1194
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,720
you have to solve a
very difficult problem.

1195
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,100
Right.

1196
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,480
But if you do solve the problem,

1197
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,740
you get a reward in bitcoin.

1198
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,360
When you say you solved the problem,

1199
00:37:21,361 --> 00:37:23,760
is someone physically sitting in front
of their computer trying to solve the

1200
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:24,660
problem of the computers?

1201
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,130
The shooter,

1202
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:25,331
yeah.

1203
00:37:25,331 --> 00:37:25,510
Okay.

1204
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,460
So their computer,

1205
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:28,020
you're using their CPU power.

1206
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,621
Yes.

1207
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,240
But essentially,

1208
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:29,520
yes,

1209
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,060
exactly.

1210
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:30,540
Okay.

1211
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,800
So runs in the background,

1212
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,270
it's called commercial of work.

1213
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,501
You do a,

1214
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:36,270
you're run a program
that does proof of work,

1215
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:38,310
which is basically solving
this difficult problem.

1216
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,450
So is this in some way like sort
of similar in fact to how Bitcoin,

1217
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,160
how bit torrent works,

1218
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,020
where bid corn bid torrent you,

1219
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:48,720
you leave it on like if
you're a sh a file share,

1220
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,830
like how bands can spread their music
that way they put their files online,

1221
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:53,940
let people know where there are,

1222
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,900
then people seed it
and then they all just,

1223
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,610
every,

1224
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,410
every bitcoin wallet works like that.

1225
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,860
It's like a little bit torrent clients
and it talks to all the wallets and

1226
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:02,700
confined on the,

1227
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:04,320
on the network and communicates.

1228
00:38:04,321 --> 00:38:07,230
But there are some
specialized systems which,

1229
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:09,690
which do this computation problem very,

1230
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:14,190
very fast and they're big and noisy and
have lots of fans because it's gotten

1231
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:14,971
very competitive.

1232
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:17,850
So people upgraded their stuff and then
they upgraded it again and then they

1233
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:18,690
upgrade it again.

1234
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:22,050
And it's caused this kind of an
arms race of computing power.

1235
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:24,530
But the basic idea is that you,

1236
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,350
you,

1237
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,410
you buy a box that has this
ability to solve the problem.

1238
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:31,800
You plug it into the network and it
runs and it chews up electricity and it

1239
00:38:31,801 --> 00:38:32,640
glides bitcoin.

1240
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,980
A dedicated box to try to help solve

1241
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,281
this,

1242
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:38,170
and in the meantime it makes money.

1243
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,340
Yeah,

1244
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,210
and it makes a bit of money.

1245
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:42,430
And people join in groups
that are called pools,

1246
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,630
just like playing a lottery.

1247
00:38:43,631 --> 00:38:44,441
Put this while I look.

1248
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:45,160
This guy,

1249
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,761
this guy is,

1250
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:46,960
this is his servers.

1251
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,550
These are all the Bitcoin solvers,

1252
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,530
if I'm not mistaken.

1253
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:51,280
This is a,

1254
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,521
yeah,

1255
00:38:51,521 --> 00:38:53,110
this is a liquid cool.

1256
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:56,170
A rack system for folks who
haven't seen this photo,

1257
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:57,040
if you're listening to this,

1258
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:58,390
which is the majority of our people,

1259
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,590
what are they googling?

1260
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,161
Brian?

1261
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:00,860
What's the image?

1262
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,080
Coin Mining.

1263
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:02,914
It's the first one.

1264
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,671
Coin Mining.

1265
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:04,900
Jesus fucking Christ.

1266
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:06,100
You have to see this picture folks,

1267
00:39:06,101 --> 00:39:06,791
when you get home.

1268
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:07,720
Bitcoin mining,

1269
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,580
they have goddamn rooms filled with
computers that they're making bitcoin when

1270
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:13,840
we're in the matrix.

1271
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,400
So we're here,

1272
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:15,950
let me just,

1273
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:16,900
Damn Matrix.

1274
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,130
Holy Shit.

1275
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,510
This is crazy.

1276
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:20,410
There's somebody's house.

1277
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:25,411
So the bitcoin network today is bigger
than the world's top several hundred

1278
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:28,180
super computers combined.

1279
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:34,090
It's the largest single computing
experiment on the Internet ever.

1280
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,010
What's using more internet juice,

1281
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,260
bitcoin or porn at the moment?

1282
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:38,710
Bitcoin.

1283
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,030
That's not possible,

1284
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:40,810
son.

1285
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,250
You're talking crazy,

1286
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,460
but it's also a,

1287
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:47,260
it's also generating an entire
new economy based on that.

1288
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,280
How much prostitution has
been paid for in Bitcoin.

1289
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,133
Is that possible?

1290
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,150
I have no ideas.

1291
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,293
Are you sure?

1292
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,280
100% sure that.

1293
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,330
Wow.

1294
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:55,601
No,

1295
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,434
you're just guessing.

1296
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,430
You're not 100% sure.

1297
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,930
You're pretty sure you can't say out of
all the people on the road that's sluts

1298
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,830
or one uses super peak sloughed.

1299
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,670
What if you find the first one today?

1300
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,141
All right.

1301
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:09,540
Let me give you an argument
for why that might touch.

1302
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:10,374
That makes sense.

1303
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,030
If you're a sex worker,

1304
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:17,120
one of the problems better world have
is you're going to get extorted and

1305
00:40:18,121 --> 00:40:21,030
exploited for that money and
you're not going to keep any of it.

1306
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:22,980
With a bitcoin wallet,

1307
00:40:22,981 --> 00:40:27,750
you can basically hide that money and
you can also take it in a way that cannot

1308
00:40:27,751 --> 00:40:29,370
be taken away from you,

1309
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,323
not easily.

1310
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,520
So you know there's just take your phone.

1311
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,133
Nope,

1312
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,910
not so easy.

1313
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:36,151
No.

1314
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:37,380
Because it's backed up and,

1315
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:37,890
right,

1316
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:38,723
exactly.

1317
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:39,440
Yeah.

1318
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,280
I mean you're not carrying physical cash.

1319
00:40:41,281 --> 00:40:43,230
It's a much safer exchange.

1320
00:40:43,231 --> 00:40:48,231
And so there are many reasons why in many
different environments where money is

1321
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:49,314
difficult,

1322
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:49,681
uh,

1323
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:51,000
that bitcoin is successful.

1324
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,080
And here's the thing,

1325
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,850
bitcoin is very efficient money.

1326
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,500
It's a very good system of money.

1327
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:59,220
If you can send money like an
email anywhere in the world will,

1328
00:40:59,221 --> 00:40:59,581
yeah,

1329
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:00,780
it's tremendously useful.

1330
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,280
And so in places,

1331
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:07,200
and that includes criminal activities
where it's difficult to move money.

1332
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,090
Bitcoin is going to be good for that.

1333
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,880
Regulate the point because
at the end of the day,

1334
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:14,520
there's another 6 billion of us
want to do good things with it.

1335
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,810
And just like on the Internet,

1336
00:41:15,811 --> 00:41:17,310
you can use it for crime,

1337
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,680
but it gives so much more to humanity.

1338
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,350
Of course you can use bitcoin
for crime you can use,

1339
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,810
but the reality is US
dollars are used for crime.

1340
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:30,050
The currency in the Washington
prostitution is the most
ridiculous crime ever.

1341
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:31,910
It's so should be legal.

1342
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,070
It's so that people can

1343
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,210
have sex for free,

1344
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,740
but they can't have sex for money.

1345
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,621
How come you give him,

1346
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:39,830
give massages for money and massages?

1347
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:40,670
A prostitution.

1348
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,510
Okay.

1349
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,170
They are,

1350
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,400
they might as well be prostitution.

1351
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,480
They're awesome.

1352
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:45,111
Don't get me wrong,

1353
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:46,340
I love massages,

1354
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,900
but it's fucking prostitution.

1355
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,400
The person doesn't want to rub you,

1356
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,660
whether it's a guy or a girl,

1357
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:51,650
you want them to rub you,

1358
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:52,281
you give them money,

1359
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:52,821
they rub you.

1360
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:53,481
They even pretend.

1361
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:54,320
They like rubbing you.

1362
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,610
They bring you water,

1363
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:56,361
they get you a towel.

1364
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:58,700
They don't give a fuck about that towel.

1365
00:41:58,701 --> 00:41:59,300
Bullshit.

1366
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,110
Come on man.

1367
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:00,560
That's the,

1368
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,610
that's part of the Gig.

1369
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:02,271
Part of the,

1370
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:03,830
that's the part of the prostitution gig.

1371
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:09,730
The idea that in 2014 it's still illegal
to pay someone for sex is so stupid.

1372
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,650
Not even handjobs nothing.

1373
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,023
No Penis.

1374
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,073
Can't touch it.

1375
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,550
It's a bad place.

1376
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,190
It's a bad place and you can't have
money involved in your bad place.

1377
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,440
It's like paying money for crime.

1378
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,640
You call it crime.

1379
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:23,961
I just found out.

1380
00:42:23,961 --> 00:42:24,780
Yes,

1381
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,960
it's being used for prostitution.

1382
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:27,321
Uh,

1383
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:30,680
the first one was September
of this year or last year.

1384
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:31,341
Passion,

1385
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,410
VIP and escort agency in England.

1386
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:33,890
Since they had,

1387
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,690
now I've accepted bitcoins as payment,

1388
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,430
godspeed to you,

1389
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,740
passionate Gip in England,

1390
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:39,860
Godspeed to you.

1391
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,140
So now we know that kind of crime,

1392
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:42,860
but let's,

1393
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,180
let's separate ourselves
from such controversial talk
because this could really

1394
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:48,800
screw people's up.

1395
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,720
Their idea of what bitcoin really is.

1396
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:51,891
No,

1397
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:52,590
I mean,

1398
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,280
here's the thing.

1399
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,320
Bitcoin is not just money,

1400
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:59,550
but when is an invention and what that
invention allows people to do is move

1401
00:42:59,551 --> 00:43:00,900
value across the Internet.

1402
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,570
And that invention means
you can do bitcoin,

1403
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,970
but it also means you can
do a lot of other things.

1404
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:09,600
And bitcoin is an incredible
invention because it,

1405
00:43:09,601 --> 00:43:10,590
for the first time,

1406
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:11,590
it completely democratized,

1407
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:12,301
democratizes money.

1408
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:17,301
It's separates money from a function
of power of the state to an individual

1409
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:21,360
exchange between people like it's used
to be when it was shells and feathers,

1410
00:43:21,361 --> 00:43:21,960
right?

1411
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,880
Or um,

1412
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,281
you know,

1413
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:24,240
barter exchange.

1414
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,720
But the beauty of it is that it can,

1415
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,411
at the moment,

1416
00:43:28,411 --> 00:43:29,370
if you think about it,

1417
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:30,480
there is,

1418
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,960
let's say a billion people in the
western world who have not just banking

1419
00:43:33,961 --> 00:43:34,621
facilities,

1420
00:43:34,621 --> 00:43:36,600
but like turbocharged power banking.

1421
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:38,160
They have international transactions.

1422
00:43:38,161 --> 00:43:39,930
They can buy stocks on any stock market.

1423
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,640
They can do wire transfers,

1424
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:43,440
some of them are credited investors,

1425
00:43:43,441 --> 00:43:44,250
et cetera.

1426
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:45,630
The power user of banking,

1427
00:43:45,631 --> 00:43:50,580
there's another may be 2 billion people
who have a basic bank account and then

1428
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:51,480
there's the rest of them,

1429
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:52,230
right?

1430
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:52,531
The,

1431
00:43:52,531 --> 00:43:57,531
the giant majority of the population on
this planet has very limited access to

1432
00:43:58,981 --> 00:43:59,430
banking,

1433
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:03,030
very limited access to
international finance,

1434
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:03,990
to lending,

1435
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:05,010
to capitol,

1436
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,070
to uh,

1437
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,240
the ability to even change
their money to another currency.

1438
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,880
And so bitcoin is so much
more important for them.

1439
00:44:11,881 --> 00:44:15,480
I call this the other 6 billion just
keeps the focus on the other 6 billion

1440
00:44:15,481 --> 00:44:18,150
because for the billion it might be a fad,

1441
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,710
but for the other 6 billion,

1442
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,920
this is an opportunity to change the way
we deal with poverty and to change the

1443
00:44:25,351 --> 00:44:27,810
way we unite the economic
system of the planet,

1444
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,970
which is a whole other
level of compensation.

1445
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,100
It will look at bitcoin
and we think of it as

1446
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,933
just money,

1447
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,340
but it's not just money for the Internet.

1448
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,500
Money for the Internet is what it does.

1449
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,700
And it does it very well.

1450
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:44,040
But it's the intranet of money and it
allows people at the edge by downloading

1451
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:49,100
just a simple application to join an
economy and then to hold their own money

1452
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,350
without any state or corporation.

1453
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:56,100
Being able to steal it from them or
inflated how to value and destroy their

1454
00:44:56,101 --> 00:44:57,120
children's future.

1455
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,510
It allows them to hold and control
that money and send it to anyone in the

1456
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:00,781
world.

1457
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:04,140
They want to instantly
for very little money.

1458
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:09,230
I mean that's never happened before and
the implications that has for poverty,

1459
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:15,240
for did the developing world for the way
non governmental organizations work is

1460
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:16,074
staggering.

1461
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,580
Just take one example.

1462
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:20,940
International remittances at the moment,

1463
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:25,890
500 or so billion dollars cent
every year from the first world,

1464
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,750
two countries in the developing world,

1465
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:28,620
right.

1466
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,540
And out of that money,

1467
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,850
74 billion gets spent in fees,

1468
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,730
fees as high as 30 or 40% in fact,

1469
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:36,720
the poor of the country,

1470
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,090
the higher the percentage
of fee you have to pay.

1471
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:43,200
So Somalia and my migrants in
the u s who sending $100 home,

1472
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,150
only 70 gets to the,

1473
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:46,350
to the,

1474
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:51,350
to the wife or the brother back home or
the husband back home and the rest gets

1475
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:53,730
chewed out by the money
transfer companies.

1476
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:59,030
Now we give the developed world 150 or
so billion and then we to the richest and

1477
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:04,050
hope it trickles down and then we
take 74 billion from the poorest.

1478
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,610
What if we could change that?

1479
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:10,560
What if we could enable bitcoin
remittances and international payments and

1480
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:14,730
redeliver that 74 billion of their
money and allow them to send that money

1481
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:16,590
directly home without paying that fee?

1482
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,550
That changes the lives
of a billion people.

1483
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:21,710
Wow.

1484
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:25,280
So you envisioned bitcoin as
being a universal currency.

1485
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:25,971
Absolutely.

1486
00:46:25,971 --> 00:46:26,780
It already is.

1487
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,700
Will it absorb the dollar or the,

1488
00:46:28,701 --> 00:46:32,370
will the dollar go away with a
doll coexist along with bitcoin?

1489
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,680
Like what is your hope for this?

1490
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:34,891
Well,

1491
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:38,670
I mean I think that like many disruptive
technologies is going to change the

1492
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:39,421
power balance.

1493
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,670
It's not that the dollar goes
away of the banking system,

1494
00:46:41,671 --> 00:46:42,091
goes away,

1495
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:46,410
it just has less power and less relevance
in a new world where people control

1496
00:46:46,411 --> 00:46:47,970
their own money and can
send it to each other.

1497
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:51,580
So ultimately the grand
hope is that the money,

1498
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,340
the dollar that we see
today becomes in the future.

1499
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,810
Much like the written letter,

1500
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,210
no fucking need it anymore.

1501
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,260
You can send emails,

1502
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,730
you send someone a text message,

1503
00:47:00,731 --> 00:47:04,360
you have to get on a fucking pony and
carry your mail over to another state.

1504
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:05,320
Yes.

1505
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,101
And the thing is,

1506
00:47:06,101 --> 00:47:08,290
the dollar again is the
world reserve currency.

1507
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:09,220
And there's only one of it.

1508
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:12,370
Now are there 193 other currencies that,

1509
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,070
that some of them may
end up getting replaced?

1510
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:15,640
Uh,

1511
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,730
some of them may end up even
converting into cryptocurrencies.

1512
00:47:18,731 --> 00:47:19,650
Have a nation states,

1513
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:19,931
you know,

1514
00:47:19,931 --> 00:47:20,530
like,

1515
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:20,980
I don't know,

1516
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,940
Thailand coin,

1517
00:47:21,941 --> 00:47:22,774
why not?

1518
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,090
Or Fed coin if we're doing it here.

1519
00:47:25,091 --> 00:47:30,091
But the point is that we can't judge
bitcoin on the standard of the most

1520
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:32,530
comfortable world reserve currency.

1521
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:35,170
That's the most stable currents we
have to look at the rest of the world.

1522
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:37,420
And see what their currencies are like.

1523
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:38,370
And in many cars,

1524
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:39,243
countries,

1525
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:43,240
the currency is worth less than goat shit
because you can burn goat shed longer

1526
00:47:43,241 --> 00:47:46,540
than you can burn these bundles of
paper money that doesn't burn very well,

1527
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,171
you know,

1528
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:48,370
and in in those countries,

1529
00:47:48,371 --> 00:47:50,050
this is not a matter of shopping.

1530
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:54,910
This is a matter of of the future of
their children and it's a matter of

1531
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:55,744
development.

1532
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,020
Wow,

1533
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:57,440
that's,

1534
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:58,850
that's really fascinating.

1535
00:47:59,390 --> 00:47:59,781
It's,

1536
00:47:59,781 --> 00:48:03,290
it's one of the concerns
as far as security.

1537
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:07,600
What are the concerns as far as
if someone steals your bitcoins,

1538
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:11,210
is there any sort of a regulatory
body that can determine whether or not

1539
00:48:11,211 --> 00:48:15,260
someone's computer or phones been hacked
into and their big bitcoin's had been

1540
00:48:15,261 --> 00:48:16,080
stolen?

1541
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:16,913
I mean I have,

1542
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:19,910
has that become an issue yet
or is that a potential issue?

1543
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,050
It is a potential issue and it
has become an issue and yeah,

1544
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:24,980
people have had their bitcoin stolen.

1545
00:48:24,981 --> 00:48:25,490
You,

1546
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:26,450
how has that happened?

1547
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,020
What is their computer gets hacked and
then they have a password on the account,

1548
00:48:30,021 --> 00:48:31,370
but they don't have like,

1549
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:31,940
um,

1550
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,181
you know,

1551
00:48:32,181 --> 00:48:35,150
one of the things you can do very easily
is set up what's called two factor

1552
00:48:35,151 --> 00:48:35,811
authentication.

1553
00:48:35,811 --> 00:48:38,420
So every time you tried to
use your bitcoin wallet,

1554
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:41,690
it sends you a little text message and
you have to enter the secret code like

1555
00:48:41,691 --> 00:48:43,250
you do with your bank height.

1556
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,260
Slightly higher on the socio
computer's been hacked.

1557
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,460
They don't get the text messages,

1558
00:48:46,461 --> 00:48:47,960
they can't easily get into your account.

1559
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:48,860
What does that,

1560
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:49,970
that article you just brought up,

1561
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:50,570
Brian,

1562
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,040
this is the latest hack.

1563
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:54,320
I know that Bitcoin has
been hacked a few times,

1564
00:48:54,321 --> 00:48:56,540
but this last one was
one point $2 million.

1565
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,200
And there's an article on wired called
1.2 million hacks shows why you should

1566
00:49:00,201 --> 00:49:02,270
never store bitcoins on the Internet.

1567
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:03,190
Uh,

1568
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:03,480
what,

1569
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,730
what happens to something like that?

1570
00:49:04,731 --> 00:49:05,810
That they just lost this,

1571
00:49:05,811 --> 00:49:06,021
right?

1572
00:49:06,021 --> 00:49:06,530
There's no,

1573
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:07,940
there's no getting this back.

1574
00:49:07,941 --> 00:49:08,460
And,

1575
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:12,030
and is there somebody that
like a group of people that um,

1576
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,390
that you think is responsible for this or?

1577
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:15,500
Well,

1578
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:15,651
no,

1579
00:49:15,651 --> 00:49:17,750
I mean there's always been a,

1580
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,460
a thriving hacker underground that a,

1581
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,470
that he uses the most
efficient way to steal money.

1582
00:49:24,471 --> 00:49:28,880
And so they stole money from targets by
compromising all of those credit cards

1583
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:29,810
just a few weeks ago.

1584
00:49:29,811 --> 00:49:32,810
And that affected her a lot more
people than any of these thefts.

1585
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,440
And you know that they're going
to go after wherever the money is.

1586
00:49:36,441 --> 00:49:38,360
And if the efficient money is bitcoin,

1587
00:49:38,361 --> 00:49:39,590
they're going to go after bitcoin too.

1588
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:40,880
But here's the trick,

1589
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:45,620
because this money is controlled through
mathematical security and because it's

1590
00:49:45,621 --> 00:49:46,400
programmable,

1591
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,210
we can actually create new ways of
securing money so we can innovate,

1592
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:52,670
whether it's the paper
wallet example I gave you,

1593
00:49:52,671 --> 00:49:56,240
where you can create a physical copy
that you can secure old style in a safe

1594
00:49:56,241 --> 00:49:57,080
deposit box,

1595
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:59,840
whether it's using
multisignature transactions,

1596
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,250
where for example,

1597
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:02,840
the money is locked and it takes,

1598
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,350
uh,

1599
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:05,750
two keys or three keys to unlock it.

1600
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,100
So for example,

1601
00:50:07,101 --> 00:50:09,800
you can have a backup company
that provides the second key.

1602
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,170
And so if you lose the primary key,

1603
00:50:12,171 --> 00:50:13,490
you could use the secondary key.

1604
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,260
You can do digital backups,

1605
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:16,040
you can do,

1606
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,270
you can do time locks,

1607
00:50:17,271 --> 00:50:21,230
you can do all kinds of things now with
money because it's programmable that

1608
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,540
allow you to create new
ways of securing it.

1609
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,490
So it's still very early,

1610
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,390
early days.

1611
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:27,080
Um,

1612
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:27,321
you know,

1613
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:27,741
some,

1614
00:50:27,741 --> 00:50:32,300
some people who don't take care put too
much of their bitcoin in one place and

1615
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:32,571
yeah,

1616
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,800
that's not a very good idea.

1617
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:35,030
They have weak passwords.

1618
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:36,103
So in this happened,

1619
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,690
when these people lost
1.2 million in Bitcoin,

1620
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,160
there's no bringing that back.

1621
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:41,030
There's no tracing it.

1622
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,850
There's no find out where it went or
their social securities and these bitcoins

1623
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,030
or numbers rather than
these bitcoins that nope,

1624
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:48,081
like dollar bills,

1625
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:48,261
you know,

1626
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:49,094
they'd trace like back

1627
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,083
it's cash.

1628
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:50,440
No,

1629
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,070
it's because it's digital.

1630
00:50:52,071 --> 00:50:52,790
I mean,

1631
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,320
this is one of the key,

1632
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:55,663
um,

1633
00:50:55,790 --> 00:51:00,790
one of the key controls in the system is
that it's like teleporting the digital

1634
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:01,880
cash and you know,

1635
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:02,510
once it,

1636
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:06,080
it's not on your Tele
Porter pad and it's gone,

1637
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,990
you just hope the other teleporter
we'll send it back to you.

1638
00:51:08,991 --> 00:51:10,610
Cause otherwise it's gone.

1639
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,320
I mean it's digital cash.

1640
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:15,560
It can go very easily
because it flows very easily.

1641
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:16,580
Um,

1642
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:21,080
so what we're doing at the moment is
developing new security techniques to make

1643
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:23,120
it both harder to steal in the,

1644
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,840
in the first place to have
backups so that you can,

1645
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,650
um,

1646
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,030
so they couldn't get back if a,

1647
00:51:29,031 --> 00:51:32,780
if a key stolen before it's used and
there's all kinds of things we can do to

1648
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:33,614
make this better.

1649
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:34,970
It's still early days.

1650
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:39,070
There was a story about that guy who
left his bitcoin on his hard drive and

1651
00:51:39,071 --> 00:51:42,340
tossed it out accidentally
and it's worth $9 million.

1652
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,090
Right.

1653
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:44,290
I'm sure you're aware of that story.

1654
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:44,781
Yeah.

1655
00:51:44,781 --> 00:51:45,271
This was in,

1656
00:51:45,271 --> 00:51:45,680
uh,

1657
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,161
this was,

1658
00:51:46,161 --> 00:51:46,630
uh,

1659
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:49,490
an England and throughout the,

1660
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:52,970
actually all that happened is that a
lot of people showed up at the local

1661
00:51:52,971 --> 00:51:54,090
landfill with a,

1662
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,130
with metal detectors.

1663
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:57,820
So a lot of people were looking
for this treasure hunters.

1664
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:58,030
Again,

1665
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:58,863
we're trying to steal it.

1666
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,181
Well,

1667
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:01,280
digital treasure hunting
is going to be a thing,

1668
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:02,300
a part of our future.

1669
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:02,470
Yeah.

1670
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:02,881
So you've got,

1671
00:52:02,881 --> 00:52:05,510
people are going to like
find old hard drives.

1672
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:08,340
When my 2013 and I looked
for bitcoins on them,

1673
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,680
well I love stories like this.

1674
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:12,530
I was on Reddit the other day and
I was reading this great story.

1675
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:13,730
This student who said,

1676
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:14,421
you know,

1677
00:52:14,421 --> 00:52:19,330
back in 2010 I did some bitcoin mining
on my laptop and I just found that wallet

1678
00:52:19,331 --> 00:52:19,791
and it says,

1679
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:21,890
I have 917 bitcoin.

1680
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:25,970
Am I rich or am I missing something
because this would really change my life.

1681
00:52:25,971 --> 00:52:28,190
I've got student loans and the guy had,

1682
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:28,521
you know,

1683
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:33,521
at the time it was a $900,000 worth of
bitcoin that he had found from a laptop.

1684
00:52:34,391 --> 00:52:36,860
He left laying around in
2010 and did some mining,

1685
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:39,560
and that story is great
and it's happened many,

1686
00:52:39,561 --> 00:52:40,341
many times.

1687
00:52:40,341 --> 00:52:40,941
So did it,

1688
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:43,970
that guy sell that and become
like almost a millionaire.

1689
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:44,510
Yup.

1690
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:45,343
That's insane.

1691
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,790
And this was a student who was like,

1692
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:48,590
I'm having trouble with my student loans.

1693
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:48,920
You know,

1694
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,180
this could really help me.

1695
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:51,490
Am I too am I?

1696
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:52,670
He couldn't believe it.

1697
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:52,971
He was like,

1698
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:54,020
I might see this wrong.

1699
00:52:54,021 --> 00:52:55,100
That's from mining.

1700
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:55,731
So,

1701
00:52:55,731 --> 00:52:56,001
okay,

1702
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:56,271
let's,

1703
00:52:56,271 --> 00:52:56,460
let's

1704
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,440
good crazy talking monkey studios here.

1705
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,340
We decided to start a mining up.

1706
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:01,240
Don't,

1707
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:01,810
don't,

1708
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:02,560
don't know.

1709
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,030
I mean it's the high
trying to win $1 million.

1710
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:05,280
It's like,

1711
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:05,880
I'm sorry,

1712
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,270
which tells me we don't know so well,

1713
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:07,691
I'll sign.

1714
00:53:07,691 --> 00:53:08,524
I had it figured out.

1715
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:09,940
So the,

1716
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:10,211
the,

1717
00:53:10,211 --> 00:53:13,510
the reason people have been successful
with bitcoin is because they got

1718
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:17,500
interested in the technology went only
a few thousand people knew about it and

1719
00:53:17,501 --> 00:53:18,430
when they got involved,

1720
00:53:18,431 --> 00:53:19,100
at that point,

1721
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,980
bitcoins were worth like a hundredth of
a penny or a thousandth of a penny and

1722
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:25,530
now they're worth a $2.

1723
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:27,630
So if you ended up mining some,

1724
00:53:27,631 --> 00:53:29,670
then even if you only mind a few,

1725
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:30,623
you know,

1726
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,410
plus it was a lot easier to mind then
because over time the network adjust the

1727
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:34,981
difficulty.

1728
00:53:34,981 --> 00:53:36,180
So the more people trying,

1729
00:53:36,181 --> 00:53:37,230
the harder it gets.

1730
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,750
So the network is autonomous,

1731
00:53:39,751 --> 00:53:41,200
there's no centralized server,

1732
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,730
there's no central anything.

1733
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:42,990
It's,

1734
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:47,010
it's a series of rules that everybody
follows and it's hard to grasp at first

1735
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:50,010
because we've never seen this
type of distributed organization.

1736
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:55,100
And is there any organization
whatsoever as far as like a CEO,

1737
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:56,820
Doris,

1738
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,270
does that money go then every
time the transaction goes?

1739
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:01,950
Is it good just Atashi Nakamoto?

1740
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:02,100
No,

1741
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:02,331
no,

1742
00:54:02,331 --> 00:54:03,164
no.

1743
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,590
If they even exist,

1744
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:06,840
there's not even a real picture of him
anywhere on the Internet and no one's

1745
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:08,400
actually ever confirmed his identity.

1746
00:54:08,401 --> 00:54:09,450
So it could be just the government

1747
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:12,020
or anonymous.

1748
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,120
It's an invisible hacker visit,

1749
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:16,020
physically invisible.

1750
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:19,900
So all of the people who are
doing the mining who have the,

1751
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:20,201
the,

1752
00:54:20,201 --> 00:54:21,031
the hardware in a,

1753
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:22,860
using it to mine for Bitcoin,

1754
00:54:22,861 --> 00:54:27,690
what they do is they secure the network
by running this very hard problem.

1755
00:54:27,691 --> 00:54:30,750
They prevent anyone else from cheating
because in order to essentially they end

1756
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:35,670
up voting on every block together with
this enormous computing power and that

1757
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:39,480
enormous computing power means no one
can falsify the block because they would

1758
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:43,650
have to do that much computing
power to falsify the the ledger,

1759
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:44,370
right?

1760
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:47,850
So if you can't falsify it without doing
enormous amounts of computing power,

1761
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:51,420
but if you do enormous amounts of
computing power that you get a reward and

1762
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:56,421
bitcoin while you're going to try and win
the game rather than cheat cheating is

1763
00:54:57,091 --> 00:54:58,890
extremely difficult and not rewarding.

1764
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,980
Whereas participating is rewarding.

1765
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:02,760
I see.

1766
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,270
Right.

1767
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:08,160
So all of these miners are working
and what they do is they verify the

1768
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:10,890
transactions and they
secure the entire network,

1769
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:13,590
which actually if you look at it
on the grand scheme of things,

1770
00:55:13,591 --> 00:55:18,591
is a lot cheaper than guards and armored
trucks and alarm companies and faults

1771
00:55:19,531 --> 00:55:22,350
and data centers and fraud
prevention center is,

1772
00:55:22,351 --> 00:55:25,290
and all of those things that we have
in our traditional payment system,

1773
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:28,920
it's actually a lot cheaper to do it
by proving you're doing all of this

1774
00:55:28,921 --> 00:55:30,960
computation for the network security.

1775
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,210
Now they collect fees.

1776
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,280
So when they verify a block,

1777
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:38,970
the person who manages the verify at
first by finding this little magic number,

1778
00:55:38,971 --> 00:55:40,140
the solution to the problem,

1779
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:41,550
I'll explain that in a second,

1780
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:43,500
collects the fees that are in the block.

1781
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:45,280
So all of the transactions
that get verified.

1782
00:55:45,281 --> 00:55:46,470
Then the next 10 minutes,

1783
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:49,260
the miner who finds that block will
collect all of the little fees.

1784
00:55:49,261 --> 00:55:50,011
40 cents here,

1785
00:55:50,011 --> 00:55:51,630
40 cents they are 40 cents there.

1786
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:55,740
It's about 40 40 cents to send a simple
transaction right now and they'll also

1787
00:55:55,741 --> 00:55:59,670
get a reward of 25 bitcoin and then
everyone will start the race again to,

1788
00:55:59,671 --> 00:56:03,030
to verify the next block of transactions
for the next 10 minutes of spending.

1789
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,530
And the first one to find the
solution wins gets the reward,

1790
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,750
gets the fees and they
all start competing again.

1791
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,340
But you don't know who's going to win it.

1792
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:15,300
And the enormous amount of computation
that goes into its ensures that no one

1793
00:56:15,301 --> 00:56:16,134
can cheat.

1794
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:20,310
Even if you put together the 600 most
powerful supercomputers in the world,

1795
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,890
you would not be able to get to
to beat the system right now.

1796
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:28,600
What a fascinating element to be
added to the idea of the economy.

1797
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:28,901
This,

1798
00:56:28,901 --> 00:56:33,901
this idea of the unified
group of computers working
on ever increasingly complex

1799
00:56:35,021 --> 00:56:35,980
computations.

1800
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,890
So the scientific term for it
is a consensus assets ledger,

1801
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:43,130
which means it's a lighter or
list of transactions about assets.

1802
00:56:43,131 --> 00:56:43,611
In this case,

1803
00:56:43,611 --> 00:56:48,290
bitcoin that's based on consensus on
agreement and the agreement is reached by

1804
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:50,420
everyone voting with
their computing power.

1805
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,580
And because there's so much of it,

1806
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:53,720
you can't cheat the election.

1807
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:54,631
Now,

1808
00:56:54,631 --> 00:56:58,950
when you said that there have been other
attempts at a new type of currency that

1809
00:56:58,951 --> 00:57:02,040
had been shut down by the
current banking system,

1810
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:07,560
that was because they had a place where
they had centralized servers exactly

1811
00:57:07,561 --> 00:57:08,780
operated or the centralized service

1812
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,860
or a centralized organization
or a centralized something.

1813
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:12,820
What did they do to stop it?

1814
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:13,271
That movie?

1815
00:57:13,271 --> 00:57:17,130
Is there any legality issues when it
comes to doing something like this or

1816
00:57:17,131 --> 00:57:19,470
creating a new type of currency?

1817
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:20,601
Oh sure.

1818
00:57:20,601 --> 00:57:20,691
Oh,

1819
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:21,340
there's this,

1820
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,480
there's an enormous legality issues.

1821
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:28,481
I mean the banking system
has this fortress wall of
regulations around it that

1822
00:57:29,031 --> 00:57:34,031
acts partly supposedly to protect
consumers from misbehaving banks but also

1823
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,850
serves very well to prevent competition
from small banks because it's very

1824
00:57:37,851 --> 00:57:38,960
expensive to do to,

1825
00:57:38,961 --> 00:57:39,201
you know,

1826
00:57:39,201 --> 00:57:40,340
pass all the tests.

1827
00:57:40,341 --> 00:57:40,720
Right,

1828
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,060
right.

1829
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:43,160
Say keeps the RAF the rabble out,

1830
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:43,761
but uh,

1831
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:44,211
you know,

1832
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:48,070
then a lot of the criminals end up
being inside this whole system here.

1833
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,070
Here's the thing that,

1834
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:53,330
that whole regulatory system comes down
hard on people who had decided to want

1835
00:57:53,331 --> 00:57:54,530
to create their own currency.

1836
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,280
And the Nice thing about bitcoin
is that there is no one there.

1837
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:01,880
I mean,

1838
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,280
basically in agreement when
you say comes down hard,

1839
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:05,630
like in what manner?

1840
00:58:05,631 --> 00:58:06,111
Like how,

1841
00:58:06,111 --> 00:58:07,040
how would they come down hard?

1842
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:09,230
Like let's say you just asset forfeiture,

1843
00:58:09,231 --> 00:58:09,741
seizures,

1844
00:58:09,741 --> 00:58:10,491
lawsuits,

1845
00:58:10,491 --> 00:58:12,110
a money laundering charges,

1846
00:58:12,111 --> 00:58:13,160
all kinds of things like that.

1847
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:17,060
And this is because you're not
doing things by regulation,

1848
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:18,020
is that what you're saying?

1849
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:18,201
Well,

1850
00:58:18,201 --> 00:58:20,030
it has happened that way in the past.

1851
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,200
So you no matter what,

1852
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:24,470
what if you decide to create your own
currency and you have an actual business

1853
00:58:24,471 --> 00:58:27,500
and you were a centralized business
that essentially be centralized.

1854
00:58:27,501 --> 00:58:31,850
Business is responsible for following all
of the government standards on banking

1855
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,470
100% across the board.

1856
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,400
And if you don't,

1857
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,080
that's where money laundering charges,

1858
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,840
larceny and a lot of different

1859
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:41,070
charges get brought up is that,

1860
00:58:41,071 --> 00:58:44,040
that's what goes on now that's avoided
somehow or another through bitcoin

1861
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,230
because of the voided.

1862
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,210
It's simply the bitcoin is a
completely decentralized system.

1863
00:58:48,211 --> 00:58:49,530
It works based on math.

1864
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:50,640
So there is no,

1865
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,110
there's no one running bitcoin.

1866
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:55,800
It was an invention just like someone
invented electricity than we all learned

1867
00:58:55,801 --> 00:58:58,140
how it worked and we
all ended up using it.

1868
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,420
But does it matter who you know,

1869
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,580
invented the electricity
that makes us light work?

1870
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:03,463
No.

1871
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,740
Bitcoin is like that.

1872
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:05,491
It's a standard.

1873
00:59:05,491 --> 00:59:10,020
It's an idea and it runs by people
participating in the network.

1874
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,720
So there's nothing,

1875
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:13,140
there is no central location,

1876
00:59:13,141 --> 00:59:14,520
there's no company behind it,

1877
00:59:14,521 --> 00:59:15,331
there's no leader,

1878
00:59:15,331 --> 00:59:16,170
there's nothing.

1879
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,300
It's a decentralized,

1880
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,990
it's just like no one runs the Internet.

1881
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:19,951
So if you say,

1882
00:59:19,951 --> 00:59:21,590
I don't want the Internet to do this,

1883
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:21,980
who are

1884
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,813
you gonna sue?

1885
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,880
It's a global network.

1886
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:25,970
Yeah.

1887
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:30,180
I mean what Al Gore Al
Gore for inventing it.

1888
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:30,531
Why it's,

1889
00:59:30,531 --> 00:59:33,560
well that's one of the reasons to Toshi
Nakamoto disappeared because he was

1890
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:34,970
smart enough to know that uh,

1891
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:35,480
you know,

1892
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,050
smearing him would affect bitcoin but
couldn't he could since he programmed

1893
00:59:39,051 --> 00:59:39,860
everything,

1894
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:42,590
have access to everybody's
money if he wanted to know.

1895
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,700
So let me explain that.

1896
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:48,710
The software itself is so
called open source software.

1897
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:53,240
That means that it's a recipe
of code that implements the,

1898
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:55,970
the big coin agreement according
to the network standards.

1899
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,490
And you can write your own,

1900
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,310
I mean if you don't want to run that
software you can write a version of it.

1901
01:00:01,311 --> 01:00:01,731
In fact,

1902
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:03,830
there are five or six different,

1903
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:04,610
um,

1904
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:04,881
you know,

1905
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:07,670
fully compliant versions that
can participate in the network.

1906
01:00:08,090 --> 01:00:11,900
And even if you take the basic one
that started with him writing it,

1907
01:00:11,901 --> 01:00:15,290
but since has involved in a community
project with lots of people writing code,

1908
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:16,641
you know,

1909
01:00:16,641 --> 01:00:17,780
just like the intranet,

1910
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,201
it,

1911
01:00:18,201 --> 01:00:20,030
you just agree to play by the rules.

1912
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:22,670
And then you can read the code and
you can see exactly what happens.

1913
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:24,020
There is no controls in there.

1914
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:26,240
There's no magic secret keys.

1915
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:27,500
You can see how it works.

1916
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:27,921
What do you,

1917
01:00:27,921 --> 01:00:28,521
what are you saying?

1918
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:29,354
Hold on a second.

1919
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,050
There's five or six
different types of bitcoin.

1920
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:33,800
There's,

1921
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,700
there's five or six
different programs that can,

1922
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,660
that can do the full bitcoin,

1923
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:38,350
uh,

1924
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:39,800
language on the bitcoin network.

1925
01:00:39,801 --> 01:00:41,060
Five or six different versions,

1926
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:43,010
but they all speak bitcoin
so it doesn't matter.

1927
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:45,830
But what are they doing
differently than the other ones?

1928
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:47,600
Just um,

1929
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:48,180
different ways,

1930
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,970
different programming languages,

1931
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,380
different ways of implementing them.

1932
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:52,720
Some are more efficient in some ways.

1933
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:53,930
Some are more efficient than the others,

1934
01:00:53,931 --> 01:00:55,760
but they don't do anything
different in terms of bitcoin.

1935
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,590
So there's just like,

1936
01:00:57,591 --> 01:01:01,880
there are lots of different internet
routers and they all speak TCP Ip on the

1937
01:01:01,881 --> 01:01:02,691
internets and you know,

1938
01:01:02,691 --> 01:01:06,440
Cisco makes some [inaudible] juniper
networks make some others in HP makes them

1939
01:01:06,441 --> 01:01:06,711
others,

1940
01:01:06,711 --> 01:01:07,820
but they all speak the same.

1941
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:08,780
I see.

1942
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:10,580
So there's no concern whatsoever.

1943
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:15,590
There's any security openings because of
the fact that these guys are producing

1944
01:01:16,221 --> 01:01:16,911
their own software.

1945
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:17,830
That communicates in big,

1946
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:18,530
right?

1947
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:21,860
Because the trust is based on computation,

1948
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:22,694
not taxes.

1949
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:27,230
So this is a key thing to realize all of
our payment systems and banking systems

1950
01:01:27,231 --> 01:01:31,520
up to now keep trust in the
system by keeping people out,

1951
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:34,070
by controlling very carefully
who connects to the network.

1952
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:35,750
And that means the network
is always very small.

1953
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:36,920
In bitcoin,

1954
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,190
all of the trust is done
by this joint computation,

1955
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:41,090
right?

1956
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:45,530
And so who talks the network doesn't
matter because the network is trusted and

1957
01:01:45,531 --> 01:01:50,240
safe regardless of what you try to send
to it or receive from it or how you

1958
01:01:50,241 --> 01:01:51,830
interpret it because there's no center.

1959
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:57,250
So this has radical implications because
that means you can let anyone talk to

1960
01:01:58,311 --> 01:02:03,311
the network or rather you can let everyone
talk to the network and everyone can

1961
01:02:03,411 --> 01:02:07,100
be a bank on that network
and everyone can send wires,

1962
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:11,990
transfers on that network power
of a bank on your smartphone.

1963
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:15,590
And as long as it speaks to the bitcoin
language and understands it with the

1964
01:02:15,591 --> 01:02:16,520
rest of the network,

1965
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:17,960
you don't need to trust,

1966
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:19,650
you know it,

1967
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:20,160
that that

1968
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,270
application is running.

1969
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:23,940
The trust happens in the
transactions in the network,

1970
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:25,270
you can't cheat no matter what you do.

1971
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:25,980
Right?

1972
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,200
So what is the motivation
to write a new software?

1973
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:29,034
What does the mode

1974
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:29,400
fish,

1975
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,630
it's like there are different
pieces that all run windows.

1976
01:02:31,631 --> 01:02:32,350
There's you know,

1977
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:34,090
different clients that all run picc line.

1978
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:35,350
I see.

1979
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:39,400
So they just have to sit at decided to
run their own program that that speaks

1980
01:02:39,401 --> 01:02:42,130
bitcoin but it participates
in the exact same fashion.

1981
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:42,411
Right?

1982
01:02:42,411 --> 01:02:46,070
You have a chrome browser or you have
a Firefox browser or why there too,

1983
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:47,210
right?

1984
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:47,990
Same thing.

1985
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:48,500
Okay.

1986
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,380
In fact it's very similar or
like a bit torrent client.

1987
01:02:51,381 --> 01:02:52,490
There are three different versions,

1988
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,880
but they all speak bitterns and
your brows is all speak http,

1989
01:02:55,881 --> 01:02:57,590
the hypertext transfer protocol.

1990
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,500
So no matter what website you go to,

1991
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,850
and there are lots of websites,

1992
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:06,590
programs that made by different companies
that speak the server side of the web.

1993
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:07,341
You know,

1994
01:03:07,341 --> 01:03:08,570
there's lots of different versions.

1995
01:03:08,571 --> 01:03:11,480
But what matters is the
common language they speak.

1996
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:12,530
And bitcoin is like that.

1997
01:03:12,531 --> 01:03:13,370
It's a common language,

1998
01:03:13,371 --> 01:03:14,930
a protocol or standard.

1999
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:18,500
And that means that no matter
what you attached to the network,

2000
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,580
whether it's a a wallet
that's written for Androids,

2001
01:03:22,581 --> 01:03:27,410
a wallet that's written for Iphone or
a wallet that's fancier or a wallet

2002
01:03:27,411 --> 01:03:27,830
that's,

2003
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:29,150
that's more geeky.

2004
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:33,670
All of these will speak Bitcoin to the
network and we'll work with a system and

2005
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:34,940
the trust is in the network.

2006
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:35,611
Now,

2007
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,070
when we were talking earlier about the,

2008
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,110
if you had a centralized location,

2009
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,140
centralized server that can be shut down
by the banks and they could charge you

2010
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:43,974
with all these crimes,

2011
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:49,370
is there any concern legally speaking
that if you were a person who has all your

2012
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:55,560
money in bitcoin that maybe one day the
government could come along and say,

2013
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:58,470
bitcoin is not a valid currency,

2014
01:03:58,471 --> 01:04:02,790
it's illegal to use using it as
a crime and we find it on you,

2015
01:04:02,791 --> 01:04:05,400
we're going to take it from you
and we're going to arrest you?

2016
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:05,911
Well,

2017
01:04:05,911 --> 01:04:06,171
actually,

2018
01:04:06,171 --> 01:04:06,290
yeah.

2019
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:11,290
Government has already said that bitcoin
is legal and that users using bitcoin

2020
01:04:12,290 --> 01:04:15,320
are are doing perfectly legal business.

2021
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,120
Can you pay taxes in Bitcoin?

2022
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:18,260
I'm not directly,

2023
01:04:18,261 --> 01:04:18,471
no.

2024
01:04:18,471 --> 01:04:19,730
You'd have to convert it to dollars,

2025
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:22,400
but as a company that will take your
bitcoin and pay the taxes for you.

2026
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,353
Bingo.

2027
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:25,303
So,

2028
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:26,240
um,

2029
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:26,630
uh,

2030
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:27,500
back in April,

2031
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:28,580
the fin cen,

2032
01:04:28,581 --> 01:04:31,310
which is the financial
crimes enforcement network,

2033
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:32,030
uh,

2034
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:35,800
created a memorandum where it
explains how we treat bitcoin.

2035
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:36,290
And it said,

2036
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:37,123
you know,

2037
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,430
if you're just an individual using
bitcoin to buy and sell things,

2038
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:41,623
great.

2039
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:42,980
It's just like anything else you,

2040
01:04:42,981 --> 01:04:43,814
you're going to pay,

2041
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:44,451
uh,

2042
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:46,790
you know you're going
to pay your transaction.

2043
01:04:46,791 --> 01:04:47,600
And that's it.

2044
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,390
If you're someone who
makes a living in Bitcoin,

2045
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:51,860
you pay income tax.

2046
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,420
And if you're someone
who's mining on Bitcoin,

2047
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,090
you pay income tax on those bitcoins.

2048
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:57,290
So if you're an investor,

2049
01:04:58,310 --> 01:04:59,570
you pay capital gains.

2050
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,060
It's treated just like any other currency.

2051
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,320
So if you make your living off Bitcoin,

2052
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:05,310
that's how you get paid.

2053
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:06,840
You convert that to dollars,

2054
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:08,250
then you pay a percentage in dollars.

2055
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,001
Is that what you should do?

2056
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:13,290
You convert like how much you made in
Bitcoin coin in the year and what that

2057
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:15,900
would be in dollar bills and
then pay the percentage on that.

2058
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:16,681
Right.

2059
01:05:16,681 --> 01:05:18,010
But I mean that's not different

2060
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,880
from what I did before.

2061
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,110
When I got paid in euros.

2062
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:22,750
I mean occasionally I get a
paycheck from a customer in Europe.

2063
01:05:22,751 --> 01:05:23,680
They're going to pay me in euro's,

2064
01:05:23,681 --> 01:05:23,920
right?

2065
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,341
What do you do?

2066
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:25,420
You convert it to dollars.

2067
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,550
You mark the rates at which they paid you,

2068
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:28,001
you know,

2069
01:05:28,001 --> 01:05:28,930
you invoiced them,

2070
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,520
they paid you in euros,

2071
01:05:30,521 --> 01:05:31,990
you mark what rate it was,

2072
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:34,270
and then you put it on
the tax return as income.

2073
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:38,090
People are notoriously bad about
reporting income when you know,

2074
01:05:38,091 --> 01:05:39,080
when it's independent,

2075
01:05:39,081 --> 01:05:41,480
when they're not being
taxed by their employer,

2076
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:43,340
when it's not coming directly
out of their paycheck.

2077
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:46,580
Comedians are terrible about that.

2078
01:05:46,581 --> 01:05:49,940
I know so many comedians that have had
like serious IRS problems because of

2079
01:05:49,941 --> 01:05:50,630
that.

2080
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:55,280
I would think that that sort of issue
would arise with bitcoin where people are

2081
01:05:55,281 --> 01:05:58,310
responsible for paying taxes
on these and they don't.

2082
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,031
I mean,

2083
01:05:59,031 --> 01:05:59,360
how much,

2084
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:02,660
how much of an issue is that and how
much of a criminality issue could that

2085
01:06:02,661 --> 01:06:03,494
become?

2086
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:04,561
Well,

2087
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:08,400
I I think has al Capone found out there
was one thing you can too in the u s and

2088
01:06:08,401 --> 01:06:09,660
that's not pay your taxes.

2089
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:10,501
They might get,

2090
01:06:10,501 --> 01:06:11,730
they might not get you for anything else.

2091
01:06:11,731 --> 01:06:12,231
You pull it up,

2092
01:06:12,231 --> 01:06:12,400
right.

2093
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,270
I keep pulling up these orders,

2094
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:16,050
I pay my taxes and uh,

2095
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:19,230
and if you earn money in Bitcoin,

2096
01:06:19,231 --> 01:06:21,120
you pay your taxes on
Bitcoin is simple as death.

2097
01:06:21,121 --> 01:06:23,550
And if you think you can get
away with not doing that,

2098
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:27,660
then you'll find out like many people
before you that the IRS will come,

2099
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:31,470
will audit you and you will
end up paying a lot more.

2100
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:31,801
Yeah.

2101
01:06:31,801 --> 01:06:35,940
Even if you want to pay them
back and agree to pay them back,

2102
01:06:35,941 --> 01:06:37,020
they still put you in jail.

2103
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:38,100
So yeah,

2104
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,770
I don't think you need to sit in a cage
for a little while and think about what

2105
01:06:40,771 --> 01:06:41,510
you did.

2106
01:06:41,510 --> 01:06:41,751
I mean,

2107
01:06:41,751 --> 01:06:41,841
the,

2108
01:06:41,841 --> 01:06:42,050
the,

2109
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:44,600
that would simply be a
monumentally stupid sink to do,

2110
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:45,350
uh,

2111
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:47,090
to think that somehow that would protect.

2112
01:06:47,091 --> 01:06:47,391
No,

2113
01:06:47,391 --> 01:06:50,330
I mean they're going to track down
your accounts just as effectively with

2114
01:06:50,331 --> 01:06:51,830
bitcoin as they deal with other things.

2115
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:52,790
They're not stupid.

2116
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:53,960
What are these articles
you keep pulling up?

2117
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:54,690
Brian,

2118
01:06:54,690 --> 01:06:58,580
just keep on finding new things
about different news reports.

2119
01:06:58,581 --> 01:07:02,540
Like this was a four hours ago where
two guys have been arrested a major,

2120
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,030
a prominent players in
the bitcoin universe.

2121
01:07:05,031 --> 01:07:08,930
Charles Sherman was arrested by federal
prosecutors on Sunday and accused of

2122
01:07:08,931 --> 01:07:11,150
helping grease the wheels
for drug transactions,

2123
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:11,950
you know,

2124
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:12,050
uh,

2125
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:14,630
using bitcoins and uh,

2126
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:19,760
Mr Shrem was also the founder and chief
executive of popular website called bit

2127
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:20,720
instant.

2128
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,300
We're bitcoins could be
bought using dollars.

2129
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:27,550
And so what it seems like there's a
lot of people getting arrested though.

2130
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:30,800
There was another guy that I flashed
up earlier that was arrested.

2131
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:35,980
It seems like there's a lot of shady
stuff going on in this universe right now.

2132
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,131
Honestly,

2133
01:07:37,131 --> 01:07:39,510
that's the only reason I never
went and got into bitcoins.

2134
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:44,710
You don't feel nervous about all these
like recent news things at all or cause

2135
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,080
you seem very pro like I,

2136
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:48,380
I'm not worried about it at all.

2137
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:53,920
Stated playstation that people are not
going to stop going online and shopping

2138
01:07:53,921 --> 01:07:55,930
on amazon.com of Amazon gets hacked.

2139
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:59,320
What you're dealing with is a
few people that are scumbags,

2140
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:04,500
that are operating in this
a truly revolutionary system
that is very beneficial.

2141
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:04,751
Yeah.

2142
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:06,390
But this is like hitting send counselors.

2143
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:07,060
There's bank,

2144
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:08,350
this is like robbing a bank,

2145
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:08,950
you know.

2146
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:09,161
Well,

2147
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:09,311
no,

2148
01:08:09,311 --> 01:08:10,144
in this whole,

2149
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,560
so here's my perspective.

2150
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:12,483
Um,

2151
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,840
bitcoin is a,

2152
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:16,280
technology is

2153
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:21,310
powerful and is being used by school
teachers to manage a PTA groups.

2154
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:28,060
It's been used by churches to manage
tithing and their collection plates.

2155
01:08:28,251 --> 01:08:33,080
And there are clubs and it's also being
used by criminals occasionally to do

2156
01:08:33,081 --> 01:08:35,450
crimes just like any other currency.

2157
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:36,560
In fact,

2158
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,120
the,

2159
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:37,590
the,

2160
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:41,360
the point is that compared to
another currency like the dollar,

2161
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:41,960
uh,

2162
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:42,321
you know,

2163
01:08:42,321 --> 01:08:42,650
the,

2164
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:44,960
the money laundering that
happens with a dollar,

2165
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:45,231
I mean,

2166
01:08:45,231 --> 01:08:49,730
HSBC was found and convicted
under consent agreements,

2167
01:08:49,731 --> 01:08:54,731
I think for $17 billion of money
laundering with the worst Mexican cartels.

2168
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:59,570
And they got a minor fine
and no one went to jail.

2169
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:03,050
And what Cocoavia was money laundering,

2170
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:05,270
hundreds of billions of dollars with,

2171
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:05,541
uh,

2172
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:05,961
with,

2173
01:09:05,961 --> 01:09:06,410
uh,

2174
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:08,390
various drug cartels in Asia.

2175
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,160
And again,

2176
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:11,760
nothing happened.

2177
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:16,430
So let's not pretend that suddenly
bitcoin is like this criminal,

2178
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:17,330
uh,

2179
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:18,021
situation.

2180
01:09:18,021 --> 01:09:18,450
It's not,

2181
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:21,830
it just represents just like the Internet
represents society and you get the

2182
01:09:21,831 --> 01:09:22,790
whole spectrum.

2183
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:27,860
Bitcoin as a currency can be used for
economic activity and that means the whole

2184
01:09:27,861 --> 01:09:28,694
spectrum.

2185
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:32,660
And you'll have a small subset who are
people who take advantage and then you

2186
01:09:32,661 --> 01:09:34,070
have the vast majority.

2187
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:36,200
Increasingly now it's
getting more mainstream.

2188
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:41,970
I see the possibility of being able to
do exciting new things with money that

2189
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:44,930
weren't possible before and,

2190
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:46,910
and to enable new forms of commerce.

2191
01:09:46,911 --> 01:09:47,510
You know,

2192
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:51,140
there are hundreds of startups that
are innovating with new forms of,

2193
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:52,431
for example,

2194
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:57,431
how to do settlement and escrow on a real
estate transaction and not spend 2% on

2195
01:09:58,191 --> 01:10:01,160
that but do it with
bitcoin much more safely,

2196
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:02,330
much more effectively.

2197
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:06,730
Companies that are working on doing
charitable foundations based on Bitcoin

2198
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:07,573
endowments,

2199
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:11,060
charities that are working
to do remittances to foreign
countries to help the

2200
01:10:11,061 --> 01:10:11,894
poor people.

2201
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:12,411
You know,

2202
01:10:12,411 --> 01:10:14,270
all kinds of activities are happening.

2203
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:17,570
But what is the primary
focus of the media?

2204
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:21,750
It is to generate page views and you know,

2205
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,260
portraying the sensationalist
stuff always wins out.

2206
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,480
So there's a lot more to bitcoin.

2207
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:28,940
Don't get fooled by the fact that,

2208
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:29,990
you know,

2209
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:30,530
some,

2210
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:33,380
some things are emphasized
as if that's the be all.

2211
01:10:33,381 --> 01:10:36,260
And Adult Ed Coyle was certainly
some things are emphasized,

2212
01:10:36,261 --> 01:10:37,520
but those are legitimate stories.

2213
01:10:37,521 --> 01:10:37,671
I mean,

2214
01:10:37,671 --> 01:10:40,460
that was a legitimate story that
the stores are arrested for.

2215
01:10:40,461 --> 01:10:45,440
You can't judge the media on
reporting legitimate crimes.

2216
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:45,681
No,

2217
01:10:45,681 --> 01:10:46,700
I don't think that's the,

2218
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:47,534
that's the issue.

2219
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:48,470
The problem is,

2220
01:10:48,471 --> 01:10:48,711
you know,

2221
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:50,870
you get a lot more of that than,

2222
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:53,600
than is actually occurring and
you get a lot less of the stuff.

2223
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:55,820
That's really interesting
and important in my view.

2224
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:56,683
The positive stories.

2225
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:57,741
Positive stories.

2226
01:10:57,741 --> 01:10:58,281
Exactly.

2227
01:10:58,281 --> 01:10:58,850
And you know,

2228
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:00,020
the way I look at Bitcoin,

2229
01:11:00,021 --> 01:11:02,510
I think about the possibility
you can create jobs.

2230
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,940
I look at it as a
technological innovation.

2231
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:07,820
I look at it as an engine for
growth in a stagnant economy,

2232
01:11:08,270 --> 01:11:08,930
you know,

2233
01:11:08,930 --> 01:11:09,231
so,

2234
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:10,850
so those are the things
that stick in my mind.

2235
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:11,271
Jobs,

2236
01:11:11,271 --> 01:11:12,380
innovation and growth.

2237
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:13,290
Not,

2238
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:13,951
you know,

2239
01:11:13,951 --> 01:11:14,070
the

2240
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,641
fact that,

2241
01:11:14,641 --> 01:11:14,980
uh,

2242
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:18,180
some bad dude used
bitcoin to do bad things.

2243
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:18,651
Your,

2244
01:11:18,651 --> 01:11:22,220
your example of the bank that was
laundering money with the drug cartels is

2245
01:11:22,221 --> 01:11:25,520
absolutely perfect because that
barely got a peep out of people.

2246
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:27,350
And that was a very recent decision.

2247
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:28,280
And you know,

2248
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:28,671
I mean,

2249
01:11:28,671 --> 01:11:31,280
I saw some outrage from
a few Twitter users.

2250
01:11:31,281 --> 01:11:32,120
I literally,

2251
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:34,670
I've read the story and
my mouth was hanging open.

2252
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:35,361
I was like,

2253
01:11:35,361 --> 01:11:38,510
how could they get away with
that and just get a fine,

2254
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:43,780
like they dealt with murderers and they
laundered their drug money and they did

2255
01:11:44,241 --> 01:11:46,910
it for a long time and
they made a lot of money.

2256
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:47,210
Yeah.

2257
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:48,140
And they just got a slap

2258
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:52,520
wasn't even up to the par
of the money they made.

2259
01:11:52,521 --> 01:11:53,600
That's the shocking thing.

2260
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:55,460
It's not even covering
the profits they lost,

2261
01:11:55,461 --> 01:11:57,200
which basically rewards and says,

2262
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:57,441
yeah,

2263
01:11:57,441 --> 01:11:57,861
go ahead,

2264
01:11:57,861 --> 01:11:58,320
do it again.

2265
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,900
You made a great return
on that investment.

2266
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:05,040
There's a real issue with this whole
Mexican drug war is that there's so much

2267
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:10,041
money to be made and being a part of
it and it leaves so many holes open for

2268
01:12:10,921 --> 01:12:11,760
corruption.

2269
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:14,160
And even legal corruption,

2270
01:12:14,161 --> 01:12:15,780
like this type of stuff where it's,

2271
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,520
it's they do something,

2272
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:20,640
they get fined by
whatever regulatory body,

2273
01:12:20,641 --> 01:12:21,690
but yet they're still in business.

2274
01:12:21,691 --> 01:12:22,260
They're still,

2275
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:24,660
they're enacting in the
profit on that decision,

2276
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:26,460
encouraging,

2277
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:31,470
literally encouraging people to continue
to do business with illegal groups like

2278
01:12:31,471 --> 01:12:32,010
that.

2279
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:33,720
If you can make that kind of profit,

2280
01:12:33,721 --> 01:12:34,830
which you know,

2281
01:12:34,831 --> 01:12:36,940
there's a real issue in this country,

2282
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:41,400
a massive amount of distrust of law
enforcement and there's a big part of that

2283
01:12:41,401 --> 01:12:42,234
becomes,

2284
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:42,890
uh,

2285
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:44,670
it comes out of the war on drugs.

2286
01:12:44,671 --> 01:12:48,660
It comes out of the war
on nicknamed the drug.

2287
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:48,811
You know,

2288
01:12:48,811 --> 01:12:52,560
whether it's cocaine or whether all these
different people that are struggling

2289
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:57,060
to keep things illegal are pumping up
all these businesses that sell these

2290
01:12:57,061 --> 01:12:59,850
illegal drugs because there's
this massive demand for it.

2291
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,830
So when you see a war on drugs,

2292
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:03,900
w w what's you're seeing is,

2293
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,800
is an engine to generate money for crime.

2294
01:13:07,980 --> 01:13:08,850
That's all it is.

2295
01:13:09,210 --> 01:13:11,580
People are not going to stop
altering their consciousness,

2296
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:15,780
but you are ensuring that the people that
are profiting off of that are going to

2297
01:13:15,781 --> 01:13:16,614
be criminals.

2298
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:19,110
And then it leaves the door
open for people who are in,

2299
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,100
in actual law enforcement to see these
loopholes and see these these ways.

2300
01:13:23,101 --> 01:13:25,680
They could skim a little money to
take a little bit home for themselves.

2301
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:26,701
And next thing you know,

2302
01:13:26,701 --> 01:13:28,570
you got corruption and next thing you go,

2303
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:29,520
you got bankers going,

2304
01:13:29,521 --> 01:13:29,970
listen,

2305
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:33,600
I can guarantee you the worst going to
happen is we're going to get a fine if I

2306
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,820
was going to be little and we're
going to make a fuck load of money.

2307
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,910
And these guys Pedro's coming
over and he's got a donkey cart.

2308
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:39,500
Well this,

2309
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,020
this is the best part of the story in,

2310
01:13:42,021 --> 01:13:43,370
in one of these bank,

2311
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:43,730
uh,

2312
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:48,620
situations where they had these branches
and Mexico and they were putting

2313
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,470
literally millions of
dollars in suitcases,

2314
01:13:51,471 --> 01:13:53,000
a stake in them through the teller window.

2315
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:58,180
They actually ended up designing and
mass manufacturing suitcases that fits

2316
01:13:58,221 --> 01:14:02,240
through the slot because they
were doing it every single day.

2317
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:07,540
So they had a teller window slot fitting
briefcase so they could stuff that cash

2318
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,320
through

2319
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,820
and no one went to jail.

2320
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:12,460
Wow,

2321
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:13,630
that's amazing.

2322
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:14,501
So,

2323
01:14:14,501 --> 01:14:14,801
you know,

2324
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:15,634
I mean,

2325
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,790
we can talk about money
all day and some money.

2326
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:21,850
We'll create situations for
people to take advantage.

2327
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:22,750
Absolutely.

2328
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:24,250
Well it does the way with guns,

2329
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:25,120
it's good.

2330
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,050
Does that we were everything.

2331
01:14:26,051 --> 01:14:26,920
I mean that's that whole,

2332
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:27,754
um,

2333
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,460
that fast and furious investigation that
you know about that there was a worthy

2334
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:37,540
whatever government agency was selling
arms to Mexican drug dealers so that they

2335
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:39,700
can quote unquote track the guns.

2336
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:40,511
You know?

2337
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:44,260
And it's ridiculous because those guns
actually got used for killing American

2338
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:46,000
service members,

2339
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:46,841
American,

2340
01:14:46,841 --> 01:14:49,690
the people that were
involved in border patrol,

2341
01:14:49,691 --> 01:14:51,880
people that were involved
in law enforcement,

2342
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:52,931
a lot of these,

2343
01:14:52,931 --> 01:14:53,231
uh,

2344
01:14:53,231 --> 01:14:57,850
these guns wound up being used to
actually kill Americans more than one.

2345
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:58,953
And

2346
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:01,520
the idea behind it is so preposterous.

2347
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:06,410
The idea that you're going to sell weapons
to criminals so that you could track

2348
01:15:06,411 --> 01:15:07,400
where these weapons go.

2349
01:15:07,401 --> 01:15:07,940
Like,

2350
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:08,870
no,

2351
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,760
that's a fucking terrible idea.

2352
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:14,000
These are the people that
are in charge of deciding,

2353
01:15:14,001 --> 01:15:14,541
you know,

2354
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:18,530
what kind of laws get enforced and what
w what atmosphere of law enforcement

2355
01:15:18,531 --> 01:15:18,741
this,

2356
01:15:18,741 --> 01:15:19,610
this country has.

2357
01:15:19,910 --> 01:15:20,930
And when you see things like that,

2358
01:15:20,931 --> 01:15:25,450
it's so frustrating and confusing
because it seems almost like a Palladian

2359
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:26,240
crime.

2360
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:30,800
Like someone's solds sold some guns to
these Mexican drug lords and they did it

2361
01:15:30,801 --> 01:15:33,710
under the guise of this crazy operation.

2362
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,680
We're just going to sell them guns
and keep an eye on them that way.

2363
01:15:36,681 --> 01:15:38,630
We'll track them and then we're
going to get them that way.

2364
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:41,750
You're giving them guns
like that's what they want.

2365
01:15:41,751 --> 01:15:43,880
That's what they need to perform crimes.

2366
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:45,140
You're giving them tools.

2367
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:47,420
It's like a guy who's a fucking carpenter.

2368
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:48,890
You're giving them a saw and a hammer.

2369
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:51,590
You're giving it to him and you're
literally telling them to go use them.

2370
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:51,951
I mean,

2371
01:15:51,951 --> 01:15:54,050
that's essentially what you're
doing and you're profiting off that.

2372
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:54,531
How was,

2373
01:15:54,531 --> 01:15:56,330
how were you not in jail for selling guns?

2374
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:56,900
How do you,

2375
01:15:56,900 --> 01:15:57,681
how can you say that?

2376
01:15:57,681 --> 01:15:58,514
That was a,

2377
01:15:58,700 --> 01:15:58,920
uh,

2378
01:15:58,920 --> 01:15:59,691
an idea,

2379
01:15:59,691 --> 01:16:01,040
a plan that you had?

2380
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:01,701
I mean,

2381
01:16:01,701 --> 01:16:02,720
it's unbelievable.

2382
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:03,860
It's unbelievable and it's in,

2383
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:06,050
it's impossible to,

2384
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:08,070
to read those stories and,

2385
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:08,913
and,

2386
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:13,210
and understand how we could ever trust
the people that are in charge of,

2387
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:13,490
of,

2388
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:14,510
of running this country.

2389
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,760
If this is something
you're capable of doing,

2390
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:18,740
how the fuck can anybody trust you?

2391
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:22,940
How could anybody ever take
your leadership seriously
if this is what you do?

2392
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:24,830
This is madness.

2393
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:25,760
Well,

2394
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,660
I mean that's one of the reasons
that I think a lot of people are also

2395
01:16:29,661 --> 01:16:32,660
passionate about Bitcoin
is that they've realized,

2396
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:37,340
especially since 2008 that these same
people cannot be trusted to run the money

2397
01:16:37,341 --> 01:16:38,090
system.

2398
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:39,620
And we've seen now for the last,

2399
01:16:39,621 --> 01:16:40,191
for example,

2400
01:16:40,191 --> 01:16:40,821
five years,

2401
01:16:40,821 --> 01:16:45,821
the Fed has been printing between 85
now tapered down to about $70 billion a

2402
01:16:46,821 --> 01:16:51,821
month and giving it as corporate welfare
and direct subsidies to the banks.

2403
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:55,520
So we didn't get a stimulus,

2404
01:16:55,521 --> 01:17:00,521
but they are continuing for five years
now to remain solvent based on $70

2405
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:01,551
billion a month.

2406
01:17:01,551 --> 01:17:02,900
That's $1 trillion a year,

2407
01:17:02,901 --> 01:17:05,660
almost in dollars generated by the Fed.

2408
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,460
Most people don't even
know this is happening.

2409
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:08,960
These little people running our,

2410
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:10,070
and what it means is

2411
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:14,120
that you go out to use your dollars at
the store and suddenly you can buy a lot

2412
01:17:14,121 --> 01:17:17,780
less bread and a lot less
milk and a lot fewer eggs.

2413
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:21,230
But then the teak items
out of the inflation index.

2414
01:17:21,231 --> 01:17:22,700
So it looks like there is no inflation.

2415
01:17:22,701 --> 01:17:25,460
Where's anybody who's trying to spend
their dollars knows that things are

2416
01:17:25,461 --> 01:17:27,290
getting harder and harder and harder,

2417
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,153
right?

2418
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:29,690
These are the people running our money.

2419
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,410
So bitcoin offers an alternative approach,

2420
01:17:33,411 --> 01:17:35,420
which says let's trust math.

2421
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:40,070
Let's trust that the system
runs based on a rule,

2422
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,600
a simple mathematical role.

2423
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:45,680
And everybody agrees that that is the
rule by which money is created and no one

2424
01:17:45,681 --> 01:17:46,520
can monkey with it.

2425
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:47,601
And,

2426
01:17:47,601 --> 01:17:50,540
and that's the beauty of it
because if you know the rules,

2427
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:52,340
it reduces the uncertainty,

2428
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:53,780
it reduces the risk.

2429
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:58,010
And when you have a simple system where
people can interact with each other and

2430
01:17:58,011 --> 01:18:00,740
exchange money based on
simple mathematic rules,

2431
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:05,690
that system's going to do quite well
because people no longer trust their

2432
01:18:05,691 --> 01:18:07,220
governments even here.

2433
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:09,650
And it's much worse everywhere else.

2434
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:13,690
Do you think that these issues that we
have with the financial system and the

2435
01:18:13,691 --> 01:18:18,550
law enforcement system are sort of
magnified by the solution of Bitcoin,

2436
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:22,780
that this being the internet of money
that really we need an internet of law

2437
01:18:22,781 --> 01:18:23,440
enforcement.

2438
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:24,750
We need an internet of,

2439
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:25,420
of,

2440
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:26,260
of uh,

2441
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,430
regulations.

2442
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:29,470
We need what we all agree on.

2443
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:31,660
We don't need what's been
stuffed down our throat.

2444
01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:36,190
We need what we agree on by consensus
based on the information that's currently

2445
01:18:36,191 --> 01:18:36,671
available,

2446
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:40,060
which is what we would get if we didn't
have some sort of a centralized group

2447
01:18:40,061 --> 01:18:43,480
that's in charge of deciding
what's legal and not legal,

2448
01:18:43,481 --> 01:18:44,510
how things are enforced,

2449
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:45,490
how things are done,

2450
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:45,970
how,

2451
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:46,361
how,

2452
01:18:46,361 --> 01:18:47,670
how laws are,

2453
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:47,980
are,

2454
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:48,813
are created.

2455
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:52,270
Let's talk about smart law and smart
contracts cause this is a perfect

2456
01:18:52,271 --> 01:18:53,104
opportunity.

2457
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:54,573
Bitcoin,

2458
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:55,900
the underlying invention,

2459
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,570
the blockchain asset
ledger as it's called,

2460
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:02,890
basically allows people to agree on
who owns Watson to resolve differences

2461
01:19:02,891 --> 01:19:04,630
through this computation.

2462
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:08,980
But the basic thing that means is that
you can start doing smart contracts.

2463
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:13,270
That means that you can put contracts
into the system and then they either get

2464
01:19:13,271 --> 01:19:17,440
executed because the conditions are met
or they do not based on mathematics.

2465
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:18,521
So you could say,

2466
01:19:18,521 --> 01:19:19,420
for example,

2467
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:20,650
I'm going to have,

2468
01:19:20,651 --> 01:19:23,170
instead of having a deed to my car,

2469
01:19:23,171 --> 01:19:24,670
the trench does with the TM fee,

2470
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:29,290
I'm going to have a digital deed that's
on the bitcoin network and when someone

2471
01:19:29,291 --> 01:19:31,390
pays me the money to buy that car,

2472
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:35,590
that transaction is married to
the deed transferring to them.

2473
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:38,440
And the verification happens
by the bitcoin network,

2474
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:41,470
which I trust based on
distributed consensus.

2475
01:19:41,470 --> 01:19:42,460
No one at the center,

2476
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:43,660
no one monkeying with the rules.

2477
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:48,930
So now you can start doing contracts
and using the same basic mathematics to

2478
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:51,940
fully resolve contracts.

2479
01:19:51,941 --> 01:19:52,361
You could have,

2480
01:19:52,361 --> 01:19:52,991
for example,

2481
01:19:52,991 --> 01:19:56,890
a parent setting up a number
of transactions in the
blockchain and the bitcoin

2482
01:19:56,891 --> 01:20:01,891
network is that send money to their kids
in two decades when they're going to be

2483
01:20:03,911 --> 01:20:06,280
18 or 20 or 21 right?

2484
01:20:06,810 --> 01:20:11,810
So like a trust fund or a will and you
could write that off as a contract and

2485
01:20:12,961 --> 01:20:16,770
then executed on the bitcoin
network and the no one can stop it.

2486
01:20:16,830 --> 01:20:18,090
No one can reverse it.

2487
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:20,400
No one can invalidate it.

2488
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:23,070
That's pretty powerful stuff.

2489
01:20:23,310 --> 01:20:25,950
It allows people to have
contracts between them,

2490
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,860
between each other that are adjudicated,

2491
01:20:28,861 --> 01:20:29,694
if you like,

2492
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:32,640
by the bitcoin network based
on the mathematical rules.

2493
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,740
And how would these things be enforced
if they had to be in a court of law,

2494
01:20:37,741 --> 01:20:39,120
would that ever be an option?

2495
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:41,580
Would they ever be
considered legally binding?

2496
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:42,800
Well simple.

2497
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:46,430
The simple matter is that the transaction
goes through or the transaction does

2498
01:20:46,431 --> 01:20:50,150
not go through the transaction as either
valid because you presented the right

2499
01:20:50,151 --> 01:20:51,770
keys or it is not valid.

2500
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,870
And once the transaction has gone through,

2501
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,033
it's gone through.

2502
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:58,160
I mean that's the simple
way the network works.

2503
01:20:58,550 --> 01:20:59,690
So you know,

2504
01:20:59,691 --> 01:21:03,470
adjudication is something that you
then have to deal with after the fact.

2505
01:21:03,471 --> 01:21:04,100
Like if a,

2506
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:04,933
if a,

2507
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:08,450
if a parent put a transaction in
the bitcoin network that gave,

2508
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:08,980
uh,

2509
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:09,261
you know,

2510
01:21:09,261 --> 01:21:13,490
money to their kid as part of a
will is that can't be contested.

2511
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,950
When that kid presents the key,

2512
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:17,420
that transaction goes through.

2513
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:18,320
Don,

2514
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:20,720
the network has agreed that
that money has transferred,

2515
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:22,213
it's transferred.

2516
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:25,970
So it doesn't need a judge's
written consent or it doesn't need

2517
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:26,261
no,

2518
01:21:26,261 --> 01:21:28,780
it's mathematical rules instead without,

2519
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:29,551
you know the,

2520
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:29,761
the,

2521
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:30,220
the,

2522
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:34,900
the benefit of this is that instead of
relying on the ambiguity of language,

2523
01:21:34,901 --> 01:21:38,080
which is the basis of
most law for many things,

2524
01:21:38,081 --> 01:21:38,914
you will have to,

2525
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:44,050
but for some simple things like doing
an escrow for a house or you know,

2526
01:21:44,051 --> 01:21:48,370
buying a car or transferring
property or doing a trust or a will,

2527
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:53,640
you could simply a convert those legal
contracts into bitcoin transactions that

2528
01:21:55,570 --> 01:22:00,130
then get executed under a certain set of
rules and suddenly you've got a form of

2529
01:22:00,131 --> 01:22:00,880
smart law,

2530
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:05,350
self executing law that happens based on
the bitcoin network's ability to agree

2531
01:22:05,351 --> 01:22:06,184
on what's true.

2532
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:12,130
It's fascinating to think that this could
be one step in an ultimate revamping

2533
01:22:13,311 --> 01:22:18,020
of our society and the revamping of our
society based on the Internet and that

2534
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,720
if bitcoin or and things like Bitcoin,

2535
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,420
these peer used groups,

2536
01:22:23,421 --> 01:22:24,560
these groups of,

2537
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:25,041
you know,

2538
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:29,270
many people agreeing on a standard
and a subscribing to a system,

2539
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:31,280
if that can happen with this,

2540
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:34,100
they can start happening with a lot
of things could start happening with

2541
01:22:34,101 --> 01:22:34,731
education.

2542
01:22:34,731 --> 01:22:36,080
It can start happening with,

2543
01:22:36,081 --> 01:22:36,770
you know,

2544
01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:38,870
w w with even with law enforcement,

2545
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:39,531
you know,

2546
01:22:39,531 --> 01:22:41,660
the idea of community law enforcement or,

2547
01:22:41,661 --> 01:22:46,661
or figuring out some way to a fun private
law enforcement or private contractors

2548
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:50,660
based on a situation like this.

2549
01:22:51,130 --> 01:22:51,963
So for,

2550
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:55,000
for the biggest part of human history,

2551
01:22:55,001 --> 01:22:59,680
a lot of the most difficult problems like
communicating at distances or agreeing

2552
01:22:59,681 --> 01:23:02,650
with lots of different
people simply didn't scale.

2553
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:04,840
And because you couldn't
scale solutions to those,

2554
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:07,810
we built hierarchal
institutions to solve them.

2555
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,400
Representative democracy,

2556
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:12,880
we built councils and committees
to solve decision making.

2557
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:15,010
We built banks and central banks,

2558
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:15,551
uh,

2559
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:19,090
in order to solve issuance of
currency and other things like that.

2560
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:24,300
And we built hierarchal
media organizations because
we needed a single voice to

2561
01:23:24,401 --> 01:23:25,450
tell us what to think.

2562
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:30,750
And then gradually we're
seeing the solutions that
are decentralized that solve

2563
01:23:31,191 --> 01:23:35,200
the problem without a hierarchal
organization and that scale.

2564
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:39,340
So the Internet was the first
decentralized communications
that scales to the

2565
01:23:39,341 --> 01:23:40,174
whole planet.

2566
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:44,380
And so suddenly all of the hierarchal
solutions for communication are no longer

2567
01:23:44,381 --> 01:23:45,040
necessary.

2568
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,020
They solve a problem that doesn't exist.

2569
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:51,850
The problem of it being difficult to
transmit information across a continent or

2570
01:23:51,851 --> 01:23:52,684
across the globe.

2571
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,370
Once our problem goes away,

2572
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,590
the institution's built to solve it.

2573
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:58,180
New Systems,

2574
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:01,540
large entertainment and
marketing organizations to,

2575
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:02,050
you know,

2576
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:03,970
create single output products.

2577
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,680
All of those are no longer necessary.

2578
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:07,750
And the choice blossoms.

2579
01:24:08,530 --> 01:24:12,610
Bitcoin is simply the same concept of
decentralization but applied to money.

2580
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:18,030
And one of the interesting things is the
bitcoin at its core works on the fact

2581
01:24:18,101 --> 01:24:21,190
that you can decentralize
voting and do voting at scale.

2582
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:24,670
And the voting that's happening right
now is the voting to agree on who has the

2583
01:24:24,671 --> 01:24:25,504
bitcoin.

2584
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:27,430
But you could do voting
for other things like

2585
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:29,291
you know,

2586
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:29,741
stocks,

2587
01:24:29,741 --> 01:24:30,220
bonds,

2588
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:31,210
global lotteries,

2589
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,670
national elections and things like that.

2590
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:34,220
When you say

2591
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:36,650
voting is to see who has the bitcoins.

2592
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:38,401
So when,

2593
01:24:38,401 --> 01:24:40,770
when essentially the,

2594
01:24:40,771 --> 01:24:41,340
uh,

2595
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:42,300
the mining process,

2596
01:24:42,301 --> 01:24:47,301
the verifies each block of transaction
and secure set is like a giant votes in

2597
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:49,680
election that happens every 10 minutes.

2598
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:52,110
And by looking at the transactions,

2599
01:24:52,111 --> 01:24:53,380
you can tell who has the bitcoin.

2600
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:54,990
If the entire network has said,

2601
01:24:55,680 --> 01:25:00,680
Andrea sent Joe a bitcoin and
that's been verified by the network,

2602
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:05,550
then everyone trusts Joe has a bitcoin
and will be willing to accept that

2603
01:25:05,551 --> 01:25:06,960
bitcoin and payment for something.

2604
01:25:06,961 --> 01:25:07,530
Right?

2605
01:25:07,530 --> 01:25:09,220
So essentially the,

2606
01:25:09,221 --> 01:25:13,980
you have this every 10 minutes you have
this consensus where the entire network

2607
01:25:13,981 --> 01:25:16,710
agrees on all of the
transactions that have happened,

2608
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:17,580
who has waltz,

2609
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:18,930
what's going on on the system,

2610
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:21,350
the ability to add,

2611
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:22,590
have massive scale.

2612
01:25:22,591 --> 01:25:24,630
Have everyone agree on what the truth is?

2613
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:30,060
That is the core invention behind bitcoin
does that makes currency possible,

2614
01:25:30,061 --> 01:25:32,220
but it also makes other things possible,

2615
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:33,630
including elections.

2616
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:37,350
So you can do some pretty incredible
things because what you've done is you've

2617
01:25:37,351 --> 01:25:39,030
decentralized decision making,

2618
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,700
the Internet decentralized communications.

2619
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,740
Bitcoin is decentralizing money,

2620
01:25:43,950 --> 01:25:48,340
but at its core is an invention that
decentralizes decisionmaking yeah,

2621
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:48,891
no.

2622
01:25:48,891 --> 01:25:53,891
What are the concerns as far as bitcoin
getting shut down and what repercussions

2623
01:25:54,501 --> 01:25:54,791
or what,

2624
01:25:54,791 --> 01:25:56,090
what kind of blow back,

2625
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:57,313
if any,

2626
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:59,490
have you guys received
the people that are,

2627
01:25:59,491 --> 01:25:59,750
uh,

2628
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:01,310
in charge of,

2629
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:02,233
you know,

2630
01:26:02,510 --> 01:26:04,490
spreading of this bitcoin

2631
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:05,780
evangelists as it were?

2632
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:06,090
I mean,

2633
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:06,350
is,

2634
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:09,320
is there any repercussions or
any blow back or is there any,

2635
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:10,190
nope,

2636
01:26:10,190 --> 01:26:11,023
nothing so far.

2637
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:11,361
No.

2638
01:26:11,361 --> 01:26:12,194
I mean,

2639
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:12,591
you know,

2640
01:26:12,591 --> 01:26:12,921
there's,

2641
01:26:12,921 --> 01:26:16,250
there's a little misunderstanding
that happen every now and then and,

2642
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:16,581
uh,

2643
01:26:16,581 --> 01:26:17,414
you know,

2644
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:18,560
um,

2645
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:22,550
people at first who don't
understand the technology sometimes,

2646
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:23,240
um,

2647
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:26,120
sit down and have conversations
to understand it better.

2648
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:27,200
But,

2649
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:27,471
you know,

2650
01:26:27,471 --> 01:26:27,631
the,

2651
01:26:27,631 --> 01:26:29,210
the point is that at the moment,

2652
01:26:29,211 --> 01:26:33,740
bitcoin is legal to use and it's not just
legal to use in the u s but it's legal

2653
01:26:33,741 --> 01:26:35,690
to use in pretty much every country,

2654
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:36,560
um,

2655
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:37,430
for individuals.

2656
01:26:37,431 --> 01:26:38,001
Certainly,

2657
01:26:38,001 --> 01:26:38,660
I think,

2658
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:41,810
I don't think any country has bandit
or has even attempted to ban it.

2659
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:43,183
Um,

2660
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:47,930
bitcoin is money as a piece of content
that you can send on the Internet.

2661
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:48,170
So if you,

2662
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:49,310
even if you wanted to ban it,

2663
01:26:49,311 --> 01:26:52,790
who would be relatively difficult to do
that without shutting down the Internet?

2664
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:55,610
So that's one thing to put out there.

2665
01:26:55,611 --> 01:26:57,030
But the point is a,

2666
01:26:57,031 --> 01:26:58,640
nobody's trying to ban bitcoin.

2667
01:26:58,670 --> 01:27:00,350
Nobody's trying to shut us down.

2668
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:05,360
I think especially in the u s and
especially among senior lawmakers like the

2669
01:27:05,361 --> 01:27:06,920
Senate who had hearings,

2670
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:07,520
uh,

2671
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,230
recently about Bitcoin,

2672
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:10,970
the prevailing attitude is,

2673
01:27:10,971 --> 01:27:11,271
look,

2674
01:27:11,271 --> 01:27:14,360
this is generating growth
is generating jobs.

2675
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:15,920
It's a huge innovation.

2676
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:17,190
And,

2677
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:17,540
um,

2678
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:20,900
we see that it's being used at a very
broad manner can change a lot of things.

2679
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:21,201
You know,

2680
01:27:21,201 --> 01:27:23,240
maybe we should take a
wait and see approach.

2681
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:23,670
Uh,

2682
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:26,840
and the price went up quite
dramatically after they said that.

2683
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,570
But the general attitude is most,

2684
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:33,680
most politicians are far more interested
in the possibility that this might

2685
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:37,310
generate growth and also
jobs and as a result,

2686
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:41,270
votes and campaign finance
money than they are about,

2687
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:42,020
you know,

2688
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:45,440
beating this down because it's
going to affect different interests.

2689
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:46,880
So there's still open to it.

2690
01:27:46,881 --> 01:27:50,930
And I think we've got a tremendous
opportunity to educate people about all of

2691
01:27:50,931 --> 01:27:54,730
the incredible things we can do and also
highlight the fact that this bitcoin

2692
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:59,740
economy just in the last
year has generated thousands
of jobs in an environment

2693
01:28:01,251 --> 01:28:03,320
where we have economic stagnation.

2694
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:06,680
We've got this bloom of
innovation and technology,

2695
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:07,580
uh,

2696
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:11,540
much like the first burst of
the Internet and you know,

2697
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:12,620
that's a tremendous thing.

2698
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:15,200
You don't want to squash that just
because of a misunderstanding.

2699
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:18,950
Do you think that there's a lack of blow
back because the people in the powers

2700
01:28:18,951 --> 01:28:22,280
of be just having considered bitcoin to
be a threat yet because we'll be talking

2701
01:28:22,281 --> 01:28:26,500
about like politicians not acting
to try to the sound set to service.

2702
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:28,800
They're the people that get
him in the office a little.

2703
01:28:28,801 --> 01:28:31,590
The little the lobbyists or special
interest groups that would have you like

2704
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:34,640
that's just because they haven't been
contacted by those people to try to do

2705
01:28:34,641 --> 01:28:35,660
something about bitcoin.

2706
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:41,020
I think even the banks are ambivalent on
this because while it may be disruptive

2707
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,520
to some of their banking practices,

2708
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:47,360
it is also one of the most interesting
and innovative things to happen in

2709
01:28:47,361 --> 01:28:49,040
finance in the last hundred years.

2710
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,890
And so I think a lot of banks
are smart enough to say,

2711
01:28:51,891 --> 01:28:52,221
look,

2712
01:28:52,221 --> 01:28:54,200
we were good at technology.

2713
01:28:54,450 --> 01:28:54,951
Um,

2714
01:28:54,951 --> 01:28:55,790
we know money,

2715
01:28:55,820 --> 01:28:56,930
we've got branches,

2716
01:28:56,931 --> 01:28:57,860
we've got customers,

2717
01:28:57,861 --> 01:28:58,700
we've got marketing,

2718
01:28:58,701 --> 01:28:59,421
we've got brands,

2719
01:28:59,421 --> 01:29:00,620
we know how to do security.

2720
01:29:00,621 --> 01:29:05,160
We could really make a good deal with
this bit coin thing and use it and make

2721
01:29:05,161 --> 01:29:07,020
some really interesting financial things.

2722
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:09,570
So there's this mixed bag,

2723
01:29:09,571 --> 01:29:10,404
just like,

2724
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:10,980
you know,

2725
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,390
and I'll bring the same example.

2726
01:29:12,391 --> 01:29:16,790
When entertainment companies were
first face with the possibility of MP3,

2727
01:29:17,070 --> 01:29:17,371
yes.

2728
01:29:17,371 --> 01:29:18,240
Some people were like,

2729
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:18,871
oh my God,

2730
01:29:18,871 --> 01:29:20,100
this is going to destroy everything.

2731
01:29:20,101 --> 01:29:21,060
Music will die.

2732
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:21,810
Right.

2733
01:29:21,810 --> 01:29:24,050
Which is the same they've said
with every previous technology,

2734
01:29:24,051 --> 01:29:24,670
you're were right though.

2735
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:25,140
Uh,

2736
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:25,590
but,

2737
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:25,890
but,

2738
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:26,281
but no,

2739
01:29:26,281 --> 01:29:27,510
they weren't because,

2740
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:29,310
right.

2741
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:29,721
But the,

2742
01:29:29,721 --> 01:29:31,350
the point is that since then,

2743
01:29:31,351 --> 01:29:33,060
the number of genres
and number of artists,

2744
01:29:33,061 --> 01:29:35,820
the number of the amount
of music has exploded.

2745
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:36,690
Um,

2746
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:39,510
people get a broader range
of music than ever before.

2747
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:42,960
And mp3s have created so much good
in the entertainment industry,

2748
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:44,370
so much more than damage.

2749
01:29:44,371 --> 01:29:45,180
Right?

2750
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,460
And I think even in banking environments,

2751
01:29:47,461 --> 01:29:50,490
they recognize that with
bitcoin there's this mixed bag,

2752
01:29:50,491 --> 01:29:52,980
which is that the good
far outweighs the bad.

2753
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:57,510
And even in a business that's going to
get disrupted as banking will be just

2754
01:29:57,511 --> 01:30:00,420
like entertainment and telephone
companies were disrupted by the Internet.

2755
01:30:00,990 --> 01:30:01,823
Um,

2756
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:05,760
those that are smart can take advantage
and they can build something good with

2757
01:30:05,761 --> 01:30:08,070
this and they're going to
lose some power and leverage,

2758
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,900
but they can make some
good money out of this.

2759
01:30:10,050 --> 01:30:13,320
So I don't think any was out
to get bitcoin right now.

2760
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:13,620
Right.

2761
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:14,490
I think people are,

2762
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:16,590
are commonly evaluating it's,

2763
01:30:16,591 --> 01:30:16,891
and,

2764
01:30:16,891 --> 01:30:17,221
and,

2765
01:30:17,221 --> 01:30:19,560
and thinking about what
opportunities it can bring.

2766
01:30:19,561 --> 01:30:20,760
And I think that's the best approach.

2767
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:21,623
Would you pull up,

2768
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:22,400
uh,

2769
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,280
about the taxes?

2770
01:30:23,281 --> 01:30:26,880
Because I guess there's this
whole thing going on that people,

2771
01:30:26,980 --> 01:30:27,160
uh,

2772
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,680
need to claim the,

2773
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:28,881
the,

2774
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:29,091
the,

2775
01:30:29,091 --> 01:30:29,520
the,

2776
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:33,510
the stuff that the purchases or the
money that they get from bitcoin on your

2777
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:33,961
taxes,

2778
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:36,150
but the IRS hasn't said how to do it yet.

2779
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:37,861
Well,

2780
01:30:37,861 --> 01:30:37,961
I,

2781
01:30:37,961 --> 01:30:38,311
I mean,

2782
01:30:38,311 --> 01:30:40,560
I've discussed this with my
accountant and they gave me a pretty

2783
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:41,280
straightforward,

2784
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,061
a formula.

2785
01:30:42,061 --> 01:30:43,440
If I earn income on Bitcoin,

2786
01:30:43,441 --> 01:30:46,950
I'm mark how many dollars it was at the
time and I pay income taxes on that.

2787
01:30:46,951 --> 01:30:47,850
Just like anything else,

2788
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:49,650
I've invested in some bitcoin.

2789
01:30:49,651 --> 01:30:51,390
If I hold it for less than six months,

2790
01:30:51,450 --> 01:30:55,740
I'll declare a short term capital gains
more and more than a here I'll longterm

2791
01:30:55,741 --> 01:30:58,230
capital gains and pay the difference.

2792
01:30:58,650 --> 01:30:58,980
I mean,

2793
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:01,620
that's basically how I
would work with euros.

2794
01:31:01,621 --> 01:31:03,810
That's how I'm going
to work with a bitcoin.

2795
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:06,450
The key word you're saying
how you're going to,

2796
01:31:06,451 --> 01:31:09,060
that's what's interesting about this is
you actually haven't started doing that

2797
01:31:09,061 --> 01:31:13,260
yet because you've only been starting to
get paid fully in bitcoin over the last

2798
01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:13,320
few months.

2799
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,180
So this is fairly
experimental even for you,

2800
01:31:15,181 --> 01:31:17,010
you're basically at the
cutting edge of this,

2801
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:17,610
right.

2802
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:19,760
So I mean there are people
who have already filed

2803
01:31:19,810 --> 01:31:20,360
Texas,

2804
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:20,581
uh,

2805
01:31:20,581 --> 01:31:22,840
a few times and they've
used the same approach.

2806
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:23,620
Um,

2807
01:31:23,620 --> 01:31:28,450
I'm going to be filing income taxes in
Bitcoin for the first time for 2013 but I

2808
01:31:28,451 --> 01:31:28,601
mean,

2809
01:31:28,601 --> 01:31:31,120
I'm discussing it with accountants and
they think it's pretty straight forward

2810
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:34,600
when I think the IRS will
give us guidance before April.

2811
01:31:34,601 --> 01:31:38,890
And the reason I think they will is
because the IRS is interested in or in

2812
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:43,920
making revenue and what better way to
make revenue from bitcoin than to simply

2813
01:31:43,991 --> 01:31:47,140
explain exactly how people should
pay their taxes on it so we can,

2814
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,870
things are going to get
really weird if it takes off.

2815
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:50,740
Yeah.

2816
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:53,740
They're already weird and had
already took off you think.

2817
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:54,360
Yeah,

2818
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:54,581
yeah,

2819
01:31:54,581 --> 01:31:55,151
absolutely.

2820
01:31:55,151 --> 01:31:55,340
I mean,

2821
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:55,730
that's

2822
01:31:55,730 --> 01:31:56,010
of,

2823
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:58,060
but I don't know anybody
who's using it all the time.

2824
01:31:58,061 --> 01:31:58,800
I mean,

2825
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,100
you might say if you're,

2826
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:00,431
you know,

2827
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:02,260
you're on involved in these online groups,

2828
01:32:02,261 --> 01:32:06,040
but the actual percentage of people that
are using big coin and regular basis,

2829
01:32:06,041 --> 01:32:06,760
what is it,

2830
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:09,670
one half of one half of 1% I mean is maybe

2831
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:10,280
there are,

2832
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,600
there's probably,

2833
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:12,463
um,

2834
01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:13,821
you know,

2835
01:32:13,821 --> 01:32:14,690
several million.

2836
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:18,290
Is it over 10 cents less
than 10 in this country?

2837
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:18,561
No,

2838
01:32:18,561 --> 01:32:19,071
worldwide.

2839
01:32:19,071 --> 01:32:20,180
But most of it's in this country.

2840
01:32:20,181 --> 01:32:20,480
There's a,

2841
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:23,720
there's a million people in this country
that are using bitcoin on a regular

2842
01:32:23,721 --> 01:32:24,554
basis.

2843
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:25,011
Well,

2844
01:32:25,011 --> 01:32:25,221
that,

2845
01:32:25,221 --> 01:32:25,850
I don't know,

2846
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:26,091
uh,

2847
01:32:26,091 --> 01:32:26,511
and it's,

2848
01:32:26,511 --> 01:32:28,310
and it's not easy to find out,

2849
01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:31,220
but what I do know is for it to
be taking off is what I'm saying.

2850
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:33,340
So what I'm thinking about is,

2851
01:32:33,380 --> 01:32:34,400
in terms of taking off,

2852
01:32:34,401 --> 01:32:35,900
this has been around for five years.

2853
01:32:35,901 --> 01:32:40,901
It's been a very stable and secure
network that has preserved or increased in

2854
01:32:40,971 --> 01:32:41,804
value.

2855
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:42,800
At the same time,

2856
01:32:42,801 --> 01:32:45,200
people have gradually
improve the technology.

2857
01:32:45,201 --> 01:32:48,080
Now we've got this whole raft to
startups that are doing innovation and

2858
01:32:48,081 --> 01:32:49,970
delivering better and
better products around it.

2859
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:52,550
More and more merchants are
doing it and most importantly,

2860
01:32:52,551 --> 01:32:53,450
it's gone global.

2861
01:32:53,570 --> 01:32:57,650
It's now being used in dozens of countries
around the world and the network is

2862
01:32:57,651 --> 01:32:59,600
large and getting larger every day.

2863
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:04,810
So all of those conditions reminds me
exactly of what the Internet was in 1992.

2864
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:05,990
Again,

2865
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:10,990
most people didn't hear about it until
94 95 and at that point you had people go

2866
01:33:12,081 --> 01:33:13,250
on the morning show and say,

2867
01:33:13,251 --> 01:33:13,850
you know,

2868
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:16,430
is internet the email
or what's this at sign?

2869
01:33:16,431 --> 01:33:17,630
And then we're having that conversation.

2870
01:33:17,631 --> 01:33:20,300
But it had already been
growing quite rapidly.

2871
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:21,890
I think that's where we are with bitcoin.

2872
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:23,750
My mom is not going to do,

2873
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:24,231
you know,

2874
01:33:24,231 --> 01:33:25,370
bitcoin on her own,

2875
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:25,941
uh,

2876
01:33:25,941 --> 01:33:27,560
for another six or seven years.

2877
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:28,310
Uh,

2878
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:31,790
most people won't hear much about it
for the next two years are going to hear

2879
01:33:31,791 --> 01:33:32,780
about it occasionally.

2880
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:36,500
But in the meantime it's been
building momentum and getting better.

2881
01:33:36,590 --> 01:33:37,220
And,

2882
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:37,610
uh,

2883
01:33:37,610 --> 01:33:39,230
I think it's already arrived.

2884
01:33:39,290 --> 01:33:42,110
Certainly the invention behind it,

2885
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,420
which has also spawned
many other currencies.

2886
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,680
Um,

2887
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,540
you can't uninvent invent that invention.

2888
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,160
So in whatever form.

2889
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:51,080
And if it's not this bit coin currency,

2890
01:33:51,081 --> 01:33:53,420
which I think is already
pretty damn strong.

2891
01:33:54,110 --> 01:33:54,830
Um,

2892
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:55,101
you know,

2893
01:33:55,101 --> 01:33:59,000
that same invention can
be repeated and improved.

2894
01:33:59,180 --> 01:34:00,260
Just like you know,

2895
01:34:00,261 --> 01:34:03,290
the Internet's the first
early versions were really,

2896
01:34:03,291 --> 01:34:08,291
really clunky and gradually and improved
and keep in mind currency is just the

2897
01:34:08,361 --> 01:34:09,290
first application.

2898
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:11,840
So if you were on the internet
and you only knew email,

2899
01:34:11,841 --> 01:34:14,480
you couldn't even imagine
what the web would be like,

2900
01:34:14,481 --> 01:34:17,960
let alone social media or mp3s
or digital music and video.

2901
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:20,270
Internet still is a,

2902
01:34:20,271 --> 01:34:21,260
bitcoin is still like that.

2903
01:34:21,261 --> 01:34:22,490
We've got the bitcoin currency,

2904
01:34:22,491 --> 01:34:25,640
which is just like email and
it's the basic application.

2905
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:29,720
Now companies are building the other
applications and it's getting really

2906
01:34:29,721 --> 01:34:30,171
exciting.

2907
01:34:30,171 --> 01:34:34,040
So I think we've got a bit
to go until we're mainstream,

2908
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:35,530
but I think it's already

2909
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:37,990
catching on now in other
countries it's the,

2910
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:41,710
the government has been not so
sweet about the use of bitcoin.

2911
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:44,800
And there's an article that came out
just a few hours ago from Russia,

2912
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:46,310
the Russian central bank.

2913
01:34:46,311 --> 01:34:48,520
So the bitcoin users could face jail time.

2914
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:49,600
They did.

2915
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,280
Yeah,

2916
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:50,891
it's up there.

2917
01:34:50,891 --> 01:34:55,890
It's actually was in Time magazine
a this is off Lariya Novo Ski.

2918
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:56,620
Alright,

2919
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:57,453
lovely.

2920
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:58,140
I'll just

2921
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:00,830
as you know that other countries
have done the same thing,

2922
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:02,150
including China.

2923
01:35:02,151 --> 01:35:03,380
And I mean,

2924
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:05,390
what if you use bitcoin and then,

2925
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:06,110
you know,

2926
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:07,520
two years from now they say it's illegal.

2927
01:35:07,521 --> 01:35:07,741
I mean,

2928
01:35:07,741 --> 01:35:08,130
are these,

2929
01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:09,290
well this is crazy.

2930
01:35:09,310 --> 01:35:12,000
This was released right
before we started the podcast.

2931
01:35:12,001 --> 01:35:14,040
A couple of hours before
we started this podcast,

2932
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:15,060
they released the story.

2933
01:35:15,330 --> 01:35:17,340
So it's a fairly breaking news.

2934
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,960
So I haven't seen the story.

2935
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:20,153
What I can say,

2936
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:20,731
first of all,

2937
01:35:20,731 --> 01:35:22,350
if it's saying that
it's the same in China,

2938
01:35:22,351 --> 01:35:22,861
they're wrong.

2939
01:35:22,861 --> 01:35:25,830
So that makes me wonder what
else they're wrong about.

2940
01:35:25,831 --> 01:35:27,180
But in China,

2941
01:35:27,181 --> 01:35:31,800
they banned central banks and
other banking institutions
from holding bitcoin on

2942
01:35:31,801 --> 01:35:32,611
their asset ledger.

2943
01:35:32,611 --> 01:35:34,080
They didn't ban people from trading.

2944
01:35:34,081 --> 01:35:34,914
In fact,

2945
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:38,160
bitcoin is like 60% or more of
the trading happens in China.

2946
01:35:38,161 --> 01:35:39,710
They didn't ban people from using it.

2947
01:35:39,711 --> 01:35:41,580
It's perfectly legal to
use it there as well.

2948
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:42,600
Um,

2949
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:43,830
I think you might be,

2950
01:35:43,890 --> 01:35:45,330
it might be an exaggerated headlines,

2951
01:35:45,331 --> 01:35:46,320
but even if it isn't,

2952
01:35:46,470 --> 01:35:47,010
um,

2953
01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:47,460
you know,

2954
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:48,720
if Russia bans bitcoin,

2955
01:35:48,721 --> 01:35:51,810
I think that probably ends up
hurting Russia more than bitcoin.

2956
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:53,250
Yeah.

2957
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:56,070
China's limited bitcoin
use for fruit citizens.

2958
01:35:56,071 --> 01:35:57,990
Apparently it's on a few different,

2959
01:35:57,991 --> 01:35:58,300
yeah.

2960
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:01,060
China also limits a Internet
to use for its citizens.

2961
01:36:01,061 --> 01:36:02,920
So that doesn't devalue the Internet.

2962
01:36:03,010 --> 01:36:03,251
I mean,

2963
01:36:03,251 --> 01:36:03,701
that's the,

2964
01:36:03,701 --> 01:36:04,960
that's the point about this.

2965
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:06,580
And keep in mind,

2966
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:10,000
there's also a matter of due process
of law and there's also a matter of

2967
01:36:10,001 --> 01:36:10,930
different legal structures.

2968
01:36:10,931 --> 01:36:11,531
So for example,

2969
01:36:11,531 --> 01:36:11,951
in India,

2970
01:36:11,951 --> 01:36:14,680
the first reaction of
the of the regulator is,

2971
01:36:14,681 --> 01:36:15,340
was,

2972
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:15,551
well,

2973
01:36:15,551 --> 01:36:18,160
if it's not specifically
licensed and permitted,

2974
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:19,361
it's not legal.

2975
01:36:19,361 --> 01:36:19,831
That's their,

2976
01:36:19,831 --> 01:36:23,710
their legal system is
attitude is we say it's legal,

2977
01:36:23,711 --> 01:36:24,131
it's legal.

2978
01:36:24,131 --> 01:36:25,630
If we haven't said anything about it,

2979
01:36:25,631 --> 01:36:26,470
then it's legal for,

2980
01:36:26,490 --> 01:36:26,741
right.

2981
01:36:26,741 --> 01:36:27,700
You need the license.

2982
01:36:28,060 --> 01:36:29,710
So it's the inverse of US law.

2983
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:31,243
Um,

2984
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:31,840
but,

2985
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:32,171
uh,

2986
01:36:32,171 --> 01:36:32,441
you know,

2987
01:36:32,441 --> 01:36:33,001
certainly,

2988
01:36:33,001 --> 01:36:33,310
uh,

2989
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:34,480
here in the U s I'm not,

2990
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:36,340
I'm certainly not worried
about it being pants,

2991
01:36:36,341 --> 01:36:36,671
hair,

2992
01:36:36,671 --> 01:36:40,120
because there is a lot of legal
precedent for private currencies in this

2993
01:36:40,121 --> 01:36:40,954
country.

2994
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:44,140
And there's constitutional protections
and there's companies that can defend

2995
01:36:44,141 --> 01:36:45,070
themselves against that.

2996
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:45,340
We,

2997
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:47,850
you have a lot of people that listen
to this podcast from other countries.

2998
01:36:47,851 --> 01:36:49,500
It's one of the reasons why
I wanted to bring that up,

2999
01:36:49,530 --> 01:36:50,880
the Russia story,

3000
01:36:50,881 --> 01:36:51,280
but,

3001
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:51,630
uh,

3002
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:55,240
to point out that this is not a
universally accepted things as far as the

3003
01:36:55,390 --> 01:36:58,650
governments and the ambivalence
of American banks that
they've shown an American

3004
01:36:58,651 --> 01:36:59,484
politicians.

3005
01:36:59,580 --> 01:36:59,881
This is,

3006
01:36:59,881 --> 01:37:01,830
it may not be the case in other countries.

3007
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:04,620
Was this Bank of Russia issues
warning on digital currencies?

3008
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:05,221
Well,

3009
01:37:05,221 --> 01:37:05,491
you know,

3010
01:37:05,491 --> 01:37:07,290
Russia is incredibly suppressive place.

3011
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:07,590
Uh,

3012
01:37:07,590 --> 01:37:08,490
we know that,

3013
01:37:08,810 --> 01:37:09,510
uh,

3014
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:09,781
you know,

3015
01:37:09,781 --> 01:37:11,550
we know what's going on
with them and gay people.

3016
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:12,413
I mean,

3017
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:12,880
it's,

3018
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:13,381
it's a,

3019
01:37:13,381 --> 01:37:13,921
a really,

3020
01:37:13,921 --> 01:37:14,070
uh,

3021
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:14,880
it's appalling,

3022
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,110
very strange,

3023
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:18,440
backwards country in,

3024
01:37:18,441 --> 01:37:21,570
in terms of a lot of the things that
they think in a lot of the ways that they

3025
01:37:21,571 --> 01:37:22,800
behave as a nation.

3026
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:23,221
And,

3027
01:37:23,221 --> 01:37:23,461
you know,

3028
01:37:23,461 --> 01:37:25,560
it's basically also run by one gangster.

3029
01:37:25,660 --> 01:37:25,961
It's a,

3030
01:37:25,961 --> 01:37:27,300
it's not a country of laws,

3031
01:37:27,301 --> 01:37:28,050
that's for sure.

3032
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:28,350
Well,

3033
01:37:28,350 --> 01:37:29,070
I mean,

3034
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:29,851
without a doubt,

3035
01:37:29,851 --> 01:37:30,211
Putin,

3036
01:37:30,211 --> 01:37:32,150
whether he's a great leader and not his,

3037
01:37:32,151 --> 01:37:32,820
uh,

3038
01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:33,653
his gangster,

3039
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:33,931
you know,

3040
01:37:33,931 --> 01:37:37,980
he's just a super awesome when
at it he's running the country.

3041
01:37:37,981 --> 01:37:39,840
You used to be the president stepped down,

3042
01:37:39,841 --> 01:37:42,900
put a puppet government and probably
his and then became the president again.

3043
01:37:42,901 --> 01:37:45,210
I mean the whole thing is magical

3044
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:49,350
and then rode around on a
horse bare chested splendour.

3045
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:49,621
Yeah.

3046
01:37:49,621 --> 01:37:51,090
That was pretty crazy and weird.

3047
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:51,300
Oh,

3048
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:52,580
he does a lot of weird things.

3049
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:54,050
Him and Obama were,

3050
01:37:54,051 --> 01:37:54,560
uh,

3051
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,640
they were both conflicted.

3052
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:59,640
They were in some area and they
were conflicted as far as like,

3053
01:37:59,641 --> 01:38:01,470
when they could use the gym,

3054
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:01,820
take it.

3055
01:38:01,820 --> 01:38:04,350
They weren't allowed to use the gym
together for some fucking reason.

3056
01:38:04,770 --> 01:38:07,770
Like as if Putin and Obama can't
work out in the gym together.

3057
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:08,161
Like,

3058
01:38:08,161 --> 01:38:09,390
do you know how fucking crazy that is?

3059
01:38:09,391 --> 01:38:09,860
Like,

3060
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:10,141
dude,

3061
01:38:10,141 --> 01:38:11,400
I'll be on a stairmaster.

3062
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:12,413
You hit the weights.

3063
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:13,230
Is that cool?

3064
01:38:13,230 --> 01:38:13,501
No,

3065
01:38:13,501 --> 01:38:14,520
they can't be in the room together.

3066
01:38:14,521 --> 01:38:18,030
Like they're afraid that Putin might beat
him over the head with a fucking club

3067
01:38:18,031 --> 01:38:18,840
or something.

3068
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:22,770
But so while Obama was
in the gym working out,

3069
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:25,650
Putin jumped in the fucking
lake outside the gym.

3070
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:26,321
So in,

3071
01:38:26,321 --> 01:38:28,440
in clear view of Obama and his,

3072
01:38:28,441 --> 01:38:29,040
uh,

3073
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:29,580
you know,

3074
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:33,690
it's fucking elastic bands and he's
doing his little aerobics stretches with

3075
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:34,680
Putin swimming.

3076
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:35,460
That's hilarious.

3077
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:36,390
In a fucking lake.

3078
01:38:36,391 --> 01:38:36,870
Freezing,

3079
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:38,280
freezing cold lake,

3080
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:39,450
like a man,

3081
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,480
like a bare chest at savage
and an old spice commercial,

3082
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,940
a Russian old spice master.

3083
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:47,303
Unbelievable.

3084
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:49,170
They're just pissed
off about Alaska still.

3085
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,790
Did you ever hear that old story that,

3086
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:51,893
about how the,

3087
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:53,790
they sold Alaska to us for,

3088
01:38:53,791 --> 01:38:57,870
I think it was like $12 million and
then we bought it from them like an or

3089
01:38:57,930 --> 01:38:58,231
whatever,

3090
01:38:58,231 --> 01:39:02,690
1,817 hundreds and then we found
so much gold in Alaska that,

3091
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:03,750
that they would have,

3092
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:04,440
you know,

3093
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,560
tripled the amount that
we paid for Alaska.

3094
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:08,310
Even just on gold.

3095
01:39:08,460 --> 01:39:11,370
Forget the oil and everything
else will ask is amazing.

3096
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:12,263
They fucked up.

3097
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:14,340
It's way better than Russia dummies.

3098
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:17,330
They could have had a
vacation spot and we'll,

3099
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:18,490
anchorage is the shit man.

3100
01:39:18,491 --> 01:39:20,250
I was one of my favorite
places I've ever visited.

3101
01:39:20,550 --> 01:39:21,121
It's amazing.

3102
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:23,190
And the view that when you
drive into the mountains,

3103
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:24,300
oh my God,

3104
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:25,980
it's just magical up there.

3105
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:26,933
It's incredible.

3106
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:28,410
Yeah,

3107
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:28,770
I dunno.

3108
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:29,820
Russia is a weird spot,

3109
01:39:29,821 --> 01:39:30,330
man.

3110
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:30,670
You know,

3111
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:32,280
Russia has had a long,

3112
01:39:32,281 --> 01:39:33,180
hard history,

3113
01:39:33,690 --> 01:39:36,540
has been a lot of horrible things that
have happened to the Russian people,

3114
01:39:36,541 --> 01:39:36,870
both,

3115
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:37,410
you know,

3116
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:39,580
World War Two and before that there were,

3117
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,570
they were occupied by the
Mongols for 200 years.

3118
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:43,261
I mean,

3119
01:39:43,261 --> 01:39:47,100
it's just a rough country and
when it comes to their laws,

3120
01:39:47,101 --> 01:39:47,330
lemon,

3121
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:51,780
they've got some really fucking shady
laws and real weird attitudes on things

3122
01:39:51,781 --> 01:39:52,021
too,

3123
01:39:52,021 --> 01:39:52,550
man.

3124
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:52,780
You know,

3125
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:56,100
they have a habit of shipping people
that don't agree with them off to Siberia

3126
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:56,881
like that.

3127
01:39:56,881 --> 01:39:57,420
Um,

3128
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:00,480
that one really wealthy oligarch fellow,

3129
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:03,240
it was one of the most
richest men in Russia,

3130
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:04,180
but crosswords,

3131
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:05,070
Putin,

3132
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:07,320
Putin just sent that motherfucker to jail,

3133
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,870
kept him in jail for 10 years
and then finally released him,

3134
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:12,840
have massive public outcry.

3135
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:13,710
It's,

3136
01:40:13,710 --> 01:40:14,550
this guy was,

3137
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:15,240
you know,

3138
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,770
they trumped up charges against him.

3139
01:40:16,771 --> 01:40:18,510
Just locked them up in
a cage for a decade.

3140
01:40:18,790 --> 01:40:19,121
Yeah.

3141
01:40:19,121 --> 01:40:19,331
Well,

3142
01:40:19,331 --> 01:40:20,164
here's the,

3143
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:25,260
here's the other perspective on this
switches in places like the u s if the,

3144
01:40:25,690 --> 01:40:27,100
if the government banned some things,

3145
01:40:27,101 --> 01:40:29,470
they go through a very
long arduous process.

3146
01:40:29,471 --> 01:40:30,370
They go through courts,

3147
01:40:30,371 --> 01:40:31,570
they have to prove their case.

3148
01:40:31,571 --> 01:40:35,620
They can just willingly do it
and it takes a long process.

3149
01:40:35,621 --> 01:40:38,980
And generally the people
kind of agree with it.

3150
01:40:39,310 --> 01:40:42,850
Now in a lot of places in the world when
something is banned by the government

3151
01:40:42,851 --> 01:40:43,510
that people go,

3152
01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:44,140
hmm,

3153
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:45,550
maybe I should look into that.

3154
01:40:45,940 --> 01:40:47,050
So you know,

3155
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:48,340
the fact that it's banned in Russia,

3156
01:40:48,341 --> 01:40:50,410
it doesn't necessarily mean
the bitcoin disappears.

3157
01:40:50,411 --> 01:40:53,950
It simply means that bitcoin is more
of an underground in that place.

3158
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:58,240
And people have a lot less respect for
laws that are arbitrary and capricious.

3159
01:40:58,570 --> 01:41:02,200
So in countries where you have week
rule of law and you have rule of people

3160
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,460
correspondingly,

3161
01:41:03,461 --> 01:41:05,500
the people don't pay
much attention to those.

3162
01:41:05,710 --> 01:41:05,891
Uh,

3163
01:41:05,891 --> 01:41:06,191
you know,

3164
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:08,040
a lot of things are illegal in Russia,

3165
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:09,550
including s you know,

3166
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:11,560
buying and selling dollars
on the black market.

3167
01:41:11,561 --> 01:41:13,480
And you can do it on
every corner in Moscow.

3168
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:13,950
Yeah.

3169
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:15,670
Isn't essentially illegal to be gay.

3170
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:16,250
I mean,

3171
01:41:16,250 --> 01:41:16,721
what are the,

3172
01:41:16,721 --> 01:41:17,800
what are the laws on gay people?

3173
01:41:17,801 --> 01:41:18,850
They're incredibly restrictive.

3174
01:41:18,851 --> 01:41:19,684
Right?

3175
01:41:20,090 --> 01:41:20,590
Okay.

3176
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:21,010
Yeah,

3177
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:21,470
I have,

3178
01:41:21,470 --> 01:41:22,540
I don't know what the,

3179
01:41:22,541 --> 01:41:22,870
I don't,

3180
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:24,250
it's not illegal to be gay,

3181
01:41:24,251 --> 01:41:25,420
but I think it's more,

3182
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:26,313
um,

3183
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:27,790
uh,

3184
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:30,280
there are still sodomy
laws and there are still,

3185
01:41:30,281 --> 01:41:31,114
um,

3186
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:31,870
um,

3187
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:34,510
bans on public displays
and things like that.

3188
01:41:34,570 --> 01:41:34,891
It's,

3189
01:41:34,891 --> 01:41:35,770
it's really,

3190
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:37,480
or even symbols.

3191
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:39,940
They arrested someone on
the Sochi parade route with,

3192
01:41:39,941 --> 01:41:41,140
for holding a rainbow flag.

3193
01:41:41,141 --> 01:41:41,974
It was disgusting.

3194
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:42,480
That's all

3195
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:45,320
Marius the gays have
taken over the rainbow.

3196
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:46,071
I love that.

3197
01:41:46,071 --> 01:41:46,731
We rainbows,

3198
01:41:46,731 --> 01:41:47,271
we were a kid.

3199
01:41:47,271 --> 01:41:49,730
It's like fucking leprechauns pot of gold,

3200
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:50,601
you know,

3201
01:41:50,601 --> 01:41:54,110
beautiful sunshine after
the rain and now it's gay.

3202
01:41:54,590 --> 01:41:56,150
I'd the fuck did they do that?

3203
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:59,030
You can get arrested for having
a fucking rainbow shirt on.

3204
01:41:59,150 --> 01:41:59,361
I would.

3205
01:41:59,361 --> 01:42:00,680
I'm just a fan of rainbows.

3206
01:42:00,890 --> 01:42:03,110
What if this rainbow shirt and you
got a Leprechaun at the end of it?

3207
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:04,410
What did they say then?

3208
01:42:05,650 --> 01:42:09,200
If you have a rainbow shirt on
the Leprechaun and a pot of gold,

3209
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:10,130
I'm sure you get that.

3210
01:42:10,130 --> 01:42:13,340
To argue that in court about three months
after you were arrested after spending

3211
01:42:13,341 --> 01:42:14,540
three months in a dungeon.

3212
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:15,950
So yeah.

3213
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:17,480
Well you have butt sex
while you were in there,

3214
01:42:17,481 --> 01:42:18,314
so it might be great.

3215
01:42:18,570 --> 01:42:20,130
Well that's the old Lenny Bruce joke.

3216
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:21,150
You know,

3217
01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:23,460
there was like one of the
classic Lenny Bruce Jokes.

3218
01:42:23,850 --> 01:42:27,300
I don't understand why they would make
the laws against homosexuality dig.

3219
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:32,040
They take a guy who's gay and they arrest
him and they put him in jail with a

3220
01:42:32,041 --> 01:42:33,390
bunch of men and when
I have sex with them.

3221
01:42:34,970 --> 01:42:35,150
Yep.

3222
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:35,980
It was Lenny Bruce,

3223
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:36,490
Lenny Bruce.

3224
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:36,910
Oh Wow.

3225
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:37,091
Yeah.

3226
01:42:37,091 --> 01:42:37,960
That was a classic.

3227
01:42:38,110 --> 01:42:39,780
That was one that people uh,

3228
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:40,451
stolen.

3229
01:42:40,451 --> 01:42:41,830
They didn't even realize they stole it.

3230
01:42:41,831 --> 01:42:42,220
Yeah.

3231
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:44,460
Because a lot of people
sort of recognize that.

3232
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,670
It's like when I was,

3233
01:42:45,671 --> 01:42:46,360
uh,

3234
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,650
an open mic night comedian,

3235
01:42:47,651 --> 01:42:52,651
I've lived in Boston and Boston is of
course south of New Hampshire and New

3236
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:56,200
Hampshire had a license plate
that said live free or die.

3237
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:57,281
And of course,

3238
01:42:57,281 --> 01:42:57,550
the,

3239
01:42:57,550 --> 01:43:02,290
the old classic story about license plates
is that they were made by prisoners.

3240
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:06,460
So like 10 guys came up with
that joke independently.

3241
01:43:06,850 --> 01:43:07,900
The live free or die.

3242
01:43:07,901 --> 01:43:08,051
Well,

3243
01:43:08,051 --> 01:43:08,830
the problem with that is,

3244
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:09,600
you know,

3245
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:10,560
they're made by prisoners.

3246
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:12,930
That's one of those things.

3247
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:15,143
Yeah.

3248
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:16,673
Bitcoin,

3249
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:17,513
what,

3250
01:43:18,450 --> 01:43:18,961
where did we go?

3251
01:43:18,961 --> 01:43:20,160
We went off track,

3252
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:21,143
went into the woods.

3253
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:26,080
Is there any kind of insurance or it
company that's going to back up Bitcoin,

3254
01:43:26,081 --> 01:43:27,670
like an insurance company kind of like,

3255
01:43:27,671 --> 01:43:27,881
you know,

3256
01:43:27,881 --> 01:43:29,560
when a bank gets robbed,

3257
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:30,550
US protected,

3258
01:43:30,930 --> 01:43:31,150
uh,

3259
01:43:31,150 --> 01:43:31,721
Ashley,

3260
01:43:31,721 --> 01:43:32,530
um,

3261
01:43:32,530 --> 01:43:35,650
as in many areas of kind
of emerging markets.

3262
01:43:35,651 --> 01:43:37,780
One of the first to move
in as Lloyd's of London,

3263
01:43:37,900 --> 01:43:41,050
which have historically been involved in,

3264
01:43:41,051 --> 01:43:44,260
in types of insurance that other companies
won't necessarily offer first and

3265
01:43:44,261 --> 01:43:45,550
introduce the new market.

3266
01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:49,840
So there was an organization
in the UK that will take,

3267
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:51,020
uh,

3268
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:55,100
where you can store bitcoin and then have
it in short by Lloyd's of London for a

3269
01:43:55,101 --> 01:43:57,110
specific fee and they'll
protect it from theft.

3270
01:43:57,890 --> 01:43:59,300
But here's the interesting thing.

3271
01:43:59,380 --> 01:43:59,690
Uh,

3272
01:43:59,690 --> 01:44:00,140
that's a,

3273
01:44:00,140 --> 01:44:02,270
that's a fairly limited approach to it.

3274
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:03,970
But what you can do with,

3275
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:08,660
with Bitcoin is you can take insurance
contracts and the guarantees of insurance

3276
01:44:08,661 --> 01:44:11,060
companies and embed them
into the transaction system.

3277
01:44:11,450 --> 01:44:12,590
So now you could have,

3278
01:44:12,591 --> 01:44:13,430
for example,

3279
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:17,750
let's say when you go and buy something
on Ebay and you do a paypal transaction

3280
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:19,880
and they give you the
ability to do escrow.

3281
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:22,340
So if the product never
arrives at your doorstep,

3282
01:44:22,610 --> 01:44:23,810
you can get your money back.

3283
01:44:23,811 --> 01:44:25,610
Right now when you do that,

3284
01:44:25,611 --> 01:44:27,260
you have to use paypal escrow.

3285
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:28,850
You don't really have a choice.

3286
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:30,200
And when you do that with visa,

3287
01:44:30,201 --> 01:44:31,370
you have to use visa escrow.

3288
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:31,821
Well,

3289
01:44:31,821 --> 01:44:36,340
on Bitcoin you can pick an escrow provider
and have them add their own key and

3290
01:44:36,341 --> 01:44:40,550
to the transaction and now they're going
to be your escrow and you chose them.

3291
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:41,510
Um,

3292
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:44,780
so you can pick from a market of escrow
companies and they can do it without

3293
01:44:44,781 --> 01:44:49,250
actually holding your money simply by
putting an extra key in the transaction

3294
01:44:49,251 --> 01:44:50,690
and neither authorizing it or not.

3295
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:52,333
I see.

3296
01:44:52,550 --> 01:44:56,990
So it opens up all of these
possibilities for new forms of insurance,

3297
01:44:56,991 --> 01:44:58,140
new forms of escrow,

3298
01:44:58,200 --> 01:45:02,540
new forms of financial protections that
couldn't be done with traditional money.

3299
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:03,740
The edge,

3300
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:06,590
there was news just out that
a Jamaican bobsled team,

3301
01:45:06,591 --> 01:45:08,210
this was from bitcoin was it,

3302
01:45:08,211 --> 01:45:10,340
but it was a dodge coin
or whatever it's called,

3303
01:45:10,341 --> 01:45:13,040
raise $30,000 for this year's a Olympics.

3304
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:13,874
Just the other day.

3305
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:14,631
Yeah,

3306
01:45:14,631 --> 01:45:15,260
and I mean,

3307
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:18,170
here's the other is story
that's not told very often,

3308
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,820
which is the charity aspect.

3309
01:45:20,150 --> 01:45:21,380
In study after study,

3310
01:45:21,381 --> 01:45:25,460
after study looking both the charitable
organizations and user profiles,

3311
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:26,330
um,

3312
01:45:26,330 --> 01:45:27,350
and questionnaires,

3313
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:31,400
bitcoin users have said repeatedly that
the number one thing they do with their

3314
01:45:31,401 --> 01:45:33,290
bitcoin is donate or give them away.

3315
01:45:33,650 --> 01:45:33,980
Um,

3316
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:38,980
charity is very active on the bitcoin
blocks blockchain on the bitcoin network.

3317
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:40,473
Um,

3318
01:45:40,490 --> 01:45:41,510
just recently,

3319
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:46,760
bitcoiners raised a ton of money for
the hurricane and the Philippines.

3320
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:47,630
Um,

3321
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:51,170
there's a number of charts
we'll organizations helping
the homeless in Florida.

3322
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:52,130
Um,

3323
01:45:52,130 --> 01:45:55,310
there's other organizations
doing the same in San Francisco,

3324
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:56,990
all based around bitcoin.

3325
01:45:57,170 --> 01:46:00,800
So there's this incredible
charitable giving spirit and it's on,

3326
01:46:00,801 --> 01:46:03,230
we're seeing that replicates
with other coins to,

3327
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:04,130
um,

3328
01:46:04,130 --> 01:46:09,130
one of the other interesting ones is the
wikileaks recently announced that the

3329
01:46:09,561 --> 01:46:11,090
vast majority of their,

3330
01:46:11,130 --> 01:46:11,330
uh,

3331
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:13,700
donations now come in cryptocurrencies.

3332
01:46:13,701 --> 01:46:14,091
Bitcoin,

3333
01:46:14,091 --> 01:46:14,924
unlike coin,

3334
01:46:15,110 --> 01:46:18,920
this is fascinating because
on certain payment networks,

3335
01:46:19,550 --> 01:46:20,630
you can't donate to,

3336
01:46:20,690 --> 01:46:21,351
to Wiki leaks,

3337
01:46:21,351 --> 01:46:21,561
right?

3338
01:46:21,561 --> 01:46:23,420
You can't donate to wikileaks was pay pal.

3339
01:46:23,421 --> 01:46:25,400
You can't donate to wikileaks with visa.

3340
01:46:25,730 --> 01:46:27,040
They ban you from doing that.

3341
01:46:27,041 --> 01:46:29,450
And that's how they've cut off
the funding of that organization.

3342
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:32,030
Yet at the same time on some
of those payment networks,

3343
01:46:32,031 --> 01:46:33,860
you could donate to the Ku Klux Klan.

3344
01:46:34,370 --> 01:46:34,521
Now,

3345
01:46:34,521 --> 01:46:38,390
that doesn't represent my principals
and I have a big problem with that.

3346
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:39,230
Well,

3347
01:46:39,230 --> 01:46:43,610
with bitcoins you can because you
simply can't donate to whoever you want.

3348
01:46:43,611 --> 01:46:45,380
You can just send Bitcoin to any address.

3349
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:46,760
And as a result,

3350
01:46:47,090 --> 01:46:47,800
um,

3351
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:48,120
you know,

3352
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:50,430
wikileaks has seen rise in the donations

3353
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:51,250
they receive,

3354
01:46:51,250 --> 01:46:51,480
uh,

3355
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:52,313
through bitcoin.

3356
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:54,360
But a lot of other organizations too,

3357
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:54,751
it's,

3358
01:46:54,751 --> 01:46:55,081
it's,

3359
01:46:55,081 --> 01:46:56,460
there's a lot of charitable giving.

3360
01:46:56,461 --> 01:46:59,200
There's a lot of nonprofit
organizations using bit coin.

3361
01:46:59,810 --> 01:47:01,490
This is a fascinating time.

3362
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:02,750
I mean,

3363
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:04,370
how many other Bitcoin,

3364
01:47:04,371 --> 01:47:06,260
like alternatives are available.

3365
01:47:06,261 --> 01:47:09,080
And do you feel that those
are competition for big,

3366
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:12,170
for Bitcoin or they just
as valid as bitcoin?

3367
01:47:12,440 --> 01:47:14,930
Is there room for a bunch
of cryptocurrencies?

3368
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:15,651
What's the,

3369
01:47:15,651 --> 01:47:16,850
what's the attitude about that?

3370
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:19,320
That's a great question because we,

3371
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:19,680
uh,

3372
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,401
generally speaking,

3373
01:47:20,401 --> 01:47:23,610
the term for alternative
currencies is altcoins.

3374
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:24,091
Uh,

3375
01:47:24,091 --> 01:47:25,950
some of them are alternative,

3376
01:47:25,951 --> 01:47:27,120
some of them are,

3377
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:27,720
uh,

3378
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:29,370
more competitive with bitcoin.

3379
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:32,190
All of them are based
on the same invention.

3380
01:47:32,370 --> 01:47:36,390
So what this shows is that the underlying
invention of how to do computational

3381
01:47:36,391 --> 01:47:40,500
agreement on the network that invention
has spawned all of these other

3382
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:41,753
currencies.

3383
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:42,241
Uh,

3384
01:47:42,241 --> 01:47:43,680
some of them are very innovative,

3385
01:47:43,681 --> 01:47:48,681
some of them are just fads and memes and
some of them are pump and dump schemes.

3386
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:50,250
So there's a whole range.

3387
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:55,560
One of the interesting things that this
has created is that in the past money

3388
01:47:55,561 --> 01:47:59,850
was trusted and had value because
not many people could create it.

3389
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:03,420
And so we trust governments
to create money.

3390
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:08,840
And money has value because
only governments can create
money now because anyone

3391
01:48:09,331 --> 01:48:10,350
can create money.

3392
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:13,410
How you give it value
depends on other things,

3393
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:16,890
which is actually a good lesson because
government money doesn't really have

3394
01:48:16,891 --> 01:48:18,720
that much value in a lot of places either.

3395
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:22,050
It's just an illusion that
somehow that makes it valuable.

3396
01:48:22,510 --> 01:48:24,270
In the case of Bitcoin,

3397
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:28,410
what makes bitcoin valuable is the
enormous amounts of investment.

3398
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:29,040
Uh,

3399
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:31,950
both in terms of resources,

3400
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:36,090
in terms of the computing equipment
that people have bought in terms of the

3401
01:48:36,091 --> 01:48:38,550
invested companies that are in
it and the people who work in it.

3402
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:39,420
Um,

3403
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:43,020
other coins have slightly different
variations of the same theme.

3404
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:44,040
Um,

3405
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:46,170
and some of them are based on memes,

3406
01:48:46,171 --> 01:48:47,004
Internet memes.

3407
01:48:47,310 --> 01:48:48,000
But here's,

3408
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:53,000
I see a future where a five year old at
school could use a web browser to build

3409
01:48:54,481 --> 01:48:58,230
a coin in an afternoon and
launch it among their friends.

3410
01:48:58,440 --> 01:48:59,850
So will there be more coins?

3411
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:00,210
Yes,

3412
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:01,650
tens of thousands of them.

3413
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:02,641
And we'll,

3414
01:49:02,641 --> 01:49:03,660
those coins have value.

3415
01:49:03,661 --> 01:49:04,470
Probably not,

3416
01:49:04,470 --> 01:49:08,280
no more than baseball cards
or Pokemon or a Tamagotchi.

3417
01:49:08,281 --> 01:49:12,090
But within an environment
and with young people,

3418
01:49:12,330 --> 01:49:13,650
you're going to have,

3419
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:19,220
you're going to have people who create
them for trading purposes and as memes

3420
01:49:19,221 --> 01:49:19,590
and,

3421
01:49:19,590 --> 01:49:20,423
and fats.

3422
01:49:20,730 --> 01:49:22,940
And so they'll have a
certain kind of value,

3423
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:24,240
just not monetary value.

3424
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:28,410
So you have to evaluate which coins have
monetary value based on what's running

3425
01:49:28,411 --> 01:49:29,040
behind them.

3426
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:29,430
You know,

3427
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:33,330
the bitcoin economy has an actual
economy behind it has merchants,

3428
01:49:33,331 --> 01:49:34,650
it has retail transactions,

3429
01:49:34,651 --> 01:49:36,470
it has a startup,

3430
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,580
companies that are investing
in developing things with it.

3431
01:49:39,210 --> 01:49:41,490
Some of these other coins
have some of those things.

3432
01:49:41,491 --> 01:49:42,900
Some of them have none of those things.

3433
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:47,530
But is there a risk of bitcoin being
like the myspace of cryptocurrencies when

3434
01:49:47,531 --> 01:49:47,980
you get off to

3435
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,900
his big headstart and you're
way ahead of the game,

3436
01:49:49,901 --> 01:49:52,150
but there's holes in your game and right?

3437
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:54,430
Facebook comes in and
steals all your people.

3438
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:59,780
So one thing to realize is that money
is a lot more sticky than a social site.

3439
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:00,560
Um,

3440
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:04,790
and when people invest their skills and
expertise and companies into a certain

3441
01:50:04,791 --> 01:50:05,600
cryptocurrency,

3442
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:06,800
that carries a lot of weight.

3443
01:50:06,801 --> 01:50:10,850
So bitcoin has already achieved a
very high level of network effect,

3444
01:50:10,851 --> 01:50:12,410
which means that the
more people are on it,

3445
01:50:12,411 --> 01:50:13,790
the more people that attracts,

3446
01:50:13,791 --> 01:50:14,630
the more people that are on it,

3447
01:50:14,631 --> 01:50:15,920
the more people that attracts.

3448
01:50:15,950 --> 01:50:16,880
But at the same time,

3449
01:50:17,150 --> 01:50:19,730
because it's building a
capital base that makes it,

3450
01:50:19,790 --> 01:50:22,250
that makes it very
difficult to unseat bitcoin.

3451
01:50:22,730 --> 01:50:23,330
Um,

3452
01:50:23,330 --> 01:50:26,690
I think what we'll end up seeing is,

3453
01:50:27,170 --> 01:50:27,470
uh,

3454
01:50:27,470 --> 01:50:29,510
one or two major currencies.

3455
01:50:29,511 --> 01:50:31,310
Bitcoin is probably
going to be the biggest,

3456
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:32,720
um,

3457
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:37,490
and then two or three or four or five
secondary currencies that do some kind of

3458
01:50:37,491 --> 01:50:39,980
niche thing that's useful for some group,

3459
01:50:40,370 --> 01:50:41,000
um,

3460
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:44,480
that bitcoin can't do a won't do
because it sounds like for example,

3461
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:49,740
a bitcoin has reverse inflation
deflation because there's a fixed supply.

3462
01:50:49,850 --> 01:50:52,580
So over time the value is
gradually going to increase,

3463
01:50:52,700 --> 01:50:53,480
right?

3464
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:53,960
Um,

3465
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:56,360
other people have created coins
where if you don't spend them,

3466
01:50:56,361 --> 01:50:57,140
you lose a bit,

3467
01:50:57,140 --> 01:50:58,910
which is like inflation.

3468
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:02,360
So bitcoin is not going to be
able to copy that and take,

3469
01:51:02,600 --> 01:51:03,530
take that feature and say,

3470
01:51:03,531 --> 01:51:03,681
Hey,

3471
01:51:03,681 --> 01:51:04,221
that looks good,

3472
01:51:04,221 --> 01:51:05,054
let's do it too.

3473
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:07,190
But for a lot of other things,

3474
01:51:07,191 --> 01:51:07,520
when an,

3475
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,560
when an alternative coin
invents something new,

3476
01:51:09,561 --> 01:51:14,510
bitcoin can simply pick it up and run
with it to a big coin hasn't stopped

3477
01:51:14,511 --> 01:51:15,344
moving.

3478
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:19,490
It was invented in 2008 and five years
of innovation have gone into it and the

3479
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,110
level of innovation is accelerating.

3480
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:25,910
So I think there's a lot of room for a
lot of coins in this space and not all of

3481
01:51:25,911 --> 01:51:26,721
them are going to have value,

3482
01:51:26,721 --> 01:51:28,100
but some of them will have value.

3483
01:51:29,330 --> 01:51:31,820
So are there any that stand down?

3484
01:51:31,821 --> 01:51:33,650
I know Doge Coin Dog,

3485
01:51:33,660 --> 01:51:35,890
he coin is one that keeps
getting brought up to me to,

3486
01:51:35,891 --> 01:51:37,400
to talk to you about on the Internet.

3487
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:39,680
What about Kanye West's coin?

3488
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:40,550
You know,

3489
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:41,810
Kanye West has a coin,

3490
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:46,640
so I think there are a few coins that
have interesting characteristics.

3491
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:47,653
Um,

3492
01:51:48,130 --> 01:51:48,561
you know,

3493
01:51:48,561 --> 01:51:49,730
they implement new features,

3494
01:51:49,731 --> 01:51:53,300
they do things slightly better or slightly
different in some ways than bitcoin.

3495
01:51:53,350 --> 01:51:53,870
So what,

3496
01:51:53,870 --> 01:51:54,290
like what,

3497
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:55,123
what do they do better?

3498
01:51:55,460 --> 01:51:55,820
Um,

3499
01:51:55,820 --> 01:51:57,050
well for example,

3500
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:57,913
um,

3501
01:51:57,980 --> 01:52:00,170
one example is a light coin.

3502
01:52:00,230 --> 01:52:03,440
And what light coin does is
it has a different way of,

3503
01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:05,270
of having the agreement on the network,

3504
01:52:05,271 --> 01:52:06,020
which is,

3505
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:08,870
which requires more memory
on your computer in less CPU.

3506
01:52:08,871 --> 01:52:09,830
So that makes it,

3507
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:10,580
um,

3508
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:12,800
more level at the same time.

3509
01:52:12,860 --> 01:52:13,280
Uh,

3510
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:15,920
it does transactions that
are on a different pace.

3511
01:52:15,921 --> 01:52:17,360
So instead of every 10 minutes,

3512
01:52:17,361 --> 01:52:18,150
it does,

3513
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:18,410
um,

3514
01:52:18,410 --> 01:52:18,651
you know,

3515
01:52:18,651 --> 01:52:19,940
fewer minutes for per block.

3516
01:52:19,941 --> 01:52:20,721
I think it's two and a half,

3517
01:52:20,721 --> 01:52:22,880
and then you have a larger
number of total coin.

3518
01:52:22,881 --> 01:52:23,930
So it's a few tweaks.

3519
01:52:24,170 --> 01:52:25,910
The idea is if bitcoin is gold,

3520
01:52:25,911 --> 01:52:26,960
light coin is silver.

3521
01:52:27,380 --> 01:52:28,040
Um,

3522
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:30,530
but that's the general
competitive environments.

3523
01:52:30,531 --> 01:52:30,741
Now,

3524
01:52:30,741 --> 01:52:35,420
beyond that Doge coin is in
fact or dog coin or Doggy Coin,

3525
01:52:35,450 --> 01:52:35,840
whenever,

3526
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:38,420
I'm not quite sure how it's pronounced is,

3527
01:52:38,510 --> 01:52:41,180
is an enhancement on the original,

3528
01:52:41,210 --> 01:52:42,043
um,

3529
01:52:42,170 --> 01:52:43,190
idea of light coin.

3530
01:52:43,191 --> 01:52:44,840
So it took that and then twisted it a bit.

3531
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,950
And then you've got this whole
list of other coins that,

3532
01:52:48,290 --> 01:52:48,950
um,

3533
01:52:48,950 --> 01:52:50,000
some of them are interesting.

3534
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:52,130
One discovers prime numbers,

3535
01:52:52,131 --> 01:52:56,060
which are useful in mathematics and the
other one uses a different peer to peer

3536
01:52:56,061 --> 01:52:56,840
system.

3537
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:57,680
Um,

3538
01:52:57,770 --> 01:52:59,330
another one is more programmable.

3539
01:52:59,331 --> 01:53:00,950
One of the new coins that's come out now,

3540
01:53:00,951 --> 01:53:05,951
ethereum allows each transaction to be
a full code for programming language.

3541
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:08,630
Um,

3542
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:08,901
you know,

3543
01:53:08,901 --> 01:53:12,020
all of these may have interesting
characteristics and then,

3544
01:53:12,260 --> 01:53:12,620
you know,

3545
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:13,700
Kanye West coin,

3546
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:13,970
you know,

3547
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:14,490
whatever,

3548
01:53:14,490 --> 01:53:15,440
and hey man,

3549
01:53:15,441 --> 01:53:15,671
dumped,

3550
01:53:15,671 --> 01:53:16,221
dismiss it.

3551
01:53:16,221 --> 01:53:16,401
No,

3552
01:53:16,401 --> 01:53:17,031
I mean it's great.

3553
01:53:17,031 --> 01:53:17,864
It comes to goal first.

3554
01:53:17,990 --> 01:53:18,411
First of all,

3555
01:53:18,411 --> 01:53:19,490
they got sued I think,

3556
01:53:19,491 --> 01:53:23,480
or they got cease and desists because
they had nothing to do with him.

3557
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:24,710
Um,

3558
01:53:24,710 --> 01:53:28,940
but one of the interesting things is that
we don't know if one of these catches

3559
01:53:28,941 --> 01:53:29,774
on,

3560
01:53:30,230 --> 01:53:35,000
who knows why not a lot of things in life
started as a joke and then became huge

3561
01:53:35,001 --> 01:53:37,100
things that became
embedded in the culture.

3562
01:53:37,730 --> 01:53:38,563
So what,

3563
01:53:38,710 --> 01:53:39,670
let me ask you this.

3564
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:42,730
What about these massive
fluctuations in value,

3565
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:44,200
like day to day,

3566
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:44,670
right?

3567
01:53:44,670 --> 01:53:46,510
In intense fluctuations?

3568
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:46,900
Yes.

3569
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:49,570
Very disconcerting to people that
are looking for a stable investment.

3570
01:53:49,571 --> 01:53:50,760
When you see what are the,

3571
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:51,370
I mean,

3572
01:53:51,370 --> 01:53:52,390
several hundred percent,

3573
01:53:52,391 --> 01:53:52,571
right?

3574
01:53:52,571 --> 01:53:55,570
What is the worst day or the
best day as far as the variation?

3575
01:53:56,130 --> 01:54:00,220
So I think the best day was a was
maybe two and a half years ago,

3576
01:54:00,610 --> 01:54:05,020
which was a minus minus
40 minus 50% in a day.

3577
01:54:05,410 --> 01:54:10,410
That was a really big crash and it took
it to from above 32 below a dollar.

3578
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:12,823
Um,

3579
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:16,990
and then there was another crash around
a hundred and then there was another one

3580
01:54:16,991 --> 01:54:20,140
around to 66 and then there was
another one around the thousand.

3581
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:24,190
And so we're now kind of in
a relatively stable band,

3582
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:24,820
uh,

3583
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:27,130
between 800 900,

3584
01:54:27,131 --> 01:54:27,850
somewhere there.

3585
01:54:27,850 --> 01:54:28,101
Okay.

3586
01:54:28,101 --> 01:54:28,600
Explain.

3587
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:33,600
But here's the point over time is
these little hiccups get narrower and

3588
01:54:34,871 --> 01:54:35,320
narrower.

3589
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:36,580
And here's why they occur.

3590
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:37,940
If you look at the bitcoin,

3591
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:39,760
the total market capitalization,

3592
01:54:39,761 --> 01:54:42,880
if you take all of the bitcoins that exist
times the value that they have on the

3593
01:54:42,881 --> 01:54:43,714
market today,

3594
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,490
it's about a $10 billion market,

3595
01:54:45,850 --> 01:54:46,480
right?

3596
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:48,400
$10 billion market might sound like a lot,

3597
01:54:48,940 --> 01:54:49,211
you know,

3598
01:54:49,211 --> 01:54:50,470
certainly if it was a tech stock,

3599
01:54:50,471 --> 01:54:52,180
it would be a nice size tech stock.

3600
01:54:52,480 --> 01:54:53,860
But as a currency is puny,

3601
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:54,281
you know,

3602
01:54:54,281 --> 01:54:58,240
there are hundreds of countries that
have bigger monetary base for that

3603
01:54:58,270 --> 01:54:58,550
currency.

3604
01:54:58,550 --> 01:55:00,100
And this is an international currency.

3605
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:00,993
It's small.

3606
01:55:01,090 --> 01:55:04,890
So what happens is this
is a shallow pool of,

3607
01:55:05,040 --> 01:55:05,890
of uh,

3608
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:06,813
liquidity.

3609
01:55:06,940 --> 01:55:10,990
And when you have a shallow
pool of liquidity like this
with a few markets that

3610
01:55:10,991 --> 01:55:12,100
are not very efficient,

3611
01:55:12,130 --> 01:55:14,470
the end result is that
every time someone sneezes,

3612
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:18,160
all of the liquidity sloshes around
and you get these fluctuations,

3613
01:55:18,550 --> 01:55:20,470
but as it gets bigger in size,

3614
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:21,760
the waves get smaller,

3615
01:55:21,790 --> 01:55:22,623
right?

3616
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:25,330
So it's not as volatile.

3617
01:55:25,331 --> 01:55:26,320
And if you look at it,

3618
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:26,710
uh,

3619
01:55:26,710 --> 01:55:29,230
if you plotted on a graph
and you plot the volatility,

3620
01:55:29,231 --> 01:55:32,620
you'll see that every year it's getting
less and less and less and less and less

3621
01:55:32,621 --> 01:55:33,400
volatile.

3622
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:33,790
Now,

3623
01:55:33,790 --> 01:55:35,980
if at some point it became large,

3624
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:36,551
you know,

3625
01:55:36,551 --> 01:55:40,660
the reason currencies like the u s
dollar on it are not very volatile,

3626
01:55:40,930 --> 01:55:45,150
is because if you think of a $14
trillion economy is like a titanic,

3627
01:55:45,151 --> 01:55:45,984
it takes,

3628
01:55:46,050 --> 01:55:46,530
you know,

3629
01:55:46,530 --> 01:55:49,050
three miles to turn 10 degrees,

3630
01:55:49,170 --> 01:55:50,003
right?

3631
01:55:50,250 --> 01:55:54,900
So they're much more stable because they
have weight behind them and inertia.

3632
01:55:55,140 --> 01:55:56,370
And even if you want to change it,

3633
01:55:56,371 --> 01:55:59,550
you tweak something now and it changes
in six months because it takes time to

3634
01:55:59,551 --> 01:56:00,540
filter through the economy.

3635
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:02,003
Meanwhile,

3636
01:56:02,070 --> 01:56:04,500
think of Bitcoin is like
a little Zodiac boat,

3637
01:56:04,530 --> 01:56:07,500
makes the titanic bouncing
up and down the waves,

3638
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:08,633
very nimble,

3639
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:13,970
both volatile over time as it gets
bigger than the waves get smaller by

3640
01:56:14,251 --> 01:56:14,730
comparison.

3641
01:56:14,730 --> 01:56:15,030
Okay,

3642
01:56:15,030 --> 01:56:20,030
what is the cause of these fluctuations
to a financial dunce like myself?

3643
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:20,770
What,

3644
01:56:20,770 --> 01:56:21,511
what causes?

3645
01:56:21,511 --> 01:56:25,190
Like how can it be worth x amount
and then half that in the case.

3646
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:29,670
So let me start by answering the implicit
question of how does it get its value?

3647
01:56:29,671 --> 01:56:30,600
Who sets the price?

3648
01:56:30,630 --> 01:56:30,960
Okay,

3649
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:32,730
so it's a free market.

3650
01:56:33,050 --> 01:56:33,611
Uh,

3651
01:56:33,611 --> 01:56:38,611
and so if you go and try to buy bitcoin
online at the moment and you say,

3652
01:56:39,090 --> 01:56:40,830
I'm going to pay 800 for it,

3653
01:56:40,831 --> 01:56:42,000
and someone says yes,

3654
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:47,540
and then during the day the vast volume
of people are buying and selling for

3655
01:56:47,791 --> 01:56:49,410
around a hundred $800.

3656
01:56:49,410 --> 01:56:49,711
Great.

3657
01:56:49,711 --> 01:56:50,880
That's the price of bitcoin.

3658
01:56:50,881 --> 01:56:53,910
It's whatever people are
paying to buy and sell bitcoin.

3659
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:56,310
And so every time the order changes,

3660
01:56:56,610 --> 01:56:57,210
you know,

3661
01:56:57,210 --> 01:57:00,450
if suddenly you can't find anyone
to buy your bitcoin at 800,

3662
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:03,570
you're going to discount it a bit and
discount until you find someone who's

3663
01:57:03,571 --> 01:57:04,320
going to buy it.

3664
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:05,670
And then that's the new price.

3665
01:57:06,030 --> 01:57:07,320
So it will go down a bit.

3666
01:57:07,410 --> 01:57:11,730
But if you are finding people
easily to buy your bitcoin,

3667
01:57:11,731 --> 01:57:13,020
then you increase the price of it.

3668
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:14,100
So it goes up a bit.

3669
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:15,330
Just like the stock market.

3670
01:57:15,331 --> 01:57:16,590
Who sets the price of IBM?

3671
01:57:16,650 --> 01:57:17,483
No one,

3672
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:21,390
it's whatever the last
deal was on IBM stock.

3673
01:57:21,450 --> 01:57:21,991
So,

3674
01:57:21,991 --> 01:57:22,260
uh,

3675
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:26,580
how's that not make it vulnerable for
the same pump and dump issues that you're

3676
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:29,070
experiencing with all these
other cryptocurrencies?

3677
01:57:29,730 --> 01:57:29,941
Well,

3678
01:57:29,941 --> 01:57:30,181
it,

3679
01:57:30,181 --> 01:57:30,571
it's,

3680
01:57:30,571 --> 01:57:31,860
it does make it vulnerable,

3681
01:57:31,861 --> 01:57:34,560
but the point is there's still
a fixed amount of bitcoin.

3682
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:38,340
So right now that small
fixed amount of bitcoin with,

3683
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:38,670
you know,

3684
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:43,670
very big changes of media news piece
comes out and it's like Chinese people are

3685
01:57:44,341 --> 01:57:45,750
buying bitcoin woo.

3686
01:57:45,751 --> 01:57:46,351
And it goes,

3687
01:57:46,351 --> 01:57:46,651
you know,

3688
01:57:46,651 --> 01:57:47,490
really high.

3689
01:57:47,491 --> 01:57:48,840
Everybody gets really excited.

3690
01:57:48,841 --> 01:57:49,171
This is,

3691
01:57:49,171 --> 01:57:50,280
it is breaking through.

3692
01:57:50,281 --> 01:57:51,061
Then the next week,

3693
01:57:51,061 --> 01:57:54,090
Central Bank of China won't
let banks hold bitcoin down.

3694
01:57:54,091 --> 01:57:54,571
We go,

3695
01:57:54,571 --> 01:57:55,404
you know,

3696
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:58,680
every piece of good news
pushes the price up.

3697
01:57:58,740 --> 01:58:02,310
Suddenly every piece of bad
news knocks it down suddenly,

3698
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:07,260
but it seems like really manipulative
financial experts would be able to move it

3699
01:58:07,261 --> 01:58:10,560
left and right to their whim
in order to profit off of it.

3700
01:58:10,850 --> 01:58:11,140
Yeah,

3701
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:12,840
on this probably a bit of that going on,

3702
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:19,020
but I can tell you that there is a lot
more of that going on in every other

3703
01:58:19,021 --> 01:58:19,381
market.

3704
01:58:19,381 --> 01:58:20,630
So that's the interesting thing here.

3705
01:58:20,910 --> 01:58:22,390
We now know that Libor,

3706
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:26,370
the interest rates in the Lenten than
bank system has been fixed for years and

3707
01:58:26,371 --> 01:58:27,870
that's the basis for most interest rates.

3708
01:58:27,870 --> 01:58:29,280
We know that the gold markets fixed,

3709
01:58:29,281 --> 01:58:30,450
we know that the stock markets,

3710
01:58:30,451 --> 01:58:33,390
they're doing front running on
high frequency transactions,

3711
01:58:33,391 --> 01:58:34,224
those are fixed.

3712
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:39,180
Every single market out there is
currently rigged and so the people who are

3713
01:58:39,181 --> 01:58:43,510
playing within these markets with like
fiber optic connections to this main data

3714
01:58:43,511 --> 01:58:44,290
center,

3715
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:44,621
you know,

3716
01:58:44,621 --> 01:58:49,150
and they're three feet closer than the
other server and can get that transaction

3717
01:58:49,151 --> 01:58:50,770
in four nanosecond sooner.

3718
01:58:51,250 --> 01:58:54,550
Our front running
transactions are benefiting,

3719
01:58:54,551 --> 01:58:57,640
are profiting from that distance
and these markets are rigged.

3720
01:58:57,641 --> 01:58:57,791
You know,

3721
01:58:57,791 --> 01:59:00,520
you go in with you a little brokerage
accounts and you trade some IBM and you

3722
01:59:00,521 --> 01:59:01,600
think you're playing the game,

3723
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:03,161
right?

3724
01:59:03,161 --> 01:59:05,920
You're the dunce in the room cause you
don't know who the dunce and the room is.

3725
01:59:06,010 --> 01:59:08,920
What you're talking about with automated
transfers like that where you're

3726
01:59:08,921 --> 01:59:09,920
dealing with Nano sock,

3727
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:12,460
high frequency trading as it's
called their algorithmic trading.

3728
01:59:12,490 --> 01:59:13,780
Unbelievably fascinating stuff.

3729
01:59:13,781 --> 01:59:14,200
Yes.

3730
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:19,200
I mean literally they have racks trying
to get closer to the rack where the

3731
01:59:19,241 --> 01:59:22,690
transactions are happening
until data centers had to say,

3732
01:59:22,810 --> 01:59:24,070
no matter where you are in the room,

3733
01:59:24,071 --> 01:59:27,850
you're getting 300 feet of fiber and if
it's coiled at the bottom of your rack

3734
01:59:27,851 --> 01:59:28,870
or if it's stretched out,

3735
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:33,280
since you're still going to have to go
soon so that everybody gets the same

3736
01:59:33,281 --> 01:59:33,521
deal.

3737
01:59:33,521 --> 01:59:34,241
But right now,

3738
01:59:34,241 --> 01:59:35,074
for example,

3739
01:59:35,310 --> 01:59:35,790
uh,

3740
01:59:35,790 --> 01:59:37,180
all of the banks are playing this game.

3741
01:59:37,181 --> 01:59:39,130
How can fast can you do a transaction?

3742
01:59:39,131 --> 01:59:40,900
So what I'm saying is yes,

3743
01:59:40,901 --> 01:59:43,330
there is manipulation
in the bitcoin market,

3744
01:59:43,331 --> 01:59:46,510
but the manipulation is on the stock,

3745
01:59:46,511 --> 01:59:48,110
on the exchange rates,

3746
01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:50,500
is that that happens
on a day to day basis,

3747
01:59:50,860 --> 01:59:52,480
but it's not on the supply of money.

3748
01:59:52,570 --> 01:59:54,730
Whereas in the real economy,

3749
01:59:54,731 --> 01:59:55,720
the stock market,

3750
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:57,220
the New York stock has changed.

3751
01:59:57,220 --> 01:59:58,690
Not only is the market rigged,

3752
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:00,940
and not only is the
market been manipulated,

3753
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:03,580
but the currency itself is
rigged and being manipulated.

3754
02:00:03,581 --> 02:00:06,280
The Fed is printing money
and handing it to the banks.

3755
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:08,290
So the lesser of two evils,

3756
02:00:08,530 --> 02:00:10,480
it's definitely the
lesser of the two evils.

3757
02:00:10,481 --> 02:00:12,400
And also the larger it gets,

3758
02:00:12,401 --> 02:00:14,770
the harder it is for
outsiders to manipulated,

3759
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:16,173
right?

3760
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:18,580
Because they don't control the
levers of power of the currency.

3761
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,080
There are no leavers,

3762
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:21,580
and that's the beauty of it.

3763
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,940
So you create a system that doesn't
have leavers to control the currency.

3764
02:00:24,941 --> 02:00:27,520
So all they can control is
the price and manipulated.

3765
02:00:27,550 --> 02:00:31,660
But that's a dangerous game to play
long term because if the market turns

3766
02:00:31,661 --> 02:00:32,041
against you,

3767
02:00:32,041 --> 02:00:33,130
you lose a lot of money too.

3768
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:37,750
So it's currently worth how much is
a bitcoin worth in American dollars?

3769
02:00:38,050 --> 02:00:38,291
Um,

3770
02:00:38,291 --> 02:00:42,610
so one place to look up is bitcoin
average.com and that shows you the average

3771
02:00:42,611 --> 02:00:45,460
across dozens of exchanges
all around the world.

3772
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:48,160
At the moment it's a 700,

3773
02:00:48,370 --> 02:00:53,370
hang on one bitcoin is 784 US
dollars on average at the moment.

3774
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:58,360
And that's fairly stable cause you
were talking about it at 800 before.

3775
02:00:58,361 --> 02:01:01,510
So it's pretty close for the last
month it's been in that band.

3776
02:01:02,370 --> 02:01:02,860
Um,

3777
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:04,330
we have seen some wild swings,

3778
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:07,000
but it seems to be stabilized
around that level now,

3779
02:01:07,030 --> 02:01:11,170
which by the way is three times the
level it had stabilized before the big

3780
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:16,330
bounce and how much bitcoin is actually
available out there in the world.

3781
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:18,820
So I'd have to look that up.

3782
02:01:18,821 --> 02:01:22,750
I would say about 11 million
or so have been created so far.

3783
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:25,780
And there's a constant creation
of these every 10 minutes,

3784
02:01:25,781 --> 02:01:30,400
25 and this constant creation will
eventually not just level off,

3785
02:01:30,401 --> 02:01:31,510
but one day stop.

3786
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:32,583
Yes.

3787
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:33,970
Now what happens then?

3788
02:01:35,200 --> 02:01:35,800
Well,

3789
02:01:35,800 --> 02:01:36,730
the thing is it,

3790
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:37,240
it's,

3791
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:39,770
it starts operating more
like a precious metal,

3792
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:41,240
which is that,

3793
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:41,601
you know,

3794
02:01:41,601 --> 02:01:44,480
once supply of a precious
metal gets restricted,

3795
02:01:44,481 --> 02:01:45,740
it increases in value.

3796
02:01:46,190 --> 02:01:48,230
But the one difference
is that a precious metal,

3797
02:01:48,231 --> 02:01:49,580
you can only shave so thin,

3798
02:01:49,581 --> 02:01:52,760
you can't cut it into smaller units and
it's difficult to transport and all of

3799
02:01:52,761 --> 02:01:53,001
that.

3800
02:01:53,001 --> 02:01:53,600
Where's Bitcoin?

3801
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:56,300
You can divide it into
100 million sub units.

3802
02:01:56,870 --> 02:02:01,870
So basically instead of the money in your
pocket losing value over time because

3803
02:02:02,691 --> 02:02:04,490
the central government is diluting it,

3804
02:02:04,970 --> 02:02:08,510
it's getting concentrated because
more people want to use it,

3805
02:02:08,511 --> 02:02:09,800
then there's not enough around.

3806
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:13,820
So it gains value in your pocket
and that's a deflationary currency.

3807
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:14,691
Uh,

3808
02:02:14,691 --> 02:02:16,940
it creates some interesting
savings opportunities.

3809
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:19,400
Where do you see this going?

3810
02:02:19,610 --> 02:02:19,960
How,

3811
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:20,600
how,

3812
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:21,171
where do you,

3813
02:02:21,171 --> 02:02:23,390
what do you see like the future
and a hundred years from now,

3814
02:02:23,480 --> 02:02:23,840
what do you,

3815
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:26,750
what do you think bitcoin's place
in the world is going to be?

3816
02:02:27,710 --> 02:02:29,960
I think I can make certain
predictions for sure.

3817
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:34,730
And I can make other predictions
with absolute 90% margin,

3818
02:02:34,940 --> 02:02:36,800
which means I'm pulling it out of my ass.

3819
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:38,930
So let me tell you one
I can make for sure.

3820
02:02:39,530 --> 02:02:43,670
Cryptocurrencies will be part
of our financial future period.

3821
02:02:43,970 --> 02:02:45,650
Doesn't matter what form they take.

3822
02:02:45,950 --> 02:02:47,720
This invention has been invented.

3823
02:02:47,750 --> 02:02:49,190
It will change finance,

3824
02:02:49,250 --> 02:02:50,570
it will change banking.

3825
02:02:51,110 --> 02:02:51,441
Uh,

3826
02:02:51,441 --> 02:02:52,880
and it might not be bitcoin.

3827
02:02:52,940 --> 02:02:53,690
I think it will,

3828
02:02:53,690 --> 02:02:55,160
but it might not be bitcoin,

3829
02:02:55,190 --> 02:02:57,010
but it will still be a cryptocurrency.

3830
02:02:57,070 --> 02:03:01,700
The idea of having a mathematical currency
based on a distributed peer to peer

3831
02:03:01,701 --> 02:03:03,590
network happened.

3832
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:05,270
The invention happens.

3833
02:03:05,271 --> 02:03:08,090
You can't stop people from
coming up with variations on it.

3834
02:03:08,450 --> 02:03:11,900
You can't easily shut it
down if you shot down 100,

3835
02:03:11,901 --> 02:03:13,520
others are going to pop up in its place.

3836
02:03:13,970 --> 02:03:14,840
Now at the same time,

3837
02:03:14,841 --> 02:03:19,040
I think bitcoin has a very good chance
of being the one that was good enough.

3838
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:24,100
The grew fast enough and gained enough
traction that it will actually have,

3839
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:25,430
uh,

3840
02:03:25,430 --> 02:03:27,920
as a store of value value
for a very long time.

3841
02:03:28,340 --> 02:03:28,551
Now,

3842
02:03:28,551 --> 02:03:31,760
didn't someone sell a house
and Canada through Bitcoin?

3843
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:35,810
We've seen transactions as big
as $150 million by the way.

3844
02:03:35,811 --> 02:03:37,040
Guess what the fee was?

3845
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:37,880
What?

3846
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:39,380
Zero whoa.

3847
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:44,360
Hundred and 50 million transferred
in seconds for zero fee.

3848
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:44,930
Whoa.

3849
02:03:44,930 --> 02:03:45,401
Who?

3850
02:03:45,401 --> 02:03:47,630
Who got $150 million in Bitcoin?

3851
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:48,411
Justin Bieber.

3852
02:03:48,411 --> 02:03:48,921
That crazy.

3853
02:03:48,921 --> 02:03:51,440
Fuck who's who did that?

3854
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:52,430
Were they drunk?

3855
02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:53,263
We have no idea.

3856
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:53,661
Oh,

3857
02:03:53,661 --> 02:03:54,710
they must have been drunk as well.

3858
02:03:54,900 --> 02:03:54,991
No,

3859
02:03:54,991 --> 02:03:55,141
no.

3860
02:03:55,141 --> 02:03:55,381
I mean,

3861
02:03:55,381 --> 02:03:56,214
you see,

3862
02:03:57,750 --> 02:03:58,680
look at the text messages.

3863
02:03:58,681 --> 02:04:00,750
You mean when you were drunk and
then look at your bitcoin folder.

3864
02:04:00,751 --> 02:04:04,830
I did what you think you would know if
somebody spent that much money using

3865
02:04:04,831 --> 02:04:05,700
bitcoin because they would,

3866
02:04:05,940 --> 02:04:06,690
you know,

3867
02:04:06,690 --> 02:04:08,400
as a bitcoin user would probably scream,

3868
02:04:08,401 --> 02:04:10,110
I just spend on one point $5 million.

3869
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:14,370
That's why it's so weird for me to think
that like the the guy that created it,

3870
02:04:14,430 --> 02:04:15,660
no one knows is what he looks like.

3871
02:04:15,690 --> 02:04:16,171
Some guys,

3872
02:04:16,171 --> 02:04:18,810
he spent one point $5 million
but no one knows who this guy.

3873
02:04:18,811 --> 02:04:20,390
It just seems so weirdly.

3874
02:04:20,410 --> 02:04:20,941
Here's the thing,

3875
02:04:20,941 --> 02:04:23,340
you don't know what's happening
in the banking system today.

3876
02:04:23,341 --> 02:04:25,590
People are sending
billions of dollars around,

3877
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:26,940
but for bitcoin users,

3878
02:04:26,970 --> 02:04:27,300
they're all,

3879
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:29,460
it's almost like buying a cell
phone in your advertising.

3880
02:04:29,461 --> 02:04:31,140
Like this is the best cell phone ever.

3881
02:04:31,150 --> 02:04:31,921
I love it.

3882
02:04:31,921 --> 02:04:35,310
You know that your cell phone sucks cause
they are almost the most vocal about

3883
02:04:35,311 --> 02:04:38,560
using bit coin that you would think
somebody going to spend 1.5 would,

3884
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:40,830
would immediately go to online.

3885
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:42,050
What do you mean?

3886
02:04:42,050 --> 02:04:42,430
Hold on,

3887
02:04:42,430 --> 02:04:44,920
I'll tell the world I have all this money.

3888
02:04:45,940 --> 02:04:47,470
That's a dangerous thing to say.

3889
02:04:47,530 --> 02:04:48,130
Why would you,

3890
02:04:48,130 --> 02:04:50,710
why would you think that that's what
they would do and if they didn't do that

3891
02:04:50,711 --> 02:04:51,400
they wouldn't,

3892
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:52,233
it wouldn't be real.

3893
02:04:52,250 --> 02:04:53,360
No I didn't say it's not real.

3894
02:04:53,361 --> 02:04:57,050
It just says it seems so suspicious
that you know that there's so many.

3895
02:04:57,650 --> 02:04:59,300
See that my biggest
problem cause I've been,

3896
02:04:59,330 --> 02:05:01,610
people have been trying to get me to a
bitcoin for the longest time is things

3897
02:05:01,611 --> 02:05:02,630
like this where it's,

3898
02:05:02,680 --> 02:05:05,350
it just seems there's so
much mystery to it like that.

3899
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:07,640
Especially if you follow
the conspiracies of the,

3900
02:05:07,641 --> 02:05:08,780
the guy that created it.

3901
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:09,480
And if,

3902
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:12,070
and you know you hear reports
like somebody just spent,

3903
02:05:12,071 --> 02:05:15,010
well you know all these millions
of dollars using bit coin.

3904
02:05:15,150 --> 02:05:15,421
Yes.

3905
02:05:15,421 --> 02:05:15,961
I already said,

3906
02:05:15,961 --> 02:05:18,220
he said someone bought
one point $5 million,

3907
02:05:19,730 --> 02:05:23,070
transferred to $5 million transaction.

3908
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:27,120
There was a transaction from
one address to another address,

3909
02:05:27,121 --> 02:05:32,121
$450 million in a single transaction
who can keep in mind minute 150 million.

3910
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:33,113
Yes.

3911
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:35,040
And these happen every second.

3912
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:36,480
Not Not that big,

3913
02:05:36,481 --> 02:05:38,160
but transactions happen all the time.

3914
02:05:38,161 --> 02:05:38,881
And so as you,

3915
02:05:38,881 --> 02:05:40,680
if you were watching the
stream and transaction,

3916
02:05:40,681 --> 02:05:40,981
you're like,

3917
02:05:40,981 --> 02:05:41,490
you know,

3918
02:05:41,490 --> 02:05:45,930
$10 a thousand dollars
$500 $10,000 150 million.

3919
02:05:46,610 --> 02:05:47,101
And you're like,

3920
02:05:47,101 --> 02:05:47,934
what?

3921
02:05:47,970 --> 02:05:48,420
Well,

3922
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:51,210
and you can see that transaction
because it's on the public ledger.

3923
02:05:51,211 --> 02:05:54,600
And it did happen and it
has been firefight and the
transaction went through and

3924
02:05:54,601 --> 02:05:55,560
they paid zero fee.

3925
02:05:55,770 --> 02:05:59,580
So this hundred and $50 million
transaction was between two people.

3926
02:05:59,850 --> 02:06:01,060
It was between two addresses.

3927
02:06:01,061 --> 02:06:04,050
So it might've been person moving in
from one of their own accounts to one of

3928
02:06:04,051 --> 02:06:05,040
their own accounts or,

3929
02:06:05,070 --> 02:06:06,150
or given it someone else.

3930
02:06:06,210 --> 02:06:09,560
But it's still 150 million
American dollars worth of.

3931
02:06:09,561 --> 02:06:14,561
It was about (406) 140-5000 bitcoin
and bitcoin is worth $800 each.

3932
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:16,500
Yeah.

3933
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:18,210
So at the time it was almost a thousand.

3934
02:06:18,211 --> 02:06:19,044
So yeah,

3935
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:20,400
it's about 150 million.

3936
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:21,893
Wow.

3937
02:06:22,620 --> 02:06:24,360
Which in the big scheme of things,

3938
02:06:24,361 --> 02:06:24,811
by the way,

3939
02:06:24,811 --> 02:06:26,970
in the global monetary system is peanuts,

3940
02:06:27,090 --> 02:06:29,490
but it's not user though.

3941
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:31,620
If it's either an individual
you or if it's an a,

3942
02:06:31,621 --> 02:06:33,000
is it a corporation?

3943
02:06:33,320 --> 02:06:35,070
The corporation might be the government.

3944
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:35,280
Yep.

3945
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:36,930
When we seize the Silk Road,

3946
02:06:36,931 --> 02:06:37,450
the government,

3947
02:06:37,450 --> 02:06:38,230
meaning we,

3948
02:06:38,230 --> 02:06:38,561
uh,

3949
02:06:38,561 --> 02:06:39,394
Hu

3950
02:06:39,410 --> 02:06:40,243
government,

3951
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:42,170
the government keeps,

3952
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:44,310
keep kept that right there.

3953
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:45,021
They're actually,

3954
02:06:45,021 --> 02:06:45,800
um,

3955
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:48,950
I don't think they want to keep it
for too long and I'm not sure they,

3956
02:06:48,951 --> 02:06:50,930
they are allowed by law
to keep it for too long.

3957
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:53,810
So what they've announced they're going
to do is they're going to sell it.

3958
02:06:54,110 --> 02:06:55,400
They're going to sell Silk Road.

3959
02:06:55,830 --> 02:06:56,040
No,

3960
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:57,200
they're going to sell the bitcoins.

3961
02:06:57,201 --> 02:06:58,034
They seized

3962
02:06:59,810 --> 02:07:00,980
and they're going to sell them on the,

3963
02:07:00,981 --> 02:07:03,020
on some kind of market or auction,

3964
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:03,471
which is,

3965
02:07:03,471 --> 02:07:07,210
which is great because it's going
to create some discount treating.

3966
02:07:07,550 --> 02:07:11,990
That's funny because bitcoin was a key
player in that whole silk road scandal.

3967
02:07:11,991 --> 02:07:13,850
And for folks who don't
know what Silk Road was,

3968
02:07:14,180 --> 02:07:18,590
it was a website that allowed you to buy
a lot of illegal things online and some

3969
02:07:18,591 --> 02:07:21,740
of it was purchased through
bitcoin and those things were,

3970
02:07:21,741 --> 02:07:25,820
is illegal as drugs or as guns or
there was a lot of different things,

3971
02:07:25,821 --> 02:07:26,550
right?

3972
02:07:26,550 --> 02:07:27,240
Yeah.

3973
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:28,640
Well it's the,

3974
02:07:28,650 --> 02:07:31,920
it's was mostly drugs and the just today,

3975
02:07:31,921 --> 02:07:34,170
53 minutes ago or whatever,

3976
02:07:34,620 --> 02:07:36,040
I don't know the guy

3977
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:36,873
that,

3978
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:39,030
those two people got
arrested for that from the,

3979
02:07:39,031 --> 02:07:39,390
the,

3980
02:07:39,390 --> 02:07:40,920
they had a company that was a,

3981
02:07:40,930 --> 02:07:43,690
a laundering money using bitcoins,

3982
02:07:43,770 --> 02:07:44,351
allegedly,

3983
02:07:44,351 --> 02:07:45,184
allegedly.

3984
02:07:46,230 --> 02:07:50,410
Definitely someone who sold
bitcoin to users who bought drugs.

3985
02:07:50,650 --> 02:07:51,483
Right,

3986
02:07:51,590 --> 02:07:52,031
exactly.

3987
02:07:52,031 --> 02:07:53,080
Money Laundering for drug.

3988
02:07:53,081 --> 02:07:53,591
Let's be clear,

3989
02:07:53,591 --> 02:07:54,341
the allocation,

3990
02:07:54,341 --> 02:07:55,600
I read the indictment and on the plane,

3991
02:07:55,601 --> 02:07:56,291
and I'm not a lawyer,

3992
02:07:56,291 --> 02:07:56,770
but what it,

3993
02:07:56,770 --> 02:07:59,260
what it said is that allegedly,

3994
02:07:59,650 --> 02:08:00,040
uh,

3995
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:05,040
these people sold bitcoin to someone
who then resold it on the Silk Road to

3996
02:08:05,711 --> 02:08:06,790
other users,

3997
02:08:06,850 --> 02:08:09,580
some of whom he used it to buy drugs.

3998
02:08:09,610 --> 02:08:11,320
So how could somebody be responsible for,

3999
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:11,740
that's up.

4000
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:12,550
That's like,

4001
02:08:12,550 --> 02:08:14,680
that's a three hop allegation.

4002
02:08:14,681 --> 02:08:15,760
And in my mind,

4003
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:17,530
if that's the standard,

4004
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:20,440
then at least half of Wall
Street should be in cuffs.

4005
02:08:20,650 --> 02:08:23,890
Right now the thing it's allegedly,

4006
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:25,240
so let's keep that in there.

4007
02:08:25,241 --> 02:08:25,780
I mean,

4008
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:26,051
yeah,

4009
02:08:26,051 --> 02:08:27,970
many we've used many allegedly is,

4010
02:08:27,971 --> 02:08:28,720
it's very important.

4011
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:29,140
Well this is a,

4012
02:08:29,140 --> 02:08:30,810
there's a lot of exaggerated,

4013
02:08:31,720 --> 02:08:35,470
exaggerated claims and statements
in prosecution indictments.

4014
02:08:35,471 --> 02:08:39,010
When you're a career prosecutor and you
write up the indictments and decide to

4015
02:08:39,011 --> 02:08:40,210
take it to the grand jury,

4016
02:08:40,420 --> 02:08:42,490
you're not going to just write
the littlest thing you do.

4017
02:08:42,670 --> 02:08:44,290
You're going to make it look like,

4018
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:44,621
Eh,

4019
02:08:44,621 --> 02:08:44,981
you know,

4020
02:08:44,981 --> 02:08:49,570
every person who arrest is the worst
person in the world and has massive crimes

4021
02:08:49,571 --> 02:08:50,404
going on,

4022
02:08:51,160 --> 02:08:55,210
which means that reading fats and
seeing how much of a weak case it is,

4023
02:08:55,211 --> 02:08:56,044
you know,

4024
02:08:56,110 --> 02:09:00,940
allegedly sold to someone who allegedly
sold to users who allegedly both drugs.

4025
02:09:01,630 --> 02:09:02,463
Um,

4026
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:03,130
I dunno,

4027
02:09:03,130 --> 02:09:04,630
it seems insane.

4028
02:09:04,631 --> 02:09:06,190
It's almost like your employee,

4029
02:09:06,620 --> 02:09:07,090
uh,

4030
02:09:07,090 --> 02:09:12,090
buys drugs with money that you paid him
so you are in trouble for him buying

4031
02:09:12,281 --> 02:09:13,090
drugs.

4032
02:09:13,090 --> 02:09:13,781
I'm not a lawyer.

4033
02:09:13,781 --> 02:09:17,320
I'm not going to figure out
what sort of connection,

4034
02:09:17,321 --> 02:09:19,540
the same direct sort of connection
and let's see them try and prove it.

4035
02:09:19,780 --> 02:09:20,710
I mean that's the best,

4036
02:09:20,711 --> 02:09:21,580
the justice system.

4037
02:09:21,581 --> 02:09:22,181
You have to,

4038
02:09:22,181 --> 02:09:23,014
you have to prove it.

4039
02:09:23,110 --> 02:09:23,321
Yeah.

4040
02:09:23,321 --> 02:09:26,230
But it's so scary that someone's
freedom is on the line for something as

4041
02:09:26,231 --> 02:09:27,280
ambiguous as that.

4042
02:09:27,430 --> 02:09:30,550
Especially when you're dealing with
someone's selling bitcoin to someone who

4043
02:09:30,551 --> 02:09:34,600
used then use that bitcoin to buy
drugs once it's out of your hands.

4044
02:09:34,700 --> 02:09:38,230
Scary as he got a 24 year
olds sitting in jail for this.

4045
02:09:38,231 --> 02:09:43,210
And you've got the 55 year old CEO of
HSBC who didn't even resign after being

4046
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:47,320
fined hundreds of millions of
dollars for laundering billions.

4047
02:09:47,650 --> 02:09:48,340
Yeah.

4048
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:49,210
What the fuck?

4049
02:09:49,450 --> 02:09:54,430
Government don't make us use the internet
to run everything that's gonna happen,

4050
02:09:54,431 --> 02:09:55,264
right?

4051
02:09:56,410 --> 02:09:56,741
Yeah.

4052
02:09:56,741 --> 02:09:59,500
I mean this is actually probably owned
by the government and there you're going

4053
02:09:59,501 --> 02:10:01,780
to use it and voting in the
future and like you said,

4054
02:10:01,850 --> 02:10:02,683
it's probably going to be,

4055
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:05,020
it doesn't matter if it's
owned by the government.

4056
02:10:05,020 --> 02:10:05,260
Look,

4057
02:10:05,260 --> 02:10:05,980
listen,

4058
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:06,611
the government,

4059
02:10:06,611 --> 02:10:07,880
the government invented the,

4060
02:10:07,881 --> 02:10:11,710
the basic protocols behind the internets
and then engineers and geeks took it

4061
02:10:11,711 --> 02:10:13,210
and turned it into a global network.

4062
02:10:13,630 --> 02:10:16,480
And even if the governments had
invented the math behind bitcoin,

4063
02:10:16,690 --> 02:10:17,770
we know how it works.

4064
02:10:17,830 --> 02:10:22,030
It's math and we're using it to do
things that the government doesn't

4065
02:10:22,031 --> 02:10:23,140
necessarily control that well.

4066
02:10:23,141 --> 02:10:24,130
So if they did invent it,

4067
02:10:24,131 --> 02:10:25,270
that was a bad idea.

4068
02:10:25,740 --> 02:10:26,710
Often some people,

4069
02:10:26,711 --> 02:10:27,940
someone says it was the internet,

4070
02:10:29,290 --> 02:10:31,180
the underlying technology,

4071
02:10:31,420 --> 02:10:33,040
there's nothing mysterious about it.

4072
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:34,100
Can read the source code.

4073
02:10:34,101 --> 02:10:35,210
You can see how it works,

4074
02:10:35,211 --> 02:10:39,050
you can understand how it works and
you're not trusting anyone specific.

4075
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:42,830
You're just trusting that you
understand how it works and it's math.

4076
02:10:42,920 --> 02:10:43,161
I mean,

4077
02:10:43,161 --> 02:10:47,120
that's the beauty of it and that's why
it people are adopting it so easily is

4078
02:10:47,121 --> 02:10:49,010
because there's no one behind the curtain.

4079
02:10:50,080 --> 02:10:50,320
Yeah.

4080
02:10:50,320 --> 02:10:50,570
It's,

4081
02:10:50,570 --> 02:10:51,071
it's also,

4082
02:10:51,071 --> 02:10:51,820
it's sexy.

4083
02:10:51,820 --> 02:10:52,320
You know,

4084
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:53,560
it's the new kid on the block.

4085
02:10:53,561 --> 02:10:54,850
It's the new exciting thing.

4086
02:10:54,851 --> 02:10:55,271
It's the,

4087
02:10:55,271 --> 02:10:55,511
the,

4088
02:10:55,511 --> 02:10:55,930
the,

4089
02:10:55,930 --> 02:10:56,591
as you said,

4090
02:10:56,591 --> 02:10:57,940
the Internet of money.

4091
02:10:57,970 --> 02:10:58,330
Yeah.

4092
02:10:58,330 --> 02:11:00,520
And people want to be the first adopters.

4093
02:11:00,550 --> 02:11:01,600
They want to get on it first.

4094
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:01,840
Okay.

4095
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:04,180
That flux happening in this economy.

4096
02:11:04,300 --> 02:11:04,871
I mean really,

4097
02:11:04,871 --> 02:11:05,561
let's think about it.

4098
02:11:05,561 --> 02:11:09,190
What else is happening in this economy
now other than the military under,

4099
02:11:09,310 --> 02:11:13,480
other than I'm more derivatives piled
on the Huppah more derivatives by the

4100
02:11:13,481 --> 02:11:13,870
banks.

4101
02:11:13,870 --> 02:11:16,020
Pretty much everything
else is at a standstill.

4102
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:16,893
Set Marijuana.

4103
02:11:18,110 --> 02:11:19,110
The money from marijuana.

4104
02:11:19,290 --> 02:11:19,531
Yeah.

4105
02:11:19,531 --> 02:11:22,950
Well that's the one thing in this economy
that's exploded in the places where

4106
02:11:22,951 --> 02:11:24,200
it's been introduced and allowed to,

4107
02:11:24,560 --> 02:11:25,393
to uh,

4108
02:11:25,410 --> 02:11:26,610
operate in the free market.

4109
02:11:26,820 --> 02:11:28,290
And ironically,

4110
02:11:28,291 --> 02:11:28,591
those,

4111
02:11:28,591 --> 02:11:28,810
the,

4112
02:11:28,810 --> 02:11:28,991
the,

4113
02:11:28,991 --> 02:11:32,130
the situation there was that they weren't
letting those people who are selling

4114
02:11:32,131 --> 02:11:33,960
the marijuana put their money in banks.

4115
02:11:34,260 --> 02:11:38,220
The government has since amended that
and said that they're going to now start

4116
02:11:38,221 --> 02:11:42,600
allowing these people who run
these medical marijuana stores to,

4117
02:11:42,601 --> 02:11:42,810
uh,

4118
02:11:42,810 --> 02:11:43,830
put their money in banks,

4119
02:11:43,831 --> 02:11:45,060
which is a huge victory.

4120
02:11:45,390 --> 02:11:45,991
And I think,

4121
02:11:45,991 --> 02:11:46,470
you know,

4122
02:11:46,470 --> 02:11:49,320
ultimately it's unconscionable.

4123
02:11:49,321 --> 02:11:50,580
Do anything else because you're,

4124
02:11:50,581 --> 02:11:51,780
you're allowing a,

4125
02:11:51,781 --> 02:11:53,730
an environment where crime,

4126
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:57,900
violent crime is most likely going to
take place because you are making people

4127
02:11:57,901 --> 02:11:58,441
targets.

4128
02:11:58,441 --> 02:11:59,940
If you're not allowing them to bank,

4129
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:00,430
you're,

4130
02:12:00,430 --> 02:12:04,290
you're making sure they have massive
amounts of cash on them on a regular basis

4131
02:12:04,291 --> 02:12:05,250
and they're going to get targeted.

4132
02:12:05,530 --> 02:12:06,570
It's just a matter of time.

4133
02:12:06,571 --> 02:12:06,751
You're,

4134
02:12:06,751 --> 02:12:07,620
you're creating,

4135
02:12:08,040 --> 02:12:10,320
you're going to create
victims of a violent crime.

4136
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:13,290
So I'm glad they decided to not do that.

4137
02:12:13,291 --> 02:12:16,470
But that's a perfect example of the
kind of fuckery that's involved in our

4138
02:12:16,471 --> 02:12:21,471
government that you could have these
people that did pass a law allowing

4139
02:12:21,631 --> 02:12:23,040
something to be legal.

4140
02:12:23,041 --> 02:12:28,041
And yet still those people are kept from
in prohibited from putting that money

4141
02:12:28,501 --> 02:12:29,334
in banks.

4142
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:30,871
It's nuts.

4143
02:12:30,871 --> 02:12:31,704
It's madness.

4144
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:32,730
I mean,

4145
02:12:32,730 --> 02:12:37,140
the broader scheme of
this is understanding that
there's ways to deal this

4146
02:12:37,141 --> 02:12:37,950
through law,

4147
02:12:37,950 --> 02:12:41,070
including the People's
propositions in these states.

4148
02:12:41,340 --> 02:12:43,800
And then there's a lot
of these extra legal,

4149
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:44,700
uh,

4150
02:12:44,700 --> 02:12:45,300
you know,

4151
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:50,300
shenanigans that happen where suddenly
someone gets audited for a dozen years in

4152
02:12:51,330 --> 02:12:51,570
a row,

4153
02:12:51,570 --> 02:12:51,811
right?

4154
02:12:51,811 --> 02:12:52,130
Yeah.

4155
02:12:52,130 --> 02:12:52,840
And Yeah,

4156
02:12:52,840 --> 02:12:57,330
J J Edgar Hoover had people
audited every year of their life,

4157
02:12:57,630 --> 02:12:58,050
um,

4158
02:12:58,050 --> 02:12:59,310
because he didn't like them.

4159
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,990
And some of those practices,

4160
02:13:00,991 --> 02:13:02,580
Keno continue to this day.

4161
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:06,740
Now I prove least like to
see the rules followed.

4162
02:13:06,780 --> 02:13:08,320
I mean that's the whole
point of this country is,

4163
02:13:08,321 --> 02:13:10,800
and it's a rule of law
equally apply to all.

4164
02:13:10,801 --> 02:13:12,540
At least if we know what the rules are,

4165
02:13:12,790 --> 02:13:15,690
you can follow them or choose not
to and then face the consequences.

4166
02:13:15,691 --> 02:13:18,330
But if you don't even know what the rules
are because people may come up as they

4167
02:13:18,331 --> 02:13:18,810
go along,

4168
02:13:18,810 --> 02:13:19,980
that's not a good place to live.

4169
02:13:20,050 --> 02:13:20,471
Yeah.

4170
02:13:20,471 --> 02:13:21,790
If a a business,

4171
02:13:21,791 --> 02:13:26,020
a private business acted the way the IRS
did as far as like handing out audits

4172
02:13:26,021 --> 02:13:27,910
to people that were political opponents,

4173
02:13:28,090 --> 02:13:30,100
handing out audits to
people that were personal,

4174
02:13:30,101 --> 02:13:31,680
opponents of people that in power,

4175
02:13:31,950 --> 02:13:34,230
if a private company acted out that way,

4176
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:36,810
they would be guilty of all
sorts of fucking violations.

4177
02:13:36,811 --> 02:13:38,070
It probably be somebody in jail.

4178
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:40,260
I mean it would be a really
big issue if you found out,

4179
02:13:40,680 --> 02:13:44,310
but they've been auditing people just
to fuck with him for the longest time.

4180
02:13:44,340 --> 02:13:44,490
It's,

4181
02:13:44,490 --> 02:13:46,350
it's pretty gross and scary thing.

4182
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:46,671
Well,

4183
02:13:46,671 --> 02:13:50,570
the good news is there now to auditing
bitcoiners and so far we have a nice

4184
02:13:50,571 --> 02:13:51,404
relationship,

4185
02:13:51,940 --> 02:13:52,220
uh,

4186
02:13:52,220 --> 02:13:55,460
with the IRS and they're looking
for ways to help us pay our taxes.

4187
02:13:55,461 --> 02:13:56,630
And I'm looking forward to that time.

4188
02:13:56,660 --> 02:13:58,460
I'm looking forward to filing my taxes,

4189
02:13:58,890 --> 02:13:59,200
uh,

4190
02:13:59,200 --> 02:14:00,260
and paying them this year.

4191
02:14:00,440 --> 02:14:01,250
I'm fascinated.

4192
02:14:01,250 --> 02:14:01,611
I mean,

4193
02:14:01,611 --> 02:14:03,980
I pay them every year paying,

4194
02:14:04,010 --> 02:14:06,610
paying Texas specifically for the
bitcoin earnings I've had this year.

4195
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:07,590
I'm fascinated,

4196
02:14:07,591 --> 02:14:11,100
I'm fascinated to see that
this yuck Amo Nakamoto guys.

4197
02:14:11,370 --> 02:14:12,031
How do you say his name?

4198
02:14:12,031 --> 02:14:13,470
Satoshi Nakamoto.

4199
02:14:13,471 --> 02:14:14,630
So Toshi Yakamoto,

4200
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:15,660
have you met this cat?

4201
02:14:16,150 --> 02:14:18,720
No one's been solution that
Comodo I think got real.

4202
02:14:18,940 --> 02:14:19,690
That's what I'm saying.

4203
02:14:19,690 --> 02:14:19,931
Well,

4204
02:14:19,931 --> 02:14:20,531
I mean there's,

4205
02:14:20,531 --> 02:14:22,160
there was a possibility
no one's mad at him.

4206
02:14:22,410 --> 02:14:24,460
There was a possibility that,

4207
02:14:24,490 --> 02:14:24,701
well,

4208
02:14:24,701 --> 02:14:25,510
here's what we know.

4209
02:14:25,510 --> 02:14:28,480
We know what he wrote and
based on what he wrote,

4210
02:14:28,510 --> 02:14:32,830
we know his name by changing it to numbers
and doing it backwards and googling

4211
02:14:32,831 --> 02:14:33,191
stuff.

4212
02:14:33,191 --> 02:14:33,840
And it was Savannah.

4213
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:36,490
If you type in his name
backwards into Google,

4214
02:14:36,670 --> 02:14:40,960
it leads you to this whole real long a
discussion on some board about bitcoins.

4215
02:14:40,961 --> 02:14:42,580
And I'm like stealing them.

4216
02:14:42,581 --> 02:14:43,414
And stuff like that.

4217
02:14:43,420 --> 02:14:44,253
It's a really weird,

4218
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:45,280
okay,

4219
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:45,701
I stopped.

4220
02:14:45,701 --> 02:14:46,300
Just continue.

4221
02:14:46,300 --> 02:14:47,133
Sorry about him.

4222
02:14:47,210 --> 02:14:47,391
No,

4223
02:14:47,391 --> 02:14:47,501
no,

4224
02:14:47,501 --> 02:14:47,930
no.

4225
02:14:47,930 --> 02:14:48,280
The,

4226
02:14:48,280 --> 02:14:48,680
the,

4227
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:48,960
the,

4228
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:50,650
the thing about Satoshi Nakamoto is we,

4229
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:52,090
he's written a scientific paper,

4230
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:52,540
right?

4231
02:14:52,540 --> 02:14:53,740
And before that paper,

4232
02:14:53,741 --> 02:14:54,970
and after that paper,

4233
02:14:54,971 --> 02:14:58,600
he participated in the community for two
and a half years having conversations

4234
02:14:58,601 --> 02:14:59,530
about how to do this.

4235
02:14:59,531 --> 02:15:01,240
So what we know is he's a scientist.

4236
02:15:01,570 --> 02:15:02,291
He's a scientist,

4237
02:15:02,291 --> 02:15:05,950
heavily involved in cartography and
economics and in digital currencies,

4238
02:15:06,070 --> 02:15:08,620
which is a space that's been
thriving for 20 years now.

4239
02:15:08,980 --> 02:15:09,820
And he,

4240
02:15:09,970 --> 02:15:10,750
she,

4241
02:15:10,750 --> 02:15:13,810
they found a way to solve a specific,

4242
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:14,090
whoa,

4243
02:15:14,090 --> 02:15:14,371
whoa,

4244
02:15:14,371 --> 02:15:14,551
Whoa,

4245
02:15:14,551 --> 02:15:14,760
Whoa,

4246
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:14,971
Whoa,

4247
02:15:14,971 --> 02:15:15,181
whoa,

4248
02:15:15,181 --> 02:15:15,361
Whoa,

4249
02:15:15,361 --> 02:15:15,600
whoa.

4250
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:15,841
He,

4251
02:15:15,841 --> 02:15:16,171
she,

4252
02:15:16,171 --> 02:15:17,004
they,

4253
02:15:17,180 --> 02:15:19,940
so does she Nakamoto
might not be a person.

4254
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,710
Satoshi Nakamoto might be a woman.

4255
02:15:21,890 --> 02:15:25,580
Satoshi Nakamoto might be a group of two
or three people collaborating under a

4256
02:15:25,581 --> 02:15:27,860
pseudonym to create a scientific solution.

4257
02:15:29,060 --> 02:15:29,893
It doesn't matter.

4258
02:15:30,410 --> 02:15:32,150
They invented science.

4259
02:15:32,210 --> 02:15:32,331
Oh,

4260
02:15:32,331 --> 02:15:32,721
for sure.

4261
02:15:32,721 --> 02:15:33,441
It doesn't matter,

4262
02:15:33,441 --> 02:15:34,430
but aren't you fascinating?

4263
02:15:34,460 --> 02:15:34,581
Oh,

4264
02:15:34,581 --> 02:15:35,600
I'm totally fascinated.

4265
02:15:35,610 --> 02:15:38,030
But here's the lesson we've learned.

4266
02:15:38,720 --> 02:15:43,160
Prometheus's stole fire from the Gods
and gave it to the people and they tied

4267
02:15:43,161 --> 02:15:46,160
him to a fucking rock and had an
eagle eat his liver every day.

4268
02:15:46,470 --> 02:15:50,570
So Tosha Nakamoto gave money to the people
and he disappeared because he's smart

4269
02:15:50,571 --> 02:15:53,270
enough or she's smart enough
not to get tied to a rock.

4270
02:15:53,930 --> 02:15:54,980
That's the bottom line.

4271
02:15:55,010 --> 02:15:59,990
I don't look into it because I think
only bad things can come out of,

4272
02:16:00,050 --> 02:16:00,350
uh,

4273
02:16:00,350 --> 02:16:01,880
outing Nakamoto.

4274
02:16:02,030 --> 02:16:02,863
I see what you're saying.

4275
02:16:02,970 --> 02:16:04,460
They get smeared immediately.

4276
02:16:04,461 --> 02:16:04,821
Right.

4277
02:16:04,821 --> 02:16:07,490
And there's nothing good that will come
out of it because at the end of the day,

4278
02:16:07,820 --> 02:16:09,080
since they control nothing,

4279
02:16:09,530 --> 02:16:12,080
and since what they invented
is a mathematical solution,

4280
02:16:12,290 --> 02:16:13,123
it doesn't matter.

4281
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:15,720
So you believe that potentially

4282
02:16:15,820 --> 02:16:18,700
this group of people or individual person,

4283
02:16:18,730 --> 02:16:19,541
whatever it was,

4284
02:16:19,541 --> 02:16:20,650
whichever scenario,

4285
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:22,810
whichever sacks that they,

4286
02:16:22,811 --> 02:16:23,644
they

4287
02:16:23,930 --> 02:16:26,510
thought about it in advance and Oh,

4288
02:16:26,511 --> 02:16:28,400
they said they spent several
years working on the,

4289
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:30,470
I mean there active and not just the,

4290
02:16:30,471 --> 02:16:31,240
the code.

4291
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:35,230
I'm talking about the repercussions of
their actions and they decided to be

4292
02:16:35,231 --> 02:16:37,390
anonymous in their delivery of this.

4293
02:16:37,450 --> 02:16:37,601
Well,

4294
02:16:37,601 --> 02:16:40,810
I think throughout the 90s a lot of
the people involved in digital currency

4295
02:16:40,811 --> 02:16:43,750
environment because some of
them were working in oppressive,

4296
02:16:43,751 --> 02:16:44,890
highly oppressive environments.

4297
02:16:44,891 --> 02:16:45,724
And you know,

4298
02:16:47,770 --> 02:16:51,850
people may be working from Burma or
from China or from who knows where.

4299
02:16:52,150 --> 02:16:55,240
And so it's not a good thing to be
doing these with your own name attached.

4300
02:16:55,241 --> 02:16:59,980
So they made a lot of people in this space
where involved anonymously to protect

4301
02:16:59,981 --> 02:17:00,581
their own safety.

4302
02:17:00,581 --> 02:17:02,170
I was at working in digital currencies,

4303
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:04,720
basically doing science
work in cryptography ends,

4304
02:17:04,721 --> 02:17:06,310
mathematics and distributed systems.

4305
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:08,230
That's a very sexy part of the story.

4306
02:17:08,231 --> 02:17:10,840
You can't leave that out
anymore when you tell the story.

4307
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:14,380
You got to tell people that nobody
knows if Satoshi Nakamoto is even real.

4308
02:17:14,530 --> 02:17:15,550
That's kind of cool.

4309
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:16,271
Yeah,

4310
02:17:16,271 --> 02:17:17,230
it is kind of cool.

4311
02:17:17,260 --> 02:17:17,561
But,

4312
02:17:17,561 --> 02:17:17,861
uh,

4313
02:17:17,861 --> 02:17:18,131
you know,

4314
02:17:18,131 --> 02:17:19,630
we do know some things about Satoshi,

4315
02:17:19,660 --> 02:17:20,493
for example,

4316
02:17:20,710 --> 02:17:22,690
he puts two spaces after every period,

4317
02:17:22,780 --> 02:17:25,630
or she or she or they were,

4318
02:17:25,750 --> 02:17:26,500
or is that guy?

4319
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:27,333
That's the Toshi,

4320
02:17:28,840 --> 02:17:29,673
Toshi.

4321
02:17:29,980 --> 02:17:32,760
A lot of people have tried to
gas and there's a lot of uh,

4322
02:17:32,820 --> 02:17:34,660
a lot of digital currency,

4323
02:17:34,770 --> 02:17:35,020
uh,

4324
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:36,640
scientists and cartographers,

4325
02:17:36,641 --> 02:17:40,870
well known cryptographers who participated
in the creation of many of the

4326
02:17:40,871 --> 02:17:44,020
aspects of bitcoin and people
are fingered them and said,

4327
02:17:44,050 --> 02:17:44,291
you know,

4328
02:17:44,291 --> 02:17:45,071
maybe that's the toll.

4329
02:17:45,071 --> 02:17:45,551
She may be,

4330
02:17:45,551 --> 02:17:46,384
that's the Toshi,

4331
02:17:46,870 --> 02:17:48,040
maybe they're also Toshi.

4332
02:17:48,250 --> 02:17:51,640
I am Sitoshi so this is sort of
almost like a jack the ripper sort of

4333
02:17:51,641 --> 02:17:53,050
investigation only.

4334
02:17:53,051 --> 02:17:54,070
He didn't kill anyone.

4335
02:17:54,071 --> 02:17:55,750
He gave science to the people.

4336
02:17:55,830 --> 02:17:55,950
Well,

4337
02:17:55,950 --> 02:17:57,130
I mean in terms of,

4338
02:17:57,131 --> 02:18:00,860
there's so many different theories of
who you ever watched a documentary on it

4339
02:18:00,910 --> 02:18:02,640
solve Jack The ripper is murder,

4340
02:18:02,670 --> 02:18:03,130
you know,

4341
02:18:03,130 --> 02:18:05,440
they always find out that
it's a totally different gods.

4342
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:06,880
It's like a great story.

4343
02:18:06,881 --> 02:18:07,421
I mean,

4344
02:18:07,421 --> 02:18:07,721
you know,

4345
02:18:07,721 --> 02:18:12,721
this person invented a completely
new science people or people and,

4346
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,820
and then disappeared for
their own safety and yeah,

4347
02:18:15,821 --> 02:18:16,654
that's pretty cool.

4348
02:18:16,660 --> 02:18:17,200
Yeah,

4349
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:21,550
it is fast and it's going to be ripe
for conspiracy theories of all kinds to

4350
02:18:21,551 --> 02:18:22,390
jump out of that.

4351
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:23,530
And you know,

4352
02:18:23,530 --> 02:18:26,080
I tried to focus primarily
on the technology because I,

4353
02:18:26,081 --> 02:18:27,190
it stands alone.

4354
02:18:27,430 --> 02:18:28,263
That's the key.

4355
02:18:28,270 --> 02:18:30,010
It doesn't need any of this.

4356
02:18:30,250 --> 02:18:31,150
There is a culture,

4357
02:18:31,151 --> 02:18:31,931
there's a history,

4358
02:18:31,931 --> 02:18:32,621
there's all of that.

4359
02:18:32,621 --> 02:18:33,550
Then it's fascinating,

4360
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:37,690
but the technology just works and it's
simple math and people can read it,

4361
02:18:37,830 --> 02:18:39,100
understand how it works,

4362
02:18:39,310 --> 02:18:40,180
and then use it.

4363
02:18:40,330 --> 02:18:42,960
And that's the beauty of it because
it doesn't depend on anyone.

4364
02:18:42,970 --> 02:18:44,380
You don't have to trust the Toshi.

4365
02:18:44,680 --> 02:18:47,950
You don't have to trust the bank and you
don't have to trust that someone's not

4366
02:18:47,951 --> 02:18:50,770
going to mess it up because
you can see how it works.

4367
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:54,730
That's such a subject as ripe
for conspiracy theorists.

4368
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:55,061
Boy,

4369
02:18:55,061 --> 02:18:56,500
they're going to jump all over that one.

4370
02:18:56,501 --> 02:18:57,334
Then you got a big foot.

4371
02:18:57,370 --> 02:18:59,350
They're going to chem trail
the fuck out of that one.

4372
02:18:59,390 --> 02:18:59,530
Okay,

4373
02:18:59,530 --> 02:18:59,711
well,

4374
02:18:59,711 --> 02:18:59,921
yeah,

4375
02:18:59,921 --> 02:19:00,131
it's,

4376
02:19:00,131 --> 02:19:00,611
it's a,

4377
02:19:00,611 --> 02:19:01,600
it's already happening.

4378
02:19:01,770 --> 02:19:02,620
The tower seven,

4379
02:19:02,621 --> 02:19:03,430
this shit out.

4380
02:19:03,430 --> 02:19:05,500
How can we make a connection
with bitcoin entire seven?

4381
02:19:05,501 --> 02:19:06,251
There has to be something.

4382
02:19:06,251 --> 02:19:07,084
It's all fun.

4383
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:08,140
Tower seven.

4384
02:19:09,370 --> 02:19:09,741
Hell,

4385
02:19:09,741 --> 02:19:12,060
the original computer
that created Bitcoin,

4386
02:19:12,070 --> 02:19:15,700
it wasn't done at 2008 it
was done in 2001 the NSA,

4387
02:19:15,701 --> 02:19:16,534
the CIA,

4388
02:19:16,640 --> 02:19:17,560
and the DEA.

4389
02:19:19,750 --> 02:19:20,650
I've met that guy,

4390
02:19:20,980 --> 02:19:21,813
Alex Jones.

4391
02:19:21,940 --> 02:19:22,110
Oh,

4392
02:19:22,110 --> 02:19:22,990
was that complex?

4393
02:19:22,991 --> 02:19:23,351
Jones?

4394
02:19:23,351 --> 02:19:24,190
I was just guessing.

4395
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:25,840
I've met several guys like that.

4396
02:19:25,841 --> 02:19:26,050
Yeah,

4397
02:19:26,050 --> 02:19:27,010
well there's a lot of those guys.

4398
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:27,621
Boy,

4399
02:19:27,621 --> 02:19:28,250
there's some fucking

4400
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:30,110
ferocious conspiracy theorists out there.

4401
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:31,370
Um,

4402
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:32,203
I'm,

4403
02:19:32,770 --> 02:19:34,400
I'm fascinated by these things.

4404
02:19:34,401 --> 02:19:39,401
I'm fascinating by these new avenues
that our culture starts going down and

4405
02:19:40,250 --> 02:19:45,250
these incredible avenues and branches of
possibility off of these new new paths.

4406
02:19:47,390 --> 02:19:49,130
It's just a really amazing,

4407
02:19:49,131 --> 02:19:51,350
amazing time in so many ways.

4408
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:56,380
And this highlights just this constant
repeating subject that comes up with me

4409
02:19:57,021 --> 02:19:58,940
and my friends is that W it's,

4410
02:19:58,941 --> 02:20:00,860
the Internet has changed everything,

4411
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:01,280
everything.

4412
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:03,740
And we've pretended that
it's only been a little bit,

4413
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:04,221
oh,

4414
02:20:04,221 --> 02:20:05,270
so you get email now.

4415
02:20:05,271 --> 02:20:06,104
What's the big deal?

4416
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:06,950
It's,

4417
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:08,420
it's monstrous.

4418
02:20:08,480 --> 02:20:08,640
Yeah.

4419
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:09,473
It's changed.

4420
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:10,670
It's changed my life.

4421
02:20:10,690 --> 02:20:15,690
A 100% change the way I think 100% changed
my connection with just random human

4422
02:20:17,451 --> 02:20:17,931
beings.

4423
02:20:17,931 --> 02:20:18,500
I,

4424
02:20:18,500 --> 02:20:23,500
I interact with thousands of random
human beings online on a daily basis.

4425
02:20:23,780 --> 02:20:28,780
And 99.9999% of those
interactions are positive.

4426
02:20:29,060 --> 02:20:29,540
Yes,

4427
02:20:29,540 --> 02:20:30,230
exactly.

4428
02:20:30,230 --> 02:20:32,240
That's the most beautiful aspect about it.

4429
02:20:32,241 --> 02:20:33,074
Like

4430
02:20:33,540 --> 02:20:35,350
bitcoin is just an expression of that.

4431
02:20:35,351 --> 02:20:36,610
It's a child of the Internet.

4432
02:20:36,611 --> 02:20:36,791
You know,

4433
02:20:36,791 --> 02:20:37,720
when people say,

4434
02:20:38,020 --> 02:20:38,261
you know,

4435
02:20:38,261 --> 02:20:42,460
the intranet now is so cooperative and
restrictive that you can't do anything.

4436
02:20:42,461 --> 02:20:46,870
Well I can tell you you can
because bitcoin came right
out of that and works on

4437
02:20:46,871 --> 02:20:48,220
that perfectly today.

4438
02:20:48,550 --> 02:20:49,383
So you know,

4439
02:20:49,410 --> 02:20:54,040
the bit bitcoin is one more thing that
happens because of the Internet and now

4440
02:20:54,041 --> 02:20:55,030
it's turning around.

4441
02:20:55,031 --> 02:20:56,080
And here's the interesting thing.

4442
02:20:56,560 --> 02:20:58,870
It allows you to do
very small transactions,

4443
02:20:58,900 --> 02:21:00,790
micro nano transactions.

4444
02:21:00,970 --> 02:21:01,990
So for example,

4445
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:07,030
if you want to monetize your podcast
and you accepted bitcoin and people sent

4446
02:21:07,031 --> 02:21:12,031
you a 10th of a penny or a penny or a
dollar and you added up over hundreds of

4447
02:21:12,370 --> 02:21:15,580
thousands of users because it doesn't
cost much to send because it's an easy

4448
02:21:15,581 --> 02:21:16,414
transaction.

4449
02:21:16,660 --> 02:21:19,690
People will make transactions
smaller and smaller and smaller.

4450
02:21:19,691 --> 02:21:24,691
So suddenly bitcoin can fund all of the
independent content providers and all of

4451
02:21:25,031 --> 02:21:28,840
the independent infrastructure providers
on the intranet and transformed the

4452
02:21:28,841 --> 02:21:30,820
Internet again from the inside out.

4453
02:21:31,780 --> 02:21:32,613
Wow.

4454
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:36,550
Like imagine all of these media companies
that have gotten so horribly disrupted

4455
02:21:36,551 --> 02:21:38,310
because there's basically
two media models.

4456
02:21:38,330 --> 02:21:40,000
If you make content on the Internet,

4457
02:21:40,300 --> 02:21:41,950
you either sell advertising.

4458
02:21:41,980 --> 02:21:46,150
So you're stuffing junk into the
eyeballs of your customers or your ears.

4459
02:21:46,330 --> 02:21:47,410
And the bigger the company,

4460
02:21:47,411 --> 02:21:49,000
the more junk that comes out of it,

4461
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:49,930
right?

4462
02:21:49,930 --> 02:21:53,860
Or you're selling your customer
if the product is free,

4463
02:21:53,861 --> 02:21:54,820
your the product,

4464
02:21:54,860 --> 02:21:55,570
right?

4465
02:21:55,570 --> 02:21:55,870
Right.

4466
02:21:55,870 --> 02:21:58,780
Your personal information
is what generates the value.

4467
02:21:58,781 --> 02:22:00,580
So if you're on a social
media site that's free,

4468
02:22:00,581 --> 02:22:01,570
you're the product.

4469
02:22:01,900 --> 02:22:04,630
And so they're selling your
information in order to make money.

4470
02:22:04,631 --> 02:22:07,330
So it's either advertising
or selling your information.

4471
02:22:07,331 --> 02:22:09,010
Well now there's this third way,

4472
02:22:09,220 --> 02:22:14,220
which is you can do transactions small
enough to have value when accumulated in

4473
02:22:14,711 --> 02:22:15,670
large numbers.

4474
02:22:15,990 --> 02:22:20,680
The you could independently and
directly funds content providers and

4475
02:22:20,681 --> 02:22:24,220
infrastructure on the Internet
and break the hold of these,

4476
02:22:24,550 --> 02:22:25,080
you know,

4477
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:25,680
um,

4478
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:30,150
systems of concentration that advertising
and social media have become privacy,

4479
02:22:30,151 --> 02:22:31,670
selling privacy and,

4480
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:32,850
and selling advertising,

4481
02:22:32,851 --> 02:22:34,440
which require concentration.

4482
02:22:34,470 --> 02:22:36,140
They require enormous concentration.

4483
02:22:36,450 --> 02:22:40,330
What do you think if we set up a
dedicated Joe Rogan experience?

4484
02:22:40,331 --> 02:22:44,200
Bitcoin server right here
where we do not server,

4485
02:22:44,201 --> 02:22:49,060
but computer could have advocated to
just crunching just out of respect.

4486
02:22:49,230 --> 02:22:49,460
Yeah.

4487
02:22:49,460 --> 02:22:51,700
I just have one running here
in the background all the time.

4488
02:22:51,750 --> 02:22:51,950
Yeah,

4489
02:22:51,950 --> 02:22:52,280
we joke.

4490
02:22:52,280 --> 02:22:53,200
Can we go to jail for that?

4491
02:22:53,201 --> 02:22:53,680
Is that possible?

4492
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:53,951
No,

4493
02:22:53,951 --> 02:22:54,520
of course not.

4494
02:22:54,520 --> 02:22:55,300
In fact yet,

4495
02:22:55,300 --> 02:22:55,601
you know,

4496
02:22:55,601 --> 02:22:56,650
at the end of the show,

4497
02:22:56,651 --> 02:22:56,951
uh,

4498
02:22:56,951 --> 02:22:59,200
I'd like to help set you
up with a wallet on your,

4499
02:22:59,201 --> 02:23:01,130
on your smart phone and
I'll send you some bitcoin.

4500
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:02,060
Sure,

4501
02:23:02,060 --> 02:23:02,893
sure.

4502
02:23:03,770 --> 02:23:04,480
Um,

4503
02:23:04,480 --> 02:23:06,490
the other question I
wanted to ask you about,

4504
02:23:06,510 --> 02:23:06,621
we,

4505
02:23:06,621 --> 02:23:08,860
we spoke about earlier was net neutrality.

4506
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:09,311
Now,

4507
02:23:09,311 --> 02:23:09,760
um,

4508
02:23:09,760 --> 02:23:14,760
that that's a huge issue for anyone who
loves the way the Internet works and the

4509
02:23:15,791 --> 02:23:20,350
way the internet does not judge and the
Internet is freely available to anyone

4510
02:23:20,351 --> 02:23:23,500
who poe ports into it
at virtually whatever,

4511
02:23:23,501 --> 02:23:23,981
you know,

4512
02:23:23,981 --> 02:23:25,120
you pay for your connection,

4513
02:23:25,121 --> 02:23:25,291
your,

4514
02:23:25,291 --> 02:23:25,651
you're going to,

4515
02:23:25,651 --> 02:23:26,110
you know,

4516
02:23:26,110 --> 02:23:27,490
whatever your download speed is.

4517
02:23:27,491 --> 02:23:28,660
But there's no,

4518
02:23:28,690 --> 02:23:33,690
there's no regulation as far as like it
being easier for Walmart to get online

4519
02:23:34,331 --> 02:23:39,331
or they have more of a percentage of the
pipe or what are we concerned about net

4520
02:23:39,911 --> 02:23:44,911
neutrality being somehow or another
compromise by nefarious sources?

4521
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:45,701
Well,

4522
02:23:45,701 --> 02:23:46,590
I mean that's your travels.

4523
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:49,880
He suffered a massive setback in the
courts just a couple of weeks ago with a

4524
02:23:49,881 --> 02:23:52,300
decision that allowed to
Verizon communications,

4525
02:23:52,301 --> 02:23:54,340
so not be subject to the FCC rule,

4526
02:23:54,640 --> 02:23:56,170
imposing net neutrality,

4527
02:23:56,500 --> 02:24:01,190
and that sent shockwaves through the
industry because the average down what?

4528
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:02,033
What was the,

4529
02:24:02,150 --> 02:24:03,450
the Internet lost.

4530
02:24:03,610 --> 02:24:03,801
What?

4531
02:24:03,801 --> 02:24:04,590
What was the case?

4532
02:24:04,590 --> 02:24:08,080
The case was the FCC made a rule that
said that carriers must support net

4533
02:24:08,081 --> 02:24:11,980
neutrality and for ice and suit and had
it overturned as unconstitutional or

4534
02:24:11,981 --> 02:24:14,170
outside the mandate to the
FCC to be more accurate.

4535
02:24:14,200 --> 02:24:16,090
What did Verizon specifically want?

4536
02:24:16,900 --> 02:24:17,081
Well,

4537
02:24:17,081 --> 02:24:19,420
we don't know that they say they
want to make the internet better,

4538
02:24:19,421 --> 02:24:23,050
but they just got the rule that says that
they have to treat all traffic equally

4539
02:24:23,051 --> 02:24:23,884
taken out.

4540
02:24:24,160 --> 02:24:28,030
And most people don't realize that the
reason the internet allows things like

4541
02:24:28,031 --> 02:24:31,420
Netflix to happen is because they
didn't have to ask anyone's permission.

4542
02:24:31,421 --> 02:24:36,421
Now imagine if when Netflix started it
had to ask Comcast to run as traffic and

4543
02:24:36,761 --> 02:24:37,810
pay for premium.

4544
02:24:38,110 --> 02:24:38,281
Well,

4545
02:24:38,281 --> 02:24:40,390
they wouldn't do that
because it's a competitor.

4546
02:24:40,391 --> 02:24:43,870
So of course they'd crowd the out
of the market with exorbitant fees.

4547
02:24:44,260 --> 02:24:48,190
Net neutrality means that everybody has
a fair shake to be heard and it's up to

4548
02:24:48,191 --> 02:24:50,920
the end user to decide who
they want to listen to.

4549
02:24:51,100 --> 02:24:55,420
All of the traffic will reach you if you
wanted as the listener or as a viewer.

4550
02:24:55,570 --> 02:24:55,871
Now,

4551
02:24:55,871 --> 02:24:56,171
Ken,

4552
02:24:56,171 --> 02:25:00,580
they somehow or another limit where the
traffic goes to like what we're seeing

4553
02:25:00,581 --> 02:25:02,680
in other countries where they
have restrictive internet laws.

4554
02:25:02,710 --> 02:25:04,330
Is that a potential,

4555
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:06,200
I think for product to this case,

4556
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:10,280
I think the biggest threat right now
it comes to companies like Netflix or

4557
02:25:10,281 --> 02:25:14,420
things like I'm streaming
radio and audio systems,

4558
02:25:14,421 --> 02:25:15,650
a Spotify,

4559
02:25:15,651 --> 02:25:16,251
Pandora,

4560
02:25:16,251 --> 02:25:21,251
etc. Whereby a service providers who
have their own TV streams or their own

4561
02:25:21,741 --> 02:25:25,900
music streams that are competing are
going to make their experience great.

4562
02:25:26,170 --> 02:25:29,680
And Netflix experience somewhat suckier,

4563
02:25:29,830 --> 02:25:33,670
so they'll limit the bandwidth
of Netflix applications.

4564
02:25:33,970 --> 02:25:34,810
They'll choke them.

4565
02:25:35,290 --> 02:25:35,740
Right?

4566
02:25:35,740 --> 02:25:36,341
Right now.

4567
02:25:36,341 --> 02:25:38,140
I mean they already do in some cases,

4568
02:25:38,141 --> 02:25:39,190
but how they do that?

4569
02:25:40,120 --> 02:25:40,301
Well,

4570
02:25:40,301 --> 02:25:42,430
I mean they all kinds of shenanigans,

4571
02:25:42,431 --> 02:25:43,264
but I mean the bay,

4572
02:25:43,270 --> 02:25:47,800
the basic deal is that this FCC rule was
trying to establish a legal framework

4573
02:25:47,801 --> 02:25:47,981
on the,

4574
02:25:47,981 --> 02:25:51,790
which they'd be obliged to give equal
access to all contents as long as the

4575
02:25:51,791 --> 02:25:52,571
viewer chose,

4576
02:25:52,571 --> 02:25:53,740
that's what they want to see.

4577
02:25:54,070 --> 02:25:56,500
Or they wanted to connect
to all of the Internet.

4578
02:25:56,770 --> 02:25:59,830
They would connect to that with the
same bandwidth that they've bought.

4579
02:26:00,310 --> 02:26:00,581
A,

4580
02:26:00,581 --> 02:26:04,600
you buy bandwidth and you use it for
whatever you want and you don't get better

4581
02:26:04,601 --> 02:26:06,130
bandwidth if you use their shows.

4582
02:26:06,131 --> 02:26:06,964
The Netflix,

4583
02:26:07,090 --> 02:26:07,450
well,

4584
02:26:07,450 --> 02:26:09,400
once they tried to put that rule in place,

4585
02:26:09,610 --> 02:26:10,240
you know,

4586
02:26:10,240 --> 02:26:10,810
um,

4587
02:26:10,810 --> 02:26:14,890
the lawsuit started and now we have a
very bad decision that could really,

4588
02:26:14,891 --> 02:26:16,510
really hamper innovation.

4589
02:26:16,511 --> 02:26:19,870
A lot of the things that we see today on
the Internet would not have happened if

4590
02:26:19,871 --> 02:26:23,560
net neutrality weren't
observed and the Verizon,

4591
02:26:23,561 --> 02:26:25,480
for many people who don't realize this,

4592
02:26:25,481 --> 02:26:30,481
Verizon offers home Internet
connection as well as four g and,

4593
02:26:30,950 --> 02:26:32,350
and TV most importantly,

4594
02:26:32,351 --> 02:26:32,621
right.

4595
02:26:32,621 --> 02:26:34,690
And pay per view and video on demand,

4596
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:38,020
which means that they're directly
competing against other content providers.

4597
02:26:38,290 --> 02:26:41,420
Verizon now has a fiber
optic system that's,

4598
02:26:41,740 --> 02:26:42,573
you know,

4599
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:47,640
incredibly fast and connects to you direct
download movies and television shows.

4600
02:26:50,050 --> 02:26:52,860
There's a lot going on
right now as far as um,

4601
02:26:53,460 --> 02:26:53,800
uh,

4602
02:26:53,800 --> 02:26:56,170
as far as internet related content,

4603
02:26:56,171 --> 02:26:58,630
things like Netflix and things like,

4604
02:26:58,631 --> 02:27:03,631
I mean Hulu and Hulu plus and there's
these places are now starting to create

4605
02:27:03,731 --> 02:27:05,350
their own programming as well.

4606
02:27:05,380 --> 02:27:05,830
Right.

4607
02:27:05,830 --> 02:27:08,920
Getting really fascinating cause they're
not just competing with Verizon now.

4608
02:27:08,921 --> 02:27:11,440
They're competing with NBC
and CBS and what have you.

4609
02:27:11,860 --> 02:27:16,240
And if you like that net neutrality is
why it happens and therefore we should be

4610
02:27:16,241 --> 02:27:17,330
defending that you trial.

4611
02:27:17,331 --> 02:27:22,150
So what people should do is probably
boycott companies that don't support net

4612
02:27:22,151 --> 02:27:22,750
neutrality.

4613
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:22,961
Sure.

4614
02:27:22,961 --> 02:27:26,290
I'm a huge supporter of the eff
electronic frontier foundation that's been

4615
02:27:26,291 --> 02:27:28,450
fighting for privacy and liberty.

4616
02:27:28,451 --> 02:27:32,470
And then you travel to on the
Internet since the early nineties,

4617
02:27:32,530 --> 02:27:35,920
and they've won several substantial
cases both against organizations like the

4618
02:27:35,921 --> 02:27:36,610
NSA,

4619
02:27:36,610 --> 02:27:40,420
but also against a service providers
that tried to abuse their position to

4620
02:27:40,421 --> 02:27:41,560
prioritize traffic.

4621
02:27:41,830 --> 02:27:44,410
And they've promoted the idea of an open,

4622
02:27:44,710 --> 02:27:45,341
independent,

4623
02:27:45,341 --> 02:27:48,040
transparent and fair Internet for all,

4624
02:27:48,380 --> 02:27:48,550
uh,

4625
02:27:48,550 --> 02:27:49,840
with equal access for everyone.

4626
02:27:49,841 --> 02:27:50,111
I mean,

4627
02:27:50,111 --> 02:27:53,050
that's the thing that's made
the Internet magic and they've

4628
02:27:53,051 --> 02:27:56,230
been@theforefrontofdoingthattoeff.org
I'm a huge supporter.

4629
02:27:56,590 --> 02:27:57,490
That's interesting.

4630
02:27:57,560 --> 02:27:57,951
Well,

4631
02:27:57,951 --> 02:28:02,490
we'll look into that and maybe we'll
fucking put an eff sticker on our website

4632
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:03,250
or something like that.

4633
02:28:03,250 --> 02:28:04,680
And you can put it on your webcam too.

4634
02:28:04,690 --> 02:28:06,850
They're the same ones who
sell those little things.

4635
02:28:06,870 --> 02:28:07,240
Yeah,

4636
02:28:07,240 --> 02:28:08,590
well those guys are on the ball.

4637
02:28:08,790 --> 02:28:09,130
Yeah,

4638
02:28:09,130 --> 02:28:09,521
that's,

4639
02:28:09,521 --> 02:28:11,050
that's something to
really be concerned with.

4640
02:28:11,051 --> 02:28:14,560
It really is the idea that they
could limit your experience,

4641
02:28:14,590 --> 02:28:16,060
whether it's Netflix or whatever.

4642
02:28:16,061 --> 02:28:18,280
Downloadable charter does it to Jamie.

4643
02:28:18,281 --> 02:28:18,401
I,

4644
02:28:18,401 --> 02:28:20,050
they won't let them go
to pirate bay anymore.

4645
02:28:20,051 --> 02:28:21,190
And I've heard that before.

4646
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:22,010
Allegedly,

4647
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:22,700
allegedly,

4648
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:23,533
allegedly,

4649
02:28:23,900 --> 02:28:25,500
allegedly he doesn't go to pirate bay.

4650
02:28:25,580 --> 02:28:25,901
Fuck,

4651
02:28:25,901 --> 02:28:26,150
well,

4652
02:28:26,150 --> 02:28:28,620
I need to download a legal lego league,

4653
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:29,713
legal music,

4654
02:28:29,880 --> 02:28:31,820
legal like nine inch nails.

4655
02:28:32,540 --> 02:28:36,470
So if you're in an area where
they have a lockdown on,

4656
02:28:36,560 --> 02:28:38,300
on Internet providers,

4657
02:28:38,570 --> 02:28:38,901
you know,

4658
02:28:38,901 --> 02:28:41,540
where some people like
can only get Verizon,

4659
02:28:41,541 --> 02:28:45,050
they're in an area that only gets rise
and like 18 t doesn't reach their time

4660
02:28:45,051 --> 02:28:45,920
Warner's and reach there.

4661
02:28:48,600 --> 02:28:49,440
That sucks.

4662
02:28:49,560 --> 02:28:50,150
That's,

4663
02:28:50,150 --> 02:28:51,150
that's so disturbing.

4664
02:28:51,151 --> 02:28:53,110
And it's so contrary to the,

4665
02:28:53,111 --> 02:28:55,950
the trends that we would
like to see as far as,

4666
02:28:56,010 --> 02:28:57,420
here's one good idea.

4667
02:28:57,480 --> 02:28:59,070
One could thought that comes out of this.

4668
02:28:59,340 --> 02:29:03,000
A lot of the problem right now is that
you pay for both of your infrastructure

4669
02:29:03,001 --> 02:29:04,740
and your content in a single payment.

4670
02:29:04,780 --> 02:29:05,613
Your Isp,

4671
02:29:06,330 --> 02:29:09,930
well with bitcoin you could
pay the recipients of the
content provider directly

4672
02:29:09,931 --> 02:29:10,471
in tiny,

4673
02:29:10,471 --> 02:29:10,831
tiny,

4674
02:29:10,831 --> 02:29:11,664
tiny payments.

4675
02:29:12,120 --> 02:29:14,160
So you really are the bitcoin genius,

4676
02:29:15,090 --> 02:29:16,110
your bitcoin Jesus.

4677
02:29:16,111 --> 02:29:16,740
Because you,

4678
02:29:16,740 --> 02:29:17,520
um,

4679
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:20,970
he is because he's buying bitcoin
as a solution for everything.

4680
02:29:21,620 --> 02:29:21,810
Well,

4681
02:29:21,810 --> 02:29:22,051
I mean,

4682
02:29:22,051 --> 02:29:25,260
it's powerful stuff fixed that
and bitcoin can fix the Internet.

4683
02:29:25,290 --> 02:29:26,730
Bitcoin can fix Verizon.

4684
02:29:26,760 --> 02:29:28,290
It's almost an I'm not,

4685
02:29:28,410 --> 02:29:28,981
it's just,

4686
02:29:28,981 --> 02:29:29,670
you know,

4687
02:29:29,670 --> 02:29:32,880
it's almost like evangelists
stick like it almost like a,

4688
02:29:32,900 --> 02:29:33,570
like pyramids.

4689
02:29:33,570 --> 02:29:36,150
Like when you go to a pyramid type
thing where they're sounding like,

4690
02:29:36,151 --> 02:29:37,140
no you're not you.

4691
02:29:37,190 --> 02:29:38,550
Is there anything you don't like about it?

4692
02:29:38,551 --> 02:29:40,080
Like what's the number one
thing that you're like,

4693
02:29:40,300 --> 02:29:42,570
I hope something changes with this.

4694
02:29:42,571 --> 02:29:43,404
Is there anything,

4695
02:29:43,650 --> 02:29:43,921
yeah,

4696
02:29:43,921 --> 02:29:44,251
sure.

4697
02:29:44,251 --> 02:29:45,190
I mean it's got a,

4698
02:29:45,210 --> 02:29:47,910
it's got some scalability
issues that are being solved.

4699
02:29:47,940 --> 02:29:48,700
It's a,

4700
02:29:48,700 --> 02:29:52,200
it's software so we have to be
very careful with the upgrades.

4701
02:29:52,470 --> 02:29:53,303
Um,

4702
02:29:53,340 --> 02:29:54,031
but you know,

4703
02:29:54,031 --> 02:29:56,670
I mean compared to the
existing form of money we have,

4704
02:29:56,700 --> 02:29:58,530
I honestly think it's
better money and it's,

4705
02:29:58,560 --> 02:30:00,180
and it's a great technology.

4706
02:30:00,540 --> 02:30:03,690
I've spent 20 years doing
security and distributed systems.

4707
02:30:03,691 --> 02:30:05,910
That's my area of expertise
as a professional.

4708
02:30:06,210 --> 02:30:10,680
So what I love about this is that I can
see the elegance of the technology and I

4709
02:30:10,681 --> 02:30:12,120
understand its implications.

4710
02:30:12,380 --> 02:30:17,380
The last time I felt like this was 1992
and it was because I saw the internet

4711
02:30:17,431 --> 02:30:21,780
and I saw the elegance of its and I was
out telling as many people as I could,

4712
02:30:22,020 --> 02:30:22,231
you know,

4713
02:30:22,231 --> 02:30:25,050
this is really going to change
things in ways you don't even expect.

4714
02:30:25,051 --> 02:30:28,560
And I can't even explain to
you yet because it's going
to unfold in ways no one

4715
02:30:28,561 --> 02:30:29,394
anticipates.

4716
02:30:29,640 --> 02:30:32,490
Because what it does is it
democratizes information.

4717
02:30:32,820 --> 02:30:33,391
So yes,

4718
02:30:33,391 --> 02:30:35,910
I'm excited about something
that democratizes money,

4719
02:30:36,150 --> 02:30:38,760
but it's because I understand
the underlying technology.

4720
02:30:39,150 --> 02:30:39,451
Uh,

4721
02:30:39,451 --> 02:30:39,751
you know,

4722
02:30:39,751 --> 02:30:41,850
I don't profit from talking about this.

4723
02:30:42,150 --> 02:30:42,983
Uh,

4724
02:30:42,990 --> 02:30:44,880
I'm able to build a career on it.

4725
02:30:44,881 --> 02:30:45,450
Sure.

4726
02:30:45,450 --> 02:30:46,650
And I love doing it,

4727
02:30:46,651 --> 02:30:47,940
but really at the,

4728
02:30:48,090 --> 02:30:48,930
at the heart of it,

4729
02:30:49,290 --> 02:30:50,123
I'm a geek.

4730
02:30:50,190 --> 02:30:53,220
I love the technology and that
passion just comes through.

4731
02:30:53,350 --> 02:30:54,131
It's obvious.

4732
02:30:54,131 --> 02:30:55,210
It's obvious that you love it.

4733
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:56,610
You light up and you,

4734
02:30:56,611 --> 02:30:59,140
you when the word bitcoin
comes out of your mouth,

4735
02:30:59,141 --> 02:31:01,120
it comes out just covered in love juice.

4736
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:02,433
You love it.

4737
02:31:02,680 --> 02:31:04,930
It's obvious and it's
interesting and it's,

4738
02:31:04,931 --> 02:31:05,231
it's,

4739
02:31:05,231 --> 02:31:05,680
um,

4740
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:09,820
you're in a very unique position because
you're really at the edge of it and

4741
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:10,170
you're,

4742
02:31:10,170 --> 02:31:15,170
you're sort of at the front of this
ever increasing in mass ship and a,

4743
02:31:15,230 --> 02:31:16,540
you're watching a game momentum.

4744
02:31:16,541 --> 02:31:17,530
It's got to be pretty exciting.

4745
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:18,671
It's exciting.

4746
02:31:18,671 --> 02:31:19,350
It's,

4747
02:31:19,350 --> 02:31:20,430
it was also terrifying

4748
02:31:20,430 --> 02:31:21,121
for quite a while.

4749
02:31:21,121 --> 02:31:21,331
I mean,

4750
02:31:21,331 --> 02:31:24,270
I've been in this full time for almost
two years and I can tell you that that

4751
02:31:24,271 --> 02:31:26,610
was a not a very profitable,

4752
02:31:26,660 --> 02:31:29,340
a job for living before that.

4753
02:31:30,030 --> 02:31:30,301
Um,

4754
02:31:30,301 --> 02:31:32,280
I've been an independent freelancer.

4755
02:31:32,281 --> 02:31:33,360
I've been starting businesses.

4756
02:31:33,361 --> 02:31:34,200
I'm an entrepreneur,

4757
02:31:34,610 --> 02:31:36,800
so I was an independent
freelancer and linking them.

4758
02:31:36,810 --> 02:31:37,081
What,

4759
02:31:37,081 --> 02:31:37,621
what is your,

4760
02:31:37,621 --> 02:31:37,890
your,

4761
02:31:37,890 --> 02:31:38,431
your background,

4762
02:31:38,431 --> 02:31:39,450
your education and background?

4763
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:42,780
I'm a computer scientist with a
specialization in distributed systems.

4764
02:31:43,030 --> 02:31:43,180
Uh,

4765
02:31:43,180 --> 02:31:47,880
I've been working in security for just
over 18 years in information security

4766
02:31:47,881 --> 02:31:48,540
systems.

4767
02:31:48,540 --> 02:31:49,950
So I worked as a consultant.

4768
02:31:49,951 --> 02:31:51,120
I worked as an advisor.

4769
02:31:51,121 --> 02:31:53,910
I worked as a chief information
officer for companies.

4770
02:31:54,330 --> 02:31:55,980
I built research companies.

4771
02:31:55,981 --> 02:31:56,620
I built,

4772
02:31:56,620 --> 02:31:56,910
uh,

4773
02:31:56,910 --> 02:31:58,080
companies that built,

4774
02:31:58,200 --> 02:31:58,400
uh,

4775
02:31:58,400 --> 02:32:00,900
Internet systems and I
followed the Internet.

4776
02:32:00,930 --> 02:32:02,670
I'm not one of the
pioneers of the Internet.

4777
02:32:02,850 --> 02:32:06,240
I was the 16 year old kid looking over
their shoulder as they were doing these

4778
02:32:06,241 --> 02:32:06,550
things,

4779
02:32:06,550 --> 02:32:06,910
you know,

4780
02:32:06,910 --> 02:32:10,770
so I was buried in it when
I was young and you know,

4781
02:32:11,220 --> 02:32:12,210
so I've,

4782
02:32:12,330 --> 02:32:12,750
uh,

4783
02:32:12,750 --> 02:32:13,800
I've worked as a,

4784
02:32:13,801 --> 02:32:16,740
as an independent professional
in this space for many years.

4785
02:32:16,740 --> 02:32:20,190
And then two years ago I
first discovered bitcoin.

4786
02:32:20,610 --> 02:32:22,260
Then it hit me again a second time.

4787
02:32:22,261 --> 02:32:26,490
I read this little sheet of paper and I
decided this is the job I'm going to do

4788
02:32:26,730 --> 02:32:28,320
and right now if there is no job,

4789
02:32:28,321 --> 02:32:29,850
so I'm not gonna make any money at it,

4790
02:32:29,851 --> 02:32:32,790
but I'm going to do this job
until it actually becomes a job.

4791
02:32:32,791 --> 02:32:35,970
And I did that for two years and I almost
went bankrupt because there wasn't a

4792
02:32:35,971 --> 02:32:37,140
job there at the beginning.

4793
02:32:37,770 --> 02:32:40,260
And now it's a job and it's very exciting.

4794
02:32:40,290 --> 02:32:42,140
So this is a conscious decision on your,

4795
02:32:42,150 --> 02:32:44,940
your part back when it
wasn't even profitable?

4796
02:32:45,210 --> 02:32:45,541
Oh yeah,

4797
02:32:45,541 --> 02:32:46,080
absolutely.

4798
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:48,630
Massive chance and stepped
out on the edge of the dock.

4799
02:32:48,750 --> 02:32:49,170
Yes.

4800
02:32:49,170 --> 02:32:50,910
I invested in several companies.

4801
02:32:50,911 --> 02:32:52,800
I drained my retirement accounts,

4802
02:32:53,130 --> 02:32:54,360
I drained my savings,

4803
02:32:54,361 --> 02:32:57,000
paying my bills until I could
generate income doing this.

4804
02:32:57,540 --> 02:32:58,530
Wow.

4805
02:32:58,590 --> 02:32:59,270
And I,

4806
02:32:59,270 --> 02:32:59,560
I've,

4807
02:32:59,560 --> 02:33:01,860
I mean this is not prudent investment.

4808
02:33:02,220 --> 02:33:04,620
This is not prudent behavior financially.

4809
02:33:04,621 --> 02:33:06,300
But as a,

4810
02:33:06,330 --> 02:33:07,620
as a technologist,

4811
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:10,600
as a person who's worked
in distributed systems and,

4812
02:33:10,680 --> 02:33:12,570
and security and computer systems,

4813
02:33:13,050 --> 02:33:16,560
I could see that this was an exciting
technology and I want to build a career in

4814
02:33:16,561 --> 02:33:16,681
it.

4815
02:33:16,681 --> 02:33:21,330
So what I've been doing is swapping
money for skills and experience and the

4816
02:33:21,331 --> 02:33:23,310
opportunity to be on the ground floor.

4817
02:33:23,670 --> 02:33:27,690
I was too young when the Internet started
to to be influential in that space and

4818
02:33:27,691 --> 02:33:30,330
I see this opportunity as a
second opportunity to do that.

4819
02:33:31,290 --> 02:33:31,770
Now.

4820
02:33:31,770 --> 02:33:34,500
How did you know that
Bitcoin was the solution?

4821
02:33:34,530 --> 02:33:39,290
What made you so confident that you
invested as exorbitant amount of time in,

4822
02:33:39,291 --> 02:33:39,720
in,

4823
02:33:39,720 --> 02:33:44,720
in bitcoin and you know back two years
ago that the future could not have looked

4824
02:33:45,421 --> 02:33:46,770
nearly as bright as it looks now?

4825
02:33:46,980 --> 02:33:47,970
So the key,

4826
02:33:47,971 --> 02:33:52,800
the key here was that I was in distributed
systems and security and then the

4827
02:33:52,801 --> 02:33:54,900
first time I thought I heard about it,

4828
02:33:54,901 --> 02:33:58,950
I thought nerd money and then
the s like everybody does,

4829
02:33:58,951 --> 02:33:59,251
right?

4830
02:33:59,251 --> 02:34:00,060
That's where Brian is,

4831
02:34:00,060 --> 02:34:01,770
that possible can't possibly work.

4832
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:06,330
Then I went back and I read this a Toshi
paper and I grasped the science and it

4833
02:34:06,331 --> 02:34:09,300
was confusing that I read it again and
I really grasped the science and then

4834
02:34:09,301 --> 02:34:10,134
suddenly it hit me.

4835
02:34:10,680 --> 02:34:11,513
Oh my God,

4836
02:34:11,730 --> 02:34:12,930
this isn't a currency.

4837
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:15,300
It's a consensus network.

4838
02:34:16,290 --> 02:34:18,670
This is the grail of distributed systems.

4839
02:34:18,671 --> 02:34:20,020
Of the last 15 years,

4840
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:22,390
you can do so much more than currency.

4841
02:34:22,391 --> 02:34:24,340
And once that light bulb went off,

4842
02:34:24,610 --> 02:34:26,710
all I could see was the possibilities.

4843
02:34:26,950 --> 02:34:29,860
Oh well now that we have this technology,

4844
02:34:30,070 --> 02:34:35,070
we can do this and this and this and the
currency will do these things for us.

4845
02:34:35,620 --> 02:34:36,580
And you know,

4846
02:34:36,581 --> 02:34:38,680
all of these possibilities
unfolded in my head.

4847
02:34:38,681 --> 02:34:39,190
And it was,

4848
02:34:39,190 --> 02:34:41,800
it was a really dizzy experience,

4849
02:34:42,190 --> 02:34:47,190
but I understood the fundamental building
blocks looked so much like the early

4850
02:34:47,351 --> 02:34:50,950
Internet and I knew what
structures like that do.

4851
02:34:50,951 --> 02:34:52,630
They create a network effect.

4852
02:34:52,870 --> 02:34:56,500
They create this attractive force where
it gets more useful the more people who

4853
02:34:56,501 --> 02:34:57,334
use it.

4854
02:34:57,340 --> 02:34:57,491
Now,

4855
02:34:57,491 --> 02:35:01,360
work effect was coined first by Bob mad
calf in 1984 he said the value of the

4856
02:35:01,361 --> 02:35:04,870
network increases exponentially
with the addition of each node.

4857
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:07,480
Because when you join a network,

4858
02:35:07,570 --> 02:35:09,730
you don't just getting that value,

4859
02:35:09,910 --> 02:35:13,030
but by increasing the size of the network
to make it more valuable for everyone

4860
02:35:13,031 --> 02:35:14,800
else because they have one
more person to connect to.

4861
02:35:14,890 --> 02:35:15,490
Right.

4862
02:35:15,490 --> 02:35:16,810
And if you keep doing that,

4863
02:35:16,840 --> 02:35:18,880
it achieves a scale where
it starts multiplying.

4864
02:35:19,180 --> 02:35:24,180
That's how the Internet grew and when
you have this magic combination of money

4865
02:35:25,061 --> 02:35:28,240
for the people that can be
sent directly between people,

4866
02:35:28,390 --> 02:35:28,991
the forms,

4867
02:35:28,991 --> 02:35:29,860
a network,

4868
02:35:30,130 --> 02:35:31,540
those three things came together.

4869
02:35:31,540 --> 02:35:32,201
In my head I'm like,

4870
02:35:32,201 --> 02:35:32,621
this is,

4871
02:35:32,621 --> 02:35:35,290
this is big and nobody knows it yet.

4872
02:35:35,500 --> 02:35:38,050
And when you see something that
big and nobody knows it yet,

4873
02:35:38,410 --> 02:35:42,520
you want to tell everyone and you want
to dedicate a large part of your time to

4874
02:35:42,521 --> 02:35:44,920
doing this because it's
incredibly exciting.

4875
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:45,611
Now,

4876
02:35:45,611 --> 02:35:48,220
how did you initially jump in?

4877
02:35:48,221 --> 02:35:48,401
I mean,

4878
02:35:48,401 --> 02:35:50,890
how do you jump in in
the infant stages of,

4879
02:35:50,891 --> 02:35:51,880
of Bitcoin,

4880
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:52,250
what it,

4881
02:35:52,250 --> 02:35:54,910
what's the steps that you
took to become a part of this?

4882
02:35:55,660 --> 02:35:56,051
Well,

4883
02:35:56,051 --> 02:35:59,590
I spent months and months and months
reading everything that I could,

4884
02:35:59,630 --> 02:36:03,100
the scientific papers and discussions
that Satoshi Nakamoto had with the other

4885
02:36:03,101 --> 02:36:04,390
developers as he developed it.

4886
02:36:04,391 --> 02:36:05,560
I started reading the code,

4887
02:36:05,561 --> 02:36:06,700
I started writing code,

4888
02:36:06,701 --> 02:36:08,410
I started building businesses around it.

4889
02:36:08,770 --> 02:36:10,060
I started talking to people.

4890
02:36:10,061 --> 02:36:13,750
I started meeting up with other bitcoin
enthusiasts and then as soon as I could,

4891
02:36:13,751 --> 02:36:16,390
I started buying bitcoin and you know,

4892
02:36:16,570 --> 02:36:18,400
and basically have been doing that since.

4893
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:23,140
And what does your average day now
consist of going on podcasts and telling

4894
02:36:23,141 --> 02:36:24,460
people how awesome bid coin is?

4895
02:36:24,490 --> 02:36:25,630
How often does that come up?

4896
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:30,220
So I have a day job on the technical
advisor and a number of bitcoin startups.

4897
02:36:30,440 --> 02:36:33,110
I am the chief security
officer for blockchain Info,

4898
02:36:33,130 --> 02:36:35,590
which is the largest bitcoin web wallet,

4899
02:36:35,730 --> 02:36:35,921
uh,

4900
02:36:35,921 --> 02:36:36,754
in the space.

4901
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:37,833
Um,

4902
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:40,660
and I work everyday as a media,

4903
02:36:40,730 --> 02:36:41,500
uh,

4904
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:41,771
you know,

4905
02:36:41,771 --> 02:36:42,670
as a media pundits,

4906
02:36:42,671 --> 02:36:43,910
a commentator on bitcoin.

4907
02:36:43,930 --> 02:36:48,790
I write code and then I comment about
it and I do interviews all the time

4908
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:51,010
because this is something
I believe in strongly.

4909
02:36:51,250 --> 02:36:52,780
I don't get paid for my interviews.

4910
02:36:52,781 --> 02:36:57,781
I have other jobs that allow me to pay
for international travel for a long time.

4911
02:36:58,271 --> 02:37:00,520
That was my savings account until,

4912
02:37:00,570 --> 02:37:00,861
uh,

4913
02:37:00,861 --> 02:37:02,470
until I was able to get other beans.

4914
02:37:03,130 --> 02:37:06,940
Buble you certainly hope to
eventually profit off of this.

4915
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:07,571
Oh,

4916
02:37:07,571 --> 02:37:09,400
actually now I'm making income on Bitcoin,

4917
02:37:09,401 --> 02:37:09,731
so,

4918
02:37:09,731 --> 02:37:10,101
so let's,

4919
02:37:10,101 --> 02:37:11,410
so things are stabilized.

4920
02:37:11,530 --> 02:37:11,921
Uh,

4921
02:37:11,921 --> 02:37:12,281
you know,

4922
02:37:12,281 --> 02:37:13,450
I'm not a bitcoin millionaire.

4923
02:37:13,490 --> 02:37:15,380
I'm may never be a bitcoin millionaire,

4924
02:37:15,710 --> 02:37:18,230
but I know what career I want
to do for the next 15 years.

4925
02:37:18,470 --> 02:37:19,303
Wow.

4926
02:37:19,370 --> 02:37:22,790
So how did you know that bitcoin was
going to be worthwhile and that so many

4927
02:37:22,791 --> 02:37:24,740
people are going to jump on the board?

4928
02:37:25,130 --> 02:37:27,050
A jump of board two years ago,

4929
02:37:27,051 --> 02:37:28,500
it seems like two years ago it was like,

4930
02:37:28,520 --> 02:37:29,271
I didn't know.

4931
02:37:29,271 --> 02:37:32,000
I mean what I knew is this
is a very elegant technology.

4932
02:37:32,001 --> 02:37:34,280
The had some implications,

4933
02:37:34,310 --> 02:37:36,050
some geopolitical implications,

4934
02:37:36,051 --> 02:37:37,340
some cultural implications,

4935
02:37:37,341 --> 02:37:38,660
some technology implications.

4936
02:37:38,661 --> 02:37:41,180
And I liked all of those and I was
very interested in pursuing it.

4937
02:37:41,540 --> 02:37:44,420
And at the time I hoped it was
going to get baked and I figured,

4938
02:37:44,421 --> 02:37:44,601
you know,

4939
02:37:44,601 --> 02:37:45,434
if it didn't and uh,

4940
02:37:45,450 --> 02:37:46,910
and I didn't get anywhere with it,

4941
02:37:46,911 --> 02:37:48,500
I could do something else
in a couple of years.

4942
02:37:48,860 --> 02:37:50,510
You've got to come on again in a year.

4943
02:37:51,170 --> 02:37:51,740
I'd love to,

4944
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:51,951
yeah,

4945
02:37:51,951 --> 02:37:52,280
let's,

4946
02:37:52,280 --> 02:37:52,611
let's,

4947
02:37:52,611 --> 02:37:54,530
let's let this thing cook out there.

4948
02:37:54,531 --> 02:37:55,281
In the crazy world,

4949
02:37:55,281 --> 02:37:56,780
I mean what we say a year,

4950
02:37:56,930 --> 02:37:58,280
but the way things are moving,

4951
02:37:58,281 --> 02:38:00,710
three months you might be right.

4952
02:38:00,970 --> 02:38:04,780
It was getting crazy in terms of
what happened in the last year alone.

4953
02:38:04,790 --> 02:38:06,260
It's been unbelievable.

4954
02:38:06,410 --> 02:38:06,651
I mean,

4955
02:38:06,651 --> 02:38:09,860
we had our first major bitcoin
conference in April in San Jose,

4956
02:38:10,370 --> 02:38:13,220
and now there's like a hundred
conferences going on this year.

4957
02:38:13,370 --> 02:38:14,270
Wow.

4958
02:38:14,360 --> 02:38:16,700
And there's $150 million transaction.

4959
02:38:16,880 --> 02:38:17,270
Right?

4960
02:38:17,270 --> 02:38:17,721
Exactly.

4961
02:38:17,721 --> 02:38:18,630
And the price was that,

4962
02:38:18,631 --> 02:38:18,951
you know what,

4963
02:38:18,951 --> 02:38:19,910
I was working on this,

4964
02:38:19,911 --> 02:38:21,740
the price was $15 I,

4965
02:38:21,950 --> 02:38:22,221
I,

4966
02:38:22,221 --> 02:38:23,420
if you asked me last year,

4967
02:38:23,421 --> 02:38:23,661
it did.

4968
02:38:23,661 --> 02:38:25,280
I think bitcoin would be at a thousand.

4969
02:38:25,281 --> 02:38:25,820
I said,

4970
02:38:25,820 --> 02:38:26,270
no,

4971
02:38:26,270 --> 02:38:27,680
y'all may be in a couple of years.

4972
02:38:28,040 --> 02:38:29,060
I was surprised too.

4973
02:38:29,090 --> 02:38:29,990
But you know,

4974
02:38:30,080 --> 02:38:31,700
it has a way of growing on you.

4975
02:38:32,030 --> 02:38:32,751
And when it does,

4976
02:38:32,751 --> 02:38:36,020
it grows as a network and people
find it useful and they try it.

4977
02:38:36,410 --> 02:38:37,970
They understand how it works,

4978
02:38:37,971 --> 02:38:38,810
it's practical.

4979
02:38:38,900 --> 02:38:40,640
They grasped the usefulness of it,

4980
02:38:40,970 --> 02:38:41,930
and they start using it.

4981
02:38:42,230 --> 02:38:44,600
I wish I had you in here when
Peter Schiff was in here.

4982
02:38:45,260 --> 02:38:47,220
I'd be like sick Andreas.

4983
02:38:48,170 --> 02:38:49,003
Tell him what's up.

4984
02:38:49,940 --> 02:38:50,691
Maybe he's right.

4985
02:38:50,691 --> 02:38:51,620
I don't know who's right or wrong.

4986
02:38:51,690 --> 02:38:51,830
No,

4987
02:38:51,830 --> 02:38:56,180
I don't generally debates on this because
the simple truth is that none of us

4988
02:38:56,181 --> 02:38:57,014
know.

4989
02:38:57,030 --> 02:38:57,320
Right.

4990
02:38:57,320 --> 02:39:01,100
And the reason we don't know is because
the tools we have to analyze currencies

4991
02:39:01,101 --> 02:39:03,590
don't apply because this is a
completely different type of currency.

4992
02:39:03,591 --> 02:39:04,430
It's not a stock,

4993
02:39:04,431 --> 02:39:05,390
it's not a currency.

4994
02:39:05,391 --> 02:39:06,230
It's not an asset.

4995
02:39:06,231 --> 02:39:07,130
It's not a commodity.

4996
02:39:07,131 --> 02:39:07,970
It's a bit of everything.

4997
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:09,170
Um,

4998
02:39:09,170 --> 02:39:11,570
so can I tell you what
it's gonna do in two years?

4999
02:39:11,840 --> 02:39:12,710
Of course not.

5000
02:39:12,830 --> 02:39:13,730
I don't know.

5001
02:39:14,030 --> 02:39:15,050
Nobody knows.

5002
02:39:15,080 --> 02:39:18,920
What I do know is I understand the
technology and what I see as something

5003
02:39:18,921 --> 02:39:20,120
elegant and practical.

5004
02:39:20,330 --> 02:39:22,880
So I'm interested in seeing
where this experiment will go.

5005
02:39:22,881 --> 02:39:24,620
Because here's the thing,

5006
02:39:24,621 --> 02:39:25,580
if it doesn't work,

5007
02:39:25,581 --> 02:39:26,660
some people lose money.

5008
02:39:27,080 --> 02:39:28,130
If it does work.

5009
02:39:28,220 --> 02:39:30,200
We changed the world of money forever.

5010
02:39:31,070 --> 02:39:32,720
And that's a pretty big thing to say.

5011
02:39:32,721 --> 02:39:35,030
But cryptocurrencies I
think are here to stay.

5012
02:39:35,300 --> 02:39:37,910
They offer an elegant solution
to decentralized money.

5013
02:39:38,180 --> 02:39:39,920
And with a bit coin survives or not.

5014
02:39:40,340 --> 02:39:43,970
I want to see where this is going to
go because it has the possibility of

5015
02:39:43,971 --> 02:39:45,770
changing a lot of people's lives.

5016
02:39:46,170 --> 02:39:46,371
Well,

5017
02:39:46,371 --> 02:39:47,151
it certainly does.

5018
02:39:47,151 --> 02:39:50,600
And I want to see them
find that Nakamoto thing.

5019
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:52,010
I want to see who it is.

5020
02:39:52,330 --> 02:39:52,631
Oh,

5021
02:39:52,631 --> 02:39:53,960
I hope they never find him.

5022
02:39:54,040 --> 02:39:54,440
Yeah,

5023
02:39:54,440 --> 02:39:54,791
cause you're,

5024
02:39:54,791 --> 02:39:54,980
you're,

5025
02:39:54,980 --> 02:39:58,700
it's like big foot for you
searching for a searching for sugar,

5026
02:39:58,701 --> 02:39:58,911
man.

5027
02:39:58,911 --> 02:39:59,301
For me,

5028
02:39:59,301 --> 02:40:00,134
I want to find them.

5029
02:40:00,380 --> 02:40:02,970
It's probably gonna be something you
already know to like the dude you got a

5030
02:40:02,971 --> 02:40:04,100
Dell guy or somebody.

5031
02:40:06,770 --> 02:40:08,300
It's unbelievably fascinating.

5032
02:40:08,400 --> 02:40:10,160
It's just unbelievably fascinating.

5033
02:40:10,161 --> 02:40:12,890
Especially listening to you describe it.

5034
02:40:13,230 --> 02:40:13,561
Um,

5035
02:40:13,561 --> 02:40:13,831
your,

5036
02:40:13,831 --> 02:40:14,040
your

5037
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:16,380
passion for it makes it
even more fascinating.

5038
02:40:16,830 --> 02:40:17,371
It's a,

5039
02:40:17,371 --> 02:40:20,370
it's really something that I'm going
to keep my eyes on and try to follow.

5040
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:20,941
So,

5041
02:40:20,941 --> 02:40:21,121
uh,

5042
02:40:21,121 --> 02:40:23,190
I appreciate you coming over
here and I appreciate you,

5043
02:40:23,191 --> 02:40:23,520
uh,

5044
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:26,670
giving us your knowledge
and spending your time and,

5045
02:40:27,060 --> 02:40:27,870
and uh,

5046
02:40:27,870 --> 02:40:28,451
I guess I'll,

5047
02:40:28,451 --> 02:40:29,011
I'll set up,

5048
02:40:29,011 --> 02:40:30,330
I'll watch it on my phone now,

5049
02:40:30,350 --> 02:40:30,930
so,

5050
02:40:30,930 --> 02:40:31,410
yeah,

5051
02:40:31,410 --> 02:40:31,970
sure,

5052
02:40:31,970 --> 02:40:32,271
sure.

5053
02:40:32,271 --> 02:40:33,104
Absolutely.

5054
02:40:33,130 --> 02:40:34,400
And if we set up an android phone,

5055
02:40:34,490 --> 02:40:35,110
yes.

5056
02:40:35,110 --> 02:40:35,471
Right.

5057
02:40:35,471 --> 02:40:35,820
Okay.

5058
02:40:35,820 --> 02:40:36,460
So you can,

5059
02:40:36,460 --> 02:40:37,730
you can download the blockchain.

5060
02:40:37,731 --> 02:40:39,110
And I said before I,

5061
02:40:39,230 --> 02:40:41,360
I work for blockchain as
the chief security officer.

5062
02:40:41,361 --> 02:40:42,740
I was a customer long before that,

5063
02:40:42,741 --> 02:40:44,330
but I think it's one of the better ones.

5064
02:40:44,390 --> 02:40:44,810
Okay.

5065
02:40:44,810 --> 02:40:48,470
So you download blockchain
from your app store and a,

5066
02:40:48,471 --> 02:40:49,460
then you'll get an address.

5067
02:40:49,461 --> 02:40:52,190
And I can then send you some bitcoin
and you'll have it in a few seconds

5068
02:40:53,030 --> 02:40:54,650
to put up a computer here.

5069
02:40:54,651 --> 02:40:56,780
A dedicated computer that
runs can help you do that.

5070
02:40:56,781 --> 02:41:00,320
Coin computations wouldn't
fuck with us in any way,

5071
02:41:00,321 --> 02:41:00,611
right?

5072
02:41:00,611 --> 02:41:00,740
With,

5073
02:41:00,740 --> 02:41:00,890
no,

5074
02:41:00,890 --> 02:41:01,310
not at all.

5075
02:41:01,310 --> 02:41:02,143
Mess with our band.

5076
02:41:02,260 --> 02:41:02,460
Dan,

5077
02:41:02,460 --> 02:41:03,350
what's your electricity?

5078
02:41:04,490 --> 02:41:05,111
Electricity.

5079
02:41:05,111 --> 02:41:08,360
I mean you can get a little
one that's even a USB sticks.

5080
02:41:08,361 --> 02:41:11,930
They call it like a Klondike
insulate a little as stick USB stick.

5081
02:41:11,931 --> 02:41:14,710
You plug it in and he just swapped some
electricity and it generates a bitcoin.

5082
02:41:14,720 --> 02:41:15,900
You're not going to generate monster.

5083
02:41:16,270 --> 02:41:17,880
I'm not trying to get rich off.

5084
02:41:17,930 --> 02:41:18,560
Come off.

5085
02:41:18,560 --> 02:41:20,540
Maybe it's going to be
printed to play with.

5086
02:41:20,541 --> 02:41:21,374
That's cool.

5087
02:41:21,600 --> 02:41:22,510
Bit Coin Street credit.

5088
02:41:22,511 --> 02:41:23,200
That's what I'm looking for.

5089
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:23,321
Yeah,

5090
02:41:23,321 --> 02:41:23,830
exactly.

5091
02:41:23,830 --> 02:41:24,450
All right.

5092
02:41:24,450 --> 02:41:25,031
Listen man,

5093
02:41:25,031 --> 02:41:26,440
this was very enlightening.

5094
02:41:26,470 --> 02:41:26,990
Um,

5095
02:41:26,990 --> 02:41:27,310
uh,

5096
02:41:27,310 --> 02:41:30,340
I'm obviously going to have to
read a lot of shit after this.

5097
02:41:30,370 --> 02:41:34,500
There's so much involved in this
subject and so much involved in crypto

5098
02:41:34,501 --> 02:41:35,190
currencies.

5099
02:41:35,190 --> 02:41:35,621
It's a,

5100
02:41:35,621 --> 02:41:36,161
it's really,

5101
02:41:36,161 --> 02:41:37,060
really interesting stuff,

5102
02:41:37,061 --> 02:41:38,560
but I think it's bad ass man.

5103
02:41:38,561 --> 02:41:43,561
And I really respect a guy like you
who takes a giant leap like that and,

5104
02:41:43,880 --> 02:41:47,320
and dives into something and something
that you believe in and you get really

5105
02:41:47,321 --> 02:41:48,160
passionate about it.

5106
02:41:48,400 --> 02:41:49,630
It's what life is about to me.

5107
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:54,040
It's about pursuing passions and I love
the fact that you're really into it and

5108
02:41:54,041 --> 02:41:54,461
I really,

5109
02:41:54,461 --> 02:41:56,890
really appreciate you coming
on here and enlightening us.

5110
02:41:56,980 --> 02:41:58,950
Thank you so much for having me.

5111
02:41:58,951 --> 02:41:59,231
And you know,

5112
02:41:59,231 --> 02:42:00,031
sometimes you,

5113
02:42:00,031 --> 02:42:01,540
you choose the things
you want to do in life,

5114
02:42:01,541 --> 02:42:03,490
but some of the most
interesting things in life,

5115
02:42:03,880 --> 02:42:04,930
once you find them,

5116
02:42:05,020 --> 02:42:06,430
you have no choice.

5117
02:42:06,460 --> 02:42:07,720
I had no choice.

5118
02:42:07,721 --> 02:42:09,580
I couldn't sleep at night
if I wasn't doing this.

5119
02:42:09,610 --> 02:42:10,431
It's still a choice.

5120
02:42:10,431 --> 02:42:11,710
It was just such a,

5121
02:42:11,711 --> 02:42:12,700
it's such a big drop.

5122
02:42:12,701 --> 02:42:13,151
But yeah,

5123
02:42:13,151 --> 02:42:14,650
I mean I hope you see,

5124
02:42:14,651 --> 02:42:14,921
you know,

5125
02:42:14,921 --> 02:42:16,230
I'm not trying to sell anything.

5126
02:42:16,260 --> 02:42:20,680
I am genuinely passionate about this
because I see an elegant solution.

5127
02:42:20,730 --> 02:42:21,220
Yes.

5128
02:42:21,220 --> 02:42:22,140
Well that is where,

5129
02:42:22,210 --> 02:42:22,571
you know,

5130
02:42:22,571 --> 02:42:23,320
the choices,

5131
02:42:23,320 --> 02:42:25,870
the choices and being that person
who follows their passions,

5132
02:42:26,140 --> 02:42:27,880
that's inspirational to me.

5133
02:42:27,881 --> 02:42:31,420
It's one of the most inspirational
things I encounter both online and in the

5134
02:42:31,421 --> 02:42:34,210
real world is watching people who
are passionate about what they do

5135
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:34,580
do.

5136
02:42:34,580 --> 02:42:34,821
Right.

5137
02:42:34,821 --> 02:42:36,150
You can recognize it in others.

5138
02:42:36,151 --> 02:42:36,560
Yes.

5139
02:42:36,560 --> 02:42:36,950
Yeah.

5140
02:42:36,950 --> 02:42:38,330
It's the only way to live your life

5141
02:42:38,750 --> 02:42:39,531
contagious for me.

5142
02:42:39,531 --> 02:42:43,340
Like it could be a guy
who makes handmade knives,

5143
02:42:43,480 --> 02:42:43,821
you know,

5144
02:42:43,821 --> 02:42:46,460
and grinds the blades and
sharpens the handles and,

5145
02:42:46,760 --> 02:42:47,593
you know,

5146
02:42:47,750 --> 02:42:48,583
puts everything together.

5147
02:42:48,610 --> 02:42:49,670
I have fascinating,

5148
02:42:49,671 --> 02:42:52,970
but I'm fascinated by anything that
someone's incredibly passionate about.

5149
02:42:53,240 --> 02:42:53,631
And,

5150
02:42:53,631 --> 02:42:53,841
uh,

5151
02:42:53,841 --> 02:42:54,261
so this,

5152
02:42:54,261 --> 02:42:57,500
this bit coin thing now
it's just now it's in there.

5153
02:42:57,680 --> 02:42:59,540
Now it's in my list of
things I'm fascinated about.

5154
02:42:59,541 --> 02:42:59,870
Right.

5155
02:42:59,870 --> 02:42:59,961
Well,

5156
02:42:59,961 --> 02:43:00,860
thank you very much.

5157
02:43:00,920 --> 02:43:02,720
So people want to get in touch with you.

5158
02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:03,110
Uh,

5159
02:43:03,110 --> 02:43:03,670
they can,

5160
02:43:03,670 --> 02:43:03,940
uh,

5161
02:43:03,940 --> 02:43:05,780
contact you on Twitter.

5162
02:43:05,890 --> 02:43:07,150
Probably the easiest thing is Twitter.

5163
02:43:07,151 --> 02:43:07,480
Yeah,

5164
02:43:07,480 --> 02:43:09,040
that's the one I can handle the most.

5165
02:43:09,170 --> 02:43:09,861
But listen,

5166
02:43:09,861 --> 02:43:10,870
you're going to get swarmed.

5167
02:43:11,740 --> 02:43:14,440
Try not to pay attention to
all those fucking psychos.

5168
02:43:14,441 --> 02:43:14,860
Okay.

5169
02:43:14,860 --> 02:43:19,090
It's a n t o n o p.

5170
02:43:19,091 --> 02:43:22,360
That's a n t o n o.

5171
02:43:22,361 --> 02:43:23,650
P on Twitter.

5172
02:43:23,780 --> 02:43:24,400
Um,

5173
02:43:24,400 --> 02:43:24,881
and,

5174
02:43:24,881 --> 02:43:25,360
uh,

5175
02:43:25,360 --> 02:43:25,821
entrance.

5176
02:43:25,821 --> 02:43:28,000
Is there anything else
that you have a website,

5177
02:43:28,300 --> 02:43:30,160
a antonopoulos.com.

5178
02:43:30,290 --> 02:43:30,980
Um,

5179
02:43:30,980 --> 02:43:31,281
yeah,

5180
02:43:31,281 --> 02:43:31,521
sure.

5181
02:43:31,521 --> 02:43:34,850
That's why media sites and people
can book me for engagements there,

5182
02:43:34,851 --> 02:43:37,340
but a really on Twitter
is where I'm most active.

5183
02:43:37,550 --> 02:43:40,660
My name is pretty easy to Google and
to thank you so much for having me.

5184
02:43:40,661 --> 02:43:40,831
I really,

5185
02:43:40,831 --> 02:43:40,950
yeah,

5186
02:43:40,950 --> 02:43:41,601
please is.

5187
02:43:41,601 --> 02:43:42,300
It was an honor.

5188
02:43:42,300 --> 02:43:42,990
Um,

5189
02:43:42,990 --> 02:43:46,050
I really think we had like a
crazy internet pioneer in here.

5190
02:43:46,460 --> 02:43:47,070
This is good.

5191
02:43:47,070 --> 02:43:48,690
Some day we're going to
look back on this and say,

5192
02:43:48,691 --> 02:43:48,871
man,

5193
02:43:48,871 --> 02:43:49,704
we have Andrea from,

5194
02:43:49,730 --> 02:43:52,650
I know we should a bought
that coin and apple stock.

5195
02:43:52,680 --> 02:43:53,630
Let us know what the fuck is.

5196
02:43:53,631 --> 02:43:54,500
He told us not to.

5197
02:43:54,690 --> 02:43:56,520
We could have had a whole
room full of computers.

5198
02:43:56,521 --> 02:43:57,180
Man,

5199
02:43:57,180 --> 02:43:57,991
we shouldn't listen to him.

5200
02:43:57,991 --> 02:43:58,471
Back then.

5201
02:43:58,471 --> 02:43:59,430
He didn't have enough faith.

5202
02:44:00,060 --> 02:44:00,390
Uh,

5203
02:44:00,390 --> 02:44:01,110
thanks a lot man.

5204
02:44:01,110 --> 02:44:01,500
Awesome.

5205
02:44:01,500 --> 02:44:01,801
Thank you.

5206
02:44:01,801 --> 02:44:02,730
I really appreciate it.

5207
02:44:03,090 --> 02:44:03,661
Uh,

5208
02:44:03,661 --> 02:44:04,590
to everyone else.

5209
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:07,200
Next big date I got coming up folks,

5210
02:44:07,201 --> 02:44:07,530
uh,

5211
02:44:07,530 --> 02:44:08,610
is um,

5212
02:44:08,910 --> 02:44:10,170
I am in Dallas,

5213
02:44:10,171 --> 02:44:13,740
Texas with Ari Shaffir
and Duncan Trussell.

5214
02:44:13,741 --> 02:44:18,000
That's March 14th at the
Verizon theater this weekend,

5215
02:44:18,001 --> 02:44:18,960
this Friday.

5216
02:44:19,050 --> 02:44:19,630
Um,

5217
02:44:19,630 --> 02:44:19,940
uh,

5218
02:44:19,940 --> 02:44:20,250
um,

5219
02:44:20,250 --> 02:44:21,001
it's sold out.

5220
02:44:21,001 --> 02:44:21,780
I mean New York,

5221
02:44:21,780 --> 02:44:25,020
but don't try to get tickets because if
you do get tickets and just support and

5222
02:44:25,021 --> 02:44:25,854
scalpers,

5223
02:44:25,890 --> 02:44:28,220
so unless you find somebody online that's,

5224
02:44:28,320 --> 02:44:29,800
that can't go cause they're posts,

5225
02:44:29,801 --> 02:44:30,634
it got wet,

5226
02:44:30,840 --> 02:44:32,400
but whatever.

5227
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:34,050
Do what you gotta do folks.

5228
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:34,561
Um,

5229
02:44:34,561 --> 02:44:36,060
so that's the next big one.

5230
02:44:36,120 --> 02:44:36,390
Uh,

5231
02:44:36,390 --> 02:44:37,200

5232
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:37,711
Dallas,

5233
02:44:37,711 --> 02:44:38,670
Verizon theater.

5234
02:44:38,850 --> 02:44:39,780
March 14th.

5235
02:44:39,781 --> 02:44:40,471
Can't fucking wait.

5236
02:44:40,471 --> 02:44:43,950
That's the day before the huge
UFC event at Dallas stadium,

5237
02:44:43,951 --> 02:44:46,830
which is apparently like
50,000 seats or something.

5238
02:44:46,831 --> 02:44:47,664
Bananas.

5239
02:44:47,700 --> 02:44:49,800
So that should be a lot of fun.

5240
02:44:50,040 --> 02:44:50,730
Um,

5241
02:44:50,730 --> 02:44:51,210
that's it.

5242
02:44:51,210 --> 02:44:51,570
All right,

5243
02:44:51,570 --> 02:44:52,111
