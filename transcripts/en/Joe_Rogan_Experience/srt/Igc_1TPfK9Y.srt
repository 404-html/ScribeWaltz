1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,480
Three,
two,

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,540
one.
And we're alive.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,440
How are you sir?
Hey,

4
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:08,580
I'm great.
Thanks for being here,

5
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:09,510
man.
I really appreciate it.

6
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:12,180
It is the coolest thing I've done really
well,

7
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,160
you know,
remember that far back.

8
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,870
That's pretty cool.
Um,

9
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:19,740
I watched your ted talk on what was the 
word that you used?

10
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:24,741
A Leicester Land and uh,
it felt hopeless,

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,270
like if people don't know what I'm 
talking about because you just give like

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,113
a brief synopsis of the way you were 
describing how completely completely 

13
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:35,994
rigged our election system is and what 
it actually takes to be elected and how 

14
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:47,481
much of the time they spend is involved 
in raising money and why.

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,343
Yeah.
So we've got a system where we have a 

16
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:52,554
money primary and then we have a regular
election and in the money primary to 

17
00:00:57,061 --> 00:01:00,660
compete,
you gotta raise tons of money to be able

18
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:01,860
to fund your campaign.

19
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,430
And when you raise that money you raise 
it from a tiny,

20
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:06,264
tiny fraction of the one percent.
So unless in the Ted talk about lesser 

21
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:10,344
known and I said,
you know,

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,680
imagine a place called Lester land where
basically it's the lesters who rule.

23
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:19,823
And by the lesters I mean the same 
proportion of people named Lester as in 

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,170
the United States right now.
So there's about 150,000

25
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,180
Americans named Lester.
I'm one of them.

26
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,690
But here we are,
the Leicester.

27
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:32,100
So imagine a world ruled by Lester land,
um,

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,353
because that's essentially the world we 
have because of the way we fund our 

29
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:38,544
campaigns because there's about 150,000
men who give even just the maximum 

30
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:44,874
contribution to one political candidate.
And if you ask who the number of people 

31
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:52,260
who give the maximum contribution over 
the course of a campaign,

32
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:54,000
meaning in the primary and the general 
election,

33
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:54,834
it's about 22,000
Americans in 2014 who gave them maximum 

34
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:01,340
contribution to one political campaigns.

35
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,340
So what that means is it's a tiny,
tiny fraction who are the most important

36
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,710
funders of political campaigns and 
candidates for Congress.

37
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,750
Members of Congress spend 30 to 70 
percent of their time sucking up to this

38
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:18,690
tiny,
tiny fraction.

39
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,943
And so is it any surprise that you see 
congress bending over backwards to keep 

40
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:28,440
those guys happy?
Because they know without those people,

41
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,410
they don't have a shot at getting back 
into congress.

42
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,950
And the way you were describing it as 
when you were saying it as lester land,

43
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,410
it was like,
imagine if we were this screwed up.

44
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,440
That was essentially what you're saying.
Yeah.

45
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,550
But we're more screwed up lester land.
Yeah,

46
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,463
we're more.
That was a disturbing video because I 

47
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:49,020
was realized there was emerging as you 
were speaking.

48
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:50,130
I was like,
wait a minute,

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,310
is it that bad?
Yeah.

50
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,690
You know,
it's,

51
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,120
I actually,
since that video have come to think it's

52
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,260
even worse.

53
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,740
So like clearance land.
Well,

54
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,440
it could be worse because it's even 
smaller number.

55
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:09,310
And if you look at the number of Super 
Pac donors,

56
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:11,040
you know,
the really critical super packed hundred

57
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,883
about a hundred people who gave more 
than half of the Super Pac money in the 

58
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,250
last presidential election.
100,

59
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,390
you know,
so this is a really tiny,

60
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:20,580
tiny number.
Um,

61
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,023
but what this tiny number represents and
the way we fund campaigns is the 

62
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:28,660
extraordinary inequality on that 
dimension,

63
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,490
right?
But since,

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,353
since I was focused on the money,
I've more recently started thinking 

65
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,720
about the other screwed up dimension.
So think about gerrymandering.

66
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,360
You know,
we gerrymander districts in America,

67
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:41,194
so that about 85 percent of the house 
seats in the United States Congress are 

68
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:46,894
safe seats,
which means if you're a republican in a 

69
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,560
safe seat,
democratic district,

70
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,740
your views just never mattered to the 
Congressperson,

71
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,593
cause that vote of a Republican will 
never determine who's in Congress or a 

72
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:01,180
Democrat and Republican district.

73
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,680
That's the same.
Okay,

74
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:07,270
but that doesn't mean those congress 
people are not afraid about reelection.

75
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,313
Of course,
they are afraid about whether there'll 

76
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:09,874
be reluctant,
but they're afraid not of a Democrat 

77
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:12,604
running against a Republican,
they afraid of an even more extreme 

78
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:17,800
republican running against the incumbent
Republican.

79
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:18,634
So what those incumbents in those safe 
seat districts do is they obsess about 

80
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:28,000
what the extremists in their own party 
cares about.

81
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,133
So the extremists on the left and the 
right have this ability to leverage 

82
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:34,594
extraordinary influence inside of the 
House of Representatives simply because 

83
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:42,070
we've decided to gerrymander these 
districts to create these safe seats.

84
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,950
So those extremists are a kind of 
lester's too.

85
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,940
There are more of them,
a more democratic than lester land,

86
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,253
but they too have enormous influence 
over ordinary people in most ordinary 

87
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:55,780
people's views.
Then to these congress people just don't

88
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:56,614
matter.
That feels hopeless for a dummy like me 

89
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,740
sit on the outside looking at this,
I'm like,

90
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:07,741
God,
if this is this deeply entrenched with.

91
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,220
I mean I guess it's not technically 
corruption because it's all legal,

92
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,000
but it's an entanglement with money and 
with influence that.

93
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,960
I mean,
how do you unwind this?

94
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,360
Yeah.
So that point is really critical.

95
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,420
It's not technically illegal and what 
that means is that people are engaged in

96
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:34,390
this or not doing wrong things.
They're just playing by the rules,

97
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,433
their plan with the system.
It's just that the system has become 

98
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,240
corrupted.
When did it start?

99
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,363
Well,
I think that the moment the United 

100
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,030
States Congress begins to fall apart in 
a really dramatic and interesting way is

101
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,460
when Newt Gingrich becomes speaker of 
the house.

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,020
So when the Republicans take control of 
Congress in [inaudible] 95,

103
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,040
so the first time

104
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,873
the Republicans have taken control of 
the House of Representatives in 40 

105
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:01,364
years.
So the house becomes incredibly 

106
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:04,010
competitive.
Each election,

107
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,270
you know,
is up for grabs.

108
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,104
Who's going to control the house?
So Gingrich turns his members in the 

109
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:14,780
House into perpetual fundraisers.
It's basically we got raise the money to

110
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:18,770
defend ourselves next time around.
And then the Democrats followed suit.

111
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,633
So the Democrats turned their members 
into perpetual fundraisers and they 

112
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:25,550
changed the rules about like,
who gets to be chairman of committees?

113
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,070
It's no longer like who's the person 
with the most experience,

114
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:28,904
with the most insight increasingly 
becomes who raises the most money and 

115
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:34,790
the Democratic Party.
I know about the Democratic Party.

116
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,624
The Republicans don't talk to me much,
but the Democratic Party increasingly 

117
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:38,444
changes its focus from what are the 
policies that our members care about 

118
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:44,834
too.
What are we going to do to make sure 

119
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:48,770
that you as a member meet your 
fundraising target?

120
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,993
And so from 95 until today,
the institution becomes an institution 

121
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:58,130
focused on the game of getting 
reelected.

122
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,043
I'm Jim Cooper,
a Democrat from Tennessee who went to 

123
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,000
Congress first in 1983.
So He's been there for a long time.

124
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,333
Um,
Cooper says Capitol Hill has become a 

125
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,510
kind of farm league forK street.
Okay.

126
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:13,610
So what he means by that is members go 
there,

127
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,453
they learn how to raise money,
they become focused obsessively on 

128
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,473
raising money.
But one of the things that they're 

129
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:22,250
really focused on,
it's how do they go from Capitol Hill to

130
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:25,310
becoming a lobbyist because that's where
the real money is.

131
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,250
A member of Congress gets paid about as 
much as the students.

132
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:32,100
I educate at the Harvard law school in 
their first year as Lawyers Co.

133
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,280
So to ordinary americans,
there's a lot of money,

134
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:36,800
but two people on capitol hill,
it doesn't seem like a lot of money,

135
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,750
but then they go and become a lobbyist.

136
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,060
They can make 10 timeS that as a 
lobbyist.

137
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,493
And so what cooper says is you have this
institution which has become so focused 

138
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:51,281
on the money that it's just a 
institution for producing influence that

139
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:54,164
can be sold.
And first the congressmen are basically 

140
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,003
sucking up to the people who wAnt to buy
influence and then the congressman 

141
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:01,304
become the people buying influence 
themselves because they're working as 

142
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:07,880
lobbyists for these important interests.
So they're in the rigged game.

143
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:10,760
They understand how it gets rigged and 
they work to rig it.

144
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

145
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,770
They see,
they see this as their,

146
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,770
their business plan.
It's their honeypot.

147
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,360
Yeah.
And there is,

148
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,203
um,
whatever the district is outside of 

149
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:20,534
Washington dc and Virginia,
where there's some ungodly number of 

150
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:26,510
wealthy people per capita where there's 
more,

151
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,110
there's more lobbyists in that area than
anywhere else in the United States.

152
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,860
And that's this giant collection of 
wealth,

153
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,610
right?

154
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,520
Washington dc is an incredibly 
prosperous place.

155
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,640
And anybody who's been there,
um,

156
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,533
you know,
for a long who've seen it for a long 

157
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,410
time,
like I,

158
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,950
I clerked there in the early 19 nineties
and it was pretty grungy place,

159
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,980
but it's a really opulent city now.
It's like the golden city on the hill,

160
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,603
you know the ahs and the reason for that
is the amount of money that's been 

161
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:57,474
poured into that district for the 
purpose of buying influence to buy 

162
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:01,404
legislation that makes it so these 
inCumbent dinosaur corporations that 

163
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:09,510
have protected themselves against 
competition across tHe country can,

164
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,490
can,
can continue to profit.

165
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,700
It's a weird place though because even 
though it's incredibly wealthy,

166
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:19,300
it's also incredibly poor.
There's a vast different extra.

167
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,390
The spectrum is really wide because,
I mean that was when in the nineties was

168
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,830
that.
That's the marion barry time,

169
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:26,664
right?
Yeah.

170
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,533
so that was when,
I mean he won as mayor again when he 

171
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:34,560
came back after being arrested for 
smoking crack and people are like,

172
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:37,880
whatever little crack.
Yeah.

173
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,190
It was an ugly place.
That and it's becoming,

174
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,860
you know,
grotesque place now from the,

175
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,260
from the standpoint of the principles of
what america's supposed to be.

176
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,120
yeah.
Because the privilege.

177
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:48,954
There are not people who are privileged 
because they've elon musk like and 

178
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,813
rented a great new product or they've 
worked incredibly hard and competitive 

179
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:58,104
marketplace and succeeded.
They're privileged because they've 

180
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,224
leveraged influence in a corrupt system 
to to profit and the people who are 

181
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:10,170
failing their,
you know,

182
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,200
a lot of reasons they're failing is just
we don't have a competitive,

183
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,160
powerful economy that gives them the 
opportunities right now because that,

184
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,710
that district,
Washington dc,

185
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,553
because it's got no effective 
representation is one of the worst 

186
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,770
represented districts in the country.

187
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,993
So essentially this all started out with
new green gingrich's group and they 

188
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,603
decided to spend so much time 
concentrating on fundraising and then 

189
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:36,000
once that became successful,
everyone else followed suit.

190
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:36,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

191
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,990
So the game became no longer how do we 
legislate for America,

192
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,333
but how do we rally our troops to raise 
the money we need to win in the next 

193
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:45,690
election?
The game is just about the election.

194
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,381
I mean,
you know,

195
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:48,870
my,
my mother lives in hilton head,

196
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,480
which is of course a very republican 
district,

197
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,340
but they elected their first democrat,
Joe Cunningham and joe.

198
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,920
My moTher loved him and wanted to 
support him.

199
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:00,260
My mother is a republican,
but here he was.

200
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,103
She wanted to support a democrat.
So I sent a check for on her behalf to 

201
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:06,780
this democrat,
the day he was elected,

202
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,660
he started raising money for the next 
election,

203
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,973
his whole focus from that moment on and 
now we started a big membership 

204
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:14,094
organization or are they going to get 
members to sort of help him sort of get 

205
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,090
back to congress the next time around.

206
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,953
Their sole focus is the elections.
And this is really different in the 19 

207
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:25,230
eighties,
you know,

208
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:27,630
they would go to Washington for 18 
months,

209
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:28,464
they would do the work of governing and 
then for six months they do the work of 

210
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,800
politicking.
Um,

211
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,713
so,
you know,

212
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,223
to a year and a half they could figure 
out how to solve the problems of 

213
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,154
America.
And then for half a year they figured 

214
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:42,060
out how to get reelected.
That's no longer the game.

215
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,020
The game now is from day one.
How do we raise the funds?

216
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:47,850
We need to make sure we can get 
reelected.

217
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,193
Um,
and with the democrats extraordinary 

218
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:53,800
turnaround in this last election,
you be damn sure.

219
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:54,070
That's

220
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,640
exactly the obsessive focus that we'll 
be going into 20 slash 20.

221
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,940
And if there's no other viable 
alternative,

222
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:05,230
this is a game that they have to play,
good people have to play at this point.

223
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:07,240
It's not like you can have the good 
people who say,

224
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,463
I'm not going to play this game.
I mean there are some famous people who 

225
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,710
Can say,
I'm not going to play this game.

226
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,940
Know alexandria,
occasional cortez.

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,070
I mean she doesn't have to raise money,
I'm sure,

228
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,930
and people on the right to you know,
who are the famous people in,

229
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,930
right?
They don't have to worry about this,

230
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:27,931
but the ordinary congress person knows,
given the way the system is right now,

231
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,043
they've got an obsessive focus on how to
raise money in what they know that that 

232
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:37,210
means is they develop a sixth sense,
a constant awareness about how what they

233
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:39,580
do will affect their ability to raise 
money,

234
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,430
becoming the words of the x files,
shape shifters,

235
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,713
as they constantly adjust their views in
light of what they know will help them 

236
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:46,954
to raise money.

237
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,273
There was a congressman leslie burned 
democrat from Virginia who describes 

238
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:53,320
that when she went to congress,
she was told by a colleague,

239
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,610
quote always leaned to the green than to
clarify.

240
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,301
She went on,
you know,

241
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:01,770
he was not an environmentalist.
So the point is like,

242
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,703
you know,
in your heart of hearts which way you 

243
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:08,590
got to go to make sure,
and if you're good and you're smart,

244
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:11,110
you'd never say anything to indicate it,
but it's operating,

245
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,280
but sometimes you're not so smart.
So in the tax bill,

246
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,890
the leading up to the passage of the 
last tax cut,

247
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,180
the one point $6,000,000,000,000
gift to corporations and wealthy people,

248
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:26,050
primarily a congressman,
New York stood on the floor of the house

249
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:26,770
and said,
you know,

250
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:30,310
my donors have told me that if we don't 
deliver on this,

251
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,310
I should never call him again.
I should never call them again.

252
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,060
So it's basically as simple and clear as
possible.

253
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:40,210
You don't reduce our taxes.
Don't ever ask us for more money.

254
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,720
And that's the reality of what 
Washington has become.

255
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,483
Now once this gets started and it moves 
in this direction that we don't have a 

256
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:50,224
long history of this to understand the,
the waves and the ins and the outs of 

257
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:55,150
the tide,
it just,

258
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,870
this is just what it is and it keeps 
moving in the same general direction.

259
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,180
How would that,
that ever stop?

260
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,253
How would there ever be some sort of 
reform that puts this back into a 

261
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,520
position where it makes sense and it's 
tenable?

262
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,960
Yeah.
So you know,

263
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,000
I've been in this business for about 12 
years now in the business of like trying

264
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:18,001
to figure out what can we do to reform 
this corrupted system and you know,

265
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:21,880
part of me feels as you said,
like it's hopeless,

266
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:22,714
but part of me feels like it's the most 
hopeful moments we've seen because like 

267
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,200
a decade ago when I would go around and 
say,

268
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,034
you know,
we got this really corrupted system and 

269
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:31,834
like money is people saying no,
when you talk about we just have to 

270
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,850
focus on getting the people we want 
elected.

271
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,450
And if we get the people we want to like
it,

272
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:42,640
we'll get the policies.
We're past now,

273
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,310
almost everybody realizes that until we 
fix this broken congress,

274
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,683
nothing else can happen.
So it's not like this is the most 

275
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,250
important

276
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,270
issue out there.
You know,

277
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:54,104
you could think climate change or 
healthcare or jobs or comp competitive 

278
00:14:56,531 --> 00:14:57,364
mode,
you could think those are the important 

279
00:14:58,191 --> 00:14:59,024
issues.
But what people are increasingly seeing 

280
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:04,340
is that this is the first issue.
If we don't fix this,

281
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,713
we don't fix anything.
And what's really encouraging to me is 

282
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:13,961
that that frame is increasingly being 
embraced by important leaders.

283
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:14,920
So,
you know,

284
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,803
about six years ago,
I think nancy pelosi was on jon 

285
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:21,890
stewart's show,
the daily show,

286
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,390
and stuart said,
you know,

287
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,460
the whole system is corrupt.
And nancy pelosi's no,

288
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:25,700
no,
no,

289
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,120
the system's not corrupt.
People in the system are corrupt,

290
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:29,954
but the system is not corrupt.
And jon stewart just had a field day 

291
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:34,280
because of how ridiculous that statement
is now.

292
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:38,810
But now nancy polosi is gonna introduce 
this hr one,

293
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,933
the most ambitious and comprehensive 
reform package that Washington I think 

294
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:48,560
has ever seen.

295
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,310
I mean,
it is unbelievable in its breadth.

296
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,583
Um,
so it has public funding of 

297
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:58,190
congressional campaigns.
So that congressmen don't spend 30 to 70

298
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,100
percent of their time sucking up to the 
lesters.

299
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,380
It has a mandate to end gerrymandering,
political partisan gerrymandering,

300
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,920
exercising congress's power under the 
constitution to tell the states,

301
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:13,190
clean this mess up.
It has an incredible,

302
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,850
um,
ethics package to kind of close,

303
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,870
block the revolving door.
So congressmen are not running off the k

304
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:24,920
street and it has an incredible 
restoration of voting rights.

305
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:27,500
The rest voter,
a restoration of voting rights act,

306
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:28,334
automatic voter registration.
It's the most comprehensive package of 

307
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,413
political reform,
I think the civil rights bill of the 

308
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:35,114
generation.
But of course nobody outside of 

309
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:37,454
Washington has heard anything about it 
because most people look at what 

310
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:41,504
Washington does and says it's just a 
game the democrats are playing to 

311
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:45,350
embarrass the republicans.

312
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,130
How will they stop congressmen from 
becoming lobbyists?

313
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,301
Well,
one thing,

314
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,330
they do a and then build loopholes into 
it,

315
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:55,580
but one thing they can do is they can 
basically say,

316
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,850
um,
once your congressman,

317
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,910
you can't be a lobbyist for five years 
and five years or whatever the time is.

318
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,010
But the more fundamental factors,
you know,

319
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,560
if you change the way you fund 
campaigns,

320
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,493
if it was no longer the lobbyists who 
are kind of channeling the money in or 

321
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:15,590
that we're getting their clients to 
channel the money and then it's not like

322
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:18,980
there wouldn't be lobbyists anymore,
they just wouldn't be so well paid.

323
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,550
They wouldn't be as valuable.
And if they're not as valuable,

324
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:23,384
it's not as valuable for them to pay the
congressmen and incredible amount of 

325
00:17:25,761 --> 00:17:27,880
money to become a lobbyist.
You know,

326
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,723
they would become almost like lawyers 
policy wonks that kind of go to capitol 

327
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:32,654
hill and say,
here's what will happen if you adopt 

328
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:35,720
this legislation,
you know,

329
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,460
that's an important part of the process.

330
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,920
but they wouldn't be the mockers in the 
system.

331
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:42,320
They wouldn't be the people who called 
the shots.

332
00:17:42,321 --> 00:17:44,960
And so the value of their services would
fall.

333
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,280
And if the value of their services fell,
then it wouldn't so much sense to go and

334
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:51,114
become a lobbyist.
Maybe you'd come home and be a doctor 

335
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:53,724
again or come home and like be a 
businessperson again or do whatever you 

336
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:56,904
want back in your district.
So I think if you change the way you 

337
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:00,594
fund campaigns,
you would change 70 percent of the 

338
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:05,790
problem,
you would just fix it right then.

339
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,860
And these other things are good 
additions,

340
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:08,694
but not as critical.
But without changing the way you fund 

341
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:11,514
campaigns.
I think all of these other changes are 

342
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:15,450
relevant.
I just can't get over the money.

343
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,240
You always hear the phrase take money 
out of politics.

344
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:21,580
It's a constant phrase,
but that's not really possible now.

345
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,710
And I don't think it's really good point
isn't the point isn't to get money out.

346
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,680
The point is to get money that doesn't 
represent a tiny fraction of the special

347
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:35,460
interests controlling how congress 
people think.

348
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:36,294
So I think today a congressman from 
California rogue kahana is going to 

349
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,603
introduce a bill that he hopes will be 
eventually part of whatever this big 

350
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:45,264
reform packages that would create a way 
of funding campaigns where everybody 

351
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:52,450
gets a voucher or a set of vouchers.
you know,

352
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:53,303
seattle has done this for city elections
where everybody gets for $25 vouchers 

353
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,520
that are only usable to fund campaigns.
So a candidate comes around and tries to

354
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:03,654
persuade you to give him or her the 
voucher and then they take that voucher 

355
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,680
and they use it to fund campaigns.
Okay.

356
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,873
If roca han is bill passed and everybody
had vouchers to use to fund 

357
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:12,744
congressional campaigns and you know,
the idea is basically you take the 

358
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:17,004
rebate of the first $50 of your taxes,
which every american pays at least $50 

359
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:22,110
to the federal government.

360
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,943
You take that first $50,
you give it back and you give it in the 

361
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:25,254
form of a voucher and you say,
take this voucher and help fund 

362
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:28,914
campaigns with it.
Congressmen would still be raising 

363
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:31,914
money.
They'd still be spending a lot of time 

364
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,603
raising money,
but they wouldn't be raising money from 

365
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,590
the tiny fraction of the one percent.
They'd be raising money from everybody.

366
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,390
And so the point is that you would be 
using that money to spread the influence

367
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,553
in the way that democracy is supposed to
spread the influence to every american 

368
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:54,270
as opposed to the influence in a tiny,
tiny fraction of the one percent.

369
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,733
So that wouldn't get less money.
I think that could be more money in the 

370
00:19:58,021 --> 00:19:58,854
system,
but it wouldn't be corrupting money 

371
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,030
because it would be money that is 
democratically accountable,

372
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,283
but the lesters of the world would 
probably try to put the kibosh on that 

373
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:08,910
before it ever got movement.

374
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,361
Yeah.
I mean,

375
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:12,470
you know,
the biggest block to anything like hr,

376
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:13,304
one happening is that the most 
influential people in Washington have 

377
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:19,830
the most to lose,
right?

378
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,090
The lobbyists,
you know,

379
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:21,924
the value of the industry of lobbying 
just collapses and those people are 

380
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:29,970
going to fight like hell to block it.
Which is why as wonderful as it is to me

381
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:32,640
to see somebody like nancy polosi take 
up the charge and say,

382
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:33,474
here it is.
Here's a package of reform and it's 

383
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:37,410
going to be the first thing we do.
Fix democracy first.

384
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,150
What?
What's true?

385
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:43,830
What's obvious about this is without a 
president taking up the charge,

386
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,890
it's never gonna happen,
and what's most depressing to

387
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,570
is that right now in the democratic 
party,

388
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:50,404
you don't have any candidate for 
president who's making reform a even an 

389
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:57,010
important issue,
let alone a primary issue.

390
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,490
And of courSe we had a president who is 
elected under the drain,

391
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:01,324
the swamp slogan,
but of course nobody believes he has an 

392
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,790
implant or have any intent to do 
anything to drain that swamp.

393
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,313
Yeah.
I'm hoping that having him in office is 

394
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:15,520
such a that the whole thing was such a 
cluster fuck and that so many people are

395
00:21:15,521 --> 00:21:16,354
so disturbed that it's going to make 
people more politically active and more 

396
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:22,300
aware of the consequences of having 
someone like that in office.

397
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,263
Yeah.
And actually weirdly unifying because 

398
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,300
even though the democrats are not doing 
this right now,

399
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:33,850
which is really depressing to me,
you know,

400
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,753
we,
we have these things that we know we 

401
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:36,424
disagree about and we like fueled the 
politics of hate as we kind of yell at 

402
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:43,420
each other about these things.

403
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,410
BuT there's a set of issues that we all 
agree about and the,

404
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,353
and the most important set of issues we 
all agree about is the deeply corrupted 

405
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,144
nature of this government.
And there was a poll done by university 

406
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:55,550
of Maryland,
the middle of 2016,

407
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,883
asking about anger and frustration with 
government found the highest level of 

408
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:05,020
frustration in the history of polling.
And then when they asked the reasons why

409
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:07,660
they were so angry and so disaffected 
with their government,

410
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,350
the reasons people gave were all the 
same things like the influence of money,

411
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:14,800
the influence of lobbyists,
the parties care more about corporations

412
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:15,634
and about.
And then then we broke them down about 

413
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,500
how to republicans think about this and 
how the democrats think about this.

414
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:24,010
There was no statistical difference 
between republicans and democrats.

415
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,413
you know,
sometimes the democrats were more 

416
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,124
concerned.
Sometimes the republicans and the 

417
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:31,030
levels,
we're at like 80 and 90 percent.

418
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:31,863
So literally 84 percent of americans 
would say it is big money that is 

419
00:22:34,961 --> 00:22:37,690
corrupting the way our congress 
functions.

420
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:39,670
Right?
So here is common ground.

421
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,253
And what was so extraordinarY about the 
2016 election is watched a republican 

422
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:49,030
candidates stand on a debate stage.
In september of twentY 15,

423
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,133
Donald Trump stood on a debate stage and
pointed to every one of those kennedy's 

424
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:53,470
and said,
I own all of you.

425
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,333
I've given all of you money and I know 
The way the system works and the system 

426
00:22:56,891 --> 00:22:57,724
is corrupt and he called super pacs and 
abomination and he attacked the idea of 

427
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:06,271
money in politics and so what that 
signaled is that republicans to could be

428
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:11,440
rallied to this cause of addressing this
deeply corrupted political system.

429
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,740
If only we could find the candidates who
would do it,

430
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:19,420
and I think what Donald Trump has done 
is teed up this moment where we can step

431
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:20,111
back and say,
look,

432
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:24,910
we disagree about a lot of things,
whether it's gmo or climate change,

433
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:27,250
whether it's healthcare for all or 
college for all,

434
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:28,760
whatever.
We disagree about a loving.

435
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,560
We got to work a lot of things out.
But here is something we all agree about

436
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,190
and we should be smart enough to realize
if we don't fix this,

437
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,940
the none of the things we're arguing 
about matter.

438
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:40,960
You know,
you can't.

439
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,793
It's not serious to stand on a debate 
stage and say you you support single 

440
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:46,214
payer healthcare

441
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,103
without also saying,
but first we're going to fix this 

442
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:50,384
corrupted system because there's no way 
to get single payer healthcare in a 

443
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:54,254
world where doctors and pharmaceutical 
companies and insurance companies are 

444
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:57,644
funding elections.
You can't say you're goIng to get 

445
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:00,134
climate change legislation in America 
without addressing the corrupting 

446
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:04,634
influence of money in politics because 
the oil camp that the dirty energy 

447
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:11,630
industry has an enormous opportunity to 
block this,

448
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:13,710
changed through the way we fund 
campaign.

449
00:24:13,711 --> 00:24:14,544
So this is a moment where we should be 
able to get everybody in this political 

450
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:19,670
system to step back and say,
hey,

451
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:22,070
wait.
The system is broken.

452
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:22,904
We can see as broken.
The first thing we have to do is to fix 

453
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,220
the broken congress,
and if we fix that congress,

454
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,593
then we have a chance to have an 
argument about what policy makes sense 

455
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:33,770
for America.
And we each have our views,

456
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:34,970
but no views are different.

457
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,880
But the thing we don't agree about,
we should be able to agree on.

458
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,493
Now,
if that's a universal agreement amongst 

459
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:41,864
republicans and democrats,
that funding and that money and that 

460
00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:47,750
all,
all of this is what's ruining politics.

461
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,740
The people that are donating all this 
moneY,

462
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,070
the,
these,

463
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:57,980
the lesters of the world,
what could they possibly do to stop this

464
00:24:57,981 --> 00:25:01,550
reform and what's their reaction to this
kind of reform?

465
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,450
Yeah.
YeAh.

466
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,610
So let me be clear about one really 
important thing.

467
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,640
I,
when I say republicans and democrats,

468
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:11,090
what I mean as people in the districts 
across America,

469
00:25:11,091 --> 00:25:14,990
I don't mean in Washington like mitch 
mcconnell is,

470
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,330
I think the focus of evil in the modern 
world.

471
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,830
Mitch mcconnell will block any reform 
here at all.

472
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:22,341
So,
you know,

473
00:25:22,341 --> 00:25:23,174
nancy polozi can offer what she wants,
but it'll never get through the senate 

474
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:28,380
because mitch mcconnell and so there are
many republicans in Washington.

475
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,440
We're going to block any reform.
But,

476
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,760
um,
but when you ask,

477
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:32,594
you know,
the republicans in Washington and the 

478
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,130
lesters,
what can they do to stop it?

479
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,170
Well,
the game,

480
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,110
the game strategy's clear,
they've deployed it before,

481
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,073
right?
So,

482
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,990
um,
you know,

483
00:25:43,991 --> 00:25:45,320
they'll,
they'll say things like,

484
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:48,890
this is welfare for politicians.
Um,

485
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,920
this is just corrupting free speech.
You don't believe in the first amendment

486
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:58,460
if you don't believe that the koch 
brothers or the soros is,

487
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:02,000
have the right to spend unlimited 
amounts of money and political speech.

488
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,380
Um,
and so I think the Way around that fight

489
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,453
is to agree free speech is the 
fundamental value and nothing of the 

490
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:16,820
reforms I support would like try to 
restrict people's ability to speak.

491
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,480
What we're talking about is congressman 
raising money.

492
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,540
We're not talking about inDividuals 
speaking in the marketplaCe.

493
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,950
So you have a very loud voice.

494
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,783
Joe,
your voice is heard by millions and 

495
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,083
nothing in our constitution should 
permit the goVernment to be able to 

496
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,593
suppress you at all,
so long as you're within the bounds of 

497
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:39,680
decency or at least not decency because 
that's not a bound boundary.

498
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,730
This thought guests obeys often,
but at least if you're not,

499
00:26:43,731 --> 00:26:45,780
you know,
spreading false rumors and causing great

500
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,640
harm.
But the point is,

501
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,780
even though this free speech needs to be
protected,

502
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,490
we still should be able to focus on the 
influence,

503
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:57,324
the economy of influence congressmen 
live under when they spend 30 to 70 

504
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:04,980
percent of the time sucking up to the 
lesters to fund their campaigns.

505
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,173
That should be a focus of regulation 
without the first amendment getting in 

506
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,194
the way because we want to.
Congress filled with people who care 

507
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:12,924
about what their voters want now with 
their funders want the framers didn't 

508
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:20,640
create a constitution to replicate an 
aristocracy.

509
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,473
They were fighting and aristocracy.
They had a system where there was a 

510
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:24,984
house,
the house of lords that had to ask the 

511
00:27:27,061 --> 00:27:28,560
aristocracy,
what do you want?

512
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,860
And everything could be blocked if the 
aristocracy didn't like it.

513
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:32,694
Well,
we've replicated that system more 

514
00:27:33,931 --> 00:27:36,300
efficiently in America than they had 
there.

515
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,313
Because we have a system where both the 
house of representatives and the senate 

516
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:40,763
is filled with people who are obsessed 
with a single question what to my 

517
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:45,144
funders want?
And if they can't answer that question 

518
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,693
in a way that supports the legislation 
and they're not going to support the 

519
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:53,634
legislation,
or if it's important for them to block 

520
00:27:55,471 --> 00:27:57,300
legislation,
they will block legislation.

521
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,760
And that's the dynamic of Washington 
right now.

522
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,870
Francis fukuyama describes our 
government as a veto ocracy veto ocracy.

523
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,430
And what he means by that is that 
there's so many places were influenced.

524
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,293
Powerful influence can block the ability
of the government to do something that 

525
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:17,490
it just can't do anything anymore.
And that's,

526
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,803
I think,
the consequence of allowing this 

527
00:28:20,671 --> 00:28:25,260
corruption of money to be so deeply 
woven into our political system.

528
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,350
Is it possible to fix?
Yeah,

529
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,460
it is possible to fix because you know,
for,

530
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,470
for example,
hr one plus roca,

531
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:38,820
honda's bill all perfectly 
constitutional.

532
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:40,410
You wouldn't have to amend the 
constitution to do it.

533
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:44,700
I think that bill alone would solve 80 
percent of the problem.

534
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,013
The possibility.
The problem isn't like conceiving of 

535
00:28:47,431 --> 00:28:48,264
what changes have to happen.
The question is how do you build the 

536
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:50,844
political movement to get there?
And what that takes is leaders willing 

537
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:54,594
to say,
we have to fix this corrupted democracy 

538
00:28:57,931 --> 00:29:00,600
first.
And leaders who stopped,

539
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,453
like pretending that we can get like a 
christmas list of great changes in 

540
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:08,970
government without fixing this democracy
first.

541
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,391
So,
you know,

542
00:29:09,391 --> 00:29:10,224
bernie published last month in the 
Washington post list of the 10 things 

543
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:16,104
that should happen in the first hundred 
days in the next democratic 

544
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:20,730
administration.
10 great ideas.

545
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,410
Not a single one of those ideas address 
the corruption of our political system.

546
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,553
You,
it was just,

547
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,250
it was just a christmas list of all the 
things that the progressives want.

548
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:31,320
Did you know,
I'm a progressive.

549
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:32,154
I want some of those things.
But the point is like what things were 

550
00:29:33,991 --> 00:29:34,390
the,
well,

551
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:35,223
you know,
things like a trillion dollar 

552
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:39,930
infrastructure project,
single pair healthcare free college,

553
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:40,801
um,
you know,

554
00:29:40,801 --> 00:29:41,634
all things that bernie is pushing,
it has made so salad and things that I 

555
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:46,240
think it's great that he has made sale 
yet.

556
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,340
I mean,
he's a hero and like making these issues

557
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:49,174
central to at least the debate.
But what frustrates me is that instead 

558
00:29:54,281 --> 00:29:56,560
of focusing our anger on the 
billionaires,

559
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,394
which he does,
we need to focus more anger on the 

560
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:01,210
congressman,
the politicians,

561
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:03,100
which he does not.
I mean,

562
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,440
the guy's been in congress romas 30 
years now,

563
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,280
and so it might be natural for him not 
to notice that the people around him are

564
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:10,114
the problem.

565
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,023
Is it a natural thing or do you think 
that he's possibly aware of the 

566
00:30:14,661 --> 00:30:17,720
consequences of stirring up that hornets
nest?

567
00:30:17,721 --> 00:30:20,600
Because you know,
if anybody has a right to complain,

568
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,920
when the dnc conspired to rig the 
primaries against him,

569
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:25,754
he's the number one guy.
He should be screaming from the 

570
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:29,690
rooftops.
YoU're dealing with a corrupt system and

571
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:31,310
thiS is disgusting.
and he didn't.

572
00:30:31,311 --> 00:30:32,144
He didn't do that,
and he didn't do that while hillary 

573
00:30:34,371 --> 00:30:36,620
clinton was running for president and he
knew it.

574
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,290
He knew he hAd been screwed out of the 
primaries.

575
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,290
He knew they had conspired,
he knew it was all illegal,

576
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,750
and he kind of just kept his mouth shut.

577
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,421
Yeah,
well,

578
00:30:45,421 --> 00:30:46,254
I think,
you know,

579
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,900
that was a responsibility.
I think that was a kind of.

580
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,113
I was a person reflecting on the 
horrendous outcome if he took hillary 

581
00:30:57,211 --> 00:31:00,060
clinton down,
and so I think he restrained himself,

582
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,350
you know,
not perfectly.

583
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,041
I mean,
the fact is,

584
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:04,290
after it was clear he was not going to 
be the nominee,

585
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:07,710
he still continued to talk about the 
corruption around hillary,

586
00:31:07,711 --> 00:31:11,730
which donald then picked up and turned 
into a weapon against her.

587
00:31:11,731 --> 00:31:13,200
But I think he,
he recognized,

588
00:31:13,201 --> 00:31:14,034
you know,
as every responsible politician does 

589
00:31:15,571 --> 00:31:16,260
that,
you know,

590
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,440
it's not just about him,
it's about the future of America.

591
00:31:19,441 --> 00:31:22,530
So when he restrained himself and didn't
want to take the whole system down,

592
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:26,430
then I get that.
But what I'm talking about now,

593
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,773
I'm talking about when you've got the 
house of representatives talking about 

594
00:31:30,331 --> 00:31:33,180
fundamental reform,
it will be the first thing they take up.

595
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:36,750
We at least ought to have a presidential
campaign where candidates are saying,

596
00:31:36,751 --> 00:31:39,630
hell yes.
The first thing we will do is to end the

597
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:40,464
corruption that makes it impossible for 
this congress to function and stop 

598
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,034
pretending like we can get all these 
wonderful things given to us by santa 

599
00:31:48,271 --> 00:31:52,110
claus without fixing this first.
You gotta do the hard work of convincing

600
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:54,900
America that there is a solution because
you know,

601
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:55,783
the reality is,
I think most of America is where you 

602
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:57,983
started this podcast.
Most of America thinks it's deeply 

603
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:02,730
corrupted and there's nothing that can 
be done.

604
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,790
They're half right.
It is deeply corrupted,

605
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,070
but it's not true.
There's nothing that can be done.

606
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,830
We can do something.
And in fact,

607
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:14,460
I think we can solve almost 80 percent 
of it.

608
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:18,720
I still think there's constitutional 
changes that might be necessary.

609
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,583
And I've been working like how do we get
constitutional changes and talking to 

610
00:32:22,501 --> 00:32:23,510
people.
My,

611
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,913
my podcast,
which of course has about one 1000th of 

612
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,223
one,
1000000th of the people listening to 

613
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,870
yours does.
But what is your podcast?

614
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:32,640
So people can listen to it.
It's another Way.

615
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,773
so season two is released today,
which is about an article five 

616
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:36,774
convention,
but season one was about how to think 

617
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:40,110
about the 2020.
Um,

618
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,591
but you know,
I,

619
00:32:41,591 --> 00:32:42,424
I think that we might have to have 
constitutional change anD I have been 

620
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:47,330
supporting the efforts to think about 
that.

621
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:51,140
But while we've got to do is to give 
people a sense that there's something we

622
00:32:51,141 --> 00:32:54,910
Can do before we amend the constitution.
You know,

623
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,920
we did a poll and found 96 percent of 
americans believe it important to reduce

624
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:00,854
the influence of money in politics.
Ninety one percent didn't think it was 

625
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:06,110
possible.
So that's the politics of resignation.

626
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,473
If you'd gone to Egypt under mubarak and
he'd start the average person in the 

627
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:12,050
street and said,
you know,

628
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,550
what do you think?
I'm a bark.

629
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:14,750
They would've said,
you know,

630
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,090
we hate mubarak,
and then say,

631
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,180
well why aren't you doing anything about
it?

632
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:19,160
And they say,
because nothing can be done.

633
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,800
Or you know,
african americans in 1900 and America,

634
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,090
what do you think about jim crow?

635
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,000
We hate jim crow.
Why aren't you doing anything about it?

636
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:27,440
What?
Because there's nothing to be done about

637
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:27,681
it.
Well,

638
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:30,830
that's how americans think about this 
political corruption.

639
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,670
They hate it.
They think it's deeply unjust,

640
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,040
inconsistent with what they thought 
America was about.

641
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,743
But they don't do anything about it 
because they don't think there's 

642
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:44,750
anything to be done about it.
And that's where leaders have a role and

643
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:45,584
what we need our leaders running for 
president right now to begin to explain 

644
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:52,460
to people,
here's what we could do if only we built

645
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:53,294
the power to do it,
recognizing the most important 

646
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:57,494
opposition here.
The lobbyist in wAshington are going to 

647
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:02,930
be an incredibly difficult group to to 
defeat,

648
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,570
but we can do that.
And if we do that,

649
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,130
every other issue becomes easier to 
resolve in a sensible way.

650
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,010
Now there's no public support for 
lobbyists,

651
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,310
right?

652
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,143
There's no,
there's no people out there that are 

653
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:15,374
super psyched that lobbyists are out 
there and exerting their influence on 

654
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:19,814
our world.
But they obviously have enormous 

655
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:27,690
financial backing behind them and they 
have incredible influence in our,

656
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:32,570
in our culture.
But if you had some magic wand,

657
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,560
you could wave across this system and 
fix it,

658
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:40,790
wouldn't removing lobbyists be one of 
the first things that you would do?

659
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,900
No.
No.

660
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,983
Why?
Why so?

661
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:43,903
Well,
because look,

662
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,470
you know,
congress,

663
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,843
especially in the current government,
legislates on a whole bunch of issues 

664
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,833
that they don't have a clue about.
They don't know squat diddly about 99 

665
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:56,360
percent of what they're legislating 
amount.

666
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,523
They need information and one of the 
other things gingrich did was to 

667
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:05,270
completely macerate congress's own 
information service.

668
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:06,104
They used to have a really powerful 
information service to help congressmen 

669
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:10,220
figure things out.
All of that's basically gone,

670
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,540
so they rely on outsiders to come in and
help them understand it.

671
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,610
Now my view is,
you know,

672
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:17,444
that's an imperfect system because 
there's great inequality among the 

673
00:35:20,691 --> 00:35:21,524
quality of lobbyists,
but if all lobbyists were doing was 

674
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:28,220
providing information like congressmen,
here's what's going to happen.

675
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,113
If you pass this bill,
like these jobs will disappear or this 

676
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:36,830
lead will reappear in the water system 
if that's all they were doing.

677
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:38,220
That's really valuable thing.

678
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,083
Information to the congress to help 
congress decide what to do is an 

679
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:42,804
essential part of making democracy work.
The part of lobbying that is the 

680
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,690
corrupting part where they become the 
mockers for the money,

681
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,080
not so much that they give it directly,
but you know,

682
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:54,923
they call their clients and they say,
you need everybody at the c level in 

683
00:35:57,871 --> 00:35:59,940
your corporation.
Descend $2,700

684
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:04,260
to this person and they steer it like 
that when they become the kInd of source

685
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:09,261
of a resource for members of congress,
that's when they have thIs influence,

686
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,570
which is not related to their argument.
So you know,

687
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:16,350
I've met lobbyists who,
who hate the system as it is right now.

688
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,820
They'll say things like,
look,

689
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:21,120
I want a system where I win because my 
ideas are good,

690
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,523
my arguments are better.
I don't want a system where I win 

691
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:25,314
because I'm able to channel more money 
than that guy because that's not a 

692
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:28,914
democracy like at democracy should be.
These representatives are listening to 

693
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:32,034
us and then they do the right thing 
based on what they think helps their 

694
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:36,264
constituents,
not how much they're going to raise if 

695
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,180
they do this.
Over that.

696
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,490
How many lobbyists are there?
Oh man,

697
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,110
I can't answer that question.
You know,

698
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,333
one of the big problems we've got is 
that the law has been weakened in 

699
00:36:50,071 --> 00:36:52,260
registering lobbyists.
So,

700
00:36:52,261 --> 00:36:53,094
you know,
we have tens of thousands of people who 

701
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:54,984
are functioning effectively of the 
lobbyists but don't have to call 

702
00:36:56,731 --> 00:36:57,564
themselves lobbyists.
You have these members of congress who 

703
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:00,774
go to government relations departments 
and they oversee the government 

704
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:05,424
relations department as long as they 
don't go on to capitol hill and shake 

705
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:08,394
hands,
but instead set up the meetings on 

706
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:12,210
capitol hill with lower people,
shaking hands.

707
00:37:12,211 --> 00:37:15,690
They're not called lobbyists.
So if you look at the lobbying numbers,

708
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,524
it looks like we peaked in lobbying 
about three years ago and now are 

709
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:19,674
declining,
but what that is in fact is that the 

710
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:26,790
rules have been interpreted or allowed 
to be unenforced so that many people who

711
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:30,180
are lobbyists actually aren't actually 
functioning as lobbyists today.

712
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,223
So they are lobbyists,
but they don't wear the label is 

713
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:34,440
lobbyists.
What do they call themselves?

714
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,520
Government relations people.
Experts.

715
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,560
Yeah.
Um,

716
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:39,780
you know,
and they aren't.

717
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,690
They say they're not technically 
lobbyists.

718
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,410
And um,
you know,

719
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,850
I got into a huge fight with Scott 
Brown.

720
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:52,851
You remember Scott Brown who ran a for 
who was a senator in Massachusetts.

721
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,620
He ran under tea party ticket and it was
like this amazing republican to win as a

722
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:01,890
senator in Massachusetts.
And then Elizabeth Warren,

723
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,860
I'm defeated him in the,
in the,

724
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,770
in the election,
two years into his term,

725
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,343
he then went to Massachusetts to New 
Hampshire and ran for senate and I was 

726
00:38:12,811 --> 00:38:15,930
helping a republican in New Hampshire 
who was a reformer running for senate,

727
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:19,750
and we've referred to him as a lobbyist 
and he went ballistic.

728
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:21,030
He saId,
I'm not a lobbyist,

729
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:23,700
and then he said,
I'm not technically a lobbyist.

730
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,810
He's a government relations person who's
like calling people on capitol hill.

731
00:38:27,811 --> 00:38:30,420
He used to be with the senate trying to 
get them to do things for him,

732
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:34,410
but he hasn't quite a technical labia,
so merely because the irs wouldn't refer

733
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:35,244
to them as a lobbyist,
he thought it was outrageous and fraud 

734
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,920
for me to refer to them as what we all 
know he is,

735
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,250
which is a lobbyist.
So lobbyists,

736
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,560
being a lobbyist is not defined by your 
actions.

737
00:38:47,561 --> 00:38:48,394
It's defined by your label.
It's defined by did you have to fill 

738
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:55,750
something out to be alumni as well?
Once you are a lobbyist,

739
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,643
according to the law,
you've got all sorts of obligations of 

740
00:38:58,241 --> 00:39:01,150
reporting who you're spending your time 
with.

741
00:39:01,151 --> 00:39:03,580
What you're spending money on,
government relations,

742
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,013
government relations,
people at a certain level that do 

743
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:07,504
certain things aren't caught lobbyists,
but yet they have the exact same 

744
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:13,570
function even more because they've got 
tons of people working for them.

745
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:16,660
They can deploy in their,
in their work of doing lobbying.

746
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:21,640
How would that ever be?
How would you ever put a dam up there?

747
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,450
Well,
you know,

748
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,363
you only put a dam up there if you've 
got the political will to make it 

749
00:39:28,571 --> 00:39:29,404
happen,
right?

750
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,570
You only get the political will to make 
it happen.

751
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:32,404
If you have a political process that 
focuses America on this deeply 

752
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:37,360
corrupting problem and says,
god damn it,

753
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:40,630
we have to fix this,
and if you had that will,

754
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,190
if you said we're just going to fix 
this,

755
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:43,770
and you had like the,
you know,

756
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,740
the geeks then go down the list of 25 
things that have to happen to make it so

757
00:39:47,741 --> 00:39:48,574
we have our congress is worried about 
being representative of America as 

758
00:39:52,331 --> 00:39:55,870
opposed to representative of the lesters
in America.

759
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,960
We could do it.
it's not rocket science.

760
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,520
It really is not that hard.

761
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,330
You got to think carefully about what 
kind of incentives you're producing.

762
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:05,164
I'm not saying it's obvious.
We're not going to sketch the full plan 

763
00:40:07,451 --> 00:40:08,284
here,
but it's possible it is constitutional 

764
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:14,320
to do it and if we just built the 
political will to to get there,

765
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:16,600
we could do it and the only way build 
the political will.

766
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,560
It's really important right now because 
right now people,

767
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,693
especially people like you need to be 
saying to every one of the politicians 

768
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:25,504
who is going to be sucking up to try to 
be on your show to try to have a chance 

769
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:28,804
to get their voice out the class a few 
to the people who are listening to your 

770
00:40:31,481 --> 00:40:32,314
podcast.
It's important to people like you to 

771
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:33,761
say,
okay,

772
00:40:33,761 --> 00:40:35,230
what are you going to do about this 
problem,

773
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:39,460
this problem in particular?
Is it a priority or is it like one of 12

774
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,270
things on your list?

775
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,103
I mean,
I imagine it's 11 for bernie or 12 

776
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:44,440
somewhere,
but the question isn't,

777
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,470
isn't on the list because every one of 
them is going to say,

778
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,300
yeah,
of course I support reform.

779
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:51,910
The question is,
are you going to bring America around so

780
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:56,080
that America thinks on day one,
this is what will happen.

781
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,360
Whatever else happens,
this is going to happen,

782
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:03,810
and my view is if there were a democrat 
running for president who said,

783
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:06,040
look,
hold on,

784
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,173
we're going to fix this,
and the trumpers who were draining the 

785
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:11,104
swamp,
you know the 25 percent of that base 

786
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:13,594
that's drained the swamp is come with me
because that guy did not drain the 

787
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:18,790
swamp.
That guy filled the swamp.

788
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,123
Swamp monsters are bigger and more and 
more vital now than now than they ever 

789
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:25,300
were,
but come with me.

790
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:26,134
We actually will do it.
I think there's a way to break this 

791
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:29,224
election so that it becomes an election 
about the unity around this recognition 

792
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,123
rather than the disunity,
which is the screaming laughed against 

793
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:38,061
the screaming,
right,

794
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:38,990
which is the way things.

795
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:42,930
Now we're evolving to a person on sit 
down on the outside who doesn't have any

796
00:41:42,931 --> 00:41:43,764
involvement in politics like myself.
It seemed so unbelievably complicated 

797
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:50,880
that it is.
It exhausts you when you start examining

798
00:41:50,881 --> 00:41:53,550
it and trying to pay attention to it and
how the system will works.

799
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,330
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but in the recent past,

800
00:41:57,331 --> 00:42:01,530
there was something that was changed 
that allows corporations to donate money

801
00:42:01,531 --> 00:42:03,480
the same way that an individual would.

802
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:06,360
Right?
So in 2010,

803
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,583
the United States supreme court decided 
a case called citizens united and 

804
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:11,844
citizens united said that you couldn't 
limit limit a corporation's ability to 

805
00:42:15,871 --> 00:42:20,070
spend money independently of a political
campaign,

806
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,980
so corporations not allowed to 
contribute directly,

807
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,383
but that's not worth that much because 
you're only allowed to give a total of 

808
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:27,024
$5,400
to a candidate over the course of the 

809
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:29,964
life of his campaign.
But what citizens united said is that 

810
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:33,554
the constitution protects the right of 
the corporation to engage in political 

811
00:42:37,051 --> 00:42:39,270
speech independent of a political 
campaign.

812
00:42:39,271 --> 00:42:40,104
So if you know,
if some congressmen is running for 

813
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:42,834
congress,
exxon corporation can come in and spend 

814
00:42:45,241 --> 00:42:48,450
a million dollars to say why that 
congressman is a good congressman or why

815
00:42:48,451 --> 00:42:49,920
that congressmen the terrible 
congressman,

816
00:42:49,921 --> 00:42:51,660
but they have a constitutional right to 
do that.

817
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:52,800
Now,
when that happened,

818
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,600
there are a bunch of us who were chicken
littles about this,

819
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,463
who said this is the end of democracy 
because these corporations are just 

820
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,493
going to spend unbelievable amounts of 
money in the political process like 

821
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,050
spending their money to effect the 
results,

822
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:07,943
and that was not correct because what 
happened is corporations quickly 

823
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,110
discovered the high price of free 
speech,

824
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:16,470
right?

825
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,640
So corporations like target back day,
uh,

826
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,573
anti gay candidate for governor and all 
of a sudden found their stores being 

827
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:28,403
picketed across the country because 
people were furious that they would be 

828
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:32,790
supporting such a candidate for 
governor.

829
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:33,624
So corporates to quickly found that it's
not cheap to engage in political speech 

830
00:43:36,991 --> 00:43:38,670
in the marketplace.
They didn't want to do it like that.

831
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:39,863
Instead,
they wanted to find a way to channel 

832
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:45,951
their money into dark money 
organizations or into what evolved after

833
00:43:46,951 --> 00:43:49,020
citizens united,
something called super pacs.

834
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,230
Super pacs were created not by the 
supreme court.

835
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,860
Superpacs were created by a lower court 
that said,

836
00:43:55,861 --> 00:43:56,694
well,
if you can spend unlimited amounts of 

837
00:43:58,111 --> 00:43:58,944
money,
you should be allowed to give unlimited 

838
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:04,050
amounts of money to an independent 
political action committee.

839
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:09,230
That was the super pac supreme court has
never ruled on that question.

840
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,543
We have a case that we're taking up to 
Alaska that's trying to appeal to the 

841
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:15,954
supreme court to get them to actually 
decide whether super pacs are mandated 

842
00:44:19,231 --> 00:44:20,064
by the constitution,
and what's different about this case as 

843
00:44:22,231 --> 00:44:25,320
the argument we're making is to the 
conservatives.

844
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,590
What we're saying is the framers of our 
constitution,

845
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,513
we're obsessed with corruption.
That was the issue they were 

846
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:35,700
overwhelmingly trying to avoid and they 
weren't focused on bribery.

847
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,520
They were focused on institutional 
corruption.

848
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:39,354
These institutions.
It became unconnected to their purpose 

849
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:42,803
representing americans and what our view
is is you know these conservatives on 

850
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:47,184
the supreme court,
like neil gorsuch or justice thomas or 

851
00:44:51,451 --> 00:44:52,284
brett kavanaugh,
who say that we interpret the 

852
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:56,250
constitution of the way the framers 
would have interpreted it.

853
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,050
We're going to make the argument to 
them,

854
00:44:58,051 --> 00:45:01,770
which is there is no doubt the framers 
of the constitution would have looked at

855
00:45:01,771 --> 00:45:04,350
these super pacs and said,
these are an abomination.

856
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:05,783
These are outrageous from the 
perspective of that democracy they were 

857
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:10,044
trying to create and those justices 
should at least one of them be willing 

858
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:15,504
to stand up and defend the framers 
values against this modern corruption 

859
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,323
and if just one of them voted with the 
four liberals who've already said they 

860
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:26,034
think super pacs are an abomination,
then we could have a way to end the 

861
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:30,654
superpacs in this system and that and 
that would be an enormous benefit 

862
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:39,060
because they've become so powerful,
but the courts alone can't save us.

863
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,673
Even If you ended superpacs tomorrow,
you still have lester land because the 

864
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:48,900
super pacs are not what I was talking 
about and less julian when I was talking

865
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:49,734
about less.
Julian was giving two candidates 

866
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:51,894
directly and the small number of people 
would still be giving two candidates 

867
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:59,781
directly and the only way to solve that 
is for congress to pass new laws.

868
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:02,010
That changed the way campaigns get 
funded.

869
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:03,443
That's the sort of thing hr one is 
trying to do as a sort of thing roca 

870
00:46:05,851 --> 00:46:06,684
honda's trying to do with.
That's the sort of thing that we don't 

871
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:09,564
have a precedent to support right now.
We don't have democratic presidential 

872
00:46:11,491 --> 00:46:12,324
candidates who are making it the 
champion issue right now and it won't 

873
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:16,290
get done unless they do,

874
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:17,243
but it seems complicated to people when 
you try to explain campaign finance and 

875
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:22,014
you try to explain contributions to 
candidates and contributions to sitting 

876
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:27,240
senators and congressmen.
It's.

877
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,133
It's complicated and there's so many 
different things to think about when 

878
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:33,690
you're discussing this that to a person 
who's on the outside,

879
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:35,220
well,
how do you fix this?

880
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:37,110
Well,
what are the laws now?

881
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,670
Well,
how did they get that way?

882
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:39,780
Well,
well,

883
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,713
well how about make it so they can't 
give them money and there's all these 

884
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:45,600
like real simplistic views of it from 
the outside,

885
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:46,973
but it seems that it at the very least 
limiting the amount of money that 

886
00:46:51,631 --> 00:46:53,880
someone's a lot.
Like what is the maximum amount of money

887
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:54,860
someone can give to a county

888
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:57,880
right now in the primary and the 
general.

889
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:00,160
It's $5,400,
$2,700

890
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,473
in each and that goes up according to 
inflation and that's pretty small 

891
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:08,020
potatoes compared to what the super pacs
are doing,

892
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:08,943
reflection,
so you have these people running who 

893
00:47:10,631 --> 00:47:11,464
expect they're going to raise the money 
to run their office from their direct 

894
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:14,584
contributions,
but they're counting on the super pacs 

895
00:47:16,481 --> 00:47:17,314
to come in and spends ungodly amounts of
money like tens of millions of dollars 

896
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,990
to support their candidate or to oppose 
their up their opponent,

897
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:29,730
and so the supporters for those super 
aren't even tiny.

898
00:47:30,611 --> 00:47:34,720
There's are the adolfs in America.
People named adolf this tiny,

899
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:35,583
tiny,
tiny number of people who are 

900
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:39,640
contributing to those to those things,
but you're right,

901
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:40,743
people.
Look,

902
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:41,743
there is no reason why most americans 
should understand the complexities of 

903
00:47:44,621 --> 00:47:46,780
campaign finance law and they don't need
to.

904
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:47,703
What they need to ask is,
do we have a system of integrity in the 

905
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:55,000
way we select representatives and if 
you're,

906
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:55,834
if you're not brain dead in America,
you believe the answer to that question 

907
00:47:57,851 --> 00:47:58,684
is no.

908
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:02,170
We do not have a system of integrity.
There's no representational integrity.

909
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,153
It is corrupted in all the obvious raise
and like nobody should be forced to 

910
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:11,320
study campaign finance in order to have 
an entitlement to say,

911
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,910
hell,
hell no.

912
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:16,780
This system has got to end.
And so I think you're right.

913
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,070
If we,
you know,

914
00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:18,943
people are forced to like articulate all
the 34 different changes that have to 

915
00:48:21,551 --> 00:48:22,840
happen.
We're never going to get there,

916
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:23,913
but let's not go there.
Let's just start and end with it is a 

917
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:30,580
corrupted system and we want politicians
to fix it and if they don't fix it,

918
00:48:30,581 --> 00:48:32,770
we'll throw them out until we get the 
politicians who do.

919
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,620
And if we could build That as the 
movement,

920
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,740
the recognition,
the core message of 20 slash 20,

921
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:42,700
I think there's a real shot because 
we've primed the republican party.

922
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:43,983
There are a lot of people in that party 
who are now so disgusted with the 

923
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:47,860
corruption of the system.

924
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,320
Not necessarily mitch mcconnell,
he loves it,

925
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,333
but you know,
an ordinary republican voters and the 

926
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:57,670
democrats have now committed themselves 
to fixing this corrupted system.

927
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:58,903
This is the moment to do that and we 
don't have to get into the details of 

928
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:02,314
how much you should be allowed to 
contribute to say there is a way to fix 

929
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:07,000
this that would give us a representative
democracy,

930
00:49:07,001 --> 00:49:09,760
maybe not again,
but for the first time wise,

931
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:12,100
mitch mcconnell,
so uniquely evil.

932
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:13,503
This guy has had it in his dna from the 
first moment he went to Washington to 

933
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:26,670
end any regulation of money in politics.
He engineered the selection of the fec,

934
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,203
the federal election commission 
commissioners so that they would block 

935
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,570
basically every enforcement action with 
the ftc.

936
00:49:37,571 --> 00:49:41,650
The fcc does nothing now because it's a 
commission that has half republicans and

937
00:49:41,651 --> 00:49:42,484
half democrats.
So if the republicans disagree from the 

938
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:46,600
democrats,
then nothing gets done.

939
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,063
They can't enforce the most simple rules
anymore because mitch mcconnell is 

940
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:54,340
populated the fec with people who don't 
believe in campaign finance rules.

941
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:55,503
He said,
citizens united this decision that said 

942
00:49:56,921 --> 00:49:57,754
corporations could give unlimited 
amounts of money to independent 

943
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:02,980
political speaking says one of the 
greatest decisions of the supreme court.

944
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,100
And he said he was gonna fight like hell
to defend it.

945
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:10,120
And when this proposed hr one was raised
to him,

946
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,013
mitch mcconnell said,
there's not a chance in hell this will 

947
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,233
ever even get a debate in the senate.
This man is obsessed with the idea that 

948
00:50:18,491 --> 00:50:23,491
money should have the power in 
Washington that it has right now.

949
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:26,290
And people are talking about reforming 
it are the enemy.

950
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:27,183
And so you.
The thing about mitch mcconnell is he's 

951
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:30,314
actually an incredibly smart man and 
he's an incredibly smart strategist and 

952
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:36,320
he's been playing this game for a long 
time.

953
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:37,683
Um,
and um,

954
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:38,703
and I think he's like responsible for 85
percent of the judicial structure that 

955
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:43,820
makes it possible for this to be 
blocked.

956
00:50:43,821 --> 00:50:44,654
There's an amazing series to debates 
happened 20 years ago between john 

957
00:50:47,871 --> 00:50:48,704
mccain and mitch mcconnell.
So this was when congress was passing 

958
00:50:51,711 --> 00:50:53,420
something called the mccain feingold 
law,

959
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:55,910
which was the last great effort to deal 
with this problem.

960
00:50:55,911 --> 00:50:58,910
And it was flawed and a bunch of ways,
but it was an important success.

961
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,100
Mitch mcconnell,
I'm stood on the floor of the senate and

962
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:06,140
said,
mr mccain says that,

963
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,100
uh,
the senate,

964
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:07,934
we can't say mr again.
So the senator from Arizona has said 

965
00:51:10,251 --> 00:51:13,370
that the system is corrupt.
I want him to name the corrupt people,

966
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,193
and mccain stands up and says,
I'm not talking about particular 

967
00:51:16,971 --> 00:51:18,530
individuals.
I'm talking about the system.

968
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:21,350
It's the system's corrupt.
And then mcconnell,

969
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,840
almost clueless.
I said,

970
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:25,730
if the system's corrupt,
there must be corrupt people.

971
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,980
If there's not corrupt people,
then the system's not corrupt.

972
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,280
So the only corruption he could imagine 
was corruption where somebody was taking

973
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:34,154
a bribe,
and if that's the only corruption we're 

974
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:36,524
allowed to remedy,
then the whole system of influence we 

975
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:45,050
have right now is not to be touched.
But you know,

976
00:51:45,051 --> 00:51:45,884
I think mccain's point was you can have 
a system filled with lots of honor's 

977
00:51:48,841 --> 00:51:52,580
congress people and lots of honest 
senators who never engage in bribery,

978
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,373
but they know how to bob and weave and 
bend and speak and say the right things 

979
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:03,380
to attract the right kind of money.
And that's as much corruption as bribery

980
00:52:03,381 --> 00:52:06,140
is.
And mccain's view was we had to end it.

981
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:07,543
So he was the last great republican 
fighter for reform of this corrupted 

982
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:13,790
system.
There'd been many,

983
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:14,624
before barry goldwater was an incredibly
vocal opponent to the role of money in 

984
00:52:18,681 --> 00:52:19,514
politics,
but I think what we have to do is to 

985
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:26,460
find a way to revive that and to 
leverage from this president's assertion

986
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,733
that this is a corrupt system and we 
have to change the system into actually 

987
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,220
building the political power to make 
that change happen.

988
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:38,010
Another thing that's very weird is it 
every four years or so,

989
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:40,950
there's this cry to eliminate the 
electoral college.

990
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,333
Every four years ago,
people realized that the battleground 

991
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:45,563
states are so critical and that so much 
money is being spent on the small 

992
00:52:49,591 --> 00:52:50,424
handful of states because they give you 
all the electoral votes and this is how 

993
00:52:53,551 --> 00:52:55,370
you win an election,
and then people say,

994
00:52:55,371 --> 00:52:56,131
well,
why is that?

995
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:58,200
That doesn't make any sense.
It should be one person,

996
00:52:58,201 --> 00:52:59,034
one vote.
Are we really that divided as a nation 

997
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:01,823
that we need to isolate ourselves into 
these small little lines in the dirt 

998
00:53:05,191 --> 00:53:08,820
where this part is worth this amount and
that parts worth that amount.

999
00:53:08,821 --> 00:53:09,654
And so everybody plays this weird 
electoral college game and then you get 

1000
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:14,724
a situation like what just happened 
where hillary clinton wins the popular 

1001
00:53:17,881 --> 00:53:18,714
vote,
but it's not the president because the 

1002
00:53:19,411 --> 00:53:21,720
electoral college is what makes 
everything.

1003
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,573
Yeah.
So the way you just described this 

1004
00:53:23,731 --> 00:53:26,370
problem is exactly.
The people have to think about it.

1005
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:27,550
The problem isn't.
I mean,

1006
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,900
it is a bad thing that the loser wins.
I mean,

1007
00:53:30,901 --> 00:53:33,690
That's just not the way elections 
supposed to work.

1008
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:36,090
So that's happened twice in our 
lifetime.

1009
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:37,770
Um,
and uh,

1010
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,950
it happened 100 years before that.
And it's going to happen more frequently

1011
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,020
going forward.
We can show that demographically,

1012
00:53:43,021 --> 00:53:43,854
but that's not the real problem.
The real problem is that in every 

1013
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,113
election,
the presidential candidates are focused 

1014
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:53,460
on just 14 states.
The battleground states,

1015
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:58,461
the purple states and those 14 states 
are the only states that matter to those

1016
00:53:59,071 --> 00:53:59,904
candidates.
And what scholars have demonstrated as 

1017
00:54:02,161 --> 00:54:02,994
the presidents and campaigns bend to 
themselves and their policies to make 

1018
00:54:06,691 --> 00:54:07,524
those states happy.
And those states don't represent 

1019
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:11,430
America.
They're older,

1020
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:14,160
they're wider.
They're industry is kind of 19th century

1021
00:54:14,161 --> 00:54:14,994
industry.

1022
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:15,923
There are seven and a half times the 
number of people in America working in 

1023
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:23,340
solar energy as mine coal,
but you never hear about solar energy In

1024
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:26,550
a presidential campaign because those 
people live in California and Texas.

1025
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:28,920
They don't matter to the presidential 
election,

1026
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,740
which you hear about his coal mining 
because the 50,000

1027
00:54:31,741 --> 00:54:35,310
coal miners left in America happened to 
live in these battleground states.

1028
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:36,443
So this is just a product of the way the
electoral college or the way states 

1029
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,760
count their votes to allocate their 
electors.

1030
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:46,530
Something called the winner take all 
system.

1031
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:47,903
So all but two states say that the 
winner of the popular vote gets all of 

1032
00:54:52,471 --> 00:54:54,940
the electoral votes for that state.
So you know,

1033
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:55,923
in 2000 in Florida,
George Bush won that state based on a 

1034
00:54:59,581 --> 00:55:00,414
stop to recount by 531 votes.
He goT all the electoral college votes 

1035
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:08,220
in that state even though he just barely
won that state.

1036
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,533
And so winner take all is what makes it 
so that it doesn't make sense for 

1037
00:55:12,931 --> 00:55:13,764
anybody to pay.
Pay any attention to any of the non 

1038
00:55:16,381 --> 00:55:17,214
battleground states and penn,
all of your tiMe in the battleground 

1039
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,274
states in 2016,
99 percent of campaign spending was in 

1040
00:55:23,911 --> 00:55:25,650
14 states,
90,

1041
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,950
99 percent,
95 percent of time,

1042
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,263
But the only reason they were not 99 
percent in those battleground states as 

1043
00:55:33,241 --> 00:55:34,074
the other five percent.
They were in New York and California 

1044
00:55:35,491 --> 00:55:36,390
raising money.
RighT?

1045
00:55:36,391 --> 00:55:37,224
So,
so this is a system designed to give 

1046
00:55:40,351 --> 00:55:42,150
power to these battleground states.
And then you say,

1047
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:42,984
well,
why is it something the constitution 

1048
00:55:45,271 --> 00:55:46,104
requires?
And the answer to that is absolutely 

1049
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:49,044
not.
The constitution does not say how the 

1050
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:51,414
states will allocate their electors,
and indeed when states started adopting 

1051
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:56,963
this winner take all system,
many thought it was an outrageous 

1052
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:03,570
perversion of the constitutional design.

1053
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,770
So jeff to jefferson was outraged,
but then he said,

1054
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,240
well,
some states are going to do it.

1055
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:13,380
Then all states have to do it.
Because if you're a state that allocates

1056
00:56:13,381 --> 00:56:14,214
all of your electrodes to the winner,
you're going to have more power than 

1057
00:56:16,531 --> 00:56:18,840
your neighboring states.
You only gets half the electrodes to the

1058
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:19,674
winter.
So very quickly there was a race to the 

1059
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:22,740
bottom and that's kind of where it's 
stuck.

1060
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,270
And so the question is now what we can 
do about it.

1061
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:26,163
Well,
there are two big reform efforts out 

1062
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:29,044
there.
One of them is called the national 

1063
00:56:30,851 --> 00:56:34,570
popular vote compact.
I mean I should say,

1064
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:35,404
you know,
you can imagine amending the 

1065
00:56:35,831 --> 00:56:38,440
constitution,
but it takes three fourths of the states

1066
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:39,274
to change the constitution.
And three fourths of the states are not 

1067
00:56:41,711 --> 00:56:44,050
going to agree with abolishing the 
electoral college.

1068
00:56:44,051 --> 00:56:46,810
So this is not going to happen anytime 
soon through the constitution.

1069
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,290
But there are two ways.
Without amending the constitution,

1070
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:52,920
we could fix this problem.
Won the national popular vote pro.

1071
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:55,330
A compact is basically states who say,
look,

1072
00:56:55,331 --> 00:56:59,470
we're going to pledge our electors to 
the winner of the national popular vote.

1073
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:04,690
So the state looks at who won the 
national popular vote,

1074
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:05,524
and then picks the slate of electors 
from their state with a party of the 

1075
00:57:09,161 --> 00:57:10,930
person who won the national popular 
vote.

1076
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:12,243
So in a state like New York,
if the republican won the national 

1077
00:57:15,341 --> 00:57:16,174
popular vote,
even though most people in New York are 

1078
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:18,154
democratic,
they would allocate their electrodes to 

1079
00:57:19,661 --> 00:57:22,210
the republican vice versa in Texas.
That's,

1080
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:26,050
that's the way that system would work.
And you know,

1081
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:28,840
I personally liked the system because I 
believe in the idea of one person,

1082
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:29,674
one vote,
everybody's vote is an american citizen 

1083
00:57:30,881 --> 00:57:32,530
for the american president should be 
equal.

1084
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:33,364
It shouldn't,
shouldn't matter that you're having to 

1085
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:36,940
live in Wyoming versus Pennsylvania 
versus New York.

1086
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:38,573
Um,
but there are people who are worried 

1087
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:42,910
about this because they fear that it'll 
become a kind of flyover democracy.

1088
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:47,940
But the only places that candidates will
care about will be places like la or New

1089
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:52,300
York or chicago.
I actually don't think that's right,

1090
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:53,134
but I get the understanding,
I think they're wrong about the way the 

1091
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:55,774
campaigns work,
but I understand why they're anxious 

1092
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:57,514
about it.
So then that leads to the alternative 

1093
00:57:58,991 --> 00:58:00,280
solution,
which is something,

1094
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,860
you know,
my group equal citizens.us

1095
00:58:02,861 --> 00:58:05,610
is litigating this right now.
Um,

1096
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,830
we're just trying to declare this winner
take all system,

1097
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:13,390
violates the constitution.
Because it basically says that if you're

1098
00:58:13,391 --> 00:58:16,810
a republican in California,
your vote never matters.

1099
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,793
If you're a democrat in Texas,
your vote never matters because we just 

1100
00:58:20,021 --> 00:58:20,854
count your vote up and then we throw it 
away because we allocate all the 

1101
00:58:23,861 --> 00:58:27,040
electors to the dominant party in your 
state.

1102
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:30,390
And so we've got david boies is our 
chief litigate,

1103
00:58:30,391 --> 00:58:33,610
or we've got a case in California,
Texas,

1104
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:34,803
South Carolina and Massachusetts asking 
the courts to declare a winner take all 

1105
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:39,814
unconstitutional and instead say that 
electrons have to be allocated 

1106
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,833
proportionally.
So if you get 40 percent of the vote in 

1107
00:58:45,581 --> 00:58:47,180
the state,
you get 40 percent of the electorate.

1108
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,480
If you get 50 percent,
you get 50 percent of doctors.

1109
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:50,853
And what that would do overnight is it 
would make every state in the nation 

1110
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:56,913
competitive.
Like there'd be a reason for a democrat 

1111
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,890
to go to Texas because you're not going 
to get all the electoral votes.

1112
00:59:02,891 --> 00:59:04,570
You're not going to get a half the 
electoral votes,

1113
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,330
but you'll get 40 percent,
maybe 45 percent.

1114
00:59:07,331 --> 00:59:08,830
And that could matter.
Um,

1115
00:59:08,831 --> 00:59:11,590
or a republican would go to California 
because,

1116
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,240
you know,
you're not going to get all the votes in

1117
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:14,860
California,
but you're going to get a lot.

1118
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:16,420
There are a lot of republicans in 
California,

1119
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:17,643
um,
so this change would immediately make 

1120
00:59:19,511 --> 00:59:20,344
every state in play.
But unlike the national popular vote 

1121
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:24,613
alternatives,
there are many people who look at this 

1122
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:28,550
and say,
this will be better because small states

1123
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:31,430
would still have a pretty important role
like an elector as an elector.

1124
00:59:31,431 --> 00:59:34,130
And if I can get it from Arizona,
I'm going to care about Arizona if I can

1125
00:59:34,131 --> 00:59:35,960
get it from Arkansas,
care about Arkansas.

1126
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,333
Um,
so it's not going to just be the big 

1127
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:41,540
states are the big population centers.
It's going to be every state.

1128
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,900
And so if we can get,
you know,

1129
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:44,773
a court to say this violates the 
constitution and then you could have 

1130
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,790
states forest to allocate their electors
proportionally.

1131
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:53,653
And if they did that and then the 
problem that you identified at the 

1132
00:59:56,871 --> 00:59:57,704
start,
which I think is the problem could be 

1133
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:00,374
solved overnight.
You would no longer have these 

1134
01:00:01,371 --> 01:00:04,190
battleground states deciding everything 
you'd ever president.

1135
01:00:04,191 --> 01:00:05,024
Who cares about getting elected by all 
of America and that would be incredible 

1136
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:12,920
improvement though that seems like in,
in and of itself would be a game changer

1137
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,140
if they could do that,
that would change a lot.

1138
01:00:15,141 --> 01:00:17,090
But one of the things that you said,
uh,

1139
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:22,160
you said you don't think that it's 
possible that we would ever vote out the

1140
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:25,670
electoral college,
but is there a support for the electoral

1141
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:27,650
college?
Is there a good argument for it?

1142
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:30,823
So there is support for the idea that 
everY state have a role and there's a 

1143
01:00:36,921 --> 01:00:40,220
support for the idea that small states 
get to kind of thumb on the scale,

1144
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,440
which is what the electoral college 
does.

1145
01:00:42,441 --> 01:00:44,840
So there is some supportive,
but most people,

1146
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:48,260
you know,
70 percent of people don't like the idea

1147
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:52,160
that the president is not chosen from 
the majority of voters.

1148
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:53,863
So most people would oppose it.
But the point is to change the 

1149
01:00:55,551 --> 01:01:00,551
constitution,
you need the state legislatures or state

1150
01:01:00,621 --> 01:01:05,240
conventions to agree with the change.
And what many states,

1151
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,640
at least thIrteen states I fear would 
say,

1152
01:01:07,641 --> 01:01:10,430
is that we actually win more under this 
system.

1153
01:01:10,431 --> 01:01:13,010
Then we lose,
so we're not going to change the system,

1154
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:14,543
and so unless you get like some 
overwhelmingly popular movement to 

1155
01:01:18,171 --> 01:01:19,310
support it,
or again,

1156
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,410
you know,
you can imagine a presidential candidate

1157
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:25,160
who kind of made fixing this part of the
democracy part of the plan too.

1158
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:26,653
I don't see how you're going to build a 
political movement to get there or 

1159
01:01:28,411 --> 01:01:30,620
another way of putting it.
As you know,

1160
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:35,120
this national popular vote compact,
which is going around state to state and

1161
01:01:35,121 --> 01:01:37,760
getting states to join right now has 
about a hundred.

1162
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:38,643
And so the way this works is that when 
the equivalent of 270 electoral votes 

1163
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:46,310
have been committed than the compact 
kicks in.

1164
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:49,720
So when they get to 270,
the problem goes away.

1165
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:52,940
You know the problem of this electoral 
college goes away because add to 70,

1166
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:53,863
according to the plan,
the winner of the popular vote wins the 

1167
01:01:55,941 --> 01:01:56,774
electoral college.
They right now have 172 electors 

1168
01:01:59,631 --> 01:02:01,550
pledged,
right?

1169
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,384
So they have less than 100 more to go.
But the problem is they've got to 

1170
01:02:05,391 --> 01:02:10,391
convince states to join the compact and 
they're kind of.

1171
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:14,120
They kind of hit this red wall now 
because many republicans thing,

1172
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,910
the only way to win the presidency is 
through the electoral college.

1173
01:02:16,911 --> 01:02:19,130
Now,
so many state legislatures,

1174
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,003
why do they believe that?

1175
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:21,923
I think many republicans just think that
they're great benefit is from the 

1176
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:25,794
electoral college.
It's not surprising because the 

1177
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:27,774
battleground states are primarily 
republican because the base number of 

1178
01:02:30,631 --> 01:02:32,400
republican states is sell high.
Right?

1179
01:02:32,401 --> 01:02:33,234
Because you know,
these small rural states get 

1180
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:38,760
disproportionately more electors than 
states.

1181
01:02:38,761 --> 01:02:39,594
Like California.
Wyoming gets three electors 

1182
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,410
disproportionate in terms of the 
population.

1183
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:45,570
right?
so they liked the system as it is.

1184
01:02:45,571 --> 01:02:47,190
And you know,
you look back and you say,

1185
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:48,143
well they got George Bush,
even though he didn't win the national 

1186
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:51,054
vote and they got Donald Trump,
even though he didn't win the national 

1187
01:02:52,891 --> 01:02:53,724
vote,
it's not hard for me to understand why 

1188
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:56,400
they're there.
I think,

1189
01:02:56,401 --> 01:02:58,320
again,
I don't think they're right about this.

1190
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:00,840
You know,
in 2004,

1191
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:02,603
if 50,000
votes had switched to john kerry in 

1192
01:03:05,221 --> 01:03:06,054
Ohio,
then john kerry would have won the 

1193
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:13,851
electoral college but lost the popular 
vote and if that had happened in 2004,

1194
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:15,024
I think the electoral college would be 
dead today because a republican won in 

1195
01:03:18,571 --> 01:03:21,390
2000 a democrat,
ron in 2004 people would say,

1196
01:03:21,391 --> 01:03:22,710
this system is just crazy.

1197
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:25,350
We got to get rid of this system,
but now people think,

1198
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:27,510
well,
republicans benefit from this,

1199
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:29,730
so I'm a republican.
I'm going to block the change.

1200
01:03:29,731 --> 01:03:30,564
And if that's true,
then it's never going to happen at a 

1201
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:32,784
constitutional level because the 
constitution requires three fourths of 

1202
01:03:35,971 --> 01:03:39,210
the states to support the reform and the
reinforcement of the as the Donald Trump

1203
01:03:39,211 --> 01:03:41,000
one without having the popular one.
Yeah.

1204
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,390
Yeah.
And you know,

1205
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:43,583
of course not.
There's no hypocrisy that touches this 

1206
01:03:46,231 --> 01:03:47,670
president.
But remember,

1207
01:03:47,671 --> 01:03:48,504
in 2012,
when there was a moment for about 10 

1208
01:03:52,171 --> 01:03:55,170
minutes when the national media was 
reporting that,

1209
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:58,650
that romney was going to win the popular
vote,

1210
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,620
but barack obama was going to be elected
by the electoral college.

1211
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:06,150
Trump started tweeting vigorously about 
how this is a denial of democracy.

1212
01:04:06,151 --> 01:04:10,380
We have to march on Washington to end 
this banana republic like system because

1213
01:04:10,381 --> 01:04:12,510
the electoral college was the worst 
possible thing in the world.

1214
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:13,673
And of course after 2016 he had 
different views about the electoral 

1215
01:04:15,961 --> 01:04:16,880
college.
Um,

1216
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,980
I wasn't old enough to understand what 
was going on during watergate.

1217
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:23,010
Uh,
what Year was that?

1218
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,520
Well,
70.

1219
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,353
Uh,
so,

1220
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:26,483
you know,
the break In happens in the lead up to 

1221
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:28,614
the 72 election.
and then he eventually resigned after 

1222
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:31,704
that.
But this is our watergate this moment 

1223
01:04:33,511 --> 01:04:34,344
right now.
And cohen's going to go to jail for 

1224
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,390
three years.
And I mean,

1225
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:38,443
he's testifying against trump and all 
these people are testifying and they're 

1226
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,080
calling him.
What do they call him?

1227
01:04:43,081 --> 01:04:47,430
Coconspirator number one is that with 
the individual official individually.

1228
01:04:47,431 --> 01:04:52,431
Number one,
this is a very unusual moment for us to,

1229
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:57,960
to be watching this all unfold and to 
see this slow dissection,

1230
01:04:58,321 --> 01:05:03,321
what mueller seems to be doing is like 
slowly closing off all the escape routes

1231
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:08,130
and slowly circling the troops around 
this one area that he's trying to,

1232
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:09,840
that he's,
that he's attacking.

1233
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:11,041
Yeah.
So,

1234
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:14,250
um,
he's a brillianT tactician.

1235
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,300
Yeah.
and,

1236
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,110
and,
uh,

1237
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:17,830
and so I think it's that

1238
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,990
the worst for Donald Trump has yet to 
come.

1239
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:21,923
Um,
and I do think the parallel is 

1240
01:05:23,351 --> 01:05:24,184
watergate,
but there's a really important 

1241
01:05:24,881 --> 01:05:25,960
difference here,
you know.

1242
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:28,650
Um,
so I'm old enough to remember watergate.

1243
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:29,583
I was like 12 or 13 minutes happened and
my uncle happened to be the lawyer who 

1244
01:05:33,461 --> 01:05:34,294
worked in the house of representatives 
convincing the house of representatives 

1245
01:05:37,091 --> 01:05:37,924
to vote the articles of impeachment.
So he and that weekend when nixon 

1246
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:42,850
resigned,
he came to visit us.

1247
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:45,340
We lived in the Kentucky part of 
Pennsylvania,

1248
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:47,860
that kind of right wing,
middle part of the state.

1249
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:49,890
He came to visit us and,
um,

1250
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,960
he told me this was gonna happen and uh,
that was the event.

1251
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:55,360
That was the weekend that I decided I 
wanted to become a lawyer.

1252
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,800
Um,
but,

1253
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,810
uh,
but the big difference between these two

1254
01:05:58,811 --> 01:05:59,644
times is that when that happened,
the way most people got access to news 

1255
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:06,453
was three television networks every day 
they watched the news at the same time 

1256
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:12,850
because there was nothing else on.

1257
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,373
And those three television networks kind
of shot right down the middle and told 

1258
01:06:17,051 --> 01:06:18,620
the story as they saw it.
Um,

1259
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:19,653
you know,
it was kind of the walter cronkite era 

1260
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:24,760
of news.
And as this story broke,

1261
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:28,240
they just reported it as they saw it.
And as they saw it,

1262
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:32,050
it was a pretty damning indictment of 
the precedent.

1263
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:33,573
And what's amazing is he walked the 
polling among republicans and their 

1264
01:06:36,761 --> 01:06:40,900
support for the president six months 
before the president resigns.

1265
01:06:40,901 --> 01:06:42,880
The poll says,
among republicans,

1266
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:46,840
he has about an 83 percent support rate.
And then when he resigns,

1267
01:06:46,841 --> 01:06:49,540
his support rate among republicans is 
about 50 percent.

1268
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:50,523
And that's because the news,
newspapers and television had like told 

1269
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:57,220
everybody the same story and americans 
hearing the same story.

1270
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:58,054
It came to the same view that there was 
something deeply corrupted by this 

1271
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:01,024
president and he had to go,
we don't live in that news environment 

1272
01:07:03,611 --> 01:07:04,444
today.

1273
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:05,943
We live in an environment where half of 
America lives in one news world and the 

1274
01:07:09,701 --> 01:07:10,534
other half of America lives in another 
news world and the half of America 

1275
01:07:12,581 --> 01:07:13,414
living in the breitbart fox news world 
are not being told the stories that the 

1276
01:07:17,681 --> 01:07:20,260
people living in the msnbc,
npr,

1277
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:24,340
news universe are.
And so in this world,

1278
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:27,700
the opportunity for americans to like 
see the facts,

1279
01:07:27,701 --> 01:07:28,534
the same facts and have a reflective 
judgment about it and come to a view 

1280
01:07:31,121 --> 01:07:36,121
that this president on a needs to resign
or be impeached.

1281
01:07:37,181 --> 01:07:38,620
I don't think he should be impeached,
but let's,

1282
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,300
that's a separate question.
Um,

1283
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:41,740
is,
is not possible.

1284
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,570
and that's what's so terrifying about 
it.

1285
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:48,600
When you live in a democracy where we 
don't all live in the same universe,

1286
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,310
you know,
we don't know the same facts.

1287
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:52,563
Um,
how do you knit together a public that 

1288
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:58,150
can address these critical issues of 
national import?

1289
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:58,801
Um,
and,

1290
01:07:58,801 --> 01:08:00,700
and that's,
I think our biggest challenge,

1291
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:01,031
right?
Well,

1292
01:08:01,031 --> 01:08:02,410
it gets grayer than that,
right?

1293
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,244
With characters like sean hannity that 
they separate the line between not just 

1294
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:09,123
being some sort of a political pundit,
but actually campaigning for the 

1295
01:08:12,731 --> 01:08:14,920
president,
showing up at speeches,

1296
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:16,670
uh,
addressing

1297
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:17,563
the crowd making,
making these big statements in support 

1298
01:08:20,151 --> 01:08:20,984
of the president is very strange to 
watch because I don't remember that at 

1299
01:08:23,781 --> 01:08:25,160
any point in time.
No,

1300
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:28,700
it wasn't the past.
But I think the thing we need to realize

1301
01:08:28,701 --> 01:08:29,534
is it is the future because it pays 
cable news pays tremendously when these 

1302
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:40,490
people become partisan hacks inside of a
politics of hate,

1303
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:41,383
which is the current politics of like 
both the democratic and republican 

1304
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:44,834
parties and the cable news stations.
They build tribes who are deeply loyal 

1305
01:08:49,131 --> 01:08:49,964
to them.
And the loyalty to those tribes 

1306
01:08:51,651 --> 01:08:55,730
translates into advertising dollars.
It is the business model of cable.

1307
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:59,540
So sean hannity looks to old geezers 
like me,

1308
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:03,560
like an abomination from the perspective
of what news should be like.

1309
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:06,080
But from the standpoint of what the 
future is going to be,

1310
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:09,260
he is the future.
And so then it becomes a question like,

1311
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:13,340
how do we knit together a democracy 
given there will be people like the sean

1312
01:09:13,341 --> 01:09:15,020
hannity's on cable television.

1313
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:16,480
uh,
and you know,

1314
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,490
I've began to talk about the slow 
democracy movement,

1315
01:09:19,491 --> 01:09:20,300
which I think,
you know,

1316
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,250
I think I pointed to you as part of 
that.

1317
01:09:22,251 --> 01:09:23,084
I think that there's a need to begin to 
think about how do we build political 

1318
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:26,834
understanding,
not through broadcast television but 

1319
01:09:29,931 --> 01:09:30,764
through something else that gives people
a chance to think in more than 32nd 

1320
01:09:34,641 --> 01:09:35,720
bites.
Yes.

1321
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,730
and podcasting I think is a core part of
that.

1322
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:42,380
Is it entirely possiBle that something 
could be profitable that does shoot down

1323
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:45,440
the middle because people are so tired 
of this cnn,

1324
01:09:45,441 --> 01:09:48,890
fox,
bipolar distribution of information.

1325
01:09:48,891 --> 01:09:50,720
I mean,
I remember when the elections were going

1326
01:09:50,721 --> 01:09:51,554
on,
I would flip back and forth between the 

1327
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:56,530
two channels and it was like two 
alternative universes.

1328
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:59,360
There are different worlds,
different worlds of focus,

1329
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,240
different worlds of the,
what they're projecting.

1330
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:02,800
Yeah.
So,

1331
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,870
buT I don't think the point is that it 
has to be down the middle.

1332
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:07,603
I think it has to be deep.
So this is what I think is so powerful 

1333
01:10:09,771 --> 01:10:12,080
about podcasting,
like you know,

1334
01:10:12,081 --> 01:10:14,660
the fact that you get people to listen 
to,

1335
01:10:14,661 --> 01:10:17,420
you talk about an idea for an hour or 
two hours,

1336
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:18,254
some of them three hours is astonishing,
literally astonishing in an age where 

1337
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:24,013
the most a cable news channel will 
allocate to a new store is a minute and 

1338
01:10:27,861 --> 01:10:28,730
a half,
two minutes,

1339
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:30,170
three minutes.
Right?

1340
01:10:30,171 --> 01:10:32,390
And you know,
in the context of the tweet,

1341
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:37,130
thinking of cable news,
they can't afford to go deep on anything

1342
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:40,550
and everything they're going to talk 
about are the things they can talk about

1343
01:10:40,551 --> 01:10:43,670
sensibly in 25 seconds or 30 seconds or 
40 seconds.

1344
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:44,990
And what,
you know,

1345
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,824
because you've lived this life of like 
having deep conversations about things 

1346
01:10:48,141 --> 01:10:52,010
that are important is that it sometimes 
takes more than 30 seconds to understand

1347
01:10:52,011 --> 01:10:53,120
something always.

1348
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,610
Yeah.
And the point is if we have media that's

1349
01:10:55,611 --> 01:10:59,930
focused at the 32nd chunk and that's how
America understands the issues.

1350
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:00,793
We're never gonna get anywhere and the 
only way to get to get someplace is to 

1351
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:08,480
begin to have conversations that are at 
the hour long chunk or the two hour long

1352
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:09,314
chuck,
and it's not important that that be 

1353
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:14,400
neutral or balanced.
I don't care if it's balanced.

1354
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:15,653
I care that it is attempting to be 
serious and in depth understanding the 

1355
01:11:19,621 --> 01:11:20,454
issue,
so I don't care if keto wants to have 

1356
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:22,913
podcasts,
they try to tell us the deep story of 

1357
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:27,270
iron randy and economics or something 
like that.

1358
01:11:27,271 --> 01:11:28,290
That's fine.
That's good.

1359
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:32,460
I think it's important that people start
thinking about these issues in a richer,

1360
01:11:32,461 --> 01:11:33,294
deeper way and I think the challenge we 
have now is how do we begin to produce 

1361
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:38,813
understanding,
realizing that the world of walter 

1362
01:11:41,101 --> 01:11:44,220
cronkite is never coming back and it 
might be a good thing,

1363
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:45,900
but it is just never coming back.

1364
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:50,550
And the world of sean hannity is a world
that will destroy democracy.

1365
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:53,610
So how do we rebuild democracy outside 
of that and you know,

1366
01:11:53,611 --> 01:11:55,480
if you.
If you had to pick the three things that

1367
01:11:55,481 --> 01:11:58,410
have the most hopeful,
I think podcasting is number one.

1368
01:11:58,890 --> 01:12:00,810
I think some of the reflective,
deep,

1369
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:02,190
you know,
funny,

1370
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,440
playful,
but in the end,

1371
01:12:04,441 --> 01:12:07,290
at the end of the hour long segment of a
podcast,

1372
01:12:07,291 --> 01:12:09,180
you understand something you didn't 
understand before.

1373
01:12:09,181 --> 01:12:13,470
I think that's number one.
I think comedy like comedy television,

1374
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:14,363
like brings pEople into understanding 
things in a way that's not possible on 

1375
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:19,590
fox news.
I think that,

1376
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:20,483
you know,
as number two I think shows like 

1377
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:25,700
homeland.
I don't know if you watch homeland,

1378
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:26,843
watched it until the redheaded guy died 
and then that went through this dark 

1379
01:12:29,821 --> 01:12:33,840
period in the middle,
but the recent seasons or just unfucking

1380
01:12:33,841 --> 01:12:34,674
believable and because they're 
unbelievable because they are such a 

1381
01:12:38,071 --> 01:12:42,180
deep rich understanding of the tensions 
at issue.

1382
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:43,043
Like you won't understand the Iran 
nuclear deal watched the last season 

1383
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:52,260
because after watching that season,
you like understand the tensions between

1384
01:12:52,261 --> 01:12:56,100
the cia and the president and what's 
actually going on with Israel.

1385
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:57,383
and,
and I think that if you imagine 

1386
01:12:58,860 --> 01:12:59,693
television shows aspiring to tell the 
story in an entertaining way and in a 

1387
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:07,170
way that brings people in,
that they voluntarily want to watch it.

1388
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:10,590
But that in the end,
at the end of watching a season,

1389
01:13:10,591 --> 01:13:11,424
you understand something,
I understand the current season's about 

1390
01:13:13,081 --> 01:13:14,080
the Russia,
you know,

1391
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:15,083
struggle and I can't wait to watch it 
because it's going to be a richer 

1392
01:13:17,581 --> 01:13:20,070
understanding of that story than 
anything on television.

1393
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:24,600
Did you watch house of cards?
I did up until the season.

1394
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,970
Did you quit at this season?
I watched the season.

1395
01:13:26,971 --> 01:13:30,380
I was very disappointed by watched 
episode one and I said this,

1396
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:31,223
it seems like they gave it to some 
different writers and it's this 

1397
01:13:32,871 --> 01:13:33,440
craziness.

1398
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,273
It just seemed like a.
Like somebody just got ahold of it and 

1399
01:13:37,161 --> 01:13:37,994
they said,
I'll take it and I want to write it my 

1400
01:13:39,061 --> 01:13:40,140
own way.
Right.

1401
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:41,610
But even in the very beginning,
you know,

1402
01:13:41,611 --> 01:13:42,444
the striking thing about house of cards 
is it made it seem like stuff actually 

1403
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:47,200
could happen in Washington.
Yes.

1404
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,061
And you're like,
wow,

1405
01:13:48,061 --> 01:13:48,894
that's really powerful guy.
Frank underwood actually can actually 

1406
01:13:50,941 --> 01:13:54,120
get important bills passed.
And I remember watching that same.

1407
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:57,750
Holy shit.
This is just completely not the truth.

1408
01:13:57,780 --> 01:13:59,520
This is just not the way the system 
works.

1409
01:13:59,521 --> 01:14:00,354
I mean,
it would be good if it worked like that 

1410
01:14:01,891 --> 01:14:02,724
because at least it could do stuff,
but the way it actually works is that 

1411
01:14:05,971 --> 01:14:08,280
these guys would be scurrying around 
trying to figure out,

1412
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,143
you know,
what the tentacles of funders are 

1413
01:14:10,651 --> 01:14:14,980
directing them to do and the tentacles 
of funders added together would be don't

1414
01:14:14,981 --> 01:14:15,760
do anything.

1415
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:20,760
That's not what you're there to do.
But what it did is sort of highlight the

1416
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:23,014
influences these people experience and 
it showed how deeply entrenched 

1417
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:30,100
everything is.
Yeah.

1418
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:31,870
I mean I don't want to talk it down at 
all,

1419
01:14:31,871 --> 01:14:32,704
man.
I want a million different things like 

1420
01:14:35,021 --> 01:14:35,854
this on television.
Just something that gives people just 

1421
01:14:38,471 --> 01:14:40,240
give them a richer understanding.
Well,

1422
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:42,700
an understanding period because for the 
most part,

1423
01:14:42,701 --> 01:14:44,710
what people,
when you go to school,

1424
01:14:44,711 --> 01:14:45,544
you learn about democracy and our system
of representative government and then 

1425
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:50,194
you become an adult and you forget most 
of what you learned and then you hear 

1426
01:14:53,501 --> 01:14:57,080
something about the electoral college 
and the popular vote and you know,

1427
01:14:57,290 --> 01:14:59,440
and then you see bills getting passed 
and you know,

1428
01:14:59,441 --> 01:15:00,274
what the hell is that and this and the 
stuff you learn at school is so 

1429
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:03,874
politically correct.
IT can't actually give you an 

1430
01:15:05,351 --> 01:15:06,280
understanding of anything.

1431
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:10,150
Like you actually taught kids in high 
school the way congress worked.

1432
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:11,513
You know,
the school board would go crazy and 

1433
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:13,081
they're like,
no,

1434
01:15:13,081 --> 01:15:13,231
no,
no,

1435
01:15:13,231 --> 01:15:14,064
no.
You can't talk down american democracy 

1436
01:15:15,161 --> 01:15:17,590
like that.
So the truth is not teachable.

1437
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:18,693
The only way to get people to see the 
truth is to expose it to them in a way 

1438
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:23,260
that they want to see it.
And you know,

1439
01:15:23,261 --> 01:15:25,750
my point is that's not going to be fox 
news.

1440
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:27,783
Fox news can never cover it at the depth
and the interest level that it needs to 

1441
01:15:30,341 --> 01:15:32,920
be covered.
It's going to be things like what you do

1442
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:38,700
or things like what great television can
do is our system of government analogous

1443
01:15:38,741 --> 01:15:39,574
to like taking like dos or windows 95 or
something like that and just continuing 

1444
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:45,544
to patch it and never revisit it and 
never come up with a new operating 

1445
01:15:48,191 --> 01:15:48,910
system.

1446
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:49,743
I think the better analogy is an 
operating system that has been taken 

1447
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:58,560
over by malware virus because it's not 
innocent,

1448
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:01,000
you know,
dos,

1449
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:01,893
you know,
it was a fun system and that like 

1450
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:03,993
cranked to a halt after awhile when 
you're trying to pile more and more on 

1451
01:16:06,371 --> 01:16:07,204
top of it.
But that was just kind of the limits of 

1452
01:16:08,201 --> 01:16:09,034
what it could do.
There was nothing malicious in its 

1453
01:16:11,081 --> 01:16:12,410
failure,
but,

1454
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:14,770
but there's something malicious in this 
failure.

1455
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:19,830
There are people who are eagerly focused
on how to make sure our government can't

1456
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:23,290
govern because if our government can't 
govern,

1457
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,390
they win.
So you know,

1458
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:31,030
the koch brothers have this amazing 
diverse bipolar character.

1459
01:16:31,031 --> 01:16:31,864
On the one hand,
they're talking about the ideals of 

1460
01:16:32,711 --> 01:16:33,544
government,
but the reality is their interventions 

1461
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:40,000
make it so we don't have an epa that can
regulate their companies.

1462
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:40,953
So basically we have environmental 
policy that leaves their companies 

1463
01:16:43,781 --> 01:16:44,614
alone,
which means they can make tons of money 

1464
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:47,314
by polluting our environment without 
ever having to pay the consequence of 

1465
01:16:50,051 --> 01:16:50,170
it.

1466
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:54,490
And what they want is not change of a 
particular kind except for tax cuts.

1467
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:57,380
What they want is nothing to happen.
Um,

1468
01:16:57,610 --> 01:16:58,443
and so that's the kind of malware that's
taken over the system of our government 

1469
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:04,510
has blocked the ability to government to
function.

1470
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,750
and rather than having leaders at the 
center who say,

1471
01:17:07,751 --> 01:17:08,584
hold it,
let's just pause for a second and 

1472
01:17:10,611 --> 01:17:11,444
realize this is a fucking broken system.
We have politicians that continue to 

1473
01:17:14,601 --> 01:17:15,434
pretend as if everything's working,
you just have to elect more democrats 

1474
01:17:17,511 --> 01:17:19,790
and we'll get what we want,
you know,

1475
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:21,003
I'm voting online.
What would be the pitfalls of that and 

1476
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:27,920
why hasn't that been implemented?
If you can bank online,

1477
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:31,490
why can't you vote online?
So I think,

1478
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:33,020
you know,
most of the tech,

1479
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:33,933
the experts who are disinterested,
meaning they're not working for default 

1480
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,713
or something like that,
I would tell you that we don't yet have 

1481
01:17:40,881 --> 01:17:43,940
the infrastructure to be able to be 
confident about this.

1482
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:45,680
Now,
there are lots of people working on,

1483
01:17:46,190 --> 01:17:51,190
I think really great open source 
implementations that that could be,

1484
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:52,933
could eventually produce the kind of 
confidence that we need to have to be 

1485
01:17:55,281 --> 01:17:56,114
able to vote online.
And so I don't foreclose it in the long 

1486
01:17:59,811 --> 01:18:01,490
run.
But I think what we've seen in the short

1487
01:18:01,491 --> 01:18:02,324
run is that when we turn to these 
proprietary providers of technology to 

1488
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:10,640
enable us to vote,
they give us shit.

1489
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:11,470
Uh,
you know,

1490
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:12,860
look,
look at these voting machines.

1491
01:18:12,861 --> 01:18:17,861
There was a recent story about his 11 
year old who was able to,

1492
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:19,673
uh,
within like 15 minutes hack into the 

1493
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:23,840
Florida election,
um,

1494
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:24,793
uh,
uh,

1495
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,130
system and change the results from a,
you know,

1496
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,720
one,
one candidate to another.

1497
01:18:30,130 --> 01:18:31,940
Um,
because you know,

1498
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:34,880
the companies that build these 
technologies are not filled with a bunch

1499
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:37,070
of rocket science.
Like if you're really good,

1500
01:18:37,071 --> 01:18:39,890
you're going to go work for google or 
for facebook or something like that.

1501
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:40,723
So.
So the proprietary software has all of 

1502
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:47,340
these bugs and holes and intended back 
doors built into it.

1503
01:18:47,341 --> 01:18:48,550
Intended back towards.
Yeah,

1504
01:18:48,590 --> 01:18:49,760
because they need,
you know,

1505
01:18:49,761 --> 01:18:52,910
the company itself needs a simple way to
get into check or to fix things,

1506
01:18:52,911 --> 01:18:53,744
but then they worry about the fact that 
other people will get back doors to be 

1507
01:18:56,241 --> 01:18:58,760
able to get.
This was the argument for diebold system

1508
01:18:58,761 --> 01:19:03,761
that did have a third party entrance.
Tons of allegations about that.

1509
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:06,760
Did you ever see the documentary hacking
democracies?

1510
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,500
Is that disturbing to you?
Incredibly.

1511
01:19:09,501 --> 01:19:10,334
I don't know how much I believe about it
was a well because I've seen so much 

1512
01:19:14,271 --> 01:19:18,500
that contradicts some of the claims 
about the extent to which there was real

1513
01:19:18,501 --> 01:19:21,650
differences in the numbers.
I remember at that election really being

1514
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:25,100
anxious about it because it seemed to me
in Ohio in particular,

1515
01:19:25,550 --> 01:19:30,020
a really compelling case was made that 
there was some something weird going on,

1516
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:32,450
but you know,
the point is not so much the particulars

1517
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:33,500
of a particular election.

1518
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:34,633
It's recognizing that if you turn this 
over to proprietary software companies 

1519
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,090
who are going to build these closed 
systems,

1520
01:19:41,091 --> 01:19:41,924
nobody can inspect.
There's no reason to trust them and you 

1521
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:45,584
know,
they think they are intending to make 

1522
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:48,374
themselves vulnerable to the russians.
They're just going to make themselves 

1523
01:19:50,481 --> 01:19:51,314
vulnerable to the russians and there are
alternative systems like open source 

1524
01:19:54,171 --> 01:19:55,004
systems.
It's something I know some people are 

1525
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:58,190
building right now that I think 
eventually could get us there.

1526
01:19:58,450 --> 01:20:02,180
An open source system like linux based,
something that would go onto your phone.

1527
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:03,553
Well it could be on your phone,
but the point about the open source is 

1528
01:20:05,601 --> 01:20:06,980
that anybody can inspect the

1529
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:10,950
and be confident that the code is doing 
what it says.

1530
01:20:10,951 --> 01:20:11,784
It's true,
right?

1531
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:13,043
What I'm saying about being on your 
phone as the biometrics that we use on 

1532
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:16,144
our phone today or some of the most 
secure in terms of like being able to 

1533
01:20:19,961 --> 01:20:20,794
establish that it's you that's making 
that vote like iris scanners that you 

1534
01:20:23,381 --> 01:20:25,180
have on the.
I have a samsung note,

1535
01:20:25,181 --> 01:20:27,550
nine that has an iris scanner,
checks my eyeballs.

1536
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:30,610
You know,
you're my iphone checks my face.

1537
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:31,780
takes the shit,
I mean,

1538
01:20:31,810 --> 01:20:32,643
there's,
they're pretty amazing fingerprints 

1539
01:20:34,541 --> 01:20:35,374
obviously,
but the fact that this is probably in 

1540
01:20:38,561 --> 01:20:41,890
terms of our own personal security in 
terms of information,

1541
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:42,843
this is probably the most secure.
Our smartphones are probably the most 

1542
01:20:45,251 --> 01:20:47,080
secure devices we've ever possessed.

1543
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,110
So on the one hand,
yes,

1544
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:54,490
and that's why I say I agree with you 
that in the long run we should imagine a

1545
01:20:54,491 --> 01:20:56,200
world where to be trivially easy to 
vote,

1546
01:20:56,201 --> 01:21:01,201
just like it's easy for me to venmo you 
or a cash app,

1547
01:21:01,331 --> 01:21:03,010
you,
I guess it's your favorite here.

1548
01:21:03,011 --> 01:21:03,844
Um,
uh,

1549
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:05,123
uh,
money that should be the way the future 

1550
01:21:06,221 --> 01:21:07,660
is.
But on the other hand,

1551
01:21:07,661 --> 01:21:08,494
we need to realize that these 
technologies are also incredibly 

1552
01:21:11,801 --> 01:21:12,634
insecure in the sense that there is now 
a commercial market to exploit a 

1553
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:21,400
insecurities inside of these phones.
And,

1554
01:21:21,401 --> 01:21:21,810
uh,
you know,

1555
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:25,180
these companies basically have bounties 
that they post on the web,

1556
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:26,293
right?
For people who will come forward and 

1557
01:21:27,611 --> 01:21:30,880
find certain holes and hacks.
And once they get those hacks,

1558
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:32,853
they use them to leverage power.
And governments play this game all the 

1559
01:21:36,971 --> 01:21:37,691
time.
And you know,

1560
01:21:37,691 --> 01:21:42,691
there's a pretty strong argument that 
the murder was a product of one of these

1561
01:21:43,751 --> 01:21:44,584
exploits which was then going to be 
revealed and the need to cover up the 

1562
01:21:48,161 --> 01:21:50,050
fact that there was such an exploit out 
there.

1563
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:51,460
What is this?
I didn't know this.

1564
01:21:51,461 --> 01:21:52,570
What is this about?
What's.

1565
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,190
So the basic idea is that,
that,

1566
01:21:54,490 --> 01:21:56,230
you know,
these companies and many of them,

1567
01:21:56,290 --> 01:21:57,880
um,
most prominent ones here,

1568
01:21:57,881 --> 01:21:58,714
israeli companies who facilitate the 
ability of governments to buy access to 

1569
01:22:03,821 --> 01:22:05,200
your phone,
right?

1570
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:07,770
And the standard way in which this has 
done is to,

1571
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:11,770
is to pierce the security by sending you
something that you click on it,

1572
01:22:11,771 --> 01:22:12,604
it then embeds itself in the phone.
And there's no way you see it in a way 

1573
01:22:15,821 --> 01:22:18,650
that it can be blocked.
But there's,

1574
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:19,653
there's rumors now that in fact we've 
got something more than that going on 

1575
01:22:21,971 --> 01:22:22,804
where all they need to do is get your 
telephone number and they're able to 

1576
01:22:24,221 --> 01:22:26,290
hack into the system to get access to 
your phone.

1577
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,513
But the point is these companies have a 
market now for selling this type of 

1578
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:34,810
insecurity.

1579
01:22:34,810 --> 01:22:35,643
So like,
sell the ability for you to get access 

1580
01:22:37,541 --> 01:22:39,210
here and the story that,
you know,

1581
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,720
I don't have a lot of reasons to,
to,

1582
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,673
to be absolutely confident about this 
except that I trust the person who's 

1583
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,880
inside the security world that says this
to me.

1584
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:50,220
Um,
you knoW,

1585
01:22:50,221 --> 01:22:53,330
the story is that this is part of what 
happened in the [inaudible] context,

1586
01:22:53,331 --> 01:22:57,370
that the saudis have exploited this in a
way that was going to be revealed.

1587
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:01,330
And,
and the simple solution to that eventual

1588
01:23:01,331 --> 01:23:03,910
revelation was to remove the person who 
would reveal it.

1589
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:04,870
And that's why.

1590
01:23:06,380 --> 01:23:06,821
Yeah.
So,

1591
01:23:06,821 --> 01:23:07,654
so this,
the point about the recognize at these 

1592
01:23:08,591 --> 01:23:12,130
funds on the one hand for the ordinary 
life,

1593
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:14,080
it's more secure than anything you've 
ever had,

1594
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,453
but in the other hand,
systematically it's building insecurity 

1595
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:22,540
into our lives in a way that can be 
exploited by powerful people.

1596
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:25,240
And for most people,
doesn't matter.

1597
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:26,740
Like most people,
ordinary,

1598
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,320
ordinary joes,
uh,

1599
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:30,100
you know,
they're not,

1600
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:30,933
they're never going to be vulnerable 
because nobody's going to spend a 

1601
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:35,320
million dollars to get a hack against 
the individual person.

1602
01:23:35,321 --> 01:23:36,154
When I hear that from a person 
justifying why they don't worry about 

1603
01:23:38,891 --> 01:23:39,970
it,
it drives me crazy.

1604
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,190
I can't do anything.
What are they going to do?

1605
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:44,980
I'm a clean,
don't worry about me,

1606
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:45,843
but it's not.
That's not what we're doing when we're 

1607
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:47,913
talking about right?
Because if we have a system where 

1608
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:50,224
systematically powerful people can just 
push a button and like find a way to 

1609
01:23:53,710 --> 01:23:56,760
control,
you can control anybody jamal custodian,

1610
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:02,380
then we've got a system that no longer 
makes it possible for ordinary people to

1611
01:24:02,381 --> 01:24:03,820
stand up to power.
That's,

1612
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:05,850
that's basically what it is.
Like this is the,

1613
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:06,723
this is a structure that allows powerful
people if it is insecure to protect 

1614
01:24:11,081 --> 01:24:14,200
themselves because they can just 
leverage that against us.

1615
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:14,921
And I think,
you know,

1616
01:24:14,921 --> 01:24:15,754
this is a completely an focused problem.
Like nobody is talking about this 

1617
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:23,440
politically,
but the market for this commercialized x

1618
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:28,660
security exploits is hugely important 
and we've got to find a way to,

1619
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:29,613
to address it.

1620
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:36,420
So is it feasible that as technology 
advances and as the security advances as

1621
01:24:39,191 --> 01:24:41,200
well,
I mean the biometrics that we have today

1622
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:45,010
are far greater than the passwords that 
we use just a few years ago,

1623
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:48,850
that there could be something that you 
can't exploit,

1624
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:49,953
especially considering open source 
variance where they can be checked by 

1625
01:24:53,111 --> 01:24:53,900
the community.
Yeah.

1626
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:56,520
So,
so,

1627
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:57,533
so the problem is,
is not the kind of particular 

1628
01:24:59,351 --> 01:25:02,230
technologies working the way you intend 
them to work.

1629
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:03,263
You know,
if you've got great biometric 

1630
01:25:04,061 --> 01:25:04,894
technologies,
those are really good at making sure in 

1631
01:25:08,651 --> 01:25:11,440
the ordinary case that you're the right 
person using your phone.

1632
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:17,330
The problem iS the code is so big and so
complicated that there's always going to

1633
01:25:19,241 --> 01:25:20,074
be little bugs inside the code and what 
these exploits are are like coders who 

1634
01:25:25,391 --> 01:25:26,224
like poke at the code looking for these 
little hooks and they link one hook to 

1635
01:25:31,421 --> 01:25:32,254
another hook to another hook and then 
they find the way in to exploit the 

1636
01:25:34,571 --> 01:25:36,670
system.
So the exploits are never.

1637
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:38,500
Well I shouldn't say never.
there's another story.

1638
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:40,600
It's important to recognize.
I'll talk about that a second,

1639
01:25:40,601 --> 01:25:43,870
but the exploits are not in the main 
case intended by anybody.

1640
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:45,123
It's just the un.
It's just the natural consequence of 

1641
01:25:47,411 --> 01:25:48,244
having,
you know,

1642
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:53,170
literally hundreds or millions of lines 
of code that go into making this machine

1643
01:25:53,171 --> 01:25:54,004
work and that's what's beinG exploited.
And when you have a world like the 

1644
01:25:56,771 --> 01:25:59,650
iphone,
which is mono culture,

1645
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:00,341
like,
you know,

1646
01:26:00,341 --> 01:26:01,174
everybody has the same operatinG system 
where it seemed versions of the 

1647
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:04,070
operating system,
if you find

1648
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:04,903
an exploit in the,
in the ios and apple doesn't know about 

1649
01:26:08,571 --> 01:26:09,430
it,
um,

1650
01:26:09,490 --> 01:26:11,660
and you can exploit it for six months or
a year.

1651
01:26:11,661 --> 01:26:12,494
You can do a lot of damage to a lot of 
people's lives before anybody gets 

1652
01:26:15,441 --> 01:26:16,610
around to,
to blocking it.

1653
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:17,900
Now,
you know,

1654
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:18,733
that's even in the best case where 
everybody's working hard to make their 

1655
01:26:21,231 --> 01:26:24,110
system as secure as it can.
It can be,

1656
01:26:24,111 --> 01:26:24,944
you know,
there was this period after the nine 

1657
01:26:28,491 --> 01:26:30,580
slash 11 when there's,
you know,

1658
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:31,483
very strong and credible allegations 
that the United States government went 

1659
01:26:33,471 --> 01:26:36,260
around to these technology companies and
said,

1660
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:39,470
we need you to build back doors into 
your technology.

1661
01:26:39,471 --> 01:26:40,304
So we can track down the terrorists and 
there's strong allegations that in fact 

1662
01:26:43,881 --> 01:26:48,881
many of the most important technology 
companies complied and what they quickly

1663
01:26:49,101 --> 01:26:49,934
discovered is that the backdoor is 
intended for the United States 

1664
01:26:52,311 --> 01:26:53,144
government trying to attack terrorists 
were being exploited by the chinese 

1665
01:26:55,731 --> 01:26:58,250
trying to steal trade secrets from 
american company.

1666
01:26:58,251 --> 01:26:59,084
So this infrastructure that was intended
to be secure to protect american 

1667
01:27:02,061 --> 01:27:02,894
companies so that they could do their 
work without being asked for an 

1668
01:27:06,891 --> 01:27:07,724
espionage on top of them became an 
infrastructure of espionage again 

1669
01:27:10,881 --> 01:27:15,170
because it's so complicated to get it 
perfectly right.

1670
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,460
And,
um,

1671
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:21,460
the return from exploit is so huge that 
you can just expect the market is always

1672
01:27:21,861 --> 01:27:22,694
going to supply it.
What was the other example that you're 

1673
01:27:24,381 --> 01:27:25,214
going to bring up that was,
that was the idea was that the intended 

1674
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:30,770
backdoors that turn out to be exploited 
for other purposes,

1675
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:33,403
but isn't the system itself like when 
you deal with the hanging chads or pay 

1676
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:40,520
terrible,
their counters ridiculous.

1677
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:43,790
You're living giving it up to human 
beings.

1678
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,700
The potential for errors.
Massive,

1679
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:49,040
right?
Just to count things up or the potential

1680
01:27:49,041 --> 01:27:49,874
for corruption.
The decision to ignore certain 

1681
01:27:51,921 --> 01:27:53,250
collections,
I mean this,

1682
01:27:53,251 --> 01:27:54,620
this has all been documented,
right?

1683
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:55,623
Yeah,
and all of this follows from the fact 

1684
01:27:57,401 --> 01:27:59,020
that we,
bizarrely in America,

1685
01:27:59,021 --> 01:28:02,020
unlike most mature democracies around 
the world,

1686
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:05,830
make the running of elections a partisan
event like,

1687
01:28:05,831 --> 01:28:06,664
you know,
republicans in a district or democrats 

1688
01:28:08,801 --> 01:28:10,960
in a district control the voting 
systems.

1689
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:14,350
Like why the hell would that be?
Why don't we have like people who,

1690
01:28:14,610 --> 01:28:19,510
who self identity and professional 
framework is nonpartisan,

1691
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:21,700
independent,
like election commission.

1692
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,541
That's about,
you know,

1693
01:28:22,541 --> 01:28:26,830
it's above the partisan bow so that 
there's no incentive in Georgia,

1694
01:28:27,190 --> 01:28:28,023
for example,
for the government to allocate money to 

1695
01:28:30,761 --> 01:28:31,594
fix voting machines just in republican 
districts and not in democratic 

1696
01:28:34,361 --> 01:28:39,160
districts or there's no incentive to 
shut down a voting polling place,

1697
01:28:39,161 --> 01:28:39,994
which they did in Georgia,
making it so that people in that area 

1698
01:28:41,861 --> 01:28:44,020
would have to go huge distance to be 
able to vote,

1699
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:45,273
were to create it so that it takes seven
hours to vote in some districts and 20 

1700
01:28:48,161 --> 01:28:49,390
minutes to vote in other districts.

1701
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:50,223
There's no incentive to do that if your 
job is simply to make it possible for 

1702
01:28:53,681 --> 01:28:55,910
people to vote efficiently and if we 
measure you and,

1703
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:56,773
and,
and reward you based on how easy have 

1704
01:28:59,171 --> 01:29:02,250
you made it for people in this state,
devote easily and efficiently.

1705
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:03,563
We don't get that kind of efficiencY.
We don't get that kind of innovation 

1706
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:08,730
because it's a rigged game.
You,

1707
01:29:08,731 --> 01:29:10,830
you know,
you might have people who,

1708
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,580
I'm sure many of these people are above 
partisan motivation,

1709
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:15,653
but we also know that many of these 
people are deeply motivated by partisan 

1710
01:29:18,031 --> 01:29:18,864
politics,
especially at that kind of middle level 

1711
01:29:20,581 --> 01:29:21,414
of party politics.
And if theY can set it up so that their 

1712
01:29:24,331 --> 01:29:25,164
side winds because of the way they've 
played the game for allocating voting 

1713
01:29:28,951 --> 01:29:30,780
resources,
then more power to them.

1714
01:29:30,781 --> 01:29:31,614
And that'S exactly what happened in 
Georgia with this recent governor's 

1715
01:29:33,661 --> 01:29:34,494
election.
That kind of outrageous that the man 

1716
01:29:36,271 --> 01:29:37,104
running the election system,
secretary of state does not resign from 

1717
01:29:41,341 --> 01:29:42,174
this job as he runs for governor.
And the governorship is decided in such 

1718
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:49,950
a very close way by,
um,

1719
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:54,270
the decisions that he made about how 
they're going to throw people off.

1720
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:58,590
The voting roles are which allocations 
of voting system technology will be made

1721
01:29:58,591 --> 01:29:59,424
across the state.
This is a product or just making it 

1722
01:30:00,951 --> 01:30:03,060
political.
we could make it non political and might

1723
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,980
not have all of these kinds of problems

1724
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:06,743
dealing with this very unique landscape 
now of google and facebook and twitter 

1725
01:30:11,581 --> 01:30:12,414
And instagram and all these different 
social media groups that have a vested 

1726
01:30:16,561 --> 01:30:20,760
interest in a specific narrative being 
portrayed.

1727
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:24,000
And spi.
One thing specifically is,

1728
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:26,190
and this is being addressed right now in
congress,

1729
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:31,460
is the discrimination against 
conservative voices and there's a lot of

1730
01:30:31,981 --> 01:30:32,814
denial that.
But there's also a lot of evidence that 

1731
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:35,473
that is the case and that they feel like
they have some moral or ethical 

1732
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:40,374
obligation to suppress certain 
conservative voices for whatever reason 

1733
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:49,860
and push the narrative of,
of progressive and liberal voices.

1734
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,860
This is a very strange thing because 
the,

1735
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:53,783
the amount of influence that something 
like google or facebook has today is 

1736
01:30:57,511 --> 01:31:02,511
arguably as great or greater than the 
sean hannity's of the world and the cnns

1737
01:31:03,931 --> 01:31:04,780
and the,
the,

1738
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,800
the,
the traditional news outlets.

1739
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:09,130
yeah.
So no doubt.

1740
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:10,863
There's a big debate about whether they 
were more important in 2016 than the 

1741
01:31:15,431 --> 01:31:17,230
cable stations.
My colleague yoke,

1742
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:19,870
benkler has a book that argues pretty 
powerfully.

1743
01:31:19,871 --> 01:31:20,704
I think that it was actually the cable 
stations that were more responsible for 

1744
01:31:23,381 --> 01:31:26,770
the result then the facebooks,
but whether in 2016 they are,

1745
01:31:26,771 --> 01:31:29,770
the more powerful someday in the future,
they are going to be more powerful.

1746
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,720
Certainly powerful.
Absolutely.

1747
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:33,730
Um,
and you know,

1748
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:38,290
the question is what we mean by bias or 
discrimination here.

1749
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:38,891
Like,
you know,

1750
01:31:38,891 --> 01:31:39,724
in 2017 in the fall it was revealed that
facebook was selling ads for people who 

1751
01:31:45,551 --> 01:31:48,460
wanted to target quote jew haters.
Okay.

1752
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:51,460
So you could go and you could buy ads 
for jew haters.

1753
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:53,440
Now there was never.
How did that work?

1754
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:54,070
Okay.
No,

1755
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:54,581
I mean,
you know,

1756
01:31:54,581 --> 01:31:57,460
they have lots of categories you get to 
pick when you buy facebook ads,

1757
01:31:57,490 --> 01:32:00,190
you know,
liberals or people who people over 60

1758
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:01,023
white armor.
This was one of the categories that was 

1759
01:32:02,441 --> 01:32:04,750
exposed.
You could buy ads for jew haters.

1760
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,750
There was an actual category.
Yeah,

1761
01:32:06,870 --> 01:32:07,690
yeah.
What?

1762
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:08,523
Yeah.
Now there was never a time that a 

1763
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:11,524
facebook engineer or a marketing person 
decided we ought to create a jew hater 

1764
01:32:15,251 --> 01:32:16,090
category.
Right.

1765
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:20,860
This is not a decision of any human.
It was the product of the machine,

1766
01:32:20,861 --> 01:32:24,430
the ai that was developing the 
categories based on what they saw people

1767
01:32:24,431 --> 01:32:25,264
happen to be interested in and then 
throw up categories to see what sticks 

1768
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:31,210
and then certain categories stick and 
then they run with them.

1769
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:33,220
So it.
So you might say,

1770
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,360
you know,
if you were the,

1771
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:36,100
you know,
anti defamation league,

1772
01:32:36,101 --> 01:32:37,330
you would say,
oh my god,

1773
01:32:37,331 --> 01:32:42,331
facebook is discriminating to encourage 
jew haters.

1774
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:47,260
But from another perspective,
you're like the machines doing it,

1775
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:48,820
no doubt.
But,

1776
01:32:48,821 --> 01:32:49,654
uh,
but to what extent do you want to say 

1777
01:32:50,501 --> 01:32:51,550
facebook is doing it?

1778
01:32:51,970 --> 01:32:54,790
And I Think that's off.
That's often what you're going to see in

1779
01:32:54,791 --> 01:32:55,624
this argument about whether they're 
quote biasing the system against one 

1780
01:32:58,781 --> 01:32:59,770
side or the other,
you know,

1781
01:32:59,771 --> 01:33:00,604
like this hilarious a hearing that was 
just held on capital hill two days ago 

1782
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:06,603
where a great congressman lewis,
like if you don't want negative ad 

1783
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:13,640
results in the suit,
then don't do bad things.

1784
01:33:13,641 --> 01:33:14,510
So then,
um,

1785
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:15,281
so,
you know,

1786
01:33:15,281 --> 01:33:17,590
I think this is quite fun.
It was really funny.

1787
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:20,230
It,
this is like nobody's intent.

1788
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:22,420
We should just explain that to people 
who don't know what we're talking about.

1789
01:33:22,450 --> 01:33:22,840
Yeah.
So,

1790
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:23,673
so there was an argument about whether 
google was tilting the ads to embarrass 

1791
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:32,700
one side or the other and uh,
I guess it was a congressman from Iowa,

1792
01:33:34,211 --> 01:33:35,044
everybody like that.
That's the guy who didn't know that 

1793
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:39,060
google didn't make the iphone.
Yeah,

1794
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:40,030
he got embarrassed.

1795
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:41,440
But anyway,
there was thIs,

1796
01:33:41,441 --> 01:33:41,981
um,
you know,

1797
01:33:41,981 --> 01:33:42,814
the exchange was basically here I'm 
going to show you a demonstration and 

1798
01:33:44,891 --> 01:33:49,210
they put it in a certain name and 
congressman smith and then up comes this

1799
01:33:49,211 --> 01:33:52,460
are referenced to his race baiting and 
he's like,

1800
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,313
outraged by this and you know,
so one theory is you've got google 

1801
01:33:56,321 --> 01:33:58,990
engineers down there saying let's get 
congressman smith so we're going to make

1802
01:33:58,991 --> 01:34:01,150
it so every time you put smith in their 
upcoming race baiting,

1803
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:02,510
but google's response was,
look,

1804
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:04,113
we don't do individualized search 
results like we give people what we 

1805
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:07,624
think people want based on what they've 
done in the past and what they've shown 

1806
01:34:10,841 --> 01:34:13,240
interest in.
And so that's what's producing this,

1807
01:34:13,241 --> 01:34:14,074
hits the machine that's producing this 
result and that let congress lou come 

1808
01:34:17,561 --> 01:34:19,960
back with,
if you don't like the connections,

1809
01:34:19,961 --> 01:34:20,794
than just don't enable them to be made 
by doing things like don't do things 

1810
01:34:23,711 --> 01:34:24,850
like race baiting.
Yeah.

1811
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:27,340
If you don't want negative search 
results,

1812
01:34:27,341 --> 01:34:29,590
don't do negative,
which is a pretty.

1813
01:34:29,910 --> 01:34:30,743
But.
But I do think tHat there's a really 

1814
01:34:31,871 --> 01:34:32,704
hard problem here.
When you say it's the machine is doing 

1815
01:34:36,221 --> 01:34:37,160
it,
you know,

1816
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:41,170
what's the future gonna be like when we 
can just say it's not my problem,

1817
01:34:41,171 --> 01:34:43,830
it's the machine that,
this is just facebook though when,

1818
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:44,913
when you're talking about,
or google rather when you're talking 

1819
01:34:47,111 --> 01:34:47,944
about twitter,
twitter has a different issue and their 

1820
01:34:50,981 --> 01:34:51,814
issue is there's accusations of shadow 
banning that they have decided that 

1821
01:34:56,141 --> 01:34:58,190
they're going to silent voices

1822
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,023
or make that much more difficult to find
or eliminate them from certain people's 

1823
01:35:02,751 --> 01:35:04,300
feeds,
you know,

1824
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:06,190
and they're doing this,
this,

1825
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:09,920
the allegation that they're doing this 
based on their own personal preferences,

1826
01:35:09,921 --> 01:35:10,754
their,
their beliefs that they're progressive 

1827
01:35:13,581 --> 01:35:14,414
ideology wants them to lean left and 
somehow or another distribute that 

1828
01:35:21,411 --> 01:35:24,020
information in a much more left leaning 
way.

1829
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:29,280
And I hear these and I don't not an 
expert on what they're doing.

1830
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,510
And I wouldn't be surprised if,
you know,

1831
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:33,443
certain complaints come in about certain
feeds and they say we're going to take 

1832
01:35:35,281 --> 01:35:37,740
these off and that's the allegation.
And they haven't denied that.

1833
01:35:38,910 --> 01:35:39,720
And,
you know,

1834
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:42,080
quite frankly,
some of these feeds,

1835
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:43,770
you know,
Alex Jones stuff,

1836
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:44,730
um,
you know,

1837
01:35:44,731 --> 01:35:45,564
if you're,
the consequences of your news show is 

1838
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:49,284
that somebody takes a gun to a pizza 
shop in chicago in Washington to try to 

1839
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:57,210
prove that hillary clinton is running a 
sex slave operation in the basement.

1840
01:35:57,510 --> 01:35:58,343
There's something wrong with what's 
going on their child second child sex 

1841
01:36:01,501 --> 01:36:02,334
life,
right?

1842
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:03,293
Um,
so I understand why they feel like 

1843
01:36:04,561 --> 01:36:06,770
they're a responsible there.
And you know,

1844
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:09,390
it was recognized in the very beginning.
These companies have said we're going to

1845
01:36:09,391 --> 01:36:12,930
try to create a certain kind of 
environment like so facebook required.

1846
01:36:12,931 --> 01:36:13,764
You identify yourself so that under the 
shadows of anonymity you wouldn't be 

1847
01:36:17,191 --> 01:36:20,010
causing wreaking lots of havoc inside 
the system.

1848
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:21,263
But look,
I think the more fundamental problem 

1849
01:36:22,591 --> 01:36:24,840
here.
So what I've said so far,

1850
01:36:24,841 --> 01:36:26,640
people like google and facebook might 
like,

1851
01:36:26,641 --> 01:36:27,474
here's stuff they're going to hate.
The more fundamental problem here is 

1852
01:36:31,351 --> 01:36:32,184
that we have no antitrust enforcement of
any of these companies against any of 

1853
01:36:35,281 --> 01:36:36,114
these companies.
And we've allowed them to become so 

1854
01:36:37,981 --> 01:36:42,510
incredibly powerful without any 
justification under the law.

1855
01:36:42,760 --> 01:36:43,593
Isn't the issue though,
that this was never anticipated that 

1856
01:36:45,701 --> 01:36:48,310
this is when they created twitter,
they didn't think of it?

1857
01:36:48,311 --> 01:36:49,144
It's going to be.
It's going to be some voice of 

1858
01:36:50,290 --> 01:36:53,380
distribution of information that's 
unprecedenteD worldwide,

1859
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,090
but that's what it is.

1860
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:56,440
Yeah.
No,

1861
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:57,373
they didn't expect no doubt.
They didn't expect it to work exactly 

1862
01:36:59,871 --> 01:37:00,704
the way it worked,
but the antitrust law has from the 

1863
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:03,614
beginning had standards that should have
said we need to step in and certain 

1864
01:37:05,811 --> 01:37:06,890
places.
So for example,

1865
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:07,783
in 2010,
facebook is facing a pretty powerful 

1866
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:15,920
competitive threat from instagram.
And uh,

1867
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:19,820
the question is what they're gonna do 
like it's cooler to be instagram.

1868
01:37:19,821 --> 01:37:20,654
It's kids are using it much with the 
growth rate is much faster in an 

1869
01:37:24,831 --> 01:37:27,260
ordinary competitive market.
What they would do is they would build a

1870
01:37:27,261 --> 01:37:30,020
better product to compete with 
instagram.

1871
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:31,423
Their response was to write a check for 
a billion dollars and they bought 

1872
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:37,070
instagram and um,
and they've bought a whole bunch of.

1873
01:37:37,071 --> 01:37:38,810
Other companies clearly have whatsapp,
which you know,

1874
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:43,820
was a very important competitor in.
People believe they're really secure way

1875
01:37:44,271 --> 01:37:47,760
to communicate to them.
They by boston dynamics to have that.

1876
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:49,070
That's amazing.
There's a.

1877
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:50,403
There's a wikipedia page that has like 
endless list of companies that they've 

1878
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,680
bought.
They're buying robots.

1879
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:55,710
Yeah,
that makes sense.

1880
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:01,920
Funnel if that's true,
but the point is antitrust law in any of

1881
01:38:02,761 --> 01:38:03,594
these moments should have in 
historically would have stepped in and 

1882
01:38:06,451 --> 01:38:07,320
said,
wait a minute,

1883
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:08,393
wait a minute.
You can't buy your way into complete 

1884
01:38:10,741 --> 01:38:11,574
dominance of these markets.
And I think one of the biggest changes 

1885
01:38:15,511 --> 01:38:16,344
that's happened in the last 20 years is 
at the antitrust department has Just 

1886
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:22,440
shot up its doors and just stopped doing
its work.

1887
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:23,453
So if we had a more Competitive internet
environment where companies had to 

1888
01:38:30,241 --> 01:38:34,110
compete against each other,
you'd have companies that try to compete

1889
01:38:34,111 --> 01:38:34,944
by protecting your privacy differently,
by refusing to sell your information 

1890
01:38:37,891 --> 01:38:40,230
differently.
You'd have lots of pressure on companies

1891
01:38:40,231 --> 01:38:41,064
like facebook to behave,
not because idiot senators who don't 

1892
01:38:43,981 --> 01:38:46,560
know how facebook works or calling them 
before hearings,

1893
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:47,753
but because the market itself is 
creating the competition that drives 

1894
01:38:50,431 --> 01:38:53,340
them to behave in a way that actually 
conforms with what consumers want.

1895
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:54,533
So I agree with you.
These are real questions and important 

1896
01:38:57,031 --> 01:38:57,864
questions to figure out are they biasing
in one way or the other and if they're 

1897
01:39:00,451 --> 01:39:03,510
biasing systematically,
that's a really important problem,

1898
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:07,800
but the solution to that problem might 
not be more government regulation.

1899
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:08,873
The solution to that problem might be 
governments making sure we have the 

1900
01:39:11,041 --> 01:39:11,874
right kind of competition going on here 
so that they can't get away with 

1901
01:39:15,061 --> 01:39:15,894
behaving

1902
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,080
well.
What would be that right?

1903
01:39:17,081 --> 01:39:17,914
Comic effect.
Google bought it and they actually sold 

1904
01:39:20,501 --> 01:39:21,860
it last year.
Oh yeah.

1905
01:39:22,510 --> 01:39:24,370
Interesting.
Probably sold to the russians,

1906
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,720
the Japanese,
japanese.

1907
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:32,050
These like what would be the right kind 
of competition?

1908
01:39:32,051 --> 01:39:34,000
It would have to be something that 
balances it out,

1909
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:34,834
right?
Like some sort of a right wing social 

1910
01:39:36,551 --> 01:39:37,384
media platform,
but those tend to get infested with 

1911
01:39:40,211 --> 01:39:44,230
trolls and four chan type people.
Then as soon as you say,

1912
01:39:44,410 --> 01:39:46,300
we're not gonna,
have any regulation.

1913
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:49,030
I Mean the idea would be right.
you say,

1914
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:51,190
oh,
google and facebook,

1915
01:39:51,191 --> 01:39:53,110
they are so progressive.
They lean left,

1916
01:39:53,111 --> 01:39:57,970
they suppress conservative voices and 
they don't believe in freedom of speech,

1917
01:39:57,971 --> 01:39:58,804
so we're going to create a right wing 
platform that allows freedom of speech 

1918
01:40:02,831 --> 01:40:03,664
and doesn't suppress conservative voices
and you know what happens to those 

1919
01:40:06,161 --> 01:40:06,994
things?
They get infested by four chan people 

1920
01:40:09,941 --> 01:40:13,090
and the pepe the frog people and they 
start saying racist things.

1921
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:14,860
If I could say anything,
I'll say anything,

1922
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:19,330
anything means anything,
and that's a real problem in today's day

1923
01:40:19,331 --> 01:40:20,164
and age because there's a lot of bored 
people out there and they get excited 

1924
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:23,583
about a platform where they can say 
something that they know is completely 

1925
01:40:27,161 --> 01:40:30,760
outrageous under an anonymous screen 
name and people think,

1926
01:40:30,761 --> 01:40:31,594
well,
this is indicative of a person's actual 

1927
01:40:32,771 --> 01:40:35,140
real beliefs.
Sometimes.

1928
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:36,123
Sometimes it's board people that are 
trying to fuck with people and they're 

1929
01:40:38,771 --> 01:40:39,604
trying to get a rise out of folks and 
they know that if they write a bunch of 

1930
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:43,213
words and heil hitler,
that it's going to get a reaction and 

1931
01:40:46,091 --> 01:40:48,310
then they'll check it every couple of 
minutes to see what kind of,

1932
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:50,110
ah,
look at all these people getting mad.

1933
01:40:50,111 --> 01:40:52,510
Ha ha.
This is what happens.

1934
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:53,463
So incredibly progressive tea tends to,
when you think of someone as being 

1935
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,080
progressive or be having a progressive 
voice,

1936
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,570
you tend to think of being inclusive,
you know,

1937
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:05,913
not supporting homophobia,
being open to all sorts of different 

1938
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:13,930
marginalized groups rights.
But when you think of conservative,

1939
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:14,973
you open the door for a lot of people 
that are rejected by these progressive 

1940
01:41:19,751 --> 01:41:23,200
groups and they Might not necessarily be
conservative,

1941
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:26,950
but they are not welcome in these 
progressive spaces.

1942
01:41:26,951 --> 01:41:29,060
So they come out to these new places and
they,

1943
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,330
it turns into a dumpster fire.

1944
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,170
Yeah.
Look,

1945
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:36,590
the stoRy you just described is the 
story of cable television.

1946
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:42,510
Cable television is that at a certain 
point people like robert roger ailes and

1947
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:46,850
murdoch's decided that we didn't have 
enough conservative media out there.

1948
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:50,480
And so they funded not just magazines 
like the new republic,

1949
01:41:50,481 --> 01:41:53,700
but they funded the beginning of cable 
television and um,

1950
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:54,743
and that created this bifurcation in 
media with cable television and one 

1951
01:42:00,201 --> 01:42:02,150
could make these observations about,
I mean,

1952
01:42:02,270 --> 01:42:03,103
this is what you'll have done.
Clare's book is all about like what the 

1953
01:42:04,791 --> 01:42:05,624
nature of truth is on cable television 
on the right is different from what it 

1954
01:42:08,871 --> 01:42:09,704
is on the left.
So I think that's all fair and I don't 

1955
01:42:13,071 --> 01:42:13,904
think anybody has a clear sense of what 
the right answer looks like in this 

1956
01:42:17,901 --> 01:42:18,800
space.
I mean,

1957
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,480
the reality is,
you know,

1958
01:42:20,481 --> 01:42:23,000
facebook is a technology.
I'm here,

1959
01:42:23,090 --> 01:42:24,890
facebook friends are going to really 
hate me for this,

1960
01:42:24,891 --> 01:42:25,724
but here facebook is a technology to 
exploit insecurity for the purpose of 

1961
01:42:29,901 --> 01:42:31,730
selling ads.
That's what it does.

1962
01:42:32,090 --> 01:42:35,090
What it does is make you feel like 
you've checked and you're like,

1963
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:38,270
why didn't she like that photograph or 
why isn't he friended me?

1964
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:39,493
And so you constantly engage because 
you're constantly trying to feed this 

1965
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:50,210
feedback and that is exploiting tristan,
tristan harris.

1966
01:42:50,211 --> 01:42:53,540
HiS work Is really a powerful here is 
exploiting your insecurity.

1967
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:54,633
Is that really what it is?
Because I've always thought about it as 

1968
01:42:55,971 --> 01:42:56,804
being a fast food version of the 
nutrients that we're missing in an 

1969
01:43:00,201 --> 01:43:01,430
actual real community.

1970
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:02,263
That's so good.
That's exactly the right way to think 

1971
01:43:03,911 --> 01:43:04,744
about it,
but just in the same way that fast food 

1972
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:07,293
companies figure out how to exploit the 
brain chemistry that makes it so that 

1973
01:43:11,591 --> 01:43:13,310
you eat chicken wings,
you know,

1974
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:17,020
barbecue chicken wings because they know
that's what's going to feed that kind of

1975
01:43:17,021 --> 01:43:19,240
addiction and just like gaming 
companies,

1976
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:23,740
figure out how to tweak the game so that
they'd know how to get the addiction out

1977
01:43:23,741 --> 01:43:24,574
of your kids.
This company is really great at getting 

1978
01:43:28,631 --> 01:43:29,464
you to like turnover as much as you can 
to them to builD you into this quote 

1979
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:35,230
community.
Why are they doing that?

1980
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:36,423
Not because mark zuckerberg has come,
some kind of freaky guy who wants to 

1981
01:43:38,711 --> 01:43:39,544
know your secrets,
but because the more you turn over to 

1982
01:43:41,711 --> 01:43:42,544
them,
the better their ads are in feeding you 

1983
01:43:45,491 --> 01:43:46,324
information.
So this is a technology for the purpose 

1984
01:43:48,761 --> 01:43:52,040
of engendering advertising and so that

1985
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,810
advertising gets really,
really good.

1986
01:43:54,290 --> 01:43:54,831
And so,
you know,

1987
01:43:54,831 --> 01:43:57,620
you could say that facebook is tilted to
the left,

1988
01:43:57,621 --> 01:43:58,454
but the reality is there is an 
extraordinary amount of exploitation of 

1989
01:44:01,191 --> 01:44:04,550
the advertising inside of facebook to 
feed information to the right.

1990
01:44:04,551 --> 01:44:06,210
In this last election,
I mean as much,

1991
01:44:06,570 --> 01:44:08,810
I'm Kathleen Hall,
jayman says book about this.

1992
01:44:08,811 --> 01:44:09,644
It's really quite amazing and 
documenting and that's because it's 

1993
01:44:13,461 --> 01:44:14,294
gotten really good at being able to 
segment markets on the basis of what 

1994
01:44:16,701 --> 01:44:18,440
people know or care about.
Again,

1995
01:44:18,441 --> 01:44:21,020
not because anybody planned it,
nobody wrote jew hater,

1996
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:23,570
but because the ai is smart enough to 
figure that out,

1997
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:24,823
and so when you build this technology 
that is driven to the purpose of making 

1998
01:44:29,301 --> 01:44:30,134
it easier to sell ads,
you produced this world that has no 

1999
01:44:34,731 --> 01:44:37,880
necessary connection to figure people 
figuring out what the truth is.

2000
01:44:37,881 --> 01:44:39,110
Again,
think of cable television.

2001
01:44:39,110 --> 01:44:42,860
Cable television is about building 
really loyal community,

2002
01:44:43,220 --> 01:44:44,990
building the tribal sense of the 
community.

2003
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:48,140
If telling the truth did that,
they would tell the truth.

2004
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,620
If not telling the truth does that they 
will not tell the truth.

2005
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:54,410
The question is not whether you're 
telling the truth or not.

2006
01:44:54,411 --> 01:44:57,170
The question is what builds the 
advertising base.

2007
01:44:57,530 --> 01:44:58,363
And so this,
this reality that we have these 

2008
01:45:00,111 --> 01:45:03,040
platforms that are ad driven,
um,

2009
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:08,390
distort or constructs drives that 
platform to develop in certain ways.

2010
01:45:08,810 --> 01:45:10,640
And that's why I think it's important to
think,

2011
01:45:10,641 --> 01:45:11,474
well,
what if we could create a competitive 

2012
01:45:12,411 --> 01:45:13,244
environment where there were different 
platforms available once that we're not 

2013
01:45:15,891 --> 01:45:19,630
focused on driving ads and this is 
something that again,

2014
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:23,540
I think they fund those.
Isn't that the reason why something like

2015
01:45:23,541 --> 01:45:26,510
google or facebook has gotten so big is 
because of so much money behind it?

2016
01:45:26,540 --> 01:45:27,373
Well two things because they've been 
allowed to get so big and because so 

2017
01:45:29,721 --> 01:45:31,130
much money behind it stopped them.

2018
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:33,370
The antitrust departments,
people,

2019
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:35,000
antitrust department would step in and 
say,

2020
01:45:35,001 --> 01:45:36,830
facebook,
you become too successful.

2021
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:39,770
The way you're buying up competitors is 
disturbing to us.

2022
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:40,550
Well,
but again,

2023
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:42,350
the thing of the difference in that 
sentence,

2024
01:45:42,410 --> 01:45:44,810
you've become so successful.
That's one sentence.

2025
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:45,733
And what we want to do in America is 
encouraged companies to become 

2026
01:45:47,631 --> 01:45:49,010
successful.
I believe in,

2027
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:49,873
you know,
innovators and markets working that's 

2028
01:45:51,381 --> 01:45:52,214
really great,
but you've bought your competitor is a 

2029
01:45:54,981 --> 01:45:55,814
separate statement,
like you have a bunch of money because 

2030
01:45:57,441 --> 01:46:00,410
the stock is so valuable because people 
think you're the future of money,

2031
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:05,150
but then you turn and use that money to 
buy a competitor's.

2032
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:06,310
What do you put in up jamie?

2033
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:08,560
What is this?
That's the total number of they've spent

2034
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:09,820
in the last,
I don't know,

2035
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:12,250
I think it was seven years.
Saw the company as they bought.

2036
01:46:12,370 --> 01:46:13,181
Scroll back,
don't,

2037
01:46:13,181 --> 01:46:15,880
don't move.
Total cost of acquisitions.

2038
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:18,650
What does that $23,000,000,000,000.
Billion,

2039
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:20,290
billion.
Twenty $3,000,000,000

2040
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:24,220
more than the gross domestic product of 
Fiji.

2041
01:46:24,550 --> 01:46:28,150
Zimbabwe and mild dbs combined.
19 billion of that was for that one.

2042
01:46:28,330 --> 01:46:29,840
What's app?
Really?

2043
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:31,690
19 billion.
Yeah.

2044
01:46:33,990 --> 01:46:34,780
Anyway.
Yeah,

2045
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:35,613
so,
but the point is when you're talking 

2046
01:46:36,941 --> 01:46:37,774
about acquisitions,
you're not necessarily talking about 

2047
01:46:39,641 --> 01:46:41,500
companies that are succeeding because 
they're so good.

2048
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:43,330
Right?
So you know,

2049
01:46:43,331 --> 01:46:45,460
when you say what are the alternatives 
going to look like?

2050
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:48,340
It's a really hard question,
but we have some of it in real space.

2051
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:49,240
Like we understand

2052
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:54,030
npr has a different set of incentives 
from fox news.

2053
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:58,560
We understand podcasts have a different 
set of incentives from youtube videos,

2054
01:46:58,710 --> 01:46:59,543
right?
You do videos of a different kind of 

2055
01:47:01,111 --> 01:47:03,540
constraint.
If you did a three hour youtube video,

2056
01:47:04,980 --> 01:47:05,813
you would not live in the same way that 
you get to live in the context of 

2057
01:47:08,731 --> 01:47:11,030
podcasts.
But we do do a three hour youtube video,

2058
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:11,873
but it doesn't get the success that it 
gets because it's a three hour youtube 

2059
01:47:14,971 --> 01:47:15,804
video.
It's because people are committed to 

2060
01:47:16,801 --> 01:47:19,200
your podcast.
I mean I know these guys like a carry it

2061
01:47:19,201 --> 01:47:20,034
around and like when you get to a place 
where it sounds like it's going to be 

2062
01:47:22,261 --> 01:47:24,780
interesting to see what's on the video,
then they flip up the video.

2063
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:25,943
But.
But you know the average successful 

2064
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:30,630
youtube video,
if you do a political youtube video,

2065
01:47:30,631 --> 01:47:32,490
you're told you can't be more than two 
and a half minutes.

2066
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:36,120
Then you've lost people.
But the point is the environments.

2067
01:47:36,350 --> 01:47:37,880
I don't necessarily think that's 
correct.

2068
01:47:38,330 --> 01:47:39,163
Jordan peterson is doing a lot of really
long youtube videos that are very 

2069
01:47:41,121 --> 01:47:42,830
successful,
doesn't hurt as podcasts.

2070
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:44,273
There's a hunger right now for unedited 
thought and not edited in under an 

2071
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:52,453
uncensored in terms of language,
but in terms of no one influencing what 

2072
01:47:55,581 --> 01:47:56,414
you're saying.
So if you decided to do a podcast or a 

2073
01:47:58,611 --> 01:47:59,444
thing on youtube and no one was leaning 
over your shoulder with an agenda or a 

2074
01:48:03,711 --> 01:48:04,544
guideline to follow,
there's a real hunger for that because 

2075
01:48:06,861 --> 01:48:11,810
people feel like what you've described 
about facebook and cable news,

2076
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:13,460
that they're essentially just trying to 
sell you things,

2077
01:48:13,461 --> 01:48:16,100
keep you on the hook so they can profit 
from you.

2078
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:18,920
There's a real hunger for someone who's 
not doing that.

2079
01:48:18,980 --> 01:48:20,210
Right.
I agree.

2080
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:24,260
This is why I feel like there's got to 
be a market for news in that regard.

2081
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:27,440
Like an actual unbiased,
uncensored,

2082
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:30,980
raw,
truly objective centrist news station.

2083
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:33,470
Well,
again,

2084
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:34,333
I think that's the slow democracy 
movement that podcast feeds because the 

2085
01:48:38,541 --> 01:48:39,374
reality is if you had a simple way to be
watching in every second of your two 

2086
01:48:46,281 --> 01:48:47,720
hour,
three hour podcasts,

2087
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:52,700
what was working and what was not,
it'd be really hard for you to resist.

2088
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:53,860
I would resist.
Okay.

2089
01:48:53,870 --> 01:48:55,820
I wouldn't pay attention to the thing 
for a second car to you.

2090
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:57,730
I've already been faced with that 
before.

2091
01:48:57,731 --> 01:48:59,400
People have said to me,
oh,

2092
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:02,110
well this is when people start tuning.
Throw that away.

2093
01:49:02,170 --> 01:49:03,310
Yeah,
but you know,

2094
01:49:03,311 --> 01:49:04,144
I know friends,
chris hayes will tell you about life on 

2095
01:49:09,040 --> 01:49:10,320
msnbc where it.
see,

2096
01:49:10,330 --> 01:49:12,220
that's because of advertiser dollars.
Okay.

2097
01:49:12,221 --> 01:49:13,054
That's my point.
My point is the way to this is my whole 

2098
01:49:15,371 --> 01:49:16,204
point about this platform,
this platform is in advertising driven 

2099
01:49:18,401 --> 01:49:19,320
platform,
right?

2100
01:49:19,450 --> 01:49:20,283
That fact steers it in a certain way and
I saying we need to build alternative 

2101
01:49:24,761 --> 01:49:25,594
platforms,
which was what you're building and the 

2102
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:27,593
in the pocket.
It's not like advertising is not 

2103
01:49:28,421 --> 01:49:29,254
important to your stuff.
Of course you start with talking about 

2104
01:49:32,261 --> 01:49:34,060
certain products that help sponsor what 
you're doing.

2105
01:49:34,061 --> 01:49:36,490
So it's not anti market,
it's all for market.

2106
01:49:36,491 --> 01:49:37,324
But the point is it allows you to 
develop the content in a way that's not 

2107
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:42,033
micromanaged by the advertising dollar 
or the are the market incentive and 

2108
01:49:46,151 --> 01:49:47,980
that's critically.
It's

2109
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:48,813
also other people's incentive to get you
to do things in a way that they will 

2110
01:49:52,661 --> 01:49:56,440
feel they feel will be more profitable 
so that everybody gains.

2111
01:49:56,570 --> 01:49:58,450
Um,
I don't have those other people.

2112
01:49:58,570 --> 01:50:00,190
So there's no one else.
So if I,

2113
01:50:00,191 --> 01:50:02,050
but if I've done television shows 
before,

2114
01:50:02,051 --> 01:50:02,884
when you do television shows before you 
will have meetings with producers and 

2115
01:50:05,981 --> 01:50:09,250
they will have notes and they will tell 
you that this is hurting our bottom line

2116
01:50:09,251 --> 01:50:13,390
and this is not good for that or we have
to emphasize more of this or the network

2117
01:50:13,391 --> 01:50:14,224
wants that and it's really just about 
accentuating your ability to make more 

2118
01:50:17,561 --> 01:50:18,394
money.
Right?

2119
01:50:18,490 --> 01:50:19,323
Which is why we have to build these 
alternatives that can compete with the 

2120
01:50:22,781 --> 01:50:24,850
advertising driven platforms.
Well,

2121
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:29,770
if you could get a really entertaining 
news show on youtube or I mean,

2122
01:50:29,771 --> 01:50:32,310
I guess the young turks sorta tried 
doing that,

2123
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:36,910
but they leaned so hard left a bit,
but they attract an extraordinary number

2124
01:50:36,911 --> 01:50:37,960
of people and that's good.

2125
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:39,340
But again,
you know,

2126
01:50:39,430 --> 01:50:44,260
we have this image of like new shows 
have a version of walter cronkite.

2127
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,880
Maybe that's not what it is.
Maybe you know,

2128
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:50,560
the cupbearer report is a new show or 
something.

2129
01:50:50,561 --> 01:50:51,394
Who's someone is mocking it as they're 
delivering you the input that they're 

2130
01:50:53,051 --> 01:50:56,020
giving you the information.
Someone who's objective.

2131
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:57,610
I would like someone who's really 
objective,

2132
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:58,713
who talks about the negative 
applications of whatever law or bill 

2133
01:51:01,661 --> 01:51:04,690
it's being discussed.
Like what would be bad for everyone,

2134
01:51:04,691 --> 01:51:07,810
what would be good for democrats,
republicans,

2135
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:09,250
poor people,
rich people.

2136
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:10,263
You don't get that.
There's no version of that available 

2137
01:51:12,341 --> 01:51:13,174
right now.
every version leans towards whatever 

2138
01:51:15,431 --> 01:51:18,670
platform they're on,
whether it's fox news or msnbc.

2139
01:51:19,270 --> 01:51:22,300
Yeah.
I think not for want of trying.

2140
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:25,120
I just think the world doesn't support 
it,

2141
01:51:25,610 --> 01:51:26,443
but the world doesn't support it because
there's people are so tribal because 

2142
01:51:30,311 --> 01:51:31,144
they want to be either on the fox news 
camp or they want to be in the msnbc 

2143
01:51:34,361 --> 01:51:35,194
camp.
I really feel like there's a lot of 

2144
01:51:37,211 --> 01:51:41,400
people that just aren't being 
represented and folks like me who just.

2145
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:43,120
I want to know what,
what is happening?

2146
01:51:43,150 --> 01:51:45,040
Why?
Why is this the Case?

2147
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:46,053
Why is this leaning in this direction?
What's the real motivation behind this 

2148
01:51:49,841 --> 01:51:50,674
bill?
What's the real motivation behind these 

2149
01:51:52,001 --> 01:51:52,834
actions?

2150
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:53,973
Yeah,
and,

2151
01:51:54,890 --> 01:51:55,723
and the question is whether you're going
to get it from a single person who 

2152
01:51:58,781 --> 01:51:59,614
purports to be quote objective or 
whether you're going to get it from 

2153
01:52:02,501 --> 01:52:05,770
three or four people like reading across
these different perspectives.

2154
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:08,710
When I was a kid,
I was obsessed with the soviet union and

2155
01:52:08,711 --> 01:52:12,490
in 1982 I went to the soviet union.
I was like,

2156
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:16,510
I guess I was 20,
just turned 21 and,

2157
01:52:17,370 --> 01:52:19,420
and I was hitchhiking through eastern 
europe.

2158
01:52:19,421 --> 01:52:20,254
And then I went through the soviet union
and I was on a train from leningrad to 

2159
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:27,160
moscow and a sitting next to a 
professor.

2160
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:29,950
I always seem to be followed by people 
who spoke english.

2161
01:52:29,951 --> 01:52:31,810
But this guy spoke english and he said 
to me,

2162
01:52:31,811 --> 01:52:32,950
um,
you know,

2163
01:52:32,951 --> 01:52:36,910
we have a better system of free speech 
and soviet union than you do in America.

2164
01:52:36,970 --> 01:52:38,260
How dare he,
eh?

2165
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,330
So I said,
whaT the hell could that possibly mean?

2166
01:52:41,110 --> 01:52:41,681
And he said,
well,

2167
01:52:41,681 --> 01:52:44,620
when you wake up in the mornings,
he said,

2168
01:52:44,621 --> 01:52:45,141
uh,
he said,

2169
01:52:45,141 --> 01:52:46,250
when you wake up in the morning,

2170
01:52:47,030 --> 01:52:47,863
you read the New York times or the 
Washington post or the wall street 

2171
01:52:50,541 --> 01:52:51,380
journal and you think,
you know,

2172
01:52:51,381 --> 01:52:55,820
the truth,
but we know when we read our newspapers,

2173
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:56,683
everybody's lying to us.
So we have to read seven or eight 

2174
01:52:59,091 --> 01:52:59,924
newspapers and triangulate on the truth.
And that makes us a more critical free 

2175
01:53:05,181 --> 01:53:08,570
speech society that America is.
And you know,

2176
01:53:08,571 --> 01:53:10,300
it's kind of funny at the time because 
like,

2177
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:13,550
you realize they didn't have any.
But there's a kernel of truth to that.

2178
01:53:13,790 --> 01:53:14,623
You know,
when my dad gets an email that says 

2179
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:19,213
barack obama's a muslim,
he comes from the time when you just 

2180
01:53:22,821 --> 01:53:25,070
believe what's printed even though it's 
not printed,

2181
01:53:25,071 --> 01:53:27,410
it's just an email.
And so he just kind of like,

2182
01:53:27,411 --> 01:53:29,480
oh my god,
the president of muslim.

2183
01:53:29,850 --> 01:53:30,980
Um,
but you know,

2184
01:53:30,981 --> 01:53:34,160
my kid gets an email that says barack 
obama is a muslim.

2185
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:34,940
He's like,
yeah,

2186
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:35,773
well,
I mean,

2187
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:37,880
what else mean?
Like he's going to be like,

2188
01:53:37,881 --> 01:53:40,010
yo,
you want to see different views.

2189
01:53:40,011 --> 01:53:43,160
And so I think that in some sense we are
producing a culture,

2190
01:53:43,161 --> 01:53:45,160
especially among our kids,
uh,

2191
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:49,010
or at least one hopes where they 
recognize that everything is partial.

2192
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:51,860
Yes.
And you gotta you gotta do a lot of work

2193
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:55,250
to Poland to knit it together.
And in the end that might be a better.

2194
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:56,613
I might be a better ecology for 
producing democracy and truth than one 

2195
01:54:00,591 --> 01:54:01,161
where,
you know,

2196
01:54:01,161 --> 01:54:05,510
you've got to trust the source to be 
objective in this case.

2197
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:08,390
That's an interesting perspective.
Um,

2198
01:54:08,391 --> 01:54:12,830
I do definitely agree that young people 
are more skeptical and more aware of the

2199
01:54:12,831 --> 01:54:15,980
possibilities of fuckery today than ever
before.

2200
01:54:17,030 --> 01:54:19,250
Here's a funny story.
Michael sherman,

2201
01:54:19,310 --> 01:54:20,660
you know,
michael shermer,

2202
01:54:20,661 --> 01:54:22,430
who is a professional skeptic.
Yeah.

2203
01:54:22,730 --> 01:54:25,680
I get a dm from him,
says,

2204
01:54:25,690 --> 01:54:29,450
uh,
there's a story about you on bc.

2205
01:54:29,490 --> 01:54:31,370
Uh,
uh,

2206
01:54:31,371 --> 01:54:34,790
what,
what is the british bbc is a story about

2207
01:54:34,791 --> 01:54:35,624
you on bbc.
You have to log into your twitter to 

2208
01:54:38,721 --> 01:54:40,610
read it.
So I look at that.

2209
01:54:40,611 --> 01:54:42,440
I go,
what kind of bullshit?

2210
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,730
This,
What'd you get hacked?

2211
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,900
so I sent him a message,
say,

2212
01:54:45,901 --> 01:54:47,030
hey dude,
you get hacked.

2213
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:50,480
They send him the message and he said,
what?

2214
01:54:50,481 --> 01:54:52,620
There's a story about me and he logged 
in.

2215
01:54:52,621 --> 01:54:54,860
Shit,
he's a fucking professional skeptic.

2216
01:54:54,861 --> 01:54:56,120
Wow.
They got him.

2217
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:57,920
But why?
Because he's older now.

2218
01:54:58,150 --> 01:54:58,850
You know?
I mean,

2219
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:02,270
I think guys that didn't grow up with 
that,

2220
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,760
they don't or they don't know 
tricksters.

2221
01:55:05,150 --> 01:55:06,290
They don't know the,
the,

2222
01:55:06,340 --> 01:55:08,240
the ways of it.
And it was a nightmare for him.

2223
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:09,193
He'll like,
I mean his whole system was screwed up 

2224
01:55:11,570 --> 01:55:13,810
and he had a j.
Every time it would make,

2225
01:55:14,050 --> 01:55:15,500
make a tweet,
it would get deleted.

2226
01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:18,890
Like it was really bad and I will email 
them and go,

2227
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:19,920
dude,
you got hacked.

2228
01:55:19,960 --> 01:55:20,940
yeah.
No,

2229
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:23,390
it's a problem with us old people.
This is the way we live.

2230
01:55:23,480 --> 01:55:24,313
Well,
it's just you grow up with one system 

2231
01:55:26,241 --> 01:55:28,400
and then all of a sudden you know,
I don't know what to do here.

2232
01:55:28,580 --> 01:55:30,060
Oh,
it says it needs my login.

2233
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:33,650
Let me just give me a hug and that all 
these pop up boxes.

2234
01:55:33,651 --> 01:55:34,484
And oh no.
The number of people who are being 

2235
01:55:37,371 --> 01:55:38,204
tricked into believing the irs is 
calling them on the telephone and 

2236
01:55:41,211 --> 01:55:42,500
demanding.
Hilarious.

2237
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:43,980
Hilarious.
And tragic,

2238
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:45,240
I mean this is amazing,
man.

2239
01:55:45,241 --> 01:55:47,430
Told me they're going to put my whole 
family in jail.

2240
01:55:48,330 --> 01:55:51,090
My whole family.
They left a message.

2241
01:55:51,091 --> 01:55:54,480
Since you did not return our call,
we will put your whole family in jail.

2242
01:55:54,481 --> 01:55:56,370
My dad,
my whole family,

2243
01:55:56,940 --> 01:56:00,710
the dog to everybody.
What about the cats?

2244
01:56:02,230 --> 01:56:03,660
It's like,
what the fuck man.

2245
01:56:03,661 --> 01:56:04,494
Like they're trying to freak people out.
And it's an automated voice message 

2246
01:56:11,630 --> 01:56:12,463
folks.
Yeah.

2247
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:14,850
Yeah.
Old folks get roped into that stuff real

2248
01:56:14,851 --> 01:56:15,870
hard.
It's very sad.

2249
01:56:15,930 --> 01:56:16,763
It's very sad because a lot of them are 
lonely and they don't have a lot of 

2250
01:56:20,671 --> 01:56:21,504
companionship.
And they get these messages and they 

2251
01:56:22,861 --> 01:56:24,580
don't know who to turn to to explain it 
to

2252
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:25,220
god.
Yeah,

2253
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:26,330
yeah.
Yeah.

2254
01:56:26,350 --> 01:56:29,390
And you know,
so is there a reason to be hopeful here?

2255
01:56:29,391 --> 01:56:31,610
Well,
younger kids.

2256
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:32,873
And uh,
the other thing that makes me really 

2257
01:56:34,611 --> 01:56:37,490
hopeful is places like reddit,
you know,

2258
01:56:37,491 --> 01:56:39,290
so which forms are you going?

2259
01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:44,980
I know there's some really bad stuff.
Some of them are

2260
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:46,570
great though,
but many of them are great.

2261
01:56:46,571 --> 01:56:47,404
But the point is what the greatness can 
inheres in there demonstrating 

2262
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:54,160
incredible talents out there in the 
world that,

2263
01:56:54,161 --> 01:56:56,470
you know,
in the 19 seventies just would have been

2264
01:56:56,471 --> 01:56:57,304
invisible.
Like you kind of looked at the world in 

2265
01:56:58,331 --> 01:56:59,164
the 19 seventies,
which I remember the 19 seventies you 

2266
01:57:00,731 --> 01:57:02,380
kind of thought they were great people 
at the top,

2267
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:04,930
you know,
they were all in television and,

2268
01:57:05,170 --> 01:57:09,430
and everybody else was kind of a troll.
But what red hat does every day,

2269
01:57:09,450 --> 01:57:09,800
you know,
I,

2270
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:12,580
I'm obsessed with certain of these feats
adjuster.

2271
01:57:12,581 --> 01:57:13,480
Amazing.
But,

2272
01:57:13,481 --> 01:57:15,000
um,
it's like you read them like,

2273
01:57:15,010 --> 01:57:18,430
here's just some joe schmo out there 
that's taken a bunch of data and data is

2274
01:57:18,431 --> 01:57:19,181
beautiful.
I'm like,

2275
01:57:19,181 --> 01:57:22,090
demonstrated something amazing by the 
way he's built it.

2276
01:57:22,570 --> 01:57:27,310
And yoU get the sense that the world is 
filled with these incredibly talented,

2277
01:57:27,311 --> 01:57:29,930
smart people everywhere who are,
you know,

2278
01:57:29,950 --> 01:57:30,783
many of them just have too much time.
But the point is they're out there 

2279
01:57:33,221 --> 01:57:36,250
everywhere.
So if you ask why should we be hopeful?

2280
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:39,190
It's that we develop these critical 
attitudes.

2281
01:57:39,191 --> 01:57:40,024
We have this ability to think across.
And the army is filled with so many 

2282
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:47,530
incredibly talented people and the 
internet surfaces it.

2283
01:57:47,531 --> 01:57:50,980
It makes it possible for us to at least 
reach them.

2284
01:57:51,040 --> 01:57:54,160
Yes.
And then the question is can we use this

2285
01:57:54,161 --> 01:57:54,994
power leverage is power and actually do 
something with the forces of evil that 

2286
01:57:58,660 --> 01:57:59,380
now control.

2287
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:03,430
I had an interesting moment last night 
at the ice house comedy club where there

2288
01:58:03,431 --> 01:58:04,264
was a drunk couple in the front row that
we're talking really loud and they were 

2289
01:58:06,701 --> 01:58:07,534
annoying all the people around them and 
they were kind of chime in and heckling 

2290
01:58:10,181 --> 01:58:11,014
and raising their hands and eventually 
they got kicked out and it was pretty 

2291
01:58:15,071 --> 01:58:16,900
fun.
Everybody was having a good time.

2292
01:58:16,901 --> 01:58:18,040
It was pretty,
pretty crazy.

2293
01:58:18,041 --> 01:58:18,874
Even as they were getting kicked out,
the rest of the audience was having a 

2294
01:58:20,621 --> 01:58:22,930
good time because we're making fun of 
it.

2295
01:58:23,170 --> 01:58:25,570
And I said,
as these people were getting kicked out,

2296
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:29,020
I said,
this is basically us.

2297
01:58:29,470 --> 01:58:30,303
Most of us are cool.
There's a hundred and 50 people in here 

2298
01:58:33,911 --> 01:58:34,744
and out of 150 people,
hundred 48 of them are having a great 

2299
01:58:38,531 --> 01:58:40,720
time.
Everyone's drinking.

2300
01:58:40,721 --> 01:58:45,721
and and where all these comedians and no
one wants any extraordinary attention,

2301
01:58:46,301 --> 01:58:49,630
no one wants any special attention,
but to people fucked it up.

2302
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:52,690
Now if you were next to those people,
you would say,

2303
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:54,640
oh,
the crowd there sucks.

2304
01:58:54,940 --> 01:58:55,773
The people are always yelling things out
and they're drunks and they hackle will 

2305
01:58:59,111 --> 01:58:59,944
because that those two people required 
an exorbitant amount of attention that 

2306
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:05,050
they asked for more attention than 
anyone else.

2307
01:59:05,350 --> 01:59:08,650
And if you use that bias sample group 
and say,

2308
01:59:08,651 --> 01:59:09,484
well this is the crowd.
The crowd is these drunk people that 

2309
01:59:12,311 --> 01:59:13,144
yelled at,
you know,

2310
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:14,073
the fast majority of the crowd are 
really polite fund people out having a 

2311
01:59:17,861 --> 01:59:18,694
good time.
And they approached it with the perfect 

2312
01:59:20,561 --> 01:59:22,870
attitude.
I think this is the world.

2313
01:59:22,871 --> 01:59:24,550
This is the world.
I think the world is.

2314
01:59:24,551 --> 01:59:28,390
There's a small percentage of people 
that fuck things up for everybody.

2315
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:32,290
And I think that this,
this is in terms of politics,

2316
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:34,480
in terms of business,
in terms of everything,

2317
01:59:34,510 --> 01:59:35,710
is that.
Yes,

2318
01:59:35,711 --> 01:59:37,090
in terms of the net for sure.

2319
01:59:37,210 --> 01:59:40,360
And I think the net is the perfect 
example of that.

2320
01:59:40,480 --> 01:59:41,313
If you're a person that gets.
If something happens to you and people 

2321
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:50,080
started attacking you online for it,
if you just noticed the number of people

2322
01:59:50,081 --> 01:59:52,210
thAt say you're involved in some sort of
a story,

2323
01:59:52,550 --> 01:59:53,383
right?
Say maybe there's a million people that 

2324
01:59:55,691 --> 02:00:00,310
know about this story and you get a 150 
people send you mean things.

2325
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:02,890
You think at the end of the world,
150 people a unit.

2326
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:07,060
You don't notice that it's a hunt.
You just see All these messages and it's

2327
02:00:07,061 --> 02:00:08,050
an.
It's unmanageable.

2328
02:00:08,051 --> 02:00:09,130
You like,
oh my god,

2329
02:00:09,131 --> 02:00:10,600
everyone hates me.
No,

2330
02:00:10,750 --> 02:00:11,583
a hundred and 50 people have decided to 
take action and make you feel bad 

2331
02:00:15,101 --> 02:00:15,934
because they feel bad.
It's a small number in terms of the 

2332
02:00:18,251 --> 02:00:21,190
overall number of human beings,
but if you are louis,

2333
02:00:21,191 --> 02:00:23,620
c,
k and it's coming at you,

2334
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:24,760
you're like,
holy shit.

2335
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:26,860
The world fucking hates me.
you know,

2336
02:00:26,861 --> 02:00:28,060
and it's,
it's.

2337
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:29,133
This is.
This is the situation that we're in 

2338
02:00:31,271 --> 02:00:34,870
right now.
We just have so many voices.

2339
02:00:35,170 --> 02:00:38,410
It's incredible though because out of 
all those voices,

2340
02:00:38,411 --> 02:00:39,244
as long as you're not personally trying 
to figure it out and filter it yourself 

2341
02:00:43,330 --> 02:00:46,360
with your own,
which is completely impossible,

2342
02:00:46,690 --> 02:00:49,090
but if you could just look at it 
objectives from afar,

2343
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:50,913
this is going to work itself out in a 
far better way than has ever happened 

2344
02:00:52,901 --> 02:00:53,734
before in our past.
There's never been this many voices and 

2345
02:00:56,351 --> 02:00:57,184
our pastor has been like you were 
talking about a select few voices that 

2346
02:00:59,701 --> 02:01:00,534
walter cronkite's,
the whoever it is at the top and then 

2347
02:01:03,610 --> 02:01:04,443
everyone else sort of had to wait for 
the narrative to be spelled out for 

2348
02:01:07,721 --> 02:01:08,350
them.
RighT.

2349
02:01:08,350 --> 02:01:09,880
That's not the case anymore.
That's right.

2350
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:11,110
And,
and again,

2351
02:01:11,111 --> 02:01:12,920
I think it's the best of times and the 
worst of times.

2352
02:01:12,940 --> 02:01:13,773
So it's the best of times because all 
these new voices are bringing all sorts 

2353
02:01:17,411 --> 02:01:18,244
of great perspective and insight and 
intelligence to the story that wasn't 

2354
02:01:22,151 --> 02:01:23,710
there before.
And that's great.

2355
02:01:24,430 --> 02:01:25,263
The problem is is if the infrastructure 
that used to be there to kind of bring 

2356
02:01:29,561 --> 02:01:30,394
us up,
bring us all up to kind of basic level 

2357
02:01:32,471 --> 02:01:33,304
so that we understood the facts 
disappears so they don't have anything 

2358
02:01:37,001 --> 02:01:39,770
that kind of makes it so that we all 
understand what's at issue and what's at

2359
02:01:39,771 --> 02:01:40,070
stake

2360
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:44,510
and what the facts are so that we can 
act as a democracy in a sensible way.

2361
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:47,990
Then the question is how do we run a 
democracy?

2362
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:48,913
You know,
because if we could have all these 

2363
02:01:49,521 --> 02:01:50,780
different,
you know,

2364
02:01:50,781 --> 02:01:51,614
I like to think about the difference 
between the culture channel and the 

2365
02:01:53,511 --> 02:01:55,340
democracy channels and the culture 
channel.

2366
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:56,473
This is the best of times by orders of 
magnitude and the stuff on television 

2367
02:01:59,751 --> 02:02:00,584
today is a billion times better than 
anything from the 19 seventies in 19 

2368
02:02:04,170 --> 02:02:05,003
eighties and it's.
That's a product of this incredible 

2369
02:02:07,821 --> 02:02:08,654
competition and the fact that you can 
have anything and any niche market and 

2370
02:02:12,501 --> 02:02:13,334
as long as it's enough,
it makes sense to do it and that's 

2371
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:16,513
what's great.
But when you turn to the democracy 

2372
02:02:18,231 --> 02:02:20,870
channel,
the same fragmentation,

2373
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:21,733
the same niche market.
The same reality of us all living in 

2374
02:02:24,321 --> 02:02:25,154
these different universes means we can't
address problems as a democracy with 

2375
02:02:29,841 --> 02:02:30,950
even the same facts.

2376
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:35,810
And that's a real problem because if we 
all live in our own fact universe,

2377
02:02:36,130 --> 02:02:36,963
uh,
but we have to save face the same real 

2378
02:02:38,361 --> 02:02:39,194
problems in the same real earth,
then we're not going to decide them in 

2379
02:02:42,111 --> 02:02:45,260
any sensible way.
And How you solve that problem is really

2380
02:02:45,261 --> 02:02:46,910
hard.
Like we're not going back.

2381
02:02:46,911 --> 02:02:49,310
Thank god we're not going back to the 19
sixties.

2382
02:02:49,311 --> 02:02:50,144
It's just not going to be the case that 
there are three channels we get to 

2383
02:02:52,521 --> 02:02:53,930
watch.
That's just not going to happen.

2384
02:02:54,510 --> 02:02:57,380
And it's a great thing because we've got
all this amazing culture,

2385
02:02:57,381 --> 02:03:01,190
but what do we do on the democracy side?
How do we build a democracy?

2386
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:02,533
Recognizing that everybody's not going 
to spend all their time geeking out 

2387
02:03:04,791 --> 02:03:07,160
about campaign finance,
reform legislation.

2388
02:03:07,470 --> 02:03:08,303
And,
and that's why I think we need to think 

2389
02:03:09,531 --> 02:03:13,040
about these other ways to bring people 
to some sense of understanding.

2390
02:03:13,460 --> 02:03:14,293
And you know,
brian calendar and a hunter mats were 

2391
02:03:17,181 --> 02:03:18,890
the first people that brought me into 
this.

2392
02:03:18,891 --> 02:03:19,724
Like they put me on their podcast and I 
remember like not even knowing when he 

2393
02:03:23,451 --> 02:03:26,570
did this,
like the length of that conversation and

2394
02:03:26,571 --> 02:03:28,580
thinking,
what are you going to cut this down to?

2395
02:03:28,581 --> 02:03:30,250
Like six minutes,
10 minutes.

2396
02:03:30,290 --> 02:03:32,360
HoW long did you guys talk?
I think we talked for an hour,

2397
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:33,253
you know,
and then we're already done two hours 

2398
02:03:34,551 --> 02:03:35,930
and 15 minutes.
Holy shit.

2399
02:03:36,240 --> 02:03:37,820
Yeah.
Was a time warp in this row.

2400
02:03:37,850 --> 02:03:39,740
Wow.
I can see that.

2401
02:03:39,741 --> 02:03:40,730
Yeah.
I mean,

2402
02:03:40,731 --> 02:03:42,740
but I remember thinking like in the 
middle,

2403
02:03:42,741 --> 02:03:45,740
like I stopped and I thought whoa,
this is the,

2404
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:47,930
this is the changing of the world,
this is it.

2405
02:03:47,931 --> 02:03:51,470
And as opposed to those panel shows,
those two talking heads for each other.

2406
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:52,313
Like when you're on these cable 
television shows and you've got 30 

2407
02:03:54,021 --> 02:03:56,110
seconds to say something and,
and you know,

2408
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:58,910
you linked it before and I think this is
really the key.

2409
02:03:59,310 --> 02:04:00,143
It's,
it's,

2410
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:00,993
it's exactly like diet.
Like we recognize that we have been pUt 

2411
02:04:05,541 --> 02:04:06,374
into a world right now where we all eat 
shitty food because it's been designed 

2412
02:04:10,041 --> 02:04:11,720
to make it so tasty.
Like we love it,

2413
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:14,150
you know?
and the only way we reformed that,

2414
02:04:14,240 --> 02:04:16,460
if individuals,
one by one,

2415
02:04:16,490 --> 02:04:19,210
began to decide to eat the right stuff,
right?

2416
02:04:19,220 --> 02:04:20,053
You've got to Decide to,
to engage in the right kind of healthy 

2417
02:04:23,391 --> 02:04:24,224
behavior to,
to be able to survive in this world 

2418
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:26,953
because the incentives of the market are
to sell you stuff that doesn't 

2419
02:04:30,291 --> 02:04:33,170
necessarily do that.
It's the same thing with the information

2420
02:04:33,171 --> 02:04:34,004
space.
That's why the slow food movement is 

2421
02:04:36,441 --> 02:04:37,274
like the slow democracy movement.
Like the slow food movement is how do 

2422
02:04:40,081 --> 02:04:43,800
you produce food that's actually healthy
in a way that feeds you.

2423
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:47,430
It feeds your body in the right way.
I think the slo democracy movement,

2424
02:04:47,431 --> 02:04:48,264
how do you feed a democracy and the 
elements to that have got to be context 

2425
02:04:52,111 --> 02:04:57,111
where people are free to get deeper than
30 seconds and if we don't build more of

2426
02:04:57,931 --> 02:04:58,950
those we're gonna have.

2427
02:04:59,290 --> 02:05:01,860
We're going to have a really desperate 
time for democracy.

2428
02:05:01,861 --> 02:05:02,694
We're going to have what we have,
which is the rise of authoritarians 

2429
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:05,183
around the world.
Do you foresee the possibility of 

2430
02:05:08,251 --> 02:05:09,084
alternative social media outlets sort of
viewing all the issues that people do 

2431
02:05:15,181 --> 02:05:19,620
have with google or facebook or twitter 
or any of these,

2432
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:20,483
what are perceived to be biased sources 
of information and coming up with 

2433
02:05:24,211 --> 02:05:27,810
something that has clear protections in 
there?

2434
02:05:27,880 --> 02:05:28,713
Sort of like the founding fathers did 
when they established our system of 

2435
02:05:32,161 --> 02:05:33,720
government that,
listen,

2436
02:05:33,930 --> 02:05:35,430
we don't want that.
Let's,

2437
02:05:35,460 --> 02:05:40,460
let's organize that as we're starting to
make sure that this doesn't doesn't ever

2438
02:05:40,591 --> 02:05:43,220
turn into some sort of an echo chamber.
Look,

2439
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:46,250
I am way above my pay grade.
Yeah,

2440
02:05:46,620 --> 02:05:49,170
but what I know gets us there is 
competition.

2441
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:50,993
I know that the only thing that has ever
gotten us to the next great innovation 

2442
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:58,470
is the enforcement of competition,
which is why it's a problem when someone

2443
02:05:58,471 --> 02:06:00,370
like facebook absolutely buys in store.

2444
02:06:00,410 --> 02:06:01,243
What gave us the internet was 
interventions by the government against 

2445
02:06:04,771 --> 02:06:05,604
a t and t,
which was the dominant 

2446
02:06:08,010 --> 02:06:12,000
telecommunications company for more than
a century that finally said,

2447
02:06:12,001 --> 02:06:14,730
enough of this,
you can't leverage your power to control

2448
02:06:14,731 --> 02:06:18,270
all innovation,
and once that intervention happened,

2449
02:06:18,630 --> 02:06:20,730
people could layer on top of their 
wires,

2450
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:24,660
a new network called the internet,
and when they did that,

2451
02:06:24,930 --> 02:06:28,590
government said to companies like cable 
television companies,

2452
02:06:28,710 --> 02:06:29,281
okay,
yeah,

2453
02:06:29,281 --> 02:06:31,950
you've got broadband across your cable 
line,

2454
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:36,870
but that doesn't mean you get to decide 
what applications go on that cable line.

2455
02:06:37,290 --> 02:06:38,690
So you,
you're hbs.

2456
02:06:38,740 --> 02:06:39,573
You mean near The cable company?
You can't say that there can't be 

2457
02:06:43,230 --> 02:06:46,110
netflix on the cable or you can't slow 
netflix down.

2458
02:06:46,111 --> 02:06:46,944
Now obviously they would want a slow 
night fix down because netflix is a 

2459
02:06:50,371 --> 02:06:53,130
competitor with their basic business 
model,

2460
02:06:53,430 --> 02:06:54,263
but the intervention to assure 
competition created the opportunity for 

2461
02:06:58,441 --> 02:07:00,090
these great new innovations.

2462
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:00,953
Now nobody at the beginning of that had 
any clue about what would come out of 

2463
02:07:04,351 --> 02:07:07,590
it.
All that they knew was that the only way

2464
02:07:07,591 --> 02:07:10,560
to get something new and create was to 
assure competition.

2465
02:07:10,860 --> 02:07:14,040
And that's the commitment we've given up
since 2000,

2466
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:17,730
since George Bush became president in 
2001,

2467
02:07:18,270 --> 02:07:19,103
there's been no major enforcement action
by the antitrust department against any 

2468
02:07:22,471 --> 02:07:25,800
of these companies.
And that is a huge problem.

2469
02:07:26,070 --> 02:07:29,100
And until we rediscover the importance 
of competition,

2470
02:07:29,670 --> 02:07:32,760
not because we're geniuses and we can 
figure out what the future will bring,

2471
02:07:32,761 --> 02:07:33,594
but because we know from the past that 
the only way the future comes is if you 

2472
02:07:36,791 --> 02:07:39,100
guarantee competition,
unless we do that,

2473
02:07:39,101 --> 02:07:40,810
we're never going to solve any of these 
problems.

2474
02:07:41,410 --> 02:07:42,243
Yeah.
Ensuring competition is ensuring 

2475
02:07:43,721 --> 02:07:44,554
innovations,
ensuring and anybody who doesn't want 

2476
02:07:46,631 --> 02:07:47,464
competition wants to stifle innovation.
And it's got to be thought to be a 

2477
02:07:49,871 --> 02:07:52,270
selfish proposition.
And the basic.

2478
02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:54,750
So you know,
the basic argument and competition law,

2479
02:07:54,920 --> 02:07:55,753
you know,
there's competition law got taken over 

2480
02:07:56,681 --> 02:08:00,850
by a bunch of chicago economists who 
said the only question was efficiency or

2481
02:08:00,851 --> 02:08:01,684
consumer welfare,
but there's another perspective that 

2482
02:08:04,631 --> 02:08:07,030
libertarians like.
Luigi zingAles,

2483
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:07,893
who's an economist,
that university of chicago business 

2484
02:08:09,371 --> 02:08:10,930
school.
And um,

2485
02:08:11,110 --> 02:08:11,943
and people who are not libertarians like
tim wu who's a professor at columbia 

2486
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:16,173
embrace,
and this is the idea of political 

2487
02:08:17,291 --> 02:08:18,124
antitrust and the idea of political 
antitrust is you should also worry if 

2488
02:08:22,151 --> 02:08:25,480
companies are so big that they can 
corrupt the government,

2489
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:27,820
like this is a dimension to worry about 
too,

2490
02:08:28,330 --> 02:08:30,910
because if they get to be so big that 
they can corrupt the government,

2491
02:08:30,940 --> 02:08:31,773
then you know that they will use that 
power to protect themselves against 

2492
02:08:35,260 --> 02:08:37,660
innovation.
Because if an innovator comes,

2493
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:41,290
he doesn't come with 50 lobbyists.
He does comes with a great idea.

2494
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:42,520
I mean,
you know,

2495
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:43,353
elon musk saw this dramatically as he's 
developing this incredible alternative 

2496
02:08:47,350 --> 02:08:50,140
and tried to figure out how to sell it 
inside of states.

2497
02:08:50,141 --> 02:08:50,974
And then the lobbyists for the car 
companies would go state by state and 

2498
02:08:53,591 --> 02:08:58,420
forbid them from being able to sell cars
without a local dealership in the state.

2499
02:08:58,450 --> 02:08:59,283
Right?
There was a huge fight as the incumbent 

2500
02:09:01,061 --> 02:09:01,894
industries leveraged their power over 
government to protect themselves from 

2501
02:09:05,561 --> 02:09:07,990
this new competitor.
And this is the,

2502
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:11,560
this is the fight we have to.
We have to make central again because if

2503
02:09:11,561 --> 02:09:12,394
we don't do that,
then the dinosaurs will have the power 

2504
02:09:15,131 --> 02:09:18,730
through this corrupted political system 
to protect themselves against the future

2505
02:09:19,210 --> 02:09:20,043
and this is just the moment when we need
to figure out how to make the future 

2506
02:09:22,301 --> 02:09:23,134
come.
I'm glad you're raising these warning 

2507
02:09:24,551 --> 02:09:27,040
flags,
but I feel like from talking to you that

2508
02:09:27,041 --> 02:09:28,330
you're fairly optimistic.

2509
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:32,500
You're the first person who's ever said 
that.

2510
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:33,433
Really feel like you're optimistic.
You're perception of the internet and 

2511
02:09:37,390 --> 02:09:40,220
the young people coming up and the.
Okay.

2512
02:09:40,330 --> 02:09:43,480
That's fair.
The way information is being distributed

2513
02:09:43,481 --> 02:09:44,314
today,
that there's so many people 

2514
02:09:45,581 --> 02:09:48,970
participating in it and there's so much 
competition even in that form.

2515
02:09:49,540 --> 02:09:50,530
Right?
I mean there's.

2516
02:09:50,770 --> 02:09:51,603
Yeah,
there's more voices now and there's a 

2517
02:09:53,621 --> 02:09:54,454
lot of.
Look in the past when you had to be 

2518
02:09:56,291 --> 02:09:57,124
selected in order to speak,
it was very difficult to get through 

2519
02:10:00,701 --> 02:10:01,534
that selection process and it's not 
necessarily the best voices that got 

2520
02:10:04,361 --> 02:10:05,194
through it.
Just sometimes the most persistent and 

2521
02:10:07,121 --> 02:10:07,954
the most influential,
whatever the reason why they got it to 

2522
02:10:09,761 --> 02:10:14,590
be one of those people with the tie in 
that block on those panel shows,

2523
02:10:14,860 --> 02:10:16,540
that's not the case anymore.
Right.

2524
02:10:16,580 --> 02:10:18,880
You know,
now you've got kyle kalinsky,

2525
02:10:18,881 --> 02:10:20,560
you've got all these,
you know these,

2526
02:10:20,590 --> 02:10:21,700
these people that are.

2527
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:24,680
They don't necessarily fit in,
you know,

2528
02:10:25,150 --> 02:10:25,983
any traditional jimmy dore,
they don't fit in any traditional role 

2529
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:32,223
on regular mainstream television,
but they have a pretty influential 

2530
02:10:34,731 --> 02:10:35,680
voice.
Absolutely.

2531
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:36,673
And they're very polItically savvy and 
they're talking about things in a way 

2532
02:10:40,161 --> 02:10:41,780
that they would be.
they would be.

2533
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:43,353
it would be very hard to get a producer 
to sign off on the way a lot of these 

2534
02:10:46,131 --> 02:10:49,280
guys communicate and some of the things 
that they do be.

2535
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:50,900
It would be very,
very difficult,

2536
02:10:50,901 --> 02:10:51,890
but.
So you're optimistic.

2537
02:10:52,190 --> 02:10:54,680
I'm very optimistic.
I'm optimistic in that space.

2538
02:10:54,681 --> 02:10:57,080
I guess everything outside of the 
beltway of Washington,

2539
02:10:57,081 --> 02:10:57,914
I'm optimistic about.
I think America has an incredible 

2540
02:11:00,651 --> 02:11:02,690
capacity to innovate out of its 
problems.

2541
02:11:03,290 --> 02:11:04,123
What I fear and what I'm not sure any 
rational person should be optimistic 

2542
02:11:07,071 --> 02:11:07,904
about,
but that doesn't mean you don't fight 

2543
02:11:09,201 --> 02:11:11,840
it.
What I fear is Washington and um,

2544
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:13,093
and so I've said many times like the 
power of corruption in Washington might 

2545
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:19,513
be so great that it cannot be defeated,
but that doesn't affect what we should 

2546
02:11:24,411 --> 02:11:25,010
be doing.

2547
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:27,890
We should be fighting it.
Whether or not we think we can win.

2548
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:29,840
Winning is not the only reason you 
fight.

2549
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:30,703
You fight because it's the right thing 
to do and we need to rally because we 

2550
02:11:33,921 --> 02:11:34,754
might be wrong.
It could just be that if we got the 

2551
02:11:38,061 --> 02:11:40,420
political forest,
we could take them down and,

2552
02:11:40,550 --> 02:11:42,980
and I think that's what we got to be 
setting up for it right now.

2553
02:11:43,040 --> 02:11:43,873
When you see people like tulsi gabbard 
or will you see this young woman in New 

2554
02:11:48,050 --> 02:11:48,890
York,
alexandria,

2555
02:11:48,950 --> 02:11:51,200
a casio,
casio cortez,

2556
02:11:51,650 --> 02:11:52,483
that to me that's very promising,
that people are leanIng in this 

2557
02:11:55,491 --> 02:11:57,230
direction and that they're,
they're saying,

2558
02:11:57,231 --> 02:11:58,670
let's just,
let's,

2559
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:02,120
let's look at this in a different way 
and let's see some new voices.

2560
02:12:02,121 --> 02:12:02,954
Let's,
let's hear people that are clearly not 

2561
02:12:05,181 --> 02:12:08,390
influenced by corporate America.
They're clearly not.

2562
02:12:08,620 --> 02:12:12,620
They don't have all of their veins 
hooked up to the matrix yet.

2563
02:12:13,120 --> 02:12:17,030
Now I tulsa I had known before your 
interview with her,

2564
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:20,660
your interview with her I think gave 
people a incredible understanding of the

2565
02:12:20,661 --> 02:12:21,950
depth of her soul,
which is deep.

2566
02:12:22,070 --> 02:12:23,750
How about when she tweeted to the 
president,

2567
02:12:23,751 --> 02:12:27,860
making us Saudi Arabia is bitch is not 
putting us America first so she can go.

2568
02:12:28,160 --> 02:12:31,140
She can both do the deep and also the 
shallow.

2569
02:12:31,141 --> 02:12:32,630
She can do both.
That's amazing.

2570
02:12:32,670 --> 02:12:33,503
That is an unprecedented thing too 
because what trump has done is he's 

2571
02:12:38,270 --> 02:12:41,570
opened up the door for this kind of very
hostile communication,

2572
02:12:41,571 --> 02:12:45,560
but what he's also done is opened up the
door for it to come back at him.

2573
02:12:46,490 --> 02:12:47,750
Not that he notices,
but the.

2574
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:48,850
You're right,
exactly right.

2575
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:49,753
The rest of the world notice,
but what I think is interesting about 

2576
02:12:51,621 --> 02:12:56,420
alexandria is she is very disciplined 
about saying,

2577
02:12:56,570 --> 02:12:57,403
look,
we've got to fix the system if we're 

2578
02:12:58,521 --> 02:12:59,930
going to get any of these things done.

2579
02:12:59,930 --> 02:13:02,120
So I like to think about like alexandria
or versus bernie,

2580
02:13:02,180 --> 02:13:05,360
you know,
so she like every time she gets up there

2581
02:13:05,361 --> 02:13:08,750
and talks about her green energy,
new deal,

2582
02:13:09,150 --> 02:13:09,983
it's like you got to fix the political 
system and then we're going to be able 

2583
02:13:12,051 --> 02:13:12,884
to get this stuff as opposed to like 
putting a list of 10 things you want to 

2584
02:13:16,221 --> 02:13:17,054
do without anywhere even mentioning the 
fact that you're going to make these 

2585
02:13:20,271 --> 02:13:22,520
things possible by pixeling fixing 
political system.

2586
02:13:22,521 --> 02:13:23,354
I think we need new people,
which this new congress is filled with 

2587
02:13:26,121 --> 02:13:27,980
them.
There were a hundred and seven members,

2588
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:29,113
a lot of people running for congress who
wrote to speaker of the house and said 

2589
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:35,490
they want.
As the first thing is addressing of this

2590
02:13:35,491 --> 02:13:37,770
corrupt political system.
And nancy pelosi gave them,

2591
02:13:37,771 --> 02:13:40,170
not just that,
but all these other reforms to it.

2592
02:13:40,171 --> 02:13:41,004
That's hr one.

2593
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:45,270
The younger people coming into congress,
realIzed the system is broken.

2594
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:46,523
I fear the older people in congress have
gotten so used to the system that they 

2595
02:13:49,171 --> 02:13:51,450
don't even notice anymore.
Just how broken it is,

2596
02:13:51,451 --> 02:13:54,150
how outrageous it is,
and they need to rage.

2597
02:13:54,151 --> 02:13:56,400
So they're going to rage against the 
billionaires or whatever,

2598
02:13:56,640 --> 02:13:57,473
but I think we need to focus the rage on
the problem and that problem is 

2599
02:14:00,811 --> 02:14:03,240
congress.
If we don't fix congress first,

2600
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:04,113
nothing else matters.
Nothing else will happen and we need to 

2601
02:14:06,721 --> 02:14:07,554
build the movement,
which I think could actually be a 

2602
02:14:10,170 --> 02:14:11,003
movement that brings people on the right
and people on the left in to make that 

2603
02:14:14,431 --> 02:14:15,264
change possible.
The philosophy that you have to have 

2604
02:14:17,611 --> 02:14:18,444
darKness in order to inspire light and 
that there's some sort of a balance to 

2605
02:14:20,881 --> 02:14:21,714
be achieved in this managing of those 
two energies And that when you have an 

2606
02:14:27,061 --> 02:14:32,061
administration that's clearly fucked up 
and then people come along and say,

2607
02:14:33,120 --> 02:14:33,953
it's time that I get into politics and 
make a difference and these are the 

2608
02:14:35,851 --> 02:14:39,180
people that are motivated because they 
see a need for change.

2609
02:14:39,390 --> 02:14:42,310
Whereas some people with other 
administration,

2610
02:14:42,311 --> 02:14:43,770
so like I liked the way things are 
going.

2611
02:14:43,771 --> 02:14:45,570
I'm going to go pursue the private 
sector.

2612
02:14:45,571 --> 02:14:46,404
I'm going to go do this.
I'm going to do people see something 

2613
02:14:48,691 --> 02:14:50,460
like what's happening with trump?
And they say,

2614
02:14:50,461 --> 02:14:52,980
I want to.
I want to stop this.

2615
02:14:52,981 --> 02:14:53,814
This is not the America that I know.
There are people entering politics for 

2616
02:14:56,491 --> 02:14:57,324
the best possible and I think people in 
the right have entered politics for the 

2617
02:15:00,841 --> 02:15:01,674
best possible reason and people in the 
left to the question is how quickly do 

2618
02:15:05,071 --> 02:15:05,904
they get bent by the system?
How quickly do they become part of the 

2619
02:15:09,421 --> 02:15:11,370
system,
the dark side of the forest?

2620
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:13,380
Because like when you like,
you know,

2621
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:17,410
when you say members of congress spend 
30 to 80 percent of them,

2622
02:15:17,530 --> 02:15:18,363
70 percent of the time raising money,
you might think that means they're 

2623
02:15:20,251 --> 02:15:21,840
miserable most of the time,
but you know,

2624
02:15:21,841 --> 02:15:25,620
there's a way in which it's actually 
psychologically rewarding for them.

2625
02:15:25,650 --> 02:15:26,600
So,
um,

2626
02:15:26,740 --> 02:15:27,573
you know,
to be a member of congress right now is 

2627
02:15:28,831 --> 02:15:31,560
a pretty miserable job.
You don't get much done.

2628
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:34,320
Like you're spending all your time like 
rats in a maze.

2629
02:15:34,321 --> 02:15:36,600
Like the bell goes off.
You've got to run to the floor.

2630
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:40,230
Your aide tells you how your two votes,
you vote and you leave from the floor.

2631
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:42,600
It's nothing like what the framers 
imagined.

2632
02:15:42,601 --> 02:15:44,940
Like they were sitting on the floor 
listening to debate about ideas.

2633
02:15:44,941 --> 02:15:45,774
All that's bullshit.
The only debate is debate to cspan as 

2634
02:15:48,410 --> 02:15:50,640
like a speech to cspan and,
and that's,

2635
02:15:50,690 --> 02:15:51,523
and that's what it is.
So the life of a congressman is pretty 

2636
02:15:52,951 --> 02:15:54,650
miserable,
but um,

2637
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:58,200
but when they fundraise,
it's kind of like pushups,

2638
02:15:58,700 --> 02:16:00,930
you know,
sit down and they're told,

2639
02:16:00,931 --> 02:16:02,760
okay,
you've got to raise $20,000.

2640
02:16:03,270 --> 02:16:05,550
And uh,
the aid sit there and say call joe,

2641
02:16:05,551 --> 02:16:08,850
he cares about this and call fred and he
cares about that.

2642
02:16:08,851 --> 02:16:10,800
And you go through and when you hit your
numbers,

2643
02:16:10,801 --> 02:16:11,790
it's like,
hooray,

2644
02:16:11,791 --> 02:16:13,860
I did something.
So it's like,

2645
02:16:13,861 --> 02:16:16,200
you feel like you're accomplishing 
something,

2646
02:16:16,201 --> 02:16:17,034
but the point is the psychology of that 
increasingly makes you okay with the 

2647
02:16:21,931 --> 02:16:25,620
system that you're in and you realize 
you win in that system.

2648
02:16:25,621 --> 02:16:26,454
You've won under that system.
And so your openness to changing the 

2649
02:16:29,321 --> 02:16:30,190
system becomes

2650
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:34,150
really sketchy.
So I think the critical moment right now

2651
02:16:34,151 --> 02:16:34,984
is to,
is to solidify the recognition this 

2652
02:16:37,510 --> 02:16:40,900
congress is corrupted and we have to fix
it.

2653
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:44,180
and you know,
the only thing I'm worried about with hr

2654
02:16:44,181 --> 02:16:47,020
one is that it's gonna make it into a 
democratic issue.

2655
02:16:47,021 --> 02:16:47,854
It's like that democrats care about it,
so the republicans are supposed to not 

2656
02:16:50,051 --> 02:16:50,884
care about it.
The critical thing now is to get 

2657
02:16:51,971 --> 02:16:52,804
republicans to support the idea of 
reform and then make it something other 

2658
02:16:56,291 --> 02:16:58,780
than just a traditional tribal fight 
between left and right.

2659
02:16:59,860 --> 02:17:00,693
Are you optimistiC?
Was I correct in that I'm optimistic 

2660
02:17:05,381 --> 02:17:09,230
about everything outside of the beltway 
and I'm going to fight like hell to,

2661
02:17:09,290 --> 02:17:10,123
to,
to prove that we can fix stuff inside 

2662
02:17:11,831 --> 02:17:12,664
the beltway.
But if you told me I had to bet on my 

2663
02:17:14,171 --> 02:17:16,810
son or daughter's life,
I'm not going to tell you that.

2664
02:17:16,811 --> 02:17:18,480
I think we're going to say I would never
ask you to do.

2665
02:17:18,520 --> 02:17:19,330
Okay,
good.

2666
02:17:19,330 --> 02:17:20,610
All right.
We're clear.

2667
02:17:21,190 --> 02:17:22,840
Thank you for doing this.
I really appreciate it.

2668
02:17:22,841 --> 02:17:24,850
I really enjoyed talking to you.
Let's do this again.

2669
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:27,100
Hopefully you'll be right every time you
ask.

2670
02:17:27,170 --> 02:17:28,060
All right,
we'll do it.

2671
02:17:28,061 --> 02:17:29,230
Thank you sir.
Appreciate it.
