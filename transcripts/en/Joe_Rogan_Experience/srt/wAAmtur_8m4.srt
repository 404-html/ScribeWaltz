1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,020
I get me all the time. I'm
more famous than them. I,

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,730
I wish we could tell you what
we were talking about. Uh,

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,570
and uh, yeah, we were talking about
Joey getting in trouble though.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,470
He just texted me about it.
How's Joey Diaz get in trouble with what?

5
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:24,240
The MMA community MMA outlets.
They have nothing to do. Well,

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,710
here's the thing though.
I see where they're coming from.

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,090
They're journalists.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,710
If someone says something that fucking
outrageous about what Mackenzie Durans

9
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,360
derriere must, uh, he said, I
think your ass smells great. Right?

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,180
Like something along those lines.
You're talking about the comic.

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,990
Uncle Joey said this, Joey, but I get it.

12
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,890
I get where they would and then
Vinny Magallanes backed him up.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,690
I get it packed up Joey. Yeah,
backed up. Joey says tasty too.

14
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,020
Yikes. Yeah. Yikes. I get it. I
don't get it. That's a Joey Diaz,

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,990
the great comic who's commenting
on a hot girl in the UFC.

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,770
He is not a writer and he's
not a journalist. These
writers have nothing to do.

17
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:09,270
So they're like,
how can we get hits?

18
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:12,900
Let's talk about Joey Diaz cause
no one's reading any of our shit.

19
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,800
I agree with you somewhat,
but he definitely did do it.

20
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,930
Like it ain't a bat.
Here's my thing.

21
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,590
They could say whatever they
want about what he said,

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,650
but if he was your friend and he texted
you that you would do what I did cause

23
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,890
I'll show you. He fucking
texted me that before. Tweet.

24
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,550
Of course I love the Joey texts now.
Joey never would text message.

25
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,240
Oh I hope he doesn't keep your
ideas as a full on. Texted me.

26
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,340
He still calls though last week.
Most of the time he calls. But um,

27
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,170
he texted me. Uh, yeah,

28
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,690
it's Julie Diaz,
man.

29
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,730
Sorry folks. I wish I could let you
in. You can go Google what he said.

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,690
I'll try and be respectful.
It's Joey Diaz.

31
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,910
He can say whatever he wants. He doesn't
work for the UFC. He's not, he's not your,

32
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,130
you're right. I'm glad he does. I'm glad
he does think like that. How do you know,

33
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:17,190
send me texts like that.

34
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,420
But if I was a news website and it was
going to report out to, first of all,

35
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,750
you want to plates read. Yeah, went
cliff for sure. That's what they want,

36
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,760
but also anybody who
reads that are you really?

37
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,220
You're either going to be like me or
you're like you're going to start laughing

38
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,470
or you're going to get really upset,

39
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,340
really upset and you're not a Joey
Diaz fan anyway. It doesn't matter.

40
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:42,310
He's happy with that.
95% of that is dude's read and I'm like,

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,320
that's hilarious. The 5%
of like, what the hell?

42
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:51,150
What are we doing? How could you report
this? Yeah, I think that's a good number.

43
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,920
95 95% of duty. That's hilarious.
I was wondering the same thing.

44
00:02:55,921 --> 00:03:00,921
Some women will get upset
though and rightly so if
just to imagine if you were a

45
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:07,171
dude and there were some big Ole giant
Alexander Corel and looking dude who

46
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:12,280
wanted to fuck you and he was always
making jokes about what your butthole must

47
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:15,400
smell like.
They just stop.

48
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,860
Just stop and think of what that would
feel like. That wouldn't be a good time.

49
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,780
If you're Mckenzie,

50
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,190
if you're anybody that someone is
saying those things about right,

51
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,560
I would just be just trying to be open
mind because you're not, you're being

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,580
a little bit turns social
justice. I'm fucking count. I
came out, I just, I'll feel,

53
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,540
but what I'm saying is if you look at
it from the position of the person,

54
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,860
the person who's buttholes in question,

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,550
that would be an uncomfortable
position to PN. Right?

56
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,060
Bunch of people talking about
what your butthole smelled like.

57
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,270
We just trying to make a living on TV.
I just tried to make a living.

58
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,590
Just tried to trick a girl.
He'll let that.

59
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,520
It's also Joey Diaz being complimentary.

60
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,500
It'd be one thing if she
was not an attractive female
or something like that and

61
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,230
she's obviously very attractive,
which is what makes this funny.

62
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,710
I agree 100% I agree.
Now if he tweets out,

63
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:12,730
I wonder what black beast asshole smells
like some like that to fully redeem

64
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:17,320
himself. That's funny too. I
don't know. He might. He might.

65
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,020
Yeah.
I don't know if he can get away with that.

66
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,320
You might just to throw it up there to
give those cheeto finger something to

67
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:27,490
write about. Joey's coming on with EOL
or Merrill. I cannot wait for that.

68
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,330
I cannot, it's going to be a complete,
that's the craziest podcast ever.

69
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,680
They're going to talk in in a Cuban
and I mean speak Spanish obviously.

70
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,330
Then go back and forth trends
go English and whatever.

71
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,320
Whatever he can't get Joey's going to
help him out with, you know, like if I'm,

72
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,020
if I talk too fast or if I say
something he doesn't understand,

73
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,160
Joey's going to jump in and they're going
to go away. It's going to be awesome.

74
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,560
It could be off. Some are complete shit.
You probably can be awesome. Yes. See,

75
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:58,630
be awesome with you and Joey. Joey's
just, he's a great entertainer.

76
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,560
I people don't understand like part of
the reason why he's so funny is he knows

77
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,810
what's in attaining for you Kirk.
He knows.

78
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,320
He knows how to be the life of the party.
Like no one counts.

79
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:10,150
Pretty God damn good at it too.
Calvin's up there.

80
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:13,970
Calcan entertainer room
count can take over Rome and,

81
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,260
and with some of the brings to the party.
I think that's his best art form.

82
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,873
I've told them that.

83
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,720
I think that your best art form is like
inappropriate comedy around people who

84
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:27,390
are trapped. Correct.
Stuck at a party. So Jay,

85
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,980
you're out of plane with them or
something and he can't go anywhere.

86
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:31,060
He's the funniest person I've,

87
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,410
he's made me laugh harder
offstage that almost sandy buddy.

88
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,950
It's so rude. He's right there. He's
right up there offstage with Joey.

89
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,760
But onstage, Joey's just, he's on
governmental, especially right now.

90
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:46,790
He's on another planet. All accounts
fucking hilarious on stage too.

91
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:51,550
But Joey right now, Jesus
Christ Callen just did his, uh,

92
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,940
like a showcase at the Improv.
How'd that go? You know,

93
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,360
and I've heard and murdered.
I kill.

94
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,070
That's good. I've been hearing
good things. That's good. Yeah.

95
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,390
That club is a not a,
not a bad club to work at now.

96
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,930
I wish they would get rid of that
stupid fucking piano on stage though.

97
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,070
That doesn't make any sense to me.

98
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,400
Piano was weird and Brian makes the same
joke about every time. It's hilarious.

99
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,750
Yeah. I won't say what it is. There's,
there's a part where you're standing,

100
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,010
especially if you go anywhere back on the
stage where the people that are on the

101
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:24,890
right side of the stage, like if you're
facing the audience, you're right.

102
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,550
Those people can't see you can't shame.

103
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,610
And there's not a lot of room either
is strange. It's stupid phrases.

104
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,680
Does anyone get on this fucking,
I dunno man.

105
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:37,790
We should have a carrot top or some shit.
Why? No Craig Robinson does on occasion.

106
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,810
Craig's own though. Yeah. Usually
has his electric piano. Denny,

107
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,990
maybe Owen Benjamin Ohn Benjamin can
play the fuck out of a piano lesson.

108
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,820
The moral of the story is
no one's really using that.

109
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,290
Even has a nick easy like huge penis was
like a website that he had or something.

110
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,670
Cause he's a giant dude. Uh, nobody's
using that fucking get rid of it.

111
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,110
Get rid of it. I want it. Doesn't need it.

112
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,710
Like most places don't need God
damn piano. That's so old school.

113
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,670
But just in the way it's an hindrance.
It's taking away from the show.

114
00:07:07,671 --> 00:07:09,320
I really believe it
takes away from the show.

115
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,770
Can you name any other
club with a piano on stage?

116
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,070
Not Rarely. It's hard to think.
It's just a stupid thing to have,

117
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,100
but also look what the comedy store is
doing and then do the Robinson with his

118
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:25,520
own fucking keyboard. You're right. Yeah.
It usually comes out with his own shit.

119
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,610
Yeah. He's probably got a bunch of shit.
Oh sweater thing. Right? Look at him.

120
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,930
I bet he DZA GJS Dj's
the fuck out of a party.

121
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,660
He does look like a mean Dj. He does.
Right. You know who else Djs is? Shack.

122
00:07:37,661 --> 00:07:41,810
If since shack like straight up DJ
his giant ass. Is it real Jay? Yeah,

123
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,040
that's what he does like in his office.
Got Platinum records, multiple p a DJ.

124
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,570
I was a rapper. No, that diesel CD went
platinum and he's got two I got to have,

125
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,730
I have one of them that's amazing returns.

126
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,750
I saw some video of him Dj and it's
like thousands of people like kids just

127
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:03,140
jamming out obviously high off their ass
on x e but it looked like a good time.

128
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,720
That's what he does. Why Not mad? Why not?

129
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:11,730
So Peter's is legit Dj legit legit friends
with all the old school rappers like

130
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:16,520
big Daddy Kane and shit.
I had no idea dude.

131
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:18,860
Russell is seriously legit.

132
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,770
Like when we had him on the
podcast a long time ago,

133
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:26,480
he actually look at the size of the shack
towering over that fucking equipment.

134
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,190
The biggest DJ in the world.
He's so big. He's so crazy. Um,

135
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,110
but Russell law doesn't like those other
guys calling themselves Dj's those like

136
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:39,770
ts doe guys. Really? Yeah, he says
that's not a DJ. He's like a DJ.

137
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,270
Someone who knows how to play records.

138
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,860
These guys are like pressing play on their
laptop and bouncing around with their

139
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:46,910
hands up in the air.
I mean,

140
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:49,920
I think there's more to apply agree kind
of just hitting the playlist and doing

141
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:52,760
your thing. I think there's more
to that. It's a different thing.

142
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:56,340
But to those people that want to hear
that different, those are the masters.

143
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,510
It's like,

144
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,490
I just think it's silly to get hung up
on one art form or another cause in any

145
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:05,100
art form you're going to have.
There's Russell tearing it up.

146
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,490
See now he actually knows how to
like and scratch and all that shit.

147
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,190
He's a talented dude is smart dude.
What else is a very experienced, smart,

148
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,960
very good dude too. Like one of the
nicest people I've ever met. Super,

149
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,470
super fucking sweetheart. First we had a
roast me on stage. It hurt my feelings,

150
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:24,000
but then that was the way of just kind of

151
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,960
all bus a little bus than to the
balls. He's just, I love him. Yeah,

152
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,540
he's a sweetheart.
But um,

153
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,380
he's like super passionate about old
school DJ in like with record players and

154
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:40,650
shit. Like he's really good at that.
And there's an, there's an art to that,

155
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,520
but that's why he hates on these
new guys. Like Dj ts, stow and well,

156
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:46,530
he doesn't hate on them.
He doesn't hate on them.

157
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,540
He just doesn't think that they should
call themselves djs. Dj a disc jockey,

158
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,740
you know what I'm saying?
Anyway, each disc jockey
though, but they're not a disc.

159
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:59,100
They don't have a disc. He's got
a disc and that's part of his art.

160
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:03,360
He's moving disc. Leslie's
disc jockey. I see it.

161
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:05,070
Point is like,

162
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,100
I just think people let people love
that kind of music obviously like Calvin

163
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:10,681
Harris Shit.
Hell yeah.

164
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:13,860
And I'm not saying shit in a bad
racist jams a way of describing it.

165
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,710
But as you're driving down
the road in Vegas, man,

166
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,790
she's big ass Calvin era's
posters and shit and yeah, Diplo,

167
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,590
all those electronic guys.

168
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,760
I mean obviously people love that sound
so I don't think he's saying that they

169
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:30,270
suck. I just think he's saying it's
a different thing. Different. Yeah.

170
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,690
Cause like obviously if you wanted to
hear that shit and you got went there and

171
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:37,100
Russell was scratching records,
she'd be like, come on, come on Bro.

172
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:41,410
I'm here to do ecstasy and listen to do

173
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:48,480
dat, Dat, Dat, Dat, you
know, you know, disc jockey,

174
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,210
a person who introduces in
plays recorded popular music,

175
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,290
especially on radio or at a discount.
They're electric Dj.

176
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,600
Maybe time to update that fucking
super old school. What the fuck is it?

177
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:03,780
Disco had a disco disco.
How about a ballroom?

178
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,310
The thing about those Djs like Steve
Aoki at a documentary on Netflix,

179
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:12,690
which is ridiculous, but because
they're not like live performing,

180
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:14,130
they can do more shows than anyone.

181
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,640
So like Steve Aoki was on the road 300
days out of the year, made something like,

182
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,550
oh my God,
300 gagillion dollars private jet.

183
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,070
He's going from Amsterdam to
China. Yeah, just nonstop. Yeah.

184
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,400
That's all he do. He was at the
Onnit lab. It all out there.

185
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,700
He was the guy who is stolen cakes
and people's faces, mainly girls.

186
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:34,680
He'd toss cake there.
That was his thing.

187
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,920
And then kit one girl and her neck
was a kid. I think he had a lawsuit,

188
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,330
so he stopped throwing the cake and
they're very, I don't throw cakes.

189
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:47,040
It was awesome. People would ask for
it though. This is what he would do

190
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,200
both. Is that the girl that
got hurt? No. I don't know.

191
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,220
Some girl got whiplash though.
Throw

192
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,930
a cake.
Oh my God.

193
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,650
With like a piece of cardboard underneath
it is that it's just the bottom of the

194
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:00,550
cake.
You know what I'm saying?

195
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:04,930
You gotta put on something that seems
sult longest cake toe hits guy in a

196
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:07,990
wheelchair. Well, that's not,
oh, let's not watch this.

197
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:09,940
I don't want to watch the guy in
the wheelchair get hit in the head.

198
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,720
He's all yet. Oh my God.
Maybe it's an honor, right?

199
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,160
Maybe if you're a fan of Steve Aoki,
it's like hit me with the cake. Right?

200
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,320
Like if you're like,
I had to WWE and someone spits on you,

201
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,080
there's a little bit of blood
or something and it did.

202
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:27,730
They catch that conversation spit or
in the NBA that when they fill their

203
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:29,590
mouthpiece, people catch
them. It's disgusting.

204
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,130
Heaven's MMA to you can do with
that thing. I've seen that. Yeah.

205
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,220
Why do people throw them in the
audience? Right. I don't know.

206
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:40,890
It's so does seem so preposterous.
What does this, Jamie, what is it?

207
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:44,620
You said blood spitting blood. This is
it. The guy left and at the Arnold thing,

208
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,310
doctors started spraying and blood
right in the middle of his lift. Whoa.

209
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:53,680
That's where all clean up everything.
I'd take a little break.

210
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,490
You need to see a doctor. Sure. He's fine.

211
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,960
Got a little stomach thing
going on. That's internal
bleeding. He's got a little,

212
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:06,850
uh, Nan's probably nasal infection.
You think bursting. I like that.

213
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,480
Walk it off. You can't be good. I
just dead lift a thousand pounds.

214
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:14,620
Looks pretty healthy to me. Let me see.
Deadlifts and live a long time. Nine 39.

215
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:18,460
It says she sees this crisis
[inaudible] so much weight.

216
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,260
I saw crazy one where a dude
was doing the squat and the,

217
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,600
the bar couldn't handle the weight and
the bar bet and he couldn't get it back

218
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:30,160
onto the rack. And so he had to
like kind of dive out from under it,

219
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,830
but it was a shitload of weight.
Obviously.

220
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:36,970
Imagine that with that kind of weight
on you and you got to figure out how to

221
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:39,340
get it off you.
So without it hurting you.

222
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,700
Have you seen homeboy who when they do
the heavy squats and they blow their

223
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:46,410
asshole out? Oh, I did see that.
That's a tough one. Yeah. I would say,

224
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,350
I would thought you were going to
bring up that guy who was doing, um,

225
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,000
who's doing something,

226
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,040
one of those crossfit games and he was
doing like a clean and his arms gave out

227
00:13:56,201 --> 00:14:00,680
and it dropped down in his
neck and paralyzed him.
Damn Nah, keep it positives.

228
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,530
A friend at Tate's
landed on his neck out,

229
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,540
dead,
just fell down.

230
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,930
It stops being realized now he's paralyzed
from the neck down. She just boom,

231
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,780
like everything just shut off.
He landed on his neck,

232
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,500
probably pass on the crossfit for, well,
you know what it's on. These guys are two,

233
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:20,590
almost two fucking tough for their own
good with something like that where

234
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:22,360
you're holding something over your head.

235
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,870
Do you want a thousand reps or just
they're just trying to smash everybody's

236
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:29,950
reps and Charlotte how bad ass they are,
which is, you know, it's competition.

237
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,720
[inaudible] hates that shit. He says that
and I see other peoples points to that.

238
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:37,420
It's beneficial that the
competition makes you work harder,

239
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,930
but Maxwell's take on it is those type
of exercise movements like power cleans

240
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:47,150
and things like that, they're not clean
up. It's not meant for high reps. I know.

241
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:51,130
Yeah. Those are a strength moves.
They're meant for low reps,

242
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,360
couple sets, you know, heavy shares.
That's not something your body,

243
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:58,610
you shouldn't be doing that and the things
that can go wrong and gonna fuck you

244
00:14:58,611 --> 00:14:58,700
up.

245
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,780
Especially when you start going tons and
you're losing your technique and form.

246
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:06,720
It's dangerous shit man. You lose. And
this guy was out of position too. I mean,

247
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,000
just as bodies. July's tastes.
Boy, he had, Tate knows him.

248
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,390
Tate Tate's big in that.
He's a deepen that crossfit world.

249
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:16,790
He has a lot of those classes.
Finished. Barbell clever.

250
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:21,530
What's his thing over there?
He just something off Lincoln
in Venice. He's always,

251
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,190
he's always there. They just liked some
strong man shit. There's kids everywhere.

252
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,990
I know you're talking about the name
escapes me and me to the box. No,

253
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,280
I sign it. The box and
Venice. Hell, whatever.

254
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,870
Calworks works at Venice barbell club
Tate's always been into hate somewhere

255
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,700
counts though. That kind of working out to
sit back in the day. Is it Doosan? Yeah.

256
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,480
Okay. There you go. Shout out to
do Suzanne. What's up dude? Yeah,

257
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,890
Tate's always been into cattle bells and
you know, muscle ups and shit like that.

258
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:55,410
And it's just crossfit style movements.
And he's a big fan of crossfit.

259
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,750
He loves it. Have you done
a, a ton of a crossfit? No.

260
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,870
I mean I've done, I do those
kind of exercises, right?

261
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,830
I do a lot of a kettlebell stuff.
I do dead lifts.

262
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:08,690
I do a lot of things to do training,
but not,

263
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:12,800
but I don't do it the way they do
it now. Maybe I do that. Pavel,

264
00:16:12,801 --> 00:16:16,100
Tat Salini method where you're
doing like sets of five,

265
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,900
never more than sets of five.

266
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,130
I take that and I take a lot of
time off in between sets. I uh,

267
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,050
I schedule's been so crazy,
man.

268
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:28,310
I haven't been able to go to the gym like
it typically do you know where I work

269
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:30,680
with my trainer and not doing weights?
I'll do mid stuff like that.

270
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,910
So I've been trying to find
some alternatives. Yeah, man,
it's fun to make shit up.

271
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,510
Something different. Yeah. I've
been board like a yoga class,

272
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:42,620
take up and doing yoga, doing hot yoga,
which I love talking tae kwan doe, Bro.

273
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:46,730
How about that? You want to go
deep? Double Knife Ham along me.

274
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,740
Go deep after post career
front kick and motherfuckers I,

275
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,470
I'll pop a hard pass on that man.
I don't want anything to do with Marshall,

276
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,430
but here's the thing. It's
like, do you like, uh,

277
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:06,530
some sort of muck dojo style taekwondo
song as they teach you good technique.

278
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,970
You're going to get a good workout and
try and burn some calories. You know,

279
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,750
you could work at it.
I'm sure.

280
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,120
I'm sure we'll kicks and
shit hard pass hard pass.

281
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:17,630
Joe Ito just for a goof.

282
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,450
Just you and the fit with the pajamas.

283
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:25,190
Just wrist lock and motherfucker
slipping them grabbing that risk.

284
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,270
You fly, fly, fly in on
the ground. Steven Seagal.

285
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,260
That'd be sick. Ooh. Ah, the risks mix.

286
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,280
I go full deep on that. No, would
be fine if you did it and you just,

287
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,840
you did one of them. Uh,
I kido demonstrations.

288
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,620
You show what happens when someone doesn't
just give in. Do you see? He'd be like,

289
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,410
he goes and grabs you and does this and
you're like, push him away from you.

290
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,680
They try to throw you and you just
kind of pushed her head down. I like,

291
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:59,730
come on man, come on man. Come on
Bro. You don't try to counter them.

292
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:03,300
You just go cut. Just cut shots.
Just kept this cause this shake, not,

293
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,010
not working.

294
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,190
You have to like throw yourself at them.
It's all bullshit.

295
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,570
But apparently man, those dudes who
were bad ass I did back in the day,

296
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,970
it was about getting rid of swords.

297
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,040
Guy Comes at you with a
fucking sore and they're all,

298
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,210
they had to learn how to like the
guy's lunging at you literally with a

299
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:26,970
ridiculous movement cause he's
trying to just chop you up. Right.

300
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:31,250
So it would be similar to how these
guys move and throw those yeah.

301
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,350
And those demonstration videos.
But that shit is not negotiable.

302
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,290
If a guy doesn't have a sore, so old
school too, it's just fucking wait.

303
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,680
Well I was thinking about doing this
isn't a sponsor, anything like that.

304
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,420
I was looking at those because
you have one in the back there.

305
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,740
One of those penalty.
What? Pelton bikes. Yeah.

306
00:18:44,741 --> 00:18:47,880
So you work at Pella and just wake
up and do that and then do my thing.

307
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,980
Those are great.
I think they have a whole thing.

308
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:53,280
You'd do a bunch of different workouts
and go online like online cloud.

309
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:57,240
This is a spot. You do it live too.
But you know what I like better.

310
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:02,490
I like the rogue bike. That fucking
assault bike. What is it called? The Echo.

311
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,200
The airdyne. Yeah. Jesus Christ. They
made a beefed up version of what?

312
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,920
I have one here. Yeah, I see two bottles
on it. 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off.

313
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:15,590
Holy Shit Dude. If I give the Pendleton
bike, that rogue thing and uh,

314
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,560
and uh, or the aerodynamic, like
a rower, I'd be straight. Yeah.

315
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,440
Rowers bad. I got a row or two rowers. Bad
Ass too. I do 30 and 30 with the rower.

316
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,580
So 30 minutes of sprint
in 30 minutes arrest,

317
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,450
30 minutes of sprint in 30 minutes
seconds. She's just Christ.

318
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,690
Are you on, sir? Imagine if
you could just sprint for 30

319
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,820
excuse me,
30 seconds.

320
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,810
So the Tabata is a 2010
and then I go from,

321
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:44,060
I do like um,

322
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,400
it'll do eight rounds of 2010 and then I
go over and do the row machine and I'll

323
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:53,310
do eight rounds of 30 30 30 seconds on,
30 seconds off.

324
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,770
And then I'd go back and do it
again and then I'd do it again.

325
00:19:55,771 --> 00:20:00,450
And if I've got the sauce, if I got the
stones, I could do three sets. Austin,

326
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,120
I've only done three sets once and I
had a double up on the shroom tech.

327
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:07,830
You felt sick. I was beat
down, man, you're just really
exhausted at the end of it.

328
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,520
It's also a short and your body.

329
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:13,080
Super intense at the tongue they sit and
most people think that's the best word

330
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:15,960
that you can do. It does
something to you, I guarantee you.

331
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,560
Because one of things after doing
it like three or four times,

332
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,300
I started to feel it in my running.
It called running a lot too though.

333
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,480
But my running,
my endurance and runnings getting better.

334
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,930
And I think maybe some of that
might have to do with the biking.

335
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,380
Just cause the buzzer.
Mike works out different muscles to men.

336
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,670
Your lungs too when it has to adapt to
that kind of capacity moving like that.

337
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:42,420
That's not it. It's the beefy one. I
will break that shit. Just saw it Jamie.

338
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,840
It's called the rogue echo.
Echo air or some shit.

339
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,440
I've been doing a the thousand meter
test on the row, like I'll get done,

340
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:52,720
hit mitts on my train and then
they go 8,000 meters. I see.

341
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,280
They have the records for the week.

342
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,760
I try and beat the records and just so
anybody knows, that's not a sneaky ad.

343
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,750
I paid for all the rogue stuff. It's here.
I bought it all. No, no, that's it. Right.

344
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,430
That dog thing is beefy, beefy
as fuck. Got Girders and shit.

345
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,940
You got a fat ass handle on a girder.
Yanni.

346
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,010
Step my game up so I don't have
to leave to the gym to save time.

347
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,890
It's nice to be able to just
do it in your house. You know,

348
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:17,970
all you need is a chin up bar and
some kettle bells at home and,

349
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:19,300
and you could just get something done.

350
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,570
That's what I need because sometimes you
know that thing where you have really,

351
00:21:22,571 --> 00:21:23,920
you have an hour before you have to leave.

352
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:27,030
Like a might be looking to the gym
and squeeze 30 minutes in. That's the,

353
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:28,030
that's what I've been doing.
Yeah.

354
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,790
It's cause I have to wake up with my son
and I'm like done with him and then him

355
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,550
with an hour and then you'd
be at the studio here.

356
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,190
I'm going to New York and doing this. I
just wanted to do something at home. Dude.

357
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:40,240
I become addicted to the fasted cardio.
I used to do that before.

358
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,870
[inaudible] are thrown up. Yeah, but I
think that's your coffee intake. Yeah.

359
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:44,720
You're probably ready to talk.

360
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,800
What do you like 20 cups a day or
something under 16 cuffs and then fasting

361
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,870
until to the doctors,
not tooth, that moron.

362
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,490
That's so much. Whatever. It's so much.

363
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,330
Just too much of the switch of everything
and if you not having any food then

364
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:03,910
it's just going straight in there.
It's all getting absorbed.

365
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:07,730
I'm on all these medications now.
I had to get off Kido real dying.

366
00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:10,540
Joe Have Stage one diabetes.
What is the medications?

367
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:15,370
They put up some antiacid
like super strong stuff so
I can still drink my coffee.

368
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,930
It's just not a possibility. It's not to
keep my coffee. I have to. I was like,

369
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:24,640
you will. You will fuck
up my entire workflow if I
can't drink coffee. So crazy.

370
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,480
Yeah, but fasting cardio is the
way to go. Yeah. I love it, man.

371
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,460
I get addicted to it.
You know when I get addicted to,

372
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,180
I get addicted to the feeling of having
done it when I didn't want to do it.

373
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,240
That's what I realized. This
running thing is for me. It's this,

374
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:40,360
this little game I'm playing with my
brain where I know I'm going to do it,

375
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:43,450
but I wake up, I'm like, oh,
and then Marshall's Barkan

376
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,950
I'll put him in the backyard. It's like,
come on bitch. He wants to go. Dude,

377
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,540
he's so crazy now.

378
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,200
I love that we've been doing it so much
so he's in really good shape at fucking

379
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:58,140
dogs and shaped dogs. Getting shaped
like that. He's getting a little Chubby,

380
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,880
you know, but he was the only like
you still had baby fat on him.

381
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,980
He's only 14 months old.

382
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,540
So when I took him he was like nine or
10 months old when I first started taking

383
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:07,900
them.

384
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,470
I just wasn't sure if he was going to
listen or I was worried like what if we

385
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:14,530
run into a rattlesnake or something
like that would suck. It sucks.

386
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:16,960
He got used to the routine.
You could get them to the hospital though.

387
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,300
They survived. They're a lot tougher
than us, you know, suck it out.

388
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,090
Switch to hit him on the nose. You
get us knock it out. That's not real.

389
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,050
That's what I've heard bro.
I've heard it too. It was ready.

390
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,850
So fake that just bro Science, it doesn't
work but it can really suck it out.

391
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:31,300
Dogs die cause it hits him on the
nose and so you know it gets spread.

392
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,850
That's what I've heard. No, my
dog had been on the nose. Use.

393
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,470
Your dog has my pit by ral sake. Yeah.
Did he die? No, he's still alive now.

394
00:23:38,471 --> 00:23:42,700
He's dead now. Was a long time ago
when we doing this a long time ago.

395
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:47,910
I all my dogs got bit by rattlesnakes
except [inaudible] squeaky Fromme she was,

396
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:52,410
uh, she didn't give a fuck about snakes.
She was just fuck up other dogs did her,

397
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:53,660
that was my prison dog.

398
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,150
That was a dog that I got from the
pound that was in the power of this from

399
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:59,930
Callan count and count suggestion
feel quite yet what is in the city,

400
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,620
the La animal shelter for like
five or six months. It was a sweet,

401
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:05,320
sweet dog doe people.

402
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:10,590
It did not want any dogs ruining
her new found party dog aggression.

403
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,251
Well she,

404
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:17,251
she lived for the formative months
of her childhood before I got her,

405
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:22,130
she lived in his cage and I think
that that fucks with a dog's head.

406
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,040
Nobody adopted her for like, I think
it was at least five or six months.

407
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:25,874
Poor bunny.

408
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,840
And then once you finally do get adopted
and get all this love for these people,

409
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:32,990
you get to sleep in bed with them
and shit and they take you home.

410
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:35,600
And I mean a dog was,
she slept right by my bed.

411
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,830
Sometimes they would hop in the bed,

412
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:38,920
but I have to kick them off
because they fart and shit. See,

413
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,230
I like him in the bed. I like to
the dogs in the bed. Keep it. Yeah,

414
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,280
it does keep it warm, but sometimes they
fart and it's brutal. You like, oh Jesus,

415
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,150
if it's a hot summer nights, I get outta
here. Man. I know the itchy and shit.

416
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,860
But um, she so like any dog that she
thought might steal that from her,

417
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,270
like any dog that came in, she just,
she would growl with dogs. You pet them.

418
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,230
She just was not into it.
So insecurity issues.

419
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,100
There's good and bad guys are running
all the time. I've never, I've,

420
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,590
I struggled with that a little bit
lately where I'll be tired and I'm like,

421
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:13,280
come on, you got to work out. I've never
had a work out. And then afterwards went,

422
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,380
man, I wish I didn't do
that. Yeah, well, ever.

423
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:18,800
Not once people are saying this
to people need to understand,

424
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:22,220
like I saw a couple of comments people
saying this is terrible advice and you

425
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,430
should listen to your body when
your body is tired. The snapshot.

426
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,400
That's not right. No, you're
not. No, no tired. Yeah,

427
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,280
I know what I need to rest and I also can,

428
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:35,780
I know like how when I've done too much
stuff, like I've done like two works out,

429
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:36,700
two workouts a day,

430
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,620
three days in a row before and then you
get to that fourth day and you're like,

431
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,480
Whoa, all right. I probably should
do nothing today. Like just that's,

432
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,520
that's almost tougher to do them
working out for me to take a day off.

433
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:50,130
It's almost tougher psychological. Yes.
Cause I'm like, oh don't be a pussy.

434
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:53,090
You don't see him right
now. He's going good. Right?

435
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:54,380
You body starts thinking it's going to go,

436
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,260
but there's a moment where you
realize that you're probably,

437
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:00,440
I should really monitor my
resting heart rate in the morning.

438
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,180
That's another thing
Steve Maxwell taught me.

439
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:05,490
He said that that's one of the best ways
to figure out if you're overtraining,

440
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:07,430
we're training.
We still do wake up in the morning.

441
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,050
If your heart rate is five to 10
beats over, what it normally is,

442
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,240
don't do shit because you're
fighting something off.

443
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,940
Either you're fighting something off
where you need to recover and you can do

444
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:19,100
like light skill work.
They say if you're sick,

445
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,950
working out makes it worse because
it messes up your immune system,

446
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,740
your immune system. You're usually,
I know if I'm being lazy, I'm like,

447
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:27,890
God was trying to rest in bed, man. Oh, I
just want to do this. I'd rather do this,

448
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,370
but you know what? If you're not too sick,
if you're not too debilitated to work,

449
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,780
it's not, it's not a bad thing to just
do light, no focus work. Just move.

450
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:38,760
Like try to figure out some technique
where you're not doing anything hard in

451
00:26:38,761 --> 00:26:41,090
the steam room or sauna. Sauna. Yeah,

452
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,650
and someone who asks me
about steam versus Sauna.

453
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,620
I as Rhonda Patrick and there's,

454
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:49,770
there hasn't really been studies done on
the sauna or the steam room either that

455
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:53,310
show the benefits of the sauna, but it'll
probably ship that both how to shit.

456
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,360
It probably has some benefit.

457
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:58,590
The only difference is that the sauna can
get way hotter because it's a dry heat

458
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,840
so the sonic can get, you know, my son,

459
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:05,580
I've had it up to more than 190 we sucked
up and headed to send that Sutton in

460
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:09,570
Boston. You're a serial killer. The
10 more minutes shop and I was dying.

461
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:12,900
I was like, ah, I think I'm
set, man. Think I'm kind of set.

462
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,370
I'm all red like a lobster.
It's just got to go.

463
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:20,070
You just gotta just go empty in there.
I know, I hear Ya. But I was good man.

464
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,330
Like no, we were in there for a
minute. Jamie dipped out super early.

465
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,690
10 minutes before everybody.
I didn't know that. Hey,

466
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:37,320
Jamie got their first shout out to
equinox and Boston. Great fucking gym.

467
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,580
That's a good night, man. Yeah,

468
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:41,040
they keep it at one 70 that's what
most people think it should be.

469
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,980
One 70 but if she was one
seven he would steam. Man,

470
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:46,080
you're getting cooked in there.
That's not good.

471
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,140
I don't think you can take that heat,
so the idea is that the sauna,

472
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:51,060
because it's a dry heat for the most part,

473
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,160
I know sometimes people throw
some water on the rocks,

474
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,200
but it's a dry heat for the most part,

475
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:58,710
and that that is what you want because
that's what your body responds to,

476
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:02,550
the just the actual temperature and
producers, those heat shock proteins.

477
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,960
That makes sense. Totally makes sense.
You know, it's weird sometimes in the UFC,

478
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:09,150
and you can feel this too,
if it's at a hockey arena,

479
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,480
like t mobile where the sometimes the,
when you get into the octagon again,

480
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,011
that crowd,

481
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:18,930
it's freezing because there's ice
on the low fee for the fighter.

482
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,740
Yeah. It takes a while
to get going. You see?

483
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,010
You'll see guys for the first round like,
God,

484
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,220
he looks a little stiff or what's going
on here? It's freezing out there, man.

485
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:27,420
You're Justin shorts,
right?

486
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,600
You're sweating in the back and
it's warm in that locker room.

487
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,120
Then when you come out,
it's this God,

488
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,520
so he's a total difference when you
get in right away. I'd like, goddammit.

489
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,480
I'd always think about it. Is that
a hockey team there? Oh there's ice.

490
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,300
So I had to calculate that thought
or focus on something else,

491
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:47,301
but I didn't realize it until one day I
saw like a crack in between the boards,

492
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:50,130
the floorboards and I looked
down, I went, that's fucking ice.

493
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,190
There's ice there right now. And like you
get to keep it. They keep the ice there.

494
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:55,350
They keep ice,
they keep ice.

495
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,790
You're just all these thousands
of people chill on top of ice.

496
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,890
Well it can't break. No, I'm just
saying it's kind of weird. Oh,

497
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:08,040
it's definitely weird. But it's it better.
Well not for the fighters for sure.

498
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:09,370
But is it better for the audit?
Because it,

499
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:13,350
sometimes it gets fucking hot in those
places if you have a just a big ass chunk

500
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,310
of ice in the middle of everybody.
I think keep kind of smart.

501
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:19,410
Like the only time it's been
super cookie is in, in Brazil.

502
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,450
There's didn't use any AC or anything.

503
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,840
I was in one of them and it was
an open air place in Brazil,

504
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,140
so we're indoors but at the top,
the top areas,

505
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:35,960
it's like these big open doors that face
the outside. There's bugs flying around.

506
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:40,440
Shit. Some Brazilians shit man. It
was moist and warm. Where was though?

507
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:44,410
It was Wa there's one with Anik in someone
and they're literally just sweating

508
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,010
the pit stains and sweating it out.
That happened in Abu Dhabi too.

509
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,770
We're not with Dobie. I was drenched.
That was outdoors. That was an outdoor,

510
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:58,360
yeah. Who was that mean? Hilson Weidman
Anderson. Damien Maia. That's right.

511
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,090
Yeah. Why did we find out there
too? I forget. I think you flat.

512
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,370
Bj Penn fought Frankie Edgar.

513
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,760
That's where a Frankie Edgar won
the title and the, they've had Roy.

514
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:12,280
Yeah. Nog out there. Yup. Haven't been
back there in a while. It's been a while.

515
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,840
It's been a minute. Hot Minute.
Yeah. That one was crazy cause you,

516
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,190
you saw bugs flying around and you never
knew were real [inaudible] shit out

517
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:23,350
there. I went on a hike. I was like,
oh I'm in Jumanji. This is cool. Like,

518
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:27,080
what in the fuck is this shit you've
never seen before? It's crazy.

519
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:28,760
He'd go to other countries,
man, they're there.

520
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:32,680
They have completely different ecosystems.
The point where you look at things,

521
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:36,910
you go, what in the fuck is that? What
is that? But where it's dangerous too.

522
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,070
I remember I was in Brazil,
we are climbing this thing and they go,

523
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,320
now listen fellas, you got to
make sure we're with the locals.

524
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:44,200
Like you have to come
down before nightfall,

525
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:47,320
otherwise they're not going to find you.
What kind of Shit is this?

526
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:52,080
So we just dipped out getting up there
and my man, I man, her legs like, man,

527
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:56,380
you got lost. He, we didn't see him for
the rest of the night. The local was like,

528
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,520
he's one, he's one with the
jungle now. I'm like, Whoa,

529
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:05,510
what the fuck does that mean?
The rundown and some shit.

530
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,580
What do you mean he's one with the jungle?
He just,

531
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,250
he said he showed up a day later, just
exhausted. Don't get an ounce of sleep.

532
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:18,310
And someone in one of these huts took
them under their wing and saved them.

533
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,160
Oh my God. People up. Do you
get helicoptered out of there?

534
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:22,720
If they get trapped at
the top? I was like, dude,

535
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,170
I feel like I shouldn't be doing fight.
I feel like it's a bad idea.

536
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,370
How many days before a fight was this?
This was like a week before. It's crazy.

537
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,400
The guy in front of us had assumed gone
basically a speedo just asshole out in

538
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:33,911
front of us.

539
00:31:33,911 --> 00:31:38,911
Just fucking going and I'm like
[inaudible] your foot and just doing work.

540
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:44,221
Smoking US shredded 10 fucking
all us with their feet look like,

541
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,070
like hobbits feed like
fucking craziest feed ever.

542
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,510
These people that live in the forest,
they splay out like a hand and they,

543
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:56,340
they're super thick toes and she didn't
like it doesn't look anything like, no,

544
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:00,640
we have bitch feet. Yeah Dude.
Believe me man. Sore today.

545
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:04,910
I had a run in regular running shoes
because my feet are sore from the vibrams

546
00:32:04,911 --> 00:32:07,600
and yeah, from the just
the pounding. I know.

547
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:12,250
I'm scared of that plantar fasciitis than
we ever had it. No, get your mind right.

548
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,950
Let's go ahead and get on.
There's a reason there's technology son.

549
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:16,630
Let's quit run beer. But no, no, no.

550
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:19,480
I think it just the barefoot
thing strengthens your feet up.

551
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,410
I think it just takes time. I'm just
being real careful. Be Super careful.

552
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,560
It's a nightmare. I'm sure
Dominick Cruz had to deal with it.

553
00:32:26,561 --> 00:32:27,610
I've done it at night.

554
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:31,180
I had to get shots and Jackson and my
foot and with dom cruisey was the same

555
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:35,680
thing. It was coming back too quickly.
Like he, he had a knee injury, right.

556
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,410
So after his knee injury then he
just tried to get way back in shape,

557
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:40,040
way quick and

558
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,330
fucked his feet up.
Mine was just,

559
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:44,360
I think from being so big in this
running I was doing, you know,

560
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,230
miles and miles and miles and
miles. I love running. It's layered.

561
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,300
My favorite thing to do,
Neil Brennan did it on it.

562
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:54,210
He got planner from a treadmill from
wearing those vibrams. If, if you're,

563
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,470
they say you got to work
into them kind of work.

564
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,030
Just don't want it to go straight
barefoot and just start doing work. No,

565
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:01,660
you definitely do. To me,
you do good to be barefoot.

566
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,370
Like I like walking in the street.
I feel like I'm doing something dangerous.

567
00:33:04,371 --> 00:33:07,550
Like on the sidewalk. Korea flit.
Yeah, like double. I'm while go. Wow.

568
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,630
I feel nice about it. I don't know what
it is, man. It makes me feel free. Yeah,

569
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,770
I know. It's dirty and dangerous
clothes to get dirty and dangerous.

570
00:33:15,771 --> 00:33:17,990
That's what life is supposed to
be supposed to be. Interacting,

571
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:21,420
interacting with other life barriers.
That's your feet.

572
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,480
Nice rubber barrier between you and
the world. That shit ain't right.

573
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:28,160
You always can find. I like to let
them breathe a little bit. Man.

574
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,560
One of the Indians had it
right with moccasins. He,

575
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,560
there's no airflow with
those Goddamn moccasins.

576
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,480
They didn't give a fuck with
things smelled like back then.

577
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:39,210
All that smelled like they gave up. They
just didn't give a fuck. That felt like

578
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,980
if they could find a creek, the temporary,
put some of that fire out real quick.

579
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,540
I'm not about that life. I'm
not, I'm not like that ma'am,

580
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,850
but they would just run
around with moccasins.

581
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:53,780
They basically just had like a layer of
leather between their foot in the ground.

582
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,920
It's all they could do. Climb
mountains with that. Hey,
hey, hey, what is this Jamie?

583
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:02,930
How dare you Jamie? This guy is slicing
chunks off of the bottom of his foot.

584
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:05,660
I mean those houses that
makes me feel sick, bro.

585
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,380
Man cuts cows off his foot
with a knife and dog eats it.

586
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,870
This is the name of this video.
How the fuck did you find that?

587
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,990
Look at these callouses,
dude, this is insane, bro.

588
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:19,280
This guy is just slicing through
these cows is like, it's a coconut,

589
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:22,280
like it's coconut milk. It's
like a pineapple. This is insane.

590
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,220
Have you ever seen anybody have cows?
It's like this before though.

591
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,890
I think this guy has a problem.
Why ain't normal?

592
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:31,040
What kind of a man can just
cut out his foot like that?

593
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:33,680
How do you don't hop how deep to cut?
We don't cut your him he off.

594
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,540
You know this dude is not sharpening
that knife. That's not a sharp knife.

595
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,510
That's not she's, this is crazy ma.
That guys can feed them and the dog,

596
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,760
the dog is taking the pieces of
meat mean a dog's a man eater.

597
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,900
That's how in the world foreign TV,

598
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,320
Jamie's got that bookmarked.
Couldn't wait. Did you say feet?

599
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,810
Just couldn't wait till the track.
That shit.

600
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:04,670
Who the fuck cuts off the bottom of their
feet with a knife like that and what's

601
00:35:04,671 --> 00:35:06,440
he doing to get his feet like that?

602
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,030
Why is he yelling at that
dog while I taught his feet?

603
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,060
That makes it this close thrown out.

604
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:13,730
Wouldn't you like to think that the dog
would get used to that smell like that's

605
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:16,910
what I like to eat now and then like
you'll be sleeping. The dog's hungry.

606
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:20,030
He's like, fuck it. I'm just kind of snack
out in this dude's feet. Zombie. Doug,

607
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,020
you got a Zombie dog in his now it
looks like a bloodhound to dogs.

608
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:27,800
Got Damn horrible monster
meeting either human neater.

609
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:33,500
Wow. Going to feel super sick man.
On another note, how about that?

610
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:38,450
Brian Ortega, the other know
how bout banner take, give him,

611
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,390
I don't want to show yesterday night
as awkward cause me and Brian are super

612
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:45,570
close and I don't know what it is
because same thing with Steve Bay.

613
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:49,310
Whenever I know these guys,
it's a, I know him from when,

614
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,020
when I trained with them and I've seen
it in that light like with Brian or take

615
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:53,280
a corner him for his,

616
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,520
one of his fights before he got to the
UFC and I knew him as that Brian or Tayga

617
00:35:56,521 --> 00:36:00,690
where all Jujitsu, you know, cardio
for days, but terrified to fight.

618
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:03,850
Like I know miss is that Brian and now
he's evolved into the number one feather

619
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:07,290
weight in the world. So when I, when he
get the Frankie Edgar fight, I was like,

620
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:11,100
God, I just feel like it's
a terrible match up man. I'm
telling Hannah, I'm like,

621
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,250
what's he going to do? And he's
like, don't worry man, don't worry.

622
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,460
And so on my show,
which Brian and Heather listen to,

623
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,760
to like do they come in and like, how are
you gonna pick against me? I'm like, no.

624
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,590
I said, my brain went with
frank. You just, cause it's
Frankie Edgar, he's a legend.

625
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,610
My heart wanted to do Brian.
He's like, dude, it hurt my
feelings. I'm like, I don't,

626
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,760
I don't, I'm sorry man. Like I, and I
don't know what it is with Steve Bay too.

627
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,460
Whenever I see him,
I know him as that version of them.

628
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:38,300
It's a problem that I have. I like
this gap. I don't know what's going on.

629
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,220
People always do that.
They do that.

630
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,860
You remember someone by what they were
when they were at their worst and not

631
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:47,260
even the worst, but it's in the infancy
of their, of their, of their careers,

632
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:51,530
their worst. Just say a lesser version
of who they are now. Correct. Right.

633
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,150
It's like, do you ever get that feeling
when you go back to high school?

634
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,390
Like if I'm around someone from
high school, I feel like a loser.

635
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,930
I know this is a weird feeling, not
100% when I go back to Denver, I'm,

636
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:05,910
I'm almost not myself because I feel
like this almost the Allen was like this

637
00:37:05,911 --> 00:37:07,990
loser. A loser because, yeah,

638
00:37:07,991 --> 00:37:12,630
because you remember back who you were
when you were insecure and starting out

639
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:15,150
in life and just that's a normal thing.
You know,

640
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,080
they always say that about comedy clubs.
Like if you start out at a club,

641
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:23,460
that club will never respect you. They
respect you when you leave and you know,

642
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,660
maybe you get a TV show or something
like that and then come back and the gay.

643
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,280
Yeah, I remember when you sucked
though. Do you remember when you suck?

644
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,000
I always had it. I had a problem with
that and Boston at first. Really? Yeah,

645
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:36,600
because they remembered me as this guy
who was an opener and then you know,

646
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:40,530
how am I had like I remember when you
were opening and you did 20 minutes,

647
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:43,620
you open. That's what you do. I
know. Like you're not a headliner.

648
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:48,480
I had one night and this is not in my
nature at all. I'm going to go back.

649
00:37:48,481 --> 00:37:51,180
It just been busy. But I had one
at the laugh factory. I've just,

650
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:56,080
I bombed Ben Bom Bom like, like, cause
like I should probably not do this.

651
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,200
Oh, just one guy in
the back. She goes, oh.

652
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:05,160
I'm like, no doubt. No doubt man. I
get in the car and I drive down sunset.

653
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:08,220
I'm like, what the fuck am I
doing man? It's so embarrassing.

654
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:12,970
I've been back since but not
because because of my column scare,

655
00:38:12,971 --> 00:38:13,771
the laugh factory.

656
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:16,500
It's just that I've been at the store
and then just been on the grind,

657
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:19,320
but I do have it in your head like you
got to get back up there and clean that

658
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:24,060
up and literally I think about every
day it's something back here and to get

659
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:27,900
your ass up there, man. We go, but
I'll go to the comedy store. Nope,

660
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:31,530
get your ass up there. See
that's an athlete's perspective.
That's the difference.

661
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,110
It's one of the things that I've
been saying to people about you.

662
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,070
The difference between way
you've been approaching

663
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,360
comedy and another person would do it.

664
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:39,010
You're doing it from an
athlete's perspective.

665
00:38:39,011 --> 00:38:41,940
Like you work hard at Shit and you know
where your weaknesses are and you got to,

666
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:46,390
you fix those other people,
ignore him. That's a real problem.

667
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,370
You know like it.

668
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:51,340
Like someone will have a joke and the
joke doesn't do well like several nights

669
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:52,840
in a row, but they keep
doing it the same way. Like,

670
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:55,390
why are you doing it the same way?
You need to cut some of that out.

671
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:58,150
You need to tweak this and you turn
that around and needed to add something.

672
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,650
Maybe not explaining it enough,

673
00:38:59,651 --> 00:39:03,490
but if it's not doing well and you
keep doing it the same exact way,

674
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,030
it's not the crowds Homan. Yeah, you got
to figure out they're there to laugh.

675
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,600
People get stuck in a weird pattern
though of wanting to do things exact same

676
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:14,000
way over and over again. Oh,
nothing's better than me when it,

677
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,110
it's such an honor to have him
at the comedy store. If I was,

678
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:21,010
it comes through in La Jolla in a
comic go, hey, you should try this.

679
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,920
I listen to jokey. Should button with
this or try this. I'm like, dude,

680
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:27,010
that's brilliant, man. Yeah. Every now and
then someone will just nail it for you.

681
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,970
They just find, they see something
that maybe you didn't see any like, oh,

682
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:33,370
like you ever thought about going
this direction? I'm like, dude,

683
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,200
it's not like the writing your jokes like,
Hey,

684
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:37,810
what if we went this direction with,
I'm like that dude. That's brilliant.

685
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:40,060
Man That's happens in martial arts too,
right?

686
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:43,810
Like hasn't someone like pointed something
out to and you're like, oh shit. Oh,

687
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:47,860
100% with a choker. Your hands are like
this. Do you ever tried it like this?

688
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:50,860
And I do that. Yeah. That makes
sense. It's so much easier. Yeah.

689
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,580
Sometimes things don't seem like they'd
be easier and they are like this,

690
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:57,280
that Pretzel Grip, this
grip. And you're like,

691
00:39:57,281 --> 00:39:59,870
why would I grab something like that?
And then you do and you like,

692
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:04,690
if someone shows you, but I
feel like not in my, yeah,

693
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,250
it feels nice. Feels Nice. Oh you ain't
getting, no, no, no. It's a bribe.

694
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:14,170
Or take your shit to his guillotine
is ridiculous and icy grip it and he's

695
00:40:14,171 --> 00:40:17,290
getting, he, he's, he's just a,
he has all sorts of variations.

696
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,070
Emma fuckers Nice with it.
He's here, you know it's right.

697
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,140
You know he's here a lot of times
he goes flat. He's so good at it.

698
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:28,410
But cozy like Marcello, like
how Marcel slides it. Yeah.
Like a blade catches laid.

699
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,720
Yeah. And he's, he's the best
at the world in it. But he also,

700
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,590
he's getting the respect now from the
crowd because if you remember when Frankie

701
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:40,020
kind of fake that shot and got ahold of
his neck then craton tire cargoes. Yeah.

702
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,320
Cause it's like,
oh shit.

703
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:44,770
They realize what he's capable of when
that dude gets a hold of your neck.

704
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:47,650
It's a totally different proposition.
When he would,

705
00:40:47,651 --> 00:40:50,080
he did to cub Swanson at
the end of the first round,

706
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:54,550
basically be that cob basically out cub
was fucked and it was just a matter of

707
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:55,900
the time ran out.

708
00:40:55,901 --> 00:40:58,930
But that shit was fully locked
in and cub wasn't going anywhere.

709
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,540
I got emotional yesterday when he came
in the room because I haven't seen him

710
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:05,500
since and I went [inaudible] not even
on air went, hold on. Stop though Bro.

711
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,380
Let hear me real quick before we went.

712
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,920
Tells you this under you get
in touch all that and went,

713
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,250
you're the number one
feather weight in the world.

714
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,380
Remember I cornered you for
that rough and nasty fighting.

715
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,850
Would her Glendale where
the fuck with or that? No,

716
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,830
he's the number one guy in the world.
Brian let that soak in.

717
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,440
He's a number one contender.
Max Holloway's in number one in the world.

718
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,050
He's ranked number one the world.
Right, but number one contender true.

719
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,050
He's number one. I was insane.
That's always the champ.

720
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,130
That's the number one until they find the
champion. Right. Number one the world.

721
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,350
That was the message.
I not understand that.

722
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:40,130
That if I was Max
Holloway motherfucker for,

723
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:41,420
well they're going to fight for sure.

724
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:43,700
Not Max Holloway is the greatest
featherweight in the world right now,

725
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:48,320
but for providing or Tayga to
go from. It's crazy to see, man.

726
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:49,790
It's a very interesting fight.

727
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,450
It's nuts cause the Ortega is super
dangerous standing in on the ground.

728
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:57,410
He's on a totally different level than
anybody else. They're also the same size,

729
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:01,340
like the way it usually has a
big advantage of reach and size,

730
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:04,490
but now they're kind of equal. Dude.
Holloway something special though, man.

731
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,000
He's something special.
Special. He did it.

732
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:11,060
Although when he did the Aldo was
crazy twice, twice and the second time.

733
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:14,060
More emphatic like,
like he knew he was getting no,

734
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,070
that's always something special.
Special.

735
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,130
And it's almost like when
you watch what he does,

736
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:22,340
you can't appreciate it until
you see it a bunch of times.

737
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:26,420
Because like what he's doing, he's not
knocking someone out with one head kick.

738
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:31,100
He's not like catching someone with some
unbelievable spectacular submission.

739
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,800
No. What he's doing is just fucking you
a cause. Outclassing regularly. Yeah,

740
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,550
with technique and he's ferocious.

741
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:40,580
And then where do you want to do you want
to do take out, do you want to do pace?

742
00:42:40,581 --> 00:42:42,590
You want a little bra? You want a bra?
I'm gonna draw the line right here.

743
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:45,980
Come ball and see how that goes for it.
And that's what Brian kept fall into.

744
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:50,810
And I, Brian will be, I'm sure in Vegas
eyes, the underdog, which rightfully so,

745
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:52,850
it's Max Holloway, the greatest
featherweight in the world right now.

746
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,980
So with Brian Hitch says to be careful,

747
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,610
Max alert you into that brawl and he's
not going to lose those brawls. Yeah,

748
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:00,590
he's very good at Bra and that's
for damn sure. And he did.

749
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:04,430
The crazy thing was the, the lamas
fight. Oh my God. Ricardo Lamas.

750
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:07,330
He's beating his ass and then he
just points the set of the schedules.

751
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,740
Come on man, let's fucking throw it
out. He's one of my favorite fighters.

752
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:13,310
Then bites his mouthpiece down. It's
just windmill and that you can do that.

753
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,690
Can you do technique? You want to
do Jitsu? Whatever you want to do.

754
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,580
I really want to do. It sounds like
from what Brian told me is they're,

755
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:23,130
they're aiming for that international
fight week. So you'd have DC, Steve Bay,

756
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:26,690
maybe Cyborg, Amanda Nunez. Then you
got Brian. We're taking Max Holloway.

757
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,690
Well matches broke his foot.
So what are we at right now?

758
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,390
How many weeks is he out?
Is even out of his cast yet.

759
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,370
I don't think he's out of his cast.

760
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:38,060
I think I saw a photo of him on
Instagram was about two weeks ago.

761
00:43:38,061 --> 00:43:40,550
He had a cast on,
he's on tough help in DC right though.

762
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:44,600
You probably done the tough catches or
doing it, you know, standing on his cast.

763
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:49,310
But who are we in March, April,
May, June, April, May, June, July,

764
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:53,360
four months. Um, a foot of
bone in the foot is not,

765
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:56,540
it's not an easy one because
you're always standing on it. No.

766
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:57,321
And then when you get back,

767
00:43:57,321 --> 00:44:01,460
it's going to take time and then you're
going to be real hesitant to kick things.

768
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,250
Well, Hey, I, I'm not the one who started
the rumor was international fight week.

769
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,900
That's what, yeah, that's what,
that's what, or take his hearing. He,

770
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,250
they want to do in Hawaii. Obviously
Heather and Brian wanted, they were like,

771
00:44:10,251 --> 00:44:13,580
we'd love to go to Hawaii, go to his
hometown and do it. But you know,

772
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:16,040
there's a lot of moving
pieces for UFC get to Hawaii.

773
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:18,860
Well the other thing is
inside and outside, like how,

774
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,180
how big of an arena
they have that's inside.

775
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:24,290
It was well outside the of the stadium,
right?

776
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:27,260
They could do the giant state in which
would sell out. It would sell out.

777
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:30,170
But what if it rained,
which it does in Hawaii all the time.

778
00:44:30,171 --> 00:44:34,350
We fighting in the ring wet and wild.
Remember that one and watch that.

779
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,080
Can you the cage, you wouldn't
watch that rainy, the rainy. I mean,

780
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:41,400
it'd be so weird, but no, you can't
take the breast to have. Yeah,

781
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:43,530
it's a good risk to have.
Look, can't have it though.

782
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:45,210
You got to be phenomenal for Brian.

783
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:50,370
If they could just slip to the ground
real quick. Amazing for he has,

784
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:55,350
he has a good advantage over
almost everybody at one 45
when it comes to Jujitsu,

785
00:44:55,351 --> 00:44:59,540
like who doesn't have an advantage of when
it comes to Jujitsu at one 45? No one,

786
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:04,600
no one more dangerous than t city swabs
on the ground and he locks on to things.

787
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:09,190
There's a finale to it, that strength in
his, now his belief in himself with it,

788
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:13,320
he knows how dangerous he is. There's a
it and really it's, he's almost, you know,

789
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:17,210
people haven't seen what that
kid's capable of either. Like we,

790
00:45:17,211 --> 00:45:18,180
we seen some cool stuff,

791
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:21,650
but some of his flying triangle is
flying armbars in his, his, his,

792
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,090
his grips and stuff and
his guillotines and his,

793
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:28,610
a lot of cool setups that we haven't
even touched on. So, yeah, he's uh,

794
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,730
one of the most impressive guys I've
ever seen in terms of like when he starts

795
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:36,110
locking something up, you know, it's
over game over like whoa. Came over.

796
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,650
Just super high level.

797
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:42,500
Very interesting because it doesn't have
like world championship, uh, you know,

798
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:46,830
victories in his past, right? No, he
didn't come up through like the IB Jff,

799
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,170
whatever the hell it is. Or he didn't
go to metamorphs anything like that.

800
00:45:49,171 --> 00:45:53,640
He's just this kid that grew up on the
Gracie mats and over time was that kid

801
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:56,370
who was just like, God damn, he's good.
And just kept with it, kept with it,

802
00:45:56,371 --> 00:45:58,850
kept with it.
Now the crazy thing is,

803
00:45:58,851 --> 00:46:01,980
is striking has become
just as deadly fluid.

804
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,700
Crack Frankie Edgar with an elbow
like that and then starch in with that

805
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:10,680
uppercut. That's like, he can do
that to standing now off his feet.

806
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:14,940
Yeah. Yeah. It was, it had to be. So
where's the, where's the picnic picnic?

807
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:18,090
It's not standing. Not Right. And
I helped pull for Max Holloway.

808
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:21,760
He's probably looking at going the picnic
for me standing cause he's so God damn

809
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:23,190
you know good at it.

810
00:46:23,191 --> 00:46:27,990
But you can't just say that's a huge
advantage anymore after you see or take a,

811
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,120
just remember he's knocked out
clay Greta with knees, you know.

812
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,240
Now after you knock out
Frankie Edgar like that,

813
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:36,840
you like least have to acknowledge the
kids can do some standup damage. I think.

814
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:37,260
Yes,

815
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,530
but I think there's a real concern with
if they're going to try to fight in July

816
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:44,040
with Halloween, not having enough
time to recover. I hope I'm wrong,

817
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,250
but when I'm looking at that, when you
just said that it's march and I was like,

818
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:51,090
yeah, it is march isn't it
began in Montreux, may, June,
July. That's four months.

819
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,990
How do they have, how, how he healed
up? Are you after four months,

820
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,560
are you ready to throw kicks and get
your foot checked? Well who knows?

821
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,750
Maybe they also tour, maybe Dana told or
Brian like, hey, we're shooting for Mars.

822
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,030
We're shooting for July summer,
something like that.

823
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,130
But they don't realize where Mac tall,
you know how this goes.

824
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:10,560
Maybe it's on another car.
Maybe I'm wrong though. Maybe.

825
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:14,010
I mean six weeks is what it takes for
bone to heal max a tweet us or something.

826
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:17,850
Be like, yeah, I'm good right now. Bitch.
Google what it takes for a healthy,

827
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,920
what is Max like 28?
No,

828
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:23,280
27th sec on him and Brian
or tell you the same age.

829
00:47:23,281 --> 00:47:24,840
20 couple of young bucks something.
Yeah.

830
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:28,170
And this won't be the last time you see
a brighter taking Max Holloway fight.

831
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:30,040
What's that?
It's 26

832
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:35,080
26, sorry, 27. Um, go to uh,

833
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:36,730
how long does it take?
Just Google.

834
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:41,731
How long does it take for a bone on a 26
year old man to heal and they cut it in

835
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:46,450
half because Max Holloway. Yeah, that's
either you don't have the doctors.

836
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:50,080
She going to be about six months. Well
yes, if I'm a soccer mom, six months.

837
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:53,500
For me it's going to be about three. Thank
you sir. I'm going to push it at three.

838
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,700
You giant pussy.

839
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:58,870
That's also a way to blow out
those ACO reach that top doctors.

840
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:01,690
Are these still all these old people
and like you were out for about a year.

841
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,840
That's true. Three months. Dog Kick
rocks. You know what man, this uh,

842
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,750
tended to engines injury that I got. I
got Golfer's elbow. That really made me,

843
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:14,040
I'm aware there's a difference between
injured a muscle and an injury,

844
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,960
an attendant hundred percent.
They don't have much blood supply man.

845
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:20,440
It's that fucking average in
the Dick to get that to heal.

846
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,620
I'm stunned at how long it takes and how
many different things I've done when,

847
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:27,630
since you told me that I was doing
pull ups in a striver hurting here,

848
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,130
I've stopped doing for a little bit
cause I don't want to just hear,

849
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:30,880
it's just this,

850
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,240
it started hurting in there and that's
when the here and now I'm like, you know,

851
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,510
I'm a chill out on that stuff.

852
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,820
I got a chunk of something
floating around there too.

853
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:39,730
You get like a piece of
hard something or another.

854
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,070
I fell once and Alaska,

855
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:45,760
Collin and I were on this deer hunting
trip and I slipped off the side of a

856
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:48,400
cliff and cracked my elbow in this rock.

857
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:52,510
And it was hurting for months afterwards.
Like every time I would do a chin up,

858
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:56,740
it would hurt and I just sucked it up
and I think I might have chipped a piece

859
00:48:56,741 --> 00:48:57,970
of bone off in there.

860
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:01,630
I think there's something floating or
it's a piece of calcium that's built up

861
00:49:01,631 --> 00:49:06,220
because of, uh, irritation that can
happen. But it ride, Bro. Yeah, Bro.

862
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:10,600
You got this man bro. Science dude.
Speaking of people getting fucked up.

863
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:13,900
How about that girl side work?
But she looks good.

864
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:17,290
When she got hit with the first
one, her eyes were like, oh my God.

865
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:21,510
And God bless her man. Because your
first fight in UFC, hey go this.

866
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,210
This is what you always wanted.
Here's Cyborg main event.
Short notice. Enjoy that.

867
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,430
Yeah, that's kind of a
crazy thing to do, right?

868
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:31,410
Title shot your first fight ever in the
UFC title shot the first fight ever.

869
00:49:31,411 --> 00:49:34,970
And nobody knows. Literally nobody in
the UFC knows who you are. You'll see it.

870
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:39,660
Even have a picture up of her till the
week of the fight. You've never, uh,

871
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:43,270
I mean she got submitted by Tanya
evenger. It's tough. She submitted,

872
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:48,010
Tanya and Tanya submitted her and we
know that she's a one 30 Fiverr. Yeah,

873
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:52,420
that's her like wincing in pain as Cyborg
lowers the boom CyBorD down though.

874
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,680
She did that weird. Yeah. Well
that was obviously the strategy.

875
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:58,480
The strategy was to close the distance,

876
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:02,620
get that clinch drag side work to
the ground. She's a one 35 or man,

877
00:50:02,621 --> 00:50:06,190
she really is not big enough,
but for cyber it's like,
what do you want me to do,

878
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:07,990
man?
Like there's no one in the division.

879
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,250
What is stopping that Megan Anderson
check from coming over her work visa.

880
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,820
She shows here she was here
illegally or something like that. No,

881
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:20,230
that was the hold up there.
Oh, some bullshit lawyers
cause on the, I know, man,

882
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:24,790
let's go. Cause she, she's
a legit, you know, big girl.

883
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:29,300
Pretty Australian fight. Her
ass all tattooed up. She's
actually the one, you know,

884
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:34,040
she's in the same weight class
and she wants to fight.

885
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:36,050
Cat Zingano wanted the fight too.

886
00:50:36,051 --> 00:50:39,380
She's talking all that shit for real
one called Trump. I can't get it done.

887
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,950
God wants to fight. We'll cat
Zingano did what? The cyborg fight.

888
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:46,550
But since she lost that last one,
beer Catlin split decision.

889
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:49,540
You Ain't getting sideways not
sniffing. No, no, no, no, no, no.

890
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:52,190
There's no way she's going to
have to get a couple of it.

891
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:57,180
Cause she lost her last one too. She
took Julianna Pena. Yeah. And she, she,

892
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,123
she's taken too much.

893
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,860
You could see the ring rust was there
and the nerves are there. She just, she,

894
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,150
she needs time. She has time. She
can compete there with Cyborg. I,

895
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,780
I'm trying to be funny here. She's not
going to lose to single woman. You need,

896
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,660
she needs to fight to women or
that needs to be a dude in there.

897
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:15,260
But one girl's not going to beat her. I
hate to tell you guys like it's just not,

898
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:17,180
I don't know how you're
going to market that.

899
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:19,280
You're telling me you
wouldn't watch her cm punk.

900
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:24,140
Well I think you put her as co main event
a lot on some cards that have a lot of

901
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:28,570
great fights. I just think that
people are always going to give,

902
00:51:28,571 --> 00:51:30,950
willing to watch whoever
steps in and fights are,

903
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,650
but to have her be the
center of a giant event,

904
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:37,460
I think it's going to take a
real challenger like Holly.
Those ratings were good.

905
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:40,430
Yeah, that was a good fight because that
was a fight where people are like, hmm,

906
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,380
Holly, you know, is legit.

907
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:47,120
Like real skillful box shows you how good
the decision. Although she, you know,

908
00:51:47,121 --> 00:51:50,270
Holly was never really winning that
fudge, but maybe once a month shot. Yeah,

909
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:53,060
she got lit up. You realize when
you're in there fighting Cyborg,

910
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:54,730
it's totally different proposition.
You know when you,

911
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,360
when you see cyber you're just like,
oh man,

912
00:51:56,361 --> 00:51:58,900
she's never going to
lose until father time,

913
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:02,180
I guess touches around the
shoulder right now she's only 32

914
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,360
crazy. It's not young, but it's not
old either. No, she's not at all.

915
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:11,060
She prime [inaudible] for another
five years. Easy. When you know,

916
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,530
you think about how
long she's been around,

917
00:52:12,531 --> 00:52:17,180
like way back to the Geno Carano
find. How old was she then? Jesus man,

918
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:20,090
super young. Super Young. She's
been doing it for a minute.

919
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,030
Did you ever watch that fight again?
It's not bad fight.

920
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:26,500
People don't give enough credit. No.
Gina mounted or at one point in time to,

921
00:52:26,501 --> 00:52:29,750
you know, first team all diabetes captain.
The team. Yeah, it was pretty hot.

922
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,850
But out of respect and Kevin Ross,

923
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:36,270
this will be the end of this conversation
when it comes to how hot is that a man?

924
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:40,640
What's he do? Kevin Ross.
Muy Thai fighter. Oh yeah.
With all, he's all tatted up.

925
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:43,430
They're still together? Yeah.
Good for them. Good for them.

926
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,670
Hopefully she'll hear it
cause the fight. Yeah, she's,

927
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,680
she's got to be very cool
because he's very cool.

928
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,830
They're this the beginning of fine.
She's just teeing off on June.

929
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:55,670
She takes her down and fucks up
and Gino ones up on top of her.

930
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:58,960
Look at Gina doing where people
forget how good that girl was. Men,

931
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:01,220
how she's very good.
Look at the Cyborg.

932
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,310
You should give her royalties were
starting women's MMA. Let's be real.

933
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:09,050
Halfassed heel hook here are half decent
heel hook here. She's an attorney.

934
00:53:09,051 --> 00:53:12,890
Get out of it. Actually popped
out yet. Gina. Cronk. I mean,

935
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:16,250
she just think out big Gina Crown would
be if she was in the sport right now,

936
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,080
Jesus sidebars hit or want some hammers.
This was a,

937
00:53:21,081 --> 00:53:23,030
yeah, she would be gigantic. She'd be so,

938
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:28,040
because she was Zanup when the
UFC was really in its infancy.

939
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:31,470
She's big on showtime.
What year do you think his fight was?

940
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:36,860
If you had to get 20004692000
nine really nine wow.

941
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,900
Cyborg vicious kicks to the body.
So cyber was only like, what,

942
00:53:42,901 --> 00:53:47,610
22 ish or take down your shot again and
this time Gina amounts or look at that

943
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:50,980
like people forget genus. Getting
them out because sideboards mistakes,

944
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,950
but still mal.
Yeah.

945
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,160
This the most troubling you've ever seen
Cyborg in besides that Moy Thai fight

946
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:00,330
and gene's going to let her up.
No, Gino was an absolute monster.

947
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:04,770
People forget man. But with cyber I, I'm
dead serious. I'm even trying to be funny.

948
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,380
Women enter that octagon against her.

949
00:54:07,381 --> 00:54:11,970
She's not going to lose or do you need
to get Khabib up in that bitch? Well,

950
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,380
she obviously has some
physical attributes. Now,

951
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:20,330
when you think about the rest of the
women at one 45, no one stands out.

952
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,190
What they're gonna do as Amanda
Nunez. That's the fight. Yeah,

953
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,170
I may have missed wants it.
Cyborg wants it.

954
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:31,340
I liked to fight and I think technically
Amanda Nunez is better as far as a

955
00:54:31,531 --> 00:54:35,670
technician as Cyborg. However,
for let's say that's five rounds,

956
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:38,930
even three rounds over those
three rounds, she, she,

957
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:42,810
I don't think she possesses the same
power as Cyborg. You know what I'm saying?

958
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,080
They'd be Cyborg kits. A girl,
you see it on their face.

959
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:49,440
The stoppage of Gina Carano we're
watching on the big screen. It's horrific.

960
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:50,630
It's tough one.

961
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:54,390
And it's horrific when she gets her down
like the hammers that she drops on her

962
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:58,760
of a Cyborg Fan. I'm more of cyber fan
now. Back then I was first team all Gina.

963
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:06,210
No one wanted that. No one wanted that.
Did she tests positive for this fight?

964
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,020
Uh, no. I thought it was after this
another five that was in this fight.

965
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,250
That'd be way bigger than news. But,
um, cyborg. Amanda A. Good fight.

966
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,640
That's a really good,
I just in how I'm a huge Amanda Nunez Fan.

967
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:21,270
I just think over that time she's
going to land some shots on sidewalks.

968
00:55:21,271 --> 00:55:23,680
I won't get hit, but when
cyborg kitchen, it's,

969
00:55:23,681 --> 00:55:25,950
it's just he can't play
that game with her. There's,

970
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:28,230
there's no female in the world.
He can play that game with her.

971
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:32,940
You give me one off lake when you hear,
you hear, it just doesn't work. Dude.

972
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,330
Who knows? Man, that's interesting.
It's a great fight though.

973
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:40,860
Amanda's got legit one punch power,
legit smack him up.

974
00:55:40,861 --> 00:55:45,390
Power real black belt in Jujitsu. Very
good at fighting. Knows how to fight.

975
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,490
Phenomenal fighter. Yeah.
She knows how to fight.

976
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:50,160
Forget about all the things that she
can do. She puts it together. Well,

977
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,040
you know who can fight
Cyborg. Cyborg. Yup.

978
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:55,920
She's the greatest female fighter
of all time. It's hard to argue.

979
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:59,850
It's hard to argue, right? Yeah. It's
hard to argue. Did some caveats in there,

980
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:03,690
obviously, but it's hard to
argue evenly. Yeah. Yeah.

981
00:56:03,691 --> 00:56:05,580
There's some caveats I guess
really to go down that road.

982
00:56:05,581 --> 00:56:09,300
But still in the UFC with the Usada
testing, she's still the best.

983
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:10,920
So that kind of takes out of the window.

984
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,590
We'll choose the best back then
and she tends to as hot. Cool.

985
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:16,920
Now she's in the strict thing,
the most strict testing pool of all time.

986
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,590
She's still dominating. So where's
your argument there now? Well,

987
00:56:19,591 --> 00:56:24,010
you know the argument that she
retained all the shit from when she was

988
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,990
taking it back in the day,
retain something.

989
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:30,580
I'm not everything though as
Hector Lombard to question
ask Vic doorbell. Right.

990
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:35,020
That's true. But the, those are men.
It's different. The idea of, you know,

991
00:56:35,021 --> 00:56:39,820
a guy taking shit or a girl taking it,
don't you think they're different? It's,

992
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:42,880
it's different, but it's also, it's
different. There's argument there,

993
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:47,220
but it's not different to the point where
after tea was that 2009 you sentences.

994
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:51,790
So after nine years she's still retaining
this muscle mass and she was born a

995
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:53,980
bigger female. That's
true too. That's true too.

996
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:58,120
Like no matter what Gabby Garcia did, she
still six four, correct? She'll giant.

997
00:56:58,121 --> 00:57:02,830
Did. She was at the UFC. I was like Ho
Lee. Shit. You're scared. Terrifying.

998
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,990
Should way too vague for terrified all
of them. She's so big. Do you see she,

999
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,830
she wasn't sitting like a lady.

1000
00:57:08,831 --> 00:57:11,830
So it's security to come behind you
and DC and stuff in front of her.

1001
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:16,090
She can't sit like a lady.
She's got long legs. She might,

1002
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,270
they know when to ask though.
Cause she's crossing those legs bro.

1003
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:23,500
I just too much done this.
So they're so big. Yeah.

1004
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:27,100
So have you have like
one of them super tank,

1005
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:31,120
crossfit squat girls, those giant
legs, the blonde ass and the quads.

1006
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,620
Can they even cross their legs? I'm sure.
How could they cross cross your legs?

1007
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:39,700
Yes. Yes. Legs. I cross. My legs
is comfortable and I get along.

1008
00:57:39,701 --> 00:57:40,880
I got to tear it back.
They'll date.

1009
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,670
I don't think doc is a big decks.
You Might wanna change that one up.

1010
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:50,500
But the Burger, they have tails.
Do they, I don't know bird there.

1011
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:53,380
Our bird. They're not a dinosaur.
Well they're not a dinosaur. Yeah.

1012
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:57,130
Did you know that? They're in a class
of themselves was telling me that.

1013
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,750
My Kid told me that. Oh,
that's right. Seven year old.
See this this way right here.

1014
00:58:01,751 --> 00:58:06,490
This is uncomfortable. It's
fonts. So comfy or nut cruncher
us. I'm so comfortable.

1015
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,940
Yeah, but you got an extra foot of
leg. Yeah, there's a lot of room here,

1016
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,090
but with get with Gabby Garcia.
Remember when she was like,

1017
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:18,070
like big bloated girl and she got shreds.
Shreds city for patrol. Oh, totally.

1018
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,940
Misread city. And then she backed the
in between. She's back to giant again,

1019
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:26,050
I think. Why not try and cut the
45 what are you talking about?

1020
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:31,060
Who? She's six 80 do you know? She's
six. Four I'm in the UFC or not

1021
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,480
[inaudible] 70 to make it. She's good
friends with Cyborg to look how big. Okay.

1022
00:58:38,810 --> 00:58:43,000
She was when she got some all and
helping. She is now two. Shit's hot.

1023
00:58:43,001 --> 00:58:46,300
When she was small, she wasn't
bad. Callan. That's what I saw.

1024
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:49,420
That's what I saw in the
air. Like look at that. Oh,

1025
00:58:49,421 --> 00:58:51,430
that's when she was on the
ultimate fighter with Vandelay.

1026
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,730
I wonder where she's at mentally
when she sees her stuff.

1027
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,790
Like does she date that? Cause a lot of
dudes are into that. She can't go online.

1028
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:02,290
Like I like I had a friend
who's a female bodybuilder.

1029
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:07,120
Dick Thicker than a snicker is definitely
deca. Gold's gym, just interacting,

1030
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:10,930
get just protein powder
seeping out of a goddamn eyes.

1031
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:15,280
Get that pink one above it to the right
above, above and to the right. Okay.

1032
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:18,760
That's not mad at all. Not Mad at
it at all. So at one point in time,

1033
00:59:18,761 --> 00:59:22,250
in the recent future,
she got down to the body of a really

1034
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,410
hot crossfit.
How much did she weigh there though?

1035
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,740
She's probably still a thousand pounds.
Six foot four main bro.

1036
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:32,700
She I what do you think? What?
60 there? No, I bet she's there.

1037
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:37,430
She's 200 bro. She's not 200 accounts
there. I bet she's 200 don't you Jamie?

1038
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:42,290
Jamie. She's 64 come on bro.

1039
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:46,700
Okay. Maybe she's one 95 but I'm not going
any lower than that. That's a big girl.

1040
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,270
She is.
She's a legit six floor.

1041
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:53,480
Pretty sure Pinal how tall she is.
She's stronger than me.

1042
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:57,410
That's whatever. But there's some
dudes that there's a market for that.

1043
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,880
I got a friend who was a bodybuilding,

1044
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:03,860
she was busy cause she would do some
little bit strange for some change and get

1045
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:06,950
oil down. She's always
takes two. I'm sorry,

1046
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:10,280
two 36 six two we can make one 45

1047
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:15,830
she's going to lose a hundred pounds.
Nobody. Real jobs going say why I got you.

1048
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:16,550
What would,

1049
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:19,610
what do you think would happen if she
just got completely off of everything and

1050
01:00:19,611 --> 01:00:22,310
just ran marathons?
What do you think she'd get down to?

1051
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:27,340
I don't think she lowered to 36 to two
36 look at the fucking size of her.

1052
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:32,150
Probably one 17 Jesus Christ. Look at
that girl. I'm going to death, right? No,

1053
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:35,330
this poor girl. Good to see.
Did you see her beat up though?

1054
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:37,820
Do you see a beat up the
grandma? Yes. With a knee brace.

1055
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:42,310
He beat up a grandma and a knee brace,
bro. So wrong struggle city. I hear,

1056
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:46,220
here's her like, first of
all, she's really good at
Jujitsu by the way. Phenomenal,

1057
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:50,990
right? Mackenzie during her matches. Yeah.
Mckenzie beat her on points. How crazy.

1058
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:54,740
That's how bad ass Mckenzie dearness.
She poked his chick apparently,

1059
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:58,040
and they found that checkout fake.
Like, I get poke too. Yeah, good move.

1060
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,560
I'd fall down.
I'd black out how she's rushing though.

1061
01:01:00,561 --> 01:01:03,170
They can't and she'll get murdered.
She gets back to really get in there.

1062
01:01:03,171 --> 01:01:04,004
Someone's got a bet.

1063
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:08,990
I have bit to make it to one minute
survive any way you can for fun. We need,

1064
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:14,500
dude, I just boom. How do they not
have her fight? Dude's like, oh,

1065
01:01:14,501 --> 01:01:18,920
that's it. Oh good move for
her. No more. It can go.

1066
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:24,100
The fight has gone one minute that my
obligation is over here to think about her

1067
01:01:24,201 --> 01:01:27,830
research. Cyborg, perverse,
Cyborg, Cyborg, or fuck her up.

1068
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:30,310
Jeff Novitsky cycle hike
for a couple of weeks.

1069
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:32,030
So much better standing up than her.

1070
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:34,880
She would have to take cyborg
down and cyborg would fuck her up.

1071
01:01:34,881 --> 01:01:39,881
So when she went to watch that now really
for obvious reasons that we can't talk

1072
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:44,090
about. Look at that. There she
is right there. Palm Palm Palm,

1073
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:47,270
but legit black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu.

1074
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:50,000
You can say whatever you want about it,
but the girl works her ass,

1075
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:53,900
her ass off no matter what.
No matter what you take,

1076
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,700
you don't get that big
unless you're training hard.

1077
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:00,560
She's just dropping bombs in this check.
Her striking has gotten a lot better,

1078
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:05,090
lot more smooth and relaxed. Like she was
having a hard time when she first got,

1079
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:05,993
Ooh,

1080
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:11,370
Jesus shared tagged that Leah to
Tapa is doing work. She would say,

1081
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:17,300
oh, she got attacked again.
Damn. Her striking is terrible.

1082
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:20,220
Well, she's hurt. She's
hurt. She's well, but this

1083
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,600
is what got me. Joe, look at this chick's
going, come on, come on. Come on Sarah.

1084
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:27,070
Come to center. Damn. She's like, bring
it. She'd get a little emotional though.

1085
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:31,200
That rise in just free for all
and I shade it. So gangster,

1086
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:34,890
they're so gangster. They're trying
to bring back the golden days.

1087
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,070
I now you know what that day is over.
So kind of give it a rest,

1088
01:02:38,071 --> 01:02:41,480
but I like what they're doing. You
see belt or brought cro, cop back.

1089
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,900
The Cro cop Roy. I just don't tell. We've
seen that just on test. Anybody please.

1090
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,570
I just couldn't, I don't know.
Don't know. Don't just stop testing.

1091
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:53,490
I'll say with the John Jones thing against
Brock Lesnar. Hey Jeff. Novitsky let's,

1092
01:02:53,491 --> 01:02:55,740
uh, go grab a cup of coffee
while these boys rumble. Huh?

1093
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:00,390
Do we Levine while we
go? Why don't you go, go,

1094
01:03:00,391 --> 01:03:03,450
go on vacation to Hawaii while John
and Brock take a little a tripper.

1095
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,920
The UFC is clean,

1096
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,530
but it doesn't have to be UFC.

1097
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:12,900
UFC decided to go down that you sought
a road and they've committed to it.

1098
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:16,590
It's changed the game legitimately
for sure. Let's be honest,

1099
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:20,040
when you've been fucking life,
I've got a legend like cro cop.

1100
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:23,090
He still wants a fight.
Excuse me.

1101
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:27,180
That'll help if a hundred or so up mom,
that's real.

1102
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:31,230
I'm not saying he needs it. I'm not,
I'm not, it's not a knock on him.

1103
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:36,350
He's upset at me because a bas Rutten
was saying that during one of his fights

1104
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:41,460
that uh, they paid him all this money and
they had to bring all this money back,

1105
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:44,880
like bosses explaining at the bottom
into a room and say, boss said it,

1106
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:48,120
but he thinks that I said because it was
on your show. Yeah, it was on my show.

1107
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:51,270
I didn't know what my boss was going to
say and if I heard anything about it,

1108
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:55,770
I heard it from boss cause boss worked
there and bosses just fucking hilarious.

1109
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:58,560
And he's telling me about how
they would pay those guys in cash.

1110
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:01,470
Well he doesn't like you.
He likes me and I punched him in the face.

1111
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:03,480
So me and him are friends,

1112
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:09,090
but I just want him to know I'm
a big Fan Heli Pad for Cro cop.

1113
01:04:09,091 --> 01:04:10,650
I always enjoyed watching
him and he's the,

1114
01:04:10,651 --> 01:04:15,000
the example that I always use of what
happens when you get an explosive striker

1115
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:16,710
versus a technical striker in MMA.

1116
01:04:16,711 --> 01:04:20,400
I think when you get a high level
striker that's used to a certain style of

1117
01:04:20,401 --> 01:04:24,300
fighting and then they fight
an MMA, sometimes that style
doesn't translate over.

1118
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:27,810
Like I don't think Peter Arts would
have done that good as an MMA fighter.

1119
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:31,890
I don't think Ernesto hoost would have
done that good because they would have to

1120
01:04:31,891 --> 01:04:35,430
have changed the way they strike because
there are so technical and it really

1121
01:04:35,431 --> 01:04:37,530
fun to watch fight and
they would bra for sure.

1122
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,870
But what Merkel would do was
have these big one shots,

1123
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,630
these big one kicks,
he's big one punches,

1124
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,080
just jump in with one
shot super fast and quick.

1125
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:54,560
That is really beneficial in MMA more
so even than kickboxing because it's the

1126
01:04:54,931 --> 01:04:58,470
volume the he's fighting guys who are,
um,

1127
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,450
it at the time were,

1128
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:03,510
they were concerned about take downs.

1129
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,030
You concerned about all these different
things that could possibly happen in an

1130
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:07,020
MMA fight.
Right.

1131
01:05:07,350 --> 01:05:11,070
So no one stands the way they stand
in kickboxing when they're standing in

1132
01:05:11,071 --> 01:05:14,610
kickboxing there more sideways,
they're more light on their feet.

1133
01:05:14,611 --> 01:05:17,100
They're moving around cause they don't
have to worry about being taken down.

1134
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:20,140
It's a totally different proposition.
It's also a dance in a rhythm. Yeah.

1135
01:05:20,141 --> 01:05:23,620
So guy like host. Yeah, guy like
who's would just pick you apart,

1136
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:25,420
start leg kick and you chopping down.

1137
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:30,400
If he's got to think about takedowns even
really great strikers are susceptible

1138
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:33,790
to one pot shots in MMA because there's
so many more things you're thinking of.

1139
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:37,540
That's why Kevin random and crack cro
cop and knocked them out of their fight

1140
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,730
because he's got to
worry about the takedown.

1141
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,240
Like if they were just in a kickboxing
fight. Kevin Randleman and Cro cop,

1142
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:45,130
Justin Kay,
one nightmare.

1143
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:50,220
It's a nightmare for Kevin about
Wonderboy Woodley Wonderboy all day.

1144
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,590
They going to kickboxing match all day.
Wonderboy light him up,

1145
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:57,580
Woodley that one shot power and
he dropped, you know one a boy,

1146
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:02,720
you know before I say that
even in kickboxing Woodley
I think would do very well

1147
01:06:02,861 --> 01:06:06,670
because he's so powerful and, and
you'd be able to manage it more though.

1148
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:09,280
You be to gloves so you catch more.

1149
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:14,380
And also his punches aren't as dangerous.
So when he's hitting you,

1150
01:06:14,381 --> 01:06:17,470
it's not as dangerous. You can
catch the kicks a little bit better.

1151
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:21,480
It's still not fun. Hell, no wonder
boys. Octagon is a nightmare.

1152
01:06:21,481 --> 01:06:25,350
We're not one shot power.
Yeah. Those little gloves got
hopefully fight soon, man.

1153
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:29,770
He's going to, he's a, he had shoulder
surgery at a torn labrum, so he's,

1154
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,110
he's pounding on that,
trying to get that fixed up.

1155
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:34,240
He dos Anjos that's what
they're going to do.

1156
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,880
Maybe they'll do that
international fight week to dawn.

1157
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,940
Dawn Sizzla,

1158
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,280
which I can get these
ratings up for Fox buys.

1159
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:47,910
WWU imagine if Brock's first fight
back as John Jones. Yeah, I can. Yeah,

1160
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:52,150
I can see what I'm just a car. Don't
look all the fucker. It's not July. Yes.

1161
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:56,770
Yes.
Steep a DC Granshawn Jones.

1162
01:06:56,950 --> 01:07:01,870
Brock preach, Tyron Woodley.
Dosen Joe's or Tayga.

1163
01:07:02,170 --> 01:07:04,720
Max Holloway. Amanda Nunez. Cyborg.

1164
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:08,970
We bust in this load on
this one card you can get.

1165
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:14,910
We can still do. The ratings did
that. That place would be insane.

1166
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,860
That'd be insane. That'd be one of
the greatest cards of all talkers.

1167
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:21,520
And then on top you sprinkle
in the swingle cm punk.

1168
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:27,970
You wouldn't be able to do that one. Why?
Because that one needs so much money.

1169
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:33,220
The one that I'm thinking about, which
one? You know the one, which one? Joe?

1170
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:36,520
The one that was a lot of sprinkles on
top, which was, you know that boxer guy,

1171
01:07:36,521 --> 01:07:40,540
what's his name? Are you talking about
Floyd money that we keep talking about?

1172
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,730
If that happened? This is, by the way,

1173
01:07:42,731 --> 01:07:45,700
I believe you and I were the first
speculate. That's publicly correct.

1174
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:48,910
I think that's the fight. I think
that's the fight to make. I agree.

1175
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:50,950
I don't know if it'll ever happen,
but I think it, if it does happen,

1176
01:07:50,951 --> 01:07:54,040
it happens on its own individual card.
You put a kickass card underneath it,

1177
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:58,200
but I don't know if you put like a UFC
200 size kickass Carter anything. No.

1178
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:00,790
Cause Floyd and cm punk skin cell.

1179
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:04,570
And also if you're Floyd just
lean up from Floyd's perspective.

1180
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,130
I pay me this much money,

1181
01:08:06,131 --> 01:08:10,780
which I boatload of cash and also give
me the guy who has zero experience like

1182
01:08:10,781 --> 01:08:14,530
me and cm punk comes with a huge name,
so it makes sense.

1183
01:08:14,860 --> 01:08:18,600
It's the only fight to make for Floyd
cause condo literally kill them. Yeah,

1184
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:21,260
you can't do that. It wouldn't
be fair. It's not fair.

1185
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:23,840
[inaudible] light up Floyd
into bunk in the same night.

1186
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:26,750
People would understand the difference
between Connor Boxing Floyd,

1187
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:31,530
which you've got clearly outclassed,
but he hit him like, Floyd's,

1188
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:34,760
I can do anything. No, it's
no competition. It doesn't.
It's going to be awful.

1189
01:08:34,761 --> 01:08:38,900
It doesn't make sense. Make sense? He'll
get kicked once in the legs and be like,

1190
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:42,770
oh my God, now I can't walk. And then he
gets kicked in the same spot. I'm like,

1191
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:46,400
oh Jesus Christ. And his folding over
and he's getting front kicked in the gut.

1192
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,520
Connor's talking shit to him.
Get head kicked.

1193
01:08:48,521 --> 01:08:52,010
The bishop and then you're
on that highlight reel and
the UFC is using that over

1194
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,830
loop over and over.
And then it takes one clinch.

1195
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:57,200
Just one clench and
you're on on your back.

1196
01:08:57,230 --> 01:09:00,590
If your cm punk than her fighting Floyd,
I'm army crawling over flooded.

1197
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:03,500
You're not even go ahead and punch me,
but say Stan karate style.

1198
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:07,260
He stand karate style and you throw
sidekicks and you just walk towards him

1199
01:09:07,261 --> 01:09:10,250
throwing sidekicks. There's
so many just to the cage. Yes.

1200
01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:11,930
Why would you even want to box him?

1201
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:15,800
He stand total Wonderboy side
stance to stand like this,

1202
01:09:15,801 --> 01:09:18,610
way back Liotta Machida style
and just throw sidekicks,

1203
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:21,650
keep them off you and then when
the move is, whenever it happens,

1204
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:24,500
get that clinch it rock
fucking everything.

1205
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:28,740
The guy weighs 145 legitimate pounds.
That's what Floyd ways.

1206
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:32,780
Even just bear hug him and just pull
them on top of me and sweep them and get

1207
01:09:32,781 --> 01:09:35,360
full amount. I would literally
just come at Floyd like this.

1208
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:37,640
Just walked straight
forward like the terminator.

1209
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:41,480
Floyd can make it a welterweight. He could
make welterweight and boxing. He could.

1210
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:44,890
That's the only problem with this fight
that we're speculating is 20 pounds of

1211
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:48,020
weight. Are they going to fight it?
Cause see a punks nuts wall? No,

1212
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:53,180
he was a legit sized one 70 so he
would go and catch weight here.

1213
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:55,970
You'd have to be catch weight
60 see that's the other thing.

1214
01:09:55,980 --> 01:10:00,860
You Drain cm punk down to one 60 and
he's Foxville. Yeah, let's do that. Yeah.

1215
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,630
Well,
well here's the thing.

1216
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:07,010
It at one 70 he doesn't
have a lot of muscle,

1217
01:10:07,011 --> 01:10:09,280
but he's got a little bit
of fat so maybe can do,

1218
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:12,950
he might be able to do 65 he
does it smart and long, you know,

1219
01:10:12,951 --> 01:10:17,300
he takes a long time to do it. Adjust
as calories, really ramps up as cardio.

1220
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:20,660
Just forces himself to do an hour of
cardio after every training session.

1221
01:10:20,661 --> 01:10:23,080
Has anyone seen him lately?
Other man looked in thinner? No.

1222
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:26,780
It's going to have to look a lot thinner
to get that fight or Floyd's. He says,

1223
01:10:26,781 --> 01:10:30,050
I don't give a fuck. I'm going to light
this dude up. Cause when they're standing,

1224
01:10:30,051 --> 01:10:33,020
when? When he's got to close
the distance on cm pie,

1225
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:36,350
Floyd has four ounce gloves on.
Are you fucking kidding me?

1226
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:38,900
And he's impossible to hit. He's in
pot. You're not going to hit them.

1227
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:43,100
That's not happened to catch coming in
and it's gonna beat fucking night night.

1228
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:47,240
Even the leg kicks like, boy,
can you even kick his legs?

1229
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,970
How fast the CM punk kick.
You know what I mean?

1230
01:10:49,971 --> 01:10:53,210
We're not talking about like yachts and
Clyde. That's not the move for cm punk,

1231
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:57,050
sir. Just do what you gotta do to get to
the ground. We have a karate background.

1232
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,360
Cm punk. Yes. Much as a, I have a crowded

1233
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:04,820
and I'm not making fun of ill of him
when he was like 13 or some shit and I

1234
01:11:04,821 --> 01:11:07,630
guess does it count?
I play dodge ball to when the band,

1235
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:11,300
I had a resume not on my resume.
Doesn't count. Soccer player.

1236
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:13,980
I'm going to put that on my fucking
soccer players. My Twitter handle

1237
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,970
now I play. That doesn't
count man. Play it. Yeah,

1238
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:23,820
we were hit so heartbroken man. You're
right. Jesus. I don't want to throw it.

1239
01:11:25,170 --> 01:11:29,550
It's that cold brew. This new Cobra
was snacking on. God Damn. Jamie,

1240
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:32,190
what were you showing me right
before the podcast started?

1241
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:36,430
About some dude who just retired
because he had a brain injury. Oh yeah,

1242
01:11:36,431 --> 01:11:38,110
there's a,
an NFL running back.

1243
01:11:38,111 --> 01:11:39,790
It was just seeing the story so
I don't know too much about it,

1244
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:43,210
but I know who he is. His name is beanie
wells. He was a running back in the NFL.

1245
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:47,710
Um, he had an MRI and
it's showing brain injury,

1246
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:51,400
so he's starting his already publicly
stating he's having problems with that.

1247
01:11:51,401 --> 01:11:55,520
He was having memory loss,
speech problems. How old is
this gentleman? 29 I think.

1248
01:11:56,240 --> 01:12:01,010
Oh Man.
Yeah man.

1249
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,290
He's already going under
treatment right now, so like he's,

1250
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:07,890
he would be one of the first people
I've heard of that is already getting

1251
01:12:07,891 --> 01:12:12,180
treatment for what I guess they can tell
now about potential, so what do they do?

1252
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:15,030
How do, how are they treating
it? There he is handsome fellow,

1253
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:18,660
former cardinals are be beanie wells
dealing with traumatic brain injury,

1254
01:12:18,661 --> 01:12:20,640
so they know for a fact that he has it,

1255
01:12:20,641 --> 01:12:24,630
so he must be one of the recipients of
one of the newer tests that allows them

1256
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:27,660
to see while the person's
alive because it used to be,

1257
01:12:27,661 --> 01:12:30,960
they used to have to do an autopsy autopsy
to find out what's wrong with what's

1258
01:12:30,961 --> 01:12:32,550
wrong with your brain.
There's this quote,

1259
01:12:32,551 --> 01:12:35,530
he says he has plot some
plaques separation [inaudible].

1260
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:39,300
It shows that you've experienced some sort
of Tbi and says when you have plaques.

1261
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:42,660
Yeah. Separation shows you've
experienced some traumatic brain injury?

1262
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:46,070
Obviously that traumatic injury for
me would come from playing football.

1263
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:46,943
Not only that,

1264
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:52,070
they had some cells tacked on to that
separated plaque that I needed to get

1265
01:12:52,741 --> 01:12:56,530
under control. What does that mean?
You think? I mean, extra cells.

1266
01:12:56,531 --> 01:12:59,290
I only know as being bad cancer,
cancer type stuff. Right.

1267
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:04,570
Still on out of the woods yet, but I'm
hopeful. Wow. Well, at least he sees it.

1268
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:09,430
Right. You know, and he, he got ahold
of it. Now, when did he stop playing?

1269
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:13,230
Uh, pretty recently. And he
would also be in Columbus,

1270
01:13:13,231 --> 01:13:15,420
which would be at Ohio
state where they have the,

1271
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:16,890
not only like the James Cancer plays,

1272
01:13:16,891 --> 01:13:20,890
but I think they're doing the tests are
some of the early tests on this. Oh,

1273
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:24,170
remember correctly? You even told me it
was at Ohio state. Maybe not. I don't,

1274
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:28,390
I don't know. I talk too much. I forget
some of the Shit I say. I really do.

1275
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:33,010
I've realized that, um, when
someone asked me what podcast,

1276
01:13:33,011 --> 01:13:36,970
I'm Eric Weinstein and,
uh, Heather hying we're on,

1277
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:41,410
and I had to think about it,
it's like 1080. [inaudible]
and I thought about, look,

1278
01:13:41,411 --> 01:13:45,010
how the fuck could I ever remember
what I said, if they were all one hour

1279
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:51,300
a thousand different conversations
plus fight companions or this is,

1280
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:53,030
I think it is Ohio state.
There's a thing,

1281
01:13:53,031 --> 01:13:57,210
and this is on their medical Wexner
center medical website. They have, uh,

1282
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:00,710
advanced imaging and neuro sensitive
care and Rehab services. Right?

1283
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:03,750
We're talking brain trauma. Yeah. We're
talking about that football player that,

1284
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:07,920
um, just got tested. He had
plaque separation and his brain.

1285
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:11,500
How long did he play for Jamie?
Uh,

1286
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:16,050
so probably about seven years
I think in the NFL. He's off.

1287
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:18,540
See the exception though, you know,
there's obviously a prom, but he's,

1288
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:23,110
he's definitely the exception. I wonder,
you know, mom's around for so long,

1289
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:26,980
it's been around for so long. I think a
lot of people just live with it, you know,

1290
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:28,480
and did the thing is um,

1291
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:33,870
what does that apo a three apo e three
something that Rhonda Patrick was talking

1292
01:14:35,381 --> 01:14:39,820
about like a, it was a gene, like
somehow the way it expresses itself.

1293
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,810
Um, I know I'm butchering this for
the science people going crazy,

1294
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:45,020
but science people,

1295
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:49,930
it's more likely that you would get a
traumatic brain injury if you have it or

1296
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:52,540
you do not have is actually tests
for the timers. Disease. Yeah.

1297
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:54,350
Early onset Alzheimer's.
Yeah.

1298
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:58,720
There's a test you can take to see if
you're more susceptible to us CT than

1299
01:14:58,721 --> 01:14:59,620
others. Yeah. Here it is.

1300
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:04,621
It says there are three types of apo e
genes called Ailes allows apo e two e

1301
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:07,870
three e three and e four.

1302
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:11,900
Everyone has two copies of the gene in
the combination that terms your apo geno

1303
01:15:11,901 --> 01:15:16,600
type. Um, the [inaudible]
Lal, I hope not. Fuck that up.

1304
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:19,120
Probably am fucking hell.

1305
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:24,121
L E l e right is the rarest form the APO
e and carrying some one copy appears to

1306
01:15:24,461 --> 01:15:28,180
reduce the risk of developing
Alzheimer's by up to 40%. Whoa.

1307
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:32,950
Apo e three is the most common Lao
and doesn't seem to influence risk.

1308
01:15:32,951 --> 01:15:36,670
The APO e four Lal,
I know I'm fucking that word up.

1309
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:40,930
Someone's screaming at their phone right
now present and approximately 10 to 15%

1310
01:15:40,931 --> 01:15:44,770
of people increases risk for all
timers and lowers the age of onset.

1311
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:48,400
That's what I think they think is
connected to traumatic brain injury.

1312
01:15:48,401 --> 01:15:50,890
I think it was apo e
four whatever gene I got.

1313
01:15:50,891 --> 01:15:53,560
I've been knocked out so many times.
I'm happy as fuck cause that one,

1314
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:57,850
whatever that is, get that one.
It's made me so much happier.

1315
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:00,970
Well aren't you happy though,
because your life is going great.

1316
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,360
Don't you think that's a factor?
I think there's something,

1317
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,760
there's something to be said
for that that people don't look.

1318
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:10,270
Everybody knows that having
good friends in your life,

1319
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,980
having a good relationship,

1320
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:15,610
having a family and having a
career that you're happy with,

1321
01:16:15,611 --> 01:16:16,930
all those things make you feel good.

1322
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,760
It's one of the reasons
why people strive for them.

1323
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:22,270
Don't you think that that has an
impact on overall happiness? I think,

1324
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:26,470
you know with, with football players and
fighters, MMA box or stuff like that.

1325
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:31,240
I think one of the advantages I have is
I found my passion and I'm in pursuing

1326
01:16:31,241 --> 01:16:35,140
that so I don't, you know, it keeps
me happy and it keeps my brain,

1327
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,660
I have to be super creative
so it's keeping me sharp.

1328
01:16:37,661 --> 01:16:41,590
I think a lot of athletes and soldiers
for that matter that they get done with

1329
01:16:41,591 --> 01:16:44,570
this high stress high,
you know,

1330
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,890
rush a job and they get put in
the real world and they can't,

1331
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,160
they can't find their lane
and it's, oh, it's PTSD or oh,

1332
01:16:51,161 --> 01:16:53,950
it's brain trauma at CT now
you're just depressed man.

1333
01:16:53,951 --> 01:16:57,670
Because you went from being the superstore
for doing this high level job to fit

1334
01:16:57,671 --> 01:17:00,730
in with siding out. It's tough. Well,
I don't think it's, no you're not.

1335
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:05,550
I think it's both. It's a factor.
It's a factor, but it's not. It's,

1336
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:10,280
there's a lot of physical factors. 100%
gel. I'm just saying I've around blasts

1337
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:13,430
100% 100% that's a legit issue.
I'm just saying if,

1338
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:18,660
if people are as fortunate as me to go
through this sort of traumatic fighting

1339
01:17:19,071 --> 01:17:23,870
career and then find a passion, your
true passion, you'd be way better off.

1340
01:17:23,871 --> 01:17:26,420
And I have no advice for that.
I don't know what to tell you,

1341
01:17:26,421 --> 01:17:28,850
but if you could find something you're
into, it's definitely gonna help you.

1342
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:32,000
I think for everything in life,
you know, if you were a dentist,

1343
01:17:32,001 --> 01:17:34,670
so you didn't want to be a dentist
anymore and you really wanted to make

1344
01:17:34,671 --> 01:17:38,510
paintings, if you could have, you could
really figure out a way to do that.

1345
01:17:38,511 --> 01:17:41,270
You'd be happier.
Like whatever that thing is.

1346
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:44,630
It's just really hard for
some people to find a thing.

1347
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,650
And that's one of the things that I've
talked to people. They go, I don't,

1348
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:48,740
I don't really know what
I want to do with myself.

1349
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:51,410
And then they asked me for
advice. My man, no one told me.

1350
01:17:51,411 --> 01:17:53,460
It doesn't really work like that.
Like you got to figure that out.

1351
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:57,520
There's literally not a book you can read
and we can talk to that's gonna point

1352
01:17:57,530 --> 01:18:00,290
you in the right direction. Here's
the, here's the best piece of advice.

1353
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:05,240
Take some action, take some action,
do something. If that doesn't work,

1354
01:18:05,241 --> 01:18:08,420
correct it, find something else.
But keep, keep moving, keep moving.

1355
01:18:08,421 --> 01:18:11,360
When you're sitting at home going, what
do I do? That's when it's a problem.

1356
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:14,060
And when you're texting your friends
going, hey, got any advice for me?

1357
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:18,590
My advice to you is don't ask me for
advice. Don't DME, DME for advice.

1358
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:22,280
Shit together. I don't do that to people.
I don't call people up and say, hey man,

1359
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:25,850
which they do. I just do things
correct. Just go do something. Agree.

1360
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:28,340
And it might not be the thing
you might say. Ah, okay,

1361
01:18:28,341 --> 01:18:30,500
well now I know I don't want to do that.
You could try something out.

1362
01:18:30,501 --> 01:18:34,130
Don't be afraid to fuck up though. I fuck
up all the time. You got to got it down.

1363
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:38,240
You've got to take risks. You
got to, people are so scared.

1364
01:18:38,241 --> 01:18:40,130
They want to be in that harbor.
Want to stay safe?

1365
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:44,800
Keep me under the blanket cushions.
Oh that's north.

1366
01:18:44,801 --> 01:18:48,350
Which is weird cause I take risks when
it comes to my family and my friends.

1367
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:52,490
Even with Brian or Tayga. I'm like, don't
do this. Don't do that. I'm super light.

1368
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,580
But with myself, I'm pretty reckless. But
with them I'm like, no, no, no, no. Wait,

1369
01:18:55,581 --> 01:18:59,840
please wait. Just strange. What do
you think is steep, pained and DC?

1370
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:03,980
I think it's literally the greatest
super fight the UFC has ever made.

1371
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,360
I'm so excited for it.

1372
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:09,830
It's an amazing fight when you see a how
well DC handled Volk on olds demeanor

1373
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:12,030
and you see what Steve Bay did to Francis.

1374
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:16,280
It almost like makes sense while
John is out and Brock is busy,

1375
01:19:16,281 --> 01:19:17,900
thrown his piss into a microwave,

1376
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:23,340
he's got that same pump system that
I use out there and my flip day,

1377
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:28,250
he pinches into that thing.
They strain that bitch.

1378
01:19:28,251 --> 01:19:32,860
And the reason why it's a super fight
twos, because how tough is this car,

1379
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:36,040
this fight to break down? Like
if someone's like, I'm positive,

1380
01:19:36,041 --> 01:19:38,630
steep is going to win. You're
like, no, you're not on positive.

1381
01:19:38,631 --> 01:19:41,720
DC is going to take him down. No,
you're not. And the thing is it's like,

1382
01:19:41,721 --> 01:19:43,340
well now dcs, find the heavyweight. Yeah,

1383
01:19:43,341 --> 01:19:45,920
he's undefeated heavyweight and
I'm a fucking fight at heavyweight.

1384
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:47,450
He's actually one of the best of you.
It's well done.

1385
01:19:47,610 --> 01:19:50,780
Imagine if one day we see Novitsky
he's wearing all diamonds and shit.

1386
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:55,910
Just appalling cleanser. That was
what I would do if I was in bed ski.

1387
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:58,730
If with the day Brock
Lesnar gets in the UFC,

1388
01:19:58,731 --> 01:20:03,731
I will show up in a full fur coat with
a giant diamond encrusted cross pimping,

1389
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:07,060
pimping pimp diamonds on every finger,

1390
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:11,130
Gucci sunglasses indoors
and just sit there.

1391
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:15,690
Nobody told me how to dress.
Just sit there like gay. Got.

1392
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,440
We did another one.
It was just sit in his cage side.

1393
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:24,510
Imagine just like, that's the way to do
it. So everybody knows like super obvious.

1394
01:20:24,540 --> 01:20:29,190
If you have to bet on a Joe John Jones,
Brock Lesnar the fights happening. Huh?

1395
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:31,380
Boy I hope so.

1396
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:32,670
Yeah,

1397
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:37,290
I hope so. I if I was Brock, I
wouldn't take that fight. Really?

1398
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:39,420
No.
Get a fight under your belt first.

1399
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:42,770
We don't have time for that bullshit.

1400
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:47,400
There's don't warm up as
Brock Lesnar fight warmup. I
know. It's really hilarious.

1401
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,610
Francis. Oh Jesus. What do
you want to do? The poor man.

1402
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:55,260
I'm going to w Frances or Brock
Brock. If I'm Bronx. Excuse me sir.

1403
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:58,290
I'm blast doubling luck.
I'm at fucking Minnesota.

1404
01:20:58,291 --> 01:21:02,400
You right through that
chiller or in the first round.

1405
01:21:02,401 --> 01:21:04,680
Francis is superhuman.
Freak strong,

1406
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,990
and you got to wear them out
before you could take them down,

1407
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,780
but you have to stay conscious long
enough to where I'm out for. You.

1408
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:12,180
Take them down and he's throwing new,

1409
01:21:12,181 --> 01:21:16,710
clear Putin style fucking head,
and when they land,

1410
01:21:16,711 --> 01:21:17,880
you're gonna see sparks.

1411
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:21,610
That's going to remind you of Alistair
Overeem and you're going to go, holy fuck.

1412
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:25,590
You play that game. If you play that
game. I fought Brock Lesnar. I am blasto.

1413
01:21:25,591 --> 01:21:28,410
I'm coming with a single it on on blast.
Definitely through Francis.

1414
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:31,200
Brock is older.
He's,

1415
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:34,320
he'd be the best wrestler
that France has ever faced.

1416
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:40,090
Who's that? Stevie Brock. No, Brock.
Brock's the best rest of that thought.

1417
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:41,550
You say he beat the best.

1418
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:45,000
I'm saying it'd be the best wrestler
that Francis ever fought. Oh,

1419
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:48,780
that's a problem. Oh yeah, for
sure. It's also ginormous, right?

1420
01:21:48,781 --> 01:21:51,720
But he doesn't have the standup at Acumen.
That's deep bay does.

1421
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:54,630
Like Brock is just not as good in the
stand up. We don't need any of that.

1422
01:21:54,631 --> 01:21:59,550
So you definitely need a little Nah,
you gonna need a little Nah liquid.

1423
01:21:59,551 --> 01:22:03,440
Allister did. Allister kept him
off. Remember that for a hot second.

1424
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:07,560
Then I also want to play the
rock 'em sock. 'Em robots
and got flatlined. No, no.

1425
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:10,770
When Alister beat up. Oh Guy. We're
talking about two different alleys.

1426
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:11,940
Jesus Christ sir.

1427
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:16,550
How dare you tell her how it to burrim
talking about the Uber took Bro, don't we?

1428
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:20,650
It was a moment in time when you and I
get together with my mouth salivates we

1429
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:23,730
talking about Uber. It was a
moment in time. A special moment.

1430
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:27,570
He was the scariest man on earth. Yeah,
there was. He was. It was a weird moment.

1431
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,640
It was like, wait a
minute, what? This is real.

1432
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:32,360
How has that kind of that
thing I was fighting then too.

1433
01:22:32,361 --> 01:22:36,690
It kind of feel like it's a bad idea.
Well, not only that, call his doctor,

1434
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:40,010
he had already won the k one
ground pre on the strike force.

1435
01:22:40,180 --> 01:22:43,020
He's smashed Brett Rodgers.
I mean he was,

1436
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:46,510
he was just beating the fuck out of
people, man. Brock was like, what?

1437
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:48,000
It was terrible fight for Brock.

1438
01:22:48,001 --> 01:22:51,660
The awful fighting man would take
down a fence and world class striking,

1439
01:22:51,661 --> 01:22:52,560
wicked striking.

1440
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:55,010
Like it was a different kind of striking
and it's like a much more tactical

1441
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:59,460
walking juice. Like we're
in fucking pumping out. Ooh,

1442
01:22:59,461 --> 01:23:02,190
like you're in fucking, what's
the juice place? Jamba juice.

1443
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:04,980
Like get the fucking job budget,

1444
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:11,400
but he doesn't punch as hard as Francis
that's ubering back then he did.

1445
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:14,560
He's just Louise's no, I don't
think so. I don't know man.

1446
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:17,590
He punched more technical,
very hard. Much more tactical.

1447
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:21,040
But I think Francis has
got some new things.

1448
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:25,300
Here's some powers,
new levels.

1449
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:29,350
The Way Francis punches you is like,
it's a different level now.

1450
01:23:29,351 --> 01:23:30,790
Francis is a complete nightmare.

1451
01:23:30,791 --> 01:23:34,750
Haver Brock Lesnar and be an
awful matchup for true. It's true.

1452
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:39,790
But I feel like you got two giant
moneymakers there. That's what I'm saying.

1453
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:42,450
I don't know. Trying to get it right
away. We try and make money or not. Yeah,

1454
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:45,430
but if Brock loses, that's a wrap.
Like if you lose the Francis,

1455
01:23:45,431 --> 01:23:49,270
he loses the most terrifying. It's not
like he's going on a 10 year run here.

1456
01:23:49,271 --> 01:23:51,960
We're just trying to get our money. Oh,
look at before and after. That's crazy.

1457
01:23:51,961 --> 01:23:56,380
As Christ 2009 to 2016 whoa.
That's amazing.

1458
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,340
Testosterone is real people. That's
more testosterone. That's that.

1459
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:04,720
That's that John, but not having,
it's real too. We're sure. Yeah.

1460
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,600
Tough mentally to, yeah. There's
not much you can do either.

1461
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:11,980
The other thing about it is like once
your body doesn't produce anymore and

1462
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:14,890
you're in your late thirties like that
and you've been juicing for a long time,

1463
01:24:14,910 --> 01:24:19,300
it was like Clomid and stuff that
tries to or to read each CT or HTC.

1464
01:24:19,390 --> 01:24:22,840
What's true? Is that a mood that's a
cell phone either way, hcg or something,

1465
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:25,180
whatever it is, but supposed to
boost your testosterone naturally,

1466
01:24:25,181 --> 01:24:28,510
but never to the levels when you're
injecting that John. But juice, no,

1467
01:24:28,511 --> 01:24:33,160
not only that though. You can't take
that stuff to in the UFC. It's illegal.

1468
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:35,470
I'm just saying when, yeah, that's
true. When I guess when he retires,

1469
01:24:35,471 --> 01:24:38,700
he can do whatever the
fuck he wants. Yeah, yeah.

1470
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:41,860
When he retires or goes to a rise in Kim,

1471
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:46,870
imagine UFC lets him out of the contract
and then all of a sudden he disappears

1472
01:24:46,871 --> 01:24:51,830
for like eight months and just we here
just locked in the house and ports horse

1473
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:55,560
meat back,
just just filet of horse all day.

1474
01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:59,050
He's eating that Canelo meat and goes
back to dead lift and hanging out with

1475
01:24:59,051 --> 01:25:03,460
power lifters. Steps out of the fucking
house in Holland. Six months later,

1476
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:07,780
Dick tied around [inaudible] 97 yes.
Yeah. I want that journey for him.

1477
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,140
I want that because I went on board of
that train is only one way can happen,

1478
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:11,441
dude.

1479
01:25:11,441 --> 01:25:15,310
How about Kelly and hot for fucking
Clenbuterol and they're saying it's in the

1480
01:25:15,311 --> 01:25:18,910
meat in Mexico. It is a small trace
amounts and everyone's like, oh,

1481
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:22,120
the fights off. Trust me, it's
boxing. That flight is not off.

1482
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:25,510
There's way too much money involved.
That is a real fact though,

1483
01:25:25,511 --> 01:25:29,290
is that one particular substance he
tested positive for exists in meat

1484
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:32,850
Clenbuterol yeah,
and also it's not like a straight steroid,

1485
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:36,460
you know guys use it to cut weight and
stuff like that and it's such a small

1486
01:25:36,461 --> 01:25:39,340
trace amount. They're going to be
fine. Yeah. That's such a great fight.

1487
01:25:39,341 --> 01:25:40,270
Triple g canola man.

1488
01:25:40,271 --> 01:25:43,060
It's a very good fight and it's way
better than the first one. Cinco de Maya.

1489
01:25:43,061 --> 01:25:44,920
Why do you think it's going to be better?
I cause I,

1490
01:25:44,921 --> 01:25:49,060
I think triple g didn't fight
like himself. He wasn't,
he has that mix in style.

1491
01:25:49,061 --> 01:25:51,910
He's a little reserved and then you know,
Canelo was moving too much.

1492
01:25:51,911 --> 01:25:55,210
I think now that they're going to break,
we're getting like the real fight now.

1493
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:59,860
I don't think the judges fuck this one
up. You never know though. It's shady.

1494
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:03,980
I loved the first fight. I loved it. I
thought let me too. I I thought triple g

1495
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,440
one it going away though. I
really thought he won. Me Too.

1496
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:09,530
I think a lot of people did. A lot of
people thought that was a poor draw.

1497
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:10,600
That's why I think,
you know,

1498
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:14,360
Chit with g coming off that drawl now
there's a lot more hype with everyone's

1499
01:26:14,361 --> 01:26:17,450
getting tuned in. The ratings are going
to be better. And my boxing judges,

1500
01:26:17,451 --> 01:26:22,220
you know, they're crooked. MMA is nowhere
near as bad, but bots like did you,

1501
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,260
did you see the wild Ortiz fight?
No,

1502
01:26:24,261 --> 01:26:27,140
I thought for sure wilder was losing on
the cars and like he's gonna have to get

1503
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:30,320
a finish. But on actual scorecards
they had wild or winning,

1504
01:26:30,321 --> 01:26:34,050
which obviously they want wilder to
win, which I thought was, I was like,

1505
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:37,760
I did and I'm a wilder Dick Rider.
I'm like, he's not looking at fight.

1506
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,660
I think they might be worse.
And they're the same exact judges,

1507
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:47,480
a lot of the same judges that judge MMA
that also or judge box and also judge

1508
01:26:47,481 --> 01:26:49,460
MMA and they don't even know what MMA is.

1509
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:53,930
UNDC trying to walk that tight rope
of not clown and what's her name?

1510
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:59,090
Abalene she's a very nice lady.
But as you said,

1511
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:02,200
so it was my mom. I don't
want her to fucking piss
exactly what I've nat judging.

1512
01:27:02,230 --> 01:27:06,140
That's exactly what I said. It's so fun.
You in DC just trying to balance that.

1513
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:10,030
She has no business being in the,
in the very nice lady. But yeah,

1514
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:13,190
she's made some bad decisions and
she also was a part all in though.

1515
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:18,080
She was also a part of the Canelo Alvarez
triple g decision. That's the problem.

1516
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,390
Yeah, she's balling. Yeah.

1517
01:27:20,391 --> 01:27:22,490
And she was on the wrong side of
a couple of decisions that night.

1518
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:23,960
There was some,
there was some bad ones.

1519
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:28,300
Super so site to some that we were like
what? How did he win every round? What?

1520
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:32,540
Oh you didn't make any sense like some
that some that literally didn't make any

1521
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:36,300
sense each time I'm in the UFC this past
weekend there was a lot of bad decision.

1522
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:39,740
Bad ones. Yeah. But there was like a
couple of split decisions that I was like,

1523
01:27:39,741 --> 01:27:41,780
what in the actual fuck is this?

1524
01:27:41,781 --> 01:27:43,850
And the weight screws over
the fine or they have no idea.

1525
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:47,830
The repercussion is such a shitty deal.
Yup. Yeah. They lose half their money.

1526
01:27:48,690 --> 01:27:52,090
Money, the money. Cause you don't know
what's going on and literally you,

1527
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,060
there's no recourse.

1528
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:56,990
And if it's a bad decision and there's
three people and one person just has

1529
01:27:56,991 --> 01:27:59,480
literally no idea what they're doing
and they give it to the wrong person,

1530
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:02,900
it's awful, man. It's fucking terrible
and it's unnecessary. Here's the thing,

1531
01:28:02,901 --> 01:28:05,300
it's unnecessary.
There's way better methods.

1532
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:09,350
And one of the most better methods is
one of the better methods is hire someone

1533
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:12,680
who was an actual martial arts expert.
Like I'm Matt Hume or something like that.

1534
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:14,810
Someone does score like,
oh you can,

1535
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:16,880
I'm sure there's a lot of
those guys that would do it.

1536
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,850
A lot of trainers out there that
would do it. I think I agree.

1537
01:28:19,851 --> 01:28:21,740
You need to have someone who
specialized in mixed martial arts.

1538
01:28:21,741 --> 01:28:24,750
She's been around the game. I don't, they
don't need to be Kate side cause cage.

1539
01:28:24,751 --> 01:28:27,140
I can't see everything.
And you're also swayed by the crowd.

1540
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:30,530
They shouldn't be in an
undisclosed location and
they're watching what we see in

1541
01:28:30,531 --> 01:28:34,430
judging the fight from the MMA fighters
perspective. I think that's a good point.

1542
01:28:34,431 --> 01:28:36,740
And I also think they should be
able to see all the replays. Yes,

1543
01:28:36,741 --> 01:28:39,830
they should see all the fight stat. So you
get everything, get everything, copies,

1544
01:28:39,831 --> 01:28:43,190
strikes and then decide. But what
you're doing now, so old school,

1545
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,110
the only thing that I would disagree with,

1546
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:48,140
I don't think they should
hear the commentary because
I think the commentary can

1547
01:28:48,141 --> 01:28:50,660
sway. I'm saying no, calm
down. Calm the crowd noise.

1548
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:54,260
You have three expert MMA and
molests watching this. Who's winning?

1549
01:28:54,261 --> 01:28:56,810
Cause you're going to, they know
the ground game, you know for that.

1550
01:28:56,811 --> 01:29:00,800
For Tony Ferguson, Khabib let's say
could be takes Tony Down and they think,

1551
01:29:00,801 --> 01:29:02,000
oh he has a huge advantage and

1552
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,870
then Tony's just whooping his ass,
throws back,

1553
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:06,600
elbows submission game stand back up,
getting taken down,

1554
01:29:06,601 --> 01:29:09,360
but on the ground could be
constantly under threat.

1555
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,460
How are you going to
judge that? How are, yeah,

1556
01:29:11,461 --> 01:29:14,590
you gotta know what you're looking at.
I also think three is too small.

1557
01:29:14,591 --> 01:29:17,340
I think it should be 10 people,
10 people.

1558
01:29:17,341 --> 01:29:19,800
A lot of people can't
qualify to have him call in.

1559
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:23,670
It's a real shit show how to do it all.
Do did it all with the Internet.

1560
01:29:23,730 --> 01:29:27,840
You didn't even have to be in the
building to be there. 10 10 people.

1561
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:28,950
It's harder for three more.
Yeah.

1562
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:31,740
But if there's two that are
smart and one that's bad,

1563
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:34,230
you've got a shitty split decision
and everybody feels weird about it.

1564
01:29:34,231 --> 01:29:35,900
Like what would have happened
if there was three more on?

1565
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:40,020
So can we say five 10 10 10 you're going
to get the right decision almost every

1566
01:29:40,021 --> 01:29:43,050
time because to a few people
are going to disagree,

1567
01:29:43,051 --> 01:29:44,070
but most people are gonna see it.

1568
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:46,270
That one majority majority's going
to see it this way and agree.

1569
01:29:46,300 --> 01:29:48,480
And if it's five to five,
you've got to fuck a draw in your hands.

1570
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:50,910
And that's rare.
I'm not mad at that.

1571
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:53,730
And I think sometimes a fight
should be a fucking draw.

1572
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:56,880
Draw a problems and watch it
go, man, that's too close. Call.

1573
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:59,610
Don't fuck over Sonia than half their pay.
If there's a draw,

1574
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:02,250
they both get their wisdom.
That's how we should do. Exactly.

1575
01:30:02,251 --> 01:30:06,090
One guy moves on and the other guy
doesn't just arbitrarily so weird.

1576
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,640
It doesn't make any sense for you to draw
and they have to in their contract it

1577
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:12,660
rematched whatever card the Raby go again.
I do it again.

1578
01:30:13,190 --> 01:30:16,760
And the fucking address here. I'm
sure he's texting, you know, count.

1579
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:21,720
He said he's 75 minutes away. He
said he found it. He says he's close.

1580
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:24,630
Is He? I don't believe
that he might be. He could.

1581
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:30,700
And Catlin. Brian Kidd in.
So what else is going on? Um,

1582
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:34,980
the UFC was what's happened. What
other, what other big fights are there?

1583
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:40,050
Um, when Yoel Romero comes in
and talks to a Joey Diaz and me,

1584
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,590
he's getting ready to fight
Whitaker. They're gonna, he's gonna,

1585
01:30:42,630 --> 01:30:43,680
he's gonna fight for the title,

1586
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:47,070
even though he didn't make weight in
the Rockhold fight. That's short notice.

1587
01:30:47,071 --> 01:30:49,860
I don't hold that against them though.
Right. Especially with his body type. God,

1588
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:52,270
he looked good. Get good
against Rockhold. Huh?

1589
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:54,690
Rockhold teddy was like made out of metal.

1590
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:59,940
Said the guy was just ridiculously strong.
Fight Rockhold for anybody. For anyone.

1591
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:03,750
Robert Whitaker. But yeah. Yeah. In
[inaudible] with healthy needs. Man,

1592
01:31:04,190 --> 01:31:06,510
there's a nice man. Yeah, he's gonna
be tough to beat for a long time.

1593
01:31:06,570 --> 01:31:09,840
But if someone could do it,
could be ELL, but is not young,

1594
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:15,270
40 years old son. Every bit of it. Yeah.
Who knows those Cuban birth certificates.

1595
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:18,270
You have no idea. That's what I
saying with Ortiz. They said, oh,

1596
01:31:18,271 --> 01:31:22,020
he's 38 when bullshit. That's the most
shot out. 38 year old I've ever seen.

1597
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:24,590
That man has 400 amateur fights in Cuba.
There's no,

1598
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:29,430
he's 38 to 48 he thinks
so that he's not 38.

1599
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:32,340
There's no way you see him up
close. I'm like, what the fuck?

1600
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:35,400
Did you see him up close? Yeah,
I said the press, uh, the, uh,

1601
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:36,680
the Wayne's all that stuff for shelter.

1602
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:40,290
Did you see the fight live or did
you see it on TV? No, I flew back.

1603
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:42,600
I supposed to work it,
but I flew back.

1604
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:48,590
I watched 'em Kovalev beat up his
friend beat the piss out of his friend.

1605
01:31:48,931 --> 01:31:49,830
It was like his friend.

1606
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:52,470
It was like the guy was fighting him
like he was his friend and cove low was

1607
01:31:52,471 --> 01:31:56,070
fighting him. Like some guy fucked his
girlfriend. They ass Kobo if killed a guy.

1608
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:59,620
Yeah. And it didn't seem,
don't know mother fucker.
He's a super bad motherfucker.

1609
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:00,070
But

1610
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:02,860
now with that wilder or tease fight,
which was,

1611
01:32:02,861 --> 01:32:05,850
it kind of did what I think for wilder.
What Joe Anthony,

1612
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:08,470
Joshua w against Klitschko. We're
now, everyone's stuck around.

1613
01:32:08,471 --> 01:32:11,530
So now before we didn't think
we'd get Anthony, Joshua Wilder,

1614
01:32:11,531 --> 01:32:13,810
but I think it forces
Joshua's hand to fight.

1615
01:32:13,811 --> 01:32:17,290
Wilder was before it wasn't going to
happen, which that's the fight man.

1616
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:19,440
Why wasn't going to happen before?
Because they have the will.

1617
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:23,290
So anti Joshua has to get through
Joseph Parker first, early next month,

1618
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:26,260
which is a beast. Just Parker's a
nightmare from New Zealand, I think.

1619
01:32:26,261 --> 01:32:29,360
20 [inaudible], you know,
world champion, no punk.

1620
01:32:29,361 --> 01:32:31,870
So he had to get by that and then he
was going to take like one or two more

1621
01:32:31,871 --> 01:32:33,130
fights before he fought wilder.

1622
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:36,730
Now you can't do that because
while they're just won by
emphatic. Yeah. Was like,

1623
01:32:36,731 --> 01:32:38,950
what are you talking about?
The hops on those talked about box.

1624
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:42,190
Right now you have to take this fight.
Why did they put fights like that off?

1625
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:45,190
Like why do they say, we'll take
a cup that's boxing. Well, listen,

1626
01:32:45,191 --> 01:32:47,890
if he has a business, if you're, if
you're Anthony, Joshua was man, just like,

1627
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:51,010
all right, do we fight dot throughout
who's 40 and oh, 39 knockouts.

1628
01:32:51,011 --> 01:32:52,720
The nightmare of a fight for anybody,

1629
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:56,920
which we were probably favorites still
to fight or do we fight this guy,

1630
01:32:56,921 --> 01:33:00,810
this guy, and get paid and
then fight wilder? You know,

1631
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:05,680
things can go wrong. Exactly.
A heavyweight, Joseph Parker
is no joke. Not at all.

1632
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:07,900
No. But yeah, things could go wrong,

1633
01:33:07,901 --> 01:33:11,830
but I'm assuming that's
their way of thinking.

1634
01:33:11,831 --> 01:33:15,240
You know what? It's scary.
I, I was jumping around off,

1635
01:33:15,241 --> 01:33:17,320
see being around these guys,
you know,

1636
01:33:17,321 --> 01:33:21,490
I get close with guys and I know wilder
and I wanted to win so bad just because

1637
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:26,470
it's good for the sport. It's not knocking
Ortiz teaser, amazing fighter, but wild.

1638
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:30,550
He checks all the boxes, man. He can,
he can sell tickets. He's American. He,

1639
01:33:30,551 --> 01:33:33,190
you know, he talks a lot of
shit. He has a great story.

1640
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:36,760
Started boxing because his daughter was
born with a spinal issue and couldn't

1641
01:33:36,761 --> 01:33:40,510
walk and he just has these great stories
and you want the root for that trust as

1642
01:33:40,511 --> 01:33:44,260
well dressed as well.
Diane piece knockout artists,

1643
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:49,090
but him and Josh was the
fight man. Yeah, he has one.

1644
01:33:49,091 --> 01:33:53,670
His last couple of fights
pretty spectacularly to
people are so fussy, so mad.

1645
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:58,330
They get so mad at me. They go, oh, oh
my God. Oh, you're such a home, are you?

1646
01:33:58,450 --> 01:33:59,560
You love wild. I'm like, well,

1647
01:33:59,561 --> 01:34:01,720
I like Joshua to where they're
like used to root for Joshua.

1648
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:05,740
I liked both of them are men can't
respond to those people. I don't respond,

1649
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:09,040
but he can't. Even right now you're
responding well, it's way, it's my job.

1650
01:34:09,041 --> 01:34:12,760
You know? We do that thing kind of. Yeah.
You know, I like both of those guys, man.

1651
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,720
I love both of them. You can like
both of them. That's when Ferguson,

1652
01:34:16,740 --> 01:34:21,410
Tony Ferguson got mad that I put a cubs
hat on. He, Tony, I thought were tall,

1653
01:34:21,411 --> 01:34:25,690
10th planet. I'm like, hey bro, I'm
wearing the hat. Guy gives me the hat.

1654
01:34:25,691 --> 01:34:29,640
I'm wearing it. I could be, but I like
Tony like or Tayga like Frankie Egg.

1655
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:31,960
Want to see you guys fight. I think
it'd be awesome. You're going to,

1656
01:34:32,270 --> 01:34:34,750
there's going to be
animosity. No, no doubt.

1657
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:38,360
If someone doesn't make weight or get
her fired, I'm going to cry. Yeah,

1658
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:42,400
I'm blue every day. When I checked Tony's
Instagram or check Khabib's, I'm like,

1659
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:46,390
please, please, no injuries, no
injuries. Everybody keep it together.

1660
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:50,380
Anything crazy in there? We're not even
a month away. Not even a month away.

1661
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:54,160
Yeah. That's a fight.
Yeah. What is the date?

1662
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:58,220
It's March 6th it's a
month and a day for a month

1663
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:02,150
and a day. Good googly Mowgli. That fight,

1664
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:05,330
that fight is by far my favorite.
The fight has to happen.

1665
01:35:05,331 --> 01:35:09,380
It has to reach and it could
be and then steep a DC.

1666
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,910
Those are my two fights where I'm just,

1667
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:15,230
I'm literally like the school
blocking card. Key asset versus pedis.

1668
01:35:15,231 --> 01:35:19,580
I forgot about that owl.
I Quinta verses Paul Felder.

1669
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:22,850
Are you fucking Shit Dude?

1670
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,420
Yolana do Rose Joe Lowe.

1671
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:31,220
Lozan you want to and rose.
Oh my goodness. God Damn.

1672
01:35:31,221 --> 01:35:35,090
Evan Dunham still doing the damn
thing and they gave him that monster.

1673
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:39,440
Yeah. Tie some off. Well they couldn't
get an, and trying to fight tight.

1674
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:43,190
They couldn't get married back.
Tie some off a good fight for a long time.

1675
01:35:43,191 --> 01:35:46,430
He's very, very directly
that gentlemen. Yeah.

1676
01:35:46,431 --> 01:35:49,400
And he's having a real hard time
getting matchups with Evan Dunham.

1677
01:35:49,401 --> 01:35:51,410
Doesn't give a fuck.
I bet you anything.

1678
01:35:51,411 --> 01:35:55,610
Your boy Connor's there because his boy
Artem low blobs fighting and prednisone.

1679
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:59,060
Khabib makes sense. Yeah.
Lobe Office Fighting Cause
Sarah's, that should be fine.

1680
01:35:59,090 --> 01:36:04,070
Hello Bob Fan man. It's tough dude.
Salty record at 14, 14 but that's life.

1681
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:05,990
Yeah,
he's um,

1682
01:36:06,230 --> 01:36:10,940
it's interesting because there's two
schools of thought with him and Connor is

1683
01:36:10,941 --> 01:36:11,301
that,
you know,

1684
01:36:11,301 --> 01:36:16,301
that he's strong and he's powerful and
he's a good sparring partner for Connor.

1685
01:36:16,581 --> 01:36:19,910
But I've also heard people say no kind
of likes him because Connor can fuck him

1686
01:36:19,911 --> 01:36:23,720
up. And Connor sparks.
Yeah. So God damn tough.

1687
01:36:23,721 --> 01:36:28,520
Like having a really tough
sparring partners. Probably
a great idea. Both. Yeah.

1688
01:36:28,521 --> 01:36:32,420
He's not exactly a technician, but he
thought, I'm so damn tough. It's hard to,

1689
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:35,440
he hits hard. He said, you got to watch
your p's and q's at all times. He,

1690
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:37,750
I'm sure he's a great training
partner and he's loyal to,

1691
01:36:37,770 --> 01:36:40,940
he's not going to hurt you. That's
it. Super important. Oh yeah.

1692
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:44,720
Especially now in Carter's life. That's
got to be real important. And I mean,

1693
01:36:44,721 --> 01:36:47,870
how many people were just constantly
trying to get the best of them and so on.

1694
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,920
No hashtag no new friends either. There's
no new guy sparring with him. I was, um,

1695
01:36:51,950 --> 01:36:55,310
looking at this, uh, this dude,

1696
01:36:55,311 --> 01:37:00,230
a couture row on k one here. I'm going
to send it to you, Jamie. This dudes,

1697
01:37:01,010 --> 01:37:05,690
they were doing the exact kind of sparring
that I fucking hate to see anyone do

1698
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:10,420
where they were literally just going
at each other out and then, um,

1699
01:37:11,140 --> 01:37:15,860
could Taru connected with the
giant bomb and knocked him out.

1700
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:19,490
Yes, he did. It was awful. That's
that old school fighting, man.

1701
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,430
I'm going to send this to Jamie. Hang on
a second. Super old school fighting. Well,

1702
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:24,110
it's just,

1703
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:28,190
it's unfortunate when people choose to
train like this because this is a real

1704
01:37:28,330 --> 01:37:31,550
out that this guy suffered
and it wasn't an accident.

1705
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:34,610
Like this guy was teeing off on
him trying to knock them out.

1706
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:36,530
I just sent it to you in a text message.

1707
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:40,430
It's not like the guy was
knocked out because um, you know,

1708
01:37:40,431 --> 01:37:44,750
he just got caught with a freak punch off
the Gaba and sparring. Watch this shit.

1709
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:46,250
We get those guys in the back of it.
We have this

1710
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:50,390
look at this or they're playing for keeps

1711
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:56,690
and then walks away. Like it doesn't
give a fuck. It's so weird, man. Hey,

1712
01:37:56,820 --> 01:38:01,560
don't get out of it. Look at
this guy. Doesn't like that.

1713
01:38:01,561 --> 01:38:04,140
Very good. Who he's
fighting. No, no, he doesn't.

1714
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:09,030
And mean he is swinging from the
Oh, that dude's like k owed. Yeah.

1715
01:38:09,031 --> 01:38:13,580
He's flatline. Yeah. How
do you say his last name?

1716
01:38:13,581 --> 01:38:16,760
That's that you're talking to me.
I'm the worst at as to how do you,

1717
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:19,730
how do you think it's it?
Tele k one,

1718
01:38:19,731 --> 01:38:21,800
two Carew tuck heroin

1719
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:29,090
to Carol. Yeah. You don't want
this. And then he posted that. Yup.

1720
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:34,460
It's awful, right? No, it's just a
tool moods. Awful. Well, it's just me.

1721
01:38:34,490 --> 01:38:37,880
Maybe it wasn't him sparring. I don't
know who was getting k. I would like that.

1722
01:38:37,881 --> 01:38:41,170
But that should be an example of just
what not to do. A hundred or are you,

1723
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:45,440
what does the [inaudible] shoot box
back in fucking 97 what are you doing?

1724
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:48,950
Does it show the translation?
No. Who Cares? Either way.
Either way. I don't post it.

1725
01:38:48,951 --> 01:38:53,270
That's how it used to be. That's how guys
spar got back in the day. Like for sure.

1726
01:38:53,271 --> 01:38:55,970
Educate your side. I know this why
when you see something like that today,

1727
01:38:55,971 --> 01:38:58,400
like hard to see now that's not,
it's not smart.

1728
01:38:58,401 --> 01:39:00,680
It's not good for you and
it's not a good way to train.

1729
01:39:00,740 --> 01:39:03,560
You're not learning from that. And she got
a break all your toys. So people go, oh,

1730
01:39:03,561 --> 01:39:05,720
you fight like that and now
we're good man, we're good.

1731
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:09,410
Or You have to be a guy who can hang
in there in that gym and do that,

1732
01:39:09,411 --> 01:39:12,200
but all of you are going to take
unnecessary damage. Can you do it? Yeah,

1733
01:39:12,201 --> 01:39:15,020
you can do it. That's how we used to do
it. Everyone has to do the can do it,

1734
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:18,320
but is it smart to do it? Definitely not.
No. That's not the right way to do it.

1735
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:21,740
Especially at his level. We know you're
tough, man. You'll need to knock guys out.

1736
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:24,770
Finding the K one. What
are you doing? Yeah.

1737
01:39:24,950 --> 01:39:29,030
Did you watch all the glorious past
weekend? I'm not huge into glory jugs.

1738
01:39:29,270 --> 01:39:33,680
I watch all comments. Are you? I know.
I know. You don't like kickboxing.

1739
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:38,200
It's all right to me. I do.
I enjoy it. I appreciate the
art, stuff like that, but I,

1740
01:39:38,410 --> 01:39:41,090
I was, I was really into k one
and when it was in its prime,

1741
01:39:41,091 --> 01:39:42,560
but with glow I can't,

1742
01:39:42,561 --> 01:39:44,890
it's hard for me getting the glory and
there's some amazing guys in there.

1743
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:48,860
I'm just, I only have so much time on my
hands were goalies. Not that's shorty.

1744
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:53,620
Yeah. I Dunno. To me, I like
it better than boxing to me.
I dare you. I'm sorry. I do.

1745
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:56,660
It's like, I don't even know. I'm being
honest. I appreciate it. We'll get glory.

1746
01:39:56,661 --> 01:39:59,220
Fight to me is more interesting
than a real good boxing match.

1747
01:39:59,390 --> 01:40:04,250
Crazy like kicks crazy like knees.
I like Moyie Thai even more.

1748
01:40:04,820 --> 01:40:07,070
More than boxing. Yup.
A good box. A match.

1749
01:40:07,370 --> 01:40:10,920
If you rather watch that than Canelo
triple g you got your God. Wow.

1750
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:15,950
That's an exceptional. What's a lifetime
match? You know that wild Ortiz fight,

1751
01:40:15,951 --> 01:40:19,010
man, one of the best I've ever
seen. But like say if it was like

1752
01:40:21,530 --> 01:40:26,390
bull cow versus San Chai. Yeah. I would
be just as excited about it. Yeah,

1753
01:40:26,450 --> 01:40:29,840
that's fair. You know what I mean? Like
those two levels. Yeah. That level.

1754
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:33,680
That is not so extreme. That's
crazy fight. Yeah. You'd
want to see what happens.

1755
01:40:34,010 --> 01:40:38,190
Yeah. I don't know. I just, again, I can
appreciate it when there's a good fight.

1756
01:40:38,630 --> 01:40:39,463
I'm down by,
I don't,

1757
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:44,010
I'm not going to shut down my knight in
order pizza and watch a glory. I will.

1758
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:49,260
I will for sure. But yeah, I don't
miss it, which is weird. Which I,

1759
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:53,350
I don't miss any MMA.
UFC bellatore I don't miss any boxing.

1760
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:54,730
There's Sally shut everything down.

1761
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:58,570
Did you get excited about the Kovalev
fight or was it just like, Nah,

1762
01:40:58,571 --> 01:41:01,330
I get excited about it. Anytime.
Yeah. Super excited about it.

1763
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:06,010
Like this past weekend I was so,
I was just so happy because I knew I had,

1764
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:10,390
I had fricking showtime boxing
on with wilder for short tees,

1765
01:41:10,391 --> 01:41:11,260
which is a great fight.

1766
01:41:11,261 --> 01:41:16,060
And then you also had UFC two 22 so when
you can in that ended before the event

1767
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:20,050
events. I get to see all of it. That makes
my weekend, man. Did you see that dude?

1768
01:41:20,051 --> 01:41:24,700
Uh, Alexander Hernandez
starch, but Neil Darr, huge.

1769
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:28,330
Did he effort dare you?
She's hitting a rough patch.

1770
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:32,710
How about your boy Hector [inaudible]
x one bar. That wasn't good.

1771
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:35,820
Where are you at on that cheap
shot? Cheap shot you think? Yeah.

1772
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:38,890
I think it was a natural actress
Combo you can get away with. I agree.

1773
01:41:38,891 --> 01:41:42,240
The second punch, he knows the bell's
already rung. The first one I said, right,

1774
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:45,970
you're, you're in motion. But that's
that second one that knocked them out.

1775
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,850
That's where I got to draw the line.
Yeah, it's healthy. It's bad die.

1776
01:41:48,851 --> 01:41:52,480
But it's also a natural
counter to kick like that,

1777
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:56,170
to throw that straight right with
the left hook. So maybe there's that,

1778
01:41:56,171 --> 01:41:59,590
but you can't have the fight carry on.
We definitely naturally fired back,

1779
01:41:59,591 --> 01:42:02,530
but he knew in his head that the bell
had rung and he fired back anyway.

1780
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:06,190
I mean that's what it, that's what
happened. Why did he do it? I don't know,

1781
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:09,670
but here's the thing. We can't
speculate. We don't know. No one knows.

1782
01:42:09,671 --> 01:42:10,540
It was on purpose.

1783
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,200
While you know as the bell rings
and rules the rules real clear,

1784
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:18,790
the bell rings to do, throws a punch
and then another punch after the bell,

1785
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,570
a hundred percent foul. There's no gray
area like that. They're going to appeal.

1786
01:42:22,571 --> 01:42:26,350
That to me is crazy and act two was
saying something like the guy was talking.

1787
01:42:26,351 --> 01:42:29,780
He was fine. Just keep saying
what happened? Where am I? Yeah,

1788
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:33,700
that's what's the CB dollar? He said,
yeah, he said it over. I kept saying that.

1789
01:42:33,701 --> 01:42:36,190
He was saying I was letting everybody
know because he was saying it over and

1790
01:42:36,191 --> 01:42:38,800
over again and we all know what that is.

1791
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:42,430
We've all seen that when a guy gets
knocked out and just keep saying what

1792
01:42:42,431 --> 01:42:45,740
happened, what's a nightmare?
It happens so often. Yes.

1793
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:49,120
That is what always happens when
people get KOD suit. They go, Oh shit,

1794
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:50,760
what happened?
You don't remember it.

1795
01:42:50,761 --> 01:42:54,400
And you tell them and then five minutes
later what happened and then you tell

1796
01:42:54,401 --> 01:42:58,690
him, why am I here? What happened? Like
they forget over and over again all night.

1797
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:02,050
I got to stay up hectors in a tough spot
because he's lost five in a row now.

1798
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:05,140
So I don't, I'm not sure what
they're gonna do with him. Well,

1799
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:09,520
I mean I would imagine if CB wants to
do a rematch, they would do a rematch.

1800
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:10,330
Cause is,

1801
01:43:10,330 --> 01:43:13,780
there'd be some interest in that fight
because either one of those guys is not

1802
01:43:13,781 --> 01:43:18,130
generating a ton of interest. Hector's
lost a lot of fights, a lot of fights.

1803
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:23,050
These last two, he got knocked out by Mark
Hart. Remember that? Yeah, that was bad.

1804
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:25,150
That was bad.
And that was,

1805
01:43:25,151 --> 01:43:29,320
it seemed to me like one of those fights
where he thought Mark Hart was done,

1806
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:33,970
you know, lasting to go donate retired.
Yeah. Officially she retired. Yeah.

1807
01:43:34,690 --> 01:43:36,010
I'm glad.
I'm glad I'm retired.

1808
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:39,460
But there's a thing that happens
to fighters where you know,

1809
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:42,700
there's can't take a shot anymore.
They just been doing it too long.

1810
01:43:42,830 --> 01:43:44,860
It's just a fact.
And so guys go after him,

1811
01:43:44,861 --> 01:43:47,340
but the last thing to go with
a guy like Nate is power. Yeah.

1812
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:51,860
He knocks out CB after CB. Um, you know,

1813
01:43:51,890 --> 01:43:54,560
can you see became back and who did he be?
I thought CV one,

1814
01:43:54,561 --> 01:43:57,620
two in a row and then they got Hector
or did he lose it? One in decision,

1815
01:43:57,710 --> 01:44:00,380
but I'm pretty sure after mate
he won one. Well, you know,

1816
01:44:00,381 --> 01:44:04,010
he got fucked up in an elevator accident.
He's in a lawsuit with the UFC over it.

1817
01:44:04,070 --> 01:44:07,700
Yeah. He's like permanently fucked
up. Is that that one happened? Yeah,

1818
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:11,540
he was on an elevator and
it just dropped to elevate.

1819
01:44:11,541 --> 01:44:15,230
It just dropped and slammed onto the
bottom. I'm sorry. How's at the UCS Brown?

1820
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:18,950
It's, I don't think he's in a lawsuit
with the z not am I crazy is a lawsuit.

1821
01:44:18,951 --> 01:44:22,550
I think with the hotel, I thought
it was the UFC. Maybe I'm wrong.

1822
01:44:22,850 --> 01:44:26,540
It doesn't make sense if the elevator
and then I have misinformation because it

1823
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:27,950
wouldn't make sense come after the UFC.

1824
01:44:27,980 --> 01:44:30,260
If it was a whole hotel and you
didn't know that it was the,

1825
01:44:30,261 --> 01:44:33,230
the elevator accident. I knew
it was the elevator. So yeah,

1826
01:44:33,231 --> 01:44:34,540
it doesn't make sense that
they'd come after the year.

1827
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:36,260
I only come after you have sex.
What I heard,

1828
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:39,800
but it apparently there was quite a
few people in that elevator and when he

1829
01:44:39,801 --> 01:44:40,634
dropped,

1830
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,630
a lot of them got fucked up like more
than three or four people in the elevator.

1831
01:44:44,630 --> 01:44:48,910
But he got fucked up bad. Was
it a Steve Wynn? I don't know.

1832
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,320
I don't know who owned it. I don't
know where it was. Do not remember.

1833
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:55,760
That's such a shame for that though.
Yeah,

1834
01:44:55,761 --> 01:44:59,690
but he did go and fight again, so they
would probably be arguing like, hey,

1835
01:44:59,691 --> 01:45:01,360
you're still professional because what?

1836
01:45:01,370 --> 01:45:04,370
I was getting sick because he's in that
law suit. Then you fight this weekend,

1837
01:45:04,371 --> 01:45:07,130
the courtrooms can be like, hold up,
you're saying your packs and issue,

1838
01:45:07,170 --> 01:45:11,120
they fought Hector lumbar you're
talking about, that's true, right.

1839
01:45:11,121 --> 01:45:15,560
The best argument would be did not fight
until the lawsuits settled and wait,

1840
01:45:15,561 --> 01:45:18,950
shoot some stem cells in there. Down
in Panama. Yeah. So listening tiny.

1841
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:20,990
See you ever standing on the headphones?

1842
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:26,290
Wyndham hotel in Cleveland dumps.

1843
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:30,740
Don't stay at window or do so they'll
a sue the shit out of those people.

1844
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:32,210
We'll see what happens.
But yeah,

1845
01:45:32,211 --> 01:45:37,211
the p the o elevator apparently was
getting funky on people before and uh,

1846
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:41,210
people were still riding it don't,
don't more people die in elevators.

1847
01:45:41,211 --> 01:45:42,980
Cause when they, they, they're
like talking to her friend.

1848
01:45:42,981 --> 01:45:45,320
They assume the elevators here and
then walking. The elevator's not,

1849
01:45:45,321 --> 01:45:46,970
then they go down.
More people die like that.

1850
01:45:46,971 --> 01:45:50,420
Then really even imagine yet why the word
doesn't come our open because the door,

1851
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:53,550
cause it thinks you know something's
wrong and they're like, yeah,

1852
01:45:54,670 --> 01:45:56,540
and they fall to their death.
It's a bad one.

1853
01:45:56,810 --> 01:46:00,890
So always look at the elevators there.
That's fucked up. Way to end it.

1854
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:05,360
Shitty deal.
You don't want to go out like that.

1855
01:46:05,480 --> 01:46:06,313
No.

1856
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:10,490
I heard a story about a dude who got
trapped in an elevator in the elevator,

1857
01:46:10,491 --> 01:46:13,100
went up and he was trapped
in the door in the elevator,

1858
01:46:13,101 --> 01:46:15,480
went up and just shared them
in half. Oh yeah. I saw that.

1859
01:46:15,481 --> 01:46:20,000
And final destination to maybe that's
what it was. And I made it up now.

1860
01:46:20,001 --> 01:46:22,970
I'm pretty sure it was real.
That'd be a terrible way to go.

1861
01:46:23,470 --> 01:46:27,770
It's like that actor who was in Star
Trek and he was in Alpha Dog. He was,

1862
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:32,210
he lived right up here, man in Hollywood,
Hollywood hills. He lives on, uh,

1863
01:46:32,270 --> 01:46:35,620
on an incline and it was
getting out of his jeep to,

1864
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:38,330
to close the garage door
and he didn't put the,

1865
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:41,750
the jeep and park and it rolled up,
killed him, rolled over and killed him.

1866
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:47,260
Trapped against the garage door.
Young actor to phenomenal actor.

1867
01:46:47,370 --> 01:46:51,270
Ah, fuck. Wow.

1868
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:55,200
Baxter on the elevator, one leg in the
elevator, one late in the second floor.

1869
01:46:55,470 --> 01:46:58,380
He was helping the occupants get off
the elevator when all of a sudden shot

1870
01:46:58,381 --> 01:47:02,250
upwards beheading him. That's it.
His body fell into the second floor.

1871
01:47:02,251 --> 01:47:05,160
Lobbies had fall onto the
floor of the elevator,

1872
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:09,480
his head and the two remaining pastures
in the elevator shot up to the ninth

1873
01:47:09,481 --> 01:47:13,680
floor and one of the passenger described
the scene. I can't get out of my mind.

1874
01:47:13,681 --> 01:47:15,960
The head was there, the
bar, but the body wasn't.

1875
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:19,530
He still had the Walkman
earphones on his head. Holy Shit.

1876
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:23,280
There've been many problems with the
elevator and the service repairman was at

1877
01:47:23,281 --> 01:47:24,660
the building that day to work on it.

1878
01:47:24,661 --> 01:47:29,040
The elevator had been inspected November
1st, 1994 and passed the inspection.

1879
01:47:30,030 --> 01:47:35,030
The blue dog. Shit. That's a way to go,
baby. Not Good, painless though guests,

1880
01:47:35,090 --> 01:47:36,890
but you will be awake
for a couple seconds.

1881
01:47:36,891 --> 01:47:38,880
You know they say once you get chicken,
right.

1882
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:41,460
That doesn't make sense to
me though because how come
you not awake when you get

1883
01:47:41,461 --> 01:47:45,750
choked out?
Right?

1884
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:49,020
Well, because when you, when
you get decapitated, right,

1885
01:47:49,021 --> 01:47:52,020
everything's still finding some of the
energy still up there firing so you can

1886
01:47:52,021 --> 01:47:54,240
see,
maybe I heard about the chicken.

1887
01:47:54,241 --> 01:47:58,190
It didn't have any head live for 18
months without a noggin. After farming,

1888
01:47:58,210 --> 01:48:01,740
a failed attempt at slaughter axed off
the head of missed the juggler vain.

1889
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:05,250
We really, we really don't know,
right? When people lose their heads,

1890
01:48:05,251 --> 01:48:09,180
shake hands are fucking dinosaurs,
man. The Shit. I've said that many,

1891
01:48:09,181 --> 01:48:13,230
many too many times, but that kind
of shit is what you need to see.

1892
01:48:13,290 --> 01:48:15,240
Just realize this is not,
that's not person.

1893
01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:18,450
Although a pterodactyl is not a
dinosaur. It's so strange to me. I know.

1894
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:22,350
I think Tara doctors might've
had feathers. They don't know.

1895
01:48:22,380 --> 01:48:25,560
They're thinking now that a
lot of dinosaurs had feathers,

1896
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:27,300
but when you think about
what a terra data is,

1897
01:48:27,301 --> 01:48:29,160
we always assume it had like bat wings,

1898
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:32,850
but now that they think that dinosaurs
had feathers, I wonder if they giant bird.

1899
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:33,551
Yeah.

1900
01:48:33,551 --> 01:48:38,430
I wonder if they've decided to look into
that and look it at as a possibility.

1901
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:41,880
You ever see or see that giant picture
that it's the t rex covered in feathers?

1902
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:45,240
Yeah. That shit out of my face
didn't look like that bitch.

1903
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:49,140
They might've covered raptors covering.

1904
01:48:49,730 --> 01:48:52,920
They had feathers. They've looked
pretty dope too, man. You seen the PA?

1905
01:48:52,970 --> 01:48:56,510
Have you seen the pictures dating that
bullshit? T-Rex covered in feathers. Yeah,

1906
01:48:57,510 --> 01:49:02,490
that one's furry. It was cute. Be
Willing elements. Cool. Yeah. See, um,

1907
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:06,240
that one we, we showed it
before it's out here, Bozeman,

1908
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:10,800
Bozeman Science Museum
or some shit in Bozeman,

1909
01:49:10,801 --> 01:49:13,840
Montana. Pretty cool
place. And they have, uh,

1910
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:17,670
a replica of what they think are wrapped
or could have looked like if it was

1911
01:49:17,671 --> 01:49:21,240
covered in feathers because they think
it's very possible that that's what those

1912
01:49:21,241 --> 01:49:24,410
things looked like. Remember Jamie? There
was, it was on the floor. There was a,

1913
01:49:24,411 --> 01:49:26,940
an actual model.
We pulled up the image before.

1914
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:31,440
I mean if you go to images and
some science shit for the feathers,

1915
01:49:31,441 --> 01:49:35,070
but if that's what they think because um,
they found some that have feathers,

1916
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:39,360
they know that they've got some fossils
that have like very clear indentations

1917
01:49:39,361 --> 01:49:40,470
where feathers must've been,

1918
01:49:40,530 --> 01:49:44,460
well then everything I grew up
on with dinosaurs is wrong. Well,

1919
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:46,020
they think that's true anyway.

1920
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:49,540
They used to think the t
rex was a Predator and now
they think it's a scavenger.

1921
01:49:49,870 --> 01:49:53,620
I think this is vegetarian. No, they
think he just waddled around just crow.

1922
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:55,100
Like that's why the teeth are so big,

1923
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:57,580
crushed dead animals that are just
laying around. That's it right there.

1924
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:59,170
That's what I think
that thing looked like,

1925
01:49:59,830 --> 01:50:01,810
which is kind of even more nightmarish,

1926
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:06,580
more freaky big life feathered fucking
lizard that runs and gutsy with its

1927
01:50:06,581 --> 01:50:09,160
claws.
My brains trying to analyze it.

1928
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:12,880
It doesn't really work well
cause how we know dinosaurs,

1929
01:50:12,881 --> 01:50:16,990
you know they have an eagle man. I mean
eagle is a lot like a fucking dinosaur.

1930
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:21,470
It just, it has a hatchet for a head
instead of instead of teeth. Yeah,

1931
01:50:22,210 --> 01:50:24,490
but you look at an ostrich,
you look at their legs and shit.

1932
01:50:24,491 --> 01:50:26,990
You can see dinosaur in it.
Hundred percent feet. Yeah.

1933
01:50:27,190 --> 01:50:28,810
But nobody has teeth like that.

1934
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:32,860
There's not a single bird that
has like leopard seal type teeth.

1935
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:37,450
You know God leopard seal
on underappreciate. Angela
things mean as fuck.

1936
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:41,580
One of the coolest animals of all time.
We were on the scooters and went down.

1937
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:42,850
There's all these leopard seals.

1938
01:50:43,030 --> 01:50:46,060
There's some people taking pictures
of some agent. Dude walked up,

1939
01:50:46,061 --> 01:50:47,320
got nose to nose with this thing.

1940
01:50:47,321 --> 01:50:51,490
I told my brother you could get your
camera out cause that thing is a full rip

1941
01:50:51,491 --> 01:50:54,760
his face off and this could be awesome.
God,

1942
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:58,930
they're fucking killers, man. Third
Leopard. You know what I'm saying?

1943
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:01,930
Like the Leopard for for a reason.
But you know,

1944
01:51:01,931 --> 01:51:05,200
I didn't even know they were a real
thing until I watched that march of the

1945
01:51:05,201 --> 01:51:08,800
penguins movie and went, what?
You know they're real. I didn't,

1946
01:51:08,801 --> 01:51:11,740
I didn't know what a fucking re leopard
seal was. I'd never heard of it.

1947
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:15,310
Other gangster and they haven't Skinner
cause since a kid I was in Mexico and

1948
01:51:15,311 --> 01:51:18,340
there's one going up in the
water, I thought, oh cute look,

1949
01:51:18,341 --> 01:51:21,040
it's like the ones I see on cartoons and
my dad's friend who was a navy was like,

1950
01:51:21,041 --> 01:51:24,670
do not go in the water. Those things
are mean as fuck. I was like, really?

1951
01:51:24,671 --> 01:51:27,970
He's like, yes, they're out there
fucking killing shit right now. Yeah,

1952
01:51:27,971 --> 01:51:31,570
they've eaten people before. There's
one of them, either poor penguin,

1953
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:33,190
a scientist,

1954
01:51:33,191 --> 01:51:38,191
actually a female scientist
in a rare attack got killed,

1955
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:41,340
I want to say about 10 years
ago. It was, things are gangster.

1956
01:51:41,341 --> 01:51:46,341
They were pretty stunned because they
have giant mounds and huge teeth will look

1957
01:51:46,991 --> 01:51:50,290
like with his mouth closed there.
Look so fucking cute. Like, hey buddy.

1958
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:53,380
That's what the Asian dudes doing.
Nose to nose with the Spaghetti.

1959
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:57,220
I buddy now get me a picture of his teeth
like right above with his mouth open.

1960
01:51:57,550 --> 01:52:01,420
Go large on that. That's not even a good
one. I think it looks like a tremor. Yeah,

1961
01:52:01,421 --> 01:52:06,190
right there. Oh, Jesus Christ. It's like
tremors. Look at that man. I mean that is,

1962
01:52:06,250 --> 01:52:09,490
that doesn't look like a real thing.
That looks like a fake animal.

1963
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:14,500
It looks like the movie
Trevor gets shitty. CGI and
tremor. That's Alexa. Yeah,

1964
01:52:14,501 --> 01:52:16,800
there was earthquakes cause it has worms.
Look at underground.

1965
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:19,420
Just think the movie's awesome.
Shout out to Kevin Bacon.

1966
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:22,510
I was thinking this about the Oscars.
Like go to that one in the lower left.

1967
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:26,800
Look at these fucking teeth. He looks
right to me. I'll kick your teeth, bro.

1968
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:31,930
Sheer fish dock. He's like, I'd be
really happy to eat your ass hole 100%.

1969
01:52:31,931 --> 01:52:35,620
Want to take a bite out of your Dick.
Ever said, man, they're fucking killers.

1970
01:52:35,910 --> 01:52:40,120
We're going to say about
the Oscars though. Oh, I was
thinking in the killers. No,

1971
01:52:40,180 --> 01:52:43,690
I was thinking like,
when are we no one,

1972
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:46,190
it's no one can possibly see all

1973
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:50,240
the movies because we keep
adding to the library every week.

1974
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:52,640
No movies come out,
they don't take movies away.

1975
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:56,180
You have to hit a certain period where
they're going to preview that movie.

1976
01:52:56,181 --> 01:52:58,460
So you're up for the awards.
And that's not what I mean.

1977
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:00,830
I don't care about the Oscars.
I don't care what the awards were saying.

1978
01:53:00,831 --> 01:53:05,831
The number of movies that we produce
as the human race is fucking crazy.

1979
01:53:06,561 --> 01:53:07,400
And it's never ending.

1980
01:53:07,970 --> 01:53:12,380
Like every year they put out
more and movies don't go away.

1981
01:53:12,530 --> 01:53:16,640
So they just, the database, just stacking
and stacking and stacking up the fall.

1982
01:53:16,670 --> 01:53:20,750
And it's only been happening for
a hundred years. Yeah, I mean,

1983
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:22,610
and that was silent in the beginning.
Right?

1984
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:26,960
So there's been a hundred years of these
movies just stacking up and all the

1985
01:53:26,961 --> 01:53:29,370
premises. Like if you think
about premises, like the pro,

1986
01:53:29,390 --> 01:53:31,940
the robots get smart and they
want to kill the people. Okay. Oh,

1987
01:53:31,941 --> 01:53:34,130
the monkeys get smart and they
want to kill the people. Okay.

1988
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,950
Like there's all these premises
that just go, oh, there's worms.

1989
01:53:36,951 --> 01:53:39,710
They live on the ground that caused
earthquakes. I get great movie.

1990
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:43,360
Like this is so many of these.
Amen. Immediately. So many like,

1991
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:47,300
like it's must be so hard to come up
with an original premise for a movie.

1992
01:53:47,301 --> 01:53:50,300
There's so many fucking movies like you
think it's hard to come up with a new

1993
01:53:50,301 --> 01:53:54,050
joke or a new premise for a joke. Well,
the white think movies. What do you think?

1994
01:53:54,051 --> 01:53:57,680
You get like a re creation of
Jumanji rocky and Predator.

1995
01:53:57,681 --> 01:54:01,100
Like they're running out of ideas.
How many buddy buddy movies can we see?

1996
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:03,650
Can we put the Rock Kevin Hart's?
I'll be God damn movies.

1997
01:54:03,651 --> 01:54:07,550
It was just the regurgitation of all
the same shit we've already seen. Yeah.

1998
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:13,310
Yeah. It's, there's so many movies
get, there's not that many paid actors.

1999
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:17,410
Is there like it's a struggle city
less than 1% make it living, acting,

2000
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:18,980
but there's a juggle in movies.

2001
01:54:18,981 --> 01:54:23,060
Is it less than 1% less less
than 1% make a living really?

2002
01:54:23,061 --> 01:54:26,390
Can Movies of all actors?
Yes. Wow, that's crazy.

2003
01:54:26,391 --> 01:54:30,470
Like a quality living of all the actors.
Less than 1% that's pretty crazy.

2004
01:54:30,500 --> 01:54:34,010
Crazy thick.
La Comics make a legit living.

2005
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:39,070
Can you make comics are the difference
being that for a comic it's more up to

2006
01:54:39,111 --> 01:54:41,660
them. Correct. Some more up to them to go.

2007
01:54:41,661 --> 01:54:43,520
And you're a good piece of proof for that.

2008
01:54:43,550 --> 01:54:47,630
Obviously you have the boost of being
famous from the UFC and then being famous

2009
01:54:47,631 --> 01:54:48,830
from your podcast.
Those two,

2010
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:51,410
two things helped you as a
boost but also the hustling.

2011
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:55,400
And that's the thing that like an actor
can hustle, but you have to be hired.

2012
01:54:55,670 --> 01:54:58,430
They gotta be hired to do something
and there's a million moving pieces.

2013
01:54:58,810 --> 01:55:02,600
1 million you gotta track. Well,
your test. Well people have to like,

2014
01:55:02,601 --> 01:55:03,890
you gotta be right for the Royal.

2015
01:55:03,950 --> 01:55:07,970
You could just go up on a showcase night
and do like 15 minutes and kill and

2016
01:55:07,971 --> 01:55:09,190
you're in the money,
you know,

2017
01:55:10,250 --> 01:55:14,900
acting to mother fucker hard Gig
to get good at too, you know,

2018
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:17,900
acting. Yeah. I think
like God to get good at,

2019
01:55:17,901 --> 01:55:19,430
like Daniel Day Lewis style was watching.

2020
01:55:19,431 --> 01:55:23,510
There will be blood the other day and I
was just thinking like this guy like the

2021
01:55:23,511 --> 01:55:26,600
butcher hooding out so many.
Yeah. Ooh, in New York.

2022
01:55:26,601 --> 01:55:31,040
What does that gangs in the area, but I
forgot how good there will be. Blood was,

2023
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:35,960
um, I watched it the other day
in a hotel and uh, I was uh,

2024
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:41,270
near where it happened because I was
doing gigs in Fresno and Bakersfield and

2025
01:55:41,271 --> 01:55:44,160
uh, I didn't know that, but
that to hatch a p mountains,

2026
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:46,140
that's where there will
be bloods all about.

2027
01:55:46,170 --> 01:55:49,500
That's where they were drilling for oil.
That's right over there. Amazing movie,

2028
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:54,240
Dude. I think it's funny sometimes
fighters, whoever, athletes go home,

2029
01:55:54,241 --> 01:55:56,430
I'm going to go to Hollywood,
get into act. I'm like, Ma,

2030
01:55:56,490 --> 01:55:58,230
you need to sit in on a class where you,

2031
01:55:58,231 --> 01:56:01,410
you need to watch someone do like a
dramatic role and see if it's for you.

2032
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:04,020
I mean, you're talking about
it's a legit craftsmen.

2033
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:06,450
Some people are just good at this.

2034
01:56:06,570 --> 01:56:09,380
There's a thing that they're
doing where you're, you are,

2035
01:56:09,390 --> 01:56:14,040
you're compelled by their words peddled
by where they're doing and it's not easy

2036
01:56:14,041 --> 01:56:18,000
to gift, you know? It's not
easy to achieve that spot.
Not a lot of guys do it. No,

2037
01:56:18,001 --> 01:56:22,530
it's a true art that that's why it's so
tough to get cast in those roles in TV

2038
01:56:22,531 --> 01:56:25,020
and movies. There's a reason
why it's so. We've got amped up.

2039
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:26,790
I've been watching that Viking show.

2040
01:56:26,791 --> 01:56:30,360
You watch that Viking show that's on
history, right? All in baby. Yeah.

2041
01:56:30,361 --> 01:56:34,110
You get on apple. I got on
iTunes. It's fucking good, man.

2042
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:37,110
It's good show and it keeps getting
better and they're really good actors.

2043
01:56:37,111 --> 01:56:39,480
I'm on season two right
now. I need some shows, man.

2044
01:56:39,481 --> 01:56:43,050
I ran out while you seen punisher on
Netflix. I have not changed your life.

2045
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:45,540
It's that good. It's, you would love it.

2046
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:49,430
It's a lot of shoot 'em ups Helia
like legit. I just don't like action.

2047
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:54,030
That doesn't do anything for them. I like
a good story. Yeah. Punisher stope rent.

2048
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:58,250
What went through El Chapo
went through narcos. Dual work.

2049
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:00,770
You've never seen the wire. Have you
ever seen the wire seeing the wire?

2050
01:57:00,771 --> 01:57:04,710
I get like season five, that's all there
is. I just did it. Release it in HD,

2051
01:57:04,711 --> 01:57:07,590
so if you haven't seen it you could
watch it. Some people say grace,

2052
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:11,960
it's probably the best series ever.
Ever. Yeah. That's a strong statement.

2053
01:57:11,970 --> 01:57:15,930
Easier for you to say because
I haven't seen it. You fuck.
That's true. It is true.

2054
01:57:15,931 --> 01:57:19,260
That is. It is right. Some
people are making number one
that and soprano's. Right.

2055
01:57:19,450 --> 01:57:23,600
I've seen as a problem number one.
Well that's a problem. Her son,

2056
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:27,480
I saw one episode of the wire. Well
I've seen half an episode of Sopranos.

2057
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:32,640
Sopranos was the show that got me into
binge watching but not binge because you

2058
01:57:32,641 --> 01:57:32,761
know,

2059
01:57:32,761 --> 01:57:37,470
watched every Sunday whenever it was on
or whatever it and HBO night with your

2060
01:57:37,471 --> 01:57:41,310
girl. It was a big, it was a big deal to
sit and watch the sopranos. I was like,

2061
01:57:41,311 --> 01:57:44,970
boy, you would go to the fucking
time I was with game of Thrones.

2062
01:57:45,830 --> 01:57:49,160
It's Brian here.
Yeah.

2063
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:53,580
He has some poor electric
car that he half charges.

2064
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:57,870
How often you think Brian fully charged?
Is that car just in the shop?

2065
01:57:57,871 --> 01:58:00,810
Cause he's like ran into a wall or some
shit. He cheats. His car is like shit.

2066
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:04,020
And then he goes, dude, you think I
should get a Porsche like you and Rogan?

2067
01:58:04,021 --> 01:58:07,200
Like no, absolutely not. Absolutely
not. That's not the guy for you.

2068
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:09,970
He's hitting full on midlife crisis.
Let's, let's encourage it. No,

2069
01:58:09,971 --> 01:58:12,360
I want them to get a yellow
viper like in braces.

2070
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:16,110
Like I want to be that guy in
a Shit Tan and way. Ooh, Viper.

2071
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:20,340
Now he doesn't know how to
drive enough for a viper but he,

2072
01:58:20,341 --> 01:58:25,140
he should drive something that has some
balls. Yeah, Tesla's bummed me out.

2073
01:58:25,170 --> 01:58:27,120
I like the message.
That's just not the car for me.

2074
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:31,080
Does that make any noise problem?
The fact that it doesn't make any noise.

2075
01:58:31,210 --> 01:58:34,050
Don't know why.
I'm just too used to noise too.

2076
01:58:34,051 --> 01:58:35,820
I know we sound like
two cavemen right now,

2077
01:58:35,821 --> 01:58:38,520
but that doesn't have that v
eight or that fee. 10 noise,

2078
01:58:38,521 --> 01:58:41,800
the fees six and let's
say bowl that exhaust,

2079
01:58:46,060 --> 01:58:49,000
there's nothing and I, you know
what, it's pissing me off lately.

2080
01:58:49,001 --> 01:58:52,330
Car Manufacturers have been adding
noise to their cars, like the Maserati.

2081
01:58:52,360 --> 01:58:57,190
They put it in this in the
speakers. What? Yes. In what cars?

2082
01:58:57,191 --> 01:59:01,720
Bmw m three m four does it.
They put in the speakers sound.

2083
01:59:01,721 --> 01:59:05,800
They pumped sound through the speakers.
That's a bitch. As the engine goes up,

2084
01:59:05,801 --> 01:59:07,840
it comes. Some of it's coming
in through the speakers.

2085
01:59:07,841 --> 01:59:09,130
It's like pan abroad as a girl.

2086
01:59:09,131 --> 01:59:12,310
It's apparently some guys have
figured out a way how to cut that out.

2087
01:59:12,670 --> 01:59:16,630
I think what you do turbocharge cars,
turbocharged car.

2088
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:20,740
Can I say that five times turbo car,
turbo charged cars.

2089
01:59:20,950 --> 01:59:23,560
When you have forced induction,
forced hot air induction,

2090
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:25,870
it makes the car a much quieter.

2091
01:59:26,330 --> 01:59:31,250
Doesn't sound nearly as like throaty and
rumbly like my gt three, you know raw.

2092
01:59:31,251 --> 01:59:34,570
That thing sounds because it's
naturally aspirated and you also get

2093
01:59:34,571 --> 01:59:38,310
instantaneous feedback from the,
from the throttle response, the GTA.

2094
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:39,760
That's what you want.
That's what you want.

2095
01:59:39,790 --> 01:59:42,490
When you get into turbo
chargers is all about turbo lag,

2096
01:59:42,700 --> 01:59:46,150
which is why they have twin turbos.
They have one turbo on the low end,

2097
01:59:46,151 --> 01:59:47,080
one turbo on the high end.

2098
01:59:47,081 --> 01:59:50,930
But even at the very best
implementations of turbo chargers,

2099
01:59:51,200 --> 01:59:53,650
there's still a perceptible lag.
Slight lag.

2100
01:59:53,690 --> 01:59:56,770
Slightly getting better and better though
much about Porsche's. Ridiculous. Yeah,

2101
01:59:56,780 --> 02:00:01,630
yeah, yeah. Um, they get,
they're definitely better
than they used to be. Dude.

2102
02:00:01,631 --> 02:00:05,320
How the fuck even up in cars? Uh,
comedians in cars getting coffee.

2103
02:00:05,530 --> 02:00:09,700
Oh I dunno not, no, I did Jay Leno show.

2104
02:00:09,701 --> 02:00:11,220
I've done enough car things.
That's true.

2105
02:00:11,221 --> 02:00:14,380
But let's take the new Porsche and get
on there so I can't believe you're from

2106
02:00:14,381 --> 02:00:17,680
Newport. Literally. I was like, um, I,
I want, I hit you about the podcast.

2107
02:00:17,690 --> 02:00:22,240
I'm just here to see the car and he didn't
bring it has an oil leak. I know. Yeah.

2108
02:00:22,270 --> 02:00:25,870
Well you buy, it's not
new. It's 1991, 1991,

2109
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:29,770
nine six four something.
I wanted to uh,

2110
02:00:29,830 --> 02:00:34,300
fuck around with one of those older cars.
I like those. Love it. They're small.

2111
02:00:34,330 --> 02:00:35,230
They're real small.

2112
02:00:35,290 --> 02:00:37,180
That's one of the weird things
about it when you're around it,

2113
02:00:37,540 --> 02:00:41,410
like those things at tiny a
driver's car. Yeah. I love it.

2114
02:00:41,411 --> 02:00:43,390
Cause you're not going to see it.
No one has it at the,

2115
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:45,970
it's custom to you to Ben as ride.

2116
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,130
There's more of them now
than they have been before.

2117
02:00:48,190 --> 02:00:51,520
People getting a little older cars.
Thanks to your boy Magnus Walker.

2118
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:53,950
Chris Harris had something funny to me.
He said,

2119
02:00:53,951 --> 02:00:56,890
why is it the four years ago I didn't
give a shit about nine six force now I

2120
02:00:56,891 --> 02:00:59,030
think that the best looking cars ever,
there's the,

2121
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:01,980
it goes to Porsche goes through these
phases where this one's cool. Yes.

2122
02:01:01,981 --> 02:01:05,530
So the 68 to 78 73 it's
just these weird phases.

2123
02:01:05,920 --> 02:01:10,030
Well those long hood cars are kind
of always the best looking ones.

2124
02:01:10,031 --> 02:01:15,031
That 19 like 67 to like 70 early seventies
like 72 73 you know they had that

2125
02:01:17,951 --> 02:01:21,250
long hood doesn't ones that magnus
is really into. He's done on a fruit.

2126
02:01:21,300 --> 02:01:25,090
A few of those. We redid them. He made
them cool too. Yeah. Oh yeah. For sure.

2127
02:01:25,630 --> 02:01:27,070
Well his style like that,

2128
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:31,030
that's another level more raw than
when I'm dealing with magnus. Yeah.

2129
02:01:31,031 --> 02:01:33,610
Because his style of, well
he has a nine, six, four,

2130
02:01:33,611 --> 02:01:36,190
two but a lot of what
his older cars where,

2131
02:01:36,191 --> 02:01:40,070
where those 1969 1970 ones and those,
he

2132
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:44,310
would redo those and those cars don't wait
dawg. Shit, they wait like 2000 pounds.

2133
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:49,130
Not like the Porsche purest think like
they're not really into the singers or

2134
02:01:49,131 --> 02:01:51,080
the Magnus Walker.
You know what I'm saying?

2135
02:01:51,130 --> 02:01:54,710
I think your car's in the middle of
that, I think. Yeah, it's not modified.

2136
02:01:54,830 --> 02:01:55,820
It's not like a singer,

2137
02:01:55,821 --> 02:01:58,760
which is completely different and
saying he's got a carbon fiber body.

2138
02:01:58,820 --> 02:02:01,140
I actually think uh,
singers that they might be getting,

2139
02:02:01,141 --> 02:02:03,740
there's a law supports took a lawsuit
out of them because they're selling the

2140
02:02:03,741 --> 02:02:05,630
Porsches,
but they're taking the Porsche logo off,

2141
02:02:05,631 --> 02:02:10,130
put a singer one on now she's in washes
suing them. They have an issue with it.

2142
02:02:10,131 --> 02:02:11,510
Yeah.
That's interesting.

2143
02:02:11,511 --> 02:02:14,750
I thought they liked it because it was
just like bringing back interest in.

2144
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:17,720
I think they lot worship before
you started making it the singer.

2145
02:02:17,750 --> 02:02:20,120
You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Because
what he's doing is taking a nine,

2146
02:02:20,121 --> 02:02:23,090
six four which is that same
year that I'm talking about,

2147
02:02:23,091 --> 02:02:26,630
and then he puts all this other stuff
on it and be set up the suspension and

2148
02:02:26,631 --> 02:02:30,080
beefs up the engine like impossible
to get to their show sick.

2149
02:02:30,110 --> 02:02:35,110
Well now he has a new one that's
starts at one point $5 million.

2150
02:02:35,780 --> 02:02:40,430
Is that it? Jesus Christ.
Fuck we did. I was seeing it.

2151
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:42,740
There's a limited number of
them they're going to make.

2152
02:02:42,770 --> 02:02:46,280
It has a 500 horsepower
naturally aspirated engine.

2153
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:48,590
It's got giant fender flares.

2154
02:02:48,890 --> 02:02:53,270
They just see if you could find
it saying [inaudible] you're in.

2155
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:55,070
Wait till you take a look at this thing.

2156
02:02:55,390 --> 02:02:57,920
Sometimes that like when you send me
pictures of Kaiser getting made some dumb.

2157
02:02:57,921 --> 02:03:01,370
I see. It makes me mad. They're
so sick. It makes you mad.

2158
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:05,060
Like just not enough cars in the world
for me. Yeah. What is it about cars?

2159
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:07,460
I know cars and girls they'd like,
you'll see it.

2160
02:03:07,461 --> 02:03:11,990
You're like God damn right.
It just speaks to DNA and it's,

2161
02:03:11,991 --> 02:03:16,220
it's uh, it's not all men.
Callan, Callan to come in here.

2162
02:03:16,221 --> 02:03:19,460
You could show them that
cause see the dressing room.

2163
02:03:19,940 --> 02:03:23,630
I mean I've had guys walking around the
gym see him cause he's [inaudible] he

2164
02:03:23,631 --> 02:03:25,850
hits that punching thing you have,
cause you gotta break it.

2165
02:03:26,680 --> 02:03:30,480
He's got karate power or would go, you
know what I would but my wrist. Yeah.

2166
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:34,070
Maybe it was that. But this, I
mean some men don't get into it,

2167
02:03:34,071 --> 02:03:37,190
but it's so universal with men.
It's just,

2168
02:03:37,191 --> 02:03:42,140
it's so normal that men like really get
into cars. Why is that? I don't know.

2169
02:03:42,170 --> 02:03:44,420
I don't know what it is. A battle,
especially V eights, right.

2170
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:50,080
I'm not the type of guy where I'll see
a car and my brother's supercar to go

2171
02:03:50,811 --> 02:03:53,150
that thing you're, you're quite
stressed out on the track. I'm like,

2172
02:03:53,151 --> 02:03:55,170
I don't give a shit about the track man.

2173
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:58,760
There's guys who are like those track
guys and I'm just like a road guy.

2174
02:03:58,761 --> 02:04:01,640
Fun Driving car fast enough.
But looks great.

2175
02:04:01,641 --> 02:04:04,940
All about looks and performance tracking.
A lot of people are track guys.

2176
02:04:04,970 --> 02:04:08,720
We should go to the track. The
Porsche. Yeah, we go there.

2177
02:04:08,721 --> 02:04:12,110
We have to take their cars though.
Fuck up their tires. Yeah, that's true.

2178
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:16,850
Not Yours. That's true. He can get
gt three, gt two, eh. All right,

2179
02:04:16,851 --> 02:04:21,440
let's do it. Let's do that. That's
the, that's the second. Come on son.

2180
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:25,280
That does make a dick thing up.
Porsche nine six,

2181
02:04:25,281 --> 02:04:29,180
four dls and this thing is insight.
A better looking car than that though.

2182
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:32,660
You know what I'm saying? Well I'm a, I'm
going to be honest. Those Fukes wheels,

2183
02:04:33,230 --> 02:04:36,620
I always felt like they're not
good enough for that body style.

2184
02:04:36,650 --> 02:04:40,860
I like the look how the wheel wells in
that. I always felt like their classic,

2185
02:04:41,070 --> 02:04:45,750
those folks are quite late and they have
a center locking hubs to see that look

2186
02:04:45,751 --> 02:04:50,400
in the fuck that body on that thing.
They'll fee Ooh and the tail on the back.

2187
02:04:50,430 --> 02:04:53,250
That's the only reason I bought my car
cause the ducktail look at the back end.

2188
02:04:53,251 --> 02:04:58,110
All my God, that might be one of the
best looking cars ever, ever, ever.

2189
02:04:58,140 --> 02:05:01,390
Was the interior like done that to me.
Oh it's phenomenal. It's orange. It's,

2190
02:05:01,391 --> 02:05:03,670
you're going to be orange.
I said look at the center locks man.

2191
02:05:03,780 --> 02:05:06,570
And like people will say, all be
spoke the interior. Look at that.

2192
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:12,000
Jesus Christ. How much is it? 1.6 million.

2193
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:16,710
It makes me want to risk it
all. Yeah, right. Just sign
up for it. If I was Connor,

2194
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:19,320
I do one than Burger King commercials
and buy one of these two different,

2195
02:05:19,321 --> 02:05:22,230
were you? I'd get when these
fucking things. It's not my style.

2196
02:05:23,610 --> 02:05:27,330
That's a little too little too little
clicks on them. We'll take cars. Lipstick.

2197
02:05:27,331 --> 02:05:30,450
Orange saw me do it.
I gotta a silver Bronco already.

2198
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:35,560
I got that silver corvette that I have.

2199
02:05:35,570 --> 02:05:37,350
