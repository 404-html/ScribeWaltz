1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,240
I have dreams.
I have fucking crazy dreams.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,050
I had a dream one time that me and Elvis
walked into his hotel room and there

3
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:12,890
were four dudes,
but fucking right,

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,450
and I just hear me where they were.
Suggestions that might be one of the

5
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:21,450
best sentences ever created.
It's weird.

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,630
Or they're throwing up in Burger King
Cups,

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,790
fucking each other,
and then I as wordy when I say this,

8
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:31,180
I fucking just shut the door.
And I looked at Elvis.

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,690
I go,
what the fuck's going on in your room?

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,470
He said to me,
what's your Dream Baby?

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,180
Oh Shit.
I wake up,

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,170
I wake up.
I'm like,

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,243
wake up.
Check my,

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,770
make sure it's hard.
I'm like,

15
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:47,990
well,
you don't really flipped me out.

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,900
Do you know what really flipped me out?
Not that,

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,920
not that the guys were both fucking
right.

18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,783
They didn't ask.
No.

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,990
It was the product placement.

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,130
Like what the fuck the Burger can do to
get it?

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,260
How the fuck
fucking dream figured it out and you

22
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:07,230
just don't know that they are.
It's way to interject advertising into

23
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:10,770
your dream.
It's the burger king in the future right

24
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:12,480
now.
It's like I got her Chrysler stream

25
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:14,430
about the Elvis and the buck fucking
Haha.

26
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,241
No,
no,

27
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:15,850
no.
But what is,

28
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:20,850
there's a possibility that someone could
insert a product to a dream.

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,390
Right?
But they could give you a cheeseburger

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,030
and in that cheeseburger with some
experimental thing that would make you

31
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:30,750
think about burger king in a dream and
see a burger and a dream,

32
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:31,650
you can do it.
You can do it.

33
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,180
I'm fucking a girl from Geico and shit.
But that doesn't make any sense cause

34
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:38,700
yeah.
Cause it's Geico eat something to have

35
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:40,470
this happen to you.
We're still,

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,230
we're still missing the whole package.
We're stumbling on something very

37
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:43,980
brilliant right now.
