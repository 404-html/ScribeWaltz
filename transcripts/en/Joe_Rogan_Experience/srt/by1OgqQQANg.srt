1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,020
Five four,
three,

2
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:04,854
two,
one.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:08,710
Boom.
And we're live.

4
00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:10,120
Peter Schiff.
How are you sir?

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,500
I am good.
I am good.

6
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:13,420
Thanks for having me back.
Thanks for coming back.

7
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,920
Yeah,
it's been three years.

8
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,050
It has been a while.
You've grown a lot.

9
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:20,020
I'm so impressed with what's happened to
your podcast,

10
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:21,640
your popularity.
Thanks man.

11
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:23,530
Thank you.
Hopefully a little of that trickles down

12
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:24,760
to me.
I'm sure it will.

13
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:26,110
You look good dude.
You look healthy.

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,910
You look at vibrant.
Well,

15
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:29,920
you know,
I got a little bit of a beard going.

16
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:33,400
I've been living in Puerto Rico.
We were talking about that off air.

17
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,840
Tell me about that.
Like what,

18
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,570
what prompted that decision?
Well,

19
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:40,720
you know,
I live in Connecticut and unlike

20
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:44,110
southern California where you are
fortunate enough to still live,

21
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:46,420
I lived here for a long time,
years and years ago.

22
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,010
But uh,
we have,

23
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:49,650
uh,
seasons and uh,

24
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,810
one of them is winter and it tends to be
very long and it normally Kinda,

25
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,300
you know,
kinda moves into the fall and the spring

26
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:55,810
a bit.

27
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,320
And so I had been thinking for years
about kind of splitting my time between

28
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:02,860
Florida and Connecticut because I Love
New England in the summer.

29
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:04,360
It's beautiful this time of year.
Yeah.

30
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,760
And I like the beginning of fall,
you know,

31
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:09,820
with the leaves are still on the trees
and it's not that cold and it's pretty.

32
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,120
And you know,
spring is nice too.

33
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:12,671
So,
but yeah,

34
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:15,730
I can forget all the winter.
So I was going to move to Florida until

35
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:20,590
I found out about Puerto Rico.
And I found out about this actually

36
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:25,591
because I read an article interviewing
John Paulson and Halston was John Paul,

37
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,750
John Paulson,
billionaire hedge fund guy made a lot

38
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:31,480
more money than me shorting subprime.
I did the same trade.

39
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:33,370
I just didn't make as much money as he
did,

40
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,230
uh,
because I didn't start out with nearly

41
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:36,400
as much money,
but in any event,

42
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:37,060
but,
but,

43
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,820
but he made a lot of money shorting
subprime and he's a hedge fund guy.

44
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,140
And,
um,

45
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,750
he was investing down in Puerto Rico and
I was like,

46
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,291
well,
what's he doing?

47
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,700
What's,
what's going on down there?

48
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,700
And I found out,
and I had never known this,

49
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:54,150
that Puerto Rico as a US territory,
Americans who live in Puerto Rico don't

50
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:59,620
have to pay federal income taxes on the
money they earn from Puerto Rico,

51
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,680
which would include any of your capital
gains on your investments.

52
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,300
And I'm like,
wait a minute.

53
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,040
I mean all I have to do is move to
Puerto Rico,

54
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,680
don't have to pay any federal income
taxes cause anybody can move there.

55
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,610
You don't need a,
a,

56
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,420
a,
you know,

57
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,980
a work visa.
You pick up and move there.

58
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:13,850
It's just like moving to another state.
Right.

59
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:17,350
And so the minute you move there,
you don't have to pay federal income

60
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:20,280
taxes,
but Puerto Rico has its own taxes.

61
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,360
So you have to pay the Puerto Rico taxes
instead.

62
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,730
And up until recently,
I mean,

63
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,630
Puerto Rico's income tax,
I think tops out at 30% it's still

64
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:31,720
cheaper than the u s and there's no
state income tax.

65
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:32,740
It's,
that's all you've got,

66
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:35,650
right?
Is that the 30% but a few years ago,

67
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,750
Puerto Rico got smart and they said,
well,

68
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:42,100
how do we attract businessmen,
entrepreneurs to move to Puerto Rico if

69
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:43,180
they're not already here?
Well,

70
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:48,010
let's just drop that income tax down.
And so they basically created these two

71
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,210
laws,
act 29 22 and act 22 is for individuals.

72
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:52,961
And it says,
Hey,

73
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:56,920
if you move to Puerto Rico,
you have zero capital gains tax on any

74
00:02:56,921 --> 00:03:01,660
capital gains and you have zero on any
interest in dividends that you earn

75
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,330
locally.
And then they passed another act,

76
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:05,650
which is at 20 and they said,
hey,

77
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,960
if you open up a business here,
you have a company,

78
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,710
you're going to pay a 4% corporate tax
to Puerto Rico,

79
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,670
and then you can pass on all the profits
in dividends to yourself,

80
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,160
tax free,
no tax in Puerto Rico,

81
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,110
no tax in the United States.

82
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,840
And you know,
that's,

83
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,610
that's a great deal.
That seems to be worth a tremendous

84
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:25,870
amount of money.
It is.

85
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:26,800
I mean,
it depends on,

86
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,140
but you effectively double your income
by moving there practically.

87
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,420
So,
because you're not,

88
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,460
you know,
you're not splitting your income with

89
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:34,280
the government.
Right.

90
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,113
Right.
And,

91
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,651
and,
and,

92
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:38,790
and so I checked it out when I heard out
about front,

93
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,270
heard about,
because first it's like Puerto Rico.

94
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:40,781
Do I,
you know,

95
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:42,010
do I really want to live there?
And you know,

96
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,160
I'm thinking west side story.
I don't know.

97
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,750
But,
um,

98
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,190
you know,
it's beautiful.

99
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,190
I mean,
I live in a town called Dorado beach.

100
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,750
Ah,
and you know,

101
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,740
it's just,
it's very,

102
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:55,080
very nice.
The,

103
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,721
the,
uh,

104
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:59,260
the weather and just the tropical
location and there's a lot of good

105
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:01,690
people there.
A lot of people have been moving there.

106
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:04,150
Obviously I'm not the first person to
take advantage of this.

107
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,990
And so there are a lot of people that
have come from California to get out of,

108
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:10,690
you know,
California taxes or the northeast,

109
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,950
the Midwest,
you know,

110
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,230
plus when you come from the Midwest or
the northeast,

111
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:15,400
you also,
you know,

112
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,260
help yourself get out of the cold
weather,

113
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,170
California.
It's pretty much all a tax thing.

114
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:22,270
I mean,
no one's leaving southern California,

115
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,880
uh,
other than really the taxes because you

116
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,920
got such great weather here.
Um,

117
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,551
but I,
I,

118
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:29,440
we enjoy living there.
My wife enjoys it.

119
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:31,300
She's met a lot of people.
I've met a lot of people.

120
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:32,530
And you know,
the crazy thing is,

121
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:34,900
you know,
you have this movement now in Puerto

122
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,800
Rico where they want to become a state,
which is ridiculous because if they

123
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:41,770
became a state,
all the problems they have would be that

124
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:44,230
much worse because Puerto Rico is in
trouble today,

125
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,310
despite the fact that you don't have to
pay federal income taxes there.

126
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,380
I mean,
that what happened was the Puerto Rican

127
00:04:50,381 --> 00:04:52,150
government is,
which was very socialist.

128
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,250
They borrowed a lot of money and they,
you know,

129
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,290
they,
they spend a lot of money to get

130
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,460
elected.
And uh,

131
00:04:57,461 --> 00:04:59,200
you know,
a lot of people in Puerto Rico work for

132
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:01,540
the government and a lot of people are
on welfare,

133
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:05,380
food stamps and stuff like that.
But big government is what destroyed the

134
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:06,590
Puerto Rican economy.
And they,

135
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,610
and they borrowed a lot of money.
But if on top of that,

136
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,960
Puerto Rican residents that actually had
jobs had to pay the federal income tax,

137
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,490
you know,
it's not just the federal income tax

138
00:05:15,491 --> 00:05:17,980
doesn't apply down there.
It's the obamacare tax.

139
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,930
You know,
people wanted obamacare repealed.

140
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,110
If you move to Puerto Rico,
you've repealed it for yourself because

141
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,900
the taxes don't apply down there.
They don't even have to pay the federal

142
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:28,540
gas tax.
So without all those taxes,

143
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:29,470
they're still in trouble.

144
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,890
So can you imagine how much worse it
would be if they had all these taxes?

145
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:36,070
If all of a sudden the irs descended on,
on Puerto Rico,

146
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:37,570
like an infestation of,
you know,

147
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,320
mosquitoes and be worse than the Zika
virus down there to have the irs.

148
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,160
Uh,
so,

149
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,300
but you know,
there's people,

150
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,980
they've told a lot of people,
hey,

151
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:47,290
if we become a state,
you'll get more welfare.

152
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,651
Like,
oh,

153
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:51,700
so vote to become a state.
But what Puerto Rico,

154
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,240
the last thing they need is a more,
more incentives to be on welfare.

155
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,320
Right?
They need freedom.

156
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:59,000
They need less government.
They need to default on a lot of this

157
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,680
debt.
And a lot of the people that own the

158
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:02,570
bonds unfortunately have to lose some
money.

159
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,290
But I think that as more and more people
move to Puerto Rico,

160
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,440
I've got two businesses down there now.
I'm hiring people,

161
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,700
I'm renting space.

162
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,020
I bought a lot of property down there.
You know,

163
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,830
more and more people like me as people
come to Puerto Rico,

164
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:17,960
the economy's going to improve,
it's going to get better.

165
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,730
Uh,
but if they become a state,

166
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:21,250
they're going to destroy all that
potential.

167
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:24,080
They,
they have to exploit the fact that

168
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:27,890
Puerto Rico can offer such a great
advantage to a businessman.

169
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,490
Somebody he wants to create a company,
employee,

170
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:35,390
people provide goods and services.
They can do it in Puerto Rico.

171
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,160
I know on a,
on a much favorable,

172
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,350
uh,
basis relative to anywhere in the

173
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:41,840
continental United States.
So this is a recent thing for you.

174
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:43,250
How long have you been down there for?
Well,

175
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,340
I moved by asset management company.
So I have a company called Euro Pacific

176
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:49,070
asset management.
And I moved that company from southern

177
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:51,350
California.
I was based in Newport beach with that

178
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:56,351
business and I moved to San Juan I think
in 2013 and then I moved to Toronto.

179
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,260
So I have my office there and I moved
all my portfolio managers,

180
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:04,130
they all moved from California to Puerto
Rico.

181
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,990
That's going to be a tough sell.
You know,

182
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,990
they love it down there.
But was it difficult to convince people

183
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:11,780
to pack up to which essentially another
country?

184
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,090
It's not really,
but it kind of it it's America.

185
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:16,910
But yeah,
technically it's not like that kind of a

186
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:17,870
situation.
Yeah,

187
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:20,330
well it's the same status,
but I've never been to Guam.

188
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,390
But I mean you do feel,
it does feel a little bit like a foreign

189
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,210
country when,
because English is the second language.

190
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:28,760
Everybody is speaking Spanish.
So in a way,

191
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:29,990
you know,
but all you look around,

192
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,540
it's all the same restaurants.
It's all the same stores.

193
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,580
So it's American in,
in

194
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,891
all the malls,
you know,

195
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,860
the same malls.
And so there's a lot of ex,

196
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,790
not really ex pats because they were
actually still in America.

197
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,140
Yeah.
You do not renounce your citizenship

198
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,620
when you move to Puerto Rico.
You do not have to pay an exit tax.

199
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,860
I you still travel on on an on a US
passport.

200
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,510
Everybody that lives there is an
American.

201
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:55,640
So it's like a sweeter deal than moving
to Hawaii.

202
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,450
Well Hawaii you got high taxes,
you're still paying federal income

203
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:00,500
taxes.
Paradise.

204
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,450
Yeah.
Plus you're paying the state income

205
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:04,130
taxes in Hawaii.
So,

206
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,340
but you know,
my guys wanted to move there cause it

207
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:10,400
basically almost meant that their income
was going to double like pretty much

208
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:12,740
overnight cause they can participate in
these tax breaks.

209
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:14,420
But you know,
my,

210
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,360
one of my guys is married,
has some kids and you know,

211
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:19,760
they really like it.
My single employees,

212
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:22,130
I have a few young guys you know,
you know,

213
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,660
good shape working out,
you know,

214
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:26,180
young portfolio managers but they've,
you know,

215
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,040
they quickly got Puerto Rican
girlfriends.

216
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,110
You know,
if you've got a job down there that's a

217
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:33,320
big plus because most of the Puerto
Rican guys and out of you know this,

218
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:37,460
but I think five of the miss universes
of kind of Puerto Rico.

219
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,850
I mean it's,
it's a small little island country,

220
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:42,980
but they got some beautiful women down
there in Puerto Rico.

221
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,920
It sounds like you're a salesperson for
Puerto Rico a lot.

222
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,670
I should.
I've said so many people down there.

223
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,860
A lot of people have moved there because
to me,

224
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:54,150
I run into people all the time.
They see me on the beach.

225
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:56,100
You have to Hell Pete.
You know that you're the reason that I'm

226
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:58,130
here because they heard about it.
But,

227
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,011
but look,
it's a,

228
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:00,570
it's a good deal.
And you know,

229
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,750
I would love to see Puerto Rico succeed
as a mecca of free market capitalism

230
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:07,110
right now.
You know,

231
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,190
it's a poster child for the failures of
socialism because they,

232
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,240
it's the socialist that killed Puerto
Rico,

233
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:15,330
just like they're killing a lot of major
cities in the United States.

234
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,620
But if we get more entrepreneurs,
more business people are coming to

235
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:21,040
Puerto Rico,
you know,

236
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,580
that is what Puerto Rico needs.
They don't need to be a state,

237
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:25,860
they don't need the irs.
They don't need more government.

238
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,980
They need the opposite of that.
So you learn in Spanish or are you just

239
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:32,190
sort of standing around?
Well,

240
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:32,701
I mean,
we're doing it.

241
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:33,990
They're all Americans.
Americans.

242
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,180
But I mean,
I speak English.

243
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:36,630
I mean,
I,

244
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,610
I took high school Spanish,
so you know,

245
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,560
if I go through a dry through,
you know,

246
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:43,470
I got to try to use my Spanish because a
lot of times they don't speak.

247
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:44,430
But,
um,

248
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,040
and no one,
if you talk to someone from the police

249
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,290
or the fire department of those guys
speak any English.

250
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,630
But most of the younger people,
they've learned English.

251
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:53,910
And where I live,
it's everybody speaks English.

252
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:56,400
I mean,
nobody addresses me once I get out of

253
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,320
the gates of the rich,
you know,

254
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,690
Rich Carlton,
you know,

255
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,610
I go out into a movie theater,
they're,

256
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:04,140
you know,
they're speaking Spanish.

257
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,610
And then if I say,
do you speak English,

258
00:10:05,611 --> 00:10:06,900
then they'll talk.
But where I live,

259
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:08,520
everybody addresses everybody in
English.

260
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:10,260
So in that respect,
you know,

261
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,200
you're still there.
So you live in like a gated area that's

262
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:14,350
a part of the Ritz Carlton.
Yeah,

263
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,710
it's a gated community,
but it's very large.

264
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,230
You know,
we have a lot of golf course,

265
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:21,030
so I think three or four golf courses
were on the beach and there's,

266
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:22,580
you know,
a lot of different places to live there.

267
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,860
Any resentment from the locals?
Not that I can feel.

268
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,670
I mean,
because I mean,

269
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,650
I know some of the locals could feel,
hey,

270
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:31,050
these guys are coming in here.
They're not paying a lot of taxes,

271
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,940
but I pay a lot of taxes as a,
just a raw number.

272
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:38,520
It's not a big percentage of what I
earn,

273
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,940
but it's a big number relative to what
other people might be paying.

274
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,410
But you know,
I'm doing all,

275
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:44,700
I'm hiring people.
As I said,

276
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:47,280
I rented office space.
I mean I bought a house,

277
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:48,870
I bought a condo.
I'm going out.

278
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:50,760
So I mean they benefit,
they like having,

279
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:53,160
if you're,
if you like having people doing stuff

280
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,660
and in,
so I don't,

281
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:56,160
I don't,
I don't see it at all.

282
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,070
Now if it becomes a state status,
if it changes status,

283
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:00,600
will you move?
I don't know.

284
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:01,560
We'll see.
I might have to,

285
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,161
I mean,
it might not.

286
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,770
I mean,
it won't be nearly as lucrative and see,

287
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:06,750
here's going to be the problem.
If they ever became a state,

288
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,200
see people that live there pay a 30%
income tax.

289
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,550
Now you know,
for to,

290
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:12,600
not,
not people like me,

291
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,370
but the people that were already there.
So it kind of like in California you

292
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:22,290
have 10 13% income tax.
But imagine if you had to pay a 30%

293
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,560
local tax and the federal income tax on
top of that.

294
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,730
I mean they have a 13% sales tax now,
if they have a higher sales tax.

295
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,650
So they have,
if they became a state,

296
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,280
they would be by far the highest tax
state in the United States.

297
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,610
They mean a disaster.
Right now they have the lowest taxes in

298
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:40,320
the United States.
So why would you want to go from having

299
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:42,180
the lowest taxes to having the highest
taxes?

300
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:42,870
It's,
it'd be,

301
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,730
it'd be suicide to become a state.
Yeah.

302
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:48,210
So they would have their local taxes and
then on top of that they would have

303
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:51,390
federal taxes.
Local taxes are fairly high in terms of

304
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:52,510
like a local state.
Yes.

305
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,710
As much higher.
Right?

306
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,010
But

307
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,530
then on top of that,
they don't have federal taxes.

308
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:56,890
Right.

309
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:59,050
And you know,
the other thing is Puerto Rico has a lot

310
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,040
of debt.
I mentioned that,

311
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,110
right?
But on a per capita basis,

312
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,530
they actually have a lot less debt than
America does.

313
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,310
I mean,
your share of the national debt right,

314
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:13,210
is much bigger than the average Puerto
Rican share of the Puerto Rico debt.

315
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,230
Because when you live in California,
not only are you responsible for the

316
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:19,600
state's debt,
you're responsible for the national

317
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:21,280
debt.
The people in Puerto Rico,

318
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:22,900
I'm not responsible for the national
debt.

319
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,170
So if they actually became a state,
they would be in worse shape than they

320
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:27,910
are now.
They would actually have more debt.

321
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,720
Right.
So it's like it'd be like buying a

322
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:33,880
ticket on the titanic after you've
already,

323
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:36,070
you know,
it hit the iceberg yet you still want to

324
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:37,840
buy tickets.
So hopefully this is all a bunch of

325
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,920
politics and it won't become,
it won't become a state and it'll just

326
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:42,910
continue,
you know,

327
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,300
they'll default on a lot of this debt.
Hopefully they'll prioritize a lot of

328
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:47,230
things.
Uh,

329
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,160
they'll shrink the government and more
and more people like me will come in and

330
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:54,190
start creating businesses and hiring
people and you know,

331
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,190
five to 10 years from now,
maybe you'll be the wealthiest part of

332
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:57,770
the united,

333
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,890
so correct me if I'm wrong,
but the two possibilities are,

334
00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:03,770
it becomes a state and they get more
welfare.

335
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:07,050
They get more essentially more aid,
more money.

336
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:10,580
Yes.
Or it stays where it is and more people

337
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:14,570
like you have an incentive to go there
and then entrepreneurs open a businesses

338
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,740
and then there's more opportunities and
then the general wealth of the island

339
00:13:18,741 --> 00:13:22,080
grows and that it helps people just by
virtue of more.

340
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,280
Yeah,
you got it.

341
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,890
Becoming a state just means a bigger
welfare state.

342
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,030
It means a greater incentive not to work
and a bigger punishment if you work

343
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:34,140
because the taxes on people,
that work will go sky high,

344
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,170
you know?
So that's going to be a huge problem if

345
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,090
you know.
So good.

346
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,520
The problem that the appeal of being a
state is that so many people don't work.

347
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,830
But you know,
one thing that we could do to help

348
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:47,100
Puerto Rico is get rid of the minimum
wage because they're stuck with our

349
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:50,790
minimum wage,
which is a disaster because the average

350
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,070
income,
the average wage in Puerto Rico is about

351
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,030
half of what it is in the United States.
And so the minimum wage of seven 25 is

352
00:13:57,031 --> 00:13:59,400
like having a minimum wage of $15 an
hour.

353
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,010
And if you're one of those people that
likes a $15 minimum wage,

354
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,030
look at how high the unemployment is
down there because you can't,

355
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,970
you know,
you people can't get jobs at,

356
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:10,140
at these,
at these wages.

357
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,930
You know,
the best example too of America

358
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:17,160
destroying one of it's a possessions
with the minimum wage was American

359
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:18,450
Samoa.
I don't know if you've ever read this,

360
00:14:18,451 --> 00:14:20,580
but a few years ago,
uh,

361
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,600
Congress applied the minimum wage to all
the territories are minimum wage,

362
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,540
which included American Samoa and in
American Samoa,

363
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,060
the biggest employers on the island
where these tuna canners and so chicken,

364
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:35,340
you know,
chicken of the sea or star cast.

365
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,390
And so all these people worked in these
factories canning the tuna and they

366
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:40,440
worked in,
in,

367
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:41,730
um,
in American Samoa.

368
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,370
Well,
when the mirror and minimum wage was

369
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:47,310
passed it,
it made the island uncompetitive.

370
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,490
And so the tuna factories closed down
and fired everybody.

371
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,570
And so all of a sudden there was like
30% unemployment.

372
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,300
The island went into a massive
depression and they still haven't come

373
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:56,751
out of it.
I mean,

374
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:59,210
we destroyed them,
we destroyed all their jobs.

375
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,580
And the,
the,

376
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:02,580
you know,
the American Samoa didn't want the

377
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:03,740
minimum wage,
but you know,

378
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:07,520
American politicians don't give a damn
and all they care about is feeling good

379
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:09,980
about themselves,
not about the consequences of what they

380
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:11,060
do.
And so they,

381
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:11,431
you know,
they,

382
00:15:11,431 --> 00:15:14,000
they impose that minimum wage and it was
like declaring war.

383
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,760
Well,
it had a lot of damage in Puerto Rico,

384
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,370
just not as much as it did in American
Samoa.

385
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,070
But if we can get rid of that minimum
wage in Puerto Rico,

386
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,160
then there'd be a lot more employment
opportunities for younger,

387
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:28,520
unskilled people.
They'd have the opportunity to climb up

388
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:32,120
the job ladder to get some skills so
they can earn more money in the future.

389
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,340
But right now they're just permanently
unemployed.

390
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,331
Uh,
because of that,

391
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:37,250
so we could get rid of the minimum wage.
Also,

392
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:38,930
there's the Jones Act,
which has really,

393
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:40,250
really hurts Puerto Rico.

394
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,090
And what that Jones Act that says is
that any ship,

395
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,540
right.
And that that's going to America.

396
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,900
They can't stop in Puerto Rico,
drop a few things off,

397
00:15:50,901 --> 00:15:52,730
and then continue on to the United
States.

398
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,620
They have to,
they have to go all the way to the

399
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,660
United States,
unload their cargo,

400
00:15:56,661 --> 00:16:00,320
that's going to Puerto Rico,
put it on a US flag ship with a u s

401
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:02,630
crew,
and then send it back to Puerto Rico.

402
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,460
And it costs a fortune.
Right.

403
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:07,760
So that's one of the reasons that their
tourism is not that competitive there.

404
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,800
Because all the other Caribbean islands
can get cheap stuff dropped off on

405
00:16:12,801 --> 00:16:14,590
boats.
But you know,

406
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,510
we have to wait for stuff to come on a
Jones act boat.

407
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:20,930
And so it,
what was the incentive to pass the Jones

408
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:22,820
act?
It's for the unions,

409
00:16:22,821 --> 00:16:24,890
the Maritime Union,
the merchant marine to try to,

410
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:27,920
because you know American ships are
uncompetitive.

411
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,870
Like if you ever go on a cruise on,
if you go on a cruise,

412
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:33,530
but none of these cruise ships are
flagged in the United States and none of

413
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:36,410
the crews are American.
That's because if you had to use an

414
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:40,130
American crew with our laws,
nobody could afford to cruise.

415
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,130
It would be too expensive.
The only way that you can have a cruise

416
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:47,420
line that anybody can afford the travel
on is if you flag it in some other

417
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:48,740
country.
Well,

418
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,350
so because the wages are just off the
charts,

419
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,890
but that Jones act means if people in
Puerto Rico,

420
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,660
you know,
whatever they're going to buy,

421
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:59,420
whatever they're going to consume in
order to bring it to that island,

422
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,280
you know,
they're going to have to bring it on a,

423
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,970
on a US flag ship.
Now it that,

424
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,800
that's a problem for Hawaii too.
But the people in Hawaii are much richer

425
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,750
on average and the people in Puerto
Rico,

426
00:17:08,751 --> 00:17:12,380
so the poor you are,
the more you're affected by,

427
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,600
by higher food costs are higher,
you know,

428
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,280
costs of everything.
So it's,

429
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:17,180
you know,
you have a lot of these,

430
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:18,440
you know,
liberal politicians,

431
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,480
they refuse to get rid of these laws.
But that would,

432
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:23,600
would very much help Puerto Rico just
more free markets cause they,

433
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,080
they have no control over that federal
minimum wage where the or that Jones

434
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,190
Act.

435
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,410
So you don't think there should be any
minimum wage at all?

436
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,220
No,
no,

437
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,270
no.
None boat.

438
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:34,330
So someone working for a dollar an hour,
it doesn't bother you.

439
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,430
Well,
I mean it's better than working for

440
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,264
zero.
I mean,

441
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,550
people think that,
um,

442
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:39,961
you know,
they,

443
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:41,770
they want to impose their morals and
say,

444
00:17:41,771 --> 00:17:44,080
well,
it's not right for somebody to work for

445
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,640
a dollar an hour.
Well,

446
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,400
you know,
people make rational decisions,

447
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,740
right?
And so somebody

448
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,450
is accepting a dollar an hour and that
must mean that nobody offered them a

449
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:56,430
dollar 50.
Nobody offered them $2.

450
00:17:56,431 --> 00:17:57,720
I mean,
this is a competitive,

451
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,220
a market.
I mean,

452
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:00,840
I know you have an employee over here.
I mean,

453
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:03,300
could you pay this guy a dollar an hour
when he worked for you?

454
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,201
I don't think so.
Yeah.

455
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:05,880
Well a got,
because he could get more.

456
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,983
Right.
But he's,

457
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,400
he's educated and skilled and he's an
engineer and of course,

458
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,290
right.
But it's very difficult for people to

459
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,050
get that sort of an education,
particularly in wwe is Puerto Rico

460
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:19,350
thought of as a third world environment
and so country third world.

461
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:22,980
But let's say some kid came in here that
had no experience whatsoever,

462
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:26,150
but he wanted to learn.
He wanted to just get you coffee and

463
00:18:26,151 --> 00:18:29,160
just sit around and be around you.
He's not that productive.

464
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,240
Yeah.
They use the interns,

465
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:30,450
right?

466
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,670
A lot of radio stations do that and they
don't pay them anything.

467
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,490
I know that $0 million and I can't do
that.

468
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,710
Well then yeah,
but maybe you pay him $5 now,

469
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:39,050
whatever it is,
but people,

470
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,570
people are going to accept a job.
That's the best one they can get,

471
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,260
and so if somebody is working for a
dollar an hour or $2 an hour,

472
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,110
by default,
I know that they couldn't find a higher

473
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,450
job than that.
And the reason is because they don't

474
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:53,940
have a lot of skills.
But if you don't have a lot of skills,

475
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,790
the best thing you can do is get a job
so you can get some skills.

476
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,970
That's where you learn skills,
you get more skills.

477
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:02,010
You know there are people that pay to
get skills,

478
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:03,210
right?
If you go to school,

479
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,900
you actually have to pay tuition.
If I'm getting paid a dollar an hour

480
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:08,760
while I learned something that has
value,

481
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,450
that's better.

482
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,360
You have people now borrowing money to
learn a skill.

483
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,400
People Graduate College and they're in
debt,

484
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,270
right?
It's not a weird,

485
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,200
that's a weird argument,
right?

486
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:18,180
Because you're assuming that they're
going to get a skill.

487
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:20,280
I mean,
they might just be handling packages and

488
00:19:20,281 --> 00:19:22,050
picking them up and moving to another
location.

489
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,770
That's a whole or well,
even that's like show up on time,

490
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,860
be responsible.
So disciplines and showed a lot of work.

491
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,620
There's a lot of stuff that you learn
when you have a job,

492
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:36,621
but the problem with the minimum wage is
that the minimum wage basically hurts

493
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,800
the very people that it's intended to
help because the minimum wage basically

494
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:45,801
says if you are a worker,
if you cannot convince an employer to

495
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:49,660
pay you seven 25 or $10 an hour,
whatever the minimum wage,

496
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,080
then you cannot accept that job.
See,

497
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:53,760
it doesn't hurt the employer.

498
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,270
It hurts the employee because it limits
his options.

499
00:19:57,271 --> 00:20:00,920
It limits his ability to sell his Labor,
uh,

500
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:05,880
for the highest price that he can get.
And it limits his access to the job

501
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:06,361
market.
It's a,

502
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:07,890
you know,
you can't get on that ladder.

503
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,580
You,
you know,

504
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,600
you remove the lower rungs.
And so I can't climb up because of this

505
00:20:12,601 --> 00:20:14,320
arbitrary minimum wage.
Uh,

506
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,580
because when you pass a minimum wage,
you're not going to force an employer,

507
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,070
right?
If I'm an employer and there's a minimum

508
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:25,071
wage of $10 an hour and somebody comes
to me and they can deliver $5 an hour

509
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:28,500
worth of productivity,
meaning if I hire that person that will

510
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:32,310
benefit me by $5 an hour,
I'm not going to pay them $10 an hour

511
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:36,150
because then I lose $5 an hour.
The only way I'm going to hire somebody

512
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,810
who's going to give me $5 an hour worth
of productivity is if I can buy them.

513
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,750
If I can,
you know,

514
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,160
hire him for less than $5 an hour so I
can make a profit.

515
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,290
So it just,
it sits like a floor.

516
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:51,010
It's like if you cannot deliver enough
productivity of whatever that minimum

517
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:52,450
wages,
then you can't get a job.

518
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,620
And so it's basically making it illegal
for people to work.

519
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:59,920
It is the stupidest law that anybody has
ever conceived.

520
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,660
A,
it should be obliterated.

521
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:02,650
I mean,
there are some countries,

522
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:04,660
like Singapore does not have a minimum
wage.

523
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,210
And you know,
the average income in Singapore is

524
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:10,360
higher than it is here per capita.
There's a lot more millionaires there.

525
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:11,920
I mean,
people have no problem.

526
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,290
We didn't always have a minimum wage in
the United States.

527
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,380
I mean,
this is a creation of government and you

528
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:17,981
know,
but the,

529
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:20,380
the initial minimum wages,
if you want to actually go to the

530
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:22,390
origins of minimum wage in the United
States,

531
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:27,570
it was about trying to prevent employers
from hiring the Chinese or hiring

532
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:28,750
blacks.

533
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,780
They were trying to force them in ways
as a way to create unemployment.

534
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,280
It wasn't,
there wasn't a,

535
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,980
a good motivation.
But yes,

536
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:37,910
when they try to sell it to the voters,
oh,

537
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:40,450
it was all about,
we don't want people to be exploited,

538
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,510
but you know,
it's not exploitation of people

539
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,870
voluntarily accept the job because it's
the best job they can find.

540
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,500
The person who's offering the best job
is not exploiting them.

541
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,860
They're giving them an opportunity.
And if you're denied an opportunity,

542
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,880
I mean,
there are a lot of people,

543
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,470
oh great.
You know they're going to get the

544
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:58,510
minimum wage up to $15 an hour.
Well,

545
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:01,090
what good is it being unemployed at $15
an hour?

546
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:06,100
It's better to be employed at $5 an hour
than unemployed at 15 because being

547
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:08,230
unemployed means you make nothing.
Right.

548
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,550
We're devil's advocate would be that if
you can't afford to pay someone $15 an

549
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,540
hour,
then you probably shouldn't have

550
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:14,590
employees in the first place.

551
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,120
Your Business doesn't function that
well.

552
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,400
No,
there are plenty of sense.

553
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,650
No,
because there are plenty of jobs where

554
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,690
you have entry level positions.
I mean,

555
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:25,660
if you think that there should be no
entry level jobs,

556
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:30,661
I mean you go back to the days of a full
service gas stations right?

557
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:33,910
Back in the day when you know you didn't
have to pump your own gas till the case

558
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:36,760
in New Jersey and a few other states,
New Jersey,

559
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:37,690
you know,
they mandate it,

560
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:39,520
but you still don't get the level of
service.

561
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:41,590
I mean,
if you've pulled into a gas station 40

562
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:44,020
years ago,
not only did they pump your gas,

563
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:45,970
but they checked under your hood.
They,

564
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,650
I used to do it.
Tires,

565
00:22:47,651 --> 00:22:48,210
you're,
you're,

566
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:48,641
you're,
you're,

567
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:49,061
you're,
you know,

568
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:50,860
they,
they watched your windows,

569
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,140
you know,
they did all sorts of things.

570
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,000
Uh,
you know,

571
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,470
with your car,
they didn't make very much money.

572
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,130
They lived off of tips.
By and large it was the minimum wage

573
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:02,890
that eliminated almost all those jobs.
It's a minimum wage.

574
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,150
That is the reason that we have,
you know,

575
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,290
people sell so much self serve.
But what happened,

576
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:11,590
a lot of these people,
these kids that worked in filling

577
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:15,910
stations became mechanics because all
these filling stations had a mechanic

578
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,700
there and they,
they learned auto mechanics and a lot of

579
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:21,610
them went on to own their own gas
stations.

580
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:24,070
But of course a lot of them,
this was their work experience that

581
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,230
formed the basis for the rest of their
life.

582
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,960
A lot of young kids had these jobs,
summer jobs.

583
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,010
And so there's nothing wrong with a
entry level employment.

584
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,190
There's nothing wrong with people
learning the responsibility of having a

585
00:23:36,191 --> 00:23:39,520
job of showing up of customer service of
mean.

586
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:41,650
My first jobs were all sales.

587
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,630
I was selling subscriptions door to
door.

588
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,760
I was telephone sales of this,
the z channel and California.

589
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,250
I sold,
I was knocking on doors selling cable

590
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:52,460
television.
I worked in a shoe store selling shoes.

591
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,840
I mean,
but hustler.

592
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,180
But you were talking about you as a
young man,

593
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:57,980
right?
That's a lot of people think of the

594
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:01,760
minimum wage as applied to adults.
Adults that have to take care of

595
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:03,740
children,
that I have to have a roof over their

596
00:24:03,741 --> 00:24:06,380
head and food on the table.
And you're saying that that,

597
00:24:06,381 --> 00:24:08,450
that they shouldn't be having those
jobs.

598
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,790
Well by the time you are an adult with
kids,

599
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,870
you should have accumulated the skills
to earn a lot more than a minimum wage.

600
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,210
So that's the argument when people say,
Hey,

601
00:24:17,211 --> 00:24:19,790
you can't afford a family.
You can't support a family on the

602
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,430
minimum wage.
Of course you shouldn't even be trying

603
00:24:22,431 --> 00:24:25,610
to support a family if you can only earn
the minimum wage.

604
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,270
You shouldn't have a family.
You,

605
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,370
you should realize,
hey,

606
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:32,660
I can't afford a family yet.
Let me acquire the skills before I start

607
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:34,250
fathering children.
Right?

608
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:35,360
And,
and getting married,

609
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,700
let me make sure I can support myself.
I mean,

610
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:39,800
a lot of people who are having the
minimum wage,

611
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,700
they're living at home,
they're there.

612
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,200
They,
you know,

613
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,540
they don't need to pay the rent.
They're living rent free.

614
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:47,450
What they need is a job they need maybe
gas money,

615
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,520
get some money.
So I could take a girl out on a date,

616
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,650
but I gotta I gotta get some work
experience.

617
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:54,110
I got to get out there,
I got to know what it's like to work.

618
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,220
I got to see,
you know,

619
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:58,040
I've got to live in the real world and
that's what used to happen.

620
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,960
I mean,
you don't have all these summer jobs

621
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:02,360
anymore.
Kids don't have the opportunity because

622
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:04,190
the minimum wage has already priced them
out.

623
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,080
A lot of older people now we're taking
those,

624
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,410
those jobs and so the,
the employment opportunities aren't

625
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:11,300
there.
But when you just raised the in wage,

626
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,380
all you're doing is raising the bar
where you can get your job.

627
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:16,610
You're not helping people.
Now,

628
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,920
there is always going to be some people
that,

629
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:20,600
yeah,
there's going to be somebody who will

630
00:25:20,601 --> 00:25:22,550
make a little bit more because of the
minimum wage.

631
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,560
There's going to be those people,
there's gonna be some winners,

632
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,830
but you're going to have lots of people
that make nothing because of the minimum

633
00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:29,060
wage.
And then of course,

634
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,020
because you're driving up the cost of
labor prices are going up.

635
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:35,420
And so who is affected the most by
higher prices,

636
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,820
poor people.
People who are working on minimum wage.

637
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,350
Uh,
and not only that,

638
00:25:39,351 --> 00:25:40,880
you end up with less quality.
I mean,

639
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:42,470
you know,
I hate it when,

640
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:45,440
you know,
I call up a company and I'm just in

641
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:46,010
voice mail.

642
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,090
Hell and I'm going from one I would like
a real person to deal with.

643
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:51,860
But you know,
with the minimum wage,

644
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,500
those jobs don't exist.
There's so many jobs that have been

645
00:25:54,501 --> 00:25:58,610
automated out of existence because not
automated shipped overseas where there

646
00:25:58,611 --> 00:26:00,830
isn't any minimum that too.
I mean that too.

647
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:01,664
Yeah.
You end up,

648
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,920
if you actually get a real person there
in India,

649
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,641
right,
right.

650
00:26:04,641 --> 00:26:07,220
But we have all these people in America
who aren't working,

651
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:09,020
why can't they do those jobs?
Yes.

652
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:11,390
You're not going to be able to support a
family on those jobs.

653
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:15,870
But before you even get a family,
you can have that job and then maybe you

654
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:17,690
know,
five or 10 years later you'll work your

655
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:19,120
way up the ladder,
you'll get a skill,

656
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,580
then you can support a family,
but nobody is supposed to be able to

657
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,680
support a family and if you try to tell
an employer,

658
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,603
hey,
you gotta,

659
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,910
you gotta pay your fry,
Cook enough money to support a family,

660
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,370
you can't do that.
There's not enough productivity cooking

661
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:34,070
French fries.
You can't support a family family.

662
00:26:34,071 --> 00:26:37,550
If all you can do is cook a French fry,
you need to learn how to do something

663
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:39,710
else before you can support a family and
you can't,

664
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:43,890
you can't put that on the employer.
Now when you say that Singapore has a

665
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,600
higher average income is,
is that because and no minimum wage?

666
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:51,120
Is that because there's a shitload of
billionaires that have moved to

667
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:53,870
Singapore because they don't have a
minimum wage because they're getting

668
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,730
explore.
No lower class people or people that

669
00:26:56,731 --> 00:26:59,970
don't make much money.
The millionaires and billionaires don't

670
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:02,070
eve are really not even affected by the
minimum wage.

671
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,540
What you'd have to look at is the rate
of unemployment rates in Singapore

672
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,360
sentence for very rich people to move
there.

673
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,590
And doesn't that Jack up the minimum
wage or not the minimum wage rather than

674
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:13,830
the average income?
Yeah.

675
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:16,890
Well the fact that you have
entrepreneurs that are succeeding in

676
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:20,490
Singapore because they have small
government and low taxes means that

677
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:22,680
there's a lot of competition for
workers.

678
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,780
And so that's what bids up wages,
right?

679
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:27,180
Competition.
I mean I've got no problem with a

680
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:29,310
vibrant market bidding up wages.

681
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,330
You just don't want the government to
try to artificially force wages above

682
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:34,370
their productivity.
Right.

683
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,720
Because it's ultimately your
productivity that determines your wages.

684
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,910
You mentioned that you know,
your,

685
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:39,960
your,
your employee here,

686
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,080
he has a lot of ads,
a lot of value because of his knowledge,

687
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:44,680
because of his personal good.
Look at,

688
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,540
look at Samsung.
Well that doesn't,

689
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,590
that doesn't help me.
But uh,

690
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,800
but you know,
and you're like,

691
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:54,480
we're laughing.
But there are a lot of people,

692
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:55,980
look,
there are a lot of people that earn more

693
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:57,420
money because they're good to look at.
Right?

694
00:27:57,421 --> 00:27:59,550
There are plenty of people that are paid
more models,

695
00:27:59,551 --> 00:28:02,210
but you go to Puerto Rico and then Miss
Universe and right.

696
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,390
But even people hire receptionists or
people hire people in certain positions

697
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:08,940
because they look good and they get paid
a little extra for that because that's

698
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:11,280
added value to the customer experience
and things like that.

699
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,740
So most of us can't live off of our
looks.

700
00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:15,480
We gotta,
we gotta have some something else,

701
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:17,730
but it's all a function of your
productivity.

702
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,010
You want to earn more,
you have to produce more.

703
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:25,190
Did government just can't mandate that
people pay you more than you're worth as

704
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:28,200
far as the productivity that you can
deliver because you're just not going to

705
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:29,790
have a job.
You're making a ton of sense.

706
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,040
And uh,
obviously I'm not a financial wizard

707
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:32,980
like you are.
What,

708
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,700
when you'd start talking about like
people making more money for their,

709
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:37,680
looks not,
that would be a hot button topic in

710
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:41,760
America and people will get very upset
about it and that people would say that

711
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:45,810
that's a sexist viewpoint and you're
objectifying these women that you have

712
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:48,090
working in these positions.
What would you say to that?

713
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:51,540
Like a secretary or someone who's a
receptionist who's super hot,

714
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,850
like the year you're objectifying this
woman?

715
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:54,811
Well,
you know,

716
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:58,050
there are a lot of men and women,
men get hired for their looks too.

717
00:28:58,051 --> 00:28:59,730
I mean,
it's not just a one way street,

718
00:28:59,731 --> 00:29:01,140
amy.
It's like you said,

719
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:02,790
but look,
you know,

720
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,340
people make the most of what they got
right.

721
00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:05,941
I mean,
people say,

722
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:06,661
Hey,
it's not fair.

723
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,381
Why should this?
Well,

724
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:10,950
it's unfair to the unattractive people,
but build the unattractive person could

725
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:13,800
be really smart.
Maybe she ends up making mom and ugly.

726
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,551
Well look,
you know,

727
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:18,340
not everybody wins the lottery life can
have them write a little bit.

728
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,290
Isn't that the problem with socialism
and the idea of we should even out the

729
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,430
playing field?
Yes.

730
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:26,100
I mean the idea that competent and
you're a competition guy,

731
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,210
right?
But you know,

732
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,480
a famous Democrat,
John Kennedy said that life is unfair

733
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,750
and live in a different era,
but it's not fair.

734
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:34,920
Right.
And he's just trying to bang a lot of

735
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:36,400
checks and you can't,
you know,

736
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:38,700
you can't dwell on the things that you
don't have.

737
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,440
Hey,
I wish I could've been born better

738
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:41,850
looking.
I could been born tall,

739
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,700
taller.

740
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,930
You know,
you've got to make the most,

741
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:46,240
it's like playing poker.
You got hand play it,

742
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,790
you can have the worst hand and you can
win the pot.

743
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:49,720
Right?
So,

744
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,390
you know,
obviously is it easier to win the hand

745
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:53,930
if you got four lasers?
Right.

746
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,550
Right.
But you know what,

747
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,660
if you're a bad player,
you'll win nothing cause everybody's

748
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,670
going to drop.
Right?

749
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,130
And so even getting the best hand,
it doesn't necessarily mean you're

750
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:00,670
gonna,
you're gonna,

751
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,660
you're gonna play it.
Right.

752
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,340
But you know,
it's not,

753
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:05,050
I mean,
if two people,

754
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:07,570
if I want to hire somebody and the way
they look,

755
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:11,680
I believe is going to help me earn more
money because I think that having a more

756
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:15,350
attractive person and particularly
business position is going to somehow

757
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,480
lead to greater sales.
I mean,

758
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:20,020
that's really the only reason that
you're going to pay somebody more money

759
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,350
if they look good.
Like look it on,

760
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,710
you know,
I go on Fox television or CNBC,

761
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,040
it's not an accident that all these
women interviewing me are pretty hot,

762
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,143
right?
I mean,

763
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,690
unattractive women could read the news
and ask me questions just as good as

764
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:34,120
they can,
but they're hoping and they're betting

765
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:39,270
that more guys like us are going to tune
in to watch a hot chick interview me.

766
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,770
Then a home we won and they're probably
right,

767
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,990
right?
Because probably lots of homely girls

768
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,210
that are applying for these jobs,
they're not getting hired.

769
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:46,751
No,
I,

770
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:50,540
I agree with you 100% but there's a
fascinating thing that's going on today

771
00:30:50,541 --> 00:30:54,140
where our competition is thought to be
in somehow some way,

772
00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:57,740
shape or form a negative thing.
And that this kind of competition,

773
00:30:57,741 --> 00:31:00,890
whether it's co,
even capitalism itself is criticized,

774
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:02,690
right?
Like there's a lot of people today that

775
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:06,020
are in favor of socialism and it's one
of the reasons why Bernie Sanders was so

776
00:31:06,021 --> 00:31:07,970
attractive is because like,
Hey,

777
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,060
you people that are not winning this
crazy competition out there that don't

778
00:31:11,061 --> 00:31:13,400
have any desire,
we're going to even out this playing

779
00:31:13,401 --> 00:31:14,690
field.
And those people that are out there

780
00:31:14,691 --> 00:31:17,780
kicking ass and taking names,
we're going to take some of that money

781
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,670
and we're going to just give it to
everybody else.

782
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,050
Yeah.
That is the appeal of socialism because

783
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:24,120
it appeals to the lowest common
denominator.

784
00:31:24,121 --> 00:31:28,230
Downloads his appeal to ignorance,
but it appeals to greed because an envy

785
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:28,561
like,
oh,

786
00:31:28,561 --> 00:31:31,350
this person has so much more than me and
it's not fair.

787
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,500
But here's the beauty of competition
because this is why we want competition.

788
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,800
We all want stuff,
right?

789
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,570
And and so I want people competing to
sell me stuff,

790
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,080
right?
I want to have as much as I can as far

791
00:31:46,081 --> 00:31:47,820
as consumer goods.
That's what we all want.

792
00:31:47,821 --> 00:31:52,821
We want products and services that
enhance our lives and the way we get the

793
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:57,510
best products with the highest quality
that deliver the most value at the

794
00:31:57,511 --> 00:32:00,510
lowest price is to have lots of
competition.

795
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,750
All kinds of people competing for my
business.

796
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,190
Hey,
I've got some money to spend.

797
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,360
Oh,
buy my product,

798
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:09,210
buy my product.
Competition is what's made is what makes

799
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:11,010
sure that I get the best thing.

800
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,950
Right?
You go back to the old Soviet Union and

801
00:32:13,951 --> 00:32:14,311
uh,
you know,

802
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:18,390
there was no competition.
Let's say you wanted a phone in the

803
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:21,330
Soviet Union in the 1960s.
Well you went on a waiting list and

804
00:32:21,331 --> 00:32:24,150
maybe three or four years later,
if you were lucky enough you had the

805
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,880
right connections.
Somebody gave you this big fat black

806
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:27,930
phone,
you know,

807
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,790
and,
and you had one phone and it was very

808
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:30,870
expensive.
You know,

809
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:34,050
that's,
that's phones under co under capitalism.

810
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,780
Look at the phones we have,
I got a fallen and I could take movies

811
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:37,680
with it.
It's a kit.

812
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,300
It's a computer.
It's a camera.

813
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,100
I used

814
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,140
it to get here with its GPS.
I mean,

815
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:44,780
do you think I would have a phone like
this if the government was,

816
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,650
had a monopoly on phones?
Absolutely.

817
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,430
I had a by any government phone that
they were going to put in my place.

818
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:51,650
So we all to say the competition isn't
good.

819
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:55,610
All the things that we value wouldn't
exist if people weren't competing with

820
00:32:55,611 --> 00:32:56,241
one another.
No,

821
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:56,571
I'm,
well,

822
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,400
I'm,
I'm a big believer in competition,

823
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:03,401
but one of the weird arguments is
happening now is that competition is bad

824
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:06,070
and it's a very blinders argument.
And I,

825
00:33:06,071 --> 00:33:11,060
I saw you battle against that argument
when you were with occupy Wall Street,

826
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:12,620
when you went down to the park and talk
to those people.

827
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:14,960
That's how I,
for a lot of these very aggressive,

828
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:18,590
very passionate people with a limited
amount of understanding about capitalism

829
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:20,510
itself.
They had no underst hilarious.

830
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,390
And it was,
it was a wonderful exposing,

831
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,550
but they were there,
which was weird,

832
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:25,851
right?
Well,

833
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:27,440
they were in there.
They have signs,

834
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:28,910
they're screaming,
they're yelling,

835
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:30,500
they're angry,
but yet,

836
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,350
yeah,
and you know,

837
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,870
is very little understanding of what the
system that they're rallying against.

838
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,830
One of the reasons I went there,
and if you haven't seen it,

839
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:38,930
you're plenty of youtube videos of it.
The law there,

840
00:33:38,931 --> 00:33:40,610
there's one that's like two and a half
hours.

841
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,810
Right.
That's the whole,

842
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,150
I talked until we ran out of power.
Right.

843
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,550
I've seen them all,
but I seen about 10 videos of you

844
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:49,340
talking to these people,
but somebody just recently resurrected.

845
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,560
It,
made a copy of it and got another two

846
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:53,450
and a half million views just a few
months ago.

847
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:55,390
So I know people are watching it,
but you know,

848
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:00,400
I went down there because I sympathized
with the fact that people are upset and,

849
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,510
and that I know that the economy is not
as productive as it should be.

850
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,080
I know there's a lot of people that
don't have jobs that should have jobs.

851
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,870
I think that we should have a much more
vibrant economy.

852
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,640
We should have a much higher standard of
living.

853
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,970
There should be a lot more opportunity.
But it's not because we don't have

854
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,430
enough government is because we have too
much.

855
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:22,520
And it's the problems that we have on
Wall Street.

856
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:26,180
We're not a function of capitalism,
but a function of the government's

857
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:29,810
failure to allow capitalism.
And the reason that I was predicting the

858
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:32,720
2008 financial crisis and they were
calling me doctor doom.

859
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,030
The reason I,
I knew about the housing bubble in

860
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:38,600
advance and I was able to see the
financial crisis coming was because I

861
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:41,870
understood the dynamics at play.
I understood how the government,

862
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,630
how the Federal Reserve,
how their policies we're working to

863
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:47,150
inflate these bubbles.
And I understood the moral hazards and

864
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,310
the consequences of what was going on.

865
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,650
And so when I went down as a Cottey
Park,

866
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:55,610
the point I was trying to make,
and not even so much the people that

867
00:34:55,611 --> 00:34:58,730
were protesting,
but to the people who I knew would watch

868
00:34:58,731 --> 00:35:02,840
the interaction all around the world was
to make the point that you are right to

869
00:35:02,841 --> 00:35:03,890
be upset,
but you're,

870
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,371
you're,
you're,

871
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:06,350
you're venting your anger in the wrong
direction.

872
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,720
They're inventing,
they're angry or people at you like you

873
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,860
and a successful,
the quote unquote one 1% capitalism.

874
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,820
And I would say,
look,

875
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:16,670
it's the Federal Reserve that is the
source of your problems.

876
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,950
It's congress.
It's the White House.

877
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:21,770
It's not the financial district in New
York City.

878
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,770
I mean the free market people in the
free market are there to help you write

879
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:30,890
anyone in anyone that has a business,
all they're trying to do is win your

880
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:35,090
business as a customer there.
They're competing to get you to buy

881
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,920
things and anything that you buy,
right?

882
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:38,310
If choose to buy something,

883
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,420
if I buy something for 20 bucks,
I must value what I'm buying more than

884
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:44,160
20 bucks or I wouldn't make the
exchange.

885
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:48,390
So to the extent that there's a business
out there trying to convince me to buy

886
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:51,210
something that I value more than money,
that's not going to hurt me.

887
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,400
The problem is government.
Government has power,

888
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,880
government has brute force.
The government can force me to do things

889
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:59,700
that I don't want to do.
The government can make my life worse.

890
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,340
A private business,
it's just going to make my life better,

891
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,320
right?
Because if they're not going to make my

892
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:06,000
life better,
I don't do business with them.

893
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,060
But the government is a different story.
They can pass laws,

894
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:11,490
they can pass taxes,
they can best regulations.

895
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,550
And as it so happens,
the laws and regulations that they're

896
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:17,520
passing are making people's lives worse.
And you know,

897
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:20,070
the problem wasn't that big banks
failed.

898
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,900
The problem was that they got bailed
out.

899
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,990
Don't blame the banks for accepting the
bail out.

900
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:26,490
I mean,
what would you do if someone offered to

901
00:36:26,491 --> 00:36:27,121
bail you out?
Yeah,

902
00:36:27,121 --> 00:36:29,820
you'd take the money.
The problem is the government,

903
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:32,910
the government shouldn't have had the
power to bail him out in the first place

904
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,570
so that the real enemy is government and
the power that government has.

905
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:39,840
We have to take that power away from
government.

906
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:41,490
And what,
when you take power away from

907
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,660
government,
you create freedom,

908
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,040
right?
That's what freedom is.

909
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:45,810
It's absence of government.
Right?

910
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,520
Now,
when you say the Federal Reserve and

911
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:52,140
Congress or the real issue,
what is their incentive to be that

912
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:55,110
issue?
What is their incentive to not allow the

913
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:59,430
market to thrive and to like you're
saying that they're the reason why there

914
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:02,130
aren't more opportunities and there
aren't more people working?

915
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:02,850
What?

916
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:03,970
What are,
what is,

917
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,970
what does,
what do they have to gain?

918
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:06,911
Well,
Paul,

919
00:37:06,911 --> 00:37:09,060
what are they doing?
Politicians have power,

920
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:11,550
right?
They want the money to get elected and

921
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:14,100
they want all the perks that come with
elected office.

922
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,860
Uh,
most people that are in government live

923
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:18,870
pretty good lives.
There's a reason to do it right.

924
00:37:18,871 --> 00:37:21,780
It's not that they want to serve the
people will help the people.

925
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,370
They want a personal benefit.
Yeah.

926
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:24,120
I mean,
that's all it,

927
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,440
that's all the nonsense,
right?

928
00:37:25,441 --> 00:37:27,450
They all pretend that they're public
servants,

929
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:28,051
but that's,
that,

930
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:29,070
that's that Spiel,
right?

931
00:37:29,071 --> 00:37:30,250
That they're,
they're all there.

932
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,290
They're,
they're acting.

933
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,110
They're,
they're playing a part that's a,

934
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,550
that's a means to an end.
They want the power.

935
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:38,670
They want the perks that come with
elected office.

936
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,300
And so obviously in order to get
elected,

937
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:44,670
you've got to get the votes.
You got to get the contributions.

938
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:48,930
And so they're not making policy.
That's good economics.

939
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,290
All they're trying to do is get elected
and get donations.

940
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,760
And so they have a vested interest in
helping the people that give them money.

941
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,180
And people are always trying to buy
special perks from government,

942
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,400
uh,
a tax break or you know,

943
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,263
put these,
you know,

944
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,870
regulate my competitor instead of me or
put this guy out of business.

945
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,600
And of course a lot of people just vote
for something for free.

946
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,540
That was the power of Bernie Sanders.
I'll give you free stuff,

947
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,590
right?
Both from me.

948
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,400
And there are a lot of people who don't
know any better and they're just going

949
00:38:16,401 --> 00:38:18,540
to vote for whoever it promises the most
free stuff.

950
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,360
But free stuff isn't free.
It's very expensive.

951
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,000
But what it really amounts to is theft.
I mean,

952
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,550
the liberal say,
vote for me and I'm going to steal from

953
00:38:26,551 --> 00:38:29,730
somebody else and give you what I take
because the government doesn't have

954
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:31,650
anything the government doesn't have,
you know,

955
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:34,680
if they're going to promise something,
they have to take it from somebody else.

956
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:36,220
They don't have anything.
Government

957
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,880
doesn't produce government just
redistributes what other people produce.

958
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,940
So there's always a cost.
But whenever the government does that,

959
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:46,840
when they taxed the productive people to
give money to nonproductive people,

960
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,540
they increased the incentive not to
produce.

961
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,520
And they decrease the incentive to
produce.

962
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:55,270
So all this redistribution of wealth
just means that there's a lot less

963
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:57,880
wealth to redistribute and everybody
ends up poor.

964
00:38:57,881 --> 00:39:01,540
If the politicians stayed out of it,
then you'd have a lot more wealth and

965
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:04,330
everybody would be better off.
But that's not,

966
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:06,820
you know,
the politics of it are the things that

967
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:10,030
are good economics are bad politics.
Like,

968
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:10,930
like take,
take,

969
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,023
uh,
healthcare.

970
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,370
Why couldn't the Republicans Repeal
Obamacare,

971
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,490
right?
Because obamacare is terrible economics.

972
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,650
But here's the problem.
How is it terribly economics.

973
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,280
We're going to get into this.
The last time you were here.

974
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,810
Yeah,
we got sidetracked.

975
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,570
What,
what is terrible about it?

976
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,660
Well,
I mean,

977
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,670
I mean we could spend the whole show on
why it's bad economics,

978
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:34,510
but you know,
there's a belief out there that

979
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,580
government is somehow going to be a more
efficient provider of health care than

980
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:41,410
the free market,
which is just not true.

981
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,273
Right?
I mean,

982
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,950
healthcare is a surface,
right?

983
00:39:44,951 --> 00:39:46,930
Just like food,
just like shelter,

984
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:51,610
just like clothing and the free market
can provide it better and cheaper than

985
00:39:51,611 --> 00:39:52,301
government.
I mean,

986
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:55,540
that's just always the case.
Some people like it as a service.

987
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:59,170
So that becomes a part of what the
government offers you along with,

988
00:39:59,171 --> 00:40:00,520
you know,
when you pay your taxes,

989
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:02,710
they fixed the roads,
they hire the police,

990
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,620
things along those lines.
They would like healthcare to be along

991
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,340
that line as well,
just like it is in the UK and in Canada

992
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,070
and,

993
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,940
and you know,
and in some ways those systems are

994
00:40:12,941 --> 00:40:16,570
better than the system we have now,
but they're not better than the system

995
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:21,400
we used to have or better than the
system that we could have if it was a

996
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:22,600
pure free market,
you know?

997
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,460
But that,
that,

998
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,110
there's two things you got right,
you've got healthcare and then you've

999
00:40:26,111 --> 00:40:27,130
got the health insurance,
right?

1000
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:30,400
Let's look at those two,
those two industries separately because

1001
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,100
the reason that people buy health
insurance,

1002
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,990
right,
is in case,

1003
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,460
well,
if I get really sick,

1004
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:37,930
I can't afford the bills,
right?

1005
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,370
Just like,
you know,

1006
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,240
people buy car insurance,
right?

1007
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,770
When you buy car insurance,
you know that you still have to pay for

1008
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:45,760
gas.
You know,

1009
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:49,060
you don't expect your car insurance
policy to cover the cost of gas.

1010
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:53,740
It doesn't cover the cost of new tires.
It doesn't cover the cost of a new spark

1011
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:56,590
plugs or your routine maintenance.

1012
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,020
The reason you buy auto insurances,
Hey,

1013
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:01,720
what if I get into a wreck and I total
my car,

1014
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:06,810
I don't have the cash to buy a new one.
So people buy insurance because they're

1015
00:41:07,451 --> 00:41:09,880
insuring against something.
That's probably not going to happen,

1016
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,710
right?
When you buy your auto insurance,

1017
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:15,790
the anticipation is that you never put
in a claim and you're happy to never put

1018
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:17,680
into a claim.
And the insurance company,

1019
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:19,240
obviously it doesn't want you to put in
a claim.

1020
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:21,070
They're hoping that they collect the
premiums.

1021
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:25,630
And the way auto insurance works is
because most people don't put in a claim

1022
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,050
because they don't get into an accident.
The insurance company has the money to

1023
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:30,880
pay the people who do get an accident,
right.

1024
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,520
And that's how insurance works.
But because of the government health

1025
00:41:34,521 --> 00:41:36,650
insurance then work that way anymore.
Right.

1026
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,880
Because of the government and the
government's set up the system where if

1027
00:41:40,881 --> 00:41:45,881
I hire somebody and I pay them cash,
they have to pay income taxes on it.

1028
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,940
If I give them health insurance instead
of cash,

1029
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:53,150
it's tax free.
So a lot of people all of a sudden

1030
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,310
wanted health insurance instead of cash
because they didn't have to pay tax on

1031
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:01,280
health insurance.
And now more and more people started to

1032
00:42:01,281 --> 00:42:06,281
want their health insurance to cover the
equivalent of more gas in my car or a

1033
00:42:06,561 --> 00:42:11,030
flat tire.
And the minute you try to pay for your

1034
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:15,710
routine medical costs with a third party
payer through health insurance,

1035
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,500
you have these spiraling out of control
costs.

1036
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,450
You know,
because if you never,

1037
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:23,600
if you pulled up to a gas station,
it didn't actually pay for the gas.

1038
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,550
You just like put your,
your gas,

1039
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,070
your credit,
you're a insurance card into the pump

1040
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,950
and they didn't even have prices.
Because when you go to the doctor,

1041
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:32,870
you don't even know what things cost.
There's no prices.

1042
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:34,730
I mean,
when you go to buy gas,

1043
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:38,270
everybody has the price right up there.
And I look around and if one place is 2

1044
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,380
cents cheaper,
that's where I'm going.

1045
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:40,214
Right?
So,

1046
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,590
but if,
if the gas stations didn't even bother

1047
00:42:42,591 --> 00:42:43,550
to put the price,
and I said,

1048
00:42:43,551 --> 00:42:45,980
what do you care what the gas costs?
The insurance companies paid for it,

1049
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:46,611
right?
I mean,

1050
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:48,180
that's what we have with the healthcare
system.

1051
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,370
We have a system that government created
where people rely on health insurance to

1052
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:56,690
pay for everything.
Health insurance should just be for very

1053
00:42:56,691 --> 00:42:59,120
expensive things that are probably not
going to happen to you,

1054
00:42:59,121 --> 00:42:59,540
right?
I,

1055
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,370
I get hit by a car,
I get cancer.

1056
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,640
You shouldn't use your health insurance
every time you go to the doctor.

1057
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,880
And if we got,
if we got people to pay for their health

1058
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:09,710
insurance,
the way they pay for their,

1059
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,510
their,
their auto insurance or the life

1060
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:13,910
insurance,
if we separate health insurance from

1061
00:43:13,911 --> 00:43:16,670
employment,
health insurance will be much cheaper.

1062
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,010
You know,
it's the government that married the

1063
00:43:19,011 --> 00:43:19,844
two,
right?

1064
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,320
And that's why people say,
well,

1065
00:43:21,321 --> 00:43:23,060
if you lose your job,
you lose your healthcare.

1066
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:25,790
That's because the government fix the
tax code.

1067
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,500
And people,
you know,

1068
00:43:27,501 --> 00:43:29,840
you don't lose your auto insurance when
you lose your job.

1069
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,900
But the other important thing,
and here's why obamacare doesn't work.

1070
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,780
See the thesis of Obamacare was,
Hey,

1071
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,440
let's make it so that insurance
companies can't discriminate against

1072
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:43,640
people that have a preexisting
condition,

1073
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:46,100
right?
So they can't charge people more money

1074
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,260
just because they happen to be sick.
Right?

1075
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:50,750
This was one of the appeals of it.
Now,

1076
00:43:50,751 --> 00:43:54,110
here's the problem with that.
The only reason people buy insurance

1077
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:57,190
when they're healthy health insurance is
because they know they can't buy it when

1078
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:59,900
they're sick.
Like let's say with the auto insurance,

1079
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,850
if there was a law that said that,
or auto insurance companies couldn't

1080
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,130
discriminate based on preexisting
conditions.

1081
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,840
If you can buy the policy after your
accident and get coverage for the same

1082
00:44:11,841 --> 00:44:14,090
price as if you bought it before,
right?

1083
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,510
Nobody would buy auto insurance.
You would just wait until you had an

1084
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:18,344
accident.

1085
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,290
Auto Insurance,
a weird argument because auto insurance

1086
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,810
is mandatory.
Like you have to have it where health

1087
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:27,080
insurance not mandatory.
Well it's obamacare kind of makes it

1088
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:27,950
mandatory,
right?

1089
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,100
You're just saying it's mentoring for
the wrong aspects of Eve insurance that

1090
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,140
it covers the wrong things.
Well even look,

1091
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:37,220
fire insurance isn't mandatory either.
Oh No.

1092
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,510
Insurance is in certain states it is and
of course not all coverages mandatory

1093
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,590
and you know you haven't pulsory
coverage.

1094
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:46,230
You have to have some which is similar
to what you're talking about with health

1095
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:48,360
insurance.
Compulsory health insurance,

1096
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:51,120
like for catastrophic injuries.
Well they made it,

1097
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:56,150
they obamacare made it compulsory gives.
The point is this that if auto insurance

1098
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,430
was not compulsory,
right and you can just decide whether or

1099
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:03,090
not you wanted it.
If there was a law that said that

1100
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,800
insurance companies couldn't
discriminate,

1101
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:07,380
nobody would buy it because you would
just wait until after you had an

1102
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:09,120
accident.
But the problem is not just that.

1103
00:45:09,121 --> 00:45:12,060
Well the reason why auto insurance is a
bad example is because you are going to

1104
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:13,950
hit my car and you going to do damage to
me.

1105
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:17,430
Have you have no insurance on your car.
I'm not going to be you run into you on

1106
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:20,820
the street and collide with my body and
hurt you.

1107
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:24,480
I somehow now I don't have health
insurance and so you get injured from

1108
00:45:24,481 --> 00:45:25,141
me.
I look,

1109
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:27,720
just don't you think that's a different
argument rather than even make that

1110
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:29,580
argument,
let's just go to fire insurance cause

1111
00:45:29,581 --> 00:45:32,400
there's only one person involved me.
So I have a house.

1112
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,730
You know,
would I buy fire insurance if I can go

1113
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:39,720
to an insurance company after my house
already burns down and by the policy for

1114
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:42,630
the same price?
So the reason that people buy fire

1115
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:46,350
insurance policies before their house
burns down is because they know that

1116
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:49,080
nobody will sell them a policy after it
burns down.

1117
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:52,990
And the insurance companies couldn't
stay in business if the only people who

1118
00:45:52,991 --> 00:45:55,470
were buying policies where people whose
houses already burnt down.

1119
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,080
I agree with you.
So here's what happened with obamacare.

1120
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:02,280
So Obama says we're gonna make it.
So insurance companies can't

1121
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:03,780
discriminate against people who are
sick.

1122
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:06,060
Well,
the result of that is no healthy

1123
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:08,130
person's going to want to buy insurance.
It's a waste of money.

1124
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:11,520
Why pay premiums when you're not sick?
Wait until you get sick.

1125
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,120
So what am I can't discriminate against
you because you have a preexisting

1126
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:18,630
condition.
So the way Obama tried to combat that

1127
00:46:18,631 --> 00:46:19,290
was,
okay,

1128
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,150
we're going to force people to buy
insurance.

1129
00:46:21,151 --> 00:46:23,370
We're going to,
we're going to require employers to

1130
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:26,040
provide it.
And if you know you don't get it from

1131
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:27,420
your employer,
we're going to find you.

1132
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:31,230
You're going to have a penalty if you
don't buy the insurance right now.

1133
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,880
Two things about that.
One,

1134
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,560
the penalties were too low,
right?

1135
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:38,280
Because the penalty for not buying
insurance is so cheap that it's cheaper

1136
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,260
to not buy insurance,
pay the penalty,

1137
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,600
and then wait until you get sick to by
the insurance.

1138
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,510
That's why the insurance companies are
losing all this money,

1139
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,870
and that's why premiums are skyrocketing
because nobody wants to buy because the

1140
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:53,430
punished if the penalties were too low.
But politically,

1141
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,600
everybody likes the idea that insurance
companies can't discriminate based on

1142
00:46:57,601 --> 00:47:00,300
preclinical.
So what the Republicans tried to do was

1143
00:47:00,301 --> 00:47:03,150
have their cake and eat it too.
They said to the voters,

1144
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,360
we're going to keep the ban on
preexisting conditions,

1145
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,250
but we're going to get rid of the
mandates.

1146
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:10,380
We're going to get rid of the penalties.
We're going to get rid of this.

1147
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,660
You can't do that.
You have to have both.

1148
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,650
The real problem was the taxes were too,
the penalties were too low.

1149
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,950
They needed the jack those penalties up
because so many people were paying the

1150
00:47:19,951 --> 00:47:24,510
penalty and not buying the insurance.
But the reality is we need a free market

1151
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:28,290
insurance because the Republicans want
to say you should be able to buy the

1152
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:30,010
type of coverage that you want.
You should be

1153
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,780
able to buy the kind of inch,
which is true,

1154
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,630
but then insurance companies have to be
able to deny you coverage.

1155
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:37,780
If they don't want to cover you,
they have to be able to charge you more

1156
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:41,200
if you're already sick.
I mean the only way to have inexpensive

1157
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:46,201
insurance is for the insurance companies
to discriminate and to charge people

1158
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:50,020
more money if they're already sick.
And it's because of that.

1159
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:53,410
That's why healthy people buy policies
because they know,

1160
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,180
hey,
let me buy it now why I'm healthy,

1161
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,910
because if I happen to get sick and it's
going to be a lot more expensive.

1162
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:00,130
So what the,
what the government is trying to do is

1163
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:02,530
just trying to destroy the market for
health insurance.

1164
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,990
Meanwhile,
the costs are skyrocketing,

1165
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:08,320
insurance is getting more expensive.
Healthcare is getting more expensive.

1166
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:12,670
If you go back to the days before the
government was involved,

1167
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,790
uh,
healthcare was not a problem.

1168
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:17,020
It wasn't expensive.
You know,

1169
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:20,080
in the 1920s,
1930 [inaudible] 1940 [inaudible] 1950s,

1170
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:23,710
healthcare was not expensive.
People didn't worry about medical bills.

1171
00:48:23,711 --> 00:48:26,290
They were not high.
If you needed a catastrophic insurance,

1172
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:28,750
it was inexpensive.
If you had to go to the doctor,

1173
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,340
it wasn't expensive.
You know,

1174
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:34,450
people didn't even worry about it
because it was cool or is quality care

1175
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:39,280
and it was at a low cost.
And with all the advancements that we've

1176
00:48:39,281 --> 00:48:42,130
had in medicine,
with all the technology,

1177
00:48:42,131 --> 00:48:47,131
with all the drugs that are here,
healthcare should be cheaper today than

1178
00:48:47,381 --> 00:48:49,820
it was in 1940 [inaudible] and 1950s on
a,

1179
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:51,400
on a real basis.
You know,

1180
00:48:51,401 --> 00:48:53,710
and I hear all the time people make the
argument,

1181
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:55,360
well,
the reason that healthcare is more

1182
00:48:55,361 --> 00:48:59,440
expensive because it's more complicated
now because we do all these things that

1183
00:48:59,441 --> 00:49:02,020
we didn't do well.
If that were true,

1184
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:06,220
then why isn't my cell phone today more
expensive than a cell phone 10 or 20

1185
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:07,054
years ago?

1186
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,640
Is it as does more expensive?
No,

1187
00:49:09,641 --> 00:49:12,360
it's certainly ends.
It's just you get subsidized by your,

1188
00:49:12,361 --> 00:49:13,860
your company,
no matter who you are,

1189
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,360
the they,
they drag out the payments.

1190
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,150
They like,
if you buy a cell phone from verizon,

1191
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:22,030
they're not selling you the full.
Like if you buy an iphone seven they're

1192
00:49:22,031 --> 00:49:25,090
not selling it to you at the full rate.
The full rate would be like 1,012

1193
00:49:25,091 --> 00:49:25,901
hundred bucks.
Yes.

1194
00:49:25,901 --> 00:49:30,901
But I paid $1,000 in the 1980s for my
first cell phone that didn't do jack

1195
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,760
compared with this very early days of
Gordon Gekko ones.

1196
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,490
I've got this Mac Mac book air in front
of me here.

1197
00:49:39,491 --> 00:49:42,900
And so this back book air,
obviously this is a a,

1198
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,770
you know,
cost me like 12 1400 bucks.

1199
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,430
My first computer that I had in college
was an apple,

1200
00:49:48,431 --> 00:49:53,431
two e and that computer and I got a dot
matrix printer and I had a floppy disk

1201
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,920
and my dad spent almost $5,000 on it in
1981 and all it was was a glorified word

1202
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:00,790
processor,
right?

1203
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:05,230
So obviously the power in this computer
is so much greater than the one that I

1204
00:50:05,231 --> 00:50:08,620
had in that apple two e yet it's less
expensive.

1205
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,810
Even forgetting about adjusting for
inflation,

1206
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:14,110
it's actually cheaper in actual dollars
and did,

1207
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,940
despite the fact that it's more
complicated.

1208
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:19,840
And my point is that just because
something is more complicated and more

1209
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,640
doesn't mean it's going to be more
expensive.

1210
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:25,540
Healthcare today should be cheaper.
All of this,

1211
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,010
all of the new technology be bringing
down

1212
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:30,980
the cost of medicine.
The reason it's not is because of

1213
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:33,650
government's involvement.
Cause if government was involved in the

1214
00:50:33,651 --> 00:50:36,260
computer industry the same way it's
involved in healthcare,

1215
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,130
then we would see skyrocketing computer
prices that,

1216
00:50:39,131 --> 00:50:40,070
you know,
okay,

1217
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:43,040
so now why does the government,
and you're saying that the government

1218
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:47,510
wants to destroy the insurance industry,
that they don't want to,

1219
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,150
not adroit as troy,
but what,

1220
00:50:49,151 --> 00:50:51,350
why do they want to complicate it the
way I do think?

1221
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:51,831
Well,
first of all,

1222
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:54,200
I don't think they're smart enough to
destroy it on purpose.

1223
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:56,210
I mean,
it's just the unintended consequences.

1224
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,070
They're trying to get votes,
they're trying to get elected.

1225
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,113
And of course,
you know,

1226
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,150
people want something for nothing.
So number one,

1227
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:04,550
you know,
you get a lot of votes by promising free

1228
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,570
healthcare,
right?

1229
00:51:05,571 --> 00:51:07,940
So number one,
but also why do the insurance companies,

1230
00:51:07,941 --> 00:51:10,730
because there are massive subsidies for
insurance companies,

1231
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,180
right?

1232
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:14,120
If I can get the government to require
people to buy my product,

1233
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,040
then I don't have to offer a good
product.

1234
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:16,610
Right?
I mean,

1235
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:17,930
when she,
wouldn't you like to government to

1236
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:20,210
require everybody to listen to the Joe
Rogan podcast?

1237
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:22,790
If that was mandatory,
super furious at me.

1238
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,560
Well,
it's exactly the way it is,

1239
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,290
but although,
but you know,

1240
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,090
but there are a lot of businesses rather
than having to win.

1241
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,880
Well maybe if you had a lousy podcasts
that nobody listened to,

1242
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:33,440
you'd want the government to say,
Hey,

1243
00:51:33,441 --> 00:51:36,170
too many people are listening to Joe
Rogan forced them to listen to my

1244
00:51:36,171 --> 00:51:37,790
podcast instead.
So,

1245
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:39,530
you know,
you have these big healthcare companies

1246
00:51:39,531 --> 00:51:42,140
or insurance companies that want
something from government.

1247
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:45,620
They want the government to mandate
people buy their product or protect them

1248
00:51:45,621 --> 00:51:46,910
from competition.
No,

1249
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,910
you can't.
If you wanted to buy an insurance policy

1250
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,010
from a Japanese company or a Swiss
company,

1251
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,760
you can't do it.

1252
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,490
They can't.
Some Swiss company can't come over here

1253
00:51:55,491 --> 00:51:56,510
to California.
Hell,

1254
00:51:56,511 --> 00:51:59,210
they won't even let companies from other
states sell you policies.

1255
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,171
I mean,
why is that?

1256
00:52:00,171 --> 00:52:04,040
We need more competition.
But government is protecting companies

1257
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:07,400
from having to compete with one another
so they don't have to do as good a job.

1258
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:10,670
But Obama was already in office,
right when he was trying to do this.

1259
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,890
Well,
what was the incentive for trying to

1260
00:52:12,891 --> 00:52:16,790
pass this once he's already an office,
a wants to get reelected,

1261
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,040
which he did.
He did get reelected,

1262
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,320
but there's a lot of political pay off.
You have to,

1263
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:23,360
you know,
pay off the people that help put you in

1264
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:27,050
office and you know,
he wants to help other Democrats get

1265
00:52:27,051 --> 00:52:27,801
elected,
you know,

1266
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:28,051
and,
and,

1267
00:52:28,051 --> 00:52:30,140
and maintain,
maintain that power.

1268
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:33,920
But nobody ever debate this with him in
this sort of a rational,

1269
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:34,730
pragmatic way.

1270
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:37,220
The way you're laying it out right now,
I have no idea.

1271
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:38,780
You know,
and you don't know when it comes to a

1272
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:40,820
politician,
you don't know if they're doing stupid

1273
00:52:40,821 --> 00:52:44,450
things because they're stupid or because
they don't care that they're done.

1274
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:49,110
They're just the ramifications of what
they're trying to propose and why,

1275
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:51,980
as I said,
either either that people believe in

1276
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:56,360
liberal philosophy or these programs,
either because they're ignorant or

1277
00:52:56,361 --> 00:52:58,130
because they have an ulterior motive
right there.

1278
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:01,880
There are probably some politicians
there that are actually dumb enough to

1279
00:53:01,881 --> 00:53:03,380
think that this is a good idea,
right?

1280
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:06,410
Like we talked about the minimum wage.
There are some people that actually

1281
00:53:06,411 --> 00:53:08,390
believe that it's a good thing,
right?

1282
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,860
They don't know how bad it is,
but they're doing it because they're,

1283
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:14,390
they're thinking with their hearts and
not with their heads,

1284
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:17,990
but there are probably some people who
support the minimum wage knowing that

1285
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:20,420
it's bad,
but they know it's good politics or

1286
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:24,200
they're afraid to come out against it
because that's such bad politics.

1287
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,720
So you don't for sure.
If somebody is in favor of something,

1288
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,150
do they actually realize how bad it is?
Right,

1289
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,000
and they're doing it anyway.
Are they just dumb enough to actually

1290
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,830
believe it?
I have to say if you adjust for

1291
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:36,600
inflation,
you're probably right about cell phones.

1292
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,420
So I'm thinking now like a Motorola
startac.

1293
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,950
Oh yeah.
How much were those?

1294
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,230
Those were expensive.
How much were they when they came out?

1295
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,150
I think there were like five or 600
bucks,

1296
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,360
but if you adjust for inflation about
how much it costs to use them,

1297
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,200
that's the big one.
The roaming costs were extraordinary,

1298
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,230
but even if you didn't roam I distance
and long distance.

1299
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,780
My first plan,
I think when I was in,

1300
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,770
I had my first phone and I think it was
like 70 80 bucks a month.

1301
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,600
And I had like a half hour of talk time.

1302
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,561
Right.
So I would,

1303
00:54:04,561 --> 00:54:07,740
if someone called me on my cell phone,
I was quick because I had to quickly get

1304
00:54:07,741 --> 00:54:09,480
off because if you went over your
minutes,

1305
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,490
you know,
now I have unlimited,

1306
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,380
not only is it unlimited,
I can talk,

1307
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:14,940
I get,
I can see people,

1308
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:17,250
I see their faces,
I could talk to people in other

1309
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:19,050
countries.
Now there's companies that are offering

1310
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:21,060
unlimited data too,
just cause there,

1311
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:23,220
because we didn't even have database
keating.

1312
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,370
Yes.
Because there can be,

1313
00:54:24,371 --> 00:54:26,220
okay.
It was 1000 bucks.

1314
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,083
Oh,
so wrong.

1315
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:29,610
See,
especially if you adjust for inflation.

1316
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:32,750
Oh yeah.
And then just reinflation of a startac

1317
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,700
phone,
which was a piece of shit comparatively.

1318
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:39,210
It was amazing at the time.
And the battery lasted like a half an

1319
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,440
hour,
45 minutes of,

1320
00:54:40,441 --> 00:54:42,870
you know,
and so a brand new iphone,

1321
00:54:42,871 --> 00:54:45,990
it's probably like 1200 so yeah,
you adjust for inflation.

1322
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:46,824
You right?

1323
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,890
Now,
when you're talking about Bernie Sanders

1324
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:53,250
and you're talking about some of the
policies that that guy was proposing and

1325
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:54,690
some of this,
the idea of,

1326
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,000
you know,
Robin hooding the whole deal taking from

1327
00:54:57,001 --> 00:55:01,140
the rich and giving to the poor,
that's extremely appealing to people,

1328
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,880
right?
How do you,

1329
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:07,470
how do you lay it out to people in a way
that they can understand that although

1330
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:11,550
this looks like a great idea,
that this is not a good idea and

1331
00:55:11,551 --> 00:55:13,860
ultimately it's not going to benefit
you.

1332
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,830
It's going to make things stagnant.
It's gonna make things harder for

1333
00:55:16,831 --> 00:55:18,810
business and it's gonna make things
harder for jobs.

1334
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,960
A lot of people listening right now to
even me saying that they're tweeting me

1335
00:55:21,961 --> 00:55:24,060
to get mad.
You fucking a shill.

1336
00:55:24,061 --> 00:55:26,910
You sell out you 1% or you piece of
shit.

1337
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,790
I,
that's the thought process between Eh,

1338
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:34,100
behind anybody who says anything even
remotely negative about socialism,

1339
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,310
that you have to be some sort of a
sellout or you just want to keep things

1340
00:55:38,311 --> 00:55:40,560
the way they are so that you can
benefit.

1341
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:44,160
And it's amazing that so many people
find socialism appealing.

1342
00:55:44,161 --> 00:55:45,060
Yet they'll say,
Oh,

1343
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,620
you know,
fascism is really bad.

1344
00:55:46,621 --> 00:55:47,910
Right?
The Nazis were really bad.

1345
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:52,080
They don't realize that the Nazi party
that stands for national socialism,

1346
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:54,010
that's what it was.
It's national social.

1347
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:58,770
So socialism is a broader economic
theory that encompasses cat,

1348
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:00,510
uh,
communism and fascism.

1349
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,490
They're both forms of socialism.
So,

1350
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:03,290
you know,
yeah,

1351
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:04,650
it's all bad.
Right?

1352
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:05,640
And the whole idea,
the,

1353
00:56:05,641 --> 00:56:08,200
all the whole premise of socialism is
bad.

1354
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:08,870
It,
you know,

1355
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,760
it,
the free market being a libertarian is

1356
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:15,060
all about the individual.
It's about freedom and,

1357
00:56:15,061 --> 00:56:15,471
and,
and,

1358
00:56:15,471 --> 00:56:20,190
and recognizing the value of,
of the individual and their rights to

1359
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:23,680
pursue their own self interest or own
happiness property.

1360
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,180
But in,
in your question,

1361
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:29,680
how do you talk to people and get them
to see how bad socialism is?

1362
00:56:29,681 --> 00:56:30,131
I mean,
I mean,

1363
00:56:30,131 --> 00:56:31,240
first of all,
I mean,

1364
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:35,230
look at the countries that have tried it
in its extreme form,

1365
00:56:35,231 --> 00:56:35,410
right?

1366
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:40,410
Whether it was like the Soviet Union or
a North Korea or Cuba or East Germany,

1367
00:56:42,461 --> 00:56:46,370
you could look at examples where you had
people moving in this direction.

1368
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,650
These promises of,
you know,

1369
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:49,150
from each,
according to his ability to each

1370
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,100
according to his need and it was a
disaster.

1371
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:56,170
So it's not like we don't have a long
history of failed socialist experiments.

1372
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,930
And you know,
you can look at the countries that are

1373
00:56:58,931 --> 00:57:02,590
the most prosperous and those are the
countries that have the least amount of

1374
00:57:02,591 --> 00:57:03,490
socialism.
I mean,

1375
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,480
obviously,
you know,

1376
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:07,510
socialism is going to exist in a certain
degree.

1377
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:11,500
It's hard to find any place on the earth
now where there isn't some elements of

1378
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:13,510
socialism that have crept into the
economy.

1379
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,620
But the extent that countries have
managed to limit the amount of socialist

1380
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,760
policies they have,
they have maximized the standard of

1381
00:57:21,761 --> 00:57:22,660
living of their people.

1382
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:25,120
So the more like look at Venezuela,
right?

1383
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:25,901
I mean people,
you know,

1384
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,160
and I,
I uh,

1385
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:28,920
and president,
um,

1386
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:30,290
uh,
uh,

1387
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:32,990
uh,
trump was tweeting out not too long ago.

1388
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:33,341
Oh,
you know,

1389
00:57:33,341 --> 00:57:34,720
he's,
he's upset that they don't have enough

1390
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:36,340
democracy.
We need more democracy.

1391
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:39,400
They don't need more democracy.
Democracy is what got them into trouble

1392
00:57:39,401 --> 00:57:42,970
because they voted for socialists.
What they need in Venezuela is more

1393
00:57:42,971 --> 00:57:44,860
capitalism.
They need more freedom,

1394
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,590
not just more people voting for other
socialists.

1395
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:51,820
Notice of the appeal of socialism.
Essentially the same appeal of turning

1396
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:54,280
Puerto Rico into a state that you're
going to get something for it.

1397
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:56,050
It's going to benefit the people.
Yeah,

1398
00:57:56,051 --> 00:57:57,370
I mean people,
you know,

1399
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,920
like the idea of getting something for
nothing.

1400
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:02,290
And you know,
there is a certain,

1401
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,320
if you think of that superficially,
and that's why you know there's an old

1402
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:06,100
expression,
right?

1403
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,950
If you're not socialists by the time
you're 20 you don't have a heart.

1404
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:11,200
But if you're not a concern,
by the time you're 30 you don't have a

1405
00:58:11,201 --> 00:58:14,320
brain.
It's because people are caring.

1406
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:15,161
I mean,
in general,

1407
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:17,620
most people care about their fellow
human beings,

1408
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:19,690
including conservatives and
libertarians.

1409
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:22,840
I mean they care to just at.
A lot of liberals think that

1410
00:58:22,841 --> 00:58:26,140
conservatives are mean because they
don't support these programs.

1411
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,020
It's not because they're mean,
it's just that they recognize the

1412
00:58:29,021 --> 00:58:30,910
unintended consequences of these
programs,

1413
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:34,000
that the programs actually make it worse
for the people that you're trying to

1414
00:58:34,001 --> 00:58:36,220
help.
But younger people who don't have as

1415
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,500
much real world experience,
they don't know any better.

1416
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:43,501
So it's very easy to be a socialist when
you're 16 1718 you'd never had a job.

1417
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:46,090
You've never run a company,
you don't have much real world

1418
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:48,580
experience,
but you're carrying human being.

1419
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,270
So I don't fault young people for being
socialists,

1420
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,520
but I do.
But when you get to your thirties and

1421
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:57,370
your forties and you haven't grown up,
to me that's like a little kid still

1422
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:58,870
believing in Santa Claus.
Right.

1423
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:00,850
How come you didn't learn anything?
Right.

1424
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,290
Here's Bernie Sanders.
He's like,

1425
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,310
you know what is he 70 something years
old and he's,

1426
00:59:04,311 --> 00:59:07,180
he thinks like as a teenager,
I mean he didn't learn anything from all

1427
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:08,320
this life experience.
You know,

1428
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:08,971
he's,
he it,

1429
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:11,740
he didn't get any smarter because it
doesn't need to have a bunch of houses.

1430
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,650
I think Bernie owns a few houses.
Yeah,

1431
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,440
I think he does.
And didn't mean one of the,

1432
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:20,340
he's in hot water right now because his
wife,

1433
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,940
yes.
Why she decided to go full on

1434
00:59:22,941 --> 00:59:26,660
capitalists for this small college and
buy up a bunch of land.

1435
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:28,430
And the,
the company went bankrupt.

1436
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:29,750
Yup.
The college,

1437
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:30,890
which is essentially company,
right?

1438
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:33,260
The way that you can get young people to
understand,

1439
00:59:33,261 --> 00:59:34,220
look,
most people,

1440
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:38,150
even if they're not in the 1%,
they want to get to the 1% right.

1441
00:59:38,151 --> 00:59:40,250
Every body.
Some people would say that's not true.

1442
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,001
Some people would say,
no,

1443
00:59:41,001 --> 00:59:43,190
that's not what I want.
I want to be comfortable and I want to

1444
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:45,540
pursue whatever my interests are.
Why?

1445
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:46,700
But what,
and again,

1446
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:49,460
and what are those interests?
I mean people and be their art.

1447
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,660
Maybe it's,
yeah,

1448
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,970
but they still have to eat.
They still have,

1449
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,430
they still need clothes.
So we just wanted to be comfortable.

1450
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,500
They don't necessarily want to be a
white person,

1451
00:59:57,501 --> 01:00:00,890
but you're going to get those things
better from the free market.

1452
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:04,640
The free market is going to make you
more comfortable than a government

1453
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:06,830
program.
And if you're just trying to have a

1454
01:00:06,831 --> 01:00:07,970
shortcut and say,
look,

1455
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:09,830
you know,
just steal some money from that rich

1456
01:00:09,831 --> 01:00:11,030
person and give it to me.

1457
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:14,510
But most people even don't just want to
squeak by.

1458
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:17,540
I mean most people want to achieve
something.

1459
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:20,480
They want to strive to get the most they
can out of life.

1460
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,890
And you know,
you know,

1461
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,440
if you want to get a job,
I mean somebody has to hire you,

1462
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:27,350
somebody has to have the capital,
somebody has to be able to pay you,

1463
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:27,821
right?
You,

1464
01:00:27,821 --> 01:00:29,780
you're not going to get a job from a
poor person.

1465
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:31,250
Right.
They don't have anything to offer.

1466
01:00:31,251 --> 01:00:33,980
They don't have capital to give you.
They can't pay,

1467
01:00:33,981 --> 01:00:35,000
you know,
write a paycheck.

1468
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:36,740
You know,
so people understand,

1469
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:38,510
hey,
I got my first job from somebody in the

1470
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:39,440
1%.
Okay.

1471
01:00:39,441 --> 01:00:40,520
You know,
and now I'm,

1472
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,700
I'm in the 1% myself because I,
you know,

1473
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:46,070
I was able to gain some experience,
gain some knowledge,

1474
01:00:46,071 --> 01:00:48,800
you know,
so you could talk to younger people and

1475
01:00:48,801 --> 01:00:51,650
really show them the different,
a different path.

1476
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:52,760
One is,
you know,

1477
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,310
relying on government and thievery.
Cause that's really,

1478
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,680
you know,
most people would agree that theft is

1479
01:00:57,681 --> 01:00:58,850
wrong,
right?

1480
01:00:58,851 --> 01:01:01,820
If the two of us got together and beat
you up,

1481
01:01:01,821 --> 01:01:04,400
although obviously we can't,
but as soon as we could,

1482
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:06,140
we beat you up.
And we took your money.

1483
01:01:06,141 --> 01:01:07,220
You would say that's wrong,
right?

1484
01:01:07,221 --> 01:01:08,240
You can't do that.
Well,

1485
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:11,360
if we got together and voted for
congressman to take your money,

1486
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,070
you know,
we outvoted you two to one.

1487
01:01:13,071 --> 01:01:14,760
Why is that any any better?
I mean,

1488
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:17,420
why is it okay to steal through the
ballot box,

1489
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,020
but it's not okay to do it directly.
So the argument against that would be

1490
01:01:21,021 --> 01:01:23,720
that it's not stealing,
that you're just creating policies that

1491
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:27,710
even the playing field and that stealing
people that are in the 1% like these

1492
01:01:27,711 --> 01:01:30,320
hedge fund dudes that have these giant
houses in the Hamptons,

1493
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:34,010
they've accumulated massive amounts of
wealth and they're using that to

1494
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:38,450
influence politicians and change laws
and they shouldn't be able to use it to

1495
01:01:38,451 --> 01:01:39,680
influence politicians.

1496
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,260
That's why we have to take the influence
away from politicians,

1497
01:01:42,261 --> 01:01:45,290
take away that power.
But there is a wealthy hedge fund guy.

1498
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:48,500
That doesn't mean I have the right to go
steal his Maserati just because he's

1499
01:01:48,501 --> 01:01:51,950
rich and I don't have the right to tax
him to take that maserati either.

1500
01:01:51,951 --> 01:01:54,470
It's,
it's just another form of theft.

1501
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:57,290
When you believe in the free market,
libertarian,

1502
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:59,000
you know you're giving somebody that I
did.

1503
01:01:59,001 --> 01:02:00,740
Look,
you don't have to get rich by stealing

1504
01:02:00,741 --> 01:02:03,440
with somebody else has.
You can do it on your own and you know

1505
01:02:03,441 --> 01:02:05,360
you,
you can benefit from what other people

1506
01:02:05,361 --> 01:02:09,770
have because the only way people get
rich and a free market is by delivering

1507
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,360
service is that other people value.
The only exception is if you get rich

1508
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:18,050
through government connections.
And that is not a fault of capitalism.

1509
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:22,080
That is a fault of when you empower
government to sell favors for the

1510
01:02:22,081 --> 01:02:22,914
highest bidder.

1511
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,500
That is not an indictment of capitalism.
That is socialism,

1512
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,630
right?
And so that's what we have to stamp out.

1513
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:31,830
We have to make sure that you can't
succeed by bribing a politician,

1514
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:34,200
that you can't use government power to
create wealth.

1515
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:37,200
That if you want to get wealthy,
you have to be wealthy as a result of

1516
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:41,130
voluntary interactions with other human
beings without government involvement,

1517
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,930
right?
Government is there to protect my

1518
01:02:42,931 --> 01:02:44,730
rights,
protect my property,

1519
01:02:44,731 --> 01:02:47,940
protect my life from other people who
might infringe upon my rights from

1520
01:02:47,941 --> 01:02:50,430
people who could steal it.
But government is not there to give you

1521
01:02:50,431 --> 01:02:52,320
things.
It's not there to give you a job.

1522
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,900
It's not there to give you a health
care.

1523
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:56,640
You need to earn those things on your
own.

1524
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:59,910
And now obviously,
are there going to be people who are

1525
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:01,470
just born,
they're just not.

1526
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:05,100
They may be they have deformities or
they're not smart enough or they have

1527
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:07,470
handy some kind of and they can't fend
for themselves.

1528
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,640
Yes,
I recognize that,

1529
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,590
but my solution for that is not to,
is not to steal from some wealthy person

1530
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,320
and say and give the money to somebody
who needs it.

1531
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:21,000
I believe in voluntary charity.
I believe that human beings care enough

1532
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:24,060
about other human beings that if
somebody really is in a dire

1533
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:26,250
circumstance,
that private charity,

1534
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,800
we'll take care of them.
And what I do know is when you have

1535
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:30,040
private charity,
right,

1536
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:31,380
it's very efficient,
right?

1537
01:03:31,381 --> 01:03:31,921
If,
if,

1538
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:36,630
if you donate a dollar to a charity,
90 cents is going to go to the people

1539
01:03:36,631 --> 01:03:38,010
who need money.
Ideally,

1540
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:40,830
we have obviously some massive
exceptions to that,

1541
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:43,380
but with the government,
the government will take a dollar in

1542
01:03:43,381 --> 01:03:46,170
taxes and only 10 cents will go to the
poor people.

1543
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,210
The rest of it goes to the government
bureaucracy.

1544
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,020
And the problem with government is when
you have a private organization,

1545
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:54,600
they really want to do good,
right?

1546
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,450
I mean you have these government
antipoverty programs,

1547
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:00,270
they don't want to end poverty.
They want to expand poverty.

1548
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,520
They want,
they want more poverty because then

1549
01:04:02,521 --> 01:04:04,680
their program gets bigger.
Then they have more power.

1550
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,210
The last thing they want to do is end
poverty because now they're,

1551
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:10,740
they no longer have a job.
So they're not there to try to make sure

1552
01:04:10,741 --> 01:04:13,140
that the people who are getting the aid
actually need the aid.

1553
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:15,270
I mean,
it's different when it's private money

1554
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:16,770
and private charity,
uh,

1555
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:17,341
you know,
there,

1556
01:04:17,341 --> 01:04:20,880
you're really trying to do good instead
of just perpetuate the poverty so you

1557
01:04:20,881 --> 01:04:24,060
can grow your power base.
Have you ever sat down with Bernie

1558
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:24,930
Sanders?
No.

1559
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,630
Wouldn't you love to,
when you love to have a debate with him,

1560
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,260
like a long form conversation,
like a three hour podcasts?

1561
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:32,190
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't shy away from it.

1562
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:32,671
I mean,
I,

1563
01:04:32,671 --> 01:04:33,061
I,
you know,

1564
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:36,480
I do know he's,
he's sold at this point that it's hard

1565
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:38,520
to believe that I'm going to persuade
him that he's wrong,

1566
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:40,170
that he's going to come to his,
you know,

1567
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:42,660
after living in entire life believing in
something.

1568
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:44,100
Well,
I'm not even necessarily saying that you

1569
01:04:44,101 --> 01:04:46,380
would persuade him,
but it would be nice to see people

1570
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:47,460
counter,
you know,

1571
01:04:47,461 --> 01:04:52,130
or hear rather the counter to his
arguments that he puts forth that are

1572
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:54,930
very appealing to a lot of these young
people that you're talking about.

1573
01:04:54,931 --> 01:04:56,970
If you're 20 and you're not a liberal,
you don't have a heart,

1574
01:04:57,330 --> 01:05:00,930
you know that these,
these ideas are very pervasive in our

1575
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:05,010
culture and they were thought to be the
solution to the ails that were in,

1576
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:08,040
they were thought to be the solutions to
the problems with the bailout.

1577
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,460
Why is the government getting all this
money and giving it to the banks when

1578
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:14,500
they could be giving it to poor people
and,

1579
01:05:14,501 --> 01:05:17,990
and propping up the income inequality
like that,

1580
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,330
that,
that conversation.

1581
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:22,120
And now we're big problem.
And I knew that at the beginning because

1582
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:24,310
see I was,
I was against the bailouts,

1583
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,580
but I knew that when the government
bails out banks,

1584
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:29,500
now you've created a precedent.
Wait a minute,

1585
01:05:29,501 --> 01:05:31,990
if you're going to bail out those banks,
why not bail out the little guy?

1586
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:34,540
Right.
And I have a lot of sympathy for that

1587
01:05:34,541 --> 01:05:37,030
argument,
but I don't think two wrongs make a

1588
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:38,750
right.
We shouldn't have bailed out the banks.

1589
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:41,410
See the government shouldn't steal money
from,

1590
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,600
from one person and give it to somebody
else.

1591
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,300
You know,
regardless of who they're there,

1592
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:47,830
they're there,
they're giving it to.

1593
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:51,160
But once you create that precedent,
and of course,

1594
01:05:51,161 --> 01:05:53,110
you know,
a lot of people should have been allowed

1595
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:56,050
to lose money in that financial crisis.
A lot of banks should have failed.

1596
01:05:56,051 --> 01:05:59,020
A lot of people should have lost their
jobs and they didn't.

1597
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:02,470
And so that's a moral hazard because the
government created a condition and said,

1598
01:06:02,471 --> 01:06:04,810
hey,
if you're going to speculate and do all

1599
01:06:04,811 --> 01:06:05,644
these things,
you know,

1600
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,910
you know,
we're going to bail you out.

1601
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:08,260
And you know,
it wasn't,

1602
01:06:08,261 --> 01:06:09,850
you have to realize that it was the
government,

1603
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:12,070
the government was guaranteeing all
those mortgages.

1604
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,040
The governor was guaranteeing all those
bank banks,

1605
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:16,960
bank deposits.
The government was through Fannie and

1606
01:06:16,961 --> 01:06:19,870
Freddie,
encouraging reckless activity,

1607
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:23,650
encouraging banks to make loans to
people who they knew couldn't pay it

1608
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:24,131
back.
I mean,

1609
01:06:24,131 --> 01:06:28,150
all this was rooted in government
incentives and government subsidies.

1610
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:31,810
If there was a pure free market,
the banks would not be able to assume

1611
01:06:31,811 --> 01:06:34,150
all that risk.
But because the government,

1612
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:36,660
you know,
had their back then they were be able,

1613
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,430
they were able to do things that the
free market never would have allowed.

1614
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,840
That's why for years,
you know,

1615
01:06:40,841 --> 01:06:43,900
while the housing bubble was going up,
I was pointing this stuff out.

1616
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:44,780
I mean,
you go and you know,

1617
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,290
look at some of the youtube videos,
um,

1618
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:50,140
you know,
for all of my appearances back then that

1619
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:52,120
eventually became that Peter Schiff was
right video.

1620
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:55,770
Um,
I understood the,

1621
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:58,690
the ultimate consequences of what the
government was doing,

1622
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,390
you know,
but then the bailouts just,

1623
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:02,920
you know,
allowed the government,

1624
01:07:02,921 --> 01:07:05,020
like the government never wants to waste
a crisis.

1625
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,910
They always want to use the crisis to
get bigger,

1626
01:07:06,911 --> 01:07:09,730
to get more power.
We should have learned something from

1627
01:07:09,731 --> 01:07:12,250
the 2008 financial crisis.
Instead,

1628
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,170
we have repeated all the mistakes,
right.

1629
01:07:14,171 --> 01:07:17,500
Everything that has been done by Janet
Yellen and Ben Bernakie,

1630
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:21,610
since the financial crisis has actually
made the u s economy worse,

1631
01:07:21,611 --> 01:07:24,040
we're in much worse shape now,
economically.

1632
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,440
So I think the crisis that we're coming
to,

1633
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:30,020
the next one is going to be much worse
than the one we had to know.

1634
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:32,530
Eight to get to that in a second.
But what,

1635
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:36,220
what was the argument for the bailout?
Well,

1636
01:07:36,221 --> 01:07:38,980
the argument for the bailout was that
the banks were just so big,

1637
01:07:38,981 --> 01:07:39,491
right?
They were,

1638
01:07:39,491 --> 01:07:41,040
they were interconnected.
Yeah.

1639
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:45,520
And that if we let them fail,
it's just going to be so much worse.

1640
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:46,570
Right.
Cause it's just,

1641
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:47,403
you know,
we got,

1642
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:47,980
you know,
we,

1643
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,170
we got to a bail amount because,
you know,

1644
01:07:50,171 --> 01:07:52,390
even though it's bad,
it'll be worse if we don't do it.

1645
01:07:52,391 --> 01:07:56,650
People like me and maybe Jamie had money
in these banks and that money would

1646
01:07:56,651 --> 01:07:58,660
dissolve.
Well people would have lost,

1647
01:07:58,661 --> 01:08:00,820
certainly would deposit of,
had lost some money.

1648
01:08:00,821 --> 01:08:02,560
Yes they would have.
But you know,

1649
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:05,520
I agree that had we not done the
bailouts,

1650
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:09,550
it would have been worse,
but it would have been healthy.

1651
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,190
It would have been a step in the right
direction.

1652
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:12,961
You know,
you,

1653
01:08:12,961 --> 01:08:13,930
you know,
you work out,

1654
01:08:13,931 --> 01:08:15,560
it's like no pain,
no gain.

1655
01:08:15,561 --> 01:08:16,041
I mean,
you know,

1656
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:16,874
like,
you know,

1657
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:17,950
we,
we,

1658
01:08:17,951 --> 01:08:20,840
you've got to bite the bullet on this
and,

1659
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:21,281
and,
and,

1660
01:08:21,281 --> 01:08:22,280
and,
and do what's right.

1661
01:08:22,281 --> 01:08:23,380
Or I look at it like,
you know,

1662
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:27,530
we were strung out on cheap money.
We were like a drug addict.

1663
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:31,910
And had we just gone cold Turkey and
gone into Rehab,

1664
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,580
yeah.
It would have been a big downer.

1665
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,170
Right.
It wouldn't have been pleasant.

1666
01:08:36,171 --> 01:08:37,910
And we would had to go through all this
stuff,

1667
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:42,200
but at the end of the day we could
emerge healthy instead models

1668
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,970
being projected,
projected,

1669
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,490
like did bid,
people look at the two possibilities,

1670
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:51,260
like having no bail out and we were
looking at us here in nine years later

1671
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:52,740
or having available,

1672
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:53,321
well,
you know,

1673
01:08:53,321 --> 01:08:55,330
I don't think they,
if they looked at anything,

1674
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,770
it was just very short term,
right.

1675
01:08:56,771 --> 01:08:58,750
Because all these guys are politically
motivated,

1676
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,040
right?
An election is coming up,

1677
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:02,320
right.
Because all the bailouts happened,

1678
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:03,483
uh,
in,

1679
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,050
uh,
summer of Oh eight,

1680
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,140
a lot of big ones.
And the election was in November of

1681
01:09:08,141 --> 01:09:08,890
[inaudible] eight.
Right.

1682
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:13,870
I remember John Mccain interrupted his
presidential campaign to come vote for a

1683
01:09:13,871 --> 01:09:15,270
tarp bailout.
And,

1684
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:18,550
and so politicians can't see beyond the
next election.

1685
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:22,180
And if your horizon is that short,
yes,

1686
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:26,950
the bailouts ease the pain,
but at the cost of exacerbating the

1687
01:09:26,951 --> 01:09:29,470
underlying disease,
that is the cause of the pain.

1688
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:33,640
So because we did all the wrong things
and o eight o nine o 10,

1689
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:37,840
instead of fixing the problems and
having a healthy recovery,

1690
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:40,960
we have the weakest recovery in the
history of recoveries.

1691
01:09:40,961 --> 01:09:42,640
In fact,
I don't even think it's a recovery cause

1692
01:09:42,641 --> 01:09:46,480
I think the average American is sicker
now than he was when the recovery began.

1693
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,600
Well,
you look at personal net worth has gone

1694
01:09:49,601 --> 01:09:51,820
down.
Real incomes have gone down.

1695
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:56,800
We've eviscerated the labor force.
I mean people have lost good paying jobs

1696
01:09:56,890 --> 01:09:59,860
and they now have two or three low
paying part time jobs.

1697
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,170
People are working longer for less.
Uh,

1698
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,870
their net worths of gone down.
They're loaded up with debt.

1699
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:09,160
We now have record high cardio loans,
record high credit card debt record,

1700
01:10:09,161 --> 01:10:11,560
high student loans.
The only thing we don't have as record

1701
01:10:11,561 --> 01:10:13,480
mortgage debt.
And that's because home ownership is now

1702
01:10:13,481 --> 01:10:17,200
at a 60 year low.
But we do have rising rents and so our

1703
01:10:17,201 --> 01:10:19,100
standard of living is falling,
uh,

1704
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:22,480
because we didn't do the right thing.
But because we didn't do the right

1705
01:10:22,481 --> 01:10:24,820
thing,
this next crisis,

1706
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:27,040
as I said,
is going to be so much worse where we're

1707
01:10:27,041 --> 01:10:30,970
just going from crisis to crisis because
nobody has the guts to do the right

1708
01:10:30,971 --> 01:10:34,240
thing because in the short run it means
they might not get reelected,

1709
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:34,630
right?

1710
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,580
Nobody wants to get reelected,
promising.

1711
01:10:36,581 --> 01:10:38,140
You know what?
Things are bad.

1712
01:10:38,141 --> 01:10:40,990
We've made a lot of mistakes.
We're going to have to suffer through

1713
01:10:40,991 --> 01:10:43,540
this recession.
People are going to lose money.

1714
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:45,250
People are going to lose their jobs,
but you know what?

1715
01:10:45,251 --> 01:10:47,470
Don't worry.
The free market is going to work.

1716
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:49,310
You'll get different jobs.
You'll get your,

1717
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:51,910
you know,
nobody has the guts to tell the truth to

1718
01:10:51,911 --> 01:10:54,580
the voters.
Everyone wants to pretend that they've

1719
01:10:54,581 --> 01:10:55,331
got,
you know,

1720
01:10:55,331 --> 01:10:56,164
it's like,
you know,

1721
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:59,080
by my Miracle Cure,
you don't have to work out.

1722
01:10:59,081 --> 01:11:01,430
You don't have to die it just rub this
cream on your,

1723
01:11:01,431 --> 01:11:03,130
your thighs and the side lights going to
go away.

1724
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:05,380
That's what people want.
They don't want to be told,

1725
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,810
you gotta hit the gym and you've got to
stop eating junk food.

1726
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,300
They want the miracle cream.
That's the guy that gets the vote.

1727
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:13,800
So we set ourselves up for,
I think a crisis,

1728
01:11:13,801 --> 01:11:17,430
not just a financial crisis where were
mortgages are in trouble,

1729
01:11:17,431 --> 01:11:19,980
but we're,
the dollar itself is collapsing,

1730
01:11:19,981 --> 01:11:23,340
our money is collapsing,
prices are skyrocketing.

1731
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,510
It's going to really hit the average
American much more than just the stock

1732
01:11:27,511 --> 01:11:29,850
market going down.
But when your money is going down,

1733
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,640
right,
when the cost of living is skyrocketing,

1734
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,430
right,
that is going to be a big problem for a

1735
01:11:35,431 --> 01:11:37,200
lot of people,
that that's where we're headed.

1736
01:11:37,201 --> 01:11:39,000
It's ultimately going to be a dollar
crisis.

1737
01:11:39,001 --> 01:11:40,250
And that's really,
you know,

1738
01:11:40,251 --> 01:11:42,630
like my,
in my business in my brokerage firm and

1739
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:44,790
Euro Pacific capital,
that's what I've tried to do is help

1740
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:49,170
people protect their wealth by getting
out of US dollar assets by investing in

1741
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:52,110
Singapore and Switzerland and New
Zealand and Hong Kong and other

1742
01:11:52,111 --> 01:11:54,600
countries owning other assets,
you know,

1743
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:58,530
to try to protect themselves from this
crisis that you know is coming.

1744
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,630
You know,
and most people are going to get

1745
01:12:00,631 --> 01:12:02,730
blindsided by just like they were by the
last one.

1746
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:06,780
So what is the crisis and how exactly do
you feel it's going to go down?

1747
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:10,010
Because I did watch some of your videos
about the housing crisis from 2008

1748
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,080
you're predicting it years in advance.
Yeah,

1749
01:12:12,081 --> 01:12:12,950
I mean look,
you know,

1750
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,810
things always happen,
you know,

1751
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:18,320
I see things years before they happen
cause like you're not the only one,

1752
01:12:18,321 --> 01:12:18,860
right?
No.

1753
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:21,350
This is something amongst your peers and
your colleagues,

1754
01:12:21,351 --> 01:12:22,910
you guys are all discussing this.
Well,

1755
01:12:22,911 --> 01:12:24,350
I mean,
I mean there are people,

1756
01:12:24,351 --> 01:12:24,720
oh

1757
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,570
most people who feel the way I do maybe
aren't,

1758
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:30,840
they weren't on television saying it.
They were saying it to their buddies,

1759
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:32,520
you know,
in their own living rooms and they were

1760
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:34,070
getting laughed at just like I was,
you know,

1761
01:12:34,071 --> 01:12:35,760
I guess I used to get emails from
people,

1762
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:37,380
Hey,
I've been saying this is exactly what

1763
01:12:37,381 --> 01:12:40,320
I've been saying and everybody thinks
I'm crazy and you know,

1764
01:12:40,321 --> 01:12:41,640
it's just,
you know,

1765
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:43,140
they're the same one.
It's everybody else.

1766
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:44,160
That's crazy.
That just,

1767
01:12:44,161 --> 01:12:48,540
it gets caught up in it.
But what's going to happen is we are

1768
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:51,900
going to go back at some point into
another statistic.

1769
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:53,910
Recession.
I mean I think that we've kind of been

1770
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:57,240
in one this whole recovery cause I don't
think the government numbers are really

1771
01:12:57,241 --> 01:13:00,540
that accurate.
I don't think that inflation is as low

1772
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:03,690
as they claim at least as measured by
the consumer prices.

1773
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:07,710
So I think that the economy has actually
been contracting during the years that

1774
01:13:07,711 --> 01:13:11,010
we've been pretending it's been growing.
But I do think at some point

1775
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:15,870
statistically we will go back into a
technical recession where even the

1776
01:13:15,871 --> 01:13:18,150
government admits that the economy
shrinking,

1777
01:13:18,151 --> 01:13:21,990
right where the GDP is negative for a
couple of quarters in a row and then

1778
01:13:21,991 --> 01:13:24,240
what is the government going to do as a
result of that?

1779
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:25,890
They're going to do exactly what they
did before.

1780
01:13:25,891 --> 01:13:28,980
They're going to take interest rates and
bring them back to zero from wherever

1781
01:13:28,981 --> 01:13:30,360
they are.
The differences.

1782
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:33,720
Normally they lower interest rates and
then by the time there's another

1783
01:13:33,721 --> 01:13:37,680
recession their way back up,
four or five 6% this time they,

1784
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:41,760
they barely got him back to 1% and they
kept them at zero for seven,

1785
01:13:41,761 --> 01:13:43,380
eight years,
which is unprecedented.

1786
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:48,060
And of course the mistakes that are made
are consequence of money being too

1787
01:13:48,061 --> 01:13:48,600
cheap,
right?

1788
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,340
The reason that we had a real estate
bubble,

1789
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:54,390
the main reason was because Alan
Greenspan lowered interest rates to 1%

1790
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:57,990
and left them there for about a year and
a half and then took about a year and a

1791
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:59,670
half to rise to raise him back up to
normal.

1792
01:13:59,671 --> 01:14:03,810
So you had a few years of artificially
low interest rates and that gave us this

1793
01:14:03,811 --> 01:14:05,070
huge housing bubble.
Well,

1794
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,020
we had seven,
eight years of zero.

1795
01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:09,240
I mean the,
the mistakes that had been made under

1796
01:14:09,241 --> 01:14:11,980
Obama dwarfs the mistakes that were made
under Bush.

1797
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,670
And these are mistakes that are a
consequence of money being too cheap of

1798
01:14:15,671 --> 01:14:18,940
the government setting the price of
money as opposed to the free market.

1799
01:14:18,941 --> 01:14:21,100
You get too much debt,
you get too much speculation.

1800
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:25,990
And so we've got a much bigger bubble
now and when the,

1801
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,390
this one pops because it's so much
bigger,

1802
01:14:28,391 --> 01:14:30,820
right?
So then all of a sudden the Fed has to

1803
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:31,960
cut interest rates again.

1804
01:14:31,990 --> 01:14:35,110
And now what happens to the dollar?
Because see the dollar has been rising

1805
01:14:35,111 --> 01:14:37,690
in these past few years because
everybody thought,

1806
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:39,400
oh,
the Fed's going to normalize interest

1807
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:41,020
rates.
The Fed is going to shrink the balance

1808
01:14:41,021 --> 01:14:45,190
sheet when none of this stuff happens.
When the Fed goes back to another round

1809
01:14:45,191 --> 01:14:47,380
of quantitative easing,
when they got to crank up the printing

1810
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:49,720
presses,
when they don't shrink the balance

1811
01:14:49,721 --> 01:14:51,130
sheet,
but they bloat even bigger,

1812
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,720
right?
It goes to five and a half trillion,

1813
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:55,660
six and a half trillion.
I think the bottom's to drop out of the

1814
01:14:55,661 --> 01:14:57,250
dollar.
I think the dollar is going to get

1815
01:14:57,251 --> 01:14:59,680
killed.
The opposite of what happened in Oh

1816
01:14:59,681 --> 01:15:01,720
eight when the financial crisis hit no
aid,

1817
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,670
the dollar had been falling for seven
years.

1818
01:15:03,671 --> 01:15:06,820
It was at an all time record low,
and then when the crisis hit,

1819
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,220
it actually caused people to buy the
dollar.

1820
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,130
Uh,
but I think this next crisis is going to

1821
01:15:12,131 --> 01:15:15,640
be the big sell signal for the dollar.
It's because people are going to rush

1822
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:20,650
out of the dollar as the Fed has to go
back to more qe as people realize that

1823
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:23,680
this is what I said from the beginning,
this is a monetary roach motel,

1824
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:25,630
right?
The Fed checked us in and they ain't

1825
01:15:25,631 --> 01:15:28,030
checking us out.
There's no way to normalize rates.

1826
01:15:28,031 --> 01:15:29,890
There's no way to shrink the balance
sheet,

1827
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:33,190
and when people realize that this is a
permanent situation,

1828
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:36,760
the bottom drops out of the dollar and
then commodity prices really start to

1829
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:39,040
rise.
Remember when oil prices went from like

1830
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:43,960
$20 a barrel and 19 and 2001 up to 150
right?

1831
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:47,680
That was happening because the dollar
was falling and as the dollar starts to

1832
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:49,620
fall,
all these commodity prices are gonna

1833
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:53,470
rise again and now inflation is really
going to pick up the way they measure it

1834
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,940
and the,
the governor can't do anything about it.

1835
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:57,850
They can't raise interest rates because
if they raise interest rates,

1836
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,880
they collapse everything.
All the banks that were too big to fail.

1837
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:03,220
They're bigger now,
and it would be even worse if they

1838
01:16:03,221 --> 01:16:05,300
failed.
So they can't let rates go up because

1839
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,930
banks absorbed other banks,
they got bigger,

1840
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,650
and now you have all these banks that
have all these long term loans that have

1841
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:14,260
low coupons on them.
If interest rates go up,

1842
01:16:14,290 --> 01:16:16,000
all these big banks are going to fail.
I mean,

1843
01:16:16,001 --> 01:16:18,550
people think rising rates are going to
be good for banks.

1844
01:16:18,551 --> 01:16:21,160
They're gonna destroy the banks.
They're gonna destroy the housing

1845
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:21,880
market.
I mean,

1846
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,440
and the government,
this is the biggest thing.

1847
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:26,620
Look at the national debt.
The national debt is about 20 trillion,

1848
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:28,540
the bonded debt.
And that,

1849
01:16:28,541 --> 01:16:30,760
of course,
that doesn't even count all the unfunded

1850
01:16:30,761 --> 01:16:32,980
liabilities.
That's just where the government has

1851
01:16:32,981 --> 01:16:33,970
sold a bond,
right?

1852
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:36,010
A treasury bond,
that's about 20 trillion.

1853
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:39,880
But what would happen if interest rates
went to 10% well,

1854
01:16:39,881 --> 01:16:44,620
it would cost the government $2 trillion
a year just to pay the interest on that

1855
01:16:44,621 --> 01:16:47,980
20,000 on the 20 trillion we don't have
anywhere close to that.

1856
01:16:47,981 --> 01:16:49,120
I mean,
right now,

1857
01:16:49,121 --> 01:16:52,600
interest rates are almost zero.
And we're spending about 250 billion a

1858
01:16:52,601 --> 01:16:56,200
year on interest.
But if interest rates actually went up

1859
01:16:56,410 --> 01:17:00,250
because the Fed had to fight inflation,
the treasurer would have to default.

1860
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:02,860
They would have to tell the cro,
we can't pay on these bonds.

1861
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:03,910
What are you showing me?
Jamie's this,

1862
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:07,900
the national debt.
The national debt is 20 trillion yet.

1863
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,400
Oh,
it's so clause 19

1864
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:13,580
nine seven three looking at spinning.
Oh God.

1865
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:14,443
Yeah,
I know it.

1866
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:16,480
Terrific.
But um,

1867
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:20,480
and so obviously the Fed has to keep
interest rates low so the government can

1868
01:17:20,481 --> 01:17:22,310
service that debt.
Look at Medicare,

1869
01:17:22,311 --> 01:17:23,630
Medicaid,
Jesus Christ.

1870
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,290
What is happening?
You add it all up.

1871
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:27,980
You didn't even a billion.
Is that a trillion?

1872
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:31,010
Huh?
What does that right there?

1873
01:17:31,011 --> 01:17:32,000
What is that?
No,

1874
01:17:32,001 --> 01:17:33,380
that's one point.
1 trillion.

1875
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:34,820
Oh,
it is.

1876
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:37,350
That's a lot of those budget items.
Those are budget items.

1877
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:39,170
That's the budget.
Social Security,

1878
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:41,240
that's not the debt.
That's what they're spending.

1879
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:42,460
Oh,
see,

1880
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,320
look at those numbers.
If you go down lower you,

1881
01:17:44,321 --> 01:17:48,260
they'll probably have all the unfunded
liabilities that page somewhere,

1882
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,480
you know,
and then they break it down and they

1883
01:17:50,481 --> 01:17:52,940
break it down per capita,
per tax payer.

1884
01:17:52,941 --> 01:17:53,481
I mean,
it's an art,

1885
01:17:53,481 --> 01:17:57,860
but my point is that we've got like an
adjustable rate mortgage on that

1886
01:17:57,861 --> 01:17:58,490
national debt.

1887
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:00,260
The government,
Scot ultra cheap money.

1888
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:03,740
If interest rates spike,
there's no way that the government can

1889
01:18:03,741 --> 01:18:05,570
pay that debt.
This is hypnotic.

1890
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,450
It really is terrifying.
They're seen it before.

1891
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,320
I've never seen it before either.
That's why I'm saying Puerto Rico,

1892
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:12,381
Puerto Rico,
it'd be,

1893
01:18:12,381 --> 01:18:17,030
it would be so idiotic for Puerto Rico
to want to join the union and absorb

1894
01:18:17,031 --> 01:18:18,200
their share of that debt.
Now,

1895
01:18:18,201 --> 01:18:21,680
for the average person like myself,
was zero understanding of the financial

1896
01:18:21,681 --> 01:18:22,880
system.
You listen to trump,

1897
01:18:22,881 --> 01:18:27,280
talk about the economy booming and it's
on an upward the thing and the

1898
01:18:27,281 --> 01:18:30,470
unemployment is down and jobs are up.

1899
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:32,100
Yeah,
I mean bullshit.

1900
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:34,020
Yeah.
That's what's really bothering me about

1901
01:18:34,021 --> 01:18:37,710
trump is the hypocrisy.
Because when trump was a candidate and

1902
01:18:37,711 --> 01:18:40,950
he got elected,
because by and large he told the truth

1903
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:44,850
about the phony nature of the recovery.
Obama was out there talking about how

1904
01:18:44,851 --> 01:18:46,890
great things were,
and trump was like,

1905
01:18:46,891 --> 01:18:47,970
bs.
It's not great.

1906
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:49,650
Oh,
you're talking about low unemployment.

1907
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:54,060
That number is bogus.
The real unemployment rate is 20% or 25%

1908
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:56,400
is people stopped looking for jobs and
it doesn't count anymore.

1909
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,353
People are,
you know,

1910
01:18:57,390 --> 01:18:59,550
they gave up looking.
So they don't have a job.

1911
01:18:59,551 --> 01:19:03,120
They're not counted as being unemployed.
And he pointed out that all the jobs

1912
01:19:03,121 --> 01:19:04,260
like here,
this is irony,

1913
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:06,780
right?
So what are the byproducts of obamacare?

1914
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:10,350
Obamacare said that if you have a full
time worker,

1915
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:13,050
you have to give him health insurance.
Right?

1916
01:19:13,051 --> 01:19:15,690
And full time was anyone that worked 30
hours or more?

1917
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:17,340
Well,
employers aren't dumb.

1918
01:19:17,341 --> 01:19:18,450
They can do math.
Hey,

1919
01:19:18,451 --> 01:19:21,510
if I,
if this guy is working 40 hours a week,

1920
01:19:21,511 --> 01:19:23,040
I got,
I got to give them health insurance,

1921
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:25,860
which is very expensive.
But if he works 29 hours a week,

1922
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:26,910
I don't.
Right.

1923
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:29,880
So what happened?
Employers started transitioning their

1924
01:19:29,881 --> 01:19:33,330
workforces from full time workers to
part time workers.

1925
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:35,730
Well,
what happens if I'm going to have only

1926
01:19:35,731 --> 01:19:38,040
part time workers,
I'm going to have more workers,

1927
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,140
Greg,
because each one is working fewer hours.

1928
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:43,410
So I'm going to have to have more.
I have more jobs,

1929
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:44,244
right?
If I have,

1930
01:19:44,430 --> 01:19:47,460
if I had 500 part time jobs,
but now I have a thousand,

1931
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,660
I mean if I had 500 full time employees,
but now I have a thousand part time

1932
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:53,910
employees,
that's twice as many jobs.

1933
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,550
Obama got credit for all those extra
jobs,

1934
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:57,473
right?
As we were,

1935
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:02,130
as we were destroying fulltime jobs and
replacing them with two part time jobs.

1936
01:20:02,310 --> 01:20:05,790
We got all these jobs.
So trump was honest as it candidate.

1937
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:09,210
These are low paying,
these are crappy jobs,

1938
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,890
you know?
And a lot of the people that were

1939
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:13,710
getting jobs were older people who don't
want jobs.

1940
01:20:13,711 --> 01:20:17,430
They were retired and now they're
working at Mcdonald's part time because

1941
01:20:17,431 --> 01:20:19,350
they can't live on their retirement
money.

1942
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:20,513
And in fact,
you know,

1943
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,100
when you look at the labor force
participation rate that he would talk

1944
01:20:23,101 --> 01:20:24,450
about,
you know,

1945
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:28,530
we're labor force participation is
collapsing is with young people.

1946
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,540
People in their twenties and thirties
can't get jobs.

1947
01:20:30,541 --> 01:20:34,080
Meanwhile 70 and 80 year olds are
working in record percentages,

1948
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:36,060
right?
Cause they can't afford to retire and

1949
01:20:36,061 --> 01:20:40,530
their grandkids can't get a job.
But so trump was telling the truth about

1950
01:20:40,531 --> 01:20:43,080
how bad the economy really was.
And that resonated.

1951
01:20:43,081 --> 01:20:48,081
A lot of blue collar guys,
a lot of Democrats in the Midwest voted

1952
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:52,470
for trump because he got it,
he understood their p felt their pain,

1953
01:20:52,471 --> 01:20:52,680
right?

1954
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:55,940
Like Bill Clinton and Obama was in a
fantasy of an,

1955
01:20:55,941 --> 01:21:00,360
hillary was pretending that everything
was great under Obama and people didn't

1956
01:21:00,361 --> 01:21:02,820
want four more years of that.
So they voted for trump.

1957
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:03,871
And also,
you know,

1958
01:21:03,871 --> 01:21:07,530
when trump was a candidate,
he talked about the stock market because

1959
01:21:07,531 --> 01:21:10,650
all of the stock market was going up
when Obama was president.

1960
01:21:10,651 --> 01:21:11,371
And trump said,
well,

1961
01:21:11,371 --> 01:21:13,440
it's a bubble.
Who cares about the stock market?

1962
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:15,180
This is a big fat,
ugly bubble.

1963
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:16,680
Wait til it pops.
Okay.

1964
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:19,230
He was right about that.
Now he's president.

1965
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,120
What is he saying?
Every time I see him,

1966
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:23,850
this stock market's a new record high.
This is fantastic.

1967
01:21:23,851 --> 01:21:25,170
You know,
it's all because of me.

1968
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:27,540
This is great.
And when the jobs numbers come out,

1969
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:28,320
oh,
this is,

1970
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,200
look how low the unemployment rate is.
This is the lowest it's been in 15

1971
01:21:31,201 --> 01:21:32,700
years.
I'm doing a great job.

1972
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,380
I'm doing,
nothing has changed.

1973
01:21:34,381 --> 01:21:36,570
This is the exact same economy he
inherited.

1974
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:40,020
It's the same crappy jobs.
It's the same stock market bubble.

1975
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,810
The only difference is he's not a
candidate anymore.

1976
01:21:42,811 --> 01:21:47,310
He's the president and now he's trying
to market the same crappy economy that

1977
01:21:47,311 --> 01:21:49,680
Obama had and pretending everything is
good.

1978
01:21:49,681 --> 01:21:53,670
And I wish he was.
Steve would stay true to the candidate

1979
01:21:53,790 --> 01:21:54,720
and admit,
you know what,

1980
01:21:54,721 --> 01:21:57,750
the economy is still a disaster because
nothing has changed,

1981
01:21:57,751 --> 01:21:59,430
right?
He was gonna drain the swamp.

1982
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:02,490
Instead he just poured more water in the
same swap,

1983
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,160
let you know.
But to actually drain it means to really

1984
01:22:05,161 --> 01:22:07,590
shake things up.
And in a way he's shaking things up,

1985
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:09,990
but not the way that's going to get
meaningful change.

1986
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:11,280
For the country,
right?

1987
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:14,430
The shaking up that he's doing is not
what people were voting for,

1988
01:22:14,730 --> 01:22:17,490
right?
We really need real substantive economic

1989
01:22:17,491 --> 01:22:20,310
change,
but the president is not able to deliver

1990
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:21,930
it.
And he's surrounded himself with the

1991
01:22:21,931 --> 01:22:24,750
same cronies that,
that were around in the Bush

1992
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:25,650
administration.
I mean,

1993
01:22:25,651 --> 01:22:27,760
what good is going back to Bush?
What,

1994
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:30,110
what does his incentive to do this in
the first place?

1995
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:32,240
The guys already wealthy.
I mean,

1996
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:34,850
and then he gets into this position and
now he's a salesman.

1997
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,730
Right now he's trying to sell us on his
ax and everything's great.

1998
01:22:37,731 --> 01:22:39,830
And under him,
everything's booming and it's going to

1999
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:41,180
keep booming.
It's going to get better,

2000
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:42,980
and we're going to make America great
again.

2001
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,001
Yeah.
You know,

2002
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,680
it was a good slogan.
And you know why?

2003
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:47,090
I mean,
trump's always been a salesman,

2004
01:22:47,091 --> 01:22:47,540
right?
He's a,

2005
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:48,800
he's a marketer.
He's his,

2006
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:50,540
he makes money on his brands,
right?

2007
01:22:50,541 --> 01:22:51,860
So that's,
that's in his blood.

2008
01:22:51,861 --> 01:22:53,410
That's what he does.
And he obviously does it,

2009
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:56,270
does it well,
because he became very successful.

2010
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:57,231
Uh,
you know,

2011
01:22:57,231 --> 01:23:00,350
marketing is brand.
And so I think he's Kinda continuing

2012
01:23:00,351 --> 01:23:01,600
that.
Um,

2013
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:02,331
but,
you know,

2014
01:23:02,331 --> 01:23:04,160
does he think about his legacy?
I mean,

2015
01:23:04,161 --> 01:23:06,100
does he want to actually a difference?

2016
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,800
Does he,
does he care about posterity and how

2017
01:23:08,801 --> 01:23:10,240
he's viewed?
You know,

2018
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:11,051
I don't know.
I mean,

2019
01:23:11,051 --> 01:23:13,690
if he,
is he just trying to get reelected to so

2020
01:23:13,691 --> 01:23:15,970
we can be the president again?
I don't know.

2021
01:23:15,971 --> 01:23:17,890
I'd have to,
I've never had a conversation with him

2022
01:23:17,891 --> 01:23:19,810
and I met him.
I think I only remember meeting him one

2023
01:23:19,811 --> 01:23:22,000
time.
I was at a concert and we were sitting

2024
01:23:22,001 --> 01:23:23,890
like on the same row.
He was right next to me.

2025
01:23:23,891 --> 01:23:24,724
It was a,
uh,

2026
01:23:25,170 --> 01:23:25,730
it was,
uh,

2027
01:23:25,730 --> 01:23:27,730
a crosby stills,
Nash and young.

2028
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:31,060
And so I happen to,
and he was there with his daughter and I

2029
01:23:31,061 --> 01:23:32,980
think it was,
I think it was,

2030
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,360
you know,
her fiance,

2031
01:23:34,361 --> 01:23:36,520
I don't think they were married yet,
but they're married now so that they

2032
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:37,840
were there.
I got to say hello.

2033
01:23:37,841 --> 01:23:39,460
And I think that's the only time I ever
met him.

2034
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:42,580
And so it wasn't really,
I didn't get a chance to engage him in

2035
01:23:42,581 --> 01:23:46,390
any kind of thoughtful conversation.
I know a lot of people who know him

2036
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:47,321
right.
I mean,

2037
01:23:47,321 --> 01:23:49,120
I know a lot of people who have been in
his circle,

2038
01:23:49,121 --> 01:23:51,310
but they've never kind of introduced me
to it.

2039
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,510
So I'm kind of,
you know,

2040
01:23:52,511 --> 01:23:54,700
I'm not really on the inside,
so I can't really,

2041
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:55,690
you know,
don't really know.

2042
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,400
Um,
but I mean,

2043
01:23:57,401 --> 01:23:59,890
I voted for him,
but that was why you vote for him.

2044
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:02,450
Because I didn't want to vote for
Hillary now.

2045
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:04,270
I knew it didn't matter cause I lived in
Connecticut.

2046
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:04,931
Oh.
And by the way,

2047
01:24:04,931 --> 01:24:06,910
now that I live in Puerto Rico,
I can't vote anymore.

2048
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:08,260
But you know,
it's like,

2049
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:09,580
that's one of the things people say
that,

2050
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:11,440
oh,
Puerto Rico's in trouble because you

2051
01:24:11,441 --> 01:24:12,460
can't vote.
Who Cares?

2052
01:24:12,461 --> 01:24:15,280
Everyone I voted for in Connecticut lost
in Congress.

2053
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,000
Right.
Cause you know,

2054
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,350
it doesn't matter.
They don't have congressional

2055
01:24:17,351 --> 01:24:21,400
representation because I'd rather have
no taxes and no vote then to be able to

2056
01:24:21,401 --> 01:24:23,860
vote for who taxes me.
But,

2057
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:25,240
um,
I voted for him.

2058
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:26,800
Um,
I mean,

2059
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:28,750
I normally would just vote for Gary
Johnson.

2060
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,850
Right.
I had voted for Gary Johnson before

2061
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:33,160
because this is the second time you ran.
I voted for him the last time.

2062
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:35,110
Um,
but,

2063
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:36,430
um,
but,

2064
01:24:36,431 --> 01:24:38,140
you know,
on the way to the polls,

2065
01:24:38,141 --> 01:24:39,040
my wife was like,
you know,

2066
01:24:39,041 --> 01:24:40,960
we got to vote for trump because it was
like,

2067
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:43,990
he was like the best protest vote I
could cast.

2068
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:46,150
I thought,
I thought he was a bigger in your face

2069
01:24:46,151 --> 01:24:50,680
to the establishment then voting for
Gary Johnson was,

2070
01:24:50,681 --> 01:24:52,540
and I didn't,
and they ran a bad campaign.

2071
01:24:52,541 --> 01:24:56,080
They really blew an opportunity to have
done something with the libertarian

2072
01:24:56,081 --> 01:24:57,410
brand,
uh,

2073
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:58,510
for future elections.

2074
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:00,710
So I wasn't happy with the way that
campaign ran.

2075
01:25:00,711 --> 01:25:02,920
And they had,
they had an opportunity there with how

2076
01:25:02,921 --> 01:25:05,800
unpopular both candidates were.
Uh,

2077
01:25:05,801 --> 01:25:06,550
but I,
you know,

2078
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:07,930
I just felt,
you know,

2079
01:25:07,931 --> 01:25:09,040
this is the wave.
And,

2080
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:10,570
and I,
I thought trump was going to win.

2081
01:25:10,571 --> 01:25:11,830
You know,
everybody thought that there's no way

2082
01:25:11,831 --> 01:25:13,260
he's going to win.
And you know,

2083
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:13,841
I thought,
well,

2084
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:14,980
he might lose.
I mean,

2085
01:25:14,981 --> 01:25:17,380
I didn't think it was 100% guarantee,
but I thought,

2086
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:21,730
I thought he was more likely to win than
lose because I thought other people

2087
01:25:21,731 --> 01:25:24,880
would think the same way.
I knew the economy was a lot worse than

2088
01:25:24,881 --> 01:25:28,030
was being portrayed by the media,
by the Federal Reserve,

2089
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,910
by Obama.
And I thought a lot of people would,

2090
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:31,781
you know,
would vote that way.

2091
01:25:31,781 --> 01:25:32,800
And I knew the polls,
you know,

2092
01:25:32,820 --> 01:25:36,130
maybe not be trusted because people
didn't want to tell the pollsters that

2093
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,720
they were voting for trump because you
know,

2094
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:39,250
oh,
what are you a racist,

2095
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:40,113
you know,
why you vote?

2096
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:41,530
But you know,
when they get in there and vote,

2097
01:25:41,531 --> 01:25:42,430
they're going to vote,
you know,

2098
01:25:42,431 --> 01:25:45,880
their pocket book and you know,
trump was offering the most,

2099
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:46,440
the,
the,

2100
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:49,000
the message that made sense.
They knew America wasn't great.

2101
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:50,530
See,
Hillary Clinton was like,

2102
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:52,210
we don't need to make America great
again.

2103
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:54,280
It's already great.
And the average guys,

2104
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:56,200
it doesn't feel so great to me.
Right.

2105
01:25:56,201 --> 01:25:58,870
My of living is going down.
The only thing going up is my debt.

2106
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:01,480
And so they voted for trump.
But I,

2107
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:04,160
I think this strategy is to blow up.
I don't like

2108
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,560
what trump is doing.
What do you think his strategy is?

2109
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:07,670
Well,
I think he is,

2110
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:10,070
he has now claimed ownership of this
economy.

2111
01:26:10,071 --> 01:26:13,730
He has put the trump brand on this stock
market bubble.

2112
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:17,390
So when the market goes down,
when the economy tanks back into

2113
01:26:17,391 --> 01:26:20,090
recession,
it's not Obama's recession,

2114
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:21,440
it's trump's.
I mean,

2115
01:26:21,441 --> 01:26:24,530
he's basically taken the bait.
I think he's the fall guy.

2116
01:26:24,531 --> 01:26:26,480
I think the Fed,
everybody's going to blame it all on

2117
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:26,900
trump.
Like,

2118
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:29,270
oh look,
he inherited this great economy from

2119
01:26:29,271 --> 01:26:30,530
Obama,
which he didn't.

2120
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:32,300
And now look,
it's a mess.

2121
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:35,660
So he should not be claiming credit,
get for victories.

2122
01:26:35,661 --> 01:26:39,080
He hasn't won.
He should be setting us up for this

2123
01:26:39,081 --> 01:26:41,750
collapse that is already coming.
That is not because of him.

2124
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:45,020
He needs to clean up the mess.
And it's not just Obama's mess,

2125
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:47,660
it's Bush's mess.
Democrats and Republicans worked

2126
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:51,620
together to screw this economy up and
the Federal Reserve was a big part of

2127
01:26:51,621 --> 01:26:52,070
that.

2128
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:52,511
And,
and,

2129
01:26:52,511 --> 01:26:55,220
and trump criticized the fed as a
candidate.

2130
01:26:55,221 --> 01:26:56,330
All of a sudden now,
you know,

2131
01:26:56,331 --> 01:26:57,230
he's just,
he loves the fit.

2132
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:59,960
Wasn't there some sort of improvement in
the stock market because people had

2133
01:26:59,961 --> 01:27:02,500
confidence that he was going to enact
these changes and he was,

2134
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:04,640
well,
this is better for businesses.

2135
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:07,370
Yeah,
I do think that that was able to add

2136
01:27:07,371 --> 01:27:08,420
some air to the bubble,
right?

2137
01:27:08,421 --> 01:27:10,900
I think it was a big bubble.
And then you know,

2138
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,160
when trump won,
all of a sudden people start thinking,

2139
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:13,791
Hey,
wait a minute,

2140
01:27:13,791 --> 01:27:17,270
we're going to get tax cuts.
We're going to get regulatory reform,

2141
01:27:17,271 --> 01:27:21,590
we're going to get more economic growth.
And so the market rallied on that.

2142
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:24,920
But I don't think that that's actually
going to happen.

2143
01:27:24,921 --> 01:27:25,460
I mean,
look,

2144
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:29,110
they didn't repeal obamacare.
That was a big part of the,

2145
01:27:29,111 --> 01:27:30,470
the,
the optimism.

2146
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:35,300
It doesn't look like we're going to get
substantive tax reform the most.

2147
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:38,960
We're going to get our tax cuts,
so we're not going to get a real reform

2148
01:27:38,961 --> 01:27:40,970
that's going to cause a lot more
economic growth.

2149
01:27:40,971 --> 01:27:44,060
We're just going to get bigger deficits.
We're going to lower taxes,

2150
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,160
but we're not going to reduce government
spending.

2151
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:50,240
And the real sad part is no one is
talking about making government smaller.

2152
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,970
Everybody wants to talk about tax cuts.
Okay,

2153
01:27:52,971 --> 01:27:56,630
well taxes to support government.
So if you want lower taxes,

2154
01:27:56,631 --> 01:27:58,670
you need a smaller government.
And I want both,

2155
01:27:58,671 --> 01:28:00,050
right?
I want lower taxes.

2156
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:04,070
But I'm not naive enough to think I can
have big government with lower taxes

2157
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:08,690
because that just means bigger deficits
and deficits are a worst way to pay for

2158
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:11,630
government and taxes.
So if you decide that you want to have

2159
01:28:11,631 --> 01:28:13,940
big government,
then you better have high taxes to pay

2160
01:28:13,941 --> 01:28:15,440
for it.
And you know who's going to bear the

2161
01:28:15,441 --> 01:28:16,040
brunt of that?

2162
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:18,500
The middle class.
So if the middleclass wants big

2163
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:20,270
government,
they want lots of entitlements,

2164
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,710
then they're going to pay through the
nose.

2165
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:23,510
But someone has to be honest and say,
look,

2166
01:28:23,511 --> 01:28:26,480
if you don't want high taxes,
then we got to shrink government.

2167
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:28,670
But they're talking about making
government bigger.

2168
01:28:28,730 --> 01:28:30,380
Look,
trump is talking about let's spend more

2169
01:28:30,381 --> 01:28:32,660
money on infrastructure.
Where's that money gonna come from?

2170
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:35,510
We're going to cut taxes and spend more
money on infrastructure.

2171
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,520
You know,
we're not going to make ourselves rich

2172
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:39,980
by spending money on infrastructure.
Now,

2173
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:45,070
what happened with the Republicans that
voted against obamacare and now vote

2174
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:49,190
against repealing Obama?
Yeah,

2175
01:28:49,191 --> 01:28:50,750
they're the same people.
Like what?

2176
01:28:50,751 --> 01:28:53,100
And what is wrong with trump's ideas?
Well,

2177
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:54,650
for a stroke,
those Republicans,

2178
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,210
again,
are hypocrites.

2179
01:28:56,270 --> 01:29:00,080
They only voted to repeal obamacare
because they knew Obama would veto it,

2180
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:02,220
right?
So it was easy to grandstand.

2181
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,390
Oh yes,
let's repeal it.

2182
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:05,880
And it was a good talking point to get
elected,

2183
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:09,900
but the minute they got elected,
they were too afraid to actually stand

2184
01:29:09,901 --> 01:29:13,050
on that principle because they didn't
want to tell somebody that you can't buy

2185
01:29:13,051 --> 01:29:16,260
insurance when you're sick for the same
prices when you're healthy.

2186
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:18,360
Right.
Nobody wanted to take away that free

2187
01:29:18,361 --> 01:29:20,890
lunch that had been served up by,
by,

2188
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:23,640
by the Democrats.
All the Republicans wanted to do is

2189
01:29:23,641 --> 01:29:26,760
rebrand the free lunch.
They wanted to continue to serve it,

2190
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,140
but take credit for it.
Right.

2191
01:29:28,141 --> 01:29:31,020
They wanted to make it trump care or
ryan care.

2192
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:33,600
Right.
I didn't even like this whole idea.

2193
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:37,890
Let's repeal and replace repeal.
Don't replace with anything.

2194
01:29:37,891 --> 01:29:41,280
Replace it with the free market.
We don't want to get rid of obamacare

2195
01:29:41,281 --> 01:29:43,320
and replace it with something that's
almost the same.

2196
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:45,180
It's what was the idea of replacing it
in the first place?

2197
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:46,640
Because they were,
there is,

2198
01:29:46,641 --> 01:29:49,410
it's all politics.
The benefit was they tried to keep the

2199
01:29:49,411 --> 01:29:52,140
ban on preexisting conditions,
which voters liked,

2200
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,840
but get rid of the taxes and mandates,
which they didn't.

2201
01:29:54,841 --> 01:29:57,900
But the two are intertwined.
You can't have one without the other.

2202
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,800
So that people liked the ban on
preexisting conditions because they want

2203
01:30:00,801 --> 01:30:02,550
to know that they're covered.
If they've,

2204
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:04,110
if they're going in there and they have
cancer,

2205
01:30:04,111 --> 01:30:05,430
they could still get covered.
Right?

2206
01:30:05,431 --> 01:30:07,680
But then no one's going to buy coverage
if they don't need it.

2207
01:30:07,681 --> 01:30:09,270
I mean,
you just cannot use what happens to

2208
01:30:09,271 --> 01:30:12,150
those people that do have cancer and all
these different diseases.

2209
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,060
If we don't have universal socialist
healthcare,

2210
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:18,130
how do we do this to the thing that
happens once they have the,

2211
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:20,940
a lot of them have to buy the insurance
before they get the cancer,

2212
01:30:20,941 --> 01:30:21,760
when they're still healthy.

2213
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:22,290
Right?
I mean,

2214
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:24,540
I don't have cancer right now.
Right.

2215
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:27,630
I may get it next year in two or three
years.

2216
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:29,370
So I have health insurance now.
Right.

2217
01:30:29,410 --> 01:30:31,140
Right.
So if I get cancer,

2218
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:34,310
I know I'm covered that that's you.
You're a successful guy.

2219
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:37,470
But what about someone who's not even in
this bad position?

2220
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,980
Like you don't have to be that
successful to be able to afford in a

2221
01:30:40,981 --> 01:30:42,990
free market to buy herself some
coverage.

2222
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:46,320
The question is what do you do with the
person who made the mistake of not

2223
01:30:46,321 --> 01:30:49,290
buying insurance when they were healthy
and now they get sick?

2224
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:50,940
And of course,
once you're sick,

2225
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:54,840
you can't expect an insurance company to
sell you a policy because the insurance

2226
01:30:54,841 --> 01:30:58,200
company is trying to make money.
They only sell policies to people who

2227
01:30:58,201 --> 01:30:59,850
they don't think we're going to put in
claims.

2228
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:03,000
So you can't go to an insurance company
when you're already sick and say,

2229
01:31:03,001 --> 01:31:04,020
sell me a policy.

2230
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,790
What's in it for the insurance company?
Nothing.

2231
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:07,410
So now you've got to figure out,
well,

2232
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:08,880
how do you take care of that person?
Well,

2233
01:31:08,881 --> 01:31:11,010
first of all,
the best thing is to make sure that

2234
01:31:11,011 --> 01:31:13,530
person buys the insurance policy while
he's still healthy.

2235
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:14,880
So that means you,
you have,

2236
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:18,180
you don't have the ban against
preexisting conditions and you allow

2237
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:22,140
insurance companies to sell inexpensive
insurance that doesn't cover a sex

2238
01:31:22,141 --> 01:31:24,980
change operation or drug abuse.
You know,

2239
01:31:25,090 --> 01:31:27,560
Dario,
he's Transphobic Cape.

2240
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:31,080
If you just want to buy insurance that
covers like cancer,

2241
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:32,520
right?
And you're 20 or 30 years old,

2242
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:34,530
that's cheap.
It's very inexpensive.

2243
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:37,710
It's all this other crap that they want
to mandate that makes it so expensive.

2244
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:42,630
But if you get a search of a situation
where for whatever reason somebody had

2245
01:31:42,631 --> 01:31:45,210
no insurance and they have no money and
now they get cancer,

2246
01:31:45,270 --> 01:31:46,620
well that's what charities are for.

2247
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:48,510
People donate money.
Hospitals,

2248
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:52,650
if doctors didn't have to spend so much
time on paperwork and filling out

2249
01:31:52,651 --> 01:31:55,530
insurance forms,
they would have more time to donate.

2250
01:31:55,531 --> 01:31:56,910
I mean,
years and years ago,

2251
01:31:56,911 --> 01:32:01,330
doctors used to give a lot of their
spare time and of course that was before

2252
01:32:01,331 --> 01:32:02,410
they had the income tax.
You know,

2253
01:32:02,411 --> 01:32:05,620
when the doctors didn't have to pay
income taxes and when the doctors didn't

2254
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:08,950
have to deal with insurance companies,
they had a lot of free time to help a

2255
01:32:08,951 --> 01:32:11,560
lot of poor people for free.
And doctors like doing that.

2256
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:14,440
Doctors get a lot of satisfaction from
helping people.

2257
01:32:14,441 --> 01:32:16,540
That's one of the reason that so many
people become doctors.

2258
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:20,230
It's a very rewarding occupation when
you're a doctor.

2259
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:22,600
Yes,
it is lucrative and you can make money.

2260
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,480
But doctors also enjoy helping people
for free.

2261
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,450
The problem is they can't even afford to
do it now because there's all their time

2262
01:32:28,451 --> 01:32:29,350
is spent doing other stuff.

2263
01:32:29,380 --> 01:32:33,490
They're also saddled down by malpractice
insurance and they also have extreme

2264
01:32:33,491 --> 01:32:35,980
amounts of medical school debt that they
have to handle.

2265
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:38,230
Yet they shouldn't.
It shouldn't be that expensive to go to

2266
01:32:38,231 --> 01:32:39,970
medical school.
And it wouldn't be if it was a free

2267
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:41,050
market.
And yes,

2268
01:32:41,051 --> 01:32:43,870
if we had tort reform,
if you couldn't sue,

2269
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:44,733
look,
it's funny,

2270
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:47,740
you know I'm staying here in a,
at a friend of mine's house,

2271
01:32:47,741 --> 01:32:49,360
he lives in Beverly Hills.
We went to high school together,

2272
01:32:49,361 --> 01:32:50,620
but,
and so he's in real estate.

2273
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:55,120
He owns a lot of property and one of his
tenants is starbucks,

2274
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:56,260
right?
Starbucks restaurant.

2275
01:32:56,261 --> 01:33:01,261
And they just got sued and the person is
suing him as well because he's the

2276
01:33:01,991 --> 01:33:04,330
landlord.
So this is the circumstance and this is,

2277
01:33:04,331 --> 01:33:06,430
this is America.
So a guy,

2278
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:08,950
and he's,
I guess he's hard of hearing.

2279
01:33:08,951 --> 01:33:10,390
He's not totally deaf,
but he has,

2280
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:11,440
he just has a hearing problem.

2281
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:15,670
And so he goes into the starbucks and
the starbucks is playing music right

2282
01:33:15,671 --> 01:33:16,001
there,
you know,

2283
01:33:16,001 --> 01:33:17,740
whatever.
They have background music on and the

2284
01:33:17,741 --> 01:33:19,960
starbucks.
And so he asked the guy behind the

2285
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:20,561
counter,
oh,

2286
01:33:20,561 --> 01:33:22,270
by the way,
I'm hard of hearing.

2287
01:33:22,271 --> 01:33:26,830
Do you have this special device that I
can wear while I'm in here so that while

2288
01:33:26,831 --> 01:33:29,800
I'm in this restaurant,
I can enjoy the same music as everybody

2289
01:33:29,801 --> 01:33:31,540
else.
And the guy said,

2290
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:31,841
well,
no,

2291
01:33:31,841 --> 01:33:33,220
we don't have that device.
Well,

2292
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:35,860
he sued for $10,000 plus attorney's
fees.

2293
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:39,790
And now he's suing my friend too,
because he's the landlord of were where

2294
01:33:39,791 --> 01:33:42,580
the starbucks restaurant is.
But this is America.

2295
01:33:42,581 --> 01:33:44,210
I mean,
you walk,

2296
01:33:44,211 --> 01:33:48,670
that's a hilarious lawsuit.
You walk into a restaurant and you have

2297
01:33:48,671 --> 01:33:50,620
a hearing problem,
get yourself a hearing aid.

2298
01:33:50,621 --> 01:33:53,200
Don't force the guy.
But these are the regulations.

2299
01:33:53,201 --> 01:33:54,190
These are the lawsuits.

2300
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:56,290
The,
the Americans with disabilities act is

2301
01:33:56,291 --> 01:33:58,270
the most ridiculous.
I mean,

2302
01:33:58,330 --> 01:33:59,410
know I remember what I,
you know,

2303
01:33:59,411 --> 01:34:00,970
in California,
this is a true story.

2304
01:34:00,971 --> 01:34:02,440
I'm not making this up.
You can google this.

2305
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:07,150
There was a strip club here in southern
California and I guess their,

2306
01:34:07,151 --> 01:34:10,540
their,
their thing was they had a shower on the

2307
01:34:10,541 --> 01:34:14,740
stage and so the stripper would strip in
the shower so you can watch her,

2308
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:15,574
you know,
with the water.

2309
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:17,320
And it was,
there was a big pole,

2310
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:18,213
right?
So it was,

2311
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:21,730
the shower was up in the air and you had
to climb up the pole to get to the

2312
01:34:21,731 --> 01:34:24,250
shower and then you do your strippers,
you'd strip,

2313
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:26,920
well,
the government made them shut that down.

2314
01:34:27,190 --> 01:34:31,480
And it was because it was discriminatory
against strippers in wheelchairs because

2315
01:34:31,481 --> 01:34:34,630
there was no way for a stripper in a
wheelchair to climb up the pole.

2316
01:34:35,110 --> 01:34:36,850
Now,
I've never even seen a stripper in a

2317
01:34:36,851 --> 01:34:38,330
wheelchair.
Not that I'd spent a lot of time in

2318
01:34:38,331 --> 01:34:39,820
strip clubs,
but,

2319
01:34:39,850 --> 01:34:42,280
but this is,
this is where we are as a society,

2320
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:43,510
right.
There were saying you,

2321
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,150
you know,
if a stripper can't go on that pole,

2322
01:34:46,151 --> 01:34:48,190
then nobody can go on that pole.
Right.

2323
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:50,660
Or if a stripper that's in a wheelchair
can't go on the,

2324
01:34:50,670 --> 01:34:51,370
yes.
Right.

2325
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:52,090
Yeah.
Not,

2326
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:52,581
you know,
but,

2327
01:34:52,581 --> 01:34:54,340
but,
but all these laws and regs,

2328
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:57,140
it's all this.
Everybody is suing everybody because the

2329
01:34:57,141 --> 01:34:58,040
government creates all these

2330
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:59,270
phony rights.
I mean,

2331
01:34:59,271 --> 01:35:04,130
just because I'm hard of hearing doesn't
mean the whole world has to accommodate

2332
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:07,100
the fact that I'm hard to hear it.
I mean sometimes people will say,

2333
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:09,590
look,
let's say I happen to have a size 14

2334
01:35:09,591 --> 01:35:10,490
shoe.
I have,

2335
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:13,490
I have a really big foot.
Does that mean that every shoe store

2336
01:35:13,491 --> 01:35:15,830
has,
has to stock a size 14 just,

2337
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:17,840
no.
I mean cause they know that barely

2338
01:35:17,841 --> 01:35:19,910
anybody is going to have a size 14 so
they don't want,

2339
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,850
but I go to the big and tall store
because I know they're going to have a

2340
01:35:22,851 --> 01:35:26,330
size 14 so you know,
they're going to be certain businesses

2341
01:35:26,331 --> 01:35:29,480
that are going to cater to people with
handicaps.

2342
01:35:29,481 --> 01:35:31,700
Like you know,
you have all these hotels and motels

2343
01:35:31,701 --> 01:35:34,640
that have to shut down their swimming
pools because they can't afford the

2344
01:35:34,641 --> 01:35:38,600
money to have a lift so that somebody in
a wheelchair can go into that swimming

2345
01:35:38,601 --> 01:35:38,810
pool.

2346
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:40,880
Well,
why does every single swimming pool in

2347
01:35:40,881 --> 01:35:43,400
the country have to accommodate somebody
in a wheelchair?

2348
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:47,300
Why can't people who have wheelchairs go
on the Internet and find out which hope,

2349
01:35:47,301 --> 01:35:51,560
which hotels are catering to that
particular clientele and just go there.

2350
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:55,520
But when you force everybody to do it,
they were doing miniature golf courses

2351
01:35:55,521 --> 01:35:58,940
are shutting down because they can't
figure out how to be accessible to

2352
01:35:58,941 --> 01:36:01,280
people in wheelchairs,
even if no one in the wheelchair has

2353
01:36:01,281 --> 01:36:03,890
ever tried to play that course.
And then they end up having to shut it

2354
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:06,080
down because they can't,
you know,

2355
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:07,860
uh,
you know,

2356
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:08,661
the whole,
the whole thing.

2357
01:36:08,661 --> 01:36:11,150
I used to go in,
I used to go to this beach here in,

2358
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:11,911
uh,
in,

2359
01:36:11,911 --> 01:36:13,700
in,
in Malibu and I was younger living here.

2360
01:36:14,090 --> 01:36:16,610
And in order to get to the beach,
you know,

2361
01:36:16,611 --> 01:36:17,990
you had to walk down like a cliff.

2362
01:36:17,990 --> 01:36:19,700
It was like a dog beach,
and I forget the name of it,

2363
01:36:19,701 --> 01:36:21,770
but there was no stairs.
You had to kind of walk down this cliff.

2364
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:25,790
But you know,
in the very front there were like three

2365
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:28,220
or four handicap parking spaces that
were never filled.

2366
01:36:28,221 --> 01:36:31,250
They were always empty and a lot of
people would have to park on pch cause

2367
01:36:31,251 --> 01:36:34,400
the parking lot would get phil.
But nobody would ever use the handicap

2368
01:36:34,401 --> 01:36:37,730
spots because nobody who was handicapped
could possibly get down to that beach

2369
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:39,380
yet they had to have those spots there
anyway.

2370
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:41,360
It had to have those spots,
but they didn't have to have some sort

2371
01:36:41,361 --> 01:36:43,880
of a real access to cause.
It's cause that's nature.

2372
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:46,190
Right?
So it was a beach that no one,

2373
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:48,290
no one who is handicapped could ever go
to.

2374
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:50,750
But yet they had to have all these,
all these spots there.

2375
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:52,880
Like you could take that to Yosemite and
say like,

2376
01:36:52,881 --> 01:36:54,500
Hey,
if you want to climb this mountain,

2377
01:36:54,501 --> 01:36:56,840
you have to have use of your arms.
So we're going to have to figure out

2378
01:36:56,841 --> 01:37:00,690
some sort of a handicapped access up to
the top of this mountain and is

2379
01:37:00,691 --> 01:37:02,930
otherwise it's unfair.
But this is where all the government,

2380
01:37:02,931 --> 01:37:04,550
the government thinks they're being
charitable.

2381
01:37:04,551 --> 01:37:06,530
It look,
do I feel bad that people have

2382
01:37:06,531 --> 01:37:08,000
handicaps,
are poor of course,

2383
01:37:08,001 --> 01:37:11,000
but that the solution is not the
Americans disabilities act.

2384
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:13,340
And you know,
there are a lot of employers now that

2385
01:37:13,341 --> 01:37:16,640
won't hire people with handicaps because
it's now so expensive.

2386
01:37:16,641 --> 01:37:18,410
Whereas they would have done it before.
You know,

2387
01:37:18,411 --> 01:37:20,180
that's the whole thing about,
you know,

2388
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:22,010
these antidiscrimination laws.
Like,

2389
01:37:22,011 --> 01:37:24,230
you know,
you can't discriminate based on gender,

2390
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,880
based on sex,
based on,

2391
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:26,860
uh,
you know,

2392
01:37:26,860 --> 01:37:27,920
uh,
you know,

2393
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:29,630
uh,
sexual identity and all these different

2394
01:37:29,631 --> 01:37:30,291
things.
Well,

2395
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:32,780
because of that,
there's actually more discrimination.

2396
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:34,550
You know,
there are actually employers now who

2397
01:37:34,551 --> 01:37:37,700
aren't racist at all,
but who will go out of their way not to

2398
01:37:37,701 --> 01:37:40,100
hire minorities because they're afraid
of getting sued,

2399
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:40,821
right?
Oh,

2400
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:45,821
if I hire a,
a black eye or if I hire a Hispanic or

2401
01:37:45,831 --> 01:37:48,800
if I hire a homosexual,
what if I fire that person because

2402
01:37:48,801 --> 01:37:50,900
they're not doing a good job?
They could sue me.

2403
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:51,561
They could say,
well,

2404
01:37:51,561 --> 01:37:55,130
you fired me because I'm gay.
Doesn't mean about women in tech.

2405
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:56,100
I heard this argument

2406
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:59,760
recently because I was reading some
article written by Ellen Pao.

2407
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:01,290
She was that woman who,
uh,

2408
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:04,290
had that big lawsuit,
sexual discrimination lawsuit.

2409
01:38:05,090 --> 01:38:08,700
She said some article about women in
tech and someone was saying,

2410
01:38:08,701 --> 01:38:09,900
well,
see this,

2411
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:13,170
this is the reason why people don't want
to hire women in the first place.

2412
01:38:13,171 --> 01:38:16,320
But it isn't that sort of a slippery
slope because if she really was being

2413
01:38:16,321 --> 01:38:18,300
sexually discriminated against,
well,

2414
01:38:18,301 --> 01:38:20,520
they shouldn't really be able to do that
in the first place.

2415
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:25,320
If he's saying is true that they create
this hostile work environment for women,

2416
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:29,040
they shouldn't be able to necessarily
just never hire women,

2417
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:31,410
just so they can remind here.
Hostile.

2418
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:32,550
Right.
Does that make sense?

2419
01:38:32,770 --> 01:38:34,860
Remember if you have a business,
right,

2420
01:38:34,861 --> 01:38:36,690
right.
Because they always sue the business.

2421
01:38:36,691 --> 01:38:38,970
They don't.
So let's say one of my male employees

2422
01:38:39,070 --> 01:38:40,710
harass us,
one of my female employee,

2423
01:38:40,711 --> 01:38:43,950
they don't say that one guy,
the owner.

2424
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,490
Right?
So this is how it works against him.

2425
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:49,020
So more profitable because the owner has
all the money,

2426
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:49,700
right?
Right.

2427
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:50,320
You know,
so,

2428
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:54,060
so here's what happened.
So I am an owner of a business and now

2429
01:38:54,061 --> 01:38:58,830
some woman walks in and let's say she is
particularly attractive.

2430
01:38:58,831 --> 01:39:00,030
And I start thinking,
okay,

2431
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:04,170
do I really want to have this potential
lawsuit walking around my office?

2432
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:06,270
Do I really want,
because maybe she really does get

2433
01:39:06,271 --> 01:39:08,550
harassed,
but I'm the one that's liable for that

2434
01:39:08,551 --> 01:39:09,460
harassment.
Right?

2435
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:12,330
And I can have all the policies I want,
but you know,

2436
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:13,860
guys are horny.
I mean,

2437
01:39:13,861 --> 01:39:16,110
we know what we're like and you know,
you,

2438
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:17,820
you dangled lump me in there,
sir.

2439
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:19,420
All right.
Well dairy,

2440
01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:23,340
but I mean 10 pete employers don't want
lawsuits.

2441
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,320
Right?
And,

2442
01:39:24,321 --> 01:39:28,380
and so the easier you make it to sue,
the less likely you're going to get a

2443
01:39:28,381 --> 01:39:30,290
job.
So if employers are looking at,

2444
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:32,790
I want to hire the person who's least
likely to sue me,

2445
01:39:32,830 --> 01:39:35,130
but isn't it conversely,
the harder you make it to sue,

2446
01:39:35,131 --> 01:39:37,000
the more likely people are going to get
harassed?

2447
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,433
No.
I mean,

2448
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,530
if,
if somebody has harassed and sue the

2449
01:39:41,531 --> 01:39:44,110
person that harassed you,
don't sue the person who happened to

2450
01:39:44,111 --> 01:39:46,120
employ him.
That might've had nothing to do with it.

2451
01:39:46,121 --> 01:39:47,380
Right?
So don't sue you,

2452
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:50,570
the individual that causes whatever the
issue is.

2453
01:39:50,710 --> 01:39:51,161
Yeah.
I mean,

2454
01:39:51,161 --> 01:39:52,330
it's gotta be a pro.
It can't,

2455
01:39:52,331 --> 01:39:54,820
you can't just say the employer and,
but again,

2456
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:56,980
when you talk about something like
discrimination,

2457
01:39:56,981 --> 01:39:58,180
like see I'm Jewish,
right?

2458
01:39:58,210 --> 01:40:01,120
So maybe it's easier if I just talk
about Jews versus something else.

2459
01:40:01,121 --> 01:40:03,940
But,
so let's say somebody doesn't want to

2460
01:40:03,970 --> 01:40:07,720
hire me because I'm Jewish.
I support their decision.

2461
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:10,240
They have a right not to like me and no
one,

2462
01:40:10,270 --> 01:40:13,630
no one has to like Jews.
And I know not everybody does.

2463
01:40:13,631 --> 01:40:17,680
And if somebody is an anti-semite,
that's their right to be that,

2464
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:19,570
you know,
if they want to fire me because I'm

2465
01:40:19,571 --> 01:40:20,590
Jewish,
they can do that.

2466
01:40:20,591 --> 01:40:21,850
They don't want to hire me.
You know,

2467
01:40:21,851 --> 01:40:24,910
if somebody wants to have a restaurant
and they want to put a sign that says no

2468
01:40:24,911 --> 01:40:27,070
juice,
that's there right now.

2469
01:40:27,071 --> 01:40:28,600
I think anybody that eats there,
I,

2470
01:40:28,601 --> 01:40:31,120
you know,
I think they got a problem because look,

2471
01:40:31,121 --> 01:40:32,620
look,
I'm not black.

2472
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:35,410
If there was a restaurant that had a
sign that said no blacks,

2473
01:40:35,411 --> 01:40:38,160
there's no way I would eat there.
Just out of principle of effects.

2474
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:41,200
I think if there's somebody that doesn't
like Jews,

2475
01:40:41,410 --> 01:40:44,020
the last thing they're going to do is
put that sign out there because you know

2476
01:40:44,021 --> 01:40:45,520
what?
They want me to eat there.

2477
01:40:45,521 --> 01:40:47,500
Even though they don't like me.
They want my money.

2478
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:50,620
And they also don't want the blow back
and they don't want the bad public.

2479
01:40:50,621 --> 01:40:52,450
Can you imagine like people keep people
say like,

2480
01:40:52,451 --> 01:40:52,871
well,
you know,

2481
01:40:52,871 --> 01:40:54,700
if,
if we don't have all these

2482
01:40:54,701 --> 01:40:57,730
antidiscrimination laws,
then restaurants aren't going to serve

2483
01:40:57,820 --> 01:40:59,650
blacks.
You name me one.

2484
01:40:59,651 --> 01:41:01,870
Rhett,
you find one restaurant in this country

2485
01:41:01,871 --> 01:41:05,050
with the Internet that put out a sign.
No blacks allowed.

2486
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:06,790
I mean,
that'd be the end of that restaurant.

2487
01:41:06,850 --> 01:41:08,080
Well,
a lot of these laws were sort of

2488
01:41:08,081 --> 01:41:10,790
established before the Internet was the
powerful force centers today.

2489
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:11,261
Right,
right.

2490
01:41:11,261 --> 01:41:14,290
But we can now see all a lot of the harm
that these,

2491
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:16,360
these laws have done.
Because you go back,

2492
01:41:16,510 --> 01:41:21,100
you go back before all these
antidiscrimination laws up,

2493
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:24,640
black teenage unemployment,
let's say in the 30s was lower than

2494
01:41:24,641 --> 01:41:26,770
white teenage unemployment lower.
Now,

2495
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:29,980
do you think we have,
we're more racist today than we were

2496
01:41:29,981 --> 01:41:30,731
back then.
No,

2497
01:41:30,731 --> 01:41:34,090
we're not more racist or less racist,
but it's all these laws that have

2498
01:41:34,091 --> 01:41:34,990
backfired.
All these,

2499
01:41:34,991 --> 01:41:35,890
you know,
uh,

2500
01:41:35,891 --> 01:41:37,930
you know,
antidiscrimination laws and you know,

2501
01:41:37,931 --> 01:41:39,850
you have this whole industry like
recently,

2502
01:41:39,851 --> 01:41:40,541
right?
You know,

2503
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:44,260
you have this big movement because we
had the riots in Charlottesville because

2504
01:41:44,261 --> 01:41:46,150
you know,
they want to take down these statues,

2505
01:41:46,151 --> 01:41:50,230
these confederate statues as if those
confederate statues are the reason that

2506
01:41:50,231 --> 01:41:54,030
we have poverty and unemployment and
crime in African American communities.

2507
01:41:54,031 --> 01:41:56,410
These statues have nothing to do with
that and taking them down.

2508
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:59,230
Is it going to change anything?
But you've got these people in America

2509
01:41:59,231 --> 01:42:04,000
that make a living off of poverty and
off of race baiting that want to say,

2510
01:42:04,030 --> 01:42:05,530
oh,
the reason that you're poor,

2511
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:09,580
the reason that there's crime is because
of racism and the racism is because of

2512
01:42:09,581 --> 01:42:11,230
these statutes.
So vote for me,

2513
01:42:11,231 --> 01:42:15,700
give me money and I will help you write.
You're a victim and I am your solution.

2514
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:16,480
And,
and they,

2515
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:18,130
they act well,
we'll just get rid of the statute

2516
01:42:18,131 --> 01:42:19,720
because even if they get rid of the
statues,

2517
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:21,610
nothing's going to change.
Now they have to get rid of something

2518
01:42:21,611 --> 01:42:22,440
else.

2519
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:26,250
I think that the statute to her for a
lot of people represents racism.

2520
01:42:26,251 --> 01:42:29,250
Like if you see a Robert E.
Lee statue and then you read about what

2521
01:42:29,251 --> 01:42:32,070
Robert E.
Lee did to his own personal slaves and

2522
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:35,080
oversaw some of the lashings and you
know,

2523
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:38,460
in caught slaves that were trying to
escape as a horrible account.

2524
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:42,390
I retweeted recently of some slave that
was,

2525
01:42:42,391 --> 01:42:44,280
uh,
caught while I was trying to escape.

2526
01:42:44,350 --> 01:42:45,000
Robert E.
Lee,

2527
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,330
Robert E.
Lee oversaw that beating him and lashing

2528
01:42:48,331 --> 01:42:48,800
him.

2529
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:49,281
Yeah,
I mean,

2530
01:42:49,281 --> 01:42:51,600
I don't know.
I mean all of the various stories of,

2531
01:42:51,610 --> 01:42:54,200
I know that Robert E.
Lee was a very well respected guy,

2532
01:42:54,230 --> 01:42:55,970
even in the north.
I mean he was very,

2533
01:42:56,030 --> 01:42:58,820
in fact,
Lincoln wanted him to run the union

2534
01:42:58,821 --> 01:43:00,350
army.
I mean he turned it down because he

2535
01:43:00,351 --> 01:43:02,300
couldn't because he was a good killer.
No,

2536
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,460
well respected.
Well,

2537
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:07,460
it was a good general,
he was a war hero in these American

2538
01:43:07,461 --> 01:43:08,810
Mexicans.
Also a slave owner.

2539
01:43:08,990 --> 01:43:10,010
Well,
so a lot of people,

2540
01:43:10,011 --> 01:43:12,290
so it was Thomas Jefferson,
so it was George Washington.

2541
01:43:12,291 --> 01:43:13,610
I mean,
a lot of people go for Neri though,

2542
01:43:13,611 --> 01:43:14,600
right?
Of course.

2543
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:17,000
Look,
if Thomas Jefferson were alive today,

2544
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:18,950
he would not own slaves,
obviously.

2545
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:23,030
Right?
But if you or I were born in the

2546
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:27,830
Annabella south,
if I was born in Virginia in 1750 would

2547
01:43:27,831 --> 01:43:29,900
I feel differently about slavery that I
do today?

2548
01:43:29,901 --> 01:43:32,690
There's a good chance that I would,
I mean it was the culture slavery had

2549
01:43:32,691 --> 01:43:35,300
been going on for thousands of years.
It's not like we invented it,

2550
01:43:35,330 --> 01:43:36,080
so it was horrific.

2551
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,460
Good is that is to say,
I think you're being very honest.

2552
01:43:38,461 --> 01:43:40,760
I think you're being very pragmatic
about the,

2553
01:43:41,890 --> 01:43:45,940
my point is that most people that even
see a statue of Robert E.

2554
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:47,800
Lee don't even know who Robert E.
Lee was.

2555
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:50,200
The average American doesn't even know
who fought in the civil war,

2556
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:51,500
let alone who want it.
I mean,

2557
01:43:51,501 --> 01:43:52,250
thanks to American

2558
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:54,320
schools,
I don't think those statues,

2559
01:43:55,220 --> 01:43:57,530
those statues have been there for
looked.

2560
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,930
Martin Luther King never cared about
those statues.

2561
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:02,150
He didn't march down and said,
we've got to get rid of the statutes.

2562
01:44:02,151 --> 01:44:04,100
Do you know in a lot of those statues
are actually put up.

2563
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:05,660
They have,
a lot of them were put up during the

2564
01:44:05,661 --> 01:44:08,600
civil rights era.
They were put up because people were

2565
01:44:08,601 --> 01:44:11,690
fighting against all the racists and so
pete,

2566
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:14,360
it was a reaction.
Walls were put up.

2567
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:14,870
They,
they,

2568
01:44:14,870 --> 01:44:19,870
a lot of them were put up in a
90019101920 I mean the southsea spike,

2569
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:24,980
there's actually a spike in these civil
war monuments going up and they're

2570
01:44:24,981 --> 01:44:27,230
actually fairly cheap,
cheaply made,

2571
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:29,540
you know,
bronze statues that were cheaper to

2572
01:44:29,541 --> 01:44:33,770
produce that were made during the civil
rights era and direct protest to the

2573
01:44:33,771 --> 01:44:34,790
civil rights era.
Yeah.

2574
01:44:34,890 --> 01:44:38,680
They made up these statues of guys that
grows when they forget to represented

2575
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:39,110
slavery.

2576
01:44:39,110 --> 01:44:42,530
The people who were leading the anti
civil rights movement were all the

2577
01:44:42,531 --> 01:44:43,400
Democrats.
Right.

2578
01:44:43,401 --> 01:44:45,410
Even though lb a long time ago.
Right,

2579
01:44:45,430 --> 01:44:45,681
right.
Well,

2580
01:44:45,681 --> 01:44:47,090
this is dirt.
This is when they passed it.

2581
01:44:47,091 --> 01:44:48,980
When they,
when they pass the civil rights act,

2582
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:52,250
1964 it was only because of Republicans
that had passed.

2583
01:44:52,251 --> 01:44:55,670
If the Republicans had voted for it in
the same proportion and Democrats,

2584
01:44:55,671 --> 01:44:59,150
it would have been defeated.
But that the part of the Civil Rights

2585
01:44:59,150 --> 01:45:00,290
Act that I was against,
right.

2586
01:45:00,291 --> 01:45:02,040
And I obviously I was a little kid then,
so I was,

2587
01:45:02,041 --> 01:45:04,430
I was,
I was born in 1963 so I'm just looking

2588
01:45:04,431 --> 01:45:05,264
back at it,
right?

2589
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:10,070
That all of the,
the antidiscrimination laws that had to

2590
01:45:10,071 --> 01:45:11,840
do with government and the state
governments,

2591
01:45:11,841 --> 01:45:15,200
because you had a lot of
institutionalized racism down South by

2592
01:45:15,201 --> 01:45:16,190
Democrats,
right.

2593
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:19,430
And all that was bad.
And the fact that we eradicated was

2594
01:45:19,431 --> 01:45:19,910
good.

2595
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:24,440
The part that was bad is the part that
went into the private realm and said,

2596
01:45:24,441 --> 01:45:28,820
if you are a private person,
you can't discriminate because now all

2597
01:45:28,821 --> 01:45:30,530
of a sudden the government is the
thought police.

2598
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:31,880
Now all of a sudden,
you know,

2599
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,370
every,
every decision that everybody makes is

2600
01:45:34,371 --> 01:45:37,010
being second guessed.
You've opened up everybody to all sorts

2601
01:45:37,011 --> 01:45:40,340
of lawsuits and you've gotten blow back
where,

2602
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:43,070
you know,
businesses are afraid to hire people not

2603
01:45:43,071 --> 01:45:45,260
because they're racist or bigot,
but because they don't,

2604
01:45:45,261 --> 01:45:48,770
they fear a lawsuit.
And so now you've increased the cost of

2605
01:45:48,771 --> 01:45:50,390
employing,
uh,

2606
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:52,930
people that are in these,
in these specialized groups.

2607
01:45:52,931 --> 01:45:55,850
So I think that that was a bad thing.
And also I think legally,

2608
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,450
I don't think the government
constitutionally has the right to tell

2609
01:45:59,451 --> 01:45:59,841
me.
I mean,

2610
01:45:59,841 --> 01:46:02,660
everybody knows,
like if somebody tried to tell me as a,

2611
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:04,580
in my private life,
you know,

2612
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:05,510
you need,
you know,

2613
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:08,210
you need to be an equal opportunity
dater,

2614
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:08,450
right?

2615
01:46:08,450 --> 01:46:09,760
All the women that you,
you,

2616
01:46:09,770 --> 01:46:10,151
you,
you know,

2617
01:46:10,151 --> 01:46:12,840
you can't just date white women or
seeing this argument.

2618
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:13,980
I mean,
and,

2619
01:46:13,990 --> 01:46:14,823
and also,
you know,

2620
01:46:15,590 --> 01:46:17,030
even as an employee,
right?

2621
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:18,860
If I,
let's say I'm Jewish,

2622
01:46:19,190 --> 01:46:20,540
if I say,
Hey,

2623
01:46:20,541 --> 01:46:24,110
I want to work for another Jew.
I just like working for Jews and I go

2624
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:26,260
and I apply for jobs and,
and I,

2625
01:46:26,261 --> 01:46:26,901
and I see,
you know,

2626
01:46:26,901 --> 01:46:28,340
I don't want to work for you.
You're not Jewish.

2627
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:28,880
Oh,
you know,

2628
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,900
so I can discriminate as a worker among,
and I can quit.

2629
01:46:32,901 --> 01:46:34,940
I can go to my employer and say,
you know what?

2630
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:37,760
I'm tired of working for a Jew.
I quit.

2631
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:39,020
Right?
That's legal.

2632
01:46:39,021 --> 01:46:42,320
You can't sue me for discriminating
against you and going to work for my

2633
01:46:42,321 --> 01:46:45,650
competitor.
So look employers or are you don't lose

2634
01:46:45,651 --> 01:46:47,390
your rights because you create a
business.

2635
01:46:47,391 --> 01:46:49,170
You don't lose your rights.
I'm sorry,

2636
01:46:49,171 --> 01:46:50,010
let me interrupt you here,

2637
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,290
but don't you think there's a big
difference between someone who makes a

2638
01:46:52,291 --> 01:46:56,250
personal decision of where they want to
work versus someone who has power over

2639
01:46:56,251 --> 01:46:58,410
you?
There's a big difference that she'd

2640
01:46:58,411 --> 01:47:01,200
someone who chooses like I don't like
working for this guy because a,

2641
01:47:01,201 --> 01:47:04,650
I only like working for white people and
you can decide to do that because it's

2642
01:47:04,651 --> 01:47:06,780
your own personal choice to where to go
that you're not,

2643
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:08,580
you're not holding any power over
someone.

2644
01:47:08,850 --> 01:47:12,150
These laws are created.
They're antidiscrimination laws because

2645
01:47:12,151 --> 01:47:15,600
you're discriminating against other
people and you can keep other people

2646
01:47:15,601 --> 01:47:16,590
from making a living.

2647
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:18,790
Well,
employment is all about discrimination,

2648
01:47:18,791 --> 01:47:20,350
right?
I'm trying to find the best person for

2649
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:22,930
the job.
I can discriminate based on all sorts of

2650
01:47:22,931 --> 01:47:23,350
factors,

2651
01:47:23,350 --> 01:47:25,210
right?
That's a one way to look at it.

2652
01:47:25,230 --> 01:47:26,230
Right?
Discrimination,

2653
01:47:26,231 --> 01:47:27,970
but you're being discerning more than a,

2654
01:47:28,050 --> 01:47:29,270
right.
What you're saying,

2655
01:47:29,570 --> 01:47:31,370
look,
you're going to discriminate based on

2656
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:34,700
competence based on their background.
Basically discrimination,

2657
01:47:35,540 --> 01:47:39,620
discrimination of the word though it's
still discriminating just means you're,

2658
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:40,850
you know,
you're kind of picky,

2659
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:41,181
right,
right,

2660
01:47:41,181 --> 01:47:42,800
right.
You're talking about discriminating

2661
01:47:42,801 --> 01:47:47,760
based on a factor.
Like you're being racist or sexist or

2662
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:52,580
homophobic being,
being discriminating and racism are,

2663
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:53,970
are different things.
Right?

2664
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:57,050
Cause you,
you can discriminate based on race and

2665
01:47:57,051 --> 01:47:59,930
not be a racist.
Like let's say somebody decides,

2666
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:00,901
okay,
I,

2667
01:48:00,901 --> 01:48:02,600
I can,
I can hire two candidates.

2668
01:48:02,601 --> 01:48:05,000
One is white and one is black.
And if they say,

2669
01:48:05,001 --> 01:48:06,800
well,
if I hire the white candidate,

2670
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:09,920
uh,
I'm less likely to get sued if I have to

2671
01:48:09,921 --> 01:48:12,200
terminate him because he's not doing a
good job because he can't,

2672
01:48:12,410 --> 01:48:15,620
he can't claim.
So if I make that decision based on

2673
01:48:15,621 --> 01:48:17,030
race,
it's not because I'm a racist.

2674
01:48:17,030 --> 01:48:19,340
I'm trying to practically look at the
numbers.

2675
01:48:19,341 --> 01:48:22,040
I'm not necessarily would disagree.
They would say that is a racist

2676
01:48:22,041 --> 01:48:23,930
decision.
Like you're assuming that black people

2677
01:48:23,931 --> 01:48:26,530
would be more likely to sue you?
Well they have that statistically,

2678
01:48:26,531 --> 01:48:27,740
no,
because you can't,

2679
01:48:27,810 --> 01:48:30,260
you can't.
If I fire somebody who's white,

2680
01:48:30,530 --> 01:48:33,530
they can't say you fired me because I'm
white.

2681
01:48:33,710 --> 01:48:35,270
It's just never at,
you can't do that.

2682
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:39,170
So obviously there are plenty of
lawsuits for wrongful termination.

2683
01:48:39,171 --> 01:48:41,810
I've had them myself where somebody
says,

2684
01:48:42,050 --> 01:48:46,600
you sued me because I'm black.
Nobody is going to say you fuck you fire

2685
01:48:46,601 --> 01:48:47,391
me.
So it is,

2686
01:48:47,391 --> 01:48:49,730
it is a,
a statistic,

2687
01:48:49,790 --> 01:48:53,240
a statistic that somebody can consider,
but it doesn't mean that they're an

2688
01:48:53,241 --> 01:48:53,870
actual

2689
01:48:53,870 --> 01:48:58,220
fantastic or more black people or black
people or rather more likely to fire for

2690
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:00,920
sue for wrongful termination.

2691
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:06,020
Black person is more likely to sue for a
racially based determination.

2692
01:49:06,811 --> 01:49:08,400
Then somebody who's white,
you know,

2693
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:13,200
a women as a woman is more likely to sue
because she was discriminated based on

2694
01:49:13,201 --> 01:49:15,000
her sex.
A man is not likely to say,

2695
01:49:15,001 --> 01:49:18,180
you fired me because I'm a man,
but you're going to get someone saying

2696
01:49:18,181 --> 01:49:20,570
you fired me because I'm a woman because
they're a member of the,

2697
01:49:20,630 --> 01:49:21,960
you know,
of a protected class.

2698
01:49:21,961 --> 01:49:24,600
But if somebody makes a decision,
that doesn't mean that you're,

2699
01:49:24,690 --> 01:49:25,720
that you're,
you know,

2700
01:49:25,830 --> 01:49:28,350
anti women.
If you're trying to make a rational

2701
01:49:28,351 --> 01:49:31,710
decision,
the racism is just believing that one

2702
01:49:31,711 --> 01:49:35,590
race is inferior.
Just not liking somebody because cost

2703
01:49:35,591 --> 01:49:37,170
our member of particular,
that's totally different.

2704
01:49:37,890 --> 01:49:41,610
Racial discrimination should be legal.
If you're thinking about the future of

2705
01:49:41,611 --> 01:49:42,870
your business and just hedging,

2706
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:43,371
well,
you know what?

2707
01:49:43,371 --> 01:49:44,000
No,
I don't care.

2708
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,860
I think it should be legal no matter
what.

2709
01:49:45,890 --> 01:49:48,040
I don't want to,
Elac I think have a right

2710
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:50,410
to be assholes.
Yes.

2711
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:51,400
And,
but the thing is though,

2712
01:49:51,490 --> 01:49:55,240
if you're a businessman and you're,
and you're making your hiring decisions

2713
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:58,480
based on the color of people's skin or
their gender,

2714
01:49:58,810 --> 01:50:02,650
and my competitors are making decisions
based on competence,

2715
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:04,540
you're not going to survive.
I mean,

2716
01:50:04,541 --> 01:50:08,860
if you are going to turn down a better
quality female worker and you're going

2717
01:50:08,861 --> 01:50:11,230
to settle for somebody who can't do the
job as well,

2718
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:13,690
because you want to hire a man that you
know,

2719
01:50:13,691 --> 01:50:15,340
you're not going to be a successful
businessman.

2720
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:18,670
So I have my faith in the free market.
That racism,

2721
01:50:18,671 --> 01:50:19,840
there is a cost,
right?

2722
01:50:19,841 --> 01:50:24,220
When when you're a racist and you want
to be a racist and business that costs

2723
01:50:24,221 --> 01:50:26,080
you a lot of money.
And I think,

2724
01:50:26,081 --> 01:50:27,310
you know,
but what happens is,

2725
01:50:27,311 --> 01:50:29,080
you know,
the government tries to take the cost

2726
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:30,220
away from racism.

2727
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:30,761
You know,
they,

2728
01:50:30,761 --> 01:50:31,171
they,
they,

2729
01:50:31,171 --> 01:50:33,910
they tried it.
They tried to substitute laws and

2730
01:50:33,911 --> 01:50:34,930
regulations.
I,

2731
01:50:34,931 --> 01:50:37,150
I'd rather have the market punish the
racist.

2732
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:39,540
Right.
Let the market punish somebody who is

2733
01:50:39,541 --> 01:50:43,150
hiring people that are not competent for
the job,

2734
01:50:43,151 --> 01:50:45,460
but he's hiring them for some ridiculous
reason.

2735
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:47,260
Well,
conversely,

2736
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:49,000
what did you think about the Google
memo?

2737
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:51,370
Because one of the,
one of the things about that memo was

2738
01:50:51,371 --> 01:50:52,870
the,
the gentleman that was fired,

2739
01:50:52,871 --> 01:50:55,220
what does his name,
James Damore.

2740
01:50:55,410 --> 01:50:56,243
Yeah,
that's his name.

2741
01:50:56,350 --> 01:51:00,670
He was saying that Google was hiring
people based on whether or not they are

2742
01:51:00,671 --> 01:51:03,970
minorities and women regardless of their
competence.

2743
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:07,270
Yeah.
I mean we're discriminating on like

2744
01:51:07,271 --> 01:51:12,070
discriminating against straight white
males to pursue people that would give

2745
01:51:12,071 --> 01:51:13,630
them the appearance of diversity.
Well,

2746
01:51:13,631 --> 01:51:14,560
they're doing that.
Well,

2747
01:51:14,561 --> 01:51:15,041
they're,
I mean,

2748
01:51:15,041 --> 01:51:19,150
they're trying to be more diverse and,
and mainly the diversity that they're

2749
01:51:19,151 --> 01:51:22,600
going for is they mop,
they want to hire more women and also

2750
01:51:22,601 --> 01:51:23,230
more minority.

2751
01:51:23,230 --> 01:51:24,130
So that,
that too,

2752
01:51:24,131 --> 01:51:27,520
but I think his argument or his paper
was more focused on the gender,

2753
01:51:27,521 --> 01:51:31,990
but what he was trying to do is point
out that fact that fewer women are just

2754
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:33,250
in programming.
I mean,

2755
01:51:33,251 --> 01:51:35,410
they're not,
they're not interested in that pursuit

2756
01:51:35,411 --> 01:51:36,700
as much as men are.
And so,

2757
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:37,291
you know,
when,

2758
01:51:37,291 --> 01:51:38,620
when you're,
when you're hiring,

2759
01:51:38,621 --> 01:51:40,450
right?
When Google is hiring and they're trying

2760
01:51:40,451 --> 01:51:42,280
to get the very best,
you know,

2761
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:45,580
there's a much bigger pool of male
applicants for those jobs.

2762
01:51:45,581 --> 01:51:46,900
I mean,
it's much more competitive.

2763
01:51:46,901 --> 01:51:48,700
And so he's making the point that,
look,

2764
01:51:48,701 --> 01:51:52,390
you're just not going to get a lot of
women in these jobs.

2765
01:51:52,391 --> 01:51:55,690
And if you're going to just try to have
more diversity,

2766
01:51:55,691 --> 01:51:57,400
you're just going to sacrifice the
quality.

2767
01:51:57,401 --> 01:51:58,960
And you know,
I'm sure that he's right.

2768
01:51:58,961 --> 01:52:01,780
But the interesting thing is he gets
fired for expressing that opinion.

2769
01:52:01,810 --> 01:52:04,360
And what's ironic is he suing?
Well now look,

2770
01:52:04,361 --> 01:52:08,200
I mean look personally see personally I
think that Google should be able to,

2771
01:52:08,201 --> 01:52:10,540
it's their company.
I think that if they want to fire

2772
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:12,010
somebody,
they should be able to do that.

2773
01:52:12,011 --> 01:52:14,530
Now if he had a contract,
so I don't know what kind of employment

2774
01:52:14,531 --> 01:52:16,630
contract,
if he's an at will employee,

2775
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:19,060
you know,
I think they should be able to terminate

2776
01:52:19,061 --> 01:52:21,100
them for whatever reason.
Just like I think he should be able to

2777
01:52:21,101 --> 01:52:23,410
quit.
Well they were saying he was reinforcing

2778
01:52:23,411 --> 01:52:26,920
negative gender stereotypes.
That was the main reason they publicly

2779
01:52:26,921 --> 01:52:29,350
stated that he was being fired.
I think it,

2780
01:52:29,351 --> 01:52:32,140
look,
it shows you how you know how low that

2781
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:36,160
we fallen as a society that you know
you're allowed to express your opinion

2782
01:52:36,161 --> 01:52:40,290
as long as it's the politically correct
opinion and Google is afraid of the blow

2783
01:52:40,291 --> 01:52:42,550
back.
And I could still look if they think

2784
01:52:42,551 --> 01:52:46,220
it's going to hurt their profits if they
think the way to make in America today

2785
01:52:46,370 --> 01:52:50,000
is to bow down on the altar of political
correctness and just pretend that things

2786
01:52:50,001 --> 01:52:52,790
that you know are true or not true.
Uh,

2787
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:55,730
but you know,
my principals are consistent,

2788
01:52:55,731 --> 01:52:59,090
but I do think that they violate,
they probably violated California labor

2789
01:52:59,091 --> 01:53:00,910
law in the way they fired him.
Uh,

2790
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:02,780
I don't like California labor law.
I mean,

2791
01:53:02,781 --> 01:53:05,120
I'm an employer here in California and I
don't like it.

2792
01:53:05,121 --> 01:53:08,300
And I would probably employ a lot more
people here if they didn't have the

2793
01:53:08,301 --> 01:53:09,980
labor law that they do.
Uh,

2794
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:12,530
but I'm consistent in my view.
So,

2795
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:13,860
but I,
it,

2796
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:17,750
I think it's terrible that they had to
fire him because if he had expressed the

2797
01:53:17,751 --> 01:53:20,240
exact opposite position,
it wouldn't have been a problem.

2798
01:53:20,470 --> 01:53:23,420
Right.
It's just because he is basically saying

2799
01:53:23,421 --> 01:53:24,260
the truth.
I mean,

2800
01:53:24,261 --> 01:53:27,620
look,
why is it that you have to pretend that

2801
01:53:27,680 --> 01:53:32,510
men and women are exactly the same in
all aspects of life?

2802
01:53:32,510 --> 01:53:37,250
That there's no difference in our
evolutionary biology that men and women

2803
01:53:37,251 --> 01:53:40,970
didn't necessarily evolve in different
ways based on the roles that they

2804
01:53:40,971 --> 01:53:41,990
played,
you know,

2805
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:44,960
thousands of years ago or tens of
thousands of years ago.

2806
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:46,100
And that there's,
you know,

2807
01:53:46,430 --> 01:53:50,390
there's something about maleness and
again it's not like obviously there are

2808
01:53:50,391 --> 01:53:51,710
exceptions to the rule,
right?

2809
01:53:51,711 --> 01:53:55,040
But in general the average man is going
to be,

2810
01:53:55,041 --> 01:53:56,260
you know,
there's going to be certain way,

2811
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:59,510
think ways that the average man is going
to be different than the average women.

2812
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:02,660
And if,
and maybe men just for whatever reason

2813
01:54:03,050 --> 01:54:05,240
go are going into program in computer
science,

2814
01:54:05,241 --> 01:54:07,460
in greater numbers and women.
I mean that's just going to happen.

2815
01:54:07,461 --> 01:54:09,740
That's just nature.
You can't try to pretend that doesn't

2816
01:54:09,741 --> 01:54:11,900
exist or a bad thing.

2817
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:13,770
Mary Psychology,
I mean this is,

2818
01:54:13,810 --> 01:54:17,840
this is something that's been studied
because looking at human beings and the

2819
01:54:17,841 --> 01:54:21,050
choices they make based on their gender,
based on their environment,

2820
01:54:21,051 --> 01:54:25,820
based on there's a host of different
factors to deny that it does seem.

2821
01:54:26,120 --> 01:54:26,620
Yeah.

2822
01:54:26,620 --> 01:54:27,401
And,
and again,

2823
01:54:27,401 --> 01:54:30,700
no one's talking about,
obviously there are going to be examples

2824
01:54:30,850 --> 01:54:33,130
that don't fit that,
that of course,

2825
01:54:33,940 --> 01:54:36,990
but there's always outliers.
But when we're looking at numbers in a,

2826
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:39,830
in a job,
you're looking at the totality,

2827
01:54:39,831 --> 01:54:40,520
the,
you know,

2828
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:43,300
and so if there's only 10%,
uh,

2829
01:54:43,301 --> 01:54:45,730
women to say,
well we need to make it 50,

2830
01:54:45,731 --> 01:54:48,490
50 because half the world is women is
the,

2831
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:51,150
that's like if the UFC said,
listen,

2832
01:54:51,151 --> 01:54:54,810
we need more women fighters so we're
going to fire some of the men that are

2833
01:54:54,811 --> 01:54:58,710
way better fighters and we're going to
hire more women fighters to make a more

2834
01:54:58,711 --> 01:55:02,010
diverse lineup even though there's way
less women interested in fighting.

2835
01:55:02,050 --> 01:55:03,310
I'm sure.
I'm sure that,

2836
01:55:03,311 --> 01:55:04,540
cause obviously,
I mean I,

2837
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:06,610
I'm,
I'm amazed that they're even any women

2838
01:55:06,611 --> 01:55:09,370
really don't want to be fighters.
But I mean obviously there's going to be

2839
01:55:09,371 --> 01:55:11,620
some,
but the vast majority of women that I

2840
01:55:11,621 --> 01:55:13,840
know,
they might like watching other men

2841
01:55:13,841 --> 01:55:15,760
fight,
but the last thing they want to do is

2842
01:55:15,761 --> 01:55:19,330
step in the ring because that's mostly a
masculine thing,

2843
01:55:19,660 --> 01:55:21,960
that type of violence.
You know,

2844
01:55:21,970 --> 01:55:24,670
most women that that doesn't mean
there's no women that want to do that.

2845
01:55:24,671 --> 01:55:25,870
Of course there's going to be women.

2846
01:55:25,970 --> 01:55:29,420
It's a good example cause they're
outliers and when you're just looking at

2847
01:55:29,421 --> 01:55:31,340
it without any discrimination,
you just looking at the,

2848
01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:35,690
this pursuit and trying to figure out
which genders are more likely to enter

2849
01:55:35,691 --> 01:55:38,090
this pursuit,
whether it's being a lumberjack or a

2850
01:55:38,091 --> 01:55:39,540
minor or whatever.
I,

2851
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:41,480
you could say all the factors you want
to look.

2852
01:55:41,481 --> 01:55:42,500
Well,
maybe they're worried about

2853
01:55:42,501 --> 01:55:44,190
discrimination of other men on the job.

2854
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:46,350
Maybe they're worried about being
sexually harassed me with a word about

2855
01:55:46,351 --> 01:55:48,000
this.
Whatever those factors are,

2856
01:55:48,180 --> 01:55:51,780
there's a lot more women that are
interested in other pursuits,

2857
01:55:51,781 --> 01:55:53,680
course nursing.
But then,

2858
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:55,770
and then when the government comes in
and just says,

2859
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:58,500
oh,
well the numbers are this and now we

2860
01:55:58,501 --> 01:56:02,160
have to fix this because this must be
the result of discrimination.

2861
01:56:02,190 --> 01:56:03,450
Yeah.
When it's not,

2862
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:07,260
it's just the natural result of people
acting freely,

2863
01:56:07,410 --> 01:56:09,450
but it's also good people's response to
that.

2864
01:56:09,451 --> 01:56:12,120
They almost can't have a measured
objective response.

2865
01:56:12,330 --> 01:56:16,950
Like the woman who's the CEO of Youtube
said that she was very hurt by that memo

2866
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:19,380
and that this guy was a massage.
It's the credit memo.

2867
01:56:19,470 --> 01:56:22,320
Meanwhile,
she's the fucking CEO of Youtube.

2868
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:26,790
Like she is like an example of a woman
that can succeed.

2869
01:56:26,791 --> 01:56:28,870
It does succeed because she does have
the personnel.

2870
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:29,821
And also,
you know,

2871
01:56:29,821 --> 01:56:32,330
I don't like this idea when you say,
oh I'm,

2872
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:33,540
I was offended.

2873
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:34,403
Right.
It's like,

2874
01:56:34,470 --> 01:56:34,861
hey,
you know,

2875
01:56:34,861 --> 01:56:36,480
you don't have a right not to be
offended.

2876
01:56:36,750 --> 01:56:37,201
I mean,
look,

2877
01:56:37,201 --> 01:56:38,610
you know,
you have to be a little sensitive.

2878
01:56:38,611 --> 01:56:40,410
You have to have a thicker skin.
You know,

2879
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:42,830
people are gonna say things that you
offend that,

2880
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:44,550
that are offensive to you.
That doesn't mean they don't have a

2881
01:56:44,551 --> 01:56:46,530
right to speak their mind.
You know,

2882
01:56:46,531 --> 01:56:47,311
people,
I mean that's,

2883
01:56:47,311 --> 01:56:48,900
you know,
you a lot of people now all of a sudden

2884
01:56:48,901 --> 01:56:52,000
freedom of speech just taken a back door
to my,

2885
01:56:52,070 --> 01:56:53,600
my sensibilities.
I don't,

2886
01:56:53,610 --> 01:56:55,710
I don't want to be,
I don't want to be offended because she

2887
01:56:55,711 --> 01:56:57,900
play out.
It's a cheap way out to just say I'm

2888
01:56:57,901 --> 01:57:00,050
offended.
And then people have to sort of act,

2889
01:57:00,051 --> 01:57:02,280
we ask and they have to figure out some
sort of a way to,

2890
01:57:02,830 --> 01:57:03,680
to,
you know,

2891
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:05,510
calm down your,
your,

2892
01:57:05,511 --> 01:57:08,160
uh,
offended personality or your,

2893
01:57:08,161 --> 01:57:10,980
your whatever it is about what you've
done.

2894
01:57:12,090 --> 01:57:13,080
Yeah.
And you know,

2895
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:14,460
no one,
as I said earlier,

2896
01:57:14,461 --> 01:57:16,050
I mean,
you don't have a right not to be

2897
01:57:16,051 --> 01:57:17,100
offended,
you know,

2898
01:57:17,101 --> 01:57:19,160
and there's gonna be a lot of defensive
people in the world and,

2899
01:57:19,161 --> 01:57:19,541
and,
and the,

2900
01:57:19,541 --> 01:57:21,960
and the reason that you defend,
uh,

2901
01:57:22,050 --> 01:57:24,810
people that are being offensive is not
because you're defending what they're

2902
01:57:24,811 --> 01:57:26,760
saying.
You're defending your right to be

2903
01:57:26,761 --> 01:57:28,830
offensive to other people.
Because look,

2904
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:31,320
there are a lot of people that said,
we talked about the socialists.

2905
01:57:31,321 --> 01:57:34,440
There can be a lot of socialists that
are offended by the fact that I believe

2906
01:57:34,441 --> 01:57:37,920
in the free market or people can be
offended that I think people should have

2907
01:57:37,921 --> 01:57:40,290
a right to be able to discriminate.
Right.

2908
01:57:40,291 --> 01:57:42,550
So,
but so now if,

2909
01:57:42,551 --> 01:57:45,330
if I'm not going to protect somebody
else's right to free speech,

2910
01:57:45,331 --> 01:57:48,150
then they could take away mine.
Cause I don't want the government

2911
01:57:48,151 --> 01:57:49,410
determining,
you know,

2912
01:57:49,411 --> 01:57:50,730
what's offensive and what's not.

2913
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:53,730
I don't want the government saying this
speech is protected in this speech,

2914
01:57:53,731 --> 01:57:55,380
isn't it?
Because the minute you go down that

2915
01:57:55,410 --> 01:57:56,850
slippery slope,
you know,

2916
01:57:56,851 --> 01:57:57,870
the next thing you know,
you know,

2917
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:00,630
all the libertarians are now fascist and
none of us can speak.

2918
01:58:00,631 --> 01:58:01,180
Right.
And the,

2919
01:58:01,180 --> 01:58:02,880
you,
the government gets more and more power

2920
01:58:02,881 --> 01:58:04,860
and they try to shut people up that want
to criticize it.

2921
01:58:04,890 --> 01:58:09,890
That's truly shrinking government and
truly letting the marketplace of ideas

2922
01:58:10,710 --> 01:58:13,950
decide what people do and don't do and
which way they gravitate.

2923
01:58:14,190 --> 01:58:14,941
Yeah.
And as I said,

2924
01:58:14,941 --> 01:58:18,990
I think the free market and competition
will punish racist.

2925
01:58:18,991 --> 01:58:22,800
I think their businesses will fail.
I don't think they're going to succeed

2926
01:58:22,980 --> 01:58:25,410
as well as people who are broader
minded,

2927
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:28,470
who are looking beyond sex and looking
beyond,

2928
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:29,220
uh,
you know,

2929
01:58:29,220 --> 01:58:30,930
race and just hiring,
uh,

2930
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:33,630
based on ability and based on,
you know,

2931
01:58:33,631 --> 01:58:35,570
all those other characteristics that
are,

2932
01:58:35,600 --> 01:58:37,740
that are relevant to the job
performance.

2933
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:41,190
And to the extent that there's going to
be a disparity,

2934
01:58:41,290 --> 01:58:42,280
if there's going to be certain

2935
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:46,420
occupations that are mostly men at the
certain occupations that are women,

2936
01:58:46,421 --> 01:58:49,870
it's not because of discrimination.
And in fact if you look at this nonsense

2937
01:58:49,871 --> 01:58:50,704
about,
you know,

2938
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:54,490
women are paid like seventies whatever's
sense for every man,

2939
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:57,130
which obviously that's not true because
that was true.

2940
01:58:57,131 --> 01:59:00,070
I would only hire women and pay him 77
cents on the dollar.

2941
01:59:00,071 --> 01:59:02,500
I mean,
if you could actually hire women cheaper

2942
01:59:02,501 --> 01:59:04,240
than men,
I mean I'm out.

2943
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:05,310
Why would,
why would I even know?

2944
01:59:05,311 --> 01:59:07,300
Why would I ever hire a man?
I would only hire women.

2945
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:11,070
I've had this conversation many times
with people that really believe that it

2946
01:59:11,071 --> 01:59:14,260
really believe in the gender pay gap.
There is no gender pay gap.

2947
01:59:14,410 --> 01:59:16,870
I mean if you,
isn't that an amazing statistic that

2948
01:59:16,871 --> 01:59:17,830
the,
even the president,

2949
01:59:17,831 --> 01:59:22,780
like when Obama was president,
he was saying that in a speech knowing

2950
01:59:22,781 --> 01:59:24,240
it was disingenuous.
Yeah,

2951
01:59:24,550 --> 01:59:25,670
no appeals

2952
01:59:25,670 --> 01:59:28,160
to women to get their votes.
But you know,

2953
01:59:28,250 --> 01:59:29,090
if,
if you,

2954
01:59:29,150 --> 01:59:33,560
if you,
if you basically a correct for all the

2955
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:35,060
jobs classes,
right?

2956
01:59:35,061 --> 01:59:38,210
So if you take a woman who's let's say
40 years old,

2957
01:59:38,570 --> 01:59:40,460
never been married,
man,

2958
01:59:40,461 --> 01:59:41,840
40 years old,
never married,

2959
01:59:41,930 --> 01:59:44,840
basically the same educational
background and you study,

2960
01:59:44,930 --> 01:59:47,150
you'll find that they pretty much make
the same.

2961
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:50,180
Right?
It's that when you look at the choices

2962
01:59:50,181 --> 01:59:54,110
that the typical woman makes during her
career and you know,

2963
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:57,650
even if it's the same occupation,
let's say they're both lawyers and they

2964
01:59:57,651 --> 02:00:00,710
both went to the same law school,
even if they both get married,

2965
02:00:01,010 --> 02:00:03,580
the chances are the woman,
you know,

2966
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:07,760
took a back,
took her law career and it became

2967
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:10,370
secondary to her children.
She's,

2968
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:11,870
she,
she worked fewer hours.

2969
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:15,650
She didn't travel as much.
She got herself off that track and went

2970
02:00:15,651 --> 02:00:17,850
on more of a mommy track because not,
no.

2971
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:18,860
Do all women do that?
No.

2972
02:00:18,861 --> 02:00:21,050
But more women are likely and,
and,

2973
02:00:21,051 --> 02:00:22,240
and they prefer that,
right?

2974
02:00:22,241 --> 02:00:24,920
They prefer so they don't,
they don't work as much.

2975
02:00:24,921 --> 02:00:29,420
They don't volunteer to travel as much.
And it's because of the choices that

2976
02:00:29,421 --> 02:00:33,170
they make along the way that they end up
earning less money than their male

2977
02:00:33,171 --> 02:00:35,180
counterpart.
Not because somebody has just

2978
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:38,300
discriminating against them.
Because there is a competitive market.

2979
02:00:38,301 --> 02:00:40,760
I mean,
if you are a woman that is working just

2980
02:00:40,761 --> 02:00:44,840
as hard as a man and you're sacrificing
everything for your career and you know

2981
02:00:45,320 --> 02:00:48,170
you're going to,
you're going to earn the same as the guy

2982
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:50,000
make us.
It's a competitive market,

2983
02:00:50,150 --> 02:00:52,250
especially for those higher skills.
I mean,

2984
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:55,970
you just can't underpay people in the
marketplace because somebody else will

2985
02:00:55,971 --> 02:00:58,670
outbid you.
But it's such a convenient talking

2986
02:00:58,671 --> 02:00:59,690
point.
It is.

2987
02:00:59,691 --> 02:01:01,460
It's the lie of it's,
it's the left.

2988
02:01:01,460 --> 02:01:02,650
It's how you get votes.
Like,

2989
02:01:02,780 --> 02:01:04,730
Hey,
you're getting paid less because you're

2990
02:01:04,731 --> 02:01:07,070
being victimized.
You're being discriminated against.

2991
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:11,810
So vote for me and I'll fix that.
I will force your employer to pay you

2992
02:01:11,811 --> 02:01:12,411
money.
And that's,

2993
02:01:12,411 --> 02:01:13,490
you know,
obviously,

2994
02:01:13,491 --> 02:01:15,340
you know,
there's that Willie Sutton was one of

2995
02:01:15,350 --> 02:01:16,430
his famous quotes was,
you know,

2996
02:01:16,431 --> 02:01:17,900
why do you rob banks?
Well,

2997
02:01:17,901 --> 02:01:19,430
because that's where the money is,
right?

2998
02:01:19,490 --> 02:01:24,490
So the votes are with employees much
more people have jobs then create jobs,

2999
02:01:25,131 --> 02:01:27,200
right?
So if you're trying to get the votes

3000
02:01:27,260 --> 02:01:30,110
votes of the employee,
that's better than getting votes of

3001
02:01:30,111 --> 02:01:32,150
employers.
So a lot of people get votes by

3002
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:34,640
promising to force their boss to give
them something.

3003
02:01:34,820 --> 02:01:38,330
You're going to get more vacations,
you're going to get a more sick days,

3004
02:01:38,390 --> 02:01:41,300
you're going to get and a half he's,
he's going to have to do this.

3005
02:01:41,301 --> 02:01:42,470
Well,
all that,

3006
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:44,810
the employer doesn't give you anything.

3007
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:47,840
So if he's going to give you more
vacation is because he's going to pay

3008
02:01:47,841 --> 02:01:48,920
you less than wages.
I mean,

3009
02:01:48,921 --> 02:01:50,000
it's all a trade off.
I mean,

3010
02:01:50,001 --> 02:01:52,100
when the government mandates certain
benefits,

3011
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:55,520
all they're doing is taking your choice
away to negotiate how you want to be

3012
02:01:55,521 --> 02:01:58,280
compensated.
Because ultimately the employer is not

3013
02:01:58,281 --> 02:02:00,500
going to pay you more than you're worth.
And if you say,

3014
02:02:00,501 --> 02:02:01,790
well,
you got to give this person,

3015
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:03,530
you know,
these vacations,

3016
02:02:03,531 --> 02:02:04,311
or you got,
okay,

3017
02:02:04,311 --> 02:02:06,770
well I gotta pay him less money so I can
give them the vacations.

3018
02:02:06,771 --> 02:02:08,510
It's all one big compensation package.

3019
02:02:08,650 --> 02:02:10,300
Well,
it seems like it's a political thing.

3020
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:12,520
Again,
it's a thing that people do in order to

3021
02:02:12,521 --> 02:02:16,690
get you to lean towards them more and to
have you feel that,

3022
02:02:17,010 --> 02:02:18,970
uh,
to have people feel that this person is

3023
02:02:18,971 --> 02:02:21,700
looking out for my needs.
This person is looking out from my point

3024
02:02:21,701 --> 02:02:22,780
of view,
my perspective,

3025
02:02:22,781 --> 02:02:25,060
and he understands the plight that women
go through.

3026
02:02:25,061 --> 02:02:28,170
Whereas Peter Schiff,
he's so hardcore,

3027
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:30,880
but you know,
it is capitalistic that he doesn't even

3028
02:02:30,881 --> 02:02:33,430
care about what women go through or
discrimination or,

3029
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,370
yeah.
And it's like the reality is if I didn't

3030
02:02:35,371 --> 02:02:37,860
care about women,
I wouldn't care about these laws.

3031
02:02:37,861 --> 02:02:40,620
I understand how these laws backfire and
hurt women.

3032
02:02:40,710 --> 02:02:41,890
I understand how,
you know,

3033
02:02:41,940 --> 02:02:44,730
all these laws that are meant to do good
actually do harm.

3034
02:02:44,850 --> 02:02:47,940
And that's one of the reasons that when
you find a lot of liberals,

3035
02:02:48,150 --> 02:02:51,480
they actually think conservatives or
libertarians are bad people,

3036
02:02:51,570 --> 02:02:52,320
right?
Because they said,

3037
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:54,240
hey,
you're against this law.

3038
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:57,210
You must be a bad person because this
law is going to help people in their

3039
02:02:57,211 --> 02:02:59,760
mind you are.
Because otherwise I would support the

3040
02:02:59,761 --> 02:03:00,594
law.
Right?

3041
02:03:00,660 --> 02:03:03,030
See,
when I think about most liberals,

3042
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:05,520
I don't think they're bad.
I just think they're misunderstood.

3043
02:03:05,521 --> 02:03:06,540
They're,
they're misinformed.

3044
02:03:06,541 --> 02:03:07,710
They're ignorant.
They don't understand.

3045
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:09,420
I just,
they're good people,

3046
02:03:09,450 --> 02:03:12,630
but they're going about it in a bad way.
They don't understand that the road to

3047
02:03:12,631 --> 02:03:14,250
hell is paved with good intentions.

3048
02:03:14,430 --> 02:03:16,800
I don't want to go to hell.
I don't care how many good intentions

3049
02:03:16,801 --> 02:03:18,870
you have.
If I know that that road is going to

3050
02:03:18,871 --> 02:03:20,670
hell,
I'm going to try my best,

3051
02:03:20,790 --> 02:03:21,350
you know,
to,

3052
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:22,950
to build a different road.
Right.

3053
02:03:22,951 --> 02:03:26,490
And I,
I believe that free market capitalism is

3054
02:03:26,491 --> 02:03:28,890
the best way to raise the standard of
living of everybody.

3055
02:03:28,891 --> 02:03:30,660
Whether you're a woman,
whether you're black,

3056
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:34,530
whether you're homosexual,
it's the individual acting freely.

3057
02:03:34,531 --> 02:03:37,830
That's going to be your best hope.
If you're going to empower government,

3058
02:03:38,070 --> 02:03:39,660
and this is one of the things that you
don't never,

3059
02:03:39,661 --> 02:03:41,520
I can never figure out because people
are,

3060
02:03:41,521 --> 02:03:43,050
again,
they're very suspicious of,

3061
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:45,780
of,
of businesses and businessmen,

3062
02:03:46,050 --> 02:03:48,390
yet they can have complete trust in
politicians.

3063
02:03:49,010 --> 02:03:52,830
You get politicians all this power and
then you trust them to use it.

3064
02:03:52,831 --> 02:03:53,820
But evidently,
I mean,

3065
02:03:53,821 --> 02:03:57,810
why aren't they just as corrupt?
Just because somebody uses politics to

3066
02:03:57,811 --> 02:04:00,510
get rich doesn't mean they're on some
moral high ground.

3067
02:04:00,630 --> 02:04:01,500
Well,
even worse.

3068
02:04:01,530 --> 02:04:05,190
This idea that if you give it more of
your taxes that the government is

3069
02:04:05,191 --> 02:04:08,310
somehow another going to going to be
competent with how they distribute those

3070
02:04:08,311 --> 02:04:11,730
taxes and that there's some going to be
egalitarian.

3071
02:04:11,731 --> 02:04:14,580
The they're gonna use the taxes for good
like that.

3072
02:04:14,581 --> 02:04:18,810
It's a very disgusting sort of an idea
and the idea that any sense at all

3073
02:04:18,910 --> 02:04:22,270
or the idea that government is going to
make better decisions for you or your

3074
02:04:22,271 --> 02:04:23,530
family,
then you are right.

3075
02:04:23,531 --> 02:04:25,030
I mean the government doesn't even know
you.

3076
02:04:25,031 --> 02:04:27,040
They don't know your kids yet.
You're going to,

3077
02:04:27,070 --> 02:04:29,500
they're going to decide,
you know what they eat or where they go

3078
02:04:29,501 --> 02:04:33,310
to school or you know know that the
people that care about your kids or you,

3079
02:04:33,640 --> 02:04:34,630
right,
you care.

3080
02:04:34,631 --> 02:04:38,280
I mean look at these lousy schools that
unfortunately why so many people vote

3081
02:04:38,281 --> 02:04:41,580
for Bernie Sanders is because they went
to these government schools and they got

3082
02:04:41,581 --> 02:04:44,220
a lousy education.
Their teachers a socialist.

3083
02:04:44,430 --> 02:04:46,260
It's all the whole socialists,
the system.

3084
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:50,160
But the parents are trapped because
their taxes are already paying for these

3085
02:04:50,161 --> 02:04:52,020
lousy schools.
They're monopolies,

3086
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:53,550
you know?
And so,

3087
02:04:53,551 --> 02:04:56,310
but if the Liberals Act as if,
well,

3088
02:04:56,311 --> 02:04:59,280
if we didn't have government schools,
then parents wouldn't educate their

3089
02:04:59,281 --> 02:05:00,240
kids.
Of course they would.

3090
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:02,820
You don't think they would send their
kids to private schools and they'd be a

3091
02:05:02,821 --> 02:05:04,770
lot less expensive.
And you'd have all kinds of

3092
02:05:04,771 --> 02:05:06,600
entrepreneurs who are trying to earn
money,

3093
02:05:06,601 --> 02:05:10,020
educating poor kids,
just like people earn a lot of money,

3094
02:05:10,021 --> 02:05:12,270
clothing,
poor kids and feeding poor kids and,

3095
02:05:12,420 --> 02:05:14,690
and housing them.
I mean if there's money to be made and

3096
02:05:14,691 --> 02:05:17,790
entrepreneur is going to come in and
satisfy that desire,

3097
02:05:17,930 --> 02:05:20,740
but you against public education or do
you just think that,

3098
02:05:20,980 --> 02:05:22,950
what do you think?
It shouldn't be subsidized the way it

3099
02:05:22,951 --> 02:05:24,510
is,
like especially colleges.

3100
02:05:24,570 --> 02:05:28,710
Well,
I think that government education is

3101
02:05:28,950 --> 02:05:31,200
much too expensive and not good enough.
I mean,

3102
02:05:31,201 --> 02:05:32,070
people think that,
oh,

3103
02:05:32,071 --> 02:05:35,130
we need the government to educate.
And I think,

3104
02:05:35,131 --> 02:05:36,880
you know,
education is very important and I,

3105
02:05:36,881 --> 02:05:39,030
I don't think it's so important.
We just shouldn't leave it up to

3106
02:05:39,031 --> 02:05:40,930
government.
I think that the free market,

3107
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:44,400
the free market does a better job of
creating computers,

3108
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:44,730
right?

3109
02:05:44,730 --> 02:05:48,480
I think it will do a better job of
creating education and people are

3110
02:05:48,481 --> 02:05:50,790
struggling.
They really liked the idea that at least

3111
02:05:51,270 --> 02:05:53,700
education is free for the children.
It's not free.

3112
02:05:54,060 --> 02:05:56,070
Every nothing that the government
provides is free.

3113
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:57,560
It costs money,
right?

3114
02:05:57,570 --> 02:06:01,280
Where's that money coming from?
The government has to take money and the

3115
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:04,020
stuff that you get for free from the
government is very expensive.

3116
02:06:04,350 --> 02:06:07,710
The stuff that you get from the free
market that you pay for is much less

3117
02:06:07,711 --> 02:06:09,420
expensive and it's a much higher
quality.

3118
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:11,610
Now,
you know the problem with colleges,

3119
02:06:11,611 --> 02:06:13,080
right?
We have a lot of colleges that are not

3120
02:06:13,081 --> 02:06:16,170
run necessarily by government,
but why are they so expensive?

3121
02:06:16,350 --> 02:06:20,610
Because the government subsidizes
university tuition by either

3122
02:06:20,611 --> 02:06:24,000
guaranteeing loans or directly providing
loans to students,

3123
02:06:24,210 --> 02:06:27,780
and this drives up the price of college.
The reason that college is so expensive

3124
02:06:27,930 --> 02:06:30,450
is because of government subsidizing the
cost.

3125
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:33,540
So there is no free market to control
the cost.

3126
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:37,590
You just have the government to
subsidize the ever escalating costs and

3127
02:06:37,591 --> 02:06:39,050
providing all this money.
So now you know,

3128
02:06:39,090 --> 02:06:42,810
people go to college and they graduate
with a mortgage without a house.

3129
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:44,790
That's,
that's the government that's did that.

3130
02:06:44,791 --> 02:06:48,060
But you have these liberals,
they think the government is helping

3131
02:06:48,061 --> 02:06:48,570
them.
Like the,

3132
02:06:48,570 --> 02:06:49,381
the liberal,
we'll say,

3133
02:06:49,381 --> 02:06:51,840
vote for me and I'll,
I'll make sure you get a loan so you can

3134
02:06:51,841 --> 02:06:52,860
go to college.
Well,

3135
02:06:52,861 --> 02:06:56,070
the only reason they need a loan is
because the college is so expensive.

3136
02:06:56,071 --> 02:06:58,620
And why is it college so expensive?
Because of the loans.

3137
02:06:59,130 --> 02:07:03,090
You know what I mean?
My father went to college and his

3138
02:07:03,091 --> 02:07:05,640
parents didn't have any money because
they were poor and middle,

3139
02:07:05,641 --> 02:07:07,230
lower middle class.
Uh,

3140
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:11,130
but so he worked his way through college
by having a summer job.

3141
02:07:11,190 --> 02:07:13,470
And that summer job was enough to pay
for everything.

3142
02:07:13,471 --> 02:07:14,251
Room,
board,

3143
02:07:14,251 --> 02:07:16,380
tuition,
and all of his friends work their way

3144
02:07:16,381 --> 02:07:19,170
through college.
Why can't Americans work their way

3145
02:07:19,171 --> 02:07:21,210
through college today?
Because the government made college so

3146
02:07:21,211 --> 02:07:24,210
expensive because of all this,
all the loans.

3147
02:07:24,360 --> 02:07:25,800
But what happened is the government
said,

3148
02:07:25,801 --> 02:07:27,690
hey,
you don't have to have a job while

3149
02:07:27,691 --> 02:07:28,650
you're in college.
We'll just,

3150
02:07:28,860 --> 02:07:30,600
we'll just guarantee alone,
you know,

3151
02:07:30,601 --> 02:07:32,010
and you'll just be able to borrow the
money.

3152
02:07:32,220 --> 02:07:34,680
But you know,
graduated with a bunch of debt,

3153
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:37,540
doesn't do the kids any favors.
They would've been better off,

3154
02:07:37,570 --> 02:07:38,400
you know,
you know,

3155
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:40,690
pain having a summer job instead of
like,

3156
02:07:40,691 --> 02:07:42,820
you know,
just partying all summer or taking

3157
02:07:42,850 --> 02:07:45,760
spamming their summers around Europe
while they're borrowing money.

3158
02:07:45,860 --> 02:07:47,680
Well,
it's two giant issues with that one.

3159
02:07:47,681 --> 02:07:51,310
One giant issue with the debt is you're
getting out of college and you're going

3160
02:07:51,311 --> 02:07:53,650
to take a job that's probably not going
to pay you a whole lot in the first

3161
02:07:53,651 --> 02:07:57,970
place and you're saddled down with who
knows how many thousands,

3162
02:07:57,971 --> 02:08:00,160
maybe even hundreds of thousands of
dollars worth of debt.

3163
02:08:00,310 --> 02:08:04,150
And then on top of that,
you can't even go bankrupt and dissolve

3164
02:08:04,151 --> 02:08:05,410
that debt.
It's the well,

3165
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:07,600
his country that you're stuck with
forever.

3166
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:12,990
Terrible kids take on this debt when
they're 17 1819 making good decisions.

3167
02:08:13,101 --> 02:08:15,150
So they're terrible decisions.
They're horrible decision.

3168
02:08:15,151 --> 02:08:15,860
You look,
you know,

3169
02:08:15,860 --> 02:08:17,020
they,
they don't understand.

3170
02:08:17,021 --> 02:08:18,970
They don't know anything about money.
There are two consequences.

3171
02:08:18,971 --> 02:08:20,680
Yeah.
And they've been fed a lie that will,

3172
02:08:20,681 --> 02:08:21,880
you know,
if you don't go to college,

3173
02:08:21,881 --> 02:08:23,200
your life is ruined.
You'll never,

3174
02:08:23,260 --> 02:08:24,160
you know,
I knew I,

3175
02:08:24,161 --> 02:08:26,020
you know,
do some of my videos on my channel,

3176
02:08:26,050 --> 02:08:28,630
my youtube channel and,
and one of the videos that I did and I

3177
02:08:28,631 --> 02:08:30,820
wish it got more views and maybe it will
be,

3178
02:08:30,821 --> 02:08:33,100
I could talk about on your show,
what does the Youtube Channel Tell

3179
02:08:33,101 --> 02:08:34,210
people?
Peter Schiff.

3180
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:35,440
Peter.
Yeah.

3181
02:08:35,530 --> 02:08:37,210
My name is uh,
you know the shift report,

3182
02:08:37,630 --> 02:08:40,910
but one of the videos I did and I
called,

3183
02:08:40,911 --> 02:08:43,300
it's a,
is a college degree worth the cost you

3184
02:08:43,301 --> 02:08:46,810
decide.
And I did this like four years ago down

3185
02:08:46,811 --> 02:08:47,644
in New Orleans.

3186
02:08:47,800 --> 02:08:50,350
And um,
I went down the street and I was asking

3187
02:08:50,351 --> 02:08:53,350
people who were working,
I didn't talk to people who are just

3188
02:08:53,351 --> 02:08:55,480
there to have drinks.
I worked at the people who were working

3189
02:08:55,481 --> 02:08:56,560
on Bourbon Street,
right.

3190
02:08:56,830 --> 02:08:59,440
They were strippers,
they were bouncers,

3191
02:08:59,590 --> 02:09:02,110
they were petty cab drivers,
they were bartenders.

3192
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:04,960
They were taken out the trash cans and I
didn't discriminate.

3193
02:09:04,990 --> 02:09:09,190
I asked everybody I saw and almost
everybody I talked to is on this video.

3194
02:09:09,191 --> 02:09:10,720
I mean,
very few people didn't make it.

3195
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:13,930
And I basically said,
did you go to college?

3196
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:15,460
When did you graduate?
Right?

3197
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,070
Uh,
what was your major and how much do you

3198
02:09:18,071 --> 02:09:19,000
owe?
Right?

3199
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:23,230
And every single person that I talked to
that was doing a menial job,

3200
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:25,690
and some of,
some of them had two or three degrees,

3201
02:09:26,420 --> 02:09:29,490
master's degrees.
And this is all and,

3202
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:30,790
and,
and the point was,

3203
02:09:30,791 --> 02:09:33,400
and some people thought I was trying to
make fun of the people and I wasn't

3204
02:09:33,401 --> 02:09:34,300
trying to make fun of anybody.

3205
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:37,960
I was trying to prove a point that this
was a complete waste of time and money.

3206
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:41,650
That these individuals could have done
these jobs without college.

3207
02:09:41,770 --> 02:09:44,200
They could have done it right out of
high school without all this debt.

3208
02:09:44,710 --> 02:09:47,710
And that just having these degrees
didn't mean anything.

3209
02:09:47,770 --> 02:09:51,400
Who benefited from these degrees?
The universities that sold these

3210
02:09:51,401 --> 02:09:53,980
overpriced degrees,
they benefited the,

3211
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:55,990
you know,
that that's who benefits from all these

3212
02:09:55,991 --> 02:09:59,280
college loans.
Not these kids who borrow $50,000 and

3213
02:09:59,281 --> 02:10:02,770
now hour emptying trash cans because
they got some liberal arts degree that's

3214
02:10:02,771 --> 02:10:04,700
meaningless.
It's the universities,

3215
02:10:04,710 --> 02:10:09,190
the college that got the over got to
overcharge for degree that the kid would

3216
02:10:09,191 --> 02:10:11,770
have been better off without.
And then there's also the opportunity

3217
02:10:11,771 --> 02:10:12,700
cost.
You know,

3218
02:10:12,730 --> 02:10:15,670
you spend five or six years now and
these overcrowded colleges,

3219
02:10:15,671 --> 02:10:16,750
you know,
you should be four years,

3220
02:10:16,751 --> 02:10:19,990
but now it's so hard to get the classes
that sometimes it takes you five or six

3221
02:10:19,991 --> 02:10:22,480
years to even graduate and you graduate
with nothing.

3222
02:10:22,930 --> 02:10:25,360
You've got a worthless degree.
You've got politicians that are saying

3223
02:10:25,361 --> 02:10:26,890
everybody needs to have a college
degree.

3224
02:10:27,070 --> 02:10:28,450
Okay,
well if everybody has one,

3225
02:10:28,451 --> 02:10:29,650
what's it worth?
Nothing.

3226
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:31,150
You know,
at one point,

3227
02:10:31,180 --> 02:10:33,440
maybe one in 10 people had a college
degree because,

3228
02:10:33,441 --> 02:10:36,020
and then it actually meant something
because you had something that not

3229
02:10:36,021 --> 02:10:37,970
everybody else has.
But you know,

3230
02:10:37,971 --> 02:10:41,240
if everybody has a degree,
then you've actually destroyed the value

3231
02:10:41,241 --> 02:10:42,920
of the degree.
And that's what the government has done.

3232
02:10:42,921 --> 02:10:45,320
They've made a degree,
extremely expensive to get,

3233
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:48,620
but there's very little value.
And you have all these politicians are

3234
02:10:48,650 --> 02:10:50,450
not qualities.
Maybe colleges,

3235
02:10:50,870 --> 02:10:53,360
they'll try to say,
look at how much more money people make

3236
02:10:53,361 --> 02:10:56,510
who have college degrees versus people
who don't have college degrees.

3237
02:10:56,690 --> 02:10:59,180
And they assume that the reason for that
is the college degree.

3238
02:10:59,450 --> 02:11:01,010
Again,
it's false statistics,

3239
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:04,340
right?
Because think about the typical person

3240
02:11:04,341 --> 02:11:05,630
who chooses to go to college.

3241
02:11:05,690 --> 02:11:07,640
They're smarter,
they're more ambitious,

3242
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:10,640
they're harder working.
That's why they're making more money,

3243
02:11:10,850 --> 02:11:12,920
not because they have a degree,
right?

3244
02:11:13,070 --> 02:11:17,360
So if you probably looked at two
individuals from the same circumstances,

3245
02:11:17,390 --> 02:11:20,510
maybe same high school,
same demographic,

3246
02:11:20,511 --> 02:11:23,030
they got the same GPA,
they got the same,

3247
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:23,901
uh,
you know,

3248
02:11:23,901 --> 02:11:24,530
uh,
uh,

3249
02:11:24,530 --> 02:11:25,820
uh,
sat scores.

3250
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:28,760
One went to college and one didn't,
and then you followed them.

3251
02:11:29,060 --> 02:11:33,230
You might find that the guy that had the
gumption to skip college is actually

3252
02:11:33,231 --> 02:11:35,480
making more money than the guy who went
to college.

3253
02:11:35,540 --> 02:11:37,140
Maybe he started a business,
maybe he,

3254
02:11:37,190 --> 02:11:40,970
he gained some real world experience and
then he wasn't encumbered by a bunch of

3255
02:11:40,971 --> 02:11:41,751
debt.
Right?

3256
02:11:41,751 --> 02:11:43,670
So it's not the college degree at this
point.

3257
02:11:43,671 --> 02:11:44,120
No.
Yet.

3258
02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:47,210
If you want to be a doctor,
sure you got to go to college or you got

3259
02:11:47,211 --> 02:11:51,440
to go to med school,
but there are a lot of things that you

3260
02:11:51,441 --> 02:11:54,620
don't need a college degree to do and a
lot of people who were doing them have

3261
02:11:54,621 --> 02:11:58,520
college degrees and their success is not
a function of that college degree.

3262
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:00,440
It's a,
it's a function of the hard work that

3263
02:12:00,441 --> 02:12:02,300
they did after they left.
College.

3264
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:05,990
Education is very important,
but you can get a tremendous amount of

3265
02:12:05,991 --> 02:12:08,150
education today and this is not,
you know,

3266
02:12:08,151 --> 02:12:11,240
the 18 hundreds you can get it online.
Oh you can get it through books.

3267
02:12:11,241 --> 02:12:13,190
You can get it through audio course.
I mean I'm not,

3268
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:17,210
sometimes I'm not anti-education.
I think people should educate themselves

3269
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:19,510
and you're anti the college debt people
are,

3270
02:12:19,670 --> 02:12:21,710
well,
I'm anti the government saying the only

3271
02:12:21,711 --> 02:12:23,750
way to get educated is to have a school
do it.

3272
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:25,670
I mean,
you know there are a lot of Americans we

3273
02:12:25,671 --> 02:12:27,110
talked about,
you know Robert E.

3274
02:12:27,110 --> 02:12:28,370
Lee,
but you'd go to the founding fathers.

3275
02:12:28,371 --> 02:12:31,070
A lot of these guys were all self
educated men.

3276
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:33,020
They didn't necessarily go to college.
Some of them did,

3277
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:34,640
but a lot of them were self educated.

3278
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:38,180
And believe me back then,
educating yourself was pretty hard.

3279
02:12:38,181 --> 02:12:40,700
I mean the only books you had were the
ones that you could check out of a

3280
02:12:40,701 --> 02:12:41,900
library.
I mean,

3281
02:12:41,901 --> 02:12:45,320
now anybody,
any kid in a poor inner city has

3282
02:12:45,321 --> 02:12:48,440
everything at his fingertips.
You could go on the Internet and you can

3283
02:12:48,441 --> 02:12:52,790
teach yourself and in fact professors
can sell courses online.

3284
02:12:52,910 --> 02:12:54,470
You don't have to,
you know,

3285
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:56,040
go to a college.
I uh,

3286
02:12:56,250 --> 02:12:58,790
uh,
some professor can have a tutorial site

3287
02:12:58,940 --> 02:13:00,110
and he could charge like,
you know,

3288
02:13:00,111 --> 02:13:02,740
10 bucks a month and he could give
lectures and he can teach,

3289
02:13:02,870 --> 02:13:06,830
you can learn all sorts of stuff without
enriching some government bureaucracy,

3290
02:13:06,831 --> 02:13:11,831
some college or university.
And you don't have to borrow tens of

3291
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:14,270
thousands or hundreds of thousands of
dollars to learn what you can learn for

3292
02:13:14,271 --> 02:13:16,940
practically nothing on the Internet.
Yeah.

3293
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:19,550
Speaking to the,
I know we spent a lot of time here,

3294
02:13:19,551 --> 02:13:22,820
but I can't let you leave unless I ask
you this one last thing.

3295
02:13:23,120 --> 02:13:25,460
What are your thoughts on
cryptocurrencies,

3296
02:13:25,490 --> 02:13:27,590
specifically bitcoin and all these
different,

3297
02:13:27,591 --> 02:13:28,490
yeah,
and I know,

3298
02:13:28,491 --> 02:13:30,010
let's talk about that and let's,
you know,

3299
02:13:30,090 --> 02:13:32,190
hopefully we have enough time to really
hash this,

3300
02:13:32,191 --> 02:13:33,011
this subject.
How,

3301
02:13:33,011 --> 02:13:33,601
cause I know,
you know,

3302
02:13:33,601 --> 02:13:38,040
I was on your show a few years ago and
we talked about cryptocurrencies and you

3303
02:13:38,041 --> 02:13:40,110
know,
I was very skeptical about them then and

3304
02:13:40,111 --> 02:13:42,600
I'm as skeptical about them now,
but of course,

3305
02:13:42,601 --> 02:13:46,500
obviously had you just bought them when
I was here a few years ago.

3306
02:13:46,550 --> 02:13:47,520
Skyrocket,
right?

3307
02:13:47,530 --> 02:13:49,920
I mean,
obviously if you bought them back then

3308
02:13:50,310 --> 02:13:53,700
you could turn around and you can sell
them today for a lot more money,

3309
02:13:53,730 --> 02:13:54,330
right?
So,

3310
02:13:54,330 --> 02:13:56,670
but does that mean they're going to
work?

3311
02:13:56,700 --> 02:14:01,470
Does that mean they're going to fulfill
the promise that everybody believes?

3312
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:03,540
Right?
And what is it that people believe about

3313
02:14:03,541 --> 02:14:06,120
bitcoin and you know,
they believe that it's going to be

3314
02:14:06,121 --> 02:14:06,810
money,
right?

3315
02:14:06,810 --> 02:14:11,810
That is going to either replace or exist
alongside of the dollar,

3316
02:14:13,050 --> 02:14:14,730
the euro,
the yen,

3317
02:14:14,731 --> 02:14:15,240
right?
That it's,

3318
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:18,420
people are going to use it as a medium
of exchange that is going to be a store

3319
02:14:18,421 --> 02:14:20,930
of value.
And they're,

3320
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:23,250
it's just not going to work.
It is not going to happen.

3321
02:14:23,251 --> 02:14:25,890
I know there are a lot of people that
believe this and they almost believe it,

3322
02:14:25,891 --> 02:14:26,820
like a cult,
right?

3323
02:14:26,821 --> 02:14:29,910
They believe it like a religion.
And the fact that I don't believe it,

3324
02:14:30,150 --> 02:14:30,811
I'm just,
you know,

3325
02:14:30,811 --> 02:14:31,181
I,
I'm,

3326
02:14:31,181 --> 02:14:32,730
I'm either a fool,
I just,

3327
02:14:32,731 --> 02:14:34,950
I'm stuck in my ways.
I just don't get it,

3328
02:14:34,951 --> 02:14:35,790
you know,
and,

3329
02:14:35,791 --> 02:14:36,131
you know,
look,

3330
02:14:36,131 --> 02:14:38,670
you know,
I've seen it all before when it came to

3331
02:14:38,671 --> 02:14:42,690
the dotcoms when it came to the real
estate and it's not that,

3332
02:14:42,691 --> 02:14:47,190
like I did a podcast again on my own and
I was trying to compare,

3333
02:14:47,770 --> 02:14:48,330
uh,
I was,

3334
02:14:48,330 --> 02:14:49,410
I was looking at,
uh,

3335
02:14:49,630 --> 02:14:51,390
uh,
the Internet stocks and I was talking,

3336
02:14:51,391 --> 02:14:53,460
I use pets.com as an example.

3337
02:14:53,460 --> 02:14:53,870
And I,
you know,

3338
02:14:53,870 --> 02:14:57,600
looked at bitcoin and then somebody did
a video critical of me trying to explain

3339
02:14:57,601 --> 02:15:00,240
that,
why bitcoin is not like pets.com.

3340
02:15:00,810 --> 02:15:05,460
And I never tried to equate the two.
What I was talking about was the idea

3341
02:15:05,461 --> 02:15:09,000
when pets.com was started and people
were making money because the stock went

3342
02:15:09,001 --> 02:15:09,834
up,
right?

3343
02:15:10,770 --> 02:15:13,620
They thought that the business would
succeed as a business,

3344
02:15:13,621 --> 02:15:16,110
that it would make a profit right now,
it never did.

3345
02:15:16,111 --> 02:15:20,700
It went bankrupt,
but people bought it early on and it

3346
02:15:20,701 --> 02:15:23,400
went up.
Now the fact that it went up didn't mean

3347
02:15:23,401 --> 02:15:25,560
that they were right in their ultimate
bet.

3348
02:15:25,590 --> 02:15:28,860
It just meant that other people made the
same mistake and paid an even higher

3349
02:15:28,861 --> 02:15:31,350
price.
And so you can be wrong,

3350
02:15:31,410 --> 02:15:35,670
but still profit from being wrong as
long as there are other fools who are

3351
02:15:35,671 --> 02:15:38,540
also wrong.
And that's where I see the similarity in

3352
02:15:38,541 --> 02:15:40,050
the cryptocurrencies or bitcoin.

3353
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:43,470
If somebody bought bitcoin a year ago,
two years ago,

3354
02:15:43,471 --> 02:15:45,300
five years ago,
and it's now a lot higher,

3355
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:50,220
it's only hire because other people are
more foolish than they were and other

3356
02:15:50,250 --> 02:15:53,220
more people now believe something that's
not going to happen.

3357
02:15:53,370 --> 02:15:54,670
Why do you think it's not going to
happen?

3358
02:15:54,671 --> 02:15:56,250
And what do you think are the
restrictions?

3359
02:15:56,640 --> 02:15:57,840
Okay,
so that's holding it back.

3360
02:15:58,340 --> 02:16:01,920
All right?
So people have to understand what money

3361
02:16:01,921 --> 02:16:04,260
is and what can succeed as money,
right?

3362
02:16:04,261 --> 02:16:09,180
Because yes,
dollars and euros and yen intrinsically,

3363
02:16:09,181 --> 02:16:11,430
there's no value there.
It's just a piece of paper and they're

3364
02:16:11,431 --> 02:16:14,010
created out of thin air.
But they didn't,

3365
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:15,780
that wasn't always the case.
I mean,

3366
02:16:15,810 --> 02:16:18,930
the dollar used to be backed by gold.
And what gave the dollar value was the

3367
02:16:18,931 --> 02:16:20,670
gold backing.
That's why it had value,

3368
02:16:20,671 --> 02:16:23,470
because you can go and get gold for it
and you can convert it to gold,

3369
02:16:24,720 --> 02:16:26,850
but gold.

3370
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:29,740
Right?
The reason that gold became money and a

3371
02:16:29,741 --> 02:16:32,950
lot of things have been money and the
most,

3372
02:16:33,370 --> 02:16:33,900
the,
the,

3373
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:35,080
the,
what's been money,

3374
02:16:35,081 --> 02:16:37,300
the most successful has been precious
metals.

3375
02:16:37,301 --> 02:16:39,550
People have used precious metals and
gold is just spend,

3376
02:16:39,740 --> 02:16:40,280
uh,
the,

3377
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:43,120
the most precious of the metals that has
served as money.

3378
02:16:43,870 --> 02:16:47,260
But the reason that gold became money
and because before we had money,

3379
02:16:47,470 --> 02:16:48,760
it was all barter,
right?

3380
02:16:49,030 --> 02:16:49,820
That's,
you know,

3381
02:16:49,820 --> 02:16:54,400
[inaudible] if you,
if you made a chairs and you wanted a,

3382
02:16:54,401 --> 02:16:55,330
you know,
a chicken,

3383
02:16:55,331 --> 02:16:57,940
you had to find a guy that grew chickens
who wanted one of your chairs,

3384
02:16:57,941 --> 02:16:58,390
right?
You had,

3385
02:16:58,390 --> 02:17:01,090
it was very inefficient barter,
but,

3386
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:04,030
uh,
everybody wanted gold,

3387
02:17:04,060 --> 02:17:09,010
or at least wealthy people wanted gold.
It was a scarce item that everybody

3388
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:11,950
desired.
But the beauty of gold was that it's all

3389
02:17:11,951 --> 02:17:13,690
the same.
You can melt it down.

3390
02:17:14,030 --> 02:17:16,610
You announced the gold is,
you know,

3391
02:17:16,700 --> 02:17:18,730
is the same as any other ounce of gold.

3392
02:17:19,150 --> 02:17:21,280
And people realize that,
wait a minute,

3393
02:17:21,310 --> 02:17:24,910
instead of me looking for a chicken guy
that wants my chair,

3394
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:27,310
I'll just go,
uh,

3395
02:17:27,490 --> 02:17:30,190
you know,
give somebody gold.

3396
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:32,740
They don't need my chair.
They can buy whatever they want with a

3397
02:17:32,741 --> 02:17:36,130
gold because gold is a commodity to,
it has value.

3398
02:17:36,310 --> 02:17:38,500
But unlike a chair,
it's uniform.

3399
02:17:38,501 --> 02:17:40,330
You can put it in your pocket,
you know,

3400
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:42,220
and,
and they're all the same and you can

3401
02:17:42,221 --> 02:17:45,130
divide up.
So gold had these properties that made

3402
02:17:45,131 --> 02:17:47,740
it money and it was a store value.
And then,

3403
02:17:47,741 --> 02:17:50,110
you know,
over time there was pricing.

3404
02:17:50,111 --> 02:17:54,430
People could relate how much is a barrel
of oil terms of gold,

3405
02:17:54,431 --> 02:17:58,810
how much is a Bushel of wheat?
You can relate one commodity to another

3406
02:17:58,811 --> 02:18:01,330
and understand pricing,
right?

3407
02:18:01,331 --> 02:18:02,110
Like,
you know,

3408
02:18:02,110 --> 02:18:02,790
uh,
in,

3409
02:18:02,790 --> 02:18:04,470
in Roman times,
you know,

3410
02:18:04,480 --> 02:18:07,030
you could buy a Toga,
a nice toga for an ounce of gold,

3411
02:18:07,150 --> 02:18:07,330
right?

3412
02:18:07,330 --> 02:18:10,450
So a man,
a man could buy what was clothing back

3413
02:18:10,451 --> 02:18:13,090
then for an ounce of gold when you can
buy a suit of clothes today,

3414
02:18:13,091 --> 02:18:14,560
a nice suit of clothes for an ounce of
gold.

3415
02:18:14,561 --> 02:18:15,161
So,
you know,

3416
02:18:15,161 --> 02:18:18,700
prices have kind of remained relatively
constant and certain things.

3417
02:18:18,701 --> 02:18:22,330
So now years ago,
I guess some Libertarians and some other

3418
02:18:22,331 --> 02:18:23,680
people got the idea,
you know,

3419
02:18:23,740 --> 02:18:25,990
crypt Fiat currencies are no good,
which is true.

3420
02:18:26,020 --> 02:18:28,900
They're not backed by anything
governance,

3421
02:18:28,901 --> 02:18:30,880
keep printing them.
They got quantitative easing,

3422
02:18:30,881 --> 02:18:34,960
0% of the trades gold though they said
Gold is inefficient,

3423
02:18:34,961 --> 02:18:36,340
right?
If I got announced the gold,

3424
02:18:36,341 --> 02:18:38,290
I really can't use it in commerce.
I mean,

3425
02:18:38,291 --> 02:18:41,620
I can't scrape off a little piece of it
and buy a cup of coffee.

3426
02:18:41,621 --> 02:18:44,350
I can't send it across the world.
And you know,

3427
02:18:44,351 --> 02:18:44,980
and,
and,

3428
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:47,350
and,
and conduct an ecommerce.

3429
02:18:47,710 --> 02:18:49,960
So they came up with,
someone came up with a,

3430
02:18:49,961 --> 02:18:51,230
a digital currency initiative.

3431
02:18:51,230 --> 02:18:55,510
The first one probably being bitcoin,
which was supposedly replicating all the

3432
02:18:55,511 --> 02:18:58,990
properties of gold only digitally and
making it better,

3433
02:18:58,991 --> 02:18:59,830
right?
So it's like,

3434
02:19:00,060 --> 02:19:00,821
you know,
you're mine,

3435
02:19:00,821 --> 02:19:01,720
these bitcoins,
right?

3436
02:19:01,721 --> 02:19:04,450
Even though there's no actual mining,
you're solving these math problems,

3437
02:19:04,451 --> 02:19:07,300
but you could have a bitcoin.
I can give it to you,

3438
02:19:07,301 --> 02:19:10,630
you can give it to me,
I can break it in half intense,

3439
02:19:10,690 --> 02:19:12,040
you know,
and it's divisible.

3440
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:12,581
It's,
you know,

3441
02:19:12,581 --> 02:19:13,750
it's portable,
you know,

3442
02:19:13,820 --> 02:19:15,040
it,
it doesn't decay,

3443
02:19:15,041 --> 02:19:16,270
it doesn't go away,
right?

3444
02:19:16,450 --> 02:19:17,051
And so they'll say,
hey,

3445
02:19:17,051 --> 02:19:20,410
wait a minute,
we can create a digital alternative to

3446
02:19:20,411 --> 02:19:23,440
gold and use that.
People will just use this and people

3447
02:19:23,441 --> 02:19:25,690
will just get out of dollars and
they'll,

3448
02:19:25,750 --> 02:19:29,540
they'll own bitcoin and then we'll just
use bitcoin as money.

3449
02:19:29,570 --> 02:19:30,160
Right?
And that,

3450
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:35,160
and the idea is this is going to happen,
but it can't happen because there is no

3451
02:19:35,271 --> 02:19:39,080
value that ultimately bitcoin has that
can be stored right.

3452
02:19:39,410 --> 02:19:41,780
It,
because unlike gold gold actually has

3453
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:42,980
properties that,
that,

3454
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:44,750
you know,
you can use gold for all sorts of

3455
02:19:44,751 --> 02:19:47,000
things.
People value gold for the metal.

3456
02:19:47,570 --> 02:19:52,250
Nobody values bitcoin for the bitcoin.
They value it because they believe that

3457
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:55,520
they can exchange it for something else.
There's dollar doesn't really represent

3458
02:19:55,521 --> 02:19:57,200
golden anymore.
I know it doesn't,

3459
02:19:57,410 --> 02:20:02,270
but just because the dollar is working
as money with all the history of usage

3460
02:20:02,271 --> 02:20:04,490
and the fact that the government except
dollars,

3461
02:20:04,491 --> 02:20:07,370
his taxes,
it's legal tender that you have

3462
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:10,160
insurance products,
that you have rental agreements that you

3463
02:20:10,161 --> 02:20:13,460
have bonds.
You have an entire global market in in

3464
02:20:13,461 --> 02:20:14,294
dollars,
right?

3465
02:20:14,330 --> 02:20:17,690
That is never going to be able to
develop with bitcoin or any other

3466
02:20:17,691 --> 02:20:19,180
cryptocurrency.
Uh,

3467
02:20:19,190 --> 02:20:21,740
ultimately the value of,
of,

3468
02:20:21,741 --> 02:20:23,900
of,
of a cryptocurrency is,

3469
02:20:23,901 --> 02:20:27,380
is based on the willingness of somebody
else to accept it and exchange for,

3470
02:20:27,500 --> 02:20:28,520
you know,
for something else.

3471
02:20:28,820 --> 02:20:32,780
And you know,
when bitcoin first started and people

3472
02:20:32,781 --> 02:20:33,980
used to tell me,
well,

3473
02:20:33,981 --> 02:20:36,230
you know,
there's only 21 million bitcoins,

3474
02:20:36,231 --> 02:20:37,760
right?
You can't have any more than that.

3475
02:20:37,850 --> 02:20:41,570
So therefore there's some scarcity.
But my point was that,

3476
02:20:41,571 --> 02:20:43,340
well,
but what stops somebody else from

3477
02:20:43,341 --> 02:20:47,790
creating another cryptocurrency that is
identical to bitcoin?

3478
02:20:47,810 --> 02:20:50,030
Or maybe it's even better.
Maybe it's faster.

3479
02:20:50,150 --> 02:20:53,620
Maybe it has properties that maybe it
improves on big.

3480
02:20:53,660 --> 02:20:55,490
Just like we talked about cell phones
earlier,

3481
02:20:55,610 --> 02:20:57,620
somebody bakes a better cell phone.
What's your,

3482
02:20:57,770 --> 02:21:01,850
what's your old Motorola phone worth
today is nothing,

3483
02:21:01,950 --> 02:21:03,890
right?
So if somebody comes up with a better

3484
02:21:03,960 --> 02:21:06,260
cryptocurrency and then what's your
bitcoin worth?

3485
02:21:06,350 --> 02:21:08,090
But you know,
I don't think any of these,

3486
02:21:08,091 --> 02:21:09,410
you know,
you have like a thousand of them.

3487
02:21:09,411 --> 02:21:12,020
Now.
The market cap is about 150 billion for

3488
02:21:12,021 --> 02:21:14,480
all these cryptocurrencies and now there
are people that are saying,

3489
02:21:14,481 --> 02:21:15,590
look,
you got to buy a bunch of them.

3490
02:21:15,590 --> 02:21:17,480
You need a portfolio because she,
you know,

3491
02:21:17,481 --> 02:21:19,250
you're not sure which one is going to
win.

3492
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:22,460
None of them are going to win.
They're all going to lose because none

3493
02:21:22,461 --> 02:21:26,090
of them are going to work because they,
they're there and there's no store of

3494
02:21:26,091 --> 02:21:26,661
value.
You know,

3495
02:21:26,661 --> 02:21:31,661
your people are not using bitcoins and
nor will they ever use bitcoins as a

3496
02:21:31,671 --> 02:21:34,580
real medium of exchange.
People use it as a speculative asset.

3497
02:21:34,581 --> 02:21:37,130
People buy it,
they hope it's going to go up in value.

3498
02:21:37,490 --> 02:21:39,680
Yes.
Can you sell your bitcoins and then buy

3499
02:21:39,681 --> 02:21:41,480
something with the money?
Yes.

3500
02:21:41,481 --> 02:21:43,190
Do you could do that with any asset.
You know,

3501
02:21:43,191 --> 02:21:46,460
people make a big deal about the fact
that my gold company shift gold.

3502
02:21:46,940 --> 02:21:47,870
We accept,
we say,

3503
02:21:47,871 --> 02:21:48,860
oh,
we accept bitcoin.

3504
02:21:49,130 --> 02:21:51,110
We don't really accept Bitcoin,
right?

3505
02:21:51,111 --> 02:21:55,190
What we accept is dollars,
but we make it easy for people to sell

3506
02:21:55,191 --> 02:21:59,570
their bitcoins to buy dollars by using a
service called a bit pay,

3507
02:22:00,020 --> 02:22:02,750
but they're not actually using,
uh,

3508
02:22:02,780 --> 02:22:03,441
they're,
they're,

3509
02:22:03,441 --> 02:22:04,274
they're,
uh,

3510
02:22:04,340 --> 02:22:05,780
they're,
they're a bitcoin.

3511
02:22:05,910 --> 02:22:08,420
They're using dollars,
they're selling their bitcoin and then

3512
02:22:08,421 --> 02:22:09,620
they're,
then they're trading dollars.

3513
02:22:09,621 --> 02:22:12,500
I mean,
for Bitcoin and be ultimately works,

3514
02:22:12,501 --> 02:22:14,270
right?
It's not going to work because I mean,

3515
02:22:14,271 --> 02:22:17,720
that is ultimately working.
You can use their bitcoin and you can

3516
02:22:17,721 --> 02:22:19,700
purchase gold with a bit.
No,

3517
02:22:19,730 --> 02:22:22,820
you can,
you can sell your bitcoin to buy dollars

3518
02:22:22,821 --> 02:22:25,640
and then you can use the dollars to buy
Bitcoin,

3519
02:22:25,710 --> 02:22:27,960
which meant nothing is worth dollars.
No,

3520
02:22:27,961 --> 02:22:28,800
no.
You sold it.

3521
02:22:28,801 --> 02:22:29,660
You sold your ass.
Look,

3522
02:22:29,670 --> 02:22:32,440
I,
you sold nothing to get dollars and he'd

3523
02:22:32,441 --> 02:22:34,410
take those dollars and you buy big.
No,

3524
02:22:34,411 --> 02:22:35,970
you sold,
you sold something,

3525
02:22:35,971 --> 02:22:38,680
you sold it as the big question then.
So it's something then,

3526
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:39,660
but it's,
yes,

3527
02:22:39,690 --> 02:22:43,500
but you can sell it today for value,
but it might be worthless tomorrow.

3528
02:22:43,501 --> 02:22:44,251
I mean,
not right now.

3529
02:22:44,251 --> 02:22:46,320
It's not because somebody will pay you
for it.

3530
02:22:46,410 --> 02:22:48,510
So it's real.
It's the same thing as a share of,

3531
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:49,171
uh,
of,

3532
02:22:49,171 --> 02:22:50,070
uh,
pets.com.

3533
02:22:50,100 --> 02:22:53,010
At one point somebody would give you a
lot of money for that stock and now

3534
02:22:53,011 --> 02:22:54,300
they'll give you nothing.
You know,

3535
02:22:54,301 --> 02:22:56,040
it's all about perception.
I mean,

3536
02:22:56,130 --> 02:22:58,740
there's always value in gold.
And I hear people telling me this,

3537
02:22:58,741 --> 02:22:59,161
well,
you know,

3538
02:22:59,161 --> 02:23:00,660
gold's value is subjective.
No,

3539
02:23:00,661 --> 02:23:04,050
it's not.
It's objective gold has value because it

3540
02:23:04,051 --> 02:23:06,930
satisfies a certain,
uh,

3541
02:23:06,960 --> 02:23:09,540
desires or needs.
It has properties that exist in the

3542
02:23:09,541 --> 02:23:11,760
physical world and there are things that
you can do with it.

3543
02:23:11,970 --> 02:23:15,210
The only thing I can do with my bitcoin
is give it to somebody else.

3544
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:16,740
But I know people think,
oh,

3545
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:19,020
but the blockchain is,
is so great.

3546
02:23:19,021 --> 02:23:21,480
Maybe it is.
Maybe the blockchain is a great

3547
02:23:21,481 --> 02:23:24,600
invention and maybe over time,
a lot of assets,

3548
02:23:24,601 --> 02:23:27,420
we'll utilize the blockchain in
transactions.

3549
02:23:27,510 --> 02:23:31,080
But it doesn't mean that just because
bitcoin's utilize something of value

3550
02:23:31,230 --> 02:23:36,150
that the bitcoin itself has any value
that is going to endure to the owner of

3551
02:23:36,151 --> 02:23:37,470
that bitcoin.
Especially,

3552
02:23:37,471 --> 02:23:39,630
you know,
when there's an infinite number of

3553
02:23:39,631 --> 02:23:41,250
coins.
But here's something interesting because

3554
02:23:41,251 --> 02:23:42,960
you know,
the idea is,

3555
02:23:42,961 --> 02:23:43,794
hey,
you know,

3556
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:48,860
we need this digital gold because gold
can't be used in commerce the way

3557
02:23:49,921 --> 02:23:52,650
bitcoin can.
The irony of it is it can,

3558
02:23:52,710 --> 02:23:54,360
right?
There's a company and you know,

3559
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:57,960
uh,
it called gold money gold money.com and

3560
02:23:57,961 --> 02:23:59,970
you can go there and you can open up an
account.

3561
02:23:59,971 --> 02:24:01,200
You should,
everybody listening should go to

3562
02:24:01,201 --> 02:24:03,840
goldmoney.com uh,
you can do it on your cell phone,

3563
02:24:03,870 --> 02:24:06,600
on your APP.
And what they do is they allow you to

3564
02:24:06,601 --> 02:24:08,880
buy gold.
You can also buy silver and platinum

3565
02:24:08,881 --> 02:24:10,620
play the amount of things,
but let's just focus on gold.

3566
02:24:11,220 --> 02:24:15,330
You can buy gold.
They sell it to you for one half of 1%

3567
02:24:15,331 --> 02:24:16,590
over spot.
Very cheap.

3568
02:24:16,591 --> 02:24:18,210
I've been in the gold business my whole
life.

3569
02:24:18,211 --> 02:24:21,060
I've never sold gold that cheap.
You own the gold.

3570
02:24:21,540 --> 02:24:24,570
They will have a stored for you at,
it brings vault of your choice and you

3571
02:24:24,571 --> 02:24:28,950
have different locations in Switzerland
and Hong Kong and Singapore and Canada.

3572
02:24:28,951 --> 02:24:32,790
You can pick where you want your gold
stored and now you own that gold,

3573
02:24:32,910 --> 02:24:34,350
right?
It's in your digital wallet.

3574
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:37,140
Just like you could have your crypto
currencies in a digital wallet,

3575
02:24:37,350 --> 02:24:40,800
but the difference is you can take
deliver of that gold whenever you want

3576
02:24:40,801 --> 02:24:42,480
it.
The minimum is 10 grams of gold,

3577
02:24:42,481 --> 02:24:45,840
which is a very small quantity and they
will mail it to you if you want it.

3578
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:48,660
But the purpose of it is not to have it
mailed to you.

3579
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:49,740
You keep it in your account.

3580
02:24:49,980 --> 02:24:54,000
Now you can give that goal.
There are any portion of it to anyone

3581
02:24:54,001 --> 02:24:57,900
you want anywhere in the world for free.
I can just transfer my ownership to

3582
02:24:57,901 --> 02:25:00,510
somebody else.
So now there's commerce.

3583
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:05,540
If you are a merchant and you want to
price your product in gold,

3584
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:09,990
you can do that and I can pay for the
product using gold and you can accept

3585
02:25:09,991 --> 02:25:12,540
gold in exchange for that good or
service.

3586
02:25:12,541 --> 02:25:17,400
So it makes it so that now gold can
actually work in today's modern economy

3587
02:25:17,401 --> 02:25:20,340
through the Internet.
It's now is easy for me to spend my

3588
02:25:20,341 --> 02:25:21,990
goal.
I can use my goal to buy a cup of

3589
02:25:21,991 --> 02:25:22,950
coffee.
I could,

3590
02:25:23,110 --> 02:25:24,930
my goal to buy a car.
Right.

3591
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:28,710
So I and in the short run,
right.

3592
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:30,940
And I'll show you this car that I have
in the short run.

3593
02:25:31,690 --> 02:25:34,890
Let's assume that somebody,
is that a gold card and it's been an

3594
02:25:34,900 --> 02:25:36,360
actual gold.
It's made out of actually go.

3595
02:25:36,380 --> 02:25:37,630
Yeah.
Just real heavy.

3596
02:25:37,660 --> 02:25:40,030
Yes.
Cause gold is crazy because gold is a

3597
02:25:40,031 --> 02:25:40,660
real element.

3598
02:25:40,660 --> 02:25:42,460
You have a guy has wait,
hold credit card.

3599
02:25:42,490 --> 02:25:45,070
This is a gold mastercard.
Ladies and gentlemen.

3600
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:47,980
This is a gold money mastercard and this
is,

3601
02:25:48,130 --> 02:25:49,600
this is heavy.
Like listen.

3602
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:50,920
Yeah,
it's,

3603
02:25:50,920 --> 02:25:53,080
I mean compare that to just a plastic
one.

3604
02:25:53,470 --> 02:25:54,430
Oh,
it's crazy.

3605
02:25:54,460 --> 02:25:56,470
Yeah.
It's like a hundred of these.

3606
02:25:56,530 --> 02:25:57,670
Yes.
That is real.

3607
02:25:58,360 --> 02:26:00,530
Listen to this folks.
Yeah.

3608
02:26:00,570 --> 02:26:00,971
Yeah.
It's,

3609
02:26:00,971 --> 02:26:03,000
this is fucking gold.
Wow.

3610
02:26:03,070 --> 02:26:04,050
I need one of those in my life.

3611
02:26:04,080 --> 02:26:05,160
Well you got woke up.
We will.

3612
02:26:05,170 --> 02:26:06,600
We'll make you one.
I needed to get you one.

3613
02:26:06,630 --> 02:26:07,890
Well,
the idea is very appealing.

3614
02:26:07,930 --> 02:26:08,763
Me.
Let me finish this one.

3615
02:26:08,810 --> 02:26:09,643
This one point.
So

3616
02:26:11,370 --> 02:26:12,750
in the long run,
right,

3617
02:26:12,751 --> 02:26:15,600
I believe that we're going to go back to
a gold standard,

3618
02:26:15,601 --> 02:26:17,430
I believe,
and it's not just gold money,

3619
02:26:17,431 --> 02:26:19,410
but gold money might be the first
company to do that.

3620
02:26:19,411 --> 02:26:21,120
But there may be more that we'll do it
later on.

3621
02:26:21,420 --> 02:26:24,120
But I think that government Fiat money
does not work.

3622
02:26:24,300 --> 02:26:26,070
Dollars won't work.
Uros won't work.

3623
02:26:26,071 --> 02:26:28,170
Yen don't won't work.
But gold works.

3624
02:26:28,171 --> 02:26:32,340
Gold has worked for thousands of years,
but now with the Internet it works even

3625
02:26:32,341 --> 02:26:35,290
better.
And so I think that gold,

3626
02:26:35,450 --> 02:26:39,450
like through gold money,
gold money we'll do to Fiat currency,

3627
02:26:39,780 --> 02:26:43,980
what Fedex did to the post office,
what Uber is doing to taxi cabs,

3628
02:26:44,160 --> 02:26:46,070
it is the free markets alternative,
uh,

3629
02:26:46,260 --> 02:26:50,370
money that government can't create out
of thin air that will hold its value

3630
02:26:50,371 --> 02:26:51,210
over time.

3631
02:26:51,420 --> 02:26:52,920
And now,
thanks to the Internet,

3632
02:26:52,950 --> 02:26:54,900
we can be used in commerce.
But in the meantime,

3633
02:26:54,940 --> 02:26:57,060
right,
so I've got gold that is stored in my

3634
02:26:57,061 --> 02:26:59,910
gold money account.
But let's say I go to a merchant who

3635
02:26:59,911 --> 02:27:02,160
doesn't want gold cause he doesn't know
any better.

3636
02:27:02,190 --> 02:27:05,820
He just wants to be paid in dollars.
I can use this debit card,

3637
02:27:06,210 --> 02:27:07,680
right,
to buy something.

3638
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:10,470
And is that a debit card or credit card?
Debit card,

3639
02:27:11,590 --> 02:27:13,740
debit card.
But it's a debit card and you can't tell

3640
02:27:13,741 --> 02:27:14,281
the difference,
right?

3641
02:27:14,281 --> 02:27:19,281
But what happens is I can spend my goal
using this card so I can sell off

3642
02:27:19,561 --> 02:27:22,080
basically just like you know when people
are doing with bit pay,

3643
02:27:22,081 --> 02:27:23,370
but I don't need bitpay,
right?

3644
02:27:23,460 --> 02:27:28,460
I can go to any merchant in the world
that accepts mastercard and my gold will

3645
02:27:29,311 --> 02:27:31,920
be sold and the merchant will get
dollars,

3646
02:27:31,980 --> 02:27:32,190
right?

3647
02:27:32,190 --> 02:27:37,190
So I can spend my gold now,
but the merchant is actually not getting

3648
02:27:38,100 --> 02:27:41,040
rolled these getting dollars.
But I believe in the future the

3649
02:27:41,041 --> 02:27:42,810
merchant's going to want gold.
He's,

3650
02:27:42,900 --> 02:27:46,590
once we start to get a currency crisis,
once we see the euro and the yen blowing

3651
02:27:46,591 --> 02:27:48,690
up,
people are not going to want to sell

3652
02:27:48,691 --> 02:27:50,910
their goods and services for paper
money.

3653
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:52,800
They're going to want to sell it for
real money.

3654
02:27:52,950 --> 02:27:53,890
Now there are people think,
well,

3655
02:27:53,891 --> 02:27:56,460
they're going to want to sell it for,
for cryptocurrencies.

3656
02:27:56,461 --> 02:27:56,941
No,
they're not.

3657
02:27:56,941 --> 02:28:00,480
I think he's cryptocurrencies are going
to crash before the Fiat currencies.

3658
02:28:00,481 --> 02:28:02,970
I think they're going to make Fiat
currencies look good.

3659
02:28:02,971 --> 02:28:06,870
Which is unfortunate because you have a
lot of good people who are putting their

3660
02:28:06,871 --> 02:28:09,150
faith in these cryptocurrencies and
they're going to get burned.

3661
02:28:09,300 --> 02:28:10,680
And then the government's going to say,
you see,

3662
02:28:10,681 --> 02:28:12,990
we told you the free market isn't any
good.

3663
02:28:13,170 --> 02:28:14,460
You know,
you got to trust us.

3664
02:28:14,461 --> 02:28:16,020
You got to trust our paper money.
No,

3665
02:28:16,021 --> 02:28:19,500
I'm going to trust gold.
I want to trust the private sector and

3666
02:28:19,501 --> 02:28:22,100
if I can use gold,
why would I use anything else?

3667
02:28:22,101 --> 02:28:25,670
Now I know people say the knocked at the
bitcoin people say is that,

3668
02:28:25,671 --> 02:28:28,130
well,
it's not decentralized because somebody

3669
02:28:28,131 --> 02:28:29,990
has to store the gold.
Right?

3670
02:28:29,991 --> 02:28:30,824
Whereas nobody,
right,

3671
02:28:30,900 --> 02:28:32,930
of course,
because there's real value there.

3672
02:28:33,110 --> 02:28:36,110
But you know what brings has been
storing gold for over a hundred years

3673
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:38,390
and they've never lost an ounce.
So look,

3674
02:28:38,450 --> 02:28:42,440
I trust banks to hold my gold,
but they're holding it in a way that I

3675
02:28:42,441 --> 02:28:43,760
can spend it,
you know,

3676
02:28:43,761 --> 02:28:44,750
back in the day,
right?

3677
02:28:44,751 --> 02:28:48,620
The first currencies that existed were
created by private banks,

3678
02:28:48,740 --> 02:28:49,640
right?
Not The government.

3679
02:28:49,940 --> 02:28:52,820
And so a bank would have gold.
Or actually even before that,

3680
02:28:52,821 --> 02:28:55,010
it was the goldsmith who would have
gold,

3681
02:28:55,250 --> 02:28:57,080
you know,
that he was storing and he would write

3682
02:28:57,081 --> 02:28:58,910
an Iou and I,
you know,

3683
02:28:58,911 --> 02:29:00,020
and the person would say,
Hey,

3684
02:29:00,021 --> 02:29:03,260
I've got gold stored at this goldsmith,
that piece of paper,

3685
02:29:03,440 --> 02:29:03,800
right?

3686
02:29:03,800 --> 02:29:06,950
Instead of going back to the Goldsmith
and getting your gold,

3687
02:29:07,010 --> 02:29:08,090
you can give somebody,
say,

3688
02:29:08,091 --> 02:29:09,440
hey look,
I owe you money.

3689
02:29:09,470 --> 02:29:11,540
Take this note because the gold is
there.

3690
02:29:11,550 --> 02:29:14,600
Th you can go get it whenever you want,
but here's a piece of paper.

3691
02:29:14,601 --> 02:29:16,820
Put it in your wallet.
It entitles you to that goal.

3692
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,340
And that piece of paper could circulate
as money,

3693
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:22,700
not because it has value,
but because it's backed up by the goal.

3694
02:29:22,850 --> 02:29:26,120
And so eventually private banks started
issuing currency,

3695
02:29:26,180 --> 02:29:29,450
physical paper currency that was backed
by the goal that they had.

3696
02:29:29,720 --> 02:29:31,770
Well,
what we're having now in,

3697
02:29:31,830 --> 02:29:32,750
in,
in with gold,

3698
02:29:32,751 --> 02:29:36,020
money is gold.
Money is like the Goldsmith.

3699
02:29:36,080 --> 02:29:40,520
They're storing your gold,
but instead of giving the person that

3700
02:29:40,610 --> 02:29:44,390
the piece of paper that you can go back,
you actually get ownership.

3701
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:47,960
You actually transfer.
So if I was going to give you $100 worth

3702
02:29:47,961 --> 02:29:50,330
of gold from my gold money account to
your gold money account,

3703
02:29:50,750 --> 02:29:52,620
you're going to now have title to that
goal.

3704
02:29:52,640 --> 02:29:55,700
It's changing hands.
It's gone from me owning the golden,

3705
02:29:55,701 --> 02:29:57,860
that vault to you,
owning that exact same goal.

3706
02:29:57,890 --> 02:29:58,723
Now,
what's your goal?

3707
02:29:58,760 --> 02:30:01,490
You can do whatever you want with it.
You could take delivery of it and have

3708
02:30:01,491 --> 02:30:04,220
it in your hand or you can use it to buy
something else.

3709
02:30:04,280 --> 02:30:08,450
It's perfect money.
It's the free market money and we could

3710
02:30:08,451 --> 02:30:09,950
use it costless.
I mean,

3711
02:30:09,951 --> 02:30:12,350
it's going to be cheap.
It's cheaper than mastercard,

3712
02:30:12,351 --> 02:30:15,350
visa.
It's a very inexpensive way for people

3713
02:30:15,351 --> 02:30:18,890
to trade across borders because it
doesn't matter what country you live in.

3714
02:30:18,950 --> 02:30:22,280
Gold has value in every country.
You don't have to worry about the yen or

3715
02:30:22,281 --> 02:30:23,690
the euro or the dollar.
Hey,

3716
02:30:23,691 --> 02:30:25,580
I'm in Germany.
I want to sell my products.

3717
02:30:25,670 --> 02:30:28,340
I can price them in gold.
And Gold is not very volatile.

3718
02:30:28,400 --> 02:30:30,470
Gold as a relatively stable,
over time,

3719
02:30:30,590 --> 02:30:34,640
you can actually price a product and get
paid in gold and you can store your gold

3720
02:30:34,760 --> 02:30:36,050
and a year later,
two years later,

3721
02:30:36,051 --> 02:30:36,330
you know what?

3722
02:30:36,330 --> 02:30:39,150
It's going to have value.
Or You could look at the historic,

3723
02:30:39,180 --> 02:30:40,370
uh,
a value of gold.

3724
02:30:40,550 --> 02:30:43,430
So rather than trying to reinvent the
wheel,

3725
02:30:43,490 --> 02:30:44,540
you know,
they used to have something,

3726
02:30:44,570 --> 02:30:45,830
they call it alchemy.
You know,

3727
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:47,570
it's hundreds of years ago.
Uh,

3728
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:50,780
the alchemists tried to make gold at a
base metal and they couldn't do it.

3729
02:30:50,990 --> 02:30:53,990
I look at these cryptocurrencies as
modern day alchemy.

3730
02:30:54,260 --> 02:30:58,220
They're trying to digitally recreate
gold and they're not going to succeed.

3731
02:30:58,400 --> 02:31:01,460
They're just creating digital Fiat.
This is fool's gold.

3732
02:31:01,580 --> 02:31:03,560
Yes,
people have made money speculating on

3733
02:31:03,561 --> 02:31:05,480
other people's ignorance and other
people's greed,

3734
02:31:05,780 --> 02:31:08,600
but it's going to end very badly.
But I do believe that,

3735
02:31:08,690 --> 02:31:10,220
you know,
what they're doing to gold money and

3736
02:31:10,221 --> 02:31:13,760
what the Internet is enabling is that we
can have real money.

3737
02:31:13,790 --> 02:31:16,390
We can use gold.
Now in a way that you know,

3738
02:31:16,550 --> 02:31:21,180
our forefathers never could.
This is a real modern day gold standard

3739
02:31:21,181 --> 02:31:22,350
2.0 gold.

3740
02:31:22,350 --> 02:31:25,620
Woolworth worked better as money today
than it's ever worked before,

3741
02:31:25,621 --> 02:31:27,090
and it worked great in the past.
I mean,

3742
02:31:27,091 --> 02:31:30,210
we thrived.
America was built on a gold standard.

3743
02:31:30,360 --> 02:31:33,480
The industrial revolution happened on a
gold standard.

3744
02:31:33,481 --> 02:31:37,560
We produced a wealthiest country the
world had ever seen on a gold standard,

3745
02:31:37,650 --> 02:31:38,910
right?
We've become broke,

3746
02:31:39,150 --> 02:31:40,440
right?
With his Fiat's standard.

3747
02:31:40,441 --> 02:31:43,680
We've squandered the wealth that we
created under a gold standard.

3748
02:31:43,681 --> 02:31:44,910
But this is a way,
you know,

3749
02:31:44,911 --> 02:31:48,600
when Nixon took us off the gold standard
in 1971 he said it was temporary,

3750
02:31:48,930 --> 02:31:49,763
right?
Well,

3751
02:31:49,800 --> 02:31:52,710
we don't have to wait for the government
to bring us back to a gold center.

3752
02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:53,880
You could do it on your own,
right?

3753
02:31:53,881 --> 02:31:56,520
You can put yourself,
people can now move to a gold standard.

3754
02:31:56,700 --> 02:32:00,060
You can earn a companies can pay their
employees using gold money.

3755
02:32:00,061 --> 02:32:03,180
They could pay him and gold people,
landlords can collect rent and gold.

3756
02:32:03,180 --> 02:32:05,340
I mean,
I hope we can have an entire society.

3757
02:32:05,570 --> 02:32:07,440
You know?
Right now we're being sidetracked by

3758
02:32:07,441 --> 02:32:08,970
this,
by this bubble in the,

3759
02:32:08,971 --> 02:32:11,160
in the cryptocurrencies.
But the people who are buying these

3760
02:32:11,161 --> 02:32:14,940
cryptocurrencies should be buying gold.
And of course what they can do now is,

3761
02:32:14,941 --> 02:32:16,170
you know,
if you happen to have some

3762
02:32:16,171 --> 02:32:17,610
cryptocurrency,
you can sell them,

3763
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:19,410
you can go to gold money,
they'll take your,

3764
02:32:19,590 --> 02:32:24,180
they'll let you convert your bitcoins
are all coins or whatever,

3765
02:32:24,181 --> 02:32:25,260
whatever you got,
you know,

3766
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:27,300
ether,
whatever crypto you can go and you

3767
02:32:27,301 --> 02:32:29,370
convert it and you can buy real money.
Right.

3768
02:32:29,371 --> 02:32:30,930
And then when this bubble pops,
you know,

3769
02:32:30,931 --> 02:32:31,764
you're,
you're,

3770
02:32:31,920 --> 02:32:32,431
you're,
you know,

3771
02:32:32,431 --> 02:32:35,100
you're not left holding the bag.
Cause a lot of people I think

3772
02:32:35,101 --> 02:32:38,880
unfortunately are going to end up losing
a lot of their real,

3773
02:32:39,030 --> 02:32:40,230
their money,
their purchasing power.

3774
02:32:40,231 --> 02:32:42,540
They could have bought gold,
but instead they bought,

3775
02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:44,420
you know,
pets.com and they,

3776
02:32:44,421 --> 02:32:46,080
and they didn't,
they didn't realize that that's what

3777
02:32:46,081 --> 02:32:47,430
they would,
what they were buying.

3778
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:50,450
I'm sold Peter Schiff.
I love the car.

3779
02:32:50,451 --> 02:32:51,930
If you just get people to hold on to
that.

3780
02:32:51,980 --> 02:32:53,820
Yeah.
But I mean in their hand was like this

3781
02:32:53,821 --> 02:32:54,840
is a real thing.
Yeah.

3782
02:32:54,841 --> 02:32:56,520
I mean,
and always complained about the loss of

3783
02:32:56,521 --> 02:32:57,630
the gold standard.
I mean,

3784
02:32:57,631 --> 02:32:59,820
that was,
that's a longstanding complaint.

3785
02:32:59,880 --> 02:33:01,860
You go back to the constitution,
right?

3786
02:33:01,890 --> 02:33:03,450
Gold is money.
In the constitution.

3787
02:33:03,451 --> 02:33:06,570
It says that no state shall make
anything but gold and silver coin,

3788
02:33:06,571 --> 02:33:09,750
legal tender payment of debt.
The federal government is only given the

3789
02:33:09,751 --> 02:33:12,060
power to coin money.
What are they coining?

3790
02:33:12,200 --> 02:33:14,490
Gold and silver.
I mean that that is,

3791
02:33:14,610 --> 02:33:16,620
is the standard that you know,
we have,

3792
02:33:16,621 --> 02:33:18,450
you know,
the first time we mentioned the civil

3793
02:33:18,450 --> 02:33:20,400
war,
the first time we ever had paper money

3794
02:33:20,430 --> 02:33:23,060
in America was during the civil war and
the,

3795
02:33:23,061 --> 02:33:24,660
the union issued it,
but it was,

3796
02:33:24,661 --> 02:33:25,520
it was the greenback.

3797
02:33:25,560 --> 02:33:28,350
It was backed by gold and when the war
ended,

3798
02:33:28,410 --> 02:33:32,160
they stopped issuing them,
but they issued it based on an emergency

3799
02:33:32,161 --> 02:33:34,950
wartime power.
It wasn't that they had the right to do

3800
02:33:34,951 --> 02:33:36,420
it legally.
They said,

3801
02:33:36,421 --> 02:33:37,350
look,
it's a war.

3802
02:33:37,380 --> 02:33:40,380
We need to win this war.
And so that's the first time we had

3803
02:33:40,381 --> 02:33:41,790
paper money.
Then it went away.

3804
02:33:41,820 --> 02:33:44,850
It didn't come back again until 1913
with the Federal Reserve.

3805
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,100
Is it really possible that this can make
a return?

3806
02:33:47,490 --> 02:33:49,680
What can,
that gold standard can actually be

3807
02:33:49,681 --> 02:33:52,830
something that we all go off and I am
convinced that we're going back to a

3808
02:33:52,831 --> 02:33:55,410
gold standard,
but I think the free market will lead

3809
02:33:55,411 --> 02:33:58,620
the way because if people start
rejecting government money,

3810
02:33:58,860 --> 02:34:00,840
right?
If they start rejecting the dollar,

3811
02:34:00,960 --> 02:34:02,100
if they reject it,
Europe,

3812
02:34:02,101 --> 02:34:04,140
they reject again.
Then what does the governor going to do?

3813
02:34:04,141 --> 02:34:06,000
I mean,
the source of the government's power

3814
02:34:06,001 --> 02:34:07,290
really is the money they spent.

3815
02:34:07,290 --> 02:34:09,540
That's where they,
they buy their votes and they peddle

3816
02:34:09,541 --> 02:34:11,070
their influence.
But if,

3817
02:34:11,090 --> 02:34:13,620
if individuals and merchants just start
saying,

3818
02:34:13,650 --> 02:34:15,450
no,
I don't want that paper money.

3819
02:34:15,630 --> 02:34:17,710
You want to buy my products,
pay and goal,

3820
02:34:17,890 --> 02:34:19,270
right?
You want my services,

3821
02:34:19,271 --> 02:34:22,240
pay me in gold.
And if more and more people start opting

3822
02:34:22,241 --> 02:34:26,010
out of that system and just start
working in a gold back month,

3823
02:34:26,050 --> 02:34:28,390
which we know works,
but we don't need the government to make

3824
02:34:28,391 --> 02:34:30,730
gold money.
Gold was money long before the

3825
02:34:30,731 --> 02:34:32,980
government came around.
What the government did is when they

3826
02:34:32,981 --> 02:34:34,030
took over money,
right?

3827
02:34:34,031 --> 02:34:34,864
That's,
you know,

3828
02:34:34,870 --> 02:34:35,950
they,
they would debase it,

3829
02:34:35,951 --> 02:34:37,360
right?
That's where the term comes.

3830
02:34:37,361 --> 02:34:39,580
Because the government would start,
they would make gold coins and they

3831
02:34:39,581 --> 02:34:42,100
would stick copper in there.
Other metals because they would try to

3832
02:34:42,101 --> 02:34:44,350
create inflation.
But when you had private money,

3833
02:34:44,830 --> 02:34:45,580
you know,
it was,

3834
02:34:45,580 --> 02:34:46,413
it was gold.

3835
02:34:46,570 --> 02:34:50,320
And so we don't need the government.
The problem is these cryptocurrencies,

3836
02:34:50,440 --> 02:34:53,530
they're being marketed as the private
sector's alternative.

3837
02:34:53,531 --> 02:34:57,980
It's not gold is the alternative.
But we now have,

3838
02:34:58,030 --> 02:34:58,410
we,
you know,

3839
02:34:58,410 --> 02:35:01,060
we now have the method of,
of using goals,

3840
02:35:01,090 --> 02:35:01,590
right?
Cause I,

3841
02:35:01,590 --> 02:35:03,190
when I have this,
this in my wallet,

3842
02:35:03,191 --> 02:35:04,470
right?
I can carry,

3843
02:35:05,130 --> 02:35:06,450
but I can carry,
I,

3844
02:35:06,460 --> 02:35:10,210
if I have a $100,000 worth of gold,
I have $100,000 in this wallet.

3845
02:35:10,270 --> 02:35:13,660
It's here and I can use it to buy a pack
of chewing gum.

3846
02:35:13,810 --> 02:35:16,930
I could use it to buy a flat screen TV.
I can use it to buy a car.

3847
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:19,090
Right?
So I can buy tiny things with it.

3848
02:35:19,270 --> 02:35:21,670
I could buy expensive things with it.
And here it is.

3849
02:35:21,760 --> 02:35:23,140
I'm carrying it around,
right.

3850
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:24,700
And I can use it through my,
my,

3851
02:35:24,720 --> 02:35:25,240
my,
my,

3852
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:28,270
my cell phone.
I could take my cell phone and pay for

3853
02:35:28,271 --> 02:35:33,271
stuff and ownership of my gold will
instantly transfer to a third party.

3854
02:35:33,730 --> 02:35:36,550
And of course if you want to gift money,
if I want to give money to my kids,

3855
02:35:36,551 --> 02:35:38,380
I can give them gold,
then they can spend it,

3856
02:35:38,830 --> 02:35:40,450
right?
They can spend that using their debit

3857
02:35:40,451 --> 02:35:43,060
card or they can directly spend it.
So this is the real ultra,

3858
02:35:43,090 --> 02:35:45,820
this is what these cryptocurrencies are
promising to be.

3859
02:35:45,821 --> 02:35:48,490
But they never will be.
But I think a lot of people are getting

3860
02:35:48,491 --> 02:35:49,920
greedy.
A lot of people think,

3861
02:35:49,921 --> 02:35:51,820
oh,
these things are going to be worth $1

3862
02:35:51,820 --> 02:35:54,160
million a piece and you know,
pie in the sky.

3863
02:35:54,161 --> 02:35:58,060
And it's like that greed overwhelms them
and they can't think rationally.

3864
02:35:58,270 --> 02:35:59,950
You know,
in anybody that doesn't agree with them,

3865
02:35:59,951 --> 02:36:02,890
doesn't get it.
And I had the same mentality,

3866
02:36:03,430 --> 02:36:06,340
permeates every bubble.
People can't think rationally.

3867
02:36:06,490 --> 02:36:08,590
And you know,
as the price goes up,

3868
02:36:08,591 --> 02:36:11,620
you just become more emboldened in what
you believe because you're getting

3869
02:36:11,621 --> 02:36:13,990
rewarded by the market for your mistake.

3870
02:36:14,050 --> 02:36:16,570
But you don't think it's a mistake
because you're getting rich and you're

3871
02:36:16,571 --> 02:36:18,190
looking at people like me.
Hey,

3872
02:36:18,191 --> 02:36:18,571
look,
y'all,

3873
02:36:18,571 --> 02:36:19,550
you know Peter,
he's not buying.

3874
02:36:19,551 --> 02:36:20,950
You.
Look at all the money he's not making.

3875
02:36:20,951 --> 02:36:22,420
He's a fool.
He should be buying these

3876
02:36:22,421 --> 02:36:25,270
cryptocurrencies so you know there's a,
there's an old expression to don't

3877
02:36:25,271 --> 02:36:28,960
confuse brains with a bull market.
There's certainly a bull market in

3878
02:36:28,961 --> 02:36:30,790
cryptocurrencies.
I think it's a bubble,

3879
02:36:31,150 --> 02:36:32,830
and I think that people who are making
money,

3880
02:36:33,010 --> 02:36:34,630
some of them are going to get lucky,
right?

3881
02:36:34,720 --> 02:36:37,450
Some people are going to cash out and
they're going to make money,

3882
02:36:38,020 --> 02:36:41,560
but the money that people make is going
to match the money that people lose

3883
02:36:41,561 --> 02:36:43,750
because you're going to have a lot of
people who are going to come in late to

3884
02:36:43,751 --> 02:36:45,940
the party.
They're going to buy and they're going

3885
02:36:45,941 --> 02:36:46,990
to be left holding the bag.

3886
02:36:47,170 --> 02:36:47,681
Now,
of course,

3887
02:36:47,681 --> 02:36:49,900
there's going to be a lot of losses that
aren't real money.

3888
02:36:49,930 --> 02:36:54,100
Let's say somebody bought bitcoin few
years ago and they paid $1,000 and now

3889
02:36:54,101 --> 02:36:57,820
it's worth 100,000 but they haven't sold
because they think it's going to 10

3890
02:36:57,820 --> 02:36:58,600
million,
right?

3891
02:36:58,600 --> 02:37:01,750
If it goes to zero,
all they lost was a thousand right?

3892
02:37:01,780 --> 02:37:06,400
Even though it was worth 100,000 but
mentally they lost a lot more because

3893
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:09,380
they thought they had all this money,
right?

3894
02:37:09,550 --> 02:37:13,060
And mentally they got used to have ela
and it's going to be even more so

3895
02:37:13,061 --> 02:37:15,590
there's going to be a lot of dreams that
are going to shattered,

3896
02:37:15,591 --> 02:37:17,710
right?
Cause a lot of paper profits are going

3897
02:37:17,711 --> 02:37:20,480
to just go to money heaven because
they're just not going to be there.

3898
02:37:20,690 --> 02:37:24,260
But ultimately the only real money
that's going to be made is by the people

3899
02:37:24,261 --> 02:37:26,480
who cash out.
Cause because this is just a,

3900
02:37:26,481 --> 02:37:28,610
you know,
a self generating Ponzi scheme.

3901
02:37:28,610 --> 02:37:31,070
It's all about you know,
needing new people.

3902
02:37:31,160 --> 02:37:33,740
And that's why I think a lot of the
people into the cryptocurrencies,

3903
02:37:33,741 --> 02:37:37,490
they get so upset when somebody like me
doesn't get it because they need more

3904
02:37:37,491 --> 02:37:39,140
people.
They need a bigger market,

3905
02:37:39,260 --> 02:37:42,890
they need more buyers.
To come in to keep paying a higher price

3906
02:37:42,891 --> 02:37:45,980
to keep it all going.
And so if somebody comes out and cause,

3907
02:37:46,300 --> 02:37:48,080
you know,
say the emperor has no clothes,

3908
02:37:48,590 --> 02:37:50,480
you know,
because if a lot of people decided they

3909
02:37:50,481 --> 02:37:53,630
wanted to sell their cryptocurrencies,
the price would collapse.

3910
02:37:53,631 --> 02:37:54,800
And then what would happen?
I mean,

3911
02:37:54,801 --> 02:37:58,010
what happens if bitcoin goes from 4,000
to 1000,

3912
02:37:58,070 --> 02:38:00,410
how do you now make an argument that
it's money?

3913
02:38:00,530 --> 02:38:02,780
How do you,
how do you console the people that

3914
02:38:02,781 --> 02:38:07,220
bought it at 4,000 and now it's at 1000
and then what if it goes to 100 and then

3915
02:38:07,221 --> 02:38:08,240
what if it goes to zero?

3916
02:38:08,480 --> 02:38:08,931
Now,
you know,

3917
02:38:08,931 --> 02:38:12,320
there was a time bitcoin went up to a
thousand and then it went down to 200

3918
02:38:12,710 --> 02:38:14,660
and then it rallied.
So now people are convinced,

3919
02:38:14,670 --> 02:38:15,920
okay,
well if it sells off,

3920
02:38:15,921 --> 02:38:17,780
it's just going to rally back.
What if it doesn't?

3921
02:38:18,260 --> 02:38:19,370
It doesn't,
it doesn't have to come.

3922
02:38:19,371 --> 02:38:22,280
They can keep on falling.
Especially since there's so many,

3923
02:38:22,630 --> 02:38:25,730
uh,
cryptocurrencies now that compete with

3924
02:38:25,731 --> 02:38:26,421
Bitcoin,
right?

3925
02:38:26,421 --> 02:38:26,961
I,
I've said,

3926
02:38:26,961 --> 02:38:29,930
you know,
how many people search on,

3927
02:38:29,931 --> 02:38:31,670
uh,
on yahoo versus Google?

3928
02:38:31,700 --> 02:38:34,340
I mean,
yahoo was before Google or how many

3929
02:38:34,341 --> 02:38:36,200
people are on my space today,
right?

3930
02:38:36,201 --> 02:38:37,034
I mean,
you know,

3931
02:38:37,060 --> 02:38:38,210
no,
people aren't on facebook.

3932
02:38:38,211 --> 02:38:39,740
So how do you know that,
that uh,

3933
02:38:40,040 --> 02:38:44,090
that bitcoin isn't the,
the myspace of cryptocurrencies.

3934
02:38:44,091 --> 02:38:45,650
But again,
I don't think any of these

3935
02:38:45,651 --> 02:38:48,530
cryptocurrencies will work,
but I do think they will work at,

3936
02:38:48,531 --> 02:38:49,610
they backed them by gold.

3937
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:51,920
You can have a cryptocurrency backed by
gold.

3938
02:38:52,040 --> 02:38:55,220
The only problem there is the government
won't like that because that'll work so

3939
02:38:55,221 --> 02:38:57,050
well that the government will shut it
down.

3940
02:38:57,051 --> 02:38:59,150
The government will go.
And so that's why like how will they

3941
02:38:59,151 --> 02:39:00,050
shut it down?
Well,

3942
02:39:00,051 --> 02:39:02,240
they might say there's money laundering
going on,

3943
02:39:02,600 --> 02:39:04,100
you know,
but that's why gold money,

3944
02:39:04,101 --> 02:39:06,110
see gold money does all the know your
customer.

3945
02:39:06,111 --> 02:39:09,470
They know all the k you kyc.
So when you open up a gold money account

3946
02:39:09,830 --> 02:39:12,950
and you own physical gold,
they do make sure they get your photo

3947
02:39:12,951 --> 02:39:14,960
id.
They get all this information on you.

3948
02:39:15,140 --> 02:39:16,430
So they're,
they're d,

3949
02:39:16,500 --> 02:39:18,710
they're complying with government rules
and regulations.

3950
02:39:18,711 --> 02:39:19,820
So there's no,
there's no,

3951
02:39:19,880 --> 02:39:21,890
nobody's extorting money using gold
money.

3952
02:39:21,891 --> 02:39:23,660
There's no criminals.
I mean that is where,

3953
02:39:23,661 --> 02:39:24,170
and I've,
you know,

3954
02:39:24,170 --> 02:39:26,660
people have argued in the,
I've pointed out that yes,

3955
02:39:26,780 --> 02:39:31,780
the one place that bitcoin seem to be
used as money is in crime,

3956
02:39:31,851 --> 02:39:32,000
right?

3957
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:35,870
If I was going to blackmail you and I
was going to threaten to shut down your

3958
02:39:35,871 --> 02:39:38,390
podcast,
unless you send me some money,

3959
02:39:38,660 --> 02:39:42,560
I can demand payment in bitcoin.
And the reason I'm doing that is because

3960
02:39:42,561 --> 02:39:44,360
of the anonymity.
I think that,

3961
02:39:44,361 --> 02:39:46,520
you know,
I can get away with the crime and I

3962
02:39:46,521 --> 02:39:50,570
don't care if the bitcoin loses 20% of
its value between the time you give it

3963
02:39:50,571 --> 02:39:54,200
to me at the time I cash it in because
criminals are used to paying to launder

3964
02:39:54,201 --> 02:39:56,180
their money.
They just want whatever they get is

3965
02:39:56,181 --> 02:39:57,410
gravy.
But you know,

3966
02:39:57,411 --> 02:39:59,990
if I'm a merchant and I'm selling,
I sell gold,

3967
02:40:00,020 --> 02:40:02,320
right?
I sell gold and my margin and my gold

3968
02:40:02,321 --> 02:40:07,321
business is about 1% so if I sell gold
for $10,000 I bought it for 990 right?

3969
02:40:09,201 --> 02:40:12,830
I have a little bit of profit.
I can't afford to do that business in.

3970
02:40:13,260 --> 02:40:16,680
I mean the bitcoin can move 2% I wiped
out all my profit and I've lost money.

3971
02:40:16,890 --> 02:40:19,920
I need something that is very stable.
But if I'm a criminal,

3972
02:40:19,921 --> 02:40:23,370
just extorting money doesn't matter.
So it can work for criminals,

3973
02:40:23,371 --> 02:40:25,560
but that's where the governments could
crack down on it.

3974
02:40:25,770 --> 02:40:27,180
All right.
I gotta I gotta wrap this up.

3975
02:40:27,300 --> 02:40:30,060
So if people wanted to get involved in
this,

3976
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:32,810
what would be the best resource for them
to get information?

3977
02:40:32,830 --> 02:40:33,990
How to get started?
Well,

3978
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:37,980
they should go to the website,
goldmoney.com just open up an account

3979
02:40:37,981 --> 02:40:40,020
online.
And the beauty of this is to,

3980
02:40:40,021 --> 02:40:43,530
and you could do this yourself,
they have a referral program that as you

3981
02:40:43,531 --> 02:40:45,510
refer people,
you send them your own link.

3982
02:40:45,511 --> 02:40:47,760
So once you open up your gold money
account,

3983
02:40:47,910 --> 02:40:50,400
you get a referral link and now you can
send it to your friend.

3984
02:40:50,401 --> 02:40:52,770
And now if they open up an account,
you get some free gold.

3985
02:40:53,010 --> 02:40:54,980
So you actually get paid.
And,

3986
02:40:55,080 --> 02:40:57,630
and,
and so as you educate people,

3987
02:40:57,660 --> 02:41:01,650
it's kind of like a marketing.
But they will compensate you in an extra

3988
02:41:01,651 --> 02:41:02,700
goal.
And so,

3989
02:41:02,701 --> 02:41:04,980
and when you open up your account,
they'll give you a little free gold.

3990
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:08,640
You get a little free gold for referring
somebody to sponsor it on this podcast.

3991
02:41:08,641 --> 02:41:10,280
You should be a little bit of free
google.

3992
02:41:10,320 --> 02:41:11,330
Yes you can.
I mean,

3993
02:41:11,340 --> 02:41:13,400
in fact the number of people that you
have on the podcast,

3994
02:41:13,470 --> 02:41:16,550
you can get a lot of free goals.
It seems like you could have a big ad,

3995
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:21,000
like our whole podcast was a big,
a big fake ad for Frigo.

3996
02:41:21,030 --> 02:41:21,810
Yeah,
well it's,

3997
02:41:21,810 --> 02:41:24,240
well,
it's really for the concepts of freedom.

3998
02:41:24,241 --> 02:41:26,190
Gold is economic freedom,
right?

3999
02:41:26,191 --> 02:41:28,980
I mean that's like even Alan Greenspan,
that was the title of his essay.

4000
02:41:28,981 --> 02:41:31,350
Gold and economic freedom.
But it is,

4001
02:41:31,530 --> 02:41:35,070
and you know,
the more people that we can move into

4002
02:41:35,071 --> 02:41:38,760
their own personal gold standard,
the more people that can save in gold.

4003
02:41:38,760 --> 02:41:40,290
And the beauty of like a gold money
account.

4004
02:41:40,291 --> 02:41:42,660
You have your money in a bank account.
What if the bank fails?

4005
02:41:42,950 --> 02:41:44,550
You know,
this money is banked.

4006
02:41:44,551 --> 02:41:46,080
Your gold is bank,
but you own it.

4007
02:41:46,081 --> 02:41:50,130
It's not being loaned out to anybody.
It's in a storage facility with your

4008
02:41:50,131 --> 02:41:52,260
name by breaks.
So you can spend it.

4009
02:41:52,261 --> 02:41:53,700
When you put your money in a bank
account,

4010
02:41:53,701 --> 02:41:56,880
they loan it out to somebody you know.
And you know there's government

4011
02:41:56,881 --> 02:41:57,930
insurance,
but so what?

4012
02:41:57,931 --> 02:41:59,340
They just have to print a bunch of
money.

4013
02:41:59,590 --> 02:42:03,600
You're,
you can bank your gold without having to

4014
02:42:03,690 --> 02:42:06,390
put it into the banking system.
There's no bail ins that you have to

4015
02:42:06,391 --> 02:42:07,920
worry about.
Or Bank failures.

4016
02:42:08,040 --> 02:42:10,500
You don't have to worry about inflation.
It doesn't matter how much money the

4017
02:42:10,501 --> 02:42:12,330
government prints,
they're not mining any gold.

4018
02:42:12,570 --> 02:42:15,900
Gold is going to maintain its value.
So to the extent that you don't spend it

4019
02:42:15,901 --> 02:42:18,090
right away,
it's going to gain value between the

4020
02:42:18,091 --> 02:42:22,770
time you deposited or the time you earn
it and the time you go to spend it.

4021
02:42:22,770 --> 02:42:25,890
So it's a great store of value.
But thanks to the Internet,

4022
02:42:25,920 --> 02:42:29,160
it is the best medium of exchange.
It's cause it's so easy now to do it so

4023
02:42:29,310 --> 02:42:30,121
you can get out.
You know,

4024
02:42:30,121 --> 02:42:32,220
you could promote it.
The people that listen to the podcast.

4025
02:42:32,221 --> 02:42:32,850
I mean,
and again,

4026
02:42:32,850 --> 02:42:34,020
there are other people that say,
oh Peter,

4027
02:42:34,021 --> 02:42:36,510
you know,
you don't like bitcoin because you,

4028
02:42:36,540 --> 02:42:38,430
you're promoting gold money that,
you know,

4029
02:42:38,570 --> 02:42:40,920
I,
if I thought bitcoin was going to work,

4030
02:42:40,921 --> 02:42:42,570
believe me,
I'd have been all over it.

4031
02:42:42,630 --> 02:42:43,463
Right?
I mean,

4032
02:42:43,470 --> 02:42:47,970
I have a person,
a very high principles and standards.

4033
02:42:48,010 --> 02:42:50,250
You know,
I started selling gold long before I had

4034
02:42:50,251 --> 02:42:52,770
a gold company.
I used to tell my brokerage accounts at

4035
02:42:52,771 --> 02:42:54,020
your Pacific capital.
I would tell them,

4036
02:42:54,021 --> 02:42:55,680
look by some gold and I would just send
them,

4037
02:42:55,940 --> 02:42:57,300
does it go buy it?
I didn't sell it.

4038
02:42:57,301 --> 02:43:00,180
And the money that they use to buy gold
was money I couldn't manage.

4039
02:43:00,330 --> 02:43:02,970
You know,
I'd make money managing money for fee or

4040
02:43:03,030 --> 02:43:04,890
commissions.
And if people took their money and

4041
02:43:04,891 --> 02:43:06,210
bought gold,
I wasn't making any money,

4042
02:43:06,211 --> 02:43:08,490
but I thought they should buy it because
it was the right thing to do.

4043
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,010
And I got involved with gold money
because I,

4044
02:43:11,320 --> 02:43:12,250
that they were onto something.

4045
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:14,140
I thought that they were doing something
big.

4046
02:43:14,141 --> 02:43:17,380
It's more than just about money.
It's about a crusade to take back our

4047
02:43:17,381 --> 02:43:18,810
freedom,
which I think Berlin,

4048
02:43:19,020 --> 02:43:21,670
uh,
begins with money taking the power away

4049
02:43:21,671 --> 02:43:24,490
from government is rejecting the source
of that power,

4050
02:43:24,491 --> 02:43:26,800
which is the money they spend to corrupt
the economy.

4051
02:43:26,920 --> 02:43:28,720
So to the extent that more and more
people,

4052
02:43:28,750 --> 02:43:30,160
I mean,
this is the most important vote.

4053
02:43:30,370 --> 02:43:31,680
It doesn't matter who you vote for in
the,

4054
02:43:31,681 --> 02:43:34,390
in an election,
vote with your feet on the money,

4055
02:43:34,660 --> 02:43:38,740
vote away from the Fiat based system and
vote in favor of goal.

4056
02:43:38,830 --> 02:43:39,401
Right?
That's the,

4057
02:43:39,401 --> 02:43:41,860
that's the monetary system that our
founders believed in.

4058
02:43:42,070 --> 02:43:44,020
That's what was embodied in the
constitution.

4059
02:43:44,140 --> 02:43:46,750
And that's what worked.
And you get to that sweet car that's

4060
02:43:46,751 --> 02:43:48,790
made an actual,
the sweet card feel good.

4061
02:43:48,791 --> 02:43:49,481
Yes,
you get,

4062
02:43:49,481 --> 02:43:51,520
you can get a plastic card for free.
Oh,

4063
02:43:51,521 --> 02:43:54,190
I want that.
But you have to pay for the gold card.

4064
02:43:54,220 --> 02:43:56,410
But the beauty of it is it's worth its
weight in gold.

4065
02:43:56,530 --> 02:43:58,990
So even though you have to pay for it,
you own that gold.

4066
02:43:59,050 --> 02:43:59,890
It's worth it.
Yes,

4067
02:43:59,891 --> 02:44:01,780
because it's actual gold.
You can melt it down.

4068
02:44:01,781 --> 02:44:03,010
It's good to have.
Yes.

4069
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:05,110
I mean you need to have one in my life.
People have,

4070
02:44:05,150 --> 02:44:06,550
people have to understand who you want
to.

4071
02:44:06,560 --> 02:44:08,230
You want to let me hold it one more
time.

4072
02:44:10,470 --> 02:44:11,620
One a hold of Jamie.
Yeah,

4073
02:44:12,110 --> 02:44:14,350
I feel that.
Feel that there's not that many people

4074
02:44:14,351 --> 02:44:17,630
that have those,
but feel that that feels legit.

4075
02:44:17,650 --> 02:44:19,780
Doesn't it actually better than a black
card?

4076
02:44:20,070 --> 02:44:20,903
Wait,
yes.

4077
02:44:21,250 --> 02:44:23,260
Way better than black.
And you know what an Asshole,

4078
02:44:23,350 --> 02:44:25,390
they actually have all the cost shares,
you know,

4079
02:44:25,391 --> 02:44:26,440
they,
they sign up to,

4080
02:44:26,441 --> 02:44:30,190
you can get all those benefits to oh,
like to chant with American Express,

4081
02:44:30,191 --> 02:44:33,480
they sign you as yes,
they have the cost shares.

4082
02:44:33,490 --> 02:44:36,070
They have all those programs.
So you don't give that stuff up.

4083
02:44:36,280 --> 02:44:37,990
You just have,
you just have real money,

4084
02:44:38,330 --> 02:44:39,101
you know,
behind.

4085
02:44:39,101 --> 02:44:42,130
You're just have to make sure that if
you throw it into a restaurant that,

4086
02:44:42,150 --> 02:44:43,480
that you get it back.
I like it.

4087
02:44:43,720 --> 02:44:45,700
Listen,
we're going to come back next time

4088
02:44:45,701 --> 02:44:48,760
you're here.
Hopefully this will have taken off and

4089
02:44:48,761 --> 02:44:49,300
you can,
uh,

4090
02:44:49,300 --> 02:44:51,040
you could say,
see I told you.

4091
02:44:51,070 --> 02:44:52,720
Yes.
Thank you so much,

4092
02:44:52,721 --> 02:44:56,260
man.
So it was three hours flew by.

4093
02:44:56,261 --> 02:44:57,190
I,
we started late.

4094
02:44:57,200 --> 02:44:58,450
It hasn't been three hours.
Yes,

4095
02:44:58,510 --> 02:44:59,530
we're good.
All right.

4096
02:44:59,560 --> 02:45:01,170
It was amazing.
Thank you

4097
02:45:03,220 --> 02:45:03,610
so much.
