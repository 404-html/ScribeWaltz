1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,280
I have been looking forward to this
podcast for a long time. Gentlemen,

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,060
this is a about as cool
pod get for me as a fan.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,860
This is like one of my favorite ones
because Randall Carlson and Graham Hawk

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,190
Handcock together and your new book,
magicians of the Gods,

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,000
is it out officially everywhere.
It's published on the 10th of November.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,050
Fantastic. Of the U s all
over the u s and uh, Randall,

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,650
you guys together is just
so exciting to me because a,

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,640
I know you guys spent a lot of time
together and you were working together on

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,500
just this current project.
We did a fantastic research
trip across the channel,

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,390
scap lands of Washington state,

11
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:43,680
which Randall has been walking the walk
on for decades and he just showed me the

12
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:48,660
absolute irrefutable evidence
of cataclysmic flooding
in that, in that area.

13
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:50,780
And it plays a very important
part in the book. UH,

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,030
North America was the epicenter of a
global cataclysm between twelve thousand

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,960
eight hundred and eleven
thousand six hundred years ago.

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,220
And when you see it through Randall's
eyes and you get it immediately. This,

17
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,260
this whole subject in,
you know,

18
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:07,380
since you've been on my podcast
and you've been on the podcast,

19
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:11,370
is something that comes up. I mean, I'm
not kidding, four or five times a week,

20
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,780
someone will grab me and ask me,
when is Graham coming back on again?

21
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:16,740
When's Randall coming back?

22
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:18,660
And when I tell people that you
guys are coming on together,

23
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,120
the people who start
freaking out. So, you know,

24
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:24,510
we've been saying before this that
people are taking time off work there.

25
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,470
They're having little viewing parties.
So two people out there,

26
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,060
we're just excited as you are. So,
um, tell me what's been going on.

27
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:37,010
So tell me the Washington state thing.
Tell me what you guys saw and,

28
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:40,920
and what picture evidence and,
and what was revealed.

29
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,860
I'm going to pass that
one to Randall first off.

30
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,850
Um, well we, uh, we're
basically traveling.

31
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,350
What we did was we traveled from Portland
to the twin cities and what we did was

32
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:54,450
essentially followed the,

33
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:58,090
the southern margin of the great
ice sheet for the most part.

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,840
And what we were looking at was this
evidence that the whole ice sheet had

35
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:05,890
undergone this massive
catastrophic sudden meltdown.

36
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,650
And basically what we could,

37
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,710
what we saw in the landscape was
evidence that was oceanic level currents

38
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,040
flowing off the ice sheets.
In fact, the, the, um,

39
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,900
the geologists that have been looking
at this use a term called spur drop,

40
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,090
which was originally a
contrived to, um, it's,

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,600
it's a, uh, a million
cubic meters per second.

42
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:35,110
And they originally came up with a
to talk about, or ocean currents,

43
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:37,420
like the Gulf stream and so on.
Um,

44
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:42,070
not realizing that down the road it was
actually going to be applied to currents

45
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:44,450
that were flowing over the land.
Um,

46
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,000
but that's what we were looking
at was spelled that word as it's,

47
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,140
it's named after the, uh, the
scientists that first, uh,

48
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,950
came up with the concept.

49
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,260
It's s v e r Drup spur drop.

50
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,250
It's 100 million,

51
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,750
I'm sorry, a million cubic
feet, cubic meters per second.

52
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,100
Um, whoa. Which is very
difficult to even envision,

53
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,980
but when you see it on the
landscape, I mean, for example,

54
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:15,550
there's a place called the
chemists prairie that Ronald
took me to what you see

55
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:19,420
these kind of ripples in the ground
and they look a little bit like current

56
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:23,050
ripples on the beach, you know, but
actually they are current ripples,

57
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,340
but they're 50 feet high and hundreds
and hundreds of feet long and there that

58
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:31,210
receding flood left those ripples on that,
on that landscape.

59
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,430
Then above the town of when Archie,

60
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,480
there's a gigantic boulder which
didn't come from we're Nachi.

61
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,510
It weighs 18,000 tons and it got there
in an iceberg the size of an oil tanker,

62
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,420
which grounded against that side of
the valley. The floodwaters receded,

63
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,140
the iceberg melted away and it left this
humongous boulder there and actually

64
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:51,430
there's thousands of them.

65
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,940
Thousands of these gigantic Boulder's
just scattered across the landscape of the

66
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:59,350
Pacific northwest northwest,
and it all speaks of this cataclysmic,

67
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:02,740
horrendous, humongous flood that
happened to have Sunday, 200 years ago,

68
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,410
18,000 tons to these.

69
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,520
You just threw out some giant numbers
that the the meters per second and the

70
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:12,880
eighteen thousand eighteen
thousand tons is a ton,

71
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:17,881
is 2000 to 18,000 tons is 18,000
to thousands so it's 36 million.

72
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,840
If you want, I can pull up some
emails or something of that order.

73
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:26,320
Let's just say really fucking Mig.
I made an enormous,

74
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:28,420
an enormous thing and the fact
is that there was just one,

75
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:31,310
it would be spectacular,
but there's thousands of them and,

76
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,970
and they're all just washed away by this.
When the,

77
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,450
when the ice caps suddenly melted down
and we know now that that happened

78
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:39,610
because of the impact of
several fragments of a,

79
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:44,230
of a giant comment back 12,800 years ago
released a huge flood of meltwater and

80
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:47,770
that melt water carried. It was
jostling with icebergs, huge icebergs.

81
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:53,010
And many of these icebergs had had rocks
in chain within them as Glacio glacio

82
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:57,250
ice moves, it snatches up and in
chains rock and keeps it inside.

83
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:59,320
There's a name for them.
They're called glacio radix.

84
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,680
And so they're in these icebergs and
the icebergs are jostling against each

85
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:04,000
other.
And the flood is ripped up.

86
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:07,780
Whole forest bites roots and there's mud
and there's rubble and it's rumbling in

87
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:10,270
it's, and you see it all
on the landscape up there.

88
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,040
And this is all carbon dated to this
time period. The dating is very secure.

89
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,260
Very, oh my God. If we
look here at the image now,

90
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:24,070
this is not from the catastrophic
flood we're talking about obviously.

91
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,900
But interestingly enough,

92
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:30,850
this was a hundred year flood
that happened in Georgia
back in 2004 and what we

93
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:33,140
had was a a flood plane that got uh,

94
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:37,330
over top for the first time in decades
and it left these current ripples here.

95
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,260
And I just,

96
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,090
I use this slide to show what we're
used to under scale of phenomena that we

97
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,510
would normally see this kind of
phenomenon. So this is a normal,

98
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:50,200
very large major storm.
That makes sense.

99
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:54,340
This was hurricane Ivan when it
came through in 2004. It was,

100
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,920
they referred to it as a
hundred year flood. Right? So,

101
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,700
so this is a massive storm, but it's
nothing out of the ordinary really.

102
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,270
It's just, it's rare. It's
rare. What you'll see here is,

103
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,890
you know I've got a measuring tape here.

104
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:10,880
You're going to see the wavelength
is about three inches. The amplitude,

105
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,270
the vertical height of these things
is about three quarters of an inch.

106
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,940
And so these are all,

107
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,870
what we're looking at is all dry dirt
that has sand. You said it's been rippled,

108
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:25,480
it's been carried along in swept along
in this water that was over this flood

109
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:30,220
plain, which was two feet deep, carried
along. And as the water declined it, it,

110
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,030
it deposited this sand and then
rippled it as the final stages.

111
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,530
And we're looking at this, what year?
How long after the f the storm was this?

112
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:43,520
This was a week or two after the storm
because within a month this was all all

113
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:45,770
obscured by wind and everything.

114
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,690
So now just so you've got this
by comparison, we'll go to this.

115
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:54,230
This is what Graham was just
talking about. Camus prairie and,

116
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,280
and what you see here is there's ranches
out there and you've got this 10 mile

117
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,870
long field of these gigantic ripples.

118
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,470
And if you look up in the upper
left hand corner of the screen,

119
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:10,210
you can see some of these ripples.
They're like Graham said there,

120
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:15,270
they're a hundred to 300 feet in
wavelength and they're up to 50 feet in

121
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:20,450
amplitude. And the water that flowed
through here that that deposited,

122
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:22,370
this was over a thousand feet deep.

123
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,560
So this is fractal, this fractal.
You get it in the small scale in the,

124
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:31,080
in the first image rattle
showed the same phenomenon.

125
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,120
They are with a flood just two feet deep.

126
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:38,150
And then we come to this
humongous testimony to what
happened 12,800 years ago.

127
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:41,340
And it's easy to drive through it and
not really figure what you're driving

128
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:44,790
through. But once you, once you look
at it and realize what happened, it,

129
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,010
it really dilates the imagination.

130
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,040
So this must have been just an absolutely
enormous event when it happened and,

131
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,560
and really sun imaginable and unimaginable
and human beings lived through that

132
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,300
and it changed everything.

133
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,360
These they called extinction level events,

134
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:07,410
these global cataclysms
wipe the slate clean. They,

135
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,800
they change everything and they,
and they set a new order in motion.

136
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,030
A new audit follows that.

137
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,810
So the classic example is the extinction
of the dinosaurs. 65 million years ago,

138
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,660
that 10 dinosaurs into chickens,
you know,

139
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,960
and they were gone and it
opened the way for mammals. And,

140
00:08:21,961 --> 00:08:25,950
and our distant ancestor is a
sort of 65 million year old shrew,

141
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,020
which was going nowhere until the
dinosaurs were wiped by a cosmic impact.

142
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,080
And then they began to
evolve. And, and here we are.

143
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:39,000
So dinosaurs became chickens and shrews
became human being charges for me to

144
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:42,270
imagine this. This is very hard to
be for me to wrap my head around,

145
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:46,760
but that we came from my shrew 65 million
years. All these harder. That's the,

146
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,460
that's, that's the, that's the story of
evolution. One can buy into it or not,

147
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:51,870
but that's the certainly mammals.

148
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:55,530
We're going nowhere right before the
dinosaurs were swept out of the, and the,

149
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,320
the point I'm making is that these events,

150
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:02,740
which are called extinction level
events, they reset the clock. They, they,

151
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,100
they make everything start again.
And,

152
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:08,550
and this is why what happened in
North America 12,800 years ago.

153
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:11,010
It's so important because that period,

154
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:14,640
the whole period was
12,800 to 11,600 years ago.

155
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:19,641
That period stands right in the
foundations of what we think of as the

156
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:22,590
beginnings,
the origins of civilization,

157
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:27,540
and yet mainstream archeology
and historians have not
taken it into account and

158
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,030
I don't blame them for that.
This is new information.

159
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,480
This is new science that's been mainly
published in the professional journals

160
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:36,720
since 2007 it's very
intriguing new information,

161
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:41,070
but we cannot any longer trust the
established model of the origins of

162
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:45,240
civilization since it does not take
into account an extinction level event.

163
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,350
Right in the foundations.

164
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:50,400
And that's why I say the House of history
appears to be built on foundations of

165
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:54,840
sand. Now, this hasn't been
adopted yet, but is it resisted?

166
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,040
Is has mainstream.
It is whenever you,

167
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:03,300
when ever you propose a
cataclysm of any kind,

168
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,380
it's a curious thing.

169
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:07,320
I don't know whether it's psychological
or something more sinister than that,

170
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:10,140
but whenever you, whenever you propose
that and present evidence for it,

171
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:15,141
you can be sure that you will be descended
upon by a furious crowd of critics

172
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,330
and the group of scientists,
more than 30 of them,

173
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,930
very significant mainstream scientists
who've been presenting the evidence for

174
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:26,931
the comet impact have had a fight on
their hands since 2007 but I can say with

175
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:31,080
confidence, and I detail it at length in
the book that they have won that fight.

176
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,090
Every criticism that's
been made at their work,

177
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,900
they have refuted and they've come back
with new evidence sometimes three or

178
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:40,740
four papers a year and it's a compelling
case and we can't ignore it and it

179
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,410
seems to me as a casual observer,
and I mean more cash,

180
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,370
probably more into it than
the average person, but no,

181
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,390
not even close to you guys that as
this evidence piles up like the,

182
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,720
the nuclear glass that they keep finding
it's about 12,000 that's one of what

183
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,770
they call the impact proxies.

184
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,860
See what we got to consider is
that we are looking at objects,

185
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,300
which might be a mile wide,

186
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,520
that are coming in to the atmosphere at
70,000 miles an hour and they are hot.

187
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,713
You know,

188
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,100
some people will remember comet shoemaker
Levy nine that hit Jupiter back in

189
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:17,130
1994 that was a small comment,
just two kilometers wide,

190
00:11:17,131 --> 00:11:18,990
broke into about 20 fragments.

191
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,500
The explosive power of those
impacts on Jupiter was 300 gigatons.

192
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:29,700
Now let me put that into perspective.
The entire world's nuclear arsenal,

193
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,680
where it to go off at once
would be 6.4 giga tons.

194
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,970
So you're looking at something
beyond imagination. The, the, the,

195
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:42,420
the power of these impacts is absolutely
colossal numbers. Numbers don't do it.

196
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,570
Just imagine a world on fire.
Uh, wasn't changed forever.

197
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,340
The explosion that had Jupiter was about
the size of the earth to, right? No, no,

198
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:53,890
no, no. This was a
comment. I mean, politics,

199
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,970
the plume itself, the size of
the earth. Yeah, absolutely.

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,350
So we're looking at something that when,
when it happened it was,

201
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,810
what's the timeline around what,

202
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:08,440
what was the calculations around
somewhere around 11,000 years ago? Well,

203
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,550
there's actually a period this is, this
is an an rather than a single instant,

204
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:15,190
and that's part of the mystery.
First off,

205
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,250
there are the impacts 12,800 years ago
that causes this cataclysm centered on

206
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:24,530
North America, but global and global
temperature plummets. It, I mean,

207
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,790
people who talk about global warming
or today what, what happened,

208
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:31,570
the change in temperature 12,800
years ago is just stunning.

209
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,810
And this is undeniable,
this in depth.

210
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:39,640
The last time he was here with mainstream
scientific data that's irrefutable.

211
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,000
Absolutely. Core samples, ice core
samples, apps along those lines.

212
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,170
And they called the, just
call it the younger dryas,
and it's a 1,200 year period,

213
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,730
temperatures plunge at the beginning,
massive animal extinctions.

214
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,070
And then 1,200 years later,

215
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,090
equally suddenly temperatures
shoot up again dramatically.

216
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:03,330
And there's another series of floods
so that the period is 12,800 to 11,600

217
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:06,190
years ago. And I think, I
don't know if Randal agrees,

218
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:11,170
we're sure that the comment was the
cause of the first event 12,000,

219
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:13,540
800 years ago.
I think other bits of the comet,

220
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,820
we're responsible for
the second event as well.

221
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:17,680
I think there was an impact in ocean,

222
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,130
which through water vapor up into the
upper atmosphere caused a greenhouse

223
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:24,990
effect and created that sudden spike
in warming and that huge flood,

224
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,970
those two warming spike show up very
dramatically in the Greenland ice cores.

225
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,090
And I pulled these up I
think in the last meeting,

226
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:35,190
but it would be good to
reference it again. And um,

227
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,540
basically what you see here is warming
spike number one is here and warming

228
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:46,250
spike number two is here
and these were extreme,

229
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,400
you know,
we're talking about 10,

230
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,590
10 degrees centigrade roughly
in perhaps a year or two.

231
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,820
And this translates into about
17 or 18 degrees Fahrenheit.

232
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,940
So we're talking many
times greater than the,

233
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,060
the warming of the last century or two.
Um,

234
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,670
instantly basically just like that. And
this, this is this, this what we see here,

235
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:13,820
brackets, this, this
whole episode of this,

236
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:18,560
this period of transition from the
glacial age to this Nice Warm Holocene

237
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:22,190
interglacial age that we're in now.
And you know,

238
00:14:22,191 --> 00:14:26,960
Graham brought up about how this sits
right at the very foundation of our modern

239
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:31,190
history. And if you look at whether
it's the dispersion of languages,

240
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:35,120
the beginning of agriculture, the first
cities, the domestication of animals,

241
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,720
what you see over and over again is the
same date showing up, you know, eight,

242
00:14:38,721 --> 00:14:40,250
nine,
10,000 years ago.

243
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,730
And in this model that
we're describing here,

244
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:47,180
we're not really seeing the
genesis of civilization.

245
00:14:47,181 --> 00:14:52,181
We're seeing the rebooting of
civilization in the aftermath

246
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,940
of these events. They're not the only
thing that makes sense. This is, this is,

247
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:57,530
this is what we have now.

248
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,460
We have now the data that makes sense
of what previously has been very

249
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:03,080
mysterious and unexplained evidence.

250
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,970
So for folks who are not aware
of both of your work, to me,

251
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:12,510
this is so fascinating because I've been
a fan of your, your books since God.

252
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,700
I don't, I mean more than
a decade. Right? What,

253
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:15,860
when did it come out in the nineties?

254
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,670
Well think of prince of the gods
which was published in 1995 which is,

255
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:22,010
which is 20 years ago,
and magicians of the gods,

256
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,890
the new book is the
sequel to fingerprints.

257
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,990
And I've written it because there's
just this massive new information that

258
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:30,260
changes the whole picture completely.
Uh, fingerprints of the gods.

259
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:35,261
I started reading sometime in the late
nineties and just became engrossed in it

260
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:40,040
and fascinated by this concept, that
civilization and as, as you put it,

261
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:45,041
that we are a species that has amnesia
and that just forgot what our past was.

262
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,840
But the two of you together is what's
so fascinating cause it puts this puzzle

263
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:51,410
together,

264
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,410
your obsession with asteroidal impacts
and these massive extinction events and

265
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:02,190
your knowledge of this ancient
architecture that doesn't make any sense.

266
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:06,130
And these ancient construction methods
that seem to differ and that the

267
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,130
timelines and for people who aren't
aware of the whole story behind it,

268
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:15,131
the erosion on the enclosure of the
Sphinx where where they made this fake has

269
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,880
thousands of years of rainfall erosion.

270
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,850
That doesn't make any sense because
the last time there was rain,

271
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:26,510
the Nile Valley was like 9,000 BC,
which is right.

272
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:29,420
Some around their ass really weave.
The climate of,

273
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:34,100
of of Egypt has been as dry as it is
today for about the last 5,000 years,

274
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:37,460
so you have to go back. You actually
have to go back to this period,

275
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:41,270
to this younger dryas period to get those
heavy rainfalls that could have eroded

276
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:44,840
the Sphinx in the way it is and I want
to pay tribute to the work of John

277
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,810
Anthony West and Robert Schoch from
Boston University because they broke this

278
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:52,811
story way back in 1992 and at the time
the Egypt illogical establishment of

279
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:57,800
course were furious that anybody dared
to suggest that the Sphinx might be

280
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:59,960
12,000 years old.
The Egyptologist said,

281
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:04,040
we know the Sphinx dates from 2,500 BC.
Actually,

282
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,520
one of the things I've done in this
book is look at what the Egyptology case

283
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,650
rests on. And it's a fairy tale. It rests
on nothing. It's kind of ideology. It's a,

284
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:13,161
it's,
it's,

285
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:17,450
it's their idea of how things should be
rather than any real factual evidence

286
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:22,451
that puts the Sphinx at 2,500 BC and
the geology puts the sphinx much,

287
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:26,660
much older. Now, the argument of
the archeologists at the time was,

288
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,770
and anyway,

289
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:32,210
the Sphinx couldn't possibly be 12,000
years old because if that was the work of

290
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:34,430
some unknown culture 12,000 years ago,

291
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,880
we're going to find lots of other
monuments around the world that had 12,000

292
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:40,160
years old and we don't find any.
Um,

293
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,990
well that was 1992 but now we're in 2015.

294
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,920
And the sight of God Beckley Tepi in
Turkey has been discovered with it's

295
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,100
gigantic

296
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,160
megaliths a deliberately buried time
capsule buried more than 10,000 years ago

297
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:58,020
and created 11 and a
half thousand years ago.

298
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:01,380
And if you can make go back the Tempe,
you can make the Sphinx.

299
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:06,270
We are finding the fingerprints of this
lost civilization popping up all around

300
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:06,721
the world.

301
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:11,460
Indeed on any archaeological site where
you can be absolutely sure of the dating,

302
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,260
the dating proves to be much older than
we have been taught by archeologists.

303
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,750
They recently discovered
a huge megalithic site,

304
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,720
40 meters underwater between
in the Sicily channel.

305
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,260
It's been underwater for
best part of 10,000 years,

306
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:30,000
which means that Megalithic site is at
least that old and maybe much older and

307
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:33,780
we can be sure about the dating
because it's underwater. Likewise,

308
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:36,840
we can be sure of the dating of Quebec
Lee Tapi because whoever made it

309
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,670
deliberately buried it,
sealed it,

310
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:43,590
and no later organic material got in to
contaminate the carbon dating record and

311
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:47,550
give falsely young. They didn't buried
someone else during that time period,

312
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:49,840
buried it, but somebody
buried it. They went to them.

313
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,240
We don't know when it was built,

314
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:55,410
but we know it's buried at least 10 to
12 the dates that are coming out of it

315
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:57,150
now,
the earliest dates now,

316
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,570
it's important to be clear that there's
much more of God Beckley Tepi under the

317
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:02,010
ground.
There's,

318
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:06,960
there's actually about 50 times as
much as has already been excavated,

319
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,840
which is under the ground
still and not being dug up yet.

320
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:12,060
They know it's there because they'd
been over the whole site with ground

321
00:19:12,061 --> 00:19:16,440
penetrating radar and what they're seeing
is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

322
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,680
of these huge 20 to 50 ton
t-shaped megalithic pillars
buried under the ground.

323
00:19:22,471 --> 00:19:27,471
Somebody just as somebody went to
enormous lengths to create this site,

324
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,400
they also,
or somebody else,

325
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,340
went to enormous lengths to burry
it and actually got Beckley.

326
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:36,540
Tapi means potbellied hill in the Turkish
language and that whole potbellied

327
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,050
hill that covers this site was
artificially put there by human beings,

328
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:44,610
teams of men and women with buckets filled
with rubble and stones filling it in

329
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:48,590
and covering it up. So
strange. And there's no, no,

330
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:53,440
no guesses or theories as to why they
did this. Really not. There's the,

331
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:55,740
there's not,
it's just a fact that it happened because,

332
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:59,700
because archeologists and geologists
can tell from the nature of the material

333
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:03,380
that covers these pillars that it isn't
a natural sedimentation that they would

334
00:20:03,381 --> 00:20:07,650
deliberately covered up what's going to
be satisfying to you guys too. Obsessed,

335
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:12,651
crazy man come together and your theories
lock in like puzzle pieces and ha ha.

336
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,920
Well you, you've got the right
word there because this is, man,

337
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,080
I even respect put my had up to
that as as I've, I've absolutely,

338
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:27,870
you've got to be a bit obsessed to
stick with somebody who I, you know,

339
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:29,520
I came in for an enormous amount of,

340
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:33,210
of criticism and flack when I published
fingerprints of the gods and I'm human.

341
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:36,330
It hurts when people say
really bad things about me.

342
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,350
But what I've learned is you just
have to persist. You just have to,

343
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:45,180
you just have to keep going.
Even if your ideas are shouted down by,

344
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,100
you know, the established holders
of knowledge in our society,

345
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,010
if you feel strongly enough about those
ideas, you've got to hang with them.

346
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:54,190
And I've hung with these ideas
for more than 20 years now.

347
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:58,930
And what we're seeing is just a massive
new evidence that that basically

348
00:20:58,931 --> 00:21:02,440
vindicates the notion of a,
of, of a lost civilization.

349
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,680
See if I may say go Beckley Tepi um,

350
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,110
the earliest dates they've
pulled out of the ground now,

351
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:11,980
which they think is the foundation
of the site is 11,600 years ago.

352
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:17,260
And that is really significant because
11,600 years ago was the second episode

353
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:19,270
of cataclysm at the end
of the younger dryers.

354
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:23,470
And we know it was accompanied
by massive global flooding.

355
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,800
Is it possible that this
was covered up then?

356
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,310
And it wasn't covering up intentionally
by people that it was covered up as a

357
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:34,560
part of it was made after
the cataclysm was over. Uh,

358
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,500
an archeologist have a problem with this
because the site is very sophisticated.

359
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:43,450
It contains the world's first perfectly
north south aligned structure and you

360
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:46,150
can't do that without precise astronomy.
In fact,

361
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:49,910
they are huge astronomical implications
to the go back to the Tempe site.

362
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,480
The architecture is,
is massive.

363
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,620
And you see the problem archaeology
has is that up till now they've been

364
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:59,620
teaching us that megalithic
sites like this astronomically,

365
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:00,730
a megalithic sites like this,

366
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:04,270
our maximum of five to five
and a half thousand years old.

367
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:07,870
And suddenly we're looking at a site
which is far bigger than any other

368
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:09,700
megalithic site known in the world,

369
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,830
which is at least 6,000 years
older than any other known sites.

370
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,940
Or how do they explain this?
Our ancestors,

371
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:18,370
I supposed to have been just
hunter gatherers at that time,

372
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,140
nomads following the game,

373
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:25,090
not with a sophisticated
societal organization that
would have specialists who

374
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:27,310
had these knowledge, who had
the skills, who could put this,

375
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,540
put this work together.

376
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,380
So the fairy tale archeologist are now
telling about good Beckley Tapi is that

377
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:37,381
one morning a group of hunter gatherers
woke up somehow divinely inspired with,

378
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,530
with the complete knowledge of Megalithic
architecture and how to organize a

379
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:43,750
workforce on how to bring them to a site,
which by the way,

380
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:46,510
there's no water on that site.
And to put this whole,

381
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,920
this whole proposition together and at
the same time, exactly at the same moment,

382
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:52,180
11,000,
600 years ago,

383
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,840
we suddenly get evidence of
agriculture spreading all over Turkey.

384
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:59,920
It's like go Beckley Tepi as a center
of innovation and associated with it is

385
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:03,460
the birth of agriculture
in Turkey. Uh, and,

386
00:23:03,461 --> 00:23:07,270
and to me this looks like
a transfer of technology.

387
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,960
It does not look to me like a group of
hunter gatherers woke up one morning

388
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:14,710
magically equipped with the ability
to invent agriculture and create a

389
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:15,760
megalithic site like this.

390
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:19,570
It looks to me like people who already
had that knowledge came into that area,

391
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,510
settled there and try to pass on their
knowledge to the local people and maybe

392
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:27,400
used to go back to the Tempe as a kind
of university or initiation center to

393
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:30,640
train and teach people in those skills.
That's what it feels like.

394
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:33,040
And another point is that that same day,

395
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:38,041
Dylan thousand 600 years ago is the date
that Plato gives us for the destruction

396
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:43,660
and submergence by flood of the lost
civilization of Atlantis. And up till now,

397
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:47,510
archeologists have dismissed the whole
Atlantis story and they regard it as kind

398
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,330
of pseudoscience,
although it comes from Plato.

399
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:55,280
But Plato said very clearly that this
happened 9,000 years before the time of so

400
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:57,680
long and so long lived in 600 BC.

401
00:23:57,681 --> 00:24:02,060
So Plato is telling us
Atlantis went down 9,600 BC,

402
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,580
11,600 years ago.

403
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,570
Exactly the date of the second spike
of the younger dryas cataclysm.

404
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,020
If you're look,
you're at this graph,

405
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:13,420
we see random pull this sucker up close
to you so that you get a little bit more.

406
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,990
It's a, we can see here, these are um,

407
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,200
studies of sea level rise
at the end of the ice age.

408
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,280
And rather than it being a smooth curve,
which was the old model,

409
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:28,110
which you can see represented by the
dashed line, it's too enormous spikes.

410
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:33,190
And that second spike, it melt
what? There you see MWP dash one B.

411
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:35,790
That's meltwater pulse one B.

412
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,250
And you've got meltwater pulse one,

413
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:43,251
a meltwater pulse one B is dated
precisely to 11,600 years ago.

414
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:48,500
This is crazy. It's like everything
aligns, everything aligns the, that, the,

415
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:51,930
the nuclear glass that they're finding.
And then the core samples,

416
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,090
well that's all the same, run
the same test. What's the point

417
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:58,770
I wanted to make when we talk about these
objects coming in at 70,000 miles an

418
00:24:58,771 --> 00:25:02,460
hour, they are packing an enormous
amount of kinetic energy and heat.

419
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:04,580
And when they hit the ground,
uh,

420
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:09,120
there are distinct products left in
the soil and that does include nano

421
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:12,180
diamonds. You can not, they're
created by the shock and the impact.

422
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:15,630
You can only see them, you know, that
under a microscope, that tiny, tiny,

423
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:19,050
tiny things and carbons
failures and the melt glass,

424
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,400
which is just basically
identical to trinity site,

425
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,260
which is the melt glass that you get from
nuclear explosions and they're called

426
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:26,130
impact proxies.

427
00:25:26,131 --> 00:25:30,930
And there's a distinct layer of the soil
all around the world data to 12,000,

428
00:25:30,931 --> 00:25:31,711
800 years ago,

429
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:36,060
which contains this stuff and also
contains the evidence of continental

430
00:25:36,061 --> 00:25:37,920
wildfires burning.

431
00:25:37,921 --> 00:25:41,040
And I think Randall might want to address
that issue of continental wildfires

432
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:41,880
and why they happen.

433
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,170
The, all these images are
beautiful bullets. Um,

434
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:47,580
note that most people are
just listening to this,

435
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,410
so if you're just listening to this,

436
00:25:49,411 --> 00:25:54,300
those images that Randall put up on the
screen show these enormous straight up

437
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:57,690
and down spikes of the water level rising,

438
00:25:57,691 --> 00:26:01,720
which has to be caused by
some ocean level rises,

439
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,690
which has to be because caused by
something extremely dramatic like that.

440
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,920
Just looking at that like, wow,
what happened there? Well nuts.

441
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,230
That's the melting of the ice sheets.

442
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:18,560
The sudden rapid catastrophic meltdown
or the ice sheets dumping millions of

443
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,570
cubic kilometers of water back into the
ocean basins and how those little dashes

444
00:26:24,571 --> 00:26:28,340
on the bottom, the the numbers, how
many years do they represent like the,

445
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:31,860
that spike that goes straight up
and down though the largest spike.

446
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,080
How much time does that represent?
Well,

447
00:26:34,081 --> 00:26:37,490
you've got to to hear that
basically represent the,

448
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,570
the margin of error in the dating.

449
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:44,350
The earliest version of it is the spike
you see on, right. The latest version

450
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:49,350
did you see is under on the left and it
varies between about 14 and 13,000 years

451
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,420
for the first spike. The second spike
is dating now too. About, like I said,

452
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:56,110
about 11,600 the,

453
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,660
the numbers across the bottom arth k
y r means thousands of years before

454
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:05,370
present. So you can see nine 10
that would be 10,000 years ago.

455
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,260
So essentially seems like our earth went
through like a thousand years of horror.

456
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:15,240
Thousand Years of hell. Uh,
it, it, it's, it's really
impossible to imagine what the,

457
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,540
what the world was like then
for the people who lived in it.

458
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:23,570
And I think it makes sense of why all
around the world we have a story of a

459
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:25,140
global flood.
This is,

460
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:28,620
this is not something confined to
the story of Noah in the Bible.

461
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:33,621
This is a universal story of a cataclysm
that changed the world and wiped away a

462
00:27:33,661 --> 00:27:38,370
former golden age and left us with the
present order of things all around the

463
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:40,980
world. And secondly, all around
the world, and this is intriguing.

464
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,270
There is a universal fear of comments.
Now why should we be afraid of comments?

465
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:48,600
We see comments up in the sky. They
whizzed through, they have this nice tail,

466
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:50,820
they look, they look pretty.
Why should we be scared of them?

467
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:56,060
But every culture in the world has myths
and traditions that associate comments

468
00:27:56,071 --> 00:28:00,510
with disaster. Uh, and, and I think
it's pretty obvious why, because this,

469
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:05,370
this comet impact 12,800 years ago was
remembered by the survivors and they

470
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:08,790
passed that memory down to their
children and their children's children.

471
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:12,900
And it's still with us today and it's
now we know based on something very real

472
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,471
well,

473
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:17,730
it seems like to me as a lay person with
all this evidence and all this evidence

474
00:28:17,731 --> 00:28:21,270
that correlates, it's all corresponding,
it all seems to fit together.

475
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,950
It would seem that this would be something
that a lot of mainstream scientists

476
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:29,760
and archeologists would be extremely
interested in. Like why would they,

477
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,940
why would they try to ignore something
like the first thing they've tried to do

478
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:33,900
is to get rid of it.

479
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,640
This is often the case where new
information emerges that contradicts

480
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:40,680
established,
established theories.

481
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,670
And it's a strange phenomenon in science
because we like to think of scientists

482
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,030
as as rational and reasonable people.

483
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:51,570
But the fact is that when you get
very committed to a particular model,

484
00:28:51,571 --> 00:28:55,500
to a particular idea, I think you start
to connect your own personality to it.

485
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:59,940
And any attack on that idea becomes an
existential, a tourniquet on you yourself.

486
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,570
How Sad. And it is an, it is
sad because again, and again,

487
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:05,620
what we see is the,
uh,

488
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,530
the new facts being dismissed because
they don't fit the existing theory where

489
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:14,790
in fact what we should
be doing is modifying the
existing theory to explain the

490
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,530
newly discovered facts.
And this is a,

491
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:18,570
this is a problem in the
whole history of science.

492
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,060
I remember when I first became aware
of that problem when I watched the

493
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:27,061
documentary and the mysteries
of the Sphinx where doctor
Robert Schoch met with,

494
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:31,660
uh, some archeologist in
Egypt. It wasn't Zoe Huw.

495
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:32,270
Asa was a,

496
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,900
a Western guy and he met with this guy
and they were explaining their theory

497
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:41,430
about the erosions of the Sphinx.
And he was laughing at it, me, me,

498
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,310
but openly

499
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,760
mocking yet, like what evidence
were, where's this evidence?

500
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,240
But it was the way he did. It was just
so riddled with ego. I was like, wow,

501
00:29:50,241 --> 00:29:51,074
how could you,

502
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,620
first of all the concept of 11,000 years
ago when you start thinking about 11th,

503
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,870
that's a long time.
And what,

504
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,840
what evidence really would
be there other than stone?

505
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,880
It seems to me that it'd be very little.
I mean,

506
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:09,490
you've whatever fragments of
pottery, you'd be lucky to
find, we're lucky defined,

507
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,290
but looking for some massive evidence
that clearly shows beyond any shadow of it

508
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:16,430
outweigh. Here it is. I got, boy, you're,

509
00:30:16,431 --> 00:30:20,980
you're asking for a lot from 11,000
years ago and you have something pretty

510
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:23,500
substantial right in front
of you and he's mocking it.

511
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,460
Exactly.
This is why I've,

512
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,520
I've come to view archeology and history
as a kind of more ideology really than,

513
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,410
than science. Um, there's, there's a,

514
00:30:33,411 --> 00:30:38,090
there's an ideological view about how
civilization developed that we have this

515
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:40,130
long, slow, gradual,

516
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,600
politically correct rise
from the upper paleolithic,

517
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:48,110
from the hunter gatherers through
the Neolithic into the first cities.

518
00:30:48,111 --> 00:30:52,670
And we go on and on and then we develop
technologies and here we are the apex.

519
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:54,710
And the pinnacle of this
whole story and Gosh,

520
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:59,660
we're so proud of ourselves and our
achievements and we think we're wonderful

521
00:30:59,661 --> 00:31:03,710
and we praise and value our technology.
I've got nothing against technology,

522
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,660
but there's a hint of arrogance
in this. There's a hint of, of,

523
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:10,150
of pride that it was all about us.
And I,

524
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:13,820
I think that the,
once you start introducing this,

525
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:17,390
this new view of history that they
may have been an earlier civilization,

526
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,130
a high civilization which was utterly
wiped out by a global cataclysm,

527
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,670
why it contradicts that ideological
position and you find yourself in

528
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,980
ideological struggle with archeologists
and that's why, you know, sort of hub.

529
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,180
For example, if my book is handed
over to any archeologist to review,

530
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,560
they're just going to piss all over it.

531
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,710
They're not even probably going to read
it. They're just going to say, Hank,

532
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:38,720
what they say again and again,
Hancock is a pseudo scientist.

533
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,500
Nobody should listen to him.
That's there.

534
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,900
A system of attack is to first of all
devalue you so much that nobody will ever

535
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:46,731
listen to you.

536
00:31:46,731 --> 00:31:51,440
And that's why I appreciate the support
of just real down to earth people out

537
00:31:51,441 --> 00:31:54,350
there who are looking at this information
and finding the actually, yeah,

538
00:31:54,351 --> 00:31:56,930
the story of history we've
been taught doesn't make sense.

539
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,670
And this new information does make
sense of it. Well, this new information

540
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,600
in my eyes, it seems, it's so
substantial and there's so much of it.

541
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:07,790
It's so,
so much of it fits together.

542
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:12,830
It's incredibly difficult to ignore and
much more so than when that documentary

543
00:32:12,831 --> 00:32:17,610
and his finks was created.
So that was quite a while
ago. Charlton Heston was the,

544
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,320
the narrator to it. And, and, and
um, you know, at that time, uh,

545
00:32:22,321 --> 00:32:25,590
we were sticking our necks out, putting
that, putting that information forward.

546
00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:30,040
I was in that documentary as well.
But today things have changed. And,

547
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:31,380
and what I see is the,

548
00:32:31,381 --> 00:32:35,220
the archeological mainstream in a
state of denial about this information,

549
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,950
they just don't want to
recognize it and absorb it,

550
00:32:37,951 --> 00:32:39,980
but they're going to have to recognize it.
It's going to be forced

551
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,640
upon them, whether they like it or
not. It's so sad because you, you know,

552
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:47,930
you count on these people to
distribute the information, but they,

553
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:50,090
their egos get involved in things.

554
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:52,610
And if you've been teaching
something for a long time,

555
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:56,900
then it turns out you gave out master's
degrees on things that were completely

556
00:32:56,901 --> 00:33:00,860
incorrect until lately. It's absolutely,
it's gotta be something else.

557
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:03,920
So though this sounds a bit
con con con conspiratorial,

558
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:08,950
I think the existing view of history
is part of a mind control system in our

559
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:09,950
society.
It's a,

560
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:13,070
it's something that we're presented with
that we take in with our mother's milk

561
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:17,660
and we're never supposed to question.
I think it's, if you control the past,

562
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,170
you do actually control the
present and the future as well. So,

563
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:25,670
but you mean if you have an absolutely
established narrative that you're

564
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:29,670
teaching and you're unwilling to look at
any possible variations to that, you're,

565
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,180
you're saying like almost
from an authority position.

566
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:36,920
We know what happened and we know where
we're going, but if you say, shit,

567
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:38,990
we don't know what happened,
then it's,

568
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,840
well we'll then who are you to
tell us where we're going? Exactly.

569
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,480
And it starts to raise questions
over everything, right?

570
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,690
Yeah. And we're kind of in this,
in this mode now where, um,

571
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:49,781
there's a,
uh,

572
00:33:49,781 --> 00:33:54,600
a very large growing political agenda
around the idea that humans are the sole

573
00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:59,601
cause of global change and that we're
the dominant force within this whole

574
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:02,670
process. Now here we come along
and we're saying, well, no,

575
00:34:02,671 --> 00:34:07,080
there's actually been a forces unleashed
on this planet that really utterly

576
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:11,010
dwarf anything we've done yet.
What does that do to that,

577
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,180
to that paradigm?

578
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,770
You see that that's what I think what
we're coming down here to part of the, um,

579
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:22,200
the scenario now is that humans are
engaged in causing the sixth great mass

580
00:34:22,201 --> 00:34:25,350
extinction as we talked about in
one of your, one of the previous,

581
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,500
and now we're coming along and
saying, well, wait a second.

582
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:32,580
Here's something from outer space that
has come in and caused the last great

583
00:34:32,581 --> 00:34:33,870
mass extinction on earth.

584
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,740
And what's interesting I found is
that quite a number of the, um, the,

585
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:43,590
the scientists that have been in the
opposition to the younger dryas impact

586
00:34:43,591 --> 00:34:47,130
hypothesis have been in the
forefront of pushing this,

587
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:52,430
this scenario of human
caused mass extinction and
blaming the extinction of the

588
00:34:52,831 --> 00:34:57,660
great megafauna that died out
12,000 years ago on human hunters,

589
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,860
which I again,

590
00:34:58,861 --> 00:35:03,720
we talked about that and I considered
that ludicrous that Paleo Indian hunters

591
00:35:03,721 --> 00:35:08,190
using spears are going to
cause the extermination of
10 million woolly mammoths

592
00:35:08,191 --> 00:35:12,930
before they could even reproduce,
along with 120 other species of Megafauna.

593
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:13,331
Well,

594
00:35:13,331 --> 00:35:18,331
65% of all mammals in North America were
wiped out somewhere around that time.

595
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,260
Mega mammals, mega man, which
is over a hundred pounds in
body weight, essentially.

596
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:23,840
Yeah.

597
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:28,840
And actually more like 75 or 75 or 75%
of it was almost instantaneous load.

598
00:35:29,141 --> 00:35:33,000
Right. I mean, it was over a course of
a very short period of time after time.

599
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:38,010
The scientists who have been
diligently working in this, in this

600
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,430
field since that they've
published their first paper in,

601
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:45,431
in in 2007 I've just brought out in
a new paper in the proceedings of the

602
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,160
National Academy of Sciences,
July,

603
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,890
2015 where they're doing a statistical
analysis and all the sites where the

604
00:35:49,891 --> 00:35:50,880
evidence comes from.

605
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,050
And what that tells us is that this is
what is referred to as an ISO crown.

606
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:58,170
This event 12,800 years ago.
It's not,

607
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:02,940
we're not looking at the effects of
a hundred or 200 years of um, events.

608
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,000
We're looking at something that happened
effectively in a single afternoon

609
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,450
across 50 million square
kilometers of the earth's surface.

610
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,810
Ooh, that gives me goosebumps
a single afternoon. Yeah.

611
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,220
All over the world.

612
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:19,630
Everything changes forever and
it's fucked for a thousand years.

613
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,170
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

614
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:25,070
And then I'd like Randall to address
this issue of continent wide wildfires

615
00:36:25,071 --> 00:36:26,540
because we do see this in the,
in the,

616
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:30,170
in the stratum that when you get this
super heated ejector coming down on and on

617
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:32,750
ancient primal forests,
consider the effect.

618
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,440
This is Marie Springs,
one of the Clovis sites.

619
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:40,670
And this is what the was known as the
Black Mat layer. Where's Murray Springs?

620
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,540
It's in Arizona and it's southern Arizona.

621
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,470
And it's near the Clovis site,
which is, um, New Mexico, um,

622
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,250
called the Clovis impact site. Well, no,

623
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,570
the Clovis site was where the one of the
first places in North America where for

624
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:01,400
human remains were found in association
with a extinct mega mammals such as

625
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:05,330
woolly mammoths. Um, and it's just
outside of Clovis, New Mexico.

626
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,650
They refer to them as the Clovis culture
because the culture was one of the

627
00:37:09,651 --> 00:37:11,900
casualties of this climate impact.

628
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,880
The comment impact is often referred to
as the Clovis comment. Okay. Yes. And,

629
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:19,610
and many of these Clovis sites and
has been over 50 of them around now

630
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:21,050
documented over North America.

631
00:37:21,051 --> 00:37:24,560
I think about two thirds of them
have this black matte layer,

632
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:29,180
which shows a very clearly in this image
now that black matte layer is black

633
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:32,930
because of the, uh,
considerable amount of carbon,

634
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,470
carbon soot that's in it. So
in other words, right there,

635
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:40,880
that's the evidence of your wildfires
is that this blanket of soot over the

636
00:37:40,881 --> 00:37:45,881
continent that left this black matte
layer and below that black matte layer

637
00:37:46,101 --> 00:37:49,400
you'll find extinct mega mammals.

638
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,600
Like here you see the Yellow Arrow there,
points to the black mat layer.

639
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:56,090
Now if you look up,
you'll see how it's more buff colored.

640
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,190
That was the color of all of this.

641
00:37:58,191 --> 00:38:03,191
But the suit that was in that black
matte layer has dispersed and colored the

642
00:38:03,261 --> 00:38:05,150
other adjacent layers.

643
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,680
But you'll notice the bones below
are the bones of extinct mammals.

644
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,240
The bones found above it,

645
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:16,040
our extent or still existing
mammals and net layer separates,

646
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,740
um, these, these,

647
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,700
these two domains of
extinct mammals and extent.

648
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:26,120
I have just a very clear line.
Yeah. And, and you can see it,

649
00:38:26,121 --> 00:38:30,110
it shows up so clearly,
right to people who listening to this,

650
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,660
when we're looking at the original
image that Randall showed,

651
00:38:32,661 --> 00:38:34,250
it's almost like an Oreo cookie.

652
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:38,410
Like there's a clean line and then there's
the white filling underneath. I mean,

653
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:42,610
it is as clear as day.
And what are we talking about?

654
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:46,690
Like how much fire and for
how long creates this area?

655
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:47,891
Well,

656
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:52,520
you're basically talking about burning
up a considerable portion of the bio mass

657
00:38:52,521 --> 00:38:56,540
of North America in unglazed
glaciated North America to do this.

658
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:01,550
So you have the ice cap north of
roughly Minnesota and the south of it.

659
00:39:01,551 --> 00:39:06,551
You have a heavily vegetated area covered
with primal forests and that's what

660
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:07,821
goes on fire.

661
00:39:07,821 --> 00:39:11,180
And the reason it goes on fire is
because when these impact has come in,

662
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:15,360
they generate a huge amount of heat and
and what is called ejector superheated

663
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,860
ejectors throwing up into the upper
atmosphere and it falls down all over the

664
00:39:18,861 --> 00:39:23,350
continent and it's sets the world on fire.
Oh God no.

665
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,150
At the procedure is so difficult in this.
It's a distance.

666
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,400
There's numbers that you guys are throwing
around and his concepts you throwing

667
00:39:31,401 --> 00:39:35,390
around that. I just, I have to pause
when you're saying, well wait a minute,

668
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,110
I've got to try to fit this in somewhere.
But it's the whole,

669
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,180
the whole world on fire.
Yeah.

670
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,420
This is why I've written this
book because it's mind boggling.

671
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,990
It's mind boggling material.
And, and up till now,

672
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:53,050
most of the information has been confined
to the really rarefied scientific

673
00:39:53,211 --> 00:39:56,270
journals. Very little of it has
got out into the public domain.

674
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:59,370
So one of the things I've tried to
do is to put this together into a,

675
00:39:59,371 --> 00:40:02,960
into a form that's very accessible to
the general public because we all need to

676
00:40:02,961 --> 00:40:06,590
know about this. This is our yesterday,
this is our background. This is,

677
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,630
this is where we come from.

678
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,580
The present order of the world
has descended from that moment.

679
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,140
And what is the mainstream explanation
for what we're looking at here?

680
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:19,650
Like how do they, how do
they describe this? Well, the
mainstream, the mainstream,

681
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,110
to me now,
it's Firestone and West [inaudible].

682
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,060
Yeah. And when Ronald says
Firestone in western Canada,

683
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:28,260
he's talking about some of the lead
scientists who have presented the evidence

684
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:31,470
for the younger dryas impact
because they have triumphed,

685
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,700
although they were attacked and sometimes
viciously, and frankly speaking,

686
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:38,010
sometimes dishonestly,
they were attacked,

687
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:42,510
but they defended themselves so well and
they kept on bringing in new data and

688
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:46,260
new information that actually now we
should be regarding their view as the

689
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:47,071
mainstream.
Yeah,

690
00:40:47,071 --> 00:40:50,700
there are a few critics still hanging
in there who would like human beings to

691
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:54,000
have been responsible for the extinction
of all the the mega mammals and who

692
00:40:54,001 --> 00:40:57,660
would, who you know, who
just are in denial about the
climate change at that time.

693
00:40:57,661 --> 00:41:00,450
But there they're no longer
than mainstream. In my view.

694
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,720
One of the problems with the theories,
what you show the last time you were here,

695
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:04,261
these,

696
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:08,380
the evidence of these woolly mammoths had
died instantaneously and that they're,

697
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:13,100
they're massive fields of them that
something had to happen and ones with like

698
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,350
their legs broken just
bent over from the impact.

699
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:21,690
Like it's pretty clear something went
down and all of these pieces point

700
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:24,990
together and including looking at this,
which is just,

701
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:29,280
this is blowing my mind,
this idea of the world on fire just,

702
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,740
well there were some places that
apparently got spared like Australia or

703
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:38,330
something. Well, Australia actually
suffered a major mass extinction,

704
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:43,310
but earlier, probably from some
previous event, maybe 30,000 years ago,

705
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,773
but

706
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,520
just trying to figure out where to go
off and having a central Africa seems to

707
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:54,170
have been one of the places of refuge
because if we look at the distribution of

708
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:55,610
mega mammals in the world today,

709
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:59,900
where do we find the greatest
concentration in in Africa? Right? Well,

710
00:41:59,901 --> 00:42:04,901
Africa has retained 90% of its
mega mammals from the pleistocene,

711
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,960
whereas North America lost 75% if you
go back to North America during the Ice

712
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,590
Age,
there was as many mega mammals,

713
00:42:12,591 --> 00:42:15,770
if not more species than
there is in Africa today.

714
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:21,130
But what we see is that extinction
relates directly to habitat loss and

715
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,290
basically not much survived in
either north or South America.

716
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:32,560
North and South America were both severely
affected by these events and lost 75%

717
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:38,450
of their mega mammals. Eurasia lost
between, depending on where you go,

718
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:43,100
between 30 and 50% Africa
only lost about 10% of them.

719
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:46,760
And that's why you see so many
big animals still in Africa today.

720
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,321
And a lot of them,

721
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:52,160
I think probably disbursed from the
area around the great rift zone.

722
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,970
It seems like in a lot of
the areas actually where
we're finding early hominids

723
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,280
is,

724
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,280
is in that same area that seems like for
whatever reason it was spared somewhat

725
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,360
of the, the extreme severity that
the rest of the planet it's suffered.

726
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:10,930
It's an interesting situation because
when we look at the arguments of history

727
00:43:10,931 --> 00:43:15,880
and archeology, very little of the
story is told in North America,

728
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,630
uh, in, as, as it's taught in schools
and universities today. You know,

729
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:24,631
they look at places like Sumeria in
Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt and further

730
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:28,420
down in South America, some of the,
the, the great cultures of the, of the,

731
00:43:28,421 --> 00:43:32,740
of the Andes, but it's like North
America is missing from the map.

732
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:36,670
They talk about hunter gatherers coming
in here across the Bering strait and

733
00:43:36,671 --> 00:43:40,810
there's still a, a dog, each faction of
archeology that wants to maintain that.

734
00:43:40,811 --> 00:43:44,320
That just happened about
13,000 years ago. Um, and,

735
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:47,200
and that there was no human beings
in the Americas before that.

736
00:43:47,201 --> 00:43:51,520
Although the mass of
contradictory evidence is
overwhelming that dogma as well.

737
00:43:51,521 --> 00:43:55,350
It's obvious that the Americans were
populated long before that and those pop

738
00:43:55,351 --> 00:43:57,910
populations did not only come
in across the Bering strait.

739
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,910
They came in in in other ways as well and,
and,

740
00:44:00,911 --> 00:44:04,750
and then there just seems to be
nothing for a very long time and,

741
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:07,510
and North Americans kind of left
out of the story of civilization.

742
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:12,040
Well now I think we know why because
North America was at the heart of this

743
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:12,670
disaster.

744
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:17,670
It was at the absolute epicenter and the
slate was completely wiped clean here.

745
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,920
And that's what archeologists are,
are looking at.

746
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:23,800
They're seeing a wipe clean slate and
they think they're seeing the beginning of

747
00:44:23,801 --> 00:44:24,940
something actually they're not.

748
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,920
They're seeing the movement on have
something after a horrendous disaster.

749
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,130
Wow. This, it's so

750
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,130
hard to wrap my mind around this idea
that for literally a thousand years,

751
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:44,540
the earth was just riddled with asteroidal
impacts and fire and nuclear winter

752
00:44:45,901 --> 00:44:49,040
because of the Dustin mass extinction of,
gee,

753
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:53,760
it's so hard that the numbers that you're
throwing around the ideas behind it,

754
00:44:53,761 --> 00:44:56,310
it's, it's, it's very difficult for folks

755
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,840
tonight put something in there
that brings it home in a way.

756
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,580
See this, um, event 12,800 years ago,

757
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:10,470
we know now it was caused by fragments
of a very large comet and the work

758
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:14,580
suggest that that comment may have been
more than 100 kilometers in diameter

759
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,930
originally when it entered the Minnesota
system. See, call it 62 miles. Right.

760
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:24,360
Big, big old comment. These comments,
they come in from deep space.

761
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,180
How big is the one that killed the
dinosaurs? Like five miles? Well,

762
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:30,750
that's thought to be 10 kilometers
wide. That that x miles, that,

763
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:34,920
that object ten six, six miles wide
at the times that, yeah. These things,

764
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,390
these things come in from deep space.
There are reservoirs of comets.

765
00:45:39,391 --> 00:45:41,370
There's a place that
they call the Oort cloud,

766
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:45,240
which is just so far away that it's
almost impossible to imagine it,

767
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,300
but it contains trillions of
comments and often they're,

768
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:51,870
they're in stable orbits. They're not
coming into the inner solar system.

769
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:56,700
But as this solar system orbits
around the center of the Galaxy,

770
00:45:56,701 --> 00:46:01,410
our galaxy is the Milky Way and we are
in orbit around the center of the galaxy,

771
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:04,890
our son, our solar system, everything is
in orbit around the center of the galaxy.

772
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:08,550
And that orbit is not only
in the plain of the galaxy.

773
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:11,430
Imagine a dolphin diving up and down,

774
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:16,020
coming out of the surface of the sea,
descending below, rising up again.

775
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,520
That's what the solar system is doing.

776
00:46:17,521 --> 00:46:22,521
And those passages through the galactic
plane disturb the Oort cloud and they

777
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:25,740
send comments winging in
to the inner solar system.

778
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:27,870
Thank God for Jupiter,

779
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:32,220
Jupiter with its huge gravity is
the great protector of the Earth.

780
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:37,110
We should all wake up every day and say,
thank you Jupiter, thank you Jupiter,

781
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:41,220
that this doesn't happen too often, but
every now and then a comet gets past you.

782
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:45,830
But as God and comes in and enters the
inner solar system and the calculations

783
00:46:45,831 --> 00:46:46,051
show.

784
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:50,130
This happened about 20,000 years ago
and that comment went into an orbit that

785
00:46:50,131 --> 00:46:52,890
crosses the orbit of
the Earth twice a year.

786
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:58,340
We are still crossing the orbit of that
comment twice a year and there is still

787
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,970
a very disturbing amount
of debris within it.

788
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,980
It's called the Taurid meteor stream.

789
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:09,510
We've actually just finished our latest
passage through the Taurid meteor stream.

790
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,600
The earth passes through the story
of meteor stream twice a year.

791
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,950
It takes 12 days to pass
through it because the Tory
media story more numbers is

792
00:47:16,951 --> 00:47:21,951
30 million kilometers wide and we orbit
at the rate of 2.5 million kilometers a

793
00:47:21,961 --> 00:47:22,794
day,

794
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:27,830
so 30 it took 12 days to pass through
it and in the last 11,000 or so years

795
00:47:28,831 --> 00:47:29,770
we've been lucky.

796
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:33,880
We've been passing through this
30 million mile wide stream.

797
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,910
We've been passing through bits where
they're just filaments of small debris,

798
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:41,200
but the evidence is that it is actually
full of large lucky rocky debris,

799
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:45,790
including one object that maybe as much
as 30 kilometers in diameter sitting in

800
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:47,020
that tour in meteor stream.

801
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:51,100
So it's like I compare
it to like strapping on a
blindfold and crossing a six

802
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:55,380
lane highway and just hoping that you
don't get hit by a truck. You know,

803
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,820
that's what it, that's what it
comes down to. And we've been,

804
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,890
we've been lucky so far.
Actually,

805
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:03,910
the most recent definite impact
from the Taurid meteor stream, uh,

806
00:48:03,911 --> 00:48:08,050
was in 1,908 and that
was in Russia in Siberia.

807
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,390
It's called the Tom Gasca event.
As I said,

808
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:13,000
there's two passages through the stream.
One in June,

809
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:14,980
end of June or early
July and one in November.

810
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:18,590
And this was at the end of June
and object, not very big. Uh,

811
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,450
about a hundred meters in diameter.
Came out of the Taurid meteor stream,

812
00:48:22,451 --> 00:48:25,720
entered the atmosphere of the earth
and actually blew up in the sky.

813
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:30,490
It was an air burst about five kilometers
where the ground it flattened 80

814
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,610
million trees across
2000 square kilometers.

815
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:37,000
I'm sorry I keep using kilometers was
2000 square kilometers of the earth's

816
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:40,300
surface. That's an area about
the size of the city of London.

817
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,420
If that impact had happened
over an inhabited area,

818
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:47,170
hundreds of thousands of people would be
killed and we would all be paying much

819
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:51,550
more attention to the Taurid meteor
stream today than we are presently doing.

820
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,110
We should be paying attention to it.

821
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:58,320
So we just got super lucky that it hit
in a very lightly populated area and it

822
00:48:58,391 --> 00:49:01,270
didn't even hit and blew up
in the sky above it. Pull up,

823
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:06,570
see if you can find some image of Tom
Guskey cause it's pretty staggering and it

824
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:12,900
literally looks like there was like a
match stick forest and someone pushed over

825
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:18,060
like a series of dominoes or something.
Yeah, yeah. Oh God. Jamie, Jamie,

826
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:22,320
Jamie is a wizard kids out
in the ball over there. Yeah.

827
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:24,940
So,
so here's the thing,

828
00:49:24,941 --> 00:49:29,941
we are still interacting with the debris
of this comment that changed the world.

829
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:35,860
12,800 years ago. It, it, it's
not something remote and distant.

830
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:39,050
It's part of our,
it's part of our daily lives and,

831
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:42,310
and it is something we should be paying
attention to and a number of astronomers

832
00:49:42,311 --> 00:49:45,190
are very concerned about
the tour it meteor stream.

833
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,380
Now I don't want to be the
one who goes around the world,

834
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:52,240
you know where in the Sandwich board
saying that doom is nigh, sky is falling.

835
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,120
Yeah. I don't want to be that.
I don't want to manifest that.

836
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:56,320
I don't want to bring that down.

837
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:59,530
I actually want to say that there's
something positive to say about this.

838
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:04,300
We are almost certainly the first
civilization that's ever existed on this

839
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:08,620
planet that has the capacity to
intervene in our cosmic environment.

840
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,240
Should we choose to do so.

841
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,980
We can make sure that we are
not the next loss civilization.

842
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:19,390
We can make sure that life and light
continue on this planet and that our story

843
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:23,320
continues, but we need to pay
attention to our cosmic environment.

844
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:27,260
And a number of scientists are
now saying the same thing, that,

845
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:32,290
that it's irresponsible of us to pretend
that impacts like this may they just

846
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:35,660
happen every hundred million years.
We don't need to worry about them.

847
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,760
We are intimately connected with a force
that can change life on earth and we

848
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:45,470
have the power to do something about it.
So I would suggest instead of wasting,

849
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,070
you know, trillions of
dollars globally, uh,

850
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:52,200
creating weapons of mass destruction
to destroy one another and to,

851
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,240
to manifest the hatred and
fear and suspicion that had
just whizzing around the

852
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:59,330
world. Right now we should be
looking at a grand human project,

853
00:50:59,331 --> 00:51:02,540
a cooperative effort to make
our cosmic environment safe.

854
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:05,000
And we have the technology now.
It's just a matter of choice.

855
00:51:05,001 --> 00:51:06,170
It's just a matter of budget.

856
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:11,120
Trillions of dollars are spent on arms
and roughly 20 to $30 million are spent a

857
00:51:11,121 --> 00:51:13,310
year on so-called space watch.

858
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,990
It's a ridiculous of chump change
given the nature of the threat and the

859
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:18,824
implications

860
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:23,620
about the same as the cost to run one
Mcdonald's restaurant for a year is what

861
00:51:23,621 --> 00:51:28,150
we're spending on studying the cosmic
environment in terms of threats.

862
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:30,790
That's a hilarious comparison.
Yeah.

863
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,150
What a resourceful little
freaky animal people are.

864
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,170
If you really stop and think about it
almost wiped off the face of the planet,

865
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,410
you know,
ten thousand twelve thousand years ago.

866
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,910
And then we reach a point where here
we are in 2015 and through all these

867
00:51:45,911 --> 00:51:50,911
inventions were starting to rediscover
what our history truly is and rediscover

868
00:51:51,461 --> 00:51:53,850
the, the history of
the earth and, and its,

869
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,370
its interplay with all these
cosmic forces, you know,

870
00:51:57,371 --> 00:52:00,660
modern humans but have now 199,000

871
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,660
yeah.
The earliest,

872
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:06,520
I mean the earliest definite anatomically
modern human skeletal remains date

873
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:08,680
back about 196,000 years.

874
00:52:08,681 --> 00:52:13,240
There's some other plausible ones at
about 210,000 years. Nothing before that.

875
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,900
It doesn't mean that we were not
anatomically modern before that.

876
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:20,020
It may just mean that archaeologists
haven't found that the data yet,

877
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:25,290
but we can be sure that people like
you and me have been around for about

878
00:52:25,961 --> 00:52:30,160
200,000 years with the anatomically
modern form and the anatomically modern

879
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:32,110
brain.
So there's a mystery right there.

880
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:37,710
Why did we wait 190,000 years to
establish the first civilizations?

881
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:39,030
It,

882
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:43,600
it raises the possibility that we could
have done so much earlier and that the

883
00:52:43,601 --> 00:52:44,830
slate has been wiped clean.

884
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,160
Think about it this way,
Joe.

885
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:51,340
My grandfather was born in 1895 the
main mode of transportation aside from

886
00:52:51,471 --> 00:52:56,080
railroads at that time, was horseback,
right? His grandfather, you know,

887
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:59,420
would've been born pre civil war.
So when five generations,

888
00:52:59,421 --> 00:53:02,320
we've gone from the very first railroads,

889
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:06,020
the beginning of the industrial
revolution to where we are now in five

890
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:09,740
generations. Now, if you
go back 200,000 years,

891
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:14,830
say 196,000 and we divide that by 25 I
love and random breaks out there looking

892
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,060
at it almost,

893
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:22,390
we're looking at almost 8,000
generations of humans. Wow. Yeah.

894
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:26,250
Now think about that. Within
five generations. We've gone from

895
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:31,110
90% dominant agriculturally
based subsistence farming,

896
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,260
right feudal system to where we are now.

897
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:39,860
But now we've got 8,000 generations of
humans on this planet who knows what we

898
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:46,120
may have accomplished in the past.
But once you put this perspective and,

899
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,900
and you got to understand that the,
that the catastrophe,

900
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:51,150
we're talking about 12,000 years ago,

901
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:55,050
while all the evidence suggests
it was the most severe,

902
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:59,850
probably at least within 5 million years
because the last time we can find a

903
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:04,880
species loss equivalent to the terminal
pleistocene species loss was 5 million

904
00:54:05,671 --> 00:54:08,730
years ago. The hamp helion
event it's called, um,

905
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:11,280
which then I would then
consider that again is a,

906
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:14,130
is a measuring stick for habitat loss,

907
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:18,300
which would in turn be a measure of
the severity of whatever happened.

908
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:23,670
But the point is, is that in the
time that we humans have been around,

909
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,670
there have been multiple
catastrophes of a global scale.

910
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:30,650
Not as severe as the one we're
talking about here, but certainly the,

911
00:54:30,651 --> 00:54:34,200
the framework of this planet
has been shaken numerous times.

912
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:36,360
And in 200,000 years,

913
00:54:36,361 --> 00:54:41,310
we've had probably four great glacial
cycles that have come and gone. Now,

914
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:44,280
just a glacial cycle alone.
I mean, think about that,

915
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:47,840
what the ice will do to the landscape and,

916
00:54:47,841 --> 00:54:51,840
and dropping sea levels 400
feet and now during an ice age,

917
00:54:51,841 --> 00:54:54,990
you've got to bear in mind that probably
the most habitable place to be on the

918
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:59,610
plan that is going to be on coastlines
along the miles of rivers and so forth.

919
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:04,470
What happens when all that ice melts
and sea level comes up three or 400 feet

920
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:07,230
and,
and it's going to pretty much a race,

921
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:11,550
most of the evidence of human habitation.
Although,

922
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,390
and I think I talked about this last
time and you would probably concur with

923
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:19,930
this, the importance of marine
archeology. It's extremely important. Yes.

924
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:24,330
But again, unfortunately, marine
archeology has its eye off the ball.

925
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,410
Most of the resources in Marina killogy
going to shipwrecks looking for looking

926
00:55:28,411 --> 00:55:30,630
for shipwrecks. Right.
Um, and, and you know,

927
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,270
I get that it's a really interesting
to look at shipwrecks, but,

928
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,690
but there is a prejudice in archeology
which says that could have been no

929
00:55:36,691 --> 00:55:40,890
interesting civilization before
12,000 years ago. So since the,

930
00:55:40,891 --> 00:55:44,850
those lands that were submerged by rising
sea levels had been underwater for 10

931
00:55:44,851 --> 00:55:49,270
to 12,000 years, we're not
really interested in human
habitations there. And, and,

932
00:55:49,271 --> 00:55:50,250
and this is the problem,

933
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,570
a very focused effort needs to be
made to look at these lost lands.

934
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,290
I can put that in miles, 10 million
square miles of the earth's surface,

935
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:02,670
roughly Europe and China added together
was submerged by the rising sea levels

936
00:56:02,671 --> 00:56:07,150
at the end of the last ice age.
That's what's missing from the record.

937
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,240
You know, and, and again,

938
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:12,180
we're talking about wiping the
slate clean and rattles right.

939
00:56:12,181 --> 00:56:16,500
Those ice caps that sit on top of a
continent, which are mountain high,

940
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:20,010
they're going to just
ground grind to powder,

941
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,400
anything that lies below them.
So was there a civilization there before

942
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,020
where the ice cap formed?
Who knows,

943
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,260
right. Yeah. A mile high of ice. Yeah.

944
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,680
Even more in some cases
over over central Canada,

945
00:56:31,681 --> 00:56:34,160
it might've been as much as two miles,
two miles,

946
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:39,770
just pushing across the ground like an
eraser. Exactly. Writing everything,

947
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,060
crushing the surface of the ground down.
I think in our discussions of Atlantis,

948
00:56:44,061 --> 00:56:46,990
we covered that a little bit.
Crushing the surface of the, uh,

949
00:56:46,991 --> 00:56:51,590
of the land down by perhaps a couple
of thousand feet. Isostatic depression.

950
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:56,180
You remember the geology lesson I
gave you last time about icer static

951
00:56:56,181 --> 00:57:00,680
depression and we discussed how at
this very moment the your ass is

952
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:04,080
demonstrating an important
geological phenomena of Isis,

953
00:57:04,081 --> 00:57:08,270
static depression sitting on net cushion
cause you're sitting on and if you were

954
00:57:08,271 --> 00:57:12,320
to stand up, what happens when you stand
up? The cushion comes back up, doesn't it?

955
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:13,790
It's exactly what happens.

956
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:17,510
And you can almost picture the planet
breathing and affect the, the, the,

957
00:57:17,511 --> 00:57:20,120
the ice is released from
the continental surface.

958
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,460
The continental surface begins to rebound.

959
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:27,490
The weight is transferred back into the
ocean basins and there has to be that

960
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,000
what's called Realogy,

961
00:57:29,001 --> 00:57:33,230
which is the study of the distribution
of the inner mass of the earth requires

962
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,150
that there be compensation.

963
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:39,560
So if if in one area of the surface
the land is rising somewhere else,

964
00:57:39,561 --> 00:57:41,540
it has to be subsiding.

965
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,050
And the obvious place would be that
as you transfer the weight from the

966
00:57:45,051 --> 00:57:49,970
continent back into the ocean basins, that
the ocean basins are going to subside.

967
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:53,590
And this brings us to the
whole question of, of, of uh,

968
00:57:53,591 --> 00:57:57,920
of the scientific veracity of,
of a sunken landmass.

969
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:01,760
You're thinking, you have an interesting
point on the age of yours in this,

970
00:58:01,761 --> 00:58:03,680
in this sense,
because then you have this massive,

971
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:07,940
it's like a see saw that you have this
massive weight pressing down on the North

972
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,970
American continent and suddenly
it's lifted that, that,

973
00:58:10,971 --> 00:58:14,990
that massive weight pushed down North
America, but it lifted up other areas.

974
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:17,870
The other end of the seesaw
and the weight comes off,

975
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,920
this end goes up and the other end
goes down and suddenly you get the

976
00:58:21,921 --> 00:58:26,060
possibility of the submergence of a
land mass. It just falls under the sea.

977
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:31,400
And there is actually
considerable empirical evidence
suggesting that there was

978
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:35,450
massive post glacial subsidence
along the Mid Atlantic Ridge,

979
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:37,530
which is where the are. Yeah. Yeah.

980
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,290
And which is pretty much were
Plato said Atlanta's work. Yeah.

981
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:45,710
Wasn't there some discovery of some
concentric circles that were submerged

982
00:58:45,711 --> 00:58:48,560
somewhere near Spain that they
considered to be a possible

983
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:54,000
Cadiz? Um, I don't think that
near Spain. Yeah, it's, it's um,

984
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,210
I think it's much more recent. Okay.
Much, much more recent than the,

985
00:58:57,211 --> 00:59:02,050
than the information we're looking
at another, yeah, that was submerged.

986
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:05,760
That was so much, that can be a lot of
reasons why this, why, why this happens.

987
00:59:05,761 --> 00:59:06,810
Actually it's happening in the,

988
00:59:06,811 --> 00:59:11,040
in the UK where I'm from because the ice
sheets in the UK where on the north of

989
00:59:11,041 --> 00:59:11,551
the UK,

990
00:59:11,551 --> 00:59:16,050
over Scotland and they were pressing
Scotland down and they closed the southern

991
00:59:16,051 --> 00:59:19,530
part of England to rise up.
Then when you take those ice sheets off,

992
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:21,590
the southern part starts go down.

993
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,810
So that's places like the isle
of wight in the English Channel,

994
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:25,510
they're sinking beneath
the sea because of this.

995
00:59:25,511 --> 00:59:27,820
Still the effect of that
rebound is happening to them.

996
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:33,000
Glacial four bulge
outside the, the glaciers.

997
00:59:33,001 --> 00:59:35,250
The land is pushed up.
You know,

998
00:59:35,251 --> 00:59:39,720
this speaks to how people have a
hard time accepting some of this new

999
00:59:39,721 --> 00:59:43,380
information. I have a friend
who's a scientist and a,
the last time you were on,

1000
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:48,000
she said to me, did you have
a climate denier on your show?

1001
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:52,480
A climate change denier? And I say that
he's definitely not denying it. No,

1002
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:59,150
but some people, that's all they
hear. When you bring forth, uh,

1003
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:04,560
a non mainstream point of view
or a controversial perspective,

1004
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:09,330
instead of considering the possibility,
it almost immediately gets dismissed.

1005
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:12,730
This climate change thing is another
ideological struggle. Yeah, sure.

1006
01:00:12,731 --> 01:00:15,580
Climate change is taking place, but
what are the causes for this? You know,

1007
01:00:15,581 --> 01:00:18,220
are we so sure that it's
all caused by human beings?

1008
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:23,230
I would say there's very good reason for
humanity to clean up our act in lots of

1009
01:00:23,231 --> 01:00:26,440
ways. Regardless of the issue of
climate change we're living, we're,

1010
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:30,040
we're abusing mother earth. We are
living upon this planet, uh, like,

1011
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:32,110
like parasites and,
and destroying it.

1012
01:00:32,111 --> 01:00:35,200
We thoughtlessly create
this gigantic pools of,

1013
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,900
of pollution where we're crazy enough,

1014
01:00:37,901 --> 01:00:41,140
insane enough to actually invent
nuclear weapons and you know,

1015
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:46,120
long periods of detonate that like
of things, you know, this is the,

1016
01:00:46,121 --> 01:00:50,320
the lots about our behavior that we
need to fix because it's right to fix it

1017
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:52,750
philosophically, right? We
should not behave that way.

1018
01:00:52,751 --> 01:00:54,430
We should not behave
that way to one another.

1019
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,530
We should not behave
that way to planet earth.

1020
01:00:56,710 --> 01:01:00,100
But to say that we need to fix our
behavior because of global warming,

1021
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:05,110
that's an ideological argument. And that
argument remains to be properly tested.

1022
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:08,470
Yes, global warming is occurring, but are
we the cause of it or is something else,

1023
01:01:08,471 --> 01:01:11,510
some, some grander scale
cosmic effect involved in this?

1024
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,890
We talked about that considerably. And
I noticed in a lot of the comments from,

1025
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:20,450
from our last discussion, most of
the critical comments where people,

1026
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:22,003
you know,

1027
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:26,390
not liking the idea that I had
questioned the dogma of global warming,

1028
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:29,290
but there are some facts
that you can't escape. No.

1029
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,340
The global warming again 200 years ago,

1030
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:35,270
and we see that the glaciers from the
little ice age began to shrink back.

1031
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:38,570
And your early 19th century
before there was, you know,

1032
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:43,190
a century before there was any significant
human contract contribution of co two

1033
01:01:43,191 --> 01:01:47,960
to the atmosphere. So something was
driving that warming that began.

1034
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:53,260
And it's important to realize that the
little ice age was probably the coldest

1035
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:57,050
period since the end of the great ice age.
In fact,

1036
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,370
the data overwhelmingly supports that
end that the glaciers grew to their

1037
01:02:01,371 --> 01:02:04,250
largest extent around the
planet and 10,000 years.

1038
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:06,590
So when we're talking
about glacier recession,

1039
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,500
it's important to understand
what the baseline is.

1040
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:13,550
Our baseline in this case is the biggest,
the glaciers have been in 10,000 years.

1041
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,190
And what's interesting,
and this is going on right now,

1042
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,170
as the glaciers had been receding,

1043
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:23,600
geologists and biologists
and and glaciologists and
so forth have been studying,

1044
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:29,070
um, the landscapes that are being revealed
as the ice shrinks back. And you know,

1045
01:02:29,071 --> 01:02:34,071
what they're finding is the remains of
forests that had been overrun by the

1046
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:37,020
Little Ice Age glaciers
up, you know, and, and,

1047
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:42,060
and peat bogs and things that would
suggest that prior to the onset of the

1048
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:43,260
little ice age,

1049
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:48,260
those valleys that were filled
with ice from roughly 1400 to 1800,

1050
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:54,110
we're actually forested because the ice
came down and overran these forests and

1051
01:02:54,151 --> 01:02:57,990
now it's receding back and revealing
that there were forests there.

1052
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,450
So that tells you that,
you know, at some point,

1053
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:05,030
probably going back to the medieval
warm period, those areas that were,

1054
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:09,210
that have been glaciated during the early
part of the 20th century were actually

1055
01:03:09,211 --> 01:03:14,160
free of ice. And so, you know, the
climate has been extremely dynamic.

1056
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:18,540
That's the thing we have to emphasize all
by itself without any help from humans.

1057
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:23,970
And this is what I've been saying is that
we have to look at that and realize it.

1058
01:03:23,971 --> 01:03:26,190
Yeah, humans are a factor. You know,

1059
01:03:26,191 --> 01:03:30,630
somebody I did post and said all the
other factors I had mentioned as you know,

1060
01:03:30,631 --> 01:03:34,890
ocean currents and wind currents and
geomagnetic field and cosmic rays and

1061
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:38,280
volcanism and all that.
It all been investigated in dismissed.

1062
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:42,630
And the only thing left was the
human contribution. But you know,

1063
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:43,740
to me that's really,

1064
01:03:43,741 --> 01:03:46,920
we're putting all our eggs in that
basket and that could turn out to be very

1065
01:03:46,921 --> 01:03:51,921
dangerous because we're so focused now
on our own contribution that we might be

1066
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:56,850
overlooking the fact that there have been
natural factors driving climate change

1067
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:58,860
over and over and over again.
I mean,

1068
01:03:58,861 --> 01:04:03,861
because I still have not heard any
consensus on what has caused the planet to

1069
01:04:04,711 --> 01:04:08,220
first go into an ice age and
come back out of an ice age.

1070
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:12,660
And I think that would bring him and I
are talking about actually presents a

1071
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:16,710
possible solution to what could have
brought this planet out of the Ice Age.

1072
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:19,260
Something on a grand cosmic scale.

1073
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:23,550
And the other point I think I'd like
to make is that we have to really to

1074
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:25,620
understand our planet as a system,

1075
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:30,780
we have to realize that it's part of a
cosmic ecosystem and the cosmos has been

1076
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:34,710
a much bigger player in what's been
going on down here than has been a

1077
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:37,290
previously understood or appreciated.

1078
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,960
And I think our ancestors probably did

1079
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:44,890
Tuesday, they did understand it.
They, the focus on the skies,

1080
01:04:44,891 --> 01:04:49,000
if you go back into ancient times, is
so strong. This notion of as above.

1081
01:04:49,001 --> 01:04:52,330
So below that we are connected
to the cosmos. This is,

1082
01:04:52,331 --> 01:04:55,030
this is something that we are tending
to forget in the modern world again

1083
01:04:55,031 --> 01:04:58,290
because we're so puffed up with pride
anywhere we can't see the sky if they live

1084
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:02,020
in sending a big issue. Collusion, it's
just like a haze up there. We don't,

1085
01:05:02,021 --> 01:05:03,840
we don't, we don't, we
don't see anything. So we,

1086
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:08,660
we're actually cut off from the cosmos
it psychologically. And that's a,

1087
01:05:08,661 --> 01:05:12,430
that's a mistake because we are part
of this giant cosmic environment and it

1088
01:05:12,431 --> 01:05:12,971
affects us.

1089
01:05:12,971 --> 01:05:16,150
And one of the way it affects us is the
way that comments come into the inner

1090
01:05:16,151 --> 01:05:18,430
solar system from to time,
from deep space.

1091
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:21,730
I was camping in Montana recently and uh,

1092
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,390
you know when you're out at night and
you look at that night sky and there's no

1093
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:26,370
light pollution.
Yeah,

1094
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:31,450
it's just a totally different perspective
and it gives you a different sense of

1095
01:05:31,451 --> 01:05:35,500
where you are in the universe
because we're so, and it's not a,

1096
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,150
it's not necessarily our fault.

1097
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:41,560
It's almost like we've put up a curtain
over the heavens and we can't see

1098
01:05:41,561 --> 01:05:45,370
through the curtain because we've decided
that we like light and we like traffic

1099
01:05:45,371 --> 01:05:48,040
lights and you know,
building lights and all this jazz.

1100
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:52,800
And we don't realize until we're out in
the woods or in the wild until you were

1101
01:05:52,801 --> 01:05:54,400
in the wilderness and
there's no light pollution,

1102
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:58,120
you really don't realize
what we're missing and what
we're sacrificing in order

1103
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:01,210
to have these lights. The
view of the heavens. It's,

1104
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:05,770
it's so it's psychedelic in a way you
back cause it makes you feel like,

1105
01:06:05,771 --> 01:06:09,070
oh my God, we're really
flying through space and nice.

1106
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:12,760
That by the nature has provided us
with those plots that really help us to

1107
01:06:12,761 --> 01:06:13,561
appreciate it from him.

1108
01:06:13,561 --> 01:06:17,530
I tried to go every year to the
Keck observatory on the big island.

1109
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:22,590
I tried to schedule my a holidays as
much as possible around the time where

1110
01:06:22,691 --> 01:06:27,691
there's no moon because it is unbelievable
because the Keck observatory is more

1111
01:06:28,811 --> 01:06:30,520
than 9,000 feet above sea.

1112
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:33,610
If there's a visitor center and then
there's the observatories above,

1113
01:06:33,611 --> 01:06:37,590
but you really don't even know have to
go past the visitor center. But they're,

1114
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:39,100
the way they have it set up,

1115
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:44,110
they have these special streetlights all
throughout the pig island with diffused

1116
01:06:44,111 --> 01:06:46,030
lighting.
So it doesn't interfere.

1117
01:06:46,031 --> 01:06:49,740
It doesn't give you light pollution and
when you're up there, you're, you're,

1118
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:53,560
you go through the clouds
and the view is insane.

1119
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:58,390
If it doesn't look real, it doesn't even
look real. Like you see all the stars,

1120
01:06:58,391 --> 01:07:01,150
you're like, this can't be real.
How could this be up there?

1121
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:03,100
Every day and we don't see it.

1122
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:08,290
But what we've done is create
all this incredible stuff,

1123
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:13,390
these streets and buildings and
laptops and cell phones and in the,

1124
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:16,800
in doing so we have robbed
ourselves. Have a perspective. Yeah.

1125
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:18,010
It's weird because you know,
we,

1126
01:07:18,011 --> 01:07:21,390
we have this technology that enables
us to go around the whole world and,

1127
01:07:21,391 --> 01:07:25,240
and even go out into outer
space. But actually we, in a way,

1128
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,160
it's narrowed our focus. We, we, we've,

1129
01:07:27,161 --> 01:07:31,240
we focus in on the all the technology
and its products and we forget about the

1130
01:07:31,241 --> 01:07:35,740
majestic cosmic and earth environment
in which we, in which we live,

1131
01:07:35,741 --> 01:07:39,580
how sacred it is, how beautiful it
is, how meaningful it is to all of us.

1132
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:42,190
And that was the image that
our ancestors always had.

1133
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:45,040
That's probably why they
concentrated on it so much.

1134
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:48,250
And the things that happened up
there were evident to them. I mean,

1135
01:07:48,251 --> 01:07:50,050
because these days,

1136
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:54,580
how many people see meteors
living in an urban environment?

1137
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:58,690
You never see that hardly unless it's
really spectacular. But you go out,

1138
01:07:58,691 --> 01:08:02,440
like you said in Montana or the one of
my favorite places to garden into high

1139
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:04,750
desert country and there you really,

1140
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:08,110
it's well the stars or how much you
can reach out and touch him. You know,

1141
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:11,770
I think that one of the most important
things that we could do for future

1142
01:08:11,771 --> 01:08:16,250
generations is part of our educational
curriculum for young people

1143
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:19,520
is get them out of the cds into nature,

1144
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:24,380
into the tremendous, you know,
where they can actually see the sky.

1145
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:27,440
Because I mean, I'm living in
Atlanta, I'll talk to people,

1146
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:31,910
even grown up people that have have
no clue. I have no clue. You know,

1147
01:08:31,911 --> 01:08:34,250
you couldn't,
they couldn't find the north star,

1148
01:08:34,251 --> 01:08:38,210
they couldn't find the plane
of the ecliptic if their
life depended on it. They,

1149
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:41,870
you know, they're just, we've, we've
become cut off from that level.

1150
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:42,980
And I think that that's,

1151
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:47,840
it's important for us to keep that because
our consciousness is linked to this

1152
01:08:47,841 --> 01:08:52,430
greater domain and, and we have
segregated ourselves from that. And,

1153
01:08:52,431 --> 01:08:55,880
and I think that there's something
there, you know, amazingly, it's a,

1154
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:59,170
it's a grounding experience.
When you get out in you,

1155
01:08:59,190 --> 01:09:03,350
you begin to see the sky and
you can actually, um, you know,

1156
01:09:03,351 --> 01:09:07,880
begin to figure out in, in
identify the constellations. Um,

1157
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:13,090
you know, to, to know where the planets
are to, to look in the sky in, in

1158
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:14,550
good mental exercise.

1159
01:09:14,551 --> 01:09:18,060
It's something with anybody doing get
to grips with all that up there as the

1160
01:09:18,061 --> 01:09:20,310
ancients did,
it gets your mind working.

1161
01:09:20,311 --> 01:09:24,090
And it may even have been
used deliberately for that
purpose in ancient times.

1162
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:27,840
People kind of initiation system. If you
can get this, then you move on to the,

1163
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:31,520
to the next level. You know, that's the,
that's the, that's the kind of idea.

1164
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:36,300
It was a critical part of education where
it's very rarely even discussed today.

1165
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:40,530
And look again at the ideology.
So for example,

1166
01:09:40,590 --> 01:09:45,260
if you talk about astrology to any most,
any mainstream scientists,

1167
01:09:45,261 --> 01:09:46,320
they're going to laugh in your face.

1168
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:50,790
And you've got to say pseudoscience
because they're so locked into this earth

1169
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:52,590
centered perspective that which,

1170
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:57,360
which convinces them that the
cosmos does have no effect on us.

1171
01:09:57,361 --> 01:10:01,140
So how can changing patterns of the
stars that that which is a dye called

1172
01:10:01,141 --> 01:10:03,180
constellation is sitting behind
the sign at a particular time.

1173
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:06,690
How can that effect us?
How can when we were born effect us?

1174
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,560
I don't think we should throw that
baby out with the bath water too fast.

1175
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,930
I think we're looking at an
ancient science with, uh,

1176
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:15,140
with astrology and I think it's worth it.

1177
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:19,150
It's been heavily diluted and
prostituted in the modern world debate.

1178
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:20,850
But if you go back to the antiquity,

1179
01:10:20,851 --> 01:10:23,580
you go back to the real origins of
this and you start finding some very

1180
01:10:23,581 --> 01:10:25,050
interesting information coming out.

1181
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:29,070
There's a fantastic book by a guy called
Rick Tarnas called Cosmos and psyche

1182
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:32,610
and he's a real mainstream,
a very major academic.

1183
01:10:32,611 --> 01:10:34,710
And he's got into this and
he's shown that actually, yeah,

1184
01:10:34,711 --> 01:10:37,200
astrology does have effects.
So we should not,

1185
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:39,510
we should not deny our cosmic environment.

1186
01:10:39,511 --> 01:10:41,280
That's the first thing we
need to do to connect to it.

1187
01:10:41,281 --> 01:10:45,720
And we shouldn't close ourselves off
to avenues of inquiry for ideological

1188
01:10:45,721 --> 01:10:46,251
reasons.
It's,

1189
01:10:46,251 --> 01:10:50,760
it's noticeable in this field of ancient
history how archeologists throw around

1190
01:10:50,761 --> 01:10:54,330
words like pseudo archeologist
or pseudo scientists.

1191
01:10:54,331 --> 01:10:57,410
That's meant to be an instant
dismissal just like climate deniers,

1192
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:01,110
climate denier. You call somebody a
climate denier today. That's like saying,

1193
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:04,500
don't listen to anything that guy has
to say, never listened to it. Again,

1194
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:08,820
these are ideological tools which are
being used to straight jacket the human

1195
01:11:08,821 --> 01:11:12,780
mind and to stop us thinking outside the
box and if there's ever a time where we

1196
01:11:12,781 --> 01:11:14,250
needed think outside the box.

1197
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,480
I would say that time is right now.

1198
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:20,520
Isn't it ironic that in this time of
more information available to the average

1199
01:11:20,521 --> 01:11:21,660
person than ever before,

1200
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,840
that this also has coincided with our
lack of appreciation for what's above us.

1201
01:11:27,390 --> 01:11:30,630
It's very strange that it's
a very curious phenomenon.

1202
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:33,030
Here's an interesting perspective.
You know,

1203
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:37,290
as we're talking about how dynamic the
plan it is and how it's changed and how

1204
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:39,270
dramatically different which it is.
I mean,

1205
01:11:39,271 --> 01:11:42,660
if we go back to the end of the ice
age, you know, you go east of here,

1206
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:46,380
a lot of the Mojave desert that
was lush grasslands and forests,

1207
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:48,930
you out here to the Santa Rosa Islands,
you know,

1208
01:11:48,931 --> 01:11:53,890
out here they were all forested with
oak trees and beech trees and, and uh,

1209
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:58,380
mammoth mammoth, this Exilis, which was
the pygmy mammoth. You know, I mean,

1210
01:11:58,381 --> 01:12:00,810
everything down here changes dramatically.

1211
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,970
But when we go out and we look at the sky,

1212
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:07,650
we're basically seeing the same sky
that our ancestors have 20,000 years ago

1213
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:11,790
were looking at. And that's something to
keep in mind because there is something,

1214
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:15,930
there's a backdrop to all of
this drama and change here below.

1215
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:18,900
That's pretty much for the most part,
remained consistent.

1216
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:24,000
But within that backdrop of consistency,
every once in a while something shifts.

1217
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:25,830
And when it shifts out there,

1218
01:12:25,831 --> 01:12:30,060
I think our ancestors knew that there
was a direct consequence here below.

1219
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:32,850
And that's one of the reasons
they were so obsessed with,

1220
01:12:32,851 --> 01:12:36,690
with being able to track
motion. Um, you know,

1221
01:12:36,691 --> 01:12:41,370
all of these ancient observatories
from Stonehenge on down the line to,

1222
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,390
you know, the, the, the mountain
structures here in North America.

1223
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:47,600
Let's not forget it. Go back to the
Tempe. Profoundly astronomical science.

1224
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:48,660
Real Beckley Tepi yes,

1225
01:12:48,661 --> 01:12:53,010
these were astronomical observatories
using the horizon essentially as a

1226
01:12:53,011 --> 01:12:58,011
telescope by which very
intimate and intricate movements
within that backdrop of

1227
01:12:58,861 --> 01:13:03,861
fixed stars could actually be observed
possibly for predictive capabilities.

1228
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:10,380
And how are the calculations may like
an archeologist finds a site like go

1229
01:13:10,381 --> 01:13:11,670
Beverly, go, go Beckley.

1230
01:13:11,671 --> 01:13:15,870
Tappy how do they correlate
the construction of the
site with the Constellation?

1231
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:17,820
Fist off, mo, most archaeologists don't,

1232
01:13:17,821 --> 01:13:21,480
don't do that at all because they just
don't do astronomy. They don't get it.

1233
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:25,020
They have their eyes are on the ground
at their feet to the disciplines because

1234
01:13:25,021 --> 01:13:26,760
astronomy is not relevant to them.

1235
01:13:26,910 --> 01:13:29,970
They project that onto the past and
imagined that it was not relevant to the

1236
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:32,820
past. And that's one of the big
mistakes I think that it makes.

1237
01:13:32,821 --> 01:13:35,230
There are people call dot Kao Astronomy's,
uh,

1238
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,560
who are looking at the
astronomy of ancient cultures.

1239
01:13:37,561 --> 01:13:41,240
And some of them have done very good work.
But really there,

1240
01:13:41,241 --> 01:13:45,510
there are certain key indicators,
um, eh, the alignment of the site,

1241
01:13:45,511 --> 01:13:49,900
what's it pointing at and does that
alignment change down the ages? Um,

1242
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:51,530
you can sometimes establish that a,

1243
01:13:51,531 --> 01:13:54,900
that a particular access of a particular
template in Egypt for example,

1244
01:13:54,901 --> 01:13:59,700
was shifted over a period of two or
3000 years, several times. And why?

1245
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:03,660
Because they were tracking the changing
rising point of the star Sirius,

1246
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:08,550
which they connected in their
system of ideas to the goddess Isis.

1247
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,190
They were tracking that
point which changes

1248
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:15,730
because of changes in in the sky.
I mean the long story short,

1249
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:19,840
the earth wobbles on its axis and that
since the earth is our viewing platform

1250
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:21,280
from which we observe the stars,

1251
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:25,180
changes of orientation of
the earth in space do change.

1252
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:29,790
The rising times of particular stars
at particular times of year and, and a,

1253
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,930
this was clearly tracked by the ancient.

1254
01:14:31,931 --> 01:14:36,340
So you can say that if you find anywhere
a monument that is perfectly aligned to

1255
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:37,990
true north, south, east, and West,

1256
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:40,870
you can be absolutely sure
that astronomers were involved.

1257
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:44,470
If it's tracking the rising sun on the
spring equinox or on the winter or summer

1258
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:48,130
solstice, astronomers were there.
They were right there when they met,

1259
01:14:48,131 --> 01:14:49,300
they made that monument.
Well,

1260
01:14:49,301 --> 01:14:52,270
that's one of the scariest that we're
not the scariest but most astounding

1261
01:14:52,271 --> 01:14:55,570
things when you consider the ancients
that they had an understanding of the

1262
01:14:55,571 --> 01:15:00,020
procession of the equinoxes,
which is what it was a 26,000 years.

1263
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:03,510
So 26,000 year cycle,
25,920 years.

1264
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:06,520
How the very long,

1265
01:15:06,521 --> 01:15:11,521
very precise observations and the motive
to make those observations that this

1266
01:15:12,071 --> 01:15:16,990
was important to them and they sought
to pass down that importance to us.

1267
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:22,350
Um, very important work by two historians
of science called Giorgio decentered,

1268
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:26,410
Yana and Hertha von Deshint back in the
60s they wrote a book called Hamlet's

1269
01:15:26,411 --> 01:15:30,340
mill, which tracks this ancient knowledge
of precession and they trace it back.

1270
01:15:30,341 --> 01:15:33,680
And this was very politically uncorrect
at that time because George has said,

1271
01:15:33,681 --> 01:15:37,690
Alana, so the Santee Deanna
was the professor of the
history of science at Mit.

1272
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:43,020
They trace it back to what they call
some almost unbelievable civilization of

1273
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:46,290
pre historic antiquity
that made the subsidy.

1274
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:51,330
They found the data encoded in myths
and traditions all around the world.

1275
01:15:51,551 --> 01:15:53,950
And I do go into this in
magicians of the gods. They,

1276
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:58,420
they found it encoded as though the
data was so important that it had to be

1277
01:15:58,421 --> 01:15:59,560
passed down to the future.

1278
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,710
So the numbers that relate to
precession of the equinoxes,

1279
01:16:02,711 --> 01:16:06,940
and they're all based on the number
72 and multiples of that number. Why?

1280
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:12,150
Because it takes 72 years for one
degree of processional change to unfold.

1281
01:16:12,821 --> 01:16:15,520
And that's like holding your
finger up to the horizon.

1282
01:16:15,521 --> 01:16:18,880
That one degree is just that one
finger width of change on the horizon.

1283
01:16:18,881 --> 01:16:21,010
Very precise observations
and needed to do it.

1284
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,810
It's encoded and miss and traditions.

1285
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:28,050
And it looks like somebody at some
point decided this information is so

1286
01:16:28,091 --> 01:16:32,110
important, we must make sure that it
stays permanently in human culture.

1287
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:36,220
So what we're gonna do is we're
going to encode it in great stories,

1288
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:41,410
and those stories can then be passed on
by storytellers who will have an ethic

1289
01:16:41,411 --> 01:16:43,270
that they must tell the story.
True.

1290
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,690
It doesn't matter whether they understand
the scientific information in the

1291
01:16:46,691 --> 01:16:49,660
story or not.
All that matters is that they pass it on.

1292
01:16:49,661 --> 01:16:52,240
And so in the oldest myths
and traditions of mankind,

1293
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:56,410
we have compelling evidence for scientific
knowledge of the phenomenon that we

1294
01:16:56,411 --> 01:17:00,120
call the precession of the
equinoxes today, which has
been referred to by, by, um,

1295
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:03,140
in Hamlet's mill is the great year,
a great year,

1296
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:06,550
which is the full cycle,
25,000,

1297
01:17:06,551 --> 01:17:10,040
920 years a great circle in the heavens.

1298
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:13,250
It's very evident if you've got
thousands of years to watch.

1299
01:17:13,251 --> 01:17:16,020
The Sky is very evident at the pole.
Um,

1300
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:19,130
our Pollstar presently is Polaris,

1301
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:23,210
and that's just simply
because the extended North
Pole of the earth points most

1302
01:17:23,211 --> 01:17:26,140
directly at that particular
star in the sky. Uh,

1303
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,560
but it hasn't always pointed at Polaris
because of the wobble on the axis of the

1304
01:17:30,561 --> 01:17:34,730
earth. And it won't always
point at Polaris in the
future, the Pollstar changes,

1305
01:17:34,731 --> 01:17:38,060
but you need to observe the skies
for very long periods of time.

1306
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:41,180
Keep detailed records to get
to grips with this phenomenon.

1307
01:17:41,181 --> 01:17:45,890
This debt therefore testifies to the
fact that some ancient culture was doing

1308
01:17:45,891 --> 01:17:47,750
this in a very systematic way.

1309
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:53,020
It's like a ghostly fingerprint of an
advanced scientific knowledge impressed

1310
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:57,650
upon the oldest myths and traditions of
our planet. Has it been six? I'm sorry.

1311
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:01,220
Is it it, has it been accepted that
things like the Mayan temples were,

1312
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:04,940
were built to mirror the constellations
cause that except it has been accepted?

1313
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,350
Yeah,
it is.

1314
01:18:06,351 --> 01:18:10,220
It is accepted because we know that the
Maya where we're an astronomical culture

1315
01:18:10,221 --> 01:18:13,370
and it is, it is accepted that
they were building their, their,

1316
01:18:13,371 --> 01:18:17,570
their temples in connection to the sky
and the whole phenomenon of the Mayan

1317
01:18:17,571 --> 01:18:21,410
calendar. Um, w which we all
heard a lot about in, in,

1318
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:25,670
in 2012, uh, is, is another
factor to take into account.

1319
01:18:25,671 --> 01:18:29,630
The Mayan calendar, in my view, is
another artifact of a lost civilization.

1320
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:30,231
This is the,

1321
01:18:30,231 --> 01:18:34,610
that was handed down from a former people
perhaps to the all macs and then to

1322
01:18:34,611 --> 01:18:39,050
the the, the Maya who who succeeded
them. It's, it's accepted,

1323
01:18:39,051 --> 01:18:41,270
but the implications of it are not,

1324
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:46,360
are not taken properly into account
remembered 21st of December,

1325
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:50,690
2012 there was all that fast and nonsense
about the end of the world happening,

1326
01:18:50,691 --> 01:18:54,380
happening then and, and it didn't.
But that's my, I never said that.

1327
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:57,590
They said that the end of a
great cycle happened then,

1328
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,490
which would ultimately
transform the world, but what
it was actually locked into,

1329
01:19:01,491 --> 01:19:05,540
and I need to pay tribute to another
researcher here and his name is John Major

1330
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:05,810
Jenkins.

1331
01:19:05,810 --> 01:19:10,790
John Major Jenkins has done fantastic
work on the Mayan calendar and decade

1332
01:19:10,791 --> 01:19:13,220
before 2012 he was telling people,
look,

1333
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:18,400
this is not talking about the end of the
world on a specific day on the 21st of

1334
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,600
December, 2012 there's a, there's
a calculation behind this.

1335
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:24,980
And what he showed in that calculation
is that it is the position of the winter

1336
01:19:24,981 --> 01:19:28,730
solstice sun against the
background of the constellations.

1337
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:33,650
And what has been happening for the last
5,000 years because of procession is

1338
01:19:33,651 --> 01:19:36,560
that the Winter Solstice,
Sun 21st of December,

1339
01:19:36,561 --> 01:19:41,360
against the background of
the constellations has been
gradually shifting towards

1340
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:46,300
alignment with the center of the
galaxy. And that alignment happened, uh,

1341
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:50,450
on the 21st of December,
2012 but it's not an instant,

1342
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,350
it's a window and that window
is about 80 years wide,

1343
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:57,170
roughly from 1960 to 2040.

1344
01:19:57,380 --> 01:19:59,540
That was what was focused
on in the Mayan calendar.

1345
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:04,570
A calendar that can predict eclipses of
the moon 200,000 years into the future,

1346
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:08,490
or 200,000 years into the past.

1347
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,200
Incredible,
stunning accuracy.

1348
01:20:10,201 --> 01:20:15,060
A better estimate of the length of the
solar year than we use today in our

1349
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:18,330
modern calculations. Really? Yeah. Wow.

1350
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:21,540
High Science and coated in that,
in that calendar.

1351
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:25,500
Why don't we just adopt the Mayan
calendar if it's better than what we have?

1352
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:28,260
I don't, yeah. We now living in
the fifth stage of the world,

1353
01:20:28,261 --> 01:20:32,460
according to the Mayan, the Mayan
use may not have been. Yeah,

1354
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,550
it's probably not good for your iPhone.
It wouldn't make a good app. I've got,

1355
01:20:35,551 --> 01:20:40,320
they have a mine, I have mine calendar.
I'm sure they do. You can think of one,

1356
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:45,060
one, one half of a degree. Graham
said one degree every 72 years,

1357
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:50,160
right? One degree within degree ear
is like one day out of the great year.

1358
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:54,450
Right? So you could think of 72 years
as basically being a human life.

1359
01:20:54,451 --> 01:20:58,950
So an average human life is roughly
like a day of the great year.

1360
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:03,240
That's one way. One perspective.
Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. No,

1361
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:05,250
what he said about the window is,

1362
01:21:05,251 --> 01:21:08,700
because you can't define
the center of the galaxy,

1363
01:21:08,701 --> 01:21:10,590
would that an exact precise point?

1364
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:15,760
There's a diffuse area there
and every 72 years, the,

1365
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:19,470
the, this, the spring
point is moving one degree,

1366
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:22,770
which is twice the
diameter of a full moon.

1367
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:25,680
Full Moon is a half a degree. Right. Okay.

1368
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,700
And I think that possibly one of
the importances of monitoring, um,

1369
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,290
because you can't really, you
know, you can't go out and
look at the sun, you know,

1370
01:21:34,291 --> 01:21:38,070
and say, okay, here's The sun relative
to this backdrop of this constellation.

1371
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,540
However, you can look at, uh,

1372
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:44,560
a full lunar eclipse and then you,

1373
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:47,790
you will know that the
sun is 180 degrees around.

1374
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,580
So by monitoring lunar eclipses,

1375
01:21:50,581 --> 01:21:55,581
you can actually position the sun quite
precisely and know where it is in the

1376
01:21:57,121 --> 01:22:02,121
sky because obviously you can't go out
and look at the sun and see what stars

1377
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:06,870
it's, it's related to, right,
right. But during a lunar eclipse,

1378
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:08,041
lunar eclipse,

1379
01:22:08,041 --> 01:22:13,041
it's 180 degrees almost precisely on
the other side of the earth from the,

1380
01:22:13,710 --> 01:22:15,660
from the sun.
So can,

1381
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:19,200
can I just jump in for a second
because I have an image here.

1382
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:23,400
I don't know if we can get it on the tap.
And it's this image on, on this side,

1383
01:22:23,401 --> 01:22:26,610
it's a pillow with originally
carved a shelling. Uh,

1384
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,270
is that pillar 1443 43 and enclosure day?
Not I'm,

1385
01:22:31,271 --> 01:22:33,930
I'm not going to go into it in
detail and I've seen that online,

1386
01:22:33,931 --> 01:22:36,690
but Jamie will find images online.
I just want to,

1387
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:40,710
I just want to make the point
and I go into this in this book,

1388
01:22:40,711 --> 01:22:41,820
magicians of the Gods that,

1389
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:47,090
that that appears to be a diagram of
the sky at the winter solstice in our

1390
01:22:48,661 --> 01:22:53,100
epoch. This, this red, the round
dots above the vultures wing,

1391
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:55,740
the round circle represents the sun.

1392
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:59,400
And what we're looking at is an
ancient constellation diagram.

1393
01:22:59,401 --> 01:23:03,820
The constellations that we call
Sagittarius in school, Po, uh,

1394
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:05,920
stand on side

1395
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,150
of the galactic center of the, of the
dark rift at the heart of the Milky Way,

1396
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:13,060
which the Maya saw is the
womb of cosmic rebirth.

1397
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:15,900
And it's precisely that
image that is depicted there.

1398
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:18,440
Back it up chapter and verse in the book.
You'll just have to take,

1399
01:23:18,441 --> 01:23:21,370
so what we see the Scorpion
below. Yeah, there's a,

1400
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:24,520
there's an ancient memory that there
should be a scorpion in that area of the

1401
01:23:24,521 --> 01:23:25,810
sky.
And it's impressed here

1402
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:30,690
on this, on this, on this pillar. And
what are the other constellation clues?

1403
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:35,240
Well, the, the, up on the
right, you'll see first of all,

1404
01:23:35,241 --> 01:23:38,060
see the vulture with its wings
outstretched and his son over the wing.

1405
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:40,580
Then go right up there,
you'll see a bird.

1406
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:44,840
That's that small bird is actually the
head of our constellation of Scorpio.

1407
01:23:45,050 --> 01:23:49,370
The tail of our constellation of Scorpio
overlaps the Scorpion a underneath the

1408
01:23:49,371 --> 01:23:53,090
pillar, but go above the small bird
and you'll see a serpent there,

1409
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:58,040
a snake, and beside it, another
bird that looks like a penis. Villi.

1410
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,680
Those represent,
we call those,

1411
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:05,210
we call those constellations today
or futures, the serpent holder,

1412
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:07,970
which is the represented
by the bird there.

1413
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:12,800
And we call the serpent constellation.
So pants are there,

1414
01:24:12,801 --> 01:24:15,720
other constellations are,
are, are also involved. It,

1415
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:20,870
this is spooky and eerie because it
appears there's overwhelming evidence that

1416
01:24:21,801 --> 01:24:25,610
the people who made go Beckley Tapi had
a profound knowledge of procession and

1417
01:24:25,611 --> 01:24:30,320
it appears that they deliberately sent
forward into time in this time capsule,

1418
01:24:30,590 --> 01:24:33,290
a picture of the sky in our age.

1419
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:37,850
And that is a staggering possibility that,
uh,

1420
01:24:37,851 --> 01:24:41,510
that I investigators 10
how it's in our age. Well,

1421
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:46,540
it's only at the winter solstice in our
age that the sun sits over the center of

1422
01:24:48,891 --> 01:24:49,724
the galaxy,

1423
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:55,000
the winter solstice in the area that
the ancient Maya called the cosmic womb.

1424
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:59,060
There's a dark rift in the
Milky Way at that point.

1425
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,650
And they saw that as the cosmic womb.
So it symbolizes a moment of rebirth.

1426
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:07,520
And the evidence is that they'd been
tracking the movement of the sun on the

1427
01:25:07,521 --> 01:25:09,800
winter solstice,
which is also the end of the year.

1428
01:25:09,801 --> 01:25:11,300
And the rebirth of the new year.

1429
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:15,470
They'd been tracking it to the point
where they could project forward and they

1430
01:25:15,471 --> 01:25:19,220
could envisage the sky in our epoch today.
The Meijer could do that.

1431
01:25:19,221 --> 01:25:21,920
And what I'm suggesting is that's
done correctly Tapi as well.

1432
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,830
Well, it's very hard for
me to interpret those. Uh,

1433
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:28,450
I'm seeing the vulture playing basketball
and trying to get away from the

1434
01:25:28,451 --> 01:25:31,050
Scorpion and there's a
penis trying to attack them.

1435
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:36,660
And I'm not exactly sure that the
photograph alone, that's just the best.

1436
01:25:36,661 --> 01:25:37,770
Just the heart of the mystery.

1437
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:40,950
You have to get into the logic of
it and compare it with the existing

1438
01:25:40,951 --> 01:25:42,390
constellations.
And I've tried to do that.

1439
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:46,380
Well it's also fascinating that all
of these images were carved in three d

1440
01:25:46,381 --> 01:25:46,921
relief.

1441
01:25:46,921 --> 01:25:51,420
So instead of being what would that
means is instead of being drawn like into

1442
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:53,790
like you know,
people think about like wet cement,

1443
01:25:53,820 --> 01:25:57,480
you can draw your name in wet cement
instead of that what they've done is

1444
01:25:57,481 --> 01:26:01,470
they've removed everything
around it to create these images,

1445
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:04,040
which is a much more sophisticated
is right. This is what's

1446
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,200
called high high relief.
Um,

1447
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:09,050
interestingly you can see at the top of
the pillar there are three that look,

1448
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:13,520
things that looked like handbags,
that symbol crops up all over the world.

1449
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:17,510
It crops up in Mexico, it crops up
in Mesopotamia, crops up in India,

1450
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:19,010
everywhere.
And again,

1451
01:26:19,011 --> 01:26:23,990
I think we're looking at at symbolism
that goes back to a very remote period,

1452
01:26:23,991 --> 01:26:25,870
which we know is at least as old as 11th.

1453
01:26:25,871 --> 01:26:29,390
And maybe what they're trying to say is
that shopping will be the end of a saw.

1454
01:26:29,420 --> 01:26:32,990
I think those bags held desk stash really,

1455
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,780
and I'm half serious because this is,

1456
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:40,100
this is another issue that that is
ignored by the mainstream is the use of

1457
01:26:40,101 --> 01:26:44,900
psychedelics in ancient civilizations
was fundamental to the quality of those

1458
01:26:44,901 --> 01:26:48,770
civilizations. And this is another
area where in ideological denial about,

1459
01:26:48,771 --> 01:26:51,980
because the powers that be in our
society don't like psychedelics.

1460
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:55,820
They don't want ancient cultures to have
liked the my there and they just ignore

1461
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:57,080
the evidence for that.

1462
01:26:57,190 --> 01:27:00,950
I think it's one of the
main points of view that uh,

1463
01:27:01,660 --> 01:27:03,370
when you don't consider them,

1464
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:08,200
it makes me really reluctant to listen
to a lot of the other things you have to

1465
01:27:08,201 --> 01:27:09,740
say because it's,

1466
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:13,990
it's undeniable the impact those
things have on human consciousness.

1467
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:16,630
And it's also undeniable that many,
many,

1468
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:21,100
many civilizations used them as a
part of their spiritual rituals.

1469
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:26,550
And the fact that this is not thought of
as an important aspect of our history.

1470
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:30,100
When it all it means to me is the people
that are talking about and have an

1471
01:27:30,101 --> 01:27:31,990
experience. Exactly.
That's the policy only.

1472
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:34,300
Yeah. Who are the, the,

1473
01:27:34,301 --> 01:27:38,970
the entrusted with
interpreting our past to us.

1474
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:41,790
Unfortunately, most of them had never
taken a psychedelic in their life,

1475
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:43,000
so they don't know what they mean.

1476
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:43,661
No,
look,

1477
01:27:43,661 --> 01:27:48,520
I just need 15 minutes of your time and
one DM teaching 15 minutes and the whole

1478
01:27:48,521 --> 01:27:50,710
thing will be so much clearer.
How much

1479
01:27:50,710 --> 01:27:52,290
clearer exactly.
It's,

1480
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:56,770
I think it's an important experience for
archeologists to have because it was a

1481
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,230
universal experience in the ancient world.

1482
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:02,080
We demonize psychedelics today and we,

1483
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:06,100
we pretend that they are just totally
negative things, but in the ancient world,

1484
01:28:06,101 --> 01:28:10,330
they were revered and enshrined. They were
at the heart of the ancient mysteries.

1485
01:28:10,331 --> 01:28:14,920
The Eleusinian mysteries in ancient
Greece used a potion related to Lsd,

1486
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:18,280
which brought about a
revelation for the initiates,

1487
01:28:18,281 --> 01:28:21,610
changed their lives just in the way that
a powerful psychedelic trip can change

1488
01:28:21,611 --> 01:28:22,271
our lives today.

1489
01:28:22,271 --> 01:28:26,830
So just like writing about history and
the origins of civilization without

1490
01:28:26,831 --> 01:28:31,810
taking account of, whoops, this gigantic
cataclysm that happened 12,800 years ago,

1491
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,610
that's a mistake that
archaeology is making.

1492
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:37,330
The other mistake they're
making is they're not
considering the role of altered

1493
01:28:37,331 --> 01:28:39,580
states of consciousness
in ancient civilizations.

1494
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:44,590
Ideological Blinders ideologic keep
us from looking at possibilities.

1495
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:49,120
I don't know whether or not that stash
or that's just chicks handbag sang

1496
01:28:49,121 --> 01:28:52,570
shopping malls, malls were ruined us
all. That's the way. The thing is,

1497
01:28:52,750 --> 01:28:56,170
the weird thing is that it's all that,
that this symbolism is all over the world.

1498
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:59,000
What have got back Lee tabby was a mall.
The,

1499
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,240
that's how you may have something back.

1500
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:06,360
This symbolism of these purses. Yeah.
Yeah. It's found on the web. For example.

1501
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:10,260
Um, we'd have to find a,
an, an image, but there's a,

1502
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:15,261
the earliest image of the figure known
as quite sal collateral in Mexico,

1503
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,670
uh, survives from, uh,

1504
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:22,200
the old Mech area of the Gulf of Mexico.

1505
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:25,890
And it was founded a site
called love Venta, uh,

1506
01:29:25,891 --> 01:29:28,950
along with a lot of other
buried stone artifacts.

1507
01:29:28,951 --> 01:29:33,780
And it shows a man sitting within the
coils of a serpent and that serpent has a

1508
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:35,790
crest on its head because
that's what quotes are.

1509
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:37,950
Collateral means it means
a feathered serpent.

1510
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:43,280
And that man is holding one of those bags
just the same as the Sumerian Fishman.

1511
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:47,270
Oh,
Anis.

1512
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:52,270
The one adapta the the originator
of civilization in Suma,

1513
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:54,690
ancient, ancient Sumeria.
According to their mythology,

1514
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:57,660
he's always depicted holding
one of these bags as well.

1515
01:29:57,870 --> 01:30:00,090
So I find myself wondering,

1516
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:04,560
are we looking at the symbolism of
some ancient brotherhood, you know,

1517
01:30:04,561 --> 01:30:09,330
who passed around the world seeding
civilizations and that this was the

1518
01:30:09,331 --> 01:30:12,120
equivalent of their, I dunno, their
masonic handshake or something.

1519
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:15,180
This was their badge of recognition,
this bag that they carried them. Well,

1520
01:30:15,181 --> 01:30:17,990
it's just speculation, right?
It's, it's fewer speculators thing.

1521
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:22,480
It's pure speculation, but so
because of the fact that we, the,

1522
01:30:22,481 --> 01:30:27,481
they've accepted that the mind temples
are aligned with the constellations.

1523
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:33,740
Have they decided to look
at other archeological
discoveries in the same light

1524
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:36,260
or is it something are,

1525
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:39,570
there is a specialized
subdivision of archeology,

1526
01:30:39,571 --> 01:30:43,970
which is called archeo astronomers
except this subdivision. These are,

1527
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:46,860
these are archeologists who
have been trained in astronomy,

1528
01:30:46,861 --> 01:30:51,180
but they've also been trained in the
fundamental dogmas of the discipline of

1529
01:30:51,181 --> 01:30:54,450
archeology, which is that there
can be no lost civilization.

1530
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:59,430
That archeology has already told pretty
much the full story of humanity and

1531
01:30:59,431 --> 01:31:03,450
they're all the weights. All the weights
is to fill in the details. This is,

1532
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:08,490
this is the dogma of archeology that is
taken in from the moment that somebody

1533
01:31:08,701 --> 01:31:10,800
decides to become an archeologist.
Part of the training,

1534
01:31:10,801 --> 01:31:14,580
and actually if you try and go against
that dogma as a mainstream archeologist,

1535
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:16,350
you can kiss goodbye to your career.

1536
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:20,910
Any archeologist who
entertains the possibility of
an advance lost civilization

1537
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:25,230
around the world more than 12,000
years ago will have no future as an

1538
01:31:25,231 --> 01:31:29,280
archeologist. That right there, we'll
write him off for the rest of his career.

1539
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:33,450
That's so disturbing. Disturbing.
If that's true. That's so,

1540
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:38,190
it's so mind numbing cause why would
you ever believe that we've got it all

1541
01:31:38,191 --> 01:31:41,070
figured out where every day
they find some new stuff.

1542
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:46,320
Did you see the discovery they found
recently of a large tooth that's a cousin

1543
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:49,820
of a,
of human beings then serve and re,

1544
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:52,830
but really recently within the
last few days, very recently. Well,

1545
01:31:52,831 --> 01:31:54,770
this is the thing you see the our,

1546
01:31:54,771 --> 01:31:59,771
our story is much more complex that we've
been taught and gradually by bit the

1547
01:32:00,041 --> 01:32:01,750
evidence is coming out of the woodwork.
Well,

1548
01:32:01,751 --> 01:32:05,110
the idea that we have all the
data of history is just so crazy.

1549
01:32:05,111 --> 01:32:09,160
It's just our true and arrogant.
It's absolutely foolish.

1550
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:12,520
It's a very foolish idea and it,
and it shuts us down to the,

1551
01:32:12,521 --> 01:32:13,301
to the possibilities.

1552
01:32:13,301 --> 01:32:18,301
I mean the universe gifted us with
these giant brains and this incredible

1553
01:32:18,521 --> 01:32:21,130
imagination and intuitive
faculties as well.

1554
01:32:21,131 --> 01:32:26,110
We not only rational creatures where
we're intuitive creatures and all of these

1555
01:32:26,111 --> 01:32:30,970
faculties should be applied
to understanding the mystery
of who and what we are.

1556
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,180
And I think that's one of the mistakes
of modern science is there's just chopped

1557
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:39,010
out one bit that kind of alert
problem solving, the rational reason,

1558
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:42,660
the use of reason and logic and it, and
it's chopped out all the rest. The, the,

1559
01:32:42,661 --> 01:32:44,920
the, the, the capacity
of humanity to dream,

1560
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,050
to learn information and dream to learn,

1561
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:50,590
learn true knowledge in dream was
revered in the ancient world and just

1562
01:32:50,591 --> 01:32:54,700
ridiculed today. You want
to insult somebody called
him a dreamer, you know, uh,

1563
01:32:54,701 --> 01:32:56,560
things of things have changed so much.

1564
01:32:56,730 --> 01:32:59,920
Well it seems like back then there
was so much less information.

1565
01:32:59,921 --> 01:33:03,530
Now there's so much information to call
someone. A dreamer means that you're,

1566
01:33:03,630 --> 01:33:07,900
you're thinking of nonsense when you
should be trying to acquire all the

1567
01:33:07,901 --> 01:33:11,560
information that we've already discovered
that we've already cumulated. Exactly.

1568
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:14,650
That's exactly what it's about.
And again, it's, it's ideology.

1569
01:33:14,651 --> 01:33:16,870
It's saying that there is
nothing of value and dreams.

1570
01:33:16,990 --> 01:33:20,950
How do we know that ancient world felt
that there was useful knowledge to be got

1571
01:33:20,951 --> 01:33:24,100
from, from dreams, not all
dreams. It's in homer actually,

1572
01:33:24,101 --> 01:33:27,100
the speaks of the gate of
ivory and the gate of Horn.

1573
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:29,800
Some dreams come through
the gate of ivory.

1574
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:34,060
They're just pleasant fictions or maybe
unpleasant ones. Nightmares, ignore them.

1575
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:35,860
They're not important.
But others are true.

1576
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:39,430
Tellings and they come through
the gate of Horn. Uh, and,

1577
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:43,600
and this was a recognized factor in the
ancient world. We've dismissed it today.

1578
01:33:43,601 --> 01:33:46,420
It's regarded as pseudoscience.
It's regarded as nonsense. Again,

1579
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:50,290
that label is constantly applied to
anything. Archaeologists don't alike.

1580
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:55,270
Pseudoscience. D right there with a
label. They just dismiss everything.

1581
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:59,440
They always call me a pseudo scientists,
which means a false scientist.

1582
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,860
And I find that bizarre because
I'm not a scientist at all.

1583
01:34:02,861 --> 01:34:05,890
I've never claimed to be a scientist.
I don't want to be a scientist.

1584
01:34:05,891 --> 01:34:07,450
I'm a writer. I'm a journalist. I,

1585
01:34:07,451 --> 01:34:10,930
I synthesize material across
a broad range of disciplines.

1586
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:14,500
So how can I be a false scientist
since I've never claimed to be one.

1587
01:34:14,501 --> 01:34:19,420
But the word is used as a bludgeon or a
club to beat an enemy over the head and

1588
01:34:19,421 --> 01:34:23,130
ensured that nobody listens to what
that enemy centers sort of a bulletproof

1589
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:26,680
pejorative. You know, you throw that out
there and you're immediately dismissed.

1590
01:34:26,681 --> 01:34:31,420
Yeah. But it's got to be satisfying
to you going from that original book,

1591
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:35,710
which I became absolutely fascinated by
fingerprints of the gods to or slowly

1592
01:34:35,711 --> 01:34:37,240
but surely over time,

1593
01:34:37,241 --> 01:34:40,390
more and more evidence being
discovered in mainstream science,

1594
01:34:40,391 --> 01:34:44,890
in archeology that affirms all
these suspicions. And then,

1595
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:49,330
uh, attached to what Randall has been
studying his whole life. It really,

1596
01:34:49,331 --> 01:34:53,170
the whole thing just sort of unfolds
in front of your eyes. There's a,

1597
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:57,980
there's a kind of perfect perfect moment
in human knowledge unfolding right now.

1598
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:03,640
We now have the knowledge of this giant
cataclysm that happened 12,800 years

1599
01:35:04,101 --> 01:35:04,400
ago,

1600
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:09,400
which has just not been taken into account
at all up to now and at the same time

1601
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:11,030
and it's almost eerie.

1602
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:14,480
Archaeological sites are popping up
all around the world that cannot be

1603
01:35:14,481 --> 01:35:17,060
explained by the previous
model of history.

1604
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:22,160
Now with all of this information that
you've shown so far, the the, the, the,

1605
01:35:22,161 --> 01:35:26,270
the layer that shows the
massive burning of the forest,

1606
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:29,540
the impact craters that we've found,

1607
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:33,170
the nuclear glass,
the micro diamonds,

1608
01:35:33,171 --> 01:35:35,330
all this evidence that the,

1609
01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:38,390
in an immediate shift of the climate,

1610
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:43,600
the mass extinction of a huge percentage
of the large mammals is the impact

1611
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:50,030
period. That period. Is that
considered in mainstream science,

1612
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:52,253
mainstream

1613
01:35:52,510 --> 01:35:56,020
science because it's mainstream
scientists who've presented the evidence,

1614
01:35:56,050 --> 01:35:56,461
as I said,

1615
01:35:56,461 --> 01:35:59,860
data that you've accumulated in correspond
comes from right from mainstream

1616
01:35:59,861 --> 01:36:03,400
science published in, in the
absolute leading scientific journals,

1617
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:07,510
but you're stitching it together.
What, what nobody has done yet.

1618
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:10,270
I think I'm probably the
first person to do it,

1619
01:36:10,271 --> 01:36:14,440
is to take that evidence and consider
its implications for the stories we tell

1620
01:36:14,441 --> 01:36:19,000
ourselves about the origins of
civilization. Very important story.

1621
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:21,430
Where did civilization come from?
What is it?

1622
01:36:21,670 --> 01:36:26,230
And that information has not been taken
into account at all by archeologists yet

1623
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:28,570
I hope they will do so in the future.

1624
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:33,190
They need to play a very fast game of
catch up to catch up with the science on

1625
01:36:33,191 --> 01:36:34,390
this and take it into account.

1626
01:36:34,391 --> 01:36:36,860
But right now it's not being
taken into account at all.

1627
01:36:36,861 --> 01:36:41,380
You will not find a single archaeological
document which takes account of the

1628
01:36:41,381 --> 01:36:44,830
cataclysm that happened between twelve
thousand eight hundred and eleven

1629
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:45,663
thousand six hundred years ago.

1630
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:50,480
Big Part of the problem is specialization
in science. I think. So you've got, um,

1631
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:53,900
you know, uh, paleontologists
looking at the extinction of ants.

1632
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:57,470
You've got marine geologist
looking at sea level rise.

1633
01:36:57,471 --> 01:37:02,471
You've got glaciologists looking at how
the glaciers disappeared and we're in a

1634
01:37:03,141 --> 01:37:06,060
position now where we need to
begin synthesizing all this it,

1635
01:37:06,090 --> 01:37:08,300
you know what's interesting to
me though is that it, it really,

1636
01:37:08,301 --> 01:37:11,250
it almost falls on the shoulders
of the Mavericks, you know,

1637
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:15,710
the synthesizers and that's kind
of really right now there's so much

1638
01:37:15,711 --> 01:37:20,600
specialization in science that the next
phase of it I think is beginning to

1639
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:21,371
integrate it.

1640
01:37:21,371 --> 01:37:26,371
It takes to create a coherent model of
our past because a lot of like grandma's

1641
01:37:27,231 --> 01:37:31,580
saying, a lot of the mainstream
scientists have this information, right?

1642
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:32,743
If I,
if,

1643
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:37,550
if we look at this graph right here
and you see how this compares with, um,

1644
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:42,650
the graphs we just saw of the climate
changes and the ocean level rise,

1645
01:37:43,010 --> 01:37:46,040
this is a, as it says, Lake
place to see mortality graph.

1646
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:51,400
And this is basically looking
at radiocarbon dated a
fossilized remains of the

1647
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,220
extinct mammals.
And if you look carefully,

1648
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:58,590
you'll see that within the range that
we're talking about writing here,

1649
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,640
here's your 13,000 year spike right here.

1650
01:38:02,950 --> 01:38:06,060
This is exactly the same time period.
And yeah,

1651
01:38:06,061 --> 01:38:09,120
exactly the same as the
changing of the temperature,

1652
01:38:09,121 --> 01:38:13,560
the rising of the sea levels,
massive extinction event, right,

1653
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:14,580
and narratives right there.

1654
01:38:14,581 --> 01:38:17,940
Every one of these squares
represents a fossilized remain.

1655
01:38:17,941 --> 01:38:22,941
I think the 360 or 70
specimens that have been dated,

1656
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:28,100
it seems insanely unlikely to me that
this didn't correspond with an impact on

1657
01:38:29,131 --> 01:38:33,930
human civilization. It's very, it's very
clear that it's a sense, it seems insane,

1658
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:38,340
but it's not like mainstream and
consuming. If this is all fact,

1659
01:38:38,341 --> 01:38:39,180
and obviously it is,

1660
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:42,530
how is this not like how hasn't it,

1661
01:38:42,531 --> 01:38:45,730
this is so glaring for something happen.

1662
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,310
It raises a horrible
possibility for archaeology,

1663
01:38:48,850 --> 01:38:53,740
but they have been completely wrong
about the origins of civilization.

1664
01:38:53,741 --> 01:38:58,741
I mean not just slightly wrong but
completely wrong because they didn't take

1665
01:38:58,991 --> 01:38:59,830
account of this.

1666
01:38:59,860 --> 01:39:03,310
That's a horrible possibility and it's
much better to just try and get rid of

1667
01:39:03,311 --> 01:39:07,100
the data. I'm not saying that it's
a conspiracy by archaeologists.

1668
01:39:07,101 --> 01:39:08,290
I'm saying it's human nature.

1669
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:13,300
If you're invested in a system of
ideas so powerfully invested in it,

1670
01:39:13,301 --> 01:39:17,050
that your own personality is
connected to you just can't accept it.

1671
01:39:17,051 --> 01:39:21,040
It's really hard to accept almost your
generation has to die off before a new

1672
01:39:21,041 --> 01:39:23,710
generation comes that will be prepared
to it. It was just with old age,

1673
01:39:23,711 --> 01:39:28,410
I'm not threatening and assault on
Ooh,

1674
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:32,170
because it empowered. I think you're
right. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and that's,

1675
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:35,200
I think that's the problem why it's
not been taken and Randall's right.

1676
01:39:35,201 --> 01:39:38,650
The other problem is the intense
specialization of our society.

1677
01:39:38,651 --> 01:39:40,540
That's one of the
strengths of our society.

1678
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:44,230
There's also one of the weaknesses or
society that everybody's really good at.

1679
01:39:44,231 --> 01:39:45,500
One particular thing.

1680
01:39:45,501 --> 01:39:48,720
That's the only way it all works out
because how one could possibly get all of

1681
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:52,630
this work done and it's all we're all
into dependent upon upon one another.

1682
01:39:52,631 --> 01:39:56,380
But there's not enough comparing
notes across the disciplines.

1683
01:39:56,381 --> 01:40:00,150
And I guess that's where my skills
such as they are come in that I can,

1684
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:04,300
I've spent my whole life synthesizing
data from, from many different fields.

1685
01:40:04,301 --> 01:40:07,300
And that's what, um, that's, that's,
that's what I'm doing here. And it also,

1686
01:40:07,301 --> 01:40:08,051
correct me if I'm wrong,

1687
01:40:08,051 --> 01:40:11,620
but it seems like there's a part of the
issue is there's no consequence to not

1688
01:40:11,621 --> 01:40:15,010
considering this stuff. There's no
consequence to just ignoring it.

1689
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:15,940
They ignore it.

1690
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:19,360
They team teach what they've
taught mainstream and they
still come out smelling

1691
01:40:19,361 --> 01:40:21,730
like a rose and everything
looks great. Exactly, and they,

1692
01:40:21,731 --> 01:40:25,690
and they all keep their jobs.
They don't annoy that colleagues.

1693
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:28,030
It's almost the opposite of that because

1694
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:32,720
to go here, they're actually, you know,
they're threatening your position.

1695
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:36,080
You know, they're, they're, they're
putting their position in danger,

1696
01:40:36,110 --> 01:40:39,560
but I don't understand why they would
be because to me it seems like you would

1697
01:40:39,561 --> 01:40:41,820
want to say,
we have some exciting

1698
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:46,260
hi data. So this is, well now we have
to reconsider what we already know.

1699
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:51,510
We already know, you know, about this
part of the world and this was a,

1700
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:53,740
we'd already know about
the pleistocene era.

1701
01:40:53,741 --> 01:40:55,180
We already know about all
these different houses,

1702
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:59,430
but now we have this new data
to consider and hear all it is.

1703
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:03,180
They should be excited about it.
They should be joyous, that there's,

1704
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:06,460
this is something here, which really
could change the whole picture.

1705
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:10,620
But that's not the case. It's, it's,
it's radically opposed. Well it just,

1706
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:15,100
it makes your education look like shit.
I mean it's really unfortunate,

1707
01:41:15,101 --> 01:41:18,850
but it really does see this is an area
that Randall and I happen to know a lot

1708
01:41:18,851 --> 01:41:19,211
about.

1709
01:41:19,211 --> 01:41:23,470
What I wonder is in other areas that I
don't know about is this same phenomenon

1710
01:41:23,471 --> 01:41:25,540
at work,
that kind of knowledge filter,

1711
01:41:25,541 --> 01:41:29,260
which is just shutting us off from
what discipline would that be?

1712
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:33,730
Or are you just social, social sciences,
any, any, any area of science, a medicine,

1713
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,860
how things are to be done with,
with medicine,

1714
01:41:35,861 --> 01:41:39,940
how tumors are to be handled and
dealt with. You know, we have,

1715
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:44,390
we have a dog my right now that it's
chemotherapy and radiotherapy and,

1716
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:49,300
and every other system is, is regarded
as what pseudoscience generally.

1717
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:51,580
But maybe that's a mistake.
You know,

1718
01:41:51,581 --> 01:41:54,880
maybe we should be considering
the possibility of these
alternative therapies.

1719
01:41:54,881 --> 01:41:59,230
Maybe they're better than blasting
somebody with highly radioactive material.

1720
01:42:00,010 --> 01:42:02,110
Well,
I certainly think there's some,

1721
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:07,690
there's some things that we don't know
about the impact of nutrition and overall

1722
01:42:07,691 --> 01:42:12,691
health and meditation and just the
impact of stress and wellbeing and how it

1723
01:42:13,541 --> 01:42:17,320
plays on health factors.
And I think we're going to learn all that.

1724
01:42:17,321 --> 01:42:21,520
I mean I think there's probably
more discussion and more uh,

1725
01:42:21,521 --> 01:42:24,880
more focus on that then there is on stuff
like this, this sure, sure. There is.

1726
01:42:24,881 --> 01:42:27,640
Our personal health is
important to all of this and,

1727
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:31,780
and this is kind of a part of our
personal health because it's a part of our

1728
01:42:31,781 --> 01:42:35,620
understanding of the we, our environment
that we exist in, where we are,

1729
01:42:35,621 --> 01:42:38,200
where we came from. Yeah,
absolutely. Now you got,

1730
01:42:38,230 --> 01:42:41,750
how long did you guys rode trip together?
It's about two weeks. Wasn't it?

1731
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:45,020
Run a little shy of two weeks. And
what, what did, what did it entail?

1732
01:42:45,021 --> 01:42:47,870
Did you guys make a video of it or
anything? There was a lot of videos shot.

1733
01:42:48,280 --> 01:42:52,090
Beautiful. One of one of
rentals colleagues, Brad,

1734
01:42:52,091 --> 01:42:55,900
who was with us shut video along the way
and my wife's Santha took photographs

1735
01:42:55,901 --> 01:42:59,290
and you know, we've put, we've, we've
documented all of this very, very, very,

1736
01:42:59,291 --> 01:43:03,490
very thoroughly. But it was an amazing
road trip for me. It was the first time,

1737
01:43:03,491 --> 01:43:07,180
actually I've, I've driven
a great distance across the
continental United States.

1738
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:10,210
I've always been in this city or that
city and picking up an airplane and going

1739
01:43:10,211 --> 01:43:10,421
here,
there,

1740
01:43:10,421 --> 01:43:15,421
but actually drive across this
incredible majestic land was,

1741
01:43:15,941 --> 01:43:18,310
it was an enormous experience
for me and it made me,

1742
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:22,390
it filled me with a sense
of just how huge America is.

1743
01:43:22,391 --> 01:43:27,310
I live in this tiny island, you know,
Britain, but this giant, these open,

1744
01:43:27,311 --> 01:43:30,040
they open skies country that they
think they call it in there. It was,

1745
01:43:30,041 --> 01:43:31,990
it was a great initiation into,

1746
01:43:32,230 --> 01:43:36,310
into a beautiful part of North America
and a mysterious part of North America.

1747
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:40,360
And it was great to do it with Randall
because he's been walking the walk in

1748
01:43:40,361 --> 01:43:42,370
this,
in this area for decades.

1749
01:43:42,371 --> 01:43:44,470
And he knows that landscape
like the back of his hand.

1750
01:43:44,650 --> 01:43:46,780
And for people that are listening
to this podcast right now.

1751
01:43:46,781 --> 01:43:49,240
And this is your first
introduction to Randall and Graham.

1752
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:52,160
You gotta go pause right now

1753
01:43:52,430 --> 01:43:54,730
and go back to the first one.
Grandma's on the first one.

1754
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:59,100
Randall was on and just do a binge,
just binge lists and our binge watch.

1755
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:04,040
What are we looking at here? Well, this
is Graham. I'm trespassing. How dare you

1756
01:44:05,610 --> 01:44:10,190
can, I'm like, I'm watching it
all directions first and be there.

1757
01:44:10,690 --> 01:44:11,840
Well,
since the,

1758
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:15,860
since the first time I was there at this
is grammar actually referred to this

1759
01:44:15,890 --> 01:44:18,180
erratic earlier. Um,
this was one of those,

1760
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:20,540
that 18,000 ton boulder
sitting above what not.

1761
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:23,590
So that was the boulder
that was pushed by the wind,

1762
01:44:23,650 --> 01:44:28,600
carried in ice and ice
chained in an ice burg. So

1763
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:35,560
this massive rush of water had a giant
rocks embedded in the iceberg to float

1764
01:44:36,711 --> 01:44:41,450
that you need an ice bag about the
size of an oil tanker. And this is,

1765
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:44,840
this is sitting 400 feet
above the Modern Day Columbia.

1766
01:44:44,841 --> 01:44:48,110
So we know that the water was
at least this height. Well,

1767
01:44:48,111 --> 01:44:52,460
actually it had to been higher than this
because 90% of the iceberg is under the

1768
01:44:52,461 --> 01:44:56,510
surface of the water. And how do we
know that this rock just wasn't there?

1769
01:44:56,570 --> 01:44:58,770
How do we know that it
was carried by this? Well,

1770
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:03,320
because it's not part of the bedrock.
It's sitting on top of the land surface.

1771
01:45:03,620 --> 01:45:07,580
Like all of these. If we look
here, we've got some, some other,

1772
01:45:07,670 --> 01:45:11,270
do we know where it came from?
Do we know how far away it or originate?

1773
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:15,830
It's probably come from about 50
miles to 75 miles north of here. It's,

1774
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:19,550
it's the type of basalt it is,
is, is, has been identified.

1775
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:23,900
I don't remember specifically,
but when you travel over this land,

1776
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:28,930
you see these giant boulders just strewn
about as a place called bolded puck.

1777
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:32,230
It's a tourist attraction now.
You want to see it? Yeah. Yeah.

1778
01:45:32,450 --> 01:45:36,110
And you can see there, I mean the
size of that in there. Let's see.

1779
01:45:36,650 --> 01:45:40,870
Oh my God. Yeah. So they just stand
out like out of nowhere. Yeah. And we,

1780
01:45:40,871 --> 01:45:43,790
we know this had to have
been transported a board,

1781
01:45:43,791 --> 01:45:48,260
an iceberg for the simple reason that if
it was carried within the glacier mass,

1782
01:45:48,261 --> 01:45:50,240
like a typical glacier erratic,

1783
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:54,470
you wouldn't have those sharp
square corners like that. A glacier.

1784
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:57,500
It gets ground off and oftentimes,

1785
01:45:57,501 --> 01:46:02,501
and this thing was transported almost 200
miles from its likely origin was Mount

1786
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:06,810
Robeson and we didn't get to this one,
but this is evidence that the,

1787
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:10,760
the flooding was much more extensive
than just the Missoula right flooding

1788
01:46:10,970 --> 01:46:15,470
because this is the Missoula flooding
that we were looking at was on the west

1789
01:46:15,471 --> 01:46:18,440
side of the North
American continental vice.

1790
01:46:18,441 --> 01:46:22,820
You just jump in there and say that
it isn't any longer controversial,

1791
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:27,560
that there was gigantic flooding in the
Pacific northwest and then indeed across

1792
01:46:27,561 --> 01:46:31,460
the whole range, just south of the
ice cap, that that is accepted now.

1793
01:46:31,730 --> 01:46:36,730
But the very idea that there was
flooding a toll was hotly opposed for for

1794
01:46:36,771 --> 01:46:37,311
decades.

1795
01:46:37,311 --> 01:46:41,450
There was a great American
geologist called j Holland
brats who was the first to

1796
01:46:41,451 --> 01:46:45,350
document the fact that there had been
colossal flooding in that area and he

1797
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:50,070
lived in the 19 hundreds had
19 1920s and he suggested

1798
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:54,210
that there had been a cataclysm. Of
course, he was exiled by his colleagues.

1799
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:59,310
Eventually his data prevailed and
he was awarded the Penn Rose Metal,

1800
01:46:59,311 --> 01:47:04,311
the highest award of the Geological Glg
in America in 1976 when he was like 96

1801
01:47:05,191 --> 01:47:08,580
years old, I must have sucked for.
And he said, then he said, he said,

1802
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:12,780
all my enemies are dead,
so I have no one left to gloat over

1803
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:18,250
what is so disturbing to me that it
works like that. It works like that.

1804
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:21,360
But what happened,
you see was Harlan.

1805
01:47:21,361 --> 01:47:24,420
Brett's was convinced from the
beginning that he was dealing,

1806
01:47:24,421 --> 01:47:26,610
and this is a very experienced field,
geologists,

1807
01:47:26,611 --> 01:47:31,290
that he was dealing with a single
humongous flood which had risen and fallen

1808
01:47:31,291 --> 01:47:32,730
within perhaps two weeks.

1809
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:36,450
That was his evidence on the ground
and he was attacked because people kept

1810
01:47:36,451 --> 01:47:38,040
saying, well, where did
the water come from?

1811
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:42,300
You know what's the source of this water?
And he said, that's not my problem.

1812
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:47,010
I am showing you the clear unmistakable
evidence of flooding on the ground.

1813
01:47:47,011 --> 01:47:47,970
Flooding happened.

1814
01:47:48,270 --> 01:47:51,990
Somebody else go work out where the
water came from and this stuck the whole

1815
01:47:51,991 --> 01:47:56,070
argument for the best part of 40
years until a compromise was reached.

1816
01:47:56,071 --> 01:47:58,440
And that's the word that Randall used.
Missoula,

1817
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:03,420
they said that this flooding was caused
by outburst floods from a glacial lake

1818
01:48:03,450 --> 01:48:05,370
that's referred to as
Glacial Lake Missoula.

1819
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:07,470
And because the flooding is so extensive,

1820
01:48:07,650 --> 01:48:12,540
it must have outburst 80 or 90 times
to cause to cause that flooding,

1821
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:14,150
which completely contradicts Highland.

1822
01:48:14,151 --> 01:48:17,880
Brett's his view that it was a
two week flood, one single event,

1823
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:22,940
but the compromise was accepted that the
cause of the flooding was glacial Lake

1824
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:27,360
Missoula. That is now going to have to be
reviewed because of the comet evidence.

1825
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:31,890
If Harlan Brett's of Jay Harlan breads
had had the information we have today,

1826
01:48:32,190 --> 01:48:36,240
he would have known instantly what caused
that single humongous flood and that

1827
01:48:36,241 --> 01:48:40,920
was the liquid dicing have a huge area
of the North American ice cap instantly.

1828
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:43,860
And the floods that followed.
It's so fascinating that the,

1829
01:48:43,861 --> 01:48:46,860
the obsessions of a few people
come together like this.

1830
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:50,340
And you can kind of piece these things
together on a podcast. We're on a,

1831
01:48:50,341 --> 01:48:51,500
what does this crazy imagery.

1832
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:57,040
We out of a 19th century
text when catastrophism
before catastrophism had been

1833
01:48:57,241 --> 01:49:02,110
completely exorcised from
mainstream geology and this was, um,

1834
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:07,580
uh, Louis figure I think was his
name, who speculated that the,

1835
01:49:07,581 --> 01:49:11,240
that the ice sheets over
Northwestern Europe had catastrophic.

1836
01:49:11,241 --> 01:49:15,930
He melted down and he had an
illustration in his geology text,

1837
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:21,170
which perfectly captures how these larger
radix are actually being transported.

1838
01:49:21,751 --> 01:49:23,250
A board,
these icebergs.

1839
01:49:23,670 --> 01:49:25,890
And you can see the scale of the
thing and this is the kind of,

1840
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:30,150
you see a whole forests are about to
be washed away here. And this, this,

1841
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:33,300
this image. When the first time I saw
it, I thought, well, here it is. This,

1842
01:49:33,301 --> 01:49:37,710
this depicts the kind of field evidence
that we, we've been looking at here.

1843
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:42,420
Um, so that's why I've included it here
because it helps to visualize what we're

1844
01:49:42,421 --> 01:49:47,010
talking about. Um, we've got some
intro. This was a place that,

1845
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:48,280
and I visited here,

1846
01:49:48,281 --> 01:49:52,480
which really spectacularly
embodies this whole phenomena.

1847
01:49:52,490 --> 01:49:57,490
This is known as as dry faults cataract
and it's about five miles wide and I'm

1848
01:49:58,661 --> 01:50:01,930
going to show you the ground photographs
and a couple of aerial photographs of

1849
01:50:01,931 --> 01:50:03,910
it. She can kind of get
the scale of the thing.

1850
01:50:03,911 --> 01:50:06,270
Now this was the thing is
anybody can go there. This is,

1851
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:08,530
this is on the lab hours to look at.

1852
01:50:08,531 --> 01:50:12,400
We won't go and see this amazing trip
to see it. You could go there, Joe.

1853
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:14,770
They would let you in there to see this.

1854
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:20,230
Where were you trespassing on that
particular shot? That that's huge.

1855
01:50:20,231 --> 01:50:24,610
18,000 ton boulder has is surrounded
by notices. We say no trespassing.

1856
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:28,503
I trespassed,

1857
01:50:28,510 --> 01:50:31,750
I mean the thing is made at Bass Hall
and my footstep is not going to do any

1858
01:50:31,751 --> 01:50:35,590
harm. Yeah, I bet nobody even
noticed the Graham had been up there,

1859
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:38,710
so it's not like a private property issue.

1860
01:50:38,711 --> 01:50:40,000
It's like they're just
trying to keep people.

1861
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:42,360
I think it is actually a
private pro probably. Yes.

1862
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:45,730
Because I have noticed from the first
time I went there, which was, gosh,

1863
01:50:45,731 --> 01:50:49,720
I don't know, 98, I think there
was no houses on that hillside.

1864
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:53,830
Now the houses are moving up the hill
side spent development and so forth.

1865
01:50:53,831 --> 01:50:56,110
There was houses pretty
much right around it.

1866
01:50:56,111 --> 01:50:59,380
So we're going to overrun it and
there'll be no evidence you guys get to

1867
01:50:59,381 --> 01:51:02,320
accumulate your evidence. Why he came for
condos go up there. So that's awesome.

1868
01:51:02,350 --> 01:51:07,170
Right now, no. You'll notice
these, there's a series of
these alcoves here that,

1869
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:08,350
that you know,
these,

1870
01:51:08,380 --> 01:51:12,760
these horseshoe shape on the image of
dry falls back on the image of dry false.

1871
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:16,360
Exactly. And, and at some point somebody
is going to be able to see these images,

1872
01:51:16,361 --> 01:51:18,840
right? Yeah. Well people could
go and Google them online,

1873
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:22,450
but they'll see them right now on youtube
if they watched the youtube versus

1874
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:27,010
tube. Okay. So here's a typical
horseshoe falls of Niagara, which is,

1875
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:31,780
which is a modern, uh, cataract,
receding cataract. And this,

1876
01:51:31,781 --> 01:51:36,670
this horseshoe shape is very typical of
the way water will erode bedrock because

1877
01:51:36,671 --> 01:51:39,280
water flows faster in
the middle of the stream.

1878
01:51:39,610 --> 01:51:44,260
Therefore it roads faster in the middle
and not so much as you get towards the

1879
01:51:44,261 --> 01:51:47,950
margins. And so it creates this
classic horseshoe shape profile.

1880
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:51,450
And that's what we're
seeing here at dry falls.

1881
01:51:51,470 --> 01:51:55,870
Now this is just one of the alcoves of
about half a dozen of the alcoves that we

1882
01:51:55,871 --> 01:51:58,390
saw in the map of it.
How the words,

1883
01:51:58,391 --> 01:52:03,040
this is a monstrously big
waterfall. Yes. Now try today,

1884
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:07,480
just off to the left of the
picture is where I'm actually in.

1885
01:52:07,481 --> 01:52:12,190
There's a photograph in
Graham's book taken, um, from,

1886
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:15,640
let's go back. We skipped
over it. There it is.

1887
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:19,900
This is the viewpoint and
this is horseshoe falls of
Niagara superimposed on dry

1888
01:52:19,901 --> 01:52:23,050
fall. She can get a sense of the
scale. So Niagara Falls is a tiny,

1889
01:52:23,051 --> 01:52:27,700
tiny little thing by comparison with
this ancient fossilized waterfall,

1890
01:52:27,910 --> 01:52:30,160
which dates back 12,000,
800 years.

1891
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:34,270
Niagara Falls is the result of 12,000
or more years of work of the river.

1892
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:38,350
Dry falls between upper and lower at
grand coulee in Washington state is the

1893
01:52:38,351 --> 01:52:43,210
result of two weeks of flooding.
What? Yeah. And for people, look,

1894
01:52:43,211 --> 01:52:45,620
he's trying to explain this
for people that are, because

1895
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:50,480
it's, it's probably 10 times bigger plus
more than that. How many, how many times?

1896
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:53,930
It's two and a half times as
high and well figure this, the,

1897
01:52:54,260 --> 01:52:58,970
the discharge over of the Niagara River
over the falls is a couple of hundred

1898
01:52:58,970 --> 01:53:00,170
thousand cubic feet per second maximum.

1899
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:06,160
The discharge over Grand
Cooley was somewhere between
300 and 400 million cubic

1900
01:53:06,801 --> 01:53:11,720
feet per second or another words somewhere
between 10 and 20 times the combined

1901
01:53:11,721 --> 01:53:15,110
flow of every river on
earth flowing all at once.

1902
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:20,690
And the height of this scarf face here,
this cliff is about 400 feet.

1903
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:25,070
The water coming over
was about 400 feet deep.

1904
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:27,350
So if you are here,

1905
01:53:27,620 --> 01:53:30,830
visualize seat witnessing
this at the peak of the flood,

1906
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:32,780
you wouldn't in fact even see a waterfall.

1907
01:53:32,781 --> 01:53:37,781
What you would see is this massive
10 mile wide turgid river choked with

1908
01:53:38,781 --> 01:53:42,870
icebergs and debris and whole
forest river flowing at what?

1909
01:53:42,871 --> 01:53:45,710
60 70 miles an hour,
60 70 miles an hour.

1910
01:53:45,890 --> 01:53:50,360
What you would've seen here was just a
bump in this flood and then only at the

1911
01:53:50,361 --> 01:53:55,010
latter stages of it where did
actually have been a waterfall as the,

1912
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:59,480
as the water source was dissipating
and as the water was declining,

1913
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:02,510
you would have the final
stage of it being a waterfall.

1914
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:04,670
Then eventually the waterfall stopped.

1915
01:54:04,910 --> 01:54:08,210
And what you have today is this
fossilized feature of this massive,

1916
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:13,660
and this is only one of about a half
a dozen comparable sized cataracts.

1917
01:54:13,940 --> 01:54:18,940
We didn't get to see potholes or Frenchmen
Cooley next time perhaps I did a j

1918
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:21,800
anybody listening to this,
if he can do so,

1919
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:25,070
get up to Washington state and go
visit upper and lower at grand coulee.

1920
01:54:25,071 --> 01:54:28,850
It's as a stunning, stunning landscape
is a great trip to make. And, and,

1921
01:54:28,851 --> 01:54:31,970
and you can see the evidence on the,
on the ground and you know,

1922
01:54:31,971 --> 01:54:35,450
people don't know about, you know,
we've got like here, this is Utah.

1923
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:40,100
And what you see here is once you begin
to understand the cataract formation

1924
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,920
and, and you understand the
morphology of a cataract,

1925
01:54:42,921 --> 01:54:46,250
you're looking at something like this
in which we're looking at is cataracts

1926
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:51,380
extinct, cataracts out in Canyon Lands,
Utah and they're massively scaled.

1927
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:54,470
But no geologists. See,
here's the problem.

1928
01:54:54,471 --> 01:54:57,950
Geologists haven't been focused on
catastrophism what they've been doing.

1929
01:54:58,310 --> 01:55:01,450
They worked for the government, they
worked for the oil companies. They,

1930
01:55:01,470 --> 01:55:04,130
they're more interested
in what's down below that.

1931
01:55:04,160 --> 01:55:07,570
The match will gas the oil and stuff.
There's another point,

1932
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:09,590
there's another point I'd
like to add to that, Randall,

1933
01:55:09,591 --> 01:55:13,940
as to why geologists and not
a focused on catastrophes. Uh,

1934
01:55:13,970 --> 01:55:18,970
geology is a science and science in
effect defined itself as being different

1935
01:55:21,410 --> 01:55:23,090
from religious superstition.

1936
01:55:23,750 --> 01:55:28,430
So the notion of the great flood that
we find in the Bible became a very

1937
01:55:28,431 --> 01:55:31,050
discredited notion in science and,

1938
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:36,060
and the bye bye bye bye association with
any suggestion of a great cataclysm in

1939
01:55:38,691 --> 01:55:43,691
the past was seen as superstitious
behavior to be completely

1940
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:48,300
by the squeaky clean, shiny new sciences
who must never take that into account.

1941
01:55:48,301 --> 01:55:51,060
So any geologist good dares to propose.

1942
01:55:51,330 --> 01:55:55,860
A cataclysmic episode is up against that
right away that his colleagues don't

1943
01:55:55,861 --> 01:55:59,010
want to go there because they're afraid
that they're going to be accused of

1944
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:03,750
buying into Noah's flood or whatever.
That's so unfortunate, but it's true and,

1945
01:56:03,751 --> 01:56:05,400
and this is the, this is
the problem. So there's,

1946
01:56:05,580 --> 01:56:10,580
there's catastrophism and
uniformitarianism and the
prevailing dogma in geology

1947
01:56:11,101 --> 01:56:13,200
is the uniformitarian dogma,

1948
01:56:13,201 --> 01:56:16,290
which is basically to say the way
we see things in the world today.

1949
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:18,960
That's how it's always been.
It's never been any change.

1950
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:23,980
So random. What is the mainstream
understanding of those, those,

1951
01:56:24,190 --> 01:56:28,300
those formations? Like what? When they
look at those, the Utah ones, for example,

1952
01:56:28,330 --> 01:56:32,350
gigantic Utah. I have searched
and searched and I find nothing.

1953
01:56:33,070 --> 01:56:35,650
They just don't explain it. They
don't explain skull. Oh look,

1954
01:56:35,651 --> 01:56:38,440
how pretty do you think of the
flooding went as far South as Utah?

1955
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:41,030
Not directly glacial.
I think what we're looking there,

1956
01:56:41,031 --> 01:56:42,910
it has to be torrential rain.
Right?

1957
01:56:43,210 --> 01:56:47,320
Which was, which is another association
of this, of this impact picture.

1958
01:56:47,830 --> 01:56:51,680
This huge impacts on the ice cap.
An enormous amount of,

1959
01:56:51,710 --> 01:56:56,380
of watery material is thrown up into
the, into the atmosphere, not only water,

1960
01:56:56,381 --> 01:56:59,410
but also mud and,
and you get this rain out,

1961
01:56:59,710 --> 01:57:03,070
which comes down for a
long period after that.

1962
01:57:03,980 --> 01:57:07,430
And I'm not necessarily saying that
all of that was stripped in one event

1963
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:11,990
because the place to seen is basically
two and a half million years,

1964
01:57:12,470 --> 01:57:15,290
two point I think 2.6 million
is the latest dating of it.

1965
01:57:15,620 --> 01:57:20,620
And there's been probably a dozen or two
dozen ice ages that have come and gone.

1966
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:25,760
To me, the evidence I'm seeing suggests
that the transition from glacial to

1967
01:57:25,761 --> 01:57:29,870
interglacial and back again is
not a smooth process. In fact,

1968
01:57:29,871 --> 01:57:33,360
it's probably highly catastrophic,
um,

1969
01:57:33,530 --> 01:57:37,190
not necessarily as catastrophic as
the event we're talking about 12,000,

1970
01:57:37,191 --> 01:57:38,240
800 years ago,

1971
01:57:38,630 --> 01:57:42,670
but certainly catastrophic enough that
we're an event of equivalent magnitude to

1972
01:57:42,671 --> 01:57:46,280
happen today. We could maybe
not cause a mass extinction,

1973
01:57:46,310 --> 01:57:49,920
but we could certainly pull the
plug on modern civilization. Um,

1974
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:55,210
and so this, this picture is interesting
because what it does is it, it,

1975
01:57:55,211 --> 01:57:59,360
it shows that, you know, you
travel over the, this landscape.

1976
01:57:59,890 --> 01:58:03,650
Explain them what this picture
is and where's the cake?
You know, now this is, um,

1977
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:06,050
this is in,
uh,

1978
01:58:06,530 --> 01:58:11,270
western Montana and this is place
called dry creek. And what this is,

1979
01:58:11,271 --> 01:58:12,350
is just a gravel pit.

1980
01:58:12,770 --> 01:58:17,770
But what you see here is deposits caused
by searching floodwaters moving up

1981
01:58:18,530 --> 01:58:21,230
tributary valleys loaded with sediment.

1982
01:58:21,560 --> 01:58:26,560
And one of the things that is stratego
for a sedimentologist looks at is you

1983
01:58:26,871 --> 01:58:31,310
notice how they're tilted. You see how
the, the, the layers are tilted, okay?

1984
01:58:31,311 --> 01:58:34,640
That's an indication of which
direction the water is moving.

1985
01:58:35,210 --> 01:58:39,770
The tilting goes down in the
direction that the water is flowing.

1986
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:42,610
So what we see here is massive

1987
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:47,640
turbulent sediment laden floodwaters
back flooding up a valley,

1988
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:51,790
surging, leaving deposits,
and then flowing back out,

1989
01:58:52,030 --> 01:58:56,440
followed by another wave,
followed by another wave for now,

1990
01:58:56,441 --> 01:58:59,170
for 13,000 years,
12,000 years,

1991
01:58:59,290 --> 01:59:03,820
this material has been laying there and
you see that there's forests growing

1992
01:59:03,821 --> 01:59:05,170
over it,
okay?

1993
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:09,640
People traveling over this landscape
don't see what's under their feet,

1994
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:11,133
you see?

1995
01:59:11,290 --> 01:59:15,700
But once you get an outcrop like this
and you understand and you can read what

1996
01:59:15,701 --> 01:59:18,850
you're seeing here, then suddenly
it becomes apparent that the,

1997
01:59:19,090 --> 01:59:22,600
that the very hills and landscape,
that work that we live on,

1998
01:59:22,601 --> 01:59:26,800
that we've built our cities on and our
highways and that were playing out all

1999
01:59:26,801 --> 01:59:31,570
these dramas that right under our feet
is the evidence of previous worlds.

2000
01:59:31,571 --> 01:59:36,250
You have to understand that what you're
looking at there is the debris of a

2001
01:59:36,251 --> 01:59:41,251
former world that was pulverized by
these floods carried in and deposited and

2002
01:59:42,761 --> 01:59:46,090
now a new world has emerged out of that.

2003
01:59:46,090 --> 01:59:50,590
And on top of this wreckage
does room forma world existed,

2004
01:59:50,591 --> 01:59:52,690
I believe on advanced civilization.

2005
01:59:52,990 --> 01:59:57,010
That is memoralized and myths
and traditions all around
the world that is being

2006
01:59:57,011 --> 01:59:58,720
ridiculed by archeologists,

2007
01:59:58,721 --> 02:00:02,620
but it is insistent and the
evidence keeps on coming forward.

2008
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:06,370
Well, it all makes sense.
It really does. It's,

2009
02:00:06,371 --> 02:00:10,330
it's all shocking and
stunning and fantastic,

2010
02:00:10,331 --> 02:00:14,740
but it all makes sense. I
think it does make sense. And,
and, and I think it's, it's,

2011
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:16,690
it's something as part
of the human heritage,

2012
02:00:16,691 --> 02:00:19,180
it's something that we all have
to get to grips with. Again,

2013
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:24,510
this is one of the things
I find in encouraging about
developments in the world

2014
02:00:25,901 --> 02:00:29,260
today is that more and more people do
appear to be thinking for themselves.

2015
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:32,710
You know,
that there was a time when we,

2016
02:00:33,370 --> 02:00:37,060
we took the word of specialists,
Dr [inaudible] or professor,

2017
02:00:37,061 --> 02:00:39,830
why said this had to be true.
Uh,

2018
02:00:39,870 --> 02:00:43,540
that was so actually when I wrote
fingerprints of the Gods in 1995,

2019
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:47,410
that was the first argument
was the argument from
authority. The authorities say,

2020
02:00:47,411 --> 02:00:49,570
this cannot be so
therefore it does not sell.

2021
02:00:49,571 --> 02:00:52,870
And a lot of people just just bolt that.
What's changed,

2022
02:00:52,871 --> 02:00:56,980
I think in the last 20 years
is that, that, that, that, um,

2023
02:00:57,220 --> 02:01:01,240
subservience to authority has gone away.
It hasn't gone away completely,

2024
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:03,640
but we don't trust authority anymore,

2025
02:01:03,790 --> 02:01:07,360
rightly and properly because we've
been lied to by authority figures.

2026
02:01:07,361 --> 02:01:09,610
And we know they lied to
us and we saw the evidence,

2027
02:01:09,611 --> 02:01:13,780
whether it's politicians or
big corporations, you know
what the big religions,

2028
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:15,250
the, the, there's a,

2029
02:01:15,251 --> 02:01:19,420
there's an uprising against this and an
assertion of individual will and, and,

2030
02:01:19,421 --> 02:01:22,240
and have individual intellect
to inquire into the past.

2031
02:01:22,241 --> 02:01:26,280
And I think that that's why this,
this information now has, uh, is,

2032
02:01:26,290 --> 02:01:29,110
is coming at a time where it's falling on,
on fertile ground.

2033
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:31,780
There will still be a
lot of resistance to it.

2034
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:35,380
We can expect that resistance
to be fearless and to go on,

2035
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:40,370
but things are shifting in the world
just as our picture of the past is

2036
02:01:40,371 --> 02:01:40,881
shifting.

2037
02:01:40,881 --> 02:01:44,450
So our picture of who we are and what
we're meant to be doing here is shifting

2038
02:01:44,451 --> 02:01:47,360
as well. Have you guys thought about
coming together and doing a documentary?

2039
02:01:47,870 --> 02:01:51,290
I'd love to do a documentary around it.
Do you guys together? It's a must do.

2040
02:01:51,291 --> 02:01:55,550
I mean, it just seems like the book
is, I'm sure going to be fantastic,

2041
02:01:55,551 --> 02:01:58,020
but there's going to be people that
are just not going to read a book and

2042
02:01:58,030 --> 02:02:02,480
documentaries are so easy or you just
do is open your stupid mouth, lay down,

2043
02:02:02,990 --> 02:02:07,180
you know, turn on Netflix and
Bam, you know, you can absorb it.

2044
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:12,710
It's highly visual material and it's
visual and it's just what I'm saying.

2045
02:02:12,710 --> 02:02:16,280
It's so visual and the two of you
together, we need a crowdfund something.

2046
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:18,440
Can I make an appeal?
It's the first time I've ever done this.

2047
02:02:18,441 --> 02:02:20,900
It's a kind of loose ditch.
It's a little pitch. Okay.

2048
02:02:20,901 --> 02:02:22,910
I've never asked for this before,
but what I'm,

2049
02:02:22,911 --> 02:02:26,720
what I'm asking to those who value and
appreciate my work and feel that I'm

2050
02:02:26,721 --> 02:02:28,700
doing something useful in the world,

2051
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:33,620
please support my work by getting this
book because that is the best way to put

2052
02:02:33,621 --> 02:02:38,090
one finger up to the mainstream.
Archeology wants this book to go away.

2053
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:39,680
They want it to be forgotten.

2054
02:02:39,681 --> 02:02:42,350
It will never be reviewed
in any mainstream newspaper.

2055
02:02:42,650 --> 02:02:43,880
It will never be written about.

2056
02:02:43,881 --> 02:02:47,330
There will be no articles about it and
probably know television coverage either.

2057
02:02:47,331 --> 02:02:50,930
The only thing that can make
the difference is people
voting with their feet and

2058
02:02:50,931 --> 02:02:54,740
um, I'm asking that now are people that
thought in my work, people are huge,

2059
02:02:54,741 --> 02:02:57,290
huge fans of your
appearance is here and huge,

2060
02:02:57,291 --> 02:03:02,060
huge fans of your work and if this is,
this is the latest and greatest,

2061
02:03:02,061 --> 02:03:04,160
I'm sure people are going
to go out and buy in droves,

2062
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:07,070
so magicians of the gods
and get it on Amazon.

2063
02:03:07,070 --> 02:03:10,070
You can get it on your website and get
it pretty much everywhere that I go to my

2064
02:03:10,071 --> 02:03:12,080
website and all the,
all the links and the whole,

2065
02:03:12,110 --> 02:03:15,120
the whole background on the
on on the book is there. I,

2066
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:18,470
I hugely appreciate,

2067
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:22,400
deeply appreciate the support
that my readers have given me.

2068
02:03:22,401 --> 02:03:27,260
I would be nothing without my readers.
And that's why every time I do an event,

2069
02:03:27,320 --> 02:03:31,190
I sit there for two to three hours
afterwards talking to people and signing

2070
02:03:31,191 --> 02:03:34,970
books because the readers are the most
important people in my, in, in my,

2071
02:03:34,971 --> 02:03:39,230
in my universe. And there, there Wa
there who give me strength without,

2072
02:03:39,231 --> 02:03:43,220
without my readers. I'm literally
nothing and I value and appreciate them.

2073
02:03:43,221 --> 02:03:46,970
And I'm on a journey across America
now and I'm speaking in many,

2074
02:03:46,971 --> 02:03:50,390
many different cities and the
whole program is up on my website,

2075
02:03:50,391 --> 02:03:53,540
on the talks and events page and make
sure we tweaked that stuff and get that

2076
02:03:53,541 --> 02:03:54,440
information now.

2077
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:58,340
And I'll get that information out for
the entirety of the time you're here.

2078
02:03:58,341 --> 02:04:01,100
Just let me know where you're going
to be and I'll let everybody know when

2079
02:04:01,101 --> 02:04:05,370
you're going to be there. Since we're
plugging, I'd like to plug, I got this.

2080
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:10,340
What is that? Well, it's a a about a four
and a half hour presentation. Of course,

2081
02:04:10,341 --> 02:04:14,690
loads of graphics, um, radio clips,

2082
02:04:14,691 --> 02:04:18,770
animations, and it's all
you. Yeah. And what does it,

2083
02:04:18,771 --> 02:04:23,000
was it called cosmic patterns
and cycles of catastrophe? Well,

2084
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:26,540
we can go go to the sacred
geometry international website,

2085
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:31,370
or I think Cameron wheelchair who
you're Novak who introduced us, um,

2086
02:04:32,140 --> 02:04:35,990
has a, I think he's doing
a special on it. No. Okay.

2087
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:41,010
33% off or something. What does the
actual URL of the website? Well,

2088
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:45,150
it would be sacred geometry,
international.com. There it is.

2089
02:04:45,151 --> 02:04:49,530
Jamie's pulled it up right there. So
cosmic patterns and cycles of Catastrophe.

2090
02:04:49,590 --> 02:04:53,790
Yes. 33.33% off. What does that all about?

2091
02:04:54,550 --> 02:04:56,740
Don't have to ask Cameron
about that and some,

2092
02:04:56,940 --> 02:04:59,880
some hidden numerology in
there somewhere apparently.

2093
02:04:59,910 --> 02:05:03,540
And you'll notice coupon code
magicians. Ah, there you go.

2094
02:05:03,541 --> 02:05:08,310
Magicians of the gods must be a reference.
I think it'd probably corresponds. Um,

2095
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:13,050
so I, I really think that you guys have
to do one of these things together as a

2096
02:05:13,051 --> 02:05:16,080
documentary. I mean, I think it's
just, I think someone out there,

2097
02:05:16,081 --> 02:05:17,160
someone's listening to this,

2098
02:05:17,430 --> 02:05:21,360
probably some kooks that we don't
want doing this documentary,

2099
02:05:21,361 --> 02:05:24,330
but there's gotta be somebody out there
that's legit when you need to find them

2100
02:05:24,331 --> 02:05:28,230
and put it together. Yeah. I wanted to pay
tribute to Randall's work, right. Rent.

2101
02:05:28,290 --> 02:05:31,860
Randall is really important figure
in this field. And he's very,

2102
02:05:31,890 --> 02:05:35,360
he's very modest and he's been standing
back and, and you know, he's not,

2103
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:37,080
not been out there enough.

2104
02:05:37,110 --> 02:05:40,800
It's time that people understood the
fantastic knowledge that this man has and

2105
02:05:40,801 --> 02:05:44,060
they, the, the ground experience.
You can't beat that. Well,

2106
02:05:44,061 --> 02:05:48,840
I met Randall in cows early
two thousands, right? I, well,

2107
02:05:48,860 --> 02:05:51,720
when, when you were at the
punchline. Yeah. And Atlanta,

2108
02:05:52,230 --> 02:05:55,590
which doesn't even exist anymore.
10 years ago, I think it was,

2109
02:05:55,790 --> 02:06:00,130
it was quite awhile ago. And, uh, we had
this conversation after my show and he's,

2110
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:05,520
we were just sitting there talking to
me about the Holocene and all of these

2111
02:06:05,641 --> 02:06:08,850
different impacts.
And I remember walking away from it.

2112
02:06:09,010 --> 02:06:12,240
We talked for quite a while after
the show, but I remember going,

2113
02:06:12,270 --> 02:06:16,290
that might be the craziest fucking post
show conversation I've ever had because

2114
02:06:16,291 --> 02:06:19,140
usually, you know, after a comedy show
you have a conversation with people,

2115
02:06:19,141 --> 02:06:22,860
you know, hey, where's a good
place to eat? You know, a,
if you do, you like Atlanta,

2116
02:06:23,070 --> 02:06:24,540
you know,
normal stuff.

2117
02:06:24,840 --> 02:06:29,550
And he's just flooding me with
information. I'm like, who is this guy?

2118
02:06:30,030 --> 02:06:32,730
Well, I remember walking
away from it going, wow,

2119
02:06:32,790 --> 02:06:37,200
I had no idea that Joe Rogan really
related to all this stuff, you know? Oh,

2120
02:06:37,310 --> 02:06:40,860
I was fascinated.
I was surprised something there,

2121
02:06:40,861 --> 02:06:44,580
which is I'd like to say something
about you, Joe. Um, it's a phenomenon.

2122
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:48,030
I traveled all around the world
and I give presentations in,

2123
02:06:48,031 --> 02:06:51,390
in just countries everywhere
and everywhere I go,

2124
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:54,990
people come up to me and they said,
Joe Rogan sent this to you.

2125
02:06:55,110 --> 02:06:57,690
We know about your work because of,
because of Joe Rogan.

2126
02:06:57,691 --> 02:07:00,120
And I see that what you're
doing is exploring many,

2127
02:07:00,121 --> 02:07:02,490
many controversial areas in your,
in your show,

2128
02:07:02,820 --> 02:07:05,700
you're in a position of
power and your listeners,

2129
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:09,720
just as my readers on my strength,
your listeners or your strength,

2130
02:07:09,721 --> 02:07:10,930
they've put you in a position of power,

2131
02:07:10,931 --> 02:07:14,820
but you're a person who's using that
power for something really good.

2132
02:07:15,120 --> 02:07:18,900
There are so many people who are powerful
in the world of the media who just

2133
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,150
wasted away on Trivia and nothing.

2134
02:07:21,390 --> 02:07:24,480
You are bringing new information
to people all around the world.

2135
02:07:24,481 --> 02:07:27,210
And I can tell you, cause I meet
them every time I give an event.

2136
02:07:27,240 --> 02:07:28,950
You are enormously appreciated.

2137
02:07:29,070 --> 02:07:32,400
Well I appreciate them very much and I
appreciate you guys and I appreciate this

2138
02:07:32,401 --> 02:07:36,580
show because this, this whole thing
came about without any planning.

2139
02:07:36,610 --> 02:07:41,110
This show just sort of became itself.
It's almost like I was a,

2140
02:07:41,111 --> 02:07:43,690
I would just happen to be there
to germinate it or something.

2141
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:49,200
I just tried to get out of my own
way as much as possible and follow my

2142
02:07:49,211 --> 02:07:49,961
curiosity.

2143
02:07:49,961 --> 02:07:54,961
And the beautiful thing about people like
you guys is without you take away you

2144
02:07:56,051 --> 02:07:59,830
and fingerprints of the gods takeaway you.
And what are we looking at?

2145
02:08:00,010 --> 02:08:05,010
I mean is it's very rare when you have
two human beings that without them an

2146
02:08:05,591 --> 02:08:10,591
entire field of study would be barren
of a great deal of its information.

2147
02:08:11,470 --> 02:08:14,020
I mean you have John Anthony
West and Robert Schoch who,

2148
02:08:14,021 --> 02:08:15,650
and you were obviously a part of all that.

2149
02:08:15,651 --> 02:08:18,370
And John Anthony West who's
absolutely fascinating,

2150
02:08:18,990 --> 02:08:20,740
fascinating guy and another guy.

2151
02:08:20,750 --> 02:08:25,750
Why did Lima line a guy who's ignored
but magical Egypt is one of the greatest

2152
02:08:26,951 --> 02:08:30,340
DVD series to this day that
I've ever seen in my life.

2153
02:08:30,340 --> 02:08:34,450
And if you've got the time
and the attention span to
sit down and watch all of

2154
02:08:34,451 --> 02:08:36,880
them, it is amazing. Amazing.

2155
02:08:36,881 --> 02:08:39,170
John Anthony West is one of my
favorite people on the plant.

2156
02:08:39,180 --> 02:08:41,110
He's incredibly brilliant researcher.

2157
02:08:41,140 --> 02:08:45,430
John more than anybody else who opened my
mind to the mysteries of ancient Egypt.

2158
02:08:45,970 --> 02:08:49,990
Fantastic work. And he's a world treasure.
He is a will treasure. He's a great,

2159
02:08:49,991 --> 02:08:54,450
great, great man. And I
think that DVD series is, uh,

2160
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:59,460
is just one pedal when unfolding of the
great flower of information that you

2161
02:09:01,481 --> 02:09:04,750
guys are presenting. And I think, and
another name, I'll drop it in there,

2162
02:09:04,751 --> 02:09:07,660
which is Robert Bovard. They
originated. Yeah, Ron Gosh.

2163
02:09:07,990 --> 02:09:12,040
He's done so much to bring back attention
to the importance of the skies and the

2164
02:09:12,041 --> 02:09:15,310
HR world and what it means for our
understanding of our past. And again,

2165
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:19,300
his evidence also points back to
this period of 12,800 years ago.

2166
02:09:19,330 --> 02:09:20,170
And while we're at it,

2167
02:09:20,171 --> 02:09:24,010
Robert Schoch early stock stuck his neck
out from Boston University and really

2168
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:27,640
one of the first mainstream scholars
that went out on a limb and said,

2169
02:09:27,641 --> 02:09:30,400
we are absolutely
looking at water erosion.

2170
02:09:30,401 --> 02:09:35,330
Robert Shuck is a key figure in this
field. He's very courageous to have to,

2171
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:38,290
to be a mainstream academic,
to be a professor of geology at Boston.

2172
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:42,430
It was John West who introduced Robert
Schoch to the notion that the Sphinx

2173
02:09:42,431 --> 02:09:46,240
might be much older, that the
weathering on it didn't fit with the,

2174
02:09:46,270 --> 02:09:49,860
with the picture of history at John took
Robert Shuck to Egypt and Robert Shuck

2175
02:09:49,861 --> 02:09:54,310
went with the data and he stuck his neck
out and he's taken a lot of criticisms

2176
02:09:54,311 --> 02:09:57,940
and tax for it. But he's a very, very
important player in this field. Well,

2177
02:09:57,941 --> 02:09:59,650
all of you guys are just massively,

2178
02:09:59,651 --> 02:10:04,651
massively important and this is such a
unique and satisfying object of curiosity

2179
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:08,530
for me at least when when I start
thinking about these things,

2180
02:10:08,531 --> 02:10:11,680
it's almost like little things start
firing off in my brain. It's so,

2181
02:10:11,681 --> 02:10:12,880
it's so exciting.

2182
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:16,390
I mean it's horrific to think about the
poor people that lived back then that

2183
02:10:16,391 --> 02:10:20,610
got hit by these massive impacts
and the the, the, this, the,

2184
02:10:20,611 --> 02:10:23,080
the aftermath of it all.
It must've been insane.

2185
02:10:23,081 --> 02:10:28,081
But to think about now in 2015 the
slow unveiling of all of this data and

2186
02:10:30,491 --> 02:10:34,160
information and he has you
as it all gets into focus

2187
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:38,300
and you try to get a clearer and
clearer view of what could have possibly

2188
02:10:38,450 --> 02:10:39,410
happened in the past.

2189
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:43,880
I find it so incredibly
enriching and fascinating to me.

2190
02:10:43,881 --> 02:10:47,240
One of the most exciting aspects of,
of the the,

2191
02:10:47,241 --> 02:10:51,920
there's the potential of archeology. Yeah.
Just to, to be able to discover like, oh,

2192
02:10:51,921 --> 02:10:56,600
that's what happened.
Ah, kind of Aha moment.

2193
02:10:57,020 --> 02:11:02,020
Suddenly the pieces fall into place and
we understand what we forgot and again,

2194
02:11:02,481 --> 02:11:03,330
it's cement.

2195
02:11:03,370 --> 02:11:07,430
That statement that you
made that resonated with me
that we are a civilization

2196
02:11:07,431 --> 02:11:12,320
with amnesia. We just knocked
on the head and we lost a lot.

2197
02:11:12,580 --> 02:11:15,530
I lost a lot of them, but there is that
haunting sense of incompleteness within,

2198
02:11:15,620 --> 02:11:18,170
within so many of us that
comes from that loss of memory.

2199
02:11:18,171 --> 02:11:22,760
I feel like any amnesiac has a sense
of something missing whole species.

2200
02:11:22,761 --> 02:11:25,460
How that,
I think what makes this really so potent

2201
02:11:25,530 --> 02:11:30,300
is the fact that there are considerable
implications for our own future. Oh,

2202
02:11:30,301 --> 02:11:34,860
absolutely. You know how Graham wraps up
the book really is, is about our future,

2203
02:11:35,580 --> 02:11:37,350
you know, and, and once,

2204
02:11:37,351 --> 02:11:41,970
now that we've integrated this
information into our world view, you know,

2205
02:11:42,240 --> 02:11:43,950
what does it imply in terms of,

2206
02:11:43,951 --> 02:11:48,951
of where we go from here because one of
the things that I track and if you could

2207
02:11:49,230 --> 02:11:52,020
shut the, throw this up on
a screen for just a second,

2208
02:11:52,021 --> 02:11:56,100
I'm going to speed through something
really quick here so that you can kind of

2209
02:11:56,101 --> 02:12:00,510
get the impression 1989, 1989. Let me get,

2210
02:12:01,390 --> 02:12:03,830
um, let me just, you

2211
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:08,220
giant asteroid Mace, close call by
Earl Randall's fixing that. Let's also,

2212
02:12:08,250 --> 02:12:10,650
let's also remind that we had a close,

2213
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:15,410
relatively close pass with
a half kilometer wide,
actually bit of a comet, uh,

2214
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:17,040
just over Halloween.
Um,

2215
02:12:17,041 --> 02:12:22,041
and the interesting thing is that NASA
only found that object on the 10th of

2216
02:12:22,470 --> 02:12:24,270
October and it okay,
it missed us.

2217
02:12:24,271 --> 02:12:27,720
It passed about the distance of the moon
from the earth. That's not that far.

2218
02:12:27,750 --> 02:12:30,150
That's not that far.
But the key thing is,

2219
02:12:30,270 --> 02:12:34,260
the key thing is that they only
found it a few days before it passed.

2220
02:12:34,650 --> 02:12:39,000
And how many other objects are out and
about half a kilometer wide hospital over

2221
02:12:39,001 --> 02:12:39,271
to why?

2222
02:12:39,271 --> 02:12:44,271
So the one that hit tongue goose
car was 100 meters to tiny.

2223
02:12:46,530 --> 02:12:47,640
This is a minimum,

2224
02:12:47,820 --> 02:12:52,820
a minimum of 150 to 200 times
the volume of turn goose.

2225
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:57,780
And when you look at the universe
and just look at our galaxy,

2226
02:12:57,781 --> 02:13:00,420
the size of our galaxy,
and look at our solar system,

2227
02:13:00,540 --> 02:13:04,320
the size of our solar system, that is
literally like getting grazed by a bullet.

2228
02:13:05,310 --> 02:13:06,900
It's like getting great.
Absolutely.

2229
02:13:08,940 --> 02:13:12,420
That's a good analogy is a
really good analogy. When
you think about it, you know,

2230
02:13:12,540 --> 02:13:14,550
you'd say, well, a half a kilometer

2231
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:18,770
compared to the earth, that's not big.
But like when you know, you think,

2232
02:13:18,771 --> 02:13:22,880
think of a, a slug from,
uh, from uh, uh, 32, right?

2233
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:25,970
If I threw it at you and hit you with it,
it wouldn't do much.

2234
02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:29,030
But if I accelerate it to
a thousand feet per second,

2235
02:13:29,330 --> 02:13:31,980
it's going to cause extreme trauma,
right?

2236
02:13:32,430 --> 02:13:36,930
But now we're looking at these asteroids
flying and comment debris and there 10

2237
02:13:36,931 --> 02:13:37,291
times,

2238
02:13:37,291 --> 02:13:41,370
20 times the speed of a rifle bullet when
they hit our atmosphere like you know,

2239
02:13:41,371 --> 02:13:45,920
50 60 70,000 miles per hour and the the,

2240
02:13:46,020 --> 02:13:50,400
the kinetic punch of something
like that is inconceivable.

2241
02:13:50,401 --> 02:13:53,100
It's like Graham said,
I mean to talk about it,

2242
02:13:53,101 --> 02:13:57,380
you'd have to take our
entire nuclear arsenal of,

2243
02:13:57,390 --> 02:13:59,190
of the peak of the Cold War,

2244
02:13:59,210 --> 02:14:03,210
detonate it all at once and even that
would only be a fraction of the forces

2245
02:14:03,211 --> 02:14:06,330
unleashed. Nope. No. Watch this.
I'm going to go through this real,

2246
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:10,300
real quick here and you'll
get the idea, I think, um,

2247
02:14:11,430 --> 02:14:12,300
that we're,
we're at,

2248
02:14:12,301 --> 02:14:17,301
because astronomers are looking out into
our cosmic environment and this is what

2249
02:14:18,241 --> 02:14:22,410
they're seeing. Look at this lights only
back here is most of us are listening.

2250
02:14:22,470 --> 02:14:26,880
Nine objects have come close
to the earth since 1991.

2251
02:14:27,930 --> 02:14:28,291
Right?

2252
02:14:28,291 --> 02:14:33,090
Current pre read that asteroid
estimates are too low.

2253
02:14:33,120 --> 02:14:37,470
This was October of 2000 current
predictions for the number of potentially

2254
02:14:37,471 --> 02:14:38,640
dangerous,
sorry.

2255
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:43,050
Dangerous Asteroids have
been underestimated by at
least 20% say astronomers

2256
02:14:43,290 --> 02:14:47,790
according to re recent calculations
there between 750 and 900 asteroids.

2257
02:14:47,810 --> 02:14:52,260
Let me circling the earth. That number
has changed. That reports from October,

2258
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:56,400
2000 we're now looking at the estimates
and now that it's 100,000, uh,

2259
02:14:56,430 --> 02:15:00,840
potentially earth destroying objects
that are on earth crossing orbits.

2260
02:15:00,870 --> 02:15:02,160
This isn't,
this is an estimate.

2261
02:15:02,161 --> 02:15:06,090
The problem is NASA has only identified
a tiny fraction of what's out there.

2262
02:15:06,091 --> 02:15:09,570
And again, I'm not saying this cause
I want to spread gloom and doom.

2263
02:15:09,750 --> 02:15:10,583
I'm saying this,

2264
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:15,420
I'm saying this because we have the
capacity to do something about it, right?

2265
02:15:15,630 --> 02:15:20,490
It takes goodwill on the part of the human
race to stop wasting money on stupid,

2266
02:15:20,491 --> 02:15:23,190
stupid pursuits,
particularly warfare.

2267
02:15:23,490 --> 02:15:26,490
And to apply that resource,

2268
02:15:26,491 --> 02:15:29,820
those resources to sweeping,
clean our cosmic environment,

2269
02:15:29,821 --> 02:15:32,460
the technology already exists.
It's going to cause a,

2270
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:35,700
I mean it's going to have to be,

2271
02:15:35,701 --> 02:15:39,390
there's going to have to be a
massive shift in our attention.

2272
02:15:39,391 --> 02:15:44,391
Like there has to almost be an event that
takes place that makes people wake up.

2273
02:15:44,610 --> 02:15:47,820
Right. We have world asteroid day right
now. Some prominent figures in behind it,

2274
02:15:47,821 --> 02:15:50,220
like Brian May, I think it was
one of the guitarists with Queen,

2275
02:15:50,490 --> 02:15:53,180
if I remember correctly. There's,
there's a there, there, there,

2276
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:56,040
there is publicity around
so-called world asteroid day,

2277
02:15:56,250 --> 02:15:57,960
but nobody's taking it seriously.

2278
02:15:57,961 --> 02:16:00,420
We don't take anything
seriously unless it's smacks us.

2279
02:16:00,421 --> 02:16:02,580
Like people don't quit
cigarettes until they get cancer.

2280
02:16:02,820 --> 02:16:06,750
There's something about human beings
that we don't consider the pos.

2281
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:10,530
We have this idea in our head that we're
eternal and we're going to live forever

2282
02:16:10,531 --> 02:16:13,020
and everything's gonna be fine.
Just I just need a new Lexus.

2283
02:16:13,050 --> 02:16:15,030
You know what I mean?
Well, you have this wacky,

2284
02:16:15,031 --> 02:16:18,580
I just need this watch that I've added
my eye on this laptop that I want to buy

2285
02:16:18,650 --> 02:16:20,970
it.
If something happened,

2286
02:16:21,150 --> 02:16:24,320
if a massive collision hit China.
Yeah.

2287
02:16:24,570 --> 02:16:29,570
And it wiped out like several million
people and then cause the earth to go into

2288
02:16:29,981 --> 02:16:33,970
nuclear winter and crops died and we
experiment experience global famine,

2289
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:38,710
then something like that, then we
would wake up and go, all right Russia,

2290
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:41,150
let's talk,
let's get together.

2291
02:16:41,440 --> 02:16:43,960
I'm hoping that it doesn't take
anything quite that extreme.

2292
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:47,530
If we had a repeat of tin goose can 1908,

2293
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:49,960
I think that would be enough to do it.
That would be nice.

2294
02:16:49,980 --> 02:16:54,040
But would it be because there was this
incident in Russia that was last year.

2295
02:16:54,041 --> 02:16:56,240
There was caught on all those
dashboard cameras. Yeah.

2296
02:16:56,300 --> 02:16:57,670
Where's the wonderful thing about Russia?

2297
02:16:57,780 --> 02:17:02,780
It's apparently there's so
much like insurance crime
and so many collisions with

2298
02:17:03,251 --> 02:17:06,770
each other that a lot of people over
in Russia have dash cam. Okay. Right.

2299
02:17:06,820 --> 02:17:09,970
I was wondering why.
So because of those dash cams,

2300
02:17:10,150 --> 02:17:15,140
that's how we have all this footage
of these, these meteors that,

2301
02:17:15,290 --> 02:17:18,370
that uh, blew up in the
atmosphere and didn't even land.

2302
02:17:18,371 --> 02:17:23,371
But we have some from inside schools
where people were watching like this thing

2303
02:17:23,921 --> 02:17:26,800
happened and go down and that
was nothing. And now, yeah,

2304
02:17:26,801 --> 02:17:31,150
there was a fraction of the size of the
Tunguska event, but nobody was killed.

2305
02:17:31,510 --> 02:17:36,070
You see if, if that object had
been a little bigger, if it's been,

2306
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:38,260
if it's a PR,
a little or the little dancer,

2307
02:17:38,410 --> 02:17:40,430
it's angle of approach
had been a little steeper.

2308
02:17:40,450 --> 02:17:45,280
You might've been looking at 1500
deaths rather than just 1500 injuries.

2309
02:17:45,730 --> 02:17:48,550
I think that would have been
a wake up call. Perhaps.

2310
02:17:48,580 --> 02:17:52,480
Maybe not enough to reorient civilization,

2311
02:17:52,720 --> 02:17:57,720
but I guarantee you a tongue goose go
event over a major inhabited area of the

2312
02:17:57,791 --> 02:18:00,390
globe wiping out a million people.
I,

2313
02:18:01,270 --> 02:18:06,270
I can't imagine that that wouldn't have
some kind of a effect on our attitude

2314
02:18:06,341 --> 02:18:11,341
towards our are in our vulnerability in
the cosmos and make people think maybe

2315
02:18:11,381 --> 02:18:14,830
there's something bigger we need to be
paying attention to here rather than,

2316
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:19,120
you know, um, Kardashians
melting vulnerable.

2317
02:18:19,170 --> 02:18:22,720
This is the illusion created by,
by modern technology.

2318
02:18:22,750 --> 02:18:27,450
We need to make a war on asteroids.
Like we have a war on terror. You know,

2319
02:18:27,460 --> 02:18:28,380
Congress,
we'll just

2320
02:18:30,020 --> 02:18:33,100
kind of at least that would
be a useful project yes. Is,

2321
02:18:33,101 --> 02:18:36,880
is to actually do something that could
benefit and say human race instead of

2322
02:18:36,881 --> 02:18:39,690
Moses profitable and hatred.
But see that's the thing.

2323
02:18:39,700 --> 02:18:43,990
These asteroids are actually
extraordinary sources of resources,

2324
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:45,400
natural resources,

2325
02:18:45,401 --> 02:18:49,810
platinum group metals and hydrocarbons
and water and precious metals.

2326
02:18:49,810 --> 02:18:54,220
All of these things that we're mining
from the earth now exist in those

2327
02:18:54,221 --> 02:18:56,260
asteroids that are threatening the planet.

2328
02:18:56,860 --> 02:19:01,860
And we're not that far away from being
able to develop the technologies in the

2329
02:19:01,971 --> 02:19:06,960
industries to actually go and rendezvous
with an asteroid. Of course it's, it's,

2330
02:19:06,961 --> 02:19:11,230
it's a matter of, like Graham was saying,
I mean this last Halloween asteroid,

2331
02:19:11,290 --> 02:19:14,710
they didn't find it, but a couple of
weeks before it passed by the earth.

2332
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:17,280
So we need a lot more,
um,

2333
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:21,540
capabilities of seeing what's out there.
Um,

2334
02:19:22,150 --> 02:19:24,820
and we're developing that
but at a very slow pace.

2335
02:19:25,030 --> 02:19:28,130
So there are practical suggestions
that come out of all of this.

2336
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:30,200
This isn't just about the past.
As Randall said,

2337
02:19:30,201 --> 02:19:33,650
this is also about the future of the
human race and what we do and how we,

2338
02:19:33,830 --> 02:19:38,480
how we live on this, on this gorgeous
planet that the universe gave us and,

2339
02:19:38,490 --> 02:19:42,920
and how we pay back for being given
that opportunity. And so the, the

2340
02:19:43,490 --> 02:19:48,490
current ideas are to somehow or another
nudge these asteroids out of the way.

2341
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:51,130
Well,
10 different technologies to do it.

2342
02:19:51,131 --> 02:19:54,540
What you don't really want to do is to
blow it up with the nuclear, right? Right.

2343
02:19:54,640 --> 02:19:58,480
Because then you get back shot
instead of a single bullet.

2344
02:19:59,320 --> 02:20:03,280
Buckshot can do a lot of harm as well
and it may even push it into a more

2345
02:20:03,281 --> 02:20:07,120
catastrophic orbit. So you don't want to
do that. But what you can do, for example,

2346
02:20:07,121 --> 02:20:12,121
is to change the reflectivity of one
side of the asteroid or comet fragments.

2347
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:14,350
Uh,
you can alter that effectively,

2348
02:20:14,370 --> 02:20:17,920
paint it and that affects
the sun's radiation upon it.

2349
02:20:17,921 --> 02:20:20,560
And that would be enough to shift
it slightly out of its course.

2350
02:20:20,561 --> 02:20:21,394
There are a lot of,

2351
02:20:21,430 --> 02:20:25,330
there are a lot of techniques and
suggestions or nudges that this is you.

2352
02:20:25,331 --> 02:20:27,010
You put your finger on
exactly the right word.

2353
02:20:27,011 --> 02:20:30,190
This is another of the technologies that
you just nudge these things you just

2354
02:20:30,191 --> 02:20:30,561
don't need.

2355
02:20:30,561 --> 02:20:34,180
You just don't need to do much and you
put them into a safe place instead of a

2356
02:20:34,181 --> 02:20:35,014
dangerous place.

2357
02:20:35,690 --> 02:20:39,440
Czar idea that there's
hundreds of thousands of
killers out there and you just

2358
02:20:39,441 --> 02:20:41,270
have to excuse me from over there please.

2359
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:46,310
A little bit of this and then also
we have to look out for all of them.

2360
02:20:46,311 --> 02:20:49,220
The ones that are coming from down there,
the ones that are coming from up here,

2361
02:20:49,250 --> 02:20:53,050
three dimensional space. That
got a real, I have to think of,

2362
02:20:53,060 --> 02:20:54,790
because when we look at the sky,
oh,

2363
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:57,980
hope and asteroids not coming
our way from where fucker.

2364
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:01,880
You know the last thing is crazy and is
it coming from the direction of the sun

2365
02:21:01,881 --> 02:21:04,090
so that we can see it
except very special camera.

2366
02:21:04,091 --> 02:21:06,830
That was the case with tin
goose. It came out. In fact,

2367
02:21:06,831 --> 02:21:08,060
if you read the eyewitness accounts,

2368
02:21:08,061 --> 02:21:11,580
they describe how it looks like was
being disgorged from to Sun. Oh.

2369
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:14,630
Are being expelled from to or
was like a second son in the sky.

2370
02:21:14,630 --> 02:21:17,030
And that was because that,
that um,

2371
02:21:17,210 --> 02:21:22,010
summertime towards stream is coming
from behind the sun. Yeah. And um,

2372
02:21:23,030 --> 02:21:26,960
and so yeah, you can't see him if
because of the gravity of the sun,

2373
02:21:26,961 --> 02:21:31,760
the mass of the sun. Doesn't that affect
how we see things behind it anyway? Yeah,

2374
02:21:31,761 --> 02:21:35,820
it should do, it should
warps it warps vision. Yeah.

2375
02:21:36,020 --> 02:21:39,630
So like something could be coming
from behind the sun and we, we,

2376
02:21:39,631 --> 02:21:43,670
we literally would not even see it because
of the mass and gravity of the sun if

2377
02:21:43,671 --> 02:21:44,750
it was in the right area.

2378
02:21:45,150 --> 02:21:49,070
Can Goucho was not seen really
until it came into the atmosphere,

2379
02:21:50,010 --> 02:21:51,710
maybe into the atmosphere.

2380
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:54,890
But that was obviously a long time
ago and there was not nearly as much

2381
02:21:54,891 --> 02:21:57,020
observation. The skies as
there are today. Right.

2382
02:21:57,500 --> 02:22:01,160
These are the, um, the steps
that we, we, we, we need to take.

2383
02:22:01,161 --> 02:22:04,260
We need to grow up as a,
as a species when you leave our,

2384
02:22:04,530 --> 02:22:06,950
our childhood a bit behind.

2385
02:22:07,340 --> 02:22:12,340
It's interesting to speculate
what would happen if we had,

2386
02:22:12,690 --> 02:22:13,220
uh,

2387
02:22:13,220 --> 02:22:18,220
impacts on the scale that happens 12,800
years ago and I'm pretty sure that it

2388
02:22:19,611 --> 02:22:22,190
would mean if it,
if it were allowed to happen,

2389
02:22:22,250 --> 02:22:26,130
that it would mean the end
of our civilization. This,
this civilization would

2390
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:30,960
go down. This is a very intensely
specialized civilization.

2391
02:22:30,961 --> 02:22:31,411
I think the,

2392
02:22:31,411 --> 02:22:35,580
the just in time principle is that we
have two day or three day food supply in

2393
02:22:35,581 --> 02:22:36,414
our cities.

2394
02:22:36,540 --> 02:22:40,440
You interrupt that and you have a
kind of walking dead scenario within,

2395
02:22:40,441 --> 02:22:43,010
within a week. You know, it's
that it's that bad. There's this,

2396
02:22:43,020 --> 02:22:46,470
this civilization is,
appears to be very strong,

2397
02:22:46,830 --> 02:22:50,790
but in fact it's very fragile
and it could easily fall apart.

2398
02:22:50,850 --> 02:22:55,850
And so many of us in the
western technological world
actually have no survival

2399
02:22:56,551 --> 02:22:57,690
skills whatsoever.

2400
02:22:57,750 --> 02:23:02,700
We don't know how to survive because we
depend for our survival upon the complex

2401
02:23:02,701 --> 02:23:05,400
network of society.
Who would survive.

2402
02:23:05,550 --> 02:23:08,280
A cataclysm like that would
be the hunter gatherers,

2403
02:23:08,520 --> 02:23:11,970
people like the hunter gatherers of
the Kalahari in southern Africa or the

2404
02:23:11,971 --> 02:23:15,420
hunter gatherers of the Amazon Basin.
You know, the meek of the world.

2405
02:23:15,450 --> 02:23:18,570
Those who are not taken into
account in the world at all today.

2406
02:23:18,780 --> 02:23:20,610
They're the ones equipped both with the,

2407
02:23:20,910 --> 02:23:25,910
the the knowledge and the psychological
resources to deal with a situation like

2408
02:23:26,011 --> 02:23:30,930
that and to carry the human story forward.
And I just want to make sure,

2409
02:23:30,931 --> 02:23:32,930
if I can,
if I can play some part in this,

2410
02:23:32,950 --> 02:23:37,950
I just want to make sure
that the descendants of
those hunter gatherers 10,000

2411
02:23:38,461 --> 02:23:43,461
years in the future are not remembering
faintly and vaguely a great lost

2412
02:23:44,281 --> 02:23:46,590
civilization and magical civilization,

2413
02:23:46,591 --> 02:23:51,060
which had the ability to go to the moon,
which had the ability to,

2414
02:23:51,061 --> 02:23:54,200
one person could speak to another person
on the other side of the planet and

2415
02:23:54,270 --> 02:23:54,661
magical,

2416
02:23:54,661 --> 02:23:59,661
magical powers which was destroyed
because of its own arrogance and cruelty.

2417
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:03,990
And that lost civilization
of course would be us. Well,

2418
02:24:04,230 --> 02:24:09,230
one of the things has been disturbing
me as I got older is the idea of print

2419
02:24:09,780 --> 02:24:11,040
about, uh, books,

2420
02:24:11,640 --> 02:24:16,380
sort of going away and everything is
becoming digital and digital to the form

2421
02:24:16,381 --> 02:24:19,650
that you can only read with an operating
system and a computer and a CPU and all

2422
02:24:19,651 --> 02:24:23,460
that jazz. If without all that, it's
nothing. It's not look at a hard drive.

2423
02:24:23,461 --> 02:24:26,240
It's just there's nothing there.
Just electrons take away,

2424
02:24:26,250 --> 02:24:30,920
take away the software and it'll
never be read again. Yeah. And what,

2425
02:24:30,930 --> 02:24:35,400
what evidence would there be a thousand
years from now of us if something were

2426
02:24:35,401 --> 02:24:39,270
to happen? It might be anybody might be
some weed. No, they were computer disks,

2427
02:24:39,271 --> 02:24:42,600
but the descendants of that time
would have no idea what they were.

2428
02:24:42,601 --> 02:24:43,530
And even if they did,

2429
02:24:43,531 --> 02:24:46,170
they'd have no way of accessing and
a thousand years from now they would

2430
02:24:46,171 --> 02:24:49,020
deteriorate to nothing. Anything,
nothing. All the plastic would be gone,

2431
02:24:49,021 --> 02:24:51,230
everything. It would just be
a complete, a complete mess.

2432
02:24:51,380 --> 02:24:56,160
That's where I look at megalithic
stone architecture is being a textbook.

2433
02:24:56,190 --> 02:24:59,700
Yeah. That's how you might
preserve things in another way.

2434
02:24:59,701 --> 02:25:03,480
You might preserve things if you're
developed a mythology around this whole

2435
02:25:03,481 --> 02:25:08,481
scenario and then you projected it onto
the night sky so that generations later

2436
02:25:09,541 --> 02:25:12,770
they would tell these
tales based upon the,

2437
02:25:12,771 --> 02:25:16,140
the mythological figures
juxtaposed on the night sky.

2438
02:25:16,650 --> 02:25:21,600
And there would be the story because it's
there. It's, it's all the whole mythos.

2439
02:25:21,601 --> 02:25:25,780
Western mythology has been
juxtaposed onto the fixed stars.

2440
02:25:26,170 --> 02:25:31,060
And so that's one way perhaps of,
of preserving information. Um,

2441
02:25:31,220 --> 02:25:34,690
and the other way I think is,
is massive stone architecture.

2442
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:38,350
So it's clearly not an accident
that the great pyramid in codes,

2443
02:25:38,351 --> 02:25:41,610
the dimensions of our planet
routine close to them. You, you,

2444
02:25:41,611 --> 02:25:46,611
you measured the base perimeter of the
Great Pyramid and multiply it by 43,200

2445
02:25:47,650 --> 02:25:51,490
and you get the equatorial circumference
of the earth. Why that number? The well,

2446
02:25:51,540 --> 02:25:54,400
that's the key thing. And I'll come
to that in a second. If I may. Uh,

2447
02:25:54,401 --> 02:25:57,820
you take the height of the great pyramid,
multiply that by 43,000,

2448
02:25:57,821 --> 02:26:02,200
200 and you get the polar radius of the
earth. Actually Egypt told to know this,

2449
02:26:02,201 --> 02:26:05,650
but they say it's a complete coincidence
cause what's the significance of the

2450
02:26:05,651 --> 02:26:09,100
number 43,200 but actually it's
a highly significant number.

2451
02:26:09,340 --> 02:26:13,780
It's a number that is found embedded
in mythology all around the world.

2452
02:26:14,050 --> 02:26:19,050
And it is a multiple of the number 72
it's actually 600 times 72 and 72 is the

2453
02:26:20,141 --> 02:26:24,880
heartbeat of the processional cycle.
One degree of change every 72 years.

2454
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:29,260
So what they've actually done is they've
given us the dimensions of our planet

2455
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:33,820
on a scale defined by
emotion of the planet itself.

2456
02:26:33,910 --> 02:26:38,470
And that in my shoe is incredibly clever
way to pass information down to the

2457
02:26:38,471 --> 02:26:38,801
future.

2458
02:26:38,801 --> 02:26:43,150
That way they can be sure that any
astronomically literate society could work

2459
02:26:43,151 --> 02:26:46,750
this out. The information would be
there. So in all those dark ages,

2460
02:26:46,990 --> 02:26:50,350
when we had no knowledge that
we even lived on a planet,

2461
02:26:50,380 --> 02:26:55,380
or what its dimensions where those
dimensions were encoded into the enduring

2462
02:26:55,901 --> 02:26:58,870
structure of the Great Pyramid
of monument as the Arab say,

2463
02:26:58,871 --> 02:27:02,650
that time itself would fear
the great pyramids themselves.

2464
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:07,680
The Great Pyramid of Giza in particular
is so spectacular that it almost,

2465
02:27:08,110 --> 02:27:11,130
it almost makes you go, man, there
had to be something going on there.

2466
02:27:11,140 --> 02:27:13,540
Then we must be missing
part of this picture.

2467
02:27:13,541 --> 02:27:15,250
Cause you're talking about
something that would be,

2468
02:27:15,580 --> 02:27:19,050
I've heard people say we could
reproduce it today. Of course we could.

2469
02:27:19,051 --> 02:27:20,680
And of course we could.
We can.

2470
02:27:20,740 --> 02:27:24,850
Can you make a stone that's the size of
one of the stones in the Great Pyramid?

2471
02:27:24,851 --> 02:27:28,960
Yes. Yeah. Well then we can make the
pyramid, but how long would it take? Yeah.

2472
02:27:29,020 --> 02:27:32,890
How hard would it be and where would be
the will and you'd have to be perfect.

2473
02:27:32,891 --> 02:27:37,300
Yeah. In order to get it to line up at
the top. The way it sets. Yeah, exactly.

2474
02:27:37,301 --> 02:27:39,670
You can't be off by a fraction of an inch,

2475
02:27:39,671 --> 02:27:43,810
otherwise you have a corkscrew instead
of a pyramid. That's the, that's,

2476
02:27:43,811 --> 02:27:47,410
that's the, the, the whole problem.
No, it's a, it's an amazing device.

2477
02:27:47,411 --> 02:27:52,150
A multifunctional device in, in my view,
in, in coding and coding knowledge,

2478
02:27:52,360 --> 02:27:55,100
but also working on, on
human consciousness. I,

2479
02:27:55,101 --> 02:27:57,880
I've had the privilege to be
alone inside the great pyramid.

2480
02:27:58,210 --> 02:28:02,500
Not surrounded by hundreds of others.
And as the silence descends,

2481
02:28:03,070 --> 02:28:06,610
this sense of intelligence
seems to come out from the wall.

2482
02:28:06,611 --> 02:28:08,110
Something is speaking to you there.

2483
02:28:08,111 --> 02:28:12,100
And I think that partly what it was
designed to do was to affect human

2484
02:28:12,101 --> 02:28:14,470
consciousness. And in a
weird way, it's still doing.

2485
02:28:14,471 --> 02:28:17,470
So it's just getting
people majestic structure,

2486
02:28:17,471 --> 02:28:20,980
just being so magnificent and
incredible that you just go whoa.

2487
02:28:21,030 --> 02:28:22,670
And also the sensory deprivation

2488
02:28:22,670 --> 02:28:25,880
element, you know, you're, you're
inside the so called King's chamber,

2489
02:28:25,881 --> 02:28:30,530
which had nothing to do with any king.
This amazing granite geometrical room,

2490
02:28:30,540 --> 02:28:33,440
300 feet above the ground in
the heart of the great pyramid.

2491
02:28:33,830 --> 02:28:38,480
As that silence descends, you feel
this monument begin to speak to you.

2492
02:28:38,510 --> 02:28:43,190
It's almost like it's shy. Put 50 people
in there and the dialogue goes away,

2493
02:28:43,210 --> 02:28:47,660
be in there alone, listen to the silence
and it starts to speak. Wow. Wow,

2494
02:28:47,750 --> 02:28:49,340
that's amazing.
It's just,

2495
02:28:49,380 --> 02:28:52,930
it's such a special
thing that we have this,

2496
02:28:52,950 --> 02:28:56,600
this area where you can see
these ancient structures and,

2497
02:28:56,620 --> 02:29:00,470
and causes your mind to wander and
think about these things and these

2498
02:29:00,471 --> 02:29:01,310
possibilities.

2499
02:29:01,550 --> 02:29:05,090
And when you add that to
all the information that you
guys have accumulated over

2500
02:29:05,330 --> 02:29:08,630
the course of your study and your
research, it's just an amazing,

2501
02:29:08,631 --> 02:29:10,250
amazing thing to consider.

2502
02:29:10,280 --> 02:29:13,070
I should mention another site
which we've not talked about today,

2503
02:29:13,160 --> 02:29:17,000
which is good in Padang, in
Indonesia. Uh, and again,

2504
02:29:17,001 --> 02:29:20,910
I have a couple of chapters on this in
the, in the new book good in Padang, uh,

2505
02:29:20,930 --> 02:29:25,760
is a man they pyramid. Um,
and it's been found about 30,

2506
02:29:26,090 --> 02:29:31,010
uh, about three hours drive west of
Bandung on the island of Java. Uh,

2507
02:29:31,011 --> 02:29:35,030
and for a long time it was thought to
be a relatively young megalithic site.

2508
02:29:35,031 --> 02:29:38,960
There's a megalithic site on top of what
was thought to be a natural hill, uh,

2509
02:29:38,961 --> 02:29:43,250
but now, uh, an amazing Indonesia
and geologists called Danny Hilman,

2510
02:29:43,251 --> 02:29:46,220
Natalie Georgia, uh, has
been over it with his team.

2511
02:29:46,221 --> 02:29:50,060
They've done ground penetrating radar
and seismic tomography on the whole

2512
02:29:50,061 --> 02:29:54,500
structure and they've also put drill
cores down into it and they have pulled up

2513
02:29:54,860 --> 02:29:59,300
remnants of manmade material associated
with dateable organic material that goes

2514
02:29:59,301 --> 02:30:03,530
back 20,000 years.
It goes back right into the last ice age.

2515
02:30:03,531 --> 02:30:08,360
This is a 20,000 year old pyramid sitting
in Indonesia and it's one of the most

2516
02:30:08,361 --> 02:30:10,790
exciting breaking stories in archaeology.

2517
02:30:10,790 --> 02:30:15,790
And typically because the discovery
work has been done by a geologist,

2518
02:30:16,220 --> 02:30:19,700
Indonesian archaeologists are
wanting the whole work stopped.

2519
02:30:19,790 --> 02:30:24,250
So this is it right here. Ah, that's not
good and down. No, no. It says about the,

2520
02:30:24,251 --> 02:30:28,820
the, the, the, the, those are good and
put down, not the, so the, so for example,

2521
02:30:28,821 --> 02:30:33,470
third from the right third from the
left. I mean that one. Yeah, that's the,

2522
02:30:33,471 --> 02:30:37,130
that's the known megalithic site on
top of what is now understood to be a

2523
02:30:37,131 --> 02:30:39,110
completely manmade pyramid.
We're,

2524
02:30:39,111 --> 02:30:43,680
so this is accepted only by geologists,
not by archeologist.

2525
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:47,390
The archeologist say, oh, we know
that site. It's 2,500 years old.

2526
02:30:47,391 --> 02:30:48,500
There's nothing of interest there.

2527
02:30:48,501 --> 02:30:51,200
We would like the resources that are
being spent on this to be spent on our

2528
02:30:51,201 --> 02:30:52,400
projects instead.
And in fact,

2529
02:30:52,401 --> 02:30:55,280
they've lobbied with the Indonesian
government and the excavations have been

2530
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:59,990
temporarily halted. Uh, I think that it
will go ahead again. I think what it,

2531
02:30:59,991 --> 02:31:03,260
what is the evidence that shows where's
the geological evidence and shows that

2532
02:31:03,261 --> 02:31:06,350
this is first, first of all,
the ground penetrating radar.

2533
02:31:06,351 --> 02:31:10,520
That picture of what is inside this
shows us that it is a manmade hill,

2534
02:31:10,580 --> 02:31:13,490
not a natural hill.
Secondly,

2535
02:31:13,491 --> 02:31:17,000
that it contains three
large chambers within it.

2536
02:31:17,420 --> 02:31:21,090
One of them at least as large as the
king's chamber in the Great Pyramid,

2537
02:31:21,330 --> 02:31:26,230
huge cavities, regular in shape,
which have not yet been excavated. Um,

2538
02:31:26,310 --> 02:31:27,540
and,
and thirdly,

2539
02:31:27,750 --> 02:31:31,950
that the date of this site
puts us back to 20,000 years,

2540
02:31:31,951 --> 02:31:35,490
right to the last glacial maximum when
Indonesia didn't look at tall the way it

2541
02:31:35,491 --> 02:31:36,300
looks today.

2542
02:31:36,300 --> 02:31:40,710
Indonesia 20,000 years ago was part of
a giant continent that geologists called

2543
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:45,760
call a Sundar Sundar land, the Sunda
Shelf, uh, that it wasn't a peninsula,

2544
02:31:45,761 --> 02:31:48,570
the Malaysian peninsula and the
thousand islands of Indonesia.

2545
02:31:48,570 --> 02:31:53,570
It was a massive landmass and that land
mass was submerged predominantly between

2546
02:31:54,181 --> 02:31:56,430
twelve thousand eight hundred eleven
thousand six hundred years ago.

2547
02:31:56,460 --> 02:32:00,210
This site sits in an area of high land,

2548
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:03,860
which was never submerged.
And it looks to me, again,

2549
02:32:03,910 --> 02:32:06,390
I'm speculating because the
excavation has been stopped,

2550
02:32:06,391 --> 02:32:11,100
but it looks to me as does go directly
Tepi like it, like a time capsule.

2551
02:32:11,160 --> 02:32:14,510
Something that takes us back
to that earlier period. And,

2552
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:18,390
and in fact when we're looking
for a lost civilization,

2553
02:32:19,020 --> 02:32:20,730
I think we should be
looking all over the world.

2554
02:32:20,731 --> 02:32:24,720
Plato made it clear that Atlantis
wasn't just the island, it was a,

2555
02:32:24,721 --> 02:32:27,720
it had projected it's power
all around the world. Uh,

2556
02:32:27,780 --> 02:32:31,410
Indonesia is a very fruitful
area for further investigation.

2557
02:32:31,411 --> 02:32:35,280
And I did a huge research
trip in Indonesia and I
saw megaliths that had just

2558
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:37,590
unaccounted for.
The archeology has never been done.

2559
02:32:37,591 --> 02:32:42,180
There's a giant megalithic culture in
that, in that island. And it's very cool.

2560
02:32:42,300 --> 02:32:46,100
Some cultures on Indonesia are still
making megaliths today. They're,

2561
02:32:46,120 --> 02:32:49,080
they're still doing it. It, it
continues this ancient tradition.

2562
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:52,950
So when we're looking at this, what
are you, what are you guys saying?

2563
02:32:52,951 --> 02:32:55,640
I'm seeing a hill. I sing a
bunch of rocks. Yeah. Those.

2564
02:32:55,650 --> 02:32:58,440
That bunch of rocks is
the known Megalithic site,

2565
02:32:58,470 --> 02:33:01,830
which has correctly been
dated to 2,500 years ago.

2566
02:33:01,910 --> 02:33:06,550
It's what you say megalithic site.
This is a material called columnar battle,

2567
02:33:06,840 --> 02:33:09,330
which forms of forms naturally,
by the way,

2568
02:33:09,331 --> 02:33:11,910
into into regular patterns.

2569
02:33:12,090 --> 02:33:17,090
The giant's causeway in Ireland is a
columnar battled columnar basle when it,

2570
02:33:17,340 --> 02:33:20,850
it forms naturally forms
in vertical formations.

2571
02:33:21,270 --> 02:33:23,310
It's a very useful building material.

2572
02:33:23,311 --> 02:33:28,311
It can be broken up into blocks and when
you see them laid out horizontally like

2573
02:33:28,351 --> 02:33:28,591
this,

2574
02:33:28,591 --> 02:33:32,370
you know absolutely that human beings
have been involved and that they have made

2575
02:33:32,371 --> 02:33:32,850
this site.

2576
02:33:32,850 --> 02:33:36,750
But what's really interesting is what's
underneath what we're seeing there.

2577
02:33:36,751 --> 02:33:41,280
What's been revealed by the
ground penetrating radar
and the drill cores that is,

2578
02:33:41,310 --> 02:33:45,300
that is really fascinating because
that has not been taken into account by

2579
02:33:45,301 --> 02:33:48,450
archeology at all and that's
where we need to do this work.

2580
02:33:48,451 --> 02:33:50,100
If we're going to recover our lost pass,

2581
02:33:50,370 --> 02:33:52,860
Indonesia is one of the
places we need to be doing it.

2582
02:33:53,140 --> 02:33:54,810
Sort of someone like me
that's looking at this,

2583
02:33:54,811 --> 02:33:57,330
I'm just seeing a bunch of stones.
Yeah, that's what you're seeing.

2584
02:33:57,720 --> 02:34:00,120
So 2,500 year old site.

2585
02:34:00,180 --> 02:34:05,180
But what it appears to be the case that
that site was put there because there

2586
02:34:05,491 --> 02:34:10,470
was an ancient memory that this
was a sacred site. The word,

2587
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:15,500
the name Gunung Padang in the Indonesian
language doesn't seem to mean very

2588
02:34:15,511 --> 02:34:16,890
much.
It means mountain,

2589
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:19,870
but in the sooner knees language,

2590
02:34:19,871 --> 02:34:23,200
which is the language that is
spoken around Gunung Padang,

2591
02:34:23,470 --> 02:34:27,190
what Gunung Padang means is
mountain of enlightenment.

2592
02:34:27,880 --> 02:34:32,880
Whoa suggestion that it's connected
to an ancient system of knowledge.

2593
02:34:33,010 --> 02:34:37,210
It's one of many sites that are appearing
around the world now that don't fit

2594
02:34:37,510 --> 02:34:41,290
with the mainstream picture.
So this sort of parallel,

2595
02:34:41,291 --> 02:34:44,980
some of the ideas about the old kingdom
in Egypt and the ancient structures

2596
02:34:44,981 --> 02:34:48,220
where the new structures are built on
top of them and as they dig deeper into

2597
02:34:48,221 --> 02:34:52,700
the sand, they find different construction
methods that represent an older tire.

2598
02:34:52,701 --> 02:34:55,410
Exactly, exactly. This is that, that,

2599
02:34:55,480 --> 02:35:00,100
so this is 20,000 years old underneath
this. Yeah, that's right. Wow.

2600
02:35:00,130 --> 02:35:01,420
And what,
what can we,

2601
02:35:01,510 --> 02:35:04,090
is there any images that we could look
at or is there anything that we could see

2602
02:35:04,091 --> 02:35:06,860
other than this? Um, well
I have a lot in the book.

2603
02:35:06,860 --> 02:35:08,430
I know she went out the image above it.

2604
02:35:08,431 --> 02:35:13,270
That's an artist's rendition to look like
that's an absolute artist's rendition,

2605
02:35:13,271 --> 02:35:17,200
which I don't value. It's it, it, it, it
almost takes the form of misinformation.

2606
02:35:17,560 --> 02:35:21,430
We need to be looking at the real thing.
Berries at bet. Now there that painting,

2607
02:35:21,431 --> 02:35:24,190
you have your cursor just on it,
just Greg on that.

2608
02:35:24,430 --> 02:35:28,450
That is an artist's interpretation of
what Gunung Padang would have looked like

2609
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:31,990
in its original 20,000 years
ago before it became overgrown.

2610
02:35:32,570 --> 02:35:36,250
But that is the mind blower.
Then if this 20,000 years ago,

2611
02:35:36,251 --> 02:35:39,580
if this actually exists to this gigantic
megalithic structure that was created

2612
02:35:39,581 --> 02:35:40,510
by human beings,

2613
02:35:40,690 --> 02:35:44,620
advanced civilization beyond a
shadow of a doubt 20,000 years ago,

2614
02:35:45,140 --> 02:35:50,140
and it's a deal in an area that was
devastated by the global floods of 12,800

2615
02:35:50,381 --> 02:35:54,800
years ago and that became a completely
different from how it was before.

2616
02:35:54,850 --> 02:35:55,630
Before that.

2617
02:35:55,630 --> 02:36:00,630
What was the area that had that gigantic
super volcano detonation 70,000 years

2618
02:36:01,841 --> 02:36:06,670
ago, but that's another Indonesian store
and that is Indonesia and that that is

2619
02:36:06,700 --> 02:36:07,810
literally where

2620
02:36:09,310 --> 02:36:13,360
a massive amount of the population of
the earth of human beings was wiped out.

2621
02:36:13,361 --> 02:36:17,890
May of 70 the human population went
down to just 2000 individual cheese.

2622
02:36:18,790 --> 02:36:20,440
That's like a good comedy show for me.

2623
02:36:20,470 --> 02:36:25,470
Like a theater can imagine that everyone
in my show repopulate the fucking

2624
02:36:27,311 --> 02:36:30,310
earth.
Sometimes our species hangs by a thread.

2625
02:36:31,300 --> 02:36:33,890
Sometimes we hang by a thread
that that was one of those times.

2626
02:36:33,891 --> 02:36:35,920
See that is crazy.

2627
02:36:36,100 --> 02:36:41,100
The idea that just the earth can have a
hiccup and that's not even an asteroid.

2628
02:36:41,650 --> 02:36:44,530
That's the earth itself.
That's up. Belching.

2629
02:36:44,890 --> 02:36:49,450
Belches destroys the environment to
the point where it creates nuclear.

2630
02:36:49,451 --> 02:36:50,740
Winter kills all the crops.

2631
02:36:50,741 --> 02:36:55,210
Most of the animals die and 2000
people scratch and claw their way,

2632
02:36:55,211 --> 02:36:58,810
the existence. Wow. And
only 70,000 years ago,

2633
02:36:58,811 --> 02:37:00,670
so 50,000 years before this,

2634
02:37:01,060 --> 02:37:04,790
so 50,000 so there's been
a series of these. Yes,

2635
02:37:04,910 --> 02:37:09,080
there've been a series of these and we
as a species of kind of dawn [inaudible]

2636
02:37:09,090 --> 02:37:13,210
in and out of them and from time to time
they have radically changed our story,

2637
02:37:13,450 --> 02:37:15,950
our Hubris in creating drives,

2638
02:37:16,400 --> 02:37:20,780
hard drives and flash drives and
computers and phones and no one remembers

2639
02:37:20,781 --> 02:37:25,130
anything. I can, I maybe know
for phone numbers, you know,

2640
02:37:25,520 --> 02:37:25,940
we don't,

2641
02:37:25,940 --> 02:37:29,920
we don't use the power of memory anymore
and we don't write anything down and,

2642
02:37:29,921 --> 02:37:34,490
and anything that's going to survive
any sort of a disaster. Yeah, yeah,

2643
02:37:34,790 --> 02:37:35,623
absolutely.

2644
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:40,400
That's where the systems
like free masonry command,

2645
02:37:41,210 --> 02:37:46,100
because here you have a body of symbolism
that's been handed down at least since

2646
02:37:46,101 --> 02:37:50,420
the Middle Ages. And you
have a lot of, you know,

2647
02:37:50,421 --> 02:37:55,421
currently active masons who in order to
become master masons have to memorize a

2648
02:37:56,391 --> 02:37:58,280
tremendous amount of information.

2649
02:37:59,090 --> 02:38:02,120
Most of them don't have a clue
as to what it means though,

2650
02:38:02,420 --> 02:38:05,450
even though they're told right into
ritual. If you want to understand this,

2651
02:38:05,810 --> 02:38:08,390
you have to understand astronomy.
First of all,

2652
02:38:08,450 --> 02:38:12,650
you have to understand geometry and
a number of other things. But, um,

2653
02:38:13,070 --> 02:38:15,920
a tremendous amount of,
of memory work is involved.

2654
02:38:16,220 --> 02:38:18,050
And this is the ancient system,

2655
02:38:18,051 --> 02:38:23,051
the oral traditions involved
memory on a massive scale,

2656
02:38:24,200 --> 02:38:28,940
being able to recite verbatim things
that might take you hours to recite.

2657
02:38:29,450 --> 02:38:34,070
And we, like you guys have just
discussed, we were losing that ability.

2658
02:38:34,610 --> 02:38:36,770
And, and this is, you know, to me it's,

2659
02:38:36,771 --> 02:38:41,450
it's regrettable that freemasonry has
gotten such a bad rep with all of these

2660
02:38:41,451 --> 02:38:45,200
silly conspiratorial things in the last,
in the age of the Internet.

2661
02:38:45,260 --> 02:38:48,980
I got to tell you how many times on
Facebook or the Internet, somebody,

2662
02:38:49,070 --> 02:38:53,300
and they expressed it as, as
an accusation. Yeah. Graham
Hancock is a Freemason.

2663
02:38:53,690 --> 02:38:55,880
Well, first off, I'm not a free mason.

2664
02:38:56,270 --> 02:38:59,780
I've never been a free mason and I never
will be a free mason because I'm not a

2665
02:38:59,781 --> 02:39:03,830
joiner. I don't join clubs. My, my
job is to write books. And if I,

2666
02:39:04,010 --> 02:39:08,180
if I join a particular club that's going
to compromise my ability to do that.

2667
02:39:08,181 --> 02:39:10,030
I have given lectures in masonic lodges.

2668
02:39:10,040 --> 02:39:12,290
I've been invited to give
lectures there. And I, I'm,

2669
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:16,370
I'm very interested to talk to
Mason's, but, uh, you know, I'm not,

2670
02:39:16,430 --> 02:39:17,450
I'm not amazing myself.

2671
02:39:17,451 --> 02:39:20,240
And it is strange that there is
this idea that free masonry is,

2672
02:39:20,510 --> 02:39:23,300
is connected to some kind
of global conspiracy.

2673
02:39:23,301 --> 02:39:26,900
I think it's much more complicated and
much more interesting than that. Well,

2674
02:39:26,901 --> 02:39:29,990
it's a, an ancient, like, as you said,

2675
02:39:29,991 --> 02:39:34,991
and an ancient way of sort of storing
and passing down knowledge and ideas.

2676
02:39:35,570 --> 02:39:38,120
I mean, I'm sure there's a bunch of
wacky people that are involved in it too.

2677
02:39:38,121 --> 02:39:40,700
Most of them are in it for them.
Frank Beer,

2678
02:39:41,320 --> 02:39:43,880
not freemasonry is
largely a male drinking.

2679
02:39:43,881 --> 02:39:48,110
Maybe I'm in then maybe I need to
find these people. Well, actually,

2680
02:39:48,111 --> 02:39:52,340
maybe that's in the UK. In the US,
there's no drinking in the lodge.

2681
02:39:53,060 --> 02:39:56,760
The lodge is not even the lodge itself,
but, but afterwards, okay, I'm out.

2682
02:39:56,761 --> 02:39:59,600
It was a lot of alcohol goes
down. I was in, I'm now I'm out.

2683
02:40:01,880 --> 02:40:04,130
Well, yeah, drinking does
mess with your memory though.

2684
02:40:04,131 --> 02:40:08,630
So I see that there is a tremendous
body of symbolism in there,

2685
02:40:08,660 --> 02:40:13,160
which I think is critical to understanding
a lot of these ancient mysteries.

2686
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:16,290
How's ancient origins? One of the things
that's so confusing about our money,

2687
02:40:16,291 --> 02:40:18,880
right? And so conspiratorially, uh,

2688
02:40:19,810 --> 02:40:24,030
constantly debated about the origins of
the symbolism on our money. You know,

2689
02:40:24,031 --> 02:40:25,890
the pyramid with the
eye ball on top of it.

2690
02:40:25,891 --> 02:40:29,520
And there's so many theories as to
what this means and that means, and Oh,

2691
02:40:29,521 --> 02:40:33,420
look at the way they structured
from Washington DC and
where the Pentagon is and

2692
02:40:33,421 --> 02:40:37,410
where all these different buildings are
all zoll mason stuff and they want to

2693
02:40:37,411 --> 02:40:40,260
take over the world. And Yeah, I dunno,

2694
02:40:40,530 --> 02:40:42,530
but it's a who knows really basket.

2695
02:40:42,540 --> 02:40:46,290
I think what's important about it is that
it's a system of ideas that definitely

2696
02:40:46,291 --> 02:40:50,370
has very ancient origins, which we're
seeing a modern manifestation of it now.

2697
02:40:50,370 --> 02:40:53,370
But it tracks back a
long way into the past.

2698
02:40:53,371 --> 02:40:58,371
And this shows that the ideas
can be passed down below
the radar and can survive

2699
02:40:58,801 --> 02:41:02,700
and can continue. Well the, the
eyeball on top of the pyramid, man,

2700
02:41:02,701 --> 02:41:05,550
I would love to go back to the dude
who created the dollar bill and go,

2701
02:41:05,551 --> 02:41:07,050
what are you doing?
And what the fuck is that?

2702
02:41:08,790 --> 02:41:13,740
How come you just don't say $1 and have
the have the dude's face and we're good.

2703
02:41:13,741 --> 02:41:16,230
Right? Why do you have to have a
pyramid with an eye ball? Yeah.

2704
02:41:16,240 --> 02:41:19,380
Like what does that mean?
What a wonder what it meant to them?

2705
02:41:19,381 --> 02:41:20,560
What is it supposed to symbolize?

2706
02:41:20,630 --> 02:41:23,070
I think it means the same thing
to admit to the ancient Egyptians.

2707
02:41:23,071 --> 02:41:27,100
We find the eye of Horus
Egyptian.

2708
02:41:27,740 --> 02:41:31,850
Doesn't the eye of Horus
represent the pineal gland?
That's a good argument. Yeah.

2709
02:41:31,860 --> 02:41:35,080
It actually looks like the
pineal gland from a side profile.

2710
02:41:35,080 --> 02:41:38,040
It looks exactly like it
looks like it. And, and um,

2711
02:41:38,070 --> 02:41:41,280
we know that a DMT was
available in nature in Egypt,

2712
02:41:41,690 --> 02:41:44,940
but the ancient Egyptian tree
of life is occasionally Latika,

2713
02:41:45,420 --> 02:41:48,610
which is rich in DMT in
its, in its box. Well,

2714
02:41:48,611 --> 02:41:53,340
that's also the tree that
they're considering the the
modern Jerusalem scholars

2715
02:41:53,341 --> 02:41:55,950
have attached to Moses
and the burning Bush,

2716
02:41:56,460 --> 02:42:00,330
the burning Bush being the source of
divinity or the source of, of God,

2717
02:42:00,331 --> 02:42:01,830
of divine knowledge,

2718
02:42:01,860 --> 02:42:05,280
God being a burning Bush and
that Bush being the Acacia tree,

2719
02:42:05,640 --> 02:42:07,620
Acacia tree being rich and DMT.
I mean,

2720
02:42:07,621 --> 02:42:11,230
it only makes sense if you try to break
it down and translate it, if that,

2721
02:42:11,430 --> 02:42:16,430
if anybody who's done DMT knows what a
profound and life changing experience it

2722
02:42:16,771 --> 02:42:19,530
can be and how there is
this feeling when you do it,

2723
02:42:19,531 --> 02:42:23,090
that you are connecting to some
sort of divine entity. Well,

2724
02:42:23,670 --> 02:42:27,300
we have to look at this image. Okay,
should I go you at Jamie, put it up there.

2725
02:42:27,301 --> 02:42:28,220
Well,
it's a typical,

2726
02:42:28,250 --> 02:42:32,760
you find this in all kinds of masonic
that's spooky to do and given a a haircut.

2727
02:42:33,510 --> 02:42:34,660
Well,
he's going to wanes.

2728
02:42:35,040 --> 02:42:40,040
You see what you have
here is a juxtaposition of
different symbols and they all

2729
02:42:40,471 --> 02:42:44,520
have an interpretation. Bright.
You see the old man father time,

2730
02:42:44,820 --> 02:42:48,780
but he holds the sick father.
Time also has wings. Two wings,

2731
02:42:48,810 --> 02:42:53,580
wings well applies.
What time flies. Flies.

2732
02:42:53,820 --> 02:42:55,650
Well, I dare you. You notice

2733
02:42:57,990 --> 02:43:00,510
notice the Hourglass, right? Okay.

2734
02:43:00,511 --> 02:43:04,920
The hourglass by the cycle and the
cycle is a symbol for the comment.

2735
02:43:05,160 --> 02:43:07,650
I'm going to go ahead and
a calmness bill some. Yes,

2736
02:43:08,100 --> 02:43:12,290
I can show you how that works.
You know the word comment

2737
02:43:12,340 --> 02:43:15,640
comes from the Latin Cometa or
come eat done, which means what

2738
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:20,190
long hair, right? Oh Randal.

2739
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:23,950
Long hair had star actually
looks a bit like a company.

2740
02:43:25,540 --> 02:43:28,990
So as you're looking at the star in
the sky and you see the tail, they,

2741
02:43:28,991 --> 02:43:32,110
they think of that as the
hair of the con. Yes, exactly.

2742
02:43:32,111 --> 02:43:36,880
So what you have there is the long hair
right there. That's a signal right there.

2743
02:43:36,881 --> 02:43:40,090
That as a reference, and I can show
you a couple of other things to show.

2744
02:43:40,091 --> 02:43:42,760
The time was going bald.
What's all that about? Yeah.

2745
02:43:43,080 --> 02:43:47,890
Well he's making up for it
was the whiskers. Yeah. Um,

2746
02:43:48,340 --> 02:43:50,380
but you'll notice what she
holds in her right hand,

2747
02:43:51,010 --> 02:43:55,850
the sprig of Acacia once you hold it.
And so in,

2748
02:43:55,860 --> 02:43:59,800
in the masonic symbolism,
Acacia represents resurrection.

2749
02:43:59,801 --> 02:44:02,200
Rec represents restoration.

2750
02:44:02,230 --> 02:44:06,120
After in the masonic allegory,
you have the,

2751
02:44:06,400 --> 02:44:10,030
the death of the master builder and
the raising of the master builder.

2752
02:44:10,390 --> 02:44:13,000
And the symbolism for this,
whether it ultimately,

2753
02:44:13,001 --> 02:44:16,330
I think goes back to the death and
resurrection of a Cyrus and the death and

2754
02:44:16,331 --> 02:44:19,480
resurrection of all of these
God figures in history,

2755
02:44:19,750 --> 02:44:23,380
which could be taking in resurrecting
gods, the diamond, the resurrecting gods,

2756
02:44:23,381 --> 02:44:28,120
which could be taken as a metaphor really
for the god standing in for the human

2757
02:44:28,121 --> 02:44:32,170
species for human civilization.
And she's, she's actually weeping.

2758
02:44:32,200 --> 02:44:35,470
She's holding in her
left hand a Cyborg IOM,

2759
02:44:35,740 --> 02:44:39,250
which was a symbol from
alchemy in the Masonic Sansi.

2760
02:44:39,251 --> 02:44:42,790
It's in that container that she's
holding that the alchemy takes place,

2761
02:44:43,060 --> 02:44:48,060
which you might speculate is maybe the
extraction of the DMT from the occasions.

2762
02:44:49,580 --> 02:44:53,410
What I was gonna say, it looks almost like
one of those incents holders. You know,

2763
02:44:53,411 --> 02:44:56,650
you put the, you get an incense cone,
you put it in, you put the lid on that,

2764
02:44:56,651 --> 02:44:58,090
and the incense comes through that,
right.

2765
02:44:58,900 --> 02:45:01,630
And she's looking at a book and
she's looking at a book, right?

2766
02:45:01,660 --> 02:45:06,220
And then the book is sitting on a
broken column, the broken column.

2767
02:45:06,850 --> 02:45:11,680
Uh, actually that what that represents
is very well depicted in this next image

2768
02:45:11,681 --> 02:45:15,160
here,
which was basically the loss,

2769
02:45:15,280 --> 02:45:18,400
the destruction of the lost civilization.
And that's what she's weeping overseas.

2770
02:45:18,600 --> 02:45:22,780
She's holding the occasion because
that's the symbol of Resurrection, right?

2771
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:26,260
How civilization is then renewed Phoenix,

2772
02:45:26,261 --> 02:45:29,770
like out of the ashes of the
previous one out of drugs.

2773
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:35,620
Maybe assistant maybe with some
assistance will help. Yeah. So,

2774
02:45:35,621 --> 02:45:38,950
so you see there and then you and you
go back to this, see, it's all there.

2775
02:45:38,951 --> 02:45:42,070
And once you begin to understand
that the symbolism of this,

2776
02:45:42,071 --> 02:45:44,920
you can begin to read it just like a,

2777
02:45:45,070 --> 02:45:47,590
a book or a manuscript almost.
You see?

2778
02:45:48,130 --> 02:45:52,050
And there we see it a 19th
century depiction of, you know,

2779
02:45:52,240 --> 02:45:56,050
the destruction of civilization
by coming by a comment.

2780
02:45:57,390 --> 02:46:00,920
Yes. And absolutely
fascinating. Yeah. Yeah.

2781
02:46:01,270 --> 02:46:05,860
It's interesting stuff. Um, boy,
there's a lot of work in that,

2782
02:46:06,040 --> 02:46:08,950
you know,
is this a universal description,

2783
02:46:08,960 --> 02:46:11,680
like the way or interpretation
of what you're saying is,

2784
02:46:11,740 --> 02:46:14,210
has everyone agree on
that? No. No, no. In fact,

2785
02:46:15,170 --> 02:46:18,590
basically most of more look at it and
really not really understand the law.

2786
02:46:18,591 --> 02:46:20,650
That's pretty what in
many different cultures,

2787
02:46:20,680 --> 02:46:23,610
a calm it is the long haired
Star it looks like on Saturday.

2788
02:46:23,770 --> 02:46:25,850
And sometimes it's the cosmic serpent,

2789
02:46:25,940 --> 02:46:28,370
sometimes it's a sip and
sometimes it's a serpent. Yeah,

2790
02:46:28,580 --> 02:46:31,850
it looks like an old dude that's creeping
on. A young girl was trying to read

2791
02:46:34,230 --> 02:46:35,840
like, you know, she's trying to read,

2792
02:46:35,841 --> 02:46:38,800
he's trying to give her a back massage
and just trying to be kind of being

2793
02:46:38,810 --> 02:46:43,700
creepy, but it looks like
[inaudible]. Good. Well here we have,

2794
02:46:43,820 --> 02:46:46,130
this is a 19th century masonic carpet.

2795
02:46:46,760 --> 02:46:51,500
Now you'll notice several things on here.
What do you see up on the right?

2796
02:46:51,860 --> 02:46:53,560
A comment. A comment, yes.

2797
02:46:53,870 --> 02:46:57,410
And immediately to the left of the comic
you have a Lunar Crescent and then you

2798
02:46:57,411 --> 02:47:02,210
have the seven stars. And what does the
seven stars usually depict? The Pleiades?

2799
02:47:02,260 --> 02:47:05,840
Yeah, part of the Taurus
constellation. Exactly. Yeah.

2800
02:47:06,020 --> 02:47:10,610
And if you superimpose the radiant of the
Taurid meteor shower almost bolts eyes

2801
02:47:10,611 --> 02:47:12,890
right on the right on the Pleiades,

2802
02:47:12,920 --> 02:47:17,090
and you find the Pleiades playing an
important part in not only the masonic

2803
02:47:17,091 --> 02:47:19,190
ritual,
but in many traditions,

2804
02:47:20,140 --> 02:47:24,940
additions there even clearly depicted in
the hall of bulls in Lascaux in France

2805
02:47:24,941 --> 02:47:28,800
17,000 years ago at depiction of the
constellation of tourists with the plate,

2806
02:47:28,840 --> 02:47:31,300
he's clearly marked on the
shoulder of the, of the bull.

2807
02:47:31,301 --> 02:47:34,300
So anybody who argues that there was
no ancient knowledge of the Zodiacal

2808
02:47:34,301 --> 02:47:38,050
constellations, go to Lascaux
and you'll realize there was.

2809
02:47:38,530 --> 02:47:41,560
Wow. And you'll notice
down here there's the arc,

2810
02:47:41,920 --> 02:47:44,380
which of course is
symbolizing the great flood.

2811
02:47:45,010 --> 02:47:47,710
And you've got a lot of
things going on here.

2812
02:47:47,711 --> 02:47:50,590
You've got the coffin with the
occasion growing out of it,

2813
02:47:51,220 --> 02:47:54,460
which again is symbolizing this
resurrection after the death.

2814
02:47:54,490 --> 02:47:57,800
So that one plant plays an important
role over and over and over.

2815
02:47:57,801 --> 02:47:58,840
Those are very important role.

2816
02:47:59,180 --> 02:48:01,510
It doesn't mean it can't be
coincidental that the road, that day

2817
02:48:01,700 --> 02:48:06,700
planning human culture has been radically
underestimated and misunderstood by,

2818
02:48:06,770 --> 02:48:08,290
by, uh, our scholars.

2819
02:48:08,440 --> 02:48:13,270
Is there any depictions in the
ancient world of utilization, of DMT,

2820
02:48:13,271 --> 02:48:16,800
of smoking, it, of,
there's many depictions of,

2821
02:48:16,801 --> 02:48:21,310
of the ancient Egyptian and ancient
Egyptian figure holding some kind of pipe.

2822
02:48:21,340 --> 02:48:26,060
Uh, and now that we know that occasionally
Latika is a DMT rich tree and that the

2823
02:48:26,061 --> 02:48:29,890
ancient Egyptians certainly had the
chemical knowledge to extract the DMT from

2824
02:48:29,891 --> 02:48:34,330
that bark. The very word
chemistry actually comes from
the name of ancient Egypt,

2825
02:48:34,750 --> 02:48:38,920
which was Kemet the black land. That's
where we get the word chemistry from.

2826
02:48:39,100 --> 02:48:41,840
We can be pretty sure what
they were smoking. Um,

2827
02:48:41,860 --> 02:48:46,390
there is a particular scene by the way,
where we see another visionary, um, agent.

2828
02:48:46,420 --> 02:48:48,540
The datura plant,
um,

2829
02:48:48,850 --> 02:48:53,620
raise in the form of Datura flowers
are descending into the brow,

2830
02:48:53,621 --> 02:48:57,820
into the third eye of the
initiative in, in, in that image.

2831
02:48:58,210 --> 02:48:59,500
The imagery is all there.

2832
02:48:59,530 --> 02:49:02,060
You just have to dig it out
and look for it and find it,

2833
02:49:02,070 --> 02:49:05,140
look for it with eyes that are willing
to see. That's the crucial thing.

2834
02:49:05,170 --> 02:49:10,110
I've never seen the, uh, hieroglyphs
of them holding a pipe. Oh yeah.

2835
02:49:10,160 --> 02:49:12,640
There's, there's maybe a funny
Jeremy, do you see any? Yeah.

2836
02:49:15,210 --> 02:49:17,880
Wow. So what are we looking
at here, Randall? Oh,

2837
02:49:17,881 --> 02:49:21,630
just another version of
these old masonic carpets,

2838
02:49:21,631 --> 02:49:23,970
but the thing that you'd
want to look at here,

2839
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:27,780
what the beehive thing in the
lower left hand corner there. Yeah.

2840
02:49:27,870 --> 02:49:30,500
That seems to be over and over again.
You see over and over again. Yeah.

2841
02:49:30,750 --> 02:49:35,130
Why a beehive? Is it a beehive?
Beehive? Yeah, it is. So it does it.

2842
02:49:35,131 --> 02:49:40,131
Is it supposed to represent
like beekeeping and is a
form of I will agriculture

2843
02:49:40,651 --> 02:49:42,210
or I'll fill you in on that someday.

2844
02:49:42,230 --> 02:49:44,310
These were a symbol of
royalty in ancient Egypt.

2845
02:49:44,750 --> 02:49:47,130
You find them all over the
temple of conic for example,

2846
02:49:47,320 --> 02:49:48,660
one of the masonic context.

2847
02:49:48,661 --> 02:49:53,550
It has a very interesting connotation
which would be probably beyond what we

2848
02:49:53,551 --> 02:49:56,850
could get into another show.
It's another whole nother show on bees.

2849
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:03,330
Does it? I mean what, what
I mean when you look at,

2850
02:50:03,660 --> 02:50:07,230
well it's one of the main concerns that
we have today is that our cell phone

2851
02:50:07,231 --> 02:50:12,231
signals and a lot of the pesticides
that we're using are killing off bees.

2852
02:50:12,450 --> 02:50:12,840
Okay.

2853
02:50:12,840 --> 02:50:16,500
The cell phone signals are apparently
like really confusing bees and messing

2854
02:50:16,501 --> 02:50:18,570
them up and the Wifi and all the waves,

2855
02:50:18,720 --> 02:50:21,180
radio waves and different things in
the atmosphere interfere with their

2856
02:50:21,181 --> 02:50:25,170
communication. But then on top of that,
the pesticides we're putting on crops,

2857
02:50:25,590 --> 02:50:27,920
all these, and then there's
diseases that bees are getting.

2858
02:50:27,940 --> 02:50:31,820
And we have a serious problem with
the honeybee population. I know.

2859
02:50:31,860 --> 02:50:35,820
And to have that as a big
part of their culture,

2860
02:50:35,821 --> 02:50:39,030
to have bees is a big part of their
culture, says something. Yeah.

2861
02:50:40,220 --> 02:50:44,730
You know what your superficially told
in the masonic ritual is that bees are a

2862
02:50:44,731 --> 02:50:47,730
symbol of industry,
but when you're being in to look into it,

2863
02:50:47,731 --> 02:50:51,120
the beehive itself is interesting
architecturally. Right? You know,

2864
02:50:51,121 --> 02:50:51,901
because what it does,

2865
02:50:51,901 --> 02:50:56,901
it has the maximum volume to weight
ratio virtually have any structure,

2866
02:50:58,020 --> 02:51:02,280
but there's other considerations there as
well, which again is a, is another show.

2867
02:51:02,281 --> 02:51:05,520
But if you look carefully
right up in here,

2868
02:51:05,940 --> 02:51:09,810
you'll notice there's a
twin comet twin stars.

2869
02:51:09,811 --> 02:51:13,790
You see the tails and you'll notice
that you, you know, that comets,

2870
02:51:13,830 --> 02:51:16,920
their tails are always
pointing away from the sun.

2871
02:51:17,130 --> 02:51:20,670
They're not like trails behind
like the wake of a boat.

2872
02:51:21,560 --> 02:51:25,350
They're pointing away from the sun.
You see? And if you look at this,

2873
02:51:25,351 --> 02:51:29,820
you see you've got the sun right here
and you've got these moving away.

2874
02:51:30,060 --> 02:51:32,640
The heart is a symbol for the earth.

2875
02:51:33,330 --> 02:51:36,330
The sword is another symbol
for the comment. Okay.

2876
02:51:38,300 --> 02:51:43,280
So all of us, wow. All of this mystery,
uh, s, uh, surrounds us and, and,

2877
02:51:43,281 --> 02:51:43,581
and,

2878
02:51:43,581 --> 02:51:48,581
and all of it takes us back to a time
that we've forgotten and we need to know

2879
02:51:49,850 --> 02:51:53,990
about that time. We need to, we need
to recover our memory. The, the, the,

2880
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:57,710
the human species is in a kind
of broken state right now. Uh,

2881
02:51:57,770 --> 02:52:00,160
psychologically you can see
it in the world. There's a,

2882
02:52:00,450 --> 02:52:05,120
there's this miasma of hatred and fear
and suspicion that are just enveloping

2883
02:52:05,140 --> 02:52:05,973
the whole world.

2884
02:52:06,310 --> 02:52:09,130
And we are being divided artificially
from one another when Trudy,

2885
02:52:09,131 --> 02:52:11,170
we are all brothers and sisters.

2886
02:52:11,470 --> 02:52:16,470
And we need to recover that knowledge
if we're to move forward to the future.

2887
02:52:17,080 --> 02:52:20,460
And on that note, I also want to
thank you for another thing, Joe,

2888
02:52:20,800 --> 02:52:22,460
which is for smoking me up last

2889
02:52:24,880 --> 02:52:26,320
re-introducing marijuana.

2890
02:52:26,770 --> 02:52:31,510
I had three years of abstinence from
marijuana and that abstinence ended,

2891
02:52:31,790 --> 02:52:36,280
uh, when we sat down for our
last chat, September, 2014.

2892
02:52:36,310 --> 02:52:39,640
Well you seem so healthy. I'm like,
I don't think pods the problem. No,

2893
02:52:39,641 --> 02:52:40,770
it's not the problem.
I am.

2894
02:52:40,840 --> 02:52:44,080
What's happened is I've completely changed
my relationship to that beautiful and

2895
02:52:44,081 --> 02:52:47,680
magical herb.
It's not a dependent relationship anymore.

2896
02:52:47,700 --> 02:52:51,700
It's not an obsessional relationship. If
I have it, I enjoy it. If I don't have it,

2897
02:52:51,730 --> 02:52:53,780
I enjoy my life anyway.
That's beautiful. Yeah.

2898
02:52:53,950 --> 02:52:57,040
I have a friend who was a drug counselor
and last time he was telling me his

2899
02:52:57,041 --> 02:53:00,520
story is also a comedian. And last time
he was telling me a story court court,

2900
02:53:00,530 --> 02:53:04,840
McGowan great guy. And he was telling
me a story about this kid that is a,

2901
02:53:04,970 --> 02:53:07,210
that he's trying to
help that what he said.

2902
02:53:07,211 --> 02:53:10,960
I had never met a marijuana
addict for and uh,

2903
02:53:10,990 --> 02:53:13,060
he met this kid and this kid
was smoking just massive,

2904
02:53:13,061 --> 02:53:14,470
massive amounts of marijuana.

2905
02:53:14,471 --> 02:53:18,360
He's trying to help him in his clinic
and he realized along the way, it's not,

2906
02:53:18,370 --> 02:53:20,020
it has nothing to do with the marijuana.

2907
02:53:20,210 --> 02:53:25,210
Like he's got some crazy psychological
issue that's going on and the marijuana

2908
02:53:25,811 --> 02:53:29,740
just happens to be the thing he's using
to try to fill up to medicate that.

2909
02:53:29,741 --> 02:53:34,150
It's not that he has this physical
addiction that's impossible to,

2910
02:53:34,180 --> 02:53:37,180
there is no physical addiction.
If the marijuana wasn't there,

2911
02:53:37,181 --> 02:53:39,460
he'd find something else.
Yes, that's what it is.

2912
02:53:39,461 --> 02:53:41,200
And then when he dug deep into it,

2913
02:53:41,201 --> 02:53:45,250
this poor kid has just a devastating
childhood and there's all sorts of issues.

2914
02:53:45,250 --> 02:53:48,150
Psychological, it was the case
with addiction. It's the, it's,

2915
02:53:48,151 --> 02:53:52,390
it's the pain in the individual that's
the source of it, not the substance.

2916
02:53:52,480 --> 02:53:56,350
That's, I think we can all relate
to a certain amount of madness.

2917
02:53:56,351 --> 02:54:00,430
And I know I certainly can because I think
we all capable of going down. You Bet.

2918
02:54:00,431 --> 02:54:04,990
Spirals and pass and then you know that
the concept of hitting rock bottom,

2919
02:54:04,991 --> 02:54:08,890
like sometimes you have to like hit
something where you can't continue your

2920
02:54:08,891 --> 02:54:12,250
momentum and you must regroup.
And in that regrouping,

2921
02:54:12,251 --> 02:54:16,390
you reassess or reevaluate and it's one
of the reasons why I'm so addicted to

2922
02:54:16,391 --> 02:54:21,280
sensory deprivation tanks because
that's my regrouping. It's an amazing,

2923
02:54:21,310 --> 02:54:24,910
it's an amazing place to regroup and thank
you for introducing me to that. Uh, as,

2924
02:54:24,911 --> 02:54:26,050
as,
as as well.

2925
02:54:26,080 --> 02:54:30,160
I am so grateful that there's people
out there that have continued that

2926
02:54:30,161 --> 02:54:34,360
tradition of building those things from
the Samadhi tanks from the early sixties,

2927
02:54:34,570 --> 02:54:37,970
from John Lilly to today crashed
and the float lab and, and,

2928
02:54:38,220 --> 02:54:40,090
and the zero gravity in Austin.
I mean,

2929
02:54:40,091 --> 02:54:44,550
they've done some amazing work and making
sure these things are like uptodate

2930
02:54:44,560 --> 02:54:45,760
and the most,
uh,

2931
02:54:45,790 --> 02:54:50,080
the most modern technology as far as
filtration systems and installation.

2932
02:54:50,081 --> 02:54:54,450
And now they're magical. I mean,
absolutely. You went to crash, right?

2933
02:54:56,620 --> 02:54:59,080
Plastic, fantastic
experience. I have to say,

2934
02:54:59,081 --> 02:55:02,470
I'm really thinking about putting one of
those in my house. It, everybody should.

2935
02:55:02,910 --> 02:55:04,100
I mean, God, man, you

2936
02:55:04,100 --> 02:55:08,030
know, that's the way to it. That's
the way it is, the way to it.

2937
02:55:08,031 --> 02:55:13,031
And to enjoy the experience to the maximum
to get the maximum benefit out of the

2938
02:55:13,300 --> 02:55:17,960
experience and intensely
intensely psychedelic without
adult edibles. Exactly.

2939
02:55:18,050 --> 02:55:20,630
I'm, I'm really encouraged by
what's happening in America,

2940
02:55:20,631 --> 02:55:22,760
that we are seeing the
legalization of cannabis,

2941
02:55:22,780 --> 02:55:27,780
that the American people state by state
are just putting their finger up to this

2942
02:55:28,340 --> 02:55:30,710
federal authority and
saying we are adults.

2943
02:55:30,740 --> 02:55:34,340
We have a right to decide what we
do with our own bodies and our own

2944
02:55:34,341 --> 02:55:36,800
consciousness.
And there is that air of freedom now in,

2945
02:55:36,801 --> 02:55:41,060
in Washington state and
Oregon up there in Alaska,

2946
02:55:41,420 --> 02:55:43,340
Colorado. And, and that's,

2947
02:55:43,341 --> 02:55:47,390
so this is part of my book tour that
I'm really looking forward to when I go

2948
02:55:47,391 --> 02:55:50,990
present an event in Seattle, which I'll
do in early December and in Portland,

2949
02:55:50,991 --> 02:55:55,610
Oregon and in Denver and in boulder.
I'm a Denver Saturday night.

2950
02:55:55,680 --> 02:55:58,520
I couldn't be more excited to get there.
I was so pumped.

2951
02:55:58,521 --> 02:56:00,200
I can't wait to get there.
And it's a great place.

2952
02:56:00,230 --> 02:56:04,400
It's a point of freedom and it's also
a point of prosperity. Yes. Denver has,

2953
02:56:04,680 --> 02:56:07,700
they have exceeded their,
their what?

2954
02:56:07,701 --> 02:56:11,380
They had it in terms of like their
expectations for how much money they were

2955
02:56:11,381 --> 02:56:13,400
going to make out of this
in terms of tax revenue.

2956
02:56:13,520 --> 02:56:16,940
It's gone through the roof is the first
time ever they make more money from

2957
02:56:16,941 --> 02:56:21,530
taxes and marijuana. Then alcohol
exact, which is fucking crazy.

2958
02:56:21,531 --> 02:56:24,350
You go around Colorado,
you see how many bars there are,

2959
02:56:24,530 --> 02:56:27,050
how many liquor stores and the
restaurants are serving booze.

2960
02:56:27,200 --> 02:56:30,080
They make more money in taxes from
marijuana. They do from all of that,

2961
02:56:30,110 --> 02:56:33,420
let's face it, Mary one is a far
superior substance to our call.

2962
02:56:33,680 --> 02:56:35,690
I'll call the horrible place.
It's not hurting.

2963
02:56:35,691 --> 02:56:38,750
The booze is not heading the boost
business. Yeah, violent crime is down.

2964
02:56:38,870 --> 02:56:41,680
Drunk driving is the lowest level.
It's been a decade.

2965
02:56:41,970 --> 02:56:46,290
I mean the whole thing is inquisitive,
very positive story real has coming up.

2966
02:56:46,730 --> 02:56:51,730
Colorado is proving to the world is that
the emperor of the war on drugs wears

2967
02:56:52,281 --> 02:56:55,370
no clothes.
The war on drugs is bullshit.

2968
02:56:55,430 --> 02:56:59,690
It is from beginning to end and it's a
grotesque abuse of the right of adults to

2969
02:56:59,691 --> 02:57:02,660
make decisions about their own
bodies and their own consciousness.

2970
02:57:02,661 --> 02:57:06,950
So right on with Colorado and the
American people who are making this happen

2971
02:57:06,980 --> 02:57:09,590
only in America could this
breakthrough take place.

2972
02:57:09,770 --> 02:57:14,540
It's true that America as a state entity
has been a dark force behind the war on

2973
02:57:14,541 --> 02:57:14,931
drugs,

2974
02:57:14,931 --> 02:57:19,931
but the American people state by state
are unraveling that horror and replacing

2975
02:57:20,001 --> 02:57:22,400
it with something new.
This could never happen in Britain.

2976
02:57:22,610 --> 02:57:25,970
I mean we have counties in Britain
like Yorkshire or Northumberland.

2977
02:57:26,150 --> 02:57:31,150
I can't envisage a situation ever where
Yorkshire would make marijuana legal

2978
02:57:31,700 --> 02:57:33,050
when London says no,

2979
02:57:33,200 --> 02:57:36,800
but in America you can do it and this
is going to change the world. It's not.

2980
02:57:36,830 --> 02:57:39,830
It's not because of marijuana itself.
That's not the point.

2981
02:57:39,831 --> 02:57:41,150
It's not about getting high.

2982
02:57:41,300 --> 02:57:45,350
It's about respecting the rights of
adults to make decisions about their own

2983
02:57:45,351 --> 02:57:47,600
bodies, their own health
and their own consciousness.

2984
02:57:47,601 --> 02:57:50,690
That is a fundamental human right and
we're beginning to realize that that's

2985
02:57:50,691 --> 02:57:53,210
exactly what's been taken away
from us by the war on drugs.

2986
02:57:53,300 --> 02:57:55,880
I think it's also about making
decisions based on data.

2987
02:57:55,881 --> 02:57:58,820
And I think in a way that parallels
what you guys are up to. Yeah.

2988
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:02,070
Because I think people are
understanding now that we, we've been

2989
02:58:02,070 --> 02:58:05,070
sold a bill of goods by these so
called experts about marijuana.

2990
02:58:05,670 --> 02:58:08,610
They've told us so many long nonsense.
And not only that,

2991
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:13,640
the politicians have hired experts to
review the data and then buried it when it

2992
02:58:13,741 --> 02:58:15,090
did meet your expectations.
Yes,

2993
02:58:15,220 --> 02:58:16,690
exactly.
Well,

2994
02:58:16,691 --> 02:58:21,370
I have to confess that all of this with
me started back in the old days when I

2995
02:58:21,371 --> 02:58:26,290
was camping in these canyon lands
into Western states and altering my

2996
02:58:26,291 --> 02:58:30,820
consciousness and looking at the landscape
and going, something is going on here.

2997
02:58:30,880 --> 02:58:35,880
There's a story here that is
wanting to come out and you know,

2998
02:58:36,611 --> 02:58:38,530
you can,
I think that you have the Ph.

2999
02:58:38,560 --> 02:58:42,850
We have the potential literally to
almost time travel with some of these

3000
02:58:42,851 --> 02:58:47,500
substances and peer into the past and
see it in ways that we would have never

3001
02:58:47,501 --> 02:58:52,240
seen otherwise. Um, and then
not literally, but like get
a, a sense of your mind.

3002
02:58:52,241 --> 02:58:54,670
He knew perspective,
a fresh view.

3003
02:58:55,180 --> 02:58:57,760
You were talking about it the last time
you were here that you were on acid.

3004
02:58:57,761 --> 02:58:59,230
Right?
That's what it was.

3005
02:58:59,600 --> 02:59:03,320
I said in Payoti mostly the
children of this little bit of that,

3006
02:59:04,970 --> 02:59:09,670
but yeah, yeah. Spending, you know, a lot
of time out, you know, hiking and camping,

3007
02:59:09,760 --> 02:59:10,420
you know,
from,

3008
02:59:10,420 --> 02:59:14,360
from Minnesota to the Pacific Ocean and
all those Northwestern states. You know,

3009
02:59:14,380 --> 02:59:18,580
I spent months out there, you know,
just hanging in the landscape, you know,

3010
02:59:18,581 --> 02:59:22,310
living in, in, in tents up
on mountain tops and, and,

3011
02:59:22,311 --> 02:59:25,990
and thinking about what was
I seeing, you know, and um,

3012
02:59:26,080 --> 02:59:30,640
that's really where it started for me.
And I think that combining, combining,

3013
02:59:31,020 --> 02:59:32,950
you know,
this immersion into the landscape,

3014
02:59:32,951 --> 02:59:35,140
you're talking about
the sensory deprivation,

3015
02:59:35,440 --> 02:59:39,430
which is a way to powerfully go in.
At the same time,

3016
02:59:39,431 --> 02:59:43,090
you can have the counterpart of that
which is powerfully going out and seeing,

3017
02:59:43,450 --> 02:59:46,240
seeing the night sky
in this altered state,

3018
02:59:46,241 --> 02:59:50,740
seeing the landscapes around you and
realizing that a heel isn't just a hill.

3019
02:59:50,800 --> 02:59:52,210
There's a story there.
There's,

3020
02:59:52,540 --> 02:59:55,910
there's some process that
we have to come to come to,

3021
02:59:55,930 --> 02:59:59,100
to reckon with in order to understand
this planet we're living on.

3022
02:59:59,470 --> 03:00:01,090
There's an interesting point here,

3023
03:00:01,690 --> 03:00:06,220
which is the part of the
technological world is to regard, uh,

3024
03:00:06,280 --> 03:00:11,170
nature as a matter as dead. You'd know
that there's just this dead [inaudible].

3025
03:00:11,300 --> 03:00:15,010
We're the only consciousness on
the planet in the, in the universe.

3026
03:00:15,011 --> 03:00:18,340
And they will refuse to consider the
possibility that nature may be highly

3027
03:00:18,341 --> 03:00:21,730
conscious and highly intelligent,
but there may be intelligence in nature.

3028
03:00:21,731 --> 03:00:24,580
And it seems to me what
the psychedelics are,

3029
03:00:24,850 --> 03:00:29,050
are nature's way of speaking to us
when we've closed our minds and shut

3030
03:00:29,051 --> 03:00:34,051
ourselves down when we've taken the soul
out of the universe and just turned it

3031
03:00:34,121 --> 03:00:37,180
into a huge machine, the psychedelics
are coming back and saying,

3032
03:00:37,181 --> 03:00:39,910
hang on you monkeys.

3033
03:00:40,090 --> 03:00:44,590
I don't know everything. Listen
to us. We got something to teach.

3034
03:00:44,650 --> 03:00:49,190
And with that we just ran through three
hours. Yeah, that's it. How crazy is that?

3035
03:00:49,430 --> 03:00:51,490
Those three hours?
It seems like it's 20 minutes.

3036
03:00:51,880 --> 03:00:55,600
It was probably more than three hours,
right? We overtime we're over. Uh, listen,

3037
03:00:55,630 --> 03:00:58,210
thank you so much, Graham.
Hancock, magicians of the gods.

3038
03:00:58,211 --> 03:01:01,660
You can get it right now on, what is
your website again? Graham hancock.com.

3039
03:01:01,780 --> 03:01:06,220

International. Sacred geometry.

3040
03:01:06,221 --> 03:01:10,120
I. N. T I believe is your Twitter handle?
Is that what it is? I think that's right.

3041
03:01:10,140 --> 03:01:14,890
Um, I'll check right now real quick. Yes.
Sacred geometry. Just sacred geo. Sacred.

3042
03:01:14,891 --> 03:01:17,860
G. O. I. N. T. Okay. And
Randall, thank you so much.

3043
03:01:18,520 --> 03:01:23,110
Knowing double underscore between the
grass. Well, you could find it folks.

3044
03:01:23,111 --> 03:01:26,260
If you go to my Twitter page,
it'll be on my Twitter page.

3045
03:01:26,590 --> 03:01:28,300
You could find both of their,
uh,

3046
03:01:28,360 --> 03:01:31,720
their Twitter handles on the post that
we made about this. Let's do this again.

3047
03:01:31,750 --> 03:01:33,310
Can we do this again?
Absolutely. I'm a port.

3048
03:01:33,340 --> 03:01:35,600
Let's do it again in a couple
of months. Fantastic. All Right,

3049
03:01:35,650 --> 03:01:39,370
ladies and gentlemen, thank you
very much. We'll see you soon. Joe.

3050
03:01:39,371 --> 03:01:40,480
I would like to keep you out,

3051
03:01:49,190 --> 03:01:50,023
okay.

3052
03:01:53,130 --> 03:01:53,190
Okay.
