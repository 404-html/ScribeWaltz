1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,610
did anyone send you a that
grand theft auto dmt trip?

3
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:08,460
A lot of people think that
you had a big influence in it.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,010
I'm sure there's a lot of
people done dmt besides me,

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,711
but it it,

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:16,160
it starts off with this guy and you're
just driving around with your father and

7
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:16,580
then he,

8
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,380
the kid tricks him into taking it
while he's driving so he starts

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,313
tripping out

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,920
fucking shit to you from your

11
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,783
crazy dad

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,350
down on the ground.

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,243
Tripping balls.

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:40,491
Yeah.

15
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:41,540
And then watch what happens.

16
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,570
This is the part where it
starts getting really agony.

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,150
This is fucking awesome shit.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,490
It's something.

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,383
Where

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,300
does it go?

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,600
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.

22
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,420
Yeah.

23
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,350
He's getting inducted by aliens.

24
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:32,020
Monkeys first and then the alien
ship shoots him up into a spaceship.

25
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:35,530
This is people in near
on the same wavelength.

26
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,490
If they didn't hear them,

27
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:38,980
if they don't know me and know
me when they were coding this,

28
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,620
they need to show to you are you are
the herpes that there is no cure for it.

29
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,250
We are on the same wavelength.

30
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,740
We would get along great
if they don't know me,

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,260
we would get along great if
this wasn't inspired by me.

32
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,510
Definitely fucking comic people.

33
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:54,920
Everyone you have terminated all of this.

34
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,640
You see that he did this alien
given the fucking metal side.

35
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,710
Wow.

36
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,460
This is intense shit made
this with no underwear though,

37
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,320
but why are you hiding
your Dick and an asshole?

38
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,560
You're just flying through space to me.

39
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,100
Oh you shouldn't.

40
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,070
You shouldn't be holding onto your team.

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,360
Your fear and your insecurities.

42
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,550
Let the breeze flow through that left
flies this hover on your asshole flying

43
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:19,611
around in space.

44
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:20,091
What do you care?

45
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:20,340
And you're.

46
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,380
You're one with the universe,

47
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,440
so the trip and you can get high
and every time he gets it here,

48
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,640
inner thoughts and it's really trippy.

49
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:32,570
So like once it goes online first all as
comics or I'll just kind of hanging out

50
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:33,261
at the comedy store,

51
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:34,250
smoke weed together

52
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,420
and gets into the oculus rift.

53
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,430
I've heard that this game is the most
successful single piece of anything

54
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:46,010
anybody created over
$1,000,000,000 in three days.

55
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,670
Not Amazing.

56
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,920
It's amazing,

57
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:50,870
but there's never been anything
that's sold as well as this.

58
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,880
God bless America.

59
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,180
Right.

60
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,400
When you think the economy's down

61
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,620
cocaine or both in a day?

62
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:00,454
Yes.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,790
It is only so much flow.

64
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,520
You could do.

65
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:03,780
I mean,

66
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,500
after the one time I was offered dmt
by buddy buddy's buddy and we're up in

67
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,334
Canada and he's like,

68
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,091
hey man,

69
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:11,920
I got this shit is dmt,

70
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,110
and he's like,

71
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,943
I'm a,

72
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:14,720
I'm a.

73
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,251
You heard of it?

74
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:15,580
I'm like,

75
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,630
I'm familiar.

76
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,291
I've heard of it.

77
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:17,660
I haven't.

78
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,580
I know some people that I've talked about
it like it's just a so why don't we go

79
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:24,090
back and we're all out
drinking and hanging out.

80
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,460
I'm like,

81
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,293
no,

82
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,860
he don't want to do dmt when your bank
and start shoving fucking hallucinogenic

83
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,930
drugs up my body with a guy that just

84
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,810
does not sound like a good idea and I'll
wake up glazed like a fucking krispy

85
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:38,970
kreme doughnut or fucking,

86
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,170
you know,

87
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,390
that's when somebody gets eaten.

88
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,901
Yeah.

89
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:41,770
That could happen too.

90
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,970
Yeah.

91
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,590
Especially when you're drinking now.

92
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,041
Usually not.

93
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,060
Suppose you're not even supposed to.

94
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:50,110
He was just too nonchalant about
slinging us fucking doing dmt.

95
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:50,550
I'm like,

96
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,340
that should be taken with a lot more
care when they give him some of that.

97
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,350
What's the fuck a viking?

98
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:56,184
That's what that is.

99
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,700
No fucking Viking

100
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,641
roofie them up,

101
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,540
but some DMT.

102
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,530
You're a fucking human being.
