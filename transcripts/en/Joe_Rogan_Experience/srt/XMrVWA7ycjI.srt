1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:04,940
Hey everybody,
what's up?

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,000
This episode of the showings parents 
podcast is brought to you by stamps.com.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,600
You've probably heard,
but the cost of a stamp just went up to 

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,631
forty nine cents and by the way,
if you're complaining about a stamp 

5
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:21,060
being forty nine cents,
you're a Douche bag.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,680
It's only forty nine cents.
Imagine if I had to give you money to 

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,290
take a fucking letter across the 
country.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,750
I think you'd want more than forty nine 
cents.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,230
It's an awesome bargain,
but let's be honest.

10
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:34,940
Go into the post office.
Sucks the fat Dick.

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,110
We all know what does.

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,420
It's slow.
It's slow.

13
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:38,710
It's not efficient,
it's boring.

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,790
It's fucking boring.
My mom sent me a letter that had the 

15
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,890
wrong postage on it and it went all the 
way to Burbank and then the burbank post

16
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:45,310
office.
It's like,

17
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:50,311
Hey,
this doesn't have enough postage on it 

18
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:50,311
and send it back.
Oh Jill,

19
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:50,560
genius.
Fucking brilliant.

20
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,770
The real issue is if you have a small 
business,

21
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,290
if you have a small business,
if you send things through the mail,

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,500
that's a place where a service like 
stamps.com

23
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,530
is invaluable because with stamps.com
does is it allows you to print us 

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,730
postage on a regular home computer,
regular printer,

25
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,370
just print it out,
stick it on packages,

26
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,080
mailman comes,
hand it to him,

27
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,170
done.
They give you a digital scale with the 

28
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,691
free j r e $110 bonus offer,
and this free digital scale allows you 

29
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:20,860
to measure mushrooms.
Well,

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,240
no,
don't do that.

31
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,260
It's not what I meant allows you to 
measure your packages.

32
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:26,830
Yes,
yes,

33
00:01:26,831 --> 00:01:27,250
yes,
yes.

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,780
As your packages and print up actual us 
postage on your computer and then just 

35
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:35,290
send it off.
It's genius.

36
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,440
It's really a beautiful way to save a 
lot of time,

37
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,560
especially if you send things on a 
regular basis,

38
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:43,150
especially if they're varying weights.

39
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,460
Oh my goodness.
That is annoying.

40
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:47,140
You know,
it's annoying and I know it's annoying.

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,230
This is an easy way to work around that.

42

44
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,960
even if the government changes the rate,
which I think they're entitled to.

45
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:06,150

Jerry were also brought to you by 
[inaudible] dot com.

62
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:54,760
That's o n I t o n n let me say it again
on it,

63
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,910
o n n I t if you've heard this podcast,
he probably heard noncommercial and 

64
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,450
there's way for me to do them any other 
way.

65
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,370
This is,
this is what it is,

66
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,940
what we sell it on.
It is everything that I use,

67
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:11,941
everything that arbor uses,
everything that we find out about that 

68
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,730
is beneficial to either physical 
fitness,

69
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:16,540
beneficial to cognitive function,
healthy snacks like hemp,

70
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,020
hemp force protein bars or Tonka,
buffalo bars which are made the old 

71
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:24,250
school way,
the same way,

72
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:29,251
uh,
of the native Americans used to make 

73
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:29,251
them.

74
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:29,251
So actually buffaloes and cranberries 
and shit.

75
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,670
They're delicious.
And it's not bad for you man.

76
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:33,430
It's a,
it's actually an interesting t to eat.

77
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,110
No MSG,
no soy,

78
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,990
no lactose,
which has tried to sell cool shit.

79
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,300
Hemp force protein powder.
Um,

80
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:45,301
whether it's um,
cognitive enhancement supplements like 

81
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:47,380
Alpha brain or new mood,
which by the way,

82
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:52,381
Alpha brain,
we released the results of the first 

83
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:52,381
clinical trial.
Very positive,

84
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:57,300
especially in two areas and execution 
and memory and all the results are 

85
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:02,371
available online.
You could find them on the Alpha brain 

86
00:04:02,371 --> 00:04:03,550
page and we're in the middle of a much 
larger study.

87
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,590
Now.
That study was actually a,

88
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:06,790
um,
what they call it,

89
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:10,180
pilot study.
They do a study of say like 16 to 20.

90
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:15,181
Well I guess it was 20 people initially 
and I think it got down to 17 or 16 and 

91
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:16,050
what happens is some people just quit,
you know,

92
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,210
people are fucking flaky,
but the pilot study is to make sure that

93
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,270
the protocol is a adequate,
you know,

94
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,860
we decided to go with a two pills per 
person.

95
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,790
I take four before I do things,
but I'm a fucking maniac folks.

96
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,920
That's just what I do.
I'm crazy like that.

97
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,180
And on a one 80 actually has alpha brain
in it,

98
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,590
a little bit of new mood as well.
Some five htp and on a one 80 is 

99
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:43,651
fantastic for me.
For anytime I fly somewhere I just 

100
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:47,140
immediately take that upon landing.
Anytime I feel like I have jetlag,

101
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,840
anytime I'm boozing it up,
which I,

102
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,570
I really don't do anymore.
I gave out boozing it up with me.

103
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,500
I still get high,
but uh,

104
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,990
I just,
I just don't.

105
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,120
The rec afterwards just sucks so hard,
man.

106
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,610
I've been doing the same thing.
Yeah.

107
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,570
Uh,
I try to limit it to two drinks.

108
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:09,571
If I go out a lot of times I don't even 
have the desire to have more than one 

109
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:10,300
because why do that?

110
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,520
When you can do other things that are 
better and don't give you a hangover?

111
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,580
Exactly.
The other night I had to and it was 

112
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,621
crazy.
I had a glass of wine with dinner and 

113
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:19,621
then I was out with some friends and I 
had a jack and coke.

114
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:23,341
I was nuts.
It was a very mild jack and coke though 

115
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:26,300
a point being the,
the issues that you deal with when you 

116
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:28,150
are hung over.
There's a bunch,

117
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:33,151
there's dehydration,
but there's also a depletion depletion 

118
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:35,020
of all the beautiful things that make 
your mind rich and interesting.

119
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:36,260
Like Serotonin,
you know,

120
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:41,261
you fucked up from alcohol man,
and you get fucked up from the lack of 

121
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:45,001
sleep.
You don't get good sleep when you'd go 

122
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:45,001
to bed drunk.
I mean you're just a mess.

123
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:49,830
All the ingredients in Alpha brain and 
all the ingredients in one a or any of 

124
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,260
the other supplements that we have are 
available at [inaudible] dot com,

125
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:58,290
along with all of the scientific 
research and references that point to 

126
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:58,340
individual

127
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,450
studies about individual ingredients and
the most recent study on Alpha brain,

128
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:07,451
which is the study on the actual 
combination of the ingredients to 

129
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,640
achieve a synergistic effect.
There's a lot of science behind it,

130
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:15,641
but there's also a lot of controversy.
So to alleviate some of the concern at 

131
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,360
Onnit,
we offer a 90 day 30 pill,

132
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:20,840
100 percent money back guarantee.
So if you buy a bottle of Alpha brain 30

133
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:25,841
pills,
you have 90 days to tell us it's 

134
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:25,841
bullshit.
And if you don't like it,

135
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:27,950
I look,
I have no idea how your brain works.

136
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,380
Uh,
I know for me it's not just beneficial,

137
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:31,880
it's essential.
I love the shit.

138
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,180
I feel nervous if I do a UFC without it.
I really do.

139
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:40,181
I.
I think that it helps me form sentences 

140
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:43,721
better as I form a shitty sentence.
It helps me when I'm searching for 

141
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:46,070
words,
I get them easier and I know that sounds

142
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:48,440
weird,
but go on at.com.

143
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,700
O n n I t used the Codeword Rogan save 
10 percent off any and all supplemental.

144
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:53,780
Alright.
Boom.

145
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,180
Cello clock.
Boom.

146
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,560
David Seaman is here and we're fixing a 
busy.

147
00:06:57,561 --> 00:07:00,760
We've got a lot of shit to talk about.
Hitting the bitcoin fan.

148
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,830
It is.
Shit's crazy.

149
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,410
Fair.

150
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,970
The Joe Rogan experience.

151
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,740
Joe Rogan podcasts all day.

152
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,090
Fitting that our friend David Seaman is 
here the very day that Mt.

153
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,250
Gox the big storage place or whatever 
the fuck it is.

154
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:22,780
This site,
the,

155
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,270
it's an online exchange for bitcoin.
The exchange is diggity.

156
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:29,860
Diggity done.
Yeah.

157
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,520
So it hit the wall.
I'm like the forrest gump kind of random

158
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:38,521
trends.
Like I'm always kind of in the 

159
00:07:38,521 --> 00:07:38,920
background of all this completely 
unrelated shit and yeah,

160
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,070
Mt.
Gox was run by this guy who is a,

161
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,650
uh,
allegedly kind of a,

162
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,940
a piece of shit I got to say like 
allegedly is you guys do.

163
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:53,941
But as a respectable journalists,
I've heard sources say he's a piece of 

164
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:54,330
shit.
And uh,

165
00:07:55,150 --> 00:08:00,150
so there is an error in the way that his
site interacts with the overall bitcoin 

166
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,430
network and the same way that if you,
you know,

167
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,130
are using email and you happen to 
download a shitty email program,

168
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:11,131
like a knockoff version of outlook and 
it fucks up the way you send your 

169
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:15,061
emails.
It doesn't mean there's a problem with 

170
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:15,061
email.
There's a problem with what you're using

171
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:15,460
and the way you've implemented it.

172
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,700
And email has been used enough by now 
that we know that it works.

173
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:24,090
And it was kind of a similar issue here 
where there was an incompetent 

174
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,570
implementation and some hackers were 
able to steal over time,

175
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,750
somewhere between $300,
million to $400,000,000

176
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,180
worth of bitcoin.
So it's pretty brutal.

177
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,180
And bitcoins taking a bashing in the 
press,

178
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,830
which is well deserved.
But uh,

179
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,860
I personally bought more or less night 
because I've just been reading about it 

180
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,641
so much that I actually kind of believe 
it and I'm drinking the Koolaid and in 

181
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:45,130
that case when some shit like that 
happens,

182
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:50,131
it's not a tragedy,
it's actually kind of an opportunity 

183
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:52,351
because I'm like,
well now I can actually buy some more 

184
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:54,760
this instead of only having a little bit
of the future currency of the new world 

185
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,501
order,
I'll have a real fraction of it and I'm 

186
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:58,501
already getting shit from people who are
like,

187
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:01,650
you're promoting a product that is new 
world order designed.

188
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,180
And I'm like,
do you have any evidence of that?

189
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:06,540
Like have you actually read even a 10th 
as much of the people who were reporting

190
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:11,541
on this shit?
Like everything is out there about 

191
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:11,541
bitcoin and yet they're already moving 
towards.

192
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,470
It was created by two.

193
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,850
I think that's sort of what we were 
talking about before the podcast 

194
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,510
started,
that there's a bunch of people that love

195
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,200
for something to be a conspiracy.
So they look for it and everything in 

196
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,210
anything,
things that are.

197
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,990
I've been involved in things where I 
know there was no conspiracy.

198
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,080
I know I was there and yet I've had 
people tell me that it was like ufc 

199
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:36,650
fights,
like the things are fixed,

200
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:39,410
that someone wasn't really injured and 
that they're just.

201
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,410
It's a big scam and all it is is to set 
up another fight.

202
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:47,030
They had this all along shuffle.
It's like people love to think,

203
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,270
well,
it's because there are some 

204
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,651
conspiracies,
so they go looking for him because they 

205
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:53,651
don't want to be a fool.
Right?

206
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:54,850
Nobody wants to be fooled by them and 
that that is the number one problem with

207
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:57,200
the fact that conspiracies have actually
existed.

208
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,120
They've muddied the water so badly.
It's sort of like a disinflation tactic.

209
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,430
It's like one of the things that I 
always talk about,

210
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:09,431
like if you read anything about 
intelligence and you read that not not 

211
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:09,431
intelligence,
like human intelligence,

212
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:12,590
but intelligence reporting for the 
government.

213
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,280
One of the things they do when they're 
trying to control information is they 

214
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,620
discredited by attaching it to 
ridiculous shit.

215
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,910
It's just what they do.

216
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:25,190
Yeah.
It's actually like a an actual 

217
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,991
strategies you mix in the bullshit with 
the good stuff poisons the well and you 

218
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:26,991
don't believe any of it.

219
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:32,070
Yeah.
It's like if you believe in something 

220
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,070
absolutely ridiculous for long with some
really interesting shit,

221
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,490
they can automatically point to that 
ridiculous thing and say,

222
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,440
let's say same guy believes that people 
are reading your mind from a base on the

223
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,920
moon and then he goes,
that true.

224
00:10:44,921 --> 00:10:46,360
Does he really believe that?
Well,

225
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:47,770
then you find out what's really going 
on.

226
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:51,010
You find out that all this other stuff,
like if you ever read Bill Cooper,

227
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,790
no course,
I've heard of that book for some reason,

228
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,680
but you will.
You read it and you go,

229
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:58,510
wow,
this stuff's really fascinating.

230
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,010
And then he starts talking about alien 
bases on the moon and you're like,

231
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,320
wait,
wait,

232
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:01,620
wait,
wait,

233
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:02,170
wait.
What?

234
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,330
Yeah,
started talking like that actress 

235
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,240
Shirley Mcclain has a book,
has a book that I was skimming through.

236
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:13,241
That's all about like how in the 19 
fifties the US government had a secret 

237
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:17,681
meeting with like seven different 
species of alien and there was this 

238
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:18,890
council and even though she's a good 
actress,

239
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:23,891
you reading this shit and you're like,
I can't believe anything you're saying 

240
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:23,891
now because this is a little out there.
She's awake.

241
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:24,770
He wacky,
broad.

242
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,980
Have you ever heard her talk about look,
sidekicks and all kinds of other shit?

243
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,040
No,
I'm just skimming this book and it was 

244
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,040
enough.
She's alone.

245
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,440
She's a full on loan,
but what?

246
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:38,441
But she could totally be right.
I want to add that and also I want to 

247
00:11:38,441 --> 00:11:38,630
believe she's right about the alien 
council.

248
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,320
She's asleep.
Silly

249
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,640
person.
I mean you could,

250
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,670
you could Google shirleen mcclain and 
find out all the different spiritual 

251
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,290
healing energy things she's into and 
yeah,

252
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,730
she's.
She's just an erotic massage probably.

253
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,980
She's The lady that you know,
like there's a thing that to humans,

254
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,980
and it's the same thing.
It happens to men and it happens for 

255
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,100
women when they stopped being desirable 
physically.

256
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,280
They often look to fantastical and 
unimaginable things like Ufo shows or 

257
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,480
fucking spiritual awakenings and psyche.
They look for something that drags them 

258
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:18,061
out of the mundane existence of biology 
because if the UFO was real,

259
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,710
if aliens were real,
if big foot was real,

260
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:25,711
if you could really read people's minds,
it wouldn't matter if no one wanted to 

261
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:26,250
fuck you anymore.
Yeah.

262
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,790
There's something that's bigger than 
yourself.

263
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,790
So this is a reason why like menopausal 
women,

264
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,580
like older women get really into that 
kind of shit.

265
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,910
Like if you look at like,
and I'm not saying that young women 

266
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:38,910
don't get into it too.
They certainly do.

267
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,170
I would.
Men,

268
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,560
there are a lot of men,
a lot of men who are in the weird shit.

269
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,660
Fuck yeah.
I mean this is just one theory,

270
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,870
but there's,
there's a spiritual thing that happens 

271
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,240
to a to a lot of older men and older 
women where they,

272
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,850
they start looking for like,
you know,

273
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,920
paranormal things to start looking for.
Well,

274
00:12:56,921 --> 00:13:01,921
they're starting to feel more spiritual 
because they're getting toward that 

275
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:01,921
point in life where you got to think 
about that shit.

276
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:06,150
This is a little of that definitely,
but in the search for things and search 

277
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:11,131
for things unseen,
like the search for big or search for 

278
00:13:11,131 --> 00:13:11,440
aliens,
I really do believe that a lot of what's

279
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:16,441
going on as if aliens were real.
It wouldn't matter if no one wanted to 

280
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:16,480
fuck them and they're sleeping on a 
friend's couch and they're 50.

281
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,100
It really wouldn't matter.
You know?

282
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,670
You guys don't know shit.
Let me tell you something,

283
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:26,671
but what the aliens they would get if 
they just had a weed Brownie or maybe 

284
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:28,660
like a weekend camping or something,
is that it already doesn't matter.

285
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,690
They don't need to find that other thing
to make their life seem like it's not a 

286
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,900
big deal.
Just look up in the sky.

287
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,150
Sometimes nothing matters with 
certainty.

288
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,570
There is some crazy article in 
scientific American that if you were to 

289
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,410
add up all the people who've ever lived 
on earth,

290
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,230
it's like a $100 billion people.
Yeah,

291
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,760
so you just don't matter.
Period.

292
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,150
Like where were these fucking things 
that are running around trying to spread

293
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:57,151
our,
our genetic code and then our hearts 

294
00:13:57,151 --> 00:13:59,911
filled with cholesterol and we die.
It's like some weird video game and so 

295
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:04,590
somebody like that feels that they need 
to find religion or they need to find 

296
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,680
aliens in order to feel like they're a 
part of things.

297
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,230
They're already a part of things so they
already don't matter.

298
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:09,520
So what more do you need?
It's like,

299
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:10,570
that's perfect right there.

300
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,460
I don't even think it's a don't matter 
thing.

301
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:16,060
I think they're looking for something 
exciting for a lot of people.

302
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,970
I mean obviously it's just one of these 
goofy theories I'm chasing down,

303
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,720
but for a lot of people when it comes to
what matters in life,

304
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:25,780
one of the big things that matters in 
life is being sexually desirable.

305
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,000
And when you stopped being sexually 
desirable,

306
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:32,200
like unequivocably no argument,
no one wants to fuck you.

307
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,260
Right?
And it happens sooner to women than it 

308
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:37,750
does men.
Because for a man you're like 18 or 20.

309
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,970
Nobody wants to fuck you because you 
have nothing going on.

310
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,640
Start to get into your mid twenties.
If you're good looking,

311
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:44,320
you might be able to get something based
on that,

312
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,680
but as you get older you get more status
and more experience.

313
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,700
You know what the fuck you're talking 
about more often.

314
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,160
That's where attraction comes from,

315
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,970
but for women it's like twenties.
You're fucking prime right there.

316
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:58,490
You're already at the Max and the 25 is 
still good.

317
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,420
Still good,
but as you get older,

318
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:04,430
as society is not just heaping you a 
heaping status upon you,

319
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:09,431
right?
It's still for you very much looks 

320
00:15:09,431 --> 00:15:09,431
based.
Whereas an older guy,

321
00:15:09,431 --> 00:15:12,080
nobody cares what Richard Branson looks 
like or what Felix Dennis looked like.

322
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:17,081
It's more about who they are,
but if some actresses in a show and she 

323
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:18,040
looks old,
everybody will say that.

324
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,980
Yeah,
there's definitely something in that,

325
00:15:19,981 --> 00:15:24,981
but I think like Richard Branson,
if he's got a really young hot wife and 

326
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:25,860
that wife has got a personal trainer,
she's going to let him fuck her.

327
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,870
You think so?
I think so.

328
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:34,110
I think that guy would think that.
I think that trainer would end up on an 

329
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,310
unsuccessful space flight.
Never come back.

330
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,080
I mean,
I don't think it's going to fuck her all

331
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:39,730
the time unless he's stupid,

332
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,380
you know,
you gotta make sure you don't turn into 

333
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:45,380
a relationship.
But I think a lot of gold diggers,

334
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,640
they looked to fuck young guys for sure.
Some young studly broke bodybuilder type

335
00:15:51,961 --> 00:15:54,540
dude with a giant hug because that's 
what they really want

336
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,910
the end of the day.
They want the status,

337
00:15:56,911 --> 00:15:58,500
but they also want something physical.
Oh,

338
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:00,870
women just want the money into sex and 
that's all men want.

339
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,740
Also,
you know,

340
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:03,550
when I was young,
when I was a

341
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,800
again my,
uh,

342
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,860
my late teens and early twenties,
it was the most undesirable I've ever 

343
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,070
been in my life.
Like I had the hardest time getting laid

344
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,040
the hardest because I was broke,
I was poor and I was,

345
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,250
you know,
it didn't even matter if I was 

346
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,280
successful in some things like sports,
which I was,

347
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:24,810
it didn't matter because what was 
important was money was important,

348
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:28,770
was financial success was important with
you not being a loser.

349
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:33,150
And I was a loser as far as like bank 
accounts and as far as where I lived,

350
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,020
I was a loser and I was a young man.
And every young man's,

351
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,970
unless you're born rich,
you're starting out as a loser,

352
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,890
you don't have anything to show.
And women had no desire to be with me.

353
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:49,050
Zero.
There are guys who really kind of get 

354
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,250
off on being able to bring women back 
and have nothing going on.

355
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,680
We like,
look at what a loser I am and I'm still 

356
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:56,680
getting laid.
So that kind of thing.

357
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,430
You can use that to your advantage 
probably.

358
00:16:57,431 --> 00:16:58,660
That's what I do.
When I was at colleges,

359
00:16:58,661 --> 00:16:59,110
I was like,
yeah,

360
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:01,900
I'm a loser,
but if this is what I can pull now think

361
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:04,120
about 10 years from now when you're 
actually not a loser,

362
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,800
how good things might be,
you know.

363
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:07,750
So that's a way to motivate yourself.
Well,

364
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:09,780
it also depends on what you're willing 
to fuck to.

365
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,980
I mean,
everybody can get laid if you drop your 

366
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,311
standards lower enough.
Women have the advantage in that area 

367
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,970
because they can always get high quality
sex.

368
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:23,971
Whereas a guy like you really can't 
unless you're at a certain stage in 

369
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:27,811
life,
you can't just walk in somewhere and go 

370
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:28,210
home with somebody that night,
but a woman can do that anywhere.

371
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,330
But the balance is that that's not what 
most women want,

372
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,680
right?
They want different things,

373
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,590
relationships,

374
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,000
they want,
you know,

375
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,920
I think most women,
by the way,

376
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,970
this is just massive generalizations.
There's,

377
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,980
there's some women that just want to 
fuck you and kick you right out the 

378
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:43,980
door,
get out,

379
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:43,980
go by,
don't kiss me by.

380
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,020
I mean,
you know,

381
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:46,610
and that's fine too.
The,

382
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:47,600
uh,
the differences,

383
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,050
that guy laughs as he's getting out.
Okay.

384
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,800
You know?
Whereas if you do that to a girl,

385
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:54,330
like you're the worst piece of shit 
ever.

386
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,970
If you fucked a girl and then after you 
die,

387
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,390
like,
look,

388
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,500
you got to go.
Don't kiss me.

389
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,030
Go.
No,

390
00:17:59,031 --> 00:17:59,280
no,
no,

391
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,160
no hugs.
Yeah,

392
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,150
it's a real,
like a sociopath kind of thing to do.

393
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,610
Right?
But if a girl does it to a guy,

394
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,540
guy will go tell his friends,
dude,

395
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,210
she suck my Dick.
I fucked her.

396
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,430
Debbage kicked me out.
She had to go to work.

397
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:12,570
She came out,
she told me,

398
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:13,740
don't kiss her.
Listen,

399
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,540
this isn't going anywhere and get out.
I was like,

400
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,480
okay,
I'll call you if you want to fuck again.

401
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,270
Okay,
please do.

402
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,110
Thanks.
Yeah.

403
00:18:19,111 --> 00:18:21,120
I think everybody's had that experience 
where you're like,

404
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,880
I was just used and you're like,
wait a second.

405
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:24,210
So that's a bad.
Was awesome.

406
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,530
Totally different.

407
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,680
But I think it's totally different 
because women have a different instinct 

408
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,110
for the most part,
in a massive generalization,

409
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:35,310
by the way women have the instinct to 
try to find a guy that they can trust,

410
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,580
try to,
you know,

411
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,750
spend unless you're done,
unless you've been through a few and 

412
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,750
you're like,
well,

413
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,510
it's over.
It's what the Cougar thing is.

414
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,240
So people like about cougars,
the fucking given up.

415
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,880
I just like women who have their shit 
together and cougars tend to be more 

416
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:50,880
professional,
like executive types.

417
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:55,930
[inaudible],
I no longer go for the starving artist 

418
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,211
because I always like to be the less 
crazy person in the relationship and if 

419
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:05,151
I'm the one that they're relying on for 
some kind of stability and unlike 

420
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:06,030
already completely fucking crazy with 
the stuff I'm working on,

421
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,630
that's not a good thing.
You know,

422
00:19:07,631 --> 00:19:11,250
like when somebody is asking me for 
quarters to use the laundry machine,

423
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,630
it's not a good relationship.

424
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,180
So I'm more into the stability.
Yeah,

425
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:16,050
it's hard,
man.

426
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:18,930
It's hard when when you're dating,
you know,

427
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,970
in water,
the other is really financially 

428
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:23,970
unstable.
It's,

429
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,320
it's always hard because it's very 
stressful,

430
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,140
you know,
and it,

431
00:19:26,141 --> 00:19:31,141
it,
it puts a giant wedge in the 

432
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:31,141
relationship.
I have a friend,

433
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:34,200
she's successful and her boyfriend now,
ex boyfriend is.

434
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,260
I'm not very successful and one of the 
things that they fight about is that 

435
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,151
like he's just frustrated all the time.
He can't get anything going with his 

436
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:44,151
career.
You actually,

437
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,080
it's funny that something just happened 
for them.

438
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:46,810
Right.
As you know,

439
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,440
they broke up.
That always seems to happen.

440
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:54,441
There's like a,
sometimes a Murphy's law going on there 

441
00:19:54,441 --> 00:19:54,660
maybe,
but it's just,

442
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,800
you know,
we were talking about it and she was 

443
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,851
talking about how difficult it is to 
date someone who's really struggling 

444
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:03,180
because it becomes a,
it's a mantra.

445
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,520
It's like going off in the back of the 
head at all times.

446
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,500
Like you're broke,
you owe money,

447
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,670
your bills.
Oh yeah.

448
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:10,560
When you have money problems,
that's all you think about.

449
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:12,390
Collectors are calling you,
you're gonna,

450
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,660
you're gonna.
Get your car repossessed,

451
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,420
you need another job,
you need this,

452
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:17,190
you know,
and that it's just,

453
00:20:17,191 --> 00:20:20,250
it's really hard to date someone like 
that because you don't get them.

454
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:23,130
You get them under massive duress.
Right?

455
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,570
No.
Yeah.

456
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:29,571
It's definitely better if you can walk 
into something where you have a bit of 

457
00:20:29,571 --> 00:20:31,470
money because when you have money,
it's the opposite feeling in your head,

458
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,900
oh,
this could go away if I wanted it to.

459
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,200
Whatever the problem is.
Like this could probably be reduced if I

460
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:37,890
need it to.
Well,

461
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:39,820
there's that for sure,
but this is the.

462
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,830
The big thing that I noticed when I got 
my first development deal wasn't a lot 

463
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:47,950
of money,
but it was enough money to where I could

464
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,500
relax.
Like I wasn't getting rich,

465
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,610
but it was like,
Holy Shit,

466
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:53,270
I've got some money,
like I can really.

467
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,610
I don't have to worry about paying my 
bills.

468
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:59,611
I can pay my rent this month.
There was this crazy weight lifted off 

469
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:02,830
my shoulder and I think I was 25 at the 
time and you know,

470
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:05,740
most of my life up until that point,
from the time I was working,

471
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,280
it was all struggles.
Never.

472
00:21:07,281 --> 00:21:09,970
There's no money in the bank.
The money was in the bank.

473
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:12,520
It was enough to pay whatever check I 
sent out maybe,

474
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,660
and then I was going to have to stuff 
some more money in there as quick as 

475
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,251
possible to pay for the next bill's,
but all the sudden I had some money in 

476
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:23,020
the bank and there was this weird 
feeling of relaxation.

477
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:23,620
I was like,
wow,

478
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:26,080
this is incredible.
Not Rich.

479
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,940
Just not having to worry.

480
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,980
So whenever I give people,
you know,

481
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,450
if I talked to someone who's struggling 
or talk,

482
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,020
someone's trying to plan the future,
I always say,

483
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:36,970
and this is,
it's hard to believe,

484
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:40,000
but it is the truth.
Being rich doesn't matter.

485
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,290
You get used to everything you're doing.
You get used to being in a big house.

486
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,470
I've been in a small apartment.
It felt exactly the same as being in a 

487
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:49,570
big house.
Being in the big house is kind of cool,

488
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,780
but it's definitely not.
It's not worth what it costs to be in a 

489
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,480
big house.
If you think like if you buy a house for

490
00:21:55,481 --> 00:22:00,481
a million bucks,
the amount of money you have to spend 

491
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:03,031
every fucking month on a million dollar 
house and mortgage and fixing it up and 

492
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,930
amount of hours that you have to work.
If you're,

493
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,640
you know,
you work a reasonable job,

494
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,820
you make 100 grand a year or something 
like that.

495
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,190
Normal good wage.
It's a lot of fucking money,

496
00:22:12,191 --> 00:22:13,150
man.
You,

497
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,210
your house cost 10 times what you make 
in a year and you're never going to pay 

498
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,321
it off in a year.
You're going to pay it off in 30 years 

499
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:24,480
and then you're going to have to fucking
pay insurance on the fucking property 

500
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,600
tax.
What do you mean property tax?

501
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,390
I got to pay tax on some shit I already 
bought every year,

502
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,560
right?
Even I already own it.

503
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:34,710
I own the fucking house.
I own the property and I have to pay 

504
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:34,710
you.
What am I paying you for?

505
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,050
I'm giving you money for what I own.
What the fuck is going on here?

506
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,060
And it'll drive you crazy and plumbing 
and electricity and this and that.

507
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,210
When you really stop and think about how
much you're actually working for what 

508
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,941
you're getting out of it,
it's definitely not worth it for most 

509
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:54,001
people,
but what is worth it is to not worry 

510
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:54,001
about going to dinner.

511
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:59,220
If you can have enough money where I can
go and get a meal at a restaurant and 

512
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,470
not think too much about it,
just say I would like the salmon and not

513
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:05,410
look at the price and say the chickens 
this much,

514
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:07,450
but the salmon's you know,
a dollar less.

515
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:09,610
I'll get the salmon instead of thinking 
like that.

516
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:14,611
You can just order what you like.
You could go to a movie and not worry 

517
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:17,971
about the movie.
All the other shit like the difference 

518
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:19,030
between having a lexis and having a 
Mercedes.

519
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,630
The difference between having a a Toyota
and having a Ford,

520
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,330
you get used to everything.
Everything you're doing,

521
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:27,730
you get used to,
as long as your car gets you to work,

522
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:32,790
it's fine.
If you have enough money to buy a 

523
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:32,790
Mustang,
hey,

524
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:32,790
you love mustangs.
Go get a fucking Mustang,

525
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,670
man.
Enjoy yourself.

526
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,890
But if you don't,
don't sweat it.

527
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,980
Do you have a car that gets you there?
That's the real difference between your 

528
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,580
car being repossessed.
You have no money for food,

529
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:45,530
you have no money for rent and being 
able to pay your bills.

530
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,010
That's

531
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,010
the big jump.
The big jumps not for robberies and you 

532
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,130
get used to that.
Still look at Steve Jobs.

533
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,040
He never went crazy and he was worth 
billions.

534
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,970
There's always the fucking turtleneck 
everyday,

535
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,720
but he did go crazy.
He went crazy to like to push success.

536
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:00,580
He went.
He never.

537
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,230
He didn't have a balanced perspective.
No,

538
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:06,500
but I mean in terms of he wasn't buying 
a mansions and cars and stuff nonstop.

539
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,680
No,
but he was so obsessed with the pursuit 

540
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:11,680
of,
you know,

541
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,770
apple being this dominant market player 
and all the money that they made and 

542
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:19,120
yeah,
he went a little crazy just in his own 

543
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,120
way.
You know,

544
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,340
there's a minimalist crazy to where he 
still lived in like the fucking silicon 

545
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,140
valley where I have a friend who lives 
up there.

546
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:26,550
They have a house that they're renting,
but the house was worth $50,

547
00:24:26,551 --> 00:24:27,290
million dollars.

548
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,940
I want to tell you if that house was in 
a fucking van eyes,

549
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,150
it wouldn't be worth 400 grand.
I was looking,

550
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:40,151
I was looking at a,
just a real estate website is San 

551
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:40,151
Francisco.
There was a place for sale.

552
00:24:40,151 --> 00:24:44,600
Those 200,000.
It looked like one of the shacks in 

553
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,310
Detroit.
Just objective like a $10,000

554
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:48,170
property.
You're going for $200,000.

555
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,890
Oh,
no doubt.

556
00:24:48,891 --> 00:24:50,350
If you could put another house in there,
eat.

557
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,160
If you could jam it in there with no 
backyard.

558
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:54,290
Just fucking stuffing on the actual 
footprint.

559
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:57,890
That areas where so much money,
when I say that it wouldn't be worth 400

560
00:24:57,891 --> 00:24:59,630
grand event.
I'm probably exaggerating.

561
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,650
I would say it's probably worth a 
million and van eyes.

562
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,630
It's a very nice house,
but my point is it's not a fucking 14,

563
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:10,631
$15,000,000
house or whatever the fuck they would 

564
00:25:10,631 --> 00:25:10,631
actually wind up getting for it.
It's just not,

565
00:25:10,631 --> 00:25:15,010
but it's in this crazy area where all 
these people have tech money and that 

566
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:15,470
tech money,
squirrely money,

567
00:25:15,471 --> 00:25:15,890
man.

568
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,610
It just.
The,

569
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:18,500
the,
the numbers are crazy.

570
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:21,260
It doesn't make any sense to find out 
how much money.

571
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,140
Some of those guys.
I mean like the Google guys,

572
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,490
the facebook guys and you're like,
what?

573
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,310
Like that's crazy.
That's many yachts,

574
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,920
private jet Manchin,
buy an island money.

575
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:36,921
It's that insane.
What's going to get even crazier in the 

576
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:38,270
years ahead with bitcoin because some of
the earliest adopters,

577
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:40,280
the amount of coins they have,
you think about it,

578
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:40,550
you're like,
well,

579
00:25:40,551 --> 00:25:45,551
these people are for sure going to be 
billionaires and they're going to be at 

580
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:48,881
the upper end of that.
They're not even going to be like low 

581
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:48,881
level billionaires.
Right?

582
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,230
But what would happen if they collected,
if they sold all their bitcoins?

583
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,150
Oh you can't,
you can't sell them all because then you

584
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,920
crash your own market,
you know?

585
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,680
But then what the fuck is the point in 
having it?

586
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,280
I think for them eventually it's about 
living in a world where you walk into a 

587
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,940
store and the prices there and bitcoin 
first.

588
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,350
So I think if they hold out for long 
enough and if it doesn't get fucked over

589
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:14,351
by too much bad stuff like the Mt Gox 
situation that we could live in a place 

590
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:19,631
like that because then you have one 
price regardless of what country you're 

591
00:26:19,631 --> 00:26:19,631
in,
you know,

592
00:26:19,631 --> 00:26:23,120
kind of like a universal language.
It could really happen like it's kind of

593
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:24,830
a long shot,
but it could actually happen.

594
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,430
And in that case that person becomes 
like science fiction rich,

595
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,350
you know,
like we're talking about somebody can be

596
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:32,600
worth hundreds of billions of dollars 
instead of just worth,

597
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,100
you know,
10,000

598
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:36,990
bitcoins or whatever.
So science fiction rich.

599
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,400
So we kind of got off track.
How did this bitcoin collapse?

600
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,130
How this gox thing

601
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,950
take place?
What happened there already?

602
00:26:46,951 --> 00:26:51,951
Conspiracy theories that Mt.
Gox was like some kind of CIA up to 

603
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:54,360
discredit bitcoin really.
So that's what somebody tweeted me,

604
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:58,050
but I don't see any evidence of that.
Like it sounds like something they would

605
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:00,180
want to do if they thought of it in 
advance,

606
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:03,740
but I don't think that's what happened.
I think it was purely incompetence.

607
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,250
This was a website that started like Mt.
Gox is short for magic.

608
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:13,251
The gathering online exchange.
Really it started as a place where 

609
00:27:13,251 --> 00:27:13,720
people sold magic cards.
No,

610
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,350
what not making this up.
This every.

611
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,830
They deserve everything that got this 
company,

612
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,500
this company didn't know what the fuck 
they were doing and didn't,

613
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,920
didn't know their ass from their elbow 
in terms of programming languages.

614
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:30,210
Like somebody told me they programmed 
their trading platform and PHP,

615
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:35,450
which I don't know that much about 
programming that apparently is like 

616
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:35,450
totally not the right language for 
anything financial.

617
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,420
And their whole thing is based on this.
And uh,

618
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,950
so they're just super incompetent and 
for whatever reason,

619
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:45,951
they're the ones who stumbled into this 
massive market of like you're now 

620
00:27:45,951 --> 00:27:47,250
trading billions of dollars a bit coins 
and supporting the whole planets,

621
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:48,200
you know,
Bitcoin,

622
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,690
a market and they weren't ready for 
that.

623
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,740
And just series of fuck ups at every 
stage of bad pr,

624
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,730
bad at communicating what's going on 
when something doesn't work,

625
00:27:59,731 --> 00:28:04,731
they just take it offline,
not realizing the implications of what 

626
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:07,291
you're going to scare the shit out of 
the whole market if you just take shit 

627
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:07,291
off line and don't tell people in 
advance.

628
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:12,200
And uh,
it looks like they got hacked by 

629
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,780
somebody that somebody found an exploit,
took the money,

630
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,300
even though the money that was in cold 
storage somehow,

631
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:20,990
which was supposed to be impossible,
but I'm sure they weren't competent 

632
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:20,990
enough to have fucked up somewhere along
the way.

633
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,700
And now we're in the situation we're in 
now where people are panicked.

634
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:24,700
But,
uh,

635
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:29,750
the good news is that there are other 
exchanges out there that are much more 

636
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,400
credible backed by real companies.
And they're coming online.

637
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:34,890
There are a couple in the US,
they're coming online,

638
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:37,410
which was pretty cool because I want to 
see us be in on the action.

639
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:42,411
I don't want to see this be something 
that's just happening in Japan and so 

640
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:42,411
many places.
I'm sorry,

641
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:45,270
how did,
how did someone break in like how do you

642
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,950
get that money?
Like what do you,

643
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,200
what are you actually doing?
How are you getting that money?

644
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,400
Okay.
So yeah,

645
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:54,330
Bitcoin itself has not been hacked and 
as far as I know,

646
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:57,960
it's never been hacked.
Like the actual protocol is 100 percent.

647
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,390
I don't want to say perfect,
but if I send you money,

648
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:01,860
there's certainty that I've sent it to 
you.

649
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:07,370
And uh,
in this case they were using something 

650
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,190
called transaction malleability,
which I,

651
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,950
full disclosure,
don't fully understand this shit,

652
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,350
but pretty much what I think it is is 
like a,

653
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,670
if I write you a check,
you have to wait until that check clears

654
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:20,010
before you actually assume you have the 
money.

655
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,460
And in this case Mt.
Gox was assuming based on unconfirmed 

656
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,030
transactions that they had money or that
they were sending money.

657
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,930
And you apparently,
if you know anything about Bitcoin,

658
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,940
you can't do this.
And the other exchanges weren't doing 

659
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,580
it.
And so it'd be like if you got a million

660
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,230
dollar check,
it could totally be a rubber check.

661
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:39,150
You don't know until it's actually 
cleared.

662
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,370
You can't trade on that million dollars.
If bitcoin

663
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,720
really does become an emerging currency 
that the whole world adopts.

664
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,520
What a great movie this is going to be.
Oh,

665
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:53,521
it's going to be amazing.
The Gathering Dorks stumble upon this 

666
00:29:53,521 --> 00:29:53,920
billion dollar.
You just see them sitting around.

667
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:54,770
He,
um,

668
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,050
we're worth a billion dollars.
Wouldn't it be cool if we had,

669
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,430
if we had girls and money and then they 
switched over to bitcoin and seeing this

670
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:04,210
fat guy named Mark Karpeles is the CEO 
of Mt.

671
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:04,900
Gox.
Is this him?

672
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,170
That is him.
What a fucking Dork.

673
00:30:07,171 --> 00:30:09,520
He is.
Today's sorry buddy.

674
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,510
No,
I think that bitcoin is going.

675
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,080
He's hiding now.
They don't know his whereabouts.

676
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:16,390
So he's either hiding or probably being 
tortured somewhere.

677
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:18,460
Who the fuck knows?
Oh my God.

678
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,250
Three hundred $50.
Million dollars because of this guys.

679
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:23,620
Fuck up.
It's a big fuck up.

680
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,390
Oh my God,
that's a big fuck up.

681
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,980
Can you imagine how many people want to 
kill him?

682
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,150
That's real money to the $350,000,000
for folks that understand this.

683
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,020
This is not like people trading,
you know,

684
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,980
like fucking magic.
The gathering corns.

685
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,060
Yeah.
It's a liquid market.

686
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:42,061
You could buy $350,
million dollars worth of laptops if you 

687
00:30:42,061 --> 00:30:42,061
wanted to.
You could actually.

688
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,680
Tigerdirect is right,
but yeah,

689
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:49,681
and then also vegas casinos.
There's two casinos that are allowing 

690
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:49,681
bitcoin.
There's many.

691
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:54,230
There's many emerging companies or we're
up into this pretty much every day on it

692
00:30:54,431 --> 00:30:55,930
was even thinking about getting 
involved.

693
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:56,890
They should.
They should.

694
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,470
I don't know about that.
This.

695
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,620
Well.
This is just going to be a blip on the 

696
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:06,620
radar.
Oh,

697
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,620
I don't know how many blips this is.
Nonstop Bitcoin,

698
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:08,830
negative news.
I don't.

699
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,320
I think justice news alone is going to 
make people not like invest or do 

700
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,871
anything like maybe in the short term,
but I had the CEO of coin market on my 

701
00:31:18,871 --> 00:31:22,010
podcast the other day and he runs one of
the US exchanges.

702
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,000
They're actually based in Santa Monica 
and he didn't sound phased at all.

703
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:27,310
He told me this is a couple of hours 
before Mt.

704
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,720
Gox actually came out as being 
insolvent.

705
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:33,870
He told me on the podcast,
I think they're insolvent and I think 

706
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:33,870
they need to disappear as soon as 
possible.

707
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:37,000
Not Disappears and run away,
but just like disappear from the bitcoin

708
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:42,001
ecosystem so that more credible 
companies like us can step in and do 

709
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:46,291
this shit in a way that's legal and 
regulated and actually backed by real 

710
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:46,291
investors.

711
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:47,430
And uh,
he didn't sound concerned about.

712
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,070
He's kind of like,
well,

713
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:50,350
yeah,
this are shitty competition is going out

714
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:53,340
of business and now we can take over.
And uh,

715
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,900
I wish I knew enough to know whether or 
not he's correct.

716
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,280
That sounds very comforting if you're.
I think as long as people continue to 

717
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,790
watch porn and like pay web cam,
girls with bitcoins,

718
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,880
as long as people continue to like 
online gambling,

719
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:12,090
as long as you have libertarians who 
want to stash away some of their money 

720
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:12,520
in case there's some kind of financial 
apocalypse,

721
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:17,790
as long as you have those three things,
there's always going to be bitcoin 

722
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,370
demand.
That's a question.

723
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,400
You're not allowed to online gamble in 
the US with money.

724
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:23,050
Can you online gamble with bitcoin 
though?

725
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:28,260
I'm sure it's a highly gray area that 
that would be a way to get bitcoin 

726
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,460
rockin just tell people that they could 
gamble in bitcoin.

727
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,090
Well,
there are casinos in Vegas now that have

728
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:39,091
started accepting too,
but I think that online it'd be online.

729
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:40,190
It's prohibitive

730
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,220
because the online,
a lack of online gambling is what 

731
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,220
crushed the,
uh,

732
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,690
international pool league.
He had a,

733
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,330
uh,
this Kevin Trudeau,

734
00:32:48,331 --> 00:32:49,490
you know,
that scam artists,

735
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:54,491
that guy.
Those are the secrets that they don't 

736
00:32:54,491 --> 00:32:56,771
want you to know about,
which is why I'm putting it in a book 

737
00:32:56,771 --> 00:32:57,050
for everybody to fucking read weight 
loss secrets.

738
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:02,110
They don't want you to know about I just
people that are hiding information or 

739
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,360
that guy put together this huge multiple
million dollar professional pool league 

740
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:13,031
and he was going to market it based on 
the idea that you could gamble on the 

741
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:16,100
matches online and right when it was 
coming out,

742
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:21,130
right when the invested all the money,
they changed the laws and it was just a 

743
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:25,210
force out all the online gambling,
all the online casinos and online and 

744
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,030
all that.
[inaudible] dot com,

745
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:31,031
all those different places to have.
Those guys all got fucked dudes had to 

746
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:31,031
leave the country.

747
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:33,680
Like that bodog guy.
He had a boy dog fight.

748
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,870
There's an organization of fight 
organization.

749
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:37,310
He had to leave the company,
the country.

750
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,530
You can't come to America if it comes to
America,

751
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:42,320
they'll arrest them and it's just 
because of online gambling,

752
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:42,790
you know,
it's,

753
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:45,320
it's so gross.
It makes me so sick.

754
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:49,550
The idea that they can somehow another 
prevent people from gambling,

755
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,890
but you don't prevent them from gambling
in Vegas,

756
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:53,330
you know,
prevent them in Atlantic city.

757
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:54,920
You don't prevent them.
An Indian casinos,

758
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:59,750
you don't prefer them in car casinos,
just like they've decided arbitrarily to

759
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:03,360
keep people from doing it online because
it hurts those casinos or hurts,

760
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,540
whatever.
Whoever it is that it hurts,

761
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,230
they've decided to allow them to 
prohibit business.

762
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:14,380
They've allowed them to halt competition
and innovation because you're by 

763
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:19,690
eliminating online gambling,
you're not just eliminating online 

764
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,511
gambling,
you're eliminating a lot of different 

765
00:34:22,511 --> 00:34:22,511
financial transactions.

766
00:34:22,511 --> 00:34:25,490
You're eliminating a lot of wagering 
that is done through credit cards.

767
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,890
You're eliminating all sorts of 
different things.

768
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:29,600
You're.
You're stopping a business.

769
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,090
You're stopping buildings from being 
built.

770
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:35,630
You stopping people from being hired,
and it is freedom of expression.

771
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:40,631
If you're an adult and you're,
why shouldn't you be allowed to spend 

772
00:34:40,631 --> 00:34:40,631
your money on what you want?
Exactly.

773
00:34:40,631 --> 00:34:41,660
You're going to force these people to go
to Costa Rica.

774
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,390
You,
I mean you're.

775
00:34:42,391 --> 00:34:44,500
You're doing a lot of stupid shit.
You're,

776
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:49,501
you're really stopping business.
Everything from the construction of 

777
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:51,140
buildings with these people,
we're gonna use to the employees,

778
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:56,141
the,
the financial careers that people could 

779
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:56,141
have in online gambling,
running websites,

780
00:34:56,141 --> 00:35:01,061
legit businesses.
Whether you're providing a legit 

781
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:03,881
service,
but somehow or another this county 

782
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:03,881
government got away with stopping all 
that shit.

783
00:35:03,881 --> 00:35:04,820
It's,
it really makes me sick.

784
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,090
But um,
if you could use bitcoin,

785
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,490
if,
if they could,

786
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,370
if that's a legal loophole and you could
use bitcoin to gamble on things.

787
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,570
God Damn like sports.
If you could gamble on the fucking super

788
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:19,340
bowl,
a major league baseball,

789
00:35:19,341 --> 00:35:21,470
NBA,
UFC,

790
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,090
boxing,
golf.

791
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,180
If you could gamble on all that shit.
Yeah,

792
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:26,600
that'd be worth billions.
Fuck yeah.

793
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:31,601
It would be worth billions.
Not only would it be worth billions if 

794
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:32,210
people found out that you could actually
buy shit with this bitcoin.

795
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,600
They would start investing chunks of 
their portfolio in bitcoins and people 

796
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:37,600
would say,
hey,

797
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,310
you know,
I want percent of my finances

798
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:41,880
in bitcoin because I like to gamble.
I think the whole porn thing is going to

799
00:35:41,881 --> 00:35:46,881
be huge where a lot of guys want to know
where I want to tip the girls that they 

800
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:51,561
watch on the live cam sites,
but they don't because they don't want 

801
00:35:51,561 --> 00:35:54,651
their credit card linked to the site 
because then their wife will see it and 

802
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:54,810
it'd be a whole shitstorm meddling 
bitch,

803
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,940
but if they can just load up at the 
local seven,

804
00:35:56,941 --> 00:36:01,390
11 on $50 worth of Bitcoin,
have it transferred to their account and

805
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,780
then they do that.
Can you buy Bitcoin at 7:11?

806
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,350
Basically you can use a,
like various money services are you used

807
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:08,980
to be able to.
But uh,

808
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,670
that's where things are headed.
I think that we're getting.

809
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,650
Are Their ATM machines now coming 
online?

810
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:16,020
There was one in Boston that I saw a 
video of.

811
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,640
Yeah,
I've seen that as well.

812
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,820
That's interesting.
If they,

813
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,460
that would definitely open the door.
And for folks who don't know technology,

814
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm porn opens up the door to technology
all the time.

815
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,610
I mean when online video,
online statistics,

816
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:31,650
all that stuff came from adult stuff.
Well,

817
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:36,651
when apple cut flash out,
when apple stopped flash on the IPADS 

818
00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:39,270
and on their laptops and they um,
when,

819
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,420
when they're on their phones rather when
they did that.

820
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:46,170
The what is the other five htp?
No,

821
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:47,310
that's the,
that's a supplement.

822
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,850
Html five html,
http get new boots.

823
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:56,890
They put new mood and their computers.
But when they started using html five,

824
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,910
I mean all the,
the porn sites started adopting it.

825
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:05,030
I mean it was like almost instantaneous.
We used to not be able to watch porn on 

826
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,150
your iphone and then pop pow.
There it is.

827
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,490
There's just like,
these are human forces.

828
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:12,450
People need to watch porn.
People need to translate it.

829
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,860
David Seaman,
do they need it?

830
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,210
People need to transact.
Yeah,

831
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:16,410
they do need it.
Fuck yeah.

832
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:17,580
Look,
look at the Middle East.

833
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:22,581
I think half the issue with the Middle 
East is that guys are just not getting 

834
00:37:22,581 --> 00:37:25,401
off enough.
You should put like a thousand rubbing 

835
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:25,401
tugs in the Middle East and just see 
what happens.

836
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:25,650
There's definitely that.
And there's,

837
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,180
don't quote me on that,
but I wouldn't.

838
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,670
A postal address like Jabba the hut,
you know,

839
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,460
that's an issue to you.
You're covering them up.

840
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:35,310
No,
it's just so repressive and I understand

841
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:36,720
like you got to respect someone's 
culture,

842
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:41,721
but you also have to respect the fact 
that a lot of these people living in 

843
00:37:41,721 --> 00:37:41,880
these societies probably don't want to 
live that way.

844
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,750
That culture is a trap.
There's a problem with any suppressive.

845
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:50,070
Culture is a trap and you can't get out 
of that trap.

846
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,080
Especially if that trap is tied to 
religion.

847
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,370
If you're eliminating inflammation,
you're eliminating progress,

848
00:37:56,371 --> 00:37:59,190
you're eliminating people growing and 
you're doing another name of religion.

849
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,450
You know what,
man?

850
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,480
I really,
if I don't know what God wrote or what 

851
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,701
he didn't rope,
but I highly doubt if he's the way 

852
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:07,701
you're describing them,
this awesome,

853
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:10,650
amazing guy.
I highly doubt he gives a fuck what kind

854
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:13,350
of clothes you wear.
That's just me though.

855
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,450
I mean,
I'm not thinking for God or anything,

856
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:18,450
but I just highly doubt.
So what you're dealing with,

857
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,850
most likely,
I'm not saying definitely,

858
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:24,540
but most likely it's some bullshit 
written by people and it's poisoned.

859
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:29,541
Your culture absolutely poisoned the 
very foundations of your culture and 

860
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:32,280
won't allow any progress.
It will not allow new information.

861
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:34,560
It will not allow consideration of old 
ways.

862
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:35,950
The way

863
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,130
you live is perfect and it will not 
change.

864
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:44,190
You're going to be cotton camels heads 
off the fucking dull knives to the end 

865
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,070
of time,
and that's just what it is.

866
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,350
What what you're doing is how you're 
always gonna do it.

867
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:48,940
You're always going to say,
I'll walk by.

868
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,920
You're always going to fucking dressed 
that way.

869
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,040
You're always going to bow to the east.
All that same shit that you've been 

870
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,230
doing since the beginning of the 
millennia.

871
00:38:56,231 --> 00:38:58,630
You're going to continue to do that.
That's nonsense.

872
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,480
Well,
if you're labeling somebody you disagree

873
00:39:00,481 --> 00:39:05,481
with is an infidel or as not an infidel,
not a lot of room for reasonable 

874
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:06,780
discussion there.
You're like,

875
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:11,810
here's my point,
and then the other person's point is 

876
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:11,810
you're an infidel.
If we had a softball team,

877
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,590
we would call ourselves the infidels.
That'd be dope.

878
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,970
A good name for a strip club.

879
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,270
Yeah.
I have a gre podcast,

880
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,150
softball team,
costs of the Jerry infidel.

881
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,980
It wouldn't be a good neighbor.
Strip club.

882
00:39:23,981 --> 00:39:26,800
Make all the girls.
We'll veils belly dance

883
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:32,230
bad.
They wouldn't feel bad about seeing 

884
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:32,230
their face.
She couldn't see him and be like,

885
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:32,300
they're robbing a bank when they're 
showing you their pussy.

886
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,100
Yeah,
right.

887
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,480
That's a good idea.
Actually called the infidels and all 

888
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,251
girls wear veils.
It's not a bad move because a lot of 

889
00:39:42,251 --> 00:39:42,251
women,
you know,

890
00:39:42,251 --> 00:39:43,760
I'm thinking it would want to have 
anonymity.

891
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,980
We think so.
I think so.

892
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:51,130
I saw a,
a as soon as actress at a coffee shop 

893
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,350
near my place the other day and she was 
sitting at a table by herself and had on

894
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,010
like the big bug eyes,
sunglasses,

895
00:39:55,011 --> 00:39:56,780
like she's like a praying mantis pretty 
much.

896
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,020
And uh,
I just think people can't want that,

897
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,080
you know,
like maybe you want it five percent of 

898
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,851
the time.
But I think in that particular moment 

899
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:06,851
somebody would not want that.
Oh,

900
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:07,710
you mean that amount of attention?
Yeah.

901
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,670
Because if you're a woman in some of 
these Arab societies,

902
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,460
you can't just walk around like American
style.

903
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:18,820
Uh,
I think it was on one of your podcasts 

904
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,531
actually some guy was jerking off on a 
rooftop because he saw like a woman's 

905
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:21,800
Vale come down or something like they're
very sexually repressed.

906
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:26,801
So you can't even just dress normally in
a coffee shop without getting the same 

907
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,490
kind of attention that over here and a 
list actress would get.

908
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,830
Yeah,
that's true.

909
00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:30,610
Um,
well,

910
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,700
just the idea that you're supposed to 
cover your head,

911
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,690
right?
Always.

912
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,260
Always wear a veil like,

913
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,820
and it's unsanitary.
You think over time.

914
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,000
No,
not really.

915
00:40:41,001 --> 00:40:42,500
I mean,
didn't know more than wearing a baseball

916
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:43,190
hat.
Right?

917
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,270
That's on sanitary.

918
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,640
I just don't have your hair.
Everybody.

919
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,150
Everything.
Okay.

920
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:47,590
Under there,
it actually protects your hair.

921
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,420
There you go.
Fun in damaged,

922
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,550
damage your hair.
So it can,

923
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,140
we'll definitely damages your face.
Well,

924
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:55,540
all this bullshit that people worry 
about like the uh,

925
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,120
cell phone,
neuro tower weapons or whatever.

926
00:40:58,121 --> 00:40:59,960
And wait a minute,
hold on.

927
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:04,480
A people hanging out with people.
Tweet me some weird shit.

928
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:09,481
It's like the guys at radio shack can 
you got to stop fighting with people on 

929
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:09,481
twitter,
man,

930
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:13,450
you really do.
When people say stupid shit to just 

931
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:13,450
ignore it and block them,
please.

932
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:13,870
Yeah,
I've got to do that.

933
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,460
You get locked into it and then you're 
like,

934
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:18,510
I'm retiring from twitter.
I get locked into.

935
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,500
Like recently I was,
it was Sunday morning at 7:00

936
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,050
AM and my phone goes off and I'm like,
Oh,

937
00:41:23,051 --> 00:41:24,460
what is this?
And it's all caps,

938
00:41:24,461 --> 00:41:26,620
like hatred from some psycho and I'm 
just like,

939
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,650
take number one,
you know,

940
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,370
connect your fucking phone to your 
twitter.

941
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:34,000
I got to turn it off.
Of course you no still has

942
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,300
it that way.
Doug Benson,

943
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:40,540
ladies and gentlemen,
you want to fuck with Doug Benson right 

944
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:40,540
now?
Tweet the shit out of him.

945
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,350
Just fucking tweet them.
Constantly.

946
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,780
Tweet them all day because it's fallen.
We'll just.

947
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,820
It'll run out of batteries in 10 
minutes.

948
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:48,290
I'm like,
how long has your battery lasts?

949
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:50,300
Like 10 seconds.
I mean,

950
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:53,000
I assumed it was because my iphone is 
shitty batteries,

951
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:58,001
but allowing the world to text you 
essentially you're allowing the whole 

952
00:41:58,001 --> 00:41:58,001
world filled with assholes to text you.
Right?

953
00:41:58,001 --> 00:41:59,600
I got to turn that off.
You know what?

954
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:03,020
This is going to help me more than going
a infrared saunas and all the bullshit I

955
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:08,021
do to relax.
I'm just going to take twitter off my 

956
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:08,021
phone.
Yeah,

957
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:08,021
that.
Well,

958
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:09,330
you're dealing with too many people.
You know when you.

959
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,860
When you deal with that many people,
you can't have them at their discretion.

960
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,910
Get in touch with you,
right?

961
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:18,970
You have a certain amount of 
responsibility to try to connect with 

962
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,510
people online because it's what you do 
and it's what I do as well,

963
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,290
but you can't allow them to just do it 
at their discretionary time because it's

964
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,360
intrusive.
Your,

965
00:42:25,361 --> 00:42:28,970
your regular life is important.
Like you have to be able to have time to

966
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:30,410
reflect.
If you don't,

967
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:33,500
you'll never form your own opinions.
You're just be constantly inundated with

968
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:37,010
information and other people's activity.
You can't do that.

969
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,110
You can't allow that.
It's.

970
00:42:38,111 --> 00:42:43,111
It's a symptom of.
It's a symptom of the new world and you 

971
00:42:43,111 --> 00:42:47,111
know you are experiencing it in extreme 
form because you're sort of a public 

972
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:48,830
figure and you're a journalist and 
you're controversial.

973
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:53,850
Utah,
you cover a lot of very fascinating 

974
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:56,411
subjects,
so you're going to get a lot more than 

975
00:42:56,411 --> 00:42:56,411
the average person who has this set up 
like that.

976
00:42:56,411 --> 00:42:56,930
It's just too much,
man.

977
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,120
You can't do it that way.
That's very true.

978
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:00,980
Do that.
Starting today,

979
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,850
my phone would explode if I did that.
It would literally shake.

980
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It would just shake and just boom.
Sparks would fly out of it on your 

981
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,631
phone,
like froze up because of something 

982
00:43:13,631 --> 00:43:13,631
happened.
All these people text you and you're.

983
00:43:13,631 --> 00:43:17,710
I was just thinking that I was thinking 
like the twitter app probably can't 

984
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:20,861
handle that many things at once.
Just frees up a one time I accidentally 

985
00:43:20,861 --> 00:43:21,950
gave him my cell phone number out on 
twitter.

986
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:25,310
I was trying to send it to somebody in a
pm and I sent it.

987
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:30,700
I sent it to the whole world and my 
fucking phone literally just shut off 

988
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,160
and rebooted.
It was like,

989
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:33,140
this has got to be right.
I'm going to reboot myself.

990
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,510
I've rebooted itself.
Just was like,

991
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:37,190
fuck you,
and committed suicide.

992
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,620
So awesome.
It was just my.

993
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,910
My inbox filled up in five seconds and 
then the texts that were coming,

994
00:43:43,911 --> 00:43:47,540
there's just.
I tweeted something yesterday,

995
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:52,541
somebody sent me that.
I was talking about how I felt when my 

996
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:53,470
child was born that it was.
Oh,

997
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,060
I was thinking about how crazy it must 
be.

998
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,820
How many different babies being born 
right now?

999
00:43:58,821 --> 00:44:01,080
If you could see them all in real time 
in front of you,

1000
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,920
like on a giant screen.
It'd be like a baby invasion.

1001
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,710
I mean you don't think about it because 
in that hospital room,

1002
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:08,210
while that one's being born,
well,

1003
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:13,211
somebody sent me a tweet and that tweet 
is a link that shows in real time every 

1004
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:19,040
baby being born all around the world and
it is a fucking invasion.

1005
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,780
It's scary APP.
Yeah,

1006
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:22,940
it is like if Obama gave out his cell 
phone,

1007
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,410
it's like heaven.
It's just one baby baby,

1008
00:44:27,411 --> 00:44:28,010
baby,
baby,

1009
00:44:28,011 --> 00:44:28,970
baby,
Switzerland,

1010
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,380
Africa,
Indonesia,

1011
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:35,381
China,
and I know and that's just the reported 

1012
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:38,781
babies.
That's not the little tikes shit out in 

1013
00:44:38,781 --> 00:44:38,781
the bottom of a fucking grass hut in the
middle of the jungle.

1014
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,130
They didn't count those.
They only counted the ones.

1015
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:43,050
The ones that are in the census.
Yeah,

1016
00:44:43,051 --> 00:44:45,570
I mean,
do you see Brian find the link?

1017
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,530
Was it yesterday?
Yeah,

1018
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:48,610
it was A.
I quoted it as a.

1019
00:44:48,611 --> 00:44:51,570
As a retweet.
Instead of a retweet.

1020
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:52,260
I quoted it.

1021
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:53,060
Oh,
here we go.

1022
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,710
It's crazy.
It's so nuts.

1023
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:01,980
You go to it and it's.
What is the website for folks who want 

1024
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:01,980
to get to it?

1025
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,820
Yeah.
Google.

1026
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,450
Dr.
Com.

1027
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,800
No.
What does it say?

1028
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:08,950
A bunch of Google drive.com.
Sounds legit.

1029
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,430
We'll look at that.
Those are the babies.

1030
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:13,930
See those babies on both sides.

1031
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,100
Holy Shit.
That is scary.

1032
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,510
Isn't that incredible?
Yeah.

1033
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,570
Those are all babies.

1034
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:24,090
It's going to be deaths going about.

1035
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,810
I don't see a lot of us second.
Not a lot of us births.

1036
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,540
How is that only google?
Dr.

1037
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:30,830
Com.
That's all it is.

1038
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,280
Why?
It's good.

1039
00:45:31,281 --> 00:45:31,670
Good.
Dr.

1040
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:33,320
Com,
black sides host.

1041
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,320
Oh,
a bunch of other shit.

1042
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:38,090
So the stuff that we can't see,
that's all like real blurry.

1043
00:45:38,091 --> 00:45:38,840
That's the other stuff.

1044
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:43,890
Do you think this is what the NSA sees?
They see like every new human being 

1045
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:43,890
coming online?

1046
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:43,910
Yeah.
The NSA is,

1047
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:47,060
they're paying attention 24 hours a day 
to every one of these babies.

1048
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:48,740
Make sure they're not fucking doing 
anything illegal.

1049
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,970
So get all these babies is crazy.
There's a fucking.

1050
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:56,330
And I feel like we're going to run out 
of oxygen or something.

1051
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:01,390
It's terrifying man.
And I don't see a lot of American flags 

1052
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:01,390
either.
Man.

1053
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:05,620
I see a lot of those other countries,
a lot of the red Chinese flag that 

1054
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:09,430
bothers me as an American.
I think we need to do our job and do 

1055
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,730
some more fucking.
Most of the deaths.

1056
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,490
China is number one.
Most birth India.

1057
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,230
Look at that.
It just stopped.

1058
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,420
What if freaked out?
No.

1059
00:46:17,421 --> 00:46:19,530
But your computer crash?
No.

1060
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:23,780
Well what if they just stopped having 
babies?

1061
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:29,070
What is one day?
We went on that thing and it was a day 

1062
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:29,390
where there was no babies.
That movie with,

1063
00:46:29,391 --> 00:46:30,710
uh,
with Clive Owen.

1064
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,120
Children of men?
Yeah.

1065
00:46:32,121 --> 00:46:34,520
When people stopped being fertile or 
something stupid,

1066
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,290
you know,
well that is the,

1067
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:39,290
um,
the people that are not dooming gloomers

1068
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:43,700
about overpopulation,
their idea is that as time goes on,

1069
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:48,701
what's going to happen is the cultures,
like third world cultures that are like 

1070
00:46:48,701 --> 00:46:51,980
really into having a massive amounts of 
child children,

1071
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,130
childbirths,
those are going to become more developed

1072
00:46:55,131 --> 00:47:00,131
and as they become more developed,
we're actually gonna have a decrease in 

1073
00:47:00,131 --> 00:47:00,440
population.
That's the non doom and gloomers.

1074
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,140
They obviously don't have this website 
on bookmark.

1075
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:08,260
If they did,
they would see the fucking invasion in 

1076
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:08,420
real time see it happening.
Oh my God,

1077
00:47:08,421 --> 00:47:10,220
how,
how we're going to have enough oil.

1078
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:15,350
Well,
there's a theory that the more people 

1079
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:16,911
you have in an area,
the more kind of like intelligent 

1080
00:47:16,911 --> 00:47:19,140
productivity you have.
So higher population doesn't lead to the

1081
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:24,160
Malthusian meltdown where people starve 
and kill each other to get back into a 

1082
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:27,060
lower population realm.
Instead.

1083
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,980
It's the high population itself.
That's what is leading

1084
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,980
to innovation.
And somewhere along that innovation can 

1085
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,340
keep up with the higher population.
That makes sense.

1086
00:47:36,341 --> 00:47:41,341
Yeah.
So it's basically you look at humans 

1087
00:47:41,341 --> 00:47:41,350
like kind of like a network capacity.
It makes sense.

1088
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,930
What,
what concerns me most?

1089
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,700
Those are just the actual natural 
physical resources.

1090
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:46,830
Oh yeah.
I watched him.

1091
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:49,600
Pollution and pollution.
I watched that movie.

1092
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:52,030
Jiro dreams of Sushi.
That's a great.

1093
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,240
I've talked about that movie like 30 
times.

1094
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,990
I'm obsessed with it.
Really interesting.

1095
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,250
Weird.
You know.

1096
00:47:57,251 --> 00:47:59,470
First of all I learned two things.
One,

1097
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,710
I would never want to be a fucking Sushi
chef because they work too hard.

1098
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,510
Those fucking people work hard,
man.

1099
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,760
The apprentices who are,
they stay apprentice.

1100
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:08,080
So they're like 50 years old.
Yeah.

1101
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:13,170
How about the fact that the guy worked 
on making eggs for like 10 years before 

1102
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,530
he got it right.
And then when the guy told him he did it

1103
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:15,400
right,
you start crying.

1104
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,150
What?
You cooked an egg,

1105
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:21,040
right.
That's why that movie is so beautiful,

1106
00:48:21,041 --> 00:48:26,041
you know,
because we will be sick of that shit 

1107
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:26,041
after 15 minutes.
This guy has a 10 seat room.

1108
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:31,020
It's a 10 seat room in the Tokyo subway 
station that's booked out for months are

1109
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,880
booked out from us and it's the best 
Sushi in the world apparently.

1110
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,470
And the guy,
I mean his,

1111
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:40,650
his son's 50 years old and his son goes 
to the fish market every day and buys 

1112
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:45,751
from the same guy who's like literally 
got a flashlight on the tuna and 

1113
00:48:45,751 --> 00:48:47,300
touching it with his fingers and he has 
to make sure it's,

1114
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:52,380
he has a feel for the texture,
the texture will directly contribute or 

1115
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:56,820
directly correlate with great flavor.
Like he knows what textures the right 

1116
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:01,081
one.
Then they know like how to age the tuna 

1117
00:49:01,081 --> 00:49:03,490
and you know how long for an old tuna,
how long for a young tuna.

1118
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,760
Fucking crazy shit man is a true art 
artisans.

1119
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,830
When you imagine if we had that in the 
US,

1120
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,220
like at every level of our society,
somebody putting out a new APP,

1121
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:17,460
like the new facebook APP is like,
I'm not sure if this is perfected yet 

1122
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:18,160
and they just study it for the next six 
months before they release it.

1123
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,450
Yeah.
No shit man.

1124
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,690
And I mean there's no money to be made 
and what this guy is doing either,

1125
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:24,640
I mean there's enough money to keep 
afloat,

1126
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:29,620
I'm sure,
but he's got a 10 seat fucking place and

1127
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:34,510
these people talk about his Sushi,
like you know,

1128
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:39,511
restaurant tours and restaurant critics.
And they say they get nervous when they 

1129
00:49:39,511 --> 00:49:40,930
go there.
They get nervous when they meet him.

1130
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,260
The guy takes the same fucking subway 
everyday,

1131
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:46,150
sits in the same seat,
Exxon at the same stop.

1132
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,480
He's 85 fucking years old and he's been 
working every day since he was like 

1133
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:51,480
fucking 20.

1134
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:53,940
Look at what an old boss as though if he
comes back up there.

1135
00:49:53,941 --> 00:49:54,590
Yes.
Yeah,

1136
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,150
no,
that's his son.

1137
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,910
His son's 50 like everything about the 
way they cook.

1138
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,790
The place is fucking amazing and made me
want to fly to Japan.

1139
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,790
Maybe want a book.
I bet you can't even book online,

1140
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:10,420
but you've got to go there in person and
get your reservations.

1141
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:13,300
But it made me want to try this Sushi 
and finding what the fuck is all about.

1142
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:18,330
He probably gives you like a riddle,
like a Zen Koan that you have to solve 

1143
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:18,330
and if you solve it,
he's like,

1144
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:19,320
okay,
three months from now launch,

1145
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:24,510
we're on,
and if I was going to do what I would 

1146
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:26,020
want to do it quick before that whole 
place is nuclear war Godzilla shows up.

1147
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:28,220
It was,
this shit

1148
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,000
is pretty,
uh,

1149
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:31,070
unsettling.
Very unsettling.

1150
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,560
But you know,
there was a sign

1151
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:37,580
just that went there and was catching 
fish from right off the shore and they 

1152
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:41,491
tested 50 tests a flounder I think.
What's the other word for a flounder?

1153
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:47,860
Good grounds.
Old men have been the sole ground fish 

1154
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,170
flatfish one of those flat fish.
But the point is those,

1155
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:49,050
those fisher,
the,

1156
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,300
they stay in that area,
they're not migratory.

1157
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,830
And it was,
you could eat.

1158
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,200
It was fun.
Yeah,

1159
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:57,540
it was fine to eat.
So what he's saying is that the ocean is

1160
00:50:57,541 --> 00:51:02,100
so fucking enormous that it's not really
having the same effect that people think

1161
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:03,090
it has.
Yeah,

1162
00:51:03,091 --> 00:51:05,760
it is scary stuff.
The water leak is very scary.

1163
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:09,380
It's still dangerous.
Dissipates out enough that the ocean.

1164
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:14,590
Yeah,
the ocean is so goddamn big that right 

1165
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:17,691
now it's okay,
but the real issue is not just 

1166
00:51:17,691 --> 00:51:18,570
Fukushima,
it's these nuclear plants in general.

1167
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,310
I try to make it relative.

1168
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:25,310
Someone like I had a conversation with a
friend who is a very pro business and 

1169
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:26,960
very pro,
you know,

1170
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:32,010
nuclear power and the benefits of 
nuclear power and he's talking about 

1171
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,510
these few places where the issues have 
arisen and I said,

1172
00:51:33,511 --> 00:51:34,200
well,
okay,

1173
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,770
I just want you to think about the 
amount of time that nuclear power's been

1174
00:51:37,771 --> 00:51:38,730
here.
Okay.

1175
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,810
Now think about the amount of nuclear 
power plants that exist now.

1176
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:47,811
Think about how many of the men have had
catastrophic failures only to write only

1177
00:51:48,451 --> 00:51:49,170
to.
You're right,

1178
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:54,470
but those two,
those places are fa hucked forever.

1179
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:58,410
There's two and it's less than 100 years
of nuclear power.

1180
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:03,030
How long do you think people bit around 
what if people around another 20,000

1181
00:52:03,031 --> 00:52:08,031
years stop and think about how many of 
those nuclear power plants are gonna 

1182
00:52:08,031 --> 00:52:09,780
fuck,
fuck everything around them.

1183
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:13,020
There's two places right now,
Chernobyl and this place,

1184
00:52:13,021 --> 00:52:16,170
and then there's a three mile island or 
four mile island or whatever the fuck it

1185
00:52:16,171 --> 00:52:18,030
is.
That place is kind of fucked,

1186
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,410
but not quite as fucked.

1187
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,330
I don't think we know enough about it.
I think that we're too.

1188
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:27,580
It's too new for us and we don't have 
the the timetable that you would need to

1189
00:52:27,581 --> 00:52:28,470
do it properly.
Sure.

1190
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,610
You're absolutely like our lifespans are
just too short.

1191
00:52:30,611 --> 00:52:35,611
We're like fucking fruit flies working 
with this technology that has 

1192
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:39,121
ramifications.
That will be around for thousands of 

1193
00:52:39,121 --> 00:52:41,760
years.
Why don't our lifespan is nothing 

1194
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:41,760
compared to the lifespan of any kind of 
leak will.

1195
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:46,141
Also we.
We grew up in a time where these things 

1196
00:52:46,141 --> 00:52:49,321
that already existed and we didn't have 
any say in their construction and so 

1197
00:52:49,321 --> 00:52:52,771
they were manufactured by people kind of
assumed there may have been around all 

1198
00:52:52,771 --> 00:52:57,420
that.
Technology's probably oldest fuck by 

1199
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:57,420
now.
It is old as fuck.

1200
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,160
The one in Fukushima is old as fuck.
It's outdated technology,

1201
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:01,790
but they kind of assumed upon 
construction that with innovation,

1202
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:06,791
with progress in the future,
there's going to be able to be a way to 

1203
00:53:06,791 --> 00:53:07,130
correct all these issues.
Well,

1204
00:53:07,131 --> 00:53:08,810
there's not.
There's still isn't.

1205
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:12,000
At least with coal power plants,
even though those are messy too,

1206
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:17,690
it's only fucking up the present.
It's not like you're leaving this thing 

1207
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:18,340
that for thousands of years is going to 
be a,

1208
00:53:18,341 --> 00:53:23,341
you know,
making children have birth defects and 

1209
00:53:23,341 --> 00:53:23,341
stuff.
It's like,

1210
00:53:23,341 --> 00:53:26,270
you know,
it's messy when it's drawn out of the 

1211
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:26,270
earth.
It's probably not good for the at all,

1212
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:31,340
but it's temporary.
It's not something that's destroying 

1213
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:31,340
areas for long time.

1214
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:31,990
Yeah,
it's interesting.

1215
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:37,020
It's like you,
you look at what people are willing to 

1216
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,590
accept and not willing to accept just in
the name of,

1217
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,290
you know,
having fuel just to the name of progress

1218
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:45,570
just in the name of financial reward and
it's,

1219
00:53:45,571 --> 00:53:49,660
it's kind of scary how flippant people 
are about polluting the ocean,

1220
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:54,930
about polluting the BP oil spill.
You had Peter Schiff on and we were 

1221
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,280
talking about the BP thing and you know,
he was talking about.

1222
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,590
Yeah,
I listened to that one.

1223
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,800
He,
he kind of gets under my skin because a 

1224
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,370
lot of the limited government stuff I 
can latch onto and agree with,

1225
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,250
but then there's something,
I don't know how to describe it.

1226
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:11,040
It's like there's not a certain humanism
there that you need to have.

1227
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:16,280
Yes,
like everything doesn't have to be in 

1228
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:16,280
your framework of the free market 
principle.

1229
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,330
That's great for a lot of Shit.
If you want to get the best water or the

1230
00:54:18,331 --> 00:54:23,331
best soda or the best weed,
it's probably a good idea to get free 

1231
00:54:23,331 --> 00:54:24,570
markets working there.
So you have competition.

1232
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:27,450
It doesn't have to be for every single 
facet of life.

1233
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:30,770
Well the real issue with him is 
environmental.

1234
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,790
That's the real issue.
His willingness to,

1235
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:34,790
you know,
the fracking thing like his,

1236
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:37,880
his concerned about fracking was so it 
was,

1237
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:40,080
it was,
it was really funny.

1238
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:44,100
Like talking to them about people that 
have had their land is destroyed forever

1239
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,930
and he was saying,
well they got millions of dollars.

1240
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:51,140
Most people,
they got money that would've never been 

1241
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:51,140
able to get.
They got hush money,

1242
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,370
but it's still,
their land is fucked like that.

1243
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,710
The money is all.
It's all relative.

1244
00:54:55,711 --> 00:54:57,660
Like what's a million dollars to Peter 
Schiff?

1245
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:00,270
It's probably not nearly as much as it 
is to those people.

1246
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,010
So for,
for Peter Schiff,

1247
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,230
a million dollars or whatever the fuck 
these people,

1248
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:08,990
that's worth it to destroy a piece of 
property essentially for as long as

1249
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,480
people wasn't around.
What was weird about that too is I think

1250
00:55:11,481 --> 00:55:14,990
you asked him about the environmental 
impact and he said there's nothing wrong

1251
00:55:14,991 --> 00:55:16,370
with fracking.
There's no environment.

1252
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:18,980
The environmental impact,
and we know that's not true.

1253
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:20,690
Like just google it.
It's all over the place.

1254
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,170
It's not true at all.
There's over a thousand documented wells

1255
00:55:24,171 --> 00:55:25,980
that have been polluted from fracking.
Yeah.

1256
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:31,190
You know,
the idea is that if fracturing works 

1257
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:33,641
exactly according to plan,
it's so deep in the ground that you're 

1258
00:55:33,641 --> 00:55:35,960
not going to disturb wells,
but it doesn't work according to plan.

1259
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,640
It's a crazy business.
What'd you do?

1260
00:55:37,641 --> 00:55:39,410
You're pumping water into the center of 
the earth.

1261
00:55:39,411 --> 00:55:41,210
You're creating earthquakes.
You know,

1262
00:55:41,211 --> 00:55:46,211
and I've had a lot of people google me,
like you need to get up to date with 

1263
00:55:46,211 --> 00:55:46,280
your research,
like really right wingey type people who

1264
00:55:46,281 --> 00:55:48,680
are pro business,
who by the way almost always financially

1265
00:55:48,681 --> 00:55:52,160
struggling but,
or clearing the way for the one day when

1266
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:55,380
in the future they have money,
they're going to go out,

1267
00:55:55,381 --> 00:55:56,150
you know,
they're gonna,

1268
00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:01,180
they're gonna need the regulations to be
kind of light because they want to make 

1269
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:01,180
some money in this,
this economy.

1270
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:02,890
Well,
all these people,

1271
00:56:02,891 --> 00:56:06,200
like I would send them to all these 
websites and then they would just vanish

1272
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,810
like you can't say anything,
so I'll just send you,

1273
00:56:08,811 --> 00:56:13,811
I'll send you all the links.
I'll send you the fucking one of the 

1274
00:56:13,811 --> 00:56:15,860
ceos of exon petitioning to not have 
fracking on his property.

1275
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,120
One of the richest.

1276
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:22,300
No,
fracking is short for hydraulic 

1277
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,731
fracturing.
It doesn't sound like something that's 

1278
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:24,731
good for the earth.

1279
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:24,731
Yeah.
Exxon CEO

1280
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:26,620
is hilarious.
So he doesn't want it near his property.

1281
00:56:26,621 --> 00:56:28,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

1282
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:33,211
He doesn't want fracking.
He thinks it's going to fuck with his 

1283
00:56:33,211 --> 00:56:34,000
property values of.
Yeah,

1284
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:34,950
it does,
Dude.

1285
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:37,960
Yeah.
Exxon CEO doesn't want fracking facility

1286
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:40,660
near his US home.
He files a lawsuit.

1287
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,210
You fucking dirty,
man.

1288
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:45,880
You're a dirty man.
Rex Tillerson,

1289
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,600
he is that his name?
Rex tillerson sounds like a dinosaur.

1290
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:52,300
It sounds like an industrialist for like
the 18 hundreds.

1291
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,240
So scary.
You ever seen there will be blood.

1292
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,350
Yes.
Yeah.

1293
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:58,240
It sounds like one of those guys.
Exactly.

1294
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,210
Yeah.
This is a.

1295
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,760
Oh,
this is not an anti fracking lawsuit and

1296
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,710
experts said nothing.
Could be further from the truth.

1297
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:10,950
Yes.
A lot of things could be further from 

1298
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:10,950
the truth.
It could be that a quarter is actually a

1299
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,000
Gremlin.
Who Lives on the moon and likes to suck.

1300
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:13,750
Baby.
Dick's.

1301
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,490
Okay.
That's further from the truth.

1302
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:19,000
You fucking dummy.
Nothing could be further from the truth.

1303
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,950
Oh,
the earth is really a Frisbee.

1304
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:23,590
Is that further from the truth?
You fucking cunt.

1305
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:29,010
You shitbag lawyer said they will not be
a sponsor of your podcast anytime soon.

1306
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:34,070
They can all fuck themselves.
Citizens of Bartonville described as a 

1307
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:39,001
wealthy community,
which you'd expect that giving the 

1308
00:57:39,001 --> 00:57:42,301
houses of the chief of Enron have sued 
to stop the tower.

1309
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:46,870
The tower is being built by cross 
timbers water supply.

1310
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:52,250
It would be a 15 story building adjacent
to Tillerson's 83 acre horse ranch,

1311
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:58,950
not far from an 18 acre homestead among 
the others who opposed the project or 

1312
00:57:59,591 --> 00:58:04,450
people not exactly known for their 
environmental concerns form a US House.

1313
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:07,150
Majority leader,
tick amny and his wife,

1314
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:12,210
for example,
all these fucking rich country they're 

1315
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:12,210
putting in their neighborhood and they 
don't want it.

1316
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:12,340
Oh,
you guys are fine.

1317
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:13,930
When it was in Baltimore,
all right.

1318
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:18,931
You guys were fine when it was in the 
middle of Pennsylvania shitting into a 

1319
00:58:18,931 --> 00:58:20,950
river that people like to fish in.
Fuck all you.

1320
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:25,060
Fuck all you fucking criminals.
You shitty environmental criminals.

1321
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:28,510
You guys are ruining the earth.
This is not a way to do it.

1322
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:33,660
You can't just pump water and chemicals 
into the ground because we know that 

1323
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,170
there's gas and oil there.
That's county shit.

1324
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:40,670
This is a terrible idea.
Well then we extract the water 

1325
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:41,140
afterwards,
Brian dunning sales.

1326
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,240
No worries.
Afterwards,

1327
00:58:43,241 --> 00:58:46,810
we simply extract the water you ever 
heard his video on.

1328
00:58:46,811 --> 00:58:51,010
It even takes on it and affected accent 
like an what hosts.

1329
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,550
There's some no worries,
like peaceful accept.

1330
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:55,600
Talk like a fool,
like,

1331
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:57,490
oh,
don't worry.

1332
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:59,890
Why?
Hydraulic fracturing.

1333
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,470
That's literally what he sounds like 
when he talks about it,

1334
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,270
explaining how simple it is.

1335
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:09,420
Oh,
it's only poisoned to thousand wells so 

1336
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,000
far.
It's only been around for a few decades.

1337
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:15,120
Don't worry.
What's a thousand places that are 

1338
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:15,120
poisoned forever.
No worry.

1339
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:19,570
I think we're predisposed to listen to 
people who sound reasonable.

1340
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:24,630
Yeah,
reasonable and what happened saying 

1341
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:24,630
David,
seaman,

1342
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:28,361
let's be reasonable.
Hydraulic fracturing is very safe and 

1343
00:59:28,361 --> 00:59:29,660
should ask for it in your community 
today,

1344
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:35,100
forward in your own home.
Hydraulically fracture your own gas from

1345
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:40,301
the ground below you.
That's like the reverse mortgage guy 

1346
00:59:40,301 --> 00:59:42,290
that's on at nights and convincing old 
people who a cash in their home equity,

1347
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:43,790
you know,
like it's a good way to.

1348
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:46,070
It shows him in front of a sports car 
and it's like,

1349
00:59:46,071 --> 00:59:51,071
yeah,
you get a sports car but you also lose 

1350
00:59:51,071 --> 00:59:51,071
the fucking equity to your house.
I'm like,

1351
00:59:51,071 --> 00:59:51,680
dude,
no longer own the house you live in,

1352
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:56,980
but at least that is just financial 
money comes and goes and is there.

1353
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,310
You're not poisoning the fucking very 
water that people can drink.

1354
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:06,610
You're not changing the water like 
people used to be able to use that to 

1355
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,360
fertilize crops,
to feed their animals,

1356
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,160
to drink.
Now they drink it.

1357
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,680
They get like neuro toxins.
They get like anybody's in nerves.

1358
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:17,810
Stop working.
Anybody who thinks that's totally okay.

1359
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,480
I would recommend the prescription of 
Yoga,

1360
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,450
meditation,
weed,

1361
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,560
Brownies,
as long as permissible by law.

1362
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:29,650
All those things would all three of 
those things would be the Trifecta of 

1363
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:32,890
not being a dick anymore.
The weed brownies or the most 

1364
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:34,931
introspective in like if you want to 
think about a drug that makes you 

1365
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:35,750
consider everything that you're doing 
wrong,

1366
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:40,780
God damn those things get to the heart 
of it helps me see like the other 

1367
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:43,400
person's perspective and then even if I 
want to go ahead with what I'm doing,

1368
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:45,770
at least I've seen it from their point 
of view,

1369
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:47,840
so it's not coming from a place of 
ignorance coming from,

1370
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:48,860
Oh,
I see both sides,

1371
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:49,790
now I can do what I want.

1372
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:55,180
Whereas before,
you're just the person who doesn't see 

1373
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:55,730
how the world is perceiving it and it's 
kind of scary.

1374
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:57,650
It's scary to me that I went that long 
without,

1375
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,480
uh,
using that stuff.

1376
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:00,500
Well,
it's the,

1377
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:05,501
the reason for a lot of the people that 
have these negative opinions on 

1378
01:01:05,811 --> 01:01:10,811
marijuana brownies or cookies is that 
most of the times that they're used 

1379
01:01:10,811 --> 01:01:14,231
recreationally,
most of the Times people are using them 

1380
01:01:14,231 --> 01:01:14,231
just sort of have fun with or they're 
fucked up.

1381
01:01:14,231 --> 01:01:18,850
They're already drunk and then they 
associate being hung over and like 

1382
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:20,150
making bad decisions with the marijuana 
has nothing to do with that.

1383
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:21,980
What people think of it as more of a 
party thing,

1384
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:26,390
which you kind of can be mean and it is 
fun to get high and watch star wars with

1385
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:27,590
your buddies.
It is,

1386
01:01:27,591 --> 01:01:28,720
it's fun.
You know,

1387
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,830
if you have a bunch of people over the 
house and he'd go,

1388
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:32,480
let's eat pot brownies and watch star 
wars.

1389
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,010
Fuck yeah.
You know,

1390
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:39,011
it's fun.
It's also fun to watch star trek by 

1391
01:01:39,011 --> 01:01:40,520
yourself like every day on that.
But it also.

1392
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:45,570
But besides being fun,
it most certainly can be a tool for 

1393
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:47,090
psychological expert exploration.
You really can,

1394
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:51,470
you can explore some areas of your 
consciousness that maybe you didn't know

1395
01:01:51,471 --> 01:01:56,471
were really troubling you,
and then all of a sudden they get 

1396
01:01:56,471 --> 01:01:58,540
dragged into the forefront and some 
spotlights get turned on them and you 

1397
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:01,991
didn't even know that you had some sort 
of a subliminal or subconscious hiding 

1398
01:02:02,031 --> 01:02:03,760
of these ideas.
Yeah.

1399
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:09,100
I'm not a scientist at all,
but I really believe that stuff like 

1400
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,531
that has evolved alongside us.
And that's part of the reason why it's 

1401
01:02:11,531 --> 01:02:12,980
not harmful.
Why nobody ever ods on marijuana is that

1402
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:16,580
we've had time to adapt to it and it's 
adapted to us and we have this symbiotic

1403
01:02:16,581 --> 01:02:20,490
relationship where it's making us a more
introspective

1404
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,880
and we're able to innovate as a result.
And because of that,

1405
01:02:23,881 --> 01:02:28,881
we tend to grow more marijuana,
which keeps it alive and keeps it 

1406
01:02:28,881 --> 01:02:28,881
thriving.
So it's like this,

1407
01:02:28,881 --> 01:02:30,870
uh,
this thing like a coral reef almost.

1408
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:33,180
And then we come along with modern 
society.

1409
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,330
We make all this shit illegal just for 
the sake of it.

1410
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:41,690
And we do away with things that people 
have had is basic tools for most of 

1411
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:45,171
human history.
You think about it like this shit is 

1412
01:02:45,171 --> 01:02:45,171
only been illegal for what?
Like 70 years?

1413
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:47,250
Yeah.
The main thing you're dead on.

1414
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:50,550
I think that's exactly what's going on 
and I think it's changing.

1415
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,700
I don't think you can stop the change 
that's currently underway.

1416
01:02:53,701 --> 01:02:58,701
I think what Colorado did and what 
Seattle or Washington state did that 

1417
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,050
those decisions were made by people 
they.

1418
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,200
And then you see that not only is the 
sky's not falling,

1419
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:07,710
but those people are making a lot of 
money and then then it just opens up and

1420
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:12,711
now that the banks are going to be 
allowed to take the money from the 

1421
01:03:12,711 --> 01:03:13,140
Colorado dispensary's,
what do they call them?

1422
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:14,960
It's legal.
It's not a dispenser.

1423
01:03:14,961 --> 01:03:16,590
If it's legal,
is it a pot store

1424
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:20,140
dispensary?
If caregiver shit,

1425
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:23,170
maybe not your share giver because it's 
not medical,

1426
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:26,250
it's just the store.
Then Rato was just selling weed.

1427
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,670
They just gave up on the whole medical 
thing and they're like,

1428
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:31,080
yeah,
we're just selling weed.

1429
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:33,570
Come on in Seattle still hanging back.
They're like,

1430
01:03:33,571 --> 01:03:34,890
oh,
well what are you guys doing?

1431
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,360
I think they'll see that people are not 
going to go crazy and it's going to help

1432
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:44,361
the local economy a lot and then other 
states who want to adopt some form of 

1433
01:03:44,361 --> 01:03:44,361
that.
Yeah.

1434
01:03:44,361 --> 01:03:47,370
Colorado is like the crazy friend that 
eats the mushrooms first car.

1435
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:48,750
I was like,
you guys share that.

1436
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:50,670
That's not a much of a kill you.
I'll fucking eat it,

1437
01:03:50,671 --> 01:03:55,671
man.
Colorado's like your crazy friend who's 

1438
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:56,670
like real skinny but never gets sick and
he's got a cowboy hat on and he's like,

1439
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:58,290
I'll eat that fucking Brownie Brown.

1440
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:01,530
So Colorado just goes,
hey man,

1441
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:04,080
we'll just fucking start selling it and 
we'll see what's up.

1442
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:09,380
And so all these people have started 
these huge businesses and within the 

1443
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:12,060
first day,
within the first seven hours they'd made

1444
01:04:12,061 --> 01:04:14,090
millions of dollars.
I mean the,

1445
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:17,340
the amount of money that's being there,
this tourism,

1446
01:04:17,341 --> 01:04:20,310
like people are driving from Wyoming to 
go to Colorado.

1447
01:04:20,311 --> 01:04:22,560
So they combined the cuts.
It cuts down on crime.

1448
01:04:22,561 --> 01:04:27,561
I have a friend who actually is a 
manager at one of the dispensary is out 

1449
01:04:27,561 --> 01:04:31,131
there in Denver and she was telling me 
when one of their dispensary's moves 

1450
01:04:31,131 --> 01:04:35,421
into a neighborhood,
all the people stopped going to their 

1451
01:04:35,421 --> 01:04:37,560
dealer and they just come into the store
and that's their new place obviously,

1452
01:04:37,561 --> 01:04:39,240
because they want to do something that's
less risky.

1453
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:41,640
Yeah,
you've just fucked all those dealers out

1454
01:04:41,641 --> 01:04:44,070
of their money like that's done.
Now it's being taxed now.

1455
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:49,071
It's being regulated.
It's helping people because people are 

1456
01:04:49,071 --> 01:04:51,891
being paid jobs that actually pay well 
instead of just one drug dealer taking 

1457
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:52,570
all the money and it's interesting for 
their own.

1458
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:54,250
They can grow their own as well.

1459
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:55,310
Well,
you know,

1460
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:00,320
that's another beautiful thing about it.
You don't have to worry about the cops 

1461
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,991
coming to your house and breaking in 
your front door because you got a plant 

1462
01:05:02,991 --> 01:05:06,051
somewhere in your closet.
You don't have to worry about that 

1463
01:05:06,051 --> 01:05:06,051
anymore.
It's okay.

1464
01:05:06,051 --> 01:05:09,910
It's legal.
I really liked the balance that La is 

1465
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:11,430
struck where there are dispensaries you 
can buy from and you see the green,

1466
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,100
whatever it is.
Yeah.

1467
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:15,480
The plus sign,
but it's not in your face,

1468
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:20,510
so if you're somebody who doesn't like 
or it makes you paranoid when you do it 

1469
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:20,510
or you just have a conservative 
upbringing,

1470
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,780
it's not something where you're 
constantly confronted by it.

1471
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,940
I think that's cool.
It's like if you want it,

1472
01:05:24,941 --> 01:05:26,560
it's very easy to get.
If you don't.

1473
01:05:26,561 --> 01:05:28,090
It doesn't have to be a part of your 
life.

1474
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:29,150
That's the way it should

1475
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,760
like it in their neighborhood.
I think.

1476
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:32,560
I thought it was really kind of 
hilarious.

1477
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:37,561
I was driving down the street with a 
friend of mine and it was in his 

1478
01:05:37,561 --> 01:05:38,800
neighborhood and there's like the green 
plus signs and he's like,

1479
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:43,801
you know,
these fucking things are all over my 

1480
01:05:43,801 --> 01:05:43,801
neighborhood and I'm like soon as the 
liquor store.

1481
01:05:43,801 --> 01:05:44,920
Stupid is the liquor store right there 
by the way,

1482
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:46,480
you smoke pot.
What are you talking about?

1483
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:47,450
And no,
nobody.

1484
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,910
Nobody leaves the dispensary looking 
unhappy.

1485
01:05:49,911 --> 01:05:52,280
Like people always leave liquor stores 
looking all bummed out.

1486
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:57,360
People leave dispensary's looking the 
same way they leave when they nutting 

1487
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:58,180
their pants,
when they go and get a lap dance like,

1488
01:05:58,181 --> 01:05:59,760
oh boy,
I can't believe I got away with that.

1489
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:04,660
They get in their car and they drive 
away like some kind of a criminal.

1490
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:07,900
I think,
um,

1491
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:10,450
you know,
people just have this attitude that,

1492
01:06:10,451 --> 01:06:15,451
you know,
having a dispensary somehow or another 

1493
01:06:15,451 --> 01:06:15,451
different than having a liquor store.
This guy's got a liquor store,

1494
01:06:15,451 --> 01:06:16,900
right?
Me Drive out of his house,

1495
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,850
take a left,
go down the hill,

1496
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:23,910
Bam.
There's liquor store is a fucking 

1497
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:24,480
dispensary a mile away from that is like
in my neighborhood.

1498
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:28,090
So what's all this green plus sign 
nonsense.

1499
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:33,150
Or when you're out with somebody and 
they smell it on a sidewalk and they're 

1500
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:33,150
like,
they're kind of offended by it.

1501
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:33,970
I'm like,
why are you offended?

1502
01:06:33,971 --> 01:06:36,310
This is fucking cool.
It's peaceful.

1503
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:38,050
It's if people are having a good time 
around you,

1504
01:06:38,051 --> 01:06:39,790
it doesn't mean that there's crime or 
danger.

1505
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:41,390
Not only that smells good.
Yeah.

1506
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:44,320
You got caught a plus sign instead of a 
green cross.

1507
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,240
You're just like,
no religion on across.

1508
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:51,300
Yeah.
It's supposed to be like Red Cross 

1509
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:51,300
screen,
cross.

1510
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:51,300
No,
no,

1511
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:51,300
I think that's probably true.
Green Cross.

1512
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,620
Yeah.
But I mean even the cross is not a cross

1513
01:06:53,621 --> 01:06:55,000
anymore.
It's a plus sign.

1514
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:57,310
It's not religious,
but it's not.

1515
01:06:57,311 --> 01:06:58,960
It's good to have crosses an extended 
bottom.

1516
01:06:58,961 --> 01:07:00,570
There's a difference in the shape.
Essentially.

1517
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:04,870
It's like the Red Cross's cross 
medicinal use.

1518
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:07,420
That's why it's a cross.
That's why it's a green cross.

1519
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,890
Yeah.
But you can't really call it a cross.

1520
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:13,920
I like plus better anyways because it 
doesn't have any kind of religious 

1521
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:13,920
connotation.
Yeah,

1522
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:19,050
I mean it.
Was that really what Red Cross is 

1523
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:19,050
supposed to be though.
Is that why?

1524
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:19,050
Why is it okay?
I don't know.

1525
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:19,780
Okay.
Let's Google it.

1526
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:24,810
What?
That's one of the great things about 

1527
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:24,810
being a journalist is a,
when you get to the point,

1528
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:29,370
you just realize you can say no to 
things and that's the best way to do it 

1529
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:33,150
because you have google.
You don't have to like draw on what 

1530
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:33,150
little,
you know,

1531
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:33,160
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1532
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:35,440
No worries.
Um,

1533
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:40,470
what.
So the green plus sign on pot 

1534
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:40,470
dispensaries.
Okay.

1535
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:42,350
Um Hm.
It doesn't say,

1536
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:48,750
how has this not been asked a thousand 
times over in like reading reddit trees.

1537
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:51,730
It's an interesting thing because like a
lot of these stores,

1538
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,390
that green plus sign,
it's become so universal that's,

1539
01:07:54,490 --> 01:07:58,600
that's all it has on the sign to have a 
green plus sign and then I'll say like,

1540
01:07:58,601 --> 01:08:00,040
w,
you know,

1541
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:01,150
the whatever,
you know,

1542
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:05,860
West Valley caregivers was one of them.
So it was Wv,

1543
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:06,970
CGI,
that's all it said.

1544
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,010
And then you get near the West valley 
caregivers like,

1545
01:08:09,011 --> 01:08:12,900
what the fuck are you actually selling?
And they get in there and just tanks.

1546
01:08:12,901 --> 01:08:13,720
Uh,
we'd be like,

1547
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:16,460
oh,
I see what you're doing.

1548
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,470
Unfortunately that place that I used to 
go to,

1549
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:23,500
my favorite spot,
the government told them that they had 

1550
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,460
to close down because they had opened up
a too late,

1551
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:28,640
like after a certain amount of time they
weren't approved or something like that.

1552
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:33,940
And the dude was like,
he was very nervous about it because 

1553
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,131
they had shut,
gotten shut down once for something 

1554
01:08:36,131 --> 01:08:36,131
else.

1555
01:08:36,131 --> 01:08:38,090
And the guy who owned it previously 
wound up going to jail.

1556
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:43,620
He was,
he was one of the few people that got 

1557
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:43,620
popped.
Actually he didn't know him that when he

1558
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:47,591
owned another one,
but I know one of the guys who got 

1559
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:48,590
popped and wind up doing time and then 
there's some guys in San Francisco,

1560
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:51,020
those guys,
a pot university guys,

1561
01:08:51,021 --> 01:08:52,820
whatever the fuck they are.
Cannabis University,

1562
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:55,010
those guys are still duking it out in 
court.

1563
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,300
Pot,
pot,

1564
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:57,230
pot,
McCormick,

1565
01:08:57,290 --> 01:09:00,600
todd McCormick,
todd mccormick.

1566
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:04,040
Our friend is involved in some legal 
bullshit.

1567
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:05,840
Again,
it's crazy.

1568
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,720
I only do delivery nowadays.
I don't even go to this store is a smart

1569
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:09,830
move man.
Yeah,

1570
01:09:09,890 --> 01:09:11,180
I mean look,
there's,

1571
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:16,210
there's plenty of weed and it's way 
easier to get and it's way more relaxed 

1572
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:21,860
but it's still sketchy federally and if 
someone comes in after Obama,

1573
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:26,470
which is very likely,
that is a more repressive because this,

1574
01:09:26,471 --> 01:09:28,610
this Obama thing has been a goddamn 
mess.

1575
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:33,610
I mean he,
what he's done and what we thought he 

1576
01:09:33,610 --> 01:09:35,660
was going to do are so polar opposite 
and you know,

1577
01:09:35,661 --> 01:09:38,720
they didn't stop the Dea from rating 
these medical marijuana facilities.

1578
01:09:38,721 --> 01:09:43,721
There's a lot of raids during his time 
if you want to go and look at how many 

1579
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:45,740
raids took place during Obama's time.
It's been quite substantial.

1580
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:50,741
The blowback from that has also been 
substantial and it's very damaging to 

1581
01:09:50,741 --> 01:09:53,180
his party because he's essentially a 
Republican in wolf clothing.

1582
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,670
What I mean,
a lot of the shit that I've done outside

1583
01:09:55,671 --> 01:10:00,671
of social things have been like really,
really similar to what the Bush 

1584
01:10:00,671 --> 01:10:04,781
administration did.
There's been a lot of really negative 

1585
01:10:04,781 --> 01:10:06,170
shit that's happened with the dea 
breaking into these pots doors,

1586
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:11,200
putting fucking boots on kids' necks and
taken like there was one that they did 

1587
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:15,551
where they got caught doing all this 
because all the film was sent remotely 

1588
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,400
to another location,
like constantly.

1589
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,740
It was currently sent so no one can 
steal the hard drives.

1590
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,660
The security cameras.
We're still recording,

1591
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:24,890
so the so seed got to see them put their
boots on this kids neck,

1592
01:10:24,891 --> 01:10:26,360
throw him to the ground.
Just a kid.

1593
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,130
Just a young 20 year old kid working in 
a place that's just pull all the money.

1594
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,560
Just people being thugs.
They steal the money.

1595
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:38,900
Well,
if they know that these people aren't 

1596
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:38,900
threats,
you your break,

1597
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:42,191
you see 20 year old college kid is 
working there and national security 

1598
01:10:42,191 --> 01:10:44,750
threat investigation,
you know who these people are,

1599
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:47,270
you know who you're arresting and you've
got your boot on his neck.

1600
01:10:47,271 --> 01:10:48,620
One of the people who are trying to 
relax,

1601
01:10:48,621 --> 01:10:50,870
people are trying to find like more,
uh,

1602
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:53,690
healthy outlets for their anxiety or 
their uncertainty.

1603
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:59,050
So the point is there's probably going 
to be someone could easily bribe a 

1604
01:10:59,661 --> 01:11:04,310
politician to go hard on these things 
with the new administration office.

1605
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:07,340
If there was a big push by the 
pharmaceutical industry,

1606
01:11:07,341 --> 01:11:09,080
it was a big push by the alcohol 
industry,

1607
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,990
big push by whatever prison guards 
union,

1608
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:14,130
whoever it needs to be.
The can grease the wheels

1609
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:19,130
to get them to be harder on marijuana.
It could conceivably happen that the 

1610
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:20,190
genie's not totally out of the bottle 
yet,

1611
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:25,580
but I think that the chances of that 
happening are thankfully not that high 

1612
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:28,740
because the cat's out of the bag.
The public knows that marijuana is not a

1613
01:11:28,741 --> 01:11:30,360
bad thing.
Now it's a good thing.

1614
01:11:30,361 --> 01:11:32,640
And that's a very,
that's a very hard thing to.

1615
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:37,730
How can you outdo that at this point?
Doesn't matter how many reefer madness 

1616
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:41,181
as you put out,
people have come to the conclusion that 

1617
01:11:41,181 --> 01:11:41,181
it's actually not bad for you.
Did you see?

1618
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:46,190
And what about her?
She was on Piers Morgan talking about 

1619
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:49,971
pot.
I'm sure she's against it and put it on 

1620
01:11:49,971 --> 01:11:49,971
and coulter on Piers Morgan talking 
about pot,

1621
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:53,430
not just against it.
She's so ridiculous.

1622
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,160
It's so hilarious because first of all 
it's working,

1623
01:11:56,161 --> 01:11:57,180
right?
We're talking about her.

1624
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:02,420
So obviously her trolling people like 
that just want to stay in the media and 

1625
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:03,270
they don't realize the real harm they're
doing to the,

1626
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:05,960
the national discourse.
I agree with she,

1627
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:08,910
she got,
she got you to mention her name just now

1628
01:12:08,911 --> 01:12:11,240
and now she's going to get booked on 
another show because of this.

1629
01:12:11,241 --> 01:12:14,040
So will be on the today show and that's 
great.

1630
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:19,041
So she can sell more books,
but she's fucking over people who 

1631
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:22,401
actually rely on what they see on tv and
she's just fucking up the whole 

1632
01:12:22,401 --> 01:12:22,401
discourse.
You got it,

1633
01:12:22,401 --> 01:12:23,820
Brian?
Five seconds.

1634
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:25,080
Yeah.
She's,

1635
01:12:25,081 --> 01:12:27,030
um,
she's a terrible person.

1636
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:32,500
I mean,
what she's doing is for her own benefit 

1637
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:33,030
and that the trolling when you have,

1638
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:37,130
why is it illegal?
Cannabis,

1639
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,200
cigarettes,
alcohol,

1640
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:40,710
I answer.
You're going to interrupt me and say,

1641
01:12:40,711 --> 01:12:42,070
no,
it's not true.

1642
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:43,140
That.
Explain why.

1643
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:44,310
Well,
I kept trying to.

1644
01:12:44,311 --> 01:12:46,110
When you had been dropping.
Now I'm going to explain now.

1645
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:48,400
So don't interrupt.
Um,

1646
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,800
look,
the sole purpose for smoking pot or 

1647
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,380
eating a pot Brownie is to get high.
That is not true with alcohol.

1648
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,480
Okay.
Pause it right there.

1649
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:58,290
She's wrong,
right?

1650
01:12:58,291 --> 01:12:59,500
They're like,
what is crazy?

1651
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:04,730
What does that mean?
Who gets he gets he drinks not to get 

1652
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:04,730
drunk.
Yeah.

1653
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:08,241
I drink whiskey for the taste.
Imagined he fucking sitting around 

1654
01:13:08,241 --> 01:13:12,801
drinking whiskey.
Like imagine if they came up with 

1655
01:13:12,801 --> 01:13:15,171
alcohol free whiskey and they sold it in
those big arnold palmer lemonade cans 

1656
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:18,540
with alcohol free whiskey.
They're trying to do that with weed.

1657
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:22,860
They're trying to give you the uh,
the benefits without the high,

1658
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:25,710
like extract that and put it in a pill.
I think that would fuck people over.

1659
01:13:25,870 --> 01:13:26,320
No,
no,

1660
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,890
no.
They're actually the scientific research

1661
01:13:28,891 --> 01:13:33,891
behind that is for extract cbd.
It's for pain is for micro under chronic

1662
01:13:34,231 --> 01:13:36,230
pain that they don't want to get high,
but okay,

1663
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:41,240
that's different.
My thinking was that they're kind of 

1664
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:41,240
like,
oh,

1665
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:41,250
you can use the medical benefits as long
as you don't get high from it.

1666
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:45,030
And I think that this is totally just my
own perspective.

1667
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:50,031
I really think that part of the 
medicinal properties of marijuana is 

1668
01:13:50,031 --> 01:13:53,601
that it allows you to see things 
differently and I think there's much 

1669
01:13:53,601 --> 01:13:56,061
more of a connection between the mental 
and the physical than we're willing to 

1670
01:13:56,061 --> 01:13:59,091
accept in our Western society.
And I feel like most humans up until 

1671
01:13:59,091 --> 01:14:00,540
about 100 years ago took most of what 
I'm saying for granted.

1672
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:05,541
Like you remember reading books like 
novels of the 18 hundreds where 

1673
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:07,020
somebody's sick and their doctor says,
go live somewhere,

1674
01:14:07,021 --> 01:14:08,940
like go live in the countryside.
You'll feel better.

1675
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:14,120
And they would prescribe this shit 
actually works because if you're less 

1676
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:14,120
stressed

1677
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:14,120
out and you're in a better environment 
and you get better,

1678
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,450
your body knows what to do.
And,

1679
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:17,800
uh,
we've totally,

1680
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:19,630
like,
we try to be so clinical with everything

1681
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:22,690
that we can't let somebody just get high
and fucked up for a few hours and figure

1682
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,910
out their own shit.
It has to be very clinical,

1683
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:27,340
you know,
you can't actually feel something that's

1684
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:28,840
altered state of consciousness,

1685
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:33,910
although I agree with you on that.
I think the scientific principle or the 

1686
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:36,390
scientific reasoning behind extracting 
CBDS,

1687
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:41,580
it just so that people who have injuries
can have pain medication that's natural 

1688
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:41,660
and have it while they're at work.
Yeah,

1689
01:14:41,661 --> 01:14:43,130
that makes sense.
Don't get hooked up or.

1690
01:14:43,131 --> 01:14:48,131
Hi,
I'm thinking of something else then I 

1691
01:14:48,131 --> 01:14:48,131
gotta use the bathroom.
So.

1692
01:14:48,131 --> 01:14:51,220
No,
I don't think there's anything wrong 

1693
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:51,220
with what you're saying because I think 
you're right in a lot of ways as well.

1694
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:51,320
But I think that the,
um,

1695
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:56,350
there's a bunch of reasons why they 
extract cbd from cannabis and they're 

1696
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:56,900
not all,
it's not all,

1697
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:57,760
you know,
the,

1698
01:14:57,761 --> 01:15:02,761
the man wants to keep you down.
So play this fucking wacky bitch player 

1699
01:15:02,761 --> 01:15:02,761
some more

1700
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:08,180
or a 14 year old going to everybody.
Everybody drinks alcohol to get slightly

1701
01:15:08,181 --> 01:15:10,850
higher than when they start drinking it.
Julie Pierce Morgan.

1702
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:14,630
Absolutely.
I am done TV after drinks.

1703
01:15:14,631 --> 01:15:19,160
I bet you you have to you right now that
will explain a lot of things.

1704
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:23,600
Have you.
Would you please let me finish one?

1705
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:26,570
Tendons,
Piers Morgan will take your rainbow.

1706
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:28,880
Enjoy wine.
They drink wine for a purpose.

1707
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:31,100
Over $800.
Bottles of wine.

1708
01:15:31,101 --> 01:15:33,080
Perhaps you have a warm feeling.
It does not.

1709
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:36,350
You can tell if somebody's been smoking 
pot.

1710
01:15:36,351 --> 01:15:41,351
They're eyes are red.
They giggle at everything and by the 

1711
01:15:41,351 --> 01:15:43,330
way,
they're incapable of carrying on the 

1712
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:43,330
normal.
Have you ever smoked pot?

1713
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:43,330
No,
I haven't.

1714
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:43,330
Never know.

1715
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:43,380
Hold on.
Pause.

1716
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:49,490
How ridiculous that they're incapable of
carrying on the normal functions of 

1717
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:50,250
life.
I do Jujitsu.

1718
01:15:50,251 --> 01:15:52,650
I'm high.
I do comedy while I'm high.

1719
01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:54,180
I do in this podcast.
Hi.

1720
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:59,130
I do almost every radio show ever do 
high that the normal functions of life,

1721
01:15:59,131 --> 01:16:01,590
like what?
We go to the movies high all the time.

1722
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:03,090
Go to dinner.
Hot all the time.

1723
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:06,230
Like what is she?
What is she basing it off as?

1724
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:10,440
Does she have one ex boyfriend that's a 
pothead that she's basing opiodes about?

1725
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,720
Stop and think about that because she's 
dating.

1726
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:17,820
If that is the case,
she's dating a guy who's willing to 

1727
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:21,051
tolerate her,
so just imagine what kind of a fucking 

1728
01:16:21,051 --> 01:16:21,450
idiot he's going to be an o.
He couldn't.

1729
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,090
He couldn't function well.
Jesus Christ,

1730
01:16:24,091 --> 01:16:26,550
he pro.
It was probably paralytic.

1731
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:29,220
Just being around your fucking shitbag 
personality.

1732
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,210
I'm imagine that.

1733
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:31,950
Imagine that woman,
that's your girlfriend.

1734
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:32,670
Oh,
he couldn't.

1735
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,560
Couldn't function in life.
So is that.

1736
01:16:34,561 --> 01:16:36,000
Or if it's her friends,
like she says,

1737
01:16:36,001 --> 01:16:38,550
she knows a lot of potheads.
She has potheads have friends,

1738
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:43,500
you know what she's doing.
Is that by just trolling like that?

1739
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,210
See,
that might've been okay.

1740
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:50,240
That controlling that she did when she 
started doing it because when she 

1741
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:53,400
started doing it,
she was trying to get an alert coming up

1742
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,840
some,
some lawyers on that thing.

1743
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,970
When she started trolling like that,
it was probably pre-internet,

1744
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:05,030
you know,
I mean she was probably doing that shit 

1745
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,030
way before.

1746
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,350
The only way for her to get attention 
and the platform,

1747
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:10,500
but now that she has a platform,
she should use it for good instead of 

1748
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:10,500
glee.
We'll stop this information.

1749
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:14,480
Sub being a silly bitch like you know,
have a nuanced point of view.

1750
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:15,650
Can you do that?
Well,

1751
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,800
what can it not just be a right wing 
fucking chatterbox.

1752
01:17:18,820 --> 01:17:23,820
So like people like that who claimed to 
be limited government and conservative 

1753
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:23,850
[inaudible].
Exactly.

1754
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:28,900
It seems to me like they pretty much 
just want lower taxes because if you 

1755
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,680
really believed in limited government,
how the fuck can the government tell you

1756
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:35,860
that you can't put something that's 
first of all safe in your own body and 

1757
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:39,090
the comfort and safety of your own 
fucking home when you're an American 

1758
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:39,090
citizen and supposedly live in a free 
society,

1759
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:40,640
you should be able to do that in some 
way.

1760
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:42,590
Do I think it should be taxed and 
regulated?

1761
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:43,760
Absolutely.
Keep it safe.

1762
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:48,790
Keep it on the books,
but why shouldn't you be allowed to do 

1763
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:51,521
that?
I'm sure she doesn't have a real 

1764
01:17:51,521 --> 01:17:51,521
argument against that,
so it's only ad Hominem.

1765
01:17:51,521 --> 01:17:52,580
It's well,
they're lazy and you're like,

1766
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:53,420
well,
what about the Beatles?

1767
01:17:53,421 --> 01:17:55,040
Were they lazy?
What about Steve Jobs?

1768
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:55,850
Is he lazy?
You know,

1769
01:17:55,851 --> 01:17:58,490
like you're just isolating one anecdotal
fucking thing.

1770
01:17:58,580 --> 01:17:59,450
Exactly.
And that's not.

1771
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:03,200
I can make an argument against alcohol 
based on some guy outside.

1772
01:18:03,201 --> 01:18:08,201
He was drunk in front of a liquor store.
That doesn't mean you shouldn't go out 

1773
01:18:08,201 --> 01:18:08,201
drinking with your friends.
Not only that,

1774
01:18:08,201 --> 01:18:12,911
look what she's using as an example 
she's talking about while you were in 

1775
01:18:12,911 --> 01:18:12,911
the bathroom,
she was talking about,

1776
01:18:12,911 --> 01:18:13,310
uh,
you know,

1777
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:15,860
you could drink it and have a warm 
feeling like,

1778
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,370
come on.
You're.

1779
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:22,680
So what you're saying is you can't smoke
just a little bit of pot and just relax 

1780
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,650
a little.
You can have a very mild pot candy.

1781
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,380
There's a,
a pot candy that speed weed has.

1782
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:30,440
It's God damn perfect.
His God damn perfect.

1783
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:33,860
You can have one and it's just a mild 
edge.

1784
01:18:33,861 --> 01:18:35,820
Really reduce search.
Smile.

1785
01:18:35,821 --> 01:18:37,940
So mild,
like really like to play pool.

1786
01:18:37,941 --> 01:18:40,040
I like to take to heart candy one.
Yeah.

1787
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:44,510
But one one is great.
It's like you don't feel perplexed.

1788
01:18:44,570 --> 01:18:46,280
You don't get that.
Like what were we talking about?

1789
01:18:46,281 --> 01:18:48,980
You don't get any of that.
It's a dosage issue.

1790
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:53,060
It's the same thing with everything.
The idea that alcohol is more,

1791
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:58,150
you know,
you could easily under dosed with 

1792
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,590
alcohol and just have a warm feeling,
but you can't do that with marijuana.

1793
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:05,770
That's so foolish.
It's so dumb and it's so ignorant to 

1794
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:09,941
human physiology.
It's so ignorant to all the different 

1795
01:19:09,941 --> 01:19:12,470
things that we use on a daily basis 
where if you overuse them,

1796
01:19:12,471 --> 01:19:14,390
they would fucking kill you.
I mean,

1797
01:19:14,391 --> 01:19:19,391
there's a huge amount of medications 
that people take on a daily basis where 

1798
01:19:19,391 --> 01:19:22,370
if they took 20 times more than they 
were supposed to take their dead,

1799
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:23,810
you know,
salt,

1800
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:26,240
10 ounces of salt,
you're a dead person.

1801
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:29,000
She's in sleeping pills.
Fuck yeah.

1802
01:19:29,001 --> 01:19:30,440
Tylenol,
pms,

1803
01:19:30,441 --> 01:19:32,390
and tylenol is apparently really bad for
you.

1804
01:19:32,391 --> 01:19:34,520
If you drank,
you should not take tylenol.

1805
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:36,080
I didn't know this until a couple of 
years ago.

1806
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:41,410
If you drink,
you should not take tylenol as your 

1807
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:41,410
hangover cure.
You should take some advil.

1808
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:43,070
Acetaminophen is really tough on your 
liver.

1809
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:45,020
Oh yeah.
That stuff's not good for you.

1810
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:47,870
I know a guy who takes,
he takes,

1811
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:51,590
this is a crazy cocktail,
but he takes adderall.

1812
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:56,860
He takes Xanax and he takes ambien.
What does have been prescribed?

1813
01:19:56,901 --> 01:19:59,690
What is that about exactly?
What is that about?

1814
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:04,720
Like,
I'm going to speed myself up so I can 

1815
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:04,720
slow myself down so I can relax.
Speeds himself up.

1816
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:06,470
Then apparently you get a little freaked
out from that.

1817
01:20:06,471 --> 01:20:09,120
So he needs something to relax and 
that's where the xanax comes in.

1818
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,620
But then he can't go to bed at night.

1819
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:12,690
So he needs the ambien.
I totally POW,

1820
01:20:12,691 --> 01:20:17,691
POW.
I totally do that with coffee and 

1821
01:20:17,691 --> 01:20:19,551
alcohol though,
because what happens is you have like a 

1822
01:20:19,551 --> 01:20:21,561
meeting at 6:00
PM so you get all caffeinated and then 

1823
01:20:21,561 --> 01:20:21,561
it's 6:45
and you're in your apartment.

1824
01:20:21,561 --> 01:20:21,561
You're like,
fuck,

1825
01:20:21,561 --> 01:20:23,190
I need to chill out.
So you start,

1826
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:25,620
you start drinking because you're so 
amped from the caffeine.

1827
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:30,740
Well,
I used to have a buddy that had a crack 

1828
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:30,900
habit and uh,
I used to go with them,

1829
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:32,070
uh,
and uh,

1830
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:35,430
go to the liquor store when he was 
fucked up and he wanted to calm down,

1831
01:20:35,610 --> 01:20:40,610
he would go to the liquor store and he 
would buy a 40 ounce just to like bring 

1832
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:40,610
his heart rate down.
Wow.

1833
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:40,860
And he would,
uh,

1834
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,820
yeah,
a healthy living right there.

1835
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:44,580
Oh,
he's dead.

1836
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:45,600
Oh,
sorry about that.

1837
01:20:45,660 --> 01:20:46,440
Yeah,
he died.

1838
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:51,500
He was,
this is why I'm not a comedian by the 

1839
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:51,500
way.

1840
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:51,500
No,
you can't.

1841
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:52,630
I couldn't get upset at you for seeing 
the healthy living.

1842
01:20:52,631 --> 01:20:55,010
It's obviously not healthier.
He had a lot of,

1843
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:58,500
a lot of drug problems,
but he wound up dying because of it.

1844
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:03,890
And um,
but just seeing him trying to calm down 

1845
01:21:03,890 --> 01:21:05,220
by drinking,
pounding this 40 ounce of beer,

1846
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,670
just try to get the alcohol into his 
bloodstream to just alleviate the,

1847
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:12,210
the crazy heartbeat that he had going 
on.

1848
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:14,880
That's where the dea and stuff like that
is fucking up also,

1849
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:20,210
is if they've betrayed the trust of 
young people by lying to them about 

1850
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:20,220
marijuana.
So as a result,

1851
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,750
there are probably people out there who 
are like,

1852
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:23,220
well,
maybe not that bad.

1853
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:28,250
Exactly.
Maybe crack cocaine is not that bad 

1854
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,591
because they completely lied to a some 
marijuana and I remember as a kid in 

1855
01:21:30,591 --> 01:21:34,461
middle school they had a cop come to our
classroom and give us the whole day or 

1856
01:21:34,461 --> 01:21:38,230
breakdown and he had a suitcase filled 
with like fake versions of drugs and 

1857
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:38,230
what they look like.

1858
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:40,470
And I was thinking like,
even as a kid I was like,

1859
01:21:40,471 --> 01:21:43,380
how ridiculous is this?
Now I'm an expert on all these drugs.

1860
01:21:43,381 --> 01:21:46,170
Look like before I didn't know shit 
about half these things down,

1861
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:50,190
like practically a drug dealer based on 
this fucking infomercial.

1862
01:21:50,191 --> 01:21:52,200
Like here's all the stuff that you 
should never look for,

1863
01:21:52,201 --> 01:21:54,540
don't look for this one.
It comes in this kind of bag,

1864
01:21:54,870 --> 01:21:55,500
you know?
And I'm like,

1865
01:21:55,501 --> 01:21:57,630
what is this?
Some kind of weird propaganda.

1866
01:21:57,690 --> 01:22:02,690
There's education and knowing what not 
to take as long as you're honest about 

1867
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:02,690
it,
as long as you go.

1868
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:03,960
Now this one is actually just the dried 
plant.

1869
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:06,330
It grows all over the contiguous United 
States.

1870
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,670
It's been used for thousands of years,
by the way.

1871
01:22:08,671 --> 01:22:10,800
You just said contiguous.
I've never used that word ever.

1872
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:12,580
Have you ever used contiguous?
Yeah,

1873
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:13,290
of course.
No,

1874
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:14,760
it's a good word.
Thank you.

1875
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,190
So I,
uh,

1876
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,100
I read a lot of Shit on my kindle and 
then certain words just get into my mind

1877
01:22:20,101 --> 01:22:21,990
is a good one and I'm like,
I'm going to use this next time.

1878
01:22:21,991 --> 01:22:26,730
I feel like using it rocket contiguous.
Hope you use it correctly anyway.

1879
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:28,980
So it's already being fact checked.
You're right.

1880
01:22:28,981 --> 01:22:29,970
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

1881
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:33,030
It's that if they said that,
if they're honest about the look,

1882
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,220
you shouldn't do this one because it's 
going to lower your motivation.

1883
01:22:35,221 --> 01:22:40,221
At least stay away from it until you get
into college or until you get a job or 

1884
01:22:40,221 --> 01:22:43,431
whatever it is that you need to get.
You should avoid if you want to be as 

1885
01:22:43,431 --> 01:22:43,980
motivated as possible.
If they said that,

1886
01:22:43,981 --> 01:22:44,610
then I'm like,
okay,

1887
01:22:44,611 --> 01:22:47,370
then I'll listen to you when it comes to
stay away from the crack cocaine because

1888
01:22:47,371 --> 01:22:49,260
it will fuck up your life,
which it will,

1889
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:52,590
but you don't trust that person.
I have no trust what they say.

1890
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:57,650
Well,
it also fucks up the relationship that 

1891
01:22:57,650 --> 01:22:58,050
people have to law enforcement.
It fucks up the relationship that people

1892
01:22:58,051 --> 01:23:03,051
have to people in positions of authority
that you legitimately need to protect 

1893
01:23:03,051 --> 01:23:06,130
you in a civilized society and that's 
what the cops should

1894
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:11,130
be.
Being a cop should be an honorable 

1895
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:11,130
position that's very difficult to 
acquire.

1896
01:23:11,130 --> 01:23:15,390
It should be something that we really 
respect and we love and appreciate the 

1897
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:16,840
people that are around us that are there
to help us.

1898
01:23:16,841 --> 01:23:19,510
If some shit goes wrong,
if some bad people around,

1899
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:21,610
if some people are victimizing other 
people,

1900
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:25,030
some people are breaking the law.
That should be a part of our society,

1901
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:30,180
but when they become a dea person and 
they're shooting someone's fucking dog,

1902
01:23:30,330 --> 01:23:32,200
cause they got a plant growing in the 
house.

1903
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:37,230
I mean how many of those God damn videos
you have to see for you realize there's 

1904
01:23:37,230 --> 01:23:40,201
a problem with the fact these cops think
they could just break into someone's 

1905
01:23:40,201 --> 01:23:40,420
house and shoot the fucking dog for 
nothing.

1906
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:43,000
They shoot shoot dogs that are behind 
dog gates barking,

1907
01:23:43,001 --> 01:23:44,800
little tiny dark.
He just shoot them.

1908
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:47,380
They shoot them because they want to 
intimidate the fuck out of the people.

1909
01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:48,550
They want to let them know,
look,

1910
01:23:48,551 --> 01:23:53,551
I just shut your fucking dog.
You're going to start crying and I'm 

1911
01:23:53,551 --> 01:23:53,551
going to get what I want,
and it's part of the power trip.

1912
01:23:53,551 --> 01:23:58,471
It's part of the thing and it's part of 
what makes people distrust cops and 

1913
01:23:58,471 --> 01:24:03,091
that's fucked.
If cops didn't have to deal with these 

1914
01:24:03,091 --> 01:24:03,160
laws,
if there wasn't laws that were unjust on

1915
01:24:03,161 --> 01:24:08,161
the books,
then this sort of behavior would never 

1916
01:24:08,161 --> 01:24:08,230
take place.
If you couldn't do that to someone,

1917
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,710
you couldn't break down someone's door 
and and fucking shoot their dog.

1918
01:24:11,711 --> 01:24:15,460
If you could only go and arrest people 
who are committing crimes,

1919
01:24:15,461 --> 01:24:18,100
our whole attitude crimes have 
victimized people.

1920
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:21,430
Our whole attitude about law enforcement
would change.

1921
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:23,650
It would make it better for them.
You know?

1922
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:26,440
It would make it better for them.
They will become like firefighters.

1923
01:24:26,441 --> 01:24:31,441
It would become an integral part of our 
society that's absolutely necessary 

1924
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:32,290
except for the people that are fucking 
committing the crime,

1925
01:24:32,291 --> 01:24:35,650
which we don't want in the first place,
but it has to be real crime.

1926
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:40,830
It has to be crime and creates victims,
victimless crimes or horse shit crimes 

1927
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:42,310
against yourself,
their bullshit.

1928
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,100
You can't stop a person from cutting off
their own fucking finger.

1929
01:24:45,101 --> 01:24:50,101
Did you know that?
If you decided to go get a bolt cutter 

1930
01:24:50,101 --> 01:24:52,711
from fucking Home Depot,
take it home and hack off one of your 

1931
01:24:52,711 --> 01:24:53,020
fingers.
No one can fucking stop you.

1932
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:54,790
You go to the hospital and they say,
what happened?

1933
01:24:54,791 --> 01:24:57,340
I cut my finger off of the bolt cutter.
They're not going to arrest you.

1934
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:58,300
They're gonna go,
why'd you do that?

1935
01:24:58,301 --> 01:24:59,830
You're like,
I fucking hate that finger there.

1936
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:00,440
Go,
all right,

1937
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:01,990
well,
don't do that again.

1938
01:25:01,991 --> 01:25:03,340
You idiot.
You're going to die.

1939
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:08,370
You know you've got an infection.
Take these antibiotics and get out of 

1940
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:11,131
the hospital,
but how come you can cut off your 

1941
01:25:11,131 --> 01:25:13,351
fucking finger?
But if you see a guy who likes to smoke 

1942
01:25:13,351 --> 01:25:13,351
pot,
you can arrest him.

1943
01:25:13,351 --> 01:25:14,800
You could arrest him for what?
What's he doing?

1944
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:17,110
He's doing something to his body that 
you don't agree.

1945
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:19,210
Is that what it is?
Because there's no victims.

1946
01:25:19,211 --> 01:25:20,710
Here we're is.
You're a victim.

1947
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:24,280
Is the smoke going into the air and 
polluting our modern discourse?

1948
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,220
Is it.
Is it fucking taking paint off cars down

1949
01:25:27,221 --> 01:25:28,000
the block?
No,

1950
01:25:28,001 --> 01:25:29,980
it's not doing a goddamn thing.
There's no staff.

1951
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:33,280
There's no crime.
There's no crime and dance where we have

1952
01:25:33,281 --> 01:25:35,770
to make a distinction and the reason 
why,

1953
01:25:35,771 --> 01:25:40,771
one of the reasons why that distinction 
is very difficult to make is because 

1954
01:25:40,771 --> 01:25:41,920
there's people that have made these laws
and enforcing these laws.

1955
01:25:41,921 --> 01:25:46,921
A business.
There's a business not just in keeping 

1956
01:25:46,921 --> 01:25:50,911
prison guards in in work,
but keeping prisons filled and keeping,

1957
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:56,220
making sure that prisons generate income
from bringing prisoners so they make 

1958
01:25:56,220 --> 01:26:00,781
sure that laws are in place that 
absolutely ensure that they're going to 

1959
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:05,161
have new people in there every year 
because people are going to keep 

1960
01:26:05,161 --> 01:26:05,960
breaking these laws because the laws 
that are ridiculous,

1961
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:11,050
the laws that have been in place since 
the beginning of the time and those 

1962
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:11,050
laws,
they they,

1963
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:14,710
they,
they're about 30 percent of the people 

1964
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:14,710
that are in prison.

1965
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:14,870
That's what's so fucked up about it.

1966
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:20,090
Do you think that these laws,
these anti psychedelic and anti 

1967
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:23,481
marijuana laws are actually like a form 
of societies immune system?

1968
01:26:23,701 --> 01:26:28,701
Kind of going overboard?
Like I think about how some of the most 

1969
01:26:28,701 --> 01:26:32,931
brilliant people seem to have some kind 
of interaction with drugs at some point 

1970
01:26:32,931 --> 01:26:35,871
in their lives,
whether it be steve jobs with the acid 

1971
01:26:35,871 --> 01:26:38,841
trips or you know,
pretty much any musician with weed or 

1972
01:26:38,841 --> 01:26:39,670
any writer with weed at median,
with.

1973
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,070
Okay.
Any comedian,

1974
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:46,460
it unlocks a lot of potential that 
otherwise wouldn't be there for people 

1975
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:47,490
and it shows you the world in a 
different way.

1976
01:26:47,491 --> 01:26:50,520
Especially if you do something that's 
even stronger like a psychedelic.

1977
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:56,330
It's showing you something.
It's almost like root access to a 

1978
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:56,330
computer where it gives you a lot more 
power.

1979
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:57,630
But for most people you don't want root 
access.

1980
01:26:57,631 --> 01:26:59,110
You just want them to have their,
you know,

1981
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,680
their web browser and that's it and you 
don't want them fucking stuff up.

1982
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:06,920
I wonder if society as a whole is to 
kind of unconscious thing that goes on 

1983
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:07,590
is like,
this is really powerful stuff,

1984
01:27:07,591 --> 01:27:09,480
so we'll allow some people to have 
access to it,

1985
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:11,640
but we can't just let the whole society 
go.

1986
01:27:11,641 --> 01:27:12,530
Timothy Leary,
you know,

1987
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,380
tune in,
tune out,

1988
01:27:13,381 --> 01:27:18,381
whatever his thing was.
Because what will have as a result is 

1989
01:27:18,381 --> 01:27:22,400
completely uncharted waters that we 
haven't been to before and there are 

1990
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:22,710
people really afraid of that happening.

1991
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:27,950
Well,
I think if you have to look where these 

1992
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:29,400
laws coming from,
are the laws coming from really educated

1993
01:27:29,401 --> 01:27:33,050
philosophers and scholars?
Not so much the exempt.

1994
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:33,540
No,
no.

1995
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:36,930
These laws are coming from people who 
are doing a lot of fearmongering.

1996
01:27:36,931 --> 01:27:40,140
You remember all the shit that Ronald 
Reagan was saying back in the day.

1997
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:45,350
Well,
it turns out that marijuana may be one 

1998
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:48,171
of the most damaging drugs known to me.
The most dangerous job.

1999
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:49,200
You know,
it's,

2000
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:50,970
it's that kind of shit.
Those are the people,

2001
01:27:50,971 --> 01:27:55,971
these people like this and coulter Twat.
Let's finish listening to this because 

2002
01:27:55,971 --> 01:27:56,250
it's so fucking ridiculous.
Play it more.

2003
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:01,790
How do you know what it was?
My best friend,

2004
01:28:01,791 --> 01:28:02,350
no,
she's not.

2005
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,010
I doubt that a lot of friends,
um,

2006
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:09,040
maybe bill Maher is going to still get 
their pod.

2007
01:28:09,041 --> 01:28:14,041
They're probably self medicating,
but the more people will take it and if 

2008
01:28:14,041 --> 01:28:14,060
it is made legal vastly more people will
take it.

2009
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:17,470
Disaster for commerce.
Commerce.

2010
01:28:17,530 --> 01:28:22,530
That's hilarious.
Contents are incapable of following 

2011
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:22,530
simple instructions and getting the job 
done.

2012
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:27,480
Piers Morgan's body language.
He's like this fucking person that I 

2013
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:28,610
have to interview a drag on the economy.
He's awful too.

2014
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:30,310
I was just fine.
Great.

2015
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:33,230
What do you mean by pop?
Was um,

2016
01:28:33,231 --> 01:28:38,231
when I'm,
I'm moved to a new place in California 

2017
01:28:38,231 --> 01:28:38,231
and there was a cool pool guy.
I didn't,

2018
01:28:38,231 --> 01:28:42,810
you know,
I'd come back and it's four feet down 

2019
01:28:42,810 --> 01:28:43,070
and it's called covered with green mold 
and I called him up.

2020
01:28:43,071 --> 01:28:44,230
He was a pothead.
Oh,

2021
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:44,570
I was there.

2022
01:28:44,860 --> 01:28:48,330
You know how silly that is?
I want to talk about anecdotal evidence.

2023
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:52,530
She met a pool guy who was a pothead who
didn't clean our pool.

2024
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:55,880
So therefore what a selfish con People 
Centered Company,

2025
01:28:56,220 --> 01:29:01,220
$800 bottle of wine just talking about 
$800 bottles of wine and then she talks 

2026
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:02,010
about how her pool couldn't do

2027
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,570
his job because he was high on pot.

2028
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:09,750
Let me try.
Let me try and stop the stream of 

2029
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:09,750
consciousness.
Yeah.

2030
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:09,910
Anything done with a pothead.
What we need to do.

2031
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:15,050
Everyone knows what a pod had.
It doesn't mean it's not smoking pot one

2032
01:29:15,051 --> 01:29:20,051
time.
How much are you assuming a pothead 

2033
01:29:20,051 --> 01:29:22,871
takes enough so that it can be made fun 
of on TV promoting a narrative.

2034
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:26,360
It's heavy drinker,
heavy smoker,

2035
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:29,480
no heavy smokers work all night and then
die young,

2036
01:29:29,481 --> 01:29:34,481
saving the social security system money 
and we for a commerce commercial 

2037
01:29:34,481 --> 01:29:39,371
purposes,
for the purposes of the good of the 

2038
01:29:39,371 --> 01:29:39,371
country,
we ought to encourage Americans to smoke

2039
01:29:39,371 --> 01:29:40,040
like mad.
They'd be incredibly productive.

2040
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,380
Well,
you're seeing laser John.

2041
01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:44,480
He's encouraging lung cancer.
You're seeing right now is a human who's

2042
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:47,250
screaming for a psychedelic 
intervention.

2043
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:52,790
If we could get ann coulter into a 
jungle retreat in Peru and force feed 

2044
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:59,061
Iowasca with one of those things that 
they use for fog wall when they stuffed 

2045
01:29:59,061 --> 01:30:02,160
goose filled with grain to make their 
liver fat and delicious.

2046
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:04,410
If we could do that with her with 
Iowasca,

2047
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:07,470
just pinched her nose and our mouth.
Pinot.

2048
01:30:07,471 --> 01:30:09,240
Just pin it together.
Hold onto it,

2049
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:10,100
force it down.

2050
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:11,960
Walmart.

2051
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:14,160
Hold it in there and make sure your body
absorbs it.

2052
01:30:14,161 --> 01:30:16,740
No,
throw up and then let this bitch go on a

2053
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:19,650
wild ride on the feathered snake and 
come back.

2054
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:21,900
She doesn't eat dick too.
She needs Dick too,

2055
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:22,350
for sure.
Sure.

2056
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:23,220
Well,
you know what she needs.

2057
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:25,080
She needs Dick.
That actually wants to fuck her.

2058
01:30:25,230 --> 01:30:27,300
She probably can get some Dick,
but it's probably a mess.

2059
01:30:27,301 --> 01:30:30,570
They're both drunk and you know,
he was breast mouse,

2060
01:30:30,610 --> 01:30:34,620
some weird Fox News producer just on top
of her wedding.

2061
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:37,700
Stinky feet was fucking slippery.
Socks on.

2062
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:39,390
The whole thing is a mess.
I'm sure.

2063
01:30:39,391 --> 01:30:40,710
It's disgusting.
She's gross.

2064
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:44,370
She's a gross human being and not just 
gross like with,

2065
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:45,210
you know,
she,

2066
01:30:45,410 --> 01:30:47,970
she's not an ugly woman.
She's not my favorite,

2067
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:50,610
but her personality is gross.
It's.

2068
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:55,611
It's just so insensitive and aggressive 
and ego maniacal like what what she's 

2069
01:30:55,611 --> 01:30:59,090
saying is so preposterous and so 
obviously so.

2070
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:01,590
Obviously trolling.
That's what she's doing.

2071
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:05,940
Fucking done.
She's the master troll the day.

2072
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,570
See the new Godzilla trailer out today a
little bit more.

2073
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:13,590
This case was more things to yell and 
then we'll play that because that's so 

2074
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:13,590
much more awesome.

2075
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:16,370
It's not heavy drinkers.
When the cat is out of the bed,

2076
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:17,910
you can put it back in.
That was the problem,

2077
01:31:17,911 --> 01:31:20,070
but here's the problem,
but the issue is again,

2078
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:21,850
to pick up where I was in the middle of 
my sentence,

2079
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:24,440
but during prohibition,
that isn't a big deal.

2080
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:27,820
Why do we treat it?
Alcohol related disease,

2081
01:31:27,821 --> 01:31:31,210
cirrhosis of the liver,
accidents as a result of alcohol.

2082
01:31:31,211 --> 01:31:33,910
One down precipitously.
It will go up.

2083
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:36,310
We will have luck.
This is how many fans we have.

2084
01:31:36,570 --> 01:31:41,570
One that's just about enough that nobody
has ever overdosed on cannabis.

2085
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,640
Did you know that they can perform daily
functions.

2086
01:31:45,790 --> 01:31:48,440
They're going to be on my tax bill.
You the people.

2087
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:51,820
Can you accept that?
People can overdose on too much.

2088
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:53,590
Everybody dies.
Eventually

2089
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:58,450
you just contradicted yourself.
Eat dummy and do you encourage cigarette

2090
01:31:58,451 --> 01:32:00,270
smoking on television.
What

2091
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:03,360
she's doing right there is just being a 
silly person,

2092
01:32:03,570 --> 01:32:06,330
which she's doing right.
There is a purposely trolling,

2093
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:09,720
which he's doing right there is just 
trying to get attention and holding onto

2094
01:32:09,721 --> 01:32:12,600
an argument that doesn't have any basis 
in logical thinking.

2095
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:16,020
Her argument is just about her trying to
get her point over.

2096
01:32:16,350 --> 01:32:19,110
She's just a shitty example of a person 
who's allowed to talk.

2097
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:21,930
So that's what it is.
You know you shouldn't be.

2098
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:27,440
You shouldn't be given that sort of a 
platform if that's the kind of thing 

2099
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:27,810
that you do because it's so obvious.
She's not a thinker.

2100
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:33,140
What she's doing is she has an ideology 
and she pushes that ideology at the 

2101
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:34,590
expense of all the contradictory 
evidence.

2102
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:36,100
You know,
no matter what she's.

2103
01:32:36,110 --> 01:32:41,110
I mean,
she's talking about fucking alcohol 

2104
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:41,110
being okay.
Cigarettes being okay,

2105
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:44,841
marijuana being back,
they're going to be on my tax bill is 

2106
01:32:44,841 --> 01:32:44,841
her concern.

2107
01:32:44,841 --> 01:32:45,010
Well guess what,
Hooker,

2108
01:32:45,030 --> 01:32:47,070
I'm not on your tax bill.
There you go.

2109
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:49,890
I smoked pot.
It's a dumb thing to say,

2110
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:53,160
it's just the fucking Nancy grace thing.
They're all lazy.

2111
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:57,300
Particular look at you fat.
So are you.

2112
01:32:57,301 --> 01:33:01,830
Are you a fucking maniac?
Mountain climber is that you running 100

2113
01:33:01,831 --> 01:33:04,050
miles every morning.
You're fucking lazy.

2114
01:33:04,051 --> 01:33:05,280
You're lazy bitch.
You're lazy.

2115
01:33:05,281 --> 01:33:07,530
Fat Face Bitch.
Okay?

2116
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:12,990
Patil,
lazy dummies out there talking shit 

2117
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:15,801
about pot.
It's not pot and you know Ken pot make 

2118
01:33:15,801 --> 01:33:15,960
you lazy.
Well,

2119
01:33:15,961 --> 01:33:20,490
it can relax you and if there's.
If you have a tendency to want to not do

2120
01:33:20,491 --> 01:33:22,140
things,
pot will definitely accept you.

2121
01:33:22,290 --> 01:33:27,240
Accentuate that tendency,
but being lazy is a state of mind.

2122
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:32,510
It's what you decide,
the direction you decide to pursue your 

2123
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:32,510
life.
I'm,

2124
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:36,531
I am not lazy because of marijuana.
I am more introspective and oftentimes I

2125
01:33:37,411 --> 01:33:40,440
get more done because of marijuana 
because I have more interests.

2126
01:33:41,130 --> 01:33:45,210
It's just we have these perceptions and 
we have these stereotypes that have been

2127
01:33:45,211 --> 01:33:50,211
reinforced and movies and we have these 
ideas and we have these ideas that are 

2128
01:33:50,401 --> 01:33:53,370
coming from a person who clearly doesn't
smoke pot.

2129
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:56,810
Clearly she's not eating pot cookies and
exploring your conscience.

2130
01:33:57,250 --> 01:33:58,960
I don't believe in any kind of media 
laws,

2131
01:33:58,961 --> 01:34:03,961
but I almost feel like there should be a
law where if you're going to talk about 

2132
01:34:03,961 --> 01:34:06,571
a subject this big,
you actually have to have firsthand 

2133
01:34:06,571 --> 01:34:09,571
experience,
so if you're talking about marijuana is 

2134
01:34:09,571 --> 01:34:11,641
harmful,
you must have actually used it yourself 

2135
01:34:11,641 --> 01:34:12,250
more than once before.
You can talk about it in that manner.

2136
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:17,380
If you're talking about Bitcoin,
you actually have to have used it at 

2137
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:17,770
least once.
If you're talking about anything.

2138
01:34:17,771 --> 01:34:19,030
If you're talking about being 
unemployed,

2139
01:34:19,210 --> 01:34:24,210
you have to have been unemployed at some
point or at least interview somebody 

2140
01:34:24,210 --> 01:34:24,670
who's unemployed now and not just 
pontificate,

2141
01:34:24,671 --> 01:34:25,900
which is what so many people do.

2142
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I agree to a certain extent.
I think the marijuana thing is it's also

2143
01:34:31,311 --> 01:34:35,870
troubling the format in which they're 
communicating in these goddamn formats,

2144
01:34:35,871 --> 01:34:40,190
these television formats or so and I.
I didn't realize it when I was younger,

2145
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:45,310
but now after four years of podcasting,
I'm so aware of what the difference is 

2146
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:47,870
and communicating like that and 
communicating like this.

2147
01:34:48,110 --> 01:34:50,210
Like when you.
When you do Jujitsu,

2148
01:34:50,460 --> 01:34:55,460
like say if you're a really good at 
Jujitsu and you roll with someone who's 

2149
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:59,741
just really strong,
he wrote with a guy who was like a good 

2150
01:34:59,741 --> 01:34:59,741
athlete.

2151
01:34:59,741 --> 01:35:03,610
It takes you a while to get them,
but you're going to get them so it's 

2152
01:35:03,610 --> 01:35:03,680
going to take a while.
Like if someone doesn't know Jujitsu but

2153
01:35:03,681 --> 01:35:05,450
they're really strong,
you might not be able to hold onto them.

2154
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:10,451
They might throw you off them,
but eventually they're going to get 

2155
01:35:10,451 --> 01:35:12,881
tired of doing that because they're 
doing it the wrong way and you're going 

2156
01:35:12,881 --> 01:35:15,511
to get them.
When Ann cultures on a Pierce Morgan 

2157
01:35:15,511 --> 01:35:18,551
show,
she could say a bunch of crazy shit 

2158
01:35:18,551 --> 01:35:18,551
because she knows the commercials come 
in at seven minutes.

2159
01:35:18,551 --> 01:35:20,750
She can start this ridiculous argument 
that's completely securitas.

2160
01:35:20,751 --> 01:35:22,650
It doesn't have an ending to it,
and he.

2161
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:24,470
There's,
there's going to be an interruption,

2162
01:35:24,471 --> 01:35:29,471
will be right back,
and then they're going to cut to 

2163
01:35:29,471 --> 01:35:29,471
commercial and they're going to come 
back and she's going to babble some more

2164
01:35:29,471 --> 01:35:31,430
so she can sprint.
It's just like a fight.

2165
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:33,800
We sprint in between rounds,
sprint,

2166
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:38,890
and then in between rounds you relaxed 
and then you come back with some other 

2167
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:40,010
fucking inane argument and the next 
round and that's what she's doing,

2168
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:42,650
but if you got her on a podcast for 
three hours,

2169
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:47,800
I would brian downing her.
I would do exactly what I did with that 

2170
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,711
guy.
You just talked to them and allow them 

2171
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:50,711
to express themselves until you reveal 
how ridiculous they are.

2172
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:50,930
Yeah.
If she.

2173
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:52,370
If she were,
if she were here,

2174
01:35:52,371 --> 01:35:55,250
she wouldn't be able to do a 
intellectual hit and run where you throw

2175
01:35:55,251 --> 01:35:58,370
out like this huge character attack 
against weed smokers and then it's over.

2176
01:35:58,400 --> 01:35:59,690
Exactly.
I would let her talk,

2177
01:35:59,870 --> 01:36:02,120
let her talk.
I have hours to kill.

2178
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:03,440
Let's go.
Come on,

2179
01:36:03,470 --> 01:36:08,470
get to it,
and after awhile you're going to get 

2180
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:08,470
tired.
You're going to get tired.

2181
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:08,470
You get tired of saying nuts.

2182
01:36:08,470 --> 01:36:12,320
It's going to get tired of sprinting 
with nonsense and then slowly but surely

2183
01:36:12,410 --> 01:36:17,410
we will compile facts and slowly but 
surely we will present you with examples

2184
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:22,720
of people who use it,
who are healthy and who have benefited 

2185
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:22,850
from it.
And I'll tell you my own personal story,

2186
01:36:22,851 --> 01:36:25,700
I benefit from it,
and then we can compare and you can tell

2187
01:36:25,701 --> 01:36:29,180
me if you'll you think that Eddie Bravo 
is lazy.

2188
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:32,000
You think that one of the best Jujitsu 
instructors in the country,

2189
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:34,550
one of the first American ever Tappa 
Gracie.

2190
01:36:34,580 --> 01:36:37,070
You think he's lazy?
Lazy.

2191
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:38,780
Oh,
you think he's lazy.

2192
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:44,010
You don't just stop and think about all 
the comedians we know that smoke weed 

2193
01:36:44,010 --> 01:36:47,051
that fucking constantly travel across 
the country that constantly writing and 

2194
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:50,081
performing are they lazy and now you're 
you're lazy thinking and in saying that 

2195
01:36:50,181 --> 01:36:54,260
you're lazy and if that's the type of 
discourse that you pursue,

2196
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:56,120
if that's what you're trying to do,
that's what you're trying.

2197
01:36:56,270 --> 01:36:58,190
That's a lazy way of being a human 
being.

2198
01:36:58,191 --> 01:37:02,780
That's the lazy way of operating and 
incredibly complex neural system.

2199
01:37:03,110 --> 01:37:08,110
That's a lazy way of being a functioning
human being who has given this 

2200
01:37:08,110 --> 01:37:12,341
incredible position of communicating 
with the world because you have 

2201
01:37:12,341 --> 01:37:15,431
responsibilities when you're 
communicating with the world and one of 

2202
01:37:15,431 --> 01:37:18,760
those responsibilities is to express 
yourself to the best of your abilities,

2203
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:20,980
to look at life through the.
What are you doing?

2204
01:37:20,981 --> 01:37:25,981
I'm sorry,
express yourself to the best of your 

2205
01:37:25,981 --> 01:37:29,021
abilities to look at life through the 
most nuanced and objective perspective 

2206
01:37:29,021 --> 01:37:33,340
because you're.
You're going to say some things are 

2207
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:33,340
going to influence a lot of fucking 
people.

2208
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:34,910
How much have you looked at it when her 
case?

2209
01:37:34,911 --> 01:37:37,340
Obviously not so fucking much.
Her Pool Guy,

2210
01:37:37,370 --> 01:37:40,160
she taught us the pool.
The pool was green.

2211
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:41,600
Oh,
you fucking poor,

2212
01:37:41,601 --> 01:37:43,400
baby.
You poor baby.

2213
01:37:43,401 --> 01:37:44,600
Was Your Pool Green?

2214
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:47,570
How do you go on?
How would you go on?

2215
01:37:48,330 --> 01:37:51,920
There's a lot of beautiful people that 
smoke marijuana,

2216
01:37:52,010 --> 01:37:55,410
beautiful spiritually beautiful.
Personality wise,

2217
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:57,930
there's a lot of lazy people that smoke 
marijuana.

2218
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,390
There's a lot of lazy people who don't 
smoke marijuana.

2219
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:02,610
There's a lot of lazy people who drink 
coffee.

2220
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:08,210
It's a tool like any other tool,
it can be used or it can be abused.

2221
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:13,760
You know?
It's like my old joke from one of my 

2222
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:13,760
bits.
You can build a house with marijuana.

2223
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:14,100
You know,
you could,

2224
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:16,890
you could smoke pot and use it to design
things,

2225
01:38:17,430 --> 01:38:19,260
but it's just like a hammer.
You could,

2226
01:38:19,410 --> 01:38:20,670
you know,
you could build a deck with a,

2227
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:22,710
with a hammer,
you could hit nails with a hammer or you

2228
01:38:22,711 --> 01:38:24,600
can hit yourself with a dick if you're 
fucking crazy.

2229
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:26,520
It doesn't mean that hammer should be 
illegal,

2230
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:29,910
right?
You could design furniture on marijuana.

2231
01:38:29,910 --> 01:38:32,580
You could build a fucking airplane on 
marijuana.

2232
01:38:32,581 --> 01:38:34,620
There's a lot of things you could do 
while you're on marijuana.

2233
01:38:34,650 --> 01:38:37,050
He can write a novel on marijuana,
which has been done many times.

2234
01:38:37,051 --> 01:38:42,051
Even king wrote,
almost all his shit was just a lot of 

2235
01:38:42,051 --> 01:38:42,051
coke to.
It's probably a bad example,

2236
01:38:42,051 --> 01:38:43,500
Stephen King on writing,
whether it's a mixed example.

2237
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:45,090
I don't know.
Yeah.

2238
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:50,120
Look,
people should be able to do whatever 

2239
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:50,250
they want to do as long as you're not 
hurting others.

2240
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:53,850
If you're taking marijuana and you wind 
up becoming a fucking rapist.

2241
01:38:53,851 --> 01:38:54,780
If Marilyn,
if there was,

2242
01:38:54,781 --> 01:38:55,950
okay,
let's not say marijuana with.

2243
01:38:55,960 --> 01:39:00,960
There's a cactus flower that people 
found in New Mexico and for some reason 

2244
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:01,080
that makes you a rapist.
Like everybody takes,

2245
01:39:01,081 --> 01:39:02,850
it becomes like a rape Zombie.
Yeah.

2246
01:39:02,851 --> 01:39:04,710
They should probably make that fucking 
thing illegal.

2247
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:05,160
Yeah.
You know,

2248
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,560
you started eating people's faces in 
Miami.

2249
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:09,150
That shy legal.
Yeah.

2250
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:14,210
Well you know what's funny about that?
That was what they started saying was 

2251
01:39:14,210 --> 01:39:17,361
marijuana.
The guy was the Zombie that they said 

2252
01:39:17,361 --> 01:39:17,361
they tested him and he tested positive 
for marijuana.

2253
01:39:17,361 --> 01:39:18,900
That was the only drug he didn't test 
positive for.

2254
01:39:18,901 --> 01:39:20,280
Bath salts.
It's with all the stories,

2255
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:25,530
but this is how piss poor the media is.
And when you're giving out these five to

2256
01:39:25,531 --> 01:39:30,531
seven minute blurbs on information,
well why didn't test positive for bath 

2257
01:39:30,531 --> 01:39:31,890
salts?
Because there's no test for bath salts.

2258
01:39:31,891 --> 01:39:34,830
You fuckhead they don't have a test.
That's interesting.

2259
01:39:34,831 --> 01:39:36,810
So they're just making this shit up.
But what does bath salts,

2260
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:42,260
what about salts with it?
There could be a variety of different 

2261
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:42,260
compounds.
Storage,

2262
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:45,920
just a media term for this.
Exactly what man drug will with these 

2263
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:46,320
man drugs are,
is you take an illegal drug,

2264
01:39:46,321 --> 01:39:48,180
you alter it so that it's no longer 
illegal,

2265
01:39:48,181 --> 01:39:53,181
but it's still as ridiculous effects on 
the human body and then you sell it as 

2266
01:39:53,181 --> 01:39:53,181
not for human consumption.

2267
01:39:53,181 --> 01:39:58,100
It's not just one simple formula.
They don't just take math and add 

2268
01:39:58,100 --> 01:40:01,581
phosphorus to it.
I mean there's a bunch of different 

2269
01:40:01,581 --> 01:40:02,130
versions of these bath salts,
so if you're saying that you didn't test

2270
01:40:02,131 --> 01:40:04,950
positive for back salts,
you're right and you're wrong.

2271
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:06,750
You're right.
He didn't test positive,

2272
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:08,880
but the reason is they don't have a test
for it.

2273
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:11,100
So of course he didn't test positive for
bath salts.

2274
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:16,280
You said a test to a lab.
They're going to test for a bunch of 

2275
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:16,280
different shit.
They're going to look for,

2276
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:16,330
you know,
cocaine.

2277
01:40:16,331 --> 01:40:17,420
They're going to look for alcohol.
They have.

2278
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:19,590
They have a spectrum that they look for 
things in.

2279
01:40:19,591 --> 01:40:24,591
They're not.
Unless you specifically tell them what 

2280
01:40:24,591 --> 01:40:24,750
kind of bath salts,
they're not going to look for that.

2281
01:40:25,370 --> 01:40:30,370
It's not going to be what you know.
It's not going to come up with a check 

2282
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:30,370
mark next to bath salts.

2283
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:33,890
So they tried to blame it on marijuana.
Say this guy smoked pot and eight guys 

2284
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:33,930
face like,
I doesn't happen sometimes.

2285
01:40:33,931 --> 01:40:35,130
Sometimes I'm like,
I want in and out,

2286
01:40:35,131 --> 01:40:40,131
and then I went somebodies face.
What they don't realize is how 

2287
01:40:40,131 --> 01:40:40,590
attractive they made.
We'd after that because people go,

2288
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:42,840
I want the fucking Zombie.
We'd I want that.

2289
01:40:42,841 --> 01:40:45,660
We'd that made the duty to dude's face 
Zombie Kush.

2290
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:48,150
That guy might not be to be able to 
handle it because he's crazy homeless.

2291
01:40:48,151 --> 01:40:53,151
Fuck,
but if you give that Zombie face eating 

2292
01:40:53,151 --> 01:40:53,250
wheat to a regular dude,
he had mad munchies.

2293
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:54,180
Yeah.
He couldn't.

2294
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:59,250
Couldn't even take it anymore because 
get get this dummy off here and I say 

2295
01:40:59,250 --> 01:40:59,250
dummy.
With all due respect,

2296
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:00,670
no need,
no need to have ron anymore.

2297
01:41:00,671 --> 01:41:01,510
It's.
I just,

2298
01:41:01,511 --> 01:41:04,810
I feel bad for her.
I honestly do because I feel bad for the

2299
01:41:04,811 --> 01:41:09,811
viewers.
I think that's going out to people's 

2300
01:41:09,811 --> 01:41:11,731
homes.
These toxins are being pumped into your 

2301
01:41:11,731 --> 01:41:11,731
living room.
She's a middle aged woman.

2302
01:41:11,731 --> 01:41:12,130
You know what I mean?
She's not going to get any better.

2303
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:13,210
It's not gonna.
Get any smarter,

2304
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,920
which,
which is what she is.

2305
01:41:14,921 --> 01:41:16,570
I feel bad if you,
you know,

2306
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:19,930
you've lived your life and accumulated 
information and had life experiences and

2307
01:41:19,931 --> 01:41:21,400
this is the result.
This is who you are.

2308
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:26,550
That's a disaster.
That's a attention seeking missile to a 

2309
01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:30,471
disaster that's destroying lives along 
the way with it's fucking shitty 

2310
01:41:30,471 --> 01:41:32,740
personality.
It's just so unfortunate.

2311
01:41:33,250 --> 01:41:34,450
It's unfortunate for her.

2312
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:39,480
It's unfortunate for the people that 
listen and don't realize how ridiculous 

2313
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:44,311
or opinions really are.
When you look at the actual facts 

2314
01:41:44,311 --> 01:41:45,310
themselves,
it's the anti anti marijuana rhetoric.

2315
01:41:45,311 --> 01:41:46,900
It's just.
It's so stupid.

2316
01:41:47,290 --> 01:41:47,800
The.
Yeah,

2317
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:52,801
there's.
There's definitely problems with people 

2318
01:41:52,801 --> 01:41:54,601
using marijuana,
but there's problems with people use 

2319
01:41:54,601 --> 01:41:54,601
toothpaste.
There's problems with people using glue.

2320
01:41:54,601 --> 01:41:55,840
They take glue,
they sniff it and they go,

2321
01:41:55,841 --> 01:41:57,790
fucking crazy.
People are nuts,

2322
01:41:57,791 --> 01:42:02,791
man.
There's 7 billion of us on this planet 

2323
01:42:02,791 --> 01:42:02,791
and there's a certain percentage of us 
that can't handle anything.

2324
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:07,920
Why?
Because they were raised poor because 

2325
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:08,410
the race in a poor manner,
shitty I should say,

2326
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:11,500
because their genetics are poor because 
they're.

2327
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:16,520
They have birth defects because there's 
environmental hazards because they have 

2328
01:42:16,520 --> 01:42:18,280
disease is because fill in the life 
experiences,

2329
01:42:18,281 --> 01:42:22,090
fill in a traumatic childhood.
Incidences fill it in,

2330
01:42:22,091 --> 01:42:27,091
fill it in for why they're fucked up,
but a human being is a very complex 

2331
01:42:27,091 --> 01:42:29,560
puzzle that doesn't always come together
correctly.

2332
01:42:29,710 --> 01:42:34,710
It just doesn't.
There's a lot of factors that have to 

2333
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:34,710
do,
you know,

2334
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:36,820
that have to fall into place to make a 
David Seaman to make a guy can come on a

2335
01:42:36,821 --> 01:42:41,821
podcast and be articulate and express 
information and have all this stuff in 

2336
01:42:41,821 --> 01:42:45,571
his head.
You have to have a lot of factors in 

2337
01:42:45,571 --> 01:42:45,571
place,
not it doesn't always work out that way.

2338
01:42:45,571 --> 01:42:47,710
It's one of the beautiful things about 
running across a guy like you or a cross

2339
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:52,850
and anyone who's got their shit together
because it's not easy or you and your 

2340
01:42:52,850 --> 01:42:55,420
podcast just attracting a million 
listeners and building up something.

2341
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,310
You didn't do this with a network 
backing.

2342
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,830
It was just your own thing and it grew 
over time.

2343
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:02,200
We also did cool.
Didn't do it,

2344
01:43:02,201 --> 01:43:04,390
trying to do it.
That's part of the,

2345
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:05,110
you know,
we,

2346
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:10,250
when we had these discussions,
there was nobody listening so we just 

2347
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:13,060
expressed are our thoughts and it allows
you a platform to explore,

2348
01:43:13,810 --> 01:43:18,810
but these,
these like five minute blurbs where 

2349
01:43:18,810 --> 01:43:22,051
people run on and start arguments on 
television just to try to get people to 

2350
01:43:22,051 --> 01:43:22,060
buy their book.

2351
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:24,850
It's the silent movies,
man.

2352
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,980
That's some old shit that doesn't work 
anymore.

2353
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:32,160
The world is complicated and a five 
minute conversation on a very complex 

2354
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:36,160
issue that has a massive social impact.
Massive,

2355
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:38,890
both positive and negative,
like everything,

2356
01:43:39,070 --> 01:43:41,110
like every fucking good thing in this 
life.

2357
01:43:41,111 --> 01:43:43,720
Driving has a positive and negative 
effect.

2358
01:43:43,870 --> 01:43:48,870
I am not going to stop driving.
I like being able to get somewhere 

2359
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:49,300
quicker than walking,
but driving kills people.

2360
01:43:49,301 --> 01:43:51,560
There's car accidents,
you're breathing in brake dust.

2361
01:43:51,561 --> 01:43:56,561
If you live in a fucking city,
forget about the pollution from the 

2362
01:43:56,561 --> 01:43:56,780
engines.
There's no free lunch.

2363
01:43:57,110 --> 01:44:02,110
Everything has a plus and a minus,
but it's our job as human beings to to 

2364
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:06,140
have a balanced approach and here's 
what's not good.

2365
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:11,200
Suppressing and making something illegal
that's beneficial to millions of people 

2366
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:14,270
and if there's any lesson to be learned 
from prohibition,

2367
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:19,540
it's the rise of organized crime because
when you turn regular people into 

2368
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:20,870
criminals,
the criminals are going to provide those

2369
01:44:20,871 --> 01:44:24,740
regular people with drugs and it's going
to be on taxed.

2370
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:26,120
Unregulated

2371
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:28,260
definitely.
And then they just corrupt the officials

2372
01:44:28,261 --> 01:44:33,261
and the whole thing becomes its own 
little environment and it gets 

2373
01:44:33,261 --> 01:44:37,221
entrenched and that's what you have is 
now you have powerful cartels that want 

2374
01:44:37,221 --> 01:44:41,091
to keep it illegal so they continue to 
so they can continue to make money off 

2375
01:44:41,091 --> 01:44:41,091
of it.

2376
01:44:41,091 --> 01:44:41,330
Yeah.
And I don't really hate and culture.

2377
01:44:41,331 --> 01:44:43,320
I have nothing against that woman.
I feel bad for her.

2378
01:44:43,321 --> 01:44:45,710
I feel bad that she's that person now.
I really do.

2379
01:44:46,150 --> 01:44:51,050
I feel bad for anybody that's in that 
position because that's such an easy for

2380
01:44:51,051 --> 01:44:56,051
a person who has experienced life 
through as much of an objective lens as 

2381
01:44:57,111 --> 01:44:59,320
you can and you see a person like that 
that's a.

2382
01:44:59,450 --> 01:45:04,450
that's not a person who's at their best.
That's not a person who has done a lot 

2383
01:45:04,450 --> 01:45:09,131
of soul searching,
a lot of thinking and it's come to this 

2384
01:45:09,131 --> 01:45:09,131
really peaceful,
loving conclusion.

2385
01:45:09,131 --> 01:45:10,760
That's a silly person.
That's silly.

2386
01:45:10,761 --> 01:45:12,480
Person has to be themselves and live 
with their own

2387
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:14,540
Mary's every night.
That's not fun.

2388
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:15,650
Yeah,
she's not that.

2389
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:20,730
She's not having a fun life when you're 
talking about how he lived in a fucked 

2390
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:20,730
up world and people do crazy stuff and 
you know,

2391
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:22,410
things are mixed.
Uh,

2392
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:26,720
I wrote this article the other day that 
a lot of my readers didn't like,

2393
01:45:26,721 --> 01:45:31,721
but I think it's one of the better 
things I've ever written and it's where 

2394
01:45:31,721 --> 01:45:34,361
I take this angle where I'm like,
what if President Obama is right about 

2395
01:45:34,361 --> 01:45:34,361
most of this stuff?
You know,

2396
01:45:34,361 --> 01:45:36,650
like he's doing a lot of stuff that is 
arguably not constitutional.

2397
01:45:37,190 --> 01:45:42,190
However,
there are 7 billion people on the 

2398
01:45:42,190 --> 01:45:44,741
planet.
A lot of them are driven by hateful 

2399
01:45:44,741 --> 01:45:45,890
ideology and certain parts of the world.
And in a nuclear age,

2400
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:49,070
it only takes one of them.
It doesn't even take a nuke.

2401
01:45:49,071 --> 01:45:50,310
It takes another nine slash 11.
Like,

2402
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:55,600
I mean,
I guess going from Ann Coulter did nine 

2403
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:55,600
slash 11 is natural.

2404
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:55,880
But,
uh,

2405
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:59,030
I can start to see the other side of the
whole argument.

2406
01:45:59,031 --> 01:46:04,031
And I think you have to be able to do 
that if you're doing the kind of work 

2407
01:46:04,031 --> 01:46:06,251
that I do is I have to see where people,
like General Keith Alexander are coming 

2408
01:46:06,251 --> 01:46:07,580
from,
which is the argument that we can't,

2409
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:11,330
sorry that we're looking for your text 
messages that sucks Boohoo,

2410
01:46:11,660 --> 01:46:13,940
but we're not going to allow another 
nine slash 11 to happen because we don't

2411
01:46:13,941 --> 01:46:18,941
want to have 3000 innocent people die 
and have the economy crashed and have 

2412
01:46:18,941 --> 01:46:21,830
total chaos for the next five years.
And so I can see things in that light.

2413
01:46:21,831 --> 01:46:24,380
And I wrote this article coming from 
that place of,

2414
01:46:24,430 --> 01:46:29,430
you know,
he's kept us safe and I realized that's 

2415
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:30,530
a total Bush era argument and it's the 
kind of thing that I normally despise.

2416
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:35,860
But you have to be willing to explore 
that and explore the fact that it's the 

2417
01:46:35,860 --> 01:46:36,440
year 2014 now,
uh,

2418
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:41,620
he's been in office since January 2009.
And you have these fear mongers and the 

2419
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:46,331
alternative media who,
people who I don't want to disc because 

2420
01:46:46,331 --> 01:46:47,210
I do their shows and they do mine.
But uh,

2421
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:48,740
you know,
people like Alex Jones,

2422
01:46:48,741 --> 01:46:52,530
basically it's fucking 2014.
Like if what you're saying is true,

2423
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:57,531
why are you not in a gulag somewhere?
Why aren't you in a fucking dungeon 

2424
01:46:57,531 --> 01:46:58,230
tower being tortured by homeland 
security

2425
01:46:58,650 --> 01:47:03,650
for one thing,
he's easily dismissed because he's so 

2426
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:03,650
crazy.
I mean,

2427
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:05,460
you could pull up a million videos of 
him screaming and ranting and raving and

2428
01:47:05,461 --> 01:47:06,930
you just dismiss him right away.

2429
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:09,030
But my,
my point though is like Obama is not the

2430
01:47:09,031 --> 01:47:11,940
boogeyman that he's been made out to be.
I think that what he is,

2431
01:47:11,941 --> 01:47:16,941
is somebody who's trying to do the best 
they can within an extremely fucked up 

2432
01:47:16,941 --> 01:47:21,501
and flawed and piece together system 
that is dealing with like 15 different 

2433
01:47:21,501 --> 01:47:22,020
entities at once.
You know,

2434
01:47:22,021 --> 01:47:24,750
like whenever the dea breaks in 
somebody's door,

2435
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:30,140
that's not because Obama.
Obama's like sitting in the White House 

2436
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:30,140
on his ipad and he's like,
Oh yeah,

2437
01:47:30,140 --> 01:47:30,390
let's go to this guy's house.
Right?

2438
01:47:30,391 --> 01:47:34,230
Like he's got other things on his mind 
and yet we link all this to Obama and we

2439
01:47:34,231 --> 01:47:39,231
should instead be trying to modernize 
the whole fucking system so that Obama 

2440
01:47:39,231 --> 01:47:39,231
has less to do.

2441
01:47:39,231 --> 01:47:43,430
Well,
I think there's a very good point in 

2442
01:47:43,430 --> 01:47:43,430
that and I agree with you on looking at 
the other perspective.

2443
01:47:43,430 --> 01:47:46,200
I think that's very important and people
are very reluctant to do that.

2444
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:47,550
People are very.

2445
01:47:47,890 --> 01:47:52,890
It's one of the hardest things to do was
hard for me to write this article 

2446
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:52,890
because I'm like,
fuck,

2447
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:52,890
I'm like defending everything that I 
don't believe,

2448
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:57,700
but you're not.
You're exploring that idea and I think 

2449
01:47:57,700 --> 01:47:57,700
you should be allowed to explore an 
idea.

2450
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:01,811
I think it's important to be able to 
explore an idea and people on the left 

2451
01:48:01,811 --> 01:48:01,811
are people that are,
you know,

2452
01:48:01,811 --> 01:48:06,670
anti war or in rightly so.
They would like reject that 

2453
01:48:06,670 --> 01:48:09,800
instantaneously.
But I think that to get to know what you

2454
01:48:09,801 --> 01:48:11,440
really have to explore it.
I think to,

2455
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:12,760
to,
to look at the,

2456
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:18,060
the holes in the argument,
even to look at it from a defensive 

2457
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:21,161
point of view,
you have to explore it and look at it 

2458
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:21,161
from their point of view to understand 
them.

2459
01:48:21,170 --> 01:48:24,980
I think that I would agree with you in a
lot of ways that Obama,

2460
01:48:24,981 --> 01:48:25,990
Obama,
who's,

2461
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:31,000
that Obama has one of the most thankless
jobs ever and it's unbelievably fucked 

2462
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:35,981
up situation to try to deal with however
he's lied about things and I have issue 

2463
01:48:35,981 --> 01:48:40,821
with that.
I have issue with the lying about the 

2464
01:48:40,821 --> 01:48:40,821
NSA collecting metadata like that.
I mean,

2465
01:48:40,821 --> 01:48:43,040
how long did you think that that was 
going to stay a lie?

2466
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:48,320
I mean that,
that was gonna sit out there before 

2467
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:48,320
people found out.
I mean,

2468
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,150
people exposed to that was not true 
within days.

2469
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:51,050
And

2470
01:48:51,240 --> 01:48:53,730
there's a new one that's out today.
I wrote down,

2471
01:48:53,731 --> 01:48:54,900
don't go negative,
but,

2472
01:48:54,901 --> 01:48:59,901
uh,
there's a new NSA snowden document that 

2473
01:48:59,901 --> 01:49:02,160
the NSA and the GCHQ,
which is the British version of it.

2474
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,410
Uh,
I guess the British government's NSA,

2475
01:49:04,411 --> 01:49:05,490
pretty much.
Uh,

2476
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:10,520
they have this whole a procedural thing 
for how to go after activists that they 

2477
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:12,930
don't like and harass them using troll 
identities,

2478
01:49:12,931 --> 01:49:17,160
like literally their slideshows,
showing how NSA agents troll people they

2479
01:49:17,161 --> 01:49:22,161
don't like online and destroy their 
credibility and reputation and this is 

2480
01:49:22,161 --> 01:49:26,361
shit that even a week ago to say this 
would be like kind of out there because 

2481
01:49:26,361 --> 01:49:26,361
like,
sure,

2482
01:49:26,361 --> 01:49:28,260
like maybe governments troll people,
but you can't say with authority,

2483
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:31,500
like the US government and the British 
government or trolling people they don't

2484
01:49:31,501 --> 01:49:35,010
like now we know that this is a fact and
that's something that needs to be reined

2485
01:49:35,011 --> 01:49:37,890
in because that's not,
you're not paying for that because we're

2486
01:49:37,891 --> 01:49:42,891
paying for this crazy district.
We're paying for some antisocial 

2487
01:49:42,891 --> 01:49:46,161
sociopath's to get a paycheck every two 
weeks from the federal government to 

2488
01:49:46,161 --> 01:49:47,590
fucking do crazy stuff on the internet.
It's so funny,

2489
01:49:47,591 --> 01:49:47,980
man.

2490
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:50,710
It's so funny.
It's just hilarious that they've.

2491
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:51,920
I mean,
think about what is the,

2492
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:53,800
that job.
I want that job by the way.

2493
01:49:53,850 --> 01:49:57,040
I want the lowest form of life on online
troll.

2494
01:49:57,060 --> 01:49:58,050
Yeah.
And that's what,

2495
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:02,170
that's what the government does role.
I mean,

2496
01:50:02,410 --> 01:50:05,300
it's hilarious and it only works if you 
pay a attention,

2497
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:08,530
but you know,
if there's enough people working for the

2498
01:50:08,531 --> 01:50:09,700
government,
they're trying to discredit you,

2499
01:50:09,701 --> 01:50:12,610
I'm sure they could put a good dent in 
public perception of you,

2500
01:50:12,611 --> 01:50:17,611
but I think that's,
I would say that's not what you're 

2501
01:50:17,611 --> 01:50:17,611
supposed to be doing if you're a fucking
government.

2502
01:50:17,611 --> 01:50:19,330
Alright,
you're supposed to be in a government is

2503
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:23,650
one of the things.
It's sort of a lot of ways like what you

2504
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:26,140
shouldn't do when you argue with trolls 
online,

2505
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:28,270
like you shouldn't do that because you 
know,

2506
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:31,240
you just got to accept the fact that 
you're in an unusual position.

2507
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:36,660
Well,
the government's in an unusual position 

2508
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:38,581
to Obama with that.
He was basically getting trolled by 

2509
01:50:38,581 --> 01:50:40,210
Snowden for a little while.
Like I was watching this and I was like,

2510
01:50:40,211 --> 01:50:45,211
it's absolutely ridiculous for a US 
president to be lowering himself to the 

2511
01:50:45,211 --> 01:50:48,670
level of a 29 year old freelance 
contractor for some defense company.

2512
01:50:48,770 --> 01:50:50,850
How is he.
In what way was he going to.

2513
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:53,350
By addressing the issue and making it 
seem like,

2514
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:58,520
you know,
snowden's the problem with it should've 

2515
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:58,520
been is immediately the second this shit
came out.

2516
01:50:58,520 --> 01:51:02,620
If I were one of Obama's advisors,
I would suggest just be honest with you,

2517
01:51:02,621 --> 01:51:05,110
will be like,
it looks like some stuff went overboard.

2518
01:51:05,290 --> 01:51:07,420
There were some things that should not 
have been occurring.

2519
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:10,960
I'll put an end to it,
will appoint a panel to look into it.

2520
01:51:10,961 --> 01:51:14,320
It's not what America is about and we 
went overboard because we didn't want to

2521
01:51:14,321 --> 01:51:19,321
see another nine slash 11 happened and 
so of course some programs crop up over 

2522
01:51:19,321 --> 01:51:20,620
time to keep you safe and some of the 
shit is unconstitutional.

2523
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:22,270
We'll fix it.
And most people,

2524
01:51:22,271 --> 01:51:25,270
I'd say like 99 point nine,
nine percent of people including myself,

2525
01:51:25,630 --> 01:51:26,400
would have been like,
you know what?

2526
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:27,790
Job Well done.
You know,

2527
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:29,590
we don't need to fixate on this fucking 
thing,

2528
01:51:30,110 --> 01:51:32,520
but Jones instead,
it was like a manhunt.

2529
01:51:32,521 --> 01:51:37,521
It's like the plane was forced to the 
ground somewhere and to search for 

2530
01:51:37,521 --> 01:51:38,290
snowden and it's been in the news for 
months.

2531
01:51:38,291 --> 01:51:39,160
Like,
what is this?

2532
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:40,630
It's ridiculous.
Yeah.

2533
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:41,740
Well,
it's also,

2534
01:51:41,741 --> 01:51:46,480
what did he do that's so terrible.
He released information about crimes.

2535
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:48,850
Yeah.
I mean if you look at what is law,

2536
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:50,500
what is law in this country?
Well,

2537
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:55,620
there are laws and there are precedents 
that have been set way back to when the 

2538
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:57,910
founding fathers had no idea were ever 
going to have a fucking internet.

2539
01:51:58,150 --> 01:52:03,150
They had certain laws that were in place
in order to make sure that people's 

2540
01:52:03,150 --> 01:52:04,630
rights are protected and that the 
government doesn't get out.

2541
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:09,630
I got a hand that law enforcement 
doesn't get out of hand because people 

2542
01:52:09,630 --> 01:52:11,020
who have ultimate power,
it corrupts them.

2543
01:52:11,080 --> 01:52:12,230
It's just.
It always has.

2544
01:52:12,231 --> 01:52:15,670
It's had since the beginning of time,
whether it's a fucking security guard at

2545
01:52:15,671 --> 01:52:20,671
a mall or whether it's the president of 
United States power is a corrupting 

2546
01:52:20,671 --> 01:52:24,091
thing and these laws in place,
they circumvented those laws.

2547
01:52:24,220 --> 01:52:27,460
They changed those laws.
They pass things like the NDA.

2548
01:52:27,610 --> 01:52:32,610
They pass things like the Patriot Act.
They pass all these things to make laws 

2549
01:52:32,610 --> 01:52:32,920
that are in place to protect people's 
rights.

2550
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:36,460
Invalid.
Make the fourth amendment invalid and so

2551
01:52:36,461 --> 01:52:40,450
then they feel justified by doing what 
is essentially a crime.

2552
01:52:40,600 --> 01:52:42,280
Well guy comes out and says,
Hey,

2553
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:46,160
a crime is being committed on 300 
million people

2554
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:51,160
in this country and multiple millions 
worldwide by a group of Americans who 

2555
01:52:52,041 --> 01:52:55,670
didn't get a license to do this by any 
voting,

2556
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:59,210
by any court of public opinion.
These are unelected officials.

2557
01:52:59,211 --> 01:53:01,340
This is scholars,
this is Bob Smith,

2558
01:53:01,341 --> 01:53:06,341
and suburban Virginia is looking,
looking through your emails potentially 

2559
01:53:06,341 --> 01:53:07,760
if they just have the power to do so,
so because they have the power to do so.

2560
01:53:07,761 --> 01:53:10,430
The acted on it and that's crime.
That is a crime.

2561
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:15,550
We have laws.
So what snowden did was calling him a 

2562
01:53:15,550 --> 01:53:18,080
trader is one of the most disgusting 
labels you could ever label.

2563
01:53:18,230 --> 01:53:23,230
A guy who took his own life and 
sacrificed to safety and security in 

2564
01:53:24,201 --> 01:53:27,830
order to enlighten the millions of 
people that are crime is going on.

2565
01:53:28,310 --> 01:53:33,310
I mean,
he's a modern Paul revere times a 

2566
01:53:33,310 --> 01:53:33,310
million.
I agree.

2567
01:53:33,310 --> 01:53:35,120
I agree.
And he had a nice life in Hawaii.

2568
01:53:35,121 --> 01:53:39,350
He had the dancer girlfriend and he's 
making good money for a 29 year old.

2569
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:42,870
Now he's under the fucking the 
crosshairs.

2570
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:45,410
He's in the cross hairs now.
He didn't have to do that.

2571
01:53:45,411 --> 01:53:48,350
He made a choice and he's definitely not
an attention seeker.

2572
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,120
Don't think Putin's not hooking them up 
though.

2573
01:53:50,390 --> 01:53:54,080
You think you're talking about with some
Russian slowly Mowgli,

2574
01:53:54,290 --> 01:53:55,410
Russian chicks,
Russians.

2575
01:53:55,411 --> 01:53:57,080
Chicks are probably way harder than 
that.

2576
01:53:57,081 --> 01:53:58,220
Check.
He was banging in Hawaii.

2577
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:01,690
He's probably got some evil Russian 
liver steel and chicks,

2578
01:54:01,691 --> 01:54:06,691
the kind.
You fuck them and you'd get all groggy 

2579
01:54:06,691 --> 01:54:06,691
and you wake up in a hostel.
Yeah,

2580
01:54:06,691 --> 01:54:09,860
we're in a tub filled with ice.
I don't know.

2581
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:10,260
I mean,
I,

2582
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:11,810
I don't know what's really going on with
him,

2583
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:13,370
but uh,
if I had to guess,

2584
01:54:13,371 --> 01:54:16,820
I think they take care of him.
I think he's probably.

2585
01:54:16,821 --> 01:54:18,240
Okay.
Well think about it.

2586
01:54:18,241 --> 01:54:19,880
If,
if there were like a,

2587
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:23,430
if it were a Russian snowden and he came
to the US,

2588
01:54:23,570 --> 01:54:24,560
we would totally hook him up.

2589
01:54:24,590 --> 01:54:29,590
We'd make them go into NASA.
The US government would be singing his 

2590
01:54:29,590 --> 01:54:32,741
praises every day.
It's kind of creepy when you realize 

2591
01:54:32,741 --> 01:54:35,051
that that does happen.
They do steal like scientists and they 

2592
01:54:35,051 --> 01:54:35,051
steal like,
oh,

2593
01:54:35,051 --> 01:54:38,801
we're all competing with each other.
Like the US is one of the major super 

2594
01:54:38,801 --> 01:54:41,981
powers and we're in this dystopian novel
right now where everybody is spying on 

2595
01:54:41,981 --> 01:54:43,380
everybody else.
We have satellites and uh,

2596
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:48,520
I think the US is the least evil of the 
superpowers by far and the most 

2597
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:52,121
promising one,
but we should still hold ourselves to 

2598
01:54:52,121 --> 01:54:54,311
the highest standard,
but shouldn't it be like vicious about 

2599
01:54:54,311 --> 01:54:57,101
it?
I think there's just a lot of 

2600
01:54:57,101 --> 01:54:58,250
incompetence.
I think that's a lot of what leads to 

2601
01:54:58,250 --> 01:55:00,731
these evil decisions and behaviors,
so things to think about how this stuff 

2602
01:55:00,731 --> 01:55:03,971
is doing their job and all this stuff is
getting out these lame powerpoint 

2603
01:55:03,971 --> 01:55:03,971
slides.

2604
01:55:03,971 --> 01:55:04,730
It feels like something from the office,
you know,

2605
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:08,330
like the bullet points are like go after
the activists damage their credibility,

2606
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:12,170
bring it up a search for.
I'm on dirt,

2607
01:55:12,210 --> 01:55:13,710
that's the website.
It's dirt.

2608
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:18,760
Some tech blog and one of their top 
articles right now is about the NSA 

2609
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:19,640
thing.
They have the actual slides.

2610
01:55:19,660 --> 01:55:24,660
Oh No,
you got to see some of these because 

2611
01:55:24,660 --> 01:55:27,311
it's so like,
it's just the combination of evil and 

2612
01:55:27,311 --> 01:55:27,311
mundane.
This,

2613
01:55:27,311 --> 01:55:28,190
that is just weird,
you know,

2614
01:55:28,191 --> 01:55:33,191
because it's people making these things 
and people making these policies and 

2615
01:55:33,191 --> 01:55:35,600
it's just incredibly vicious stuff.
That's so hilarious.

2616
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:37,330
It really is hilarious.
It's,

2617
01:55:37,670 --> 01:55:42,670
it's hilarious how incompetent they are 
and in a lot of ways it's almost like 

2618
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:44,130
it's on purpose.
It's like the whole thing is being

2619
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:45,910
done on purpose.
Maybe they're not incompetent.

2620
01:55:45,940 --> 01:55:50,940
I was thinking about this too,
how the government puts across this 

2621
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:50,940
image like,
oh,

2622
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:55,011
we're just a bunch of bumbling morons.
We shut down the government because we 

2623
01:55:55,011 --> 01:55:56,040
couldn't agree to something.
We don't know what's going on.

2624
01:55:56,041 --> 01:56:00,690
And meanwhile you have the NSA has these
protocols for harassing people were very

2625
01:56:00,691 --> 01:56:02,880
smart at some level,
like we know there.

2626
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:07,020
Those are the slides.
It's so funny.

2627
01:56:07,290 --> 01:56:10,740
Leak confidential information to 
companies,

2628
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:13,170
the press via blogs,
etc.

2629
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:16,830
Post negative information on appropriate
forums,

2630
01:56:16,890 --> 01:56:19,950
appropriate forums,
stopped deals,

2631
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:24,900
ruin business relationships.
Isn't that set uP a honey trap?

2632
01:56:25,510 --> 01:56:27,780
We'll get that set up.
A honey trap.

2633
01:56:27,781 --> 01:56:32,781
What are you going to do?
It sounds like the stuff they did to 

2634
01:56:32,781 --> 01:56:34,200
assign a damaged credibility hook him up
with a girl.

2635
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:35,160
Oh yeah.
Well,

2636
01:56:35,161 --> 01:56:37,200
what exactly did happen with the 
sausage?

2637
01:56:37,201 --> 01:56:42,201
I mean,
what for folks who don't realize he's 

2638
01:56:42,201 --> 01:56:42,840
not in,
if you don't know juliana songs is,

2639
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:44,850
he's in the west,
which embassy?

2640
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:48,360
Some south american and some south 
american embassy I should know,

2641
01:56:48,361 --> 01:56:49,530
but I forget.
I should know too.

2642
01:56:49,550 --> 01:56:54,550
Um,
but he's not there because of what he 

2643
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:55,110
did by leaking all that information.
In fact,

2644
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:58,020
that's not really a crime that you could
get a guy on.

2645
01:56:58,370 --> 01:56:59,180
I mean it's,
it's just,

2646
01:56:59,190 --> 01:57:00,900
it's,
it's not the same kind of crime.

2647
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:06,260
The reason why they've got him held 
hostage is because they say that he had 

2648
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:10,671
secret or surprise sex with a woman,
which means he had sex with her while 

2649
01:57:10,671 --> 01:57:11,400
they were wearing a comment.
Condoms.

2650
01:57:11,410 --> 01:57:16,410
She agreed to it.
And then while they're in bed 

2651
01:57:16,410 --> 01:57:18,411
afterwards,
I guess they were both naked and he 

2652
01:57:18,411 --> 01:57:20,871
stuck it in without a condom.
He pulled the creeper switcheroo and 

2653
01:57:20,871 --> 01:57:21,970
that's surprised sex.
I guess that's.

2654
01:57:21,990 --> 01:57:24,690
It doesn't even sound like a real thing.
Like how is that?

2655
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:26,160
What does that sound like?

2656
01:57:26,160 --> 01:57:31,160
A real gentle attention.
I mean like how does that require being 

2657
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:32,250
on the books?
Surprise.

2658
01:57:32,251 --> 01:57:34,770
So I don't know man.
It's,

2659
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:40,100
it's confusing as fuck that.
That could actually be something that 

2660
01:57:40,100 --> 01:57:43,911
they could hold a guy in an embassy for.
How many years now have been there for 

2661
01:57:44,470 --> 01:57:45,410
longer than a year?
Long time.

2662
01:57:45,550 --> 01:57:47,820
It's got to be kind of like trying to be
in the same place.

2663
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:49,140
Oh,
it's got to be brutal.

2664
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:51,600
It's probably,
it probably drive you fucking crazy.

2665
01:57:51,870 --> 01:57:54,240
It probably will.
I probably really will drive you fucking

2666
01:57:54,241 --> 01:57:56,400
crazy.
That poor bastard.

2667
01:57:56,700 --> 01:57:57,720
Okay.
Stuck.

2668
01:57:58,200 --> 01:58:00,240
He's stuck there and he probably will 
die there.

2669
01:58:00,241 --> 01:58:01,570
They'll probably make sure he dies 
there.

2670
01:58:02,330 --> 01:58:05,670
A vitamin that can be crazy if he's 
there like 20 years from now,

2671
01:58:05,671 --> 01:58:10,671
30 years from now.
I think some president will probably 

2672
01:58:10,671 --> 01:58:12,330
like part time or something.
You think so it would hopefully way,

2673
01:58:12,331 --> 01:58:17,331
way,
way in the future for that to president 

2674
01:58:17,331 --> 01:58:17,331
snowden and like 20,
45 months.

2675
01:58:18,230 --> 01:58:22,800
Miley president miley cyrus president.
mildly in two years or no,

2676
01:58:22,860 --> 01:58:24,630
she's got to be what?
Like 45 years old or something?

2677
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:25,920
Yeah.
Got to be in your thirties,

2678
01:58:26,220 --> 01:58:27,450
36,
isn't it?

2679
01:58:27,630 --> 01:58:28,620
To be president,
something like that.

2680
01:58:28,810 --> 01:58:32,490
Somewhere I'm just hurts.
It just hurts.

2681
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:34,290
It just hurts that.
It's that transparent.

2682
01:58:34,620 --> 01:58:39,570
It hurts that were that bad that after 
all these years of human civilization,

2683
01:58:39,571 --> 01:58:41,290
all these years,
since the printing press,

2684
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:42,280
all these years,

2685
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:44,920
since newspapers all these years,
it's television now.

2686
01:58:44,921 --> 01:58:47,530
All these years of the internet.
It's still that transparent.

2687
01:58:47,531 --> 01:58:48,100
It's still that

2688
01:58:48,730 --> 01:58:53,730
I gotta tell you though,
like I've been thinking lately about 

2689
01:58:53,730 --> 01:58:54,760
seeing those images from Ukraine of all 
of these people.

2690
01:58:54,761 --> 01:58:57,330
Bloody and they went total,
uh,

2691
01:58:57,510 --> 01:58:59,890
like completely off the civilization 
map.

2692
01:58:59,891 --> 01:59:03,340
Just chaos burning stuff,
brother against brother,

2693
01:59:03,341 --> 01:59:06,100
like really dark shit over there.
And uh,

2694
01:59:06,130 --> 01:59:08,800
they threw out their president,
I believe,

2695
01:59:09,730 --> 01:59:13,090
and he's on the run or something.
But it makes me wonder,

2696
01:59:13,091 --> 01:59:18,091
like maybe some of this stuff that we 
sense as being really oppressive is 

2697
01:59:18,091 --> 01:59:20,260
necessary for society to just hold 
together.

2698
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:25,440
Like if we didn't have the occasional 
situation where the government comes 

2699
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,940
down hard on somebody that things would 
just slowly disintegrate and we will get

2700
01:59:27,941 --> 01:59:30,220
to a place where you walk into fedex and
nobody wants to.

2701
01:59:30,760 --> 01:59:35,760
Nobody wants to check you out because 
there's not enough of thIs kind of 

2702
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,060
cohesive societal thing.

2703
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:42,510
Well,
that's sort of the thinking that there 

2704
01:59:42,510 --> 01:59:43,090
has to be a yin and a yang.
there has to be a good and an evil.

2705
01:59:43,091 --> 01:59:47,170
There has to be suppression and this 
desire to escape suppression in order to

2706
01:59:47,171 --> 01:59:52,171
create momentum and energy and in order 
to to enthusiastically encouraged 

2707
01:59:52,841 --> 01:59:57,841
innovation,
you have to be fighting against 

2708
01:59:57,841 --> 01:59:57,841
something.
You have to be battling against them.

2709
01:59:57,841 --> 01:59:57,960
Yeah.
It's almost like to discover freedom,

2710
01:59:57,961 --> 01:59:59,970
you have to face a little bit of 
oppression.

2711
02:00:00,380 --> 02:00:02,380
Yeah.
There's a lot of thinking behind that,

2712
02:00:02,381 --> 02:00:07,381
that that's sort of the way the universe
works and that there's hunters and then 

2713
02:00:07,381 --> 02:00:07,430
there's prey there.
You know,

2714
02:00:07,431 --> 02:00:09,710
there's lions and then there's gazelles 
and that.

2715
02:00:09,711 --> 02:00:14,711
This is just sort of the way the world 
works in order for the gazelles to stay 

2716
02:00:14,711 --> 02:00:15,830
alive and keep reading.
They have to realize a lion coming after

2717
02:00:15,831 --> 02:00:17,540
them because if there was,
you know,

2718
02:00:17,650 --> 02:00:20,000
because gazelles could just hang out and
live in one spot.

2719
02:00:20,001 --> 02:00:22,650
They'd probably eat themselves silly.
They'd fucked so much.

2720
02:00:22,651 --> 02:00:24,770
There'd be too many of them.
Then they'd all die of starvation.

2721
02:00:25,100 --> 02:00:28,760
There would be no food left.
I mean it's almost like you need both.

2722
02:00:28,940 --> 02:00:31,060
You need a good and a bad and he did a 
night and a day.

2723
02:00:31,070 --> 02:00:36,070
You need a winter and a summer.
You need a whole fucking lot of 

2724
02:00:36,070 --> 02:00:36,070
different things to come into play.

2725
02:00:36,070 --> 02:00:40,780
Yeah,
well that's what I'm starting to think 

2726
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:42,701
is kind of evolving my views on this 
stuff because I think that government 

2727
02:00:42,701 --> 02:00:46,990
serves as a kind of immune system 
against shit like what happened in 

2728
02:00:46,990 --> 02:00:49,991
Ukraine and what's happening in parts of
south America now where people are just 

2729
02:00:49,991 --> 02:00:53,060
losing it and you can't let that happen.
You just can't,

2730
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:54,020
you know,
because the results,

2731
02:00:54,021 --> 02:00:59,021
you don't know where it ends and it 
seems like at least the example with 

2732
02:00:59,021 --> 02:00:59,021
Egypt,
it ends in a bad place.

2733
02:00:59,021 --> 02:01:03,701
You go from something that really sucks 
to something that's unimaginably worse 

2734
02:01:03,701 --> 02:01:05,330
and even more oppressive because you can
only go from oppression,

2735
02:01:05,380 --> 02:01:10,380
the chaos to more oppression.
It's very rare what the United States 

2736
02:01:10,380 --> 02:01:12,140
did with our founding and the 
constitution and the bill of rights.

2737
02:01:12,141 --> 02:01:14,690
These are very rare things that don't 
happen all that often.

2738
02:01:15,150 --> 02:01:17,370
Interesting that we don't realize we 
don't.

2739
02:01:17,390 --> 02:01:20,960
We didn't observe and learn from what 
what,

2740
02:01:20,990 --> 02:01:24,380
what did we try to escape and what did 
we pull off in trying to escape,

2741
02:01:24,650 --> 02:01:29,650
but what we pulled off is the greatest 
startup civilization the world has ever 

2742
02:01:29,650 --> 02:01:30,260
known from.
I mean,

2743
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:35,290
without a doubt,
there's never been a time in human 

2744
02:01:35,290 --> 02:01:38,141
history where within 300 years less of a
country being formed is become dominant 

2745
02:01:39,561 --> 02:01:43,190
superpower on earth,
not not just in a roman sort of a way,

2746
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:47,240
not in a gang is con sort of a way,
but in a truly global way.

2747
02:01:47,870 --> 02:01:51,140
And now we find out is spying on 
everybody as well.

2748
02:01:51,290 --> 02:01:56,290
Has missiles all over the world sending 
drones into places where they're not 

2749
02:01:56,290 --> 02:01:58,940
supposed to invade.
So we send flying robots to do our dirty

2750
02:01:58,941 --> 02:02:03,941
work for us.
What mean it's the most insane 

2751
02:02:03,941 --> 02:02:07,060
dictatorship or the most insane 
government rather shouldn't say 

2752
02:02:07,060 --> 02:02:07,060
dictatorship.
It kind of is,

2753
02:02:07,060 --> 02:02:07,340
you know,
it's the most insane.

2754
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:09,500
If you look at the rest of the world,
they would think of us as,

2755
02:02:09,610 --> 02:02:11,630
you know,
dictators dominating them.

2756
02:02:11,900 --> 02:02:13,700
Well,
we occupy a unique space.

2757
02:02:13,740 --> 02:02:15,110
It's really the,
you know,

2758
02:02:15,111 --> 02:02:20,111
you read about this shit,
the pox americana and all that stuff 

2759
02:02:20,111 --> 02:02:22,810
like we've imposed a worldwide piece.
I realize I'm using the word peace even 

2760
02:02:22,810 --> 02:02:23,750
though there are people dying in certain
areas,

2761
02:02:23,751 --> 02:02:28,751
but it's essentially piece through force
and we've established that and I don't 

2762
02:02:28,880 --> 02:02:32,510
want to say that that's all bad because 
I think it's provided a lot of stability

2763
02:02:32,511 --> 02:02:34,910
and a lot of innovation for millions of 
people.

2764
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:36,960
It's not all bad.
Nothing is all bad,

2765
02:02:36,961 --> 02:02:38,340
but there's a lot of bad.
Right?

2766
02:02:38,341 --> 02:02:43,341
But What I was going to say is that what
we have become in this most insane 

2767
02:02:43,341 --> 02:02:48,080
empire ever was it was all born out of 
trying to escape suppression and we 

2768
02:02:48,811 --> 02:02:53,811
tried to establish these parameters that
would avoid suppression in this place 

2769
02:02:53,811 --> 02:02:58,400
and those parameters allowed people to 
be free to do a lot of things that 

2770
02:02:58,400 --> 02:02:59,900
weren't able to do in other countries to
freedom,

2771
02:02:59,990 --> 02:03:03,720
set up homesteads and build houses and 
fucking farm and,

2772
02:03:03,810 --> 02:03:04,200
and,
and,

2773
02:03:04,210 --> 02:03:09,210
and,
and make cities that just don't exist 

2774
02:03:09,210 --> 02:03:10,990
anywhere in the fucking world.
Why did New York city arise in,

2775
02:03:10,991 --> 02:03:15,991
in America?
I'd rub because it wasn't an another 

2776
02:03:15,991 --> 02:03:15,991
fucking country like us.
When New York city was first formed,

2777
02:03:15,991 --> 02:03:20,721
there was nothing like us and everybody 
flocked here from all over the fucking 

2778
02:03:20,721 --> 02:03:21,600
planet knowing that this is the free 
spot.

2779
02:03:21,810 --> 02:03:24,540
This is where my pArents,
my parents family came from.

2780
02:03:24,720 --> 02:03:29,720
They all came from Italy and they came 
from Ireland where it sucked and they 

2781
02:03:29,720 --> 02:03:33,411
got on boats.
They didn't even know what the fuck was 

2782
02:03:33,411 --> 02:03:33,480
on the other end because there was no 
internet back then and they just fucking

2783
02:03:33,481 --> 02:03:38,481
took a chance.
And those gangster mother fuckers 

2784
02:03:38,481 --> 02:03:40,080
created this incredible place where they
were trying to escape a shit life.

2785
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:42,840
So What do we do?
We shut up this life too.

2786
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:43,530
We,
we,

2787
02:03:43,540 --> 02:03:48,540
we impose the same bullshit that we were
scared of or they were scared of when 

2788
02:03:49,771 --> 02:03:52,650
they formed America.
We just fucking ignore it.

2789
02:03:52,770 --> 02:03:57,770
We ignore what,
what our founding fathers warned us 

2790
02:03:57,770 --> 02:03:57,770
about and we think we're smarter than 
that.

2791
02:03:57,770 --> 02:03:58,170
Well,
you know,

2792
02:03:58,171 --> 02:04:00,360
it benefits me if I take away the fourth
amendment.

2793
02:04:00,361 --> 02:04:05,361
So fuck you.
I'm just some fat guy who eats meat and 

2794
02:04:05,361 --> 02:04:06,450
takes prozac.
And I've decided I'm going to change the

2795
02:04:06,451 --> 02:04:06,780
law.

2796
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:11,860
Yeah,
it is kind of funny that we've in some 

2797
02:04:11,860 --> 02:04:14,600
ways become what we run from.
It's like that greek myth where the king

2798
02:04:14,630 --> 02:04:19,630
is given the prophecy that uh,
his son one day will grow up to kill 

2799
02:04:19,630 --> 02:04:22,340
him.
And so he exiles his son to some distant

2800
02:04:22,341 --> 02:04:24,410
land.
And in so doing,

2801
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:28,100
he eventually assures his own death 
because they're in a battle or something

2802
02:04:28,101 --> 02:04:30,950
and the sun kills his father not 
realizing that it's his father.

2803
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:33,740
And if he had actually just lived in the
kingdom for his whole life,

2804
02:04:33,741 --> 02:04:38,741
he of course would not kill his own dad,
but it was that very action of to 

2805
02:04:38,741 --> 02:04:38,741
prevent his

2806
02:04:38,741 --> 02:04:40,200
fate that made it occur.
Yeah,

2807
02:04:40,380 --> 02:04:42,840
creating enemies,
creating enemies out of fear,

2808
02:04:43,470 --> 02:04:48,470
being afraid of people so you create an 
enemy and then you create someone that 

2809
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:49,620
you should be afraid of,
but now and now we're drawing people and

2810
02:04:49,621 --> 02:04:53,670
creating new enemies.
Not just droning people,

2811
02:04:53,671 --> 02:04:58,671
but the latest revelation that we're not
just droning people what we're using 

2812
02:04:58,671 --> 02:05:02,481
metadata to find out where their phones 
are and sending missiles to where their 

2813
02:05:02,481 --> 02:05:06,471
phones are.
Especially when it's been absolutely 

2814
02:05:06,471 --> 02:05:09,621
shown that al qaeda and the taliban,
they switched sim cards back and forth 

2815
02:05:10,441 --> 02:05:15,441
and move them around all the time so 
that people can't clock where the phone 

2816
02:05:15,441 --> 02:05:16,560
is connected.
Is it connected to this?

2817
02:05:16,561 --> 02:05:20,580
AlgerIa guy is connected to our 
halloween because who knows?

2818
02:05:20,710 --> 02:05:22,200
It's a fucking sim cards floating 
around.

2819
02:05:22,201 --> 02:05:27,201
Who knows who's got what,
but they decide that it's okay to shoot 

2820
02:05:27,201 --> 02:05:28,260
missiles to where the phone is.

2821
02:05:28,710 --> 02:05:29,280
I mean,
that's.

2822
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:33,330
That's some incredibly evil shit that's 
insanely evil.

2823
02:05:33,660 --> 02:05:38,610
The idea that it's more important to 
kill this guy than it is to not kill all

2824
02:05:38,611 --> 02:05:41,640
the innocent people around him.
Wow.

2825
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:44,130
They probably turned on his camera 
though in there listening first,

2826
02:05:44,131 --> 02:05:44,670
you know like,
oh,

2827
02:05:44,671 --> 02:05:45,480
nope.
That's him.

2828
02:05:46,020 --> 02:05:47,220
That's.
I could hear his voice.

2829
02:05:47,310 --> 02:05:52,310
Not according to the nsa documents.
They don't have any of the cooperating 

2830
02:05:52,310 --> 02:05:53,230
evidence outside of the metadata.
Wow.

2831
02:05:53,430 --> 02:05:55,080
yeah.
They just knew where the phone was.

2832
02:05:55,510 --> 02:05:57,560
Sent a rocket there.
She'll pull them.

2833
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:01,500
He's got a lot of these guys also use 
phones that you can take the.

2834
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:06,680
They don't have cash,
they won't use phones that have 

2835
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:06,680
batteries in them that you can't take 
out.

2836
02:06:06,680 --> 02:06:08,370
Like they never use iphone or like htc 
ones.

2837
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:13,740
They use phones where you could always 
take the battery out because the nsa and

2838
02:06:13,830 --> 02:06:14,400
you know,
whatever,

2839
02:06:14,490 --> 02:06:15,870
covering organizations fill in the 
blank,

2840
02:06:15,871 --> 02:06:20,871
you know,
the mossad plucking the [inaudible] or 

2841
02:06:20,871 --> 02:06:20,871
whatever.

2842
02:06:20,871 --> 02:06:23,550
They all at this point in time,
if you're a bad guy,

2843
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:25,770
they have the capability of listening 
into your phone calls.

2844
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:30,800
They also have the capability of turning
on your cameras so they use specific 

2845
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:34,581
phones that don't have that.
Also you could remove batteries so they 

2846
02:06:34,581 --> 02:06:35,030
don't have a power source and they'll,
you know,

2847
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:37,890
they'll,
they'll cover their phone cameras,

2848
02:06:37,891 --> 02:06:39,870
the front facing camera and all kinds of
other shit too.

2849
02:06:40,140 --> 02:06:40,620
So they,
they,

2850
02:06:40,621 --> 02:06:43,290
they work around all that kind of stuff.
They're not,

2851
02:06:43,350 --> 02:06:48,270
they're not stupid to what technology 
allows the enemy or their enemy to do,

2852
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:51,630
but you know,
the metadata thing is just so crazy.

2853
02:06:51,631 --> 02:06:56,631
So yeah,
the idea that you found out where the 

2854
02:06:56,631 --> 02:06:58,251
phone is,
so you send a missile to where that 

2855
02:06:58,251 --> 02:06:58,251
phone is.
I mean,

2856
02:06:58,251 --> 02:06:59,500
I could sort of kind of see if,
you know,

2857
02:06:59,501 --> 02:07:00,420
this was your,
your,

2858
02:07:00,430 --> 02:07:03,270
you know,
it's godzilla and godzilla's phone is.

2859
02:07:04,010 --> 02:07:04,460
Yeah,
yeah.

2860
02:07:04,470 --> 02:07:09,470
I'd say just to,
just to be sure to send a missile that 

2861
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:12,471
way.
I still have trouble believing that 

2862
02:07:12,471 --> 02:07:13,020
they're just killing people on the 
metadata because uh,

2863
02:07:13,110 --> 02:07:18,110
I would like to think that there's 
somebody within these agencies who's 

2864
02:07:18,110 --> 02:07:18,110
like,
wait a second,

2865
02:07:18,110 --> 02:07:21,591
we got to actually have some kind of 
probable cause here before we end 

2866
02:07:21,591 --> 02:07:22,740
somebody's life.
Yeah.

2867
02:07:22,741 --> 02:07:27,741
It wOuld be nice to think that,
but the issue is that you're dealing 

2868
02:07:27,741 --> 02:07:30,621
with people who are so accustomed to 
making decisions that cost people 

2869
02:07:30,621 --> 02:07:30,621
millions of lives.
I mean,

2870
02:07:30,621 --> 02:07:32,970
or you knoW,
over course of time,

2871
02:07:32,971 --> 02:07:34,620
millions of lives,
thousands of lives,

2872
02:07:34,650 --> 02:07:35,950
dozens of lives,
whatever it is,

2873
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:38,980
the loss of life there are so accustomed
to making those decisions.

2874
02:07:39,550 --> 02:07:41,020
One of the things that came out of the,
uh,

2875
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:46,280
the wikileaks,
it was so disturbing was the collateral 

2876
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:49,681
murder video where they were talking 
about shooting those missiles into the 

2877
02:07:50,711 --> 02:07:54,340
van and that there were children there 
and then the guy was like,

2878
02:07:54,341 --> 02:07:54,930
fuck them.
You know,

2879
02:07:54,931 --> 02:07:57,490
it shouldn't have brought their kids.
Remember that?

2880
02:07:57,550 --> 02:07:58,090
Yeah,
I do.

2881
02:07:58,140 --> 02:08:03,140
I that wiki leaks is another example 
where if they had just come out on day 

2882
02:08:03,140 --> 02:08:03,140
one and said,
okay,

2883
02:08:03,140 --> 02:08:07,330
this organization has a surface,
some shit that is really unacceptable,

2884
02:08:07,690 --> 02:08:12,690
we're going to investigate it.
We're going to make sure it doesn't 

2885
02:08:12,690 --> 02:08:12,690
happen again.
Thank you very much.

2886
02:08:12,690 --> 02:08:14,470
That would have been the end of it.
This whole thing with julian assange and

2887
02:08:14,471 --> 02:08:17,470
the embassy and wiki leaks becoming this
globally prominent,

2888
02:08:18,250 --> 02:08:20,920
whatever it is,
like this alternative media organization

2889
02:08:21,130 --> 02:08:24,040
would not have happened at all if the us
government on day one and just said,

2890
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:29,160
okay,
thanks for bringing this stuff to our 

2891
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:29,160
attention.
It will not happen again.

2892
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:29,160
Yeah,

2893
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:29,370
but they don't want it to not happen 
again.

2894
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:34,400
They wanted to continue happening,
but they don't want to make sure that 

2895
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:34,400
they

2896
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:37,210
in the age of the internet,
you can't just crack down on something 

2897
02:08:37,210 --> 02:08:37,310
like wiki leaks so that a lot of people 
noticing,

2898
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:39,880
well now they know.
I mean now they know.

2899
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:42,400
Now they know because of that and now 
they know because of snowden.

2900
02:08:42,401 --> 02:08:45,010
I mean now they know,
but it was uncharted territory,

2901
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:47,420
but the point I was making is,
you know,

2902
02:08:47,710 --> 02:08:52,260
saying that they wouldn't shoot missiles
to where the metadata is because they're

2903
02:08:52,270 --> 02:08:54,670
worried about innocent civilians and 
casualties.

2904
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:57,340
Will you clearly look at that video and 
you could say,

2905
02:08:57,640 --> 02:09:02,640
at least in this certain circumstance,
there is a very flippant attitude about 

2906
02:09:02,640 --> 02:09:05,620
the loss of collateralized collateral 
damage and it's children.

2907
02:09:05,621 --> 02:09:07,280
They're talking about I shouldn't have 
brought their kids like,

2908
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:08,740
okay,
really?

2909
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:13,960
Is that where we're at?
We're the good guys and they shouldn't 

2910
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:13,960
have brought their kids and that's,
that's the attitude.

2911
02:09:13,960 --> 02:09:15,610
Not all my god.
Did we kill kids.

2912
02:09:15,730 --> 02:09:17,980
There's not that attitude that it's 
pretty indigenized.

2913
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:21,310
It's unbelievably dehumanized and you 
want to talk about innocent.

2914
02:09:21,790 --> 02:09:26,790
Guess what?
There's no one more innocent than 

2915
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:26,790
children.
They didn't choose to be there.

2916
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:28,900
They didn't choose to be born there.
They didn't choose to have those parents

2917
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:34,020
that didn't choose to be led by their 
little tiny hands into the fucking car 

2918
02:09:34,020 --> 02:09:37,111
seat in the van.
Where are you going to shoot with 

2919
02:09:37,111 --> 02:09:37,570
hellfire missiles because you,
you thought a reporter was an assassin.

2920
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:38,590
You know,
I mean,

2921
02:09:38,591 --> 02:09:41,020
it's all a mistake and their attitude 
is,

2922
02:09:41,230 --> 02:09:42,550
hey,
we should have brought their kids.

2923
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:48,270
That leads me to believe that there are 
people out there in the world who are 

2924
02:09:48,270 --> 02:09:48,490
willing to shoot missiles to where the 
phone is.

2925
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:53,980
Hmm.
It's so weird that with Vietnam they 

2926
02:09:53,980 --> 02:09:57,751
went through all this stuff like the 
slow realization that we're maybe not 

2927
02:09:57,751 --> 02:10:01,651
supposed to be there and that innocent 
people are being killed and there's no 

2928
02:10:01,651 --> 02:10:05,461
purpose for this.
like we came to that realization with 

2929
02:10:05,461 --> 02:10:08,371
Vietnam and it seems like a lot of the 
same stuff is happening now and we're 

2930
02:10:08,371 --> 02:10:11,761
going through the same bullshit where 
you have to listen to people on tv tell 

2931
02:10:11,761 --> 02:10:11,761
you that,
you know,

2932
02:10:11,761 --> 02:10:13,090
we got to support the troops.
We can't question anything.

2933
02:10:13,390 --> 02:10:18,390
We've already been there like that all 
happened in the Vietnam war and then 

2934
02:10:18,390 --> 02:10:21,061
eventually people just fell out of that 
narrative and they realized it was 

2935
02:10:21,061 --> 02:10:24,181
bullshit and now today it's still 
considered something where you can't 

2936
02:10:24,181 --> 02:10:24,181
just say that the wars are complete 
bullshit.

2937
02:10:24,250 --> 02:10:29,250
Well,
the best story about all this or the 

2938
02:10:29,250 --> 02:10:31,620
most ridiculous but yet true is that 
both the Vietnam war and the Afghanistan

2939
02:10:31,991 --> 02:10:34,220
war,
a big part of what's going on,

2940
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:37,550
is it profiting familial drugs?
I mean that was the heroin,

2941
02:10:37,570 --> 02:10:38,210
right?
Yeah.

2942
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:39,560
Well,
heroin.

2943
02:10:39,990 --> 02:10:42,770
I mean there was a big part of what was 
going on in Vietnam.

2944
02:10:42,890 --> 02:10:45,200
It was a big part of the whole golden 
triangle.

2945
02:10:45,530 --> 02:10:46,340
I mean,
it was a big.

2946
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:51,420
The,
the amount of money that was moved in 

2947
02:10:51,420 --> 02:10:53,810
heroin during the Vietnam era is 
documented.

2948
02:10:53,811 --> 02:10:55,760
I mean,
it's documented that there were soldiers

2949
02:10:55,761 --> 02:10:56,990
that were involved,
were profiting.

2950
02:10:57,190 --> 02:11:00,200
What was that movie with denzel 
Washington where he,

2951
02:11:00,201 --> 02:11:03,950
uh,
he played a famous drug dealer that went

2952
02:11:04,010 --> 02:11:04,640
to,
uh,

2953
02:11:04,750 --> 02:11:09,750
to China and was,
he had a friend or one of his buddies 

2954
02:11:09,750 --> 02:11:12,370
was a Vietnam.
I'm a soldier and they were,

2955
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:15,780
they were based on a true story about 
how uh,

2956
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:18,140
he became a big time drug dealer.

2957
02:11:19,550 --> 02:11:20,570
American gangster.
Yeah.

2958
02:11:20,571 --> 02:11:22,730
That was it.
Great fucking movie.

2959
02:11:22,760 --> 02:11:24,530
I saw that movie.
It was much like,

2960
02:11:24,531 --> 02:11:26,810
what's going on in Afghanistan now?
you,

2961
02:11:26,811 --> 02:11:28,850
if you brought it up back then,
hey,

2962
02:11:28,851 --> 02:11:33,851
a big reason,
a big motivation for the Vietnam war is 

2963
02:11:33,851 --> 02:11:33,851
a secret drug running organization.
They were like,

2964
02:11:33,851 --> 02:11:35,110
get out of here.
You fucking crack pot.

2965
02:11:35,330 --> 02:11:38,660
That's the same thing they say today,
but today it's even more blatant in your

2966
02:11:38,661 --> 02:11:43,661
face.
When geraldo rivera is interviewing 

2967
02:11:43,661 --> 02:11:43,820
troops that are guarding poppy fields.
Like,

2968
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:44,490
wait,
wait,

2969
02:11:44,510 --> 02:11:44,810
wait,
wait,

2970
02:11:44,811 --> 02:11:45,140
wait,
wait,

2971
02:11:45,141 --> 02:11:45,440
wait,
wait.

2972
02:11:45,450 --> 02:11:45,750
Right,
right,

2973
02:11:45,751 --> 02:11:46,030
right,
right.

2974
02:11:46,031 --> 02:11:47,750
What,
what are you doing?

2975
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:52,840
Well,
we need the information from these 

2976
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:54,131
people and where the taliban is,
so we're going to guard their poppy 

2977
02:11:54,131 --> 02:11:54,131
fields.
Oh,

2978
02:11:54,131 --> 02:11:54,260
okay.
Okay.

2979
02:11:54,290 --> 02:11:55,640
No one's making any money off this 
though,

2980
02:11:55,641 --> 02:11:57,290
right?
Yeah.

2981
02:11:57,420 --> 02:12:02,420
The fuck outta here.
Whoever it is that's profiting on 

2982
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:04,070
whatever by whatever method,
whatever avenue they're profiting,

2983
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:06,770
they find some sort of a Justification 
for it,

2984
02:12:06,771 --> 02:12:07,820
but make no mistake about it.

2985
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:11,540
Part of the motivation and why we're 
there is that money that has a factor.

2986
02:12:11,541 --> 02:12:16,541
I don't know what factor it is.
Is it more or less valuable than the 

2987
02:12:16,541 --> 02:12:17,330
trillions of dollars in minerals they 
have discovered?

2988
02:12:17,570 --> 02:12:22,570
Is it more or less valuable than the 
natural gas at that Russia and the 

2989
02:12:22,570 --> 02:12:25,690
United States were duking it out over 
during the time of the mujahideen is,

2990
02:12:25,750 --> 02:12:27,080
is it more or less?
I don't know,

2991
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:29,750
but it's a factor.
It's unquestionably a factor.

2992
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:33,710
The amount of heroin production in 
Afghanistan since he knew us occupation,

2993
02:12:34,070 --> 02:12:37,610
is that like 90 percent or something 
fucking crazy through the roof.

2994
02:12:37,670 --> 02:12:40,430
So this is just the unreported,
a sister story.

2995
02:12:40,490 --> 02:12:41,720
It's facts.
I mean,

2996
02:12:41,721 --> 02:12:43,430
these are facts,
stone cold.

2997
02:12:43,820 --> 02:12:44,960
No,
When I say unreported,

2998
02:12:45,010 --> 02:12:47,050
not saying that this shit's not true.
what I'm saying is like,

2999
02:12:47,090 --> 02:12:52,090
this is the stuff that people don't see 
on fox and friends exactly is the poppy 

3000
02:12:52,090 --> 02:12:52,090
fields.
Uh,

3001
02:12:53,480 --> 02:12:58,480
it's kind of interesting that we watch 
fox or msnbc and some kind of academic.

3002
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:04,120
Uh,
we'll talk about obama's performance is 

3003
02:13:04,120 --> 02:13:07,390
if obama is just this country,
a politician who we can just sit there 

3004
02:13:07,390 --> 02:13:09,650
and review him,
but he's really this incredibly powerful

3005
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:12,530
near emperor of what you just talked 
about,

3006
02:13:12,531 --> 02:13:17,531
this technological and military empire.
And so it's kind of absurd I think for 

3007
02:13:17,531 --> 02:13:20,600
us to still think that he's this 
constitutionally bound president.

3008
02:13:20,910 --> 02:13:22,670
I mean,
he's spying on all these people.

3009
02:13:23,060 --> 02:13:24,860
We've got military actions all over the 
world.

3010
02:13:24,861 --> 02:13:29,240
Like we need to consider the fact that 
we are not living in a pre nine slash 11

3011
02:13:29,241 --> 02:13:29,900
world anymore.

3012
02:13:30,820 --> 02:13:31,330
The,
um,

3013
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:32,670
opium production,

3014
02:13:32,830 --> 02:13:37,830
um,
it's ramped up 49 percent from 2012.

3015
02:13:39,030 --> 02:13:42,090
It goes up all the time.
It's just going up and up.

3016
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:43,820
It sounds like the business to be in.
Yeah.

3017
02:13:43,830 --> 02:13:46,870
It's way better than bitcoin right now.
To bitcoin into poppy seeds,

3018
02:13:46,900 --> 02:13:47,260
it's,
it's,

3019
02:13:47,290 --> 02:13:48,570
it's,
it's incredible.

3020
02:13:48,571 --> 02:13:50,750
If you look at,
if just google the,

3021
02:13:50,751 --> 02:13:52,910
uh,
amount that heroin has,

3022
02:13:53,020 --> 02:13:56,310
has jumped up 50.
Oh my god,

3023
02:13:56,311 --> 02:14:01,311
it's up by 50 percent in the last year.
This is the most recent january of 2014.

3024
02:14:02,770 --> 02:14:04,180
That's from newsweek.
By the way.

3025
02:14:04,190 --> 02:14:09,190
It's crazy that from news week their 
drug output is up 50 percent in the last

3026
02:14:10,380 --> 02:14:13,530
year and since the.
Since the american takeover,

3027
02:14:13,531 --> 02:14:17,820
since american occupation,
let me google that american occupation,

3028
02:14:17,850 --> 02:14:21,780
it's full or that,
that's some nutty number.

3029
02:14:23,250 --> 02:14:28,250
Oh god.
It's just so sad because it's so 

3030
02:14:28,250 --> 02:14:28,250
obvious.
It's so in our face,

3031
02:14:28,340 --> 02:14:31,950
you know?
Do you think that the world getS better?

3032
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:35,820
I think I asked you this last time,
but from here I feel like thingS have to

3033
02:14:35,821 --> 02:14:37,230
get better and they're already getting 
better.

3034
02:14:37,270 --> 02:14:42,270
There are definitely better,
but I think whAt we're getting at 

3035
02:14:42,270 --> 02:14:45,561
earlier is really important that the yin
and the yang is almost necessary in 

3036
02:14:45,561 --> 02:14:50,510
order for things to get done.
And it seems to be almost a natural part

3037
02:14:50,641 --> 02:14:55,641
of the universe.
I think this is the greatest time ever 

3038
02:14:55,641 --> 02:14:58,221
to be alive or really do,
but I think every time was the greatest 

3039
02:14:58,221 --> 02:14:59,250
time ever to be alive at that time.
You know,

3040
02:14:59,251 --> 02:15:02,400
just not everywhere.
If you live in africa right now,

3041
02:15:02,610 --> 02:15:07,610
if you're in Liberia right now,
it fucking socks is a sucky time to be 

3042
02:15:07,610 --> 02:15:07,670
alive.
You know,

3043
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:12,680
if you live in Somalia and you have to 
be a pirate because all the europeans 

3044
02:15:12,680 --> 02:15:13,260
have dumped nuclear waSte off your 
shores and killed all the fish.

3045
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:18,440
Very sucky time to be Alive.
You're basically living in a mad max 

3046
02:15:18,440 --> 02:15:18,830
movie.
You're living in the apocalypse here.

3047
02:15:18,831 --> 02:15:21,300
A bunch of skinny guys on cat that 
fucking,

3048
02:15:21,450 --> 02:15:25,020
that narcotic that they chew leaves to 
get amphetamine.

3049
02:15:25,460 --> 02:15:26,220
Not ma'am.
Now,

3050
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:28,330
now it's called cat k,
h a t.

3051
02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:31,450
It's a type of amphetamine that they,
uh,

3052
02:15:31,451 --> 02:15:36,451
they get from plants and they chew it.
They get whacked out of their fucking 

3053
02:15:36,451 --> 02:15:39,741
mind and they get machine guns and they 
get in rowboats and they go full over 

3054
02:15:39,741 --> 02:15:41,220
fucking oil tankers and the worst 
combination of things ever.

3055
02:15:41,330 --> 02:15:44,100
So worse combination of things ever.
And you know,

3056
02:15:44,130 --> 02:15:49,130
for them It's terrible time to be alive,
but for us here in los angeles chilling,

3057
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:52,290
drinking fucking oh,
coconut water,

3058
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:57,380
it's pretty nice.
Can god's greatest weed sitting here 

3059
02:15:57,380 --> 02:16:01,090
using laptops and super powerful 
internet connection connected to a 

3060
02:16:01,090 --> 02:16:01,620
million people in the world.

3061
02:16:01,620 --> 02:16:03,330
It's awesome.
It's an awesome time to be alive.

3062
02:16:03,331 --> 02:16:04,560
It is.
And I love,

3063
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:07,560
I love America and I love the internet 
and that's part of the reason why I'm so

3064
02:16:07,561 --> 02:16:11,460
obsessed with all the shit I talk about 
is that these are really cool tools that

3065
02:16:11,461 --> 02:16:15,480
we've put out into the world and it kind
of pains me to see us fucking it up.

3066
02:16:15,481 --> 02:16:20,481
Right?
Like we created the internet and it's 

3067
02:16:20,481 --> 02:16:20,481
truly amazing.
It's a game changer and no,

3068
02:16:20,481 --> 02:16:22,080
now we've weaponized it.
That's the phrase they use,

3069
02:16:22,590 --> 02:16:23,520
you just showed.
Yeah,

3070
02:16:23,540 --> 02:16:26,580
where you're using it to harass innocent
people and credit them.

3071
02:16:26,581 --> 02:16:31,581
Ruined their business people.
I am going to get thIs a million times 

3072
02:16:31,581 --> 02:16:35,251
now that I've talked about that,
which is will aren't companies doing 

3073
02:16:35,251 --> 02:16:35,251
that aren't individuals trolling.
And I'm like,

3074
02:16:35,251 --> 02:16:39,900
it's really different when the 
government is using your tax dollars 

3075
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:43,291
that you send them every year and 
they're using that to psychologically 

3076
02:16:43,291 --> 02:16:44,170
harass you or to harass the journalists 
that you listened to.

3077
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:49,440
That's really dIfferent from some 
fucking weirdo doing it are some greedy 

3078
02:16:49,440 --> 02:16:51,010
company doing because they want to just 
protect their little domain.

3079
02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:53,440
But those companies that do do it,
they're full of shit.

3080
02:16:53,980 --> 02:16:56,460
You should avoid them.
They're shitty if you,

3081
02:16:56,510 --> 02:16:57,920
if you're,
if you're saying negative

3082
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:02,920
things about the competition and you're 
making them up and you're trolling and 

3083
02:17:02,920 --> 02:17:03,590
you're trying to kill their business,
you're a shithead.

3084
02:17:03,810 --> 02:17:05,570
You know what I mean?
That's reality.

3085
02:17:05,750 --> 02:17:06,640
You know?
Um,

3086
02:17:06,920 --> 02:17:11,920
there's a,
a thing that's been going on with us 

3087
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:11,920
with,
uh,

3088
02:17:11,920 --> 02:17:12,090
one of the guys that we've had on the 
podcast several times,

3089
02:17:12,110 --> 02:17:14,450
guy named dave asprey,
who I don't hate.

3090
02:17:14,870 --> 02:17:16,580
I like the gUy,
I think he's a good guy.

3091
02:17:16,581 --> 02:17:18,590
I think he's flawed.
Like a lot of human beings.

3092
02:17:18,591 --> 02:17:23,591
I'm flawed as well,
but he's exaggerated and said some 

3093
02:17:23,591 --> 02:17:25,700
things on the show that have turned out 
to bite us in the ass.

3094
02:17:26,030 --> 02:17:31,030
And I sorta started investigating it 
because he started making claims about 

3095
02:17:31,161 --> 02:17:34,430
my friend tate's business.
Tate started taping him.

3096
02:17:34,431 --> 02:17:35,510
we're going to go into business 
together.

3097
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:41,160
Uh,
for whatever reason they had a falling 

3098
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:41,160
out.
So tate decided to start selling his own

3099
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:41,160
coffee.

3100
02:17:41,420 --> 02:17:45,200
Dave asprey sells a bunch of things,
sells a good products,

3101
02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:50,830
good coffee,
a bunch of other different health and 

3102
02:17:50,830 --> 02:17:50,830
nutrition products.
Nothing wrong with what he's selling,

3103
02:17:50,930 --> 02:17:55,930
but he started shooting on tate stuff.
He called it inferior quality without 

3104
02:17:55,930 --> 02:17:57,380
any testing whatsoever.
And then you also called it a knock off.

3105
02:17:57,381 --> 02:17:59,420
He's talking about is mct oil that he 
sells.

3106
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:00,950
Well,
here's the problem with that.

3107
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:06,040
Several problems.
One problem being that dave asprey 

3108
02:18:06,040 --> 02:18:08,711
doesn't make mct oil.
He buys it because a company that buy 

3109
02:18:08,711 --> 02:18:12,581
it,
they buy and they sell it to a bunch of 

3110
02:18:12,581 --> 02:18:14,441
different companies.
My friend larry used to be in the 

3111
02:18:14,441 --> 02:18:16,060
nutrition business and he was uh,
he owned a company called nature's pure,

3112
02:18:16,061 --> 02:18:21,061
a very good company.
And he told me exactly how it all works 

3113
02:18:21,061 --> 02:18:25,000
and he told me how he buys from the same
suppliers that all these other people 

3114
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:25,100
buy from.

3115
02:18:25,110 --> 02:18:30,110
LIke there's,
there's only a limited amount of 

3116
02:18:30,110 --> 02:18:31,811
suppliers that make vitamin d that make 
mct or they'll make all these different 

3117
02:18:31,811 --> 02:18:32,210
things.
You buy it from them,

3118
02:18:32,211 --> 02:18:37,211
you try to buy from the most reputable 
supplier and then you package it 

3119
02:18:37,211 --> 02:18:39,671
yourself and label it yourself.
That's what dave does and that's what 

3120
02:18:39,671 --> 02:18:42,480
tate did too.
And so dave was called tate stuff 

3121
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:44,030
inferior without any testing whatsoever.
That's a propensity for bullshitting and

3122
02:18:44,031 --> 02:18:46,220
so I saw that and I was like,
what the fuck is that man?

3123
02:18:46,221 --> 02:18:51,221
you can't do that.
You can't just say that because I know 

3124
02:18:51,221 --> 02:18:51,221
where you get your shit.
I know the company that makes your stuff

3125
02:18:51,221 --> 02:18:53,540
so you can't just say that his stuff is 
inferior.

3126
02:18:53,541 --> 02:18:56,840
We don't know where he buys it.
You don't know what testing is done.

3127
02:18:56,841 --> 02:18:58,070
You don't know.
In fact,

3128
02:18:58,290 --> 02:19:03,290
I even went out of the way to make his 
is mct oil to try to improve what he 

3129
02:19:03,290 --> 02:19:07,271
thought dave was doing by selling it in 
glass bottles because he felt like 

3130
02:19:07,271 --> 02:19:07,271
plastic can leach.

3131
02:19:07,271 --> 02:19:07,960
It can leach chemicals.
It's,

3132
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:09,110
it's,
it's in the heat,

3133
02:19:09,230 --> 02:19:10,670
like it's very conscientious the way you
did it.

3134
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:15,000
What was not so conscientious with that,
he kind of copied dave's business model.

3135
02:19:15,020 --> 02:19:18,890
He copied dave's claims about mycotoxins
and all these different things,

3136
02:19:19,130 --> 02:19:24,020
so then he goes and tests dave's coffee 
and then test his coffee as well.

3137
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:26,690
Well,
dave's coffee turns out to test positive

3138
02:19:26,691 --> 02:19:31,691
for under threshold below threshold of 
two different mycotoxins means you're 

3139
02:19:31,691 --> 02:19:33,530
not going to affect you,
it's not going to physically affect you,

3140
02:19:33,531 --> 02:19:37,160
but his whole claim to fame was that 
there's a real issue with mycotoxins and

3141
02:19:37,161 --> 02:19:39,590
coffee.
He's developed a process that elIminates

3142
02:19:39,591 --> 02:19:41,420
them.
Every other coffee could be tainted.

3143
02:19:41,570 --> 02:19:44,180
That was his number one thing.
It's like classic government shit,

3144
02:19:44,270 --> 02:19:46,460
create a problem and then offer a 
solution.

3145
02:19:46,610 --> 02:19:50,990
So I know parrot his words not doing any
research,

3146
02:19:51,050 --> 02:19:52,790
you know,
and having them on the podcast.

3147
02:19:52,970 --> 02:19:55,160
He's a very smart guy,
very knowledgeable.

3148
02:19:55,161 --> 02:20:00,161
It seems so.
We repeat is his words about mycotoxins 

3149
02:20:00,161 --> 02:20:00,161
and coffee.
So tate,

3150
02:20:00,161 --> 02:20:04,900
when he does this test and finds out the
dave stuff actually has mycotoxins and 

3151
02:20:04,900 --> 02:20:08,861
tate's,
which has gone through none of this 

3152
02:20:08,861 --> 02:20:10,751
super secret process.
He's just done the standard wet 

3153
02:20:10,751 --> 02:20:13,661
processing that all high level single 
source coffee companies do take,

3154
02:20:14,270 --> 02:20:15,140
you know,
he goes,

3155
02:20:15,141 --> 02:20:16,100
well,
what the fuck man,

3156
02:20:16,130 --> 02:20:19,430
you know,
this guy's shit has some mycotoxins mind

3157
02:20:19,431 --> 02:20:21,800
doesn't like w w what exactly is going 
on here?

3158
02:20:21,890 --> 02:20:26,890
So we sell his coffee at on it.
We sell the bulletproof coffee or 

3159
02:20:26,890 --> 02:20:27,410
upgraded coffee,
asprey's coughing.

3160
02:20:27,650 --> 02:20:32,650
So we decided to test that and tate's 
and starbucks and some random coffee 

3161
02:20:34,251 --> 02:20:39,251
from whole foods.
None of them test positive for 

3162
02:20:39,251 --> 02:20:43,301
mycotoxins.
So it's an instant issue that's not 

3163
02:20:43,301 --> 02:20:44,570
really presents an issue,
but we've been parenting it and,

3164
02:20:44,571 --> 02:20:49,571
and saying that it becomes this huge 
thing saying that it's an issue saying 

3165
02:20:50,811 --> 02:20:55,811
that it's a huge health issue,
but every coffee expert you read online 

3166
02:20:55,811 --> 02:20:56,300
thinks it's bullshit.

3167
02:20:56,360 --> 02:20:57,800
They all think it's bullshit.
In fact,

3168
02:20:57,801 --> 02:21:00,620
there's like scores that they have for 
coffee.

3169
02:21:00,740 --> 02:21:03,170
They have scores like a really good 
coffee,

3170
02:21:03,171 --> 02:21:05,750
like rusty's hawaiian that we started 
drinking.

3171
02:21:05,900 --> 02:21:08,720
It's a really good stuff and it's scored
like a 95.

3172
02:21:08,721 --> 02:21:10,520
It's delicious coffee,
you know?

3173
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:14,120
And in order to score high,
they test your stuff from mold.

3174
02:21:14,450 --> 02:21:15,940
Like they test it,
they,

3175
02:21:15,970 --> 02:21:16,410
they,
they,

3176
02:21:16,460 --> 02:21:19,820
you can't have moldy coffee and have a 
test high.

3177
02:21:20,210 --> 02:21:21,710
So iT's,
this is not an issue.

3178
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:24,230
This isn't an issue that was existing in
the eighties.

3179
02:21:24,231 --> 02:21:27,890
There's a pub med or article from 1980 
about mycotoxins.

3180
02:21:27,891 --> 02:21:32,891
So people aren't,
people aren't dying or chopping other 

3181
02:21:32,891 --> 02:21:33,170
people's faces off a bunch of other shit
about it.

3182
02:21:33,171 --> 02:21:35,660
Like it causes coffee to be bitter.
That's not the case.

3183
02:21:35,661 --> 02:21:37,210
That's not true.
So there's a lot of.

3184
02:21:37,370 --> 02:21:42,370
So my point is this all started his,
his whole downfall started because he 

3185
02:21:43,491 --> 02:21:46,430
was making false claims to try to 
eliminate competition.

3186
02:21:46,760 --> 02:21:49,280
he was doing exactly what we're seeing 
companies shouldn't do,

3187
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:51,560
shouldn't shit on someone to eliminate 
competition.

3188
02:21:51,740 --> 02:21:53,180
Now if aspe came out and said,
hey,

3189
02:21:53,181 --> 02:21:58,181
you know,
I think it's kind of fucked up to tate 

3190
02:21:58,181 --> 02:21:59,150
is basically copying my,
my claims about mycotoxins,

3191
02:21:59,151 --> 02:22:01,310
which by the way aren't true.
Then he would have a point,

3192
02:22:01,430 --> 02:22:02,290
but it would say,
hey,

3193
02:22:02,291 --> 02:22:04,520
you take the copy of my lies.
You know?

3194
02:22:04,700 --> 02:22:07,850
I mean that's basically what he would 
have to say because other than that,

3195
02:22:08,060 --> 02:22:10,040
there's not really case.
Other than that,

3196
02:22:10,041 --> 02:22:15,041
it's just the the,
the coffee equivalent of a root beer 

3197
02:22:15,041 --> 02:22:16,310
float,
which is coffee with butter and mct oil,

3198
02:22:16,590 --> 02:22:19,460
which then it turns out that wasn't even
asked his idea.

3199
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:22,550
It was a guy named rob wolf.
Another guy we've had on the podcast,

3200
02:22:22,551 --> 02:22:25,710
one of the paleo gurus.
He wrote about it in 2004,

3201
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:29,220
so it wasn't asked for idea.
This idea had been out there.

3202
02:22:29,221 --> 02:22:32,250
He collects these ideas and that's one 
of the things that rhonda patrick,

3203
02:22:32,251 --> 02:22:37,251
who was on last week because a phd,
she said that after he put some shit on 

3204
02:22:37,251 --> 02:22:40,620
his website from her scientific research
with vitamin d and didn't accreditor,

3205
02:22:41,220 --> 02:22:43,620
so there's a lot of that going on,
man.

3206
02:22:43,650 --> 02:22:47,690
A lot of people discrediting people sang
shitty things about being a know.

3207
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:53,000
It all comes back to get that.
It all comes back because if you're 

3208
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
saying false claims about someone like 
that,

3209
02:22:54,001 --> 02:22:59,001
if you're.
If you're just randomly deciding that 

3210
02:22:59,001 --> 02:23:01,431
someone's stuff is shit,
well then they get to test your stuff 

3211
02:23:01,431 --> 02:23:01,431
too,
man,

3212
02:23:01,431 --> 02:23:02,520
and if it turns out that your whole 
process is bullshit,

3213
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:06,810
that all this unnecessary nonsense or 
voodoo you're doing to your,

3214
02:23:06,811 --> 02:23:11,811
your,
your process to make sure that your 

3215
02:23:11,811 --> 02:23:14,031
stuff is better than everybody else's.
It doesn't actually work is actually 

3216
02:23:14,031 --> 02:23:14,400
real and the problem doesn't actually 
exist.

3217
02:23:14,440 --> 02:23:19,440
Yeah.
Then you shouldn't throw stones if 

3218
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:19,440
you're in the glass.
The glass house.

3219
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:20,880
If he didn't do that,
we would have never tested his coffee.

3220
02:23:21,150 --> 02:23:23,790
We would have thought that it was 
probably still an issue.

3221
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:26,430
You can find things online about 
mycotoxins in coffee,

3222
02:23:26,431 --> 02:23:31,431
been an issue,
but apparently they figured it out in 

3223
02:23:31,431 --> 02:23:34,761
like the 19 eighties,
this wet processing they figured out so 

3224
02:23:34,761 --> 02:23:38,990
you know,
it puts us in a real bad position 

3225
02:23:38,990 --> 02:23:39,990
because we've said what this guy said,
we repeated it on this podcast.

3226
02:23:39,991 --> 02:23:42,420
I've repeated it and you know,
it's not a bad product.

3227
02:23:42,421 --> 02:23:44,100
Everything.
He sells his good stuff.

3228
02:23:44,280 --> 02:23:45,590
Don't make any mistake about it.
It's not.

3229
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:49,390
You shouldn't,
not by dave as that's not his style.

3230
02:23:49,430 --> 02:23:52,620
Know that is a hawaiian roasters,
that's a different one,

3231
02:23:52,621 --> 02:23:54,960
or it's caveman.
It was that cayman or hawaiian roasters,

3232
02:23:55,260 --> 02:23:57,750
hawaiian roasters,
which we have no affiliation with.

3233
02:23:58,080 --> 02:24:00,060
Cave man is.
My friend hates coffee.

3234
02:24:00,061 --> 02:24:01,500
I have no business interest in that.

3235
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:03,230
He's just my friend.
Um,

3236
02:24:03,340 --> 02:24:08,340
you know,
I actually have a business interest in 

3237
02:24:08,340 --> 02:24:10,341
selling asprey's coffee because I own a 
piece of art and I sell it through on 

3238
02:24:10,341 --> 02:24:10,341
it,
but I,

3239
02:24:10,341 --> 02:24:15,141
you know,
I have to be honest always about 

3240
02:24:15,141 --> 02:24:15,160
everything and I,
I would have like,

3241
02:24:15,420 --> 02:24:20,420
it would be profitable for me to not 
talk about this because we sell his 

3242
02:24:20,420 --> 02:24:21,510
coffee,
but it's not ethical.

3243
02:24:21,650 --> 02:24:22,650
Yeah.
Meanwhile,

3244
02:24:22,651 --> 02:24:24,970
it's good coffee.
It's nothing wrong with it.

3245
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:28,020
People caffeinated,
which is necessary.

3246
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:29,310
It's good.
He,

3247
02:24:29,320 --> 02:24:31,200
he,
he buys very good coffee.

3248
02:24:31,201 --> 02:24:36,201
He sells very good coffee.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with 

3249
02:24:36,201 --> 02:24:36,201
it.
The other,

3250
02:24:36,201 --> 02:24:39,411
the claims were unnecessary and the 
claims created a business and they 

3251
02:24:39,411 --> 02:24:39,760
created a model.
They created this,

3252
02:24:39,761 --> 02:24:42,510
this,
this issue that doesn't seem to exist,

3253
02:24:42,810 --> 02:24:45,420
but why did it all come out to light?
What all came to light?

3254
02:24:45,421 --> 02:24:50,421
Because there was unfair claims about 
someone that he thought was a 

3255
02:24:50,421 --> 02:24:50,421
competitor,
I mean,

3256
02:24:50,421 --> 02:24:55,161
and that's that country shit that the 
government is encouraging their 

3257
02:24:55,161 --> 02:24:59,991
employees to do,
to discredit people is what discredits 

3258
02:24:59,991 --> 02:24:59,991
the government when something like that.

3259
02:24:59,991 --> 02:25:04,510
yeah.
That's like the perfect way of 

3260
02:25:04,510 --> 02:25:04,510
expressing what I was trying to get at 
earlier.

3261
02:25:04,510 --> 02:25:07,460
This idea of you're the fucking 
government and you're the us president.

3262
02:25:07,690 --> 02:25:08,300
Uh,
you don't,

3263
02:25:08,390 --> 02:25:13,390
you can't,
you can't lower yourself to this level 

3264
02:25:13,390 --> 02:25:13,950
where you're competing with snowden,
with a back and forth.

3265
02:25:13,951 --> 02:25:16,310
That should be.
We fucked up where the government,

3266
02:25:16,490 --> 02:25:18,090
we're going to correct it.
Yes.

3267
02:25:18,170 --> 02:25:20,040
Everybody would honor that.
The same with wikileaks.

3268
02:25:20,150 --> 02:25:25,150
The same with guantanamo bay,
like we went overboard with some 

3269
02:25:25,150 --> 02:25:28,111
interrogation stuff.
We detained some people against their 

3270
02:25:28,111 --> 02:25:28,111
rights,
their basiC rights.

3271
02:25:28,111 --> 02:25:30,820
We did this because we were panicked and
we didn't want another nine slash 11 and

3272
02:25:30,821 --> 02:25:35,821
now we'll take steps to correct it.
And that's not what they're saying and 

3273
02:25:35,821 --> 02:25:35,821
that's not what they're doing.
And that's really,

3274
02:25:35,821 --> 02:25:39,040
I think all anybody wants to hear that,
that kind of rhetoric from here on out,

3275
02:25:39,041 --> 02:25:42,220
which is we recognize there's a problem.
They've never fucking Said that,

3276
02:25:42,300 --> 02:25:47,300
yes,
obama as many positive things is that I 

3277
02:25:47,300 --> 02:25:50,311
can say about obama as I grow,
to just learn more about the world and 

3278
02:25:50,311 --> 02:25:54,061
realize that he's not this evil dictator
that info wars makes them out to be it's

3279
02:25:54,380 --> 02:25:55,600
more complex.
Picture.

3280
02:25:56,050 --> 02:25:58,930
With thAt said,
he still has not come out and said,

3281
02:25:59,590 --> 02:26:04,590
it's clear at this point the nsa has 
done some stuff that is not within the 

3282
02:26:04,590 --> 02:26:07,591
bounds of our laws and we'll fix that 
and that's all he'd have to do and it'd 

3283
02:26:07,591 --> 02:26:07,591
be

3284
02:26:07,591 --> 02:26:10,510
close to the most people would demand.
What does fix that mean?

3285
02:26:10,630 --> 02:26:15,630
The most have locked about clamping down
on it now and those people will be okay 

3286
02:26:15,630 --> 02:26:20,191
though.
I think you're always gonna have this 

3287
02:26:20,191 --> 02:26:20,191
symbolism.
no.

3288
02:26:20,191 --> 02:26:20,191
Does that mean you would be okay

3289
02:26:20,191 --> 02:26:22,520
if I honestly believed that obama was 
fixing the problem in a meaningful way?

3290
02:26:22,521 --> 02:26:26,120
I'd be okay with it because I'm very 
busy and I don't want to nitpick.

3291
02:26:26,121 --> 02:26:31,121
Well,
I'd rather see us move forward as a 

3292
02:26:31,121 --> 02:26:33,491
country and not continue to.
You can go after anything until the end 

3293
02:26:33,491 --> 02:26:38,350
of time.
There are some really big innovations 

3294
02:26:38,350 --> 02:26:40,091
ahead of us,
I think where we might go into a big 

3295
02:26:40,091 --> 02:26:40,100
economic boom in the next few years.
The bitcoin thing,

3296
02:26:40,101 --> 02:26:42,920
even if bitcoin goes away,
something very similar to it is going to

3297
02:26:42,921 --> 02:26:47,921
take off and these are exciting things 
like we're on the verge of another big 

3298
02:26:47,921 --> 02:26:48,680
tech boom.
Like we were in the nineties.

3299
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:53,920
We shouldn't get bogged down with all 
this petty bickering and all this 

3300
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:54,110
hateful stuff and red vs blue and

3301
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:56,210
petty at all.
I think it's critical.

3302
02:26:56,240 --> 02:27:01,240
I think it's a sign of the times and I 
think it's indicative of this new 

3303
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:03,560
environment that we find ourselves in 
this new environment.

3304
02:27:03,910 --> 02:27:05,380
No,
I don't mean the issues are petty.

3305
02:27:05,381 --> 02:27:07,810
I mean the government back and forth is 
petty.

3306
02:27:07,990 --> 02:27:12,990
It's very petty to like force an 
airplane to the ground to search for 

3307
02:27:12,990 --> 02:27:12,990
somebody.
This is not,

3308
02:27:12,990 --> 02:27:14,800
this is the most powerful government,
the world you shouldn't behave like.

3309
02:27:15,150 --> 02:27:17,130
I agree with that.
I absolutely agree with that.

3310
02:27:17,290 --> 02:27:18,870
I.
But I think what's going on,

3311
02:27:19,110 --> 02:27:20,820
you know,
whether we're talking about that,

3312
02:27:20,821 --> 02:27:21,380
uh,
the,

3313
02:27:21,490 --> 02:27:26,490
the coffee thing or whether we're 
talking about the government thing or 

3314
02:27:26,490 --> 02:27:29,611
the talk about virtually anything is you
can't expect to get away with business 

3315
02:27:31,471 --> 02:27:36,471
as usual because there's too much that 
gets exposed now because of the 

3316
02:27:36,471 --> 02:27:41,421
internet.
I think that when you do evil shit and 

3317
02:27:41,421 --> 02:27:45,500
other people are aware of that evil shit
and they could find out about that evil 

3318
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:45,540
shit and put it online.
You know,

3319
02:27:45,580 --> 02:27:50,580
you got to expect that you can't,
you can't keep these nsa workers silent 

3320
02:27:50,580 --> 02:27:51,840
because a lot of them are actual 
patriots.

3321
02:27:51,980 --> 02:27:52,770
You know,
they might have,

3322
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:56,940
they might have gotten a job a long time
ago out of college working for the nsa,

3323
02:27:56,941 --> 02:27:59,250
but they didn't do it because they 
wanted to be a bad guy.

3324
02:27:59,430 --> 02:28:04,430
They didn't do it because they wanted to
spy on their neighbor because their 

3325
02:28:04,430 --> 02:28:06,621
neighbor mike just think that the United
States should get the fuck out of 

3326
02:28:06,621 --> 02:28:06,621
Afghanistan.
You know,

3327
02:28:06,621 --> 02:28:11,121
tHat's not why they did it.
They did it because they wanted to keep 

3328
02:28:11,121 --> 02:28:13,881
people safe.
There's a lot of people like that out 

3329
02:28:13,881 --> 02:28:15,591
there,
so they find themselves a part of this 

3330
02:28:15,591 --> 02:28:17,960
genuinely dangerous organization that is
genuinely violating constitutional 

3331
02:28:17,960 --> 02:28:20,310
rights and what do they do?
They take chances.

3332
02:28:20,610 --> 02:28:21,980
They take.
What about that

3333
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:23,180
william binney guy,
that guy?

3334
02:28:23,181 --> 02:28:25,790
That was the first a whistleblower.
Way,

3335
02:28:25,791 --> 02:28:26,900
way,
way back in the day.

3336
02:28:26,930 --> 02:28:31,930
That guy had some balls.
That guy had some balls and he got away 

3337
02:28:31,930 --> 02:28:32,930
with it too because he was just 
predicting a future crime.

3338
02:28:33,170 --> 02:28:38,170
He quit and then he predicted a future 
crime and then when the future crime 

3339
02:28:38,170 --> 02:28:38,840
actually came into manifestation,
we can't.

3340
02:28:38,860 --> 02:28:41,840
it manifested itself.
That was like 10 years later.

3341
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:44,210
It's pretty incredible.
When you stop and think about it.

3342
02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:48,830
This guy called it and he quit the nsa 
after 2001 that has amazing.

3343
02:28:48,950 --> 02:28:50,000
Fuck.
That's amazing.

3344
02:28:50,120 --> 02:28:53,540
He was the original was a whistleblower 
and nobody talks about that cat,

3345
02:28:53,930 --> 02:28:55,100
that guy.
I mean he.

3346
02:28:55,110 --> 02:29:00,110
He's another fucking hero.
What they're doing is what you're not 

3347
02:29:00,110 --> 02:29:00,410
supposed to do.
You're not supposed to do it like that.

3348
02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:02,570
You have an obligation.
You're the top of the heap,

3349
02:29:03,230 --> 02:29:08,230
but I think it's also an impossible job.
I think trying to govern 300 million 

3350
02:29:08,230 --> 02:29:09,800
people is impossible and I think you'd 
get frustrated.

3351
02:29:09,801 --> 02:29:14,801
It's where most come up with all these 
ways to keep these motherfuckers in 

3352
02:29:14,801 --> 02:29:14,801
check.

3353
02:29:14,801 --> 02:29:16,070
That's where my president obama may be 
right article comes from,

3354
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:21,160
is this realization that there are a lot
of people and actually the best 

3355
02:29:21,160 --> 02:29:23,780
description of obama that I've heard,
there's this pickup artists who put some

3356
02:29:23,781 --> 02:29:26,660
of his videos on youtube and they're not
all about pickup.

3357
02:29:26,661 --> 02:29:28,880
A lot of them are just about like views 
on life.

3358
02:29:28,940 --> 02:29:29,780
Who's this?
Uh,

3359
02:29:29,800 --> 02:29:30,720
this guy,
oh,

3360
02:29:30,721 --> 02:29:32,360
and cook.
He actually lives in la,

3361
02:29:32,361 --> 02:29:34,100
but I've never met him.
And uh,

3362
02:29:34,101 --> 02:29:35,480
I was watching this video where he was 
like,

3363
02:29:35,481 --> 02:29:38,300
people aren't really prepared to hear 
the truth about obama,

3364
02:29:38,690 --> 02:29:42,800
which is that he's kind of like a,
a principal for this school known as the

3365
02:29:42,801 --> 02:29:47,801
United States.
So he's just trying to hold shit 

3366
02:29:47,801 --> 02:29:47,801
together and people don't want him to go
up on the podium and say,

3367
02:29:47,801 --> 02:29:48,650
look,
you want more jobs?

3368
02:29:49,020 --> 02:29:51,260
You've got to create some innovation 
because things are stagnant,

3369
02:29:51,261 --> 02:29:52,700
like you've got to go out there and do 
it.

3370
02:29:52,940 --> 02:29:57,940
I can't just create things out of thin 
air and it's the same with national 

3371
02:29:57,940 --> 02:29:58,730
security stuff.
He can't fix everything that people need

3372
02:29:58,731 --> 02:30:00,130
to demand,
you know,

3373
02:30:00,140 --> 02:30:02,840
protections of their privacy's.
It's not all on him.

3374
02:30:02,841 --> 02:30:04,310
It has to be on the people and I think 
that we,

3375
02:30:04,311 --> 02:30:05,860
for the most part,
not uni,

3376
02:30:05,870 --> 02:30:07,880
not red band,
not most of the listeners,

3377
02:30:07,881 --> 02:30:11,720
but in fucking lazy as a country,
been focused on other stuff and now it's

3378
02:30:11,721 --> 02:30:13,970
kind of coming back to bite us in the 
ass.

3379
02:30:13,971 --> 02:30:15,680
So we have to decide like what's 
important to us,

3380
02:30:15,681 --> 02:30:20,681
how far are we willing to trade off our 
basic rights in exchange for the 

3381
02:30:20,721 --> 02:30:22,190
guarantee of no more nine slash 11.

3382
02:30:22,730 --> 02:30:23,450
Yeah,
I mean,

3383
02:30:23,510 --> 02:30:28,510
or does that even work at all?
And what should we concentrate on when 

3384
02:30:28,510 --> 02:30:28,880
we're trying to prevent another nine 
slash 11?

3385
02:30:28,881 --> 02:30:33,881
What should we concentrate on?
Should we concentrate on spying on 

3386
02:30:33,881 --> 02:30:36,551
americans or should we concentrate on a 
non intervention is an interventional 

3387
02:30:36,551 --> 02:30:40,871
foreign policy that doesn't cause people
to get so fucking pissed off at us that 

3388
02:30:40,871 --> 02:30:45,221
they want to kill us.
Should we concentrate on not shooting 

3389
02:30:45,221 --> 02:30:47,921
dji drones into apartment buildings 
because they have a fucking cell phone 

3390
02:30:47,921 --> 02:30:48,470
that we want to find the user

3391
02:30:48,840 --> 02:30:50,940
maybe focused on not giving easy,
easy,

3392
02:30:50,941 --> 02:30:55,941
uh,
immigration rights to fucking Saudi 

3393
02:30:55,941 --> 02:30:55,941
Arabia when like all the nine slash 11 
hijackers,

3394
02:30:55,941 --> 02:30:57,450
I believe are from Saudi Arabia or many 
of them were.

3395
02:30:57,540 --> 02:31:00,080
There's got to be a bunch of different 
things that could be done.

3396
02:31:00,200 --> 02:31:03,860
However,
the problem is so gigantic.

3397
02:31:04,190 --> 02:31:06,860
The world is so enormous.
There are so many people.

3398
02:31:06,861 --> 02:31:09,110
There's so many competing financial 
factors.

3399
02:31:09,111 --> 02:31:14,111
There's so much shit going on that,
for any one group to try to fix it and 

3400
02:31:15,531 --> 02:31:18,410
they don't even work together,
which is so fucked up.

3401
02:31:18,411 --> 02:31:20,070
The cia and the fbi don't work

3402
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:21,240
together.
And pete with each other,

3403
02:31:21,241 --> 02:31:22,410
right?
There's competition.

3404
02:31:22,440 --> 02:31:24,120
WeLl,
that's how it portrays got busted.

3405
02:31:24,330 --> 02:31:28,140
They got busted because the fucking cia 
was getting investigated by the fbi.

3406
02:31:28,450 --> 02:31:30,990
They investigated,
portray as the fbi investigated,

3407
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:34,530
portrays the fucking head spook got 
spooked on.

3408
02:31:34,770 --> 02:31:39,770
I mean that's how we got busted.
That's how they found out about his 

3409
02:31:39,770 --> 02:31:42,261
affair.
I think women is really how he got 

3410
02:31:42,261 --> 02:31:44,331
busted though.
He allowed his personal life to take 

3411
02:31:44,331 --> 02:31:44,331
over.
Yes.

3412
02:31:44,331 --> 02:31:48,590
Granted,
I know absolutely nothing about this 

3413
02:31:48,590 --> 02:31:48,590
case,
but just from what little I know,

3414
02:31:48,590 --> 02:31:52,160
it seems like that's not something that 
would have happened if he had remained 

3415
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:54,891
100 percent above board.
That whole investigation that was set 

3416
02:31:54,891 --> 02:31:57,000
off by the fbi would have never happened
because it was that woman in tampa,

3417
02:31:57,270 --> 02:32:02,270
the socialite or whatever,
who triggered the whole fucking 

3418
02:32:02,270 --> 02:32:03,600
unraveling thing and once you unleash 
those kinds of forces,

3419
02:32:03,601 --> 02:32:05,100
I think they just keep digging until 
they.

3420
02:32:05,220 --> 02:32:07,170
Until they find something to crankin 
yeah.

3421
02:32:07,171 --> 02:32:09,470
It's a cracking.
You unleash that beast and you know,

3422
02:32:09,480 --> 02:32:12,030
knowing where it'll end up and it ended 
up with him losing his job.

3423
02:32:12,060 --> 02:32:17,060
Well,
isn't it hilarious too that he lost his 

3424
02:32:17,060 --> 02:32:18,831
job because of pussy.
He's the number one murderer in the 

3425
02:32:18,831 --> 02:32:18,980
country.
I mean he's basically,

3426
02:32:18,990 --> 02:32:21,840
that's what it is.
He murders bad guys for the country.

3427
02:32:22,140 --> 02:32:23,820
That's what a general is.
I mean,

3428
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:26,310
you don't want to say no murder.
Let's say killer.

3429
02:32:26,460 --> 02:32:27,530
Let's say eliminator.
Let's,

3430
02:32:27,531 --> 02:32:29,420
let's sanitize it.
He's,

3431
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:32,130
he's a warrior warrior.
Let's say warrior.

3432
02:32:32,190 --> 02:32:37,190
He's the head warrior.
Just go back to like the conan the 

3433
02:32:37,190 --> 02:32:38,370
barbarian books,
or watch a movie.

3434
02:32:38,371 --> 02:32:40,650
What it kona and do he slayed and he 
fucked.

3435
02:32:40,740 --> 02:32:43,620
That's what warriors do.
They slay and they fuck.

3436
02:32:43,710 --> 02:32:47,190
So we want these neutered warriors.
We want these warriors that don't.

3437
02:32:47,191 --> 02:32:48,570
Fuck.
We want these,

3438
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:53,760
these people that are over there just 
shooting the heads off of people from a 

3439
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:53,760
distance.

3440
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:55,260
Watch their heads explode and they don't
get any pussy.

3441
02:32:55,460 --> 02:33:00,460
They're,
they're stopping life on a regular 

3442
02:33:00,460 --> 02:33:00,460
basis,
doing what?

3443
02:33:00,460 --> 02:33:02,100
There's laWs against what the bible 
tells you you can't do,

3444
02:33:02,101 --> 02:33:07,101
but the bible,
you don't have to worry about the bible 

3445
02:33:07,101 --> 02:33:07,101
because you got a free pass from uncle 
sam.

3446
02:33:07,101 --> 02:33:11,601
We've talked to god and god says it's 
okay to kill these folks as long as 

3447
02:33:11,601 --> 02:33:11,601
well.
W,

3448
02:33:11,601 --> 02:33:12,480
what if we went into Iraq on a false 
premise?

3449
02:33:12,630 --> 02:33:17,630
God will forgive you.
I know you kill those people for no 

3450
02:33:17,630 --> 02:33:17,630
reason,
but hey,

3451
02:33:17,630 --> 02:33:17,630
um,
you didn't know any better,

3452
02:33:17,630 --> 02:33:19,470
so it's all good.
Well then who's to blame?

3453
02:33:19,530 --> 02:33:24,530
No one's to blame because the government
is essentially like a gigantic 

3454
02:33:24,530 --> 02:33:27,501
corporation that doesn't have real,
sort of like one person that you could 

3455
02:33:27,501 --> 02:33:29,400
pin it to is like a lot of people and 
whatever,

3456
02:33:29,401 --> 02:33:30,690
whatever.
Don't worry about it dude.

3457
02:33:30,860 --> 02:33:32,430
I mean that's essentially what's going 
on.

3458
02:33:32,550 --> 02:33:36,060
So that one guy who's the best general 
patraeus,

3459
02:33:36,090 --> 02:33:41,090
he's the guy,
there's the guy that whenever they went 

3460
02:33:41,090 --> 02:33:41,090
to the news and if there's something 
Afghanistan thing,

3461
02:33:41,090 --> 02:33:43,170
they went to general patraeus,
he can't get some pussy.

3462
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:44,490
Really?
You're going to,

3463
02:33:44,610 --> 02:33:48,080
you're going to hAte him because I look 
for his marriage vows aside.

3464
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:50,580
Of course his wife,
she'd be upset if she didn't know.

3465
02:33:50,730 --> 02:33:51,930
Of course,
you know,

3466
02:33:51,931 --> 02:33:56,931
if he lied about it.
That's kind of something to take into 

3467
02:33:56,931 --> 02:33:56,931
consideration when you factor in his 
character,

3468
02:33:57,030 --> 02:34:00,060
taken into consideration lightly when 
you really stop and think about how many

3469
02:34:00,061 --> 02:34:05,061
warriors in the past have had harems and
gingiss con fucked like every living 

3470
02:34:05,061 --> 02:34:08,450
human being in the year 12 slash 20.
I mean w w,

3471
02:34:08,470 --> 02:34:13,470
what are we pretending,
pretending these warriors are we 

3472
02:34:13,470 --> 02:34:13,470
pretending that they're,
you know,

3473
02:34:13,470 --> 02:34:18,100
some strange barbie doll can gi joe,
you know,

3474
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:20,680
Oregon list thing that just fights for 
god,

3475
02:34:20,690 --> 02:34:23,710
glory and country and doesn't have 
physical desires.

3476
02:34:23,910 --> 02:34:26,010
I was a awhile ago,
I had this guy,

3477
02:34:26,011 --> 02:34:31,011
David Brennan on my podcast and he was 
talking about how police and militaries 

3478
02:34:31,011 --> 02:34:34,770
and stuff,
I've only been professional flight the 

3479
02:34:34,770 --> 02:34:34,770
last hundred and 20 years or something 
before that,

3480
02:34:34,770 --> 02:34:37,710
they were just pretty much the enforcers
for whoever owned the land.

3481
02:34:37,711 --> 02:34:41,130
So if you were the feudal lord,
you would have your own police force who

3482
02:34:41,131 --> 02:34:43,980
had basically collect taxes and beat 
peasants and stuff.

3483
02:34:44,310 --> 02:34:49,310
We've only expected police and soldiers 
to be pr professional for the past 

3484
02:34:49,310 --> 02:34:54,140
hundred years.
So there's still kind of catching up 

3485
02:34:54,140 --> 02:34:54,870
because these are very old structures 
and you're using violence,

3486
02:34:54,871 --> 02:34:56,190
so it's hard to.
How do you mix?

3487
02:34:56,300 --> 02:35:00,120
It's always kind of boggled my mind that
cops will go from a fatal,

3488
02:35:00,170 --> 02:35:03,570
like some kind of fatal confrontation 
where they have to take somebody down to

3489
02:35:03,571 --> 02:35:07,140
15 minutes later they're at starbucks 
getting another coffee.

3490
02:35:07,141 --> 02:35:09,920
Like that's gotta be a weird fucking 
mind melt.

3491
02:35:10,260 --> 02:35:15,260
It's a,
they have a massive disconnect and I 

3492
02:35:15,260 --> 02:35:16,790
think it may very well be that a lot of 
them were taking antidepressants.

3493
02:35:16,960 --> 02:35:19,520
I know antidepressants in the military,
incredibly common.

3494
02:35:19,580 --> 02:35:23,120
It's one of the most prescribed 
medications for people that come back.

3495
02:35:23,121 --> 02:35:26,290
They have ptsd and people have issues 
and depressant.

3496
02:35:26,310 --> 02:35:27,920
Well,
let's google that because,

3497
02:35:27,921 --> 02:35:32,921
um,
I read an article recently about 

3498
02:35:32,921 --> 02:35:34,940
antidepressants in the military and I 
don't remember the exact statistics,

3499
02:35:35,270 --> 02:35:38,750
but it was in the military.
It was pretty disturbing,

3500
02:35:38,751 --> 02:35:43,751
but makes sense because they allow you 
to rationalize things in a way that 

3501
02:35:43,751 --> 02:35:45,980
you're not going to if you're not on 
that stuff.

3502
02:35:46,910 --> 02:35:47,880
Yeah.
Man.

3503
02:35:47,900 --> 02:35:50,570
Antidepressants in the military.
Yeah,

3504
02:35:50,571 --> 02:35:52,700
there's a lot.
There's a lot.

3505
02:35:52,701 --> 02:35:57,701
Man.
Military prescribes antidepressants to 

3506
02:35:57,701 --> 02:36:00,610
growing army of soldiers.
Okay.

3507
02:36:00,680 --> 02:36:05,680
Military says at 12 percent of its 
combat personnel in Iraq and 17 percent 

3508
02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:09,260
serving in Afghanistan are taking 
prescription antidepressants.

3509
02:36:09,290 --> 02:36:14,290
This is for 2008.
I can only assume the numbers have gone 

3510
02:36:14,290 --> 02:36:14,290
up.
Sure.

3511
02:36:14,290 --> 02:36:15,500
It's increased since then.
Of course it has.

3512
02:36:15,560 --> 02:36:17,600
If they found out there's money in it,
they look.

3513
02:36:17,780 --> 02:36:19,880
That's the beautiful thing about being a
corporation.

3514
02:36:19,881 --> 02:36:22,220
You have to maximize your profits every 
year.

3515
02:36:22,340 --> 02:36:24,290
Corporations just can't stay.
Hey,

3516
02:36:24,291 --> 02:36:27,860
we made x amount of money last year and 
we made the same this year,

3517
02:36:27,861 --> 02:36:29,970
so we're doing really good guys.
No,

3518
02:36:30,300 --> 02:36:32,000
no.
You have to continue to grow.

3519
02:36:32,001 --> 02:36:37,001
They want that infinite growth paradigm 
that I'm Peter Joseph always goes on and

3520
02:36:37,761 --> 02:36:40,220
on about and his documentaries.
I mean,

3521
02:36:40,221 --> 02:36:42,860
that's one of the most ridiculous 
aspects of corporations.

3522
02:36:43,070 --> 02:36:47,600
One of the most ridiculous aspects of 
the economy is the infinite growth idea.

3523
02:36:47,630 --> 02:36:52,630
The idea that you can just continue to 
get bigger and bigger every year until 

3524
02:36:52,630 --> 02:36:54,200
what you have all the money on the 
planet because that's where it goes.

3525
02:36:54,380 --> 02:36:57,800
If every fucking corporation actually 
continued to grow and,

3526
02:36:57,810 --> 02:37:00,770
and,
and stayed alive for 100,

3527
02:37:00,771 --> 02:37:02,540
50,
350,

3528
02:37:02,541 --> 02:37:04,100
a thousand years,
whatever it takes,

3529
02:37:04,280 --> 02:37:05,960
they should all have all the money in 
the world.

3530
02:37:06,260 --> 02:37:07,660
I mean,
what,

3531
02:37:07,850 --> 02:37:10,370
what happens then?
You can have infinite growth.

3532
02:37:10,371 --> 02:37:11,480
It doeSn't make sense.

3533
02:37:11,640 --> 02:37:16,640
It's a monopoly game.
Somebody ends up with all the pieces of 

3534
02:37:16,640 --> 02:37:16,640
paper by end,

3535
02:37:16,640 --> 02:37:16,920
right?
So if you know,

3536
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:22,280
you got to think that if the 
pharmaceutical companies were making 

3537
02:37:22,280 --> 02:37:25,820
untold millions of dollars in having 12 
percent of the soldiers in Iraq and 17 

3538
02:37:26,911 --> 02:37:30,210
percent in Afghanistan in 2008,
I mean,

3539
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:34,410
that was six years ago.
So what Is it now?

3540
02:37:34,530 --> 02:37:37,350
You know,
it's probably pretty fucking crazy.

3541
02:37:38,010 --> 02:37:40,890
Let's see.
Any precedence in the military in 2014.

3542
02:37:40,891 --> 02:37:45,891
Let's try that.
Two thousand 14 and let's see what it 

3543
02:37:45,891 --> 02:37:48,360
says.
Meanwhile,

3544
02:37:48,390 --> 02:37:53,390
by the way,
I'm just reading random blogs with a 

3545
02:37:53,390 --> 02:37:54,720
very quick and cursory google search 
with no vetting out whatsoever.

3546
02:37:54,721 --> 02:37:57,170
So they might be all full of shit.
But look,

3547
02:37:57,240 --> 02:37:59,430
we don't even have to look into it.
Whatever the numbers are,

3548
02:37:59,450 --> 02:38:01,990
those are all abstract anyway.
We know that It's a,

3549
02:38:02,040 --> 02:38:07,040
it's people.
People are definitely on it and that's 

3550
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:07,040
kind of crazy that you,
uh,

3551
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:08,580
you know,
you take people and you put them in this

3552
02:38:08,610 --> 02:38:13,610
terrible situation.
He yanked them out of their lives and 

3553
02:38:13,610 --> 02:38:13,610
you've,
you know,

3554
02:38:13,610 --> 02:38:13,610
you send them over to these,

3555
02:38:13,610 --> 02:38:15,570
now they've got to kill people and then 
they come home and yeah,

3556
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:20,840
their wife is sleeping with somebody 
else or their girlfriend has left them 

3557
02:38:20,840 --> 02:38:22,380
and then they have the ptsd crack,
crack down,

3558
02:38:22,710 --> 02:38:24,000
can't deal with life anymore.

3559
02:38:24,100 --> 02:38:25,480
I know a dude who,
um,

3560
02:38:25,570 --> 02:38:30,310
they just recently shot a guy and I know
he was having some ptsd issues.

3561
02:38:30,311 --> 02:38:32,560
I don't know what the exact 
circumstances were.

3562
02:38:32,860 --> 02:38:37,860
There was a car accident.
Someone rear ended him and he wound up 

3563
02:38:37,860 --> 02:38:37,860
shooting some guy.
Wow.

3564
02:38:37,860 --> 02:38:38,170
Yeah.
And I don't know.

3565
02:38:38,770 --> 02:38:39,510
He's,
you know,

3566
02:38:39,580 --> 02:38:44,580
he hasn't gone to court yet about it.
I know that they're trying to put 

3567
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:47,881
together the case and try to figure out 
what the exact circumstances where the 

3568
02:38:47,881 --> 02:38:47,881
guy rear ended him.
Who knows.

3569
02:38:47,881 --> 02:38:48,850
The guy might've been crazy,
who knows?

3570
02:38:49,140 --> 02:38:50,890
And he might've really been defending 
himself.

3571
02:38:50,980 --> 02:38:52,390
Who knows?
I don't know,

3572
02:38:52,420 --> 02:38:57,420
but that's an issue when people are used
to killing people and people have been 

3573
02:38:57,420 --> 02:38:58,120
over there for a while.
This guy,

3574
02:38:58,510 --> 02:39:03,510
he did a tour more than one and then he 
also went back and did black water 

3575
02:39:03,510 --> 02:39:06,040
stuff.
So without a doubt he's seen some shit.

3576
02:39:06,560 --> 02:39:08,120
You've seen dirty wars by now,
right?

3577
02:39:08,440 --> 02:39:09,130
Yeah,
yeah,

3578
02:39:09,140 --> 02:39:10,490
yeah.
That's pretty disturbing the.

3579
02:39:10,700 --> 02:39:11,480
Yeah,
it is.

3580
02:39:11,540 --> 02:39:12,160
Yeah.
Um,

3581
02:39:12,161 --> 02:39:13,700
I'm trying to get that guy on the 
podcast.

3582
02:39:13,701 --> 02:39:15,100
I was actually watching summit last 
night.

3583
02:39:15,140 --> 02:39:16,310
Jeremy scahill.
Yeah.

3584
02:39:17,210 --> 02:39:18,410
Um,
I think,

3585
02:39:18,411 --> 02:39:19,460
um,
you know,

3586
02:39:19,550 --> 02:39:24,550
we're,
we're living in a strange time where a 

3587
02:39:24,550 --> 02:39:24,550
guy can make a documentary like that,
you know,

3588
02:39:24,550 --> 02:39:29,021
we're living in a strange time where you
could talk about documentary like that 

3589
02:39:29,021 --> 02:39:29,540
for hours and hours.
Your podcast or this product

3590
02:39:29,620 --> 02:39:34,620
as part of the.
It's part of the reason I love America 

3591
02:39:34,620 --> 02:39:34,620
as we can always self correct.
Yeah.

3592
02:39:34,620 --> 02:39:36,280
We're not doing this podcast in a 
basement somewhere.

3593
02:39:36,290 --> 02:39:41,290
Worried about the fucking syrian army 
storming in here and torturing us like 

3594
02:39:41,290 --> 02:39:44,981
they are just,
if you're in a different part of the 

3595
02:39:44,981 --> 02:39:46,871
world,
the only difference is you're in a 

3596
02:39:46,871 --> 02:39:46,871
different area.
Yeah.

3597
02:39:46,871 --> 02:39:46,871
You no longer have these rights and you 
gotta be careful.

3598
02:39:46,970 --> 02:39:48,860
We thankfully don't have that and I want
to,

3599
02:39:48,950 --> 02:39:50,660
I want to see that remain.
Obviously

3600
02:39:50,770 --> 02:39:54,220
I do too,
and I think that it's not just America,

3601
02:39:54,221 --> 02:39:57,370
it's a world and I think the idea of a 
country like America,

3602
02:39:57,910 --> 02:40:02,910
I think ultimately the goal would be to 
have the whole world up to the same 

3603
02:40:02,910 --> 02:40:06,031
standard that we hold ourselves to and 
have a global community of people that 

3604
02:40:06,031 --> 02:40:10,471
are essentially,
you could have the same rights 

3605
02:40:10,471 --> 02:40:10,471
everywhere you go and there's no 
oppressive north korean regime is.

3606
02:40:10,471 --> 02:40:12,730
There's no places like Syria that's 
still hold.

3607
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:14,220
There's no places that

3608
02:40:14,540 --> 02:40:19,540
I think it's really shameful that we 
haven't gone in North Korea yet because 

3609
02:40:19,540 --> 02:40:19,760
I understand people are like,
what can we do?

3610
02:40:19,850 --> 02:40:24,850
We've got to do something.
It's a humanitarian disaster like 

3611
02:40:24,850 --> 02:40:24,850
humanity basically watching another 
holocaust.

3612
02:40:25,190 --> 02:40:30,190
Nobody wants to take the uh,
nobody wants to take the loss on it 

3613
02:40:30,190 --> 02:40:34,371
because it's going to be messy and it's 
going to take time and money and 

3614
02:40:34,371 --> 02:40:34,371
probably going to lose some.
There's going to be,

3615
02:40:34,371 --> 02:40:35,270
well,
South Korea is going to lose.

3616
02:40:35,530 --> 02:40:38,630
That's our ally and that's a real issue 
because it's right there.

3617
02:40:38,690 --> 02:40:43,690
But I don't think as a modern society,
we can see all this shit on the 

3618
02:40:43,690 --> 02:40:46,121
internet.
We can't just let them continue to kill 

3619
02:40:46,121 --> 02:40:46,121
people.
The other,

3620
02:40:46,121 --> 02:40:46,880
I think the other month he uh,
his girlfriend,

3621
02:40:46,881 --> 02:40:51,881
he just wiped out like all of her family
or friends or some shit over some 

3622
02:40:51,881 --> 02:40:52,310
nonexistent.
A sligHt.

3623
02:40:52,410 --> 02:40:53,820
Well,
he executed his ex wife.

3624
02:40:53,910 --> 02:40:56,950
Is that what it was?
He executed his ex girlfriend and uh,

3625
02:40:57,030 --> 02:41:01,200
he executed his uncle who is thinking 
about establishing a coo.

3626
02:41:01,470 --> 02:41:03,150
And then he executed all of his uncle's 
family.

3627
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:06,660
He executed his uncle's sons who were 
innocent and they were 20 years old,

3628
02:41:06,661 --> 02:41:08,460
but he knew that they would come back to
get him one day.

3629
02:41:08,461 --> 02:41:10,770
So he executed them.
He executed everyone.

3630
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:15,920
Meanwhile,
the us government is fixated on guys 

3631
02:41:15,920 --> 02:41:16,020
like kim.com.
why don't they go after this fucking guy

3632
02:41:16,021 --> 02:41:17,870
in North Korea?
very good point.

3633
02:41:17,900 --> 02:41:22,900
Use the same kind of resources against 
somebody like that rather than someone 

3634
02:41:22,900 --> 02:41:22,900
who's a,

3635
02:41:22,900 --> 02:41:27,300
you know,
I would be concerned with military 

3636
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:27,730
operations because it's so close to 
South Korea and I think they've publicly

3637
02:41:27,731 --> 02:41:30,580
stated that they would launch nukes at 
South Korea if there were ever invaded.

3638
02:41:30,870 --> 02:41:32,170
We're,
we're so clever.

3639
02:41:32,171 --> 02:41:34,480
If there was some kind of resource we 
wanted in North Korea,

3640
02:41:34,870 --> 02:41:39,870
we would find.
We would find a diplomatic way to 

3641
02:41:39,870 --> 02:41:39,870
resolve it.
Okay.

3642
02:41:39,870 --> 02:41:41,350
But are we or are we not?
I mean we have to decide are we retarded

3643
02:41:41,450 --> 02:41:44,530
or we goofy fucks that do stupid shit 
that we could point out easily.

3644
02:41:44,531 --> 02:41:49,531
Or are we these super clever geniuses 
that know how to circumvent any security

3645
02:41:49,611 --> 02:41:50,560
systems?
I think,

3646
02:41:50,790 --> 02:41:53,470
I think halt the nukes.
I think that we are a,

3647
02:41:53,830 --> 02:41:55,270
we're convenient if the core

3648
02:41:55,400 --> 02:42:00,400
really smart,
but we have all these layers of 

3649
02:42:00,400 --> 02:42:00,400
stupidity and not all of the layers are 
connected.

3650
02:42:00,400 --> 02:42:02,540
Some of it is just stupidity.
It's not there for any reason,

3651
02:42:02,670 --> 02:42:03,120
you know?

3652
02:42:03,800 --> 02:42:04,770
I don't know.
You know,

3653
02:42:04,800 --> 02:42:09,800
I don't know what the answer is.
I don't know what our reaL capabilities 

3654
02:42:09,800 --> 02:42:09,800
are and I probably shouldn't know since 
I'm not in the military,

3655
02:42:09,800 --> 02:42:10,520
you know,
I would just,

3656
02:42:10,640 --> 02:42:13,040
I would love to be able to trust them 
wholeheartedly.

3657
02:42:13,070 --> 02:42:18,070
I would love to,
would love to be able to step back and 

3658
02:42:18,070 --> 02:42:18,070
say,
hey,

3659
02:42:18,070 --> 02:42:20,751
you know,
if they're invading a country because 

3660
02:42:20,751 --> 02:42:20,751
that country is filled with fucking 
assholes and those assholes are going to

3661
02:42:20,751 --> 02:42:22,490
kill innocent people worldwide.
I would love that.

3662
02:42:22,790 --> 02:42:26,270
I really would love that.
And I'm not an anti military guy.

3663
02:42:26,330 --> 02:42:31,330
I'm a realist.
I'm a realist when it comes to human 

3664
02:42:31,330 --> 02:42:31,330
nature and I'm a realist when it comes 
to human history.

3665
02:42:31,330 --> 02:42:36,090
If you look at the world,
there's never been a time of peace ever 

3666
02:42:36,090 --> 02:42:37,490
in the entire world,
ever from the time that we were shut out

3667
02:42:37,491 --> 02:42:40,100
of the first monkey mama,
until you know,

3668
02:42:40,290 --> 02:42:45,290
fighting over a fucking deer leg or 
whatever the hell we were fighting over 

3669
02:42:45,290 --> 02:42:49,181
back then to today.
There's never been one day on earth 

3670
02:42:49,181 --> 02:42:52,841
where no one died.
There's never been one day on earth 

3671
02:42:52,841 --> 02:42:53,540
where no one dropped a rock on someone's
head from the top of a cliff.

3672
02:42:53,541 --> 02:42:57,260
There's never been one day on earth 
where people didn't fight to the death.

3673
02:42:57,380 --> 02:43:02,380
It's always happened.
it's always been a part of what we are 

3674
02:43:02,380 --> 02:43:05,470
and like the yin and the yang that we 
were discussing earlier that sort of 

3675
02:43:05,470 --> 02:43:09,461
exist in as a,
a natural part of just life in the 

3676
02:43:09,461 --> 02:43:11,500
universe.
There's this push and there's,

3677
02:43:11,501 --> 02:43:11,680
this

3678
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:13,210
does tie,
goes in.

3679
02:43:13,211 --> 02:43:17,160
The tide goes out.
Bill o'reilly can't explain that.

3680
02:43:17,220 --> 02:43:19,600
You can't explain that I'm in jesus his 
corner.

3681
02:43:19,930 --> 02:43:23,020
But I think that there's,
there's something to that.

3682
02:43:23,021 --> 02:43:26,500
And there's something also to something 
that I harp on quite often,

3683
02:43:26,501 --> 02:43:31,501
but I think it's an important point.
We'd like to look at all the different 

3684
02:43:31,501 --> 02:43:35,020
sort of areas of the world where 
there's,

3685
02:43:35,290 --> 02:43:40,290
what we call natural phenomenon or 
natural examples of strange behavior or 

3686
02:43:40,290 --> 02:43:42,530
observed behavior or,
um,

3687
02:43:42,640 --> 02:43:46,720
natural cycles of whether it's a weather
patterns or whether it's,

3688
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:48,490
you know,
whatever it is.

3689
02:43:48,491 --> 02:43:51,880
We lOok at all these things as being 
very natural except for ourselves.

3690
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:54,460
For whatever reason,
when it comes to human beings,

3691
02:43:54,461 --> 02:43:57,490
we decided that because we're sentient,
because we're,

3692
02:43:57,520 --> 02:44:00,760
we have the ability to rationalize and 
think and communicate.

3693
02:44:00,910 --> 02:44:03,220
We don't think what we do is natural 
when we think,

3694
02:44:03,221 --> 02:44:05,050
well we do is just some,
well,

3695
02:44:05,051 --> 02:44:07,210
you know,
as a society we have to be civilized and

3696
02:44:07,211 --> 02:44:09,460
think things through and that might all 
be natural.

3697
02:44:09,460 --> 02:44:14,460
It wouldn't.
We might be seeing with humanity is a 

3698
02:44:14,460 --> 02:44:16,741
really complicated version of what goes 
on in an anthill will we might be 

3699
02:44:16,741 --> 02:44:21,151
seeing.
It's just some really natural behavior 

3700
02:44:21,151 --> 02:44:22,390
that's just on some next level,
fractal shit.

3701
02:44:22,540 --> 02:44:27,280
It's just so uber complicated because 
there's so many of us and you're dealing

3702
02:44:27,281 --> 02:44:32,281
in,
you're factoring in information as well 

3703
02:44:32,281 --> 02:44:35,041
as the instincts to breed the instincts 
to dominate and have food and resources 

3704
02:44:35,860 --> 02:44:39,790
on top of all those other things.
You're also dealing with communication.

3705
02:44:39,970 --> 02:44:42,310
You're dealing with the ability to 
exchange information.

3706
02:44:42,311 --> 02:44:47,311
Also the ability to enhance yourself 
with that exchanged information and 

3707
02:44:47,311 --> 02:44:49,330
alter perspectives.
A wolf stays a wolf.

3708
02:44:49,331 --> 02:44:51,290
It's whole life.
You give a douchebag.

3709
02:44:51,320 --> 02:44:56,320
Some mushrooms,
he becomes a really introspective 

3710
02:44:56,320 --> 02:44:56,320
person.
At least for a few hours.

3711
02:44:56,320 --> 02:44:58,240
He'd become a yoga instructor,
was enough times.

3712
02:44:58,440 --> 02:45:03,440
Yeah,
I mean there's a lot of people that 

3713
02:45:03,440 --> 02:45:04,300
changed because of experiences and 
information and,

3714
02:45:04,301 --> 02:45:04,790
and,
and,

3715
02:45:04,791 --> 02:45:09,791
and just life,
giving them something that forces them 

3716
02:45:09,791 --> 02:45:13,111
to examine the,
the box that they put the world in life 

3717
02:45:13,111 --> 02:45:17,341
gives them something that they've,
they've sort of been forced to sort of 

3718
02:45:17,341 --> 02:45:20,880
get a new perspective that doesn't 
happen in the animal world and that's 

3719
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:23,860
why you have to add in and factor in all
these variables and look at human beings

3720
02:45:23,861 --> 02:45:25,480
and say it seems natural.

3721
02:45:25,630 --> 02:45:29,230
What we're doing seems natural.
And I think that along with,

3722
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:30,300
you know,
uh,

3723
02:45:30,410 --> 02:45:35,410
bears male bears eating the young cubs 
to force the female to keep breeding.

3724
02:45:36,790 --> 02:45:39,300
I mean all that stuff is natural too.
It just,

3725
02:45:39,330 --> 02:45:41,680
it's,
it's disgusting and horrible to watch,

3726
02:45:41,681 --> 02:45:44,110
but it's all natural.
We're working it out,

3727
02:45:44,170 --> 02:45:46,060
we're working it out.
We are working it out.

3728
02:45:46,090 --> 02:45:47,720
I really think we are.
Um,

3729
02:45:47,800 --> 02:45:49,840
but I'm,
I'm confident about it.

3730
02:45:49,900 --> 02:45:54,260
I'm confident about it because the 
effects in my own life of,

3731
02:45:54,300 --> 02:45:56,820
of education.
And when I say education,

3732
02:45:56,821 --> 02:45:57,670
I mean formal.
I mean,

3733
02:45:57,671 --> 02:46:02,671
just reading things and being exposed to
information and be exposed to wife 

3734
02:46:02,671 --> 02:46:04,270
experience,
just doing this fucking podcast man,

3735
02:46:04,271 --> 02:46:09,271
just talking to people like yourself,
just having conversations with people 

3736
02:46:09,271 --> 02:46:12,571
and hashing things out and then seeing 
the reactions to these conversations 

3737
02:46:12,571 --> 02:46:13,970
that people have online where they join 
in.

3738
02:46:13,971 --> 02:46:15,620
They started discussing things on 
twitter,

3739
02:46:15,621 --> 02:46:18,320
discussing things on facebook.
I've seen people you know,

3740
02:46:18,530 --> 02:46:23,530
have conversations in person about 
things that have happened on the 

3741
02:46:23,530 --> 02:46:23,530
podcast.
Well,

3742
02:46:23,530 --> 02:46:23,530
hey,
you know,

3743
02:46:23,530 --> 02:46:27,701
I,
I found out about this and then I 

3744
02:46:27,701 --> 02:46:27,701
started researching into this and then I
changed my diet because of that and then

3745
02:46:27,701 --> 02:46:32,621
this and that and this and that.
It's one of the reasons why 

3746
02:46:32,621 --> 02:46:35,530
misinformation like the aspe thing so 
frustrating and it really pisses me off 

3747
02:46:35,530 --> 02:46:38,090
because it's in.
It's in the wrong spirit of this thing.

3748
02:46:38,360 --> 02:46:39,830
It's in the wrong spirit of what we're 
trying to.

3749
02:46:39,830 --> 02:46:40,280
You do?
Yeah.

3750
02:46:40,281 --> 02:46:42,190
You shouldn't have a scarcity mindset.
Everybody.

3751
02:46:42,230 --> 02:46:44,690
Coffee's a fucking huge market.
Everybody can have a piece.

3752
02:46:44,750 --> 02:46:49,750
Well,
famine thinking doesn't have any logic 

3753
02:46:49,750 --> 02:46:49,750
attached to it.
Fam and thinking is just.

3754
02:46:49,750 --> 02:46:50,990
It is what it is.
I got to piss again.

3755
02:46:51,290 --> 02:46:52,580
Powerful piss again.
Well,

3756
02:46:52,581 --> 02:46:55,560
we're going to play the godzilla trailer
is something about it.

3757
02:46:55,590 --> 02:46:57,320
It's delicious by the way.

3758
02:46:57,670 --> 02:46:59,890
Stock and cto eIther.
They're just nice people.

3759
02:46:59,891 --> 02:47:03,960
We like them to play the godzilla 
trailer because it looks dope as fuck.

3760
02:47:03,961 --> 02:47:06,520
And bryan cranston from breaking bad is 
a fucking star.

3761
02:47:06,760 --> 02:47:08,680
It's gonna be epic.
God damn,

3762
02:47:08,681 --> 02:47:11,200
this looks good.
I want to talk to somebody in charge.

3763
02:47:14,360 --> 02:47:17,750
You're not fooling anybody when you say 
that.

3764
02:47:17,751 --> 02:47:22,751
What happened was a natural disaster.
You're lying.

3765
02:47:24,760 --> 02:47:29,760
It was not an earthquake.
It wasn't a typhoon because what's 

3766
02:47:31,411 --> 02:47:34,270
really happening is that you're hiding 
something out,

3767
02:47:43,840 --> 02:47:48,840
by the way,
is the greatest promoted back to the 

3768
02:47:48,840 --> 02:47:49,390
stove ever had been so good at releasing
shit.

3769
02:47:49,391 --> 02:47:49,930
Slowly

3770
02:47:55,520 --> 02:47:57,050
pop It right up on the ocean.

3771
02:48:03,340 --> 02:48:05,800
If you're listening and watching,

3772
02:48:08,320 --> 02:48:13,040
you're seeing a bunch of cool shit.
Your tests in the pacific.

3773
02:48:28,810 --> 02:48:30,110
No idea what's coming.

3774
02:48:33,020 --> 02:48:35,830
They're so good about not showing you 
much to kill it.

3775
02:48:49,460 --> 02:48:50,090
Control

3776
02:48:58,290 --> 02:49:03,290
and not the other way around.
There's the arrogance of man,

3777
02:49:05,710 --> 02:49:08,730
so godzilla is coming next as well.
That would unite us.

3778
02:49:08,880 --> 02:49:10,890
This motherfucker popped out of the 
ocean for sure.

3779
02:49:13,110 --> 02:49:17,730
This looks really good luck yet.
Please god,

3780
02:49:17,731 --> 02:49:18,450
don't let it suck.

3781
02:49:22,550 --> 02:49:23,720
Oh yeah,
baby.

3782
02:49:23,721 --> 02:49:28,721
My dick is rock hard and it is good 
disaster point right there.

3783
02:49:29,910 --> 02:49:32,810
Fuck it is.
I love a good monster movie.

3784
02:49:32,900 --> 02:49:35,990
There's not enough.
So thanks to Ronald Greene of cto,

3785
02:49:35,991 --> 02:49:40,991
coconut water for keeping us with 
coconut water that made david seaman 

3786
02:49:40,991 --> 02:49:41,750
piss not once,
but twice.

3787
02:49:41,990 --> 02:49:45,410
And the three hour podcasts.
I'm a kid times,

3788
02:49:45,411 --> 02:49:46,580
man.
It was a fun podcast,

3789
02:49:46,581 --> 02:49:47,390
but yeah,
this is fun.

3790
02:49:47,650 --> 02:49:49,280
Um,
uh,

3791
02:49:49,281 --> 02:49:54,281
does anything that people need to know?
Anything you've got going on your 

3792
02:49:54,281 --> 02:49:54,740
podcast is how they get it.
David seaman,

3793
02:49:54,741 --> 02:49:56,420
our itunes,
itunes.

3794
02:49:56,421 --> 02:49:58,040
Anything else that on stitcher as well?
No,

3795
02:49:58,041 --> 02:49:59,320
I'm not really promoting anything right 
now.

3796
02:49:59,330 --> 02:50:00,740
So it's not on stitcher.
Oh,

3797
02:50:00,741 --> 02:50:01,590
it's on stitcher.
Yellow.

3798
02:50:01,630 --> 02:50:02,950
I just saved me like other projects.
No,

3799
02:50:02,960 --> 02:50:03,260
no,
no,

3800
02:50:03,320 --> 02:50:05,450
but it's on stitcher.
It is available.

3801
02:50:05,451 --> 02:50:10,451
It's just straight mp3 format as well,
so they don't have to get it off of 

3802
02:50:10,451 --> 02:50:10,451
itunes.

3803
02:50:10,451 --> 02:50:10,451
Exactly.
They want that.

3804
02:50:10,451 --> 02:50:13,070
They can just google david seaman hour 
and it's like the first or second.

3805
02:50:13,280 --> 02:50:15,120
Please don't make fun of his name.
Okay.

3806
02:50:15,140 --> 02:50:17,390
The kid grew up with david seaman.
I like it.

3807
02:50:17,391 --> 02:50:22,391
Now.
It's one of those things that you're 

3808
02:50:22,391 --> 02:50:24,500
uncomfortable about at middle school 
because it's still so new to you as a 28

3809
02:50:24,501 --> 02:50:26,220
year old guy will turn into 28 next 
week.

3810
02:50:26,221 --> 02:50:31,221
Like I'm kind of over the whole last 
name is [inaudible] thing like good for 

3811
02:50:31,221 --> 02:50:31,221
you.
Whatever you know.

3812
02:50:31,221 --> 02:50:33,140
And what's wrong with them?
Nothing.

3813
02:50:33,350 --> 02:50:36,200
The bedrock of human society makes 
humans,

3814
02:50:36,620 --> 02:50:38,360
you know,
it's like a cement.

3815
02:50:39,020 --> 02:50:41,750
Whatever buildings.
It's memorable,

3816
02:50:41,751 --> 02:50:43,890
which I like.
If your name was David Steele,

3817
02:50:44,490 --> 02:50:49,490
no problem.
What a steel makes still makes 

3818
02:50:49,490 --> 02:50:49,490
buildings.
Everybody wants to come.

3819
02:50:49,490 --> 02:50:49,760
Nothing wrong with come.
Definitely.

3820
02:50:49,970 --> 02:50:52,220
Because if your name was david seaman in
your mouth,

3821
02:50:52,880 --> 02:50:54,900
then we'd have an issue if you need to 
change.

3822
02:50:54,920 --> 02:50:57,830
My last name was david seaman in your 
mouth and you're a guy.

3823
02:50:58,080 --> 02:51:00,140
Like if that was like the full name.
Hi,

3824
02:51:00,141 --> 02:51:02,030
my name is David Stevenson in your 
mouth.

3825
02:51:02,090 --> 02:51:04,520
And I'm a guy.
Yeah,

3826
02:51:04,620 --> 02:51:09,620
I do a name change.
I'd be like a smith and my parents are 

3827
02:51:09,620 --> 02:51:11,280
just fucking assholes.
Uh,

3828
02:51:11,300 --> 02:51:12,560
let's,
let's change her last name,

3829
02:51:12,561 --> 02:51:14,210
but dick in the ass when he.
Kanye west,

3830
02:51:14,211 --> 02:51:16,730
name is kidd north north.
That's not too bad.

3831
02:51:16,731 --> 02:51:18,170
I thought it was weird.
Weird.

3832
02:51:18,260 --> 02:51:20,420
It's annoying.
It's egocentric.

3833
02:51:21,350 --> 02:51:26,350
It's gross.
He'll regret it when it's kid fucking 

3834
02:51:26,350 --> 02:51:27,920
susan gets older.
Not that that's going to happen.

3835
02:51:28,310 --> 02:51:29,810
Um,
so the david seaman,

3836
02:51:29,811 --> 02:51:31,190
our david seaman,
our,

3837
02:51:31,191 --> 02:51:36,191
the last guest was the ceo of a bitcoin 
exchange and I grilled him on whether 

3838
02:51:36,201 --> 02:51:41,201
it's good time to buy.
So I'm totally hypocritical because I 

3839
02:51:41,201 --> 02:51:41,201
had never had a problem with moon unit 
zappa.

3840
02:51:41,201 --> 02:51:42,980
If I didn't have a problem with moon 
unit zappa.

3841
02:51:42,981 --> 02:51:44,760
Why do I care about northwest?
I had apologized.

3842
02:51:44,810 --> 02:51:45,710
Kanye.
You're righT,

3843
02:51:45,711 --> 02:51:47,000
man.
Nothing wrong with northwest.

3844
02:51:47,480 --> 02:51:48,520
That's good.
If you will.

3845
02:51:48,540 --> 02:51:50,690
I didn't have a problem.
If you didn't apologize right there,

3846
02:51:50,691 --> 02:51:55,040
he'd probably be tweeting you in a few 
hours with a obtain rogan.

3847
02:51:55,490 --> 02:52:00,060
He's allowed to sit the man.
He's the biggest rOck star fall.

3848
02:52:01,250 --> 02:52:02,540
Anyway.
If you're a geniuS,

3849
02:52:02,541 --> 02:52:04,010
you have to acknowledge that you're a 
genius.

3850
02:52:04,130 --> 02:52:04,970
Exactly.
You have to.

3851
02:52:05,190 --> 02:52:05,780
You're not a genius.

3852
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:09,130
It doesn't count david seaman,
our ladies and gentlemen.

3853
02:52:10,180 --> 02:52:11,290
Brian,
what do you got going on?

3854
02:52:11,291 --> 02:52:12,640
Did you have some dates coming up soon?

3855
02:52:12,710 --> 02:52:13,670

A little weed.

Like I sAid,
it's one of the coolest venues in the

02:54:35,560 --> 02:54:37,361
country.
It's a dope old school club that's been

around.
Kennison used to perform there.

David seaman hour on itunes and stitcher

3910
02:54:43,190 --> 02:54:43,880
and the internet.
Anything else?

3911
02:54:43,881 --> 02:54:45,410
David?
Anything of the last message?

3912
02:54:45,500 --> 02:54:49,310
If you were the last moment on earth,
you have to say something and it's going

3913
02:54:49,311 --> 02:54:54,311
to be encapsulated and spread the future
generations so they won't make the same 

3914
02:54:54,311 --> 02:54:54,311
mistake.
What would it be?

3915
02:54:54,311 --> 02:54:58,920
America is mostly doing it right.
We just got to fix the small parts and 

3916
02:54:58,920 --> 02:54:59,280
uh,
I guess that's what I believe it with.

3917
02:54:59,610 --> 02:55:01,890
I would say get it together,
bitches,

3918
02:55:02,310 --> 02:55:03,770
and thanks for having me.
This is awesome.

3919
02:55:03,771 --> 02:55:04,130
And keep

3920
02:55:04,130 --> 02:55:04,760
it together,
bitches.

3921
02:55:04,761 --> 02:55:09,761
Yeah.
We have to do this more often than we 

3922
02:55:09,761 --> 02:55:09,761
absolutely will.
All right.

3923
02:55:09,761 --> 02:55:09,761
Much love people.
See you soon.
