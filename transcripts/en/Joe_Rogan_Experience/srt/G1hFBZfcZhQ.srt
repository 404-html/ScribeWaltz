1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,100
Is when they walk in.
Alright.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,690
We are live.
Ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:05,580
The Joe Rogan experience podcast.
Yes.

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,540
Oops,
that's me.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,760
I'm the one that he has to turn off his 
phone.

6
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:14,140
Oh,
you have to turn off your volume,

7
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:16,270
John,
on your computer and your computer

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,140
computer and your computer.
If you hear the delay.

9
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:22,900
John,
let's flip down the volume.

10
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,070
So there we go.
Okay.

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,040
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is 
brought to you by the flashlight.

12
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,680
If you go to Joe Rogan.net,
click on the link for the fleshlight and

13
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:34,681
enter in the code name Rogan.
You will save yourself 50 percent off 

14
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:36,340
the number one sex toys for men either.
Yeah.

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,640
Can you hear us?
John John Speakers and he.

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,850
John Anthony West is trying to figure 
out his phone.

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:46,710
Please.

18
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,600
Did we lose the skype connection?

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,240
Huh?

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,850
Did we lose a skype connection with him?
Yeah,

21
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,510
but he's not a.
He doesn't hear us.

22
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,660
Hey.
No one I.

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,880
something is.
Yeah,

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,950
he turns the volume off on his computer.
Were you listening to us through your 

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,950
computer?
Through your phone?

26
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,320
You need to turn the volume off on 
ustream page.

27
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,680
So there should be on the,
if you're looking at Ustream,

28
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,520
there should be a mute button on the 
actual video that you're watching.

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,400
What I'm guessing is is that you are 
using a skype phone and so when you 

30
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,040
muted your computer it probably needs 
everything.

31
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,300
Oh,
that makes sense.

32
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,470
There you go.
So sir,

33
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,110
if you see the lower right hand corner 
of the video,

34
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,600
we're under under the words Joe Rogan 
experience.

35
00:01:39,601 --> 00:01:42,060
The lower right hand corner is like a 
little volume icon.

36
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,400
If you just killed that,
that should fix everything.

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,620
Corner low,
lower,

38
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,530
lower right hand corner of the window.
The video window window.

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,680
The video window is this thing that 
literally circling thing and there's the

40
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,450
uh,
there's like there should be a volume 

41
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:02,670
button on your left.
Yes.

42
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,600
The far left.
Yes.

43
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,850
Yeah.
Just kill it and just turn off the 

44
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:10,850
volume.
I did that.

45
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:10,850
There you go.
Beautiful.

46
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,880
Hi,

doesn't know too much about ustream.

48
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,580
Very limited genius.

66
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:13,321
Brian.
We're going to start this bitch 

67
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,690
experience Joe Rogan podcast.
This ladies and gentlemen is a very,

68
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:27,940
very special edition of the Joe Rogan 
experience.

69
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,941
First of all,
because the first one we've ever done 

70
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:35,370
through skype and a two because it is 
with one of my personal heroes that I'm 

71
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,700
honored to get to talk to a man named 
John Anthony West.

72
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,360
John is an egyptologist,
uh,

73
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:42,720
of,
uh,

74
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,760
you know,
somebody on twitter had a very great 

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,861
comment about.
You said that you're more of a proof 

76
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:49,861
reader for history.
It's more,

77
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:50,320
you're more than an egyptologist.

78
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,690
Okay.
I'm done.

79
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,600
School,
depending on my audience,

80
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,240
I sometimes call myself a rogue 
egyptologist,

81
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,390
a rogue egyptologist.
And if you folks who aren't seeing 

82
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:03,390
online,
if you're listening to this,

83
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,891
only on Itunes,
John has an office that is exactly what 

84
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:10,210
I would hope and pray his office would 
look like,

85
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:13,180
just filled with documents and 
information and books.

86
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:14,590
And it's crazy,
man.

87
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:18,850
Look at all that information behind you.
You look like a mad scientist.

88
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,650
You look like Alex Jones,
this car.

89
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,520
Yeah.
You're,

90
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:23,020
you're a mad scientist,
sir.

91
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,960
People have called me that.
Yes.

92
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,120
I first was turned onto your work by the
NBC special on the Sphinx that was 

93
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,450
hosted by Charlton Heston,
which was a very controversial thing 

94
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,120
that NBC aired right,
and it was a special on the mysteries of

95
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:49,121
the dating of the Sphinx and became 
absolutely fascinated by the compelling 

96
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:54,701
evidence that you and Dr.
Schoch presented to all these 

97
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:58,481
traditional egyptologists that the rain 
erosion on this function closure had to 

98
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:03,110
have come from literally the seven or 
8,000

99
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:06,680
years earlier than they were predated 
than they were dating this finks

100
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,900
yeah,
probably more than that Gel and we'll 

101
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:12,900
get into that if we want to discuss it 
further,

102
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,450
but that's the.
That was the most conservative date.

103
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,540
That shock as a,
you know,

104
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,660
as a bonafide phd geologist.
He's sort of constrained to take the 

105
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:27,640
most conservative view,
but even had doubts about it when he was

106
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,580
saying it,
but now he's,

107
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,150
he's loosening up by a lot and it's 
basically on,

108
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,430
on the same car as me.
In other words,

109
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:41,431
holding open the possibility that it may
be as old as actually as $36,000

110
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:48,141
bc or even older.
And the reason for that is not Santa 

111
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:51,841
sizing or anything of the sort of stuff.
The Egyptians themselves in several in 

112
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:54,310
London,
in a tablet,

113
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,940
a stele coal,
the Palermo stone because not because it

114
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:02,180
has anything to do with land,
but because that's where it is.

115
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,030
And another virus,
very fragmentary,

116
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,540
called the turn for Paris,
where the Egyptians themselves,

117
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:13,541
ancient Egyptians talk about long 
periods prior to the beginning of what 

118
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:16,750
we call dynastic Egypt,
Egypt,

119
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,980
that begins around 3,500
BC where Egypt is room for thousands and

120
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,760
thousands and thousands of years like 
the natural,

121
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,800
which means the gods themselves,
which actually means I take to mean 

122
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,840
enlightened or divinely enlightened 
human beings.

123
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,230
And then another long,
long period where Egypt is ruled by the 

124
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,011
ship so far,
which means the companions or the 

125
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:45,460
followers of forest and the retinal that
the names of these kings are given and 

126
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,010
the dates of these kings are given them 
dope boats.

127
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,050
The stone is damaged on the powers and 
somewhat fragmentary.

128
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,800
If you compute the years,
you end up with something like 36,000

129
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,690
BC,
which in fact is not.

130
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,230
There's not a casually chosen date 
because the Sphinx itself,

131
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,260
as you know,
the going to actually as we go along 

132
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:10,940
somewhere along the line to talk about 
this,

133
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,980
because I can send you all kinds of 
interesting texts,

134
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,040
illustrations where maybe you can on 
your end,

135
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:24,550
I'm intersperse them into collate them 
into the actual video broadcast,

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I guess you'd call it so that viewers 
can see what we're talking about as 

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,790
we're talking about it.
Anyway,

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,520
if you can do that.
Greg bootcamp.

139
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,060
Yeah,
no,

140
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,390
we can.
We can definitely do that,

141
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:40,391
but for the audio only people.
This is a fascinating conversation 

142
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:43,550
either way with or without pictures.
How did you get on this path?

143
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,450
How did you.

144
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,130
It just.
I'll tell you in two seconds,

145
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:51,131
but first,
let me just say the reason why the city 

146
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:54,281
$6,000
date is not as outrageous as it might 

147
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:57,791
sound is a because the Egyptians 
themselves are talking about that sort 

148
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,841
of date and also because the strengths 
with this lion's body and human head 

149
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,330
screams out as an astronomical 
astrological marker and the it's meant 

150
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:12,911
to commemorate the age of Leo.
The last age of Leo is where the links 

151
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:18,941
in the relationship is that the Sphinx 
is cited so that it looks duties and so 

152
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:24,581
the last time the Sphinx looked at its 
own image in the sky before the sun 

153
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,140
rose.
That's other.

154
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,820
Talk about the processional ages.
If you want to get into that,

155
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:32,840
we can.
It's not complex astronomy,

156
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:34,070
but it's astronomy.
Anyway.

157
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,390
The last time the strengths looked at 
its own image in the sky,

158
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:42,500
but at sunrise on the spring,
Equinox would have been about 10,000,

159
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,030
10,500
BC.

160
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,790
There are good reasons why 10,500
BC is not satisfactory and the the the 

161
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:57,311
age before that,
the age of Leo before that is another 

162
00:08:57,311 --> 00:08:57,990
26,000
deals earlier.

163
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:03,420
It's the cycles,
so called procession of the economic 

164
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,890
cycle takes 20 roughly 20,
26,000

165
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:06,780
years,
so 36,000

166
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:11,781
years would have been another time when 
this links looked at its at its own 

167
00:09:11,781 --> 00:09:15,690
image in the sky.
I brought up the spring equinox,

168
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,570
so there are reasons.
I mean,

169
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:19,230
as I said,
it's,

170
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,680
it's not just fantasizing,
it's backed up,

171
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:27,710
it's conjectural.
Of course we can improve it as at the 

172
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,291
moment,
but there are good reasons why it could 

173
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:30,291
be as old as that

174
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,560
conventional wisdom is that human 
civilization and the,

175
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,210
you know,
in the form of cities and such that,

176
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,560
that didn't exist before 10,000
years ago.

177
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:38,830
Right.

178
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,890
Well,
it was conventional wisdom until very 

179
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,230
recently.
It's one of the battles that we've had.

180
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,850
We've had to fight.
But you see long story,

181
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,320
Shaka and I are writing a book.
I'll tell you more about this as we go 

182
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,310
along,
telling the story of this whole strength

183
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,860
thing because we presented.
This is a geological argument.

184
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,690
Um,
it's about the water,

185
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:07,691
weathering to the sprinkle the 
weathering to the sex with shock as a 

186
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:08,060
geologist in the specialist in these 
things.

187
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,480
It took a lot,
a lot to get him on board.

188
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:12,680
Mind you,
this is a long.

189
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,520
It's a big,
long,

190
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:18,521
funny story.
I won't get into necessarily right now 

191
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:18,980
here though,
since we have an open ended,

192
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:25,090
we have an open end show and I have 
plenty of block in the freezer and we 

193
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,750
might go on for quite awhile.
But anyway,

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,320
the,
the,

195
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,540
the,
the,

196
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,210
the point is that it's a geological 
argument.

197
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:43,210
And when I got shocked on board,
he took him awhile before he 

198
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,960
acknowledged that it had to be correct.
I mean,

199
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,750
he was putting scene for me to be a 
heretic is easy.

200
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:52,751
I don't give a damn.
I mean I don't like these people and I 

201
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:53,270
don't respect their intelligence or 
their integrity.

202
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,340
So,
and I have nothing to lose,

203
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,540
you know,
shock as a tenured associate professor 

204
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,970
of geology at Boston University.
So he has,

205
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
he puts his neck on the line.
That means something eventually took a 

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,000
bit of dual.
Anybody he did it.

207
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,790
And then we presented this evidence 
first at the,

208
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,500
at the,
you might call it the super bowl 

209
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,500
geology.
It's called the,

210
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,570
um,
the,

211
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,660
the,
the annual meeting of the Geological 

212
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,400
Society of America.
This was in 1991.

213
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,320
We were the stars of the show.
I mean,

214
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:29,321
they recognize the deal,
logical society recognize that this was 

215
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,560
a dynamite presentation.

216
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,560
And so all the precedents,
they have the science for us at the 

217
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:35,560
girls and so on.
And it was that,

218
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:41,260
that actually allowed us to get this 
thing passed secretary is it NBC and 

219
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,190
then put it out in prime time with 
sweeps week and the 1 million man it was

220
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,560
nominated for best documentary of that 
year,

221
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,450
etc.
Etc.

222
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,090
Etc.
So it was that,

223
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,100
that brought it to the florist,
the crack academics to pay attention to 

224
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,380
it.
And I'm,

225
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,410
thE battle has been going on ever since.
And actually funny story because I can 

226
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:05,980
say it here,
but normally I can't.

227
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:06,960
Then I'm on a,
on a,

228
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,260
on a normal reSpectable deliveries yet 
I've watched a couple of years shows I 

229
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,790
know I can get away with it here.
And we,

230
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,330
when we gave this presentation initially
in 1991,

231
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,190
the,
the geologists were unanimously in favor

232
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:28,910
of it.
They came to our presentation,

233
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,720
they walked to our display and they 
said,

234
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:32,500
yeah,
you know,

235
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:37,501
I mean,
how could anybody have the most as well 

236
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:37,690
as another bit of the story,
but so.

237
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,790
But the egyptologist and the 
archaeologist absolutely incensed by the

238
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:47,791
whole thing.
And they were calling us all kinds of 

239
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,461
names and there was one woman who will 
go nameless here,

240
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:53,750
but so coming up in a book somewhere.
So who is a,

241
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,670
an,
an egyptologist at boston university was

242
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,270
shocked potentials and oh yeah,
I'm earlier.

243
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:03,460
So we were being interviewed chunk and 
myself.

244
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,790
I'm black,
the world press really.

245
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:10,791
And so this is 1991 and at one point we 
were being interviewed by the guy who 

246
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:18,370
was the science editor of the boston 
globe and shock teachers in boston.

247
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:21,850
So it means a hometown boy.
And so shop gave his,

248
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,430
his interview and chalk is that we're 
good.

249
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,250
We're a good duo.
It's exactly good cop,

250
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,050
bad cop,
but no shockers,

251
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:34,051
always civil and bill.
Always professional and always polite.

252
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,250
Really even when it shouldn't have to 
worry about these things.

253
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,720
I can say whatever.
Write down please.

254
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,200
So I guess name the channel with the 
science editor of.

255
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,020
We should explain before we go any 
further,

256
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:52,780
we should explain the argument for 
people that don't understand it.

257
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,840
The,
the water erosion argument.

258
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:57,640
This is what people are trying to 
ignore.

259
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,470
Um,
there's,

260
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,620
there's people that are still arguing 
that somehow or another that could have 

261
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,000
been created by sand and wind and that 
this erosion,

262
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,930
um,
according to most geologists,

263
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:16,050
that's not the case.
Most geologists are stating that it had 

264
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:16,050
to be water correctly.

265
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,510
That's correct.
But now they've,

266
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,580
now they've actually gone off the sand 
and wind thing and now it's supposed to 

267
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,561
be what's called salt crystallization in
which the water water soaks through the 

268
00:14:27,381 --> 00:14:32,381
limestone and creates chemical reactions
with the rock and that weather is off 

269
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,750
and creates the weathering that we say.
This is actually a nonsensical argument 

270
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,050
which we will be addressing very 
shortly.

271
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:42,370
I'll take that

272
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,710
and there's an incredible amount of 
resistance to this idea.

273
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,620
Even though the geological science there
are,

274
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:50,540
they in agreement on this,

275
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,160
almost most

276
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,660
of them.
There were a few who aren't,

277
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:55,420
and I'll get into this too as we go 
along.

278
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,250
It saved the point.
What's at stake here was not,

279
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:03,610
this is not,
this is not just a scholarly quibbled 

280
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,000
because for the strings to be watered,
whether then specifically by rainwater 

281
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,420
means that it has to have been there 
when it was raining needs for you.

282
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:11,660
See,
there's almost no rain there now an inch

283
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,680
or so a year,
the sahara desert formed around 10,000.

284
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:19,200
They sAy before ground was fertIle 
savannah,

285
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:22,160
sort of like modern day kenyon,
maybe even wetter than that.

286
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,190
So for the swings to be weathered by,
by,

287
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,920
by rainwater means means that it has to 
have been there before,

288
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,950
before or during the time that lots and 
lots of rain was swelling.

289
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,280
Now what's at stake there?
When you were saying before the 

290
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,910
civilization,
according to the standard scenario,

291
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,440
civilization begins around 3000,
3,500

292
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,460
bc,
more or less simultaneously in Egypt in 

293
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,790
scenario in China and India,
but all of it is around that day,

294
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,450
but the strengths you see as really as 
the most spectacular sculpture on earth,

295
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,210
it's 240 feet long and 66 feet high and 
it's a magnificent,

296
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:07,270
absolutely breathtaking sculpture even 
in ruins and the temples around it,

297
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,250
which we'll get into somewhere along the
line,

298
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,930
but ideally I'll send you pictures of 
it.

299
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,220
The temples around them are powerful 
stone limestone buildings faced with 

300
00:16:21,751 --> 00:16:25,110
granted,
but what's interesting about them is not

301
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:28,740
the size of the templates themselves by 
egyptian standards metal that big,

302
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,430
but the stones that they're better that 
comprise them weigh somewhere between 50

303
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:40,251
and 150 pounds each and the setup in 
such a way that slotted into places into

304
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,880
place like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.
We can't do that today.

305
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,950
Do you still have the old,
the charlton heston video?

306
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:53,951
It's evident evidently have seen we have
this guy jesse water and lose the 

307
00:16:53,951 --> 00:16:58,521
project manager of when they're building
a cogeneration plant out in long island 

308
00:16:58,521 --> 00:17:01,890
and he's acknowledging he's fascinated 
by this because he says,

309
00:17:01,891 --> 00:17:06,891
yeah,
our biggest cranes are biggest landing 

310
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:07,170
bags.
PAins could lift these rocks,

311
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,010
but we wouldn't know how to rig them so 
that we could get them into place.

312
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:15,360
So this means is that not just at the 
snakes is fabulous.

313
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:17,990
Statute is much,
much older.

314
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:20,880
It was built before this supposed to be 
any civilization at all,

315
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,910
but it means that there's a technology 
in place that we,

316
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:29,950
with our brilliant science,
have produced hydrogen bombs and labile 

317
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,610
had donald's and nerve gas in mobile.
These wonderful new developments.

318
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,940
We couldn't build the temples around 
swings,

319
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,450
so that's why they're all so incensed 
that absolutely.

320
00:17:39,451 --> 00:17:43,260
The whole idea is we.
If this is finally acknowledged,

321
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:48,261
that means that everything,
that everything that these people have 

322
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:50,430
believed about ancient,

323
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:56,090
about the onset of human cIvilization is
completely dead wrong.

324
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,690
so that that's why.
That's why there is angry as they are in

325
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,700
the air force sent because a good line 
to the flack is always happiest when 

326
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:08,160
you're right over the target.

327
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:13,420
You know,
one of the things I learned from 

328
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,891
watching your documentary is I really 
thought that scientists and people that 

329
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:18,851
were studying the history of something 
as important as Egypt that they would 

330
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:20,600
be.
We'll just leave that sound on brian.

331
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,590
Hey,
I guess john,

332
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:23,300
you have a fan going on in the 
background.

333
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:24,260
Is that your computer fan?

334
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,100
Yeah.
That's thing

335
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:33,910
anyway,
how you would think that these people 

336
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:33,910
would be scientific in their approach to
evidence.

337
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,410
When you guys presented thIs evidence 
that there was massive amounts of water 

338
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,011
erosion.
The one of the things the guy said that 

339
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:43,760
really disturbed me is like,
you're talking about a civilization from

340
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:44,710
10,500
years.

341
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,460
He was mocking.
He was saying,

342
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:48,140
where's The evidence of thIs 
civilization?

343
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:53,670
Like what at?
What other evidence do you have of this 

344
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:53,670
civilization?
And it's the way he sang.

345
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,110
It is so ridiculous and arrogant and it 
was so.

346
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,140
There was.
It was so soaked in ego because the 

347
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,811
reality is we don't really know how much
evidence there would be left from 10,500

348
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,850
bc.
That is a long,

349
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,880
long,
long time ago and it might very well be 

350
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,331
that the only things that remain are 
things like this face and this function 

351
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:16,331
closure.

352
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:16,350
Well,
there's.

353
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,660
There's a good reason for that to 
actually shaka and I are about to set 

354
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,541
off on on a new book between us called 
dancing down the breeds of syrah and 

355
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:31,391
then the subtitle is a scholar and the 
scientists send gloss the unicorns and 

356
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:36,520
take on the paradigm police because the 
printers that a sufi and it's.

357
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:37,190
You know,
it's so busy.

358
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:41,630
That's the mystical aspect of islam and 
there's a metric.

359
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,640
It's a metaphor and sufi doctrine and in
order to get to the truth,

360
00:19:47,961 --> 00:19:52,961
in order to get to enlightenment on the.
Let's say the seeker must must cross the

361
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:59,651
bridge of sarah,
which is described as narrow as a 

362
00:19:59,651 --> 00:20:02,890
razor's edge.
And on one side is the chasm of cruelty.

363
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,010
And then the other side is the is the 
abyss of skepticism.

364
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,980
So to do this stuff,
you really have to have,

365
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,820
I mean it's very difficult,
it's easy to say you have an open mind,

366
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:16,310
but you'd be surprIsed how few people 
have an open mind.

367
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,600
We got some experience with this 
ourselves and when you say,

368
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:22,370
yeah,
you would expect that from science,

369
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,080
they should be open to evidence,
but in fact are not.

370
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And so what is their issue?
They don't want to admit that they're 

371
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,701
wrong and that everything that had been 
teaching for decades was incorrect and 

372
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:36,820
it's proven so.
So they hold onto the old truth.

373
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,670
Well,
exactly,

374
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:43,671
but I mean in the way I have a little 
bit of sympathy for them even because 

375
00:20:43,921 --> 00:20:48,921
they put in all of these years and you 
get somebody who comes from out 

376
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:53,030
absolutely out of left field me and who 
doesn't come out of left field?

377
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,160
One of them,
they're a phd geologist and highly 

378
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,231
respected and the number of geological 
solid scientific was published to say 

379
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,850
you guys have it all wrong and

380
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,220
well explain to folks what your 
background is and why your,

381
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,220
uh,
such a,

382
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,770
a rebel in this field.

383
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:10,940
Oh,
well,

384
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,210
let me,
I don't want to lose thIs thread because

385
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,120
I have no,
that's okay,

386
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,280
but when I'm on my,
when I do,

387
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,940
when I'm on my trips,
people always ask,

388
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:26,950
we are going through the evidence and 
instead of taking half an hour of the 

389
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,090
way we are now,
we've been ours down.

390
00:21:27,091 --> 00:21:31,280
Liz links studying every aspect of the 
geology and so someone,

391
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,710
and they always say,
well,

392
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:37,100
how they seek leave whitney said that 
has the evidence,

393
00:21:37,101 --> 00:21:39,260
how can they denied?
And that's.

394
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,900
I always were cans and anecdote that 
funny when I was a kid,

395
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:48,470
I read this long before I was even 
interested in this stuff,

396
00:21:48,471 --> 00:21:53,471
but it was a teaching tail supposedly a 
proven that this was the 19 forties.

397
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,190
ReAder's digest an anecdote in there 
that when you actually have the asha 

398
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,130
heifetz,
the great violinist gables,

399
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,720
debbie bill at carnegie hall at the age 
of 11,

400
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,720
I think this must have been for 43,
something like that.

401
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,600
I was a kid.
And um,

402
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:17,030
and at the concert was the then reigning
violin,

403
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:20,630
virtuoso dynamic mischa elman.
You don't hear much of these days,

404
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:25,631
but he was sort of tinkers,
look them up today and with him was our 

405
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,320
to rubinstein,
the great pianist and about halfway 

406
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,670
through the concert element turn to elmo
term to rubinstein and he said,

407
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,750
hot in here isn't it?
And we're going to start and said not 

408
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,430
for pianists.
So,

409
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,160
so,
so with our,

410
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,460
with our science,
the geologists have no problem with it 

411
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,700
or the micro biologist.
So the astrophysicists,

412
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,600
the egyptologist and the archaeologist 
that's hot.

413
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,130
So what,
what can be done?

414
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,770
I mean what you guys are presented this 
evidence,

415
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:05,340
they've tried to ignore it,
but more things pop up that show that we

416
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:07,170
might be wrong about the history of 
humanity.

417
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:09,420
like go back like tappy.
Exactly.

418
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:09,790
Exactly.

419
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:14,790
Exactly.
We now have the smoking guns at our 

420
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,670
disposal.
We have an arsenal of smoking guns and 

421
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,080
you see we have even more of an instant 
was in that video we presented.

422
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:25,081
There's a lot more evidence just from 
Egypt that we presented in another csa 

423
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:26,200
conference in $2,000.
Again,

424
00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:30,790
with the almost unanimous ascent of the 
attending geologists,

425
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,390
but that one unfortunately didn't have 
much press there,

426
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:36,550
so it didn't.
It didn't get a lot of press.

427
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,930
The geologists were impressed but it 
didn't go anywhere,

428
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:45,931
but we now have.
We've had for a while all of the 

429
00:23:45,931 --> 00:23:46,080
evidence at our disposal,
the

430
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,630
template which you mentioned and I don't
know how many of your audience will know

431
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:52,310
about that.
That's serious.

432
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,340
That's the smoking gun because here's 
this incredible site in Turkey and chalk

433
00:23:57,411 --> 00:24:02,411
and I have visited there and spent about
a week there that was discovered in 1994

434
00:24:02,661 --> 00:24:05,090
and I hope we'll get pictures of this up
there,

435
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,960
but it was discovered in 1994.
Absolutely.

436
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:10,820
By accidents.
Looks like a big hill.

437
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,510
I mean it is a big hill and you'd never 
know that there was anything there.

438
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:20,310
And in [inaudible],
94 farmer was plowing the top of the 

439
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,570
hill and he hit what he thought it was.
A boulder and plow hit the boulder and 

440
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:30,770
he ran the plow back over the to try to 
dislodge it and it wouldn't just lodge.

441
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:36,310
And I tried a couple of times and 
nothing happened except they've met 

442
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:40,050
their cloud and so they dug around it 
and they discovered that it wasn't a 

443
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,630
boulder after ella was the top of the 
stone column,

444
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:47,230
so they started digging some more and 
then finally they called them the 

445
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:51,670
archeologists,
which now they're sorry about because 

446
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,930
they commandeered the site and these 
guys 20 years,

447
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:58,931
15 years later fighting the turkish 
government is get some kind of financial

448
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,400
redress from stealing,
stealing their help.

449
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,360
Anyway,
once once they got excavating,

450
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:11,050
they discovered that this was one of the
greatest archeological discoveries 

451
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,980
probably of all time.
I mean from,

452
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,580
from a hisTorical point of view,
it's even more significant and it looks 

453
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,050
like two comments treasure because once 
they stopped,

454
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,140
they dug up the first of these and they 
found they did ground penetrating radar 

455
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,440
or maybe seismograph.
So I'm not sure.

456
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:35,441
But certainly radar.
And this huge hill has at least 22 

457
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:41,900
closely packed stone circles like minnie
stone hinges,

458
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:46,901
but not so many central columns.
There are central columns to central 

459
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:52,121
columns in each of these stone circles 
and then ring the round with other 

460
00:25:52,121 --> 00:25:54,430
funds.
I mean everybody listening to this who's

461
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,390
watching this will have an image of a 
stonehenge and in their heads,

462
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,440
so it's like that except not as not as 
massive,

463
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:07,370
but then further further as they were 
digging,

464
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,880
they realized that this entire hill,
which had been at one point or another,

465
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,600
exposed to the elements of course had 
been deliberately filled in.

466
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,030
what reason?
Nobody knows,

467
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:25,031
I mean is a lot.
This is acres of land and the thing had 

468
00:26:25,031 --> 00:26:28,061
been completely covered and they were 
able to date the film because the film 

469
00:26:28,061 --> 00:26:32,590
has all kinds of organic material in it 
and so the film they dated to $8,000.

470
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:38,091
They see things that they go back to.
The temple itself is incredible site.

471
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,400
Nobody knows what the air for who did it
or anything is at least 10,000

472
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,770
bc and the central columns that I was 
talking about,

473
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,900
our 10 to 15 tons.
They know that the law,

474
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,060
I think we limestone,
but the stones come from a quarry about 

475
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,770
three quarters of a mile downhill,
so they have to drag these up.

476
00:26:57,771 --> 00:26:59,380
Now we're talking about 10,000
bc.

477
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:05,140
Has to be any civilization,
much less tools or anything of that 

478
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,671
sort.
So here are these under 22 of these 

479
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:11,880
stone circles.
Only four have been partially excavated 

480
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,660
and not only on the four.

481
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,270
Out of 22,
pardon?

482
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:20,340
I said only four out of 22 have been 
activated and oldest time archeology is 

483
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,850
an unbelievably.
It's done.

484
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:27,420
It's done meticulously and nowadays it 
tends to bed and not so long ago it's 

485
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,690
just grave robbery,
but now it's really meticulous.

486
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,700
They going at this stuff with teaspoons,
so it takes them years and years and 

487
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,750
years to do it.
Then I guess there isn't a gigantic 

488
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:39,750
amount of funding available.
I don't know who's funding it.

489
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,790
It's a german team that's doing it with 
a really nice,

490
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,620
really good guy.
Klaus schmIdt,

491
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,320
german archaeologist who was in charge 
there,

492
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:48,790
who's,
you know,

493
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:50,890
he's not into the esoteric side of 
things.

494
00:27:50,891 --> 00:27:53,770
It's shocking irr,
but because he's a solid guy,

495
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,950
he's pretty good and a nice man,
so anyway,

496
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:06,150
the apart from the size of these stones 
and the finesse that they had that then 

497
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,930
it goes into creating them.
They're also elaborately decorated and 

498
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:13,930
they're high relief.

499
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,490
What's called high relief.
In other words,

500
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,760
let's say you want to do what you want 
to carve in a wild boar or bird or in 

501
00:28:20,831 --> 00:28:25,831
one case a lion or some sort of a line.
You cut the back.

502
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:32,320
We cut the stone away so that the image 
springs out of the stone.

503
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:37,590
This is 10 times more work than carving 
something into the stone and this is all

504
00:28:38,141 --> 00:28:40,330
we got.
Any tunes as far as anyone knows.

505
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:45,331
Certainly any metal tools.
I'm with flint somehow or another and 

506
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:49,111
you got acres of these things and they.
The archeologists do not dispute the 

507
00:28:50,801 --> 00:28:52,960
dating of 10,000
bc earlier.

508
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,260
So that's our smoking gun.
I mean we've been looking at this for a 

509
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,870
long time and all kinds of evidence and 
some of the.

510
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,390
A lot of the evidence is really 
commanding,

511
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,970
but it's not spectacular looking now.
It's spectacular.

512
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:15,060
Sorry,
what I found amazing about it was that 

513
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,080
they were trying to attribute these 
constructions to hunter and gatherers.

514
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,060
Well,
mayBe they are hunters and gatherErs.

515
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,330
I mean,
you have to be a fool if there's plenty 

516
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,450
of animals and stuff around there.
Plenty of things around to eat.

517
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,310
Why should you go to the backbreaking 
job of farming is legible.

518
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:36,000
Actually,
I have in my first non fiction book,

519
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:38,220
I don't know if you know this,
I started out as a novelist,

520
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,140
playwright,
screenwriter,

521
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:45,230
and I had a lot of things done that will
make me money was probably a good thing 

522
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,700
for egyptology black.
Um,

523
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,460
there's a,
you know,

524
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,470
if you ever heard of him,
but in the first book was called the 

525
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:54,470
case for astrology,
which is out of print now,

526
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:59,071
but let's put together all of the 
scientific evidence that says it's 

527
00:29:59,071 --> 00:30:01,060
actually something behind it.
It's not just what's a good day to buy a

528
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:03,760
poodle.
So the,

529
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,350
in this,
in that book,

530
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:11,630
that's my first nonfiction book,
but I quote a is a wonderful 

531
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:17,080
ethnologists conrad lawrence who was 
brought up in South Africa.

532
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:22,420
You wrote a wonderful book.
Bush probably still around bushman are 

533
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:27,010
about his own experience and he relates 
how the bushman of South Africa,

534
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:32,420
the missionaries are trying to teach 
them how to farm and the machine looks 

535
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:33,330
at him and he says,
well,

536
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,950
why should we farm when there were so 
many mongo,

537
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:38,530
mongo nuts in the world?
Whatever that is,

538
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:43,710
why would anybody in their right mind 
boggling the plow the land and cut 

539
00:30:43,811 --> 00:30:46,560
everything down when they go outside?
I feel hurt,

540
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,810
efficient,
untitled.

541
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So just because they were hunter 
gatherers doesn't mean they hadn't 

542
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,421
figured out amazing constructions.
The ability to make these huge cities 

543
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:56,421
and these just

544
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,520
that.
And in this last couple of decades,

545
00:31:01,521 --> 00:31:03,260
I mean,
I've been on this quest for what?

546
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,920
All to swallowed the little bit in the 
late sixties.

547
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:11,810
So that's when I said something like 
that close to it.

548
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,760
And,
and,

549
00:31:13,761 --> 00:31:18,761
but in the last 10 or 12,
a whole lot of really interesting work 

550
00:31:18,891 --> 00:31:22,720
has come to the fore proving that not 
only that,

551
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,840
these in these so called primitive 
societies that maybe we're not 

552
00:31:28,341 --> 00:31:31,730
intellectually sophisticated.
They nevertheless had,

553
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,530
they had a precise cosmological science 
and actually some,

554
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,530
uh,
some of them like pals involved in this,

555
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,300
you may know some of them,
but you may not know.

556
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:44,140
Some of them,
they might be interesting guests for you

557
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:47,540
in an upcoming shows.
If people know people will really,

558
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,490
really get tuned into this sort of 
thing.

559
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,880
So it's becoming quite cleAr that,
that the knowledge was all there.

560
00:31:55,341 --> 00:31:56,420
I mean the knowledge is there.

561
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,330
The groundbreaking book,
was he making them about it?

562
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,750
What it's called hamlet's mill.
Do you know that?

563
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,020
Discuss that one.
I've heard you discuss it.

564
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:06,990
You're right,
it's,

565
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
it's georgiadis.
I mean these are two impeccable 

566
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,200
historians of science at mit,
Georgia,

567
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:18,580
this santiana and carrots up on deck 
hand and in the book as I think 

568
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,630
published in 68.
But again,

569
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,270
this is the thing you have to go through
when you're,

570
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,070
when you're dealing with these heretical
things.

571
00:32:25,071 --> 00:32:27,350
I mean these guys with all the right 
credentials,

572
00:32:27,351 --> 00:32:32,330
not like may not come from out of left 
field and they manage the stonewall them

573
00:32:32,331 --> 00:32:37,331
and try to and try to ignore their 
evidence that underlying the world's 

574
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:45,161
mythology,
all of these strange stories that we 

575
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:47,411
know incestuous gods and all of this 
kind of thing was astronomy and 

576
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:53,170
astronomy presupposes the santiana and 
can go into that much because they were 

577
00:32:55,191 --> 00:33:00,191
in enough water as it was,
but there is absolutely no point to a 

578
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:04,040
sophisticated astronomy unless there's 
an astrology behind it.

579
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,280
At least in the old days.
Nowadays they're busy looking for 

580
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:09,560
quasars and black holes and all that 
sort of thing,

581
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,760
which have no meaning at least let's 
say,

582
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:16,220
at least in the emotional and 
philosophical sense,

583
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:20,060
but in the old days,
whole civilizations,

584
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:25,061
Egypt included,
were attuned to the emotions of the 

585
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:25,760
stars.
In other words,

586
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,430
there's a lot of literature on this,

587
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,160
this.
Why do you think that this culture that 

588
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,481
we live in right now is so reluctant to 
accept anything like astrology?

589
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,390
Why do you think they would like to 
dismiss it so quickly?

590
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,730
Well,
because,

591
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,520
because,
because this is a materialistic,

592
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:49,530
this is a materialist culture that 
denies anything that has any meaning,

593
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,450
I mean material materialism,
which is the reigning philosophy.

594
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:59,451
This is what everybody learns in school 
certainly get nothing esoteric and 

595
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:03,120
school,
nothing mystical and unfortunately the,

596
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,110
the,
the skeptic,

597
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:10,770
the skeptic's of basically rationalism,
materialism.

598
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,980
Atheism basically is,
it's,

599
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:21,820
it's,
it's basically the religion of the 

600
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,680
emotional,
defective and spiritually dyslexic,

601
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:28,100
and then contemporary,
materialistic science value does not 

602
00:34:29,821 --> 00:34:30,720
exist.
In other words,

603
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:35,740
it's value is by definition subjective,
so these people are ermine because they 

604
00:34:38,371 --> 00:34:42,300
can't find the meaning in their own 
lives and the wrong existence to,

605
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,840
to foist that emptiness that neil ism 
upon everyone else,

606
00:34:48,151 --> 00:34:53,151
but they call it rationalism or reason.
It's nothing of the sort because it is 

607
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:54,570
nothing but nothing.

608
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:00,160
It just seems to reason that our bodies 
are affected by the moons and the tides 

609
00:35:00,371 --> 00:35:02,150
and women's periods are.
And you know,

610
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,710
people behave differently during 
different moon cycles.

611
00:35:05,711 --> 00:35:08,530
The oceans there are affected by the 
tides.

612
00:35:08,531 --> 00:35:13,531
I mean,
that's affected by the fact that the 

613
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:15,331
moon can affect the oceans and we're 
mostly water when we just assume that 

614
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:17,720
planets are having some sort of an 
effect on tubal.

615
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,440
That'S right.
Where did it all come from?

616
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,260
where did astrology originate from?
Like what is the,

617
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,810
what is the bottom,
what is at the end of it?

618
00:35:25,811 --> 00:35:26,590
Like,
who invented it?

619
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:32,340
We know what we can say is that if,
if going back into the paleolithic now 

620
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:41,610
we're,
when we think actually those figures 

621
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,170
shock and I think that the figures in 
the paleolithic in the beckley tapio 

622
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,080
probably cosmological and astronomical 
and can prove it yet.

623
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,530
However,
the santiago that can do a very good job

624
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,920
of showing that that's um,
that astronomy under underpins the most 

625
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:04,080
ancient mythologies that we have.
And since these guys,

626
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:09,770
since the ancients I'm not just 
interested in quasars and pulse and all 

627
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,950
of these sorts of things.
It presupposes and astrology and in fact

628
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:18,951
in Egypt and Egypt was once one society 
that I know the most aBout it,

629
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:23,550
but the same I'm sure applies to ancient
China and India and mayans and so on,

630
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:29,120
that the entire society is orchestrated 
in sUch a way that,

631
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:36,720
that it is tuned to these cosmic cycles 
and we still have,

632
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:42,020
you know,
there's a reason why christmas is the 

633
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,900
day that it is and there's a reason why 
easter is the day that it is supposed 

634
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,781
to,
to commemorate historically in certain 

635
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:50,000
certain elements in the,
you know,

636
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,020
in the life of jesus christ.

637
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,890
But actually that's,
it's much older than that and,

638
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:01,610
and the,
the ancient societies knew what they 

639
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,940
were doing and when you get deep into 
Egypt,

640
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,360
you see that there.
That life itself was a kind of a 

641
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,771
magical.
It's like a magical recreation of the 

642
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:18,591
genesis of the universe in which by 
celebrating it in certain ways and 

643
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,400
certain kinds Of ceremonies and so on,
human beings are reliving the cosmic 

644
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:30,651
process and thereby accessing the 
divinity that is responsible for us 

645
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:33,090
being here,
whIch is not supposed to,

646
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,740
which is not creationism.
Music.

647
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,430
Anytime you tried to say to a rational 
of scientists that,

648
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:39,870
hey,
there really is a meaningful life.

649
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:43,650
There's all your creation was you think 
the world was greater than seven days?

650
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:48,651
No,
that's the name that you know god with 

651
00:37:48,651 --> 00:37:48,750
big white beard was up there and this 
guy's angle today.

652
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:52,140
I think it'll create mosquitoes and 
there's nothing to do with that.

653
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:57,590
If it'S a much more profound philosophy,
but if it is not amendable to study by a

654
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:07,821
materialist science,
but who sat and materialist science is 

655
00:38:07,821 --> 00:38:10,200
the be all and end all and the answer to
everything.

656
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,350
Only the material is to say that,
but they've got everybody,

657
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:17,130
including the people who when we put the
educational system together,

658
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:21,240
conned into believing that their science
is the only signs.

659
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:26,650
The engines new,
new much better and they did much 

660
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,210
better.
I mean all you have to do is go to Egypt

661
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,480
to experience these unbelievable temples
in this fabulous art to understand that 

662
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,620
something is going on that isn't going 
on now.

663
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,190
This is one of the,
I mean it's a big subject.

664
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,770
We won't even get into it in an open 
ended,

665
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,300
in an open ended talk like this black 
chalk and I will be talking about in the

666
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:53,341
booklet where we're planning this,
dancing down the bridge of sarah and um,

667
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:58,890
and in the video,
the big followup to the mystery of the 

668
00:38:58,890 --> 00:38:59,320
strengths that we're hoping to put 
together,

669
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,320
funding for,
which we hope to go as a theatrical 

670
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,350
release,
not just on television.

671
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Some get sales first and then onto the 
videos and theaters and tb and all that 

672
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:13,870
sort of stuff.

673
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:19,510
You have to have lIke an animated dog or
something to go with you to Egypt if you

674
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:23,020
want to get it into theaters to get 
people to really get a interested in the

675
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:25,450
history of the banks and all that stuff,
that's going to be difficult to get into

676
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:26,970
theater.
No,

677
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:29,560
it's silly people we have in this world.

678
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,330
See,
I mean we had our show that mr.

679
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,680
banks was a huge success.
Unfortunately my ex partner now 

680
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,731
deceased,
stole a whole lot to 150 grand from the 

681
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:44,190
till so he never made any money out of 
it,

682
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,010
but he was an interesting guy and 
without going without him,

683
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:53,770
that never would have happened because 
he had the energy in the eye.

684
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,900
I can sink but I don't.
I'm not a manifestor and he got the 

685
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,640
whole thing going so I don't know

686
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,420
if you had a penguin,
a penguin,

687
00:40:03,421 --> 00:40:06,630
the travels to Egypt and you get morgan 
freeman to narrate it.

688
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:12,270
No jail.
we don't need it actually is that video 

689
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:15,860
had was on sweeps week and had it had a 
huge audience over the course of its 

690
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:20,571
lifetime.
It still gets you on every once and it 

691
00:40:20,571 --> 00:40:20,571
was amazing.
It was probably seen by.

692
00:40:20,571 --> 00:40:25,310
I tried to figure it out one day.
It was probably seen by at least 250 

693
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:30,770
million people over over the number of 
years that it was being shown 

694
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,160
internationally and so on.
People Are really interested in this 

695
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,671
stuff and still express it.
We don't need any penguins which is 

696
00:40:37,671 --> 00:40:38,550
paid.
In this case.

697
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:43,910
We just need the science because I'm the
see the material is is glamorous in its 

698
00:40:44,551 --> 00:40:47,100
own right now we have all of this other 
stuff.

699
00:40:47,101 --> 00:40:48,840
It's not just the Egypt.
We have Turkey.

700
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,940
There are these.
I don't know if you've seen this,

701
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:55,200
the truck shop very fascinated like 
easter island,

702
00:40:55,201 --> 00:40:57,060
which may be connected with these 
things.

703
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,520
You know the more I have easter island,
right?

704
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:05,720
Did you know that up until quite 
recently it looks like they're just kind

705
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:09,600
of these big figures that are their 
heads basically heads into ourselves,

706
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:10,900
right?
we're alone.

707
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:16,460
I can't imagine them.
I took them onto just 200 years to 

708
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,480
figure it out.
They started excavating these things and

709
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:21,660
they're finding that their full full 
length statute.

710
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:26,690
So in other words,
they have built up around them maybe 25 

711
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:29,190
feet,
30 feet of silt,

712
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:34,430
and now the question is,
and this should be relatively easy to 

713
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:34,430
determine,
this

714
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:39,070
is part of our big project and will when
you except that the in the dome and 

715
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,070
civilization.
The followup,

716
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:44,100
the mystery of the strengths,
because it should be possible to carbon 

717
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,921
date the lower layers of the sill and 
our conviction is that these things may 

718
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,700
take back again,
thousands and thousands and thousands.

719
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,880
Have they done this?
I mean,

720
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,420
I've seen the excavations

721
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,210
not well.
They're excavating,

722
00:41:58,211 --> 00:42:03,211
but we don't have any carbon dating.
Suck as a bloody.

723
00:42:03,281 --> 00:42:07,630
It's julian who is the ambassador 
somewhere or another.

724
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:10,310
Anyway,
he's connected to easter island.

725
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,870
You should be able to find out in 
Florida and then not only as you see,

726
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:16,480
we've got to hold this stuff now.
It's really exciting.

727
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:17,720
The,
um,

728
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:23,250
not only go back leads happy,
but have you heard about the bracelet 

729
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,630
that was found fairly recently in 
Turkey?

730
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,310
No.
Are you on.

731
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,640
I know,
I know graham hancock's been on your 

732
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,040
show or are you on his mailing list that
he has?

733
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:38,670
I'm sure he sends out.
I mean,

734
00:42:40,551 --> 00:42:45,551
that's his whole job.
That's what he does and sends out this 

735
00:42:45,551 --> 00:42:48,630
enormously comprehensive list of 
everything that's interesting happening 

736
00:42:49,841 --> 00:42:54,841
in science that either directly or 
tangentially affects this whole lost 

737
00:42:55,661 --> 00:42:58,270
civilization hypothesis anyway.

738
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,450
Are you familiar with the oBject that 
they found?

739
00:43:00,451 --> 00:43:05,360
The bottom of the baltic sea recently,
very recently,

740
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:09,140
it looks like a millennium falcon.
It looks like,

741
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,130
you know,
a few took the star wars spaceship,

742
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:15,500
millennium falcon and put it in the 
bottom of the ocean.

743
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,360
That's what it looks like.
They don't know what it is,

744
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,330
but they're sendinG divers down like I 
believe it's this week.

745
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,390
oh yeah,
I heard about that.

746
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,480
Yeah,
and it's somebody that will say when see

747
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,600
will see when they,
when they figure it out because it has 

748
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:30,880
to be seriously careful about that 
stuff.

749
00:43:30,881 --> 00:43:33,250
You know about soccer and myself.
Dive,

750
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:34,910
yes,

751
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:40,230
no,
that we're convinced graeme thinks 

752
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:40,230
otherwise,
but we're shocking myself.

753
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:45,041
Convinced that this is amazing looking 
place is in fact perfectly natural.

754
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:46,550
Wow.
Really explain.

755
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,450
Yeah.
We can explore.

756
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,480
We can pretty well explained how it's 
done and we didn't want to think that 

757
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,080
that would have Been a smoking gun,
but we're.

758
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,580
We're convinced that it's natural.

759
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,710
You saw those two giant.
You Saw those two giant pizza box 

760
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:04,811
looking pieces of rock that were stacked
next to each other side by side and you 

761
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:05,980
that look natural.
Yeah.

762
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,360
It's a hard,
isn't it?

763
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,150
You know,
it's hard to describe,

764
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,990
just know without having the pictures 
there,

765
00:44:14,991 --> 00:44:17,390
but more time and I had the big thing 
with me.

766
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,760
We,
we could show you why we're convinced 

767
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:22,760
that it is indeed completely

768
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,480
natural.
You've seen all the images on graham 

769
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:27,480
hancock site,
I'm assuming.

770
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,100
Did you do any diving yourself?
A yana goes,

771
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:29,780
yeah,
yeah.

772
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,010
We were there for a week and then there 
are a couple

773
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,080
of times and he's,
as I said,

774
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:39,081
it's in our own interest.
This as to see this is the evidence 

775
00:44:39,081 --> 00:44:40,890
we're looking for,
but we don't think it is.

776
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,250
We think graham was making a big mistake
and insisting that it is

777
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:49,710
dr schoch the geologist.
What was his explanation for how it was 

778
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:49,710
created?

779
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:53,380
Well,
you see if you go because the people who

780
00:44:53,381 --> 00:44:56,560
are taking the pictures initially and 
it's they're not trying to fool anyone,

781
00:44:56,561 --> 00:44:59,830
they're just taking the cool,
exciting looking pictures,

782
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:05,130
but if you follow some of those ridges,
it looks so perfectly vertical and so 

783
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:09,001
perfectly horizontal.
You'll see them just kind of tAper into 

784
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:12,430
disappearance living rock face and when 
you get really down in your notes to the

785
00:45:12,581 --> 00:45:14,080
rock,
you see the,

786
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,710
the,
the corners aren't finished.

787
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:20,830
You see that the rocks have been 
wrenched out of their place.

788
00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:22,750
It's place,
it's dangerous diving there.

789
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,830
and I'm not a diver.
I'm very,

790
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:30,960
very strong currents and I mean I have a
master diver glued to me,

791
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,420
so,
um,

792
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:39,150
but,
but when you go down the shore,

793
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:43,910
I'm in shock and I went there on this 
very nice japanese in their finance.

794
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:45,970
The whole thing was really interested in
it.

795
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:51,530
We do it to be wet blankets,
but I'm the last day that we were there 

796
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:58,261
we went,
we went looking around the island and 

797
00:45:58,261 --> 00:46:01,430
looking at other stuff when we went to a
place about a couple of miles from the 

798
00:46:02,381 --> 00:46:07,381
actual yoga goonie site and they're at 
the water's edge and it's a certain kind

799
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:11,560
of shale.
It's a very hard shale formation that is

800
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:16,561
laid down in very regular horizontals.
But that is cross cut by,

801
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,580
um,
fault lines.

802
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:27,120
And it's like if you imagine a gigantic 
stone layer cake that's already cut into

803
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:33,001
pieces,
but they have the pieces haven't been 

804
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:35,070
served.
And so what happens is that by the 

805
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:37,090
action of the winds and the waves,
because the southern formation,

806
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:42,150
similar inflammation was right at the 
water's edge and he could watch the 

807
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,600
waves pounding up against the current 
running.

808
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:47,540
And What would happen is that eventually
the water,

809
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,720
the running water and the waves and 
tides,

810
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:54,930
unos,
typhoons and all the rest sort of work 

811
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:57,570
into the fault lines which are softer 
rock.

812
00:46:58,310 --> 00:47:03,310
And eventually they get it to the point 
that the action of the waves pulls away 

813
00:47:06,461 --> 00:47:09,280
a big chunk of rock.
This is all set down and layers.

814
00:47:09,281 --> 00:47:11,890
So that falls into the water.
And again,

815
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,140
we're talking about thousands and 
thousands of years.

816
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:19,650
Gradually the whole,
the whole pIece of brought disappears 

817
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:23,281
because it's all laid down on these kind
of layer cake layer cake levels.

818
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:29,370
And so we,
we saw this with because we had our own 

819
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:32,230
skins over the course of the.
It was the last thing in the world.

820
00:47:32,231 --> 00:47:37,231
We wanted to be happier.
If you believed that it was an ancient 

821
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:39,120
civilization,
well we had it all planned.

822
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:43,330
I was going to write it up to the 
national geographic or sony or something

823
00:47:43,331 --> 00:47:48,220
like that and scott was going to write 
it up that they for the geological,

824
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,360
the geological journals and all of that 
sort of stuff.

825
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,580
And I'm young and we say,
well,

826
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:57,020
no.
Did you see the stone circle?

827
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:03,600
It's like a.
There's like pillars arranged in a 

828
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:03,600
circle,
but you see that no.

829
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,840
Again,
we're convinced that there's no context 

830
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,590
for anything there and things that I'm 
not.

831
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,980
Things that are manmade have a context.
And as I said,

832
00:48:14,981 --> 00:48:17,390
when we,
when we saw we would sit,

833
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:22,410
we would still be uncertain about it if 
we did not go a couple of miles down and

834
00:48:23,021 --> 00:48:28,021
watched a similar sort of thing being 
formed right in front of our eyes and go

835
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,650
back there.
When we do this,

836
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:32,650
our next,
this next element that makes you want to

837
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:37,651
do one will be one of our,
one of our sites that assuming we can 

838
00:48:37,651 --> 00:48:40,270
get the funding together,
but we will be,

839
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:45,850
um,
will be concentrating upon because it's 

840
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:49,741
an object lesson both in,
in how careful you have to be when 

841
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:50,590
you're looking.

842
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:55,740
No,
I mean we have a stake in this too and 

843
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:00,100
that where we have to give up on this.
I had a moment,

844
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:03,940
a slight pang not much because I really 
liked the core academics,

845
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:09,360
but he had a slight pang of compassion 
for them when somebody comes along and 

846
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,500
destroys their paradigm,
which is us.

847
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,540
So anyway,
so young.

848
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,150
That's the only goonie and um,
but anyway.

849
00:49:19,151 --> 00:49:24,151
oh,
back to back to this incredible 

850
00:49:24,151 --> 00:49:24,640
bracelet.
This was just a couple of months ago.

851
00:49:24,641 --> 00:49:28,960
They found a bracelet somewhere in 
Turkey.

852
00:49:28,961 --> 00:49:31,510
Turkey is turning out to be more and 
more interesting.

853
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:36,540
There are all kinds of great places in 
Turkey and the just around bracelet made

854
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:44,560
of obsidian.
Obsidian is an incredibly hard stone and

855
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:47,260
very difficult to work.
And like dated,

856
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:49,510
I'm not exactly sure how their data 
might be in the,

857
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,920
where it was found the strada where it 
was found.

858
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:57,130
They dated it to around 8,000
bc,

859
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,250
but the,
the,

860
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:02,350
it's a very elegant little,
I mean didn't look like that much.

861
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:07,351
It's just elegant and beautiful.
And the archeologists realized when they

862
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:13,201
studied it that the finish on it was 
something that nowadays you could only 

863
00:50:13,571 --> 00:50:17,200
do with the most sophisticated 
instruments,

864
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:22,230
lasers or something of the sort and 
moreover that it had a very complex and 

865
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:27,320
subtle geometrical shape.
So in other words,

866
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:32,321
you cAn't do a thing like that.
It's very hard to imagine doing some 

867
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:36,550
something of that nature that's really 
rigorously geometrical without having 

868
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:38,540
the geometry at your fingertips.

869
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,300
So you'd have to have some sort of a 
computer,

870
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,860
a machine,
something has to.

871
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,730
You have to have something that you're,
you built to construct this,

872
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:47,840
right?
Is that what you're saying?

873
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:49,330
We don't know.
This is,

874
00:50:49,331 --> 00:50:52,490
this is the contention of chris 
christopher done.

875
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:56,080
They know chris knows he's.
Well he's,

876
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:01,170
he's a high tech guy and he designs 
engineer.

877
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:07,430
He is,
but he's the guy who designs the 

878
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,340
instruments,
really precise instruments that do 

879
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,510
things like make pieces for the space 
shuttle and stuff,

880
00:51:13,511 --> 00:51:18,511
their instruments that are calibrated to
10 thousands of thousands of an inch and

881
00:51:19,211 --> 00:51:23,470
he's done studies in Egypt and finds 
that that's what you'll see all over the

882
00:51:23,471 --> 00:51:26,770
place that there a monstrous pieces of 
granite.

883
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:29,950
let me put this [inaudible].
He's been on a couple of trips with me.

884
00:51:29,951 --> 00:51:34,951
He's a good guy and he,
he has his flying special instRuments 

885
00:51:35,591 --> 00:51:40,591
that you know,
a calibrated to a 10 thousands of an 

886
00:51:40,591 --> 00:51:43,621
inch and the places that some piece of 
granite and old kingdom granite and 

887
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:48,820
granted is 100 percent completely true.
And,

888
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,300
and chris as you know,
is,

889
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:56,390
is fairly adamant that in order to do 
this they had to have had some sort of 

890
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:03,080
technology that would allow them to do 
that shotgun.

891
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:08,820
I'm not so sure because technology is 
technology and mostly they have some 

892
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:14,430
miraculous realm of technology that we 
can't even imagine because you would 

893
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:18,781
have expected,
particularly in a place like Egypt so 

894
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:22,021
much from the past times.
Somewhere along the line you need to 

895
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:25,470
have some evidence of this kind of 
technology and the dump.

896
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,350
You mean by saying technology,
you mean something that cuts the,

897
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:36,360
like a machine,
something that can cut the marble and 

898
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,140
polish it down to be 100 percent flat?
Yes,

899
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,620
exactly.
What is the conventional?

900
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,520
What is the conventional egyptologists?
How do they say they built it?

901
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:48,930
They don't address the question of being
since there is no.

902
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:54,290
Since there is no,
there is no evidence for that 

903
00:52:54,841 --> 00:52:59,841
technology.
They just assume that they did it by 

904
00:52:59,841 --> 00:53:00,060
hand somehow or another,
and maybe they did,

905
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:05,300
but when you realize the level of 
perfection of these things and how 

906
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,210
impossible it would be today to do them 
by hand.

907
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:10,990
Um,
I mean they're just say,

908
00:53:10,991 --> 00:53:12,960
oh,
well in those days everybody had lots of

909
00:53:12,961 --> 00:53:17,961
time and time was no,
it was not of any concern that it could 

910
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:18,240
work on it until I got it right.
Well,

911
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:23,600
that's the sort of a fudge hands.
You can't legitimately postulates and 

912
00:53:25,731 --> 00:53:28,250
advanced technology when you don't have 
any evidence for it.

913
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,920
Right.
There was another issue with the vases,

914
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:35,980
correct?
The stone vases that were made that we 

915
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:35,980
can't duplicate today.

916
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,000
Oh,
well,

917
00:53:37,001 --> 00:53:38,680
maybe we could,
but we'd have to go.

918
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:44,010
We got to use a lot of very special 
machinery to do it and since there's no 

919
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:44,980
evidence that he had this kind of 
machinery,

920
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,820
these rounds,
no clauses that are,

921
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:54,600
you know,
the shape like this and they have a 

922
00:53:54,641 --> 00:53:58,380
narrow neck and the hollow on the inside
and,

923
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,270
and they're perfect.
I mean they can know,

924
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:06,271
they can tap into the inside and see 
that the inside is hollowed out 

925
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:10,650
perfectly and we can't,
we don't know how they could possibly 

926
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:13,771
have had what kind of a drill or 
anything they could have had to do this 

927
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:16,630
in a very hard stone.
Vases and they date from a very early

928
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:21,690
Egypt,
not I'm not a later period.

929
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,720
They lost the ability.
This is one of the strains and some of 

930
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,490
the most spectacular stuff comes from 
the earliest periods contract right now.

931
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:33,360
There's a terrific,
there's a terrific show.

932
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,870
And the,
uh,

933
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:40,110
the metropolitan museum of art,
I think the dawn of the egyptian art and

934
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:44,290
it's all the preterm nastic work force 
housing five,

935
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:46,110
three,
four or 5,000

936
00:54:46,111 --> 00:54:48,330
bc and they're collected.
It's not,

937
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:51,600
it's not because they do a 
retrospective,

938
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:56,601
they get,
gets from here and bits in there and so 

939
00:54:56,601 --> 00:54:59,271
on.
So they put together this really 

940
00:54:59,271 --> 00:55:01,070
fabulous shoW because normally you don't
see much treated nastic art together in 

941
00:55:01,201 --> 00:55:06,201
one place.
And when you look carefully and you see 

942
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:06,201
what's going on and you know,
what you,

943
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:06,900
you,
what you're looking at,

944
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,950
I mean if it was somebody who not spent 
30 years studying Egypt,

945
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,840
you don't look really impressive.
That'S in pieces.

946
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:22,251
They're mostly quIte small.
But if you have an eye for this and 

947
00:55:22,251 --> 00:55:23,370
you've done a lot of study and ask a lot
of questions,

948
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,740
you see how spectacularly beautiful 
these things are.

949
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:31,680
Zoned shows on till august.
So anybody in the neighborhood make sure

950
00:55:31,681 --> 00:55:33,440
you get to the mat.
How does it happen?

951
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:34,740
an awful lot of press,
but it's,

952
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,030
it's a terrific show.

953
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:41,820
So you guys want to put a date of the 
civilization of Egypt to somewhere 

954
00:55:41,951 --> 00:55:43,630
around $30,000
pc.

955
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:44,890
That's your idea,
right?

956
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,090
Yeah.

957
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,610
Probably.
It could even be earlier.

958
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:52,611
We don't actually,
we're me backtrack a little bit.

959
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,760
My.
My question is how did one civilization 

960
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,281
like Egypt,
how did that one thing rises up and it 

961
00:56:02,281 --> 00:56:05,530
seems so much more advanced than any 
civilization anywhere,

962
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:10,740
anywhere around it.
Like how did that take place so long 

963
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:10,740
ago?

964
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,950
A little bit different than see this 
physical situation of Egypt is such as 

965
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:19,840
bone guys this nowadays since,

966
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,980
but your,
your,

967
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,620
your theory.
I'm sorry.

968
00:56:23,621 --> 00:56:28,621
Your theory puts it in a time where it 
wasn't though your theory puts the 

969
00:56:28,621 --> 00:56:30,310
creation of Egypt at the time where it 
was lush and rained all the time.

970
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:31,900
It was essentially a rainforest.

971
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,100
Well that takes it way back further,
but then we go back,

972
00:56:35,101 --> 00:56:37,020
we accept that and now we're talking 
10,000

973
00:56:37,021 --> 00:56:39,450
bc and who's to say what they haven't 
discovered yet?

974
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:44,570
What was the climate?
And I find so and the other 

975
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:47,100
civilizations you see he has this 
physically,

976
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,810
physically unique situation where things
don't.

977
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,370
Whether away.
I mean,

978
00:56:53,371 --> 00:56:57,930
once they get covered up with sand just 
there and plus the fact that,

979
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,310
you know,
in the old days this was a,

980
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:04,780
this was a kind of blessing civilization
in which we hardly have to do any work 

981
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:08,931
to get fed either the nile would flood 
and we planted some seeds and I grew up 

982
00:57:08,931 --> 00:57:11,340
when the windows,
when the flood season game again,

983
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,180
we had a fairly populous,
um,

984
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,720
that was a substantial population there 
with nothing to do.

985
00:57:18,721 --> 00:57:23,721
No television,
no american idol and nothing to do all 

986
00:57:23,721 --> 00:57:23,721
day long,
all night long.

987
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:24,930
And so they,
they,

988
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:25,990
they,
you know,

989
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:28,290
they,
the whole,

990
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:33,560
the entire society was put to work 
building these fabulous,

991
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:37,530
fabulous temples and monuments and doing
the artwork and so on.

992
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:41,670
So the other places,
I mean I'm pretty well convinced because

993
00:57:41,671 --> 00:57:46,080
the doctrine in all of this work in the 
last decade or so,

994
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,570
proving that the cosmology,
in other words,

995
00:57:48,571 --> 00:57:53,571
the sophisticated understanding of life 
and significant significance of live in 

996
00:57:54,481 --> 00:57:58,500
the geometry,
astronomy and so on was all,

997
00:57:58,501 --> 00:58:03,501
they're universally India and China and 
the other places just didn't have the 

998
00:58:03,501 --> 00:58:03,570
physical

999
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:10,420
capacity to build on that scale or maybe
they just play to do it anyway.

1000
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:17,480
They had other ways of manifesting this 
kind of,

1001
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:22,970
let's say this kind of understanding.
And this is another thing that just not 

1002
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,380
even taking into consideration by the 
academics.

1003
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:29,250
You don't need sacred architects,
you know,

1004
00:58:29,251 --> 00:58:32,370
magnificent sacred architecture to 
express

1005
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:38,990
spirituality.
We could have a society and they 

1006
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:41,880
probably are some express their,
let's say their,

1007
00:58:41,881 --> 00:58:43,590
their,
their spiritual longings.

1008
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:48,940
It's only in danced and at the end you 
would have known even the society,

1009
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:56,310
for example,
there are sacred dances in the gurdjieff

1010
00:58:56,311 --> 00:59:01,311
work that I do.
They have what are called the movements 

1011
00:59:01,311 --> 00:59:01,470
and boy,
you're getting into these things.

1012
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:06,450
I mean they're pretty amazing and yet we
do them today,

1013
00:59:06,451 --> 00:59:11,451
but because he,
they sacred dance exists in lots of 

1014
00:59:11,641 --> 00:59:16,641
different societies,
but you don't need to build temples in 

1015
00:59:16,641 --> 00:59:18,210
order to express it.
The egyptians done it that way.

1016
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:23,060
I'm the chinese and the indians did too,
but not that early and there was no,

1017
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:23,660
it's less than that.

1018
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:29,090
what,
how did the civilization just spring up 

1019
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:30,710
like this though?
Created such incredible works of art and

1020
00:59:30,711 --> 00:59:32,000
incredible work.
You know the,

1021
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:35,330
the architectural designs of these,
these buildings,

1022
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:36,720
we don't.
No,

1023
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,810
we don't know.
But when you see that,

1024
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:45,030
see that's one of the eye openers of 
this very interesting don and 

1025
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:50,750
civilization exhibit at the met because 
you don't have temples and you don't 

1026
00:59:52,831 --> 00:59:57,831
have to have big buildings,
but you have very many instances of very

1027
00:59:58,621 --> 01:00:03,240
sophisticated sculptured done.
Very hard stones.

1028
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:06,450
I mean beautifully finished.
So they had it.

1029
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:11,510
They could do it and as I said earlier,
we've got build beckley company that is 

1030
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:15,080
not an argument for that.
Go back to the topic of easter island.

1031
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:19,020
Turn out to be ancient.
Well then they are.

1032
01:00:19,021 --> 01:00:19,650
I mean,
if it's,

1033
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:21,360
if,
if you can date,

1034
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,440
it's sort of amazing,
they haven't done it or maybe they have 

1035
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:27,440
an,
I don't know about it,

1036
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,610
but if you can,
you can show them that the earliest 

1037
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:37,610
levels of filled that had buried them up
to their chests goes back to let's say 

1038
01:00:38,281 --> 01:00:43,281
go back.
We have templates on rather than we've 

1039
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:45,351
got another instance of spectacular 
artwork at the time when there's not 

1040
01:00:46,171 --> 01:00:47,550
supposed to do such a thing.
I mean,

1041
01:00:47,551 --> 01:00:50,970
the whole thing is in the process of 
being turned upside down,

1042
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:52,830
ideally by us.

1043
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:59,030
It's an incredibly fascinating subject 
and one that it drives me crazy.

1044
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,280
It's uh,
the,

1045
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:05,450
the,
the timeline is such a fascinating 

1046
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,650
thing.
Like where did civilization emerged from

1047
01:01:06,651 --> 01:01:07,030
the,
when,

1048
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:11,590
how did it get so incredibly 
sophisticated at one point in time,

1049
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:13,690
ancient Egypt and then somehow or 
another,

1050
01:01:13,691 --> 01:01:15,790
all that stuff was lost,
you know,

1051
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:20,791
somehow or another through the burning 
of the library of alexandria and the 

1052
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:21,940
romans and the greeks and everything 
throughout history up until today.

1053
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:27,120
So much informaTion has been lost is,
is there a natural disaster in the 

1054
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,550
middle of there somewhere?
Did something happen to the human race,

1055
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,770
were wiped out a significant number of 
us.

1056
01:01:32,771 --> 01:01:35,140
And then we had to refigure things out.
Is that what happened?

1057
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:40,590
Well,
could be or it stayed there and sort of 

1058
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:43,180
a dormant state until it was time to,
to reinvented.

1059
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:46,450
And acTually it does go for the,
that for example,

1060
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:50,170
you see when you're dealing with the 
academia,

1061
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:51,560
um,
they,

1062
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:56,570
they're very resistant to,
to interpreting their own data in any 

1063
01:01:58,751 --> 01:02:01,270
way that disagrees with their 
preconceptions.

1064
01:02:01,271 --> 01:02:04,930
But you're familiar for sure with the 
paleolithic caves,

1065
01:02:04,931 --> 01:02:06,670
right?
Grants.

1066
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,040
Olesko.
Do you know the one?

1067
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:13,270
I'm the most recent one discovered in 
the early nineties?

1068
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:15,970
Close show today.
Hold on the same area.

1069
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:16,900
You know that one?

1070
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:17,960
No,
I don't know that one.

1071
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,800
C,
h a l v,

1072
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:24,801
e t,
I think I must of what's going on in 

1073
01:02:24,801 --> 01:02:25,170
that one.
And,

1074
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:29,300
and this was discovered.
It's named after the guy who discovered,

1075
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:34,910
and this is up up until now,
the most spectacular,

1076
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:39,540
the most spectacular of the caves was 
the one that lost.

1077
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:42,690
Go with the famoUs all of bowls.
And the other one,

1078
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:47,730
that place called alta mira,
which again is a very high level of 

1079
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:51,340
artwork and both of those,
both of those caves of dated to around 

1080
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,270
17,
18,000

1081
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:59,271
bc and the basis of evidence in the 
caves will show that it has the most 

1082
01:02:59,271 --> 01:03:00,570
spectacular art.
The law.

1083
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:04,220
I mean it's,
it's as though it were designed by drawn

1084
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:08,460
by a whole bunch of paleo,
picasso's coming spectacular stuff.

1085
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:13,461
When you,
when you pull it up online will say it 

1086
01:03:13,461 --> 01:03:14,620
and spell it again please.
C h a,

1087
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,760
v e t or b,
e z.

1088
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,650
I think,
wow,

1089
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,180
this is amazing stuff.

1090
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:29,620
He got it up right now.
You see this day date to 31,000

1091
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:36,741
bc bright,
but they don't see.

1092
01:03:36,781 --> 01:03:41,781
They don't put two and two together.
They can't do higher mathematics and 

1093
01:03:41,781 --> 01:03:45,171
academia because two and two tells you 
that artwork at this level.

1094
01:03:45,211 --> 01:03:47,440
And I mean where are they getting the 
paint from?

1095
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:52,460
What are they doing with their fingers?
Presumably we can't go into the local 

1096
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:56,181
art supply shop and get know,
get acrylic paints the painting that's 

1097
01:03:56,181 --> 01:04:00,590
on the inside of the cage.
It's got to be pitch black and when you 

1098
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:05,151
look at the level of artwork,
you realize that this is not done by 

1099
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:09,390
primitives.
In order to to do art of that,

1100
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:12,600
on that level,
you have to have your act together.

1101
01:04:12,601 --> 01:04:14,740
Even if you're wearing bear skins,
you know,

1102
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:20,160
it really does look like the animals 
they're chasing and it's all done from 

1103
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:20,310
memory.

1104
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:23,160
that's very impressive.
Well,

1105
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:28,490
we were shocked and I think that because
there's been a very good guy minutes for

1106
01:04:30,361 --> 01:04:32,440
it forever,
for a long time.

1107
01:04:32,441 --> 01:04:36,120
He was at a conference that we did named
frank ed to interpret it,

1108
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:41,510
the hall of bulls lasko as an 
astronomical basically as not having an 

1109
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:47,420
astronomical significance of dots and 
dogs on the wall that represented the 

1110
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:52,390
pleiades and other constellations and I 
think he's probably correct and it 

1111
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,330
wouldn't have surprised me to see.
The usual explanation is,

1112
01:04:54,331 --> 01:04:56,610
oh,
well that's magic because of my paint,

1113
01:04:56,611 --> 01:04:58,610
the water,
these animals on the wall,

1114
01:04:58,611 --> 01:05:03,270
they'll be able to hunt them.
I'm not so sure I'm.

1115
01:05:03,310 --> 01:05:08,310
I'm more inclined to think that it may 
be in some in some way or another star 

1116
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:16,791
map or have some sort of cosmological 
significance and it does a book for 

1117
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:23,400
french member of the academy actually 
going to go the sacred geography of 

1118
01:05:24,071 --> 01:05:25,300
ancient Greece?
No,

1119
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:26,890
it's another one.
It's a different moment.

1120
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:31,450
That's one book.
There's another one by amateurs.

1121
01:05:31,451 --> 01:05:33,250
In other words,
not credentialed.

1122
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:36,330
Whatever enough,
if that means anything close.

1123
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:42,790
Plato's secret elliot's in which they 
show that the iliad,

1124
01:05:43,350 --> 01:05:45,520
which is the most boring book ever 
written,

1125
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:50,910
is actually a gigantic,
like a planetarium and all of this so 

1126
01:05:51,371 --> 01:05:52,540
and so's being killed.

1127
01:05:54,230 --> 01:05:55,220
No,
the the,

1128
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:55,630
the

1129
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:59,120
heroes.
Rosa here and the armies of doing all of

1130
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,280
this sort of stuff.
It's a terrible board read,

1131
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:06,670
but if it's decoding as a star map,
like as like a planetarium and the 

1132
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:11,251
action from about 9,000
bc on the whole thing makes all of a 

1133
01:06:12,651 --> 01:06:17,651
sudden made sense.
This is why they go into all of that 

1134
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:20,030
trouble to do all of this work decoded 
as a sky map.

1135
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,730
How?
How do you decode it as a sky map?

1136
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:27,770
He has to read the bucket.
It's complicated because the stars,

1137
01:06:27,771 --> 01:06:32,600
let me see if I remember correctly,
the army's represent constellations,

1138
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:36,290
the heroes of the particular bright 
stars in the,

1139
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:39,620
in the,
in the particular constellation,

1140
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:44,960
and the elliot is all about this army is
going here and that ami is going here 

1141
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,460
and this one is over powering this one 
and if you're decoding astronomically,

1142
01:06:48,730 --> 01:06:52,290
if it's tracking the constellations 
across the sky because the,

1143
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:56,030
the relationships of the stars and the 
constellations to each other,

1144
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:57,590
change over time.

1145
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,040
So as everybody knows,
why should they do that?

1146
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:07,070
I don't know what he said.
The astronomy and this is now even 

1147
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:11,300
getting,
even the academics,

1148
01:07:11,301 --> 01:07:16,301
there's a realizing that that astronomy 
plays a huge role in very ancient 

1149
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,810
civilizations and the only reason as far
as I'm concerned,

1150
01:07:23,811 --> 01:07:28,811
but I can't prove it.
We only reason it has to be not only is 

1151
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:30,980
astrologically significant because 
otherwise we would care.

1152
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,060
I mean,
for example,

1153
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:35,240
hamlet's mill,
um,

1154
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:40,560
something that can go to a lot of 
trouble to show that very ancient myths 

1155
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:44,210
as far back as you go know about the 
procession of the equinoxes.

1156
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:48,140
I was just about to ask you about that.
I said I was just about to ask you about

1157
01:07:48,141 --> 01:07:48,850
that.
That's it.

1158
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:51,260
That's amazing.
Explain that to people.

1159
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:56,800
Okay.
the possession of the equinox is there 

1160
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,701
is because supposedly because of the 
level of the earth with their other 

1161
01:07:58,701 --> 01:08:03,010
other explanations that I liked,
ben made the whole solar system that's 

1162
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:04,880
turning around a binary star.

1163
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:06,830
UM.
Anyway.

1164
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,290
Doesn't matter.
The act is that,

1165
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:14,960
let's say if you look the way that this 
now we're still in the.

1166
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:20,260
Let's say we're in the age of pisces,
which means that if you look at the 

1167
01:08:20,481 --> 01:08:24,620
spring equinox,
if you watched wait for the sun to rise,

1168
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,660
it's rising an hour before the sunrise 
is.

1169
01:08:28,661 --> 01:08:33,661
You'll see the sun coming up and the 
constellation behind the sunrise is the 

1170
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:40,241
very last degrees of pisces.
And pretty soon you can't synthesize.

1171
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:45,760
They pretty soon it will be aquarius.
So the age of aquarius for musical was 

1172
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:52,200
now very gradually.
It's cool.

1173
01:08:52,210 --> 01:08:53,930
The precession,
the,

1174
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:59,290
the entire zodiac precesses against the,
the sun.

1175
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:07,541
So in other words,
it doesn't go and you look at astrology 

1176
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:07,541
areas,
as you know,

1177
01:09:07,541 --> 01:09:08,260
is whatever it is,
April 20th,

1178
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,440
march,
22nd,

1179
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:11,750
and then it goes because aries,
taurus,

1180
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:15,650
gemini cancer and so on.
Precesses means it goes backwards.

1181
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,800
So it's in pisces now and it'll soon be 
in aquarius.

1182
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:24,730
Now that the rate at which that cycle 
takes canonically exactly,

1183
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:28,730
exactly that 25,920
years.

1184
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:34,120
So what this means is that for the sun 
to precess one degree takes 72 years.

1185
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:41,000
Now how do they figure that out and why 
should it be important to you?

1186
01:09:41,001 --> 01:09:46,001
Imagine looking at the sky.
I don'T want people to be looking at 

1187
01:09:46,001 --> 01:09:49,481
this guy for some reason or another and 
realize that the sun takes 72 years to 

1188
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:52,280
go one degree.

1189
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:57,550
There was a book that graham hancock had
discussed once on an interview.

1190
01:09:57,551 --> 01:10:00,240
I wish I could remember the name of it,
but it was discussing this,

1191
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:05,280
this number 72,
and that this knowledge of the 

1192
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,330
procession of the equinoxes has been 
installed in many,

1193
01:10:07,331 --> 01:10:09,430
many ancient cultures and religions.

1194
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:11,870
Exactly.
It has met.

1195
01:10:11,871 --> 01:10:15,410
That gets you into numbers,
symbolism and got gets you into sacred,

1196
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:20,770
so it lets us know that they knew a lot 
more than we thought they knew just 

1197
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:23,280
about the universe itself,
the constellations themselves,

1198
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:25,980
the wobble of the earth's axis,
a 26,000

1199
01:10:25,981 --> 01:10:30,981
year cycle.
They knew about this somehow or another 

1200
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:30,981
10,
15,000

1201
01:10:30,981 --> 01:10:31,490
years ago.
That's really.

1202
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:32,940
That's incredible.

1203
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:38,410
It is.
And you see it's this kind of thing that

1204
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:43,910
is rigorously excluded from any kind of 
academic discussions until it's stuffed 

1205
01:10:45,891 --> 01:10:48,650
down their throats.
This is exactly what we plan to do.

1206
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:49,650
The current,
the,

1207
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:54,750
the conventional egyptologists date,
their construction of the pyramids to 

1208
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,790
2,500
Bc,

1209
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:56,750
right?
Is it correct?

1210
01:10:58,340 --> 01:10:58,760
Yes.

1211
01:10:58,870 --> 01:10:59,420
What?
What's that?

1212
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:00,350
What's that based on?

1213
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:03,740
Well,
it's based on the.

1214
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:09,110
It's based on the reigns of key ops,
kafra of friend and so on.

1215
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:14,580
And this is.
This is very complicated

1216
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:19,580
because we're chunking.
Myself and my colleagues think that in 

1217
01:11:22,231 --> 01:11:27,231
all likelihood,
the pyramids that we see today are doing

1218
01:11:28,231 --> 01:11:30,990
deed date from that period.
However,

1219
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,110
and this is again formally,
easily provable.

1220
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,800
They are built,
they are super imposed or replace 

1221
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:46,530
structures that were there earlier and 
even the academics acknowledged that the

1222
01:11:46,531 --> 01:11:51,531
giza plateau was was a single template 
to some very interesting work coming up 

1223
01:11:52,351 --> 01:11:57,060
soon proving that that's the case,
so whenever the sphinx was built,

1224
01:11:57,510 --> 01:12:00,570
they were also structures that we don't 
know if there are pyramids or not,

1225
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:04,070
but in the paramedics,
particularly the second pyramid,

1226
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,260
the pyramid that's associated with the 
spanx,

1227
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,230
you can see that there are two different
styles,

1228
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:15,600
two radically different styles of 
masonry and the lower the lower courses 

1229
01:12:17,071 --> 01:12:20,460
have built these gigantic blocks.
the size of practically the size of this

1230
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:21,390
room.
I'm not quite,

1231
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:25,470
but anyway,
massive maybe 8,000

1232
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:30,471
ton blocks and then piled on top of them
on the much and very finely finished on 

1233
01:12:31,341 --> 01:12:36,341
a much lesser smaller cruder masonry.

1234
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:40,350
That's rather typical of of the old 
kingdom.

1235
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:43,410
now whenever I'm in architectural 
history,

1236
01:12:43,411 --> 01:12:48,411
no architectural historian would not.
Contextual historian knows instantly 

1237
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:53,991
that when you see two different styles 
of architecture in the same building,

1238
01:12:55,021 --> 01:12:58,080
you know you're looking at two different
periods of building.

1239
01:12:58,081 --> 01:13:01,710
I mean this as a rough example,
suppose you have a victorian house,

1240
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:05,280
but you've got a modern kitchen in it 
100 years from now,

1241
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,760
with 500 years from now,
the archeologists come and discover that

1242
01:13:08,761 --> 01:13:13,761
house.
They will know in two seconds that the 

1243
01:13:13,761 --> 01:13:14,430
houses built in the 19 hundreds or the 
$1,800

1244
01:13:14,431 --> 01:13:18,930
rather than the kitchen is built in 2005
or something of that sort.

1245
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:24,350
So this is a given.
So when you see two different radically 

1246
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:25,190
different styles of architecture,
you know,

1247
01:13:25,191 --> 01:13:27,030
you're dealing with two different 
periods,

1248
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:29,610
um,
two different periods of construction.

1249
01:13:29,611 --> 01:13:31,780
And then there are other factors in 
this.

1250
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:36,790
This so called red pyramid.
I'm about 20 miles away where the whole 

1251
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:42,480
pyramid is built and the interior 
chambers are in perfect condition,

1252
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:47,820
uh,
built over a ruinous legalistic chamber 

1253
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:50,360
that they called a plunder tomb chamber.
But it's not a plum.

1254
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:55,510
The tomb chamber goes the stones in it.
I've been exposed to the weather for a 

1255
01:13:55,510 --> 01:13:55,830
long,
long time.

1256
01:13:56,250 --> 01:14:00,240
It's an earlier megalithic construction.
We don't know what the dating is,

1257
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:05,370
but all of this you see is,
is evidence that we will be using in our

1258
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:08,730
september one if we managed to flip for 
budget together and do it,

1259
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:12,100
and there's a great history of people 
building on top

1260
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,790
of ancient structures that the parthenon
and the acropolis,

1261
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,490
which doesn't get explained that,
you know,

1262
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:22,930
nobody explains where those gigantic 
stones came from and why they,

1263
01:14:22,931 --> 01:14:24,670
you know,
how they got into place.

1264
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:27,160
Massive,
monstrous stones.

1265
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:32,430
And so the other thing that you guys had
shown that I thought was really 

1266
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:35,551
fascinating was that below ground when 
you showed the really ancient 

1267
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:38,680
constructions,
a lot of them were uncovered.

1268
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:41,530
A lot of them had to be dug out.
They were,

1269
01:14:41,531 --> 01:14:45,730
they were actually the ones that were 
under the ground under the sand were the

1270
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,950
ones that showed the earlier 
construction methods,

1271
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:50,560
which is pretty obvious that much like 
the sphinx,

1272
01:14:50,561 --> 01:14:53,980
when they first discovered it had been 
taken over by saying this is.

1273
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:56,320
You're talking about really,
really ancient stuff.

1274
01:14:56,790 --> 01:14:57,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

1275
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:02,980
Well,
this drinks is a bit different because 

1276
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:02,980
it's cut into a hollow in order to 
produce this drinks.

1277
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:06,250
They had to carve clari the stone around
from it,

1278
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:09,730
so once it,
why they did that first place,

1279
01:15:09,731 --> 01:15:12,100
nobody really knows.
But once they did it,

1280
01:15:12,101 --> 01:15:16,000
once he turned too soon to desert,
we'll leave it the 20,

1281
01:15:16,001 --> 01:15:21,001
25 years without sweeping it out.
If it goes 30 right up to the neck 

1282
01:15:21,001 --> 01:15:21,001
again.

1283
01:15:21,001 --> 01:15:21,170
Who,
uh,

1284
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:24,130
what,
who was responsible for cutting the face

1285
01:15:24,131 --> 01:15:25,030
into the sphinx?

1286
01:15:25,550 --> 01:15:26,390
Oh,
we don't know.

1287
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:31,720
We're convinced.
We're convinced that it was required 

1288
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:32,330
because it's much too small for the 
body.

1289
01:15:32,331 --> 01:15:36,170
It's disproportionate to the body and 
some way,

1290
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:41,770
well,
it looks in better shape for two 

1291
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:41,770
reasons.
One,

1292
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:42,980
it's a much harder outcrop of stone and 
b,

1293
01:15:42,981 --> 01:15:45,130
it's been restored.
The head dresses and all of that.

1294
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:49,180
If you look at old photos of the site 
taken around 1900,

1295
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,970
so you see that it's really much more 
weather than it's looked,

1296
01:15:52,971 --> 01:15:57,470
but they prepared the face and so on.
But I mean,

1297
01:15:57,471 --> 01:16:00,620
this has all kinds of repercussions.
For example,

1298
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:03,350
well,
you know the story,

1299
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:05,700
the

1300
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:10,190
we're doing the video Mark Lane or was 
the,

1301
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:13,960
the,
the loyal opposition as it were in the,

1302
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:19,050
in the eighties.
Because the sphinx is supposed to look 

1303
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:21,121
like the pharaoh kopra.
He's hadn't looked at least like the 

1304
01:16:21,121 --> 01:16:24,060
federal kopra,
but lana did an early computer study 

1305
01:16:24,060 --> 01:16:27,661
when back in the eighties when computers
were still pretty primitive in which he 

1306
01:16:27,661 --> 01:16:31,741
said kafra data into the paramed and 
sorry into the computer and then 

1307
01:16:32,891 --> 01:16:35,950
superimposed the results upon the head 
of this length and said,

1308
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:37,930
well blah.
The swing says conference.

1309
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,220
Well,
last,

1310
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:43,420
this was sort of silly,
but it got a lot of press was in the New

1311
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:45,850
York times and I think the smithsonian 
all over the place.

1312
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:51,320
So when we finally got the funding 
together to do our mystery of the 

1313
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,150
swings,
we really had to address that because it

1314
01:16:52,151 --> 01:16:53,680
was,
it was,

1315
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:56,940
um,
he was well known and you know,

1316
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:57,880
people say,
well,

1317
01:16:57,881 --> 01:17:02,881
you know,
it's been proved that this links is the 

1318
01:17:02,881 --> 01:17:02,881
face of contra.

1319
01:17:02,881 --> 01:17:02,881
So how do you disprove it?
Well,

1320
01:17:02,881 --> 01:17:07,350
I wanted to,
I wanted to actually use exactly the 

1321
01:17:09,711 --> 01:17:14,711
same message of that lane or years,
but seed elvis data into the computer 

1322
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:18,980
and proved slinks was really meant to be
elvis.

1323
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:22,970
But the,
we thought that was a cool idea.

1324
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:28,420
But what happened was that the elvis 
foundation wouldn't let us use the 

1325
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:32,810
king's emits in that context and I think
elvis would have been furious.

1326
01:17:32,811 --> 01:17:36,860
He would love to go.
But what happened then was my,

1327
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:38,830
my criminal partner,
boris,

1328
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:41,360
who was an interesting guy,
he was an ex ex,

1329
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:44,710
a race driver.
He drove for ferrari for years and lived

1330
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:46,700
here for porsche.
It was an interesting character.

1331
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:48,790
Anyway,
he came up with the idea of,

1332
01:17:48,791 --> 01:17:53,791
well,
let's get a forensic detective to go 

1333
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,990
with us to Egypt to,
you know,

1334
01:17:54,991 --> 01:17:58,520
do a study of these places and see if 
they really could be the same model,

1335
01:17:58,521 --> 01:18:02,110
the plan,
the same human being and so song.

1336
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:07,130
Couple of phone calls and we got in 
touch with a guy named frank domingo is 

1337
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:11,470
the senior forensic detective from the 
nyp ed and he came to Egypt with us and 

1338
01:18:11,931 --> 01:18:16,931
this is more long story about how he got
frank to agree to go and he did his 

1339
01:18:16,931 --> 01:18:21,071
study and charlotte unquestionably that 
the toothpaste is could not possibly 

1340
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:27,520
have been the same.
Then the question came up because when 

1341
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,611
you look at the profile of the strings,
even though it's pretty ruined us 

1342
01:18:30,611 --> 01:18:34,781
because it's been severely damaged,
even though it was damaged,

1343
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:39,390
it's quite clear that not only is a 
different face than that,

1344
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:43,010
but it's probably a different race.
In other words,

1345
01:18:43,011 --> 01:18:46,240
it really looks like the sub saharan 
african place,

1346
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:48,170
not even like,
not like an egyptian nice.

1347
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:53,290
Which would mean it was done by the new 
orleans who took over Egypt libyans 

1348
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:53,630
earlier,
you know,

1349
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:56,180
from your spouse was the new orleans.

1350
01:18:56,270 --> 01:19:01,270
New orleans don't look like don't look 
the same light as the sub saharan 

1351
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:06,670
africans.
So and in fact they leave Egypt taller.

1352
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:10,520
These jips egyptologists or prejudice 
does everyone else.

1353
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:13,910
The last thing they want to know is that
notice that the snakes as,

1354
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:14,940
uh,
as,

1355
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:15,690
as,
as,

1356
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:18,740
as an african african and,
but in,

1357
01:19:18,850 --> 01:19:21,620
in the earlier,
in the 19th century,

1358
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,900
lots of people just,
you know,

1359
01:19:23,901 --> 01:19:28,901
there was no egyptology then lots of 
travelers because stuff's labelle and 

1360
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:36,430
florence nightingale and all kinds of 
people who wrote very beautifully about 

1361
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:38,840
Egypt traveling in Egypt than that in 
the 19th century.

1362
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:39,950
Sad.
Well,

1363
01:19:39,951 --> 01:19:44,951
you know,
this is a negro I face and the leads of 

1364
01:19:44,951 --> 01:19:46,460
tolerances to simply ignored that.
Well,

1365
01:19:46,461 --> 01:19:48,050
anyway,
with frank.

1366
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:52,160
So he did this careful forensic study.
I think it's on my website.

1367
01:19:52,161 --> 01:19:54,560
I'm not sure.
Actually I should tell you something.

1368
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:59,540
My website's [inaudible] dot com or.net
and uh,

1369
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:00,830
anyway,
it's in there somewhere.

1370
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:06,020
And um,
so we asked him about it that,

1371
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:07,860
that um,
know what do you think is,

1372
01:20:07,861 --> 01:20:12,240
can this be an african place?
And domingo is a cautious.

1373
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:13,230
But he said,
well,

1374
01:20:13,231 --> 01:20:18,231
he said you can't prove that it is,
but it is consistent with subsaharan 

1375
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:23,480
subsaharan physiognomy.
And so I'll actually with that was 

1376
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:30,060
actually my son's very,
like,

1377
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:33,240
my partner was very funny when he said 
that he's in like,

1378
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:37,800
this is bad news for the,
the academics is that not only.

1379
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,390
First of all it means that,
you know,

1380
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:45,470
there is an atlantis,
it wasn't atlantis and second of all 

1381
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:45,470
they will black.

1382
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:49,740
It was pretty funny.
But anyway,

1383
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:55,100
subsequently I did an op ed piece for 
the New York times and I carefully left 

1384
01:20:55,711 --> 01:20:57,360
out this old because this is,
you know,

1385
01:20:57,361 --> 01:21:01,140
we want to go back there and do some 
more work and I was in enough water with

1386
01:21:01,141 --> 01:21:06,141
the academics to begin with.
So I didn't mention anything about this 

1387
01:21:06,141 --> 01:21:09,660
sub saharan african swank's.
But a few weeks later the New York times

1388
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:14,720
published a letter from a,
an orthodontist and Massachusetts 

1389
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:19,551
orthodontist.
And the orthodontist is another expert 

1390
01:21:19,551 --> 01:21:19,860
in facial,
you know,

1391
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:22,710
in places.
And he came up with it,

1392
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:24,420
not as he came up with it and said,
yeah,

1393
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:26,430
this is,
this is an african face.

1394
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,710
So that was very interesting.
And now when we,

1395
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:33,770
when we write our book,
when we write the shock and I get 

1396
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:37,460
cracking on the bridge of syrah,
we will go into that and actually 

1397
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:38,320
interviewed,
um,

1398
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:39,880
track him down.

1399
01:21:39,890 --> 01:21:41,790
I lives in newton,
Massachusetts,

1400
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:42,810
the,
uh,

1401
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:47,580
the orthodontist who wrote that letter 
and see what he has to say about it.

1402
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:48,540
But anyway,
that was,

1403
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:53,020
that was an interesting thing about the,
about the head of the sinks,

1404
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:58,030
that it's not original to the,
to the fates of the spanx because it's 

1405
01:21:58,711 --> 01:22:03,711
much too small proportion of the body 
and it seems to be a subsaharan african 

1406
01:22:04,981 --> 01:22:07,200
phase.
We don't know when it was required.

1407
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:12,540
Maybe the strengths snakes and we think 
over 30,000

1408
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:17,541
years old and it has to be required in 
some period of time in between.

1409
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:24,140
Well,
it may be that that's like living in 

1410
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:27,351
Egypt at the time.
That was the civilization of ease of 

1411
01:22:27,351 --> 01:22:27,351
use.
When you get back far enough,

1412
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,240
there's not much less than.
This is why,

1413
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:32,430
for example,
the paleolithic caves,

1414
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:37,660
he.
He'll live with a bunch of caves but 

1415
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:39,381
nothing else.
we don't know what anybody else was 

1416
01:22:39,381 --> 01:22:39,381
doing.
Along comes,

1417
01:22:39,381 --> 01:22:42,831
go back,
locked up and suddenly the whole 

1418
01:22:42,831 --> 01:22:45,740
everything changes because you've got to
have this extraordinary structure that 

1419
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:45,740
they take the 10,000
bc,

1420
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:50,720
so this comes up and it's very difficult
to create a detailed picture of what was

1421
01:22:54,831 --> 01:22:55,700
going on.
Then

1422
01:22:55,910 --> 01:23:00,910
why are they doing work on the sphinx?
Why are they like fixing the pause and 

1423
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:06,490
fixing the ears and are fixing the head 
dress and all the different things that 

1424
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:06,490
they've done

1425
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:09,040
to the sphinx?
That seems to me to be very confusing.

1426
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:14,041
I mean you have this amazing ancient 
structure and they're building on it to 

1427
01:23:14,041 --> 01:23:16,990
like recreate that.
The toes of the lion and just seems very

1428
01:23:16,991 --> 01:23:17,590
odd to me.

1429
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:20,330
Well,
it is actually very odd.

1430
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,700
I mean it really is.
When you get up next to it,

1431
01:23:22,730 --> 01:23:26,120
it's pretty crumbly and so and but 
there's,

1432
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:31,290
the jury is still out.
if the repairing repairs are not 

1433
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:35,291
actually doing more damage than would be
done if they just left it to the 

1434
01:23:35,291 --> 01:23:37,190
elements.
We don't know what they are doing it and

1435
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:39,890
I'm very often they're doing it and it's
a pretty botched up job.

1436
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:41,710
It looks terrible.
Yeah,

1437
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:46,770
it does mostly look pretty.
There's like little pregnancy pregnancy 

1438
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:48,130
from the toes.
Yeah.

1439
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,610
Yeah.
It's really.

1440
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:52,520
It's really quite horrible.
But you see it's been repaired.

1441
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:55,310
The repair campaigns,
it's not just modern.

1442
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:59,900
The earliest repair campaigns.
This is another piece of the big puzzle.

1443
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:03,260
The earliest repair campaigns are old 
kingdom.

1444
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:06,050
In other words,
the time that the sphinx was,

1445
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:11,350
the time that the swing was supposedly 
built,

1446
01:24:11,351 --> 01:24:12,580
it was already weathered.

1447
01:24:12,950 --> 01:24:17,950
Well,
isn't that part of the hieroglyphs 

1448
01:24:17,950 --> 01:24:17,990
involved in attributed to one particular
pharaoh's name,

1449
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:21,500
that he fell asleep and he had a dream 
that if he uncovered the sphinx,

1450
01:24:21,501 --> 01:24:22,640
he would control Egypt?

1451
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:24,710
Yeah,
that's tucked moses.

1452
01:24:24,711 --> 01:24:25,990
The third,
the fourth,

1453
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:32,630
and in that tablet that stele there was 
subsequently flaked off the first 

1454
01:24:35,361 --> 01:24:40,361
syllable of kartra cop named cuff.
And from that they,

1455
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:46,470
they,
they reduced the extrapolated rather 

1456
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:48,260
instead of will come from,
must've been the builder of the spanx.

1457
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:49,850
But there's nothing that says that.
Well,

1458
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:54,851
we think is that comfort was the repair 
of this banks because even,

1459
01:24:55,010 --> 01:24:56,000
I mean,
mark laners,

1460
01:24:56,080 --> 01:25:01,010
the loyal opposition notes that when the
strengths was first repaired,

1461
01:25:01,011 --> 01:25:04,130
it was already,
whether it's to its present condition.

1462
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,080
and he nevertheless says that,
uh,

1463
01:25:06,081 --> 01:25:07,570
well the,
the,

1464
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:08,320
the,
this,

1465
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:11,620
the old kingdom blocks that were 
repetitive.

1466
01:25:11,621 --> 01:25:15,950
It cannibalize from somewhere else.
it's really a cockamamie explanation.

1467
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:18,530
But you know,
when you,

1468
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:23,620
when you were playing in their arena and
they don't like what the evidence is,

1469
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:30,041
they moved the goal posts and that 
doesn't work well then they changed the 

1470
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:30,041
rules of the game.

1471
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:34,820
Is it their contention?
Is the conventional contention that the 

1472
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:37,350
sphinx was carved with that face 
originally?

1473
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,950
Yeah.
That's even though it's way out of.

1474
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:46,010
Even though,
even though it's even though it's much 

1475
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:49,840
too small proportionately and the rest 
of the snakes is spectacularly accurate 

1476
01:25:50,881 --> 01:25:53,370
proportionally.
Well not only that,

1477
01:25:53,371 --> 01:25:58,371
we're masters of proportion that they 
stick with that because it's too 

1478
01:25:58,371 --> 01:26:03,081
inconvenient.
You don't until you've dealt with these 

1479
01:26:03,081 --> 01:26:06,050
guys in other fields of science and 
scholarship,

1480
01:26:06,051 --> 01:26:08,990
but not much different people are 
particularly.

1481
01:26:08,991 --> 01:26:11,520
Men get very stubborn.
he's,

1482
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:12,480
you know,
we're,

1483
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:17,510
we're,
we're upsetting the apple cart and they 

1484
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:17,510
make a living selling apples.

1485
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:21,380
It doesn't make any sense to me is that,
that's completely discounting the actual

1486
01:26:21,381 --> 01:26:26,381
hard evidence of erosion.
There's a very different level of 

1487
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:27,140
erosion on the face than there is on the
rest of the body.

1488
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:28,190
Oh,
that's okay.

1489
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:33,400
Because that's a much harder.
That's a much harder outcrop of 

1490
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,060
limestone.
So that's been fully exposed whenever it

1491
01:26:35,061 --> 01:26:36,680
was carved,
fully exposed,

1492
01:26:36,681 --> 01:26:39,760
and it's not really whether that much 
but more than it looks.

1493
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:42,380
You look aT the old photographs you see 
the back of the head.

1494
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,300
it had been fairly severely.
Whether,

1495
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:46,730
but nothing like the body.
Yeah.

1496
01:26:46,731 --> 01:26:48,040
That seems crazy,
right?

1497
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:48,950
Actually,
what?

1498
01:26:48,951 --> 01:26:51,320
You have to go to jail.
He's got to come to Egypt with us.

1499
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:53,140
I would love to.
I'm scared though.

1500
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:55,630
It was scary right now.
It wasn't a dangerous.

1501
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:57,440
Oh no.
Well,

1502
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,840
not really.
Only if you're like trying to run it.

1503
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:01,890
No,
the,

1504
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,670
this is the,
this is the prestitutes.

1505
01:27:04,671 --> 01:27:09,671
So it's not that they're lying,
but only unrest is news.

1506
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:15,170
So even under the worst of circumstances
when the revolution was going on,

1507
01:27:15,171 --> 01:27:20,171
I was after the entire revolution and I 
refused to leave with the group that I 

1508
01:27:20,171 --> 01:27:21,050
was with.
I lead through the aids,

1509
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:23,030
you know.
And um,

1510
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:27,760
why did you refuse to leave?
Why did you refuse to leave?

1511
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:31,130
Because the government said we were 
supposed to leave.

1512
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:33,030
We said the hell with this wouldn't,
not.

1513
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:35,930
They're not after us.
So let's see what happens.

1514
01:27:35,931 --> 01:27:40,931
So we waited a few days and the attacker
in the streets and little of that sort 

1515
01:27:40,931 --> 01:27:41,780
of stuff,
it's spelled the tear gas but nobody was

1516
01:27:41,781 --> 01:27:44,660
after us so we were a few places we 
didn't get to,

1517
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:49,960
but for the rest we have the time of our
lives because we were the only green 

1518
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:55,250
ngos in Egypt and it was quite an 
experience when you used the crowds like

1519
01:27:55,611 --> 01:27:59,840
the superbowl to be there when the place
was empty and we didn't miss a couple of

1520
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:01,760
places,
but we had this fantastic time.

1521
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:06,820
So many in the middle of the revolution 
you're taking tours on and through the 

1522
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:08,930
sphinx and the temple man and all that.

1523
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,330
Yeah.
They wouldn't let him out after us.

1524
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,830
Happy to have us there.
And wow,

1525
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:18,520
that's a dude who's dedicated to Egypt 
technology.

1526
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:23,970
When you say no,
and again see at the,

1527
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:26,980
at the worst and the revolution that 
we're talking about this,

1528
01:28:26,981 --> 01:28:30,430
there were a million people protesting 
and a couple of different cities,

1529
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,650
but if there are million people 
protesting,

1530
01:28:32,651 --> 01:28:34,960
it means that there are 82 million 
lawrence.

1531
01:28:35,470 --> 01:28:39,340
so I have to do is not beat on tahrir 
square.

1532
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:42,760
What was the protest going on?
What's nowadays with cell phones,

1533
01:28:42,970 --> 01:28:45,340
it's very easy to avoid.
Oh my god,

1534
01:28:45,341 --> 01:28:47,230
that's hIlarious.
For us,

1535
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:52,680
they like having us.
There were very sort were a source of 

1536
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:54,470
income themselves.
I'm still doing my trips actually and,

1537
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:59,950
and you know,
it's not as easy to get them together 

1538
01:28:59,950 --> 01:29:00,010
because I have to go through this 
explanation all the time,

1539
01:29:00,370 --> 01:29:03,570
but this is the time to go there as a 
running at about 20 percent.

1540
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:08,190
So that's.
Revolution is good for business.

1541
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:09,870
Well no,
it's terrible.

1542
01:29:09,910 --> 01:29:13,230
It's terrible for business but for us.
Good for the experience.

1543
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:16,390
Yeah.
And actually I um,

1544
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:21,120
in fact instead the next trip is in,
the next step is in october.

1545
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:23,360
And I have a,
I mean,

1546
01:29:23,390 --> 01:29:24,720
you with your interest,
you,

1547
01:29:24,830 --> 01:29:26,820
you owe it to yourselves to get to 
Egypt.

1548
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:31,940
I do.
I have a friend who's the only ancient 

1549
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:32,240
ruins I've ever seen were mayan ruins 
and cheech and eatsa.

1550
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:34,470
That's,
that's about as far as I've seen.

1551
01:29:34,850 --> 01:29:39,850
Oh,
pretty impressive that Egypt is a 

1552
01:29:39,850 --> 01:29:41,270
different kettle of civilization because
we know so much about it.

1553
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:42,420
Yeah,
well usually,

1554
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:43,140
you know,
so much.

1555
01:29:43,141 --> 01:29:48,141
If I did go,
I would unquestionably go with you a 

1556
01:29:48,141 --> 01:29:51,140
magical Egypt.
That dvd series that you have is one of 

1557
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:51,140
my.
All time.

1558
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:55,460
My wife would come into the room and 
look at me and go fucking Egypt again 

1559
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:58,380
because I'd be sitting there watching 
this dvd series.

1560
01:29:58,590 --> 01:29:59,760
She's like,
how many of these others?

1561
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:01,810
Like eight dvds.
So um,

1562
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:04,750
how many dvds is the magical Egypt set?
Eight.

1563
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:06,660
Eight.
It's amazing.

1564
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:10,290
I've watched it 30 times.
I just go back and watch it over again.

1565
01:30:10,291 --> 01:30:11,360
But you know,
it got to,

1566
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:15,000
she got a little pissed off at me.
She was like enough stupid because I was

1567
01:30:15,001 --> 01:30:17,010
watching it in the bedroom,
you know,

1568
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:20,160
like she would come in and have to see 
sphinxes and shit.

1569
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:22,880
ShE not.
Oh no,

1570
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:25,230
she is a little bit but not,
not to the extent.

1571
01:30:25,231 --> 01:30:30,231
I'm a very obsessive person.
And when I first watched this 

1572
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:35,240
documentary,
ed did with charlton heston narrating 

1573
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:36,150
that I became obsessed with the whole 
idea of.

1574
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,720
And then I bought graham hancock's book 
and then it was all downhill.

1575
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:41,230
Well,
it's a huge.

1576
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:44,390
I mean it's really going exponentially 
now.

1577
01:30:44,391 --> 01:30:49,391
But actually I have on my list here,
I wanted to mention it to you because 

1578
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:53,570
you have a pretty big audience.
And I have a.

1579
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:58,870
I have a standing incentive offer that 
anybody who gets 10 people together to 

1580
01:30:59,361 --> 01:31:01,330
go on and needs Egypt.
Trump gets the freebie.

1581
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:06,160
Well minus the minus the airfare and the
blockchain.

1582
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:06,820
The tips.

1583
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,300
What we might do,
sir,

1584
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:12,610
is we might buy out the whole thing by 
all your whole tour.

1585
01:31:12,611 --> 01:31:15,130
And then brian downey down to go to 
Egypt.

1586
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:18,280
I'm talking to my cohost,
my cohost says,

1587
01:31:18,281 --> 01:31:23,281
fuck yeah,
he's down to go and we'll get all our 

1588
01:31:23,281 --> 01:31:23,281
friends together except joey because 
joey,

1589
01:31:23,281 --> 01:31:24,260
he can't leave the country.
And uh,

1590
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,500
we'll,
we'll take a desk squad tour to Egypt.

1591
01:31:26,501 --> 01:31:28,870
That might be amazing.
Wow.

1592
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:31,870
I'd be down with that kid.
Would it be safe to take children?

1593
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:35,040
Yeah.
Normally.

1594
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:37,680
But how old are the kids?
Really young too.

1595
01:31:37,681 --> 01:31:39,570
And for,
you know,

1596
01:31:39,571 --> 01:31:44,571
they're portable at that age,
but it's done.

1597
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:46,880
That can be done.
That's not what I want to hear.

1598
01:31:46,881 --> 01:31:47,420
I want to hear.
Yeah,

1599
01:31:47,421 --> 01:31:48,320
it's like disneyland.

1600
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,440
No,
I mean depends on the kids,

1601
01:31:52,441 --> 01:31:57,340
but that's not going to get anything 
that's spelled 14.

1602
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:00,060
They do get something out of it,
but you can do is,

1603
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:02,770
you know,
that the egyptians love kids,

1604
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:05,230
so you're just.
Wherever your hotel is,

1605
01:32:05,380 --> 01:32:09,260
you hire a nanny who plays with the kids
while we go out and looking.

1606
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:13,600
That's never happened.
But um,

1607
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:20,080
let's talk about the temple and man,
because that was one of the most 

1608
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:23,480
fascinating things of that magical Egypt
series was how the egyptians,

1609
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:28,770
the construction wasn't just beautiful.
IT wasn't just a functional art there,

1610
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:34,320
there was,
there was a methodology to what they 

1611
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,260
were making were they were literally in 
that one temple.

1612
01:32:36,261 --> 01:32:41,261
They neared the human body and explain.
Explain that because it's really a 

1613
01:32:41,601 --> 01:32:46,601
fascinating.
It's like a tribute to the human 

1614
01:32:46,601 --> 01:32:46,601
anatomy.

1615
01:32:46,601 --> 01:32:50,620
well,
it's not only as a tribute to the human 

1616
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:52,880
anatomy,
but it's stronger de lubicz.

1617
01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:58,010
The great genius with the 
unpronounceable name mean names mean a 

1618
01:32:58,101 --> 01:32:58,850
lot.
For example,

1619
01:32:58,851 --> 01:33:00,840
einstein is a great name for a genius 
of.

1620
01:33:00,870 --> 01:33:05,870
His name was manny plotnik.
No one ever would have heard of a lot 

1621
01:33:05,870 --> 01:33:09,890
smaller and smaller.
The luggage was a genius scholar and he 

1622
01:33:09,890 --> 01:33:14,030
really was brilliant and he realized 
it's a gun.

1623
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:16,910
More long story if you're a serpent in 
the sky and read my book.

1624
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:17,870
No,
I have not.

1625
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:18,860
Uh,
okay.

1626
01:33:18,861 --> 01:33:20,500
Well,
start putting the sky.

1627
01:33:20,910 --> 01:33:23,570
What's called In the sky.
It's called surfing in the sky,

1628
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:26,360
the high wisdom of ancient Egypt at the 
center of copy.

1629
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:28,390
Anyway,
um,

1630
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:33,530
he realized as he was doing the work on 
this on,

1631
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:35,750
on Egypt,
I'm the temple of luxor.

1632
01:33:35,751 --> 01:33:38,810
He had actually,
he went to Egypt.

1633
01:33:38,811 --> 01:33:43,811
He was a very interesting men,
died in the early sixties and never met 

1634
01:33:43,811 --> 01:33:43,811
him.

1635
01:33:43,811 --> 01:33:45,010
Um,
and he was a practicing alchemists,

1636
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:47,630
many of those floating around these 
days,

1637
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:51,770
but he went to Egypt because according 
to the,

1638
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:56,860
and I only realized this quite recently.
I thought the opposite until quite 

1639
01:33:56,860 --> 01:33:59,060
recently,
but see the,

1640
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:05,530
the egyptian tradition percolated down 
to the west and what are called the 

1641
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:10,460
hermetic tradition,
which is astrology and magic and number 

1642
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:13,460
symbolism and neoplatonism and all bunch
of these other disciplines.

1643
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:18,640
Never coherence as It needs it,
and schwaller went to Egypt and 37 in 

1644
01:34:20,001 --> 01:34:25,001
order to see if because they,
the renaissance scholars,

1645
01:34:26,601 --> 01:34:28,720
people like jeff dunham,
brunello and capital,

1646
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:33,750
and all of them were convinced.
I mean they took it on trust that Egypt 

1647
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:36,950
Was the founder of of wisdom.
The greeks agreed with that,

1648
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:42,570
but nowadays,
see this stuff's supposed to 

1649
01:34:42,570 --> 01:34:44,410
civilization.
It's supposed to have started with the 

1650
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:44,410
greeks,
but great stock,

1651
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:48,760
most of what was consequential and more 
accurate in their on their own 

1652
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:51,620
civilization from the egyptians and 
they're very open about it.

1653
01:34:51,621 --> 01:34:56,621
It's the modern day quack academics that
want to understand that because very 

1654
01:34:56,621 --> 01:34:59,300
interesting book,
black asina,

1655
01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:05,290
the aphrodisiac roots of greek 
civilization by a very fine cornell 

1656
01:35:05,971 --> 01:35:10,971
scholar called martin burnout and 
basically he proves that what we call 

1657
01:35:12,801 --> 01:35:17,801
history is really a white supremacist 
eurocentric invention put together by 

1658
01:35:23,381 --> 01:35:24,850
the,
by the ninth,

1659
01:35:24,860 --> 01:35:29,860
mainly by the 19th and early 20th 
century historians because they were 

1660
01:35:29,860 --> 01:35:33,530
determined to prove that real 
civilization began with the greeks.

1661
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:36,530
Because the greeks were swarthy little 
guys,

1662
01:35:36,531 --> 01:35:41,531
but light enough.
They weren't egyptian or submitted or 

1663
01:35:41,531 --> 01:35:42,980
black or anything like that.

1664
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:45,160
Or subsaharan african,
like the spanx,

1665
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:48,730
certainly not so.
So really history as it's taught even to

1666
01:35:48,731 --> 01:35:51,880
this day is really a white supremacist 
con job.

1667
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:55,670
So it really is possible that sub 
saharan africans might've built all that

1668
01:35:55,671 --> 01:35:56,060
stuff.

1669
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:58,050
Well maybe.
Yeah,

1670
01:35:58,060 --> 01:35:58,820
that could be.

1671
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:02,250
They obviously built that face or or 
likely built that thing.

1672
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,550
That's very likely.
Hey,

1673
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:05,500
can I take a break?

1674
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:08,350
Yeah.
Get yourself some vodka.

1675
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:11,830
I wish I had some over your hair.
Oh,

1676
01:36:11,950 --> 01:36:13,970
why don't you.
I'll fly you out fella.

1677
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:19,440
Okay.
Anytime you want to come down to la and 

1678
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:19,440
do this in person,
let me know.

1679
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:24,480
All right.
We'll be right back with John Anthony 

1680
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:24,510
West as john goes and uh,
get some more vodka.

1681
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:28,690
Fucking love it to computer fan.
I love all of it.

1682
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:33,370
I love his computer fan going off is 
every time he gets an email to beep,

1683
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,420
every time you get a fucking text 
message or a message from skype,

1684
01:36:37,421 --> 01:36:38,830
that shit comes out.
Can you,

1685
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:41,730
can you turn that off?
Skype messaging,

1686
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:43,540
whatever the hell that is.
But uh,

1687
01:36:43,570 --> 01:36:46,340
everybody who's listening to this,
thank you very much for,

1688
01:36:46,341 --> 01:36:47,440
uh,
for being patient.

1689
01:36:47,441 --> 01:36:48,300
And then,
uh,

1690
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:52,690
and if you're not familiar with this 
particular subject,

1691
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:57,430
it's one of my personal favorites and 
john's dvd series,

1692
01:36:57,431 --> 01:37:01,240
which is called magical Egypt,
which you can still purchase online.

1693
01:37:01,270 --> 01:37:03,400
I think it's magical.
Egypt.com,

1694
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:06,910
I believe you can also get it on amazon 
and a bunch of different places,

1695
01:37:06,911 --> 01:37:10,060
but it is just fantastic and it's 
really,

1696
01:37:10,061 --> 01:37:15,061
really entertaining stuff and it has to 
do with so much of why Egypt is so,

1697
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:19,540
such a fascinating and mysterious 
culture.

1698
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:24,990
It's really a one of the most amazing 
dvd series you can get and it's at no 

1699
01:37:25,241 --> 01:37:30,241
one,
but it would take a guy like john who's 

1700
01:37:30,241 --> 01:37:31,150
spent his whole life being obsessed with
Egypt to produce something like this.

1701
01:37:31,151 --> 01:37:34,630
It's a real work of a,
of passion and interest.

1702
01:37:35,020 --> 01:37:36,180
And uh,
I've,

1703
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:38,530
like I told him,
I've watched it like 100 times.

1704
01:37:38,531 --> 01:37:38,920
It's,
it's,

1705
01:37:38,921 --> 01:37:43,921
it's incredible.
It's great stuff because he's still 

1706
01:37:43,921 --> 01:37:43,921
gone.
Do we have an image of him?

1707
01:37:43,921 --> 01:37:43,921
Oh,
you're back.

1708
01:37:43,921 --> 01:37:43,921
There you go.

1709
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:48,740
No,
I don't think he can get it on amazon.

1710
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,840
You can't.
I don't think you can,

1711
01:37:50,841 --> 01:37:54,530
but you can get it direct through me or 
through that website so you can go to my

1712
01:37:54,531 --> 01:37:56,390
website and think.
So

1713
01:37:57,020 --> 01:37:59,120
I thought someone was selling it on 
amazon.

1714
01:37:59,121 --> 01:38:00,260
Sometimes they do that.

1715
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:06,120
Yeah.
I don't think it's on amazon and 

1716
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:06,120
actually it's really,
it's not me,

1717
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:09,580
it's my,
let's say it's my work that sets it off,

1718
01:38:09,581 --> 01:38:14,581
but it's really my genius partner named 
chance gardener who's responsible for 

1719
01:38:15,161 --> 01:38:16,090
that.
I mean he,

1720
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:19,060
he,
he was a guy making a lot of money in la

1721
01:38:19,061 --> 01:38:24,061
as a three d animator and he got 
fascinated with this whole subject sort 

1722
01:38:24,061 --> 01:38:24,240
of like you.

1723
01:38:24,850 --> 01:38:26,950
Well just john,
just to let you know,

1724
01:38:27,190 --> 01:38:29,950
just to let people know and let you know
because you might not know this.

1725
01:38:29,951 --> 01:38:34,330
It is available on amazon.com.
Not only is it available on amazon.com,

1726
01:38:34,331 --> 01:38:37,030
it's also available on amazon instant 
video.

1727
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:40,090
People can watch it instantly.
Is amazon jacking you,

1728
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:41,230
are they paying you for this,
john?

1729
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,940
No,
it's my partner handles the,

1730
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:44,490
the,
uh,

1731
01:38:44,810 --> 01:38:49,330
it's amazon who is my partner who 
handles the business side of things,

1732
01:38:49,331 --> 01:38:50,980
but I know really

1733
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,450
well you've been ripped off before,
right?

1734
01:38:52,451 --> 01:38:54,150
He told us she got ripped off for the 
other one,

1735
01:38:55,140 --> 01:39:00,140
but in this case I think I'll have to 
check with chance check in on that guy.

1736
01:39:00,460 --> 01:39:02,260
Oh,
I know that it's,

1737
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,080
it's,
you know,

1738
01:39:04,081 --> 01:39:06,810
the whole thing is just brings in no 
money.

1739
01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:07,340
You know,
he's,

1740
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:12,400
he's,
he's sacrificed for five years of his 

1741
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:15,201
life putting this extraordinary thing 
together and then people pirate it all 

1742
01:39:15,201 --> 01:39:16,980
the time.
And this thing you can do about it.

1743
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:18,360
I mean it's really criminal.

1744
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,520
Yeah.
People,

1745
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:22,830
if you want to watch the magical egypt's
p series,

1746
01:39:22,831 --> 01:39:26,880
don't watch it on youtube or watch it on
any of those places where it is pirated,

1747
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:29,610
please go and a and supported because 
uh,

1748
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:30,570
like I was saying,
john,

1749
01:39:30,571 --> 01:39:35,571
when you went to get your vodka,
it's one of my favorite all time dvd 

1750
01:39:35,571 --> 01:39:38,631
series and it would take a guy like you 
to put something like that together who 

1751
01:39:38,631 --> 01:39:42,090
was such a work of passion.
Like very few people are going to put 

1752
01:39:42,090 --> 01:39:42,090
together eight dvds.

1753
01:39:42,570 --> 01:39:44,380
Who did that really see?
I mean he,

1754
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:47,770
he,
he got it going and I supplied obviously

1755
01:39:47,771 --> 01:39:51,610
I supplied the egyptology and we 
conferred on how to do it,

1756
01:39:51,611 --> 01:39:55,910
but he's single handedly produced it,
shot it.

1757
01:39:57,550 --> 01:39:59,070
It's really brilliant.
And you know,

1758
01:39:59,290 --> 01:40:04,290
as soon as it's done on a shoestring so 
it doesn't look like a glossy nbc 

1759
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:04,900
production.
But it's beautiful.

1760
01:40:04,930 --> 01:40:07,450
It doesn't really.
I'm proud to have been a part of that,

1761
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:09,880
you know?
I mean we're partners,

1762
01:40:09,881 --> 01:40:13,030
but credit where credit is due.
I mean left to my own devices.

1763
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:15,490
I know I could write,
I could write the script,

1764
01:40:15,491 --> 01:40:17,440
but I couldn't do the production.

1765
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:20,050
Yeah,
it's really an amazing piece of work.

1766
01:40:20,210 --> 01:40:24,240
Says well worth getting hold of and 
actually on,

1767
01:40:24,300 --> 01:40:27,360
on the subject of putting this stuff 
together.

1768
01:40:27,361 --> 01:40:32,361
I've been talking in any number of 
occasions about us doing this.

1769
01:40:32,570 --> 01:40:37,570
The next video they zipped happy.
The dawn of civilization.

1770
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:42,050
And actually I should mention this 
because I,

1771
01:40:42,051 --> 01:40:47,051
I have,
I have a nonprofit foundation that we 

1772
01:40:48,121 --> 01:40:52,530
set up with that 10 years ago,
but the ancient wisdom foundation,

1773
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:56,740
but it's been since most of the time,
you know,

1774
01:40:56,741 --> 01:41:01,741
people would contribute now and again we
use it for travel and research and that 

1775
01:41:01,741 --> 01:41:05,251
sort of thing.
But now we've got a really bright guy 

1776
01:41:05,251 --> 01:41:07,750
contacted me,
kind of the whole work and fascinated by

1777
01:41:07,751 --> 01:41:12,220
the whole thing and he's really,
he's got the smarts and the drive to put

1778
01:41:12,221 --> 01:41:15,970
it all together and rebid the fly it.
So it's now,

1779
01:41:16,750 --> 01:41:19,630
it's now the website is under 
construction,

1780
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:25,110
but we're,
we're now looking to both micro finance 

1781
01:41:25,241 --> 01:41:27,880
and macro finance this show.

1782
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:32,880
And it's funny because it's been an idea
of mine for decades and now it's become 

1783
01:41:36,731 --> 01:41:38,830
a possibility.
I mean years ago.

1784
01:41:38,831 --> 01:41:42,790
So I haven't devoted my entire life 
through Egypt and these things because I

1785
01:41:42,791 --> 01:41:47,350
started out as a novelist,
a playwright and a screenwriter and have

1786
01:41:47,351 --> 01:41:48,820
a lot of things done.
And actually,

1787
01:41:48,821 --> 01:41:52,630
I think you asked me this earlier,
like I wandered off from the subject,

1788
01:41:52,631 --> 01:41:54,520
but as a,
as a young kid,

1789
01:41:54,521 --> 01:41:57,910
how did I get into this?
I started out,

1790
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:03,590
I realized what about the age of 12 or 
13 that I was living in a lunatic 

1791
01:42:03,590 --> 01:42:04,930
asylum.
Everyone else called progress.

1792
01:42:04,931 --> 01:42:09,100
But I mean I knew it was madness,
but I couldn't put it together.

1793
01:42:09,101 --> 01:42:12,970
But by the time I was 19 or 20,
I knew what I wanted to do.

1794
01:42:12,971 --> 01:42:17,460
I knew I was in a lunatic asylum and 
what I wanted to be was I wanted to be a

1795
01:42:17,461 --> 01:42:22,461
little boy at the emperor has no clothes
and that's what I started out writing 

1796
01:42:22,461 --> 01:42:22,461
satire.

1797
01:42:22,461 --> 01:42:24,580
It's brutal satire plays and things that
were done.

1798
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:29,840
There might be money.
I'm trying to resuscitate some of that 

1799
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:30,670
stuff now.
But anyway,

1800
01:42:30,671 --> 01:42:31,930
and then gradually,
gradually,

1801
01:42:31,931 --> 01:42:34,480
gradually I understood that there was 
another.

1802
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:38,590
The human beings,
we're not always insane.

1803
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:41,230
And one,
one music,

1804
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:46,680
classical music,
beethoven's quartets and month of these 

1805
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:49,900
vessels of 16 it's 10.
And then when I was in the army in 

1806
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:49,900
Germany,
needless to say,

1807
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:54,190
list drafted my.
but I had a great time.

1808
01:42:54,191 --> 01:42:58,850
I was in Germany,
my one and only porsche for $2,400

1809
01:42:58,851 --> 01:43:01,810
from the factory talking about.
Yeah,

1810
01:43:01,811 --> 01:43:03,040
well that's what it was.
And those was.

1811
01:43:03,850 --> 01:43:08,850
And I remember driving as I was driving 
to France and early,

1812
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:14,260
it was a november all by myself.
I'm early in the morning,

1813
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:18,310
went to the cathedral of shots.
It was absolutely empty.

1814
01:43:18,311 --> 01:43:21,050
I mean this is before there was any 
traveled to europe and,

1815
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:24,190
and I realized that it was an epiphany 
that,

1816
01:43:24,590 --> 01:43:29,590
you know,
however monstrous the church was and is 

1817
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:32,080
somebody geniuses,
built this incredible structure.

1818
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:37,590
And then it took another few.
I still didn't put it all together and 

1819
01:43:37,590 --> 01:43:40,410
took another few years before and by 
this time I'd had my first short story 

1820
01:43:40,410 --> 01:43:41,880
published and I was living in Spain on 
the island,

1821
01:43:41,890 --> 01:43:46,000
but visa and,
and gradually gradually understood,

1822
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:51,400
you know,
there was another side to this and then 

1823
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:51,400
all of a sudden,
again,

1824
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:56,320
more complicated story.
But I got interested in the gurdjieff 

1825
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,681
work and be so it would become old 
touristed up and connected with my first

1826
01:44:02,781 --> 01:44:05,450
wife and we moved to england.
She was an actress,

1827
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:10,220
I wanted to get into the gurdjieff work 
and they're the first,

1828
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:15,520
the first nonfiction book,
the case for astrology showed up and 

1829
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,701
that's how I got into smaller.
So that's about the late sixties when I 

1830
01:44:18,701 --> 01:44:18,920
got interested in,
you know,

1831
01:44:18,921 --> 01:44:23,921
when I really,
when I really got interested in all of 

1832
01:44:23,921 --> 01:44:23,921
this stuff.
Anyway.

1833
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:28,030
Anyway,
the,

1834
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:32,060
the uh,
but I always had this idea because I had

1835
01:44:33,670 --> 01:44:36,500
enough experiences with,
you know,

1836
01:44:36,510 --> 01:44:41,510
with hollywood and um,
and you know,

1837
01:44:41,631 --> 01:44:43,870
the film,
the film industry and,

1838
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:48,170
and even the apical side of things and 
that you know,

1839
01:44:48,171 --> 01:44:53,171
that the,
the producer's own you and to get 

1840
01:44:53,171 --> 01:44:56,861
anything that's really original,
done the way that you wanted done is 

1841
01:44:56,861 --> 01:45:00,971
next to impossible.
and I had this idea that somehow or 

1842
01:45:00,971 --> 01:45:03,260
another micro financing projects of you 
couldn't do it in those days.

1843
01:45:03,261 --> 01:45:08,261
I mean,
how are you going to send out a billion 

1844
01:45:08,261 --> 01:45:08,480
mailings or anything like that.
But now with the,

1845
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:12,170
with the internet,
you can get to these huge databases.

1846
01:45:12,710 --> 01:45:17,710
And so and so now we've got,
we're putting in place a and micro 

1847
01:45:20,181 --> 01:45:24,500
financing aspect of it.
And actually I have,

1848
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:29,520
I've always been good at thinking up 
good marketing ideas and just never do 

1849
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:29,520
them.

1850
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:33,820
well john just get on twitter,
you need to get on twitter and then get 

1851
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:33,820
a kickstarter accounts.

1852
01:45:33,820 --> 01:45:35,210
Well,
but what we're doing,

1853
01:45:35,290 --> 01:45:40,290
and I'm going to talk about it now,
it's not yet a promise because we have 

1854
01:45:40,290 --> 01:45:42,170
to make sure the lawyers that it's 
legal,

1855
01:45:42,171 --> 01:45:45,440
but we think it's legal.
We pretty sure it couldn't be illegal,

1856
01:45:45,441 --> 01:45:50,441
but we have a cool.
I came up with a really cool incentive 

1857
01:45:50,441 --> 01:45:53,780
offer,
which is that if you put in,

1858
01:45:54,470 --> 01:45:58,490
if you get on it for a $50 donation and 
you can split it,

1859
01:45:58,491 --> 01:46:00,830
you know,
you guys can put it in five each and one

1860
01:46:00,831 --> 01:46:05,180
of them is going to win.
That'S what you put in 50 bucks and that

1861
01:46:05,181 --> 01:46:10,181
buys you a ticket to effectively a 
raffle.

1862
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:12,350
And when,
when we get up to 50,000,

1863
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:17,860
we got up to $50,000.
We have the drawing and somebody wins a 

1864
01:46:17,860 --> 01:46:21,911
free trip to Egypt with me.
So we think that that's because I'm very

1865
01:46:22,191 --> 01:46:23,960
interested in getting to the young 
people.

1866
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:25,140
Actually,
you know,

1867
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:28,070
people my age will mostly people my age 
anyway,

1868
01:46:28,071 --> 01:46:29,570
but,
but um,

1869
01:46:30,470 --> 01:46:34,570
but I'm particularly interested in 
getting this message to young people and

1870
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:36,530
you know,
50 bucks for some people is,

1871
01:46:37,340 --> 01:46:42,340
is a lot,
but it isn't really a lot of figure it 

1872
01:46:42,340 --> 01:46:42,340
out.
I mean,

1873
01:46:42,340 --> 01:46:43,550
what's 50 bucks?
It's 10 beers that are not very good bar

1874
01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:45,430
or a meal.
The tool,

1875
01:46:45,490 --> 01:46:47,960
they're not very good restaurants.
Um,

1876
01:46:48,050 --> 01:46:51,030
anybody can figure it out.
Couldn't afford 60 bucks.

1877
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:55,260
So we're,
we're putting this into place and if you

1878
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:58,200
do go online,
I think the website is up already.

1879
01:46:58,201 --> 01:47:00,840
It's ancient wisdom,
ancient wisdom,

1880
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:04,290
ancient wisdom foundation.org.

1881
01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:08,180
Now when you go on these egyptian trips,
how long did they take

1882
01:47:09,550 --> 01:47:13,300
the standard is now,
I think it's 15 or 16 days.

1883
01:47:13,301 --> 01:47:14,580
Door to door.
Whoa.

1884
01:47:14,750 --> 01:47:16,980
That was really intense.
I mean I'm,

1885
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:20,620
I'm talking what's going on now?
Those aren't all day long.

1886
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:23,420
So it's all day.
You talking for 15,

1887
01:47:23,421 --> 01:47:25,340
16 days.
Yeah.

1888
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:27,890
That's got to be exhauSting.
Yes,

1889
01:47:29,630 --> 01:47:33,440
but it must keep you pretty,
pretty sharp on egyptian history.

1890
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:39,640
Will we?
Not only that actually gets that.

1891
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:45,320
You see,
see Egypt,

1892
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:49,850
nobody in America has ever experienced 
the real civilization,

1893
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:55,390
what we have progress,
what we call it progress is the 

1894
01:47:55,390 --> 01:47:56,810
antithesis of civilization.
This is shiny barbarism.

1895
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:59,660
And so Egypt is an eye opener and as I 
said,

1896
01:47:59,661 --> 01:48:01,110
I came to it,
you know,

1897
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:06,310
through arts and great sacred music and 
through the shop.

1898
01:48:06,630 --> 01:48:11,630
and then suddenly I realized how 
important this loves and along came 

1899
01:48:11,630 --> 01:48:15,580
smaller and all of the study,
but what Egypt does is that it 

1900
01:48:18,021 --> 01:48:23,021
introduced to them through the symbolist
symbolist interpretation which was 

1901
01:48:23,021 --> 01:48:27,880
smaller de lubicz put together.
OTherwise it's just academic egyptology 

1902
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:31,970
kind of like angry actually because 
you've experienced this fabulous art.

1903
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:37,310
you get listened to all this bullshit 
that that's telling you that has no 

1904
01:48:37,310 --> 01:48:38,120
connection with what you've actually 
experienced.

1905
01:48:38,650 --> 01:48:40,370
So,
so Egypt,

1906
01:48:40,371 --> 01:48:45,371
as I often start lectins all by saying 
Egypt is like sex that gets everybody's 

1907
01:48:46,191 --> 01:48:47,960
attention lives these like sex.

1908
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:53,290
Now you can read all about it and I've 
kinda been fussing and you can look at 

1909
01:48:53,290 --> 01:48:54,200
pictures and that's kind of interesting 
too.

1910
01:48:54,590 --> 01:48:56,420
Like until you've actually experienced 
that,

1911
01:48:56,421 --> 01:49:01,421
you don't understand anything about it.
So he ends up is like that once you're 

1912
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:04,220
there,
it hits,

1913
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:06,640
I mean there's no mistaking about it 
and,

1914
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:12,120
and so it's,
it's to me it's very gratifying to be 

1915
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:16,601
able to be,
to be the agency for allowing people to 

1916
01:49:16,671 --> 01:49:21,671
have that experience and unfortunately I
had originally hoped to have a little 

1917
01:49:22,461 --> 01:49:27,461
business where there are a handful of 
people who understand symbolist Egypt 

1918
01:49:27,461 --> 01:49:32,350
well enough to retranSmit it,
but actually I'm the only one who does 

1919
01:49:32,350 --> 01:49:33,800
these trips.
So one other person could.

1920
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:36,320
very brilliant lady called normandy 
ellis,

1921
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:39,290
but even that doesn't have the 
intellectual rigor,

1922
01:49:39,291 --> 01:49:40,940
the mine,
my stuff does.

1923
01:49:41,180 --> 01:49:46,180
So I'm almost the only show in town,
but it's very satisfying to me to be 

1924
01:49:47,951 --> 01:49:48,310
able

1925
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:52,660
to be able to open this experience to 
people.

1926
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:57,900
And also invariably the trips have very 
interesting people on them with 

1927
01:49:59,081 --> 01:50:04,081
expertise in a number of,
of disciplines that are relevant to 

1928
01:50:04,081 --> 01:50:05,560
Egypt.
So no trip goes,

1929
01:50:05,650 --> 01:50:10,650
goes by without me,
without me learning a lot myself.

1930
01:50:11,860 --> 01:50:16,860
I mean I send sometimes very important 
things so it doesn't get tiring and 

1931
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:18,650
yeah,
it's a lot.

1932
01:50:18,740 --> 01:50:20,800
It's physically,
it's a lot of work,

1933
01:50:20,860 --> 01:50:23,220
but now I'm in pretty good shape for my 
age.

1934
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:25,990
John,
I wanted to ask you a question about the

1935
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:30,760
more recent idea that perhaps the blocks
and the pyramid.

1936
01:50:30,761 --> 01:50:35,761
We're not cut from stone,
but rather made out of a limestone 

1937
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:37,480
concrete.
Have you?

1938
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:39,100
Are you familiar with these theories?

1939
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:44,920
Yeah.
That's the video that's and that's been 

1940
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:47,771
looKed into like geologists and and it.
It's completely untenable and the video 

1941
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:52,460
should know better.
He's a polymer scientist or something of

1942
01:50:52,461 --> 01:50:56,330
the sort.
Shock has looked at this very carefully.

1943
01:50:56,750 --> 01:51:01,750
It would be as much work to pound the 
stone into into powder and then put it 

1944
01:51:04,131 --> 01:51:09,131
into molds and you see the stones are 
all different sizes so you can't do it 

1945
01:51:09,131 --> 01:51:13,080
that way and when you look at the stones
you see at the,

1946
01:51:13,220 --> 01:51:16,610
at the blocks that what's called a new 
analytic limestone,

1947
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:19,460
which has lots of little seashells in 
it.

1948
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:24,700
Looking like the shelves.
I'm going to let cockle shells and 

1949
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:24,700
they're all intact,
so it's.

1950
01:51:25,550 --> 01:51:30,550
It's a silly theory and on the surface 
it doesn't sound on the surface.

1951
01:51:32,190 --> 01:51:34,210
It sounds as though it might be 
convincing,

1952
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:35,920
it was convincing enough so that 
somebody,

1953
01:51:35,921 --> 01:51:40,921
a friend of mine put together a panel of
geologists who don't have an ax to 

1954
01:51:40,921 --> 01:51:42,040
grind.
It's not as though there,

1955
01:51:42,330 --> 01:51:46,310
it's not as though they're egyptologists
are archeologists who have,

1956
01:51:46,311 --> 01:51:46,860
uh,
you know,

1957
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:51,900
have a stake in the thing.
They go there with an open mind to look 

1958
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:51,900
into it.
And shock certainly does.

1959
01:51:52,220 --> 01:51:52,690
I'm,
no,

1960
01:51:52,700 --> 01:51:53,690
it's not,
they're not.

1961
01:51:53,691 --> 01:51:56,060
And it wouldn't be juSt as much work to 
do it when they're good,

1962
01:51:56,080 --> 01:52:01,080
it's the self says it will take a month 
to produce a limestone blocks and cure 

1963
01:52:03,291 --> 01:52:05,600
it well enough so that you could 
actually use it.

1964
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:07,850
so no,
it's not.

1965
01:52:07,950 --> 01:52:09,570
So it's just silliness.

1966
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:12,350
well,
that's incorrect and correct.

1967
01:52:13,010 --> 01:52:17,670
Some things,
some things as silly and then see the,

1968
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:22,800
the alternative side of the argument is 
as irresponsible as the academic side,

1969
01:52:24,981 --> 01:52:29,981
because people get notions in their head
that it's all built by alien could be 

1970
01:52:29,981 --> 01:52:30,280
built.
My audience.

1971
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:35,290
I can't disprove that but,
but there is unwilling to let go of 

1972
01:52:36,531 --> 01:52:41,531
their fantasies as the academics are 
unwilling to let go of what are not 

1973
01:52:42,410 --> 01:52:44,940
fantasies.
But other times when they're incorrect,

1974
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:50,770
incorrectly develop theories has been 
that all being in I've been round,

1975
01:52:52,701 --> 01:52:57,140
solidly disproved like people like 
ourselves.

1976
01:52:57,330 --> 01:52:57,910
No,
john,

1977
01:52:57,940 --> 01:53:00,850
there's also an issue with the area 
underneath.

1978
01:53:00,851 --> 01:53:05,851
One of the sphinx is pause that a 
seismic charting has revealed that 

1979
01:53:07,481 --> 01:53:09,020
there's some sort of a,
um,

1980
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,570
uh,
a room down there,

1981
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:11,460
some sort of a,

1982
01:53:12,070 --> 01:53:15,870
there is some sort of in the cavity or 
chamber we don't know.

1983
01:53:16,110 --> 01:53:17,580
I mean,
and edgar casey,

1984
01:53:18,230 --> 01:53:20,190
one of his,
one of his channels,

1985
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:22,560
sessions of transits,
whatever he called him,

1986
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:24,920
said that,
not the,

1987
01:53:25,490 --> 01:53:30,490
it was a chamber beneath this,
one of the eight different descriptions 

1988
01:53:30,490 --> 01:53:34,701
of it,
but basically underneath one of the 

1989
01:53:34,701 --> 01:53:35,610
flaws of the strengths that contained 
the secrets of atlantis.

1990
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,230
Now our seismograph tells us that there 
is,

1991
01:53:41,330 --> 01:53:42,720
that,
there is a cavity there.

1992
01:53:43,260 --> 01:53:45,180
But,
and this is a question that comes up all

1993
01:53:45,181 --> 01:53:47,250
the time,
um,

1994
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:50,100
and they say,
why can't they excavate?

1995
01:53:50,101 --> 01:53:55,101
Well,
we're the geophysicists to did this work

1996
01:53:56,081 --> 01:54:01,081
of in shock was there,
but we didn't get named becky who's a 

1997
01:54:01,081 --> 01:54:01,240
geophysicist,
you know,

1998
01:54:01,290 --> 01:54:04,210
who does the,
it's like an underground radiologists,

1999
01:54:04,230 --> 01:54:04,750
you know,
the,

2000
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:09,760
the seismograph reading that to you or 
me would be completely meaningless,

2001
01:54:10,830 --> 01:54:12,990
like an x ray was meaningless to you or 
made,

2002
01:54:13,350 --> 01:54:18,350
but the radiologist continue a lot of 
very precise information from an x ray.

2003
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:22,110
So with,
uh,

2004
01:54:22,170 --> 01:54:25,700
with a readout from the seismograph and,
and,

2005
01:54:25,960 --> 01:54:27,690
and the,
the,

2006
01:54:27,691 --> 01:54:30,840
uh,
tom to becky sent from this,

2007
01:54:30,870 --> 01:54:34,080
from the shape of the,
of the read out.

2008
01:54:34,890 --> 01:54:39,540
It looks as though it is a chamber more 
or less rectangular.

2009
01:54:39,541 --> 01:54:43,300
It's under about 15 feet of bedrock on 
top of that.

2010
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:46,920
Um,
and there is actually a chamber with tom

2011
01:54:46,921 --> 01:54:50,520
didn't even know about behind the spanx,
a rough cut chamber.

2012
01:54:50,521 --> 01:54:55,470
There's a block and you pull a block 
away and a little rope ladder.

2013
01:54:55,471 --> 01:54:59,100
You can go down into this rough cut 
chamber where there's nothing and nobody

2014
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:02,430
had been able to figure out who caught 
it or why or when.

2015
01:55:02,910 --> 01:55:05,850
But there is such chamber there.
And on the,

2016
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:11,870
on the seismograph readout,
the this looks the same.

2017
01:55:13,111 --> 01:55:18,111
In other words,
they get certain colors and stuff like 

2018
01:55:18,111 --> 01:55:20,001
that.
It looks the same as what you get under 

2019
01:55:20,001 --> 01:55:22,290
the sink.
So the becky who put his neck on the 

2020
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:22,290
line said,
well,

2021
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:26,511
this looks like consciously like there 
is a chamber there.

2022
01:55:26,791 --> 01:55:31,791
The problem is getting in there because 
it's below what's now the water level,

2023
01:55:34,711 --> 01:55:39,711
the water table level.
So you can't really excavate or you 

2024
01:55:39,711 --> 01:55:40,490
would be an enormously difficult.

2025
01:55:40,570 --> 01:55:43,710
I go under water actually.
You go under water,

2026
01:55:43,711 --> 01:55:44,040
you mean

2027
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,840
as you drill?
I do a dig into it.

2028
01:55:45,841 --> 01:55:47,070
You would actually go under water.

2029
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:51,720
In theory you could flip down one of 
those little fiber optic cameras,

2030
01:55:51,721 --> 01:55:56,721
but if it's all water in there,
you're not going to see anything anyway 

2031
01:55:56,721 --> 01:56:00,300
to actually excavate it would mean going
in there with,

2032
01:56:00,340 --> 01:56:02,610
you know,
with huge pumps pulling the water out as

2033
01:56:02,611 --> 01:56:06,790
fast as it came in.
And this thing says the stinks

2034
01:56:07,180 --> 01:56:08,500
be almost impossible.
Right?

2035
01:56:09,130 --> 01:56:11,470
I'm the sphinx is.
It would be possible,

2036
01:56:11,471 --> 01:56:13,450
but it would be dangerous because the 
sinks,

2037
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:16,150
as you know,
it was in pretty rough shape as it is.

2038
01:56:16,151 --> 01:56:18,270
I meaN,
pieces fall off that all the time,

2039
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:22,570
things like that.
So it may be one of these days who knows

2040
01:56:22,571 --> 01:56:27,571
if the theory takes it takes root and 
the,

2041
01:56:30,580 --> 01:56:32,770
the uh,
you know,

2042
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:37,800
the powers that they realize that it's 
not good pr among other things to try to

2043
01:56:39,671 --> 01:56:42,070
excavate it and see if there is anything
there.

2044
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:47,820
Meanwhile for me,
I'll stick with the geology and the 

2045
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:47,820
other pieces of evidence.
I don't,

2046
01:56:48,120 --> 01:56:50,440
I don't give an awful lot of thought to 
that,

2047
01:56:50,441 --> 01:56:53,260
but the seismograph says there is 
something there.

2048
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:53,680
Yes.

2049
01:56:53,790 --> 01:56:57,920
Have they detected any other 
undiscovered ruins or any undiscovered?

2050
01:56:57,921 --> 01:56:58,480
Uh,
I mean,

2051
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:01,890
areas that they Would like to explore in
Egypt.

2052
01:57:01,891 --> 01:57:04,380
Are they,
do they pretty much have the entire area

2053
01:57:04,381 --> 01:57:05,130
mapped out?

2054
01:57:08,370 --> 01:57:13,000
Well,
they have a complex question.

2055
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:17,730
I haven't pretty well mapped out because
that I recently,

2056
01:57:17,731 --> 01:57:19,800
I forget the woman's name very 
interesting.

2057
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:26,900
The satellites flying over a gun.
I'm not sure if it's infrared or 

2058
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:32,360
something that gives you,
I think it's infrared photography 

2059
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:35,130
without that tells you if there's 
something underground,

2060
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:40,700
but the photography only goes,
doesn't go that deep,

2061
01:57:41,270 --> 01:57:42,030
you know,
it goes 10,

2062
01:57:42,031 --> 01:57:44,600
15 feet something I think.
And,

2063
01:57:45,790 --> 01:57:47,700
and if,
if we're correct,

2064
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:51,810
if there is anything that's really 
completely buried,

2065
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:56,240
um,
it will be deeper than that and,

2066
01:57:56,500 --> 01:57:58,560
and celebrate.
So the photographer,

2067
01:57:58,650 --> 01:58:00,840
the infrared,
whatever it is,

2068
01:58:00,841 --> 01:58:04,950
I think in the infrared,
doesn't let him know about that,

2069
01:58:05,010 --> 01:58:06,310
but it ought to be there.
I mean,

2070
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:08,190
look what the spanx.
For example,

2071
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:11,340
if the head we're not sticking above the
ground,

2072
01:58:11,910 --> 01:58:13,920
you wouldn't even know about it to this 
day.

2073
01:58:15,770 --> 01:58:16,610
Yeah,
it's true,

2074
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:17,060
right?

2075
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:18,730
Yeah.
But you wouldn't know.

2076
01:58:18,940 --> 01:58:21,400
It was just being sad.
And then why would anyone bother?

2077
01:58:22,030 --> 01:58:23,700
But the,
with,

2078
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:28,830
with these different new technologies,
certainly ground penetrating radar and 

2079
01:58:28,830 --> 01:58:30,670
seismographs will tell you if there's 
anything there,

2080
01:58:30,710 --> 01:58:35,710
but they're expensive and not.
You've got thousands of miles of desert 

2081
01:58:36,070 --> 01:58:40,750
and this is a slow process.
Whereas a flyover tells you a lot.

2082
01:58:40,751 --> 01:58:42,670
Something.
Know that there's,

2083
01:58:43,530 --> 01:58:44,500
that.
There's that,

2084
01:58:44,501 --> 01:58:49,501
there are lots of varied sites,
but if they're that close to the 

2085
01:58:49,501 --> 01:58:50,560
surface,
the chances that they,

2086
01:58:51,070 --> 01:58:55,660
that they're going to,
they're going to support the ancient,

2087
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:57,160
you know,
what we call it,

2088
01:58:57,161 --> 01:59:02,161
a lost civilization.
Hypothesis was not necessarily 

2089
01:59:02,621 --> 01:59:06,700
commanding and from art for our 
purposes,

2090
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:11,740
it doesn't even matter because we have,
we have enough to go by anyway.

2091
01:59:11,741 --> 01:59:16,741
I mean go back tap night and probably 
this easter island stuff and the magical

2092
01:59:17,411 --> 01:59:20,010
bracelet and certain of the other things
there,

2093
01:59:20,140 --> 01:59:25,140
a megalithic sites in sardinia,
which I'm not to be believed and nobody 

2094
01:59:25,301 --> 01:59:26,540
even knows about this.

2095
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:32,150
A treasure trove of megalithic sites.
So I didn't,

2096
01:59:32,151 --> 01:59:32,680
you know.
Yeah,

2097
01:59:32,690 --> 01:59:37,690
they didn't just invent sardines.
This as this wonderful architecture 

2098
01:59:37,811 --> 01:59:42,811
there,
these huge beehive shaped stone 

2099
01:59:42,811 --> 01:59:44,890
buildings that are really amazing.
So we don't need that.

2100
01:59:44,891 --> 01:59:47,140
All we need is the,
all we need is the,

2101
01:59:47,650 --> 01:59:51,780
is the financing to do our,
to,

2102
01:59:51,980 --> 01:59:52,980
you know,
to do our,

2103
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:53,790
our,
our,

2104
01:59:53,930 --> 01:59:58,930
our,
our followup to the mystery of the 

2105
01:59:58,930 --> 01:59:58,930
slangs.
And ideally what we want to do really is

2106
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:02,860
to get it into the theaters and then go 
into tv.

2107
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:04,990
And uh,
and um,

2108
02:00:05,630 --> 02:00:07,830
you know,
in the web and all of that stuff,

2109
02:00:07,930 --> 02:00:08,000
right?

2110
02:00:08,110 --> 02:00:11,530
Well you see if something has a high 
impact,

2111
02:00:11,531 --> 02:00:16,531
but if you see a lot of the video,
like viral videos that have been 

2112
02:00:16,531 --> 02:00:21,001
released online that have gotten 
millions and millions and millions of 

2113
02:00:21,001 --> 02:00:25,530
viewers just by word of mouth,
I really think that video on demand as 

2114
02:00:25,530 --> 02:00:26,950
well as a,
as another great option.

2115
02:00:29,390 --> 02:00:31,100
Yeah,
it is a great option.

2116
02:00:32,330 --> 02:00:34,610
The problem of course is,
as you must know this,

2117
02:00:34,990 --> 02:00:36,390
I mean,
do you have ads on,

2118
02:00:36,590 --> 02:00:37,190
on the show?

2119
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:38,070
Yeah,
we do.

2120
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:40,650
Yeah.
The ones that we know,

2121
02:00:40,930 --> 02:00:45,930
you don't see any ads,
we just do them at the beginning of the 

2122
02:00:45,930 --> 02:00:45,930
broadcast,
but the fleshlight add on the,

2123
02:00:45,930 --> 02:00:48,890
on it,
the nootropics ad does.

2124
02:00:48,970 --> 02:00:51,090
Those are the ones that we do.
We do those and that's it.

2125
02:00:51,091 --> 02:00:56,091
And then we have some,
there's some other sponsors that we're 

2126
02:00:56,091 --> 02:00:56,760
working with in the near future,
but they're all done just by me talking.

2127
02:00:56,860 --> 02:00:58,170
Okay.
Really?

2128
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:01,080
I mean because I'm blabbering on here 
forever and there's no ads.

2129
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:02,290
No,
we don't have to have ads.

2130
02:01:02,291 --> 02:01:03,820
We don't have to break any of the 
conversation now.

2131
02:01:03,850 --> 02:01:06,460
That's the beautiful thing about it.
We get it over with him beginning.

2132
02:01:06,670 --> 02:01:11,670
We mentioned the the.
We thank the sponsors again at the end 

2133
02:01:11,670 --> 02:01:14,281
and it'll allows a full two hour 
intensive conversation and especially 

2134
02:01:14,281 --> 02:01:17,260
something about ancient Egypt I think 
demands that it's such a.

2135
02:01:17,261 --> 02:01:22,261
It's such a complex sort of a situation 
to try to figure out how the 

2136
02:01:22,261 --> 02:01:25,630
conventional wisdom is saying that when,
when did they believe languages invented

2137
02:01:25,631 --> 02:01:26,770
about 50,000
years ago,

2138
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:28,000
something along those lines.

2139
02:01:28,300 --> 02:01:30,210
They don't even know.
Just guesswork.

2140
02:01:30,211 --> 02:01:35,211
Right.
It really is guesswork when you get 

2141
02:01:35,211 --> 02:01:37,851
back.
That's the only thing that you couldn't 

2142
02:01:37,851 --> 02:01:40,191
see couldn't say as a trend is that the 
more they study,

2143
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:48,040
the further back everything goes and not
only the further back in terms of time 

2144
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:52,980
with a further back in time in terms of 
sophistication and see.

2145
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:57,020
I mean actually look,
go beckley cafe,

2146
02:01:57,920 --> 02:01:59,720
which is.
I mean I hope,

2147
02:02:00,110 --> 02:02:05,110
I hope you find some photos to or I'll 
send them to you so to intersperse with 

2148
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:10,570
with this talk so that people can 
actually see what else?

2149
02:02:10,630 --> 02:02:15,630
Well,
I think a lot of people google along 

2150
02:02:15,630 --> 02:02:17,531
with the show,
so that's probably what a lot of people 

2151
02:02:17,531 --> 02:02:17,531
are doing right now,
but go back

2152
02:02:17,531 --> 02:02:17,531
still if that's.
Oh,

2153
02:02:17,531 --> 02:02:18,670
that's fine too.
So,

2154
02:02:19,090 --> 02:02:22,930
so I mean with god beckley tat they were
talking about 10,000

2155
02:02:22,931 --> 02:02:27,931
bc now you know,
that's five times the span of time from 

2156
02:02:28,661 --> 02:02:32,270
jesus and julius caesar to us.
Pretty crazy.

2157
02:02:33,850 --> 02:02:35,680
That's pretty crazy.
Wrap your head around that

2158
02:02:36,030 --> 02:02:36,850
show.
Day.

2159
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:40,510
The cave that she'll bang.
That's $30,000.

2160
02:02:40,720 --> 02:02:44,830
That's three times the time from going 
back from attempt.

2161
02:02:45,730 --> 02:02:50,730
So you'll see it means that we have this
totally skewed vision of our human 

2162
02:02:53,321 --> 02:02:56,370
civilization and of ourselves basically,
you know,

2163
02:02:56,620 --> 02:02:59,080
it's fucking lunatic.
Asylum is not,

2164
02:02:59,410 --> 02:03:02,980
it's not civilization.
Who in their right mind would invent the

2165
02:03:02,981 --> 02:03:07,981
bobble head doll put on american idol or
the reality shows this is insanity.

2166
02:03:12,190 --> 02:03:17,190
It isn't insanity,
but it's a channel a division achieved 

2167
02:03:17,190 --> 02:03:17,800
and incredibly high technological level 
of success.

2168
02:03:18,490 --> 02:03:23,490
We,
it seems to be a technology of a 

2169
02:03:23,490 --> 02:03:24,280
civilization as opposed to what Egypt 
was,

2170
02:03:24,610 --> 02:03:26,980
which was we don't know.

2171
02:03:27,550 --> 02:03:32,550
That's what makes traveling there so 
interesting because they also had a 

2172
02:03:32,550 --> 02:03:37,411
technology,
I mean in certain cases we couldn't 

2173
02:03:37,411 --> 02:03:41,160
build the pyramids or maybe we could,
but it would would probably be more 

2174
02:03:43,001 --> 02:03:48,001
expensive than a than a space program 
and they did it evidently with these

2175
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:55,560
and they did it in an era where we don't
even attribute them to having metal 

2176
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:58,951
tools.
They had bras that are not even the 

2177
02:03:58,951 --> 02:03:58,951
hopper

2178
02:03:58,951 --> 02:04:00,830
and you say,
I don't know,

2179
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:06,350
to me there's not much emotional impact 
from the bottle.

2180
02:04:06,351 --> 02:04:11,351
Had dull where disney land for that 
matter and if you walk into the egyptian

2181
02:04:14,481 --> 02:04:19,481
temples and then this happens on the 
trips all the time because I just said 

2182
02:04:19,481 --> 02:04:22,850
it's like sex.
You don't tell you the experience that 

2183
02:04:22,850 --> 02:04:22,850
you really don't know.
Let us,

2184
02:04:22,850 --> 02:04:27,491
like we go into these temples and on my 
trips now it's easy business practically

2185
02:04:28,791 --> 02:04:33,791
notes or isn't there?
But otherwise I go to a lot of trouble 

2186
02:04:33,791 --> 02:04:36,941
to figure out when to go to places.
So the relatively people in there,

2187
02:04:38,650 --> 02:04:39,820
because it's important,
you know,

2188
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:44,840
I mean it's like trying to listen to 
beethoven's ninth symphony and in the 

2189
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:46,390
super bowl you can't do this.
Um,

2190
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:49,770
so if you get there and you have 
replaced more or less to yourself,

2191
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:55,310
the emotional impact of these things is,
is Breathtaking and I felt bad.

2192
02:04:56,810 --> 02:05:00,300
You don't get that from walmart's.
No,

2193
02:05:00,330 --> 02:05:05,330
obviously not just garbage that goes on.
It's just a faCt that are obsessed with 

2194
02:05:07,561 --> 02:05:12,270
technological rubbish and violence.
So of course we stupid vitamins.

2195
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:16,010
Our setup is obviously very different 
than theirs,

2196
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:18,540
but we imagine ourselves to be the more 
advanced.

2197
02:05:18,930 --> 02:05:21,690
It just that they don't have tv.
So we were like,

2198
02:05:21,691 --> 02:05:23,010
oh,
they were fucking idiots,

2199
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:25,050
you know,
they don't have the internet were like,

2200
02:05:25,051 --> 02:05:30,051
well they were an advanced,
but meanwhile they're capable of these 

2201
02:05:30,051 --> 02:05:33,920
massive constructions.
I wanted to ask you about the 

2202
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:34,110
sarcophagus in the king's chamber and 
the,

2203
02:05:34,111 --> 02:05:39,111
the evidence that it had been made with 
some sort of a high speed diamond bit 

2204
02:05:39,111 --> 02:05:39,120
drill.

2205
02:05:39,890 --> 02:05:41,160
Well that's,
that's,

2206
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:45,210
that's kristen's theory that we talked 
about.

2207
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:48,420
I mentioned kristen before.
Well we don't know.

2208
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:51,480
Chris has seen.
Chris has to be,

2209
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:57,570
he's not a new age for my his stepson,
let's talk to that.

2210
02:05:57,580 --> 02:06:02,580
It's very good composer and he was 
talking about all of the new age music 

2211
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:07,050
and and the the album covers and he said
it's all a bunch of airbrushed unicorns 

2212
02:06:07,050 --> 02:06:12,020
and that's become a metaphor,
but you don't have to the far out new 

2213
02:06:13,021 --> 02:06:16,230
age kind of way of looking at bad 
things,

2214
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:21,680
but chris is not a nEw age kind of guy 
and that's his field and he know he 

2215
02:06:26,551 --> 02:06:31,551
interprets it that way except as no.
With all of the stuff that we've 

2216
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:36,240
discovered in Egypt,
there's no evidence whatsoever of having

2217
02:06:36,241 --> 02:06:37,950
that kind of technology.

2218
02:06:38,030 --> 02:06:41,810
Now this,
the idea of the lost civilization is the

2219
02:06:41,811 --> 02:06:44,820
idea that graham hanCock's idea that you
know,

2220
02:06:44,900 --> 02:06:49,900
there's.
There's a missing error that we can't 

2221
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:49,900
place.
When.

2222
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:52,520
When do you belIeve that took place in 
relation to the timeline of Egypt?

2223
02:06:52,730 --> 02:06:57,730
When was all the information or a good 
chunk of it last and they had to start 

2224
02:06:57,730 --> 02:06:57,860
from scratch?

2225
02:06:58,260 --> 02:07:03,260
Well,
we don't know because you see there's 

2226
02:07:03,260 --> 02:07:04,860
enough.
They're not lots with scattered around 

2227
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:06,750
so that you can say maybe it was never 
lost.

2228
02:07:06,780 --> 02:07:11,430
The was never manifested in this 
spectacular architecture.

2229
02:07:11,730 --> 02:07:15,120
For example,
I was telling me before about the,

2230
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:20,160
the red pyramid of does.
Sure that's built over a ruinous 

2231
02:07:20,190 --> 02:07:25,190
negativistic structure,
but that megalithic structure is pretty 

2232
02:07:25,190 --> 02:07:26,220
considerable.
It's sort of like new grange and certain

2233
02:07:26,221 --> 02:07:27,210
of the,
of the,

2234
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:31,680
of the megalithic structures in england 
and scotland and wales,

2235
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:33,990
but you know,
this is not nothing.

2236
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:39,380
and then this strange stone circle,
pretty ruinous called supplier and a b 

2237
02:07:44,311 --> 02:07:47,180
t,
a p l a y in,

2238
02:07:47,870 --> 02:07:52,750
in south western Egypt,
west of abu simbel.

2239
02:07:53,100 --> 02:07:56,680
I'm not far from the,
from the Sudan border.

2240
02:07:57,190 --> 02:08:00,340
Now this is,
it doesn't look like much,

2241
02:08:00,730 --> 02:08:05,730
but even the academics acknowledged that
it's astronomically oriented and there's

2242
02:08:05,771 --> 02:08:08,830
a lot about it that,
that,

2243
02:08:08,910 --> 02:08:10,150
that puts his date.

2244
02:08:10,540 --> 02:08:14,350
They dated,
they academics data to about 6,000

2245
02:08:14,351 --> 02:08:15,550
bc.
Well,

2246
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:21,000
astronomically oriented in 6,000
bc means already that it's investigated.

2247
02:08:22,070 --> 02:08:25,900
That's astronomy.
Not supposed to have this fun of me back

2248
02:08:25,901 --> 02:08:28,520
then.
And then is an interesting guy.

2249
02:08:28,521 --> 02:08:31,230
He's a friend of mine and physicists 
and,

2250
02:08:31,360 --> 02:08:36,360
and um,
archeo astronomer who looks at the 

2251
02:08:36,360 --> 02:08:39,841
evidence and interpret it,
interprets it in a much more 

2252
02:08:39,841 --> 02:08:42,821
sophisticated ignatian that there,
there are indications there were at 

2253
02:08:42,821 --> 02:08:47,341
least there they are referring back to a
time of about $16,000

2254
02:08:49,551 --> 02:08:50,320
or so,
bc,

2255
02:08:50,321 --> 02:08:55,321
even though the sun circle itself 
satisfactorily dates to about 6,000

2256
02:08:56,351 --> 02:08:57,820
bc.
And then we go to the,

2257
02:08:57,821 --> 02:09:01,300
go back leads epi and we'd go to the 
bracelet and I were talking 10,000

2258
02:09:01,301 --> 02:09:03,910
bc and the bracelet,
we're talking 8,000

2259
02:09:03,911 --> 02:09:05,710
bc and it shows,
hey,

2260
02:09:05,711 --> 02:09:09,020
these fabulous paintings of horses and 
rhinoceros.

2261
02:09:09,021 --> 02:09:13,000
This isn't a bears and lions.
That's 31,000

2262
02:09:13,001 --> 02:09:16,330
bc.
So how much do you need?

2263
02:09:16,331 --> 02:09:18,040
No,
they're probably living in tents.

2264
02:09:18,041 --> 02:09:23,041
I dunno.
I mean they certainly weren't living in 

2265
02:09:23,041 --> 02:09:25,381
condos but.
But they had this knowledge and this 

2266
02:09:25,381 --> 02:09:29,750
artistry at their disposal and they had 
it out a fantastically early time.

2267
02:09:30,900 --> 02:09:33,300
So we just don't know when they lost all
this stuff.

2268
02:09:33,330 --> 02:09:36,060
We don't know when the egyptian 
civilization either,

2269
02:09:36,061 --> 02:09:41,061
whether it was a slow erosion,
whether it was a massive decline and 

2270
02:09:41,061 --> 02:09:43,170
somehow or another it sort of coincides 
with the end of the last ice age.

2271
02:09:43,171 --> 02:09:44,670
Is that a.
Is that a fact as well?

2272
02:09:45,030 --> 02:09:48,190
Oh yeah.
Well we think yes.

2273
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:53,700
Because that's when the sea levels rose 
300 seat and I mean it's,

2274
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:58,740
it's a chaotic time then that's when all
of the madness and the will he run our 

2275
02:09:58,740 --> 02:10:00,640
services and all that,
have that go extinct.

2276
02:10:00,970 --> 02:10:05,970
So and shark actually have some very 
interesting,

2277
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:11,400
very interesting theories about not just
shot and other people about what made it

2278
02:10:11,621 --> 02:10:14,620
go extinct and you know,
maybe some sort of a plasma strike,

2279
02:10:14,621 --> 02:10:19,621
like a gigantic,
some type of event is pretty good 

2280
02:10:19,621 --> 02:10:20,510
evidence for this.
But anyway,

2281
02:10:22,430 --> 02:10:24,800
it disappears.
the sinks,

2282
02:10:24,940 --> 02:10:28,150
the sinks and go back to happy maybe 
after that.

2283
02:10:28,151 --> 02:10:32,650
But if this links is earlier,
one of the,

2284
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:36,740
one of the objections we always had the 
nice,

2285
02:10:36,741 --> 02:10:41,741
well how could this be the evidence of 
this amazing early civilization and 

2286
02:10:41,741 --> 02:10:42,410
there's nothing else.
well,

2287
02:10:42,411 --> 02:10:44,960
there is something else.
There's lots of other stuff.

2288
02:10:45,110 --> 02:10:47,290
A lot of weathering and things of that 
nature and nature,

2289
02:10:47,690 --> 02:10:48,960
but not,
not much of it.

2290
02:10:48,970 --> 02:10:51,520
Spectacular.
Go back to the tap tap.

2291
02:10:51,890 --> 02:10:54,710
That's spectacular.
So we don't know.

2292
02:10:54,830 --> 02:10:59,830
Are there hieroglyphs that detail?
Any of the construction methods that 

2293
02:10:59,830 --> 02:11:00,200
were used

2294
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:02,680
a little bit?
Um,

2295
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:04,840
there's,
there's one,

2296
02:11:05,680 --> 02:11:10,680
there's one wall reliefs in nothing to 
do with pyramids.

2297
02:11:11,500 --> 02:11:14,890
Know absolutely nothing and nothing to 
do with these things.

2298
02:11:14,920 --> 02:11:18,910
I mean the egyptians disks,
we are blessed.

2299
02:11:20,210 --> 02:11:25,210
Nothing spectacular too.
That's something a lot of people aren't 

2300
02:11:25,210 --> 02:11:25,360
even aware of.
How spectacular those are.

2301
02:11:25,950 --> 02:11:27,490
Well,
there are plenty of spectacular.

2302
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:32,040
There's one relief in the temple.
Eventful,

2303
02:11:32,520 --> 02:11:37,230
which is a very late ptolemaic sample of
between 250 vc,

2304
02:11:37,950 --> 02:11:39,630
you know,
into roman times,

2305
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:44,840
built in stages that shows the pharaoh 
with a rope around an obelisk sort of 

2306
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:51,920
pulling it up into position by himself.
That's not meant to be taken literally,

2307
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:56,840
unless it's a very small obsolescence,
but it needs to say is like it gets.

2308
02:11:56,841 --> 02:12:01,841
So when you see evidence,
I don't necessarily like stare in there 

2309
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:07,050
on the temple walls.
Love.

2310
02:12:07,051 --> 02:12:12,051
You can't really ignore it just because 
you want to believe that the aliens 

2311
02:12:12,051 --> 02:12:15,561
built everything.
So there's the pharaoh pulling the 

2312
02:12:15,821 --> 02:12:18,390
obelisk up when there's a theory 
developed.

2313
02:12:18,570 --> 02:12:21,180
It's the one favored by the politics at 
the moment.

2314
02:12:21,181 --> 02:12:23,610
I mean even they can't be wrong all the 
time.

2315
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:29,180
And a bio needs of technologists named a
lobbying.

2316
02:12:30,790 --> 02:12:31,740
She,
um,

2317
02:12:32,700 --> 02:12:36,780
which talks about how they take these 
obelisks which way?

2318
02:12:36,780 --> 02:12:40,080
Hundreds of tons.
They somehow get them out of the quarry.

2319
02:12:40,290 --> 02:12:43,290
This is really in words,
it doesn't make any sense.

2320
02:12:43,350 --> 02:12:45,840
When we were in Egypt and you're at 
what's called,

2321
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:49,800
it's called the unfinished obelisk in 
aswan,

2322
02:12:50,100 --> 02:12:55,100
and here's this block of stone that were
pulling out of the rock and they didn't 

2323
02:12:55,100 --> 02:12:57,240
make it for interesting reasons that 
develop the fault line,

2324
02:12:57,780 --> 02:13:01,380
but had they got this block of stone out
of the bedrock,

2325
02:13:01,710 --> 02:13:05,790
it would've weighed 1200 tons.
That's a big stone.

2326
02:13:06,180 --> 02:13:11,180
And somehow in fact,
they've got an out of the quarry and 

2327
02:13:11,180 --> 02:13:14,660
onto rafts or boats probably in the 
flood season and drifted down.

2328
02:13:16,501 --> 02:13:18,540
Denial.
Maybe the luxor,

2329
02:13:18,541 --> 02:13:23,541
who knows?
We don't know where it was intended to 

2330
02:13:23,541 --> 02:13:25,761
go and then they would have somehow or 
another had to get it up into position 

2331
02:13:26,430 --> 02:13:30,990
and according to the lobbying,
they did this by pulling it up,

2332
02:13:31,070 --> 02:13:36,070
gigantic ramp and it was set up in such 
a way that with a kind of a no,

2333
02:13:39,950 --> 02:13:44,950
the up the ramp that would come up to 
the ramp with the with this bottom at 

2334
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:49,821
the top part and then gradually with 
lots of people with ropes and you'd be 

2335
02:13:50,130 --> 02:13:55,130
surprised how how precise you can be 
with lots of trained men with ropes and 

2336
02:13:57,061 --> 02:14:01,260
they would gradually pull it up and and 
it would go.

2337
02:14:02,580 --> 02:14:07,580
There was a kind of a deep shaft that 
was constructed that was full of sand 

2338
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:11,070
and they'd gradually pull the sand up 
from under and all of these guys pulling

2339
02:14:11,230 --> 02:14:14,850
the ropes gradually leave your up into 
position.

2340
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:20,550
Very exactly.
Place it down on his base,

2341
02:14:21,360 --> 02:14:23,550
but how they get the sand out the last 
minute.

2342
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:25,920
When you're there.
All of this makes sense,

2343
02:14:26,130 --> 02:14:30,270
but it's.
It's fascinating to try to figure out if

2344
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:32,930
this is how it's done.
We don't know,

2345
02:14:33,370 --> 02:14:38,370
but the whole be concise,
like did it and it's pretty damn 

2346
02:14:38,370 --> 02:14:38,370
amazing.

2347
02:14:38,370 --> 02:14:42,170
Well,
one of the things I thought was really 

2348
02:14:42,170 --> 02:14:43,611
fascinating was when they had to move 
some gigantic statues,

2349
02:14:44,101 --> 02:14:48,030
they had to cut them up and then replace
them in a new area.

2350
02:14:48,390 --> 02:14:48,900
They,
uh,

2351
02:14:48,901 --> 02:14:52,050
they had to like cut giant statues in 
half.

2352
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:57,080
I mean,
talk about that in incredible project 

2353
02:14:57,080 --> 02:14:58,440
and what you thought about that just 
from an archaeological standpoint.

2354
02:14:58,540 --> 02:14:59,920
That's,
that's abu simbel.

2355
02:15:00,340 --> 02:15:02,020
and it wasn't,
it was statues.

2356
02:15:02,440 --> 02:15:07,440
They were,
this is a temple cut into the rock face 

2357
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:11,730
and the four statues of ramesses,
the second were sculpted into the rock 

2358
02:15:13,481 --> 02:15:14,800
face itself.
In other words,

2359
02:15:14,801 --> 02:15:17,320
they were integral.
It will not freestanding statutes.

2360
02:15:17,680 --> 02:15:22,680
So when they built the aswan dam and 
they would have flooded this fabulous 

2361
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:26,140
place,
they got together a whole bunch of money

2362
02:15:26,141 --> 02:15:27,190
and $90,
million dollars,

2363
02:15:27,191 --> 02:15:32,191
I think it was.
Unesco got it together and they got all 

2364
02:15:32,191 --> 02:15:36,160
of the engineers and what they to do is 
they had to basically,

2365
02:15:36,161 --> 02:15:41,161
they had to move a whole so they have to
cut around the temple and then they have

2366
02:15:43,001 --> 02:15:45,710
to cut because the scratches enormous.
Sixty,

2367
02:15:45,760 --> 02:15:50,760
65 feet high and then they had to cut 
them into four and move the blocks 

2368
02:15:51,041 --> 02:15:56,041
because they moved the entire.
They moved the whole up to the top of 

2369
02:15:56,041 --> 02:15:56,380
the hill.

2370
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:01,800
Where were they were they were built 
into because the water would have 

2371
02:16:03,580 --> 02:16:06,810
covered where they were.
So that's,

2372
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:08,740
that's abu simbel.
And so yeah,

2373
02:16:08,741 --> 02:16:10,850
they have to cut,
but they weren't freestanding.

2374
02:16:10,870 --> 02:16:12,480
snatches,
but still it was a modern,

2375
02:16:12,481 --> 02:16:17,481
you know,
it was a pretty considerable modern 

2376
02:16:17,481 --> 02:16:17,481
engineering thing.
Otherwise.

2377
02:16:17,481 --> 02:16:18,340
Otherwise,
an example,

2378
02:16:18,341 --> 02:16:23,341
there's the statue of the colossal 
figure of abram says that's the basis of

2379
02:16:24,071 --> 02:16:29,071
shelly's famous poem ozymandias no,
I met a traveler from an land,

2380
02:16:29,750 --> 02:16:30,430
blah,
blah blah.

2381
02:16:31,060 --> 02:16:34,750
And this is the statute that ways it 
ruined.

2382
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:41,180
It exploded in an earthquake somewhere 
around julius caesar talk.

2383
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:45,670
But,
but this,

2384
02:16:45,730 --> 02:16:50,730
this originally weighed about 2000 tons 
and they got it down the river somehow.

2385
02:16:52,090 --> 02:16:56,980
And that's amazing enough,
but then I didn't get it off the boat.

2386
02:16:57,040 --> 02:17:00,850
In other words,
assuming that they're moving it in flood

2387
02:17:00,851 --> 02:17:05,851
season on giant rats,
then they've got to get the rafts.

2388
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:09,580
We've got to get this thousand ton block
off the raft.

2389
02:17:10,090 --> 02:17:13,930
Move it into place.
Well the actual moving it on the flat.

2390
02:17:14,230 --> 02:17:16,000
There are when you're talking about 
before,

2391
02:17:16,001 --> 02:17:21,001
what evidence is there,
there's one or two months from the tomb 

2392
02:17:21,001 --> 02:17:25,890
relief showing viewed sledge with the 
giant colossal statue of feral on it and

2393
02:17:29,171 --> 02:17:34,171
then lots and lots of men pulling the 
sledge over the over the land.

2394
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:37,360
When somebody in the front pouring 
something,

2395
02:17:37,361 --> 02:17:42,361
maybe some water cause slick mud 
actually is remarkably slippery and you 

2396
02:17:42,461 --> 02:17:44,500
can pull things up.
As I said earlier,

2397
02:17:44,590 --> 02:17:49,590
what you see is what you get.
You can't deny that evidence when you 

2398
02:17:49,590 --> 02:17:50,720
see the evidence in front of your nose 
and say,

2399
02:17:50,721 --> 02:17:54,980
oh well let's aliens dropping things 
from helicopters and stuff.

2400
02:17:56,840 --> 02:17:59,080
Then the evidence is there.
That's the evidence.

2401
02:17:59,470 --> 02:18:04,470
But you've got to be careful about the 
evidence of there are seeing symbols,

2402
02:18:05,110 --> 02:18:08,650
but look like alec up their template.
Bobby does,

2403
02:18:08,651 --> 02:18:11,800
but I'm not this complicated subject.

2404
02:18:13,290 --> 02:18:16,330
Yeah,
an incredibly complicated subject now,

2405
02:18:16,331 --> 02:18:21,331
or no,
no subject of ancient civilizations 

2406
02:18:21,331 --> 02:18:24,300
would be complete without a discussion 
of ancient sumeria and,

2407
02:18:24,301 --> 02:18:24,870
uh,
the,

2408
02:18:24,871 --> 02:18:28,500
the fantastical work of zachariah 
switching.

2409
02:18:28,501 --> 02:18:30,240
I'm sure you're familiar with all that 
stuff.

2410
02:18:30,270 --> 02:18:35,270
What's,
what's your take on zacharias hitchins 

2411
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:35,270
ideas that,
you know,

2412
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:37,920
the annunaki came from another planet 
for a lot of people don't know.

2413
02:18:37,921 --> 02:18:42,921
it's some pretty crazy stuff that states
that human beings were created through 

2414
02:18:42,921 --> 02:18:44,340
genetic engineering and.

2415
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:45,770
Yeah.
Well,

2416
02:18:45,771 --> 02:18:49,480
I,
I think actually I'm not and,

2417
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:54,060
and I find when wouldn't sits in I,
I mean,

2418
02:18:54,320 --> 02:18:58,530
I can't challenge his translations from 
the,

2419
02:18:58,700 --> 02:19:00,850
from the sumerian.
Um,

2420
02:19:01,180 --> 02:19:02,090
it was,
I just can't,

2421
02:19:02,600 --> 02:19:07,600
but they're his translations and 
unfortunately are the best of my 

2422
02:19:08,421 --> 02:19:13,421
knowledge.
I don't know of any of the sumerian 

2423
02:19:13,421 --> 02:19:15,590
experts who bothered to take a look at 
his work,

2424
02:19:15,591 --> 02:19:16,700
which is too bad.
I mean,

2425
02:19:16,701 --> 02:19:21,701
it's irresponsible,
but I do know that when he's talking 

2426
02:19:21,701 --> 02:19:22,880
about Egypt,
he's totally off the wall.

2427
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Totally.
And from that I extrapolate and do not 

2428
02:19:28,581 --> 02:19:33,581
much care for his work.
And when he gets into explaining who the

2429
02:19:34,071 --> 02:19:35,980
gods were,
um,

2430
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:39,410
that they're,
they're alien,

2431
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:43,310
they're aliens,
as malignant is ourselves,

2432
02:19:43,311 --> 02:19:48,311
who enslaved the a primitive human 
rights created the gods of Egypt and 

2433
02:19:49,731 --> 02:19:54,731
everywhere else are really just aliens 
that have been misunderstood by 

2434
02:19:55,110 --> 02:20:00,110
primitive imaginations.
This is really stupid and malignant 

2435
02:20:00,110 --> 02:20:00,110
bullshit.

2436
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:06,360
Here's a bit of evidence that one of the
egyptian creation myths concerns that 

2437
02:20:07,570 --> 02:20:10,850
the god before there were any gods,
the god called attune,

2438
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:15,740
who exists before there is existence as 
it were,

2439
02:20:16,310 --> 02:20:20,480
and he creates existence through an act 
of masturbation.

2440
02:20:21,390 --> 02:20:25,790
He creates the first poll,
the first polarization,

2441
02:20:25,791 --> 02:20:29,780
the first female,
and the male is the biblical vests.

2442
02:20:30,200 --> 02:20:34,760
Well,
now This is an ancient alien,

2443
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:40,100
and this is a suction suction esque 
interpretation.

2444
02:20:40,430 --> 02:20:45,430
What is it that the primitives saw?
An ancient alien whacking off behind the

2445
02:20:47,871 --> 02:20:51,860
trade and decided that this was how the 
universe was created.

2446
02:20:52,670 --> 02:20:55,310
It has absolutely nothing to do with.
There's another words,

2447
02:20:55,670 --> 02:21:00,670
the gods of Egypt,
from the gods of all other 

2448
02:21:00,670 --> 02:21:03,011
civilizations,
including those in sometimes think 

2449
02:21:03,011 --> 02:21:03,440
primitive,
represent cosmic principles.

2450
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:06,590
They are not people,
they are not aliens.

2451
02:21:06,591 --> 02:21:11,591
They are principles and they are 
scientific scientists don't like this 

2452
02:21:11,591 --> 02:21:11,591
either,
but,

2453
02:21:11,591 --> 02:21:16,360
but when you look,
when you look at egyptian mythology and 

2454
02:21:17,151 --> 02:21:21,980
try to and try to historicize it as it 
were,

2455
02:21:22,340 --> 02:21:26,300
you flying the urine,
the urine,

2456
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:30,980
this is a ludicrous exercise and as far 
as I'm concerned,

2457
02:21:30,981 --> 02:21:35,450
the whole notion that we human beings to
creators,

2458
02:21:35,720 --> 02:21:38,730
not searching,
but some others did create the cathedral

2459
02:21:38,731 --> 02:21:43,731
of shotgun and the builders,
the temples of Egypt and so on or 

2460
02:21:43,731 --> 02:21:46,070
somehow or another diluted,
diluted,

2461
02:21:47,030 --> 02:21:52,030
primitive,
so were who were enslaved by aliens and 

2462
02:21:53,271 --> 02:21:56,450
who then found a way to set themselves 
free,

2463
02:21:56,660 --> 02:22:00,350
but remember they're alien backgrounds 
and commemorated them,

2464
02:22:00,351 --> 02:22:05,351
and all of this wonderful law contacted 
this is really stupid and not only is 

2465
02:22:05,351 --> 02:22:05,750
it's stupid,
it's,

2466
02:22:05,770 --> 02:22:08,870
it's malignant,
it's malignant in the same way,

2467
02:22:08,871 --> 02:22:11,870
it's the opposite of that sale.

2468
02:22:11,880 --> 02:22:15,200
Darwinian evolution,
which you know in other words,

2469
02:22:15,450 --> 02:22:20,450
have it.
It deprives human existence of all 

2470
02:22:21,320 --> 02:22:26,320
meaning,
and that's in fact what modern science 

2471
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:28,931
does.
Modern rational as science deprives us 

2472
02:22:28,931 --> 02:22:29,370
of any meaning in life,
and in fact,

2473
02:22:29,371 --> 02:22:31,080
they're very proud of it.
You should read some of this.

2474
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:36,340
Do you?
Do you contemplate how we were created 

2475
02:22:36,340 --> 02:22:39,331
or how we burst out from the lower 
hominids how there's all these other 

2476
02:22:39,331 --> 02:22:41,320
primates running around that we did not 
sure that we did.

2477
02:22:42,380 --> 02:22:45,800
No,
I think there's no evidence for that.

2478
02:22:45,801 --> 02:22:50,801
There are lower.
They were hominids and then there's us 

2479
02:22:50,801 --> 02:22:53,060
and the further back you go.
There we are again.

2480
02:22:53,090 --> 02:22:57,980
This is a situation ask stuff except 
it's called science that we have to have

2481
02:22:57,981 --> 02:23:02,981
had that we have to have had more and 
more primitive beings that were 

2482
02:23:04,011 --> 02:23:05,060
responsible,
you know,

2483
02:23:05,061 --> 02:23:09,320
that gradually became us being apes and 
became people.

2484
02:23:09,321 --> 02:23:12,750
And what do you think happened?
We are doing show day and go directly to

2485
02:23:12,760 --> 02:23:15,290
epic and the snakes and so on.
I don't live that.

2486
02:23:15,310 --> 02:23:17,890
Put two seconds actually actually 
shotgun.

2487
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:21,550
I high up on our list.
Um,

2488
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:23,700
in fact,
one of the reasons I got,

2489
02:23:24,470 --> 02:23:27,710
I got onto the floor.
He did a lot of times.

2490
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:33,110
Um,
funny story that call I got hold of 

2491
02:23:33,110 --> 02:23:36,641
shock because I developed the,
I developed the strength theory all on 

2492
02:23:36,641 --> 02:23:36,860
my own.

2493
02:23:36,920 --> 02:23:41,920
I'm not a geologist and several months 
in the in the library's working out the 

2494
02:23:43,011 --> 02:23:48,011
geology and convinced myself,
let's put together the whole theory of 

2495
02:23:48,011 --> 02:23:51,881
the water weathering and then it just 
sat there for 10 years a serpent and 

2496
02:23:51,881 --> 02:23:55,790
this guy was published and whenever it 
was when 79,

2497
02:23:55,791 --> 02:24:00,680
something like that and nobody paid any 
attention to it.

2498
02:24:00,681 --> 02:24:05,681
And then I had a friend who'd been 
teaching english at cairo and american 

2499
02:24:05,781 --> 02:24:08,270
university in cairo and he was very 
interested.

2500
02:24:08,271 --> 02:24:13,271
he got ahold of my work,
was very interested and one day we were 

2501
02:24:13,271 --> 02:24:17,510
having not taught at boston university 
and one day we're having a dinner and he

2502
02:24:17,511 --> 02:24:17,990
said,
you know,

2503
02:24:17,991 --> 02:24:22,991
this symbolist Egypt stuff.
Your instance I think really important 

2504
02:24:22,991 --> 02:24:25,250
as I said.
So he said,

2505
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:26,180
well,
how do we,

2506
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:31,720
how do we,
what can I do as an academic to help 

2507
02:24:31,720 --> 02:24:31,830
healthier?
And I said,

2508
02:24:31,831 --> 02:24:32,510
they're instantly.

2509
02:24:32,510 --> 02:24:33,300
I said,
fine.

2510
02:24:33,301 --> 02:24:37,820
The geologist to look into the,
the water weathering of the spanx.

2511
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:40,880
And I laughed.
I said,

2512
02:24:40,881 --> 02:24:45,881
I knew from lots of experience that 
finding an open minded scientists and 

2513
02:24:45,881 --> 02:24:48,560
it's like finding a fundamentalist 
christian who loves his enemies.

2514
02:24:48,910 --> 02:24:50,720
And,
and he said,

2515
02:24:50,721 --> 02:24:51,530
well,
wait a minute,

2516
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:57,020
it seems with me anyway,
one thing or another lead to robert 

2517
02:24:57,020 --> 02:24:57,020
chalk.
And gradually,

2518
02:24:57,021 --> 02:24:58,250
gradually,
at first he did,

2519
02:24:58,310 --> 02:25:00,260
he was interested in the evidence.
He didn't let,

2520
02:25:00,270 --> 02:25:04,160
he didn't want to even,
I wasn't even supposed to know his name.

2521
02:25:04,161 --> 02:25:06,640
And finally because he was up for tenure
and it was,

2522
02:25:06,710 --> 02:25:08,870
anybody thinks they're looking for a 
lost civilization.

2523
02:25:08,871 --> 02:25:11,660
And up here we were up for tenure,
not going to get your tenure.

2524
02:25:12,230 --> 02:25:17,230
Anyway,
eventually chalk and I met and as I 

2525
02:25:17,230 --> 02:25:17,230
said,
I've been,

2526
02:25:17,400 --> 02:25:17,870
I,
I,

2527
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:21,910
I find not evolution.
Evolution is a plaque with our windy and

2528
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:26,920
evolution by natural selection is 
arguably the greatest superstition ever 

2529
02:25:27,821 --> 02:25:29,380
foisted upon the human race.

2530
02:25:29,650 --> 02:25:34,650
Do you believe happened?
How do you believe that human beings 

2531
02:25:34,650 --> 02:25:34,650
came to be?

2532
02:25:34,650 --> 02:25:39,460
I don't know,
but I don't know how mosquitoes came to 

2533
02:25:39,460 --> 02:25:39,460
be there.
And the,

2534
02:25:39,460 --> 02:25:43,200
and the.
And the darwinian explanation is so 

2535
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:45,400
explanation is completely untenable.

2536
02:25:45,970 --> 02:25:50,970
What's,
what's our song is that a human beings 

2537
02:25:50,970 --> 02:25:52,560
would evolve through net or progress 
through natural selection that's on top.

2538
02:25:52,680 --> 02:25:53,330
That's,
that's,

2539
02:25:53,370 --> 02:25:55,020
that's a lot of the key.
See,

2540
02:25:55,080 --> 02:25:56,490
when we shock,
and I,

2541
02:25:57,710 --> 02:26:02,710
let me,
let me go backtrack to when I met up 

2542
02:26:02,710 --> 02:26:03,650
with shock and so it was very,
uh,

2543
02:26:03,690 --> 02:26:07,860
cautious mEeting and mean he was 
involved with this loony heretic,

2544
02:26:07,861 --> 02:26:12,861
me and we were getting on pretty well 
and having a discussion and I gave a 

2545
02:26:13,621 --> 02:26:18,621
lecture.
He organized a lecture for me plus the 

2546
02:26:18,621 --> 02:26:20,931
universities to the faculty and 
interested students and that went quite 

2547
02:26:20,931 --> 02:26:21,750
well.
This is what we're talking now,

2548
02:26:21,751 --> 02:26:26,751
89.
And then I went back to [inaudible] 

2549
02:26:26,751 --> 02:26:29,751
house for dinner and I'm as a subject of
evolution came up and he's not just a 

2550
02:26:31,021 --> 02:26:34,560
geologists and geophysicists but 
paleontologist as well.

2551
02:26:34,830 --> 02:26:38,730
So he was very into the whole 
evolutionary hypothesis.

2552
02:26:39,060 --> 02:26:43,350
And I mentioned the,
you know who stephen jay gould was?

2553
02:26:44,190 --> 02:26:45,880
No,
I do not ltl low lee.

2554
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:49,590
They died not too long ago,
but he was everybody's favorite.

2555
02:26:50,220 --> 02:26:55,220
Um,
he was everybody's favorite sharpies 

2556
02:26:55,220 --> 02:26:58,620
geologist or biologist.
He was sort of like the equivalent of 

2557
02:26:58,620 --> 02:26:58,620
carl sagan.
You know,

2558
02:26:58,620 --> 02:27:00,240
he was right.
Yeah.

2559
02:27:00,510 --> 02:27:02,940
Well,
he was sort of the carl sagan of geology

2560
02:27:02,941 --> 02:27:07,941
and evolutionary biology and using the 
new yorker all the time and all that 

2561
02:27:07,941 --> 02:27:09,580
sort of stuff.
And I said the shotgun,

2562
02:27:10,550 --> 02:27:15,550
we got into carefully answer the whole 
question of evolution and um,

2563
02:27:18,390 --> 02:27:18,930
and I said,
well,

2564
02:27:18,931 --> 02:27:22,590
what do you think of stephen jay gould?
And he's always a bozo.

2565
02:27:23,220 --> 02:27:28,220
I didn't know that somebody I could talk
to realize that this guy wasn't deemed 

2566
02:27:28,890 --> 02:27:30,150
literate,
but a bozo.

2567
02:27:30,600 --> 02:27:33,780
And actually without getting deep into 
this,

2568
02:27:33,781 --> 02:27:38,781
because this is,
this is our next book after we were at 

2569
02:27:38,781 --> 02:27:39,440
the bridge of sarah,
chuck has really into this,

2570
02:27:39,990 --> 02:27:43,650
I hope,
the definitive anti darwin book,

2571
02:27:43,800 --> 02:27:48,800
not anti evolution anti darwin.
And let me just give you a little clue.

2572
02:27:49,620 --> 02:27:53,700
Use the language yourself.
Everybody does natural selection.

2573
02:27:54,480 --> 02:27:58,430
A lot of this is not science.
This is the,

2574
02:27:58,580 --> 02:28:03,580
the,
the equivalent of george orwell's 

2575
02:28:03,580 --> 02:28:04,910
newspeak.
It's science fake.

2576
02:28:05,190 --> 02:28:09,240
If you look at the two words themselves,
natural selection is,

2577
02:28:09,360 --> 02:28:14,360
is,
is promoted as the means whereby sings 

2578
02:28:16,411 --> 02:28:21,411
automatically by a series.
this is a quote from a very famous 

2579
02:28:21,560 --> 02:28:25,310
evolution,
darwinian daniel dennett.

2580
02:28:25,530 --> 02:28:30,530
A series of lucky coincidence is 
produces mosquitoes and us and all the 

2581
02:28:30,530 --> 02:28:35,231
rest of it,
and this is supposed to be the agency 

2582
02:28:35,231 --> 02:28:37,550
for this is natural selection.
Whether we look at the word natural,

2583
02:28:37,551 --> 02:28:42,551
if you go to the dictionary,
even the great big oxford english 

2584
02:28:42,551 --> 02:28:44,300
dictionary that I have,
and look up the word natural,

2585
02:28:44,630 --> 02:28:48,350
nowhere does natural mean accidental or 
fortuitous.

2586
02:28:48,410 --> 02:28:50,720
Natural simply means of the natural 
world,

2587
02:28:51,050 --> 02:28:54,230
so to say that it's natural means that 
it's accidental,

2588
02:28:55,130 --> 02:28:56,210
has nothing to do with the word.

2589
02:28:56,210 --> 02:29:01,210
Natural doesn't describe accidental,
has no nowhere does it come out or 

2590
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:07,280
suggest fortuitousness,
and then you look at selection.

2591
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:12,700
This is also selection.
Selection presupposes choice and 

2592
02:29:13,821 --> 02:29:18,821
purpose.
The roulette wheel does not select the 

2593
02:29:18,821 --> 02:29:21,140
number that the ball is going to fall 
on.

2594
02:29:22,490 --> 02:29:27,490
People are selected for the nba.
Draft candidates are selected for 

2595
02:29:28,970 --> 02:29:32,210
running for office.
It suggests choice.

2596
02:29:32,570 --> 02:29:37,570
Natural suggests hierarchical order of 
the most sophisticated purpose,

2597
02:29:37,880 --> 02:29:42,880
so to call an accidental process.
Natural selection is a con job.

2598
02:29:43,580 --> 02:29:45,890
If they wanted to describe it.
Actually.

2599
02:29:46,610 --> 02:29:49,010
Actually,
daniel dennett does a very good job.

2600
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:54,040
he says,
evolution is nothing but a series of 

2601
02:29:54,040 --> 02:29:55,130
lucky coincidences.
If they call the whole theory,

2602
02:29:55,370 --> 02:29:59,240
the siri of lucky coincidences would 
stop sounding scientific.

2603
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:04,600
We don't know how any of these things 
developed and the,

2604
02:30:05,060 --> 02:30:09,800
the much derided,
what do they call themselves,

2605
02:30:09,830 --> 02:30:14,830
the intelligent design people also,
they use the wrong a bit.

2606
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:20,080
They use the wrong language because 
intelligent design suggests a designer 

2607
02:30:20,080 --> 02:30:21,780
and then you're talking about god,
and of course they're not,

2608
02:30:22,550 --> 02:30:27,320
they're not going to be talking about 
god and getting away with it in academic

2609
02:30:27,321 --> 02:30:28,860
circles.
But in fact,

2610
02:30:28,861 --> 02:30:31,040
if they called it intelligent 
creativity,

2611
02:30:31,550 --> 02:30:36,550
that'd be closer to the mark.
Creativity is built into the universal 

2612
02:30:36,550 --> 02:30:37,320
structure.
It's,

2613
02:30:37,350 --> 02:30:41,120
it's creativity itself,
but we're in the middle of creativity,

2614
02:30:41,780 --> 02:30:44,630
um,
ourselves.

2615
02:30:44,690 --> 02:30:49,690
So it's very difficult to discuss this 
particularly because we've been brought 

2616
02:30:49,690 --> 02:30:52,790
up in this,
in this paradigm of,

2617
02:30:52,860 --> 02:30:57,860
of science speak.
And actually after the bridge of sarah 

2618
02:30:57,860 --> 02:30:58,400
and shotguns,
as much into this as I am,

2619
02:30:58,401 --> 02:30:59,000
and he's,
you know,

2620
02:30:59,001 --> 02:31:00,830
he's got all the credentials behind 
them.

2621
02:31:01,370 --> 02:31:04,010
We're going to do a book,
I think called.

2622
02:31:05,150 --> 02:31:10,070
It's like if I have my wife darwin,
darwin,

2623
02:31:10,410 --> 02:31:15,160
suddenly cycle dddd,
edd darwin debunked darwin declawed,

2624
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:20,860
darwin dethroned,
a scientist and a scholar deconstruct 

2625
02:31:21,001 --> 02:31:25,050
the cargo cult of the west.
It's a fraud from beginning to end.

2626
02:31:25,051 --> 02:31:29,010
It is not science.
Evolution is a process.

2627
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:31,110
This is.
This is demonstrable.

2628
02:31:31,470 --> 02:31:36,470
The manner in which it manifests through
supposedly natural selection is a total 

2629
02:31:36,841 --> 02:31:37,320
fraud.

2630
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:42,320
So what you're saying,
just to clarify is that evolution is 

2631
02:31:42,320 --> 02:31:42,930
real,
but the process of natural selection due

2632
02:31:42,931 --> 02:31:45,600
to random mutations and something you 
don't buy,

2633
02:31:45,601 --> 02:31:50,601
you think there's.
There's more of a design element to it 

2634
02:31:50,601 --> 02:31:50,601
all.
It more.

2635
02:31:50,601 --> 02:31:55,050
It seems to be acting and responding in 
a creative and intelligent way.

2636
02:31:55,940 --> 02:31:57,260
That's right.
In other words,

2637
02:31:57,410 --> 02:32:02,410
it is creativity.
Creativity is there before anything is 

2638
02:32:04,641 --> 02:32:05,870
created.
In other words,

2639
02:32:05,871 --> 02:32:06,860
it's,
it's,

2640
02:32:06,920 --> 02:32:11,920
it's the matrix in which things somehow 
or another,

2641
02:32:11,961 --> 02:32:15,020
and we don't know the process evolved,
but it's not.

2642
02:32:15,740 --> 02:32:20,740
It's not.
It probably is not random and in fact 

2643
02:32:20,740 --> 02:32:21,800
there's a ton of stuff when you get into
this.

2644
02:32:21,801 --> 02:32:26,540
I have a folder this live on nolan 
evolution.

2645
02:32:26,541 --> 02:32:29,360
That's shocking.
I will let and I will get into

2646
02:32:30,010 --> 02:32:30,290
what

2647
02:32:31,430 --> 02:32:36,430
pretty soon,
somewhere along the line that it can't.

2648
02:32:37,490 --> 02:32:42,170
It can't work that way and the deeper 
they look,

2649
02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:44,150
the more they find.
I mean,

2650
02:32:44,151 --> 02:32:49,151
I just had today actually you should.
You should write and conquer and get 

2651
02:32:49,970 --> 02:32:52,280
this guys is.
I worked with them,

2652
02:32:52,281 --> 02:32:52,610
steve

2653
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:57,450
list that he sends out every week of 
interesting articles.

2654
02:32:57,451 --> 02:32:58,980
They were.
There was one just today,

2655
02:32:59,130 --> 02:33:04,130
maybe one of the other science things 
that I get all the time about the 

2656
02:33:05,941 --> 02:33:08,850
intelligence,
the intelligence of plants.

2657
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,710
We actually communicate with each other 
and so on.

2658
02:33:12,711 --> 02:33:17,711
In other words,
we exist within the creative matrix.

2659
02:33:18,540 --> 02:33:22,590
It's not that stuff just happens in all 
of a sudden there's intelligence.

2660
02:33:22,591 --> 02:33:27,300
It's that there is intelligence and we 
are the results of the intelligence.

2661
02:33:28,050 --> 02:33:30,420
Not that god woke up one morning and 
said,

2662
02:33:30,421 --> 02:33:33,150
well,
today I think I will create mosquitoes.

2663
02:33:33,470 --> 02:33:38,470
Is that somehow that it's like imagining
for example,

2664
02:33:39,271 --> 02:33:44,271
do you suppose that the cells in our 
body have any idea of or my body have 

2665
02:33:45,811 --> 02:33:50,811
any idea that I'm.
Here I am talking to a guy called joe 

2666
02:33:50,811 --> 02:33:51,870
rogan,
the three hours about these subjects.

2667
02:33:52,110 --> 02:33:57,110
They don't know.
I don't think they know something else 

2668
02:33:57,110 --> 02:33:59,400
that they know,
so that's something like us.

2669
02:33:59,490 --> 02:34:02,730
We're cells in a,
in a much in a,

2670
02:34:02,780 --> 02:34:07,780
in a prodigious let intelligence and 
directed organism and that's the.

2671
02:34:08,400 --> 02:34:13,400
That's actually the.
Even though you'd never know it from 

2672
02:34:13,400 --> 02:34:14,780
listening to the bologna that the,
you know,

2673
02:34:14,860 --> 02:34:19,860
the priests and the or rabbis and all of
these imbeciles talk about this is 

2674
02:34:20,561 --> 02:34:24,070
actually what's at the basis of all of 
the religions,

2675
02:34:24,100 --> 02:34:29,100
however corrupt they become with we have
a function to perform in the whole 

2676
02:34:29,891 --> 02:34:34,710
gigantic structure and it's,
it's hierarchical and it's organized and

2677
02:34:34,720 --> 02:34:39,720
it's up to us to do our bit to do it.
But natural selection is a set.

2678
02:34:40,030 --> 02:34:42,160
It's a linguistic fraud.
It's spin.

2679
02:34:42,450 --> 02:34:47,450
So this is where it gets really crazy 
because where did the,

2680
02:34:48,300 --> 02:34:53,300
how did the human animal emerge if the 
human animal didn't emerge from lower 

2681
02:34:53,300 --> 02:34:56,010
hot minutes and we existed in this form 
from the beginning.

2682
02:34:56,011 --> 02:35:01,011
Is that the supposition?
Because they've absolutely proven that 

2683
02:35:01,011 --> 02:35:02,610
there had been loW lower forms of of 
human beings,

2684
02:35:02,790 --> 02:35:07,790
other,
other different branches of the human 

2685
02:35:07,790 --> 02:35:08,550
tree that that died off neanderthal.
For example,

2686
02:35:08,551 --> 02:35:10,020
Australia.
Pithy kiss is a,

2687
02:35:10,021 --> 02:35:15,021
a bunch of different ones from the past.
They suppose where what they call quote 

2688
02:35:15,021 --> 02:35:15,890
unquote early man,
you don't buy that.

2689
02:35:15,900 --> 02:35:16,370
That's early.

2690
02:35:16,460 --> 02:35:20,160
We don't know where they lived within 
themselves saying earlier.

2691
02:35:21,050 --> 02:35:23,630
they're assuming these are primitive 
beings.

2692
02:35:23,870 --> 02:35:25,430
When I talked earlier,
I mean we,

2693
02:35:25,540 --> 02:35:28,760
we're going with our strengths and I go 
back in our shell date,

2694
02:35:30,200 --> 02:35:33,260
april who produced day and as I said 
earlier,

2695
02:35:34,070 --> 02:35:39,070
really are our level of development is 
an inner thing.

2696
02:35:40,940 --> 02:35:42,920
You can't tell,
anD as I,

2697
02:35:43,030 --> 02:35:48,030
as I said earlier,
using the image of dance as an as say an

2698
02:35:48,620 --> 02:35:53,620
enlightened society idea that expressed 
itself only in dance and by dancing 

2699
02:35:54,900 --> 02:35:59,410
experienced the highest levels of 
creativity.

2700
02:35:59,810 --> 02:36:04,810
See,
this is the thing that most of these 

2701
02:36:04,810 --> 02:36:06,761
scientists are,
are seriously defective human beings.

2702
02:36:07,041 --> 02:36:11,540
They're uncreative bite nature and they 
distrust their own emotions.

2703
02:36:11,950 --> 02:36:16,950
london that grants you listened to the 
beethoven quartets and walk into this 

2704
02:36:16,950 --> 02:36:21,280
cathedral of genre of the temples of 
Egypt and that tells you a lot,

2705
02:36:21,560 --> 02:36:23,750
even if you can't necessarily explain 
it.

2706
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:29,480
I mean we,
however we are at maybe let's say the 

2707
02:36:29,480 --> 02:36:31,670
car sufis in certain of the,
of the esoteric societies,

2708
02:36:32,090 --> 02:36:37,090
you know,
habit that we're there from the 

2709
02:36:37,090 --> 02:36:39,860
beginning,
but we're only made manifest.

2710
02:36:40,370 --> 02:36:45,370
However that happens at a later date.
There's absolutely no evidence that,

2711
02:36:45,820 --> 02:36:47,900
you know,
they Come up with lucy or something like

2712
02:36:47,901 --> 02:36:48,620
that.
We don't know.

2713
02:36:48,940 --> 02:36:53,480
We have no idea what went on inside 
lucy's art none.

2714
02:36:53,970 --> 02:36:55,890
But we do know that 65 million,

2715
02:36:56,920 --> 02:37:00,920
sorry,
we do paypal extrapolating,

2716
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:07,360
rationalizing.
Basically wHat they're doing is they're 

2717
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:07,360
rationalizing their own emptiness.

2718
02:37:07,360 --> 02:37:09,770
We know that 65 million years ago there 
was a mass extinction.

2719
02:37:09,771 --> 02:37:14,000
There's no flowering plants before that.
There was a completely different sort of

2720
02:37:14,001 --> 02:37:16,430
an atmosphere,
completely animals here.

2721
02:37:16,590 --> 02:37:16,980
What,
how,

2722
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:22,000
what happened there,
I mean obviously if most life was wiped 

2723
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:25,811
out and the current life that we have 
right now exists post 65 million years 

2724
02:37:25,811 --> 02:37:26,000
ago

2725
02:37:27,800 --> 02:37:32,370
following this stuff,
which I do every week.

2726
02:37:32,371 --> 02:37:35,790
There's a new theory about what happened
65 million years ago.

2727
02:37:36,040 --> 02:37:38,190
We don't know and we,
in fact,

2728
02:37:38,370 --> 02:37:42,750
we don't even know if there were people 
and there's some pretty good.

2729
02:37:42,790 --> 02:37:46,810
We still have an instance that dog to 
settle down what I said,

2730
02:37:46,811 --> 02:37:51,811
tell that dog to settle down and I'm 
going to tell him what's.

2731
02:37:53,800 --> 02:37:58,750
What kind of dog is it?
ThIs dude's awesome.

2732
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:03,910
It just goes against his dog.
We should probably wrap this up too,

2733
02:38:04,120 --> 02:38:05,630
but I want to ask him about,
uh,

2734
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:06,400
how many,
how many,

2735
02:38:06,430 --> 02:38:08,410
how many minutes are we in?
Two 45.

2736
02:38:08,740 --> 02:38:11,230
I want to ask him about the stoned ape 
theory before we take off.

2737
02:38:11,260 --> 02:38:12,160
Hey,
there he is.

2738
02:38:12,970 --> 02:38:14,960
What's up buddy?
Is that a dog?

2739
02:38:15,850 --> 02:38:20,230
Can see his face rejection greyhound on 
ancient egyptian ground.

2740
02:38:20,231 --> 02:38:20,920
Wow.
Wow.

2741
02:38:21,040 --> 02:38:23,710
Your chips to the bone son louie.
You know,

2742
02:38:24,470 --> 02:38:27,410
dogs that got me interested in needs 
into the goodwill when I.

2743
02:38:27,670 --> 02:38:30,520
My first short story was published in 
[inaudible] 57.

2744
02:38:30,530 --> 02:38:35,530
I went to the island of the visa in the 
corinthian in the mediterranean.

2745
02:38:36,830 --> 02:38:38,930
And these dogs stayed secure there.

2746
02:38:40,670 --> 02:38:43,070
No,
I wanted it.

2747
02:38:43,710 --> 02:38:45,620
They got me interested in needs at the 
beginning.

2748
02:38:45,790 --> 02:38:49,510
I wanted to ask you one more question 
about the development of human beings.

2749
02:38:49,540 --> 02:38:51,460
Are you familiar with the work of 
terence mckenna?

2750
02:38:52,120 --> 02:38:57,120
Yes.
Were you familiar with his stoned ape 

2751
02:38:57,120 --> 02:38:57,120
theory?
Yeah,

2752
02:38:57,120 --> 02:38:58,460
and I don't go for it.
You don't go for it.

2753
02:39:00,260 --> 02:39:05,260
For the folks at home is the doubling of
the human brain size occurred over a 

2754
02:39:05,260 --> 02:39:09,911
period of 2 million years,
which he coincides with the rain forest 

2755
02:39:09,911 --> 02:39:13,721
receding into grasslands and then the 
lower hominids coming out of the trees 

2756
02:39:13,721 --> 02:39:16,790
experimented with new food sources and 
eating psilocybin mushrooms.

2757
02:39:16,840 --> 02:39:17,040
Yes.

2758
02:39:17,470 --> 02:39:22,470
That's,
that's actually funny because for 

2759
02:39:22,470 --> 02:39:24,030
somebody who did a lot of,
a lot of experimenting with I Alaska,

2760
02:39:24,100 --> 02:39:26,380
which I've also done excellent.
Um,

2761
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:33,000
he's,
he's extrapolating and trying to make 

2762
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:37,500
his experience fit in with darwinian 
theory and he should know better than 

2763
02:39:37,500 --> 02:39:38,890
that because it was a smart guy.

2764
02:39:39,850 --> 02:39:41,810
So you're,
you're feeling.

2765
02:39:42,460 --> 02:39:43,210
I'm sorry,
go ahead.

2766
02:39:43,940 --> 02:39:44,260
No,
I'm,

2767
02:39:44,261 --> 02:39:44,690
I'm,
I'm,

2768
02:39:44,790 --> 02:39:46,890
I'm more inclined to think,
you know,

2769
02:39:46,940 --> 02:39:47,820
listen,
the,

2770
02:39:49,570 --> 02:39:54,570
virtually all of the ancient texts talk 
about a kind of edenic state,

2771
02:39:55,851 --> 02:39:58,810
you know,
and enlightened states that we descended

2772
02:39:58,811 --> 02:40:02,730
from another word.
We start at the top and degenerate.

2773
02:40:03,130 --> 02:40:05,710
And to me this is not,
this is,

2774
02:40:05,830 --> 02:40:09,150
this is not so difficult to imaGine.
I mean this,

2775
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:14,400
it happens often that things,
the great teacher comes and everything 

2776
02:40:14,491 --> 02:40:15,290
disappears,
you know,

2777
02:40:15,300 --> 02:40:20,300
we tend to think that everything's like 
technology and it started off with an 

2778
02:40:20,300 --> 02:40:24,420
18,
92 mercedes and suddenly we've got a 

2779
02:40:24,420 --> 02:40:27,840
2012 ferrari.
But with Egypt for example,

2780
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:33,200
it seems to be at its height at the very
beginning with no period of development 

2781
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:33,200
we don't know.

2782
02:40:33,210 --> 02:40:38,210
So it's Just.
So it's such a massive mystery and your 

2783
02:40:38,210 --> 02:40:40,971
all,
your years of exploring it have 

2784
02:40:40,971 --> 02:40:40,971
literally got you to the point where 
you're like,

2785
02:40:40,971 --> 02:40:41,650
no one knows and not talking about it.

2786
02:40:41,940 --> 02:40:44,910
Nonsense.
Well anyway,

2787
02:40:44,911 --> 02:40:46,560
talking about it as though,
you know,

2788
02:40:46,620 --> 02:40:47,980
definitive terms.
Yeah,

2789
02:40:48,090 --> 02:40:50,700
in definitive terms,
just so crazy.

2790
02:40:51,390 --> 02:40:53,340
We just,
we just plain don't know.

2791
02:40:53,940 --> 02:40:56,640
But one of the things you can depend on 
actually

2792
02:40:57,060 --> 02:41:02,060
is that,
who are you going to take your lessons 

2793
02:41:02,060 --> 02:41:06,291
from?
The guys who invented the bobble head 

2794
02:41:06,291 --> 02:41:08,271
doll and the atom bomb with the guys who
did shots and the temple of luxor and 

2795
02:41:08,361 --> 02:41:10,770
the,
and the late quartets.

2796
02:41:11,100 --> 02:41:16,100
Me,
I'll go with the creatives any day 

2797
02:41:16,100 --> 02:41:16,100
because I am one myself.
That's it.

2798
02:41:16,100 --> 02:41:16,100
I'm not.

2799
02:41:17,010 --> 02:41:22,010
How long was the period between the 
decline of the old kingdom and the time 

2800
02:41:22,010 --> 02:41:23,750
where they discovered the pyramids,
which were,

2801
02:41:23,760 --> 02:41:25,860
there was no one living in them when 
they were discovered.

2802
02:41:25,861 --> 02:41:26,430
When,
when,

2803
02:41:26,700 --> 02:41:27,280
when,
uh,

2804
02:41:27,330 --> 02:41:31,150
napoleon's army marched through Egypt.
There was no one living in the,

2805
02:41:31,230 --> 02:41:33,030
in the,
the pyramids like they,

2806
02:41:33,570 --> 02:41:38,570
where we lost a lot of information as 
far as anyone knows to live in that 

2807
02:41:40,771 --> 02:41:42,270
area.
Then there no one,

2808
02:41:42,300 --> 02:41:44,310
there weren't.
They didn't habit that area.

2809
02:41:44,930 --> 02:41:45,490
Oh yeah,
sure.

2810
02:41:45,500 --> 02:41:45,830
Okay,
good.

2811
02:41:45,930 --> 02:41:47,760
I mean it was all farmland around in 
there.

2812
02:41:48,010 --> 02:41:52,690
They're in the desert with just a couple
of few hundred yards below with a sphinx

2813
02:41:52,691 --> 02:41:54,370
says this valley.
So yeah.

2814
02:41:54,371 --> 02:41:56,170
So it's all farmland and everything.

2815
02:41:57,520 --> 02:41:58,980
So my point was like,
oh,

2816
02:41:58,981 --> 02:42:03,981
what time did it all fall apart where it
was essentially the sphinx and the 

2817
02:42:03,981 --> 02:42:08,431
pyramids and all that stopped being used
for what they were were abandoned and 

2818
02:42:08,431 --> 02:42:08,500
then people had to come back to and go,
wow,

2819
02:42:08,501 --> 02:42:09,210
look at what we have.

2820
02:42:10,580 --> 02:42:15,580
You can sort of put a date in.
The egyptian religion died shortly after

2821
02:42:17,220 --> 02:42:19,030
first,
second century add,

2822
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:24,320
who was no longer being practiced.
Although the knowledge percolated down 

2823
02:42:24,931 --> 02:42:28,770
into alexandria and dispersed around the
middle east,

2824
02:42:28,771 --> 02:42:31,090
the library of alexandria.
This was,

2825
02:42:31,410 --> 02:42:36,410
this was a hotbed of,
of intellectual and philosophical 

2826
02:42:37,321 --> 02:42:39,180
activity always.
I mean,

2827
02:42:39,300 --> 02:42:44,300
alexandria was always there,
but the actual egyptian religion as 

2828
02:42:44,300 --> 02:42:45,600
such,
died somewhere,

2829
02:42:45,601 --> 02:42:47,520
let's say in the middle of the third 
century,

2830
02:42:48,330 --> 02:42:53,330
add letters and said earlier than the 
hermetic disciplines in alchemy and 

2831
02:42:53,330 --> 02:42:55,440
astrology and magic and number 
symbolism,

2832
02:42:55,900 --> 02:43:00,900
neoplatonism.
All of that knowledge continued 

2833
02:43:00,900 --> 02:43:01,590
throughout,
you know,

2834
02:43:01,591 --> 02:43:03,980
throughout european civilization.
And we know this,

2835
02:43:04,030 --> 02:43:08,530
the renaissance,
the great figures of the renaissance.

2836
02:43:08,531 --> 02:43:12,710
So we're always credited with,
with opening way out of superstition and

2837
02:43:12,711 --> 02:43:13,840
so on.
You know,

2838
02:43:13,841 --> 02:43:15,220
an answer.
Modern science,

2839
02:43:15,730 --> 02:43:20,730
they did open the way to modern science,
but they themselves believe that their 

2840
02:43:20,730 --> 02:43:24,010
own knowledge and kepler discovered the 
laws of planetary motion.

2841
02:43:24,400 --> 02:43:25,870
He said,
I've discovered the.

2842
02:43:26,010 --> 02:43:28,420
I really discovered the secrets of the 
egyptians.

2843
02:43:28,690 --> 02:43:32,410
It was a given to them that,
that all of this,

2844
02:43:32,540 --> 02:43:35,380
this advanced knowledge was available in
Egypt,

2845
02:43:35,650 --> 02:43:38,470
but it was trawler who actually this is 
one of his great,

2846
02:43:38,770 --> 02:43:39,400
great,
great,

2847
02:43:39,430 --> 02:43:42,520
great contributions that human thought,
which weiler,

2848
02:43:42,521 --> 02:43:45,490
who proves that they had no mistaking it

2849
02:43:45,940 --> 02:43:50,940
and they had it and it came out of 
nowhere and they had it and it came out 

2850
02:43:50,941 --> 02:43:54,450
of nowhere and there was nothing before 
and then all of a sudden this incredibly

2851
02:43:54,451 --> 02:43:55,680
intelligent civilization.

2852
02:43:56,070 --> 02:43:57,740
As I said,
no you don't.

2853
02:43:57,790 --> 02:43:58,350
No,
no.

2854
02:43:58,780 --> 02:44:03,780
Just too crazy.
You keep going back and they keep going 

2855
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:04,980
back in.
The further they go back,

2856
02:44:06,180 --> 02:44:10,560
all of a sudden they come across 
something that disproves everything they

2857
02:44:10,580 --> 02:44:13,710
thought the floor look show gay.
This is wonderfuL.

2858
02:44:13,740 --> 02:44:18,740
This is spectacular art in the cave.
How would those people living In that 

2859
02:44:18,740 --> 02:44:21,870
television sets the bobble head dolls,
but if you can tank like that,

2860
02:44:24,680 --> 02:44:29,680
you've got something serious going on 
inside you and who says they invented 

2861
02:44:29,761 --> 02:44:32,010
it?
You see the further back you go,

2862
02:44:32,310 --> 02:44:34,920
the more tenuous everything gets.
Recently,

2863
02:44:34,921 --> 02:44:39,470
there've been some interesting studies 
on flint knapping on,

2864
02:44:39,500 --> 02:44:40,230
you know,
in other words,

2865
02:44:40,231 --> 02:44:45,231
cutting flint to make to make different 
kinds of tools with this is this is 

2866
02:44:45,231 --> 02:44:50,121
actually a pretty advanced art and 
they're finding flint tools,

2867
02:44:51,060 --> 02:44:55,410
very sophisticated tools that go back 
200,000

2868
02:44:55,411 --> 02:44:56,310
years.
Well,

2869
02:44:56,311 --> 02:44:58,770
what was going through their heads that 
they're doing this stuff.

2870
02:44:58,800 --> 02:45:01,140
We don't know what was going through 
their hearts.

2871
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:06,500
They've discovered this is again only 
the last couple of years that sea travel

2872
02:45:06,961 --> 02:45:11,961
was going on between north africa and 
I'm not sure if it was cypress or some 

2873
02:45:11,961 --> 02:45:14,970
of the greek islands.
It's either 100,000

2874
02:45:14,971 --> 02:45:17,040
years ago or 200,000
years ago.

2875
02:45:18,210 --> 02:45:23,210
So if you follow this stuff,
the more the more that's discovered,

2876
02:45:24,960 --> 02:45:29,960
the more you become impressed that some 
kind of advanced knowledge was always 

2877
02:45:29,960 --> 02:45:34,551
there and even that is,
is based upon a technological.

2878
02:45:34,671 --> 02:45:39,671
It's the only way we tend to think a 
technological assessment of what they 

2879
02:45:39,671 --> 02:45:43,791
know.
We don't know what was going on inside 

2880
02:45:43,791 --> 02:45:43,791
them.

2881
02:45:43,791 --> 02:45:46,780
We don't know how intelligent they were 
and that the possibility is that they 

2882
02:45:46,780 --> 02:45:47,390
were right for this intelligent from the
beginning.

2883
02:45:48,570 --> 02:45:52,450
Maybe it isn't even a question of 
intelligence.

2884
02:45:52,790 --> 02:45:56,320
It's more requests and really a bit of 
experience.

2885
02:45:56,470 --> 02:45:59,410
I mean how much intelligence do you need
to,

2886
02:45:59,960 --> 02:46:04,960
let's say it's to be moved like a dates 
open courts at so you don't think about 

2887
02:46:04,991 --> 02:46:07,840
this stuff.
It's just we're brought up in such a way

2888
02:46:07,860 --> 02:46:10,430
by this,
by this Nicholas Church and progress.

2889
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:15,880
To think that you have to be able to do 
complex mathematics and all kinds of 

2890
02:46:16,911 --> 02:46:21,911
stuff in order to be civilized and then 
even even when even when you have that 

2891
02:46:21,951 --> 02:46:24,320
point of view,
the further back you go,

2892
02:46:24,560 --> 02:46:29,560
you see that they had a cosmology and 
see that they had a geometry and they 

2893
02:46:29,560 --> 02:46:33,701
had technology to produce to go back,
tap in the today.

2894
02:46:34,220 --> 02:46:35,540
So,
so the whole.

2895
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:40,670
So the whole darwinian paradigm is 
exploded.

2896
02:46:40,671 --> 02:46:43,070
When you take all of those things into 
consideration,

2897
02:46:44,040 --> 02:46:47,520
is it possible that the dark darwinian 
model works?

2898
02:46:47,521 --> 02:46:52,521
If you just take the timeline way back 
then people evolved over hundreds of 

2899
02:46:52,521 --> 02:46:56,511
thousands of years and hundreds of 
thousands of years earlier than we 

2900
02:46:56,511 --> 02:46:56,511
thought,

2901
02:46:56,511 --> 02:46:56,760
well,
that's what they say,

2902
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:58,770
but why should it?
In other words,

2903
02:46:58,980 --> 02:47:03,980
in other words,
what is there and the what is there and 

2904
02:47:03,980 --> 02:47:06,801
the nature of the hydrogen atom that 
presupposes that that things are going 

2905
02:47:06,801 --> 02:47:08,820
to get more complicated and 
sophisticated.

2906
02:47:09,750 --> 02:47:10,410
Who says,

2907
02:47:11,130 --> 02:47:13,750
well,
we say by our own designs on earth,

2908
02:47:13,770 --> 02:47:15,480
our own physical,
you know,

2909
02:47:15,481 --> 02:47:16,440
our creations.

2910
02:47:17,320 --> 02:47:21,660
Should that be accidental?
Maybe they're not be,

2911
02:47:22,050 --> 02:47:27,050
why should there not be,
let's say I a plan to adjust this,

2912
02:47:28,741 --> 02:47:31,780
for example,
just as we grow from the fertilized ovum

2913
02:47:32,170 --> 02:47:37,170
and we go through this complex process 
of gestation and then we're born and 

2914
02:47:37,170 --> 02:47:39,340
then it's up to us with what we're going
to do with our lives and so on.

2915
02:47:39,820 --> 02:47:41,290
Who says that's an accident?

2916
02:47:42,790 --> 02:47:43,540
Yeah.
Yeah,

2917
02:47:43,550 --> 02:47:46,350
and we're not acting.
I mean,

2918
02:47:47,280 --> 02:47:49,760
to begin with,
how do you Prove that accidents?

2919
02:47:50,560 --> 02:47:53,850
See these assholes who happened on 
creativity in them?

2920
02:47:54,270 --> 02:47:59,270
Are determined,
make the world sound as meaningless as 

2921
02:47:59,270 --> 02:48:02,330
they experience it as bland and 
passionless and as devops,

2922
02:48:05,110 --> 02:48:06,290
not deliberate

2923
02:48:06,580 --> 02:48:11,580
because they don't know any better and 
in fact they hate creative people for 

2924
02:48:11,580 --> 02:48:11,580
the most part.

2925
02:48:11,580 --> 02:48:12,840
Well,
that's one of the beautiful things about

2926
02:48:12,841 --> 02:48:13,250
your,
the,

2927
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:16,670
the title of your dvd,
magical Egypt.

2928
02:48:17,900 --> 02:48:22,900
It really is really is and,
and thank you very much for coming on 

2929
02:48:22,900 --> 02:48:22,910
the show today,
man.

2930
02:48:22,911 --> 02:48:27,140
You've explained a lot of things in 
incredible detail.

2931
02:48:27,350 --> 02:48:31,610
It's been an honor to get to ask you 
questions because I have been a huge fan

2932
02:48:31,611 --> 02:48:36,611
of your work for many,
many years now and I'm a huge fan of 

2933
02:48:36,611 --> 02:48:38,400
that dvd series and I would love to go 
eventually to Egypt with you someday.

2934
02:48:38,450 --> 02:48:40,030
We should do that.
We should figure something out.

2935
02:48:40,040 --> 02:48:45,040
That's to be that eventual you have to 
do is talk about it and get 10 people 

2936
02:48:45,040 --> 02:48:48,230
from your very,
very extensive store of people to go and

2937
02:48:48,231 --> 02:48:49,160
you can get a free trip.

2938
02:48:49,460 --> 02:48:50,990
I could do that.
we can make that happen.

2939
02:48:51,110 --> 02:48:51,740
We're going to do it.

2940
02:48:52,280 --> 02:48:55,630
I say one thing because I have a list of
things that I want to talk about.

2941
02:48:56,770 --> 02:48:58,700
One of them is,
I don't know,

2942
02:48:59,780 --> 02:49:01,770
do you know gerald celente is?
No.

2943
02:49:02,390 --> 02:49:05,210
A trends analyst and he's a very,
very interesting guys.

2944
02:49:05,250 --> 02:49:07,020
A colleague,
his name before he,

2945
02:49:07,100 --> 02:49:12,100
he is working with them is I'm cold 
writer and executive editor of the 

2946
02:49:12,421 --> 02:49:14,760
trends journal and it's,
I mean he's,

2947
02:49:16,040 --> 02:49:21,040
he,
he forecasts is probably more accurate 

2948
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:23,130
over the last 30 years than anyone else.
And we put out,

2949
02:49:23,190 --> 02:49:24,600
he puts out,
we put out,

2950
02:49:25,140 --> 02:49:26,780
he puts it really,
um,

2951
02:49:26,820 --> 02:49:31,820
something called the trends journal and 
it's very interesting because what he 

2952
02:49:32,461 --> 02:49:37,461
sees coming up,
it was not pretty and these right a lot 

2953
02:49:38,821 --> 02:49:42,240
of the time.
And I mean I try,

2954
02:49:42,250 --> 02:49:47,250
I tried to tell people that it really,
because I'm talking the esotericism and 

2955
02:49:47,250 --> 02:49:50,640
the ancient Egypt than the meaning of 
the real civilization.

2956
02:49:51,120 --> 02:49:53,640
And gerald waS,
gerald is the,

2957
02:49:53,730 --> 02:49:58,730
between us and we've got really high 
level people working is a brilliant 

2958
02:49:58,730 --> 02:50:02,901
illustrator and we put out this journal 
that light we.

2959
02:50:05,700 --> 02:50:10,700
I mean this thing is coming unstuck in a
hurry and people don't individually and 

2960
02:50:11,401 --> 02:50:16,401
collectively prepare florid that going 
to be unprepared.

2961
02:50:17,140 --> 02:50:19,980
And so we can add to the trends journal.
I think it's a.

2962
02:50:20,120 --> 02:50:22,070
Are you talking about a collapse in the 
economy,

2963
02:50:22,071 --> 02:50:23,960
the end of civilizations,
that kind of thing.

2964
02:50:24,310 --> 02:50:26,410
Oh,
the under civilization as we know it,

2965
02:50:26,411 --> 02:50:28,120
very likely,
unless,

2966
02:50:28,480 --> 02:50:32,770
unless enough people act together 
quickly and they probably won't.

2967
02:50:33,400 --> 02:50:38,400
so we buy gold.
You've got to get away plan.

2968
02:50:39,850 --> 02:50:44,440
And who here,
where can people get this newsletter?

2969
02:50:45,190 --> 02:50:45,740
It's,
it's a,

2970
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,160
it's a journal.
Look up,

2971
02:50:49,010 --> 02:50:51,700
go to the trends journal or google up 
gerald celente,

2972
02:50:51,701 --> 02:50:54,460
c e l e n z.
He's a very interesting guy.

2973
02:50:54,461 --> 02:50:59,070
He's a real.
He's a real slave swelling.

2974
02:50:59,310 --> 02:51:01,090
That's excitable.
It's agony.

2975
02:51:01,091 --> 02:51:04,090
It's on Alex Jones all the time.
The journal,

2976
02:51:04,520 --> 02:51:07,350
the journal is,
is a really interesting publication that

2977
02:51:07,360 --> 02:51:10,310
I'm very,
I'm very proud to be a big part of it.

2978
02:51:11,100 --> 02:51:11,950
Look it up for yourself.

2979
02:51:12,020 --> 02:51:17,020
We'll check it out and your website is j
dot [inaudible] dot com and you don't 

2980
02:51:17,121 --> 02:51:22,121
have a twitter yet.
You find out about the trips and all 

2981
02:51:22,121 --> 02:51:22,910
kinds of other stuff and you don't have 
a twitter yet?

2982
02:51:24,830 --> 02:51:26,540
No,
I'm on facebook.

2983
02:51:26,620 --> 02:51:29,330
I know my daughter is looking after it 
for me.

2984
02:51:29,430 --> 02:51:31,920
Tell your daughter to get you a twitter.
We need a John Anthony weSt.

2985
02:51:31,921 --> 02:51:36,921
Twitter will populate that very quickly 
and people could find out about your 

2986
02:51:36,921 --> 02:51:36,921
trips

2987
02:51:37,060 --> 02:51:38,100
because as I said,
we're.

2988
02:51:38,410 --> 02:51:43,410
We're,
we're reviving where reincarnating our 

2989
02:51:43,410 --> 02:51:44,730
ancient wisdom foundation and by the 
way,

2990
02:51:44,731 --> 02:51:47,490
I always put a plug in that before we 
end up because it's.

2991
02:51:48,330 --> 02:51:53,330
I told you,
I mean we're pretty sure I can't be a 

2992
02:51:53,330 --> 02:51:54,330
promise yet that we've got this 
incentive thing going and if you pull up

2993
02:51:54,360 --> 02:51:59,360
ancient wisdom foundation.org,
there'll be some information about the 

2994
02:51:59,360 --> 02:52:04,131
projects that we're involved in and and 
I really do believe that that unless,

2995
02:52:05,890 --> 02:52:10,890
unless enough of us have humanity goes 
back to recreates the civilization based

2996
02:52:15,071 --> 02:52:17,680
upon the ancient principles.
In other words,

2997
02:52:17,681 --> 02:52:22,681
we're not going to be build pyramids 
again or mummify or arrows or anything 

2998
02:52:22,681 --> 02:52:23,750
like that.
Look,

2999
02:52:23,751 --> 02:52:26,000
the principals meet needs,
if there's a one issue,

3000
02:52:26,030 --> 02:52:31,030
civilization is it's based upon the 
quest for immortality above the notion 

3001
02:52:31,030 --> 02:52:34,150
of the immortality of the soul,
which I absolutely believe in,

3002
02:52:34,590 --> 02:52:38,050
um,
and without that,

3003
02:52:38,140 --> 02:52:39,880
no civilization as possible.

3004
02:52:40,290 --> 02:52:45,290
So,
so the principles upon which Egypt and 

3005
02:52:45,290 --> 02:52:50,011
the other instance civilizations are 
founded is the principles are eternal in

3006
02:52:52,630 --> 02:52:57,630
civilization has passed when I said 
we're not going to multiply our parents 

3007
02:52:57,630 --> 02:53:00,991
again,
but without that understanding and 

3008
02:53:00,991 --> 02:53:03,160
without an understanding of where we're 
heading at the moment.

3009
02:53:03,161 --> 02:53:04,750
It's funny,
a scary stuff out there.

3010
02:53:05,110 --> 02:53:08,920
A lot of it is valid,
but most of the scare stuff doesn't have

3011
02:53:08,921 --> 02:53:12,400
the,
the antidote built into it.

3012
02:53:13,090 --> 02:53:18,090
And I like to think that that we do.
I think like the conversation we just 

3013
02:53:18,091 --> 02:53:23,091
had is one of none of despair but have 
the possibility of renaissance and 

3014
02:53:24,850 --> 02:53:29,850
light.
Not something known as let's say a 

3015
02:53:29,850 --> 02:53:34,030
spiritual doctrine is not something you 
believe in.

3016
02:53:34,090 --> 02:53:38,740
Believes is useless.
It's not something you do do it

3017
02:53:39,180 --> 02:53:39,660
well.
John.

3018
02:53:39,661 --> 02:53:44,661
I think also there's just the ability to
spread that kind of information 

3019
02:53:44,661 --> 02:53:46,650
knowledge to people and to be able to do
it in a forum like this.

3020
02:53:46,651 --> 02:53:51,651
It's very rare and very new and I think 
that the internet and this open access 

3021
02:53:51,651 --> 02:53:55,941
to information that we have on it is one
of the best hopes that we have for 

3022
02:53:55,941 --> 02:53:57,930
turning this whole thing around and 
thank you very much my friend.

3023
02:53:57,960 --> 02:54:02,960
Thank you very much for doing this.
I would like to do at any other time 

3024
02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:02,960
with you,
we'll we'll eventually have to work some

3025
02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:07,281
kind of a cruise thing out and we'll.
We'll all go down to Egypt and get our 

3026
02:54:07,281 --> 02:54:08,040
minds blown with you.
Thank you very much,

3027
02:54:08,041 --> 02:54:09,150
sir.
I really appreciate it.

3028
02:54:09,750 --> 02:54:11,440
Thank you.
Take care of brother.

3029
02:54:12,060 --> 02:54:16,470
Like that.
We'd done that for me,

3030
02:54:16,590 --> 02:54:19,680
man.
Just tell me when we're off skype.

3031
02:54:19,830 --> 02:54:20,850
Okay.

3032
02:54:21,690 --> 02:54:22,530
God for being,

3033
02:54:22,560 --> 02:54:24,360
that was amazing.
Holy shit.

3034

That guy's awesome.
Yeah,

3035
02:54:26,100 --> 02:54:28,000
that was,
you know,

3036
02:54:28,010 --> 02:54:33,010
I mean there you need a guy who's out 
there doing something like that to get 

3037
02:54:33,010 --> 02:54:34,950
the kind of information out and just I'm
just so happy that he exists.

3038
02:54:35,180 --> 02:54:38,760
Check out his magical Egypt dvd series.
It'll fucking blow you away.
