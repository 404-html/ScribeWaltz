1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,620
That's cool. Five, four, three,

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,150
two,
one a and [inaudible].

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,990
Brendan Schaub. What's up dog? Did
you buy those shoes yourself? Yeah,

4
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:17,550
I bought these. This one looks too much
flair for you. It's summer. Confident.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,600
Confident move. I'll get the
tight pants around the ankles.

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,940
Just riding high enough to see the
Gucci shoes. Gucci Denim, Bro. Get it.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,840
What's up, bro? You can pull it off.

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,310
You're making fun of medical like
Saudi.

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,570
Say like, yeah, I bet your girls like
Dez. I get girls also like Dick Dale.

10
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:44,010
That good flight. The chip
points then. It's true.

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,360
It's true. Dude. How about
these fights? Let's go. My God,

12
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:51,000
how about these fights?
How about I almost didn't see them.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,260
Can I text you during the broadcast? The
ESPN plus thing was a nightmare, man.

14
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,730
Yeah, they had some hiccups. Yeah.

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,730
That'd be an understatement that
that has happened before. Right?

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,410
Well digital stuff,
they didn't stay 2019 though.

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,870
Especially with ESPN though.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,920
That's where I was just shocked
and me being like a super fan.

19
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,800
I had to figure it out.
But you know how,

20
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,170
how I had to figure it out cause
it didn't work on any platform. So,

21
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,990
and it's a hiccup where you
can order it off the APP.

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,800
So you had to close the APP or it from a
desktop then shut down something and go

23
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:26,970
to your TV. It was a nightmare. But that
didn't work for me. And then I was like,

24
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:30,720
all right. And then I slowly was
missing the first fight. I'm like, man,

25
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:31,740
I got to figure stuff out.

26
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,890
And I tweeted out as having problems and
2000 savages sent me links to illegal

27
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,310
streams,
legal or illegal.

28
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,530
But of course you didn't watch
those illegal street didn't Joe?

29
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:49,770
And I'm glad you pointed out I did not,
but if I were going to,

30
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,600
would it be awesome? It was awesome.
It was HD and had zero problems.

31
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,990
I was going to glad you didn't
because they could track you that face

32
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:00,450
recognition software. They could,
they could definitely attract me.

33
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,220
It's a huge problem.

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,000
Well it was definitely a huge problem
for the first event. I don't know. Uh,

35
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,010
I don't know how many people
downloaded it and did it,

36
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:13,500
but I bet they probably
didn't see the number coming.

37
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,280
It was a big fight and those two
fights were huge. I mean, first of all,

38
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,620
something happened.
Um,

39
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,860
I think within the last year or so
for Max Holloway were like when Max

40
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,580
Holloway's face goes up on the screen,

41
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,070
people let people go nuts because
they know he throws down. Yeah,

42
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,300
I think it was the Ortega fine.

43
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,140
I really think that Ortega fight
made him a superstar. I really did.

44
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,980
The Aldo ones definitely helped us.
Tabak Aldo ass weapons.

45
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:39,420
And then the Ortega,
one thing that was different,

46
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:41,220
those Ortega had a big following.

47
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,700
Ortega was the young beautiful lion lion
with fantastic Jujitsu's handsome guy.

48
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,110
Cool, smooth talker. Looks like
a champion, fucking everybody up.

49
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,060
So he had a lot of fans coming
in there and they went to war.

50
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,740
They went to war and Max came out on top.
And I think Max,

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,820
a lot of those pm because they were
so cool with each other during,

52
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,230
before and after,

53
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:09,190
people loved it to Max is he loses
better than anyone on the fucking planet.

54
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,390
We'll loses or wins. He just goes, Hey,
I'm, I'm, I'm just going to get better.

55
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,420
He doesn't lose a lot. He doesn't
know. I mean, he lost a Connor.

56
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,980
He lost consciousness. He on his very
first fight ever, you know, 20 years old.

57
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:23,710
But I also think Max,
is it because we've always said,

58
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,700
I think both of us had been an agreement
where if a guy is cutting a ton of

59
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:30,910
weight and killed himself, go to the
next weight class. I've always said that,

60
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,380
whether it was a Darren till,
whether you know, uh, Chris Weidman,

61
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,290
Luke Rockhold, Jon Jones, like
Duke Golf, the way class dominate.

62
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,170
And then this is kind of the first time
we've seen a guy where it's like, hmm,

63
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,220
it's not that easy because
Mac Taller we went up.

64
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,000
But you could see the power wasn't
there. Like he might, he and he did,

65
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:53,560
he landed more than a dozen portray.
But when Dustin landed it,

66
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,500
you could see that it fucking counted.
Dustin is big dude. He's big Mary.

67
00:03:58,501 --> 00:04:02,760
He smiled at 45. He used to fight at
45 and it really struggled there. Um,

68
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,250
but at 55,
he's found a spot and you look at him,

69
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:08,270
he almost looks like a welterweight.
I mean he's bit,

70
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,950
it looks like Tyron Woodley size and
he cuts a shitload of weight and Max

71
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,490
Hallway in that fight just looked like
they didn't look like the same. No,

72
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,340
just purely like fucking meetings.

73
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,190
And you gotta give credit to Poirier too
because if you look at the two of them,

74
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:24,220
like after the fight there was a big
difference between the amount of damage,

75
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,750
the poor.
It landed a big difference.

76
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:28,480
He was hitting him with big shots
and it wasn't just big shots,

77
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:31,960
it was shots period.
He was hitting him with really clean,

78
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:36,400
well time shots with great head movement,
great movement about that knee dude.

79
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:40,000
Everything split open his head at
everything. He did everything great.

80
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,650
I mean he really,

81
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,030
that was a coming out party for Dustin
Poria and a lot of ways or the common fan?

82
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,130
Well yeah, well the people
that knew him from the gauge,

83
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:51,640
you fight noon from the Eddie
Alvarez fight, they knew that man,

84
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,620
he beat these two really good guys.

85
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:57,070
But Max Holloway might be one of the best
pound for pound fighters in the world.

86
00:04:57,071 --> 00:05:01,270
And I think is, I think is to Max
always the greatest one 45 or wild time.

87
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,490
I think he's a damn good 50 fiver but,
but 55 could be tough for Max.

88
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,120
Well this is a great example of what
we've always said about the differences

89
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,260
between the size of people. And
this is it. It's, it's first of all,

90
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,550
I mean all credit to uh, Dustin Poirier
cause he put on a phenomenal performance.

91
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:22,590
He got, you know, he got tested in that
fight. He came through. Let me see.

92
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:25,390
We talked about in the post
fight interview that he got
hurt in the third round.

93
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,480
He came through and just super impressive.

94
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,260
Think about as [inaudible] Anthony Pettis,
Anthony Pettis,

95
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:36,040
world champion [inaudible] world
champion. Eddie Alvarez, world champion.

96
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,250
Max Holloway, World Champ pedes
one though. Wasn't that an injury?

97
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,680
I feel like pedis got injured
and they stopped the fight.

98
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,410
Like did he break his hand?
Is that what happened? No.

99
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,130
Feel like the pedes one was an injury.
He had the issues with Eddie Alvarez.

100
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:54,520
Right. Which was a no
contest. Yeah. I think,

101
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,190
well there was one fight
where Dustin Poirier and

102
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,960
no. Yeah, I think, I think that was it.

103
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,510
There was remembered with pedes were
pedes broke his hand and Duke Roufus

104
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:05,620
stopped the fight. Remember that? Tony
Ferguson, was it 21st Tony Ferguson.

105
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,480
You're right. You're right. But
I think that was a great round.

106
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,860
Maybe it was an injury. I was a rib
member. Oh that's right. That's right.

107
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,050
Dustin got on top of him
and hurt his wrist. Right.

108
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:18,590
But still look at port A's when Smith.
Yeah. Well that's a weird one too. Right?

109
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:22,140
It's cause like what was that rib injury
from it pouring a body shot. Yeah.

110
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,970
What was that from? Was it
from the takedown? Like what
was it? Something happened.

111
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,920
I don't remember. That's right. But
either the portal or like a Tko. Yeah.

112
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:34,760
You look at portrays his list, man, the
guy, so who's fighting, who's lost too.

113
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,640
It's so impressive and portrays the guy.

114
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,660
Same thing with when Michael Bisbing one,
I always root for those guys,

115
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:44,270
those guys who've been around forever
and they fight the best of the best.

116
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:48,140
They might lose one or two here,
but they've been around for so long.

117
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,070
You just hope there's a title at
the end of their career. Yeah.

118
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,990
You just hope and it sometimes doesn't
look like it's going to happen.

119
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,900
Then when it does happen, I
just, I'm just so happy for them.

120
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,050
Such a good guy to Dustin Poirier,
great guy. He's a great guy.

121
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,200
He's smart and he's ambitious.
Seal Vons, favorite fighter.

122
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:06,050
Works hard to those lyricists that
seeing those two guys together,

123
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,840
that was hilarious. Calling them the
right both with the same whole school.

124
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,340
How about Theo was yelling instructions.
I'm going to,

125
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,350
I seem them on King of saying I'm
going to roast the shit out of him.

126
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,920
Did you take them down and went,
what? What is happening right now?

127
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,450
Why does this happen?
Yeah.

128
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,290
Shouting and strategically the
UFC provides me with a headphones.

129
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,720
I was hoping you'd shoot a
turnaround like, dude, what
are you doing? I'd love to,

130
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:31,850
you know, he's the best. Yeah,
just character, unique kid.

131
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,020
He was so happy. He was so
happy. I mean, him bet. Well,

132
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:40,580
I just bet because I'll see him and you
thought that I thought I'm not going to

133
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:45,080
be a great fight. I thought Max at 55
if everything was in care with them,

134
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:47,630
I thought Max would probably get it done
by noon, was going to be a good fight.

135
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,900
I was just betting feel because Theo is
boys with Dustin friend from the same

136
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:53,750
area, so it's just a friendly bet. I
would never bet against us and boy,

137
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,130
look at these fulls.
Hilarious. That's amazing.

138
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,920
How about,
how about a few?

139
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,810
He feels never been to a fight before
and he texted me halfway through goes,

140
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,810
dude,
I can't believe you did this shit.

141
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,370
I go maybe a little respect now
around king the staying, right.

142
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,760
You're your little fucking respect row.
Yeah.

143
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:18,110
He was looking at it as a
complete outsider who has
no idea. I told him, I said,

144
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:22,370
it's super intense and you're seeing
for the best fighters on planet earth,

145
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,010
you're seeing the very,
very best shootouts man,

146
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:28,570
the Kelvin gas to lump style
bender fight was it shoot out.

147
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:31,250
Best title fight from me
I've ever launched ever.

148
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,160
It's one of the best fights of
all time has to be. It has to be.

149
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:38,320
And when you see style under to get
rocked in the first one dropped.

150
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,070
You like Ho Lee Shit. I think he's
best thing that happened to them.

151
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,850
It's a good thing. I think it's a good
thing for career wise and going forward.

152
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,680
It's a good thing you
face a little adversity.

153
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,940
We see that he's not going to get
hit and crumble and you got one,

154
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,480
you got a special dude in style and how
good is Kelvin God damn. He's tired.

155
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:02,160
How fast? Our fucking hands. He's so
fucking tough. And even after all that,

156
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:06,990
I mean style bender was t and off on
human that fifth round and Calvin is

157
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,440
finding a way to survive.
Great incredible style.

158
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:14,350
Benders face looked like he was
allergic to shellfish and she sees

159
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,510
how quick the fourth round
he was helping the band.

160
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,860
He was in a war Kelvin hidden with
some bombs, man bombs. And it's also,

161
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:29,790
I think it's good. We saw, we saw a
sign, you get hit and get knocked down.

162
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,410
You saw him get taken down.
We saw it happens when he's off his back.

163
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:37,590
Look pretty fucking do it. He's
triangle. He's transitions locked up.

164
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:39,930
Who knows what the fuck would happen
if that was early in the fight,

165
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,460
they were dry. So I think that that fight
for [inaudible] checked all the boxes,

166
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,230
but also what's great about this is
Kelvin stock doesn't go down. No.

167
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,180
If anything, I'd watch that guy fight
whenever, whenever, and let's be honest,

168
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,310
he's really a welterweight.
Correct.

169
00:09:56,311 --> 00:10:00,280
He's super small for Deron
till can make 170 pounds.

170
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,490
So soaking Calvin, it's
a discipline thing. Yes.

171
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,800
I just think there should be more
weight classes. I don't even think it's,

172
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,480
I don't think he's to your boy,

173
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,780
Dana Man as well as 65 you
could text mean no one can.

174
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:13,320
No one listens to me and I don't
want them to really? Yeah, I do.

175
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,770
I'd rather just stay out here and talk
about it. Yeah. I want it to evolve.

176
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,380
But what happens if I pushed it? I've
said, I think there should be a way class.

177
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:24,360
Every time I get out outta here,
we could like dangle the carrot like Yo,

178
00:10:24,361 --> 00:10:27,840
we'll do a fight campaign every time a
one 65 or fights and just dangle that kit.

179
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,340
He's surprised it wouldn't do it.
Probably still wouldn't do it. It's um,

180
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,550
it's one of those things where like,
I think they'd like it the way it is.

181
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,260
If it ain't broke,
don't fix it,

182
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,020
but it doesn't make sense because if
you're going to do all these interim belts

183
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:42,630
went up to 65, I think they
belts on belts, on belts.

184
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:45,120
You think they would think
that it's watered down.

185
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,120
They have too many weight classes that
people would just be jumping back and

186
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:51,600
forth from weight class, which they would
be talking about chaos, which I love.

187
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,020
But you would also have people that
find a way class where they could be at

188
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:59,400
their best versus either have to bulk
up or have to drop too much weight and

189
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:02,640
compromise yourself. But you're happy
medium for a lot of guys that are not,

190
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,470
they're not hitting that
happy medium right now.

191
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,260
We were not getting their best
performance, but here's the thing about,

192
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,070
so if Kelvin's should be one seven year
style benders, a small lady, Fiverr,

193
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,610
he weighed in at one 83 up.
He weighed under the weight limit.

194
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,730
So look at how big some of these guys are.
Oh my God.

195
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:22,731
Brandon Davis to get the spicy 35 it was
one 60 dude that was branded neighbors,

196
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:25,350
right? Was it? Who said that? Well,

197
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,790
some of those 80 fibers like you
look at Jack Gray, get Yoel Romero,

198
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,850
Joe or mouth check. You antique dig
it looks like. We'll see what I mean,

199
00:11:32,851 --> 00:11:37,290
it's going to happen. Think about Yoel
Romero stop it. Like you'll rebuild Jack.

200
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:37,890
Dude,

201
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:42,470
it's a big fight style or could probably
make one 70 easier then fucking 85 85

202
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:47,310
is a a big way club. That's why you have
you seen the talk? It makes no sense.

203
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,700
Style Benner and Jon Jones.
That's crazy. What are we doing?

204
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:53,440
Who the fuck's picking up on it?
It's just cause they're talking shit.

205
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,570
I can't find it. Just the last
card. Just A, I see it right here.

206
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:00,640
It just says, yeah, he ballooned
back up to hundred 60 pounds,

207
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,790
but it was Brandon Davis right
from 35 he's really talented.

208
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,150
It's crazy when I'm standing next to him
and this guy waiting at 35 because I'm

209
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:10,240
looking at him, he looked to all
of 165 pounds. I was like this.

210
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,900
He looked so bees five 10 he looks so
big for that one 35 pound weight class.

211
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:18,370
So like this is crazy.
Well Max at 45 so fucking huge.

212
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,010
The UFC performance institute gave
him the green light to do that. Wow.

213
00:12:22,011 --> 00:12:23,290
So they must have known
what they were tilling.

214
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,620
Since David's site with Costa was a
first and the bandwidth division said he

215
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,330
needed to make serious
sacrifices to get there.

216
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:33,331
He said he cut out drinking alcohol's
Shit and ran 20 miles per day to line in

217
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:36,520
order to make the weight. By the
time he stepped in the octagon to 36,

218
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:39,940
he had ballooned back to this dude.
He's really big man.

219
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:45,100
He must be huge for the thing
is at the, the, he was also,

220
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,650
he was not just like tall, but
he's like, he's thick like you can,

221
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,370
it's weird how you can lose that much
weight, but why not just find a 45?

222
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:59,110
Why Kill Yourself? Like why fight at
45 he floods a beat and his last fight.

223
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,580
Well yeah. Has a beat. Macramed
Sharapov um, it's a beat.

224
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:07,490
Got Him in that crazy arm bar from the
back or leg. Leg Lock for the back. Yeah.

225
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,280
Which is so nasty from filthy back
mount fills nasty. There's two night.

226
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,680
I know. It's crazy. That's
a crazy move, right? I,

227
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,510
but I think when I think of one 85 hours,
think of Luke Rockhold. He shoot, man.

228
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,380
Yeah, it's a big ass. He's huge.
But then Whitaker's not like,

229
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,920
I think freakishly big. I think Luke's
done with 85 and he's at two oh five now.

230
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,220
He has a fight lined up already,

231
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,650
but I mean is he going to stay there
as he's just doing it for one fight?

232
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:34,810
Pretty sure he's staying there.
Probably a good idea.

233
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,640
But then you look at Whitaker
who's 85 such huge. He's stocky,

234
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:40,660
but he's not like huge.

235
00:13:40,661 --> 00:13:44,740
He's like the perfect size Whitaker
cause he's still can knock out anybody.

236
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,570
But he's got awesome cardio and too,

237
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,730
he's strong and he's not
as strong as Yoel Romero,

238
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,290
but he's strong enough to hold them off.
No one is who is, you got to get that,

239
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,520
that Cuban gene pool to get that because
you know what I'm saying? Like there's,

240
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:02,860
there's certain gene pools like that
fucking mountain from game of Thrones.

241
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,190
There's some gene pools
out there, man. Yeah.

242
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,060
And then we throw in steroids in that.
Oh, you do you see as unable to it.

243
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:15,060
Of course he did. Of course he did. Yeah.
Yeah. She was like, yeah, no shit. Yeah.

244
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,410
And then when they kept asking him about
it, they go, he currently taking us.

245
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,490
Listen, I don't really want to talk about
this. It's like, yeah, no, of course I am.

246
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:24,250
Why are they asking questions like that?
Yeah, it's the strongest man contest,

247
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:29,350
but think about, come on. Yeah. Look Dude.
Who's going to win? Who gives a fuck?

248
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,760
How about a style bender,
verse Whitaker the all oceanic fight.

249
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,270
Are you really going to fly to Australia
for that? Are you thinking about it? Two,

250
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,200
three, two dudes on this planet
and get me to fly to Australia too.

251
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,060
There's not it. No Dude's on
this planet alive though. Here.

252
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:50,830
Rather be here. You're
crazy. I love Australia.

253
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:51,990
But now if

254
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:55,280
Rihanna was like, Yo Dude, get to
Australia, I'm like, I'm on my way.

255
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,830
Say No more fam, but not two
dudes. Yeah, but that fight, dude.

256
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:03,860
I want to see that fight in the
flesh. Live. You're going to do it.

257
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,950
I think I might.
I want to see how that goes down.

258
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,880
I want to see fight Whitaker
is a fucking animal man.

259
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,120
Just thinking about how much pain that
guy had to be in to an almost fight with

260
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:19,640
a hernia and a ruptured, he
had a ruptured rectum, right?

261
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,500
Was it ruptured rectum, I thought was
just a hernia. No, it's fine. No, no.

262
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,650
I think he had two major injuries.
No,

263
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,040
I know his intestines were
popping through. Yeah, but
I think it was another one,

264
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,360
Dan,
his rectum was fucked up too,

265
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,390
isn't that it didn't have a
tear because I called a Jamie.

266
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:39,440
You'll find a hemorrhoid. No, no, no.
Like a tear in his ass. Well, you don't.

267
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,800
You think about the firehouse
drain from sparring.

268
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,920
Just think about getting taken down
while you're trying to throw a kick.

269
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,910
You land fucked up on your hip.
Never ripped my asshole.

270
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,430
You can rip your ass hole.
I'm just saying I never check.

271
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,570
You'd catch a kick in the ass
hole easily. For sure. Sure.

272
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,130
People whose eyes about
someone misses spinning back,

273
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:01,340
kick low and it just catches your tank,
man.

274
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,000
Just the heel hits your taint,
rips your talent away from the bone.

275
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,620
That shit happens.
I wonder what,

276
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,870
I don't know what the odds would be out.

277
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:15,920
Assume Whitaker is a slight favored
in that fight. I would say so, yeah.

278
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:20,840
I would say based off one to Elvin did
well based off with Calvin did based off

279
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:25,160
Whitaker's uh, two fights with EOL.
He's been the only guy to hold EOL off,

280
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,830
although some have said that. I did
think that you all won the second fight.

281
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:31,960
Interesting. I thought you, Oh, I think I
could go either way. It's scoring Yo. Wow.

282
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:34,610
Had them rocked and
hurt by the new scoring.

283
00:16:34,611 --> 00:16:37,670
I felt like it should have been worth
more. He thought she'd been a 10. Eight.

284
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,660
Yeah. I mean he had him almost out
hurt. He had them. He staggered.

285
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,210
We didn't see him do that to Yo al,
but,

286
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,220
but he did one more round and survived.
He survived. He wanted more rounds.

287
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:52,160
It's like how much are those the draw,
if you're watching a fight,

288
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:55,370
if a fight is a fight, if it was, I
mean, I not understand it. It's a sport,

289
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,020
but it's the sport of fighting.

290
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,230
If you're watching a fight and one guy
is really fucking a guy up and the other

291
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:06,910
guy never does that, who do you think
won that fight? Do you see that?

292
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,780
You're right. You can't. Yeah,

293
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,990
but do you think the guy that just moves
around and touches him with the Jab,

294
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:15,200
and I'm not saying this what Whitaker
did, but just, just as a, what if,

295
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,490
if a guy's just moving around for
four rounds and he's touching you,

296
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,170
the jab and lake kicking you and shut,
and you were like fighting in the street,

297
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,010
but then in the fifth round
you knock him down four times.

298
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:29,450
You beat the fuck out of him. He's running
away from you. His nose gets bloodied,

299
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,080
you end the fight with your hand
raised without a mark on your face.

300
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:36,110
You know the guy's face is pizza.
Maybe I'd look at my boys back, Dan,

301
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:39,450
for that first 20 that boy was moving.
Right, right, right. It's a quick,

302
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,000
it's a good question.
It's cause like what,

303
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:44,230
how much is that round as a sport
though? Yeah. That's what it is.

304
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,580
Because as a sport, yeah, to judge it.

305
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,070
If you're going to judge it
on a scorecard, you have to,

306
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,180
it has to be accumulative.

307
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,920
The question is like how much is it worth
for a guy to really take it to a guy

308
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:58,920
and almost stop him? See, I don't
think there should be more draws.

309
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,570
I don't have a problem with the drawl.
I don't have it.

310
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:03,150
Promise to drink with that fight. If it
was drama. That makes sense. Redo it.

311
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,350
Let's get it clear.
Club winner.

312
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,520
I think when a person gets really rocked
like that, it's worth more than a point.

313
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,790
I think it's worth more than two points.
I think it's worth a lot.

314
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,700
You think she'd be like ten seven? I think
it's a big deal. Got Done. You fuck you.

315
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,320
Fuck you are fucking real life
because of the rough. Well No,

316
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,450
cause you're kind of fucked,
right?

317
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,270
Like the idea that you
could go through a round,

318
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:27,570
you don't know who won right around where.
It's like a lot of feeling out,

319
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,980
a lot of touching, you know, this and
that and you know. Okay, perfect example.

320
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,730
First Round Anderson
Silva versus style vendor.

321
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,160
You could give it to style
bender for sure, but it was,

322
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,380
it was a round where they
were feeling each other out.

323
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:45,150
There was not one big moment where,
Oh my God, style benders taken over.

324
00:18:45,151 --> 00:18:46,320
This fight is almost done.

325
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,040
So that's ten nine but yet another fight
where a guy beats the shit out of a guy

326
00:18:52,171 --> 00:18:56,640
and doesn't drop him and
they have exchanges but the
guy gets rocked and hurt.

327
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,790
That is that ten nine to, I know it's
weird. What if he head takes them a drop?

328
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,460
Some of the guy barely survives.
You Hammer fists and attended the bell.

329
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:06,120
Is it ten nine in the old system it is,
but what is it in the new system?

330
00:19:06,121 --> 00:19:07,410
Is it ten eight but if it's,

331
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,390
even if it's ten eight I think it should
be more than ten eight like that kind

332
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:13,050
of went out,
but the only thing is your fuck.

333
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,280
Let's say do a ten six or ten seven then
you get dropped. It's going to be tough.

334
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,920
You got to get away to his g
argument against what I'm saying.

335
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,060
Here's the argument against it.

336
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,080
Frankie Edgar versus gray Maynard
especially the first one, right?

337
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,370
Gray Maynard drops him as him
badly hurt in the first round.

338
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:33,980
Frankie manages to survive and come back
and win enough rounds and win the fight.

339
00:19:33,981 --> 00:19:35,910
It's exception though,
but it is the exception.

340
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,610
It's kind of like if you gave him
like five points for that round.

341
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,170
Well it's kind of like with a Roundtree
and Eric Anders to how the fuck did

342
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:45,990
where people scoring those rounds?
Ten nine. Yeah. That's ridiculous.

343
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:48,270
The fuck are you doing a perfect exam?
What are you doing?

344
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,450
That's a promise that a ten nine
that was in a competitive fight.

345
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,260
How good is Roundtree look how good
you said something on the Brown.

346
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:59,690
He said that he likes and everyone's,
someone's booking a trip with cow shit.

347
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,770
Where the fuck was he at? They're
making fucking plane trips to Pooh cat.

348
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:09,480
My only thing is with that is once
the grappling like out there, hey man,

349
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:13,530
I don't know man, but get somebody to
help them get somebody that motherfucker,

350
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,590
he throws some of the nastiest inside
leg kicks and so fast and he was total

351
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:22,440
Thai style.
I wish I could lift my arms up shoulder.

352
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,310
You can tell you it and just style.
But he was a lady's leg dude.

353
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,260
His timing, his speed was off
the charts. He fucked his leg up.

354
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,920
I hope they are ganders posted a picture
today about it. But um, how tough.

355
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:38,940
First of all, how fucking tough as
Eric is. Coaches. What are you doing?

356
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,900
This is not a title fight.
There's nothing really on the line here.

357
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,800
It's just not his day. Couldn't ask
him to plan for financing to quit.

358
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,700
They just wouldn't ask him to quit.
He's so fucking coaches. Half the,

359
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:54,640
he's so tough. Crimson tide alumni
monster did geo Jon Anik said,

360
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,511
what'd he say?
He said it.

361
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:58,960
He goes and he loves winning
fights because then Bruce
buffer as to say your boy.

362
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,230
Oh really? Oh boy. Oh boy.

363
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,840
That's hilarious. He's a bad motherfucker.
Boy, he's a bad motherfucker.

364
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:11,410
Cause that guy does not
have a long history of mixed
martial arts like a lot of

365
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:15,550
these guys, man, way more athletic
than, than a lot of them. But look,

366
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:18,980
Kahleel athletic, it's fucked too, man.
You know, he speaks down to 20 pounds.

367
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,540
He was huge. And if
you met him, great guy.

368
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,630
He seems like a great guy to train
with them. Monster. I'm just,

369
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,340
well I was impressed when he knocked
out coconuts hockey and then um,

370
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,870
I know he lost a Johnnie
Walker who's just a beast.

371
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:35,380
I don't know what to make of Johnny
Walker. Ooh, he's care. I'm on the train,

372
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:39,550
but I'm kind of like, come
on. Where are we at? Me Too.
I'm pulling. I'm on the back.

373
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,390
Johnny. He's a bad motherfucker,
dude. He's something
special. He's just something,

374
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,120
I'm not hope he didn't hurt it's
fucking shoulder when he fell,

375
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,130
did that worm thing.
I hope.

376
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,400
I hope he didn't really hurt himself
because if we really hurt himself and they

377
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:54,070
can't fix that,
that would be a damn shame.

378
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,530
If the way he got injured is falling down,

379
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:59,290
playing around after
a spectacular victory.

380
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,870
I thought he came out and said he
was fine though. His man of Shit.

381
00:22:01,871 --> 00:22:04,900
He's fun would say that.
I would say that too.

382
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,270
You got to tell everybody you're fine.
We'll fix this.

383
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:11,260
We'll fix it does look like a fruit.
He's a freak dude. He has crazy power.

384
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,390
Carets he power.
He's scary.

385
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,420
And he got Kahlil with a an elbow with
close up when those elbows where your

386
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:22,910
hands up high in the clench. But
it was beautiful. Flatline them.

387
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,240
Who was the way he did it though?
Like the tech look,

388
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,970
anybody gets flatlined with that
fucking elbow and knee buddy.

389
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,610
That guy hits hard.
And how about that's the site.

390
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,200
That was the reason why Cleo went to
Thailand. This noise, it's beautiful.

391
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,480
And now he's all in. He's
like, he's moving there.

392
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,630
It's going to move his family there. He's
going to do all his camps. So intense.

393
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,530
It's so intense. But when you have
results like that, like I love it.

394
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,760
I love a story like that.

395
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,960
I love a story like that till a
grappa comes around goes, that's cool.

396
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:53,620
Thailand riding elephants and shit. Check
this out. That's what I'm worried about.

397
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,790
Who kept top team and a lot of those
places out there in Aka Aka Mike's quicks

398
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:02,740
place. They must have wrestling, I'm sure.
Right. Came out of Ak and that's true.

399
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:06,760
I see academy. But Mike Swick
wasn't exactly wrestling. Well he,

400
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,120
but he knows this deal always with
wrestlers though. You're right.

401
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,230
I mean he knew how to wrestle Swick do
everything. Yes, it's true. And he's been,

402
00:23:14,231 --> 00:23:17,490
the gay was, I'm sure they got a mother,
but is that where he's at? Ak k out there.

403
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,160
He's got his place out then I'll say. Is
that we're clear? Is that, I do not know.

404
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,840
I think he's at straight kicking on him.

405
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,860
I think he's doing the really
hard style drinking coconuts.

406
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,530
He actually yelled lady
boys, go to his, um,

407
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,150
see if can go to Clio Roundtree juniors
Instagram page because he posted thanks

408
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,990
after the fight. Was a lot
of people doing it. Well,

409
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:40,840
a lot of people are going to Thailand.
I think there's something to it, man.

410
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,080
Learning in the motherland
with those dudes, you know,

411
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,980
watching those guys work out and

412
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,100
train just to be in that environment.
It's like good for the soul.

413
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,850
Nobody would be like, he's the
nicest guy. Joe, the nicest guy.

414
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:55,700
That's caleel's Instagram.
That's me. And Him and his crew,

415
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,770
he used to work at like a MMA warehouse
and sell shirts when he's 300 pounds.

416
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:04,090
It was like, dude, I want to fight. That's
crazy. See if, um, there's a thank go,

417
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,190
go to the back to the, um, oh,
that's it right there. I'm sorry.

418
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,210
Go back to that one to see her there it
says teddy bear peachy indeed boxing.

419
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,750
See that? Click that. Click
on that. That's the dude
I'm thinking. Does the gym,

420
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,340
so he's with or that's one of
his friends came and pitched him.

421
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,680
He's training with them right there.
That's the gym there. Yeah. Oh,

422
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:28,580
that's not what I'm saying. Let's see.
I want it. Damn. That dude is in shape.

423
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,430
I want to say, listen, you want a
little Roundtree junior kicking you?

424
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,300
You're probably better off in that shit.
Fucking yeah.

425
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:36,320
You gotta be shaped like a test.

426
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,350
That dude was probably his pads
guy that helped him with his pants.

427
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:44,590
He's doing work, man. Damn. Look at
the legs on that fucking tattoos. Oh,

428
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,610
he's on that western diet son.
He's like,

429
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,330
pass on the Pad Thai and get me the
Donald Trump pad. Thai. Fuck that noise.

430
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,540
There's something too.
I think it's good for the soul.

431
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:00,470
Might be so being over there you mean?
Yeah. There's something about Kahleel man.

432
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,020
Oh, this is a t I Tammy's doing
this just to make us laugh.

433
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,680
Thank you son of a bitch.
Shut up to that guy.

434
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,220
There's something about being in a
place where something was invented.

435
00:25:11,221 --> 00:25:14,210
It must give you like some extra
juice ever done Jujitsu in Brazil.

436
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,560
No Man shall place. I mean they hate
white people put special place. No, no,

437
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:19,530
they hated,
but yeah,

438
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,890
especially when you're fighting Nogueira
doing jujitsu fight. No. Yeah, it was fun.

439
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:29,180
And your Jujitsu guy. Yeah. Yeah. You
came from Jujitsu. So for you to fight,

440
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:32,270
knowing that was a thing like, right,
like if you fought a Jujitsu guy,

441
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,640
and remember the early days,
if a Jujitsu guy fought Jujitsu guy,

442
00:25:35,641 --> 00:25:38,000
I'd be a real issue.
And that you're just a community.

443
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:40,280
Like why don't you fight somebody else?
Remember with the Anderson,

444
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:43,100
he didn't want to fight other Brazilians.
That's where we fought. Like towels,

445
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:46,520
ladies and Damien Maia. Yeah. It
was like the worst fights ever.

446
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,500
That's Ryan strange, weird.
The talus latest fight.

447
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:55,310
It's like almost like you just kind of
let them survive because it was Brazilian.

448
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,250
That's crazy. Like p one fuck each
other. No, I think it's like a,

449
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,820
do you think it's a nationalistic thing?

450
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,490
They think they made like they
take care of each other. Yeah.

451
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,890
Tail slate. This was good. He
wouldn't take any chances, right?

452
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,820
I think it's too much a respect
thing. Yeah, I think so.

453
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,330
So you think it was a Brazil thing?
Although with feet doorbell for silicon,

454
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:19,210
cool story flick to the face.
But,

455
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,150
but the thing with Damien Maia
was they had like a real problem.

456
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,690
There was some sort of like real uh,
animosity between them.

457
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,650
Cause Remember Damien Maia? I think the
mask. Yeah. No, no. That was a detour.

458
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,840
You're right. But he was yelling at
Damien Maia. I'll try it. And Damon,

459
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,760
this is disrespectful
percent some act this way.

460
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,730
There's something going on there.
When Ashton,

461
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,980
when he's fighting other Brazilians,
it sucked. And then he blew himself out

462
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,180
going after Damien Maia and then coasted
for the last few rounds. Remember? Yes.

463
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,160
That was a big deal.
Matt.

464
00:26:50,161 --> 00:26:54,210
It was in Dubai and Chris Weidman
fought on the same card and Bj Penn.

465
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:57,330
That's when Frankie Edgar beat Bj Penn.
Right? That's a new one. The title,

466
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:02,220
I heard the, I heard Khabib. Next fight
might be in Dubai in September. Whoa dude.

467
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:06,780
Khabib is pack your bags custody
versus Dustin. Whoo. That is,

468
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,590
that is going to be wild. That's
going to be wild. That's yeah.

469
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,970
That's how fucking dust man
Ken crack does and crack.

470
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,630
He can crack. I mean he's
a, he's an interesting cat.

471
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,170
It's like how good is he going to
be able to fend off that grappling?

472
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,380
How good can anyone fended off?
It's going to be hard. No one can.

473
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:27,990
It's going to be hard. I'll tell you
what, the fight is not. I had them on.

474
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,310
My show is just engaging and he was like,
do I love to fight Khabib? He's like,

475
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:36,720
what's he gonna do to me? I was like, take
you down to, I can wrestle my ass off.

476
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:39,270
And I scramble. That's where he
gets guys in the scramble. He goes,

477
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:42,630
and that's what I specialize in.
He's a wild man.

478
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,630
You know one thing I believe that
isn't all that believe. Well,

479
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,520
I believe you would want to fight.

480
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,780
I don't mean wild like
he's not calculating,

481
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,990
but I mean wild and that he takes risks.
Correct.

482
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,550
He calculates his ability to perform
in those risks, but he forces action.

483
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,840
He wants to carry the reason why he
forces action. It's definitely technical,

484
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,260
but he's, he's a risk
taker. He's not laying back.

485
00:28:07,261 --> 00:28:10,320
Like if we just talked about Anderson
Silva versus Talus latest, that was a,

486
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,490
that was not a risk taking fireball.
Fuck that motherfucker.

487
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,900
Never had fights like
that. Never. Just to gauge,

488
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:17,910
you know why he says he gets your soul?

489
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:20,040
He says he fights that way
because he doesn't have the car.

490
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,070
He goes out of the way. I fight. I
don't have the cardio to go fight.

491
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,450
Like my style isn't conservative.
I have to get it in two phases.

492
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,580
We'll with Khabib that those are issues.
Men. Yeah. Fucker. We'll go all five.

493
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,150
All five. And I don't know who's
going to beat Khabib. He's big too.

494
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,120
[inaudible] numbers can be,

495
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:41,730
can be struggled for 55 he struggled
can be scary until he got like his

496
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:44,610
nutrition on track member.
He'd had some issues.

497
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:48,360
He's a fucking phenomenal grapple.
I don't know who's going to beat him.

498
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,530
He's so good. His grappling soagain we
tied up Connor's legs in that first round.

499
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:56,940
I was like, Christ, this is early
on. I think maybe Tony Ferguson.

500
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,810
Tony Ferguson has a real good chance of
making it interesting because of his own

501
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:02,700
wrestling and it's scramble ability.

502
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:07,020
Tony's a wild screening for this 21st
seen gate. They're both available.

503
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,130
Everyone else's matched up.
It's pure chaos.

504
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,930
But I bet Tony is pissed and wants a
shot at the title, which um, you know,

505
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:20,931
he was on his way to that when his knee
ripped apart at a fucking promotionally

506
00:29:21,391 --> 00:29:24,840
tonight thing. So crazy tripping.
All the desires of freak incident.

507
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,690
Talk about a guy who
deserves the title shot. Yes.

508
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,890
And a guy who people have kind of like
forgotten in the mix of all these killers.

509
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,490
There's so many 55 pounders that are
just straight up killers, masters,

510
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,180
you know what I mean? It's
what a, what a wild do vision.

511
00:29:39,181 --> 00:29:42,810
You look at 55 70 85 that's,

512
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,940
there's never been a better time to be
UFC fans in his murderers fucking row.

513
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,950
It really is. You look at it, go, oh
Mike, I really like, I was looking up,

514
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:55,810
the matchups are stop. And I'm
like, what the fuck? He's a showy.

515
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,620
I look at one seven areas.
If you had to think of style,

516
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:03,370
bender is Joel Ramiro to scaries
fight. Pretty scary fight, right?

517
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,570
Scary for everybody. He's scary
for everybody. Still 40 years old.

518
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,740
Jesus Christ, every bit of it to
enjoy every bit of monster monster.

519
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,920
And so explosive and
the fucking wrestling,

520
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,450
his wrestling as on it's from another
planet and they get an explosive in

521
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,140
striking. Yeah, he'll fuck you
up. He'll spinning back fist. You,

522
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,110
you always got to worry about him
exploding nightmare because you've got to

523
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:29,580
worry about him exploding. If you try
to catch a break, if you like you,

524
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:32,770
you know you're standing on the outside
and your bolt breathing and you're

525
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:34,930
moving, you're like, maybe this
is a time I'm gonna catch a break.

526
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,600
And then all of a sudden he flying knees,
you in the face.

527
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,460
He didn't see a comment. And
whether you're Whitaker, uh,

528
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:43,320
style Ben or whoever wins that fight in
Australia, you're, you got Yoel Romero it,

529
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,610
yeah, he's number one. I'm
sure he's going to fight him,

530
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,140
but how much longer can he do that when
father time go y'all, you're special.

531
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:55,060
But yeah, let's go. Yeah, when is it,
you know, but Whitaker also might,

532
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,220
might,
the thing with Whitaker's,

533
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,170
he gets seriously injured after
every fight and has to have surgery.

534
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:03,100
When's that going to catch up
with him? Well, let's style
benders. Healthiest. Fuck,

535
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,521
that's true.

536
00:31:03,521 --> 00:31:08,500
But is it the shellfish but healthy is
when you're that good and you go that

537
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:08,951
hard.

538
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:12,340
I mean to train as hard as he must trained
to be as good as Robert Whittaker is

539
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,570
the human body. Like look, Cain Velasquez
is the great example of that, right,

540
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,270
for that explosive like those guys.
But he has unbelievable work ethic.

541
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:25,480
Correct. That's part of what it
is. Mad. Correct. It's just the,

542
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:27,130
the ability to push through pain,

543
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:31,200
the ability to just keep
working and working and
working and we're in crying and

544
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,520
attack and that way when
you're in those fights,

545
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:36,940
like a guy like Cain would put it on
people to the point where they couldn't

546
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:40,060
believe it was real. They were
like, this doesn't even make sense.

547
00:31:40,061 --> 00:31:43,240
Like how was he coming after me?
Still like how is he not tired?

548
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,100
What the fuck is going on here?

549
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:49,600
But you know who can do that and dish
decides whether or not he's going to do as

550
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:51,440
Jon Jones,
Jon Jones and do this,

551
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,130
what we're not suffering from those
kind of enacting. And John does.

552
00:31:54,131 --> 00:31:57,430
What style do you do? You're a grinder.
Let me show you how to grind. Yeah. Oh,

553
00:31:57,431 --> 00:32:01,060
you're a striking or you're a striking
the expert. Let me shed a strike. Yeah,

554
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,810
he's so fucking good man
style bender and Jon Jones.

555
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:07,930
Why are they talking shit to each other?
I didn't know what started it. Uh, yeah.

556
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,700
Um, John did a it, it originally,
it started, it did start with John.

557
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:15,640
He came out in the interview and goes,
you know, style benders looking good.

558
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:20,500
He's fine. 85 only a matter of time before
I think we cross paths, which is silly.

559
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,910
And then style bender, I think
TMZ asked him, he's like,

560
00:32:23,911 --> 00:32:26,300
guy or already beat one goat.
I need another one. You know,

561
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:30,130
I'm just getting started. But if you're
John, why are you even engaging in this?

562
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,810
Why are you pressing it down,
John? Because Sanchez, well,

563
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,810
it's great for John because he
wants to let everybody know, hey,

564
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,630
I'm the best motherfucker on the planet,
this guy.

565
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,860
But he wants to let everybody know,
like when he's,

566
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:45,380
when there's a car that's about
someone. I mean, he's active now, right?

567
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:48,320
Jon Jones got momentum.
Now think about where he's at right now.

568
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:49,580
He's in his thirties right.

569
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:53,550
Long Ass fucking career as
champion as the best every second.

570
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,310
He's on a run right now.
That's what I think.

571
00:32:55,311 --> 00:32:59,390
I think they took it away from him for
all those months when he tested positive,

572
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,180
that long suspension,
all that time off,

573
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,590
all money that he should have made all
the legacy that he could have laid down.

574
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,341
And I now,
I think,

575
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:10,990
I think he's just fucking chasing it and
the best about it all about it. However,

576
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,230
talking to 80 183 pounders,
kind of silly. Yeah,

577
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,420
but what if you say that in an interview?
I don't think that's that disrespect.

578
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:20,480
I don't either. By the way. He said it
is at one day maybe we're going to fight.

579
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,650
Yeah.
But then style bender,

580
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:24,320
you know TMZ ass and they don't
know shit about finding like, oh,

581
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:26,750
this guy's baked, this guy's big.
They're both black. Let's fight.

582
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,010
They have no idea. You know, that's
what they think. Right. So then,

583
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:34,850
then it gets picked up. But then also
I think Jon Jones is the hot, you know,

584
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:37,010
senior in high school and style benders,

585
00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:39,890
the new freshman who saw it and it's
like mean girls like fuck that dude.

586
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:44,110
It's also a wonder how much of this is
like they all agree is good for business.

587
00:33:44,111 --> 00:33:47,180
It's entertainment. It was looking
at cotton is anytime there's a fight,

588
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:49,650
blast something out.
Well not just blast something out.

589
00:33:49,651 --> 00:33:50,780
I mean Connor is real good about that,

590
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:55,490
but like the way he's
able to turn these shit,

591
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:59,360
talking back and forth into
publicity for fights. They are,

592
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,230
there is real shit talking is
psychological warfare, but it also hypes,

593
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:07,280
people love to know and like the Khabib
fight all the craziness that led to the,

594
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:10,820
obviously that backfired when could be
tried to fucking attack him after it was

595
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:13,720
over and was,
it was an email.

596
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,770
The other people punched him in
the head and all that craziness.

597
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:18,770
The Biebs never been bigger.
Look Khabib's never been bigger.

598
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:23,400
Connor's never been bigger. And yeah, I
mean he needs to fight. He needs to fight.

599
00:34:23,401 --> 00:34:26,840
He's a fight. He needs to fight. You
guys know this. I ride Connor's nuts.

600
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:30,050
I read compete nuts. Stomp enters
nuts. But with Connor, I'm like, God,

601
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,430
how hopefully something gets lined up,

602
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,920
but what I'm trying to say is like that
shit talking keeps you relevant. It was,

603
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,270
yeah, it's worth something. It's worth
something green. Both of them agree.

604
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,300
Like if style bender and Jon
Jones did decide to fight one day,

605
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,840
that shit's worth something to
both of them. Agree. Yeah. Agree.

606
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,850
Does a big gap between 85 and two oh
five though, man. John's a giant tool.

607
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,810
Fiverr,
John,

608
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,990
John could beat up any heavyweight
in the world with these could beat up

609
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:58,970
probably six of them in a night.
So to fight a one 83 or is weird.

610
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:04,190
Yeah. Well obviously he wouldn't be one
83 if style bender was going to do it,

611
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:07,170
I'm sure he'd want to put some,
some weight on. Imagine that just,

612
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,010
that's such a nightmare,
but it's the best.

613
00:35:09,011 --> 00:35:11,900
What makes style Ben or special cause
those guys same as mashed hollering.

614
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:15,440
He goes, I'll fight anyone.
Yeah, sure. That's, that's
what it's all about. Also like,

615
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,890
and this is not a knock on Santos or
you know, the level of competition,

616
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:21,500
but at two oh five there's really
nothing there he get excited about.

617
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:26,000
There's just not, you look at the other
divisions. Santos can be a fun fight.

618
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,320
He's going to be a plus 700
plus 800 underdog. So, you know,

619
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:34,670
but I liked that John's active. I like
watching John beat everyone's ass. Yeah.

620
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:38,640
It's, it's one of those things now
where you've got to find contenders

621
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,760
for John, right? Because there's
no one is really standing out.

622
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:44,500
Rockhold would be cool at
two oh five so heavyweights,

623
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,490
the Dominique gray has just beat. Who did
he beat? Did he fight on Rosedin Mirror?

624
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:52,350
No. Yeah, he did. And I didn't think
he beat him. And I'm a race fan,

625
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:55,170
but you can be dosed a minute. I thought
he'd lost. Yeah, that's what I was.

626
00:35:55,171 --> 00:35:59,130
How's it weird decision
that, so that one is, look,

627
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:01,320
Vulcans are very good fighter,
no doubt about it.

628
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,960
But you saw with Daniel Cormier
did to him. Neither one of them.

629
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:08,040
I ready for John not ready for John.
And I have in the same realm. Right. So,

630
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:11,100
but we were looking at Dominic when
we're like that kids really talented,

631
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:14,520
super pro, he's got massive potential
and I still think he does bell. Yeah.

632
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:18,390
You know, so he's just going to get
better from this Johnny Walker. Right.

633
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,750
But that guy might have blown shoulder.
Let's say he doesn't though.

634
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,420
If he doesn't, he's still thinking
we're fights away from John Jay.

635
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,950
He might be four fights away.
Here's the thing,

636
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:29,570
he might knock for people into another
dimension on the way to John Jones.

637
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,600
Like guy's something special.
That's what I'm saying. Yeah.

638
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,590
You got to knock those four guys out
so we can sell this. You do. He does.

639
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,600
I mean he's, he's put away to top
level guys a pretty spectacularly.

640
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,080
And um,
I mean you look at the way he fights too.

641
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:47,990
He's loose and weird and then boom, she
jumps on you and it's so special, Howard.

642
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,740
Dude. Fucking crazy power.
But I think with John, his
team smart, they're gone. No,

643
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:55,740
we know heavyweights there.
We're going to clean out to a five.

644
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,080
Ain't nobody been this room clear,
clean out.

645
00:36:58,081 --> 00:37:00,420
So we're considered the
greatest of all time.

646
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,680
Then we go to heavyweight and get paid.
While you know they wanted this fight,

647
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:08,010
they thought it would be a good fight
with Tiago and I think one of the,

648
00:37:08,011 --> 00:37:09,450
one of the things that it's a good fight.

649
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,140
One of the reasons why it's a good fight
is Tiago can shut anyone's lights out.

650
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,630
He knows he can shut anyone's lights out.

651
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,780
That mother fucker throws for the
bleach and used to fight at 70 no 85 85

652
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:26,310
[inaudible] 85 struggled to make 85 look,
he's big. He's big. He's big. A big dude.

653
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:30,600
It's fucked up fucking power that that
guy has and I hit the Manoa fight and he

654
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,970
just swings, man. He swings wild.

655
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,610
Now John is not going to fight him the
way man and will fall. I can't touch him.

656
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:40,250
You know John is going to keep money
outside of those kicks quench him.

657
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,530
He'll clinch them, wrestle them, take
them down. John's ground and pound.

658
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:47,220
His horrific is top games off the chart.
Missions are great submissions,

659
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:50,760
everything better.
Elbows are from hell,

660
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,370
from the top by sound gets
on top of you the best.

661
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,290
You're getting elbow to
oblivion and they're coming.

662
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,250
Well after the other FTI they
have to the other, but the,

663
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:04,370
in the wild exchange where he asked
to be careful is that that Tiago,

664
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:08,160
dude, Tiago Santos, we'll
swing with everything. Johnson,

665
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,280
he will throw it all in there.
John's me. They engage in that.

666
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:14,460
You're not going to see the opportunity.
I mean, that's what makes him so special.

667
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:18,130
Those guys that go, that's where your
one places to win. Watch this. Yeah,

668
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,380
he just canceled it out.

669
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,930
I don't think that he would
willingly wade into a firefight,

670
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,000
but I could happened, but it could
have. That's high cell fight, sir.

671
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,180
It could happen. See what John
is going to do if I had a gas,

672
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:33,720
it's try to further cement his legacy.
He's going to fight the best way he can.

673
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:36,130
He's got great coaches. They know
what the fuck they're doing. He's

674
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,750
going to go in there.
He's gonna kick that dude.

675
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,130
If he decides to clinch with them,

676
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,110
he's going to have a giant
advantage in the wrestling.

677
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,860
But he's got to be careful on the
way in, man, that dude will swing.

678
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,250
We'll try to kill you. He,
he swings in a different way.

679
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:52,030
He swings like this ain't making it to
the fifth round. There's no fifth round.

680
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:55,450
He's not even looking to get,
he's that guy is just every shot.

681
00:38:55,451 --> 00:38:58,240
He's trying to take the lights out. No,
I'm out. I'm definitely in a watch it.

682
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,300
He's a wild motherfucker man.
I think this is an interesting fight.

683
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,370
Jon Jones should be the strong favorite.

684
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,340
Should be a giant favor but it doesn't
mean it's not going to be interesting

685
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,520
because this dude's style
cause he's so fucking wild.

686
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,250
The question's going to be how's
he performed? How is he performing?

687
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,680
When that octagon door
shuts and you look over,

688
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:17,830
you see it's Jon Jones and
title fight the tunnel fight.

689
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:22,840
But I think one of the reasons why John
Talking Shit to style Benner is one of

690
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:24,730
the pros is we're talking about him,
right?

691
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,180
Because we probably want to talk about
him verse Santos on this show. Right.

692
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,080
If it wasn't happening, it keeps
them relevant. It's, you know,

693
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:36,100
he is probably the biggest name
in the sport now outside Connor,

694
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,150
the guy who's the most active him and
could be proud of the biggest names and

695
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:42,190
talking shit to stop Benner. I actually
think it helps style Benner too. Right?

696
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,380
Cause now he's associated
with the greatest of all time.

697
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,230
He wants to be the greatest of all time.
But when he just,

698
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:50,080
and it's going to get there and I
can't fucking wait when he goes,

699
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,200
I'm ready for heavyweight
him verse Francis.

700
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,130
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?

701
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,160
Himber Steve Bay cane.

702
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:04,090
Well they're probably Brock
Lesnar deal doesn't get done.

703
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:09,390
The talk is Steve Bay versus DC cause
the Brock Lesnar deal is not done now in

704
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:14,980
that whole process cause brought
lost. No, that's not real.

705
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,790
What WWE fuck he didn't know. I
thought it was real. I'm sorry.

706
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,830
Do you see game of Thrones?
I'll give you some more spoiled dude.

707
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,900
I did bet your sweet ass. I don't
talk about it. People get angry. No,

708
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:30,310
we will shut up. There are
dragons, DVR and dragons are real.

709
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:35,590
Um, they think that, you know, see
Steve Bay to rock might not fight.

710
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,281
They don't know.

711
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:39,010
Like my Brock has to decide this is
something he definitely wants to do.

712
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,840
Quit fucking given us blue balls and get
the fuck in there. I get the fuck out.

713
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:45,490
You know, he's got to make the
commitment and I know he's been training,

714
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:48,460
he's been training a lot training
and he's trained with some high level

715
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:53,140
wrestlers. I hope Michigan
to DC July. What's up?

716
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,810
Yeah.
And then July stack,

717
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:00,130
you gotta be careful with Brock memory
tag Randy couture and dropped him and

718
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:03,790
hammer fists at him into a blue.
Randy was 48 years old, but I hear Ya.

719
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,490
I hear Ya.
I like you're selling me on the twilight.

720
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:14,050
Remember how he smashed Frank Mir? Yeah.
It was terrifying. That was remarried.

721
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:17,500
Him and freight Katie and each
other and each fucked frank up.

722
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,910
Well cause frock on him with that
knee bar and he didn't, he uh,

723
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:23,980
he tapped the referee didn't stop it.
Dana White's STP meal chick,

724
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:27,130
not buck Brock Lesnar next and
like, Ooh, when did this happen?

725
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:33,040
Preconference oh wow. Well,
that's just the headline. He goes,

726
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,100
we don't know what Brock's

727
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,730
going to do, but if it doesn't happen,
it's Steve Bay. Oh this is one of them.

728
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,830
They got us, they got you.
They got it. You know,

729
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,760
better Jaimee exam could it worked.

730
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,770
We could listen to whatever click baity
farmers, they got us. I love steep Ayp,

731
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:51,500
steep ADC. I'm like, alright, yeah,
yeah, I need something spicy, man.

732
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,980
I get what you're saying.
And I get the Brock Lesnar appeal.

733
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:56,800
I would rather see steepest steep,
you know like,

734
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,420
cause you're a purist and that's
why I like you but not me.

735
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,890
I'm like to Perez Hilton up
MMA, not me sir. Out of respect,

736
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,110
because I know he deserves it.
He Won.

737
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,590
He defended the title more than any
human being that's ever held it.

738
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,110
He's the number one guy in
the heavyweight division.

739
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,320
So you have to rate him the
greatest heavyweight of all time.

740
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,690
If you look about accomplishments,

741
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:21,140
he's the greatest UFC heavyweight of
all time because he's not in terms of

742
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:25,880
accomplishments, just because he's done
it four times. Okay. You know DC beat him.

743
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:30,200
Obviously DC is supposed to mean if
you, if you had to rank him, you know,

744
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,490
like right now,

745
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:35,960
like one through 10 [inaudible] Frank Gcs,

746
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:36,680
number one,

747
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,260
because he's the champion and he
knocked him out to say he's number two.

748
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:41,960
It'd be silly,
but to say like the all time greatest,

749
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:45,800
most accomplished heavyweight.
Your boy Damon CTCs. Okay.

750
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:49,820
The all time most accomplished
greatest heavyweight is DPA.

751
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,280
You gotta take an count.
Well,

752
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:56,570
Kane never defended as many times
a steep paid did. The question is,

753
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,400
did Cain beat the better guys?

754
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,980
Did he beat junior dos
Santos from junior was young.

755
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:04,550
He before he had been through
those wars with Kane, right?

756
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:06,600
Because by the time Steve Bay got him,

757
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:10,280
junior had been in some wars and jr has
like really good late. He looks amazing,

758
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:15,020
but you can never discount that damage.
I'm not saying that he's not as good now.

759
00:43:15,021 --> 00:43:18,950
I think he's still phenomenal.
Now put the band back to the Vasa fight,

760
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,540
knocking out that toughest shit
man knocking that motherfucker out.

761
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:24,980
And the way he did it,
he looks good.

762
00:43:24,981 --> 00:43:29,300
Matt Dude is jds a Francis of a ESPN card.

763
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,920
That's not a paper view. I think
that's fucking does ESPN? I think so.

764
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:39,020
Stew a fucking cause you do and you do it
him around and he fought Derrick Lewis,

765
00:43:39,021 --> 00:43:41,390
right? Yeah. Stop Derrick
Lewis. Stop Derrick Lewis.

766
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,140
Look to junior dos Santos
still is an amazing fighter.

767
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,290
That's something July card.
Ah Fuck.

768
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:52,460
So I'm going to watch it when
Steve Pay beat. But you know what,

769
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:55,670
Steve Bay can knock anybody out
like that too. It's hard to say.

770
00:43:55,671 --> 00:44:00,290
You know what the problem is with Steve
Bay, the Prom is, is DC's fought what?

771
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:02,750
Twice since their fight.
But he's just been chilling.

772
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:05,810
Well he's been wanting this rematch.
Wait guy. Got It. I get it. But,

773
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,050
but it's a risky thing when you're a
former heavyweight champion and you're

774
00:44:09,051 --> 00:44:13,370
going to take a fight when you
rightfully deserve a rematch.

775
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,600
And what if you get hurt while you're
taking this fight? What if you get,

776
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:16,880
you know,

777
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,790
you have this fight and you get hurt
and then you have knee surgery and then

778
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:22,580
you're out for another year and
then DC loses it in DC retires.

779
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:26,240
He wants to fight him again. And the
way to find them again is to hold out,

780
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:29,870
to hold out this whole title. No.
Obviously the UFC wants to fight DC again.

781
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:32,070
That's the way it all now in

782
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,130
hindsight, cause lessons that happen in
John. John's not going to heavyweight,

783
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,310
but he's the third choice in all
this. Well, I fuck waiting for that.

784
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:39,330
I thought it was very interesting.

785
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:43,120
Herbs it John said that
to Steve Bay that John,

786
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:47,520
I don't think it's weird if we each
assigned thing the same thing we do with

787
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:50,880
style bender. He's just
fucking with everybody. He's
getting his name out there.

788
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:54,600
He's learning from Connor C
I think there's more to it.

789
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:58,010
I think UFC was fishing went, hey,
you down to fight steep and John went,

790
00:44:58,011 --> 00:45:01,770
y'all fuck ups DPA and what?
Steep. But he'd done fight
Johnny. Y'All fuck up John.

791
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,550
I think there's more to it. You think so?
What makes you say that? I don't know.

792
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,780
No reason at all.

793
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:10,860
Maybe they did have some preliminary
discussions as to whether or not the two

794
00:45:10,861 --> 00:45:15,390
would engage in fisticuffs. Maybe
they did. That's a great fight.

795
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,710
Great fight. He deserves it 100%
he deserves big fights, man. Look,

796
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:23,750
the guy doesn't deserve to be
forgotten. No, not at all. But again,

797
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,760
Francis and Ghana was one of the most
impressive heavyweight title defenses

798
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,320
because Francis was on fire.

799
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:35,550
He was so dangerous because they have
Francis ranked ahead of him now that just

800
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:37,710
be disrespectful.
But Francis has done world.

801
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,100
Steve Bay's gotta be the number
one contender. Know what?

802
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:45,650
B D C B as number one. Yeah.
Come after Barry. Have to be,

803
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:50,520
you never know with running path to
be have to be friends or your Francis.

804
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,480
Yeah. For Steve Bay be Francis. It's
that simple. Steve paid be tuner.

805
00:45:54,481 --> 00:45:57,730
It's that simple. I mean, come on man.

806
00:45:57,731 --> 00:46:01,950
I'm dude Francis dos
Santos. Oh my God. Dude.

807
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,680
I can't believe that's even happening.
Well,

808
00:46:03,681 --> 00:46:06,900
he gets dicey done that
heavyweight after six.

809
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,650
It gets dicey. Look, Ben Frances,

810
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,390
really 15 heavyweights in the world,

811
00:46:12,391 --> 00:46:17,280
Francis would take down defense Frances
with an understanding of what it's like

812
00:46:17,281 --> 00:46:22,281
to fight five rounds and Francis a
little bit more experience and uh,

813
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,360
they'll Santos fucking luck. Steve
Bay booked a Jujitsu match. I saw.

814
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,270
Did he bring it to do the magic?

815
00:46:29,271 --> 00:46:32,490
You blow your knee out had to match
and you can't fight for the title.

816
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,370
It was just two matches. It backfired.
It trust me. They're rough men.

817
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:39,810
And those big dudes want to fuck you up
to, he is going against right fights.

818
00:46:39,811 --> 00:46:42,750
True to fight to win one 10 and Cleveland,

819
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:47,520
please don't say it's a leg lock.
I please don't tell you. Oh No.

820
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,740
Or cyborg. Cyborg will rip
your legs apart. Or Gordon.

821
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:56,060
Ryan Gordon, right. I can't really do
that right now. Right. We're Gary Tonin,

822
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,610
Garrett Gordon. Ryan just tours needless
or no info on his opponent. Oh, okay.

823
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,180
Cause he's probably booking a
flight. He's like, see Ya dude.

824
00:47:03,181 --> 00:47:07,920
Your boy Ben Aspirin is fighting.
Yeah. Bill, the fucking not Mazda doll.

825
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:12,150
He's fighting Mazda at all. But I'd
say girls Ras. Isn't that crazy?

826
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:18,060
Crazy. And that's like make
six. I think. You know, if,

827
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,990
if Ben asking can really hang
with Jordan Burroughs still, dude,

828
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:27,420
I ain't saying cause everybody who
rolls with them. I've never, uh,

829
00:47:27,421 --> 00:47:30,220
I never even clinched with them.
But everybody

830
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,840
who's done everything with him,

831
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,290
the closest I came to a clinches like
that hug you do when you go hug a dude

832
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,350
over under a little bit
just to feel it out.

833
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:43,240
But they say that it's like
he's got forearms, they say,
dude, it's ridiculous. Oh,

834
00:47:43,241 --> 00:47:45,670
I've heard Jean Thomas was telling
me [inaudible] Thomas and St Dude,

835
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:47,560
it's ridiculous.
I feel like it doesn't even make sense.

836
00:47:47,561 --> 00:47:50,650
Bali waps world champions. We all
know. Yeah, just ranked offs people.

837
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,180
That's how good his wrestling is.

838
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:56,560
I mean if you see that fight with
Robbie Lawler, they'll fucking bombs.

839
00:47:56,561 --> 00:48:00,040
That guy took his fucked up in the fact
that he's still figuring out a way to

840
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:02,910
get ahold of Robbie Lawler's neck.
Did.

841
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,800
He still figured out a way to get him
into that head like once and Robbie knew

842
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:07,780
he wanted to clinch with him.
He couldn't keep him off.

843
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:11,290
I was sweating in that pike cause you
and I hyped him up so much as like,

844
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:13,180
oh please don't get
starts in the first round.

845
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:17,350
It's still super controversial ending to
me. What you had her bond. Would he say?

846
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:22,360
Well Herb said that first of all,
herb dean is the shit.

847
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:25,060
Nice guy. Couldn't be nicer. Great Guy.

848
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:28,620
But I love his perspective
so laid back and he,

849
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,910
his ego is so healthy,
like 20 talks about things like you,

850
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:33,850
you don't see any,

851
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:38,910
it's very reasoned thing but he's just
like chilled out and he's like very self

852
00:48:40,661 --> 00:48:43,750
deprecating and chilled out about it. But
he had a very good point. He was like,

853
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,630
that's not just a
manipulation of the neck.

854
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:50,080
Like in terms of like cutting off
the carotid artery because this is a

855
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,660
manipulation of the spine. It's
like a, a bit of a neck crank.

856
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:54,430
And he was thinking about that.
He was talking about like,

857
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:58,300
you look how he's got a hold of
the head and how is he goes real.

858
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:02,230
What I'm concerned with is if someone's
going unconscious for from some nerve

859
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,480
shit. Oh Wow. From a neck crank.

860
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:09,570
Like apparently he had seen a guy who
had gotten neck crank like that and then

861
00:49:09,611 --> 00:49:12,910
afterwards the guy couldn't walk.
He like couldn't move. It came back,

862
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:16,740
but for moments,
but for moments he couldn't move his shit.

863
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:19,090
We don't even think about it.
I'm like, exactly. Yeah, exactly.

864
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:22,170
That's why he's herb dean. He's the
gold standard. He's the gold standard.

865
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,550
It's big. John McCarthy and him
and big John doesn't do it anymore.

866
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:27,460
So it's a herb seeds, numero uno. And um,

867
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:32,380
just that when you think about and
ask her and says what he says is that,

868
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,840
see that's nasty dude.
It looks terrible.

869
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:38,470
That's nasty with the way he's
holding onto the head like that and,

870
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:41,650
and cranking your neck. I like
that. They're not very bad position.

871
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:46,000
I liked the UFC went. Oh, all right.
We're good. Yeah, I dig that. I get it.

872
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:50,290
I want to see it again. I, I,
I disagree. I think that, um,

873
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:56,530
I, I agree with herb stoppage and uh,
I, I see the, the, the arm went limp,

874
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:01,010
but then the thumb came up, but then as
soon as he let go, Robbie jumped up. Ooh.

875
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,390
Had me convinced that
Robbie was never out,

876
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:09,940
but herb had me convinced that it was
too dangerous for him to allow it to

877
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:13,120
continue. Once the arm dropped in that
weird way. So do you side with her.

878
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:16,930
You have to side with her in that
situation you have to side with herb cause

879
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:19,420
he's right because that
is a special circumstance.

880
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:21,070
See I looked at it in terms of,

881
00:50:21,071 --> 00:50:23,860
and I didn't even consider this when I
was talking to [inaudible] that I looked

882
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:28,040
at it in terms of it's just to choke
in her blue. No, it's a neck crank. Me

883
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,690
Too. So, but still I'd
love to see it again.

884
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:37,750
I'd like to see Max if they both win cause
asking Mazda Dall I know that doesn't

885
00:50:39,021 --> 00:50:41,710
get your dick hard.
Oh and Mazda dolls wall and then it,

886
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:44,390
let's ask him when's that, which is
tough fight to win. That's a tough one.

887
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,690
That say a Woodley and Lawler,

888
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:50,840
a lot of wins that then they find it's
even bigger. Would loop versus law.

889
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:55,380
We're though that's a tall
order after order for both.

890
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,810
Both fights. It's a tough
for both fighters to fight
to call either way. Yeah.

891
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:04,040
I'm, I'm really interested to
see how a Woodley bounces back,

892
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:07,580
but he spent saying all the right things.
I love with Lee. I love Woodley too.

893
00:51:07,581 --> 00:51:08,810
And one of the things
that I love that he said,

894
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:12,110
he said he didn't realize the value
of the title until it was gone.

895
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,270
And now to give you that understands it.
I mean,

896
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:17,540
I just think he really understands it
now that it's, it's not there anymore.

897
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:22,530
He's not the champ anymore and to get
beaten and it's not like a fight like s,

898
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:27,440
you know, you could make a rematch with
Calvin and style bender in six months.

899
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:31,820
True. You can back and forth. You can make
that rematch. Kelvin knocked him down.

900
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:35,790
Kaelin's fill that wasn't that kind
of fight. No. Who spend like so fight.

901
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:38,950
Who's smart and guy who smile looks
spectacular. Former champions,

902
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,870
Tyron Woodley and Robbie Lawler to meet
and UFC main event. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah.

903
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,720
It's booked. It's booked.
Yeah. Yeah. That's where talk
delivered Minneapolis, right?

904
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:51,470
Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm not going to be there
for that one fight. It's a fight night.

905
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,400
June 29th target center. That's
a hell of a fight. Imagine that.

906
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:56,180
That's a fight night.

907
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:01,180
Two former world champions and pro Robbie
Lawler physically and that looks so

908
00:52:01,311 --> 00:52:04,550
good shredded. He said he had this
crazy strength and conditioning program.

909
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:08,660
Super motivated. You know, dude, we
haven't talked about this on air.

910
00:52:08,661 --> 00:52:10,760
We talked a little bit at the
comedy store. How about your boy,

911
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:15,500
Tj Dillashaw both our boys. Yeah, that's
not good. She sees apology. Yeah, I did.

912
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,880
What'd you think?
Well,

913
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:20,240
I mean at least he's a just straight
up admit nothing I said you have to do

914
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,010
because then you're kind
of like, yeah, I fucked up.

915
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,720
Then people can't really come at you.
Yeah,

916
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,980
I mean he's being honest about it and um,
oh, I do have to correct something. He,

917
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:33,310
someone wrote an article that said that
Cody Garbrandt found out the TJ tested

918
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,710
positive for his fight too.
And Cody went crazy.

919
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,490
I think I got duped by a click baity
articles. Oh, we all got duped.

920
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:43,600
Everyone thought that and actually had
got us with a click baity articles and

921
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:47,480
everyone did. But I, I should have been
more responsible. So my apologies to Tj.

922
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:48,650
So they ha,

923
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:51,350
I don't think there's been another
one that they tested him on that he's

924
00:52:51,351 --> 00:52:55,220
positive but they're looking into it.
Now here's the thing. Well we have to,

925
00:52:55,221 --> 00:52:59,360
this is something that I know,
um, EPO is not always tested for.

926
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:04,310
Correct. And she, Dana, what'd
he say? Cause you sought as
expensive as fuck he was.

927
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:06,830
Hold on. You guys aren't, he
had, he didn't know. He goes,

928
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:11,150
you guys aren't tests for EPL every time
we paid this much money for you numb

929
00:53:11,151 --> 00:53:14,150
nuts to show up guys at three in the
morning and test them and you're not

930
00:53:14,151 --> 00:53:17,690
testing every time. And we paid this
much. He goes, I had no idea. Yeah.

931
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:22,100
Well time to cancel you side. Thanks boys.
Thanks boys. Thanks for playing. See Ya.

932
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,980
Everything has been looking good Jeff,
take it from here. Come back, be cool bro.

933
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:28,850
Yeah, next thing you know,
everybody's back looking thick,

934
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:31,590
thick and juicing now,
but they still, I see,

935
00:53:31,591 --> 00:53:36,060
I guess what they're going to do is
they're going to go back and see if they

936
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:39,390
still have the samples for when he did
beat Cody and test those for EPO. Well,

937
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:42,510
this is what you and I were talking about
where we're at the store and when like

938
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:46,650
how far do we go back? Dude, I'm telling
you, Joe, you don't want to go down that.

939
00:53:46,651 --> 00:53:51,120
I said, Oh, you're crazy tomorrow.
Let's find out what's real.

940
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:56,040
Why, why you want to do that?
You're crazy, dude. You can't do it.

941
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:59,940
You're gonna ruin the foundations is the
UFC. This is an intellectual exercise.

942
00:53:59,941 --> 00:54:03,930
I don't really want you to test them
all. Yeah, but if I was going to argue,

943
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:08,250
I'd say test tomorrow. I think
lined it up. What's fine? What's up?

944
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:12,750
We've always wondered half. We'd
not be easy. I've never wondered.

945
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:18,100
Do you want to test Forrest Griffin and
Stephan Bonner? You'll see that the,

946
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:22,710
the fight that catapulted the freaking
task. You'll see this, but then again,

947
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:27,120
test all the football players test all
the base everyone's feelings for me.

948
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,910
You Watch screwball. Did you
want screwball? No, I have it.

949
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:33,110
Holy Shit is a good bill at the
Billy Corbin document. Yeah.

950
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:38,070
Do you know what they did? Yeah, they
had little kids play a right. It's crazy,

951
00:54:38,071 --> 00:54:40,140
right? It's hilarious. The story.

952
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:44,100
The story's nuts cause it's in the people
who are actually there narrating it.

953
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:44,311
They're,

954
00:54:44,311 --> 00:54:48,750
they're telling the story and they got
these little kids playing a rod and

955
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:53,250
playing the, it's fucking great. Crazy
story though. That's a crazy story.

956
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:58,800
I feel bad for Tj, man.
You know what, man,

957
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:01,950
when everybody makes an
agreement to not cheat,

958
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,020
they're testing you all the time to try
to make sure that you're not cheating.

959
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:10,200
Don't you think that the environment's
different now than it was before you saw

960
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:13,560
it? It was instinct was initiated and
don't you think that's a good thing?

961
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:17,100
I'm putting words in your mouth. No ties
to phrase that question. Yeah. I was like,

962
00:55:17,101 --> 00:55:20,710
oh, come on. No, you're right.

963
00:55:20,711 --> 00:55:24,570
Writing it is better overall for the
purity of the sport. I think it's better,

964
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,910
but I still assumed guys are gonna
figure out a way to cheat because,

965
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:33,260
because pds in sports is no different
than than a referee or a judge or gloves.

966
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,120
They go hand in hand.

967
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:41,310
People have always done pds or
enhancements when in every aspect,

968
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:45,000
whether it's football, basketball,
and music, surfing, sex.

969
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:46,770
It's just what humans do,

970
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:51,720
especially when the odds are so high that
this little thing can help you achieve.

971
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,720
Maybe it gets you a victory,
but you know,

972
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,070
and then also with with
Tj Dillashaw is thing.

973
00:55:59,071 --> 00:56:03,090
Granted we know epls illegal,
but this is,

974
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:06,750
this one's a little different for tested
positive for like steroids or whatever,

975
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:11,880
like straight up steroids because if
you and I engage in a fight and we have

976
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:15,100
eight weeks of training and you go to
Mount Everest or where the fuck you want

977
00:56:15,101 --> 00:56:18,630
it to get your red blood cells higher
and then fight me back at sea level,

978
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,030
but I just stay here and
Jack those red cells.

979
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:24,100
You know the difference that

980
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,660
if you operate at sea level
and you are taking EPO,

981
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:34,020
you will be able to work much harder and
get more rounds in and you will recover

982
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:37,010
much better if you are up at altitude.

983
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,760
The problem is living in
training really at high out to,

984
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:41,260
you can't put out as much output,

985
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:43,990
but the night of the fight we're
going to have the same. No.

986
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:47,870
Why Epo have more labor? Yeah. Not
even close. No, you're getting,

987
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:50,050
you could have a stroke from that stuff.

988
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:52,950
I mean it depends on how
much you're taking. Yeah,

989
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:56,650
that was one of the things Novitsky was
telling me about where young cyclists

990
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,070
thick. They were just having strokes.
We are, boy I think it was lance.

991
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:01,540
I'm shine that maybe just on your show,

992
00:57:01,541 --> 00:57:04,830
but he would wake up middle night and I'd
have to ride a bike because I was sick.

993
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,820
That was my friend Salami. Do I
know Salami? No. No, I'll explain.

994
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:14,800
Okay. But you know what I'm saying?
Like it gets like bike racer.

995
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,870
You'd have the talent in
the middle of the night.

996
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:20,920
Lance did discuss how guys think.
That's what I got it. Yeah it's been,

997
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:22,860
we've talked about it.
Maybe Lance did.

998
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:26,110
Did Lance talking about having to get
up and where did you and I are talking

999
00:57:26,111 --> 00:57:28,440
about getting up in the middle of night
riding a bike. No, I'm just kidding. No,

1000
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,370
just kidding.
But anyway,

1001
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:34,570
obviously look that with
the Lance Armstrong thing,

1002
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:38,810
I feel like everyone was
doing it and you don't,

1003
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:44,200
you think Tj is the only one?
No,

1004
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:48,010
I think other people are taking EPO and
they're hoping they don't get caught.

1005
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:52,840
That's what I think. I think it's still
cheating. Correct. And I think, um,

1006
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:54,310
I don't think everybody's doing that.

1007
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,220
I think there's a lot of guys who
were doing it honorably. I agree.

1008
00:57:57,221 --> 00:58:02,020
Most guys are doing it
honorably. You know, I think
you could get it in your mind,

1009
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,500
but I don't,
this is just,

1010
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:09,640
is what to take from Max Holloway. It
is what it is, right? It is what it is.

1011
00:58:09,641 --> 00:58:12,460
What it is. It's cheating. Right.
He would, TJ would admit that.

1012
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:16,300
I'm sure he did a minute. Yeah,
he did. That's what it is. But

1013
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:22,510
I mean, I don't even know if have a point.
I don't know if I do either, but it's,

1014
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:24,400
but it's the guys trying to,

1015
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:27,390
I was going to say the guy is
trying to provide for his family,

1016
00:58:27,391 --> 00:58:30,500
but so is everybody else. Cody
Garbrandt, Mardi gras ramps. So as Henry,

1017
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,220
so Hutto so has everybody.
Everybody. He fights. But I,

1018
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:37,360
I would like to sit down with Tj and
I reached out to him since he's been

1019
00:58:37,361 --> 00:58:41,680
suspended. I want to sit down with
them and she's like, why would you,

1020
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:43,990
why did you do it?
Like what led you to this?

1021
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:47,830
Because his card has been great since
he was a child with his rather this

1022
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:51,610
wrestling background. At what point
along the way, was it six years ago,

1023
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:55,840
six fights ago. Did you think you need
to do this in order to beat these guys?

1024
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:00,370
Well, let's, we could look at one thing
that we know that he's been doing.

1025
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,200
He has a rigorous strength
and conditioning program
that training one time at

1026
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:06,890
that strength conditioning program
that he's doing it. You have,

1027
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:10,030
I have an issue with that.
I understand your issue,

1028
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,060
but that shit is off the
charts crazy difficult.

1029
00:59:13,061 --> 00:59:16,930
They're doing wild stuff and Madison
Ball work and plyometrics and all this

1030
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:19,280
stuff and Tj looks like a
fucking beast when he's doing it.

1031
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:22,080
Have you seen Brown Ortega's
workout with with is

1032
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:26,330
with Mike. Yeah. They do crazy shit
too. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,

1033
00:59:26,331 --> 00:59:27,380
I'm not justifying it,

1034
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:32,710
but I'm saying is that in
order to do that kind of work,

1035
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,610
like to put out that kind of pace,

1036
00:59:34,611 --> 00:59:37,880
your body's going to have to have some
time to recover in between workouts. Well,

1037
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:38,990
if you take EPO,

1038
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:44,380
that time of recovery is diminished
quite a bit according to Novitsky you're

1039
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:49,310
saying it allows guys to put in more
work so it doesn't just give you more

1040
00:59:49,311 --> 00:59:52,820
cardio, it allows you to recover
faster so you could train harder.

1041
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:57,230
And you know as well as anybody that
sometimes the difference between victory

1042
00:59:57,231 --> 01:00:00,080
and defeat is just having a
little more in your gas tank.

1043
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,680
Just having special at that,

1044
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:05,870
a little longer camp and
shot being injured or the
last couple of weeks we lost

1045
01:00:05,871 --> 01:00:08,270
some cardio. You know
those awful feelings. Well,

1046
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,240
if you had the opposite of
those awful feelings of not,

1047
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:14,510
instead of being compromised being his
hands, it's going to help you, thankfully.

1048
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,000
Exactly what's going to help your head.

1049
01:00:17,001 --> 01:00:19,580
You're going to come in there like
a fucking champion to that. Uh,

1050
01:00:19,581 --> 01:00:23,330
what's that song? He always comes
into, uh, give it away. Give it away.

1051
01:00:23,331 --> 01:00:27,530
Now that what? He goes? No,
he comes in. He comes the red
hot chili peppers. Oh Damn.

1052
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:31,380
Damn. Damn Dink. Dink, dink.
I always forget guys. Well,

1053
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:35,540
the only guy who's walkout music,
I always remember two, two.

1054
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,550
One was of course Matt Hughes cause
he'd come out to country board council.

1055
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,010
That fucking song.

1056
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:46,790
Who's the other Randy go tour when he came
out to strangle hold. Oh, interesting.

1057
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,420
Not Anderson Silva. DMX.
Oh that's right. Shit was,

1058
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:57,830
that was scary. Mickey galls got the
best one though. Where you think, oh,

1059
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:02,750
Mickey gets a file. Like come on
man. Or Boy, he's got a good one.

1060
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:06,590
The song, it's called Wonderboy. Oh is
it? It's pretty tough. Like wonder boy,

1061
01:01:06,591 --> 01:01:09,860
what is the secret of your powers?
It's pretty dope. It's awesome.

1062
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:12,650
Who came out to the game
of Thrones song though?

1063
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:18,050
Zone came at the game of Thrones. That's
pretty gangster. It's a little boring,

1064
01:01:18,051 --> 01:01:21,170
but you know, Shit's still,
it's something special.

1065
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,020
You see Deleah that fucking
Dork with his shirt off.

1066
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:28,130
Dude doing air violin to game of Thrones.
Fully committed,

1067
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:32,470
fully like he's so silly.
He's so fucking silly.

1068
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:35,270
He's those silly. Do you
think, uh, I've seen about Tj.

1069
01:01:35,271 --> 01:01:38,240
Do you think two years is good enough?
It's a good question.

1070
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:41,960
I think it is two years without ancient.
But here's the question.

1071
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:43,430
What are they going to do it?

1072
01:01:43,431 --> 01:01:48,080
What if they decide what of Cody demands
that they test his sample for EPO?

1073
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:49,610
That's a good question.

1074
01:01:49,611 --> 01:01:52,610
So let's say they can't test that and
let's say this might have already happened

1075
01:01:52,611 --> 01:01:55,130
and we don't know.
You'll know before me.

1076
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:59,330
So let's say that they go back and test
the two fighters. Cody, that'd beat him.

1077
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:02,480
So let's say both test spots for
EPL. I don't think they, well,

1078
01:02:02,481 --> 01:02:07,190
but let's say they did. That's three
brother. That's the three strike rule.

1079
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:11,270
You're out for life
man.

1080
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:13,280
Can they go back that far and do it?

1081
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,600
I mean this was being stressed.

1082
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:22,020
This would be the best
argument for getting rid of
a Novitsky says Dillashaw was

1083
01:02:22,021 --> 01:02:25,890
testify EPO in both files against
Cody Garlia chefs come back,

1084
01:02:25,891 --> 01:02:29,010
never came back negative. Okay. So,

1085
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:34,710
so he's good. Yeah. So He's good for
that. But they could go back to, you know,

1086
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:38,090
but go ahead and go. Cause he, if he
didn't do it during Cody Garbrandt fights.

1087
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,870
C'Mon dude.
Well,

1088
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:44,010
but also training at the training lab was
the first Cody Garbrandt fight when he

1089
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:45,320
was out of Denver,
was he?

1090
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:48,900
He was switching time and then moved
here per permanently because the training

1091
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:53,070
lab but also,
which was the first fight?

1092
01:02:53,071 --> 01:02:56,550
Was it the Cody garb and fight?
I'm pretty sure the first coding,

1093
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,880
the first one but also
at one 25 it makes sense.

1094
01:02:59,881 --> 01:03:04,770
You do EPO cause he cut in that
way and 25 Henry snap more.

1095
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:08,050
Yeah. No energy when he's trying to
train. Yeah. Yeah. Cause your wrecked.

1096
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:11,990
So that was the test is hot for at
one time. Yeah. And he was like,

1097
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,350
that was the only way. The
25 fuck, that's awful. Awful.

1098
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:22,890
Still
two 17 the Madison Square Garden.

1099
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:27,900
Okay. So that's it. Yeah. So that's when
he started, when he would do it. Right.

1100
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:31,110
It makes sense because he's trying
to get down to an ungodly wait dude,

1101
01:03:31,111 --> 01:03:35,850
he looks so bad when he was walking
around that day. Credit City the day.

1102
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,920
But no, no. It was more
than it was skeletor stuff.

1103
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,170
That's why I'm talking
shredded like an Ethiopian kid.

1104
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,710
If it was more like a like
somehow it was starving.

1105
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:46,920
It was like his face was not so sucked in.

1106
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:50,610
I was worried about don't this
like this just doesn't look good.

1107
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:54,360
It looks so sick.
He looks like an ultra marathon runner.

1108
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:59,220
Like one of those crazy dudes who's
just doing one every weekend. God,

1109
01:03:59,221 --> 01:04:03,910
I need to get like that. Um, what is
the one on the bottom? One 35 wow.

1110
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,700
He looks so much bigger.
It's crazy.

1111
01:04:05,701 --> 01:04:09,060
The difference in the amount of muscle
he carries on like his body eight muscle.

1112
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,070
What a nightmare.
What a bad decision.

1113
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:16,071
Go to one 25 and also to do it where he
wasn't draining himself that much cause

1114
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:21,501
he got down to like one 35 naturally
last 10 did that training lab.

1115
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:25,570
How and they have to do with
safe face. I get it. They,

1116
01:04:25,571 --> 01:04:29,460
but Tj came on my show and he's talked
about in other interviews saying how they

1117
01:04:29,461 --> 01:04:31,350
did blood work every day
and testing everything.

1118
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:36,300
You're telling me that when you insert
fucking EPO, no one had any idea.

1119
01:04:36,301 --> 01:04:38,670
You're doing it yourself.
And this is the other alarming thing.

1120
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:43,610
EPL is not a gateway drug. It's not like
marijuana. The drug's not gateway PDS.

1121
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:48,090
That's some black belt level shit is it?
Yeah. Talk to your boy lance about it.

1122
01:04:48,091 --> 01:04:52,410
You just don't start with EPO.
That's some high level shit man.

1123
01:04:52,411 --> 01:04:55,380
Cause think about your blood
thick. You got to read test, right?

1124
01:04:55,381 --> 01:04:57,810
You wouldn't want to start
with like some Anna bar. Yeah,

1125
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:59,690
little psych winstrol what's up babe?

1126
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:03,250
Look at the traps coming
in and so I'm always

1127
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,460
like Epl, some serious shit man.
It is serious. That's a very know.

1128
01:05:08,461 --> 01:05:10,410
Maybe someone came to
him. I was like, dude,

1129
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:14,730
better cardio at one 25 EPO is the
way to go and I know how to do this.

1130
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:18,130
Let's go down this road. Who Do you
think's going to be the first dude come

1131
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:21,840
along with gene editing.
Might be y'all. Remo

1132
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:27,580
is just a Cuban experiment.
Just so fucking crazy science project.

1133
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:31,140
God never gets old because
a Ninja turtle on a twitchy,

1134
01:05:31,141 --> 01:05:34,750
shy be looks exactly the same.
Why is happening here? Yeah.

1135
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,800
He doesn't age like a normal person.
Probably be some Chinese dude, but yeah,

1136
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:40,570
one day they're going to deal with that.

1137
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:45,600
One day there's going to be a person
who shows up who is ridiculously jacked

1138
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:51,100
that never gets tired and it fast as fuck.
It's fucked and everyone's fucked.

1139
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:53,470
If they figured out a way,
I mean,

1140
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:57,430
how much can they manipulate cardio
when your, when you have big muscles,

1141
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:58,510
that's what we're going to find out.

1142
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:02,680
You're going to find out if there's a
point where you can't like the physical

1143
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:07,000
structure, one holding more muscle and
you can't get any more oxygen through it.

1144
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:10,180
You only get, get to a diminishing
point of returns. You know,

1145
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:14,740
what are you going to do then? China
would be the first one. China for sure,

1146
01:06:14,741 --> 01:06:19,020
for sure. She's Jack Chinese. Dude.
Russia doesn't need it. We're an hey.

1147
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:22,480
They think they might have already
done something like that with Carolyn.

1148
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:26,220
Did you ever see Karalyn and his,
uh, his parents know that the,

1149
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,570
the crazy conspiracy theory
was always that Carolyn,

1150
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,460
who was one of the most feared wrestlers,
if not the most feared wrestler ever,

1151
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:37,270
who just would take 300 pound men and
hoist him through the air and they move

1152
01:06:37,271 --> 01:06:39,540
like a panther and he's a big giant guy.
Panther.

1153
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:44,040
His parents were small little tiny phone.
Wait. Oh Dude. They called an experiment.

1154
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:46,210
There was a picture of him and I
think it was sports illustrated,

1155
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:49,560
one of those sports magazines where he's
got his hand on his mom and his dad if

1156
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:54,520
the likes his children bro. He said, John,
I just be a freak though. Mike does that.

1157
01:06:55,040 --> 01:07:00,040
Like, I don't think shacks pants are
big dude. Holy Oh lets him with fader.

1158
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,900
Oh my God dude.

1159
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:06,940
I gigantic if go to that black and
white photo of him looking ferocious.

1160
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:10,030
There's a look at a picture of him
right there with the shirt right there.

1161
01:07:10,031 --> 01:07:13,960
Click on that one.
Click on that one whole ah fuck bro.

1162
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:17,170
Listen to his giant Tism we get
his chin dude. [inaudible] Rowe.

1163
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:21,100
He's got more than that dude. He's got
more than that. He's got more than that.

1164
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:25,060
How big is, he's not, he's fucking huge
man. Look at that picture with him.

1165
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,370
That's him, right.
Fuck. Look at that brow.

1166
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:32,470
He would pick dudes up and they
would go for a mother fucking ride.

1167
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:36,970
Guys would try to flatten out and lay
their whole body on the ground in hopes

1168
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:41,170
that he couldn't pick them up. He would
clench his hands underneath their belly,

1169
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:44,920
hoist them up in the air like a fucking
pillow case and smashed him on the

1170
01:07:44,921 --> 01:07:48,980
ground. He's the guy or American beat.
Yes. The big fat guy who lost all the,

1171
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:53,150
lost his toes in the winter.
Rulon Gardner. Yes. Yeah.

1172
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:55,060
We'll have him on here. No,
I never happened. I would,

1173
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:58,990
but brew Lawn Gardner beat him in the
twilight of his career and is not taking

1174
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:03,670
anything away from la but only beat
him by a point cause he made Corel and

1175
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:06,970
separate his hands as sumo
as a controversial new rule.

1176
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:10,510
It was like a controversial
new changing in point system.

1177
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:14,810
I can't believe I'm calling that correct.
Sure. I'm calling that correctly. A cow.

1178
01:08:14,850 --> 01:08:19,330
Rulon Gardner and that rush
and that's fucking right,
dude. He was so scary, dude.

1179
01:08:19,331 --> 01:08:23,720
He's Jack.
He was so scary and he had one,

1180
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:28,540
I think he had a fixed fight in Japan.
It looked like a work, you know,

1181
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:31,040
like they do those in Japan still do.

1182
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:36,440
It looked like he tension and fucking
Floyd with faith. What you think is real.

1183
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:41,030
100% oh Joe, you want to watch again?
We can. Why do you think it was fixed?

1184
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:44,950
Come on. Do you watch it? Yeah, I just
think of some bullshit. No, it was a,

1185
01:08:44,951 --> 01:08:49,190
a guy who's legitimate hundred
55 pound man who is fighting,

1186
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:54,020
crying and throwing around on the ground
due to fights at one 26 it doesn't make

1187
01:08:54,021 --> 01:08:56,150
any sense.
Never had a professional boxing match.

1188
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:59,980
How crazy was fighting
against the greatest boxer?

1189
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:03,920
Listen to what you're saying is so small
and tensions fixed and tensions there.

1190
01:09:03,921 --> 01:09:07,490
Fucking poster boy. Yeah, and they're
like, yeah, here's Floyd Mayweather. Dude.

1191
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,490
I don't think they thought he was gonna
knock him out. Really tensions a beast,

1192
01:09:10,491 --> 01:09:13,040
man. I mean he's the scene,
but when it comes to I have,

1193
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:14,930
but when it comes to boxing,
I understand that.

1194
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:17,960
But they were really
thinking he could hit him.

1195
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:21,890
This was the thought was that tension
is really a striking genius if you've

1196
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,770
never seen him. So Conor Mcgregor,
well, but no, no, but it's different.

1197
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:28,540
Tension is faster. It's
smaller. I mean he,

1198
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:31,190
he moves like a lightning
bolt and in Japan,

1199
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:34,580
the fact that this kid is
only like 18 or 19 years old,

1200
01:09:34,581 --> 01:09:36,500
crazy and been fucking people up,

1201
01:09:36,501 --> 01:09:38,960
including knocking out
world Moy Thai champions.

1202
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:42,470
So they threw him to the
wolves real early on. Okay,

1203
01:09:42,471 --> 01:09:45,560
let's watch this and tell me,
tell me why you think this is fake.

1204
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:48,350
I see a dude who is so
much smaller than Floyd.

1205
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:53,060
Look how little he is way smaller.
He's way smaller.

1206
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:57,770
Floyd is not even before messing around.
He's not remotely nervous.

1207
01:09:57,950 --> 01:10:01,460
This kid is a hug. I mean,
remember Floyd, last thing,

1208
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,580
I remember he didn't do this to
Connor, right? But this cookbook,

1209
01:10:04,581 --> 01:10:07,640
of course Connor can knock him out.
This kid can't knock him out.

1210
01:10:07,641 --> 01:10:10,400
Supposed to be the next big thing too.
He's a great kick boxer,

1211
01:10:10,401 --> 01:10:13,370
but he is not kickboxing.
He's boxing.

1212
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,670
You're not going to outbox
Floyd Mayweather when you've
never had a professional

1213
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:18,680
boxing match.
At least I don't think he has.

1214
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:23,000
He's had a lot of kickboxing though
and in kickboxing he's fucking amazing.

1215
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,360
But he's also amazing against
guys that are 126 pounds.

1216
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,640
So 18 to look how small he is compared
to Floyd Floyd. It's tiny. And Floyd,

1217
01:10:30,641 --> 01:10:34,220
look how easily Floyd blocks those
punches and he's not feeling any danger.

1218
01:10:34,221 --> 01:10:37,190
So he's just tides to put it on this kid.
He's walking him down.

1219
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,770
He's walking him down looking for
an opening. This is the first round.

1220
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:45,410
He waits. Boom. He cracks
him. Why would you whacks him?

1221
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:50,240
That's he just got us crack. You don't
think back it up. Back it up. Back it up.

1222
01:10:50,241 --> 01:10:55,210
Let's watch it again, dude. He cracked
him. Watch this right there. Here we go.

1223
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:57,710
Let it roll from here.
Get some of this corner.

1224
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:00,020
But he hit him with a
left hook to the temple.

1225
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,820
You don't see that left
hook to the temple. Watch.

1226
01:11:01,821 --> 01:11:04,250
Why aren't dark pink right there.
Thank you.

1227
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,690
He fucking cracked a dude who's a legit
30 pounds lighter than him here and the

1228
01:11:08,691 --> 01:11:11,900
temple and dropped to how?
Just watched the crack.

1229
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:14,470
You just watched it do doubt you a,

1230
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:19,110
that is a flying bat. That is a
form on left talk. First of all,

1231
01:11:19,111 --> 01:11:21,570
there was a stumble in there as well,
but he hit him.

1232
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:26,550
See The stumble after he got robbed.
That's a tough one. It's not tough at all.

1233
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:30,960
The kid gets up, he got wobbled.
They give him a standing eight count.

1234
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:33,060
He looks nervous as fuck.

1235
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:37,470
He looks over smash your fucking crazy.

1236
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:41,460
You think it's gone and now Floyd moves
in and the kids even trying to fire back.

1237
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:43,200
He's just not good enough.
Man.

1238
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:46,350
Floyd standard right in front of
him with his fucking hands up.

1239
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:48,960
The kid's got no chance.
He's much smaller.

1240
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:52,740
No experience against a guy as good as
Floyd and Floyd's walking him down with

1241
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:55,800
his hand. This is real, man. This is
real. That kid's trying to hurt him.

1242
01:11:55,950 --> 01:12:00,200
He just can't do it. He's fighting
the best ever. And then boom Collins.

1243
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:04,290
Don was that fuck up was not all of it's
read. The first one didn't look you.

1244
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,580
As you should know.

1245
01:12:05,581 --> 01:12:08,430
We've all seen guys get hit with shit
that didn't look like much and they go

1246
01:12:08,431 --> 01:12:09,690
down.
We've all seen it.

1247
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:13,400
We've all seen guys get touched on
the Chin and they fall down like,

1248
01:12:13,401 --> 01:12:16,290
you know Floyd,
look at this.

1249
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:20,130
Do you remember Travis Luder versus
Marvin Eastman? You remember that?

1250
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:22,830
A lot of people said that was
fixed. They were like, that's fake.

1251
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,540
No one gets hit with a
punch like that. No, no.

1252
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:27,120
Sometimes you come into a
fight compromised. Look,

1253
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:31,500
this is 100% legit one,
two right in the fucking head,

1254
01:12:31,501 --> 01:12:34,890
and he falls down. Dude,
this is 100% a legit fight.

1255
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:38,060
This kid got fucked up by the
best boxer of all chassis.

1256
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:42,840
They might say 126 tiny. None of this made
any sense in the first place, but yeah,

1257
01:12:42,841 --> 01:12:45,380
no sense. But you got to admit that's
a real fight that looked pretty legit.

1258
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:49,010
Like it's real. That's a real guy. That
first one, that first one is questionable.

1259
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,600
The next to work. Right.
It was a questionable,

1260
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:54,210
I'm just saying for the I in for my
first one, it look questionable to me.

1261
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:57,030
If you watched the whole
thing play out in slow motion,

1262
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:59,450
what happens is you see a left hook.
I was,

1263
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:05,030
if you see a stumble and Floyd moves in
and their legs tangled up a little bit

1264
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:08,630
and then Floyd hit some of the right
hand when he's on his way down. Floyd.

1265
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,570
Fuck that dude up.

1266
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,600
Did you see him all that handy pack
y'all sign with them now or is that just

1267
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:19,540
took me out.
I was watching the video at [inaudible].

1268
01:13:19,870 --> 01:13:22,510
He probably didn't even want to wear
a mouthpiece. The fucking Mafia.

1269
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:26,160
He fight in Japan.
This was a,

1270
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,350
this was in a sanction fight dude
expedition. No mouthpiece. They, oh yeah,

1271
01:13:31,351 --> 01:13:34,350
there's no, you don't need a mouthpiece
sent to, they let dose Carlos.

1272
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,530
Remember that dude? That
dude who wore the, um,

1273
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:42,750
what was the guy's name that wore the
wrestling mask when he fought cro cop.

1274
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:46,660
That was one of the best
cro cop Kaos of all time.

1275
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:50,970
Like a scene from a movie dose.
Carol's, is that who it was?

1276
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,090
I'm trying to remember
his name. But anyway, Cro,

1277
01:13:54,091 --> 01:13:58,200
cop hits this dude with the perfect
left high kick shin to the dome.

1278
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:03,210
The guy goes down like he got shot and
blood starts leaking under the just fuck

1279
01:14:03,211 --> 01:14:07,620
was he thinking dose Carlos? That's it.
So why? But when he lands his kick, dude,

1280
01:14:07,621 --> 01:14:10,950
the end is so crazy.
It's like a scene in a movie.

1281
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,520
Like I'll click a Quentin Tarantino

1282
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,030
movie,

1283
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:17,530
some dude who was a pro wrestler who
decides to fight one of the best cake

1284
01:14:17,531 --> 01:14:22,180
boxers of all time to treat
to MMA. Boom. Now watch this.

1285
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:25,670
Watch when they focus in on home boy
or these down, just take a month off.

1286
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:29,120
Let me say this, it doesn't it. Ah,

1287
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:33,490
when he was during pride, when it
ended, the dude is sitting there,

1288
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:36,130
you see blood trickling out
from underneath the mask.

1289
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:39,540
He shinned him to have a cro. Cop
had to retire. What's happening?

1290
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:44,380
I think of something in his, was it his
neck or his heart? It retire though.

1291
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:47,850
What? What was it? He had
a health scare. Oh Geez.

1292
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:50,470
You had like a small heart attack I think.
Does that right Jamie?

1293
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:54,910
Some health concerns stroke
and to retire on a stroke.

1294
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:57,700
And the thing with rob Whitaker too,
I was trying to bring it up,

1295
01:14:57,701 --> 01:14:59,670
but you guys were going too fast.
Dot.

1296
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:04,710
He had an abscess on his not torn rectum
in the same area and then because he

1297
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:08,160
was taking antibiotics for that,
he got chickenpox. God, Oh man.

1298
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:11,410
Which ones to have that and his whole
team was like, you're not fighting.

1299
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:16,270
She's still kind of want it to, but Jesus
Christ such, he had assistance rectum,

1300
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:20,680
he had the hernia and then an abscess.
An APP in your rectum.

1301
01:15:20,681 --> 01:15:25,530
It's like around some muscle tear,
like pus pocket thing,

1302
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,880
but probably from some sort of an injury.
Right.

1303
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,220
You can get it from a lot of
different things. The [inaudible].

1304
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:34,360
Have you ever had a hemorrhoid?
They're awful, nasty off. Well,

1305
01:15:34,361 --> 01:15:36,950
as preparation h works so
well. It doesn't work. Done.

1306
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:40,870
If you have a serious one and don't
give a fuck. Oh Man, I've had no,

1307
01:15:40,871 --> 01:15:44,140
I didn't let it go. I did like
dead lifts or something. It went,

1308
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:48,430
let's not do that and flared it up
the size of a small grape. Yeah,

1309
01:15:48,431 --> 01:15:53,020
they get gross. Oh my God. Are He
bleeds every time he shit's still. Yeah.

1310
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:56,890
That can't be held gotta
be bad. Right? I mean,

1311
01:15:56,950 --> 01:16:00,430
have you had with Jamie once,
but I just depiction Ari's,

1312
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:03,490
he'd like shows pictures of just like La.
Yeah.

1313
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,880
Lots of them sends you those Lavaris
text or tweet about a game of Thrones.

1314
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:14,050
Spoiler feels fuck you. I'm going to, I
want to talk about it. Yeah, stay offline.

1315
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:17,760
That's what I say. It happens to the
offline. I love game of Thrones. Yeah.

1316
01:16:17,761 --> 01:16:21,340
It was pretty dope last night. How? I
mean you can't give away any spoilers,

1317
01:16:21,341 --> 01:16:26,020
but how good are those? God Damn special
effects. They're good fucking dragons,

1318
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:28,850
man. There was a lot to get
this, so there was just,

1319
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:32,050
they had to like tie everything
together so it's slow.

1320
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:38,140
Yeah, it cut the shit they need. Like the
white walkers fighting. They also need,

1321
01:16:38,141 --> 01:16:40,480
let's be honest, you can't do
this hall in eight more episodes.

1322
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:43,930
You're lying to us or go into though.
Fucking study was only five.

1323
01:16:43,931 --> 01:16:45,910
I thought it was only six
total could be way wrong,

1324
01:16:45,911 --> 01:16:48,400
but they were there longer to that.
Like the last two or 80 minutes.

1325
01:16:48,401 --> 01:16:53,200
I think this first one's the shortest
one, right? Yeah. I thought it was eight.

1326
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:57,490
Isn't it crazy that the shows the most
popular show in the world and they're

1327
01:16:57,491 --> 01:17:01,230
going to stop it?
I wonder what they're just like good.

1328
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,930
Like the whole thing you always want if
you're in show business is to have the

1329
01:17:04,931 --> 01:17:07,030
most popular show in the world,

1330
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:10,020
but it's good to go out right at a lie.

1331
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:10,760
But I mean,

1332
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:15,760
you know how hard it is to get the most
popular fiction show and one of the

1333
01:17:16,731 --> 01:17:18,950
greatest fiction show,
if not the greatest ever,

1334
01:17:19,220 --> 01:17:22,370
and you're there in the peak of it.
How many people are watching it?

1335
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:27,170
Like help me watch last night, do you
think? Do you know how crazy that is?

1336
01:17:27,171 --> 01:17:31,820
17.7 million people watch
something on Hbo. That's crazy.

1337
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:33,740
You know,
there'll be like if it was fox,

1338
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:37,430
if it was just thinking like
Roseanne was like 40 million,

1339
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:41,780
it'd be off the charts because
everybody has regular channels,

1340
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:45,530
but everybody doesn't have HBO.
Especially today with Netflix.

1341
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:50,240
How many people would watch it
if it was on youtube? Oh my God.

1342
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:53,470
But what you're watching on
your TV? On Youtube. Yeah.

1343
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:56,600
Watch it all the time on my TV. On
Youtube. You do, you have an APP,

1344
01:17:56,601 --> 01:18:01,010
you use it and use it for Apple
TV. Well, no, I'm a, I have dish.

1345
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:04,460
I can just go to channel
three 72 and it's youtube,

1346
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:09,680
like click and watch all my shows. Three
72 on DIRECTV. Is Youtube a dish on dish?

1347
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:14,120
There might be three 70 lens. Netflix.
It's amazing that there's only one, right?

1348
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:15,500
Like there's Vimeo,

1349
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:19,030
but like youtube in terms of
like how much content is on Zion,

1350
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:21,760
they have a big competitor that
not a lot of people talk about.

1351
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:25,080
What's that porn hub for real though?
Yeah.

1352
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:27,580
There's a lot of people that I've had
to move and they put their content on

1353
01:18:27,581 --> 01:18:30,040
there, whether or not they're doing
like there's tits out or whatever too,

1354
01:18:30,041 --> 01:18:33,310
but a lot just uncensored and like there
are people actually making money on

1355
01:18:33,311 --> 01:18:37,450
there also. It's what the ads but
probably know what, oh I don't know.

1356
01:18:37,451 --> 01:18:41,800
I don't know how much they can visit
a ton. It was a lot of guys on there.

1357
01:18:41,801 --> 01:18:44,470
So pretty safe on the
book. Both websites. Those,

1358
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:50,040
when is VR porn going to really start
taking off when those headsets don't

1359
01:18:50,711 --> 01:18:53,910
become so cumbersome to where
you can't check off of the back.

1360
01:18:55,940 --> 01:19:00,030
Let's to a wall with a cord.
You just won't be able to relax.

1361
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:03,120
You know,
you won't be able to relax.

1362
01:19:03,121 --> 01:19:06,480
That brain tracking thing though would
be an interesting while you're beating

1363
01:19:06,481 --> 01:19:10,440
off. Want to find out
what's happening. Meanwhile,

1364
01:19:10,441 --> 01:19:12,390
Jamie's just thinking
about like animal attacks.

1365
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:19,680
No, it's Jamie price. Do we know how
many, uh, he can't even say users really.

1366
01:19:19,681 --> 01:19:23,130
But how many users does youtube? Half
compared to everyone cycling. Hello?

1367
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:25,920
So like you don't even have to
have an account to go watch it. No,

1368
01:19:25,921 --> 01:19:30,360
you don't have to log in or nothing. It's
really a crazy business model. Right.

1369
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:34,470
They figured out some wild thing,
let people to stream shit.

1370
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:38,190
And the thing about it is that
there's no one else like it.

1371
01:19:38,191 --> 01:19:41,550
Like where the fuck are the next ones?
There's nothing even close.

1372
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:46,260
I'll say this too. Like I've
never just go back to the fights.

1373
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:48,720
I swear,
swear on my life.

1374
01:19:48,721 --> 01:19:51,540
I've never done a legal stream ever
because I was thinking I was taking away

1375
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:53,280
from the fighters,
don't want to fuck them over.

1376
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:57,390
And when I couldn't figure it out and
I thought I might have to do that.

1377
01:19:57,630 --> 01:20:01,350
I got probably 2000 dms of links and not,

1378
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:04,210
and I'm just thinking of my cof this
out. People watch the fights. No,

1379
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:05,910
it's a real problem.

1380
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:11,070
Like I was in a shop before I came here
and the guys were fight fans and listen

1381
01:20:11,971 --> 01:20:14,570
to my shows and they go, man, I want you
to think of the fights. I'm like, yeah,

1382
01:20:14,571 --> 01:20:17,850
yeah, good. How'd you guys watch it?
And it's for young guys and they go,

1383
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:22,490
come on man, we're not paying 80 bucks.
You just delete your streaming. You know,

1384
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:26,580
tons of people are doing that, but I
think it's actually good for the fighters.

1385
01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:29,550
I think it's good. It's good
for their popularity. Correct.

1386
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:32,130
And that's all they care about because
the UFC is going to pay him a finite

1387
01:20:32,370 --> 01:20:33,900
number no matter what.
Yeah.

1388
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:36,360
And it's probably also good
for the sport that way too,

1389
01:20:36,361 --> 01:20:38,850
because more people see it more
people see how awesome it is.

1390
01:20:38,851 --> 01:20:40,770
The more people that saw that last fight,

1391
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:45,000
the more people are gonna recognize
how at the very best level,

1392
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,680
how fucking exciting this.

1393
01:20:46,681 --> 01:20:49,530
Because think about ESPN plus and
when you have to buy the paper view,

1394
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:53,430
you're limiting how many people can
see that by pine, these pay walls.

1395
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,770
So with these illegal strings, at
least for the fighter sake, everyone,

1396
01:20:56,771 --> 01:21:01,110
we can see these great matchups. Yeah, I
knew. I know what you're saying. You know,

1397
01:21:01,111 --> 01:21:04,740
like, but I'm always torn because
I don't want to go see a shutdown.

1398
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:09,180
I love the UFC. Loved the fucking UFC. I
don't. I want, I don't want it to do bad.

1399
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:10,470
I hope these numbers do great,

1400
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:14,490
but when I see what I have to go through
as a diehard fan, like my dad was like,

1401
01:21:14,491 --> 01:21:17,880
oh, I'm out. Nope, I'm not doing it. I'm
like, come on man. It's like no. Too much.

1402
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:23,250
So I'm wondering how many people did
that. I'm sure quite a few, but that's,

1403
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:27,150
you know, it is what it is. There's
nothing to cite. Max Holloway. Again,

1404
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:31,450
there's nothing you can do. Those
strains are ga is over. Yeah,

1405
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:33,310
the streams are going to exist.
Nothing they can do really.

1406
01:21:33,311 --> 01:21:35,880
I got to make it easy for
people to just get it,

1407
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:39,600
make it easier and once they make
it easier, once everybody's set up,

1408
01:21:39,601 --> 01:21:40,650
I think the numbers would go up.

1409
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:43,020
I think most people don't want to go
through the hassle of going through a

1410
01:21:43,021 --> 01:21:44,820
stream,
putting it on their television.

1411
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,870
Most people just want to be
able to tune in. Correct.

1412
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:51,300
And if you can get that ESPN
plus on everything, that's
the other problem, right?

1413
01:21:51,301 --> 01:21:54,840
If you have like direct TV and
that's the only way your TV set up,

1414
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:57,900
your TV is not set up for the Internet.
Correct. So then what do you do?

1415
01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:00,270
You know what, if your Internet
is not strong enough to stream it,

1416
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,120
even with all that, but then yeah,
if you, if you're not, that's fine.

1417
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:08,730
That's for everything. Yeah.
But, but that's for a fight.

1418
01:22:08,731 --> 01:22:12,270
But now if you're 18 to 36
$80 and let's say you just,

1419
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:14,490
you're struggling to get
by $80 a lot of money.

1420
01:22:14,510 --> 01:22:19,260
It's $80 for the whole year though.
The whole year of ESPN plus and the fight.

1421
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:24,070
So hold up. Yeah. It's not $80
for all the paper views. No, no,

1422
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:28,260
no sir. No, no, no. For Espn plus
a membership for a year. Correct.

1423
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:31,950
But it's going to see the paper views.
Right. Then it's going to pay 80 bucks.

1424
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:32,670
Yeah,

1425
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:37,670
but which she much would a year
cost of ESPN plus 60 60 bucks.

1426
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:42,860
So for $79 you get the fight and
a year of ESPN plus not paper,

1427
01:22:43,801 --> 01:22:48,390
he's not pay reviews. And
there's Tennessee, all the
fights. All the fight nights,

1428
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,580
every fight that you know
that it has happened.

1429
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:55,290
I wonder if you get to ESPN fights
as well as the SPM plus fights.

1430
01:22:55,610 --> 01:23:00,120
Yes. Yeah. Yes, but the papers of course
they would do that. Why wouldn't it? Yeah,

1431
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:04,970
so if there's 10 paper use and
they're $80 that'd be another did the,

1432
01:23:05,070 --> 01:23:06,070
the 80 bucks is just for

1433
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:06,790
the one deal.

1434
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:09,340
Just for the one they can do it again
and they might have other deals.

1435
01:23:09,341 --> 01:23:11,630
You might get to buy two for one
of the teacher who knows what.

1436
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:13,840
They can do a lot of
content on there now too,

1437
01:23:13,841 --> 01:23:15,580
because they put the paper views up there.

1438
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:17,560
They've put a bunch of
paper views up there,

1439
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:22,210
like the older fights like fight Passy
fight passed on his BN plus. Yeah,

1440
01:23:22,211 --> 01:23:24,610
you can get them a deal. Yeah. Yeah.

1441
01:23:24,611 --> 01:23:27,760
You could watch some old fighter
UFC fight pass just over then.

1442
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:31,660
I don't know what you can do with it.
There's other stuff on the five past.

1443
01:23:31,661 --> 01:23:36,090
It's not that you can't get on ESPN plus
flux and make sure I'm right about that.

1444
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,970
Did you just see stuff? That
kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1445
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:41,050
Five passes a lot of great shit,
but they have glory to

1446
01:23:43,230 --> 01:23:46,510
make sure that's true though.
That um, fight that uh,

1447
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:51,400
ESPN plus has older paper
view. I'm pretty sure it does.

1448
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:54,910
Really? Yeah. I'm pretty sure that in
the lead up to one of these fights,

1449
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:56,050
well then you can click on it,

1450
01:23:56,051 --> 01:24:00,790
but you can't go back and like say watch
UFC one 83 he can't. I don't think so.

1451
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:05,500
I don't know. No, no. I
think they might only have,

1452
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:10,090
that would be kind of cannibalizing fight
pass Cypass Dave aired maybe like they

1453
01:24:10,091 --> 01:24:13,240
only have the stuff that was there
at three ESPN, like from now on,

1454
01:24:13,241 --> 01:24:15,880
they'll have all that stuff. Like they're
building their library from this point.

1455
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:18,940
It must've been a pain in the ass,
but I know fight pass.

1456
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:23,440
Like what?
He's two 29 that could be,

1457
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:27,100
it could be buck on or you
can watch on here. Oh yeah.

1458
01:24:27,101 --> 01:24:29,610
So that does have only certain ones.
Yeah,

1459
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:33,430
there's only certain one 97 is on here
also and I don't see anything. Okay.

1460
01:24:33,431 --> 01:24:36,160
So it's not all of them, but
there's some, so your record,

1461
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:40,450
there's some bus pass we can go
through and see what you can see.

1462
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:41,450
Everything you see,
every

1463
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:46,480
pride fight and I'll see
if I passed for me is like,

1464
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:49,270
I like throwing up some shit
that I've never watched before.

1465
01:24:49,271 --> 01:24:53,730
Like some Moyie Thai like were, you know,
just some dudes I've never seen before.

1466
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:58,390
Yeah, I love doing that. I liked doing
that when I work out for whatever reason.

1467
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:01,510
I'll, well ESPN now though,
but like on ESPN two,

1468
01:25:01,511 --> 01:25:05,140
those throw up like classic fights at
Max all the way Brian or take was on

1469
01:25:05,410 --> 01:25:08,680
Connor. Nate Diaz too was like, I'll
watch the hose when I'm working out.

1470
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,270
But again,

1471
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:15,271
with all this ESPN and buying this and
7,989 I've never been a dark web guy.

1472
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:20,920
And when I clicked on us, I'm like, dude,
this is a problem because it's so good.

1473
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:24,700
It's so good. And then when I talked to
the young, like fans around, they're like,

1474
01:25:24,701 --> 01:25:27,460
yeah man, why would we pay $80?
I'm like, I can't tell you.

1475
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:30,430
Cause I used to always think you'd
be fucking over the fighters.

1476
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:33,160
Do you understand the
tech knowledge behind it?

1477
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:37,390
Do you know how they would stop it? How
do you stop a stream? I have no clue.

1478
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:41,710
As from from our, I've watched,
they've never, they've,

1479
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:44,040
they can fight them but
you can't stop them when,

1480
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:47,740
but when they were suing people.
Yeah, my buddy got soon. Really? Yeah.

1481
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:49,060
He put on his gym.

1482
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:53,680
Put a paper you on as Jim
[inaudible] play or a pill? No, no,

1483
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:56,770
you just had it on for free. He paid
though. Whatever the WHO ratted him out.

1484
01:25:57,250 --> 01:26:00,700
I don't know. They are, they can track
the Ip address and we're like, hold up.

1485
01:26:00,701 --> 01:26:03,860
This is a gym.
Well you owe us this much cause you,

1486
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,860
and they looked at the capacity or
this how much it is if to do that.

1487
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:10,460
So he paid just this whatever, six,
nine, 900 at the time and would hold up.

1488
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:15,560
You're doing it from a public gym. It
fits 300 yours, whatever. 15 grand. Oh.

1489
01:26:15,561 --> 01:26:19,120
So he made the paper view.
So he paid for it like on a slab.

1490
01:26:19,121 --> 01:26:22,940
Individual streams going on a big
thing they don't fuck around, man.

1491
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:26,810
This is also for us only. So for people
that are outside of the United States,

1492
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:30,170
the ESPN plus thing doesn't want,
it's not for them.

1493
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,820
They still watched through fight
password. Okay. They cannot,

1494
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:36,080
they also get it on the regular networks,
pts or whatever.

1495
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:37,050
They don't have all that.
Yeah.

1496
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:40,340
Like English fans were making fun
of me when I was having problems.

1497
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:42,920
Like you fucking
Americans. I'm like, yeah.

1498
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:48,400
So in England they could watch it for
free. A lot of it. Yeah. Yeah. In Brazil,

1499
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:51,620
they don't have a paper view thing. In
England, the way we have it here, they do,

1500
01:26:51,621 --> 01:26:56,570
but it's cheaper. Like when Joshua
fights like 1999 oh really? Yeah. Huh?

1501
01:26:57,710 --> 01:27:01,400
Why are we soccer's like, what's
going on? Is that what it is Jamie?

1502
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:06,410
We're willing to pay for it. Yeah.
Yeah, man. If someone's fighting it,

1503
01:27:06,411 --> 01:27:09,310
it's a crazy fight and you've
got to pay 70 bucks for them.

1504
01:27:09,311 --> 01:27:12,140
It makes people bought Floyd
Mayweather Pacquiao for 100 bucks.

1505
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:17,270
Is that what it costs? Yup.
Nine 99 never gotten cheaper.

1506
01:27:17,271 --> 01:27:19,220
From what I remember my
whole life it's always been,

1507
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:23,040
it's always been expensive bucks.
Yeah. It seems like it's always, yeah,

1508
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:28,070
it's always in the like (599) 096-0990
nine something like never like cheap.

1509
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:32,020
No, it's not cheap. There
are wild encounters.

1510
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:35,870
I panicked though when I couldn't
figure it out and I knew for my favorite

1511
01:27:35,871 --> 01:27:40,040
fighters, I panicked. Yeah, dude,
listen, I love working for the UFC,

1512
01:27:40,250 --> 01:27:45,250
but I used to fucking love watching and
I still love watching a good paper view.

1513
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:48,230
I love the paper view,
comfort of my own home.

1514
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:52,910
Nothing better to sit and down kicking
back the watch it all play out.

1515
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:57,560
Listen, if I did watch it on the dark
web, I'm saying I did, but if I did,

1516
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:01,820
I did buy a style benders shirt to
give back to you. See? That's good.

1517
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:07,080
So you still get somebody how much to
stop Mendix 7 cents I've seen not just DM

1518
01:28:07,161 --> 01:28:10,740
and him $80 just start selling
his own church. I think you can.

1519
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:14,090
I wonder if you can. You can't. I don't
think so. Right? You have to sell a deal.

1520
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:18,110
It has to be through Reebok that
happy cetera. If that's the truth.

1521
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:22,570
I'm sure it is. Don't you think
like, do you think fighters are they,

1522
01:28:22,571 --> 01:28:23,610
they must have some sort of a,

1523
01:28:23,611 --> 01:28:27,590
a garment in apparel deal cause they
all have like style bender tee shirts.

1524
01:28:27,591 --> 01:28:31,820
Like everybody has a, uh, you go
buy a t shirt with Yoel Romero,

1525
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,670
but you,
I bet you can still sell your own shirt.

1526
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:38,450
He thinks [inaudible] like a unknown
fighter would be prevented from doing that

1527
01:28:38,451 --> 01:28:42,500
would be a little strange to
stop from trying to be fucked up.

1528
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:47,620
But if you're stopping to think
Conor has Conor Mcgregor August shit,

1529
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:51,290
what does that he his own line of
clothing. Yeah, but that's like a,

1530
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:55,220
that's not athletic. Yes. Yeah. And that's
not athletically or that's David August.

1531
01:28:55,221 --> 01:28:58,120
That's, he's like, he makes suits. He
makes the suits that I wear for the UFC.

1532
01:28:58,150 --> 01:29:02,220
You're right bro. So can he, as a fighter,
you cannot have your own shirt and slang

1533
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:04,470
it. I don't think you can. I don't know.

1534
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:08,910
I'm not a businessman.
I'm not sure.

1535
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:12,320
But I would think they have an apparel
deal that they would have Reebok. Yeah,

1536
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:15,900
like I know that I low you
that [inaudible] Ramiro shirt,

1537
01:29:15,901 --> 01:29:18,990
which I almost wore today. I forgot
to wear it. Which she did dope shirt.

1538
01:29:19,070 --> 01:29:22,800
Great Buck three buck shirts. Do you
see the style band Reebok shirt? No,

1539
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:26,700
fucking dope. It looks like the
Matrix. He's all different colors.

1540
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:30,870
She was sick.
That fight was sick man.

1541
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:34,870
He showed who the fuck he is and that
fifth round he showed who the fuck fucking

1542
01:29:34,871 --> 01:29:36,900
is. Great fight. That was a great fight.

1543
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:40,440
In that fifth round he
went out there like them.

1544
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,160
They both won the fucking chapters.
Both dead.

1545
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:48,060
They did both go out that way to style.
Bender eventually got to him that lab,

1546
01:29:48,061 --> 01:29:50,520
that fifth and final
round. Woo. And you know,

1547
01:29:50,521 --> 01:29:55,140
and that's what he said when I interviewed
him that he just felt like he was

1548
01:29:55,141 --> 01:29:59,340
ready to just throw it all
out. He's talking to himself
with to that fifth round,

1549
01:29:59,341 --> 01:30:04,050
he's seen something like this. Saint,
something to that. Yeah, that's it.

1550
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:08,670
I mean he decided to go out
there and be a champion.

1551
01:30:08,970 --> 01:30:10,740
You to think about if,

1552
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:13,530
let's say Francis becomes world
champion was definitely possibilities.

1553
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:17,160
Number two, you've got three
African champion. Boom, boom. Yeah.

1554
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:19,950
Well when if Daniel Cormier,

1555
01:30:19,951 --> 01:30:24,150
he decides to retire and
Frances keeps getting better.

1556
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:27,810
I mean Francis only been doing mixed
martial arts for what, five years?

1557
01:30:27,811 --> 01:30:31,640
Four months.
He's,

1558
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:36,970
he's so powerful man. He's just what
I told him, I told him wait it out,

1559
01:30:36,971 --> 01:30:39,210
let DC do his thing and
you just go do your thing.

1560
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:41,360
Cause he was kept saying I want
whatever it gets me entitlement.

1561
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:43,770
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not fight DC.

1562
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:46,080
Let him go out and do his thing.
Then you go,

1563
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:50,190
what that dude needs is a best friend
who's a super heavyweight wrestler.

1564
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:53,820
Correct. That's a tattooed needs.
Just a best friend who was like, Bro,

1565
01:30:53,821 --> 01:30:56,610
I'm not going to hurt
you. And he you, yeah

1566
01:30:58,510 --> 01:31:01,230
that guy is like 55 I'm
saying a guy like that,

1567
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:04,380
you should watch a wrestling match
with them cause it was so preposterous.

1568
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:09,680
The way would hoist guys up in the air
see if Google Carell and slams toothfish.

1569
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:14,310
No, no, I've heard of him.
Yeah. When I saw him it,

1570
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,640
I recognized, I had a picture of him on
my Instagram, said that I looked at it.

1571
01:31:17,650 --> 01:31:19,560
I used to have it in my
favorites on my iPhone.

1572
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,880
I pulled up every now and then just to
remind me of what a pussy I am. Dude.

1573
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:26,820
That's the one. Him with him
grabbing the guy and all the fucking,

1574
01:31:26,910 --> 01:31:29,760
the teeth and the muscles,
he's such off. It's crazy.

1575
01:31:29,761 --> 01:31:34,170
Like our American beat him rule on
gonna beat him. He's all chunky. This,

1576
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:39,250
look at this. Watch how he had hoist guys
up in the air. You guys, you'd be like,

1577
01:31:39,251 --> 01:31:42,810
who please don't serve. That's
embarrassing. Watch this.

1578
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:46,830
What the fuck? Oh, he hit you.

1579
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:51,570
He's just using the ground,
but look how devastating it is to you.

1580
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:55,680
Boom. He's driving you with
all his fucking weight,

1581
01:31:56,280 --> 01:32:00,190
all that momentum and power and
he's knocking you the fuck out, man.

1582
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:03,440
Holy Fuck. Powerful Reebok
sweatshirt. Yeah, look at that.

1583
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:07,270
Reebok back in the day was
sponsoring Karalyn dude,

1584
01:32:07,271 --> 01:32:11,530
he's so ridiculously the little boy's
wrestling, that's all. Yeah. Has.

1585
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:14,530
Who fucks are going to find
another seven foot three guy?

1586
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,840
It'd be nice to get into
either Reebok shoes.

1587
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:21,100
Look at fucking monster man.
How tall was a Carolyn?

1588
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:23,290
I think it was like six
nine or something like that,

1589
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:29,400
but just Denise was the undefeated
for like ever for years.

1590
01:32:29,410 --> 01:32:32,350
Six three it says, he says the
only six. Three. That seems weird.

1591
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:36,730
That doesn't see it. He was undefeated
for forever. Oh Man. He was at when?

1592
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:39,820
When he was fighting,
I think it was 300 plus pounds.

1593
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:45,150
Was it say there to 85 okay.
He's 51 now.

1594
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:47,640
God Damn, that guy was a
girl. How do what he does now?

1595
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:51,030
I think he works here with
wrestlers. Holy Fuck. I mean,

1596
01:32:51,031 --> 01:32:55,030
I think you know that whole Russian
program they, they probably have a very,

1597
01:32:55,090 --> 01:32:59,550
very prestigious position.
Yeah. Was He undefeated forever
to rule on beaten? Yeah,

1598
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:01,260
but again,
the way he beat him,

1599
01:33:01,470 --> 01:33:05,910
if you could please Google that because
I think Rulon Gardner beat him and this

1600
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:09,480
does count, but by getting him to separate
his hands, looking that up, the reserve,

1601
01:33:09,690 --> 01:33:10,980
they had to do a video review.

1602
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:14,580
Even if something that happened and then
rule on was awarded the point and then

1603
01:33:14,581 --> 01:33:17,010
I made a Corolla and be extra aggressive,

1604
01:33:17,290 --> 01:33:20,850
kind of 84 inch chassis said that was
really hard for him to get his hands

1605
01:33:20,851 --> 01:33:24,390
around in the first place. Yeah, that's
right. Rule owns a big fella thick.

1606
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:28,410
Remember when rule on fought MMA?
Yes. Last and people that Jab,

1607
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:30,660
this was like getting hit
with a bottom of a dumpster.

1608
01:33:31,770 --> 01:33:35,910
Then he lost his dad cause you could still
pick anyone on a hike and got lost in

1609
01:33:35,911 --> 01:33:39,300
Colorado. Must his toes and
fingers. No, I think he was um,

1610
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:43,140
a snowboard on board. Yeah. I think
he's known will be snowmobiling.

1611
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:47,890
He was snowmobiling and it broke
down and he got frostbite. Hostos.

1612
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:51,000
He lost at least one toe and
I think he kept fighting men.

1613
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,570
I think he fought even,
I think he fought in Japan.

1614
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:55,710
I think they let them wear
shooters. Oh, that's right.

1615
01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:59,340
They let it let you were wrestling
shoes. What's he doing now? I don't know.

1616
01:33:59,341 --> 01:34:01,600
He was on the biggest
loser. All that. True.

1617
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:05,940
Then he had eaten a lot after
he retired from fighting, bro.

1618
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:09,810
He was so big country fed son for
the size of that motherfucker.

1619
01:34:10,110 --> 01:34:14,800
That was when he was on the biggest loser.
He was morselate got some tits high.

1620
01:34:14,801 --> 01:34:18,120
But look at him in pride.
Go to go to Rulon Gardner and pride.

1621
01:34:18,121 --> 01:34:20,880
When you see him in shape as a a,
an MMA fighter,

1622
01:34:20,881 --> 01:34:24,750
you realize what a dangerous guy he was.
He was in an enormous man.

1623
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:28,070
Everyone should be thinking their lucky
stars that Russia freaked into side

1624
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,780
looking at him right there. Look
at them in the far left, far left.

1625
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:34,680
That picture dude. Um, that was uh,

1626
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:38,490
who did he fight there? He
ain't skinny. That's Ah,

1627
01:34:38,491 --> 01:34:42,180
that's God dammit.
That's the, the judo guy.

1628
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:47,440
Fuck God dammit. I can't believe
I can't remember his name.

1629
01:34:47,950 --> 01:34:51,620
That guy was witnessing, weren't they
two Olympic medals and say that is done.

1630
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:55,180
I see. They're both Olympic
gold medalist. Right. Just go.

1631
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:58,010
Go to rule on gardeners. Um, MMA.

1632
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:02,690
Wikipedia. Did he go Yoshida. Oh,
Yoshida. That's right. Exactly.

1633
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:05,490
Yoshida started out.
Um,

1634
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:10,710
he was a gold medalist in judo and
was fighting with the Guiana. Yeah.

1635
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:13,700
Cause I remember that fight because
either that's what medalist,

1636
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,050
I forgot about Yoshida,

1637
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,930
how another great fighter that was
fighting during the pride days.

1638
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:22,910
But here's the point. Rulon Gardner
was so much bigger than him. Dude,

1639
01:35:23,230 --> 01:35:26,420
pull to go back up and you see that
photo of the two of them standing there

1640
01:35:26,421 --> 01:35:29,510
right there, Jamie? The
one. Yeah, that picture.

1641
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,150
That's how you get to just an,

1642
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:35,660
an understanding of the difference in
size one didn't have that many fights

1643
01:35:35,661 --> 01:35:37,760
though, dude. He was so big.

1644
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:42,620
He was smashing that dude with a jab to
like he was beating him with a jab like

1645
01:35:42,810 --> 01:35:47,210
Yo, she was getting stunned
by this giant heavyweight jab

1646
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:51,980
and Rulon Gardner. Yeah. I think,

1647
01:35:53,660 --> 01:35:56,210
I don't know if he really, if that
was his first love though, you know,

1648
01:35:56,211 --> 01:35:57,980
I think you'd be really loved wrestling.

1649
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:01,100
He said he's burnt out of wrestling too
though. Yeah, I remember seeing that.

1650
01:36:01,101 --> 01:36:04,010
And then you went to MMA. That's tough,
man. After all the years of wrestling,

1651
01:36:04,011 --> 01:36:05,630
especially at that international level,

1652
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:07,760
how many of those guys
do you think at the,

1653
01:36:08,090 --> 01:36:12,050
in the top echelon of amateur wrestling?

1654
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:15,470
If they just decided, you know what, fuck
this, I'm going right into MMA right now.

1655
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:19,250
Like how many of those guys would
be a giant nightmare for everybody?

1656
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:22,490
All of the above. All of the above.
I'll think about Jordan Burroughs.

1657
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:23,511
You kidding me?

1658
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:28,511
Kidding me is athleticism dude and world
class experience and work ethic and

1659
01:36:29,151 --> 01:36:30,380
just the knowledge and like,

1660
01:36:30,510 --> 01:36:35,510
oh the mental fortitude it takes to become
Jordan Burroughs city aspirin and him

1661
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:37,131
are going to go out.

1662
01:36:37,131 --> 01:36:41,380
It will ask her and is in the middle
of embarking on a career African. Well,

1663
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:45,560
if he takes him down, that would be
insane because that's possible. Is it?

1664
01:36:45,850 --> 01:36:46,311
I don't know.

1665
01:36:46,311 --> 01:36:49,640
Wrestling that well to the point
where I just aspirin stand a chance.

1666
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:51,950
We're going to get lit up
on the Internet for this,

1667
01:36:51,951 --> 01:36:56,150
but does he even stand a chance? I
was that crazy. No, I think he does.

1668
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:57,410
I don't think you'd take it if he did it.

1669
01:36:57,590 --> 01:37:00,830
I don't think he would take
it if he didn't either. He's
just smart. Yeah. I mean,

1670
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:05,810
I want to say I'm, I'm very
curious. I just so hard,
dude, you got go ahead. Good.

1671
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:10,220
Yeah. Good odds for it. If there's odds,

1672
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:13,130
why would imagine Jordan
Burroughs gotta be the favorite?

1673
01:37:13,131 --> 01:37:16,160
Because I got to see how big
it was or something. Yeah.

1674
01:37:16,161 --> 01:37:20,780
Because aspirin has been fighting MMA
for so many years now with one and then

1675
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:24,620
before that with Bella tore the ballot
tore one is such a weird situation

1676
01:37:24,621 --> 01:37:27,590
because he was clearly dominant and
clearly their champion and they just let

1677
01:37:27,591 --> 01:37:30,710
them go, you know? And uh,

1678
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:35,270
I'm really excited about him and Mazda
at all because if there's anybody that's

1679
01:37:35,271 --> 01:37:40,271
going to be able to give him a really
hard time by being sneaky and creative

1680
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:42,373
and,

1681
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:46,730
and using slick counter punches
and having good wrestling,

1682
01:37:46,731 --> 01:37:49,110
takedown defense and good,
good defense and,

1683
01:37:49,260 --> 01:37:53,330
and he wrestles with a lot of big guys,
big powerful guys.

1684
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:54,770
He's a slick customer.

1685
01:37:54,930 --> 01:37:58,470
That's a real interesting fight because
he has such a giant advantage on the

1686
01:37:58,471 --> 01:38:02,220
feet, especially coming off of
the, uh, the Darren till fight,

1687
01:38:02,610 --> 01:38:06,120
him being able to knock out Darren till
like that. That's a giant statement.

1688
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:10,260
I mean, Darren till is a
legit experts. Stryker,

1689
01:38:10,261 --> 01:38:14,460
I mean he's a lightening
fast knockout puncher,

1690
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:18,360
knockout kicker,
nasty moitai skills.

1691
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:23,550
And to see Mazda doll crack
him like that and drop him.

1692
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:28,050
So it's like this, this is,
there's never been a better time.

1693
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:31,630
Like Sean and I were saying to like,
like fights. There's never been been,

1694
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:32,400
no one's ever,

1695
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:35,430
there's never been a better group
of champions and contenders either.

1696
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:37,710
It's like everyone is
at the top of the chain.

1697
01:38:40,260 --> 01:38:41,640
So what were you pulling up right there?

1698
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:45,030
Uh, trying to find that. If there is
odds on the fighter with what's going on,

1699
01:38:45,031 --> 01:38:47,310
it's like a charity event apparently.

1700
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:51,960
So I don't know that they're also fire
fighting, but they're weighing in.

1701
01:38:51,961 --> 01:38:56,070
It's 74 kilograms, which is one
63 puts that up so I can see it.

1702
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:58,153
It's a little,

1703
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:05,340
it's one 63. Oh Wow. So, so
Ben's got to lose some weight.

1704
01:39:07,090 --> 01:39:10,500
Um, he could do that easy though. I'm
sure. Say too much more about it. Really.

1705
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:14,700
It's that one 63 apparently the
Jordan Burroughs, Ben Aspirin match.

1706
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:20,670
Brendan shot back from PN. How much? Boy,

1707
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:23,370
that's the best feeling in the world
and you have to Piss for a long time.

1708
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:29,010
Ah
hmm.

1709
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:32,870
Very interesting. Very interesting.
I'm looking forward to the W.

1710
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:36,420
Where can you watch it is? I don't think
it's a paper. If you think right online,

1711
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:40,230
is that what it is? It doesn't
say. I'll definitely pay for that

1712
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:48,340
wrestling doc. I'm on the dark
side. Don't, don't go. No,
I'm not going to take four.

1713
01:39:48,350 --> 01:39:51,570
Definitely pay $80. She got
sued. Magic. They went after you.

1714
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:55,350
This is allegedly allegedly
allegedly, right? I, I'm so happy.

1715
01:39:55,351 --> 01:39:59,270
I'm ESPN plus cardholder. Oh,
there you go. And I can treat well,

1716
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:02,880
you should be able to illegally stream
and no one should say shit. Why?

1717
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:06,450
If you're a cardholder? Oh No, no,
because it doesn't get for the paper view.

1718
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:08,970
I tried giving my money.

1719
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:13,970
To me that's a bold move on the UFC is
part to go with ESPN plus for all their

1720
01:40:14,461 --> 01:40:16,080
paper views.
That's a bold move.

1721
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:20,340
I mean that's like when apple
got rid of the CD tray. What?

1722
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:25,290
It's a little shocking, but I'm sure
the figure it out. Yeah, yeah. Dude,

1723
01:40:25,291 --> 01:40:28,770
your ESPN employee now it
looks like congrats. Well,

1724
01:40:28,771 --> 01:40:33,330
I'm a independent contractor. That's
what the fighters say too. I am,

1725
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:38,220
I'm an, I'm an independent contractor.
But to watch you have to have ESPN.

1726
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:42,620
Yes, I paid for it. I love you Stan.

1727
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:45,690
So I grew up with ESPN. Listen man,
I think it's good for the sport.

1728
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:48,600
I think what is going to be
these huge gaps aren't great,

1729
01:40:48,601 --> 01:40:53,010
but the future is in streaming
the pictures in something
on the Internet. 100%.

1730
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:54,010
It's a as

1731
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,700
long as everyone.

1732
01:40:55,701 --> 01:40:58,090
And see right now there's a lot of people
out there that got fucked because they

1733
01:40:58,091 --> 01:40:59,620
had,
they might have a nice TV,

1734
01:40:59,621 --> 01:41:02,560
but it's not set up for the Internet
and they couldn't set it up in time.

1735
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:06,810
So it's going to take a little bit of
an adjustment period, you know? And,

1736
01:41:06,920 --> 01:41:10,090
and eventually, you know,
some people don't want to go.

1737
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:13,660
I have to go out and fucking buy
something that's Internet ready,

1738
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:17,380
like a TV that's internet ready,
like to watch it on your TV.

1739
01:41:17,381 --> 01:41:18,520
If you got a TV at home,

1740
01:41:18,521 --> 01:41:21,370
you'll see you've got satellite and you
don't know how to fucking set up your TV

1741
01:41:21,371 --> 01:41:23,110
for the interviews.
He's not painting on those people,

1742
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:26,050
the bank on the people who figure
this shit out and the future.

1743
01:41:26,140 --> 01:41:31,140
But what I'm saying is it's going to be
a bit of a learning curve for a lot of

1744
01:41:31,781 --> 01:41:34,280
people. For the absolutely.
No, this is how to do it. Yeah.

1745
01:41:34,290 --> 01:41:36,940
So that's why it's a bold move.
But you have to do it,

1746
01:41:36,941 --> 01:41:39,190
whether it's now or in six years,
you have to do it.

1747
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:41,650
You don't want to do it in six years
because then everybody would already have

1748
01:41:41,651 --> 01:41:45,760
done it. Dude, I support the movement.
Yeah. You gotta be there in six years.

1749
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:47,170
So six years down the line,

1750
01:41:47,171 --> 01:41:50,620
everybody knows paperview tonight on
ESPN plus that's what they're gonna say.

1751
01:41:50,890 --> 01:41:54,400
They're gonna say, dude,
paper view tonight on ESPN,

1752
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:58,780
ESPN plus Erbitux in six years.
Just ESPN.

1753
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:03,470
There won't be any plus I bet everything's
digital interest. Yeah, which is the,

1754
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:04,930
it's,
it's a good move.

1755
01:42:05,050 --> 01:42:09,980
It's funny because the only reason to
have regular TV for a lot of people's live

1756
01:42:09,981 --> 01:42:13,060
sports, regular people, like
a lot of people like look,

1757
01:42:13,061 --> 01:42:18,061
you can get a whole fucking
year of whatever TV show
you want to watch on iTunes

1758
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:22,840
or you can watch Netflix and
now Youtube has sports. Right,

1759
01:42:22,841 --> 01:42:27,280
but you remember how much it
used to cost to get like cable,

1760
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,850
like how much Kaylee used to cost,
how much direct TV used to cross,

1761
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:32,860
how much did it cost while I,
while yeah,

1762
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:35,650
I did have a dish sponsor for like
less eight years. Then they were like,

1763
01:42:35,651 --> 01:42:36,250
hey buddy,

1764
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:40,600
no more so I have to pay for it now it's
like hundred something dollars a month

1765
01:42:40,601 --> 01:42:43,960
now. Now think of that in
terms of what Netflix costs.

1766
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:46,780
What's Netflix like 10 bucks,
nine bucks or something like that.

1767
01:42:46,781 --> 01:42:50,650
They just raised to like 15 and then
you need an internet connection and then

1768
01:42:50,651 --> 01:42:54,310
that's it. That's it.
APPLETV tube. Apple. Yeah.

1769
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:57,340
Or a Amazon cause that was on Hbo,

1770
01:42:57,370 --> 01:43:01,900
but I have HBO now so I can watch prime
is even more interesting because if you

1771
01:43:01,901 --> 01:43:06,400
have Amazon prime for shopping,
you get Amazon prime for free.

1772
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:10,930
Like the TV. He watched the TV shows.
So you get to watch Mrs Maizel.

1773
01:43:11,110 --> 01:43:14,280
You get to, what do you ever watch
the guys from top gear went? Oh,

1774
01:43:14,281 --> 01:43:18,320
I love those guys. They went over to, uh,
the, the grand tour. They went over there,

1775
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:21,580
they fired him and the other two guys
went, fuck it. We're going with them. Yes.

1776
01:43:21,581 --> 01:43:24,640
Type move. Well, Jimmy Clark's
and got drunk and punch some dude.

1777
01:43:24,670 --> 01:43:27,220
And so they fired him. I guess he
was different on social, whatever.

1778
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:30,100
Guys off the bass,
these hilarious,

1779
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:33,550
the best funny dude can't do a
show without them. And so, uh,

1780
01:43:33,700 --> 01:43:38,350
apparently like they just ended that
show and he was crying like he cried.

1781
01:43:38,351 --> 01:43:42,100
Like that's how he teared
up. Oh, it's over. It means
to him. Yeah. Oh Damn. Yeah.

1782
01:43:42,101 --> 01:43:43,000
I think, um, they,

1783
01:43:43,060 --> 01:43:46,720
they committed to do like a couple of
seasons and paint them so much money.

1784
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:50,860
I'm sure. Look, it's a good
move on please. So that
Bayzos dude's burning money.

1785
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:52,040
You can do whatever the fuck he wants.

1786
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:52,880
Yes.
So much money.

1787
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:57,940
Although his girl has half now she's
third on the list of richest Chaka Chaka

1788
01:43:57,940 --> 01:44:00,770
Chuck. Yeah. He has that diamond
piece with them now though.

1789
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:05,330
Hulu has gotten that game too for
live stuff. So there's not that same,

1790
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:08,300
everyone is playing the game
pretty soon it's going to be over.

1791
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:10,940
Imagine if you're trying to
do a shoot a sitcom right now.

1792
01:44:10,941 --> 01:44:14,930
Could you imagine if a guy got divorced
from a woman who's like a duchess or

1793
01:44:14,931 --> 01:44:18,500
some shit and made out in the
deal as good as Jeff Bezos,

1794
01:44:18,501 --> 01:44:21,050
his wife was gonna make out to be sick,
is she?

1795
01:44:21,051 --> 01:44:23,150
And then she had like $1
billion or something like that.

1796
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:26,300
She had way more inability
to get bill young son.

1797
01:44:26,301 --> 01:44:29,150
They said as soon as they divorced she's
and be like top 10 richest in the world.

1798
01:44:29,190 --> 01:44:29,960
Yeah,

1799
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:34,790
he came for like 25% of its stock
or some crazy shit he get. Yeah,

1800
01:44:34,791 --> 01:44:38,870
like, but they did start together
like his room. Yes. Listen men, yeah,

1801
01:44:38,871 --> 01:44:43,490
she deserves it, but it's
hilarious. It's so much money.

1802
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:45,560
Like damn.
She banked on it correctly.

1803
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:49,250
She's hanging out with that dude when he
was like 24 going this fucking psycho.

1804
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:52,200
Have you seen him around the
world? Have you seen that? Yes.

1805
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:56,360
That picture yes is amazing.
I want that.

1806
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,820
Send me that picture.
I know you get a picture.

1807
01:44:59,090 --> 01:45:02,590
Do me a favor and send that to my phone.
I need to see that. Isn't that great? Oh,

1808
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:04,100
I'm going to, I'm going
to put that as my, uh,

1809
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:08,180
I'm going to replace the American flag
with that in that. Great. I'm serious.

1810
01:45:09,610 --> 01:45:11,900
Any like any,
he's like shaved his head,

1811
01:45:11,901 --> 01:45:15,260
TRT tandem on stylus bawling.

1812
01:45:15,261 --> 01:45:17,630
Just look at that banner on the wall.
I look at the,

1813
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:21,510
just a little desperation
banner. Look at him there, dude.

1814
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:25,730
And have you seen his new
girl? What's up? Holla? Sure.

1815
01:45:25,731 --> 01:45:29,240
That caught you about $40 billion,
but you gotta be happy. Yeah.

1816
01:45:29,241 --> 01:45:32,270
He looks like he's enjoying us.
When you have 80 billion, what's 40?

1817
01:45:32,271 --> 01:45:35,330
Who gives a fuck? How much can you
spend? And by the way, spend it.

1818
01:45:35,390 --> 01:45:37,730
Do you think he's going to, he's,
here's a problem with that dude.

1819
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:39,710
He might be making so much money.

1820
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:44,840
They think about it like when did
Amazon even start? Was it 15 years ago?

1821
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:47,200
A second ago?
It wasn't that long ago.

1822
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:52,070
What's going to be like 15 years from
now when he's on fucking gene doping and

1823
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:53,143
they got 'em

1824
01:45:54,850 --> 01:45:59,390
back dated to a 24 year old bayzos.
His Chin looks thicker,

1825
01:46:00,050 --> 01:46:04,580
the shoulder caps Ron, and she's
going to be 85 years old running shit.

1826
01:46:04,581 --> 01:46:08,930
Look in 30 how much money do you
need? He'll have that guy. Billion,

1827
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:10,580
billion dollars. Like how
much money? This is my point,

1828
01:46:10,581 --> 01:46:15,581
like if if he stays healthy
and is enthusiastic and
still has like this drive to

1829
01:46:16,851 --> 01:46:17,420
succeed,

1830
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:21,440
how much is going to be worth when you
start getting that kind of momentum?

1831
01:46:21,441 --> 01:46:25,250
That's why companies like, that's why
you get people like Elizabeth Warren,

1832
01:46:25,510 --> 01:46:27,410
but I don't know too
much about her politics,

1833
01:46:27,411 --> 01:46:31,550
but one of the things that I do know
about her is she wants to shut down or

1834
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:35,450
break up some of these big
companies. You know there's a, yeah,

1835
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:38,720
I forgot what big companies
she was talking about, but
that would be an example.

1836
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:43,880
Like you have too much power,
so much power. She'd probably
want to break them up.

1837
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:46,490
It's interesting because it's
like you see like what is,

1838
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:51,090
when you see capitalism play out, right?
You see someone, they start a business,

1839
01:46:51,091 --> 01:46:51,841
they want to kick ass,

1840
01:46:51,841 --> 01:46:54,780
they want to make a lot of money and then
they do and then they keep calling and

1841
01:46:54,781 --> 01:46:58,380
then they get to this point where
they can make more money more easily,

1842
01:46:58,470 --> 01:46:59,610
more often,

1843
01:46:59,730 --> 01:47:03,150
and they just keep going and keep going
and then they get to this point where if

1844
01:47:03,151 --> 01:47:06,180
you hit the right river
at the perfect time,

1845
01:47:06,181 --> 01:47:08,550
but the most ambitious
person ever at the helm,

1846
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,110
and you got this fucking boat running,
running down this river,

1847
01:47:13,111 --> 01:47:16,200
I just pass and everybody, that's
where you got Amazon with Jeff Bezos.

1848
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:21,430
It was the perfect guy at the perfect
time with the perfect adjusting to the

1849
01:47:21,691 --> 01:47:25,410
role of scrooge McDuck he's,
he's making, he's like,

1850
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:28,840
Elon wants to make a rocket shop.
Gimme a rocket ship. Correct each.

1851
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:33,350
It's an ego thing.
These spaces too though.

1852
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:37,110
You have nothing to do.
Like what challenges does he have?

1853
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:41,270
That one click is the shit. If you need
something, it's the shit. Amazon. Yeah,

1854
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:44,140
it's amazing. Shit. The
only thing, anything,

1855
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:48,360
just just go fucking find it. Bang, boom.
You don't have to think about anymore.

1856
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:52,800
That to me, that means a lot
to me. Not anything time.

1857
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:56,920
I can save time and hassle. I don't
have to leave my house. Thank you.

1858
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:00,860
She's actually the only third
richest in the world. Richest woman.

1859
01:48:00,990 --> 01:48:05,850
They made a deal last month or this
month actually to give her 35 billion.

1860
01:48:06,030 --> 01:48:09,890
That's it. Ooh, good for her.
And she keeps a 4% stake. Oh,

1861
01:48:09,930 --> 01:48:14,730
I thought it was more than that. Damn.
4% cheese is balling. She's balling.

1862
01:48:14,870 --> 01:48:19,800
She's still just 4% stake in Amazon.
My Sane.

1863
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:22,890
And where's it going? Where's it going?
What's going to be 10 years from now?

1864
01:48:23,190 --> 01:48:25,640
What's going to be 15
years from now chooses?

1865
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:30,740
And she's got 35 billion Jews on us.

1866
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:33,420
35 billion. I bet she
went. All right. You know,

1867
01:48:33,421 --> 01:48:37,380
I bet she's so used to $35 billion.
So you're not going to spend it that,

1868
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:40,140
okay. Okay. I mean,

1869
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:45,240
do you need 35 but also I think Jeff
Bezos had a weird agreement with his new

1870
01:48:45,241 --> 01:48:46,800
hot girl where they like,

1871
01:48:46,801 --> 01:48:49,890
they're not having sex until the divorce
is final or some shit like that. Oh,

1872
01:48:49,891 --> 01:48:54,510
sure. Yeah. Yeah. He was like
some weird thing to justice.

1873
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:58,420
Nuts. They're staying away from each
other until they do. What did he doing?

1874
01:48:58,430 --> 01:49:03,270
Chat forced and married or
something like that. Well, oh yeah,

1875
01:49:03,271 --> 01:49:06,150
she's getting divorced too.
If you want to live like a movie,

1876
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:08,400
you got to write a script.
Like a movie script.

1877
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:14,190
Dude's already live in like he's in a
movie. Let's, yeah, you're right. Oh yeah.

1878
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:16,070
And then when you get married,

1879
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:19,560
make everybody dress up like a priest or
some shit. Do whatever you want to do.

1880
01:49:20,150 --> 01:49:23,880
I can everybody dress up like a,
like a Kanye service,

1881
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:28,140
like one of those do whatever you want.
God, what he do, man, not to control.

1882
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:31,620
What'd he do? What'd he do
well, what would you do?

1883
01:49:32,370 --> 01:49:34,970
Just do whatever the fuck he can do.
Whatever the fuck he wants to do.

1884
01:49:34,990 --> 01:49:36,360
You're supposed to do whatever
the fuck you want to do.

1885
01:49:36,361 --> 01:49:38,600
There's only one Jeff Bezos.
I know, but why posts?

1886
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:42,650
He just stopped Kinda you fucking key.
I keep going.

1887
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:44,480
The foot on the gas.

1888
01:49:48,950 --> 01:49:52,900
If you're the Rock, do you need
to do 19 movies? And He's 22 ways.

1889
01:49:53,250 --> 01:49:57,820
Can we do a story? Last year did 19
movies this year, 20 to 22 movies.

1890
01:49:58,120 --> 01:50:01,470
Engevity 22 boobs getting bigger.
Matter of fact,

1891
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:05,710
he'll be 3000 pounds. Yeah. Like how many?

1892
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:09,130
He's a gorilla man that did so
jacked right now. He's so huge too.

1893
01:50:09,131 --> 01:50:12,890
When you meet them in real life, you're
like, oh my goodness, he's so Jackie.

1894
01:50:12,891 --> 01:50:17,080
So jacked. He's so inspirational
to man. You know, he's,

1895
01:50:17,350 --> 01:50:20,860
but if you know how it is being busy,
like how often is he home?

1896
01:50:20,861 --> 01:50:25,570
Did he so inspirational? Oh, that's true.
Yeah. Yeah. It's hard, man. It ain't easy.

1897
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:28,210
Well, I know my schedule.
Yeah, and I look at halftime.

1898
01:50:30,310 --> 01:50:34,140
That's a silver back to his under
Armour shoes. So his workout,

1899
01:50:35,850 --> 01:50:38,800
we're going to choose their dope.
I love this fucking guy, man.

1900
01:50:38,801 --> 01:50:40,030
I love the five of them too.

1901
01:50:40,031 --> 01:50:44,110
I can go to his Instagram at anytime
and he's always super positive and he's

1902
01:50:44,111 --> 01:50:47,860
always super motivated and motivational
and he's always getting after it.

1903
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:50,050
I love it.
He's always getting after it,

1904
01:50:50,290 --> 01:50:55,120
but I wonder what it is in him that you
have to do this many movies when he was

1905
01:50:55,180 --> 01:50:59,710
young man, he was young. He fell upon hard
times and he never forgot. And that's a,

1906
01:50:59,711 --> 01:51:01,270
that's who he is now.
He's just any,

1907
01:51:01,271 --> 01:51:04,390
he also knows that he inspires
people with that work ethic.

1908
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:09,090
Part of what who he is is not just
the things that he accomplishes,

1909
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:13,150
but how he makes people feel like that
guy. He's an inspirational person.

1910
01:51:13,151 --> 01:51:16,130
I think the same thing you could say
about Kevin Hart and a lot of ways, man,

1911
01:51:16,530 --> 01:51:19,420
it's for selfish reasons too though,
cause you check those boxes.

1912
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:22,990
I'm not saying it's a bad guy,
but there's also this, this ego.

1913
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:25,690
Everyone has an ego that he has to fill.
Oh Dude.

1914
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:30,340
She gets from the red carpets and he talks
about it. He talks about kicking ass.

1915
01:51:30,341 --> 01:51:32,530
He talks about how everything's
going great. You know,

1916
01:51:32,531 --> 01:51:37,010
he talks about that whole lot getting
after it. That whole aspect of it. Sure.

1917
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:40,600
Yeah. But there's a kidnapper selfish
for sure. For sure. You have to be,

1918
01:51:40,670 --> 01:51:44,080
they have to be for anybody who
does anything really good like that.

1919
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:47,410
Like you gotta be doing some of
it for yourself. But he's also,

1920
01:51:48,190 --> 01:51:51,400
what he's getting out of it is his,
what he gets out of it,

1921
01:51:51,490 --> 01:51:55,030
but what he gives out of it,
it's not just entertaining with that guy.

1922
01:51:55,240 --> 01:52:00,010
What's interesting is he's, he's
also super motivational. Right?

1923
01:52:00,220 --> 01:52:03,550
Like if he leads by example,
I always really positive.

1924
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:09,040
Now w before social media,
when you had an action star,

1925
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:12,550
you just had the guy that you went
to see in the movie and you saw like,

1926
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:16,090
you know Sylvester Terminator,

1927
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:19,660
they would do interviews
or relate to them. Yeah. It
would be kind of interesting,

1928
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:21,700
but it wasn't this kind of thing.

1929
01:52:21,850 --> 01:52:25,480
The Rock is the rock and he's
also the rock on social media.

1930
01:52:25,481 --> 01:52:29,830
And he makes very good use of social
media because he just talks right to the

1931
01:52:29,831 --> 01:52:33,190
fucking camera and you could tell
he knows what he wants to say.

1932
01:52:33,310 --> 01:52:34,940
But he's speaking from the heart.
She's tall.

1933
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:38,800
So he's interacting with people you
know who's done even better than this,

1934
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:43,360
which the rocks might be the best.
But on the other side of this will Smith,

1935
01:52:43,540 --> 01:52:46,250
he's fantastic. He'll
Smith my hold up. Okay. So

1936
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:49,940
the movie's doing are right, but
Instagram is the new shit. Right?

1937
01:52:49,941 --> 01:52:51,500
Let me focus on this and it's,

1938
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:55,350
I mean ridiculous how good he is
on the wall on Youtube as well.

1939
01:52:55,351 --> 01:52:58,220
I remember when he did that fucking
dance on the roof of that bridge.

1940
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:01,190
It's climbed up.
What are you don't fall down.

1941
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:06,050
Don't fall down while you're
dancing. Kevin Hart's get
a social media too though.

1942
01:53:06,170 --> 01:53:08,090
Now he's phenomenal at it.
He's um,

1943
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:12,740
he's one of the most inspirational
guys I've ever talked to. Kevin. Yeah.

1944
01:53:12,830 --> 01:53:16,670
Cause I liked his message. So
positive, super positive, genuine,

1945
01:53:16,920 --> 01:53:20,900
genuinely not a bullshit positive,
not a fake show business.

1946
01:53:20,901 --> 01:53:23,480
Positive and motivational show.
Business positive.

1947
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:27,620
He's got a healthy outlook. He
does so many things though. I got,

1948
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:32,720
I got tired just listening to him talk
about how much energy he was talking

1949
01:53:32,721 --> 01:53:36,560
about all his businesses. I was getting
exhausted. I was like, how'd you do that?

1950
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:41,270
How do you have the time? It's
incredible. I mean he must sleep.

1951
01:53:41,290 --> 01:53:43,400
He and he said he only
sleeps a few hours a night,

1952
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:47,600
but I mean he must be just from the
moment he gets up just fucking foot on the

1953
01:53:47,601 --> 01:53:50,660
gas. I wish I was one of those guys.
I wish I was one of these guys.

1954
01:53:50,661 --> 01:53:53,930
You only need four hours and
just do function at a high level.

1955
01:53:53,931 --> 01:53:58,430
If I don't get aid, I'm fucked
man. Do you? I don't think,

1956
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:02,000
but I mean do you really wish you were
that guy though that like always hit the

1957
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:03,590
gas all day long? Whoa, whoa. No,

1958
01:54:03,591 --> 01:54:08,591
I'm saying I could get Monday or Sunday
and then before my son gets up at five

1959
01:54:09,291 --> 01:54:11,760
I'm up at three and get my workouts in.

1960
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:15,740
I can do all my research for my shows
and then I'm off and running. Yeah.

1961
01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:20,600
I need a man. Like if I do, let's say if
I do a set tomorrow at the comedy store,

1962
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:23,570
I get home at midnight no matter what.
I'm up at five,

1963
01:54:23,571 --> 01:54:27,050
five 30 with my son and I go to work.
It's a beast of a day

1964
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:32,150
when there's certain guys that
should need four hours. Yeah.

1965
01:54:32,151 --> 01:54:36,890
Those people are freaks. You're not
that guy now. And I need five to feel.

1966
01:54:36,891 --> 01:54:41,300
Okay. Six to feel good. Six. I can
work out normal. I could do anything.

1967
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:45,290
Seven makes me feel happy.
Seven is nice. Kevin. I'm seven.

1968
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:50,510
I'm a seven guy. Yeah. Yeah. Seven's good.

1969
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:53,600
Seven's a solid number.
If you could get that,

1970
01:54:54,170 --> 01:54:57,350
you probably got most of
your bases covered, but damn,
if you get eight or nine,

1971
01:54:58,250 --> 01:54:58,940
that's when the real,

1972
01:54:58,940 --> 01:55:01,520
if you could really sleep for
eight or nine like engineered.

1973
01:55:01,550 --> 01:55:05,240
So my problem is I drink too much
water at night. I get a pee. Yeah.

1974
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:07,220
It's so annoying.
So stupid.

1975
01:55:07,221 --> 01:55:10,110
And Like I had a z Vo last night while I
was watching game of Thrones. I'm like,

1976
01:55:10,111 --> 01:55:14,300
I should know what she does and I have
to pee. I have a pro. I have a problem.

1977
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:16,220
I have to,
it's so weird.

1978
01:55:16,221 --> 01:55:19,930
I have to have beverages packages.

1979
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:24,970
Oh, late in life. Yeah.

1980
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:29,980
You just want to be able to sit back
and slurp that z via and then at five

1981
01:55:30,021 --> 01:55:31,520
o'clock in the morning, God damn, I got a,

1982
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:34,240
do you ever sip on a whiskey or
earthy at night with the wifey,

1983
01:55:34,250 --> 01:55:37,430
watching game of Thrones? No. I'll
drink a little wine with dinner,

1984
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:39,800
but I don't drink whiskey
at home very often.

1985
01:55:39,801 --> 01:55:43,800
I drink whiskey when I'm looking to get
fucked up or before weighty up. Yeah.

1986
01:55:43,801 --> 01:55:44,010
I'll have

1987
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:47,430
a shot. Yeah. Here's a prompt. So if
I become an alcoholic in three years,

1988
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:51,390
it all stem on blaming you because
when we are doing that said,

1989
01:55:51,391 --> 01:55:53,220
I think at the Improv you're like,
you want a shot of whiskey? I'm like,

1990
01:55:53,221 --> 01:55:54,900
I don't drink before
shows, man. You're like,

1991
01:55:54,901 --> 01:55:56,600
I'm telling you it helps you with
your nerve. So I was like, all right,

1992
01:55:56,610 --> 01:55:59,790
this guy's been doing it forever.
Let me try it. Did the shot,

1993
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:03,380
one of the best sets I've ever had.
I don't know how long ago it was.

1994
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:04,530
Two months ago.
Three months go.

1995
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:10,150
Every time I do comedy now I have
a shot of whiskey. Well, make sure,

1996
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:13,140
make sure you don't do that.
Make sure why not.

1997
01:56:13,950 --> 01:56:17,440
Cause you don't want to become an
alcoholic. Which one shot. Hey,

1998
01:56:18,240 --> 01:56:22,720
come on lunch. I am. I was going
to get it. Whistle show the day.

1999
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:26,550
Yeah, you could do it. Yeah. I feel good.
As long as I work out the next morning.

2000
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:31,770
Hydrate. One shot is not
that bad for your body. No,

2001
01:56:31,771 --> 01:56:34,650
it's not the best thing in the world.
But it's not live in though.

2002
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:39,000
But it's a good amount to give you like
a little, just a little. Fuck it juice.

2003
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:43,740
Loosey Goosey. So uptight.
It's a fucking man. Fun.

2004
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:48,330
Yeah. That's what whiskeys for. You know?
That's why it's been around so long.

2005
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:48,990
You know,

2006
01:56:48,990 --> 01:56:52,200
like that buffalo trace shit that we drank
when we were doing the podcast. Shit,

2007
01:56:52,201 --> 01:56:55,350
man. Stuffs from the 17
hundreds fucking night. It is.

2008
01:56:55,410 --> 01:56:59,400
That fucking company was started in the
17 hundreds. How ridiculous that is.

2009
01:56:59,930 --> 01:57:02,970
I have seen about orange some from my
house cause I like that with so much.

2010
01:57:02,971 --> 01:57:06,630
Like I don't need that in my life. Yeah.
Because I'll just start drinking, become,

2011
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:09,810
you know, I'm not like out
with me. I'm on alcoholic man.

2012
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:13,810
It's good during fight companions.
I'm going to save it for that. Yeah.

2013
01:57:14,130 --> 01:57:18,830
I don't keep like whiskey at home.
I don't find myself interested cause I,

2014
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:22,110
if I want to get like a little tipsy,
I want to be with my boys and fuck around.

2015
01:57:22,111 --> 01:57:26,520
Like I don't, I like it at a bar. I
like it. Uh, I like it at a comedy club.

2016
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:29,700
I like it here. I love it during
five companions or favorite.

2017
01:57:30,030 --> 01:57:34,950
But it'd be like if I had like a man cave
or guys came over and we played poker,

2018
01:57:35,070 --> 01:57:38,370
we drink some whiskey. That'd
be fun. Yeah. But again,
you're with your boys. Yeah,

2019
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:41,100
but I'm just chilling at home by myself.
Yeah.

2020
01:57:41,250 --> 01:57:43,790
Might get trunk and say
something inappropriate. Yeah.

2021
01:57:44,610 --> 01:57:48,810
Get cancelled at my own house. Again,
it's a different kind of drunk too.

2022
01:57:48,811 --> 01:57:52,530
Like whiskey trunk is like Jesus
Christ like you, you, you know,

2023
01:57:52,531 --> 01:57:55,010
you get belligerent.
I don't need that

2024
01:57:56,540 --> 01:57:58,830
until he started having fun.

2025
01:57:58,860 --> 01:58:03,480
You start playing Hank William to juniors
songs real loud. Outlandish. Yeah.

2026
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:07,920
Yeah. Dude, there's some fucking,

2027
01:58:07,950 --> 01:58:09,690
you go into that deep country music.

2028
01:58:09,691 --> 01:58:13,010
What were you just telling me about
country music that some giant country rap?

2029
01:58:14,100 --> 01:58:18,270
What is the a song it's called Old Town
road. Old Town road. Old Town road.

2030
01:58:18,271 --> 01:58:19,530
One of the biggest songs out.

2031
01:58:20,110 --> 01:58:23,310
It's number one on the regular church
in the country. T charts, right.

2032
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:27,330
Put it together. Little nausea x, is
that right? Everyone's little legs.

2033
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:31,860
Little Nas had a little nausea,
but so he was on the country charts.

2034
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:34,320
They took them off because
like this isn't country man,

2035
01:58:34,530 --> 01:58:38,550
but then he linked up with
Miley Cyrus, his dad. What's
his name? Billy Ray. Cyrus.

2036
01:58:38,551 --> 01:58:41,920
Billy Ray Cyrus. How dare
you, I think also had

2037
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,800
to do with this. Is he used at whether
he did it or not? I don't know.

2038
01:58:44,801 --> 01:58:46,270
But he used the video game,

2039
01:58:46,300 --> 01:58:50,710
red dead redemption and some of the
cool graphics and then made a rap song,

2040
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:54,250
country rap song, it's called called
country trap is what they're calling it.

2041
01:58:54,251 --> 01:58:57,040
That's why it's a different
thing. But it's got, it's got,

2042
01:58:57,100 --> 01:59:01,450
it's catchy and it's based around this
kind of stuff. It got, it got hot,

2043
01:59:01,480 --> 01:59:03,250
it caught, they're
caught. The wave country,

2044
01:59:03,251 --> 01:59:06,400
like the djs on all the stations were
like just ripping it off of youtube and

2045
01:59:06,401 --> 01:59:09,300
playing it. That's why it made it on
the billboard. And then they'll put,

2046
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:12,010
it was like, hey, this isn't
a country song. Take it off.

2047
01:59:12,011 --> 01:59:15,340
And then because that almost, it's
like Streisand effect. It got bigger.

2048
01:59:15,620 --> 01:59:19,100
So they, um, they who,

2049
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:23,750
who took it off billboard did, why did
they take it off? Because it doesn't,

2050
01:59:23,751 --> 01:59:27,640
and there third description was that it
doesn't meet the qualifications country

2051
01:59:27,820 --> 01:59:29,360
to meet country with Billy Ray.

2052
01:59:29,361 --> 01:59:33,030
Cyrus jumped onboard and then there's
video of him and Billy Ray Cyrus studies

2053
01:59:33,150 --> 01:59:36,320
studio. It's so interesting when
you're looking at the footage of it,

2054
01:59:36,321 --> 01:59:40,850
how cool that fucking game, this is just a
game. This is, that's a huge game, right?

2055
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:45,000
Red Redemption. Yup, too. But
what a great idea to wrap over.

2056
01:59:45,010 --> 01:59:47,780
Read the smart demolition.
That's a genius idea.

2057
01:59:47,790 --> 01:59:50,290
I think I'll take that game is
played it in here. Jamie and I,

2058
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:54,290
we pay you guys beat the Shit on me.
Whatever game we played last night.

2059
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:56,870
That was quick as fuck.
I don't want to fuck with that game.

2060
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:59,570
We're just talk a little about Tom.
Papa walked in.

2061
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:03,380
Jeff and I were battling to death.
Tom Papa don't play. You know,

2062
02:00:03,381 --> 02:00:05,740
he was just watching us going,
what the fuck are you doing? Yeah.

2063
02:00:05,750 --> 02:00:07,880
What are you doing? What are you
doing Tom? Papa. So funny man.

2064
02:00:07,890 --> 02:00:11,000
He just wants everything to be old school.
He's so wants to go to the,

2065
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:15,530
to the paper vendor and get a newspaper
and bake his own bread. I take that.

2066
02:00:15,710 --> 02:00:19,790
What does this Manson, what
was that like with Billy Ray?

2067
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:23,660
He's like a real video now.
They made a real video. Oh Wow.

2068
02:00:24,020 --> 02:00:25,280
I'm not feeling a real video.

2069
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:29,280
Do I like the way he two dancers with
a cowboy hat on? No. But he's like,

2070
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:31,880
he's become a star because of this.
It's getting played all the festivals,

2071
02:00:31,881 --> 02:00:34,250
all the last couple of weeks.
The crowds are loving it.

2072
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:37,970
Why didn't he open up at Coachella? It
was already booked. It's more along.

2073
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:40,280
This happened so quick.
You could sneak him in.

2074
02:00:40,510 --> 02:00:43,750
Billy Ray Cyrus let bit your mind ready
to get his whistle wet at Coachella

2075
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:44,481
played it,
I'm sure.

2076
02:00:44,481 --> 02:00:48,080
But like I saw that little like the
Yodel kid was singing this song,

2077
02:00:48,081 --> 02:00:50,130
like he's even Toronto
and all kinds of shit.

2078
02:00:50,270 --> 02:00:53,180
Do you know who Billy Ray Cyrus
says? No. He knows big hit. Oh yeah.

2079
02:00:53,420 --> 02:00:57,650
Don't keep breaking my heart.
His daughter's way bigger.

2080
02:00:58,460 --> 02:01:02,780
Um, he was really huge for a
brief moment in time. But yeah,

2081
02:01:02,781 --> 02:01:04,780
he was never like what she is,
she gets,

2082
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:09,800
she gets she fucking sound to fuck.
And she was on that crazy.

2083
02:01:09,801 --> 02:01:13,790
Disney hit forever. Hannah Montana,
Montana forever, which made no sense.

2084
02:01:13,850 --> 02:01:17,840
I put a wig on and nobody notices
because it is strange. So ridiculous.

2085
02:01:17,841 --> 02:01:22,730
Like Batman, there is glorious locks.
God looks like. Yeah, he goes, brother.

2086
02:01:23,540 --> 02:01:26,700
Yeah. So everybody was doing the Achy
breaky heart back then. [inaudible]

2087
02:01:26,710 --> 02:01:30,920
93 million. I bet that must have
fucking freaked him out, man.

2088
02:01:30,980 --> 02:01:34,460
Take he's famous. He was back then
for that brief moment in time,

2089
02:01:35,030 --> 02:01:37,610
dude gets weirder now to be famous.

2090
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:41,540
Like back then you could get away
things and now it's a nightmare. Yeah,

2091
02:01:41,541 --> 02:01:43,310
that's true.
Do you remember the Bill Hicks bit?

2092
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:47,510
Bill Hicks had a joke about Billy Ray
Cyrus. What? He said it was terrible.

2093
02:01:47,511 --> 02:01:51,140
He was so mean. He was saying
that, uh, this is my last show.

2094
02:01:51,230 --> 02:01:53,320
I'm not doing standup anymore.
Uh,

2095
02:01:53,510 --> 02:01:58,190
because I got a TV show and he goes,
thank you ladies and gentlemen. I mean,

2096
02:01:58,191 --> 02:02:02,690
I worked hard forever and uh, now we're
going to do a new television show.

2097
02:02:02,691 --> 02:02:05,360
It's called let's hunt
and kill Billy Ray Cyrus

2098
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:09,020
chase him down.
I forget what he,

2099
02:02:09,850 --> 02:02:14,180
but he said like grab him by his
faggy ponytail. And she was like,

2100
02:02:14,570 --> 02:02:17,660
wow, it's intense. It was ruthless.

2101
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:22,490
It was ruthless because Billy Ray,
you only had that one hit, right?

2102
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:24,420
He didn't have multiple kits.

2103
02:02:25,190 --> 02:02:28,880
Maybe have like shit one or two other
songs that were kind of popular,

2104
02:02:28,881 --> 02:02:32,900
but that song was gigantic. It's
interesting that his daughter show big.

2105
02:02:32,930 --> 02:02:37,250
She's so talented. Man. That Song
Malibu. She so good. So good.

2106
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:42,080
Yeah. Can't tell people like
it though. They get mad at you.

2107
02:02:42,210 --> 02:02:44,360
Like get mad at you when
you're wearing those shoes.

2108
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:49,960
And I don't give a fuck dude wrecking
ball for Miley Cyrus Acoustics sucked this

2109
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:52,910
beast.
I'll listen to that and wear these shoes.

2110
02:02:52,911 --> 02:02:57,590
The best thing she ever did to me,
like when I, well, the most impactful.

2111
02:02:57,591 --> 02:03:01,240
So the first time I realized she could
really sing was that song Jolene. Oh my.

2112
02:03:01,241 --> 02:03:05,810
I've heard of,
to Jolene Christ Monster.

2113
02:03:05,870 --> 02:03:10,520
God Damn fucking pop. Do you
watch American idol? It'll do.

2114
02:03:10,521 --> 02:03:14,170
I look like a girl. You don't watch
any American idol talking about man,

2115
02:03:15,530 --> 02:03:16,800
Malibu,
Bro.

2116
02:03:17,330 --> 02:03:20,660
We were broken out over music
kid watching American idol.

2117
02:03:20,661 --> 02:03:22,610
There's always some stuff
from it. This like, dude,

2118
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:27,200
they did at the grammys this year, but
the American, I sang it together. Yeah,

2119
02:03:27,470 --> 02:03:31,110
that kid is awesome. Yeah.
You watch American idol.
You're fucking line. They do.

2120
02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:31,953
What do you have the time?

2121
02:03:32,270 --> 02:03:36,110
Sunday nights you have the time for
Sunday night's my night off, bro.

2122
02:03:37,490 --> 02:03:41,600
He be playing quake with us in the
quick hello. I have a little land party.

2123
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:42,711
They're real.

2124
02:03:42,711 --> 02:03:46,540
You only still real people seeing your
balls and in game of Thrones through

2125
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:49,540
dragons thrill.
I love it as well too.

2126
02:03:49,620 --> 02:03:53,600
I'm just saying at least American idol
or people pursuing their dreams so sweet

2127
02:03:53,660 --> 02:03:56,790
and they can sing. Yeah. Oh,

2128
02:04:03,320 --> 02:04:07,220
I don't hate on the show. I'm
happy it exists. I just uh,

2129
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:11,900
it's only so many hours in
a day, son. That's all I'm
saying. I hear you. You know,

2130
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:16,610
but at night when you're chilling,
not me. I like to chill to fiction.

2131
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:19,780
That's what my favorite shit
is. Like what? Give me example,

2132
02:04:19,970 --> 02:04:23,850
game of Thrones type shit
or like a Mrs Maizel or uh,

2133
02:04:23,870 --> 02:04:28,070
any show that I'm Ozark and
he's a stranger things and
show that I'm really into,

2134
02:04:28,100 --> 02:04:32,540
that's why I like to chill with, I like
to follow like a storyline for years.

2135
02:04:32,690 --> 02:04:35,710
I like, it's weird. I, I'm
with you when I get soup,

2136
02:04:35,711 --> 02:04:38,130
like I'm super into game Thrones.
Like I watched all

2137
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:41,670
the old seasons leading up to
this. Yeah, that's dope dude.

2138
02:04:42,630 --> 02:04:43,171
That's just,

2139
02:04:43,171 --> 02:04:47,190
it's just like a fun little escape where
he just locked into that and to me,

2140
02:04:47,870 --> 02:04:52,290
as you know, Paul Mooney said to
me once a long time ago, he goes,

2141
02:04:52,470 --> 02:04:57,390
if you really want to write, he goes,
go get entertained first. And I said,

2142
02:04:57,400 --> 02:05:00,630
you like, how would you like what'd he do?
He goes, whenever you go see some music,

2143
02:05:00,810 --> 02:05:05,160
he goes, go to the movies. It goes,
go be entertained, you're entertained,

2144
02:05:05,161 --> 02:05:07,710
and then you're going to
want to write. Oh Wow. Yeah.

2145
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:12,240
That was great advice that I never heard
anybody say before, but it made sense.

2146
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:17,580
It's like go get it or tained and get
like it'll fire you up and then is take,

2147
02:05:17,790 --> 02:05:21,070
take that fire and then just start
creating, inspires you. It's a,

2148
02:05:21,300 --> 02:05:23,240
it's a great piece of advice for,

2149
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:26,700
for young people because I know there's
been many times where I've seen someone

2150
02:05:26,701 --> 02:05:30,120
like murder at the store where I
couldn't wait to get home and write.

2151
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:31,890
I just couldn't wait to,
you know,

2152
02:05:31,891 --> 02:05:35,730
I just wanted to run home and bust
out that fucking laptop and come on.

2153
02:05:36,120 --> 02:05:36,900
What do we got in here?

2154
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:39,180
What are we got in that brain
come on or something in there.

2155
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:42,750
Do you listen to music when you drive?
Sometimes.

2156
02:05:42,751 --> 02:05:46,110
Depends on if I'm on my way to the Gig.
If I'm on my way to the Gig,

2157
02:05:46,350 --> 02:05:50,910
almost always try to listen to last
night set or whatever new shit that I'm

2158
02:05:50,911 --> 02:05:54,940
working on to go over it. Just not done.
Not just to go over but to examine it,

2159
02:05:55,290 --> 02:05:59,310
see if there's any way that I want to
stop and rewind to maybe slow it down or

2160
02:05:59,311 --> 02:06:03,210
speed it up or do it different.
If I don't take those extra,

2161
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:07,140
like say if I do four sets a week,
but I listened to three sets a week,

2162
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:10,320
that's seven sets instead of four sets.
I think that's,

2163
02:06:10,470 --> 02:06:13,410
that's a difference like a rep thing,
but it's uncomfortable.

2164
02:06:13,411 --> 02:06:15,780
Like you don't want to do it.
It's annoying,

2165
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:20,580
but I think it counts almost
as much as doing a set.

2166
02:06:20,940 --> 02:06:22,920
It's not as much cause doing a set.

2167
02:06:22,921 --> 02:06:27,540
What happens is you get that
spontaneity and you get the flow.

2168
02:06:27,541 --> 02:06:28,740
When you get the instinct,

2169
02:06:28,741 --> 02:06:31,800
the feeling when it hit the
punchline in the car's a mental rope,

2170
02:06:32,220 --> 02:06:35,880
it's a mental rapid,
but it's also like a third party examiner.

2171
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:38,790
Like it's almost like you could
watch it from the outside.

2172
02:06:39,240 --> 02:06:40,470
You could watch it as someone,
well,

2173
02:06:40,471 --> 02:06:44,790
I still be second party is you'd watch
it as someone watching you and you'd go,

2174
02:06:44,791 --> 02:06:48,090
Ha, I don't like, this is clunky,
white sand. It's like this.

2175
02:06:48,330 --> 02:06:53,010
If you could just do that and say it
like yourself and say like yourself,

2176
02:06:53,011 --> 02:06:57,780
but then listen, like you would listen
to it too. As a fan of most t get.

2177
02:06:57,810 --> 02:07:01,500
Yeah. Listen, as a person who
is also, you know, you do it,

2178
02:07:01,501 --> 02:07:03,540
you practice it so you
know where the or the,

2179
02:07:03,630 --> 02:07:07,200
but sometimes you get caught up in doing
something a certain way and it's hard

2180
02:07:07,201 --> 02:07:11,930
to break out of the pattern of doing that
bit to try to find a better way. Yes.

2181
02:07:11,970 --> 02:07:14,940
Like you're comfortable with like, Oh
God, I've got to get into this bit.

2182
02:07:14,941 --> 02:07:15,774
How do I get into it?

2183
02:07:15,830 --> 02:07:19,560
And then you'll stumble into this one
way and then you keep doing it that way

2184
02:07:19,561 --> 02:07:23,080
when really the right way to do it is to
kind of break it down and rebuild. Yeah.

2185
02:07:23,090 --> 02:07:25,200
Like you know where the funny
parts are breaking it down.

2186
02:07:25,230 --> 02:07:27,930
And I've done that a few times in broken
bits where they never worked again.

2187
02:07:29,940 --> 02:07:33,360
Sometimes it just, they don't
bounce back, you know? Yeah.

2188
02:07:34,110 --> 02:07:36,160
You fricking a at the ice house,
man.

2189
02:07:36,230 --> 02:07:39,970
You get it. You mean you fucking, you did
that cause you getting ready for your,

2190
02:07:39,971 --> 02:07:44,080
your four 20 show. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is
that the biggest crowd you've ever done?

2191
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:46,050
Yeah. No. Uh,

2192
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:50,440
Air Canada center was bigger Air Qantas
like that's the Scotia Bank arena.

2193
02:07:50,441 --> 02:07:54,610
Flock in Toronto. Canada is, is that
where a, that's what the UFC is.

2194
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:58,810
That's right. Yeah. It's
the Scotia Bank arena now.

2195
02:07:59,200 --> 02:08:01,630
It used to be they're kind of the center.
And how many was that joint?

2196
02:08:01,631 --> 02:08:06,100
That's like 13,000. Were you on a
stage I Kevin Hart stage? No, no, no.

2197
02:08:06,101 --> 02:08:11,050
It was on like a regular stage. Is a San
Diego circular? Yeah. San Diego Sorkin.

2198
02:08:11,060 --> 02:08:13,690
I find it awkward men watching it.
I find it awkward.

2199
02:08:14,170 --> 02:08:18,250
I mean obviously we can kill it, but
I find it awkward. Yeah. I'm excited.

2200
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:21,340
I think Joe does doing for 20 in Milwaukee

2201
02:08:23,970 --> 02:08:27,310
as the past.
Can't get enough of that dude.

2202
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:32,470
So happy he's around. He's one of the
most, you know what he's doing right now,

2203
02:08:32,471 --> 02:08:37,330
right? I don't think I can say it on
there. Don't say it then. Oh yeah,

2204
02:08:37,390 --> 02:08:40,450
I do. No, I don't think you can say it.
No, I don't think he's announced it.

2205
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:45,400
It's amazing. Yeah. Yeah.
Can't say that. Can't say that.
But you know. Yeah. So cool.

2206
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:49,900
He's the one of the most important
figures in the standup world today,

2207
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:54,100
in my opinion,
who's one of the most free guys?

2208
02:08:54,160 --> 02:08:58,720
Like in terms of like if, if you
look at, if there was a style of, um,

2209
02:08:59,350 --> 02:09:01,030
say is a style of Jujitsu,
right?

2210
02:09:01,450 --> 02:09:05,440
Where one guy is just always
catching triangles on people,

2211
02:09:05,441 --> 02:09:07,570
super aggressive and always
catching, trying. It was like,

2212
02:09:07,571 --> 02:09:08,570
how is this guy always kid?

2213
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:14,640
And it sort of changes your perception
of how often someone can catch someone in

2214
02:09:15,161 --> 02:09:17,830
a triangle.
Joey so fucking loose.

2215
02:09:18,130 --> 02:09:22,870
He changes your perception
of what's loose. Like he, he,

2216
02:09:22,900 --> 02:09:26,140
he moves the needle. Yeah.
Is Rare. That's rare.

2217
02:09:26,170 --> 02:09:29,710
I think bill bird does that two
moves the needle too with bill and I,

2218
02:09:29,711 --> 02:09:32,650
and maybe it's because I'm around Brian
and Brian's always like, you know,

2219
02:09:32,651 --> 02:09:34,270
you gotta be careful
if you say this stuff,

2220
02:09:34,420 --> 02:09:37,510
especially in the culture side right now.
Yeah. Be careful with this. And I'm like,

2221
02:09:37,511 --> 02:09:37,991
yeah,
maybe.

2222
02:09:37,991 --> 02:09:42,910
So I've started like almost reserved
and then per went up at the last fact.

2223
02:09:42,911 --> 02:09:45,340
Don't have that. Oh Shit. You can do that.

2224
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:52,480
Yeah. He's on fire right now. He just
filmed, um, he just filmed some, uh,

2225
02:09:52,510 --> 02:09:56,320
special. Did he really? Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. He's kind of come out with, oh,

2226
02:09:56,470 --> 02:09:58,520
I should say anything a while ago though.
Right?

2227
02:09:58,521 --> 02:10:02,080
Because the stuff he did in
the house all knew it. Well,

2228
02:10:02,830 --> 02:10:06,610
I don't know if I'm supposed to be
saying this. Did I give something away?

2229
02:10:08,050 --> 02:10:11,710
I Dunno. I don't know if that's been
announced. So I'm going to shut my mouth,

2230
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,260
by the way. Either way. Murderer murder.

2231
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:19,280
No fucks get bit all the time.
No fucks. Given at all. Yeah.

2232
02:10:20,170 --> 02:10:23,650
Yeah. He's um, he's uniquely free.

2233
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:26,140
Like he was making the
comics in the back like,

2234
02:10:26,500 --> 02:10:31,090
and we're just watching like
what, it makes hilarious
points too. They're so bold,

2235
02:10:31,091 --> 02:10:34,000
but that's what she's so bold.
That's how he started. Yeah. He's

2236
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:37,040
just sticking with his guns. That's
what he is. That's who he is, who he is.

2237
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:40,190
I think I'd see a lot of guys navigate
away from that because they're afraid of

2238
02:10:40,191 --> 02:10:43,760
offending people and then he gets
up and he's like, shut the fuck up.

2239
02:10:43,850 --> 02:10:48,850
What people are taking comedy as much
more of a statement than like if you wrote

2240
02:10:50,811 --> 02:10:52,940
a movie where some
fucked up things happen.

2241
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:55,410
Like if you were older and
that's probably coming to,

2242
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:56,780
if they let people take comedy,

2243
02:10:56,781 --> 02:10:59,390
they'll probably go after
that next w which would,

2244
02:10:59,450 --> 02:11:03,230
it's kind of falls in line with what,
what could be next.

2245
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:08,180
But if you decide that someone saying
something that they actually mean that

2246
02:11:08,210 --> 02:11:11,210
they shouldn't be able to say that even
though it's funny and it made people

2247
02:11:11,211 --> 02:11:14,510
laugh. The guy's clearly joking,
which is that it has been,

2248
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:19,460
especially when you try to use it
in print, it's a slippery slope.

2249
02:11:19,940 --> 02:11:21,240
It's a slippery slope.

2250
02:11:21,260 --> 02:11:26,260
Greased Hill because then why or why is
Quintin Tarantino allow to write a movie

2251
02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:27,950
where a bunch of people get killed?

2252
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:31,250
Why is he allowed to write a
movie that might incite violence?

2253
02:11:31,251 --> 02:11:34,700
Why is he allowed to write a movie
where people use racial slurs and shoot

2254
02:11:34,701 --> 02:11:38,030
people over? Nothing. Why is you're
allowed to ride to write that movie? Oh,

2255
02:11:38,031 --> 02:11:41,870
it's all Quintin Tarantino.
So he's responsible for
this whole movie. Fuck that.

2256
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:45,770
We got to boycott him and that that kind
of nonsense is an episode of fucking

2257
02:11:45,771 --> 02:11:48,260
South Park that's coming, went on
in this world. I don't think it's,

2258
02:11:48,270 --> 02:11:51,320
I think it's swinging back the other way.
It could sway back the other way,

2259
02:11:51,321 --> 02:11:53,960
but you got to realize we could take a
little break and then have it come back

2260
02:11:53,961 --> 02:11:55,370
hard again.
May Be,

2261
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:59,120
or those guys or the guys like Louis C
K who selling out everywhere and doing

2262
02:11:59,121 --> 02:12:02,990
great comedy like he can't, he could
sell out fucking staple center right now.

2263
02:12:02,991 --> 02:12:06,110
Multiple Times in a row. What's crazy
is he doesn't want to, doesn't want to,

2264
02:12:06,111 --> 02:12:09,490
it's just too in comedy
clubs just working. Yeah.

2265
02:12:12,130 --> 02:12:16,360
He could easily come back like
tiger woods easily right now.

2266
02:12:17,380 --> 02:12:20,890
He said something so fucked up too because
they asked me why I did it. He goes,

2267
02:12:20,891 --> 02:12:22,540
I like to jerk off and I
don't want to be alone.

2268
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:29,140
I like to jerk off and I don't like to
be alone. Like, oh, and then you know

2269
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:35,150
he's great man. Yeah. I mean he asked, he
did some creepy shit. He definitely did.

2270
02:12:35,180 --> 02:12:38,840
Did some creepy shit. I don't approve
of it, but he didn't molest anyone.

2271
02:12:39,110 --> 02:12:42,880
I don't think we know exactly what
happened either. I don't know.

2272
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:45,990
But I do know is he could
sell out staple center. Yeah,

2273
02:12:47,010 --> 02:12:50,870
because I think most guys in fans go,
all right man. But the other thing that,

2274
02:12:50,871 --> 02:12:53,000
and he's really good at
comedy. Yeah. That's the other,

2275
02:12:53,030 --> 02:12:56,780
the other thing that we always have
to think about whenever we talk about

2276
02:12:56,781 --> 02:12:58,490
anything is that where dude's,

2277
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:01,100
and so when we're talking about
someone jerking off in front of you,

2278
02:13:01,130 --> 02:13:04,220
just imagine a woman
jerking off in front of us.

2279
02:13:04,250 --> 02:13:09,170
Now you can't because that's not the
same cause it would the only reason why a

2280
02:13:09,171 --> 02:13:11,390
girl could jerk off in front of you.
And it's hilarious.

2281
02:13:11,750 --> 02:13:15,650
It's cause she can't rape. You. See if
a guy is jerking off in front of you,

2282
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:19,430
most guys are bigger and
stronger than most women.

2283
02:13:19,610 --> 02:13:21,350
Obviously there's some variables there,

2284
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:26,920
but most guys are bigger and
stronger and men make all the rape.

2285
02:13:28,820 --> 02:13:31,830
The women aren't out there raping
dudes, right? It's all men.

2286
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:35,790
So if a guy has his dick out
and he's jerking off scary shit,

2287
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:39,030
that's why it's scary.
It's creepy if a girl,

2288
02:13:39,031 --> 02:13:41,310
if you go over a girl's house
and for whatever reason she goes,

2289
02:13:41,311 --> 02:13:44,310
I want you to watch it sit down.
You fucking, you know, fucking fuck.

2290
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:49,170
She starts fingering herself. Fucking
whoa. Yeah, but you wouldn't laugh.

2291
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:52,020
You would laugh and you
would come back to here.

2292
02:13:52,170 --> 02:13:55,620
And we would talk about it cause I know
I can get out of time. Yeah, right.

2293
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:58,680
We'd be crying laughing, but it
wouldn't be like you were in danger.

2294
02:13:58,890 --> 02:14:01,270
But if a guy is with safety,

2295
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:06,280
you have a daughter and your daughter
weighs 110 pounds and she's with a guy and

2296
02:14:06,781 --> 02:14:09,000
the guy wants to jerk off in front of her.
Yeah.

2297
02:14:09,150 --> 02:14:13,760
And he asked to do it and she
says yes cause she scared. Fuck.

2298
02:14:13,770 --> 02:14:15,840
Then it's like what,
what would actually happen?

2299
02:14:15,841 --> 02:14:20,790
And see he hasn't really said anything
other than the stories are true.

2300
02:14:21,390 --> 02:14:26,310
And you know this is come from a
guy that sounds like, you know,

2301
02:14:26,610 --> 02:14:29,460
cause you have two daughters. Yeah. Well
it's so you have to think like that.

2302
02:14:29,730 --> 02:14:32,250
Well you have to think like that
as a human being, right? Yeah.

2303
02:14:32,251 --> 02:14:33,330
But I'm saying to you,

2304
02:14:33,450 --> 02:14:35,920
it's probably the first thing you think
of cause you have two daughters. Right.

2305
02:14:35,921 --> 02:14:39,150
But I don't think that's what he did.
I think from,

2306
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:42,810
I can't say too much cause I don't know.

2307
02:14:43,440 --> 02:14:48,240
But I think he did some regrettable
things and I think he would admit that.

2308
02:14:48,241 --> 02:14:52,110
But I don't think he did what a lot of
people are claiming he did in terms of,

2309
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:53,040
that's what I've heard,

2310
02:14:53,040 --> 02:14:56,880
how often he did it or who he did
or what the circumstances were,

2311
02:14:56,910 --> 02:15:01,140
but it was either way.
There's no defending when it
was bad. No, it's not good.

2312
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:04,140
There's no difference.
It's a terrible thing to do.

2313
02:15:04,710 --> 02:15:09,000
But what's the punishment for that?
You know how much I punish her?

2314
02:15:09,010 --> 02:15:13,230
Do you not pay for it? You're lost
all his jobs, lost all his TV deals,

2315
02:15:13,260 --> 02:15:17,880
$35 million in a year of work and people
still were saying no, but he's still,

2316
02:15:17,881 --> 02:15:20,960
he's fine. I've heard that
argument that he's fine. Like what?

2317
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:25,650
These are also, these are also things
that he did like more than a decade ago.

2318
02:15:25,651 --> 02:15:29,700
Right. What, when do you
offer someone compassion?

2319
02:15:29,700 --> 02:15:33,360
Like when do you, when do you let
some explain themselves? When do you,

2320
02:15:33,361 --> 02:15:36,450
when is it enough is enough or
should he have to do something?

2321
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:40,580
Like what would people like someone to
do? Well, I think they're coming because,

2322
02:15:40,790 --> 02:15:44,100
because there's only a year and then
he's back and killing it because he's so

2323
02:15:44,101 --> 02:15:47,700
good at comedy because like with Tiger
Woods, right? People hated tiger.

2324
02:15:47,730 --> 02:15:48,331
Well there was that,

2325
02:15:48,331 --> 02:15:51,870
but there was also the material
that got leaked when he came back.

2326
02:15:51,871 --> 02:15:55,770
So people were upset at the jokes.
The parkland joke. Yeah. Not the best.

2327
02:15:56,080 --> 02:15:59,610
It's that shit falls in line with
how he's always done jokes though.

2328
02:15:59,670 --> 02:16:01,830
I told he's always,
whether he did this or not,

2329
02:16:01,950 --> 02:16:05,850
he says the fucked up thing to say.
It's part of what makes him really funny.

2330
02:16:05,940 --> 02:16:10,860
And he does that in real life too.
It's not, it's a style of comedy man.

2331
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:15,120
I mean it's just like a Quentin
Tarantino has a style of making movies.

2332
02:16:15,480 --> 02:16:17,530
His style of comedy is
to say fucked up thing.

2333
02:16:17,531 --> 02:16:20,310
So that compounded the fact that people
were upset at them that a year ago,

2334
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:24,930
you know, he said he was going to take
some time off and it's, um, I don't,

2335
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:25,201
you know,

2336
02:16:25,201 --> 02:16:29,680
I think it's really important to know
that I don't know what happened and,

2337
02:16:29,770 --> 02:16:33,490
and you know,
he knows and they know and it's,

2338
02:16:34,730 --> 02:16:37,600
it's never good when someone's upset
that you jerked off in front of them.

2339
02:16:37,710 --> 02:16:41,140
That miss I get time,
which is never good for anybody,

2340
02:16:41,170 --> 02:16:44,680
but also him losing $35 million
in only being out a year.

2341
02:16:44,681 --> 02:16:48,430
I think people are upset that have
such a quick turnaround. Like Tj,

2342
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:52,820
is that a quick turnaround,
man? I mean, not as a comic,
but for, to the, to the, uh,

2343
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:56,500
normal person like a year. That
ain't shit dude. But as a comic,

2344
02:16:56,501 --> 02:17:01,330
not to be able to do, let's imagine that
he's going to live another 50 years,

2345
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:05,890
right? A year, a year out of 50.

2346
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:11,800
It's like a 2% right. Yeah. It's a lot.
It's a lot and a lot of money. Yeah.

2347
02:17:12,300 --> 02:17:16,420
Now now, oh, now compare this
to Tj Dillashaw two years,

2348
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:20,920
two years of he's 31.
Yeah.

2349
02:17:20,950 --> 02:17:24,370
One 35 or not a lot of fights left now.

2350
02:17:24,400 --> 02:17:28,540
Two years is almost a death
sentence. It might be, is that fair?

2351
02:17:29,710 --> 02:17:34,450
That's a good question.
I mean the real question is,

2352
02:17:34,810 --> 02:17:39,460
would he have even been able
to pursue that weight class?

2353
02:17:40,930 --> 02:17:45,790
Like with what you were saying in terms
of like having the advantage of the EPO?

2354
02:17:45,820 --> 02:17:48,250
Yeah. Wonder if he would have
been able to pursue training,

2355
02:17:48,400 --> 02:17:51,130
but at the same way in hindsight,
what a terrible idea.

2356
02:17:53,320 --> 02:17:57,070
You know, I don't know what the thought
process was, but it's definitely,

2357
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:59,670
definitely not good. And um, it,

2358
02:18:00,100 --> 02:18:03,490
it doesn't take away from how talented
and skillful he is as a fighter.

2359
02:18:04,090 --> 02:18:06,940
And if that's the only time he did it,
it's kind of understandable.

2360
02:18:06,970 --> 02:18:09,820
That's what I'm [inaudible] yeah.
If that's the only time,

2361
02:18:11,050 --> 02:18:14,020
but I think honestly, all bullshit
aside, I think you are right.

2362
02:18:14,021 --> 02:18:17,740
As far as don't test anybody else. Don't,
don't go back and test everybody. No.

2363
02:18:18,880 --> 02:18:21,100
Unless you want to spend a lot of money.

2364
02:18:21,250 --> 02:18:24,310
The one of the things they were saying
that like to test everyone for EPO,

2365
02:18:24,311 --> 02:18:27,010
it costs an additional two and
a half million dollars a year.

2366
02:18:27,190 --> 02:18:30,040
Something ridiculous like that. I might've
made some numbers, stopped doing that,

2367
02:18:30,250 --> 02:18:34,330
divide that money amongst the fighters.
Ooh, I can watch them go off any test.

2368
02:18:34,690 --> 02:18:36,340
Don't care to give the fetish more money.

2369
02:18:37,690 --> 02:18:40,960
What style been and Kelvin did
and Max Holloway and Dustin Poray,

2370
02:18:40,990 --> 02:18:45,520
they should be set for quite some time.
But here's the thing,

2371
02:18:45,730 --> 02:18:50,050
if we look over the history and really
are only testing pool would be Connor

2372
02:18:50,051 --> 02:18:52,690
McGregor who Deborah has to fight again.
Nate Diaz,

2373
02:18:52,691 --> 02:18:55,530
I guess you get thrown to that. Who?
They make life changing money, right?

2374
02:18:55,540 --> 02:18:58,030
They don't find a lot,
do they? No. And here,

2375
02:18:58,090 --> 02:19:01,060
here's the question because if you give,
I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt you,

2376
02:19:01,061 --> 02:19:03,430
but let's say, you know, if
he have certain fighters,

2377
02:19:03,790 --> 02:19:08,650
$20 million like you want me to do
what now? And they don't fight, right?

2378
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:12,850
So if you're Dana, you're like, listen,
look at Conor [inaudible], Nate Diaz,

2379
02:19:12,851 --> 02:19:16,540
when they get this boatload of money,
we can't give them to fight.

2380
02:19:16,750 --> 02:19:21,070
They have the sports too
hard. They won't do it. Hmm.

2381
02:19:22,060 --> 02:19:24,880
That's interesting. I know. So
to keep, to keep 'em hungry,

2382
02:19:25,540 --> 02:19:28,090
we got to pay him this hit with
that. It's so fucked up. So if,

2383
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:31,120
I'm not saying it's the right thing to do,
but I'm saying if you're Dana,

2384
02:19:31,130 --> 02:19:33,200
from his standpoint, you're like,
do you think they get really,

2385
02:19:33,201 --> 02:19:36,920
they don't fight way they really think
that way. I don't think that's the case.

2386
02:19:37,020 --> 02:19:39,440
You don't think it's a side effect
of making boat loads of money,

2387
02:19:39,441 --> 02:19:41,810
but I think they tried to make boatloads
of money cause it doesn't happen very

2388
02:19:41,811 --> 02:19:46,580
often. It only happens with a Rhonda
Rousey or Conor McGregor or some gigantic,

2389
02:19:46,581 --> 02:19:50,510
huge star like a Nate Diaz did. You
have to be a gigantic, huge state. Yeah,

2390
02:19:50,511 --> 02:19:54,560
but that's, that's rare. There's so few
of those guys. There's so few of those.

2391
02:19:54,650 --> 02:19:58,850
The idea that you would try to pay
people less because you want to keep them

2392
02:19:58,851 --> 02:20:03,200
hungry. Because if they'd become giant
superstars and they're not hungry,

2393
02:20:03,201 --> 02:20:05,000
then they stopped fighting,
then we're not paying more.

2394
02:20:05,090 --> 02:20:09,590
So what you're saying is pretend
you're not there, not giant superstars.

2395
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:12,560
Even when they are know the
giant superstars still get paid,

2396
02:20:12,561 --> 02:20:16,790
but they also have crazy demands.
They want to fight who they want to fight,

2397
02:20:16,820 --> 02:20:18,350
they want to do it when
they want to do it.

2398
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:22,430
And there's all sorts of jockeying
going on back and forth. I mean,

2399
02:20:22,431 --> 02:20:26,060
I don't know what happened with
Nate Diaz and Dustin Poray,

2400
02:20:26,061 --> 02:20:29,150
but they were supposed to fight
first fight and Dustin got injured.

2401
02:20:29,240 --> 02:20:33,280
But so Nate was scheduled for a fight
and he's never pulled out of a fight that

2402
02:20:33,281 --> 02:20:35,140
has been scheduled for as far
as I can remember him. No.

2403
02:20:35,150 --> 02:20:38,210
He was going to fight that fight and then
went to happen. That made other offers.

2404
02:20:38,211 --> 02:20:39,350
You just like, I'm good. Right?

2405
02:20:39,351 --> 02:20:43,520
But let's imagine that if Dustin poray
did not pull out of that fight, would,

2406
02:20:43,521 --> 02:20:46,940
if he did fight Nate Diaz,
and what if Nate Diaz beat him?

2407
02:20:47,150 --> 02:20:51,830
The Nate Diaz could very well have
fought Max Holloway maybe Saturday night.

2408
02:20:51,850 --> 02:20:55,600
Yeah. Maybe. Maybe if you
paid them enough, it may
be. I'm sure he would. They,

2409
02:20:55,630 --> 02:20:58,910
they might've decided to make that shit
happen, you know? And you know what?

2410
02:20:58,940 --> 02:21:02,030
I bet it would have been. Yeah, that
was it. That was the face to face off.

2411
02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:06,710
I bet that would have been a very
entertaining fight to God. Oh my God.

2412
02:21:06,711 --> 02:21:10,190
Acts and 80th Bolkestein sane cardiac.
Yes.

2413
02:21:10,250 --> 02:21:14,690
Insane volume striking. That would
be an incredible fight, man. Fuck.

2414
02:21:14,691 --> 02:21:18,590
That would be a great fighter. You
fight. That'd be a great fight. Yeah.

2415
02:21:18,591 --> 02:21:20,510
Max and Nick would be,
would have been insane,

2416
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:24,080
but Max was going to fight Dustin Poirier
and you know, he could be looked at,

2417
02:21:24,081 --> 02:21:27,260
would be a big fight.
Dustin Poria if he doesn't fight Khabib,

2418
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:31,100
if for whatever reason they decide to
go with Nate over could be, they're not,

2419
02:21:31,730 --> 02:21:34,100
they're going to do, could
be next. Yeah, in September.

2420
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:39,140
Well maybe can be fights the winner
or uh, the winter rather fights. Nate.

2421
02:21:39,590 --> 02:21:44,000
That could be possible too. If he really
still weren't Tony. Tony Ferguson.

2422
02:21:44,970 --> 02:21:49,940
Yeah. God Damn. And Kate. She's
still in the mix. I mean, Katie,

2423
02:21:51,110 --> 02:21:55,960
he's deep in the mix. That superheat
Boza he's so excited before.

2424
02:21:55,970 --> 02:21:59,360
Now he's right there. How
can you deny that? I mean,

2425
02:21:59,361 --> 02:22:03,710
what a fucking division man.
Amazing. What a fucking division.

2426
02:22:03,860 --> 02:22:08,720
It's crazy. How about that dude in
one fc that knocked out Alvarez.

2427
02:22:08,870 --> 02:22:13,820
I know. Nasty. UCAN. What a crazy name
too. How about mighty mouse though?

2428
02:22:13,880 --> 02:22:18,150
Getting the wind? Yeah. I'm still waiting
for sage Northcutt to fight. Um, yeah, no,

2429
02:22:18,151 --> 02:22:22,760
she's a tough fight to fight. And cosmo
Alexander his tough fight. Dude. Cosmos.

2430
02:22:22,761 --> 02:22:26,130
No punk. That dude's a nasty
Moyie Thai fighter. I got to beat

2431
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:29,580
John Wayne Park. He's really, really
good. Yeah, he's built like an Adonis too.

2432
02:22:29,581 --> 02:22:34,170
That's going to be a best
bod contest between those
two. Yeah, that's first team.

2433
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:36,900
First team. Both of them.
Dangerous fight for, um,

2434
02:22:36,990 --> 02:22:39,840
sage Northcutt while they're standing.
If he can't take it to the ground.

2435
02:22:40,840 --> 02:22:43,290
You mean stage is a very good
striker and he's very fast,

2436
02:22:43,291 --> 02:22:48,270
but cosmos worldclass he's something
special. He's something special. Nasty,

2437
02:22:48,300 --> 02:22:52,680
nasty. Moy Timon. Monster.
Yeah. Big Guy too. You know,

2438
02:22:53,490 --> 02:22:58,350
he's jacked. His thick sage is
such a nice kid. Could be nicer.

2439
02:22:59,010 --> 02:23:01,980
Couldn't be nicer. It's
almost fake. Did you,

2440
02:23:02,310 --> 02:23:06,510
were you surprised that the
UFC let them go? Uh, no.

2441
02:23:06,870 --> 02:23:09,750
I'm not surprised by anything you'll see.
Does not surprise.

2442
02:23:10,110 --> 02:23:12,900
They don't need anyone. I thought
they were grooming him. Me Too.

2443
02:23:12,901 --> 02:23:15,090
And put a lot of marketing behind
him. They're like, fuck it.

2444
02:23:15,091 --> 02:23:17,760
We're going to go on
ESPN. We're good. Well,

2445
02:23:17,820 --> 02:23:21,120
so what do you think the
future is going to be like?

2446
02:23:21,150 --> 02:23:25,290
Do you think there's going to be that
this is going to be how it is for most

2447
02:23:25,291 --> 02:23:27,360
sports.
They're going to be watched on apps.

2448
02:23:27,361 --> 02:23:30,660
You think they'll ever have that for like
the NFL? Oh, hundred percent. They just,

2449
02:23:30,661 --> 02:23:33,720
the future. The UFC is
just, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2450
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:36,950
Pick the last two years at a
Thursday night games have been on a,

2451
02:23:36,990 --> 02:23:39,130
at least last year was on Amazon prime.
They were,

2452
02:23:39,131 --> 02:23:41,150
they were on Twitter on to
twitch for a little while.

2453
02:23:41,151 --> 02:23:44,030
They're on Twitter last year, so they're,
they're doing all sorts of stuff.

2454
02:23:44,031 --> 02:23:48,620
The NBA has talked about moving
towards, uh, being maybe on twitch.

2455
02:23:48,650 --> 02:23:51,450
They've even talked about shortening
our season or doing different stuff that

2456
02:23:51,470 --> 02:23:52,800
they just had a big conference about that

2457
02:23:53,330 --> 02:23:56,570
because he made the smart move. Yeah.
It's a smart move. It's, there's a smart,

2458
02:23:56,571 --> 02:23:58,730
because they're getting out way ahead.
That's what it is.

2459
02:23:58,760 --> 02:24:02,360
I feel like once everyone's TV's hooked
up to the Internet cause right now it's

2460
02:24:02,361 --> 02:24:06,950
not everyone. No. You know.
Yeah. It's a lot of people,

2461
02:24:07,010 --> 02:24:10,400
but it's not everybody. It's going
to be everybody. For sure. Dude.

2462
02:24:10,401 --> 02:24:13,430
I got a role they get to my
kid on 6:00 PM I know, man.
