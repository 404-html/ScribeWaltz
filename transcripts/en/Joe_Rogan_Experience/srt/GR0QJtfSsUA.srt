00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello Freak bitches,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,890
Yo blackout and go to head to a bar.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:07,371
Well,

4
00:00:07,371 --> 00:00:10,130
the problem is the titles are
actually waking up in the song.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,000
I mean,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,740
I go,

7
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,110
no,

8
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,250
here's the honestly what happened.

9
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:15,590
So I went to my buddy Dave Cobb,

10
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:16,401
he's a producer there.

11
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:18,230
I actually met him through
your buddy sturgeon.

12
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:18,980
Actually,

13
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,731
I didn't really meet him,

14
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:20,564
but everyone,

15
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,510
there's a bunch of articles that
said Sturge will introduce me to him.

16
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:24,690
So I'm just going with it.

17
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,030
Well,

18
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,290
it means [inaudible] narrative.

19
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:27,801
Yeah,

20
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:28,281
it helps.

21
00:00:28,281 --> 00:00:28,970
But um,

22
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:29,803
so uh,

23
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,690
and I'd kind of been kicking around in
Nashville for like about 15 years or so

24
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:36,890
and with no success at all.

25
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:37,101
I mean,

26
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:37,934
just bullshit.

27
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:38,740
And I'd been to,

28
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,110
had my ass kicked my dick
in the dirt as they say.

29
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:42,960
And then,

30
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,490
um,

31
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:43,821
I was like,

32
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:44,241
fuck it,

33
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:45,770
this is going to be my last record.

34
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,161
I was like,

35
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:47,660
I'm going to whatever they call it,

36
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:51,680
drop the Mike put out a really fucking
dirty ass record though at record.

37
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,140
I was wanting to make
and not pull any punches.

38
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:55,700
I was going to just pay for my cell phone.

39
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,543
It myself.

40
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,080
And I had a feeling this was going to
get me banned from Nashville and then I'd

41
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:01,790
just leave cause I fucking broke.

42
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,270
So we made this fucking dirty record
and it's probably about as dirt and it's

43
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:09,321
not,

44
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:11,570
it wasn't even like I want to
make the dirties country record.

45
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,404
It was just like,

46
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,510
what's happened now in Nashville,

47
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,660
cause it's turned into such
fucking bullshit is um,

48
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,150
well money's happened,

49
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:20,600
right?

50
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,010
Well what's happened is country
radio was no longer a country music.

51
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,030
What is it?

52
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:26,863
It's,

53
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,510
and I didn't know this any more new,

54
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,260
cause I don't listen to that dog shit,

55
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,520
but I,

56
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:32,280
um,

57
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,880
actually heard the best
explanation for it the other day.

58
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:35,601
Steve Earle,

59
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:36,560
who's a hero of mine,

60
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:39,710
he was on this Chris Shifflet podcast.

61
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,161
I don't know if you know,

62
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:40,490
he is,

63
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,040
he's a guitar player for Sue Fund.

64
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,160
Has a good podcast where he
interviews a lot of country music.

65
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:44,840
She loves country.

66
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,590
Oh Wow.

67
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,880
And Steve Earle goes,

68
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:47,714
um,

69
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:49,520
you could say,

70
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,121
you could hear him.

71
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:51,110
He's kind of talking around it.

72
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,944
He goes

73
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,990
country today,

74
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:54,710
you know,

75
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,420
mainstream corporate countries.

76
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:57,980
He goes,

77
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,540
it's rap music for people.

78
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,490
And he pauses.

79
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:00,771
He's like,

80
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:03,800
it's rap music for people and he
just keep hearing him pause like,

81
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:04,491
is he going to say it?

82
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,300
He goes,

83
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,350
it's rep people for it's rap music for
people who are scared of black people.

84
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,730
And it's true.

85
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,270
It does.

86
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:12,890
It does.

87
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,040
If it affects it a lot.

88
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,671
Our team,

89
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:17,160
we had this team called the Molly boys,

90
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,210
so that was my rectum.

91
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:20,150
Molly boys like they're all
the boys are all on Molly.

92
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,250
All met hanging out doing Molly
and what an athletic crew.

93
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,181
A lot of edits.

94
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,610
You very positive squad.

95
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,370
The closet of squad.

96
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,410
He's hugging everybody.

97
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,651
Give me a hug,

98
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:35,160
bro.

99
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,341
Yo,

100
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:37,080
we lose by 30 it's cool man.

101
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:38,760
I love books and love your pockets.

102
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,581
Yeah,

103
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:41,791
no,

104
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,240
we look like fucking clowns are jerseys
had like Molly Ringwald face on him and

105
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,074
it said Mala,

106
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,601
please show me.

107
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,830
I want to put that shit on Lauren,

108
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,890
you got to fucking join the squad.

109
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,890
Yo Dude.

110
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,780
Amen.

111
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,440
Come on.

112
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:55,851
I think I,

113
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:58,890
I think I might even have one in
the fucking backseat of my car.

114
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,100
Boy's

115
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,260
Jersey with your name all over.

116
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:02,110
We need to have that.

117
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:03,220
You're going to after the show.

118
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,420
You got to give me that photo and I'm
going to put it on Instagram status.

119
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,660
Goddamn hilarious.

120
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,020
Yo,

121
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,640
my boy Bernard designed this shit.

122
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,421
Molly boys.

123
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:10,691
Yes.

124
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,470
Here it is.

125
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,400
Look at these jerseys.

126
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,600
Oh my God.

127
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,160
Happened to her man.

128
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,360
I don't,

129
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,840
uh,

130
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,460
she's been in a couple films.

131
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:27,430
I saw her in something
in the news recently,

132
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:27,970
but no,

133
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,810
I don't know what happened,

134
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:29,350
man.

135
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,550
That's a weird world.

136
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,320
She peaked that peak,

137
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:32,830
Bro.

138
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,590
The eighties movie world is a weird world.

139
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,210
I'm surprised that people selling press
pills haven't put her face on like press

140
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,044
pill yet.

141
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,250
That would,

142
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,450
that would sell like wildfire.

143
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,373
Anybody

144
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,800
out there and making press
pills in your bathtub,

145
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,300
monitoring wells face on them.

146
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,110
I think the only thing that took me a
while to get used to was so much MCT oil.

147
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,531
Yeah,

148
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:54,550
you gotta be careful with that though.

149
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,450
I text you yesterday I was running,

150
00:03:56,451 --> 00:03:57,820
Matt took this,

151
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,720
a bunch of snow,

152
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,381
MCT oil.

153
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:00,071
I swear to God.

154
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:00,610
I was like,

155
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,443
it's Venice.

156
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,590
I might as well just shit my pants,

157
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:03,340
right?

158
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,630
Like no one's gonna give a fuck.

159
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,890
I will just shit everywhere.

160
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,670
There's a tipping point with MCT
oil where it just opens a flow.

161
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,523
There's no,

162
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,450
there's no like there's no like third
gear first or fucking six care man.

163
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:20,021
Where is it?

164
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,790
Is it like two tablespoons?

165
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,511
I'm trying to figure it out.

166
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:23,650
Like three tablespoons.

167
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,340
You're gone.

168
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,980
That should is the perfect
storm for explosive diarrhea.

169
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:28,300
If you want it clean out the pipes,

170
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,320
you don't need a colonic.

171
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,023
Like God,

172
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,931
I gotta take a shit.

173
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:33,220
It's like it's coming.

174
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:34,580
You better fucking figure it out

175
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,850
but up and you're
tensing up your in herds.

176
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,350
You're trying to like clamp
it down to stop running.

177
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:41,860
I was like,

178
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,050
I better think I pick him up.

179
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,260
Game plan here in my mouth started
watering and there's that battle that you

180
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:47,591
play.

181
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:48,490
It's very similar.

182
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:50,230
The battle when you're trying not to come,

183
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,770
you know the battle when
you try not to come loose,

184
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,150
just squeezing it.

185
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,770
Dickish it is.

186
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,530
It's very similar to that.

187
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,120
I don't want to shit my pants.

188
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:01,960
Pow.

189
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,010
You have willpower.

190
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,650
Cause there's some weak people in the
world that just shit their pants more than

191
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,220
they shut.

192
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,490
You can't be my friend if you,

193
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,390
if you just give up and
shit your pants loose.

194
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,843
Fun.

195
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,590
Keep my butt tight.

196
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,700
You just got no will power man.

197
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,421
Yeah,

198
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:24,250
but then I've Shit my pants before too.

199
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,620
It's like here's the deal.

200
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,400
It's okay to tap out.

201
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:32,350
Just don't tap out like a bitch.

202
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:33,410
Not at least put up a fight.

203
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,080
Going to lose the fight.

204
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,840
Be actually in a position
where you have to tap.

205
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,300
You just tap cause you're
sweating and it's just,

206
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:41,420
you have no other option.

207
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,850
He Calvin lighty one time,

208
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:47,850
said he shit his pants and then
showed up with regular beds.

209
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,070
Well that's one I just can't do.

210
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,180
He said that he couldn't make
it to the show at the ice house.

211
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,950
I looked at the,

212
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,030
because he shit his pants and I said,

213
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,230
what are you talking about?

214
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:00,741
He goes,

215
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:01,401
I shit my pants.

216
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:02,234
I can't come.

217
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,721
I said,

218
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:03,470
Brian,

219
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,240
these people came to see you.

220
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,500
They're here to see you.

221
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,680
And he goes,

222
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:10,251
what should I do?

223
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:10,760
I go,

224
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,510
go to a fucking bathroom at a gas station,

225
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,250
take your fucking pants off,

226
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,660
throw them in the sink,

227
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,220
clean the shit out of your pants,

228
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,210
wring them out,

229
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,370
and they get over here with
wet pants on and a story.

230
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,050
How old is he at this time?

231
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,411
Oh,

232
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:25,244
like a year ago.

233
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,670
This is years ago.

234
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,340
What should I do?

235
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,810
You got to show up,

236
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:30,290
man.

237
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,160
You got to show up.

238
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,900
Like people don't want
to smell shit on you,

239
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,170
so if you could just get to
the bathroom for five minutes,

240
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:37,040
you can fix all that.

241
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,410
It's going to take a little work
and you get to wear wet pants,

242
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,790
but that's what you have to do.

243
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,580
Duty paid paid the there.

244
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,160
Brian Cowen fans I think will fuck you up,

245
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:46,490
dude.

246
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,271
Hanging out your pants.

247
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:48,051
Tell some jokes.

248
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:48,561
So he shows up.

249
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:51,530
10 minutes later his
pants were dry and I go,

250
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,210
what happened?

251
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:53,840
And he said,

252
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,000
oh,

253
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,340
I had a pair of pants in my trunk.

254
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,100
The worst slide I see a
pair of pants or your trunk.

255
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,120
I don't know what.

256
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,310
I didn't even want to ask
what was really going on?

257
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,173
Get into it.

258
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,490
You Shit your pants as a grown man.

259
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,031
I mean,

260
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:06,440
it ain't a simple procedure.

261
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,020
There's some steps you got to me.

262
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:12,470
That's the next next shirt is I had
another pair of pants in my truck carries

263
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:13,700
pants in the trunk.

264
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,390
Have you ever had a pair of pants in
your trunk and you didn't know about?

265
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,550
Never Shit your pants and go.

266
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,220
What is the odds that
the pants are my trunk?

267
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,270
Never.

268
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,310
I guess when I'm older I might,

269
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,210
I might have a baseball hat in there.

270
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,840
I can cover my balls.

271
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:30,860
I love that story.

272
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,150
Kind of all the lies.

273
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,350
Shitting your pants.

274
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:33,840
I don't know.

275
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,673
I'm gonna need,

276
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,530
I'm gonna need to see some stuff.

277
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,120
I do not know if it was a lie,

278
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:38,780
but Goddamn,

279
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,130
he smelled so normal.

280
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,331
I mean,

281
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:43,290
I would just only calendar.

282
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,390
It's the best.

283
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,770
It's the only she could do that.

284
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,710
There's only so much you
can learn from people.

285
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,311
You know?

286
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:50,001
At a certain point,

287
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:53,720
you have to understand that what makes
them special is because it's stem.

288
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,673
It comes out of them.

289
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,641
You can't learn that.

290
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,474
You can't really take it,

291
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,320
but what'd you can take is the feeling
of they had their own identity and you've

292
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:02,720
got to find that in yourself.

293
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:04,670
That's the thing that you
want to ultimately get.

294
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,571
You know what I mean?

295
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:07,160
You want to be influenced
by all these people,

296
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,850
but the main influence that I think you
should learn from the greats or that

297
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,540
you,

298
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,190
you have to find it in yourself.

299
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:13,521
You know,

300
00:08:13,521 --> 00:08:15,110
you can't rely on it anybody else.

301
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:15,741
Right.

302
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:19,250
And I think to see it in someone else
gives you that inspiration to try to find

303
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:19,970
it in yourself.

304
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,290
So I used to search for it,

305
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,180
just constantly going
to be at the library,

306
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,830
getting up VHS,

307
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,873
you know,

308
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,910
videos and just watching,

309
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,890
rewinding and watching.

310
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:35,891
And then I would drive 19 hours from
Akron to Mississippi just to like maybe

311
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:39,140
find a musician who I
heard lived in some town.

312
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,101
You know what I mean?

313
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:42,800
Just because I wanted to see it,

314
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,491
you know?

315
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:43,760
And,

316
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,750
and when I find,

317
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,613
when I found it,

318
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,450
this shit is life changing,

319
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:47,751
man.

320
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:48,584
I mean,

321
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,200
I was like 17 and I went to Greenville,

322
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:51,801
Mississippi,

323
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:54,020
and I just started asking
around for this musician named,

324
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,290
his name was t model Ford and he made
some really cool team model Ford.

325
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,540
Yeah.

326
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,790
He was total bad ass.

327
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,050
He played a death metal guitar,

328
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,580
like really a Pv.

329
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,331
Yeah.

330
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:05,850
And it said with the letters
who put on a mailbox,

331
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:10,440
it's like said team motto for the Tail
Dragger he had it spray painted on his

332
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:13,650
trailer that he pulled around
with his Lincoln and I,

333
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,130
wow.

334
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,761
Just go on there.

335
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:18,270
I would never want to just
like become that person.

336
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,110
Right.

337
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,943
But

338
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,110
whether they're from Mississippi or
they're like a classical composer from

339
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:25,944
Germany,

340
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,310
there's a thing that these
all these guys have in common.

341
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:30,720
And it's like a sense of self,

342
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,943
you know what I mean?

343
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,960
Anybody I've ever met has a real,

344
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,690
just a confidence that,

345
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,560
you know,

346
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,450
even though they may not be
the best at certain things,

347
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:41,700
they can like bring out
the best in themselves,

348
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,061
you know,

349
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:42,320
and that,

350
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,170
and that's like enough.

351
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,633
Do you know what I mean?

352
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,030
[inaudible].
