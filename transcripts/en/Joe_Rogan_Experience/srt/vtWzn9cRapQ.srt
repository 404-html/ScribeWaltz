1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,620
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,270
but learn how to do it correctly.

3
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:07,260
It's also one of the most beneficial when
it comes to your ability to use it in

4
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:10,440
a sport or any kind of physical activity
or just for regular shit around the

5
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:10,681
house,

6
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:11,880
being able to pick up a couch,

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,331
you know,

8
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:14,190
being able to lift things that are heavy.

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:14,790
The,

10
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,590
the kind of weightlifting strength
that you get from kettlebells is,

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,400
is a full body strength.

12
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:19,830
It,

13
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,663
it's one of the,

14
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,990
one of the best exercises for improving
athletics because when you're using

15
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:28,380
something that requires you to
use your whole body to lift,

16
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,340
then your body gets used to working as
a unit as opposed to the like the way

17
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:35,070
they used to do it in the
old school bodybuilder days
where some people still do

18
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,510
with where they isolate,

19
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:36,781
you know,

20
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:40,140
like today I'm going to do biceps and
triceps and tomorrow I'm going to do

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,660
calves pitch that says you're going to,

22
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:44,880
you're going to have a bunch of confused
muscles that don't know how to work

23
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:45,510
together.

24
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,410
Everybody's strong,

25
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:47,970
but nobody speaks to
each other's language.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,750
You ever see like a really big goofy
bodybuilder guy tried to try to fight,

27
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,310
try throws punches of people.

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,450
They fall down,

29
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:55,380
they're all tipsy there.

30
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:57,390
The whole body's designed fucked up.

31
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,610
It's like there's too
much weight up there.

32
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:01,450
Do you ever see one of them
try and comb their hair,

33
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,110
clean their ass?

34
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:08,893
Ah,

35
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,060
some of them are so big these days
that they kind of keep getting bigger.

36
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:13,890
I guess that's how bodybuilding works.

37
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,660
I mean I guess that's what it is,

38
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:15,960
right?

39
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,820
The biggest guy now it's like who's
the biggest freak and those the,

40
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,420
so every year they get bigger and bigger.

41
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:22,254
Right?

42
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,460
I'm still in the and nigger
days of my knowledge,

43
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,720
but not funny that that's
when they had it right.

44
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,740
That's when they had it right.

45
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,020
Like in sports and
exited a ton of shit too.

46
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,120
Like he talks about how
he did a ton of steroids,

47
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,380
but he,

48
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:42,381
his physique was incredible and impressive
but not excessive in the point that

49
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:43,740
you have today.

50
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,720
You know like today you have these
guys that are just 90% steroids.

51
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:49,690
Like you look at their body,

52
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:51,330
you just waiting for like steroids,

53
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:52,690
DePaul out of their father,

54
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:56,010
their ankles like them to be standing
in a puddle of stuff like pull up a

55
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:56,610
picture.

56
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,480
The dividends between Arnold
Schwarzenegger and whoever the newest,

57
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:03,070
latest Mr Olympia guy is because they,

58
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,130
these mother fuckers is
just getting ridiculous.

59
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,320
It looks like their skin
is stretched so thin.

60
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:08,550
It's just going to like burst.

61
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,230
So unreal.

62
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,520
It's so unreal what they look like now
cone and we'll get that with the black

63
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:16,770
and white ones and him bodybuilding
was when he was in his prime.

64
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,813
Like look at that.

65
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,820
I mean obviously a fucking huge,

66
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:21,660
huge man.

67
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,180
I mean the dude is goddamn enormous.

68
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,010
That looks almost like was shooting dope.

69
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,893
Does not look fake.

70
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,091
We shoot,

71
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:28,924
it's a painting,

72
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,893
a painting.

73
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:30,871
It's a painting,

74
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:31,650
right?

75
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,990
It's hard to see in this resolution went,

76
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:34,590
that's real.

77
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,423
That's legit.

78
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,200
What does this click for?

79
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:38,070
Full resolution.

80
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:38,760
Oh,

81
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,350
it's one of those stupid websites,

82
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,810
but they deal with the,

83
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,480
that's why you never want to get
all sports and they nigger famous.

84
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,170
Well,

85
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,290
I'm not going to have a website that's
just a scam and they click on it like the

86
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,220
one scroll down there.

87
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:51,090
Scroll down there,

88
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,870
right?

89
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,051
No,

90
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:52,231
no,

91
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:52,381
no.

92
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:52,651
A little,

93
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:53,161
a little further.

94
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:53,581
Little further.

95
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:54,091
Little further.

96
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:54,924
A little further down.

97
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,050
There's some,

98
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,351
yeah,

99
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:59,184
like get those.

100
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,900
That one right there with him on stage
with his arms stretched out with all the

101
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:02,680
people behind them.

102
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,370
Yeah,

103
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,750
there you get a good image.

104
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,780
Okay.

105
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,060
She's is Christ.

106
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:07,930
Okay.

107
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,130
But perfect example because holy
shit was he fucking enormous,

108
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:12,710
right,

109
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,530
but not compared to today.

110
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:14,900
No,

111
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,030
it's not ridiculous.

112
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:21,050
It's like a dude that big today on
the street or in the UFC easily.

113
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,773
Well,

114
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,950
not really.

115
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:26,740
I guess sorta like glace and
t bowels pretty fucking big,

116
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,090
but not built like that.

117
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,700
I mean that's just one image of Arnold.

118
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,590
He was pretty fucking massive.

119
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,300
There's a few guys that are big like Tyron
Woodley who's a bad ass welterweight.

120
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,134
He's real big,

121
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,310
but now I'm like that.

122
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,600
It's a different kind of big,

123
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,220
they're,

124
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,770
they're like,

125
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,390
they're like super athlete big.

126
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,130
This is like a different thing.

127
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:48,580
This is like all this sports in
nigger six one or six two I think

128
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,283
I'm at him.

129
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,390
I met him recently at the UFC.

130
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,320
It was cool as fuck.

131
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:54,911
Oh,

132
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:55,411
you're doing it.

133
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:56,740
Doing an excellent job.

134
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,790
Like thank you.

135
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,810
I didn't get even cited like I'm pulling
heads would auto fuck it's worth the

136
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:02,644
nigger.

137
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,161
I was like,

138
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,070
this is crazy.

139
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,490
Nobody got no prize would
so here's the current guy.

140
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:07,420
I'm a fan.

141
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:08,410
Here's the current Chi.

142
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,170
Can I count like his muscles?

143
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:12,160
Muscles have muscles.

144
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:12,941
God,

145
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:14,450
that guy's fucking ridiculous.

146
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,403
Sleep pig.

147
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,830
It's like there's muscles
that don't even exist there.

148
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,221
I'm like,

149
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:20,800
he's got a hand muscles
lift his hand muscles.

150
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,740
Have you ever seen anybody
with hand muscles like that?

151
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,623
It was the most,

152
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,320
there's more muscles in his
hand in there are in my torso.

153
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,620
Let me just tell you one thing
that that guy works hard.

154
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:30,371
No doubt about it.

155
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:30,941
Ladies and gentlemen,

156
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:34,000
that guy does a lot of lifting and does
everything scientifically incorrect,

157
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,870
but what's fucked up is you can't
even get there without steroids.

158
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,150
You can't get there.

159
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,380
You can't get there.

160
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,430
That doesn't exist.

161
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:44,530
That's not a destination
and your navigation system,

162
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,720
it's his muscles look like
they need to be ironed.

163
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,620
It look wrinkled.

164
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,620
The only way you can get
that big without the juice,

165
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,990
you'd have to scan so much.

166
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,530
That's what those lines are.

167
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:55,780
It's like the skin looks like
you could just tear it goes.

168
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,840
That's the striations of the
muscle tissue underneath the skin.

169
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,940
The skin is just so thin
because their credit,

170
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:02,140
incredibly dehydrated,

171
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,270
not just low on fat,

172
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,510
not just massive amounts of
muscle but insanely dehydrated.

173
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,870
That's not possible without a bunch
of different factors and that look is

174
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:14,980
extremely unhealthy.

175
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,950
That's really more performance
art to me than it is like a sport.

176
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,341
Oh my.

177
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:22,570
I got the eye when I was competing in
taekwondo tournament so I got down to four

178
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,920
and a half body weight,

179
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,450
four and a half percent body weight,

180
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,910
body fat by a caliper.

181
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,840
Now I've been told recently that that
shit is not very accurate like calipers,

182
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:34,750
like you really got to get dunked
underwater or do electrical thing.

183
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,770
So you know I said four and a half percent
and a bunch of people correcting me.

184
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,400
Thank you for correcting me cause I
didn't know that the calipers were so bad,

185
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,510
but that's what they told me.

186
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:47,110
So like that would probably be
like 7% or something like that.

187
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,130
If I was,

188
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:48,641
I was super,

189
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:49,271
super lean,

190
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:53,050
but nothing compared to these
guys with these guys are doing.

191
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:53,870
I was,

192
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,310
I was working out with these guys are
doing is like getting real to death while

193
00:05:58,311 --> 00:05:59,600
keeping giant muscles.

194
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:01,160
It's fucking madness.

195
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:01,471
I,

196
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,070
this is the nuttiest
fucking sport of all time.

197
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,230
Yeah.

198
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,070
It's performance art.

199
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,000
This duck,

200
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,670
I will rip your Dick Clean Ass doors.

201
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,030
Those bank vault pass doors
of his like charge our beings,

202
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:16,600
um,

203
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,230
on a.com oh and nic,

204
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,660
we don't sell steroids both.
