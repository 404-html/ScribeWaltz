1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello,
freak bitches think you're totally

2
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:05,370
right,
and the amount of discipline it'll

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,400
you'll need on two fronts is great.
But here's the other thing.

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,300
You're such a cunt.

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:08,630
No,
no,

6
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,780
no.
Here's

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,140
the last one.
Real stakes.

8
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,213
What does that mean?

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,960
Stakes man?
One hundred percent.

10
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:21,520
But you get,
you lose your beard.

11
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,240
You had somebody.
Oh yeah,

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,160
you have
met in my life.

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,670
I asked you for what happened with BMI
is a measurement of the height and

14
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:37,900
weight,
but I said,

15
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:38,770
okay,
you got the height,

16
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,150
his height,
so just fucking measures height.

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,560
I'm six foot four man line.
There was no question.

18
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:52,040
It was like we all knew that,
hey,

19
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:58,450
it's time
to say

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,590
hey man,
did

21
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,860
you did you did.

22
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,540
Is it was after you right now for
reinforcing negative stereotypes.

23
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,573
Oh,

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,740
you're so of.
And when they got the national it was

25
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:29,891
going
to ask how many tweets did you get

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,513
calling you a?
Well,

27
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,450
I've got my nipples pierced diaper for
dates.

28
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,480
It's true.
Your voice breaking like Kevin

29
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,570
mccallister and
I said these boys basketball game you

30
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,010
did on your own
fucking play the guitar when you guys

31
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:02,000
are punching,
eating pizza.

32
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:05,610
I was down when you went to Asia for
four months to get out of a bag.

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,490
So at that point it became him taking
this opportunity,

34
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:13,050
going to denver,
being with Dwayne,

35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,280
getting paid into muscle farm thing and
then the whole thing with connor

36
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:21,570
happened on the TV show before this,
before any of this happened,

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,840
conor mcgregor started calling him a
columbus snake because me and connor had

38
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:30,630
one conversation.
We're sitting there and he goes,

39
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:31,291
he goes,
man,

40
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:35,760
congratulations on Tj defending his belt
because he was still on her team is last

41
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:37,350
title defense.
And I go,

42
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:37,831
thanks.
He goes,

43
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:40,470
but what's up with Dwayne?
Say that no one on your team wants to be

44
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:41,460
champions.
That's weird.

45
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:41,911
I said,
oh,

46
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:45,210
he's just bitter because you know,
he's trying to get everyone to go out to

47
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:46,360
his camp,
but you know,

48
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,150
he's just being a hater,
this and that.

49
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,990
And he goes.
He took that little bit of,

50
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,780
of,
of drama between me and Dwayne.

51
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,070
Dwayne saying that no one on our team
want to be your champions,

52
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:58,620
including cody,
who sent them a text,

53
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,100
a tweet that said,
hey,

54
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,980
keep my name out your mouth and you're
like a jealous girlfriend or whatever.

55
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,960
And he said he took that one little
thing and then next time you saw tj he

56
00:03:06,961 --> 00:03:07,794
goes,
oh,

57
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,510
there's a snake in the grass and just
built it in this big thing.

58
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,720
So that means either how well he is so
good at seeing people,

59
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,470
right?
Yeah.

60
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,690
So that took like what really happened,
which is tj got paid to go somewhere

61
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:21,250
else me and saying,
all right,

62
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:22,140
fine,
if you're going to do that,

63
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,170
cool.
But like,

64
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,310
you know,
if you're on that team,

65
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:28,660
you're on that team.
And then then connor turned the public

66
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:33,070
around on him
because it came out later after the

67
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:36,280
thing and so then you became the victim
and then he.

68
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,840
And now Tj is new stories that I,
I,

69
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:42,070
I got mad that he was trained with Duane
Ludwig and I kicked him off the team.

70
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:42,641
Well,
you know,

71
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:47,641
Tj now has a snake as his logo.
I know on the ultimate fighter he

72
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:49,060
brought in snakes,
you know what I mean?

73
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,680
He just,
he's at home with it,

74
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:52,090
you know,
he's cool with it.

75
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,240
So it's all good.
We're rewinding back a little bit like

76
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:56,710
if you want to be friends,
let's be friends,

77
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,120
but don't,
don't,

78
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:59,380
don't lie.

79
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,910
Do you think it was a good idea to write
that memo?

80
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,510
Like if you had to go back again,
if you were in front of your computer

81
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:07,520
and you're ready,
press send,

82
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,520
would you uh,
maybe I would wait for my year end

83
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:12,354
bonus.

84
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,520
Oh Man.

85
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,250
I mean I think I would have pushed
harder,

86
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:21,900
even harder on the diversity of
programs,

87
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:26,901
although I met with them personally and
I kept pinging them and I sent so many

88
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:30,390
emails.
I'm just trying to have a discussion

89
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:33,150
about this.
And I went through multiple other

90
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,420
programs and sent this document,
this exact document to them.

91
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,600
So it's really unclear what I could've
done differently.

92
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,270
But I,
for example,

93
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:47,010
I didn't know so much about the
underground conservative network before

94
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:49,420
all of this.
And Google you mean?

95
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,330
Yeah.
And even within silicon valley,

96
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,720
there was attempts to sort of connect
them between companies,

97
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:59,460
but there's so much verification that
you need to go through to be able to

98
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,560
join one of these.
You have to have a pseudonym.

99
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,530
Uh,
I mean you don't need to be totally

100
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:06,070
anonymous,
but you know,

101
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,940
you,
you don't want because there's active

102
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,740
attempts to try to infiltrate these
groups.

103
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,130
Really?
Yeah.

104
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,660
I,
this happens a lot where they'll try to

105
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:19,020
join a group,
act as if they're one of them and then

106
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:22,170
just record what's happening and then
expose them

107
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,520
and you know,
you can take anything out of context and

108
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,550
it will be shown as you know,
racism or something.

109
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:30,450
Sure.
What means.

110
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,770
Think of what we said,
well,

111
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:34,890
not you but me joking around in this
conversation.

112
00:05:34,891 --> 00:05:38,470
You could clearly take something I've
said out of context and make them a

113
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,550
monster,
but if you're in an email and you're

114
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:44,280
complaining about some sort of diversity
program

115
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,250
yet,
what they often do is they will find

116
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:54,690
someone that they disagree with and then
they'll scour through their entire

117
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:57,030
history at Google and all the emails
that they've.

118
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,860
And try to look for some way to
blacklist them or show that this person

119
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:05,000
is evil,
therefore they should be fired.

120
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,960
It's horrible.
And supposedly this is happening in

121
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,360
other companies too.
And they even have like these automated

122
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:16,361
scripts to try to find these negative
things on people that they don't like.

123
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,090
You remember the verizon ringback tone?
Yeah.

124
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,270
Used to be called people up sometimes.
You still call people up and we play a

125
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:24,104
song.
Yeah,

126
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,850
I guess they still have it right?
You still have king of Rock,

127
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,910
you call other king.
Oh

128
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,740
my favorite is when you had to get move.
You had to get a good buddy.

129
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,080
Run DMC you had for a year.
I am beautiful.

130
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,240
Christina Aguilera.

131
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,130
We would just being like a normal
conversation with like adults and it's

132
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:00,260
that thing which is
I've always loved that song.

133
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,960
Good tickets.
I like some.

134
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,340
Sometimes I'd like things and I don't
like that.

135
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:08,840
I feel pressured,
not like them,

136
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,071
you know?
I'm like,

137
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:11,660
why?
How come I can't like that song?

138
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,360
It's a beautiful song.
It's,

139
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,710
is it does it too girly so that what it
is that.

140
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,450
What's going on?
A lot of prejudice.

141
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,350
That's how I feel with Taylor swift.
I was blaring her new song the other day

142
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,150
and I was at a red light and I was like,
God damn,

143
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,550
I got to roll up my windows.
You go boy.

144
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,020
Saying that Shit.
Who gives a fuck?

145
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,810
It's weird.
You got to be scared to sing things out.

146
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,530
I was playing that one sia song in here
after you left one day and you came back

147
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:36,750
in like when you get
tight,

148
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,680
tight,
tight.

149
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,470
Hashtag black twitter.
It's the hot shit.

150
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,100
Yeah man.
There's like a lot of shit that I

151
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:46,934
probably shouldn't.
Like.

152
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,140
What's your biggest latest guiltiest
pleasure?

153
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,060
Um,
I like Taylor swift.

154
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,260
Yeah,
I like her music.

155
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:57,350
I like.
I like so your team tailor like Justin

156
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,310
Bieber.
I like his voice.

157
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,160
It's got a beautiful voice.
A couple of his songs are right.

158
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,250
Kid could see his fucking ass off.
I heard some people are into that kind

159
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:07,780
of music.

160
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,860
They're upset right now because Justin
timberlake is rumored or he's going to

161
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:13,200
be doing vocals on the new foo fighters
album,

162
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,980
but he's just doing some background.
You won't even know it's him,

163
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:19,350
but his name made it out in a blog post
or something.

164
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,540
This guy is not going to do.
This is timberlake.

165
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,360
He's a smart guy.
He's not going to do anything stupid.

166
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,790
If he does do that,
he's going to smash it.

167
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,340
He wouldn't do it if he didn't think
he'd get smashed at worse.

168
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,750
Yeah,
we'll just smash it.

169
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,370
Yeah,
he's great.

170
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,590
I don't want white people shit on him.
He's like one of the best,

171
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,990
most talented to Hanson.
Too Tall,

172
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,550
too.
Pretty to rich.

173
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,220
He danced around too.
Good at dancing.

174
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:46,700
I don't like it.
Do not like it.

175
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,340
Yeah,
guys don't like some handsome fellow

176
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:51,320
dances.
Real good and sings his ass off.

177
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,080
Fuck that.
So people are hating.

178
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,440
He just gets all the poison dances.
Fucking dancer can't like dancing too

179
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:06,150
much if you're a dude,
but it's that same thing.

180
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:08,070
The same reason why you're not supposed
to like that.

181
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:10,830
I am beautiful song.
It's Goddamn beautiful song,

182
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,880
but you know,
people refer you to be like,

183
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,370
you know,
enter Sandman,

184
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,590
which is great to get this balance in
this life.

185
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,530
Right?
You want a little ozzy osborne every now

186
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,910
and then.
You want a little shell crow?

187
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,450
I liked a little sheryl crow.
I'm hauling notes all day.

188
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,900
I can't get enough of hall and oates.
I can't go for that.

189
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,933
Got You.

190
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,870
I can't go for that.
No,

191
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,320
no.
