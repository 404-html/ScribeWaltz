1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,010
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is one of the podcasts that we

2
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:05,581
recorded.

3
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:07,740
Why we recording the Scifi show,

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:08,790
Joe Rogan questions,

5
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:09,240
everything.

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,000
A lot of people have listened
to those shows and they've said,

7
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:12,451
hey man,

8
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:13,111
I love your show,

9
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:15,540
but the fucking fig
podcasts are killing me.

10
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,880
They actually weren't fake.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The way we did the show was
we did everything that we
do during a normal podcast

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,920
and [inaudible] and then we just
talked about the subject at hand.

13
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:35,391
And of course a lot of times the
subjects went on crazy tangents like,

14
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,800
like any other podcasts that we do.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,491
Uh,

16
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:42,360
but they were all recorded
just like a regular podcast.

17
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:46,410
And then we had the Scifi people or um,

18
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:46,741
the,

19
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:46,890
uh,

20
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,030
people at Arthur Smith,

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,920
the production company that made the show,

22
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:50,640
um,

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,250
edit down portions of it and insert those.

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,740
So there were some
things that we said that,

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,430
you know,

26
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,480
sort of busy work,

27
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,280
like w things that we had to say,

28
00:00:59,281 --> 00:00:59,491
like,

29
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:00,270
Dunkin,

30
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,520
I'm going to send you to go check,

31
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:02,790
you know,

32
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,623
that kind of stuff.

33
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,300
There was just stuff that
we had to do for the show.

34
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:07,200
But other than that,

35
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:12,201
the majority of it was just regular
podcast talk and I promise you guys that I

36
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,030
would release it and uh,

37
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,610
thanks to the generosity of Scifi,

38
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,020
they have allowed us to do so.

39
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:21,780
So we're going to put all
these podcasts out there.

40
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,351
How many of them are there,

41
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:23,184
Jamie?

42
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,001
10 or 11.

43
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,080
So there's like 10 or 11.

44
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,610
They range between,

45
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:26,910
uh,

46
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,920
two hours plus for this first one to
short ones are probably like an hour

47
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,390
something,

48
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,223
something along those lines.

49
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,293
But uh,

50
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,720
this is the first one and this
one is brought to you by ting.

51
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,990
So if you go to rogan.ting.com you
can find out what Ting is all about.

52
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:47,691
Ting is an excellent cell phone service
company that uses the sprint backbone.

53
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,420
And Sprint of course is one of the biggest
cell phone providers in the world and

54
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:54,330
in the country.

55
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,590
So you don't have to worry about getting
a crappy cell phone signal along with

56
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,693
saving money.

57
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,850
But with Tim does is they have it set up
so that you only pay for what you use.

58
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,410
If you have,

59
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:08,430
like if you go to the,

60
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:13,431
if you go to rogan.ting.com there's a
sign that says 98% of people would save

61
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:15,120
money with Ting.

62
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,360
That's because we do mobile
differently and they really do.

63
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:21,120
It's not bullshit if you don't use,

64
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:21,691
if you like,

65
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:26,370
say if you have one plan and
then you use less than that plan,

66
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,610
they will credit you the
difference on your next bill.

67
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:30,690
Who the fuck does that?

68
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,770
Nobody,

69
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,640
nobody does that.

70
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,503
Tim does that.

71
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,720
$21 is the average monthly bill per
device per device for 10 customers.

72
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,760
That's fucking nuts.

73
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,090
$440 is the average annual savings per
device for a business with 11 to 20

74
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:50,010
employees.

75
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,870
I mean Ting is bad ass and
they have great phones.

76
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,880
They have the HTC one,

77
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,313
which is uh,

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,510
a one my friend at Google gave
me that I've been playing with.

79
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:02,201
I love it.

80
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,310
It's a great phone.

81
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,570
It's really cool.

82
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,051
The,

83
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:05,201
uh,

84
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:09,880
the devices they have are all
top of the line and droid phones.

85
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:10,630
They have,

86
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,050
you know,

87
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,050
these all these beautiful android devices
like the Samsung Galaxy s four s three

88
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,330
fucking HTC one.

89
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:24,730
They have the HTC one black.

90
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,600
If you're looking sexy and you need
your phone to be black and mysterious,

91
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,040
or the ht one red,

92
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,150
if you're flamboyant,

93
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,560
you're just a wild child.

94
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:33,520
You can't be held back.

95
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,370
They have the Motorola Moto X,

96
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:38,380
which is a bad ass device.

97
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,130
Um,

98
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:39,461
I've,

99
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:39,761
uh,

100
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,080
I've been really interested in that phone.

101
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:41,440
That's,

102
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,010
there's all these new phones that they're
coming out with these android phones

103
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,100
and they're coming out with
them in a much more rapid pace.

104
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:48,780
Then,

105
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,300
um,

106
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,280
a lot of the other providers like apple,

107
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:52,870
you know,

108
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,180
apple with their five s you silly pitches.

109
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,470
Can you give me a big screen?

110
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:57,130
You're fucks.

111
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:57,550
Come on.

112
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,210
Seriously.

113
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,043
Gimme a big scream.

114
00:03:59,380 --> 00:03:59,770
Um,

115
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,500
I know ting was going to have,

116
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:03,880
they had the iPhone for a while.

117
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:04,714
They have it anymore.

118
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:05,770
Hmm.

119
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,280
Smartphones,

120
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,480
let's say two,

121
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:07,671
two,

122
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:07,851
two,

123
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:08,051
two,

124
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:08,790
two.

125
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,240
They have the HTC,

126
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,840
uh,

127
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,920
eight x t,

128
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,330
which is a windows phone.

129
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,230
Um,

130
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,000
I have not fucked with windows phones,

131
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:17,410
but I have a friend who loves them.

132
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,300
I don't trust him.

133
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,160
I think he might be one of those dudes,

134
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,810
some of those people,

135
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,790
and not saying there's anything
wrong with windows phones.

136
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:25,930
I'm sure there are bad ass,

137
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,690
but there are people that
I think you know them,

138
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:29,524
we all know them,

139
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,470
that when they have something
they want other people to get it.

140
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,070
Like I had a friend and he
had this old piece of shit,

141
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:37,080
weird fucking stuff.

142
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,110
This is a long time ago.

143
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,011
It was like,

144
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:39,844
um,

145
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,000
I think it was a Sony
cell phone and it had a,

146
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,383
it had like a,

147
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,593
like,

148
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,310
like a little pencil that came with it,

149
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,420
a stylist and he would write on it and
they would recognize his handwriting and

150
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:53,950
it's a fucked,

151
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,280
I mean they're barely
recognized it and it was,

152
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,230
it had all these like really wonky,

153
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:00,100
shitty apps.

154
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:00,940
It would crash on you,

155
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:04,630
but he was just ranting and
raving about how great it was.

156
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,750
Then I saw the motherfucker three
months later with an iPhone.

157
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,201
I was like,

158
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:08,800
bitch,

159
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,330
what are you trying to do?

160
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,270
You fucking tried to sell me on
the same shit that you're on.

161
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,040
It's like people that are on sprint,

162
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,570
they want you to be on sprint.

163
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,240
People are on at and t like you needed,

164
00:05:18,241 --> 00:05:19,074
you didn't need,

165
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,120
but people who are on ting or on tin
because they're saving money son,

166
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,880
they're saving themselves some shackles
and they're trying to set up a cell

167
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,130
phone company that does it ethically,

168
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,560
that gives you great service,

169
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,180
doesn't give you any contracts.

170
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:40,390
You can cancel anytime
you want and as I said,

171
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,480
if you don't use all of your minutes,

172
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,920
they will knock you down to the
lower rate and they will credit you.

173
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,670
Ting is a mobile service that makes sense.

174
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,550
It's a no bullshit mobile service company.

175
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,950
They use sprint credit,

176
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,980
new services,

177
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,210
no add on charges,

178
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,240
no mysterious line items for your bill.

179
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:03,230
You ever get a bill and you're like,

180
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:05,480
what is this fucking service fee,

181
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,323
Kim?

182
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,830
All that creepy shit the big companies
do to try to extract money from you.

183
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,850
Tank's not about that son.

184
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:19,510
Go to rogan.ting.com and save
$25 off of any device or service.

185
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,853
So go there,

186
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,980
check it out and I guarantee
you you will enjoy it.

187
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,180
It is an excellent company.

188
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,050
We uh,

189
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,830
we give them a full recommendation.

190
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,940
Brian has been using Tang for for quite
a while and one of the things he notices

191
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:36,020
when he went out of town,

192
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,350
he went to Canada.

193
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,840
You use tango internationally.

194
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:43,841
He saved a shit load of money compared
to our friends who used a other less

195
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,090
scrupulous services.

196
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,983
So go there,

197
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,760
check out all the bad ass cell phones.

198
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,241
Like I said,

199
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:51,740
I'd like the galaxy s four.

200
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,280
You can get the s four purple if you're
a big prince fan or you can get the

201
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,260
galaxy note to titanium.

202
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,540
Chased us to tow crazy.

203
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,950
These phones go there.

204
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,980
rogan.ting.com and now I'm with a
big thank you to the syfy network.

205
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:06,861
Uh,

206
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:10,670
I really enjoyed working with them and I
really appreciate the fact that they're

207
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,650
allowing us to release these podcasts.

208
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,030
They were very cool.

209
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:14,660
It was very cool.

210
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,130
They want to put the show on and a
to we slammed it together so quickly.

211
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,240
Uh,

212
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,041
short notice though.

213
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:21,381
So,

214
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:21,620
uh,

215
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,730
thank you to them and a thank you to
everybody over at Arthur Smith as well.

216
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:27,650
Thanks to frank and Michael and,

217
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,920
and Todd and all the cool
folks that we worked with.

218
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,641
So,

219
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:32,090
uh,

220
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:32,690
with that,

221
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,160
with without any further ado,

222
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,880
this is a one of many of the Psi Phi
podcasts for the Joe Rogan experience.

223
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,520
They kiss you on the Joe Rogan

224
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,590
experience.

225
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,780
Joe Rogan podcast,

226
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:48,090
my night all day.

227
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,810
So the Joe Rogan experience podcast,

228
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,673
it's not real.

229
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,910
We're pretending that it's real.

230
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,570
Only 10 carefully,

231
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,710
properly.

232
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,011
Joe,

233
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:03,970
you should go to Canada.

234
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:05,010
I heard there's a hum there.

235
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,050
Get the fuck out

236
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,610
and cut.

237
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,633
That was perfect.

238
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,093
Okay.

239
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:19,090
So there's a lot of people that believe
that the government not only is capable

240
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:20,750
of manipulating the weather,

241
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,290
but does manipulate the weather and we
know that they've done certain things

242
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:28,190
like we know that people can make it
rain and not just at a strip club,

243
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,550
but people can make it rain by spraying
certain chemicals into the clouds or

244
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,430
seeding clouds,

245
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,264
child seating.

246
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,690
They have actually done that
in the United Arab Emirates.

247
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,450
They've made it rain 50 times last year,

248
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,520
so they do it basically once a week.

249
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,281
But this is I,

250
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:44,700
this is,

251
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,600
I've heard it's dangerous.

252
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:48,960
Like the chemicals that come
with a rain are poisonous.

253
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,360
Oh,

254
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,500
right,

255
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,010
true.

256
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:50,370
I don't know.

257
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:50,500
Well,

258
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:50,971
it's weird.

259
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:53,780
Chemicals sprayed out of an Arabs jet,

260
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,630
not,

261
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,830
I don't think weird.

262
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:56,010
Let's

263
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,990
say cloud cities that you never in human
history has anyone flown over a desert

264
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:02,580
and sprayed chemicals into a cloud?

265
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:03,350
It's

266
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,621
okay.

267
00:09:03,621 --> 00:09:04,130
Let's find out.

268
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,020
Is Cloud seeding harmful?

269
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,370
That's what a lot of people want to know.

270
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:08,204
Duncan Trussell.

271
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,630
And when studying the efficacy and
consequences of cloud seeding experience,

272
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,710
the experimenters tend to be biased
towards saying cloud seeding with silver

273
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:19,190
iodide enhances precipitation
without negative consequences.

274
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,270
However,

275
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,640
much of the literature substantiates that,

276
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:26,120
not only does cloud seeding fail
to achieve the desired effect,

277
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,700
it also yields harmful consequence.

278
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,440
Also look up that guy eight silver iodide.

279
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:32,630
If you ever got a turn purple.

280
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:32,811
Yeah,

281
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:33,900
that blueberry man.

282
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,560
Yeah.

283
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,393
What happened there?

284
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,080
You eat silver.

285
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,030
These people eat silver out of some.

286
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,530
They think it increases their longevity
or their virility and it makes them turn

287
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:45,330
smurf blue forever.

288
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,383
Hmm.

289
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,690
So this is one take on it and
there's other takes on it.

290
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,220
That's the problem with the Internet,

291
00:09:51,221 --> 00:09:51,760
right?

292
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,410
Is that if you really wanted to,

293
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:56,200
you could find a bunch of people that
agree with you and just hanging those

294
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:57,034
circles.

295
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,920
It's the beauty of the Internet and
it's the problem with the Internet.

296
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,050
The fact that there's so
much information out there,

297
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:02,980
but if you choose to,

298
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:06,190
you can filter it down and get it to a
point where you're not really listening

299
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:08,050
to anybody other than people
that support your point of

300
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,400
I don't need the Internet
to help me figure out if I
want to stand under a cloud

301
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:13,750
pouring silver iodide,

302
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:16,300
crystallized rain and into my yard.

303
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,130
Like if someone gave you a choice,

304
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,630
do you want to stand in a rain shower
of PuroClean Hawaiian water or would you

305
00:10:22,631 --> 00:10:26,440
like to stand in a silver iodide rain,

306
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:27,251
shower and joy,

307
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:31,690
those relaxing silver particles
spilling into your skin?

308
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:32,171
Well,

309
00:10:32,171 --> 00:10:33,850
here's the other side of it.

310
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,620
They can also prevent it from raining.

311
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:36,580
Um,

312
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,090
the,

313
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,150
we know China did that
during the Olympics and uh,

314
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,190
other than preventing
rain for the Olympics,

315
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:45,700
it says here in this article
on space-explores.com,

316
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,020
whatever it says here in this article
that other than preventing rain for the

317
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:50,411
Olympics,

318
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:54,430
China is spending 60 to that other
than preventing rain for the Olympics,

319
00:10:54,431 --> 00:10:59,431
China is spending 60 to $90 million a
year on cloud seeding to provide enough

320
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:03,790
water for its enormous population to
clear away smog from heavily polluted

321
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:04,430
areas.

322
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,790
So that's their way of dealing with smart.

323
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,091
Hey,

324
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:09,910
do you think we should like put mufflers
on our cars now let's just make it

325
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:10,370
rain.

326
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,380
Just wash it.

327
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:11,981
Oh yeah.

328
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:13,620
Just push it down into the corner.

329
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,000
Dyed water.

330
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,750
Good.

331
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,950
It's really good for pollution.

332
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,540
China is going to give China is
going to birth the Godzilla there.

333
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,810
Fucking around with that.

334
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,780
We can't say that it would beep it out.

335
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,131
No,

336
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:24,741
I yeah,

337
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:25,850
I yourself God damn it.

338
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,800
I think that's a powerful weapon though,

339
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:28,041
man.

340
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:28,551
It really is.

341
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:32,360
If you want it to attack a country
and you could make rain stop.

342
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:32,990
Yeah.

343
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,420
Then you would have full
power over that country.

344
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:37,010
If you could control their weather,

345
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,330
you've definitely would win.

346
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,340
And then the question is,

347
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:40,360
if you could do that,

348
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:41,440
how do you know you can do that?

349
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:41,561
Well,

350
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:42,400
you'd have to try it.

351
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,570
And how did you try it?

352
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,690
Did you try it just during the Olympics
or did you know about it beforehand?

353
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:48,130
Have you been using it on countries?

354
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,900
Have you been aiming it in places?

355
00:11:49,901 --> 00:11:50,621
Like how do you do it?

356
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:51,220
You have to,

357
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,970
is it very specific or you know,

358
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,823
can it be,

359
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,160
can

360
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,650
you misfire and it is,

361
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,930
people can get cotton drive by accidental
cloud seatings where it would rain in

362
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:02,200
a place where you didn't want it to rain.

363
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,063
That doesn't even make sense.

364
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,470
Dry by accidental cloud seeding.

365
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,450
It ricocheted stray clouds.

366
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,700
You get Ma'am got hit by a stray cloud.

367
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,130
That would be a great dramatic get hit by,

368
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,650
he made it rain on my family.

369
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,610
I'm not even a crip

370
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,970
now besides the chem trail issue,

371
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,301
which,

372
00:12:18,301 --> 00:12:18,570
uh,

373
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:18,990
we've,

374
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,070
I've met with a bunch of people so far
on this camp trail issue and there's

375
00:12:23,071 --> 00:12:24,600
certainly some,

376
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,780
there's certainly some possibilities
that the government at one point in time

377
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:30,480
has sprayed something
from a plane for sure.

378
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:30,780
Sure.

379
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,250
But the idea of this constant
spraying and this in the skies,

380
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:35,950
the idea,

381
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:40,590
this constant spraying and this guys
seems to be much more ignorance than

382
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:41,220
anything else.

383
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:41,671
I agree.

384
00:12:41,671 --> 00:12:42,090
Yeah.

385
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,050
And not just ignorance,

386
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:44,880
but like on purpose,

387
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,920
like being willfully ignorant,

388
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,850
like not looking at any of the things
that refute the things you're saying.

389
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,220
It's scientifically people with no agenda.

390
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,490
Instead looking only at
the things that support it.

391
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:56,670
Well,

392
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:56,970
you know,

393
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:57,721
confirmation bias,

394
00:12:57,721 --> 00:12:59,550
it's like pure and simple.

395
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,800
And there's people that
make entire documentaries.

396
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,510
This guy that I met with,

397
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:03,991
this guy,

398
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:04,740
um,

399
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,573
Michael Murphy,

400
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,200
he's got these two documentaries.

401
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:10,620
What in the world are they spraying
and why in the world are they spraying?

402
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,750
And he refuses to look at anything
that points to the fact that what he's

403
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,880
measuring when he's
measuring like aluminum,

404
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,631
he's saying Lloyd's,

405
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:18,841
look,

406
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,310
we found aluminum and this water,

407
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,370
what he's measuring his dirt
and dirt is rich in aluminum.

408
00:13:23,371 --> 00:13:23,820
I mean it's,

409
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,530
it's a real simple stuff,

410
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:25,861
right?

411
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:30,060
So that in saying that this is a part
of some nefarious plan and some secret

412
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:32,820
thing that he's uncovered
is being ridiculous person.

413
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,341
Also,

414
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:38,341
I like to think about the specifics
of the person flying the plane that's

415
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:41,580
apparently dropping the poison onto there.

416
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:43,660
It's like who are these mysterious pilots?

417
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,730
Did they have breakfast with their family?

418
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,480
Do they sit down and chat about how,

419
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:47,861
yeah,

420
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:50,800
going to spray aluminum
dichloride over New York,

421
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:51,634
honey.

422
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,610
And the other thing is
it's so nonspecific.

423
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:59,350
I mean everyone down there is the
enemy or everyone down there has to be

424
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:01,330
experimented with including billionaires,

425
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:02,200
bankers,

426
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,190
politicians,

427
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,900
they're all getting sprayed on everybody.

428
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:05,590
Really.

429
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,390
What kind of asshole would do that?

430
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,740
That's the real question.

431
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,603
And not only that,

432
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,610
what a shit result like
it barely does anything.

433
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,890
I mean stop and think
about all this spring.

434
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,850
Imagine if you had something where you
can spray this guy completely cover the

435
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:20,410
sky in this spray,

436
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,810
this chemical spray and what does
it do to the people down there?

437
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,100
It makes prince freak out.

438
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,700
It makes prince freak out almost worth.

439
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,280
We got to pull that up.

440
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,620
Pull up prince talks about chem trails.

441
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,790
This is a very important,

442
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:31,690
actually put,

443
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:32,950
it's a youtube video.

444
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,570
Prince talks to Dick Gregory
about chem trails areas.

445
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,700
It's hilariously awesome and it,

446
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:39,000
it,

447
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,340
it,

448
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,970
it highlights a lot of people's
ignorance about this issue.

449
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,960
Like they haven't even looked
into what creates these clouds.

450
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,320
And this was a paper that
was published by the,

451
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:50,591
uh,

452
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:52,940
the United military in the 1940s,

453
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,980
and they didn't call them
con trails back then.

454
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,730
They called them persistent condensation
trails and they were trying to

455
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,000
determine that these clouds they
were making with propellers.

456
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:02,760
By the way,

457
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,531
if these clouds,

458
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:07,880
whether or not they were dangerous
and the same conditions were always

459
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:08,600
discussed,

460
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,160
it's always like super hazy.

461
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,160
And it's at a point just
before clouds are created,

462
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,910
like a point in the,

463
00:15:14,911 --> 00:15:18,140
the condensation of the atmosphere
where it's almost cloudy.

464
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,250
It's just kind of hazy.

465
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,930
And when they cut through with a plane,

466
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,760
it creates artificial clouds.

467
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,310
And when people saying
they're spraying clouds,

468
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:25,490
no,

469
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:30,200
they're actually making clouds by
driving through it with a plane.

470
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,741
I mean,

471
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:31,880
it's really simple stuff.

472
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,330
Yeah.

473
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,070
I,

474
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,380
I've never really bought into that stuff,

475
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:40,381
but I have had somebody explained to me
how they're putting poison into the air.

476
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:46,140
Someone explained that to me while smoking
a cigarette while taking big puffs on

477
00:15:46,661 --> 00:15:46,751
a,

478
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:49,450
say they're poisoning as a
deadly chemicals in the air,

479
00:15:49,451 --> 00:15:49,751
man.

480
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:51,580
They just want to control the population.

481
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,763
Yeah.

482
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:55,120
I've seen people talk about
saving the environment,

483
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,070
whether it drove a Prius and
throw a cigarette out the window.

484
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,420
It's ridiculous.

485
00:15:58,421 --> 00:15:58,961
But you know,

486
00:15:58,961 --> 00:15:59,794
I don't,

487
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,730
I don't,

488
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,241
honestly,

489
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:04,060
I don't understand what makes
those things up in the air.

490
00:16:04,061 --> 00:16:08,650
I think they're pretty like
criss crossing pattern clouds.

491
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,510
They're nice to look at it on a picnic,

492
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,980
but I don't think they're poison.

493
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,860
And why is it that they keep
appearing near airports?

494
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,761
That's crazy.

495
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:17,530
Why would they spray near the airport?

496
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,720
Because that way they could do
it rather than under our noses.

497
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,051
Man.

498
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:22,780
The biggest lie is the lie that
you don't even have to tell.

499
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,510
Everybody tells us for you ps,

500
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:29,830
the government could probably release
free packs of cigarettes that say on them,

501
00:16:29,831 --> 00:16:33,970
these make you depressed and people
would just bought willingly buy them.

502
00:16:33,971 --> 00:16:36,280
You don't have to secretly
dump chemicals on Americans.

503
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:38,230
We're gulping them down every day.

504
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:43,290
We love chemicals sit in front of a seven
11 and watch those pigs come flapping

505
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,130
out of there with their big gulps
and their pasty glistening sugar,

506
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,950
sugar lips and fried hot dogs.

507
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:51,310
No,

508
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,540
you don't have to poison a merit.

509
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,950
The idea that you have to actively and
secretly poisoned Americans is insane.

510
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,760
It's ridiculous.

511
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,130
So I think we both agree on that.

512
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,330
They obviously know how to manipulate
weather and they obviously have

513
00:17:04,331 --> 00:17:08,170
manipulated whether before and
by they meaning everyone but us.

514
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,010
Okay.

515
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,590
I don't think you'd done any manipulation
and so we'll just include the whole

516
00:17:11,591 --> 00:17:12,424
rest of the population.

517
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,060
Someone out there has figured out how
to make it stop raining and they've also

518
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:17,170
figured out how to make it rain.

519
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,740
Yes.

520
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,910
The question is how often does it does
go on and is this a part of our everyday

521
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:25,810
life that we have to concern ourselves
with and does it spray down harmful

522
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:26,400
chemicals?

523
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,941
Is the other,

524
00:17:26,941 --> 00:17:30,090
those clouds of the reason why
people are finding aluminum,

525
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,490
the soil,

526
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,640
well it turns out no aluminum is one
of the most common elements on earth.

527
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,480
And it's,

528
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,290
you can find commensurate levels that
they've been finding in these tests that

529
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,030
they've done that prove
chem trails a real,

530
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,460
you find those everywhere
all over the country.

531
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,503
The reason being,

532
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,220
because fucking aluminum is everywhere.

533
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:45,560
Yes.

534
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,450
Aluminum's everywhere.

535
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,090
So that's something we know
we don't have to worry about.

536
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,160
So we've got that put

537
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,993
us put aside.

538
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:56,060
So a plane's create clouds automatically
proven be aluminum exists in the

539
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:58,290
atmosphere all the time.

540
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,124
Proves right.

541
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,280
Doesn't mean that they haven't
sprayed things from the sky.

542
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,830
It doesn't mean that they're not
capable of altering the weather.

543
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:05,664
We know they are.

544
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:05,990
Right?

545
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,770
Sure.

546
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:11,480
But then also isn't there always toxins
coming off of airplanes no matter why

547
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,280
jet fuel that's on fire.

548
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,020
Yeah,

549
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,900
and it's sprays.

550
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:15,261
And by the way,

551
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:19,280
that's the one of the biggest
factors in global warming is jets,

552
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:19,760
right?

553
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,760
Giant tubes filled with flammable dead
dinosaurs that you're flying over the sky

554
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,770
once that spraying,

555
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,210
that's the real spraying.

556
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,480
The real spraying is burning
jet fuel above your face.

557
00:18:32,481 --> 00:18:32,960
Stupid.

558
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,740
Exactly.

559
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,760
That's the poison.

560
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,940
They really are spraying us every
time you fly to The Bahamas,

561
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:38,774
you're chipping in.

562
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,381
That's what I heard.

563
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:42,860
I heard every time you fly
your fat kids to Disneyland,

564
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,920
you're incinerating like
19 acres of rain forest.

565
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,870
How do they get to that much?

566
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:51,770
But I feel I exactly eating a lot
of different ways when I said that.

567
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,900
Now the other aspect

568
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,420
of manipulating,

569
00:18:55,421 --> 00:19:00,421
whether that's fascinating is harp and
I think Harb stands for high altitude

570
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:03,790
active auroral research.

571
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,410
Let's find that one.

572
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,020
I don't know.

573
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,321
H.

574
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:05,771
A r.

575
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:08,410
P just so we know it stands for,

576
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,651
oh,

577
00:19:08,651 --> 00:19:09,700
I spelled it totally wrong.

578
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,960
I spelled it h.

579
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:11,950
H a r,

580
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,010
which is the Hebrew home
for the aged in Riverdale.

581
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:15,880
Okay.

582
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,780
Not the same thing.

583
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,140
Don't go there and yell at those
people for controlling the weather.

584
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,490
Jewish elderly people
are making it rain and

585
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,210
they don't even know what you're
talking about and they will hit you.

586
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:26,990
Okay.

587
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,960
High frequency active
auroral research program.

588
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:32,780
Yeah,

589
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,780
and this is a fascinating thing because
what this is the official use of harp is

590
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,520
that they,

591
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,170
they send these radio waves up into the
ionosphere and they can manipulate it,

592
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:46,520
and by manipulating it,

593
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,350
it can aid in communication.

594
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:53,120
They could shut down communication and
they could possibly make it so that they

595
00:19:53,121 --> 00:19:56,330
can send radio signals and receive
radio signals from very far away.

596
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,470
What's the ionosphere?

597
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,970
The ionosphere?

598
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,863
That's a good question.

599
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,850
We should get the official

600
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,430
explanation without me
going into my pseudoscience.

601
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:07,791
Okay.

602
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:08,390
Here we go.

603
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:12,470
It's the layer of the earth's atmosphere
that contains a high concentration of

604
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:17,530
ions and free electrons and
is able to reflect radio.

605
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,130
So that's the ionosphere.

606
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,260
So it makes sense that
they would have these,

607
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,190
this gigantic radio array antenna ray,

608
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,400
and that they're sending these charged
particles up into the ionosphere and that

609
00:20:30,561 --> 00:20:35,480
what they're trying to do is manipulate
it so that they can use their radios

610
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:36,350
more effectively.

611
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,903
However,

612
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,970
the conspiracy theory and the conspiracy
harp has been blamed for a variety of

613
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:44,570
different events,

614
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,260
um,

615
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,420
including numerous natural disasters,

616
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,010
tsunamis.

617
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,960
Some people think they can cause
earthquake and some people attribute it to

618
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,730
something called sky quakes.

619
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,170
Have you ever heard of sky quake?

620
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,790
Now listen to this.

621
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,091
Okay,

622
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,050
we're gonna play this for you.

623
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,230
This is an audio of a sky quake.

624
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,243
And let's play.

625
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,230
Let's play the one from Allen,

626
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,064
Texas.

627
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,630
There's a bunch of people that are
standing outside and they hear this,

628
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:21,190
and the freaky thing they say is that
when they hear these things that you can't

629
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:22,510
pinpoint where they're coming from.

630
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,790
They're just coming from the sky.

631
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,050
And in order to have something that's
that loud that doesn't dissipate with

632
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:29,884
distance,

633
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,760
you're dealing with some
incredible amount of energy.

634
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,870
And the big F is as if this isn't a hoax,

635
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,123
right?

636
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,480
You could get some Dick heads in college
and think it's cute to just stand

637
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:43,901
around and go,

638
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:44,734
what's that sound?

639
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,700
What is that?

640
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,240
And then they go on their computer
and add in some sound effects.

641
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:49,361
Yeah,

642
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:52,990
just slow down a trumpet and
put it your picnic video.

643
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:55,960
And suddenly you've got 15
billion hits on Youtube.

644
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,110
Yeah,

645
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,891
exactly.

646
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:58,150
And again,

647
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,200
it's one of those things,

648
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:02,170
it's like what exactly
are we listening to this?

649
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:02,940
It sounds cool.

650
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,080
Oh,

651
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,840
I didn't know this is called sky quakes,

652
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:05,920
but I have heard of this.

653
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,950
And what I really like is the Judeo
Christian explanation for what this is.

654
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,730
Because in the book of revelations,

655
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,020
they talk about how the horsemen of
the apocalypse blow these trumpets.

656
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:18,780
And that's how you know
it's the end of days.

657
00:22:18,781 --> 00:22:23,770
So this is really feeding into the
apocalyptic Christian theory that we're at

658
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:24,700
the end of the world.

659
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,020
And these are the sounds that you hear
before the great plagues come rolling

660
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:29,770
through the land.

661
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,150
That's what a lot of
Christians think that.

662
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:32,740
Did you ever see Kevin Smith's movie?

663
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:33,574
Red State?

664
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:33,941
Ah,

665
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:34,181
yes,

666
00:22:34,181 --> 00:22:34,610
I did.

667
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,381
Amazing movie.

668
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:38,600
And remember the end when they played
the trumpet and that's what got the crazy

669
00:22:38,601 --> 00:22:40,060
evangelism and make it to the end.

670
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,921
I was drunk,

671
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:42,754
I fell asleep.

672
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,230
It's worth a second look.

673
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,220
Um,

674
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:53,220
now we also have some recordings of what
harp actually sounds like in operation.

675
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:54,580
And this is equally freaky.

676
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,860
It's not a good sound that
you never want to hear that.

677
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,800
You never want to be out on your porch
with your dog throwing a stick and you're

678
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:10,634
like,

679
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,091
what is what?

680
00:23:14,091 --> 00:23:14,751
So what is hard?

681
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:15,351
What do they have?

682
00:23:15,351 --> 00:23:17,480
Like demons yelling in a microphones.

683
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,930
I think it's the garbage
disposal of the universe.

684
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,800
That's what it sounds like.

685
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:23,780
It sounds like a garbage
disposal and space.

686
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,160
No,

687
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,140
this sounds like interstellar locust

688
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,070
descending on the,

689
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,500
when you really stop and think about
the fact that there's something on earth

690
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:34,590
that shoots energy up into
the sky and makes that noise.

691
00:23:34,591 --> 00:23:35,040
Yeah.

692
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,030
And then above us,

693
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,640
what?

694
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,890
What is it shooting into the ionosphere
where there's like thousands of

695
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:44,040
satellites and space
junk flying in it just,

696
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,230
no thanks.

697
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,950
No thanks to creeps were a creepy species.

698
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,420
Can you imagine if if chimpanzees were
blasting the honest fear with devil

699
00:23:57,421 --> 00:23:58,150
screeches,

700
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:58,983
we kill them,

701
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,410
wipe them out with him.

702
00:24:00,411 --> 00:24:01,960
Two days there'd be no more chimps.

703
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,400
We found chimp with a bow and Arrow
would shoot it right in the head.

704
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,090
You'd have to,

705
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:05,923
you'd have to.

706
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:06,620
Yeah.

707
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,453
So this,

708
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,020
what's interesting about this is it
like Robin Hood and make a ton of money.

709
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,780
We had this guy on the
show that I interviewed,

710
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:15,770
his name is woody Norris.

711
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:17,150
He's this genius inventor,

712
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:19,220
a true bonafide genius.

713
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,740
He's responsible for over 80 patents.

714
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:27,010
He is a an audio expert and he listened
to the sounds and review the amount of

715
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:31,310
power this thing puts out
and he believes that this,

716
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,450
this array of antennas absolutely
could be responsible for those sounds.

717
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,010
And he thinks that it could be responsible
for manipulating whether it can,

718
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:45,030
that you could have a lot of what you
would call off label uses and that maybe

719
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,770
it was an issue initially created to
heat up the ionosphere so that they could

720
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:49,700
send radio signals.

721
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,440
But along the way they
might've figured out,

722
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:51,921
Holy Shit,

723
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:54,980
we can make trumpets blow
in the sky over Iran.

724
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:55,600
You know?

725
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:55,881
I mean,

726
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:58,340
do you know how freaky
it would be is like,

727
00:24:58,550 --> 00:24:58,761
you know,

728
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:00,350
you get an email from the president,

729
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:00,771
good luck,

730
00:25:00,771 --> 00:25:01,251
fuck face,

731
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:01,941
we're going to war.

732
00:25:01,941 --> 00:25:03,400
And then he had a raw,

733
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,040
you'd know it's common and
you hear trumpets in the sky.

734
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,330
Just that alone is like,

735
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:08,631
listen,

736
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:08,871
listen,

737
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:09,770
we've been thinking,

738
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,570
we've been very hasty.

739
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,790
The nuclear who needs nuclear power?

740
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:14,160
My friend,

741
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,260
he stopped the trumpet.

742
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:16,850
Japan has problems with it.

743
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:18,200
So we don't want that in this world.

744
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,221
No.

745
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:19,701
You know what,

746
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:19,970
man,

747
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:23,870
I think that for whatever reason,

748
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:28,100
it's part of the government's job to
every day come up with new ways to kill

749
00:25:28,101 --> 00:25:28,910
people.

750
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,910
And someone looks at tornadoes
when tornadoes hit and thinks,

751
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,451
wow,

752
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,550
that would make a great weapon.

753
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:39,200
If I could figure out a way to do that,

754
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:40,940
I'd have the ultimate weapon.

755
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:42,890
Because the problem with nuclear bombs,

756
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,103
aside,

757
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:47,360
aside from the fact that they like
kill hundreds of thousands of innocent

758
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:47,781
people,

759
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:50,060
is they irradiate where they hit.

760
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:55,270
So you end up not being able to move into
that area as a good conquer would want

761
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:56,350
to.

762
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,190
Cause everything's full radiation.

763
00:25:58,191 --> 00:25:59,420
Everything's like Chernobyl.

764
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,660
So you know,

765
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,480
and with bioweapons the same thing.

766
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,000
Well that was the hydrogen bombs.

767
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:07,880
That was the idea behind the hydrogen
bomb was that you could kill everyone

768
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:08,231
there.

769
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:09,190
But leave the structures.

770
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:09,860
Yeah.

771
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,780
Can you imagine that pitch
meeting where somebody,

772
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:15,200
he's like pitching that I've
innovated something great.

773
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,590
We can leave the structures
and kill all the people.

774
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,663
Great Gym.

775
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,623
But with this,

776
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,561
with this idea,

777
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:23,780
it's sort of like a in between thing,

778
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:28,040
which is that not only could you send
in tornadoes or earthquakes to wipe out

779
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:28,880
populations,

780
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,220
but also you could do it anonymously.

781
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,770
No one would even know
who is doing the attack.

782
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,970
You would just think you were having
some bad geological luck for a few years

783
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,350
until everything's flattened.

784
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,640
And then the UN comes in.

785
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:40,911
It's like,

786
00:26:40,911 --> 00:26:41,211
well look,

787
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:42,410
we're going to help you rebuild.

788
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:46,500
And then the next thing you know you've
been infiltrated by the empire taken

789
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:47,550
over and you don't even know it.

790
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,960
It's the ultimate weapon.

791
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:51,250
So it makes a lot of sense that a,

792
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,630
that a government or an empire would
want to investigate this stuff.

793
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,530
Absolutely.

794
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,390
And if this was a possibility,

795
00:26:57,391 --> 00:26:59,430
they would certainly
explore it and look into it.

796
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,800
The real question is
have they ever used it?

797
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:05,040
And that's the beauty of this thing
being sort of an anonymous thing.

798
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,290
If you really can create a storm,

799
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,770
how would you know that someone created
a storm or whether or not it's just a

800
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:11,460
storm.

801
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:11,720
You,

802
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,110
you,

803
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,620
you send a nuclear bomb,

804
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:14,880
there's an obvious footprint.

805
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:16,500
There's sure you know where it came from.

806
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,060
We know a human created it.

807
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,330
They,

808
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,440
they connect the dots.

809
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,550
They find out you can't,

810
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:21,000
like,

811
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,610
it's not like throwing a snowball
in a car and running behind a bush.

812
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,181
When you,

813
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:25,680
when you throw a nuclear bomb,

814
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,663
you get caught.

815
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:28,740
Every,

816
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,060
everybody knows you're an asshole.

817
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,700
You don't need Colombo to solve that one.

818
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,073
[inaudible] question is,

819
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,450
do you think that they've done it already?

820
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,390
That's the real question though.

821
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:39,360
The question is not,

822
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,770
can they manipulate the weather?

823
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,933
It's been proven.

824
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,560
Can they manipulate with harp?

825
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,453
We don't know.

826
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,010
But if they could have they already,

827
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,300
yeah,

828
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:48,890
just I,

829
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,830
I think so.

830
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,280
I,

831
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:50,611
yeah,

832
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:51,061
sure.

833
00:27:51,061 --> 00:27:51,894
If they could,

834
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:52,710
if they could,

835
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,850
they've definitely done it.

836
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,590
Do you think that they
could do it with harp?

837
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,510
I think harp is creepy.

838
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:59,220
I had never heard those sounds before,

839
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:00,960
but I've seen that array of,

840
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,060
um,

841
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,850
uh,

842
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,920
antenna and there's spooky looking.

843
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:09,750
And also I heard that security at harp
is like area 51 level security and I've

844
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:11,430
also heard that they don't,

845
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:12,091
they're very,

846
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:14,100
very secretive about
what's going on over there.

847
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:18,510
So I wouldn't surprise me if
I had something to do with
controlling the weather.

848
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,890
That doesn't surprise me at all.

849
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:20,724
I don't know.

850
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,750
I would hate to break up with someone
who worked at Harv is reigns over your

851
00:28:24,751 --> 00:28:26,250
house for a year straight.

852
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:27,990
It's just always cloudy
in your neighborhood.

853
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,271
Well,

854
00:28:28,271 --> 00:28:32,590
let's listen to what some experts say
because a Stanford University professor

855
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,030
[inaudible] said to popular science
that weather control conspiracy theories

856
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:41,710
were completely uninformed
and he explained that there's
absolutely nothing that

857
00:28:41,711 --> 00:28:44,740
we can do to disturb the
earth's weather systems.

858
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,980
And even though the power that
harp radiates is very large,

859
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,930
it's minuscule compared with the power
of a lightning flash and there are 50 to

860
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:55,570
a hundred lightning
flashes every second harps.

861
00:28:55,571 --> 00:28:57,070
Intensity is very small,

862
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,710
but he could just be a shill.

863
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:00,670
Who knows?

864
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,900
He could be working for the man.

865
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:02,981
Who knows,

866
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:03,131
man,

867
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:05,230
I to Stanford teaching all those liberals.

868
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,870
He's a lot more credible
than some hipster.

869
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,930
And a fedora with a beard
yapping about tornadoes.

870
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,700
Are you a hipster?

871
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,330
Officially?

872
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:13,951
I don't know,

873
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:17,830
but I mean I could be called
wine and I get judged like that.

874
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:18,850
But again,

875
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:19,511
who knows?

876
00:29:19,511 --> 00:29:19,781
Man,

877
00:29:19,781 --> 00:29:19,961
I,

878
00:29:19,961 --> 00:29:24,961
I just think that the government has
explored in governments of the world if

879
00:29:25,091 --> 00:29:30,091
explored how to kill people and almost
every possible way from coming up with

880
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:36,160
weaponized smallpox to
using nuclear bombs.

881
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,050
So why wouldn't they explore it?

882
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,160
Something like the weather,

883
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:42,030
it makes a hundred
percent absolute sense and

884
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,980
you no one else for sure.

885
00:29:43,981 --> 00:29:46,470
This Omran in non is
not hanging out at harp.

886
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:46,921
Okay.

887
00:29:46,921 --> 00:29:47,820
He's not going up there.

888
00:29:47,821 --> 00:29:49,140
He's not talking to those scientists.

889
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:52,470
He's not absolutely clearly informed
as to what they're capable of.

890
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:52,740
Right.

891
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,580
And there's one thing that really smart
people love to do and that they love to

892
00:29:56,581 --> 00:30:01,581
dismiss things that they believe are
silly or things that don't agree with what

893
00:30:01,891 --> 00:30:02,790
they've stated.

894
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,330
Yup.

895
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:08,330
And so a lot of these guys that are
saying this like computer scientist David

896
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,970
Nadick who characterize harp as a magnet
for conspiracy theorists and says that

897
00:30:11,971 --> 00:30:16,620
harp attracts their attention because
it's purpose seems deeply mysterious to

898
00:30:16,621 --> 00:30:18,210
the scientifically uninformed.

899
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,313
He says that.

900
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:24,410
But when you talked to
geniuses and experts in sound
and in the power output and

901
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:26,040
they talk about the,

902
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,221
uh,

903
00:30:26,221 --> 00:30:29,370
the capabilities of a
system like harp there,

904
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:32,670
like you're talking about something
that's being run by Darpa,

905
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,050
right?

906
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:34,590
Yeah.

907
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,423
That's,

908
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,330
let's pull up.

909
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:37,440
What does Darpa stand for?

910
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:38,730
Cause I think it's something evil.

911
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,770
It's definitely something evil.

912
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,090
The defense.

913
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,280
Advanced research projects.

914
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:45,720
Agency defense.

915
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:49,950
I mean maybe that means defense as in
they need to charge up the ionosphere

916
00:30:49,951 --> 00:30:54,410
descend radio signals or maybe it means
that a sound robot in the sky is going

917
00:30:54,411 --> 00:30:55,244
to eat your baby.

918
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:55,851
Absolutely.

919
00:30:55,851 --> 00:30:59,210
And have you seen that other crap
Darpa spits out of their health,

920
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:04,730
those robots that you can kick and they
don't fall over deadly galloping dogs.

921
00:31:04,731 --> 00:31:06,950
Weird springing attack.

922
00:31:06,951 --> 00:31:09,080
Frogs death drones.

923
00:31:09,081 --> 00:31:11,330
Like of course they're trying them
and have their own Twitter though.

924
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,250
Oh,

925
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,180
follow them right now.

926
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,223
Bam.

927
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,900
The official Twitter
account for the defense.

928
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:19,990
Advanced Research Projects Agency follow.

929
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,880
They have 50,000 followers.

930
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:22,600
Sure.

931
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:22,990
Wow.

932
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,890
How many of you have 75
you have more than Darpa.

933
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,720
That sad suck at Darpa.

934
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:29,180
Yeah,

935
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,860
that's what I say.

936
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,730
Fuck off Darpa.

937
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:30,941
No,

938
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:31,710
I love you darling.

939
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,770
Would like to come work there.

940
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,060
I'm going to Alaska and a
couple of weeks to do stand up.

941
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:37,894
I want to visit.

942
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,920
Do you think they'll still let me in?

943
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,610
Yes.

944
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,410
No,

945
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:40,690
no.

946
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,240
It's like the one of the most
secure places on the planet.

947
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,283
They let you in.

948
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,260
That's one of the saddest things when you
run into like any of these people that

949
00:31:48,261 --> 00:31:49,450
you've villainized and you're,

950
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:49,701
I was like,

951
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:49,911
yeah,

952
00:31:49,911 --> 00:31:50,630
come on in.

953
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,530
Check it is thing out.

954
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:52,040
We've got,

955
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,341
yeah,

956
00:31:52,341 --> 00:31:54,290
we're just trying to make
radio waves work better.

957
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:54,610
Yeah.

958
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,900
And then you leave and they laugh.

959
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,420
They turn back into reptiles that fuck it.

960
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:00,254
I got his phone.

961
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,120
Let's follow home kills dog.

962
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,070
Dog died of a heart attack.

963
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,251
Well,

964
00:32:04,251 --> 00:32:05,084
you know,

965
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,320
yeah,

966
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:06,600
yeah.

967
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:06,771
I,

968
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:07,604
you know.

969
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:07,941
Yeah.

970
00:32:07,941 --> 00:32:08,510
I don't,

971
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,201
I don't know.

972
00:32:09,201 --> 00:32:10,034
I didn't.

973
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,600
So there's some things I've learned today.

974
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,140
I didn't know that harp was run by Darpa.

975
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,890
I had no idea that there was any
connection there because I said that.

976
00:32:18,891 --> 00:32:20,450
But let's make sure that that's correct.

977
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,220
Harp run by Darpa.

978
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,233
I think it's true.

979
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,850
High Frequency Dee Dee,

980
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:31,120
Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee,

981
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,060
you n the defense.

982
00:32:33,061 --> 00:32:33,894
Yep.

983
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,003
Okay.

984
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,460
So that's pretty weird because Darpa is
a notorious creator of things that are

985
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,130
without question going to
destroy our civilization.

986
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,940
They just gleefully
whip up death machines,

987
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,720
um,

988
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,370
without any concern for what's
going to happen 50 years from now,

989
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,353
sort of.

990
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,540
Or maybe they just make good
defensive stuff to keep the defense

991
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,860
defense.

992
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,420
Offensive Defensive Department of Defense.

993
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:05,690
Yes.

994
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,280
It about Dunkin and keeping us safe.

995
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,660
It's about the defense.

996
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,570
You know what neat about
offense being offensive?

997
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,190
You know what made me feel really safe?

998
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,050
Uh,

999
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,400
a galloping robotic dog,

1000
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:20,540
they can chase me over may or
may not have cannons on it.

1001
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:27,790
Galloping dog that's half made of c four
that makes its way into your building

1002
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:31,640
and then makes a volcano explodes.

1003
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,960
I felt so scared.

1004
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:34,040
I used to be so nervous.

1005
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:38,720
I'd walk around with fear inside of
me until those packs of wild galloping

1006
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:42,680
Cyborg dogs made solar
powered dogs and by the way,

1007
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:43,590
they could be solar powered.

1008
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:43,850
No,

1009
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,800
ain't just to run all day.

1010
00:33:44,801 --> 00:33:47,030
It never rains here and
they can be autonomous to,

1011
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:52,370
or they're just controlled by 18 year
olds and trailers outside of Vegas with

1012
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:56,270
with Xbox controllers all
messed up on government speed.

1013
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,123
Yeah,

1014
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,150
look at a speed that they give
those those drone operator.

1015
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,410
He makes sure they're
hopped up on the good stuff.

1016
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,490
If you want speed,

1017
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,810
talk to a drone operator,

1018
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,270
they've got the good stuff.

1019
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,040
They don't need big gulps.

1020
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,210
I didn't even drink water.

1021
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,930
They just have a pace to their chew on.

1022
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,270
They don't,

1023
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,770
they don't take in any moisture.

1024
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,100
Moisture disrupts the
effects of the electrolyte

1025
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,220
imbalance that math provides.

1026
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,720
Darpa in the Internet because I
think Darpa invented the Internet.

1027
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,890
I thought Al Gore did

1028
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,280
a,

1029
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,060
I think Darpa did invent the Internet,

1030
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,410
which is going to create a thank you,

1031
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:34,263
right too.

1032
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,040
E

1033
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:41,360
involved in the creation of the
Internet and history of the Internet.

1034
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,460
Formal group with Darpa,

1035
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,930
the fruit.

1036
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,370
A group within Darpa.

1037
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,780
Huh?

1038
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,411
Brief history.

1039
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:50,330
Then in 1973

1040
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,573
okay.

1041
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,603
Yeah.

1042
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,333
Well,

1043
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,540
here's what's interesting.

1044
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:03,590
[inaudible] Darpa is also linked
to the creation of the Internet,

1045
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,610
which is fascinating.

1046
00:35:06,611 --> 00:35:11,611
In 1973 the US defense advanced
research project agency or Darpa,

1047
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,790
initiated a research program
to investigate techniques
and technologies for

1048
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:18,850
interlinking packet
networks of various kinds.

1049
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,390
The objective was to develop
communication protocols,

1050
00:35:22,391 --> 00:35:27,220
which would allow network computers to
communicate transparently across multiple

1051
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,720
linked packet networks.

1052
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,550
So it was created by Darpa.

1053
00:35:30,551 --> 00:35:33,850
The very thing that will bring
down the empire was created by it.

1054
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,211
Well,

1055
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:34,331
see,

1056
00:35:34,331 --> 00:35:34,751
that's what I,

1057
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:38,970
that's what happens to all mad scientists
is their creation turns against that.

1058
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:39,391
So true.

1059
00:35:39,391 --> 00:35:40,080
Frankenstein.

1060
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,201
Yeah.

1061
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:41,120
It was killed by Frankenstein.

1062
00:35:41,121 --> 00:35:42,240
It's an inevitability.

1063
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:42,900
It is,

1064
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,410
isn't it?

1065
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,160
Yeah.

1066
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,050
So this thing that,

1067
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,470
so they unleashed the internet.

1068
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:49,120
Who knows what else they've unleashed
or they're going to unleash,

1069
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,711
but you know what else?

1070
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:54,711
The Internet did inform people about
mushrooms maybe that can help them with

1071
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:55,920
Darpa needs mushrooms.

1072
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,843
That's what they need.

1073
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,900
Imagine the kind of shit that you could
create if you had the technology and the

1074
00:36:02,181 --> 00:36:03,350
resources of Darpa.

1075
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:03,580
Yeah,

1076
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,290
but it was all people on mushrooms.

1077
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,910
They're beautiful world.

1078
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,200
It'd be amazing.

1079
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,530
Think of what burning man would
look like if Darpa took it over.

1080
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,590
They would kill all the
people begging for sandwiches.

1081
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,663
That'd be the first thing.

1082
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,790
Take him outside of we know how to do it.

1083
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:22,080
Them like they didn't even care.

1084
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:24,330
Even if they're on mushrooms and
just still just shoot hippies.

1085
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:25,621
Let's tell you,

1086
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:26,940
just knew you did that.

1087
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:27,811
Come on guys.

1088
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,180
Stop crying in.

1089
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,500
Know that brother was a loser.

1090
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,030
You brother had dirty feet.

1091
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:33,960
Come on,

1092
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:34,651
come on.

1093
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:35,101
We shot him.

1094
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:35,611
What's the big deal?

1095
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:36,444
I got more mushrooms.

1096
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,950
Who wants to sing?

1097
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,150
Who wants to get in a drum circle?

1098
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,830
Drones that shoot poison darts at
anything that smells like Patchouli.

1099
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,231
Some hot girls.

1100
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:47,960
It's more like a truly a lot.

1101
00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:48,940
A lot of hot girls.

1102
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:49,951
Some girls,

1103
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:51,120
they were like little oil.

1104
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,420
Just as a gentle like I look very oil.

1105
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:55,443
Mm hmm.

1106
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,160
I love that sweet smell up at
Julian and I body the sweet smell.

1107
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:03,630
But truly and bumper stickers.

1108
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,270
I like the sweet smell of it,

1109
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:05,561
Julie,

1110
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:07,290
cause there's usually
like good acid around.

1111
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,040
Now here's the other thing.

1112
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,650
Here's the other thing that people
think a harp is responsible for.

1113
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,680
There's a thing in Windsor and
it's called the Windsor Hum.

1114
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,040
And these poor people that live in this
town that's across the river from Zug

1115
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,190
Island,

1116
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,210
which is near Detroit.

1117
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,030
And these poor people
that live in Windsor,

1118
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:35,590
they say that their houses rattle their
windows rattle and sometimes it's 24

1119
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:35,921
hours a day.

1120
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,180
Just whoo,

1121
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,320
whoo,

1122
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,010
whoo.

1123
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,630
That's how they all describe it.

1124
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,330
And no one can seem to
locate the source of it.

1125
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:49,260
Some people say that it's coming from
Zug Island and some people say that even

1126
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:51,730
though you can't hear it near Zug island,

1127
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,470
it gets more powerful.

1128
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:54,880
The further away you get.

1129
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,660
And they describe it as like a
tsunami effect that like a tsunami,

1130
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,190
like it starts in one place,

1131
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:01,390
then builds up powers.

1132
00:38:01,391 --> 00:38:02,201
It moves along well.

1133
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:04,000
If you talked to anybody
knows anything about sound,

1134
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:05,590
they say that's not how sound works,

1135
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,720
but they seem to describe it that way.

1136
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,770
They just scream seem to describe it as
a sound that's coming from a place where

1137
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:13,780
they can't quite pinpoint where it is.

1138
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,030
They want to say it's
coming towards Zug island.

1139
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,040
But some folks say that as
you get closer to Zug island,

1140
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,330
it actually is less noisy than it
is when you're further away from it.

1141
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:26,530
It's a really weird thing and it's
not one person complaining about this.

1142
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,630
You're talking about an
entire town of people.

1143
00:38:28,631 --> 00:38:29,980
We talked to several people,

1144
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,240
not one of them was like,

1145
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:32,560
what are you talking to?

1146
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,800
Does anybody live on Zug Island?

1147
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:35,740
No.

1148
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:35,951
No.

1149
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:36,550
Zug Island

1150
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,390
is gross.

1151
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,560
We went to visit.

1152
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:40,570
Sounds great with such a beautiful name.

1153
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,250
Who would think that it would be gross?

1154
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,170
Zug Island stinks.

1155
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,610
It smells like pollution.

1156
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:49,330
You could buy a house across the
river from Zug island for 500 bucks.

1157
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,530
That's how bad it is.

1158
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,101
So there,

1159
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:55,060
so what you're saying is
there's this low resonant hum.

1160
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,970
I'm merging from a place called Zug island

1161
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,350
and would Zug island is for,

1162
00:38:59,420 --> 00:38:59,790
it's,

1163
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,330
it's it cross from Detroit.

1164
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,910
It's a part of Detroit and it's for you.

1165
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:08,380
They make steel there and they have these
giant piles of raw materials and these

1166
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:09,191
furnaces.

1167
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:14,170
And we talked to a guy named
Gregory Fornia who worked
there in the 1960s and it

1168
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:14,350
was,

1169
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,800
he said it was always disgusting and it
was always dangerous and it was always

1170
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:19,030
environmental hazards.

1171
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:19,691
This is really,

1172
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,650
really polluted.

1173
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:24,430
The river around there is one of the
10 most polluted places in the United

1174
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:24,610
States,

1175
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,280
and yet people are fishing
there and pulling fish out
left and right where we're

1176
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:27,730
there.

1177
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:29,080
So it really kind of scary stuff.

1178
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,160
But he,

1179
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,050
he said that what they're doing,

1180
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:36,430
they're a wood they've always been doing
there is manufacturing steel and he

1181
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:40,450
believes that that sound is
just a part of the process,

1182
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:40,751
the,

1183
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:41,230
the,

1184
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:41,441
the,

1185
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:43,690
the process of creating and making steel.

1186
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,350
Sure.

1187
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,070
That makes sense.

1188
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,000
It does make sense.

1189
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:48,640
What doesn't make sense
though is the sound itself,

1190
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,430
when you bring the sound to
sound experts and you say,

1191
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:55,360
is it possible that this
sound was recorded six miles,

1192
00:39:55,361 --> 00:39:56,150
five miles?

1193
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,190
Is it possible?

1194
00:39:57,191 --> 00:40:01,600
This sound was recorded x amount of miles
away from a source and was this loud

1195
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:03,070
in a person's house and they say,

1196
00:40:03,071 --> 00:40:03,850
no way.

1197
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,510
We met a guy in Windsor named Gary Gross
and Gary recorded some sounds that he

1198
00:40:07,511 --> 00:40:08,760
says are the winds are home.

1199
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:09,211
All right.

1200
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:09,761
And listen to this.

1201
00:40:09,761 --> 00:40:10,594
We're going to play it for you.

1202
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,673
Huh?

1203
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,230
The imagine being in your house.

1204
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,550
Okay.

1205
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:25,550
And there's something here like this
and he is miles away from Zug island.

1206
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,221
I mean,

1207
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:32,580
it sounds like you're
outside of nightclub.

1208
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,780
It sounds like high powered bass speakers.

1209
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,310
Huh?

1210
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,270
Inside a building.

1211
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,380
Except there's nothing near him.

1212
00:40:39,381 --> 00:40:42,500
He's just in his house and everyone
in his neighborhood feels it as well.

1213
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:46,190
So you're not talking about something
that's like a car that has giant speakers.

1214
00:40:46,191 --> 00:40:47,660
It's right outside your door.

1215
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,010
And that's why you hear this.

1216
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:53,690
We you're talking about is something
that somehow or another is making these

1217
00:40:53,691 --> 00:40:57,950
people's houses vibrate
like this from miles away.

1218
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,520
We don't know of any kind of sound
that can do something like that.

1219
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,620
What is Woody's last name would,

1220
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,243
wouldn't even Doris.

1221
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:05,571
Nobody.

1222
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:06,080
Not Worries.

1223
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,450
When we played this
sound for Woody Norris,

1224
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,940
who is a an acoustical expert,

1225
00:41:10,941 --> 00:41:11,774
an engineer,

1226
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,160
brilliant genius.

1227
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:13,851
He said,

1228
00:41:13,851 --> 00:41:17,540
there's no way the industrial
process could make this sound.

1229
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,860
He said that the amount of power that
would be required to make a sound like

1230
00:41:21,861 --> 00:41:26,120
this that would travel that far and
not dissipate in the environment is

1231
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,860
incredible.

1232
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:29,330
Yeah.

1233
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:29,960
Now,

1234
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,730
is this something that
has been documented?

1235
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,610
Yes.

1236
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:33,443
The sour,

1237
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,330
the sound has been documented.

1238
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,910
This sound has been documented by
the people that live in the town.

1239
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,060
It's been documented by the politicians
that try to get the explanations for the

1240
00:41:41,061 --> 00:41:41,894
citizens,

1241
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:46,550
but if this is a sound that
is emanating from Zug island,

1242
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,690
it would have to be
insanely loud on Zug island.

1243
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,020
What people are saying though
is that when you're around it,

1244
00:41:54,021 --> 00:41:54,890
when you're in the river,

1245
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,360
it's not that loud.

1246
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,590
It's when you get further away
that it's doing things like this,

1247
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,750
that it's vibrating people's windows,

1248
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,130
vibrating their houses.

1249
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,230
There's no known explanation for this and
when I talk to this guy who's an audio

1250
00:42:09,231 --> 00:42:09,741
expert,

1251
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:12,710
he says that in order to create
a power output like that,

1252
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:15,860
you're talking about an insane amount of,

1253
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,300
yeah,

1254
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,110
sure.

1255
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:17,321
Yeah.

1256
00:42:17,321 --> 00:42:17,950
No that's,

1257
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:18,550
that's an,

1258
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,720
that's a really,

1259
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:24,850
really intense sound and it'd be a bummer
to have to deal with listening to that

1260
00:42:24,851 --> 00:42:27,370
because that is a depressing sound.

1261
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,420
That's a sound like in my
neighborhood when that sounds starts,

1262
00:42:31,421 --> 00:42:31,811
you,

1263
00:42:31,811 --> 00:42:35,920
you're not sleeping that night cause
someone's having some idiot party until

1264
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:38,110
4:00 AM it sounds like a party.

1265
00:42:38,111 --> 00:42:40,960
It sounds like bass
speakers it sounds like,

1266
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,040
but that would be like your neighbor.

1267
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,260
You would have to be like really
close for that to be affecting you.

1268
00:42:46,261 --> 00:42:46,760
Like

1269
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,130
I'm just saying that as a weapon.

1270
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,301
If you wanted to,

1271
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:55,301
if you were experimenting with weird
forms of weaponry and you could blast that

1272
00:42:55,521 --> 00:43:00,140
sound over someone that you were fighting
or someone that you wanted to disrupt,

1273
00:43:00,141 --> 00:43:02,720
that would do it because
that is not a pleasant sound.

1274
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:03,051
Right,

1275
00:43:03,051 --> 00:43:03,651
but that I don't,

1276
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:05,600
don't think that that's
what anybody's claiming.

1277
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:09,500
I think what they're claiming is that
this is a side effect of the use of this

1278
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,453
technology.

1279
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:10,760
Ah,

1280
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,000
and that most likely what Zug island is,

1281
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:19,030
is some sort of a repeater and that
these people are experiencing the sound

1282
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,280
outside of the island because of harp.

1283
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,740
How close is that to harp?

1284
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,810
It's very far from harp,

1285
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,410
but what they're saying is that Zug
island could be a repeater station.

1286
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,200
And the other thing
about harp is that harp,

1287
00:43:33,201 --> 00:43:34,760
although it's really far away,

1288
00:43:34,761 --> 00:43:39,080
the whole purpose of the magnetizing
the ionosphere or a rather,

1289
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:39,914
um,

1290
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:40,640
uh,

1291
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,960
charging the ionosphere shooting these
waves into the ionosphere is so that they

1292
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:47,300
can transmit long distances.

1293
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:52,460
So what the conspiracy theorists believe
is that Zug island is some sort of a

1294
00:43:52,461 --> 00:43:53,390
repeater station.

1295
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,110
So these people who live in Windsor across
the river from Zug island are getting

1296
00:43:57,111 --> 00:44:02,111
this crazy sound echo thing going
on that's rattling their buildings.

1297
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:03,500
No one can explain it.

1298
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,480
W W shaking their windows.

1299
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:05,811
I mean,

1300
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:07,490
these people have really freaked out.

1301
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:08,061
And again,

1302
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:10,070
it's not like a couple
people we're talking to.

1303
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:11,210
Is this always happening?

1304
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,660
It happens quite often and
it's dissipated apparently.

1305
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,070
And that's where the heart,

1306
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:20,180
the heart proponents believe that what's
happening is that they've realized that

1307
00:44:20,181 --> 00:44:21,380
they're making the sound now,

1308
00:44:21,381 --> 00:44:23,060
so they've turned down the power out.

1309
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:24,030
I don't,

1310
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:24,751
I don't buy it,

1311
00:44:24,751 --> 00:44:24,961
man.

1312
00:44:24,961 --> 00:44:28,740
I think if you're dealing with like this
super advanced Darpa project that can

1313
00:44:28,741 --> 00:44:29,574
shoot out,

1314
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,570
uh,

1315
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:31,170
things,

1316
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,190
the ion is fear.

1317
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,150
They're not going to be like,

1318
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,391
hey,

1319
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:38,391
let's turn Zug island outside of Detroit
into a bass speaker so that everyone

1320
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:40,080
can freak out.

1321
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:40,361
No,

1322
00:44:40,361 --> 00:44:41,230
that's not what they're saying.

1323
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:43,030
They're not saying that
they're doing it on purpose.

1324
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:47,040
What they're saying is this is a side
effect what they're trying to accomplish.

1325
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:47,410
Right.

1326
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:51,310
I don't think anyone is saying that those
sky quakes or something they're doing

1327
00:44:51,311 --> 00:44:52,144
on purpose.

1328
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,620
What they're doing is they're doing some
sort of experiments and in doing those

1329
00:44:56,621 --> 00:44:57,430
experiments,

1330
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:01,180
one of the side effects is this
very strange sound phenomenon.

1331
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,930
We're going to go there
and see and investigate and
talk to some of these people

1332
00:45:04,931 --> 00:45:06,730
and find out if this holds up.

1333
00:45:06,731 --> 00:45:11,620
But it's a very interesting possibility
and these sounds are very unique.

1334
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:12,430
And you know,

1335
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,720
very ominous and weird.

1336
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,131
Yeah,

1337
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:15,120
they're definitely weird.

1338
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:15,830
I just,

1339
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:17,790
I wonder about the Darpa connection,

1340
00:45:17,791 --> 00:45:21,120
but if you go there and
actually hear the sound,

1341
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:22,560
I'll be more likely to believe it.

1342
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:26,040
It's the kind of thing where if I knew
someone who'd actually heard the sound

1343
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:26,730
themselves,

1344
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:27,840
then I don't know.

1345
00:45:27,841 --> 00:45:28,110
It just,

1346
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,570
this seems like it seems so easy to fake.

1347
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:34,050
It seems so easy to drop these
kinds of things into sound files.

1348
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:34,410
Okay.

1349
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:35,130
Totally.

1350
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,000
I totally agree.

1351
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,170
The thing is though,

1352
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:37,620
the,

1353
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,140
the compelling thing is
that all of these folks,

1354
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:43,650
it's well documented that these
people have been complaining.

1355
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:44,401
In fact,

1356
00:45:44,401 --> 00:45:45,630
when I went through customs,

1357
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:46,561
the guy asked me,

1358
00:45:46,561 --> 00:45:47,221
what are you here for?

1359
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:47,611
And I said,

1360
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,440
I'm a here to listen to some hum.

1361
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:49,981
And he goes,

1362
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:50,131
oh,

1363
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:50,970
the winds or hum.

1364
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:51,750
Like he goes all,

1365
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:51,931
I go,

1366
00:45:51,931 --> 00:45:52,764
what is that?

1367
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:53,011
He goes,

1368
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:54,690
it's probably something
going on at Zug island,

1369
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,890
like right away the cop that
works at the border tells me,

1370
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,380
do you feel,

1371
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,190
did you hear it?

1372
00:45:59,190 --> 00:45:59,610
No,

1373
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:00,390
we didn't hear it.

1374
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,130
But we heard a lot of industrial noise.

1375
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:02,800
Right.

1376
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,350
And it didn't sound anything like that.

1377
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,540
What we heard is like call out are
clanging and trucks moving and stuff.

1378
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,270
Is there any got like one going
on around there or any of them?

1379
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:11,760
No,

1380
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,031
no.

1381
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:13,620
That stuff's mostly done on Canada.

1382
00:46:13,621 --> 00:46:13,890
Huh?

1383
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:14,601
This is what they,

1384
00:46:14,601 --> 00:46:17,880
what they're doing there is they're
just creating steel and they're a,

1385
00:46:17,881 --> 00:46:19,040
they're mixing the,

1386
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,090
the raw elements to create,

1387
00:46:21,091 --> 00:46:23,040
create steel and their furnaces.

1388
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:23,580
And there,

1389
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,300
there's some,

1390
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,810
there's a lot of industrial stuff going
on there and it's very high security,

1391
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:32,520
but the high security can easily be
explained in that that steel and make,

1392
00:46:32,521 --> 00:46:36,840
creating all that steel is very important
to the industrial output of the United

1393
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:36,841
States.

1394
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:37,090
It's,

1395
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:37,850
it would be,

1396
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:38,310
uh,

1397
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:41,980
if you were looking for a place
to disrupt our economy or to,

1398
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,833
to mess up,

1399
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:43,231
you know,

1400
00:46:43,231 --> 00:46:45,270
an area that would be
something that would do it.

1401
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:45,681
Yeah.

1402
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:46,281
I didn't know that.

1403
00:46:46,281 --> 00:46:47,900
You just mentioned that
you didn't say there.

1404
00:46:47,901 --> 00:46:49,190
It's a high security area.

1405
00:46:49,191 --> 00:46:50,480
I think that's really weird.

1406
00:46:50,481 --> 00:46:53,450
If this is just supposed to be
some toxified industrial island,

1407
00:46:53,451 --> 00:46:55,820
I think there is something
suspicious about the therapy.

1408
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:56,400
Uh,

1409
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,890
the combination of a massive amount of
security around a polluted island and

1410
00:47:00,891 --> 00:47:04,790
some bizarre Godzilla noise
rising up out of the nothingness.

1411
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:07,340
That does seem to indicate that
there's more going on there.

1412
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:08,840
Then just making steel.

1413
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,650
You're right.

1414
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,730
It's very possible.

1415
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:11,391
However,

1416
00:47:11,391 --> 00:47:15,740
it's also very possible that what you're
dealing with is a high security because

1417
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:17,540
they're creating steel there.

1418
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:21,590
It's incredibly dangerous that
working with volatile materials,

1419
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:26,000
they're also probably doing a lot of
environmental damage that they wouldn't

1420
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:30,820
want people to investigate or people
to shine cameras and expose all this.

1421
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:35,930
I mean it's stinks there but when you
go there the water is like greasy with

1422
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,100
whatever the hell they're leaking into it.

1423
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,280
The guy that we were with
was Taz that it floats green.

1424
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,360
There's like this glowing green shit
that you see in the water so it's not

1425
00:47:46,361 --> 00:47:46,810
healthy.

1426
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:47,530
It's definitely,

1427
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:48,760
it's definitely stinks.

1428
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:49,830
It's definitely bad.

1429
00:47:49,831 --> 00:47:50,110
We,

1430
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,400
we were thinking while we were there,

1431
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:54,070
like were breathing this
hand like this is like we're,

1432
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:54,600
we're,

1433
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:55,930
we're taking it fumes.

1434
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,171
Yeah.

1435
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:58,210
Detroit is a crazy place man.

1436
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:02,110
When I went and performed at
Mark Reilly's comedy castle,

1437
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,101
awesome spot.

1438
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:04,540
The Guy who drove me there,

1439
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:08,080
he told me that he used to buy
eight balls and go camping,

1440
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:11,290
like who does cocaine camping?

1441
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,573
Kid Rock.

1442
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:15,873
Yeah.

1443
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,760
I don't think he could blame
Detroit or Zug island on that,

1444
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:19,900
but I feel you.

1445
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:20,711
Yeah.

1446
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:22,810
Detroit is the worst person
in the world to be a book.

1447
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:24,790
That's the worst place in
the world to be a book.

1448
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:28,940
There's 47% illiteracy rate and they
call it the first American ruin.

1449
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:29,760
Yeah,

1450
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,560
because there's so many at
parts of it that are just gone.

1451
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:32,850
Dude,

1452
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,090
across from Zug island,

1453
00:48:34,091 --> 00:48:38,800
you can get a house in
Detroit for $500 we saw them,

1454
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,260
they were telling us about
it and we saw amazing.

1455
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:41,861
It's incredible.

1456
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:42,850
And you don't want that house.

1457
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:43,121
Well,

1458
00:48:43,121 --> 00:48:43,301
no.

1459
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:48,301
It's got toxic mold and it's next to
the moaning of Baphomet and the smell.

1460
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,400
The smell is horrible.

1461
00:48:51,401 --> 00:48:52,750
The smell in the air is,

1462
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:54,280
it's really a shame.

1463
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:54,940
It's a shame.

1464
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,410
I know you need steel.

1465
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,460
I know that they need it,

1466
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:01,330
but first of all to do it right there
in a highly populated area like Detroit

1467
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:03,700
and to do that kind of
damage to the environment.

1468
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:04,810
It's just sad.

1469
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:05,300
It's sad,

1470
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,310
it seems archaic.

1471
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:09,070
It seems like some shit that they should
have figured out how to do better a

1472
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,950
long time ago and it kind of makes
sense that if you're disrupting the

1473
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:13,740
environment at that level in someplace,

1474
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,880
then there's going to be unexplained
side effects like some odd noise.

1475
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,560
I don't think that is the case.

1476
00:49:20,561 --> 00:49:21,490
So this is the thing.

1477
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:26,670
I don't know whether or not the noise
and the industrial output or connected.

1478
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,880
It makes sense when you look at the sound
and the sound is coming from this spot

1479
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,270
and you look at the spot and
it's a lot of machines moving.

1480
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:38,020
There's a lot of digging in the ground
is a lot of making steel Aquaman's razor

1481
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:39,970
would dictate that sound is
probably coming from there,

1482
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,670
but if these people are to be believed,

1483
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,610
these people that are talking about this
sound and the rattling of the houses,

1484
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:46,870
it's too much power.

1485
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:47,860
It's too much power.

1486
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:50,050
It's too far away and it's too strange.

1487
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:51,520
It doesn't seem to make sense.

1488
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:55,510
And would it could be is that
we're connecting these two,

1489
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,910
these two events together.

1490
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,210
Right,

1491
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:58,511
but they're,

1492
00:49:58,511 --> 00:50:01,930
they're not connected and that all those
Zug island is a place where they make

1493
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:04,240
the sound where they
were creating or rather,

1494
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,980
although Zug island is a place where
they make steel that this noise is not

1495
00:50:08,981 --> 00:50:10,180
emanating from Zug island,

1496
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:12,730
but in fact it's coming
from the sky itself,

1497
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,540
from harp.

1498
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:16,930
It's just that people are assuming that
Zug island has something to do with it

1499
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:20,440
cause Zog islands gross so
that it's just a coincidence.

1500
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:21,460
Super Creepy.

1501
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,121
It is creepy.

1502
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:22,780
That sound,

1503
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,760
that sound is real is very creepy.

1504
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:25,240
Yeah,

1505
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:25,840
it's horrible.

1506
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,170
But you have a good point too,

1507
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:29,810
is that we didn't hear
that sound and unless,

1508
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,093
unless you,

1509
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,980
even if it was like
someone you really know,

1510
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:38,630
how do you know whether or not they're
really recording that sound or whether

1511
00:50:38,631 --> 00:50:41,480
they're getting wacky and getting on
their computer and creating it and say,

1512
00:50:41,481 --> 00:50:45,260
I'm going to freak everybody out and I'm
going to bring some more cause or more

1513
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:46,970
people to this cause more,

1514
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,110
more eyes and ears to this plight that
we're suffering here when really it's

1515
00:50:51,111 --> 00:50:53,740
just normal industrial noise that
people are complaining about.

1516
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:56,240
You gotta go there and see
and if there's the site,

1517
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:57,200
if you hear the sound,

1518
00:50:57,201 --> 00:50:58,340
which I bet you won't,

1519
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,830
then it will be interesting.

1520
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:01,970
Why do you bet I won't,

1521
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:02,240
man.

1522
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,073
Maybe I will.

1523
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:03,970
Okay.

1524
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:04,803
I don't think there you,

1525
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:10,480
I think the sound of Zug island is the
sound of people's neurons frying is they

1526
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:15,611
smoked Detroit level crystal meth in
the basements of their $500 crap homes.

1527
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:16,800
Whoa,

1528
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,410
Whoa,

1529
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,280
whoa.

1530
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:23,230
That's the sound of your brain
rotting inside your skull,

1531
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:26,050
bouncing back and forth
off the bony walls.

1532
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,153
There it is.

1533
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:29,741
Imagine though,

1534
00:51:29,741 --> 00:51:31,510
if you were in your house
and you're hearing this,

1535
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,540
it would be the most annoying thing ever.

1536
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,110
And these people say that it could be 24
hours a day and then sometimes they'll

1537
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:40,390
get up in the middle of the night to
pee and then we'll hear that sound and

1538
00:51:40,391 --> 00:51:41,500
they'll never get back to bed.

1539
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:45,520
They also said that for some reason
it seems to correspond with the rain.

1540
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,070
They said when it's stormy and rainy,

1541
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:48,880
sometime there's,

1542
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,713
there's that sound.

1543
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:54,190
That is where the heart people come in
because they think that that's not a

1544
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:58,480
coincidence and they think that the rain
itself might be rained that was created

1545
00:51:58,481 --> 00:52:01,990
by harp and that that's why these people
are saying that whenever it rains and

1546
00:52:01,991 --> 00:52:02,650
your thunder,

1547
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,420
that's when this sound is more prominent.

1548
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,081
Wow,

1549
00:52:05,081 --> 00:52:05,741
that's crazy.

1550
00:52:05,741 --> 00:52:06,430
It's crazy.

1551
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:11,430
As symptom of whether being controlled
by harp is low resonant sound sky quakes.

1552
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:13,720
But that makes sense.

1553
00:52:13,721 --> 00:52:14,200
Sound.

1554
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:14,860
Think of that.

1555
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:19,390
It's raining out and you hear this
sound and you know that big brother is

1556
00:52:19,391 --> 00:52:23,830
fucking with the sky and making it
rain above your shitty $500 house.

1557
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,723
Uh,

1558
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,653
that's leaking.

1559
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,840
Is it bad enough that I'm here breathing
in toxic farts and living in a $500

1560
00:52:31,261 --> 00:52:31,900
house.

1561
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:35,440
You guys got to shake my three remaining
windows with your stupid sound.

1562
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:38,730
All I want to do is smoke my mat in peace.

1563
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:45,700
There's a physicist named Brooks Agnew
who says that he can demonstrate the

1564
00:52:45,701 --> 00:52:50,701
effects of harp in a box that he's
built and he creates artificial clouds.

1565
00:52:50,921 --> 00:52:52,210
He is like one of those MREs.

1566
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,780
You know how you buy like a bonsai tree
at the mall and they have like the fog

1567
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,500
that's flowing out of those are beautiful,

1568
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:58,210
right?

1569
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,150
Well that stuff is very similar to clouds.

1570
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,073
That vapor,

1571
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:05,140
that water vapor and
they puff out at clubs.

1572
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:05,950
Yes.

1573
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:06,311
No,

1574
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:06,670
that's,

1575
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:07,510
that's a smoke.

1576
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,430
That's the shit that
Michael Braverman likes.

1577
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,010
He likes to put that when
we're doing promos a fuck,

1578
00:53:12,011 --> 00:53:13,420
he likes to fill the air with that shit.

1579
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:17,201
You know.

1580
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:18,034
I love you buddy.

1581
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:19,000
Um,

1582
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,361
no.

1583
00:53:19,361 --> 00:53:19,870
The um,

1584
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:20,620
it's actually,

1585
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:20,980
uh,

1586
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:21,700
it's vapor.

1587
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,660
It's water vapor,

1588
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:25,030
but this guy claims that he,

1589
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,153
this device

1590
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:31,340
that can create the same sort of effect
by charging the particles that are

1591
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,120
inside of this,

1592
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,440
this box that he built,

1593
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,960
he can actually prove the effects of harp.

1594
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:37,891
Well,

1595
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:42,891
he's saying that there is a correlation
between the e cigarette smoke and his

1596
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:46,290
box and actual clouds.

1597
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:47,670
Well,

1598
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:48,780
what clouds are,

1599
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:49,920
is vapor.

1600
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:55,040
It's moisture and it's in
a condensed sort of a one.

1601
00:53:55,221 --> 00:53:58,830
I should probably actually
have a technical explanation
because I just ventured

1602
00:53:58,831 --> 00:53:59,450
into bullshit.

1603
00:53:59,450 --> 00:53:59,850
I do that.

1604
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:00,990
I felt myself doing it,

1605
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:03,240
but I pulled back what a
cloud is and I'll never,

1606
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:04,980
I have no idea what it is.

1607
00:54:04,981 --> 00:54:09,981
A visible mass of liquid droplets or
frozen crystals made of water or various

1608
00:54:10,921 --> 00:54:14,680
chemicals suspended in the atmosphere
above the surface of a planetary body.

1609
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,050
Okay,

1610
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:15,690
so now you know,

1611
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:16,180
so it's,

1612
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,590
it is clouds with his guys creating as
essentially the same thing as clouds.

1613
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,130
He's using moisture and he's using
this machine that does something and it

1614
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:24,420
creates e-cigarettes,

1615
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:25,141
e-cigarettes,

1616
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:30,141
or an ionizer that creates water vapor
that has nicotine infused into the vapor.

1617
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,130
Just like Stephen Dorff.

1618
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,360
Awesome commercials.

1619
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:35,491
Now.

1620
00:54:35,491 --> 00:54:36,330
Hey guys,

1621
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:41,390
come on guys to take back our freedom
saying that if this is like if a giant

1622
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:42,870
Stephen Dorff,

1623
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:46,230
we're breathing east segregate
cigarette smoke over America,

1624
00:54:46,231 --> 00:54:47,070
it would be cloud.

1625
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:52,100
And if you had a machine you could zap
that the clouds and make a tornado that

1626
00:54:52,921 --> 00:54:57,300
take Stephen Dorff away like the house
and the wizard of Oz where it lands on

1627
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:57,810
the witch.

1628
00:54:57,810 --> 00:54:58,410
Yes.

1629
00:54:58,410 --> 00:54:59,011
Just like that.

1630
00:54:59,011 --> 00:55:02,400
And then Darpa would finally have
done something amazing for the world.

1631
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,460
That would be the second best
thing they did since the Internet.

1632
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:05,731
Look,

1633
00:55:05,731 --> 00:55:07,470
Stephen Dorff was awesome and blade.

1634
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:07,921
Okay.

1635
00:55:07,921 --> 00:55:08,280
Yeah.

1636
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,300
So you need to step.

1637
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,360
I stepped played one
is the best blade ever.

1638
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,820
Stephen Dorff was the,

1639
00:55:13,821 --> 00:55:15,450
the the bad guy and he was amazing.

1640
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:16,483
She's amazing.

1641
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,040
Great.

1642
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:17,873
So shut it.

1643
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:19,780
I'm sorry Steven to laugh.

1644
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:20,561
Please apologize.

1645
00:55:20,561 --> 00:55:21,250
He's too easy.

1646
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:22,110
Stephen Dorff.

1647
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,640
Steven making our cloud.

1648
00:55:23,641 --> 00:55:25,950
Stephen Dorff is the Nickelback of actors.

1649
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,540
It's too easy to pick on him.

1650
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:28,560
It's not fair.

1651
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,573
It's rude.

1652
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,140
It's cheap and it's rude.

1653
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,940
He's the rape joke of actors.

1654
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:34,823
We just need to stop.

1655
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,860
He just stopped the Stephen Stephen
Dorff happened to be flipping through

1656
00:55:37,861 --> 00:55:40,620
channels right now and heard
that he's going for his pistol.

1657
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,440
Well don't shoot me as long as
you going to shoot yourself.

1658
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,060
Death is inevitable with my friend.

1659
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:45,481
Okay,

1660
00:55:45,481 --> 00:55:46,200
but murder,

1661
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,690
you don't want to murder
charge like yourself,

1662
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:48,031
Steven,

1663
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:48,661
don't do it.

1664
00:55:48,661 --> 00:55:49,280
You're going to be fun.

1665
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:49,651
So look,

1666
00:55:49,651 --> 00:55:50,040
I don't,

1667
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,020
I think that it's a interesting thing.

1668
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,220
I the box.

1669
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,280
I would wonder if the clouds in this
box are identical to the clouds.

1670
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:04,310
It they are actually floating overland
because I think like what you just did

1671
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:05,480
definition that you just read it.

1672
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:06,361
Ice Crystals,

1673
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:07,194
chemicals.

1674
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,360
This is just like ionized vapor.

1675
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:12,600
So I wonder if it looks like it's
actually better liquid droplets.

1676
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:16,260
It's a visible mass of liquid droplets
or frozen crystal sugar water.

1677
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:18,780
So it's close enough
for various chemicals.

1678
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:20,400
Like there can be a toxic cloud too.

1679
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:22,350
That's not not water droplets.

1680
00:56:22,351 --> 00:56:24,310
Chemicals can actually form toxic

1681
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:24,590
clouds.

1682
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,680
And he's saying that by shooting
some form of electricity into this,

1683
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,710
this is what he says.

1684
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,800
So we're going to say,

1685
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,230
and we're not going to
say we've already seen,

1686
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:33,510
so we're going to change shirts and
we're going to go right into this because

1687
00:56:33,511 --> 00:56:34,380
this guy's an idiot.

1688
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:35,280
Okay,

1689
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,113
awesome.

1690
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:42,470
So I go to visit this physicist named
Brooks Agnew and Brooks Agnew has a box

1691
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:47,250
that he's got this artificial clouds
that he's created with this Mr Machine.

1692
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:47,700
Yeah.

1693
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:51,210
And he believes that he has this
machine that can dissipate the clouds.

1694
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:53,880
So we go and do the experiments.

1695
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,743
First of all,

1696
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,580
here's red flag number one.

1697
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,320
We walk in the door and his friend,

1698
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:58,801
uh,

1699
00:56:58,801 --> 00:56:59,940
there's a photo of a,

1700
00:56:59,941 --> 00:57:02,250
an Indian man with
white paint on his face.

1701
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,293
So I say,

1702
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:04,163
what's up with this dude?

1703
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,183
And he said,

1704
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:05,671
he went,

1705
00:57:05,671 --> 00:57:09,030
underwent an amazing transformation
of his body 10 years ago,

1706
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:11,430
and now he no longer needs food or water.

1707
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:12,773
And I go,

1708
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:13,111
no,

1709
00:57:13,111 --> 00:57:13,890
he didn't.

1710
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,240
And I just walk out of the room.

1711
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:15,931
I go,

1712
00:57:15,931 --> 00:57:16,141
no,

1713
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:16,561
he didn't.

1714
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:17,040
He goes,

1715
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:17,880
you have to meet this guy.

1716
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:18,031
Go,

1717
00:57:18,031 --> 00:57:18,301
no,

1718
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:18,990
I don't.

1719
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:19,261
No,

1720
00:57:19,261 --> 00:57:19,650
I don't.

1721
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:20,610
I don't have to meet him.

1722
00:57:20,611 --> 00:57:21,510
And that guy eats,

1723
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,741
stop,

1724
00:57:22,741 --> 00:57:23,574
get away from me.

1725
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,240
And like I knew right away we'd made a
horrible mistake cause this is the dude

1726
00:57:27,241 --> 00:57:28,050
he's partying with.

1727
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:28,500
Okay.

1728
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,630
It's not the scientist
and the scientist buddy.

1729
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,200
Okay.

1730
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,190
So we go in that Brooks has this machine
and in this machine he's got the clouds

1731
00:57:35,191 --> 00:57:35,551
and he's like,

1732
00:57:35,551 --> 00:57:35,731
no,

1733
00:57:35,731 --> 00:57:36,660
I'm going to turn it on.

1734
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:39,240
And so he turns it on and uh,

1735
00:57:39,241 --> 00:57:39,511
we're,

1736
00:57:39,511 --> 00:57:42,600
we're seeing the clouds dissipate
fairly rapidly and we're like,

1737
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:43,170
hmm,

1738
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:44,100
this is interesting.

1739
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:46,290
The clouds have dissipated fairly rapidly.

1740
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:49,800
But then we noticed this motherfuckers
got a crack in the door so the clouds are

1741
00:57:49,801 --> 00:57:50,970
sneaking out of his door.

1742
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:51,660
Okay.

1743
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,490
So now we take over
the cracks of the door.

1744
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:54,503
We turn it on again.

1745
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:55,200
Now this,

1746
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,520
it doesn't dissipate at all.

1747
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:56,750
Right.

1748
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:57,930
It's just sort of hovers there.

1749
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:00,750
But there's some weird
funnels like coming off of it.

1750
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:01,320
Well,

1751
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,940
it does seem to have an effect.

1752
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:05,910
Well then we opened the door
and touch it and it's hot.

1753
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:11,370
So this stupid machine that he claims
is changing the ionosphere and the tube

1754
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,950
and then making the weather manipulate.

1755
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:15,443
It's just hot.

1756
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,660
It's just a big stupid hot electrical box.

1757
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,130
And when it gives off heat,

1758
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,760
heat rises and it,

1759
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:22,681
you know,

1760
00:58:22,681 --> 00:58:24,840
it goes through this stupid fake clouds.

1761
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:26,820
So nothing so not,

1762
00:58:26,821 --> 00:58:27,930
but here's what's crazy.

1763
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,720
Not only did this guy thought this,

1764
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:36,230
but that this guy thought this enough
to build a machine and that he did this

1765
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:37,231
and said,

1766
00:58:37,231 --> 00:58:38,190
this is so good.

1767
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,720
It needs to be on TV.

1768
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,740
Yeah,

1769
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:41,701
that's fun though.

1770
00:58:41,701 --> 00:58:42,534
Going crazy.

1771
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,660
I'd love to go that crazy.

1772
00:58:45,661 --> 00:58:47,520
Do you know how fun that would be?

1773
00:58:47,521 --> 00:58:50,630
Seriously constructing a
weather machine in your house?

1774
00:58:50,631 --> 00:58:51,180
Yeah.

1775
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,560
That will be a blast.

1776
00:58:52,561 --> 00:58:55,560
So he's enjoying life and he somehow his,

1777
00:58:55,561 --> 00:58:57,810
whether machines summoned the TV crew

1778
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,350
and you know what's really crazy magic.

1779
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:00,393
He's a white guy.

1780
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:02,141
Hello?

1781
00:59:02,141 --> 00:59:03,120
Who'd a thought it's,

1782
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:08,230
you never see white guys
with these unfounded claims.

1783
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:13,150
It's a really rare that you see a bunch
of white guys in their late forties

1784
00:59:13,151 --> 00:59:17,560
early fifties possibly into their
sixties hosts divorce or post divorce,

1785
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,830
just eaten alive by depression.

1786
00:59:20,831 --> 00:59:21,664
Like,

1787
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:22,400
yeah.

1788
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:22,950
You know,

1789
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:27,240
waking up and spitting out pieces of
their teeth from grinding all night long

1790
00:59:27,241 --> 00:59:31,050
and then going to work on your weather
machine is your tears disrupt your

1791
00:59:31,051 --> 00:59:35,040
experiment when you contemplate how your
wife left you because you wouldn't stop

1792
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:36,030
talking about harp.

1793
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:40,760
And then you call your friend over the
Tarion who knows a dude who actually is

1794
00:59:40,761 --> 00:59:42,050
an heir at Terrion.

1795
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:44,600
Just each air doesn't have water,

1796
00:59:44,601 --> 00:59:46,610
doesn't have food that makes sense to you.

1797
00:59:46,611 --> 00:59:49,010
This is the guys hanging out
at your house and you go,

1798
00:59:49,011 --> 00:59:50,600
what do you think you to
help me put this together?

1799
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:52,310
I think you're onto some amazing work.

1800
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:52,971
Amazing.

1801
00:59:52,971 --> 00:59:54,020
You're doing amazing work.

1802
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,270
So they put together this stupid
thing and it doesn't work.

1803
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:56,940
And,

1804
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:58,310
and you flew out to that?

1805
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:58,761
No,

1806
00:59:58,761 --> 00:59:59,210
I drove.

1807
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:00,043
This was an,

1808
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,550
luckily it was in California,

1809
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,410
but not only did we drive,

1810
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,640
but this is how stupid we are.

1811
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,230
The Guy said there was a mistake
with the experiment we want.

1812
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,113
He wants to do it again.

1813
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,340
So he had them do it again.

1814
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:10,901
So the,

1815
01:00:10,901 --> 01:00:12,920
the camera crew went back a second time.

1816
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,510
And guess what happened the second time?

1817
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:17,300
Fucking nothing happened.

1818
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:18,111
Nothing happened.

1819
01:00:18,111 --> 01:00:18,921
Nothing's going to happen.

1820
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:20,030
You knew nothing was going to happen.

1821
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:21,980
You wanted the camera back again like you,

1822
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:26,090
this guy probably has seen the secret
like a thousand times and he thinks that

1823
01:00:26,091 --> 01:00:28,580
if he really truly believes
that this is a weather machine,

1824
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:29,780
then it becomes a weather machine.

1825
01:00:29,781 --> 01:00:30,170
Yeah.

1826
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:30,920
Or something.

1827
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,670
By the way,

1828
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,350
the next season of this show,

1829
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,260
you are going to be riddled with trolls.

1830
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:38,660
Who realized that you guys
will come out to anything.

1831
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:40,423
It's too late.

1832
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:41,961
What do you do?

1833
01:00:41,961 --> 01:00:45,500
Just email the Scifi channel and
Joe Rogan shows up at your house.

1834
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:47,120
If you've farted in a box.

1835
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:47,631
Dude,

1836
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:48,950
it's way too late for that.

1837
01:00:48,951 --> 01:00:51,320
Did you see the photo that
I tweeted yesterday of me,

1838
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:51,820
uh,

1839
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:55,100
with this stupid fucking
apparatus on my head?

1840
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:59,330
Cause some asshole claims that this
stupid apparatus was going to uh,

1841
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,860
detect electricity that
comes off of my eyeballs.

1842
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:04,430
Look at this.

1843
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:04,701
This,

1844
01:01:04,701 --> 01:01:06,350
this fuck had gotten me to where this,

1845
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:07,820
this guy got me to wear this.

1846
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:12,860
And inside this thing does goggle
inside the goggle is like a sensor.

1847
01:01:12,861 --> 01:01:15,800
And the sensor reads the electricity
coming off your eyeballs.

1848
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:19,340
So he's talking to all these scientific
terms and he's got a degree in Canada.

1849
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,860
And so he tells me he's,

1850
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:26,330
he tells me that this device measures
of the electricity coming off your

1851
01:01:26,331 --> 01:01:30,230
eyeballs and that theoretically you could
feel this electricity on the back of

1852
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:34,730
your head scientifically explaining the
psychic phenomenon that a lot of people

1853
01:01:34,731 --> 01:01:35,301
believe in,

1854
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:38,540
which is that people can tell when people
are looking at the back of their head.

1855
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,500
So this fuck head gets me
to put on this stupid thing.

1856
01:01:42,501 --> 01:01:44,180
I got glue all over my head.

1857
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:47,060
Lucky I'm bald because then
I just have to clean my head.

1858
01:01:47,061 --> 01:01:47,960
If that was in my hair,

1859
01:01:47,961 --> 01:01:48,800
I'd be pissed.

1860
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:52,610
Especially if had some beautiful like
Joey Lawrence and the nineties hair,

1861
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,990
just something flowing,

1862
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:54,831
you know,

1863
01:01:54,831 --> 01:01:56,060
and then saw this gooey shit.

1864
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:57,283
A boy can dream.

1865
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:57,741
So anyway,

1866
01:01:57,741 --> 01:02:02,120
I got these goggles on and the goggles
have a sensor in and he shows me that on

1867
01:02:02,121 --> 01:02:02,990
this EKG.

1868
01:02:02,991 --> 01:02:04,220
So what it's called Eeg,

1869
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:04,610
Kanji,

1870
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:05,443
whatever it's called.

1871
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:06,950
He shows me EEG.

1872
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:08,390
Electroencephalogram.

1873
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:08,930
Yeah.

1874
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:13,930
He shows me on this computer that the e
g f set up is reading all the electrodes

1875
01:02:16,491 --> 01:02:17,210
on my head,

1876
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:20,400
but also reading the one
that's in front of my eye.

1877
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:23,010
And then it's a very similar signal,

1878
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:26,970
thus indicating that electricity
is coming off of your eyeball,

1879
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:29,640
like the evil eye in scientific form.

1880
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:30,503
So,

1881
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,170
so,

1882
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:31,471
um,

1883
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:32,060
I say,

1884
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:32,520
hmm.

1885
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,470
So I look at his test and I go,

1886
01:02:34,471 --> 01:02:36,420
did you ever try just
putting it on your hand?

1887
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:41,730
And then I just put it on my
hand and it's the same thing,

1888
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:44,100
this same signal.

1889
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:47,640
And the only time it's not the same
signal is when it's shaking because I'm

1890
01:02:47,641 --> 01:02:47,881
going,

1891
01:02:47,881 --> 01:02:52,881
it's the same fucking signal you made
me put glue on my head and I'm holding

1892
01:02:53,641 --> 01:02:58,050
your wacky space goggles that you
think can measure eyeball raise.

1893
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,300
You'll fuck head look
what you've done to me.

1894
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:01,260
I'm mad.

1895
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:01,951
And I said to him,

1896
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:02,221
I said,

1897
01:03:02,221 --> 01:03:03,590
how did you get again,

1898
01:03:03,591 --> 01:03:04,160
same thing.

1899
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,700
How did you get on TV with this?

1900
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:07,800
How did it Kinda does and how has this,

1901
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,220
not just a dumb idea that you fucked
around with with your friends,

1902
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:14,460
but you got so far that you
went to her producer and said,

1903
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:15,600
well this is what I can do.

1904
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:16,410
And he went,

1905
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:17,640
I like your Moxie.

1906
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,590
I think this is going to really happen.

1907
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:23,520
I think this is going to be an amazing
segment once they show that you are

1908
01:03:23,521 --> 01:03:28,230
correct and that you can shoot raise from
your eyes and then I can detect this,

1909
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,820
oh this is going to be fantastic stuff.

1910
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,190
You could probably be on
Doctor Oz after this show.

1911
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,053
Wow.

1912
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:33,541
But no,

1913
01:03:33,541 --> 01:03:38,541
it's just another white dude with
unfounded claims in his 50s and access to

1914
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,290
aluminum foil.

1915
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,380
He had aluminum foil and head glue.

1916
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:48,360
Has anybody looked into the correlation
between starting to like aluminum foil

1917
01:03:48,361 --> 01:03:49,280
and going insane?

1918
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:52,410
It's like cats they make out of,

1919
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:56,460
I mean that's literally wear tinfoil
hat theory came from somewhere along the

1920
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:56,761
lines.

1921
01:03:56,761 --> 01:03:59,190
So many fuckheads had tin foil hats on,

1922
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:01,740
but people actually came
up with that expression.

1923
01:04:01,741 --> 01:04:03,120
Like if you say that expression,

1924
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:04,620
the tin foil hat brigade,

1925
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,330
people know exactly what you're saying.

1926
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,040
You don't have to say conspiracy theorist.

1927
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:08,491
He say,

1928
01:04:08,491 --> 01:04:08,611
oh,

1929
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,700
he's one of those tin foil
hat wearing motherfuckers,

1930
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:13,050
and then the conversation's over.

1931
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:16,230
If you aren't using
aluminum foil for cooking,

1932
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:19,020
there's a 15% chance
you've gotten and saying,

1933
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:22,740
what is,

1934
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,000
what is it about aluminum?

1935
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:26,580
And that's the shift that
people look forward to.

1936
01:04:27,070 --> 01:04:27,310
It's,

1937
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:28,030
yeah.

1938
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:31,200
I can show people that always
claiming this plane aluminum.

1939
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:33,240
It's all aluminum with these guys.

1940
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:40,710
You know what's crazy is the
ground is mostly aluminum.

1941
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:43,740
A lot of God damn aluminum up there.

1942
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:45,810
Apparently it's super cheap.

1943
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:46,883
Jamaica

1944
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,590
is a source of aluminum.

1945
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:51,060
Jamaica is a source of aluminum.

1946
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:52,120
Yeah.

1947
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:52,560
They put,

1948
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:52,711
well,

1949
01:04:52,711 --> 01:04:54,990
it's apparently according to scientists,

1950
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,810
it's one of the most common
minerals known to man.

1951
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,300
It's also what you put into an apple.

1952
01:05:00,301 --> 01:05:01,560
If you've lost your pipe,

1953
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:04,020
you can smoke weed from
an apple on aluminum foil.

1954
01:05:04,021 --> 01:05:05,190
Aluminum foil pipes.

1955
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:05,851
Yeah.

1956
01:05:05,851 --> 01:05:06,690
That's the foil though,

1957
01:05:06,691 --> 01:05:07,524
buddy.

1958
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,371
It's not the same thing.

1959
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:09,600
It's a mineral that's in the ground.

1960
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:11,110
You're talking nothing crazy.

1961
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:12,990
Foil isn't made of aluminum.

1962
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:13,561
Yes,

1963
01:05:13,561 --> 01:05:14,311
it's made of aluminum.

1964
01:05:14,311 --> 01:05:16,760
I don't want to talk about it
too long or we'll both go insane.

1965
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:19,030
If it's aluminum foil,

1966
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:22,840
just aluminum or does it have anything
else that's mixed into it and heat it

1967
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:23,674
down?

1968
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:26,940
It's kind of fascinating that they can
make metal that you can just repeat here

1969
01:05:27,150 --> 01:05:29,290
is the downwards slippery slope.

1970
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:30,340
Well it's kind of cool.

1971
01:05:30,341 --> 01:05:31,390
Aluminum foil is cool.

1972
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:34,180
Like you could take an ass hole and
you could wrap that apple up in it.

1973
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,290
Like did you take a piece of food and
wrap it up in the internet or a friend?

1974
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:38,380
Turn her under an android.

1975
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:41,530
Don't do that because chicks are always
going to think that you really want an

1976
01:05:41,531 --> 01:05:43,420
android and then we're
going to make them insecure.

1977
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:45,490
I do it to ever make a
girl do dress up bro.

1978
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:46,990
Who says

1979
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:51,520
like,

1980
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:53,620
I tried to take away your
favorite thing in life.

1981
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:54,431
Go like,

1982
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,330
who the fuck are you?

1983
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:04,630
It's like saying never
put salt on French fries.

1984
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,280
How far do you take dress up though?

1985
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:07,660
Do you take it all the way to furry?

1986
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:09,760
Like at a certain point in time?

1987
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:10,330
It's weird.

1988
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:13,000
Like there's a certain amount of dress
up and this society that we allow,

1989
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:16,420
like you're allowed to wear a toupee
through the metal detector at the airport,

1990
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:19,540
but they will make you take
off a fake beard if you have,

1991
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:23,260
like if you've walked through and you've
got to look at Abraham Lincoln beer

1992
01:06:23,261 --> 01:06:26,410
with a chin strap and they're looking
at you like we can get this motherfucker

1993
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:27,340
this,

1994
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:27,920
you know,

1995
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,570
like a little tie behind your head.

1996
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:30,850
A big stupid fake beard.

1997
01:06:30,851 --> 01:06:31,121
They're like,

1998
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:32,110
you have to take that officer.

1999
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:37,890
They'll allow you to wear a toupee if as
long as it's like pinned down somehow.

2000
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:38,321
Oh,

2001
01:06:38,321 --> 01:06:40,210
once how K to finds out about that.

2002
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:43,000
They know now it's over.

2003
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:45,010
There's a certain amount of dress
up that you're allowed to do.

2004
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:45,820
Sure.

2005
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:46,091
Right.

2006
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:47,680
So you are allowed to wear a ball gag,

2007
01:06:47,681 --> 01:06:49,120
but you can't dress like a mascot.

2008
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:50,980
You know I'm not,

2009
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:52,120
I'm not against of,

2010
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:56,650
but I'm saying you can't
be a furry me know anybody.

2011
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:57,880
If you're a furry,

2012
01:06:57,881 --> 01:06:59,620
if you'd like dressing up like a mascot,

2013
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:01,990
open up the front hatch and
having sex with each other,

2014
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:03,160
you fucking crazy.

2015
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:03,820
Right.

2016
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,650
If you're someone who likes to dress up,

2017
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:08,140
like a girl likes to wear leather
or she likes you to tie her up,

2018
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,160
she's just a freak.

2019
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,190
But if she wants to dress like bugs
bunny and she wants you to come and her

2020
01:07:12,191 --> 01:07:12,970
face,

2021
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:13,803
that's crazy.

2022
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:15,130
That's a friend.

2023
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:20,663
Yeah.

2024
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:22,780
What is,

2025
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:25,210
what are the fuck is the
furry thing with the mascot?

2026
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:25,631
I don't know.

2027
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:26,080
That is,

2028
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:29,950
that is really creepy in the furry
stuff I can kind of understand,

2029
01:07:29,951 --> 01:07:34,951
but like it's when people are like
putting like holes into their e or stuffed

2030
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:38,410
animals and fucking them
where stuff gets weird.

2031
01:07:38,510 --> 01:07:38,860
Yeah.

2032
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:40,240
That gets really weird.

2033
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:42,520
Like a fleshlight in the
giant Barney the dinosaur.

2034
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:45,730
Thank you so much for tuning
in to Joe Rogan questions,

2035
01:07:45,731 --> 01:07:46,181
everything.

2036
01:07:46,181 --> 01:07:47,440
We're going to cut to commercial.

2037
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:47,801
Well,

2038
01:07:47,801 --> 01:07:49,630
this is going to be
released as a podcast too.

2039
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:50,583
That's what we're doing.

2040
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:54,630
We're taking an audio form of this and
we're going to put it out as a podcast so

2041
01:07:54,631 --> 01:07:55,300
it's,

2042
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:55,720
there's no,

2043
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,830
nothing will be lost here.

2044
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:57,281
Oh,

2045
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:58,040
that's exciting.

2046
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:58,873
Yeah.

2047
01:07:59,320 --> 01:07:59,591
Great.

2048
01:07:59,591 --> 01:08:04,591
If TV was advanced enough to recognize
that no one's being offended anymore by

2049
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:05,833
anything.

2050
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:06,761
Yeah.

2051
01:08:06,761 --> 01:08:07,450
Right.

2052
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,190
At a certain point in
time they would have to,

2053
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:09,491
well,

2054
01:08:09,491 --> 01:08:11,440
they have to accept that when podcasts,

2055
01:08:11,441 --> 01:08:14,890
I'd having the same exact commercials
and they're pretty close is television

2056
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:16,010
then they're going

2057
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:16,843
to have to accept that.

2058
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:17,330
Yes,

2059
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:17,871
that's right.

2060
01:08:17,871 --> 01:08:18,111
Yeah.

2061
01:08:18,111 --> 01:08:18,241
And,

2062
01:08:18,241 --> 01:08:18,850
and I,

2063
01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:19,130
I,

2064
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:20,810
I can't wait for African
Mama in their hand.

2065
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:20,961
You know,

2066
01:08:20,961 --> 01:08:21,321
I just,

2067
01:08:21,321 --> 01:08:21,950
uh,

2068
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:24,680
heard Al Madrigal actually,

2069
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:25,220
uh,

2070
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,240
did this interviewer,

2071
01:08:26,241 --> 01:08:29,840
they asked him what his least favorite
song was and he said that Macklemore song

2072
01:08:29,841 --> 01:08:31,790
about thrift shops and he said,

2073
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:32,990
the reason is like,

2074
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:38,250
it's like having to explain to your
daughter what jizzing is or what,

2075
01:08:40,341 --> 01:08:40,821
you know what I mean?

2076
01:08:40,821 --> 01:08:43,700
Like when your kids listen to it or
like there's apparently a song in the

2077
01:08:43,701 --> 01:08:45,700
Macklemore's song about pissing on,

2078
01:08:45,701 --> 01:08:46,190
uh,

2079
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:46,661
what's is it,

2080
01:08:46,661 --> 01:08:47,351
who's the rapper?

2081
01:08:47,351 --> 01:08:48,710
He pissed on the 15 year old.

2082
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:49,603
I have no idea.

2083
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:50,750
Kelly R.

2084
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:50,751
Kelly.

2085
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:54,230
There's apparently some reference to
our Kelly and the song and magical is

2086
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:58,970
pointing out how like it puts you in a
weird place when your kid is asking who

2087
01:08:58,971 --> 01:09:03,860
are Kelly is and why they're talking
about him pissing his bed or what?

2088
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:04,171
Well,

2089
01:09:04,171 --> 01:09:04,680
why?

2090
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:05,640
That's ridiculous.

2091
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:07,860
Why is he playing that kind of
music around his fucking kid?

2092
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,341
His kids.

2093
01:09:08,341 --> 01:09:09,174
Kids love it.

2094
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,240
Kids listened to that.

2095
01:09:10,241 --> 01:09:11,130
How old are his kids?

2096
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:13,860
I don't know if they're young.

2097
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,840
If they're under 15 they're young.

2098
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:16,973
That's rude.

2099
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,110
Well I think kids can get to this music.

2100
01:09:19,111 --> 01:09:19,890
It's not like you're,

2101
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:20,910
you're playing it for them.

2102
01:09:20,911 --> 01:09:22,040
It's like they find it.

2103
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:22,980
They find it online.

2104
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:23,291
Yeah.

2105
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:23,650
Like,

2106
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:23,990
like,

2107
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:24,690
like my,

2108
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:25,860
your dad's porn.

2109
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:26,220
Right.

2110
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:27,690
It's not like your dad's like come here,

2111
01:09:27,691 --> 01:09:28,920
look at this pussy.

2112
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:30,780
It's like you found the porn.

2113
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:31,590
Right.

2114
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:33,450
So kids find that's a PR.

2115
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,190
I mean I think his point.

2116
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:38,580
What apps to a strip club w with
thrift shops would that have to do with

2117
01:09:38,581 --> 01:09:39,414
sheriff's house?

2118
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:40,080
What do you mean?

2119
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:40,751
That's the name of the song.

2120
01:09:40,751 --> 01:09:41,850
The name and the name of the songs.

2121
01:09:41,851 --> 01:09:42,684
Thrift shop.

2122
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:43,111
It's just,

2123
01:09:43,111 --> 01:09:44,100
he made the point he made that.

2124
01:09:44,101 --> 01:09:45,150
I thought it was interesting.

2125
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:45,721
It's like,

2126
01:09:45,721 --> 01:09:46,021
yeah,

2127
01:09:46,021 --> 01:09:49,920
I guess if I had kids it would put me
in a weird predicament if I'm always

2128
01:09:49,921 --> 01:09:54,540
having to explain to them like adult
concepts cause I have to either decide

2129
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:57,870
between lying to them or
like telling them the truth.

2130
01:09:57,871 --> 01:10:00,270
And that's a weird place
to get into with a kid

2131
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:05,000
and the now in 2013 that's not really
necessary anymore because by the time a

2132
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:06,680
kid gets to be 13 years old,

2133
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:06,950
right,

2134
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:07,730
they've seen it all.

2135
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:08,270
Yes.

2136
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:09,380
That's true to me.

2137
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:12,560
Remember how much shit you saw
that your parents had no idea.

2138
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:14,900
Like did you ever see any
like faces of death stuff?

2139
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:15,300
Yeah,

2140
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:15,730
yeah.

2141
01:10:15,730 --> 01:10:16,040
Yes,

2142
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:16,610
for sure.

2143
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:16,851
Yeah.

2144
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:19,290
I mean we saw a lot of shit that you,

2145
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:19,820
you didn't,

2146
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:22,070
no one ever saw before us.

2147
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:22,600
Well yeah,

2148
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:22,901
right.

2149
01:10:22,901 --> 01:10:23,681
But we never see,

2150
01:10:23,681 --> 01:10:25,880
I mean the stuff that kids
are seeing now is just,

2151
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,490
yeah,

2152
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:29,700
we were the first generation c we
were the first people with VCRs.

2153
01:10:29,890 --> 01:10:30,410
See our,

2154
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:31,350
our family,

2155
01:10:31,351 --> 01:10:34,560
like our parents did
not grow up with VCRs.

2156
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:34,950
Right.

2157
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:36,060
So when they grew up,

2158
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,840
either saw something on TV or you didn't
and you didn't get to see it again.

2159
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:40,500
If you don't,

2160
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:42,630
the only time you saw it again as if they
played it again and they never played

2161
01:10:42,631 --> 01:10:43,464
anything again.

2162
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:46,500
They'd played a few movies like every
now and then they'll take King Kong is

2163
01:10:46,501 --> 01:10:47,191
going to be on again.

2164
01:10:47,191 --> 01:10:48,690
You'd know when you'd wait for it.

2165
01:10:48,691 --> 01:10:48,930
Right.

2166
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:50,730
They have to watch it as it was happening.

2167
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:56,360
So our generation was the first
generation that had tapes and we would get

2168
01:10:56,491 --> 01:11:00,030
something and stick it in something
and press play when we wanted.

2169
01:11:00,031 --> 01:11:01,660
So we were the first people to,

2170
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:05,610
to take that next level
information thing and right.

2171
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:10,690
And what did we do with it faces a death
barnyard Betty like some of the most

2172
01:11:10,951 --> 01:11:12,600
fucked up heinous things ever.

2173
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:14,040
Like within a few years

2174
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,480
of making VHS tapes,

2175
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,590
they had a whole series of faces of
death and that's when the UFC came out.

2176
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:22,460
And like all these different
things like the early UFC is,

2177
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:23,031
we're like that.

2178
01:11:23,031 --> 01:11:25,830
Like a lot of people thought that was
what you were watching wasn't a martial

2179
01:11:25,831 --> 01:11:26,250
art.

2180
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:29,340
They thought what you were watching
was just like some faces of death type

2181
01:11:29,341 --> 01:11:29,581
thing.

2182
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:29,731
Like,

2183
01:11:29,731 --> 01:11:30,131
oh my God,

2184
01:11:30,131 --> 01:11:31,130
but watching cage fighting.

2185
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:31,973
This is crazy.

2186
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,660
It became a martial arts.

2187
01:11:33,710 --> 01:11:33,960
Sure.

2188
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:34,401
Beginning.

2189
01:11:34,401 --> 01:11:36,060
It was like more of a
freak show than anything.

2190
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:36,750
Yup,

2191
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,800
but the kids today,

2192
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:38,760
that's a,

2193
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:39,593
that's a joke.

2194
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:40,201
The kids today,

2195
01:11:40,201 --> 01:11:41,100
like a beheading.

2196
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:42,121
What is that?

2197
01:11:42,121 --> 01:11:44,400
That's another thing I heard
that foreign yard Betty

2198
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:45,720
for teenagers,

2199
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:48,480
anal sex is second base.

2200
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:51,060
Like they're fucking each other in the ass

2201
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:53,250
soul before they're having vaginal sex.

2202
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,080
No.

2203
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:54,600
Yeah.

2204
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,100
That's like a night of making out.

2205
01:11:56,101 --> 01:11:58,800
You probably end up sticking
your cock and a girl's ass.

2206
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:00,983
No.

2207
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:05,540
[inaudible] are you doing this and what
it on a chat room or is this is when it,

2208
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,050
whenever someone says to me,

2209
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,850
the teenage kids,

2210
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,200
whenever someone says to me,

2211
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:12,750
teenage kids are having
more anal sex than ever.

2212
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:13,021
Yeah.

2213
01:12:13,021 --> 01:12:13,854
I always say,

2214
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:18,850
why you even research and teenage
kids and angels and anal sex like,

2215
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:19,050
oh,

2216
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:21,120
let me Google search history.

2217
01:12:22,830 --> 01:12:23,490
Five years.

2218
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:24,750
I didn't pop up once.

2219
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:27,390
Ain't kids and anal sex kids.

2220
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:28,890
Only if we had this conversation.

2221
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:30,390
Teenagers and anal sex.

2222
01:12:30,391 --> 01:12:31,224
Those are kids.

2223
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:33,920
If you Google search
anal sex teen right now,

2224
01:12:33,921 --> 01:12:36,320
you will get more results
than moon landing.

2225
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:46,420
I think they mean like 18 and 19 but
that's not what you mean when you're

2226
01:12:46,431 --> 01:12:47,780
talking about kids.

2227
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,010
We're not talking about porn.

2228
01:12:49,011 --> 01:12:50,290
You're talking about kids and having sex.

2229
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,410
Here's a real shocker.

2230
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:53,720
14 high school.

2231
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:57,050
Let me just send a bolt of
terror through the country.

2232
01:12:57,051 --> 01:12:58,490
Kids are fucking in highschool.

2233
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,840
Guys knows I did.

2234
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,400
You people are not ready for this.

2235
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:03,980
You should slowly work this in.

2236
01:13:03,981 --> 01:13:04,550
Yeah.

2237
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:05,720
You shouldn't just say,

2238
01:13:05,721 --> 01:13:06,171
Hey,

2239
01:13:06,171 --> 01:13:06,651
guess what?

2240
01:13:06,651 --> 01:13:07,520
Your kids are fucking,

2241
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,110
what if someone's been in denial?

2242
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,550
What have they just been in denial?

2243
01:13:10,551 --> 01:13:14,300
Just Holman Christian songs as they walk
around the house thinking the kids at

2244
01:13:14,301 --> 01:13:14,661
school,

2245
01:13:14,661 --> 01:13:15,494
just learning.

2246
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:16,131
Meanwhile,

2247
01:13:16,131 --> 01:13:19,460
she's just someone's balls deep in
her ass and a dumpster right now.

2248
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:19,940
Yeah,

2249
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:21,740
they're hide behind a cardboard box.

2250
01:13:21,741 --> 01:13:23,330
She's getting fucked so hard.

2251
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:26,180
She's using telekinetic to like live cars

2252
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:35,570
and that sound is the Windsor
hum is filling the sky.

2253
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,940
Oh.

2254
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:40,740
Oh.

2255
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:42,910
Her eyes are rolled behind her head.

2256
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,190
She's squirting.

2257
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:49,300
Oh

2258
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:50,433
yeah,

2259
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,670
whoa.

2260
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:55,050
Got squatch all over go watch.

2261
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:56,040
Yeah,

2262
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,590
well that happens man.

2263
01:13:58,591 --> 01:13:59,371
Kids are fucking,

2264
01:13:59,371 --> 01:14:02,370
my mom bought me a box of condoms
and now he's in the 10th grade.

2265
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:05,070
She gave me a box of condoms cause
she knew I was going to be fucking,

2266
01:14:05,071 --> 01:14:05,820
she's like,

2267
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,140
just wear these condoms.

2268
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,970
She'd seen my girlfriend.

2269
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,160
Well she knew your
girlfriend was a dirty girl.

2270
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,310
Not just dirty,

2271
01:14:12,311 --> 01:14:14,950
but like albino is like swampy.

2272
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,030
Like she was like that.

2273
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:17,070
You should have to wear it.

2274
01:14:17,110 --> 01:14:17,943
Come on now.

2275
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:20,321
I know.

2276
01:14:20,321 --> 01:14:21,154
In the swamp.

2277
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,980
That was your first girlfriend.

2278
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:24,460
Holy Shit.

2279
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,200
Oh my God.

2280
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:28,450
Oh my God.

2281
01:14:28,451 --> 01:14:30,070
Albino and swell.

2282
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:31,900
That sounds like a Stephen Lynch movie.

2283
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:33,310
David David Lynch.

2284
01:14:33,311 --> 01:14:34,330
Stephen Lynch is a singer.

2285
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:35,373
Ah,

2286
01:14:39,370 --> 01:14:40,480
that is a David Lynch.

2287
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:43,820
Movio translucent skin blue vein.

2288
01:14:43,821 --> 01:14:44,141
Listen,

2289
01:14:44,141 --> 01:14:44,920
a swamp.

2290
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:45,570
Blue van.

2291
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:48,850
[inaudible] long cliteracy you don't
know whether you say something or not

2292
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:52,040
that's going to deal with this.

2293
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:53,380
It's just,

2294
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:53,820
it's not

2295
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:54,720
quite a finger,

2296
01:14:54,721 --> 01:14:58,890
but I mean it's definitely a finger
that's been bitten off like a nub.

2297
01:14:59,130 --> 01:14:59,940
It's enough.

2298
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:01,140
I wouldn't say it's a finger.

2299
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:03,600
It's like a finger that lost a bar fight.

2300
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:07,110
When do you talk about the
length of a girl's clutter?

2301
01:15:07,111 --> 01:15:10,470
It's like what do you think immediately
after you get done fucking her to your

2302
01:15:10,471 --> 01:15:11,150
friends?

2303
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:11,940
I mean if it's,

2304
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,230
it depends on how big it is.

2305
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:14,580
If it's totally normal,

2306
01:15:14,581 --> 01:15:15,414
it never comes up.

2307
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:16,740
Yeah,

2308
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:16,981
I,

2309
01:15:16,981 --> 01:15:17,814
you know,

2310
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:20,580
I've never discussed the length
of my life by my wife's cliteracy.

2311
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:21,840
You should totally normal.

2312
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:22,853
I'll tell you right now,

2313
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:23,910
there's nothing special about it.

2314
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:26,130
It's a regular vagina.

2315
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:26,993
It looks great.

2316
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:27,990
It's awesome.

2317
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:28,771
Great good design.

2318
01:15:28,771 --> 01:15:29,610
You don't need to fuck with it.

2319
01:15:29,611 --> 01:15:30,720
It doesn't need pin stripes,

2320
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:31,943
but the,

2321
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:33,390
the crazy ones,

2322
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:34,740
the ones that are weird,

2323
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:38,730
it's like what is that like why is there
an evolutionary advantage for looking

2324
01:15:38,731 --> 01:15:40,320
like a Mousse with a gunshot hole in it?

2325
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:41,890
Oh his.

2326
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,500
What is it about?

2327
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:48,180
Is it about some of them

2328
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:50,030
that vary so widely,

2329
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,130
but at least with a woman like it doesn't,

2330
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:57,110
I don't think they vary so much and
well I guess they do vary in size,

2331
01:15:57,350 --> 01:16:01,480
but it doesn't have any like social
stigma attached to it and in fact have a

2332
01:16:01,481 --> 01:16:02,190
girl has a,

2333
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:07,190
a very small and a welcoming tight little
area that's probably better than a big

2334
01:16:08,031 --> 01:16:09,470
crazy loose thing.

2335
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:12,590
So it works the opposite for
them than it does for us.

2336
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:13,280
For us,

2337
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:16,160
it's as evolutionary advantage
to have a large penis.

2338
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:18,200
I see what you're big Rasputin looking.

2339
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,090
We looked at Rasputin's yesterday.

2340
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,350
We were looking at it.

2341
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:21,740
Oh yeah,

2342
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:24,320
I've seen Rasputin's cock jar.

2343
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:29,370
I heard his story that Rasputin was at a
bar and telling people that he was rice

2344
01:16:29,610 --> 01:16:31,070
Buton and they're like,

2345
01:16:31,071 --> 01:16:31,491
whatever,

2346
01:16:31,491 --> 01:16:32,210
you're not recipe it.

2347
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:33,043
And he's like,

2348
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:34,610
I'll show you I'm fucking recipe.

2349
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:38,230
And then he like pulls his job
tree trunk cock out and like,

2350
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:38,391
yeah,

2351
01:16:38,391 --> 01:16:38,960
you're,

2352
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:40,610
you're Rasputin it's in a jar.

2353
01:16:40,611 --> 01:16:41,840
It's 11 inches soft.

2354
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:42,950
It's a big jar too.

2355
01:16:42,951 --> 01:16:46,400
It's like that would not fit in
a regular mayonnaise size jar.

2356
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:47,263
Costco Jar.

2357
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:47,541
Yeah.

2358
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:51,350
He would have to get a Costco Jelly bean
jar if they have a special caulk jar.

2359
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,213
It's just for Cox.

2360
01:16:52,230 --> 01:16:52,541
I said,

2361
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:53,374
yeah,

2362
01:16:53,870 --> 01:16:55,040
but his cock was like,

2363
01:16:55,041 --> 01:16:55,874
that is a,

2364
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,850
that caucus is a bad thing.

2365
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,140
Like it didn't,

2366
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:02,840
that cock is a um,

2367
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:04,093
uh,

2368
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,000
a death hammer.

2369
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:10,030
Like that's a thing that you can even
still now it's how ever many years it's

2370
01:17:10,131 --> 01:17:10,821
been in that jar.

2371
01:17:10,821 --> 01:17:12,750
You can still feel evil coming off of it.

2372
01:17:12,751 --> 01:17:13,020
Yeah.

2373
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:14,400
Maybe you can feel evil.

2374
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:15,920
I feel a bunch of player haters,

2375
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:17,430
a chopped off of giant God's Dick.

2376
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:18,391
Oh wait,

2377
01:17:18,391 --> 01:17:22,370
he's just a regular dude with a big deck
slinging dicks are given out bubble gum

2378
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:23,610
and having a great time in Russia,

2379
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:25,260
which by the way sucks.

2380
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,490
It's freezing cold.

2381
01:17:26,491 --> 01:17:27,660
Everyone's an asshole.

2382
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:31,650
They're all the other ass kicked by the
Mongols and then it never recovered.

2383
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:35,820
So they're up there freezing their
dicks off and one guy comes along just

2384
01:17:35,821 --> 01:17:38,850
swinging a monster hog and
having a good old time.

2385
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:44,060
And he hypnotizes all the girls in the
area with his Dick and his Willie ways

2386
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:46,830
and he winds up being a superstar
amongst all of these women,

2387
01:17:46,831 --> 01:17:48,330
including the Zarina,

2388
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:49,710
the czar's wife.

2389
01:17:49,711 --> 01:17:53,130
He was given the fucking King
of the lands wife the Dick.

2390
01:17:53,490 --> 01:17:55,320
That's fuck yeah,

2391
01:17:55,321 --> 01:17:56,154
son.

2392
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:56,701
Yeah,

2393
01:17:56,701 --> 01:17:57,900
he was hanging around all those chicks.

2394
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:00,020
He's one of those dudes
like Arnold Schwarzenegger.

2395
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:00,960
He's hanging around you.

2396
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:01,500
He's fucked

2397
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:01,850
you.

2398
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:02,683
Here's the thing,

2399
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:06,530
you can't cheat with rescued because
like if you're in bed with your wife and

2400
01:18:06,531 --> 01:18:10,260
you look down at her vagina
and it looks like a sink hole,

2401
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,250
like you fuck trus fusion,

2402
01:18:13,251 --> 01:18:17,270
you asshole like you're hit.

2403
01:18:17,271 --> 01:18:20,500
Vaginas would look like craters
after experiencing that.

2404
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:21,500
That this is like,

2405
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:25,490
it's a cock the size of the
width of an encyclopedia.

2406
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:28,800
But regular vaginas have
babies go through them,

2407
01:18:28,801 --> 01:18:33,030
which are much bigger than a cock
and I snap like they snap right back.

2408
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:38,810
If your wife gave birth the next
day when you be able to tell dude,

2409
01:18:39,250 --> 01:18:39,700
yes,

2410
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:41,770
but Rasputin's Dick was not nine pounds.

2411
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,031
I did have,

2412
01:18:43,031 --> 01:18:44,080
these are nine pounds,

2413
01:18:44,081 --> 01:18:44,470
dude.

2414
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:46,270
Vaginas are crazy.

2415
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,104
Oregon's,

2416
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:52,170
they stretch out and pop out a baby
and then snap back shut like a clam.

2417
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,970
They don't snap back shut like I am.

2418
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:57,090
It's a slow snapback.

2419
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:57,460
No,

2420
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:59,560
they stitch up stitch up any tearing.

2421
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:04,240
They snapped back like it's
like a slow congealing.

2422
01:19:04,241 --> 01:19:04,690
Right.

2423
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:05,740
How do you know now?

2424
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:06,940
I've been through it three times.

2425
01:19:06,941 --> 01:19:07,420
Trust me.

2426
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:08,740
My wife's vagina is excellent.

2427
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,680
They stitch that shit up there.

2428
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:12,820
There's some tearing
and I think when they,

2429
01:19:12,821 --> 01:19:13,600
when they stitch it up,

2430
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,120
they have that Benny Hill music plan

2431
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,670
because they know that
you got to do it again.

2432
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:21,850
He's just going to get pregnant again.

2433
01:19:22,030 --> 01:19:23,020
What would that one more time.

2434
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:23,900
All right.

2435
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:24,733
Damn man.

2436
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:29,461
It is weird though.

2437
01:19:29,461 --> 01:19:31,560
How nature did didn't build in the,

2438
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:32,340
uh,

2439
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:33,960
it's weird that that's,

2440
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,460
that there is a tear.

2441
01:19:35,461 --> 01:19:36,480
It's funny that it's,

2442
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:40,560
it's not built so that it just pops a
baby out without there being damaged or

2443
01:19:40,561 --> 01:19:41,100
pain.

2444
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:41,251
Well,

2445
01:19:41,251 --> 01:19:44,430
that's how chimps do you ever see
chimps give birth now pull up,

2446
01:19:44,431 --> 01:19:46,350
see if you could see a chimp giving birth.

2447
01:19:46,351 --> 01:19:46,531
See,

2448
01:19:46,531 --> 01:19:47,490
we've got a video online.

2449
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:51,390
The way chimps give birth as they just
reach in and pull it out and that's it

2450
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:52,303
and they're done.

2451
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:53,780
They just reach in,

2452
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:55,710
pull the baby out,

2453
01:19:55,711 --> 01:19:56,544
put it down,

2454
01:19:56,700 --> 01:20:00,870
clean it off a little bit and they don't
come out helpless either mean obviously

2455
01:20:00,871 --> 01:20:02,400
they need their mother
but they're not like us.

2456
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:05,460
We come out like incredibly
help us for a long time.

2457
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:06,271
We can't even walk,

2458
01:20:06,271 --> 01:20:07,020
we can't do shit.

2459
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,100
We can't even control our own

2460
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:08,461
heads.

2461
01:20:08,461 --> 01:20:09,390
We just fall forward.

2462
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:10,121
We are,

2463
01:20:10,121 --> 01:20:14,340
our heads are so big that we have to
be born like way earlier in the process

2464
01:20:14,341 --> 01:20:18,840
than other animals and our minds are so
complex that the gestation process takes

2465
01:20:18,841 --> 01:20:19,674
a long time here.

2466
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,630
What this that's the baby.

2467
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:25,530
She leans back like
she's in an old school,

2468
01:20:25,531 --> 01:20:30,531
Traci lords movie and she just grabs a
hold of the hair on the baby and she's

2469
01:20:31,441 --> 01:20:33,060
just squeezing it out.

2470
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,820
It doesn't seem like
she's in any pain at all.

2471
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:37,253
And she's,

2472
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:41,010
she just squeezing on her very casual,

2473
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,830
her vagina and a,

2474
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,620
the baby heads is slowly popping out and
she's just trying to figure out when to

2475
01:20:46,621 --> 01:20:49,410
get a grip on it and the males
coming over to check it out.

2476
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:51,180
There's no doctors,

2477
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,890
not a sanitary environment.

2478
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:54,990
I terrible mural,

2479
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:56,850
not a Filipino lady to be seen.

2480
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:00,420
Try going to a hospital
and not seeing a Filipino.

2481
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:01,973
Good luck.

2482
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:02,851
I don't know why,

2483
01:21:02,851 --> 01:21:03,750
but that is true.

2484
01:21:03,930 --> 01:21:05,070
They just make awesome nurses.

2485
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:10,080
They're drawn to hospitals like math and
she's like sitting there while this a

2486
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:11,430
baby's coming out of her body.

2487
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:12,220
It just,

2488
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:12,550
the,

2489
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:17,550
the evolutionary process is so strange
and when you see like a life coming out

2490
01:21:19,471 --> 01:21:20,304
of a life,

2491
01:21:21,330 --> 01:21:22,770
it's one of the weirdest things you get.

2492
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,710
I've seen it several times now.

2493
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:26,573
You know,

2494
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,730
twice in person and it's a,

2495
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,630
it's a trip man.

2496
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:31,673
It's really a trip.

2497
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:34,290
I'm assuming that's her mate,

2498
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,650
but I don't know like the
other ones like watching,

2499
01:21:37,651 --> 01:21:39,060
he's concerned it's insurance.

2500
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:42,270
She's most likely a whore and she
probably fucked every champion the whole

2501
01:21:42,271 --> 01:21:42,580
group.

2502
01:21:42,580 --> 01:21:44,790
But she's just trying to look at this.

2503
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:45,683
Wow.

2504
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:46,440
She's,

2505
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,320
she's just bending over and he's
checking it out now and she's like,

2506
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:49,741
what do you see?

2507
01:21:49,741 --> 01:21:50,370
Flexible.

2508
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:50,641
Yeah.

2509
01:21:50,641 --> 01:21:50,971
She's like,

2510
01:21:50,971 --> 01:21:51,780
what do you think?

2511
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:52,440
Is it ready?

2512
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,960
And he just know,

2513
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:54,983
hmm.

2514
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:56,131
Wow.

2515
01:21:56,131 --> 01:21:56,964
And she's like,

2516
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:58,350
it's so weird.

2517
01:21:58,410 --> 01:21:59,191
Like I'll get it now.

2518
01:21:59,191 --> 01:22:00,420
She's squeezing them out there.

2519
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:00,751
Whoa.

2520
01:22:00,751 --> 01:22:02,880
This is crazy plot.

2521
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:04,810
Oh Damn.

2522
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:06,630
That needs to be an animated Gif file.

2523
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:10,980
Like the moment the baby comes out
and the puddle that creates and the,

2524
01:22:10,981 --> 01:22:11,251
the,

2525
01:22:11,251 --> 01:22:12,850
the male is it?

2526
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,970
Of course she's eating the placenta,

2527
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:15,721
the ether percent there.

2528
01:22:15,721 --> 01:22:16,554
Right away.

2529
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:18,360
I've heard that you should do that.

2530
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:19,500
That is a fucking trip.

2531
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:20,580
That is it.

2532
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:21,413
Such a trip.

2533
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,200
What's really true and so sweet.

2534
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:25,010
They're both licking the little chin.

2535
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,850
What's really a trip is
that chimpanzees are a,

2536
01:22:29,851 --> 01:22:32,610
some sort of a distant relative of us.

2537
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,140
And at one point in time,

2538
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:38,250
our ancient ancient ancestors would
probably very similar to this and that

2539
01:22:38,251 --> 01:22:42,150
something happened and we kept
going and we went from that to this.

2540
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:43,290
Well,

2541
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:44,780
that that seems a lot,

2542
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:49,270
a lot sweeter and more natural
than doing it in some sterile room.

2543
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,880
People wearing weird clothes.

2544
01:22:51,150 --> 01:22:52,410
Well that's not sterile.

2545
01:22:52,411 --> 01:22:53,300
I mean that's not natural.

2546
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:54,061
That was in a zoo,

2547
01:22:54,061 --> 01:22:54,600
dude.

2548
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,040
That was on a slab of concrete.

2549
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:56,730
How,

2550
01:22:56,730 --> 01:22:59,640
how natural is it for a chimp
to give birth on concrete?

2551
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:00,091
Absolutely.

2552
01:23:00,091 --> 01:23:00,924
Right.

2553
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:03,690
I don't know why I said kind of fucked
up about the baby coming out on that hard

2554
01:23:03,691 --> 01:23:04,081
surface.

2555
01:23:04,081 --> 01:23:05,620
Like if they were in jungle,

2556
01:23:05,621 --> 01:23:06,100
the jungle

2557
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:06,910
soft.

2558
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:09,670
It's like when we were in Seattle
looking for big for it to set the ground.

2559
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:09,770
Yeah.

2560
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:10,211
Yeah,

2561
01:23:10,211 --> 01:23:10,610
exactly.

2562
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:11,750
It's very soft.

2563
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:13,820
Like you could shoot out a
kid there with no problem.

2564
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:15,100
Yeah.

2565
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:17,930
If you heard about the father
Zod and the source family,

2566
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:18,793
do you know about this?

2567
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,430
What father's Od and the source
family and the source family?

2568
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:23,331
I can't.

2569
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:26,120
It's a cult and I can't remember
if it's Manson or father's side,

2570
01:23:26,121 --> 01:23:26,841
but in these calls,

2571
01:23:26,841 --> 01:23:27,530
you know the lemon,

2572
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:29,720
of course they give birth
after they get impregnated.

2573
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,470
Right.

2574
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:32,150
And this guy,

2575
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:33,501
as I recall,

2576
01:23:33,501 --> 01:23:34,820
I'm trying to think of it's Manson.

2577
01:23:34,821 --> 01:23:36,320
I got my coat leaders make step.

2578
01:23:36,321 --> 01:23:40,520
I can't remember which one but in one
of these look up father Zod umbilical

2579
01:23:40,521 --> 01:23:41,354
cord,

2580
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:43,260
that classic search

2581
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:47,940
we NSA is knocking on my door as we speak.

2582
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:48,774
Please.

2583
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:50,700
Hmm,

2584
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:51,300
no,

2585
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:51,611
no,

2586
01:23:51,611 --> 01:23:52,860
it's just as documentary where it's,

2587
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:56,580
it was the point is that a woman gave
birth and I can't remember if it's Manson

2588
01:23:56,581 --> 01:23:57,361
her father's out,

2589
01:23:57,361 --> 01:24:02,130
but one of them chewed the umbilical
cord off like bid it bit through.

2590
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:05,130
It is probably your father is odd
cause I never heard that story.

2591
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:05,491
Yeah,

2592
01:24:05,491 --> 01:24:07,470
it's father's Zach because
you'd hear about it with Manson.

2593
01:24:07,471 --> 01:24:08,430
It was father's out,

2594
01:24:08,431 --> 01:24:10,050
but it kind of makes sense.

2595
01:24:10,051 --> 01:24:10,650
You know

2596
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:14,850
now looking at that video of that
chimpanzee given birth on the floor,

2597
01:24:14,910 --> 01:24:16,980
that zoo like seeing that animal,

2598
01:24:16,981 --> 01:24:19,320
how alien that is to you or I,

2599
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,690
but not that much.

2600
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:22,800
I mean it is alien,

2601
01:24:22,801 --> 01:24:23,461
it's an animal.

2602
01:24:23,461 --> 01:24:26,520
But it's kind of human like
and a lot of ways sure.

2603
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:27,241
Aware,

2604
01:24:27,241 --> 01:24:28,080
intelligent,

2605
01:24:28,081 --> 01:24:29,550
paying attention to what's going on,

2606
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:30,331
you know,

2607
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:31,030
and the,

2608
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:33,420
the two arms and two legs thing.

2609
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:33,730
Yeah.

2610
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:34,680
It's so similar.

2611
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:39,720
So it's so strange and it's so strange
to think that somewhere in the past

2612
01:24:39,871 --> 01:24:42,210
that's if you believe in evolution,

2613
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:43,590
which you shouldn't,

2614
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:44,820
which you shouldn't,

2615
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:47,700
but that's somewhere
in the past allegedly,

2616
01:24:47,940 --> 01:24:51,750
we were something like that
and that we were all sort of,

2617
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:52,740
uh,

2618
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:54,990
developing along a similar line.

2619
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:57,120
And one of us became,

2620
01:24:57,121 --> 01:24:57,840
you and I,

2621
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,310
one of us became a Homosapien,

2622
01:24:59,311 --> 01:25:00,090
became a human being.

2623
01:25:00,090 --> 01:25:00,923
Right.

2624
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:03,240
But there's other ones.

2625
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:05,100
This is the Homo Floresiensis,

2626
01:25:05,101 --> 01:25:07,320
that little hobbit man
and the island of Flores.

2627
01:25:07,321 --> 01:25:07,710
Yeah.

2628
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:09,150
There's neanderthal.

2629
01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:12,060
Notice how I said tall
because I'm very educated.

2630
01:25:12,061 --> 01:25:12,840
I thought,

2631
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:13,380
no,

2632
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:16,260
that's the old way I'm current.

2633
01:25:16,290 --> 01:25:16,920
Yeah.

2634
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:17,753
Thank you.

2635
01:25:17,790 --> 01:25:19,560
I how I judge a man by the way.

2636
01:25:19,561 --> 01:25:21,040
He pronounces neanderthals.

2637
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:21,720
You're tall.

2638
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,531
You're kind of an asshole.

2639
01:25:22,531 --> 01:25:23,640
I'm an asshole.

2640
01:25:23,641 --> 01:25:23,820
Yeah.

2641
01:25:23,820 --> 01:25:24,653
That's ridiculous.

2642
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:25,860
That's how I'm Anderson.

2643
01:25:25,861 --> 01:25:28,020
Cooper says neanderthal
because you're right.

2644
01:25:28,021 --> 01:25:28,560
God dammit.

2645
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:29,730
I'm getting neanderthal

2646
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:32,520
southern wrong with that.

2647
01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:33,683
The underdog.

2648
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:34,771
It sounds better.

2649
01:25:34,771 --> 01:25:34,980
Anyway,

2650
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:35,813
over the job

2651
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:36,763
I would have Flores,

2652
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:37,603
ma'am,

2653
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:39,350
it's a three foot tall hobbit man.

2654
01:25:39,351 --> 01:25:42,680
Really fascinating thing that
until a few a few years ago,

2655
01:25:42,681 --> 01:25:44,240
they thought it was just horse shit.

2656
01:25:44,630 --> 01:25:48,170
They really had no idea that 10,000 plus
years ago there was this little tiny

2657
01:25:48,171 --> 01:25:52,100
man running around and running around
the same time there was grown humans like

2658
01:25:52,101 --> 01:25:54,380
you and I like or rather our size.

2659
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:55,983
Um,

2660
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,830
even though we're both short the,

2661
01:25:57,860 --> 01:25:58,520
um,

2662
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,620
the question has always been,

2663
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:01,813
are there others?

2664
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:04,010
And the question always been if

2665
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,761
there were others,

2666
01:26:04,761 --> 01:26:05,930
where the fuck would they be hiding?

2667
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:06,170
Right.

2668
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:06,920
If there's an aisle,

2669
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:07,101
well,

2670
01:26:07,101 --> 01:26:09,740
they didn't find out about gorillas
and to the early 19 hundreds,

2671
01:26:10,130 --> 01:26:10,910
but the deal,

2672
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:13,730
that's sort of a disingenuous
thing to say though,

2673
01:26:13,731 --> 01:26:18,290
because the world of the 19 hundreds
doesn't even remotely resemble the world

2674
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:18,950
that we see today.

2675
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:19,220
Right.

2676
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:20,540
Because the world that we see today,

2677
01:26:20,670 --> 01:26:20,900
we,

2678
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:25,700
we pretty much have a good account of
what's alive in almost every place.

2679
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:26,151
Absolutely.

2680
01:26:26,151 --> 01:26:27,440
Might've missed a few spots.

2681
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:28,700
Like there's some weird shit,

2682
01:26:28,701 --> 01:26:32,180
like every now and then they'll find like
a weird frog and New Guinea or a D in

2683
01:26:32,181 --> 01:26:32,751
Vietnam.

2684
01:26:32,751 --> 01:26:34,220
It's been hiding in the
jungle and they're like,

2685
01:26:34,221 --> 01:26:35,054
whoa.

2686
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:40,240
But where people are not willing to
go is with another intelligent animal.

2687
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:44,360
You could say you found a
previously unknown deer in Vietnam,

2688
01:26:44,361 --> 01:26:45,560
which did happen recently.

2689
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:45,980
Sure.

2690
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:46,731
A couple of years ago.

2691
01:26:46,731 --> 01:26:47,360
In fact,

2692
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,200
big animal,

2693
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:49,760
like a size of a whitetail deer,

2694
01:26:49,761 --> 01:26:52,310
completely different species
they weren't aware of before,

2695
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:54,710
but it lives in the jungle and you go,

2696
01:26:54,711 --> 01:26:54,921
well,

2697
01:26:54,921 --> 01:26:56,040
I could kind of see that happen,

2698
01:26:56,270 --> 01:26:58,790
but the idea of an intelligent thing,

2699
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,490
that's where people won't budge.

2700
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:05,330
The idea of an intelligent ape like human,

2701
01:27:05,331 --> 01:27:06,290
like thing,

2702
01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:11,690
another branch on the evolutionary
chain of lower hominids to human being

2703
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:12,710
another branch.

2704
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:13,251
Yeah.

2705
01:27:13,251 --> 01:27:16,340
It's interesting how in the
news when you hear about,

2706
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:19,460
they discovered a new
lizard in the Amazon.

2707
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:19,731
It's like,

2708
01:27:19,731 --> 01:27:19,941
oh,

2709
01:27:19,941 --> 01:27:20,600
whatever.

2710
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:21,231
Who Cares?

2711
01:27:21,231 --> 01:27:22,640
I'll think about that for four seconds.

2712
01:27:22,641 --> 01:27:23,660
It's not interesting at all.

2713
01:27:23,661 --> 01:27:25,310
I don't even want to
look at a picture of it.

2714
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:25,641
Right.

2715
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:27,320
But if they came out and said,

2716
01:27:27,321 --> 01:27:32,321
we found an intelligent apelike being
living in its own civilization and the

2717
01:27:32,511 --> 01:27:34,100
depths of the rain forest,

2718
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:36,230
that would make news forever.

2719
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:36,700
Yeah.

2720
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:37,710
So change the world.

2721
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,061
Yeah,

2722
01:27:38,061 --> 01:27:38,301
we're,

2723
01:27:38,301 --> 01:27:39,260
we're so,

2724
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:40,970
it is interesting that we do,

2725
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:45,500
it's not a surprise any other species
that gets discovered out in the great vast

2726
01:27:45,501 --> 01:27:46,990
wilderness that still exist,

2727
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:48,110
but for whatever reason,

2728
01:27:48,111 --> 01:27:52,660
we immediately disregard the idea that
there could be another form of super

2729
01:27:52,661 --> 01:27:53,840
advanced primate.

2730
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:54,550
Others.

2731
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:56,530
And they found primates very recently.

2732
01:27:56,531 --> 01:27:56,970
In fact,

2733
01:27:56,970 --> 01:27:58,630
they found this little pygmy primate.

2734
01:27:58,830 --> 01:28:00,520
It's a little tiny little monkey thing.

2735
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:01,990
It's really small though.

2736
01:28:01,991 --> 01:28:04,020
So we don't really give
a shit about it now.

2737
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:04,430
It's like,

2738
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:05,150
so what?

2739
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:06,160
You found a tiny monkey,

2740
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:08,290
but if you found a seven foot tall monkey,

2741
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:10,970
they would go ho Lee shit.

2742
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:12,560
What is it

2743
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,730
that if it didn't,

2744
01:28:13,731 --> 01:28:14,330
they just fine,

2745
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:16,610
but didn't they just find
something akin to that?

2746
01:28:16,611 --> 01:28:16,791
Like,

2747
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:17,610
didn't you?

2748
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:17,960
Uh,

2749
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:18,610
what did you call,

2750
01:28:18,610 --> 01:28:20,240
it's called the shit.

2751
01:28:20,241 --> 01:28:22,220
It's some very rare carnivorous apes.

2752
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:22,880
Yes.

2753
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,460
Pull up an image of the Bondo ape.

2754
01:28:25,461 --> 01:28:29,390
You could see one that got shot and
you can see this animal and this is an

2755
01:28:29,391 --> 01:28:30,290
animal that,

2756
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:30,710
um,

2757
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:34,490
up until I think 1996 they
didn't have any photos of it.

2758
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:39,620
There's a wildlife photographer from
Switzerland named Carl Armand and Carl

2759
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:40,311
Armaun went to,

2760
01:28:40,311 --> 01:28:41,930
that's a really old picture,

2761
01:28:41,931 --> 01:28:42,290
right?

2762
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:46,660
Isn't that a picture from like the
early 19 hundreds it could be a,

2763
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:47,451
I think that is,

2764
01:28:47,451 --> 01:28:50,720
I think that was a picture where it was
a huge chimpanzee and they didn't know

2765
01:28:50,721 --> 01:28:51,520
why that,

2766
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:51,830
that,

2767
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:52,730
that chimp was,

2768
01:28:52,731 --> 01:28:53,564
was so big.

2769
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:54,920
That's the one that got shot.

2770
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:56,170
Now this is a,

2771
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:58,580
a chimpanzee that's way larger.

2772
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:00,110
The other TV doesn't work.

2773
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:00,410
Yeah,

2774
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:01,243
it's off.

2775
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:01,561
Okay.

2776
01:29:01,561 --> 01:29:02,220
For a reason.

2777
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:02,700
Yeah.

2778
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:03,533
Okay.

2779
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:04,290
That CBC,

2780
01:29:04,290 --> 01:29:04,621
that thing.

2781
01:29:04,621 --> 01:29:04,831
Yeah,

2782
01:29:04,831 --> 01:29:06,000
but you can just look at it,

2783
01:29:06,001 --> 01:29:06,450
man.

2784
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:06,661
No,

2785
01:29:06,661 --> 01:29:07,494
you don't have to look at it.

2786
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:07,730
See,

2787
01:29:07,730 --> 01:29:08,820
you can see that thing behind you.

2788
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:12,090
Just look at it and just
this not looking for happy.

2789
01:29:12,091 --> 01:29:12,571
That's like,

2790
01:29:12,571 --> 01:29:14,190
you don't want to stumble onto that thing.

2791
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:15,030
They shot it,

2792
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:15,840
but that's that.

2793
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:16,920
It looks like a gorilla.

2794
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:19,440
It doesn't look like a chimpanzee
and it looks like a gorilla.

2795
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,140
And it's called the Bondo ape,

2796
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:24,160
and up until the 1990s
this thing was just a,

2797
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:25,800
it was a myth.

2798
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:26,820
It was a legend.

2799
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:30,780
It's an enormous chimpanzee
and the locals in the Congo,

2800
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,580
they say there's two types of chimps.

2801
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:36,930
There's the tree beaders and the lion
killers and the tree beaters are these

2802
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,900
smaller chimps that who
swing from tree to tree.

2803
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:44,280
The lion killers are these bondo apes
that are giant champs that sleep on the

2804
01:29:44,281 --> 01:29:45,610
ground like gorillas.

2805
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:45,930
Right.

2806
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:46,980
They're not scared of anything.

2807
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:48,080
They sleep on the ground.

2808
01:29:48,081 --> 01:29:49,350
They didn't have to hide in the trees.

2809
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:50,161
Like to this day,

2810
01:29:50,161 --> 01:29:53,340
the reason why people have their
master bedroom on the top floor,

2811
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:54,000
it was the whole,

2812
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,650
the whole chimpanzee idea,

2813
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:59,280
or you get to the the highest branches
where you're the most protected and

2814
01:29:59,281 --> 01:30:00,114
that's where you rest.

2815
01:30:00,230 --> 01:30:01,130
That's crazy.

2816
01:30:01,131 --> 01:30:02,000
I never knew that,

2817
01:30:02,001 --> 01:30:02,301
but yeah,

2818
01:30:02,301 --> 01:30:03,200
you're absolutely right.

2819
01:30:03,201 --> 01:30:04,430
What the house,

2820
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:05,930
it's at the top of the building.

2821
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:07,530
That's the best part of the building.

2822
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:08,960
Just the leopards can't get there.

2823
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:09,800
Wow.

2824
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:10,430
Yeah.

2825
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:11,330
That's crazy.

2826
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:12,823
That is crazy.

2827
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:13,571
Well,

2828
01:30:13,571 --> 01:30:17,170
these animals that are so big
that they're not even scared,

2829
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:18,690
they don't go to the top of the tree.

2830
01:30:18,691 --> 01:30:22,660
So probably the branches would break
cause they're probably several hundred

2831
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:22,860
pounds.

2832
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:23,320
I mean the,

2833
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:24,870
they're not like a small chimpanzee.

2834
01:30:24,871 --> 01:30:27,790
You mean they're like
three plus maybe even four.

2835
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:28,120
Right.

2836
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:31,120
So you're dealing with an enormous
chimpanzee that occasionally will walk

2837
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:31,840
upright.

2838
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:32,290
There's phone,

2839
01:30:32,290 --> 01:30:33,850
there's a camera trap photo of one.

2840
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,050
So if you can pull that up though,

2841
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,720
Karl Armaun camera trap chimpanzee,

2842
01:30:38,050 --> 01:30:41,380
you can see this thing walking
upright and they're six feet tall.

2843
01:30:41,410 --> 01:30:41,590
Right?

2844
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:42,423
It's enormous.

2845
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:43,360
So you're talking about chimp,

2846
01:30:43,390 --> 01:30:47,560
that's four inches taller
than me and it's huge.

2847
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:49,600
Just gigantic muscles.

2848
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:52,480
Probably as strong as all
like a thousand pound man.

2849
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:53,170
Yeah.

2850
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:56,170
And they got a video of
one eating a fucking leper.

2851
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:59,550
And here's the important note
in relation to Sasquatch,

2852
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:01,260
they just found the thing,

2853
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:05,130
1990 you have a six foot
chimp that walks up right?

2854
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:06,870
Wandering around in the,

2855
01:31:06,871 --> 01:31:07,430
in the,

2856
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:08,070
in,

2857
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:08,940
in nature.

2858
01:31:08,941 --> 01:31:11,250
And no one's discovered it until just now.

2859
01:31:11,251 --> 01:31:13,350
No one's gotten proof of it till just now.

2860
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:13,940
Yeah.

2861
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:14,750
Look at this thing.

2862
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:16,040
This is the picture of it walking.

2863
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:17,720
It's walking upright.

2864
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:19,280
That's a shit resolution.

2865
01:31:19,281 --> 01:31:20,570
It's hard to see in that photo,

2866
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,830
but that thing is walking hunched over
and upright and it's six feet tall.

2867
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:25,730
Those are devil chimps.

2868
01:31:25,731 --> 01:31:26,930
Their heads look like skulls.

2869
01:31:26,931 --> 01:31:27,741
Look at their heads.

2870
01:31:27,741 --> 01:31:28,400
They were enormous.

2871
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:28,551
Well,

2872
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:31,820
they have a crest on their head like a
gorilla that the only other chimpanzees

2873
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:34,040
and the only other a
primate besides gorillas,

2874
01:31:34,310 --> 01:31:35,810
they have a crest on their head like that.

2875
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:38,630
So they thought initially before
they ran DNA tests on them,

2876
01:31:38,631 --> 01:31:41,810
they thought initially that they
were a hybrid between a gorilla and a

2877
01:31:41,811 --> 01:31:42,644
chimpanzee,

2878
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,310
but now it appears that it's just a subset
of this chimpanzee if he's a species.

2879
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:46,711
Yeah,

2880
01:31:46,711 --> 01:31:51,711
so to me that that is one of the things
that exist in the world that made me

2881
01:31:52,471 --> 01:31:57,300
think it's possible that there is a Yeti
or a Sasquatch because w how could you

2882
01:31:57,301 --> 01:31:59,950
not discover something that's that size,

2883
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:02,320
that that is that unique?

2884
01:32:02,321 --> 01:32:03,040
Why wouldn't,

2885
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:08,040
if something like that can hide from
modern society for so long after the

2886
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:10,270
invention of cameras,

2887
01:32:10,540 --> 01:32:13,210
after the invention of helicopters,

2888
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:16,960
then why couldn't there be something
like a Sasquatch or a Yeti or something

2889
01:32:16,961 --> 01:32:17,351
like that?

2890
01:32:17,351 --> 01:32:17,691
Still out?

2891
01:32:17,691 --> 01:32:17,810
Yeah,

2892
01:32:17,810 --> 01:32:18,140
they're,

2893
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:18,471
yeah.

2894
01:32:18,471 --> 01:32:19,520
They found the gorilla,

2895
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:21,230
like we said in the early 19 hundreds.

2896
01:32:21,231 --> 01:32:23,690
It didn't find this for almost
a hundred years after that.

2897
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:24,110
Right.

2898
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:26,180
And we know the chimpanzees
are intelligent.

2899
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:26,360
We,

2900
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:29,450
but we also know that they're not
nearly as intelligent as people.

2901
01:32:29,780 --> 01:32:32,900
I don't know if that thing was hiding
from people or it was just in a place that

2902
01:32:32,901 --> 01:32:34,700
was so remote and so hard to get to.

2903
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:36,860
The Congo is enormous.

2904
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:37,220
Right?

2905
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:37,341
I mean,

2906
01:32:37,341 --> 01:32:40,670
it's really impossible for us
to wrap our heads around it.

2907
01:32:40,671 --> 01:32:43,070
It's like almost as wide
as the United States is.

2908
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:44,450
It's huge,

2909
01:32:44,510 --> 01:32:45,890
I think is that they're correct.

2910
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,083
Google that place.

2911
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:47,900
Um,

2912
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:48,171
it's,

2913
01:32:48,171 --> 01:32:48,920
it's enormous.

2914
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:49,510
It's,

2915
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:50,301
it's many,

2916
01:32:50,301 --> 01:32:50,601
many,

2917
01:32:50,601 --> 01:32:50,901
many,

2918
01:32:50,901 --> 01:32:52,580
many millions of square miles.

2919
01:32:52,590 --> 01:32:52,910
Right?

2920
01:32:52,910 --> 01:32:53,571
And so the,

2921
01:32:53,571 --> 01:32:57,380
it's not without outside the realm of
possibility that this almost impenetrable

2922
01:32:57,381 --> 01:32:59,270
jungle can hold a bunch of
different animals in it.

2923
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:03,350
But the difference being this animal
looks like another animal that we already

2924
01:33:03,351 --> 01:33:03,980
knew about.

2925
01:33:03,980 --> 01:33:05,450
That's why it's not that crazy.

2926
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:06,230
Right?

2927
01:33:06,230 --> 01:33:08,180
Big Foot is a totally new thing.

2928
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:08,721
You know,

2929
01:33:08,721 --> 01:33:11,390
you're saying there's an animal
that no one's ever found.

2930
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:12,141
Look at the size of that.

2931
01:33:12,141 --> 01:33:12,890
That's the Congo.

2932
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:13,400
Geez,

2933
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:16,370
Louise from top to bottom.

2934
01:33:16,371 --> 01:33:17,990
It's almost the same height as,

2935
01:33:17,991 --> 01:33:18,560
uh,

2936
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,393
as the United States.

2937
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:21,293
That's giant.

2938
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:22,430
And that's all jungle.

2939
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,680
So the,

2940
01:33:24,681 --> 01:33:25,370
um,

2941
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:27,380
the idea that this is a big foot though,

2942
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:31,010
that's where it gets a real squirrely
because you're talking about a totally

2943
01:33:31,011 --> 01:33:36,011
undiscovered primate that lives around
people and gets real close to people,

2944
01:33:37,071 --> 01:33:38,690
but never when they
have their cameras out.

2945
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,910
Never a picture that is,

2946
01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:44,610
are a picture like what you
just showed me at the Bondo ape.

2947
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:47,410
Never a picture or video where you,

2948
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:48,700
it's indisputable.

2949
01:33:48,910 --> 01:33:49,220
It's,

2950
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:50,500
it's very similar to you,

2951
01:33:50,501 --> 01:33:53,260
fos or goes through any
other thing like that.

2952
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:53,561
It's,

2953
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:58,561
every picture is easily
discounted or at least,

2954
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:00,330
or not quite good enough.

2955
01:34:00,350 --> 01:34:01,183
Right?

2956
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:02,520
Not quite good enough.

2957
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:03,930
Every photos like,

2958
01:34:03,931 --> 01:34:04,261
man,

2959
01:34:04,261 --> 01:34:05,700
that might be Sasquatch.

2960
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:07,023
Alright.

2961
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:07,861
I don't know.

2962
01:34:07,861 --> 01:34:08,880
It's hard to tell

2963
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:13,440
[inaudible] not a single camera trap.

2964
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:16,320
Do you want any camera traps are
out there now hunters used them,

2965
01:34:16,321 --> 01:34:19,200
they set them up on trails and
they put these things out there.

2966
01:34:19,201 --> 01:34:21,240
And what they do is they take a photo.

2967
01:34:21,241 --> 01:34:23,010
Either they have two ways of doing it.

2968
01:34:23,011 --> 01:34:26,400
Either they take a photo every three or
four seconds or five seconds or whatever

2969
01:34:26,401 --> 01:34:26,761
you said it,

2970
01:34:26,761 --> 01:34:27,850
four or they,

2971
01:34:27,851 --> 01:34:29,250
they act on motion.

2972
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:31,490
So when they see something
walking in front of them,

2973
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:33,420
a flash will go off and they take a photo.

2974
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:34,031
So they will,

2975
01:34:34,031 --> 01:34:36,120
it'll deal either be night
vision and the work at night,

2976
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:37,620
or they'll work on a flash system.

2977
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:38,160
Sure.

2978
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:40,630
None of these things
let me ever caught us up

2979
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:42,580
and I play Sasquatch advocate ears,

2980
01:34:42,581 --> 01:34:42,970
please.

2981
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:43,660
Okay,

2982
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:44,820
so you've,

2983
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:46,630
you actually pointed out this,

2984
01:34:46,631 --> 01:34:51,631
these tigers that were on some other
island that on an island that like evolved

2985
01:34:51,911 --> 01:34:52,390
in sense,

2986
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:53,350
it's lions actually.

2987
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:54,250
Why Africa?

2988
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:55,570
So relentless enemies.

2989
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:57,410
National Geographic special.

2990
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:57,681
Okay.

2991
01:34:57,681 --> 01:34:58,240
So

2992
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:03,240
why I point that only because
we've seen cases where evolution

2993
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:05,990
happens rapidly.

2994
01:35:05,991 --> 01:35:07,550
It doesn't happen over the course of,

2995
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:08,300
you know,

2996
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:09,530
hundreds of thousands of years.

2997
01:35:09,531 --> 01:35:13,820
Sometimes it seems to happen in a
really fast way and there would be an

2998
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:18,850
evolutionary advantage for a being
like a Sasquatch to avoid humans.

2999
01:35:19,341 --> 01:35:20,030
In fact,

3000
01:35:20,030 --> 01:35:24,170
there's an evolutionary advantage to
any creature avoiding humans because we

3001
01:35:24,171 --> 01:35:25,700
like to eat things.

3002
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:26,750
We love eating.

3003
01:35:26,751 --> 01:35:28,610
Things are turning them into our slaves.

3004
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:33,020
So there's an evolutionary advantage
to staying the hell away from us.

3005
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:34,040
So in that way,

3006
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:35,010
uh,

3007
01:35:35,010 --> 01:35:40,010
if a primate somehow evolved in the
same way we did and we've made super

3008
01:35:40,311 --> 01:35:42,770
computers and robots and space shuttles,

3009
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:44,120
if for whatever reason,

3010
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:45,290
something similar to us,

3011
01:35:45,291 --> 01:35:45,860
wouldn't know it,

3012
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:47,060
a different direction,

3013
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:50,660
which is the direction of being
closer to nature tied into the earth.

3014
01:35:50,930 --> 01:35:55,930
Part of that evolution would be
avoiding the crazy ball monkeys.

3015
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:57,770
They eat you,

3016
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,150
they enslave you,

3017
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:03,230
they will have sex with you if
they can stay away from them.

3018
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:06,470
So in that way it could make sense
that a super advanced primary,

3019
01:36:06,471 --> 01:36:10,100
it will be able to smell a human
scent on a device like that.

3020
01:36:10,101 --> 01:36:10,910
And they just stay,

3021
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:11,810
stay away from it.

3022
01:36:11,811 --> 01:36:12,644
They avoid it.

3023
01:36:12,670 --> 01:36:13,010
Why?

3024
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:18,010
Why couldn't there be some new reclusive
primate animals run away from me all

3025
01:36:18,081 --> 01:36:18,914
the time?

3026
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:20,070
It's possible.

3027
01:36:20,070 --> 01:36:20,791
It is possible.

3028
01:36:20,791 --> 01:36:21,870
And when you say it like that,

3029
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:23,790
you bring up a lot of
not of awesome points.

3030
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:24,211
I mean,

3031
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:29,100
if you were going to be a primate that
was super intelligent and figured out how

3032
01:36:29,101 --> 01:36:29,881
to live in the woods,

3033
01:36:29,881 --> 01:36:30,840
the smartest thing to do,

3034
01:36:30,841 --> 01:36:33,900
it'd be don't let people know
about you ever stay away and mean.

3035
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:36,090
The real question is how
smart are these things?

3036
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:36,750
Now,

3037
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:37,940
if you talk to the,

3038
01:36:37,941 --> 01:36:38,251
the,

3039
01:36:38,251 --> 01:36:38,550
the,

3040
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:38,870
the,

3041
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:39,300
let's,

3042
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:43,260
let's give a broad spectrum of
wackiness and she talked to the,

3043
01:36:43,261 --> 01:36:44,400
for the UFO hunters,

3044
01:36:44,610 --> 01:36:46,740
the wackiest of wacky thank their people.

3045
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:52,100
They think that they are the
spiritual beings that are very human,

3046
01:36:52,711 --> 01:36:53,550
like inform,

3047
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:57,660
like they think they have a human face
is just a very dark face and that they're

3048
01:36:57,661 --> 01:37:01,650
just covered in hair and they were a type
of wild human that lives in the woods.

3049
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:02,070
Okay.

3050
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:02,903
I mean there's,

3051
01:37:02,910 --> 01:37:04,230
there's some really,

3052
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:05,281
there's a,

3053
01:37:05,281 --> 01:37:07,890
there's a lot of variation in what
they believe that they're capable of.

3054
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:08,310
Sure.

3055
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:13,310
But ultimately they're talking about a
giant bipedal ape that no one's taken a

3056
01:37:14,011 --> 01:37:14,520
picture of.

3057
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:15,090
Sure.

3058
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:16,320
It's gets a little sketchy.

3059
01:37:16,510 --> 01:37:16,691
Well,

3060
01:37:16,691 --> 01:37:16,871
no,

3061
01:37:16,871 --> 01:37:17,201
I mean,

3062
01:37:17,201 --> 01:37:17,740
again,

3063
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:19,150
to play Sasquatch advocate,

3064
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:21,460
if you look at a monkey jump,

3065
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:23,740
like whenever you see
a monkey run up a tree,

3066
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:24,671
just a monkey.

3067
01:37:24,671 --> 01:37:27,700
If you watch how graceful and
powerful those things are,

3068
01:37:27,701 --> 01:37:31,600
and you consider you ever being
able to do that in a million years,

3069
01:37:31,870 --> 01:37:36,100
you see how much more advanced in
certain ways just a chimpanzee is.

3070
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:36,390
Yeah.

3071
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:40,930
So imagine if something had an equivalent
form of advancement when it came to

3072
01:37:40,931 --> 01:37:44,500
being able to camouflage
themselves or to hide,

3073
01:37:45,010 --> 01:37:45,341
you know,

3074
01:37:45,341 --> 01:37:50,341
maybe these things are just so good at
hiding that maybe the part of evolution

3075
01:37:50,741 --> 01:37:54,730
that made chimpanzees able to
climb a tree in five seconds,

3076
01:37:54,850 --> 01:37:56,040
and humans able to build

3077
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,873
a Chrysler,

3078
01:37:56,970 --> 01:38:01,970
maybe that part of evolution made these
beings able to hide and as super skilled

3079
01:38:03,001 --> 01:38:04,650
way they can cover their tracks,

3080
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,090
they can hide in the shadows.

3081
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:06,781
Why not?

3082
01:38:06,781 --> 01:38:11,220
It would be a great advancement for
a being to be able to hide an a.

3083
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:12,383
And w

3084
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:13,911
no,

3085
01:38:13,911 --> 01:38:14,340
you're right.

3086
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:14,901
You're right.

3087
01:38:14,901 --> 01:38:15,501
You're absolutely right.

3088
01:38:15,501 --> 01:38:17,750
A great advancement for a being
to be able to hide though.

3089
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:18,560
I'll say it.

3090
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:21,380
It would be a great advancement for
a being to be able to hide that way.

3091
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:21,870
Yeah.

3092
01:38:21,870 --> 01:38:26,520
He pull up a video of bear
runs up tree startles hunter.

3093
01:38:26,521 --> 01:38:27,354
You know that video.

3094
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:29,100
This is a pretty famous video.

3095
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:30,900
These guys bow hunting and
while their bow hunting,

3096
01:38:30,901 --> 01:38:34,380
this bear just decides to make a
break for it and runs up the tree.

3097
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:36,230
Not that weird.

3098
01:38:36,231 --> 01:38:37,950
And you know bears climb trees.

3099
01:38:37,951 --> 01:38:38,790
I think we both know,

3100
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:42,030
but did you have any fucking
idea how fast they can do it?

3101
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:47,090
I don't have this fair gets 20 feet up
that tree in a matter of seconds like

3102
01:38:48,901 --> 01:38:53,220
this and all of a sudden he's up there
looking eye to eye with this hunter.

3103
01:38:53,250 --> 01:38:54,000
Exactly.

3104
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,090
I just want you to see,

3105
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,700
just to put it in perspective,

3106
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:56,950
let's,

3107
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:58,350
let's look at it just to,

3108
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,000
just to get a peek at it.

3109
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:00,863
Watch this.

3110
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:01,733
So here's the guy.

3111
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:03,390
The bear comes close to him.

3112
01:39:03,391 --> 01:39:04,860
I don't know if this is the same one.

3113
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:06,720
Did you check this one was sideways.

3114
01:39:06,721 --> 01:39:07,420
I was trying it

3115
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:08,500
get something fast.

3116
01:39:09,130 --> 01:39:09,963
Let's see.

3117
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,030
What do you mean it's sideways?

3118
01:39:12,220 --> 01:39:12,350
No,

3119
01:39:12,350 --> 01:39:13,183
that one I pulled up.

3120
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:14,670
The video was sideways.

3121
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:15,953
Oh really?

3122
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:16,710
Pull up.

3123
01:39:16,710 --> 01:39:18,510
Let me see what the
other video looked like.

3124
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:21,113
Let me say it.

3125
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:22,671
Oh,

3126
01:39:22,671 --> 01:39:23,241
it's sideways.

3127
01:39:23,241 --> 01:39:23,361
Yeah,

3128
01:39:23,361 --> 01:39:24,290
that's the right video.

3129
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:26,660
But does it stay sideways the whole time?

3130
01:39:26,690 --> 01:39:27,850
I didn't even bother to look.

3131
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:28,281
Go,

3132
01:39:28,281 --> 01:39:29,061
go a little further up.

3133
01:39:29,061 --> 01:39:30,590
You might figure out what
the fuck he's doing wrong.

3134
01:39:30,591 --> 01:39:30,741
Yeah,

3135
01:39:30,741 --> 01:39:31,574
he does.

3136
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:35,240
Now get a little bit further
up and here's the bear.

3137
01:39:35,241 --> 01:39:35,811
Now watch this.

3138
01:39:35,811 --> 01:39:36,410
Watch this.

3139
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:36,771
Watch this.

3140
01:39:36,771 --> 01:39:37,604
Bear move.

3141
01:39:38,030 --> 01:39:38,301
Okay.

3142
01:39:38,301 --> 01:39:39,290
Give us some volume.

3143
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:39,621
Okay.

3144
01:39:39,621 --> 01:39:40,520
The bears are already up.

3145
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:45,620
Give us a volume and take it to right
when the bear makes a run for it.

3146
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:46,970
So the dude is up in this tree,

3147
01:39:46,990 --> 01:39:47,320
Stan,

3148
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:52,190
he puts this food out and the way you f
you hunt for bears and a lot of places,

3149
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:54,200
it's not legal in California this way,

3150
01:39:54,201 --> 01:39:57,410
but a lot of places they let
you use bait and buy bait.

3151
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:58,880
The usually mean donuts.

3152
01:39:59,090 --> 01:39:59,923
They take a,

3153
01:39:59,930 --> 01:40:00,680
yeah,

3154
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:01,000
yeah.

3155
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:01,160
They,

3156
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:05,630
they take donuts or something sweet and
they put them in a barrel so that this

3157
01:40:05,631 --> 01:40:05,990
bear,

3158
01:40:05,990 --> 01:40:08,540
we'll go to that barrel and then
while he's looking for his food,

3159
01:40:08,541 --> 01:40:09,374
that's when he killed him.

3160
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:10,470
It's really trying to do shit.

3161
01:40:10,471 --> 01:40:11,840
That doesn't look fun at all.

3162
01:40:12,170 --> 01:40:13,130
It's kind of Douchey.

3163
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:15,680
But if I'm watching this bear run,

3164
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:16,543
look at this.

3165
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:17,473
Check this out.

3166
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:17,751
Look,

3167
01:40:17,751 --> 01:40:20,960
he makes a bolt for it and
then just put it on rump.

3168
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,610
Ah,

3169
01:40:24,470 --> 01:40:25,303
watch this.

3170
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:28,070
Yeah.

3171
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:30,830
The guy obviously fucked
with his camera here.

3172
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:31,580
What does that,

3173
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:32,413
this is wrong.

3174
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:34,160
You can show it.

3175
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:35,360
What's wrong with this video?

3176
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:38,080
Is this a bad video?

3177
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:39,690
Why would not say in this?

3178
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:41,880
Okay.

3179
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:42,713
Figure it out.

3180
01:40:42,850 --> 01:40:43,520
Figure it out.

3181
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:44,450
Something wrong with the video.

3182
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:45,201
That here's,

3183
01:40:45,201 --> 01:40:45,601
here's the,

3184
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:48,980
the point is that this
bear runs up this tree.

3185
01:40:48,981 --> 01:40:51,200
The way you could run straight,

3186
01:40:51,650 --> 01:40:54,250
like he literally runs up the tree.

3187
01:40:54,530 --> 01:40:54,860
It's,

3188
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:55,930
it's pretty fucking insane,

3189
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:56,793
right?

3190
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:58,000
This is not the same video.

3191
01:40:58,060 --> 01:40:58,893
You can stop now,

3192
01:40:58,930 --> 01:40:59,351
but that,

3193
01:40:59,351 --> 01:41:00,184
here's the,

3194
01:41:00,370 --> 01:41:01,570
here's the essence of the thing.

3195
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:05,320
When you look at a chimpanzee
and you look at a human,

3196
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:06,490
what are some of the similarities?

3197
01:41:06,491 --> 01:41:06,611
Well,

3198
01:41:06,611 --> 01:41:09,970
the similarities are both have figured
out how to use tools in a rudimentary

3199
01:41:09,971 --> 01:41:10,181
way.

3200
01:41:10,181 --> 01:41:13,720
Chimpanzees use stakes to get
termites out of the ground.

3201
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:16,690
Humans use cars to get to their jobs.

3202
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:17,673
So,

3203
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:18,663
um,

3204
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:19,990
why,

3205
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:20,824
why is it,

3206
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:21,873
why isn't it,

3207
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:22,803
why isn't,

3208
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:26,890
why isn't there the possibility
than another primate,

3209
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:30,760
instead of evolving the ability to use
tools or instead of just evolving that

3210
01:41:30,761 --> 01:41:32,530
ability they used,

3211
01:41:32,650 --> 01:41:35,470
they evolved the ability
to camouflage themselves.

3212
01:41:35,471 --> 01:41:36,700
Because in nature,

3213
01:41:36,701 --> 01:41:37,534
if you're a hunter,

3214
01:41:37,870 --> 01:41:40,210
what's a better skill
than to be able to hide?

3215
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:43,300
There's almost no better skill in nature.

3216
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:48,040
Chameleons are almost every
creature that is a predator.

3217
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:52,480
There's skin has adapted to
their surroundings in a way
that makes them blend in

3218
01:41:52,481 --> 01:41:57,190
so that they could be a more powerful
and efficient Predator in that way.

3219
01:41:57,220 --> 01:42:02,220
Why wouldn't a primate now just evolve
a skin color or hair color that makes

3220
01:42:02,861 --> 01:42:04,270
them blend in with their environment,

3221
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:08,620
but the ability to hide and
a true super advanced way.

3222
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:09,111
Okay.

3223
01:42:09,111 --> 01:42:09,230
Okay.

3224
01:42:09,230 --> 01:42:11,510
So I'm gonna play devil's advocate please.

3225
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:12,890
And this is not
necessarily what I believe,

3226
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:16,970
but if there was really
an animal like this,

3227
01:42:17,180 --> 01:42:18,080
there would be something.

3228
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:22,370
Now all you have is like the theater
Roosevelt wrote about it in a story.

3229
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:22,710
Yeah.

3230
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:23,620
You know about his time,

3231
01:42:23,660 --> 01:42:24,590
his time in the woods,

3232
01:42:24,591 --> 01:42:27,350
but when a dude gets killed by a wild man,

3233
01:42:27,351 --> 01:42:27,610
who knows?

3234
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:28,100
I mean,

3235
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,210
who knows what really happened,

3236
01:42:29,211 --> 01:42:29,420
right?

3237
01:42:29,420 --> 01:42:33,170
And then 19 whatever the fuck it was
back when teddy was running around.

3238
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:38,780
The reality of life today is that if
you're dealing with a very populated area,

3239
01:42:39,050 --> 01:42:40,700
everyone has a fucking
camera on their phone.

3240
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,020
Sure.

3241
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:44,870
If everyone has a camera on their phone
and no one is getting a photo of this

3242
01:42:44,871 --> 01:42:45,350
thing,

3243
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:48,560
how many human beings are traveling
through the areas where these things live

3244
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,870
and not one person gets a picture.

3245
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:52,100
And now here's the other problem.

3246
01:42:53,630 --> 01:42:54,680
It's iconic.

3247
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:56,540
It's an archetype.

3248
01:42:56,570 --> 01:43:01,100
It's a thing that people go to right
away is I think it's very similar to the

3249
01:43:01,101 --> 01:43:02,720
gray alien with the big eyes.

3250
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:02,990
Yes.

3251
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:06,110
I think if you are not
sure what you're seeing,

3252
01:43:06,230 --> 01:43:08,990
your mind will create this thing.

3253
01:43:08,991 --> 01:43:13,991
And one of the reasons that I say this
is because I read a lot about hunting

3254
01:43:14,031 --> 01:43:18,800
accidents and one of the things that has
happened in hunting accidents is that

3255
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:23,750
people who are experienced hunters
who know that in order to bag a deer,

3256
01:43:23,751 --> 01:43:27,470
you have to capitalize
on a very split moment,

3257
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:32,330
a very small window in time where you
got to capitalize on that in order to get

3258
01:43:32,331 --> 01:43:33,164
the kill right.

3259
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:33,561
Well,

3260
01:43:33,561 --> 01:43:37,790
people have shot people
accidentally and sworn up and down.

3261
01:43:37,791 --> 01:43:38,720
They saw a deer,

3262
01:43:39,470 --> 01:43:42,290
they swore up and down
that they saw a dean.

3263
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:42,980
Right?

3264
01:43:42,980 --> 01:43:45,790
And when you're talking about big
foot and you're talking about bigfoot

3265
01:43:45,791 --> 01:43:46,790
sightings you're talking about,

3266
01:43:46,791 --> 01:43:47,241
first of all,

3267
01:43:47,241 --> 01:43:47,961
it's not a mystery.

3268
01:43:47,961 --> 01:43:49,010
It's not like you're talking about,

3269
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:49,700
you know,

3270
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:51,920
finding Rumpelstiltskin or something else.

3271
01:43:51,921 --> 01:43:54,440
You're talking about something that
people have repeated the same stories over

3272
01:43:54,441 --> 01:43:55,290
and over and over again.

3273
01:43:56,450 --> 01:44:00,500
You're talking about something that
we have a reference to in our heads,

3274
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:02,030
and when you see something,

3275
01:44:02,031 --> 01:44:05,810
you might see just a whisper of something
you don't know what the fuck you saw.

3276
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:08,390
You saw something through the
trees and it's dark out there.

3277
01:44:08,391 --> 01:44:08,710
Anyway,

3278
01:44:08,710 --> 01:44:11,620
busy canopy of leaves
and it's never sunny out,

3279
01:44:11,621 --> 01:44:11,870
right.

3280
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:13,400
It's always rainy and cloudy.

3281
01:44:13,401 --> 01:44:14,780
So what are you really seeing?

3282
01:44:14,781 --> 01:44:15,500
Sure.

3283
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,240
But by the time a week goes by,

3284
01:44:17,241 --> 01:44:18,260
or a month goes by,

3285
01:44:18,261 --> 01:44:19,430
or maybe even an hour,

3286
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:22,310
maybe it takes you three hours to
walk to your car and you're an idiot.

3287
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:25,610
And you convince yourself in those
three hours that you saw his face and it

3288
01:44:25,611 --> 01:44:27,110
looked at you and it read your mind.

3289
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:30,910
You might be so pumped up
with adrenaline and fear and,

3290
01:44:30,911 --> 01:44:31,280
and,

3291
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:32,180
and who knows?

3292
01:44:32,181 --> 01:44:37,181
Just longing for a life with excitement
where you're not wandering through the

3293
01:44:37,791 --> 01:44:39,770
woods looking for fucking shadows.

3294
01:44:39,850 --> 01:44:40,240
Also,

3295
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:42,830
half the people in the
forest or high at any time,

3296
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:44,413
please stop.

3297
01:44:44,530 --> 01:44:45,560
Nobody goes into the,

3298
01:44:46,090 --> 01:44:48,190
we can only base that grateful dead can.

3299
01:44:48,191 --> 01:44:52,290
We can only base that on our own personal
experience and with you and I was 100%

3300
01:44:52,291 --> 01:44:54,030
so it's 100% of the people
in the woods or high.

3301
01:44:54,150 --> 01:44:54,330
Yeah.

3302
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:55,320
Cause that's all we have.

3303
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,410
We should have got those big foot Chi Psi.

3304
01:44:58,050 --> 01:44:59,070
That's where we fucked up.

3305
01:44:59,490 --> 01:45:00,540
They were just drunk.

3306
01:45:00,930 --> 01:45:01,770
We should've got him high.

3307
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:02,170
Yeah.

3308
01:45:02,170 --> 01:45:03,003
Big different results.

3309
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:03,510
I,

3310
01:45:03,510 --> 01:45:04,050
I,

3311
01:45:04,050 --> 01:45:05,100
I really mean it though.

3312
01:45:05,101 --> 01:45:08,940
I'm saying that people go into
the woods and they get hi.

3313
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:09,480
Yeah,

3314
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:09,900
you're right.

3315
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:11,310
If you're going to take mushrooms,

3316
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:13,140
what did people always say?

3317
01:45:13,170 --> 01:45:15,500
Go take them and then nature
takes them in the forest.

3318
01:45:15,501 --> 01:45:15,930
So,

3319
01:45:15,930 --> 01:45:20,930
and that way I would say that a lot of
the observers who are experiencing these

3320
01:45:21,331 --> 01:45:21,581
a,

3321
01:45:21,581 --> 01:45:25,220
a lot of the people in the woods or
maybe under the influence of Ntl of

3322
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:26,093
intoxicants,

3323
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:27,330
but you don't need to be right.

3324
01:45:27,331 --> 01:45:28,860
If I'm a kid out in the woods,

3325
01:45:29,190 --> 01:45:29,431
yeah,

3326
01:45:29,431 --> 01:45:30,990
I can hear anything,

3327
01:45:30,991 --> 01:45:31,370
man.

3328
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:33,380
She thinks you can see things.

3329
01:45:33,450 --> 01:45:34,500
Dragons,

3330
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:36,520
big elves.

3331
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:37,590
Yeah.

3332
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:38,760
Cause think of the woods.

3333
01:45:38,761 --> 01:45:39,720
There's no light.

3334
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:41,670
Trees are shifting around.

3335
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:44,850
It would be very easy to project anything.

3336
01:45:44,950 --> 01:45:47,530
And you know that there's a real danger.

3337
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:48,993
What was that noise?

3338
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:50,613
Hello?

3339
01:45:51,870 --> 01:45:52,470
Hello.

3340
01:45:52,470 --> 01:45:54,000
There was a real danger.

3341
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:55,020
There's a real danger.

3342
01:45:55,021 --> 01:45:56,130
There's mountain lions,

3343
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:57,000
there's bears,

3344
01:45:57,070 --> 01:45:57,930
there's wolves.

3345
01:45:58,170 --> 01:46:02,220
The woods contain real things that will
kill you and forget about poisonous

3346
01:46:02,221 --> 01:46:03,360
spiders and stinks.

3347
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:05,130
There's mountain lions,

3348
01:46:05,370 --> 01:46:07,320
bears and wolves and the woods.

3349
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:08,760
So there's a real fear.

3350
01:46:08,790 --> 01:46:10,850
So it's a really highly
charged environment.

3351
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:12,840
So what you mentioned earlier,

3352
01:46:12,841 --> 01:46:17,841
how people prefer to have rooms on the
top floor of a building or a house.

3353
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:24,140
Examples like that show how embedded into
our species is the trauma of having to

3354
01:46:25,861 --> 01:46:28,620
deal with predators in the wild.

3355
01:46:28,770 --> 01:46:30,540
The wildness that we evolved in.

3356
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:35,720
So it makes sense that somehow inside of
our neurology is imprinted the remnants

3357
01:46:37,861 --> 01:46:40,620
of the these predatorial forces,

3358
01:46:40,621 --> 01:46:45,621
the kind of combined racial memory of
all the things that used to hunt us in

3359
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:47,250
Itas and when we,

3360
01:46:47,251 --> 01:46:47,520
when,

3361
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:48,360
when we go in the woods,

3362
01:46:48,361 --> 01:46:49,194
even today,

3363
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:54,470
maybe our brains still are on alert or
on guard for these things that used to

3364
01:46:54,691 --> 01:46:59,220
terrorize our ancestors and people who
see big foot or really just seeing a

3365
01:46:59,221 --> 01:47:01,710
projection of this thing out into nature.

3366
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:07,150
It could be that it also
could be a reaction to being
in the wilderness itself,

3367
01:47:08,030 --> 01:47:11,870
which is mostly being experienced by
people who aren't native to the wilderness

3368
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,280
when they're having these experiences.

3369
01:47:13,281 --> 01:47:14,060
Even if they like,

3370
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:15,650
like normal campers,

3371
01:47:15,651 --> 01:47:16,820
the camp on every weekend,

3372
01:47:16,910 --> 01:47:18,990
they don't live there every day they,

3373
01:47:19,010 --> 01:47:22,730
they live there in short bursts and
then they run back to civilization.

3374
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,940
So in living in that environment,

3375
01:47:25,941 --> 01:47:29,500
there must be some thinking where you're,

3376
01:47:29,501 --> 01:47:32,510
you wonder what it would be
like to survive out here.

3377
01:47:32,511 --> 01:47:32,751
One,

3378
01:47:32,751 --> 01:47:34,940
would it be like to survive
out here without nature,

3379
01:47:35,090 --> 01:47:36,740
could an intelligent being do it?

3380
01:47:36,830 --> 01:47:38,120
Maybe he's out there.

3381
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:41,270
Maybe my would brother
is out there right now.

3382
01:47:41,271 --> 01:47:41,780
My,

3383
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:46,250
my ape monkey would brother
who's just as smart as me,

3384
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:51,340
but chooses to not engage and
remain on the outskirts of society,

3385
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:55,220
eating off the land with
its intelligent mind.

3386
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:56,450
Hiding from people.

3387
01:47:58,430 --> 01:47:59,263
Yeah,

3388
01:47:59,270 --> 01:48:00,200
it's possible,

3389
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:06,740
but it's not that likely.

3390
01:48:06,830 --> 01:48:07,663
It's not likely.

3391
01:48:07,700 --> 01:48:08,600
That's what sucks.

3392
01:48:08,780 --> 01:48:10,040
But why is it so sexy?

3393
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:11,480
Why is it such a sexy idea?

3394
01:48:11,481 --> 01:48:14,630
Why is the idea of seeing big foot
one of the most exciting things?

3395
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:15,770
If you said to me,

3396
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:16,910
Joe,

3397
01:48:16,910 --> 01:48:21,910
would you rather be able to fly without
a plane anywhere you want it in the

3398
01:48:22,491 --> 01:48:27,491
world for 30 whole days or go
hiking and actually meet big foot?

3399
01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:30,440
Wow.

3400
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:31,640
I would say I'll take big foot.

3401
01:48:32,690 --> 01:48:35,360
I'll take big foot over
30 days of awesomeness.

3402
01:48:35,450 --> 01:48:36,590
What does every great dream?

3403
01:48:36,591 --> 01:48:37,370
You're flying,

3404
01:48:37,370 --> 01:48:39,560
you're flying and every great dream and
then you land on a girl wants to have

3405
01:48:39,561 --> 01:48:40,340
sex with you.

3406
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:41,630
That's what every great dream is,

3407
01:48:41,690 --> 01:48:42,500
okay?

3408
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:43,100
This is,

3409
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:46,430
I'm telling you that if you
gave me 30 days of that,

3410
01:48:46,490 --> 01:48:47,630
I would say no.

3411
01:48:47,810 --> 01:48:52,070
I would rather meet big for it because
I've got some questions I want to know if

3412
01:48:52,071 --> 01:48:52,904
it's real

3413
01:48:53,110 --> 01:48:53,291
well.

3414
01:48:53,291 --> 01:48:54,190
You know it's real.

3415
01:48:54,191 --> 01:48:55,000
If you meet it,

3416
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:55,850
then what do you have to,

3417
01:48:55,960 --> 01:48:56,920
that's why I'm willing to,

3418
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:58,240
big foot's going to say to you,

3419
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:58,550
well,

3420
01:48:58,550 --> 01:48:59,051
it's going to say,

3421
01:48:59,051 --> 01:49:00,250
why didn't you fly?

3422
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:01,781
Look at me.

3423
01:49:01,781 --> 01:49:03,340
I'm covered in fleas.

3424
01:49:03,341 --> 01:49:04,660
I live out here and shit.

3425
01:49:04,661 --> 01:49:05,320
Land.

3426
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:10,000
You could have flown around for 30 days
in assignment and talk to some hairy

3427
01:49:10,030 --> 01:49:14,210
failed monkey hiding from its Tinier,

3428
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:15,011
smaller,

3429
01:49:15,011 --> 01:49:16,180
far smarter.

3430
01:49:16,181 --> 01:49:17,014
Brethren,

3431
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:22,450
pick flying pig flying

3432
01:49:23,210 --> 01:49:23,570
mad.

3433
01:49:23,570 --> 01:49:23,751
They're like,

3434
01:49:23,751 --> 01:49:23,940
dude,

3435
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:24,860
don't even have a phone.

3436
01:49:24,890 --> 01:49:25,670
Okay,

3437
01:49:25,670 --> 01:49:26,960
there's no fucking stores out here.

3438
01:49:26,961 --> 01:49:28,400
I killed elk with my face.

3439
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:32,310
I've been drinking my own piss
for the last thousand years.

3440
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:37,050
They never have to worry
about running out of water,

3441
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:39,300
but they've never found a
water collection device.

3442
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:41,580
So that would mean that they
would have to live near streams.

3443
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:42,151
Yeah,

3444
01:49:42,151 --> 01:49:42,391
well,

3445
01:49:42,391 --> 01:49:42,631
you know,

3446
01:49:42,631 --> 01:49:43,200
there's a lot.

3447
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:43,500
Look,

3448
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:46,700
there's clearly a lot of
problems with it here.

3449
01:49:47,130 --> 01:49:47,260
Well,

3450
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:48,010
they're really big

3451
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:48,520
too,

3452
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:49,240
but then here's,

3453
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:49,630
here's,

3454
01:49:49,630 --> 01:49:50,980
here's some on the pro side.

3455
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:52,860
Here's one of the things
that they always say.

3456
01:49:53,010 --> 01:49:54,550
Why are we found a big foot body?

3457
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:55,210
Okay,

3458
01:49:55,210 --> 01:49:55,451
well,

3459
01:49:55,451 --> 01:49:57,310
here's one thing that you need to think.

3460
01:49:57,311 --> 01:49:57,970
Consider,

3461
01:49:57,970 --> 01:49:59,620
when was the last time you
saw a dead mountain lion?

3462
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:00,520
Okay.

3463
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:02,320
There are a lot of God
damn mountain lions.

3464
01:50:02,321 --> 01:50:06,940
I mean like a thousand of them in
probably southern California alone.

3465
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:07,361
She's like,

3466
01:50:07,361 --> 01:50:08,260
they're all over the place.

3467
01:50:08,261 --> 01:50:09,100
There's a lot of them.

3468
01:50:09,101 --> 01:50:10,060
They're not like a big foot.

3469
01:50:10,090 --> 01:50:11,800
It's not like a mythical creature.

3470
01:50:12,010 --> 01:50:13,750
It's something that we
absolutely have evidence of it,

3471
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:14,950
but we never see a dead one.

3472
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:16,300
But they must die.

3473
01:50:16,510 --> 01:50:17,060
They must.

3474
01:50:17,060 --> 01:50:20,810
If you believe the idea that a big
foot is something that has evolved,

3475
01:50:21,050 --> 01:50:25,190
it's ability to hide in a way that's
exponentially greater than any other

3476
01:50:25,191 --> 01:50:25,581
animal.

3477
01:50:25,581 --> 01:50:30,581
Then you can also add to that the idea
that they would know to bury their dead.

3478
01:50:31,820 --> 01:50:32,960
We bury our dead.

3479
01:50:33,080 --> 01:50:35,090
When was the last time
you saw a dead human?

3480
01:50:35,480 --> 01:50:35,931
You know,

3481
01:50:35,931 --> 01:50:37,940
unless you're living in Syria right now,

3482
01:50:37,941 --> 01:50:38,481
you've probably,

3483
01:50:38,481 --> 01:50:38,901
it's probably,

3484
01:50:38,901 --> 01:50:40,460
I mean you don't see them that often.

3485
01:50:40,461 --> 01:50:41,271
It's a rarity.

3486
01:50:41,271 --> 01:50:42,410
We bury our dead.

3487
01:50:42,411 --> 01:50:44,810
It's not like dead bodies are always dead.

3488
01:50:44,811 --> 01:50:48,500
Humans are laying around and just saying
maybe these apes or whatever they are,

3489
01:50:48,501 --> 01:50:49,490
they bury their dead,

3490
01:50:49,491 --> 01:50:51,830
which is why we don't see
their corpses anywhere.

3491
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:52,590
Right.

3492
01:50:52,590 --> 01:50:56,460
That's a very good point and it's a very
good possibility if they really were

3493
01:50:56,461 --> 01:50:57,360
this intelligent thing.

3494
01:50:57,361 --> 01:50:58,194
And in fact,

3495
01:50:58,260 --> 01:50:59,970
one of the guys that we talked to,

3496
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:01,290
this guy talk to,

3497
01:51:01,291 --> 01:51:03,170
to talk to who the fucking money,

3498
01:51:03,750 --> 01:51:04,410
excuse me,

3499
01:51:04,410 --> 01:51:05,280
one of the guys we talked,

3500
01:51:05,281 --> 01:51:07,470
it was a guy named William Jev Nick,

3501
01:51:07,590 --> 01:51:12,590
and he is a guy who had his own experience
with Sasquatch when he was 14 years

3502
01:51:13,441 --> 01:51:16,350
old and the guy did not seem like a cook.

3503
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:17,430
He was not,

3504
01:51:17,670 --> 01:51:19,740
he did not register at all.

3505
01:51:19,741 --> 01:51:20,310
I'll say that again,

3506
01:51:20,310 --> 01:51:21,240
did not seem like a Kook.

3507
01:51:21,450 --> 01:51:22,680
He did not register it all.

3508
01:51:22,681 --> 01:51:25,560
My crazy scale seemed like
a very reasonable guy.

3509
01:51:25,590 --> 01:51:30,060
He's an author and he was telling his
experience and he was saying that when he

3510
01:51:30,061 --> 01:51:31,230
was 14 years old,

3511
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:31,760
he,

3512
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,930
he saw a fucking Sasquatch.

3513
01:51:36,340 --> 01:51:37,450
I believe he believes it.

3514
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:38,973
He believes it.

3515
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:39,851
Yes.

3516
01:51:39,851 --> 01:51:42,400
I think there are people who
believe they seen this thing.

3517
01:51:43,150 --> 01:51:43,630
You know,

3518
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:47,530
it's for sure there's no question but
that there are people who believe that

3519
01:51:47,531 --> 01:51:48,430
they seen a thing,

3520
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:52,270
but that doesn't mean that
they've actually seen the thing.

3521
01:51:52,630 --> 01:51:57,630
There's people in Alabama who think
there's a Leprechaun and the inner cities,

3522
01:51:58,750 --> 01:52:00,100
it doesn't mean it's there.

3523
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:03,860
This dude thinks he knows
where borough ground this.

3524
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:04,191
Oh,

3525
01:52:04,191 --> 01:52:05,090
that's why that's different.

3526
01:52:05,420 --> 01:52:07,550
This is where it gets
weird and this is what,

3527
01:52:07,551 --> 01:52:08,600
this is where I had to go.

3528
01:52:08,810 --> 01:52:09,643
Hmm.

3529
01:52:09,710 --> 01:52:11,780
Because he was making sense to me.

3530
01:52:12,410 --> 01:52:14,080
He was a,

3531
01:52:14,130 --> 01:52:14,400
uh,

3532
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:15,530
a reasonable man.

3533
01:52:15,531 --> 01:52:17,120
He obviously was educated.

3534
01:52:17,210 --> 01:52:18,590
He spoke very well.

3535
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:19,391
We were having a,

3536
01:52:19,391 --> 01:52:21,230
a nice smooth conversation.

3537
01:52:21,710 --> 01:52:24,110
And then he tells me that he
knows we're burial around is okay.

3538
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:29,450
He tells me he knows where a burial
ground is and he says he's known it for 20

3539
01:52:29,451 --> 01:52:30,284
years.

3540
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:32,810
So I stop and I'm going,

3541
01:52:32,870 --> 01:52:33,081
well,

3542
01:52:33,081 --> 01:52:34,010
what are you talking about?

3543
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:34,740
Like if you,

3544
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:35,091
you know,

3545
01:52:35,091 --> 01:52:36,140
where a burial ground is,

3546
01:52:36,141 --> 01:52:36,830
man,

3547
01:52:36,830 --> 01:52:37,011
like,

3548
01:52:37,011 --> 01:52:37,844
hold on a second.

3549
01:52:38,570 --> 01:52:39,980
Why didn't you go and dig it up?

3550
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:40,580
All right.

3551
01:52:40,580 --> 01:52:41,090
Well,

3552
01:52:41,090 --> 01:52:41,661
you know,

3553
01:52:41,661 --> 01:52:42,650
the Sasquatch,

3554
01:52:42,680 --> 01:52:44,540
they're not gonna like it if you do that.

3555
01:52:44,810 --> 01:52:45,650
Let me you something.

3556
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:48,380
And this is the same thing
that Tom Powell said.

3557
01:52:48,410 --> 01:52:49,131
Tom Powell,

3558
01:52:49,131 --> 01:52:49,964
who was a,

3559
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:50,510
um,

3560
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:55,510
a teacher in Oregon also told us
that he's had Sasquatch experiences,

3561
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:59,420
also told us that he wasn't a
believer until something happened.

3562
01:52:59,421 --> 01:53:02,960
And then he saw it and then all of a
sudden became a believer but also told us

3563
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:04,100
he knows where Barrow Grind is.

3564
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:05,503
When I said,

3565
01:53:05,690 --> 01:53:06,830
tell me where it is,

3566
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:07,371
I go,

3567
01:53:07,371 --> 01:53:08,181
you tell me where it is,

3568
01:53:08,181 --> 01:53:10,880
I'll bring in a bunch of mercenaries
and we'll dig the shit up.

3569
01:53:11,050 --> 01:53:11,300
Like,

3570
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:12,290
let's find out what's up.

3571
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:13,041
You tell me,

3572
01:53:13,041 --> 01:53:13,874
you know where it is.

3573
01:53:13,910 --> 01:53:15,380
If it's really a dangerous area,

3574
01:53:15,410 --> 01:53:16,700
I'll bring in a bunch of dudes with guns.

3575
01:53:16,701 --> 01:53:17,930
It won't be dangerous anymore.

3576
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:20,810
We'll bring in people with
shovels and we'll dig it up.

3577
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:22,003
Come on.

3578
01:53:22,130 --> 01:53:22,881
If it's still there,

3579
01:53:22,881 --> 01:53:23,480
we'll dig it up.

3580
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:24,313
Sure.

3581
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:25,273
And uh,

3582
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:29,720
the fact that they haven't done
that is where I start going,

3583
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:32,870
when are we really dealing with here?

3584
01:53:33,250 --> 01:53:33,530
Right?

3585
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:37,250
When you're dedicating your life to this
thing that you have zero evidence of,

3586
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:37,701
what do you,

3587
01:53:37,701 --> 01:53:38,870
what are we really doing here?

3588
01:53:38,930 --> 01:53:41,870
And when you're telling me that you saw
this thing when you were 14 years old,

3589
01:53:42,170 --> 01:53:43,490
I believe you.

3590
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:45,740
I believe that you believe you.

3591
01:53:45,741 --> 01:53:47,780
It's w that's what I mean
when I say I believe you.

3592
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:48,290
Sure.

3593
01:53:48,290 --> 01:53:49,430
But I don't know.

3594
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:53,930
I when people tell me stories about
shit that I just did five years ago,

3595
01:53:54,350 --> 01:53:54,741
I go,

3596
01:53:54,741 --> 01:53:55,690
Oh yeah,

3597
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:56,673
oh yeah,

3598
01:53:57,470 --> 01:53:58,820
I forgot about him.

3599
01:53:58,821 --> 01:53:59,240
I didn't even,

3600
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:01,250
I forgot he was even there.

3601
01:54:01,430 --> 01:54:04,760
And then you start re re imaging,

3602
01:54:04,810 --> 01:54:05,120
right?

3603
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:06,410
The past in your mind.

3604
01:54:06,950 --> 01:54:10,580
And I think that when you're dealing with
something as insane as seen big foot,

3605
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:13,070
especially big foot when
you're 14 years old,

3606
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:18,500
it gets real sketchy so that when you're
repeating the story x amount of years

3607
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:18,950
later,

3608
01:54:18,950 --> 01:54:20,090
you're basically lying.

3609
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:20,990
Right.

3610
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:23,330
I'm basically lying when
I talk about my childhood.

3611
01:54:23,570 --> 01:54:23,991
Okay.

3612
01:54:23,991 --> 01:54:26,720
I know some very vague
facts about my childhood.

3613
01:54:26,721 --> 01:54:27,140
Yes.

3614
01:54:27,140 --> 01:54:28,250
But when I tell you,

3615
01:54:28,530 --> 01:54:30,950
I can remember this like it was yesterday,

3616
01:54:31,250 --> 01:54:35,360
me and Grandpa was fishing and Grandpa
was the only one that paid attention to

3617
01:54:35,361 --> 01:54:36,860
me and he cared.

3618
01:54:36,861 --> 01:54:37,820
And why I caught that fish.

3619
01:54:37,821 --> 01:54:38,654
He was so happy.

3620
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:40,730
I don't fucking remember
what Grandpa was it.

3621
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:41,571
He might've been drunk.

3622
01:54:41,571 --> 01:54:42,440
He might've passed out.

3623
01:54:42,441 --> 01:54:43,400
I'm going to made it all up.

3624
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:44,060
I might have,

3625
01:54:44,060 --> 01:54:45,490
might have danced it all in my head.

3626
01:54:45,491 --> 01:54:45,620
Yeah.

3627
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:47,870
I don't remember what I did five days ago.

3628
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:49,430
Exactly.

3629
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:51,200
The whole thing's a murky blur.

3630
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:53,720
I can barely remember
what I had for breakfast.

3631
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:55,060
Exactly.

3632
01:54:55,120 --> 01:54:56,230
Exactly.

3633
01:54:56,530 --> 01:54:59,680
So when someone tells you
about a big foot story,

3634
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:02,980
it may or may not be an accurate story.

3635
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:06,050
I would say it is not an accurate story.

3636
01:55:06,051 --> 01:55:07,430
I don't believe in big foot.

3637
01:55:07,431 --> 01:55:08,600
And I think that the,

3638
01:55:08,601 --> 01:55:08,870
uh,

3639
01:55:08,870 --> 01:55:09,351
that the,

3640
01:55:09,351 --> 01:55:10,000
that,

3641
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:10,280
uh,

3642
01:55:10,280 --> 01:55:12,110
having played Sasquatch advocate,

3643
01:55:12,111 --> 01:55:12,944
I have to say,

3644
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:14,090
let me give you an example.

3645
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:15,051
You know,

3646
01:55:15,051 --> 01:55:16,730
where a big foot burial ground is,

3647
01:55:16,870 --> 01:55:17,130
right?

3648
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:17,330
Like,

3649
01:55:17,330 --> 01:55:18,021
you know that,

3650
01:55:18,021 --> 01:55:18,471
you know,

3651
01:55:18,471 --> 01:55:20,000
this thing I can tell you there,

3652
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:21,350
I could take you there.

3653
01:55:21,410 --> 01:55:21,801
You know,

3654
01:55:21,801 --> 01:55:22,100
uh,

3655
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:22,371
you know,

3656
01:55:22,371 --> 01:55:23,750
where a big foot burial ground is.

3657
01:55:24,500 --> 01:55:29,500
This would be one of the most monumental
anthropological discoveries of,

3658
01:55:31,850 --> 01:55:33,440
of our generation,

3659
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:33,951
of maybe,

3660
01:55:33,951 --> 01:55:34,790
of our time.

3661
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:38,960
And you're not letting your
species know about this thing.

3662
01:55:39,370 --> 01:55:39,700
Why,

3663
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:40,370
why?

3664
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:40,491
Well,

3665
01:55:40,491 --> 01:55:40,941
here's the thing,

3666
01:55:40,941 --> 01:55:41,610
Dunkin,

3667
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:42,443
um,

3668
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:43,540
when you've squatting,

3669
01:55:43,540 --> 01:55:43,990
as long as I

3670
01:55:43,990 --> 01:55:44,680
have,

3671
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:49,680
you basically consider the squatch
to be somewhat like family and a,

3672
01:55:49,831 --> 01:55:52,170
I don't consider these
things to be creatures.

3673
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:57,140
I consider these things to be my
would brethren and my forest friends.

3674
01:55:57,250 --> 01:55:58,300
Can I ask you something?

3675
01:55:59,230 --> 01:56:00,760
Character Joe Rogan's playing.

3676
01:56:01,330 --> 01:56:03,220
Are you on a TV show right now?

3677
01:56:03,860 --> 01:56:04,311
Um,

3678
01:56:04,311 --> 01:56:08,540
occasionally I am on a TV show
looking for squatch squashing.

3679
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:12,430
So you're revealing to the entire
planet the existence of big foot,

3680
01:56:12,431 --> 01:56:14,650
but you don't want to prove
it with a burial ground.

3681
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:14,871
Well,

3682
01:56:14,871 --> 01:56:16,550
I don't like the snippets of your tone,

3683
01:56:16,551 --> 01:56:16,771
sir.

3684
01:56:16,771 --> 01:56:16,940
Can,

3685
01:56:16,940 --> 01:56:19,190
I'll tell you right now when
I'm looking for squatch,

3686
01:56:19,580 --> 01:56:21,290
it is 100%.

3687
01:56:21,710 --> 01:56:25,460
There's no bad intention involved.

3688
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:28,370
I have love for the squatch.

3689
01:56:28,610 --> 01:56:30,890
The squatch community recognize me.

3690
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:31,521
In fact,

3691
01:56:31,521 --> 01:56:33,980
I know their favorite food
is peanut butter and Jelly.

3692
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:37,310
I leave it in the gifting tree outside
my house and it's often gone when I

3693
01:56:37,311 --> 01:56:38,144
return.

3694
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:39,770
All right.

3695
01:56:39,770 --> 01:56:40,603
Well I gotta go.

3696
01:56:40,670 --> 01:56:41,840
What do you like?

3697
01:56:41,930 --> 01:56:43,020
Don't go and get the check.

3698
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:43,220
No.

3699
01:56:43,220 --> 01:56:46,130
A man who lives on
nothing but water and air.

3700
01:56:46,131 --> 01:56:46,281
No,

3701
01:56:46,281 --> 01:56:47,150
no water shit.

3702
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:48,073
I forgot.

3703
01:56:48,270 --> 01:56:48,671
Oh Man.

3704
01:56:48,671 --> 01:56:49,240
But you,

3705
01:56:49,240 --> 01:56:52,270
to me it seems like it's absolutely,

3706
01:56:52,420 --> 01:56:55,870
if they have discovered
some proof of these um,

3707
01:56:55,930 --> 01:56:56,860
beings existing,

3708
01:56:56,861 --> 01:57:01,861
I think it is unethical to not reveal
it because the ethical thing to do would

3709
01:57:02,261 --> 01:57:06,100
be to show the burial grounds so that we
can create nature preserves to protect

3710
01:57:06,101 --> 01:57:10,330
these precious woodland creatures from
logging and all the variety of things

3711
01:57:10,331 --> 01:57:11,164
that

3712
01:57:11,230 --> 01:57:15,340
you really think that the government
is going to protect the squatch.

3713
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:16,240
Yes.

3714
01:57:16,240 --> 01:57:16,931
This was the other thing.

3715
01:57:16,931 --> 01:57:17,680
This guy believes,

3716
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:21,820
this guy believes that the government
actually is aware of the squatch.

3717
01:57:21,821 --> 01:57:22,270
Yes,

3718
01:57:22,270 --> 01:57:26,860
and the government is hiding the squatch
because the government thinks that

3719
01:57:27,130 --> 01:57:31,780
society itself would fall apart
much like an alien invasion,

3720
01:57:32,260 --> 01:57:35,290
much like in an alien invasion scenario,

3721
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:37,030
religion would fall apart.

3722
01:57:37,330 --> 01:57:40,720
How do you explain the giant wood
man that was not in the Bible?

3723
01:57:40,780 --> 01:57:41,531
How do you explain it?

3724
01:57:41,531 --> 01:57:43,210
10 foot tall person thing.

3725
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:44,141
Who lives in the,

3726
01:57:44,141 --> 01:57:47,260
in the woods and can spot
camera traps a mile away.

3727
01:57:47,340 --> 01:57:48,173
Wait a minute.

3728
01:57:48,410 --> 01:57:49,071
There's a scar.

3729
01:57:49,071 --> 01:57:51,980
Squatch I'm going to burn
down the White House,

3730
01:57:52,010 --> 01:57:52,130
right?

3731
01:57:52,130 --> 01:57:52,190
All right.

3732
01:57:52,190 --> 01:57:52,851
Now here we go.

3733
01:57:52,851 --> 01:57:53,541
Proponent.

3734
01:57:53,541 --> 01:57:54,374
Here's proponent,

3735
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,071
pull up.

3736
01:57:55,071 --> 01:57:59,480
There's a photo of gigantic [inaudible]
and there's a gigantic pithy guests that

3737
01:57:59,481 --> 01:58:01,610
is right beside.

3738
01:58:01,611 --> 01:58:03,170
It's standing beside a person.

3739
01:58:03,171 --> 01:58:03,381
It's a,

3740
01:58:03,381 --> 01:58:04,400
it's a recreation.

3741
01:58:04,401 --> 01:58:08,690
It's a man in a recreation of this
animal and this is where it gets really

3742
01:58:08,691 --> 01:58:09,260
weird.

3743
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:14,150
Gigantic [inaudible] is an animal that
they found out about in the posit carry

3744
01:58:14,151 --> 01:58:14,600
shop.

3745
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:17,420
There's that photo and then there's
another one that's kind of even more

3746
01:58:17,421 --> 01:58:20,360
interesting because they
did it in front of a jungle.

3747
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:20,631
Yeah,

3748
01:58:20,631 --> 01:58:21,464
that one right there.

3749
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:24,020
Now look at this fucking thing.

3750
01:58:24,170 --> 01:58:25,100
Spread this out.

3751
01:58:25,250 --> 01:58:26,540
Here's what's crazy.

3752
01:58:26,570 --> 01:58:28,670
That was real.

3753
01:58:29,150 --> 01:58:30,860
That's a real animal.

3754
01:58:30,861 --> 01:58:32,030
They have bones.

3755
01:58:32,031 --> 01:58:33,290
They have teeth.

3756
01:58:33,530 --> 01:58:37,520
They know that this thing was bipedal
base in the shape of his lower jaw.

3757
01:58:37,940 --> 01:58:42,940
This was an animal that existed is as a
hundred thousand years ago and existed

3758
01:58:43,931 --> 01:58:48,820
in Asia and they didn't find out about
this to the 1920s there was a guy who

3759
01:58:48,821 --> 01:58:50,380
went into an apothecary shop.

3760
01:58:50,381 --> 01:58:51,550
I should probably credit him here.

3761
01:58:51,820 --> 01:58:52,271
Let's see.

3762
01:58:52,271 --> 01:58:53,170
Gigantic.

3763
01:58:53,171 --> 01:58:53,880
Oh pick.

3764
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:55,570
It kind of looks like an orangutan.

3765
01:58:56,170 --> 01:58:56,591
Yeah.

3766
01:58:56,591 --> 01:59:00,760
But except stands up on its fucking
hind legs and it's 10 feet tall.

3767
01:59:00,761 --> 01:59:01,361
Other than that,

3768
01:59:01,361 --> 01:59:02,194
yeah,

3769
01:59:03,180 --> 01:59:03,761
it will be.

3770
01:59:03,761 --> 01:59:08,050
So then if you saw an orangutan in
the zoo and right behind it was that,

3771
01:59:08,051 --> 01:59:08,321
you'd be like,

3772
01:59:08,321 --> 01:59:09,400
what the fuck is that?

3773
01:59:09,730 --> 01:59:11,150
It's a 10 foot tall.

3774
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:13,300
Rang Tang that walks like a person.

3775
01:59:13,330 --> 01:59:15,550
Holy Shit.

3776
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,860
Are you fucking kidding me?

3777
01:59:18,010 --> 01:59:21,160
I just liked the idea of those two
actually being friends in real life,

3778
01:59:21,161 --> 01:59:22,540
like a superhero team.

3779
01:59:22,780 --> 01:59:23,051
Okay.

3780
01:59:23,051 --> 01:59:23,980
This is the guy's name.

3781
01:59:24,010 --> 01:59:25,040
The gentleman's name is [inaudible]

3782
01:59:25,150 --> 01:59:25,780
Ralph.

3783
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:28,990
Yvonne calling's Wald,

3784
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:30,370
Cohen's Wald,

3785
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:31,960
Ralph Vaughan Cohen's wall.

3786
01:59:32,110 --> 01:59:36,160
And he was in the apothecary
shop in China and there's a,

3787
01:59:36,161 --> 01:59:41,161
it was in a light Ching
Cave in light Luzio China.

3788
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:42,790
I might've said that wrong.

3789
01:59:42,940 --> 01:59:43,630
Anyway,

3790
01:59:43,630 --> 01:59:48,630
he found these teeth as well as several
job bones and this apothecary shop.

3791
01:59:48,970 --> 01:59:51,290
And he apparently he was a,

3792
01:59:51,330 --> 01:59:51,880
um,

3793
01:59:51,880 --> 01:59:52,421
he was,

3794
01:59:52,421 --> 01:59:53,110
uh,

3795
01:59:53,110 --> 01:59:55,210
I believe he's an anthropologist.

3796
01:59:55,780 --> 02:00:00,780
And he went and he found these bones and
I think he recognized right away that

3797
02:00:01,841 --> 02:00:02,860
these were primate.

3798
02:00:03,050 --> 02:00:03,610
Right.

3799
02:00:03,610 --> 02:00:08,290
And that they were way too big to be
human and way too big to be gorilla.

3800
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:09,041
He was like,

3801
02:00:09,041 --> 02:00:11,080
what the fuck is this?

3802
02:00:11,190 --> 02:00:11,350
Right.

3803
02:00:11,350 --> 02:00:14,410
The people in the Chinese apothecary
shop just thought they had some random

3804
02:00:14,411 --> 02:00:14,800
bones.

3805
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:15,460
Sure.

3806
02:00:15,460 --> 02:00:18,790
And they actually were
calling them dragging bones.

3807
02:00:18,870 --> 02:00:19,330
Um,

3808
02:00:19,330 --> 02:00:20,020
and uh,

3809
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:24,370
they trace these teeth back to their
source and it resulted in recovery,

3810
02:00:24,371 --> 02:00:28,030
have more teeth and a rather
complete large mandible.

3811
02:00:28,210 --> 02:00:30,070
Now by 1958,

3812
02:00:30,190 --> 02:00:35,190
it says here on Wikipedia that three
mandibles and 1300 teeth had been

3813
02:00:35,321 --> 02:00:36,154
discovered.

3814
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:37,410
So they know that this is a,

3815
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:42,630
for sure real animal and the most recent
fossils are a hundred thousand years

3816
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:43,420
ago.

3817
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:46,780
That's when you look at that thing
and you hear a big foot story.

3818
02:00:47,110 --> 02:00:47,620
That's fuck,

3819
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:48,880
that's fucking big foot.

3820
02:00:48,910 --> 02:00:51,910
I mean that thing next
to that guy is big foot.

3821
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:52,150
Right.

3822
02:00:52,150 --> 02:00:52,983
But again,

3823
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:54,880
they didn't find a skull.

3824
02:00:55,090 --> 02:00:58,210
They found teeth in a job bone
and they made Chubak out of it.

3825
02:00:58,240 --> 02:01:00,360
They didn't find a skull.

3826
02:01:00,370 --> 02:01:01,830
It's true shape

3827
02:01:01,830 --> 02:01:02,641
of the lower jaw.

3828
02:01:02,641 --> 02:01:05,970
They couldn't determine that
this was a bipedal animal.

3829
02:01:06,010 --> 02:01:06,630
Okay.

3830
02:01:06,630 --> 02:01:09,120
Cause it's not determined it's hair color.

3831
02:01:09,180 --> 02:01:09,720
No,

3832
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:10,050
that's,

3833
02:01:10,050 --> 02:01:10,980
that's totally made up.

3834
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:12,570
That's also with Neanderthal,

3835
02:01:12,660 --> 02:01:12,901
you know,

3836
02:01:12,901 --> 02:01:15,890
within thall notice I
said all this time when,

3837
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:16,411
when you,

3838
02:01:16,411 --> 02:01:16,830
um,

3839
02:01:16,830 --> 02:01:18,630
look at neanderthal imagery,

3840
02:01:18,660 --> 02:01:19,620
that's all made up.

3841
02:01:19,830 --> 02:01:20,341
In fact,

3842
02:01:20,341 --> 02:01:21,040
there is a,

3843
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:25,410
a guy who thought of Neanderthal is a
Predator and he had this whole paper that

3844
02:01:25,411 --> 02:01:26,221
he wrote and,

3845
02:01:26,221 --> 02:01:26,430
and,

3846
02:01:26,430 --> 02:01:31,430
and he even had a video made of proposing
that neanderthal had black skin,

3847
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:33,510
like a gorilla.

3848
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:37,410
And that neanderthal where these super
muscular predators that hunted humans,

3849
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:39,770
and that's why we drove
them to extinction.

3850
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:42,600
And he actually bases this
on the shape of their jaw.

3851
02:01:42,601 --> 02:01:43,040
She's like,

3852
02:01:43,040 --> 02:01:45,950
we impose human characteristics
to neanderthals,

3853
02:01:46,070 --> 02:01:47,110
but if you look at it in the end,

3854
02:01:47,111 --> 02:01:49,100
are tall skull next to a homosapien skull,

3855
02:01:49,120 --> 02:01:50,270
they're very different.

3856
02:01:50,550 --> 02:01:52,130
The shape of the eyes different.

3857
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:52,491
Now,

3858
02:01:52,491 --> 02:01:55,970
if we know the chimpanzees exist and we
know the grills exist and we know that

3859
02:01:55,971 --> 02:02:00,350
their facial structure is actually more
similar to a neanderthal than ours are.

3860
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:00,800
Yeah,

3861
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:03,590
why wouldn't we assume that
they had skin coloring and,

3862
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:03,970
and,

3863
02:02:03,970 --> 02:02:07,550
and skin texture that was
very guerrilla like right.

3864
02:02:07,551 --> 02:02:09,260
And so this guy made this video,

3865
02:02:09,261 --> 02:02:12,290
see if you could pull
that up neander tall as a,

3866
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:13,250
as a Predator

3867
02:02:15,170 --> 02:02:15,951
of humans,

3868
02:02:15,951 --> 02:02:17,630
as a Predator of humans,

3869
02:02:17,690 --> 02:02:21,530
free tour of humans.

3870
02:02:22,430 --> 02:02:23,650
I'll tell you what I find.

3871
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:27,140
It's called them and us.

3872
02:02:27,170 --> 02:02:27,770
Okay.

3873
02:02:27,770 --> 02:02:28,910
So look up them,

3874
02:02:28,940 --> 02:02:31,280
them and us how the
neanderthals were a oppressed.

3875
02:02:31,460 --> 02:02:32,710
But this guy had um,

3876
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:35,610
images that he created and he,

3877
02:02:35,611 --> 02:02:39,540
he wrote a book detailing
this theory and I'm,

3878
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:44,560
his theory was that we had excepted a
vision of what Niana tall looked on,

3879
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:45,890
looked at,

3880
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:48,890
looked like based entirely
on what we look like,

3881
02:02:48,950 --> 02:02:49,310
right.

3882
02:02:49,310 --> 02:02:49,791
And he saying,

3883
02:02:49,791 --> 02:02:49,911
well,

3884
02:02:49,911 --> 02:02:52,730
there's no evidence of
that and you might as well,

3885
02:02:52,731 --> 02:02:56,000
you might as well look at it as
being far closer to a gorilla.

3886
02:02:56,150 --> 02:03:01,090
And he gives a bunch of reasons that
have to do with the size of the bones.

3887
02:03:01,091 --> 02:03:01,610
Sure.

3888
02:03:01,610 --> 02:03:03,320
They had much different
bone structure than us.

3889
02:03:03,410 --> 02:03:06,020
They were like 200 plus pounds
and they were like five feet tall.

3890
02:03:06,110 --> 02:03:07,580
They were totally weird looking.

3891
02:03:07,820 --> 02:03:08,930
There were not like a person.

3892
02:03:08,970 --> 02:03:09,540
Yes,

3893
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:11,970
it's just in the reconstruction
that you just showed me.

3894
02:03:12,330 --> 02:03:15,840
If you're saying this came from teeth
and a jawbone and you're saying this was

3895
02:03:15,841 --> 02:03:17,580
done by the professor,

3896
02:03:17,581 --> 02:03:20,970
Loreal guy in the picture with
the hairy Orangutang like thing,

3897
02:03:21,270 --> 02:03:23,670
I want to know where did
you get the hair color from?

3898
02:03:24,270 --> 02:03:25,980
Why is the hair color that long?

3899
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:27,530
This being it'll know.

3900
02:03:27,540 --> 02:03:27,841
Listen.

3901
02:03:27,841 --> 02:03:28,240
You know what I mean?

3902
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:29,550
You're right about that for sure.

3903
02:03:29,650 --> 02:03:33,810
Because I think anybody could take a few
teeth in a Java on and stick that into

3904
02:03:33,811 --> 02:03:35,400
a Sasquatch replica and say,

3905
02:03:35,401 --> 02:03:35,701
look,

3906
02:03:35,701 --> 02:03:37,130
it's proof mom.

3907
02:03:37,140 --> 02:03:37,680
Yeah,

3908
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:38,281
sort of.

3909
02:03:38,281 --> 02:03:39,090
I mean,

3910
02:03:39,090 --> 02:03:39,923
I guess you could,

3911
02:03:40,110 --> 02:03:41,490
but what we do know,

3912
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:42,870
I mean that's just speculation,

3913
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:43,621
but we do know this is,

3914
02:03:43,621 --> 02:03:44,520
this is a real animal.

3915
02:03:45,090 --> 02:03:46,410
So whatever this was,

3916
02:03:46,650 --> 02:03:47,760
whether it looked like that.

3917
02:03:47,790 --> 02:03:48,090
Yeah.

3918
02:03:48,090 --> 02:03:49,170
Or it didn't look like that.

3919
02:03:49,230 --> 02:03:50,760
We know it was huge.

3920
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:51,061
Well,

3921
02:03:51,061 --> 02:03:52,890
this is absolutely gigantic,

3922
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:57,480
far bigger than any primate that's
ever lived since then or before then.

3923
02:03:57,510 --> 02:03:58,343
As far as we know,

3924
02:03:58,400 --> 02:03:59,960
if you look in the book of Genesis,

3925
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:02,960
there's reference to these
beings called the nephilim.

3926
02:04:03,050 --> 02:04:05,450
Then nephilim were these giants.

3927
02:04:05,451 --> 02:04:07,760
They said they were
giants during this time.

3928
02:04:07,761 --> 02:04:08,270
And,

3929
02:04:08,270 --> 02:04:09,103
um,

3930
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:09,471
you know,

3931
02:04:09,471 --> 02:04:10,820
who knows whether that's real or not.

3932
02:04:10,821 --> 02:04:15,821
But I think all mythologies
have referenced to these
giant human things that

3933
02:04:16,191 --> 02:04:17,390
used to wander the earth.

3934
02:04:17,470 --> 02:04:17,800
Well,

3935
02:04:17,800 --> 02:04:18,221
we know,

3936
02:04:18,221 --> 02:04:20,440
think about human giants
that we know about.

3937
02:04:20,470 --> 02:04:20,920
Okay?

3938
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:23,350
Think about guys like
Shaquille O'Neal or Hong Man,

3939
02:04:23,351 --> 02:04:24,700
Troy or real giants,

3940
02:04:24,701 --> 02:04:24,880
right?

3941
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:26,560
They have a lot of physical problems.

3942
02:04:26,740 --> 02:04:29,200
And then think about what
it takes to create a fossil.

3943
02:04:29,500 --> 02:04:31,150
It's incredibly difficult
to create a fossil.

3944
02:04:31,151 --> 02:04:32,320
The only way you create a fossils,

3945
02:04:32,321 --> 02:04:35,710
if you get caught in a landslide or a
volcano or something happens where it

3946
02:04:35,711 --> 02:04:36,550
preserves your body,

3947
02:04:36,551 --> 02:04:37,770
you can get in mud.

3948
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,720
But most of us are not
going to be fossils.

3949
02:04:39,960 --> 02:04:41,190
Most of us are just going to rot.

3950
02:04:41,380 --> 02:04:43,530
We're going to go into the ground
and then worms are going to eat us,

3951
02:04:43,531 --> 02:04:44,640
and then we're going to cease to exist.

3952
02:04:44,641 --> 02:04:48,000
So we're going to be transmuted
into the next age of the afternoon.

3953
02:04:48,001 --> 02:04:49,040
I haven't praise,

3954
02:04:49,041 --> 02:04:49,730
praise,

3955
02:04:49,730 --> 02:04:50,563
praise Shiva.

3956
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:52,680
But what we,

3957
02:04:52,681 --> 02:04:57,450
what we do know is that
there's been people our size
and then there's been these

3958
02:04:57,451 --> 02:04:58,530
little tiny hobbit people.

3959
02:04:58,560 --> 02:04:59,010
Yes.

3960
02:04:59,010 --> 02:05:01,680
I think it would be ridiculous
to think that it's not possible.

3961
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:02,690
They could have been giant piece.

3962
02:05:02,950 --> 02:05:03,251
Sure.

3963
02:05:03,251 --> 02:05:04,630
There was giant lizards,

3964
02:05:04,631 --> 02:05:05,560
giant birds.

3965
02:05:05,561 --> 02:05:07,330
There's been giant elephants.

3966
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:08,560
Giant Tiger's.

3967
02:05:08,740 --> 02:05:10,570
If you go down to the labrea tar pits,

3968
02:05:10,870 --> 02:05:14,260
just check out the sculptures
of the dire wolves out there.

3969
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:17,140
Those things used to
wander around Los Angeles.

3970
02:05:17,170 --> 02:05:18,003
How big were they?

3971
02:05:18,010 --> 02:05:19,030
Huge.

3972
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:21,040
Like horse size wolf.

3973
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:21,893
What?

3974
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:23,560
Direwolves Los Angeles.

3975
02:05:23,590 --> 02:05:24,423
Yeah.

3976
02:05:25,450 --> 02:05:26,820
Now they're not going to be horse size.

3977
02:05:26,821 --> 02:05:27,790
I'm gonna say probably huge.

3978
02:05:28,270 --> 02:05:28,740
Well,

3979
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:29,110
did you?

3980
02:05:29,110 --> 02:05:29,291
Yeah.

3981
02:05:29,291 --> 02:05:29,740
It's okay.

3982
02:05:29,740 --> 02:05:30,573
Don't worry about it.

3983
02:05:30,590 --> 02:05:31,180
Um,

3984
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:33,820
did you ever Dire Wolf Los Angeles?

3985
02:05:35,050 --> 02:05:36,830
She's going to bring up a crappy band.

3986
02:05:36,950 --> 02:05:40,280
Remains of nearly 2000
dire wolf's were Exuma.

3987
02:05:41,300 --> 02:05:43,250
They lived 9,000 years ago.

3988
02:05:43,251 --> 02:05:43,461
Okay.

3989
02:05:43,461 --> 02:05:45,610
How big were they or not?

3990
02:05:45,810 --> 02:05:46,643
It doesn't say

3991
02:05:46,740 --> 02:05:47,580
there were huge.

3992
02:05:47,620 --> 02:05:48,480
All I believe you bro.

3993
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:49,620
Look at,

3994
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:49,891
I mean,

3995
02:05:49,891 --> 02:05:50,250
look at,

3996
02:05:50,250 --> 02:05:53,100
look at a saber tooth
tigers for God's sake.

3997
02:05:53,580 --> 02:05:54,361
Look at those things.

3998
02:05:54,361 --> 02:05:56,100
Those things used to wander around La.

3999
02:05:56,190 --> 02:05:56,371
Well,

4000
02:05:56,371 --> 02:05:56,911
not only that,

4001
02:05:56,911 --> 02:05:58,290
that was only like 10,000 years ago.

4002
02:05:58,320 --> 02:05:58,521
Yeah.

4003
02:05:58,521 --> 02:06:03,480
So the idea that there were giant
humans are giant primates is not,

4004
02:06:03,540 --> 02:06:06,750
to me a particularly shocking notion.

4005
02:06:06,990 --> 02:06:11,820
I believe that it's just hard for me to
imagine that one of them has managed to

4006
02:06:11,821 --> 02:06:13,590
somehow exist in the present day.

4007
02:06:13,770 --> 02:06:14,640
It's also disturbed

4008
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:14,910
bang.

4009
02:06:14,910 --> 02:06:16,650
And this is one of the
things that we resist.

4010
02:06:16,651 --> 02:06:19,110
We resist danger that we're not aware of.

4011
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:20,100
When you're resistant,

4012
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:20,581
like call,

4013
02:06:20,581 --> 02:06:21,270
come on.

4014
02:06:21,270 --> 02:06:22,590
I was talking to someone about a,

4015
02:06:22,591 --> 02:06:23,090
um,

4016
02:06:23,090 --> 02:06:25,410
this is a community that's experiencing,

4017
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:26,160
um,

4018
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:26,401
they,

4019
02:06:26,401 --> 02:06:26,820
uh,

4020
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:30,600
they live near a factory and they're
experiencing like all these issues.

4021
02:06:30,870 --> 02:06:32,550
And I was talking to someone who,

4022
02:06:32,551 --> 02:06:32,930
uh,

4023
02:06:32,930 --> 02:06:33,601
it was saying like,

4024
02:06:33,601 --> 02:06:34,201
hey man,

4025
02:06:34,201 --> 02:06:34,890
like this,

4026
02:06:34,890 --> 02:06:37,320
this community might be
poisoned because of his factory.

4027
02:06:37,530 --> 02:06:38,610
And then I talked to another guy,

4028
02:06:38,611 --> 02:06:39,030
I was like,

4029
02:06:39,030 --> 02:06:39,900
oh listen,

4030
02:06:39,901 --> 02:06:41,070
that's nonsense.

4031
02:06:41,071 --> 02:06:45,450
Let me tell you something that if that
was true and he starts rattling off some

4032
02:06:45,451 --> 02:06:46,620
reasons why he doesn't believe it's true.

4033
02:06:46,621 --> 02:06:48,470
And then I asked him if he had
looked into it and he hadn't.

4034
02:06:48,750 --> 02:06:49,411
And then I realized,

4035
02:06:49,411 --> 02:06:49,651
okay,

4036
02:06:49,651 --> 02:06:54,180
we're dealing with like reactions that
humans have when we want to categorize

4037
02:06:54,181 --> 02:06:59,181
dangers and we want to put them in it
clearly definable categories and we have

4038
02:06:59,461 --> 02:07:00,960
to wonder whether we
want to worry about them.

4039
02:07:01,110 --> 02:07:03,360
And some things you worry
about never take place.

4040
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:04,470
And if that's happens,

4041
02:07:04,471 --> 02:07:07,680
then you're a little worry wart and
you're a pussy and then you're ruining

4042
02:07:07,681 --> 02:07:08,440
society,

4043
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:08,591
right?

4044
02:07:08,591 --> 02:07:11,340
Because you're a big wimp and
people don't want to be a big wimp.

4045
02:07:11,590 --> 02:07:13,500
So when people don't
want to be a big Wimp,

4046
02:07:13,650 --> 02:07:17,970
they dismiss things that may or may not
be real and may or may not be a danger.

4047
02:07:18,060 --> 02:07:20,190
And they do it as a defense mechanism.

4048
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:24,640
And so it's not entirely
objective the reaction to any,

4049
02:07:24,660 --> 02:07:25,493
any thing.

4050
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:25,711
Well,

4051
02:07:25,711 --> 02:07:28,170
when you bring up big
foot people immediately,

4052
02:07:28,310 --> 02:07:29,143
ah,

4053
02:07:29,670 --> 02:07:30,031
shy,

4054
02:07:30,031 --> 02:07:32,340
you're gonna love for big
foot guide and look for the,

4055
02:07:32,360 --> 02:07:32,581
Oh,

4056
02:07:32,581 --> 02:07:33,480
what else are you going to look for?

4057
02:07:33,481 --> 02:07:34,790
Leprechauns well,

4058
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:36,630
let me know when you find a Pegasus

4059
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:37,040
out there,

4060
02:07:37,040 --> 02:07:37,660
fella,

4061
02:07:37,660 --> 02:07:40,930
and take a ride around the
world in the flying in horse,

4062
02:07:41,050 --> 02:07:42,430
it's probably real.

4063
02:07:42,520 --> 02:07:44,470
I mean the Greeks made a statue of it.

4064
02:07:44,471 --> 02:07:44,951
Why would they,

4065
02:07:44,951 --> 02:07:45,461
why,

4066
02:07:45,461 --> 02:07:46,030
right?

4067
02:07:46,030 --> 02:07:47,350
Why would they lie?

4068
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:52,090
And what he's doing by berating you and
by dismissing this topic is not just

4069
02:07:52,091 --> 02:07:55,150
dismissing something that is
preposterous and is ludicrous and stupid,

4070
02:07:55,420 --> 02:07:58,510
but he's also making himself feel better
because he's scared because he's a

4071
02:07:58,511 --> 02:07:59,231
scared little bitch.

4072
02:07:59,231 --> 02:08:03,940
Worried about that guy started big foot
and his giant Rasputin Dwarfing Dick,

4073
02:08:04,240 --> 02:08:06,850
big foot must have a dick like a giraffe.

4074
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:10,060
It was probably like a
giraffe neck tied to his cock.

4075
02:08:10,090 --> 02:08:13,120
It's just is gigantic
and it's probably black,

4076
02:08:13,121 --> 02:08:13,954
like coal.

4077
02:08:14,020 --> 02:08:15,850
I'm scared of so many things.

4078
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:18,700
I'm scared of taking my
shirt off at a swimming pool,

4079
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:21,440
but I am not scared of bigfoot.

4080
02:08:21,730 --> 02:08:25,270
And my reason for not believing in
bigfoot is not because I'm afraid that my

4081
02:08:25,271 --> 02:08:26,470
belief in bigfoot,

4082
02:08:26,670 --> 02:08:30,760
some big foot's gonna come trouncing
into my house in Silverlake.

4083
02:08:31,540 --> 02:08:31,960
I'm,

4084
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:32,711
I don't believe in,

4085
02:08:32,711 --> 02:08:33,100
first of all,

4086
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:34,690
you fucked up and telling
people where you live.

4087
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:35,711
Second of all,

4088
02:08:35,711 --> 02:08:36,544
hunt me down.

4089
02:08:36,630 --> 02:08:37,780
And second of all,

4090
02:08:38,170 --> 02:08:41,080
you say all this shit because you
haven't seen Bobcat Goldthwait it's movie

4091
02:08:41,081 --> 02:08:41,830
Willow Creek.

4092
02:08:41,830 --> 02:08:43,450
I like to watch bobcat calls,

4093
02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:43,661
wigs,

4094
02:08:43,661 --> 02:08:44,351
big fuck movie,

4095
02:08:44,351 --> 02:08:46,180
which is sensational.

4096
02:08:46,240 --> 02:08:47,350
It's amazing.

4097
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:48,850
You'll shit your pants,

4098
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,520
you're gonna be afraid to get out of
the car and take a leak if it's dark out

4099
02:08:51,850 --> 02:08:52,960
and you're near a patch of woods.

4100
02:08:57,710 --> 02:08:58,180
Look,

4101
02:08:58,180 --> 02:09:01,480
I don't know if big foot's real and I
know you don't know if big foot's right,

4102
02:09:01,660 --> 02:09:04,930
but I know that we both think
it's an interesting subject.

4103
02:09:05,200 --> 02:09:06,033
Why is that?

4104
02:09:06,370 --> 02:09:06,581
Well,

4105
02:09:06,581 --> 02:09:08,050
because it's a beautiful idea.

4106
02:09:08,051 --> 02:09:13,051
It's this idea of a being that is somehow
managed to evolve to a place past the

4107
02:09:14,081 --> 02:09:19,000
intelligence of chimpanzees and gorillas
and yet simultaneously has reached this

4108
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:23,110
harmony with nature and is living
out there and some kind of beautiful

4109
02:09:23,111 --> 02:09:25,540
primordial pagan state.

4110
02:09:25,700 --> 02:09:28,540
There's something really
wonderful about that idea.

4111
02:09:28,630 --> 02:09:30,100
It's like avatar depression.

4112
02:09:30,310 --> 02:09:31,143
Yes.

4113
02:09:31,210 --> 02:09:33,460
It's like a version of Avatar depression.

4114
02:09:33,490 --> 02:09:34,090
Yes.

4115
02:09:34,090 --> 02:09:36,490
Like when people went to
see that movie Avatar,

4116
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:40,360
when you see those noble
people who would never lie,

4117
02:09:40,361 --> 02:09:44,950
and although they may exhibit a little
bit of jealousy and they take that fake

4118
02:09:45,790 --> 02:09:49,510
Navi into their arms because they're
beautiful people and they get their

4119
02:09:49,511 --> 02:09:51,820
internet from a tree and
it comes down from this,

4120
02:09:51,830 --> 02:09:55,270
this have some sort of a wifi thing
where it's like the float and whatever,

4121
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:56,860
they can hide their tails.

4122
02:09:56,890 --> 02:09:57,251
Yeah,

4123
02:09:57,251 --> 02:09:58,030
exactly.

4124
02:09:58,030 --> 02:09:59,980
But there's something about
that that's wonderful.

4125
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:04,460
And one of the things that you and
I experienced is we went and we,

4126
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:09,180
we went to mount Rainier with the lovely
and talented cast and crew and we,

4127
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:14,200
we went up there and we wandered through
those woods and we went to a bunch of

4128
02:10:14,351 --> 02:10:17,800
different areas where people have
claimed to have seen Sasquatch before.

4129
02:10:18,160 --> 02:10:19,480
And the thing that's struck me,

4130
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:24,220
besides the fact that it was
unbelievably beautiful up there,

4131
02:10:24,250 --> 02:10:28,510
I have never been to the woods of the
Pacific northwest in my adult life.

4132
02:10:28,810 --> 02:10:31,630
I actually talked to my dad about it and
he said we went camping up there when

4133
02:10:31,631 --> 02:10:33,590
we were was when I was much,

4134
02:10:33,591 --> 02:10:34,100
much younger.

4135
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:37,190
I think I won like seven and I don't
remember it because apparently it was like

4136
02:10:37,191 --> 02:10:40,730
rainy and miserable and we hated it and
we got out of there like it wouldn't be

4137
02:10:40,731 --> 02:10:42,770
like the funnest place to go camping,

4138
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:45,530
but it literally is an,

4139
02:10:45,531 --> 02:10:46,011
I hate the word,

4140
02:10:46,011 --> 02:10:46,550
literally.

4141
02:10:46,550 --> 02:10:46,930
Sorry.

4142
02:10:46,930 --> 02:10:50,840
Used it really is like you're
stepping into another dementia.

4143
02:10:50,841 --> 02:10:51,590
Yes.

4144
02:10:51,590 --> 02:10:55,370
It's beautiful and it's
so rich with plant life.

4145
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:55,850
Yeah,

4146
02:10:55,850 --> 02:10:57,320
it's the plant life.

4147
02:10:57,440 --> 02:10:58,640
This is how you consider it.

4148
02:10:58,790 --> 02:11:00,550
Let's pretend that the,

4149
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:03,140
the salt lake is a blank slate.

4150
02:11:03,350 --> 02:11:04,183
Okay.

4151
02:11:04,340 --> 02:11:06,170
Salt Lake in Utah was that flat?

4152
02:11:06,171 --> 02:11:09,890
The flat plains or there's the
salt flats where they race cars,

4153
02:11:09,891 --> 02:11:12,080
they take cars and the going a thousand
miles an hour because there's nothing

4154
02:11:12,081 --> 02:11:12,371
out there,

4155
02:11:12,371 --> 02:11:13,204
but it's flat salt.

4156
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:14,073
Right.

4157
02:11:14,390 --> 02:11:17,480
If that's a flat plane and
that's a zero life environment.

4158
02:11:18,350 --> 02:11:19,183
The,

4159
02:11:19,610 --> 02:11:24,010
the rain forests of the Pacific
northwest is a 100% life environment.

4160
02:11:24,010 --> 02:11:24,410
Yes.

4161
02:11:24,410 --> 02:11:27,470
Every inch is taken up by plant life.

4162
02:11:27,620 --> 02:11:29,270
There's elk running across.

4163
02:11:29,450 --> 02:11:32,210
We stepped an elk shit
every other step everywhere.

4164
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:33,200
It was everywhere.

4165
02:11:33,470 --> 02:11:35,060
We were driving down the road.

4166
02:11:35,090 --> 02:11:36,530
Elk would just walk right in front of us.

4167
02:11:36,531 --> 02:11:38,570
These giant wild cows,

4168
02:11:38,750 --> 02:11:41,360
which are more related to
cows in the yard to a deer.

4169
02:11:41,361 --> 02:11:41,950
Actually,

4170
02:11:41,950 --> 02:11:42,531
she huge,

4171
02:11:42,531 --> 02:11:43,041
enormous,

4172
02:11:43,041 --> 02:11:46,160
four or 500 pound animals just
walking across the street.

4173
02:11:46,370 --> 02:11:49,050
It's a wild place to sit.

4174
02:11:49,070 --> 02:11:51,380
You have an accurate account on that.

4175
02:11:51,381 --> 02:11:53,450
Like what are you going up
there and measuring shit.

4176
02:11:53,570 --> 02:11:54,620
Who's going up there?

4177
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:55,011
You know?

4178
02:11:55,011 --> 02:11:56,990
Even though it's right next to Seattle,

4179
02:11:57,050 --> 02:11:59,420
even though it's 50 plus
miles outside of Seattle,

4180
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,880
no one's going into those words.

4181
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:03,373
No one.

4182
02:12:03,710 --> 02:12:05,900
And when you're there
and you take that in,

4183
02:12:06,230 --> 02:12:07,790
that's when you really
start considering it.

4184
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:09,620
You really started going with eight maybe.

4185
02:12:09,930 --> 02:12:10,763
Sure.

4186
02:12:10,860 --> 02:12:12,630
You know when I went out there,

4187
02:12:12,631 --> 02:12:14,790
I didn't realize how
dense it was out there.

4188
02:12:14,791 --> 02:12:14,931
I,

4189
02:12:14,931 --> 02:12:16,440
I had never considered that.

4190
02:12:16,680 --> 02:12:20,280
And when you see how dense it is
and how thick it is out there,

4191
02:12:20,670 --> 02:12:25,320
then you do start entertaining the idea
that there's the possibility that some

4192
02:12:25,321 --> 02:12:30,321
extremely endangered being could be
hiding out in these depths because people

4193
02:12:30,451 --> 02:12:31,440
aren't going to go into that.

4194
02:12:31,470 --> 02:12:35,100
What purpose do people have
for going into that stuff?

4195
02:12:35,130 --> 02:12:35,390
The,

4196
02:12:35,390 --> 02:12:40,390
I imagine that there's naturalists and
maybe hardcore hikers who are crossing

4197
02:12:41,220 --> 02:12:44,730
maybe point 10th of a
percent of that terrain,

4198
02:12:45,100 --> 02:12:45,860
if that,

4199
02:12:45,860 --> 02:12:46,380
if that,

4200
02:12:46,380 --> 02:12:46,890
yeah,

4201
02:12:46,890 --> 02:12:51,540
so in that way you could see how there
could be a being existing out there that

4202
02:12:51,541 --> 02:12:53,010
maybe hadn't been discovered yet

4203
02:12:53,730 --> 02:12:58,730
and when we sent the drones up into the
sky to like overlook the area and when

4204
02:12:59,371 --> 02:13:03,240
you put the goggles on and you could
see through the drones and you're flying

4205
02:13:03,241 --> 02:13:04,074
over the,

4206
02:13:04,290 --> 02:13:06,240
it's majestic.

4207
02:13:06,280 --> 02:13:06,510
Yeah.

4208
02:13:06,510 --> 02:13:08,460
I mean it is majestic.

4209
02:13:08,461 --> 02:13:11,580
It is unlike any place that I
have ever been to in my life.

4210
02:13:11,581 --> 02:13:14,430
I was humbled by the life.

4211
02:13:14,510 --> 02:13:14,760
Yeah.

4212
02:13:14,760 --> 02:13:16,320
Humbled by the plant life.

4213
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:20,460
There's something about the amount of
trees that you see up there in the density

4214
02:13:20,461 --> 02:13:20,641
of it.

4215
02:13:20,641 --> 02:13:22,020
All that is just like,

4216
02:13:22,050 --> 02:13:23,970
it puts you right in your place.

4217
02:13:23,971 --> 02:13:27,480
It just goes sit down
and look at this and you,

4218
02:13:27,481 --> 02:13:27,721
you,

4219
02:13:27,721 --> 02:13:29,100
it's almost like psychedelic,

4220
02:13:29,250 --> 02:13:30,680
like you walk into those forests,

4221
02:13:30,690 --> 02:13:34,530
it's almost the whole world
changes and when you're in there,

4222
02:13:34,650 --> 02:13:38,130
you might as well be in another dementia.

4223
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:38,910
Sure.

4224
02:13:38,910 --> 02:13:43,910
It's so not the human world and you
walk in and every hour or so you'll find

4225
02:13:45,961 --> 02:13:48,420
some shit on the ground
that a person left behind,

4226
02:13:48,660 --> 02:13:49,320
but you're on.

4227
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:51,450
Once you're cutting one path,

4228
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:55,200
how much are you dealing with
around you that you never see?

4229
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:59,760
If you lived up there in the
Pacific northwest for the
rest of your natural life

4230
02:13:59,761 --> 02:14:02,400
and just every day you just crossed a,

4231
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:07,320
a certain area off your list and just
walked up and down and up and down and you

4232
02:14:07,321 --> 02:14:08,160
made a grid,

4233
02:14:08,480 --> 02:14:09,040
you're,

4234
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:12,270
you're going to die
before you ever see true.

4235
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:16,050
Even a tiny fraction of the
woods that are around you.

4236
02:14:16,170 --> 02:14:18,210
And even with all the
logging going on up there,

4237
02:14:18,211 --> 02:14:21,300
it's not happening in every
single part of that area.

4238
02:14:21,301 --> 02:14:21,820
So

4239
02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:22,421
not only that,

4240
02:14:22,421 --> 02:14:25,210
I mean you'd want to make the argument
for us and intelligent animal being able

4241
02:14:25,211 --> 02:14:26,044
to avoid you.

4242
02:14:26,410 --> 02:14:30,160
How much easier is it to know you're
there then when you're chopping fucking

4243
02:14:30,161 --> 02:14:32,220
trees down with a saw that go,

4244
02:14:32,221 --> 02:14:33,054
right,

4245
02:14:36,180 --> 02:14:38,490
I'm listening for elk SnapID twigs.

4246
02:14:38,640 --> 02:14:39,031
Okay.

4247
02:14:39,031 --> 02:14:43,530
And I hear a fucking saw and I
smelled that stinky fuel burning.

4248
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:43,770
Yeah.

4249
02:14:43,770 --> 02:14:43,970
Uh,

4250
02:14:43,970 --> 02:14:44,181
if,

4251
02:14:44,181 --> 02:14:44,450
uh,

4252
02:14:44,450 --> 02:14:47,300
if a gorilla for whatever reason,

4253
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:49,700
got pushed out of a van
in the middle of Brooklyn,

4254
02:14:50,450 --> 02:14:53,900
it would stick out in
the most profound way.

4255
02:14:53,990 --> 02:14:58,490
It would within four seconds around the
entire world will be videos of a gorilla

4256
02:14:58,550 --> 02:14:59,383
in Brooklyn.

4257
02:14:59,510 --> 02:15:04,510
And the same way a human wandering through
the Pacific northwest with our stinky

4258
02:15:05,540 --> 02:15:10,540
perfumes and deodorants on smelling of
the cheese burger you just ate before.

4259
02:15:10,551 --> 02:15:11,360
You're weird,

4260
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:12,680
impotent little hike,

4261
02:15:12,910 --> 02:15:13,310
you know,

4262
02:15:13,310 --> 02:15:15,080
two miles into the wilderness,

4263
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:17,150
that would be so easy to avoid.

4264
02:15:17,151 --> 02:15:18,920
Creatures can already avoid us.

4265
02:15:19,070 --> 02:15:19,750
Anyway.

4266
02:15:19,750 --> 02:15:21,250
Cotton root beer farts.

4267
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:21,700
Yeah,

4268
02:15:21,700 --> 02:15:23,260
we're in doctor Scholls.

4269
02:15:23,320 --> 02:15:24,940
Bud Light in your backpack.

4270
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:27,220
Old Spice on your stupid armpits.

4271
02:15:27,221 --> 02:15:27,930
Yeah.

4272
02:15:27,930 --> 02:15:28,560
Yeah.

4273
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:31,440
This think of your tumor is
coming out of your mouth.

4274
02:15:31,530 --> 02:15:36,000
They smell that stupid fluoride
toothpaste you wash your face with.

4275
02:15:36,080 --> 02:15:37,370
So it'd be so we would,

4276
02:15:37,371 --> 02:15:40,040
we stick out like a sore thumb in that,

4277
02:15:40,080 --> 02:15:41,000
in that terrain,

4278
02:15:41,001 --> 02:15:42,170
even though our ancestors,

4279
02:15:42,171 --> 02:15:43,220
that's what we used to live in.

4280
02:15:43,221 --> 02:15:44,210
We were born into that.

4281
02:15:44,211 --> 02:15:46,730
It used to be where we were
born into that wilderness.

4282
02:15:46,731 --> 02:15:50,060
And there's something that happens when
you go out there under that wildness

4283
02:15:50,061 --> 02:15:53,450
where some mild little
shift happens to you.

4284
02:15:53,480 --> 02:15:53,811
You know,

4285
02:15:53,811 --> 02:15:57,410
there is something that happens in another
part of your mind begins to activate

4286
02:15:57,411 --> 02:15:58,221
when you're out there.

4287
02:15:58,221 --> 02:16:02,510
And I think that part of your mind that
activates is the part of the mind that

4288
02:16:02,511 --> 02:16:05,810
Sasquatch hunters use
when they hallucinate.

4289
02:16:05,811 --> 02:16:06,680
They're imaginary.

4290
02:16:07,370 --> 02:16:08,203
They see,

4291
02:16:10,550 --> 02:16:10,791
well,

4292
02:16:10,791 --> 02:16:13,400
unfortunately that might be
actually what's happening.

4293
02:16:13,670 --> 02:16:14,211
That's what's,

4294
02:16:14,211 --> 02:16:14,541
what's,

4295
02:16:14,541 --> 02:16:14,810
um,

4296
02:16:14,810 --> 02:16:19,810
that's what's the most messy part of
this situation is that you can't pick a

4297
02:16:20,751 --> 02:16:21,584
horse.

4298
02:16:22,070 --> 02:16:25,220
You don't want to be the
guy that says no Sasquatch.

4299
02:16:25,221 --> 02:16:27,260
You guys are silly
because that guy's a dick.

4300
02:16:27,290 --> 02:16:27,770
Sure.

4301
02:16:27,770 --> 02:16:28,161
Okay.

4302
02:16:28,161 --> 02:16:29,980
And you don't want to be the guy that goes

4303
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:30,940
all Sasquatch,

4304
02:16:30,941 --> 02:16:35,260
bigfoot research centers of America
and gets it tattooed on your ass either

4305
02:16:35,530 --> 02:16:36,970
because that guy's a dick as well.

4306
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,190
I don't want to be a guy squatting.

4307
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:45,070
What does squatch what is,

4308
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:45,701
what'd you say?

4309
02:16:45,701 --> 02:16:47,250
Squatch was again when we were out there.

4310
02:16:47,290 --> 02:16:50,800
Watch is then a name for the uh,

4311
02:16:50,830 --> 02:16:55,830
dried semen that accrues and the
hair and the beard hair truckers.

4312
02:16:56,101 --> 02:17:01,101
You've been hanging out at truck
stop glory holes called squad.

4313
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:03,470
Oh,

4314
02:17:03,470 --> 02:17:04,303
I shit.

4315
02:17:04,610 --> 02:17:06,640
And then you got some squats
and your beer brother.

4316
02:17:06,641 --> 02:17:10,570
He's the reason why the hardcore homos
at truck stops only on mustaches.

4317
02:17:13,150 --> 02:17:13,550
Right?

4318
02:17:13,550 --> 02:17:16,030
Because we all know
the hardcore gay dudes.

4319
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:18,370
There's like three types of
people that have mustaches.

4320
02:17:18,371 --> 02:17:18,941
Mexicans,

4321
02:17:18,941 --> 02:17:21,270
John Stossel and hardcore
gay dude inhaler.

4322
02:17:21,310 --> 02:17:25,780
The kind of hardcore gay dudes that were
like leather biker hats and like cutoff

4323
02:17:25,781 --> 02:17:27,370
Jean shorts with Timberland's.

4324
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:28,690
Yeah.

4325
02:17:28,690 --> 02:17:29,523
Hardcore,

4326
02:17:30,090 --> 02:17:30,923
hardcore,

4327
02:17:33,330 --> 02:17:34,320
thick pasty.

4328
02:17:34,330 --> 02:17:37,780
They're trying to avoid squash and they
don't want to deal with Washington squat

4329
02:17:38,270 --> 02:17:38,680
beard.

4330
02:17:38,680 --> 02:17:43,060
It's annoying clumps up and
it smells like dried bleach,

4331
02:17:43,480 --> 02:17:44,141
burnt rubber.

4332
02:17:44,141 --> 02:17:45,100
When you wash it out.

4333
02:17:45,101 --> 02:17:48,130
Greg Fitzsimmons goes on stage in San
Francisco where we're doing San Francisco

4334
02:17:48,131 --> 02:17:48,964
together.

4335
02:17:49,180 --> 02:17:50,260
He goes on stage and he goes,

4336
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:52,210
you know what I love about San Francisco?

4337
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:54,830
He's still have real faggots.

4338
02:17:55,380 --> 02:18:00,380
I think it was real guys with like Jean
leather vest on but and cutoff Jean

4339
02:18:03,131 --> 02:18:05,230
shorts and that's hilarious.

4340
02:18:05,680 --> 02:18:08,770
Like the Blue Oyster
bar and police academy,

4341
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:10,600
there was a lot of gay
people in the crowd too.

4342
02:18:10,810 --> 02:18:11,461
And they,

4343
02:18:11,461 --> 02:18:12,370
they loved it.

4344
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:13,360
They were cheering,

4345
02:18:13,740 --> 02:18:14,110
you know,

4346
02:18:14,110 --> 02:18:14,470
and that,

4347
02:18:14,470 --> 02:18:18,220
that kind of stuff drives me crazy
because on paper or if you put that on the

4348
02:18:18,221 --> 02:18:18,760
Internet,

4349
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:19,990
people can get mad at him.

4350
02:18:20,290 --> 02:18:20,491
He could.

4351
02:18:20,491 --> 02:18:20,670
But,

4352
02:18:20,670 --> 02:18:24,430
but Greg Fitzsimmons is like one of the
least homophobic guys you will ever meet

4353
02:18:24,431 --> 02:18:25,000
in your life.

4354
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,570
Like he has a great story about wanting
to find out whether or not he was in the

4355
02:18:28,571 --> 02:18:29,920
gay sex when he was young.

4356
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:35,010
So he like got drunk and got up his
courage and then like found a guy and his

4357
02:18:35,081 --> 02:18:38,740
gay area that he knew and went to the
woods with them and then fucking panicked

4358
02:18:38,741 --> 02:18:39,574
and ran away.

4359
02:18:39,780 --> 02:18:40,070
He's like,

4360
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:40,903
I know,

4361
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:45,040
but like he's not even
remotely homophobic.

4362
02:18:45,041 --> 02:18:46,690
Like he's not afraid
of telling that story.

4363
02:18:46,691 --> 02:18:47,890
He's not homophobic at all.

4364
02:18:48,010 --> 02:18:50,050
So when he goes up there and says,

4365
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:53,680
I love San Francisco is
still has a lot of faggots.

4366
02:18:53,710 --> 02:18:54,100
Yeah.

4367
02:18:54,100 --> 02:18:54,850
And like they,

4368
02:18:54,850 --> 02:18:56,410
they like were clapping.

4369
02:18:56,590 --> 02:19:00,430
I saw a gay couple that
were like going there,

4370
02:19:00,660 --> 02:19:01,780
cause he was saying it was,

4371
02:19:01,810 --> 02:19:02,600
it was in,

4372
02:19:02,600 --> 02:19:04,450
within coming from anger or fear.

4373
02:19:04,451 --> 02:19:08,320
It's coming from an accurate
assessment of San Francisco.

4374
02:19:08,321 --> 02:19:09,154
And that's fine.

4375
02:19:09,190 --> 02:19:10,023
It's not a,

4376
02:19:10,030 --> 02:19:11,680
it's not a black or white issue.

4377
02:19:11,710 --> 02:19:12,370
Not to Hertz.

4378
02:19:12,370 --> 02:19:12,760
There's,

4379
02:19:12,760 --> 02:19:13,001
there's,

4380
02:19:13,001 --> 02:19:13,300
uh,

4381
02:19:13,300 --> 02:19:16,480
there's a lot of shit going on when you
say that word because a lot of shit,

4382
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:18,010
you can say it in a beautiful way.

4383
02:19:18,130 --> 02:19:22,870
And the way he was saying
it was describing a wild
looseness and an acceptance

4384
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:26,860
of homosexuality in San Francisco that
allows men to be really flamboyant.

4385
02:19:26,950 --> 02:19:27,783
Yeah,

4386
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:28,790
that's a good thing.

4387
02:19:28,850 --> 02:19:29,270
Sure.

4388
02:19:29,270 --> 02:19:30,170
That's a good thing.

4389
02:19:30,290 --> 02:19:31,880
So what he was saying was a good thing,

4390
02:19:32,060 --> 02:19:35,870
but that's what's pissing me off about
this current state of like criticizing

4391
02:19:35,871 --> 02:19:38,720
standup comedy is if it's a statement,

4392
02:19:39,190 --> 02:19:40,310
these are not statements.

4393
02:19:40,310 --> 02:19:41,990
We're saying we're saying wacky shit,

4394
02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:43,003
we're just talking.

4395
02:19:43,060 --> 02:19:45,710
What makes the thing offensive
is the energy behind it.

4396
02:19:46,010 --> 02:19:49,910
When you hear a fundamentalist
right wing Christian,

4397
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:51,740
say homosexual,

4398
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:54,260
it's the same way as when you hear a Nazi,

4399
02:19:54,261 --> 02:19:55,520
say the word Jew,

4400
02:19:55,521 --> 02:19:58,580
it comes out in this like sizzling.

4401
02:19:58,760 --> 02:19:59,240
It's like,

4402
02:19:59,240 --> 02:20:00,350
it's the sound of like,

4403
02:20:00,351 --> 02:20:00,591
you know,

4404
02:20:00,591 --> 02:20:05,150
and the alien when they kill the alien
and that acid drips through the metal,

4405
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:06,290
it's that same,

4406
02:20:06,470 --> 02:20:10,910
just vile is dripping hate homeless.

4407
02:20:12,590 --> 02:20:14,390
It's like all the hate inside.

4408
02:20:14,391 --> 02:20:18,710
That person is coming through the
window of the word homosexual and that's

4409
02:20:18,711 --> 02:20:19,430
offensive.

4410
02:20:19,430 --> 02:20:21,530
But when Greg Fitzsimmons says Faggot,

4411
02:20:21,830 --> 02:20:24,830
that's like somebody throwing
glitter in front of a disco ball.

4412
02:20:25,010 --> 02:20:28,760
There's nothing dangerous or
angry or pissed off as sweet.

4413
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,260
There's nothing bad about it.

4414
02:20:30,261 --> 02:20:31,580
And isn't it funny that when,

4415
02:20:31,850 --> 02:20:34,670
this is something that took a
while for humans to figure out,

4416
02:20:34,700 --> 02:20:39,440
but now there is a knee jerk reaction
that when someone rallies against

4417
02:20:39,441 --> 02:20:44,360
homosexuals is angry about homosexuals
as fighting off homosexuals.

4418
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:47,480
They're most likely k
100% k most likely gay.

4419
02:20:47,550 --> 02:20:49,730
Just so when did people figure that out?

4420
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:54,680
Was it 1980 I don't know
how it even happened.

4421
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:56,750
I think that's way more recent
that people want to admit.

4422
02:20:56,780 --> 02:21:00,470
I think the idea like was really
crystallized with Ted Haggard.

4423
02:21:01,220 --> 02:21:01,880
Sure.

4424
02:21:01,880 --> 02:21:06,170
When that guy got busted in
his gay prostitute friend
who likes to do math with,

4425
02:21:06,290 --> 02:21:07,430
went on CNN and was like,

4426
02:21:07,480 --> 02:21:08,313
that guy's crazy.

4427
02:21:08,490 --> 02:21:09,323
Yeah,

4428
02:21:09,970 --> 02:21:11,360
I might be a gay prostitute.

4429
02:21:11,361 --> 02:21:12,560
That doesn't mess with my clients,

4430
02:21:12,561 --> 02:21:16,220
but this guy's fucked up mind guys,

4431
02:21:16,400 --> 02:21:18,680
this guy's out there
fucking making mistakes.

4432
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:19,490
The weight,

4433
02:21:19,490 --> 02:21:22,970
the weight Christians come out of the
closet is they say they hate gay people.

4434
02:21:23,090 --> 02:21:25,280
That's how you know you're gay.

4435
02:21:25,370 --> 02:21:30,170
If you ever ever hear a Christian talk
about how bad it is to be a homosexual,

4436
02:21:30,171 --> 02:21:31,520
it's 100% you're like,

4437
02:21:31,521 --> 02:21:32,750
you poor bastard.

4438
02:21:33,260 --> 02:21:34,190
Just do it.

4439
02:21:34,340 --> 02:21:35,070
True,

4440
02:21:35,070 --> 02:21:35,903
true.

4441
02:21:35,970 --> 02:21:36,590
Yeah.

4442
02:21:36,590 --> 02:21:37,460
And who cares?

4443
02:21:37,610 --> 02:21:38,670
It's like the what?

4444
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:41,690
What's good about being gay is you get
to find out who's an idiot around you.

4445
02:21:42,050 --> 02:21:44,810
If you came out and you were gay
and some people got upset at you,

4446
02:21:45,170 --> 02:21:45,920
great.

4447
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:47,420
You found the idiots in your neighborhood.

4448
02:21:47,450 --> 02:21:47,661
Yeah.

4449
02:21:47,661 --> 02:21:48,790
Unfortunately for a lot of people,

4450
02:21:48,791 --> 02:21:49,970
if their fucking parents,

4451
02:21:50,150 --> 02:21:50,983
I mean when you,

4452
02:21:50,990 --> 02:21:55,460
when you look at when they post letters
on reddit where like people come out of

4453
02:21:55,461 --> 02:21:59,180
the closet and their parents write
letters saying you have to leave the house

4454
02:21:59,181 --> 02:22:00,410
and will never talk to you again.

4455
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:01,280
It's like,

4456
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:01,610
oh,

4457
02:22:01,610 --> 02:22:02,750
they got off light man.

4458
02:22:02,780 --> 02:22:03,611
If they had good friends,

4459
02:22:03,611 --> 02:22:04,221
they got off light.

4460
02:22:04,221 --> 02:22:05,054
I swear to God.

4461
02:22:05,300 --> 02:22:07,100
If my parents would
like that and I was gay,

4462
02:22:07,101 --> 02:22:08,450
I swear to got to be happy.

4463
02:22:08,810 --> 02:22:09,730
Now tonight,

4464
02:22:09,990 --> 02:22:10,670
right?

4465
02:22:10,670 --> 02:22:15,670
2013 at 45 you mean you escape from using
with mass holes in a certain point in

4466
02:22:16,671 --> 02:22:17,091
your life,

4467
02:22:17,091 --> 02:22:19,790
you have to realize that your family
is not just what you were born with,

4468
02:22:19,791 --> 02:22:20,050
Shit.

4469
02:22:20,050 --> 02:22:21,250
It's also what you accept,

4470
02:22:21,370 --> 02:22:23,690
what you bring into your world
and what you create when you,

4471
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:24,060
yeah.

4472
02:22:24,060 --> 02:22:25,350
When you're 14 right?

4473
02:22:25,380 --> 02:22:26,010
Of course and

4474
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:26,670
your worst.

4475
02:22:26,670 --> 02:22:28,650
Think about just just
think of the reverse.

4476
02:22:28,651 --> 02:22:32,190
I mean it's like if when
I was 15 and I knew that,

4477
02:22:32,250 --> 02:22:37,250
I told my parents that I loved
going down on this veiny albino and,

4478
02:22:38,470 --> 02:22:39,180
and

4479
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:40,340
I would like to thank that.

4480
02:22:40,341 --> 02:22:41,180
If you are my son,

4481
02:22:41,360 --> 02:22:42,710
I could work through that with you.

4482
02:22:43,370 --> 02:22:44,900
I would like to tell you that listen,

4483
02:22:45,170 --> 02:22:47,180
there's no perfection to this life.

4484
02:22:47,181 --> 02:22:49,880
And there's the beautiful thing about
life is it everybody likes something

4485
02:22:49,881 --> 02:22:50,510
different.

4486
02:22:50,510 --> 02:22:50,931
Okay.

4487
02:22:50,931 --> 02:22:51,980
And then everybody is different.

4488
02:22:52,130 --> 02:22:53,180
Some people have blue eyes,

4489
02:22:53,181 --> 02:22:53,951
some people love to suck.

4490
02:22:53,951 --> 02:22:54,490
Cock.

4491
02:22:54,490 --> 02:22:54,860
No,

4492
02:22:54,860 --> 02:22:56,030
I'm not saying sucking cock.

4493
02:22:56,031 --> 02:22:56,490
I'm thinking,

4494
02:22:56,490 --> 02:23:01,400
imagine if you as a child
knew that talking about you,

4495
02:23:01,730 --> 02:23:06,200
telling your parents that you like
licking pussy would get you thrown out of

4496
02:23:06,201 --> 02:23:07,040
your house.

4497
02:23:08,510 --> 02:23:09,680
Imagine the horror of that.

4498
02:23:09,681 --> 02:23:11,390
Like your entire sex drive.

4499
02:23:11,391 --> 02:23:11,750
Sure.

4500
02:23:11,750 --> 02:23:13,550
In a teenager you,

4501
02:23:13,551 --> 02:23:16,880
your sex drive is like you
have sclerosis explosive.

4502
02:23:16,881 --> 02:23:17,714
And to know that,

4503
02:23:17,870 --> 02:23:22,460
revealing that that Makin revealing
that mechanism to your parents could

4504
02:23:22,461 --> 02:23:24,350
actually get you banished from,

4505
02:23:24,680 --> 02:23:25,670
could make you homeless.

4506
02:23:25,860 --> 02:23:28,080
It's terrifying when you're 14 that's fun.

4507
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:28,711
It's terrifying.

4508
02:23:28,711 --> 02:23:30,030
But you know what the real problem is?

4509
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:33,270
Human beings have isolated
themselves into these much,

4510
02:23:33,271 --> 02:23:38,271
much more small and more
segregated communities.

4511
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,110
And we call them families,

4512
02:23:40,260 --> 02:23:40,501
right?

4513
02:23:40,501 --> 02:23:43,260
And we know we're not in a community
anymore that has a hundred people in it.

4514
02:23:43,261 --> 02:23:44,870
We're all going hunting together and,

4515
02:23:45,010 --> 02:23:45,360
and,

4516
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:47,430
and sharing festivities were on the fire.

4517
02:23:47,850 --> 02:23:51,000
Now we're in these communities where we
have tribes of like a very small group

4518
02:23:51,001 --> 02:23:51,960
at four or five people.

4519
02:23:51,980 --> 02:23:52,440
That's right.

4520
02:23:52,440 --> 02:23:52,651
You know,

4521
02:23:52,651 --> 02:23:53,580
my tribe is a,

4522
02:23:53,581 --> 02:23:54,570
I have three daughters in May.

4523
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:55,433
That's my tribe,

4524
02:23:55,440 --> 02:23:55,741
you know,

4525
02:23:55,741 --> 02:23:59,310
and I have friends who I allow into my
camp occasionally and we break bread and

4526
02:23:59,311 --> 02:24:00,990
then they go back to
their tents and that's it.

4527
02:24:01,020 --> 02:24:01,221
Yeah.

4528
02:24:01,221 --> 02:24:03,150
And that's the reality of modern man.

4529
02:24:03,570 --> 02:24:04,403
The old days,

4530
02:24:05,100 --> 02:24:05,491
people,

4531
02:24:05,491 --> 02:24:07,380
tribes up together and they got,

4532
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:07,741
you know,

4533
02:24:07,741 --> 02:24:08,071
50,

4534
02:24:08,071 --> 02:24:11,510
60 people and they got together and
they all knew everybody and they,

4535
02:24:11,511 --> 02:24:11,810
they,

4536
02:24:11,810 --> 02:24:16,810
they existed in these communities where
they all shared hunting duties and

4537
02:24:16,951 --> 02:24:19,080
cleaning duties and parental duties.

4538
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:21,810
And that was how people
lived a long time ago.

4539
02:24:21,811 --> 02:24:25,320
What were we really fucked up
as we removed accountability,

4540
02:24:25,650 --> 02:24:27,570
when we stopped being communal,

4541
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:29,700
we stopped being communal
in our child rearing.

4542
02:24:29,701 --> 02:24:31,320
We stopped being communal in our,

4543
02:24:31,321 --> 02:24:32,580
our our relationships.

4544
02:24:32,650 --> 02:24:33,483
Sure.

4545
02:24:34,260 --> 02:24:38,890
And that's where like bitch behavior
comes from to when you got a guy who like

4546
02:24:38,891 --> 02:24:43,891
starts texting your wife or
your girlfriend or you know
a girl you're dating and

4547
02:24:44,850 --> 02:24:46,590
says like stupid shit about you.

4548
02:24:46,770 --> 02:24:48,330
Like that's supposed to all be done.

4549
02:24:48,331 --> 02:24:49,290
Like out in the open.

4550
02:24:49,470 --> 02:24:49,640
Yeah.

4551
02:24:49,640 --> 02:24:53,040
When a guy starts sneaking around on
Facebook and saying mean shit about you to

4552
02:24:53,050 --> 02:24:53,520
somewhere,

4553
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:54,353
what is he doing?

4554
02:24:54,450 --> 02:24:55,890
He's revealing his wheat genetics.

4555
02:24:55,891 --> 02:24:56,700
He's a loser.

4556
02:24:56,700 --> 02:24:59,100
The guy's a bitch and the
girl will never respect him.

4557
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:00,000
What he's doing,

4558
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:00,241
he,

4559
02:25:00,241 --> 02:25:00,600
she's,

4560
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:01,470
she knows what he's doing.

4561
02:25:01,590 --> 02:25:02,700
She knows he's being like,

4562
02:25:02,701 --> 02:25:04,800
we can see creepy and Shitty,

4563
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:07,010
but they think we'll just
turn to tell you that goes,

4564
02:25:07,020 --> 02:25:07,950
doesn't appreciate you.

4565
02:25:08,250 --> 02:25:10,290
I know he does where he is with you.

4566
02:25:10,650 --> 02:25:13,920
I see that you're hurting on the inside
and then just want to look totally

4567
02:25:13,921 --> 02:25:14,754
platonic.

4568
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:15,930
I am your friend.

4569
02:25:15,931 --> 02:25:16,351
I mean,

4570
02:25:16,351 --> 02:25:16,750
I don't,

4571
02:25:16,750 --> 02:25:17,110
I mean,

4572
02:25:17,110 --> 02:25:20,010
you're very beautiful and I would
be honored if you ever be with me,

4573
02:25:20,011 --> 02:25:23,130
but I know you're known to be so friends.

4574
02:25:23,350 --> 02:25:24,670
This guy's an asshole.

4575
02:25:25,060 --> 02:25:26,070
Why does that Guy Exist?

4576
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:27,100
Because you can't go hunting with them.

4577
02:25:27,101 --> 02:25:30,820
And woopsie got hit by our streets beer
book now that he's supposed to take that

4578
02:25:30,821 --> 02:25:31,591
guy with you on,

4579
02:25:31,591 --> 02:25:31,820
on the,

4580
02:25:31,820 --> 02:25:33,430
the manly duties and throw him in a lake,

4581
02:25:33,431 --> 02:25:36,390
some white sand pits made
for that type of human.

4582
02:25:36,420 --> 02:25:40,030
That type of behavior is not supposed
to be fostered to the point where he's,

4583
02:25:40,070 --> 02:25:40,281
uh,

4584
02:25:40,281 --> 02:25:42,370
a member of society,

4585
02:25:42,371 --> 02:25:43,660
a trusted member of society.

4586
02:25:43,690 --> 02:25:45,460
But oftentimes in communities,

4587
02:25:45,610 --> 02:25:47,350
people deal with deceptive,

4588
02:25:47,740 --> 02:25:48,910
like traders,

4589
02:25:48,940 --> 02:25:52,390
traders of their friendship traders
of there because we've separated,

4590
02:25:52,391 --> 02:25:53,860
we've removed accountability.

4591
02:25:53,980 --> 02:25:58,090
You can shut your door and lock it and
just send the country email and everybody

4592
02:25:58,091 --> 02:26:01,060
has removed themselves
from this process of,

4593
02:26:01,630 --> 02:26:02,360
of community.

4594
02:26:02,360 --> 02:26:02,750
Yeah,

4595
02:26:02,750 --> 02:26:03,080
it's,

4596
02:26:03,080 --> 02:26:03,500
it's uh,

4597
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:05,210
it's amazing how are,

4598
02:26:05,570 --> 02:26:05,930
how,

4599
02:26:05,930 --> 02:26:08,600
how bad that is for our
continued evolution.

4600
02:26:08,601 --> 02:26:09,920
The fact that people like that,

4601
02:26:10,220 --> 02:26:11,053
um,

4602
02:26:11,890 --> 02:26:14,780
have any kind of impact
at all is pretty horrific.

4603
02:26:14,810 --> 02:26:16,940
And that's where Avatar
depression comes in

4604
02:26:18,280 --> 02:26:21,370
cause it shit doesn't exist in Avatar
and it doesn't exist in the squash

4605
02:26:21,371 --> 02:26:22,180
community either.

4606
02:26:22,180 --> 02:26:22,390
Right.

4607
02:26:22,390 --> 02:26:24,220
I don't think there's any bitch squashes.

4608
02:26:24,490 --> 02:26:26,110
I think squash is in my mind.

4609
02:26:26,170 --> 02:26:26,411
Okay.

4610
02:26:26,411 --> 02:26:29,410
Whether or not the real in
my world squashes are noble,

4611
02:26:29,620 --> 02:26:30,610
they're very smart.

4612
02:26:30,820 --> 02:26:32,380
They run after elk and they check them.

4613
02:26:32,410 --> 02:26:33,340
They probably choke them.

4614
02:26:33,400 --> 02:26:34,990
They'd probably get a
good strong rear naked.

4615
02:26:35,050 --> 02:26:35,261
Yeah,

4616
02:26:35,261 --> 02:26:36,490
I'd probably just break their necks.

4617
02:26:36,710 --> 02:26:36,900
Uh,

4618
02:26:36,900 --> 02:26:37,420
uh,

4619
02:26:37,420 --> 02:26:39,520
Alex probably made out of
Styrofoam compared to a squat

4620
02:26:39,580 --> 02:26:41,560
when we went squashing
one of those guys said,

4621
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:43,270
I liked what you said
that because it is true.

4622
02:26:43,780 --> 02:26:44,680
When we went squatting,

4623
02:26:44,740 --> 02:26:45,760
when we thought we went through,

4624
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:49,060
a few people can say that we went
squashing and I remember one of the,

4625
02:26:49,061 --> 02:26:53,170
I clearly remember one of our fellows
squashers our teachers squatters.

4626
02:26:53,350 --> 02:26:58,350
They said that the way the Sasquatch
hunts is it breaks the leg of the elk and

4627
02:26:58,661 --> 02:27:00,670
then after snapping it's leg,

4628
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:01,930
that's when it kills it.

4629
02:27:01,931 --> 02:27:03,550
I don't know why it doesn't
kill it all at once,

4630
02:27:03,551 --> 02:27:04,241
but it grabs,

4631
02:27:04,241 --> 02:27:08,320
it breaks its leg and then lets it kind
of pull itself through the wilderness

4632
02:27:08,321 --> 02:27:09,220
and then eats it.

4633
02:27:09,580 --> 02:27:11,770
That's the way the noble Sasquatch hunts.

4634
02:27:12,070 --> 02:27:16,270
It also can turn into a bird and it
also can sound like a leaf blower.

4635
02:27:16,390 --> 02:27:18,490
I can also tell you that that gentleman,

4636
02:27:18,491 --> 02:27:21,580
the same gentleman that told you that
story also told me that one time he was in

4637
02:27:21,581 --> 02:27:23,920
front of a blackberry
Bush and he heard a frog.

4638
02:27:24,220 --> 02:27:24,731
It was like,

4639
02:27:24,731 --> 02:27:25,090
read it,

4640
02:27:25,090 --> 02:27:25,541
read it,

4641
02:27:25,541 --> 02:27:26,200
and he said,

4642
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:30,040
now why would a frog behind
in a blackberry Bush?

4643
02:27:30,070 --> 02:27:30,431
And he goes,

4644
02:27:30,431 --> 02:27:31,530
you know what I thought about?

4645
02:27:31,550 --> 02:27:31,871
I was like,

4646
02:27:31,871 --> 02:27:33,040
that's probably a big foot.

4647
02:27:33,070 --> 02:27:33,580
Yeah,

4648
02:27:33,580 --> 02:27:34,150
sure.

4649
02:27:34,150 --> 02:27:35,710
So just say no.

4650
02:27:35,950 --> 02:27:36,783
Same Guy.

4651
02:27:37,240 --> 02:27:37,781
I came,

4652
02:27:37,781 --> 02:27:37,991
God,

4653
02:27:37,991 --> 02:27:41,290
there's some critical thinking right
there that it should be in the CIA.

4654
02:27:43,960 --> 02:27:44,770
I see.

4655
02:27:44,770 --> 02:27:45,940
Hear a frog.

4656
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:47,620
It's near a blackberry.

4657
02:27:47,621 --> 02:27:50,710
Bush must be an undiscovered
primate of enormous proportions.

4658
02:27:54,850 --> 02:27:55,511
Fucking shit.

4659
02:27:55,511 --> 02:27:56,260
It could be.

4660
02:27:56,260 --> 02:27:57,760
Maybe it's a crazy frog.

4661
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:58,960
Maybe it's a frog.

4662
02:27:58,961 --> 02:27:59,281
That eight,

4663
02:27:59,281 --> 02:28:01,870
a psychedelic mushroom doesn't
know what the fuck is going on.

4664
02:28:02,050 --> 02:28:03,580
He's hiding in bushes.

4665
02:28:03,700 --> 02:28:04,900
He can't even eat berries.

4666
02:28:04,901 --> 02:28:06,160
He's lying on his back.

4667
02:28:06,360 --> 02:28:06,860
He's,

4668
02:28:06,860 --> 02:28:07,480
he's,

4669
02:28:07,480 --> 02:28:12,480
he's flying on a rainbow glitter all
the way to Jupiter that he's a frog and

4670
02:28:14,231 --> 02:28:18,340
he's understanding space travel for the
first time and he knows that he's got a

4671
02:28:18,340 --> 02:28:20,500
couple minutes to go before the silicide
and leaves the system and then it

4672
02:28:20,501 --> 02:28:21,291
becomes a frog again.

4673
02:28:21,291 --> 02:28:22,460
Just what's around flies.

4674
02:28:22,730 --> 02:28:24,710
Can I make one point
real quick about this?

4675
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:30,100
I think squashing is the hiking
what renaissance fairs are to parks.

4676
02:28:33,770 --> 02:28:34,020
It's,

4677
02:28:34,020 --> 02:28:34,670
it's I,

4678
02:28:34,670 --> 02:28:35,503
how do I say that better?

4679
02:28:35,510 --> 02:28:35,690
No,

4680
02:28:35,690 --> 02:28:35,820
no,

4681
02:28:35,820 --> 02:28:36,370
no.

4682
02:28:36,370 --> 02:28:39,350
I just watch watching
in history to history.

4683
02:28:40,220 --> 02:28:44,570
I think squashing is to hiking what
renaissance fairs are to history.

4684
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:49,600
I think it's a way to turn hiking
into this exciting play time,

4685
02:28:50,271 --> 02:28:51,104
play time.

4686
02:28:51,350 --> 02:28:52,340
That's what it is.

4687
02:28:52,550 --> 02:28:54,650
I think that's what it is
as that you totally right.

4688
02:28:55,040 --> 02:28:56,000
I think you're totally right.

4689
02:28:56,620 --> 02:28:59,930
And I met with a guy named Scott
Nelson and he's a crypto linguist.

4690
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:00,681
In fact,

4691
02:29:00,681 --> 02:29:05,681
he worked for the US Navy for almost
20 years to ciphering languages and he

4692
02:29:06,891 --> 02:29:09,140
played me some authentic,

4693
02:29:09,680 --> 02:29:10,760
I'm doing air quotes.

4694
02:29:10,780 --> 02:29:11,060
Okay.

4695
02:29:11,060 --> 02:29:11,900
Authentic,

4696
02:29:12,890 --> 02:29:15,880
big foot language and I want to
play it for you because it's,

4697
02:29:15,881 --> 02:29:17,330
it's pretty fascinating stuff.

4698
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:18,313
He played me,

4699
02:29:18,380 --> 02:29:19,820
this is what's disturbing though.

4700
02:29:20,120 --> 02:29:22,940
He played me two very
different recordings.

4701
02:29:23,210 --> 02:29:26,390
One of them sounded like total
dog shit and I listened to it.

4702
02:29:26,391 --> 02:29:26,691
I was like,

4703
02:29:26,691 --> 02:29:27,650
does not a big foot.

4704
02:29:27,651 --> 02:29:29,210
That's a guy and he goes,

4705
02:29:29,211 --> 02:29:30,470
no person could make that sound.

4706
02:29:30,471 --> 02:29:30,920
I was like,

4707
02:29:30,920 --> 02:29:31,150
oh good.

4708
02:29:31,150 --> 02:29:31,341
We'll go.

4709
02:29:31,341 --> 02:29:31,911
We'll go there.

4710
02:29:31,911 --> 02:29:34,040
I made the sound like
I made the same sound.

4711
02:29:34,041 --> 02:29:37,160
It really did sound but he played
me another one that was called,

4712
02:29:37,161 --> 02:29:38,600
they call it Samurai chatter.

4713
02:29:38,650 --> 02:29:38,820
Okay.

4714
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:40,730
That is really weird.

4715
02:29:40,830 --> 02:29:44,360
Cool and I would love it if
once this show comes on the air,

4716
02:29:44,390 --> 02:29:45,710
I know a lot of you are going to be like,

4717
02:29:45,711 --> 02:29:46,850
this is fucking bullshit.

4718
02:29:46,851 --> 02:29:47,720
I can explain.

4719
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:52,900
I am a language expert and had some
very educated points about this,

4720
02:29:53,900 --> 02:29:56,330
this language that he had heard online.

4721
02:29:56,660 --> 02:29:59,900
Now he went into this a complete skeptic.

4722
02:29:59,930 --> 02:30:04,040
He had no idea that there was like a
big foot community out there and no idea

4723
02:30:04,041 --> 02:30:05,960
that people who are
scientists took it seriously,

4724
02:30:06,290 --> 02:30:11,030
but his son was doing a project and it
was playing him this big foot stuff and

4725
02:30:11,031 --> 02:30:12,390
him being in crypto linguistics like,

4726
02:30:12,440 --> 02:30:12,561
well,

4727
02:30:12,561 --> 02:30:12,951
wait a minute,

4728
02:30:12,951 --> 02:30:13,784
what is that?

4729
02:30:14,040 --> 02:30:14,450
Hmm.

4730
02:30:14,450 --> 02:30:17,660
And so he plays it and listens to it
over and over again and immediately

4731
02:30:17,670 --> 02:30:22,250
recognizes that this is a language and
that's where it gets weird because you're

4732
02:30:22,251 --> 02:30:23,840
talking about a guy who is a,

4733
02:30:23,900 --> 02:30:27,500
a real bonafide expert in human language.

4734
02:30:27,770 --> 02:30:31,700
He's an expert in phonemes and different,

4735
02:30:31,730 --> 02:30:33,000
different aspects of,

4736
02:30:33,001 --> 02:30:33,241
of,

4737
02:30:33,241 --> 02:30:35,510
of human language and
how to distinguish them.

4738
02:30:35,660 --> 02:30:37,880
So he's what's called a
crypto linguists was mean.

4739
02:30:37,881 --> 02:30:41,060
She would take a language that's an
unknown language and decipher it.

4740
02:30:41,180 --> 02:30:41,540
Okay.

4741
02:30:41,540 --> 02:30:43,730
So he listens to this and um,

4742
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:46,400
and he decides this is a real thing.

4743
02:30:46,430 --> 02:30:46,611
Like,

4744
02:30:46,611 --> 02:30:47,180
oh my God.

4745
02:30:47,180 --> 02:30:48,440
So he thinks that big foot's real.

4746
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:50,000
I'm going to play you
what he played for me.

4747
02:30:50,030 --> 02:30:50,540
Cool.

4748
02:30:50,540 --> 02:30:51,373
Chuck this

4749
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:56,810
who several years had a cabin way up
in the remotest parts of the Sierras,

4750
02:30:57,450 --> 02:30:58,320
northern California.

4751
02:30:58,980 --> 02:31:00,730
And he was there one time
with a friend and uh,

4752
02:31:00,810 --> 02:31:04,530
every evening they used to have
some absolutely bizarre noises.

4753
02:31:05,010 --> 02:31:05,180
Um,

4754
02:31:05,180 --> 02:31:05,561
cool.

4755
02:31:05,561 --> 02:31:09,180
So then they couldn't figure out what
the hell it was and I'm so they took the

4756
02:31:09,390 --> 02:31:12,330
tape recorder one time and
this is what the record is.

4757
02:31:12,390 --> 02:31:13,223
Listen to this shit.

4758
02:31:22,550 --> 02:31:23,970
It is very bizarre indeed.

4759
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:47,760
We decided to record the sounds fucking
weird that I was in a cabinet and I

4760
02:31:48,521 --> 02:31:49,354
heard that,

4761
02:31:49,420 --> 02:31:50,080
oh Jesus,

4762
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:51,220
my hair would Tommy.

4763
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:54,310
Why Low Creek Bobcat Goldthwait sticks.

4764
02:31:54,550 --> 02:31:55,900
People look into it.

4765
02:31:56,230 --> 02:31:58,110
They are very encouraged.

4766
02:31:58,111 --> 02:31:58,330
What?

4767
02:31:58,330 --> 02:31:59,990
This is more of this or is it more sounds.

4768
02:32:00,750 --> 02:32:01,240
These sounds,

4769
02:32:01,240 --> 02:32:03,310
scroll a little further ahead
and give me some more of this,

4770
02:32:03,730 --> 02:32:04,563
right.

4771
02:32:05,990 --> 02:32:06,823
Listen to this.

4772
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:16,940
So this is what he determined.

4773
02:32:17,180 --> 02:32:22,180
He listened to this and he listened to
the sounds and it was his expert opinion

4774
02:32:24,711 --> 02:32:27,940
that these are not sounds that
are created by a human bot.

4775
02:32:27,970 --> 02:32:28,490
Yeah.

4776
02:32:28,490 --> 02:32:28,760
The,

4777
02:32:28,760 --> 02:32:29,010
this,

4778
02:32:29,010 --> 02:32:32,210
the tone that this speed
of the pitch though,

4779
02:32:32,211 --> 02:32:36,800
the way that the language
is being like exhibited,

4780
02:32:37,190 --> 02:32:42,190
he believed that this is a language
but that it's not being used by a human

4781
02:32:42,531 --> 02:32:42,800
being.

4782
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:43,551
It sounds chimp,

4783
02:32:43,551 --> 02:32:44,900
like it does sound like,

4784
02:32:44,990 --> 02:32:48,260
it definitely sounds like
a gorilla mixed in with,

4785
02:32:48,500 --> 02:32:50,510
I see why they call it
Samurai it sounds like.

4786
02:32:50,750 --> 02:32:51,220
Yeah,

4787
02:32:51,220 --> 02:32:51,741
Asian.

4788
02:32:51,741 --> 02:32:53,810
Somehow there's something underneath it.

4789
02:32:54,140 --> 02:32:56,590
I would love to slow it
down and hear what it is.

4790
02:32:56,860 --> 02:32:57,551
Well he did.

4791
02:32:57,551 --> 02:32:57,971
He did.

4792
02:32:57,971 --> 02:32:58,840
He slowed it down.

4793
02:32:58,841 --> 02:33:00,220
And it's interesting that you say that.

4794
02:33:00,400 --> 02:33:05,020
He slowed it down from me and he broke
down very specific aspects of it that he

4795
02:33:05,021 --> 02:33:06,520
recognized as language.

4796
02:33:06,521 --> 02:33:07,354
And again,

4797
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:07,571
you know,

4798
02:33:07,571 --> 02:33:10,930
we're talking about a guy who
was a crypto linguist expert,

4799
02:33:10,931 --> 02:33:12,850
a language expert for the navy,

4800
02:33:13,210 --> 02:33:15,490
so he knows what he's
talking about and it is very,

4801
02:33:15,491 --> 02:33:16,360
very compelling.

4802
02:33:16,750 --> 02:33:18,310
I don't know where that came from though.

4803
02:33:18,390 --> 02:33:18,510
Right?

4804
02:33:18,510 --> 02:33:21,880
I mean they say that it was a bunch of
people in the Sierra Nevada's and they

4805
02:33:21,881 --> 02:33:22,714
recorded this.

4806
02:33:22,900 --> 02:33:27,900
All we're hearing is some really weird
noises that a language experts say sounds

4807
02:33:28,871 --> 02:33:30,070
like some sort of an animal.

4808
02:33:30,100 --> 02:33:30,933
Oh

4809
02:33:33,150 --> 02:33:33,550
no,

4810
02:33:33,550 --> 02:33:34,690
but you're not even close.

4811
02:33:34,710 --> 02:33:35,543
Oh,

4812
02:33:36,530 --> 02:33:37,090
there's,

4813
02:33:37,090 --> 02:33:39,610
there's some quality to it
that just doesn't seem human.

4814
02:33:39,640 --> 02:33:40,870
I might be wrong because,

4815
02:33:40,871 --> 02:33:41,440
look,

4816
02:33:41,440 --> 02:33:41,741
we've,

4817
02:33:41,741 --> 02:33:44,260
we've all seen people that are
impressionists that do things.

4818
02:33:44,261 --> 02:33:44,531
Do you go,

4819
02:33:44,531 --> 02:33:45,520
how are you doing that?

4820
02:33:45,550 --> 02:33:45,730
Right.

4821
02:33:45,730 --> 02:33:45,941
You know,

4822
02:33:45,941 --> 02:33:46,870
we've all seen that.

4823
02:33:46,900 --> 02:33:47,141
Yeah.

4824
02:33:47,141 --> 02:33:47,481
So it,

4825
02:33:47,481 --> 02:33:47,800
it,

4826
02:33:47,800 --> 02:33:48,633
it might be,

4827
02:33:48,640 --> 02:33:48,790
you know,

4828
02:33:48,790 --> 02:33:49,960
I can make a dog when your dog.

4829
02:33:50,050 --> 02:33:50,883
Yes.

4830
02:33:52,870 --> 02:33:53,703
Jesus,

4831
02:33:53,770 --> 02:33:54,600
that's a dog.

4832
02:33:54,600 --> 02:33:56,650
But it's not a doubt this don't do that.

4833
02:33:57,910 --> 02:34:00,160
We ever do that to your
kids when they're sleeping?

4834
02:34:00,190 --> 02:34:00,850
No.

4835
02:34:00,850 --> 02:34:01,683
How rude.

4836
02:34:02,170 --> 02:34:02,711
One time though,

4837
02:34:02,711 --> 02:34:03,730
when we were on fear factor,

4838
02:34:03,970 --> 02:34:04,511
there was this,

4839
02:34:04,511 --> 02:34:04,781
uh,

4840
02:34:04,781 --> 02:34:08,410
this group of people and they were
blindfolded and we led them into this,

4841
02:34:08,411 --> 02:34:08,561
uh,

4842
02:34:08,561 --> 02:34:09,251
this room,

4843
02:34:09,251 --> 02:34:11,080
or they didn't know what the stunt was,

4844
02:34:11,110 --> 02:34:13,240
so they couldn't see it
because it was a big wheel.

4845
02:34:13,420 --> 02:34:13,811
And you know,

4846
02:34:13,811 --> 02:34:15,250
they would have saw it
immediately and said,

4847
02:34:15,251 --> 02:34:16,084
what's the wheel for?

4848
02:34:16,210 --> 02:34:17,043
So they,

4849
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:18,060
him in blindfolded.

4850
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:18,790
So as they bring it in,

4851
02:34:18,790 --> 02:34:19,623
blindfold them and go,

4852
02:34:24,060 --> 02:34:27,660
they would shit their pants dirty fucks.

4853
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:30,610
So I don't know what a person can
and can't make with the noise,

4854
02:34:30,611 --> 02:34:33,430
cause I have to make some weird noises
with my boss and the guy from police

4855
02:34:33,431 --> 02:34:34,060
academy.

4856
02:34:34,060 --> 02:34:35,890
I perfect Winslow.

4857
02:34:35,920 --> 02:34:36,320
Perfect.

4858
02:34:36,320 --> 02:34:39,370
Colin's low could easily
do something like that.

4859
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:39,851
Yeah.

4860
02:34:39,851 --> 02:34:42,850
So you can't just say because
you're hearing some strange,

4861
02:34:42,851 --> 02:34:47,410
guttural orc like language that
it's definitely a big foot.

4862
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:49,990
That's something that could
easily be fake Dunkin.

4863
02:34:49,991 --> 02:34:52,210
There's only one way
to solve this problem.

4864
02:34:52,650 --> 02:34:53,020
Okay,

4865
02:34:53,020 --> 02:34:55,470
well you go to the
woods with me and go and

4866
02:34:55,770 --> 02:34:56,603
no,

4867
02:34:56,760 --> 02:34:57,520
come on

4868
02:34:57,520 --> 02:34:57,880
now.

4869
02:34:57,880 --> 02:35:01,740
So why would I deny
it's a dream come true.

4870
02:35:01,741 --> 02:35:02,331
I love to go.

4871
02:35:02,331 --> 02:35:03,150
Squatch all right,

4872
02:35:03,150 --> 02:35:03,480
let's go.

4873
02:35:03,480 --> 02:35:04,500
Squatch let's do it.

4874
02:35:04,530 --> 02:35:05,130
Let's do this.
