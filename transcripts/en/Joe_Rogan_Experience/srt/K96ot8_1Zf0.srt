1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:02,880
Rookie move.

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,340
Perfect.
Hey,

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,110
what's up?
Hi.

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:15,760
Everybody fucks going on the Joe Rogan 
experience podcast.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,980
Why do I have to say it?
I don't have to say the name of it.

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,260
I can now say this podcast,
this shit.

7
00:00:20,261 --> 00:00:23,080
You're listening to cost money for 
bandwidth folks,

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,250
and we're sponsored by the fleshlight,
but you know that.

9
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,870
You know I have to go through with this 
though.

10
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,040
Here we go.
Ready?

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:33,490
If you go to Joe Rogan.net
and click on the link for the flashlight

12
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,430
and enter in the code name Rogan,
you will get 15 percent off.

13
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,350
I know you're going to show that.
It's crazy.

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,540
You're right.
It is fucking crazy.

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,170
Lot of people don't even know what the 
fleshlight is.

16
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:44,120
I've been realizing every time I say 
flashlight,

17
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:45,720
they're like,
what is your flashlight like?

18
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,190
Somebody else just said it the other day
that Amy Schumer says the number one sex

19
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:49,830
toy for.
Yeah.

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,170
Oh,
she's playing stupid.

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,140
She doesn't know what a flush line is.
Get the fuck Outta here.

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,140
For people that don't know,
it's a sex toy.

23
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:58,790
It looks like a fleshlight.
I hosted the porn awards.

24
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:00,230
They were eggs at Simmons,
ladies and gentlemen.

25
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:00,380
Hi.

26
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,760
Here's a,
you know,

27
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,770
normally there's flowers in the middle 
of a big party and the you get to take 

28
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,100
the flowers home.
They had vibrators and flashlights.

29
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,490
So I had like,
of course I had like five buddies come 

30
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,651
out from La to be there and we all had 
one and we're running around in the 

31
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:15,651
strip clubs all night,
you know,

32
00:01:15,651 --> 00:01:20,090
using it like a pop it,
having fun with it and laughing about 

33
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:20,730
it.
And then the next day around noon,

34
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:21,740
I call his mom like,

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,360
you fuck it.
They're like,

36
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:23,840
yeah,
you fucking.

37
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:24,290
I'm like,
yeah,

38
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,840
I fucked it.
We all fuck it.

39
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,530
It was good.
Right?

40
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,770
Once you have it,
you're going to find,

41
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,780
especially if you've got some lube 
handy.

42
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,070
Oh you gotta have the Lube and a.
and then you got to have an exit.

43
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,470
You need an exit strategy.
Like if you're in a hotel,

44
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,240
what are you going to get?
You put it in your bag.

45
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:43,241
I carry on.
I didn't want that coming up for 

46
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:45,430
security.
I didn't want it in the trash because 

47
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,290
then the maid,
so I slipped it into the pocket of the 

48
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,170
bathrobe in the hotel to be discovered 
at a later day.

49
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,250
Perfect.

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,810
Did you just slip it out of its shell or
and it show.

51
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,580
The whole thing went in,
was right in there.

52
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,560
One one pack.
It's clean or not clean.

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,590
Why would I clean it?

54
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,590
Oh,
the dark things defined in a fucking.

55
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,570
You put your robot out of the shower.
Fucking you open it up.

56
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:11,270
It smells like a million dead fish.
And guess what you do then?

57
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:17,670
Well,
it good gentlemen endorsing the 

58
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,051
flashlight.
We were also sponsored by [inaudible] 

59
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:22,051
Dot Com,

60
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:24,310
makers of Alpha brain,
the cognitive enhancing supplement.

61
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,080
Ooh,
I've got to take mine before the show.

62
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,730
I don't want to be stupid.
Give me something.

63
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,700
That new one.
Okay.

64
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:31,090
I got the new one at home.
Up to bring it in.

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,780
This is the,
the old,

66
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,640
the old stuff.

67
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,790
Um,

68
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,040
see I just took two powerful cognitive 
much my sentences without flow better.

69
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,680
My mind will pick up placebo effect.
You say,

70
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,860
no,
I'm just that quick at breaking down 

71
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:51,860
gelatin tablets.
I know how to.

72
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,600
My body knows how to process that shit.
We also have a bunch of other 

73
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,250
interesting supplements for working out 
for immunity,

74
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,030
for,
for mood.

75
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:04,060
There's serotonin boosting,
five htp supplement,

76
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:07,240
a lot of cool shit and go to [inaudible]
dot com and you can check it all out o n

77

save 10 percent are right.

78
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Dirty freaks.
Probably my friend the longest in 

79
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,190
comedy.
Greg Fitzsimmons is here.

80
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,800
Hit it bitch

81
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,350
day.

82
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,220
That's a musical opening.

83
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,160
That's very important.
It's your real.

84
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,580
Greg and I started out probably within 
like a week of each other,

85
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,500
right?
Yup.

86
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,570
Back in Boston,
the old Boston stitches a comedy 

87
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,060
community,
you know,

88
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,530
and a dude.
We,

89
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:52,531
you and I have gone through some bucket.
We went to some crazy gigs in the 

90
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:52,531
beginning.
Man,

91
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:54,070
we,
we went through together.

92
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,570
We went through like the darkest time 
for standups.

93
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,780
Well the the early days.

94
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,320
Yeah.
We went through our personal dark.

95
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,400
It's the lightest time in comedy.
I see young comics today and my 

96
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:12,100
heartbreaks because they got to scrounge
up stage time.

97
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:13,210
You and I,
you know,

98
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,480
I would say,
but less than a year into doing standup,

99
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,780
we were driving out and making 50 bucks 
cash five,

100
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:20,620
six nights a week.

101
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,820
It was for me,
it was exactly one year.

102
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:27,821
I first got paid by normal a to open up 
for Warren Mcdonald.

103
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,680
He can garden,
I don't know where it was with some bar.

104
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:34,580
I was like an apple box.
Like literally like standing on an apple

105
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:36,590
box doing comedy.
You can't fucking move.

106
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,270
And uh,
you know,

107
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,310
I had a good time and then the next time
I looked for Lindy Clark,

108
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,640
those are two times in a row.
I got super lucky.

109
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:45,410
Normally fall like caught me or

110
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,720
well you motherfucker man.
It was like all of us were like,

111
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,910
there was this ascension.
You would go,

112
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,180
you'd wait in line to get a spot on,
on comedy,

113
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,580
open mic night stitches,
comedy club,

114
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:59,260
George Mcdonald,
welcome to comedy.

115
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:02,230
Hell where the jokes always die.
The convenia is,

116
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,370
was this whole thing.
And,

117
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,090
and we ran out of booze.
Comedy Hell where you can fly,

118
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,120
fly as high as the lights on Broadway or
crash and burn and the fiery pit known 

119
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:17,341
only as comedy hell and that was step 
one and then you and then you would get 

120
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:20,890
like a guest spot on a real show and 
then you would start to get these like,

121
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,920
you know,
25 to $50 Mc spots where you were 

122
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,621
driving the headliner somewhere and you 
jump past all that shit because they 

123
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:33,211
would send you out to feature and the 
headliners couldn't follow you because 

124
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:36,400
you were out of your fucking mind.
I mean you were nuts and uh,

125
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:41,401
and so they had to headline you.
So you started working like the d rooms 

126
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:41,401
but headlining.
Um,

127
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:44,530
so you started to get an hour together 
super fast.

128
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,910
Yeah.
I had to,

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
had to sink or swim those times when the
regular we'd make agreements to steal 

130
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:51,940
each other's shit.

131
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,610
We're bombing.
Say,

132
00:05:55,611 --> 00:05:56,990
dude,
you got my whole act.

133
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,820
If you're eating pick up there,
feel free to just had.

134
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,800
He would come back.
Do that.

135
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:05,030
Blow job jokes hills.
If you go back to peabody,

136
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,090
you might want to wait on.
Yeah,

137
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,260
he gave me.
He let the heat die out of that joke.

138
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,320
It was fun for us because we knew we 
would.

139
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:18,330
Neither one of us should.
There was a point in time where both of 

140
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,510
us were doing like middling gigs and we 
really didn't have the time.

141
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:21,730
We really didn't have a real solid half 
hour.

142
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,770
So sometimes you just.
When you were.

143
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,210
When you're a young comic and you slip 
in the beginning of your set,

144
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:30,610
like the odds of you pulling stuff out 
of the firearm.

145
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Oh yeah.
I remember one time I was having a good 

146
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:35,760
set and I knocked over a drink and I 
didn't address it.

147
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,700
That was it.
The audience turned on me,

148
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,450
does indeed smell blood.
They knew I was scared.

149
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:45,180
They knew I was.
I was killing it there.

150
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,670
It's all about their uncomfort and you 
denied.

151
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,880
I remember being on.
This was probably the cruelest thing 

152
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:53,880
anybody ever did to me when I was on 
stage.

153
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:53,880
It was like,
you know,

154
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,800
half filled room back.
It was always like the back of a Chinese

155
00:06:56,801 --> 00:07:01,801
restaurant where they had a banquet room
that they just put a microphone up and 

156
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:05,260
call it a comedy night and I'm up there 
taking it and I'm not acknowledging that

157
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:08,810
I'm tanking it and during one of the 
silences that should've had laughed,

158
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:12,190
rented after one of my jokes,
I heard this middle aged woman whispered

159
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:17,191
to her husband,
I could hear a whisper and she just 

160
00:07:17,191 --> 00:07:17,191
goes,
the poor bastard.

161
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,600
Oh,
worse than any heckle.

162
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,580
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

163
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,030
It is.
No,

164
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,660
it would be real hard when we'd watch 
each other.

165
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:38,661
You know,
you watch a friend eat dick in the 

166
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:38,661
beginning too because you know how 
devastating it,

167
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,100
you know,
there's some times where you know,

168
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:46,101
this guy is not going to pull himself 
out of this and he has 15 more minutes 

169
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:48,250
to go watch them.
Slosh through.

170
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,770
Is there a way out of it?
Do you.

171
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,920
What do you have to do?
Like,

172
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:54,580
do you just have to stop or do you just 
material?

173
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,850
That's where we come in.
That's where we'd steal.

174
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,780
I did a great job.

175
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,840
I knew that they were grenades that I 
had in my waistband,

176
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:06,060
Josie instead,
they would take the top off and lob it 

177
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,740
and you're back in the game.
We would help each other

178
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,890
time where I was headlining where I had 
no fucking business headline and there 

179
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,821
was no way.
I barely had 40 minutes and they were 

180
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:22,091
letting me headline these rooms and I 
would have to stretch it all out and if 

181
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:23,270
something went wrong it went wrong.
Hard hats,

182
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,790
there's no better motivation to creating
new material.

183
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:30,791
Then when you make those shows happen 
and you just fucking have to get to 

184
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,150
work,
like you need more weapons.

185
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:33,830
Man,
you went into weapons too quick.

186
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:34,760
You're up there dying.

187
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,050
Especially like you can do the hour when
it's going well.

188
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,840
You can take that one bit and you can 
stretch it out,

189
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:41,910
add shit to it.
You're,

190
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:46,911
you're,
you're doing improvisational jazz and 

191
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:46,911
that our fills out when they're not 
laughing,

192
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:50,650
all of a sudden it's like concentrate.
Everything shrinks down and now what you

193
00:08:50,651 --> 00:08:55,651
had as 35 minutes,
you just ripped through and 17 and now 

194
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:58,590
you're scared.
So you're tense and then you got nowhere

195
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:01,180
to go except the crowd.
So you start fucking with the craft.

196
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,720
They don't like you now did that,
that they don't like you,

197
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,900
you're not making them comfortable.
So there's not like a nice flow of 

198
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,810
energy.
And so yeah,

199
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:12,930
the early can feel it.
And the thing about Boston is,

200
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:16,080
and I think it was kind of unique to a 
lot of a common other comedy cities,

201
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:18,990
is it,
it is a punchline town.

202
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,800
It's Bam,
Bam,

203
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:21,590
Bam,
Bam.

204
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,750
You know,
they don't want to see something 

205
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:26,750
esoteric.
They don't want to see a storyteller.

206
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,770
They want you to grab them and just 
smack them around and then walk off 

207
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:30,770
stage with your hands in the air.

208
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:30,770
Well,
there,

209
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,120
there were guys that were doing it that 
we're so good at the best.

210
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,460
We came up with an error where,
you know,

211
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,550
I've talked about this 100 times on the 
podcast and people always go,

212
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:40,030
yeah,
yeah,

213
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:45,031
yeah.
We know that were really good comedians 

214
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:46,561
back then.
I don't think people even understand 

215
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:46,561
what a,
what a.

216
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:50,270
It was like a utopia.
Boston was like this standup comedy 

217
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,160
utopia.
There was at one point in time there was

218
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:53,590
five clubs in a tiny little area,

219
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,980
seven nights a week club.

220
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,900
I remember there was just that one block
of warranty warranty.

221
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,660
It was nick's comedy stop and then there
was duck soup,

222
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,910
comedy connection,
and then Mike,

223
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,960
Mike Clark had the comedy club and the 
Charles Play House above the company,

224
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,270
and then on the weekends you cut over to
Dick tardies,

225
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:11,380
comedy vault,
right over there,

226
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,420
two yards away.
It's craziness and then you get in your 

227
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,291
car.
He drove down the stitches on common 

228
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:19,291
APP.
It's like Holy Shit,

229
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:20,650
and the best part really was,
and those were for short sets.

230
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,930
You're doing five,
seven minutes with a big clubs.

231
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,000
Those were the big ones,
but then you and I would get,

232
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,860
and this is the thing people don't get 
today,

233
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,730
is that we would get it for a year.
We get either you get my car,

234
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,880
I get in yours.
We draft providence one night for a 15,

235
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:37,330
20 minute set for free all the time.
Then we go to Hartford one night,

236
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:39,490
then we go to worcester one night,
then we go to Maine.

237
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,390
One night we would go anywhere.
They'd give especially a longer set,

238
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,840
and then you know,
we were lucky enough to come up in a 

239
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,110
time where the word comedy in front of a
place drew a crowd.

240
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,140
You didn't need to have a big name.
They just were comedy crazy and we just 

241
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,701
happened to be dropped in the middle of 
it in a city that was a closed system.

242
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,350
They didn't have headliners come in from
out of town,

243
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,560
so the local,
there were four or five big local 

244
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,740
headliners that drew and the and the 
club's.

245
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:11,830
Otherwise they only booked based on do 
you crush?

246
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,600
Are you funny?
Are you original?

247
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,720
So it was a meritocracy and no one ever 
thought they were going to get famous 

248
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,420
there.
What career,

249
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:24,570
if someone used the word career,
people would have looked at them 

250
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:24,570
confused,
like,

251
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:24,570
what are you talking about?

252
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,020
All anyone wanted to do was become a big
Boston comma.

253
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:32,410
It's like the fame that you wanted was 
just the being accepted amongst your 

254
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:32,960
peers and having crowds coming to see 
you.

255
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,650
That's it.

256
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,730
Never really expect to see you.
I think wasn't until later.

257
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:39,300
I think for us it was just,
I can't.

258
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:44,550
It's like,
you know when your first fucking a girl 

259
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,890
and you can't believe she's letting you 
fuck her after jerking off for three 

260
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,190
straight years.
That's what it was like when I was doing

261
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:53,191
standup in Boston.
They're allowing me these stages that 

262
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:53,980
I've watched since I was a teenager in 
awe.

263
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,890
All the sudden I'm on it and they're 
letting me talk.

264
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,720
That was it.
That's all I needed.

265
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,110
You know,
one of the first guys I ever saw do a 

266
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,420
live set was tom cotter.
Tom Cod is one of the first guys.

267
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:10,470
He's a buddy from Boston is a great guy 
and he was in like some sort of.

268
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,880
The first time I ever went on some sort 
of an open mic night and,

269
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,820
and he was like the first guy that 
everyone on stage.

270
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,170
I remember that.
I swear to God,

271
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,530
same thing.
He was like a not.

272
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,100
He had started maybe two years ahead of 
us.

273
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:28,160
That guy,
he always used to bum me out and the 

274
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,060
reason we used to bum me out because he 
was so fucking funny to hang out with,

275
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:34,410
but he wanted to take it down a notch 
and he wanted to like,

276
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,290
oh,
maybe,

277
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,290
maybe I shouldn't go so dirty.
Maybe I should.

278
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,810
And you wanted to go do.
That's you when you're at your best,

279
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:40,680
you're a pervert.

280
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,060
They twist the crazy twisted.
He is one of the most twisted dudes and 

281
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:48,660
I don't want to.
I'd rather have him on.

282
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:51,660
We should have him on and do it together
because his stories,

283
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,230
the shit that he would do.
I,

284
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,550
I can't,
I can't say it on the air,

285
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,180
what I can say anything on the air,
but the Shit Tom cotter did,

286
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,730
it was one of the first guys I know that
would walk around with his balls hanging

287
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:08,731
out of his pants.
One of the first guys like no one was 

288
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:11,491
doing that back when we were 20.
We were like 21 or whatever the hell we 

289
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:11,491
were.
And Tom Clark is walking around with his

290
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,170
balls hanging out of his pants.

291
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,380
Jesus man,
it'd be a Christmas party and all the 

292
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,080
comics were there and he and he would 
have the hands on his hips still.

293
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,640
It wasn't like he was hiding.
Oh No.

294
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,350
And I remember at one point we were at 
somebody's house and there was a dog.

295
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,820
It was a oliver's dog and it was a,
he had rescued one of those greyhounds.

296
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,410
I think Tom was putting a dill pickle up
its ass in the middle of the party.

297
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,650
Like we were both beyond children.
We were like,

298
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,120
fucking.
We were like a collection of bad kid.

299
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,620
It was the part of the fun of having a 
guy like Tom cotter too,

300
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:46,930
is because you knew that he would like,
do something like that.

301
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,980
You knew he would want up things.
You knew if there was a bunch of comics 

302
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,280
hanging around,
Carter would find a way to make 

303
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,121
something fucked up.
I always felt like he kind of pulled 

304
00:13:57,121 --> 00:13:57,121
back on stage though,
you know.

305
00:13:57,121 --> 00:13:57,390
Well,
he,

306
00:13:57,391 --> 00:13:58,230
yeah,
he um,

307
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:02,190
in terms of practical jokes and like 
guys like Kevin Knox May,

308
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:07,191
he rest in peace was one of those guys 
just so fucking funny offstage and so me

309
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,620
cotter a Nazi or working at a place in 
Maine called the laughing lobster which 

310
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,600
started to have slow business and 
suddenly burnt down in the middle of a 

311
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,590
wet summer.
And so we're up there and we're staying.

312
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:21,450
There's a condo complex that we're 
staying at,

313
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:26,451
which was pretty upscale and they got a 
pool and I was all these hot fucking 

314
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:28,220
chicks from Montreal to come down to 
that part of Maine.

315
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,660
So we go,
we're going to go down to the pool and I

316
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,830
don't have my bathing suit.
And they're like,

317
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:33,390
fuck it,
you got boxer shorts.

318
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:38,391
She was wearing boxer shorts down.
So they head down and I walked down to 

319
00:14:38,391 --> 00:14:38,760
the pool.
I opened the gate and I walk in and it's

320
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:43,761
packed in there on the far end of the 
pool and I make it about halfway down 

321
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:43,830
the pool and they both stand up and 
start screaming.

322
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,800
Greg,
what are you doing in your underwear?

323
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:52,010
The whole FEC rules,
red faced set me up the whole.

324
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,210
This is a funny thing.
There is,

325
00:15:03,211 --> 00:15:05,940
it's a fucking distinction between,
you know,

326
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:11,130
a pair of shorts and boxer shorts.
It's just the thickness of the cloth at 

327
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:11,130
that point.

328
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:11,460
Well,
it's the same thing of like,

329
00:15:11,461 --> 00:15:13,620
you see women in bikinis on the beach 
all the time.

330
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,480
It's fine,
but you seem an underwear.

331
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,120
You lose your shit.
Oh my God.

332
00:15:18,121 --> 00:15:20,250
I saw,
you know Natasha Leggiero.

333
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,310
Yes.
She was on my podcast last week and she 

334
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,560
asked me to do.
She does a shell at Largo,

335
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,280
which is like,
you know,

336
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,760
one of those hipster Tasha and friends.
And so,

337
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,630
uh,
so she brings me out.

338
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,840
She's about to bring me on.
She goes,

339
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:38,841
I got to just got to change outfits.
She was putting on some kind of costume 

340
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:38,841
for this bit.
So she goes in the next room,

341
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:43,560
but there's mirrors everywhere and I can
see her and she gets down to a thong and

342
00:15:43,561 --> 00:15:46,440
like those little things that holds you 
tense up underneath.

343
00:15:46,441 --> 00:15:47,710
You sat there and watched.
No,

344
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,570
I swear to God I was going over my notes
and it was like bing,

345
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:56,571
bing,
bing off the mirrors and I got a 

346
00:15:56,571 --> 00:15:58,220
complete shot and just stroke,
beautiful body taking a photo and I 

347
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:00,210
stroke on it.
Can you imagine

348
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,150
get a lock her.
You were just grabbing your own balls.

349
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,610
Real weird.
Only work in the head.

350
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,630
A lot of twisty shit on the head.
Go overhand on it.

351
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,200
A lot of weird twisty shit on the head.

352
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,790
Yeah.
As spitting on it.

353
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:21,190
And so then so then she brings me on and
of course I have to say it in front of 

354
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,081
the theater.
I just saw her in her underwear and I 

355
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:24,420
can't really speak and so she came on my
show and I was just like,

356
00:16:24,421 --> 00:16:25,050
yeah,
it's weird.

357
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,090
I mean if it had been a bathing suit,
it wouldn't have struck me,

358
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:32,091
but seeing somebody,
especially my favorite thing is strip 

359
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:35,391
clubs do nothing for me,
but if I happen to see a woman naked 

360
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:35,550
through window and an apartment,
it,

361
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,360
nudity doesn't get better than that.
He has to be found like Voya nudity.

362
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,350
Yeah.
Brian,

363
00:16:40,351 --> 00:16:43,080
don't you have a same thing like were 
watching the amateur porn?

364
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,210
I can't even do regular porn because I 
know there's like five camera men in 

365
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:48,210
there.
I'd rather have like,

366
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,140
like stolen laptop porn,
you know,

367
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:53,460
where it's or like ex boyfriend getting 
revenge by sitting out photos and videos

368
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:55,350
of like his ex girlfriend and that's 
what I need.

369
00:16:55,351 --> 00:17:00,351
I need realistic.
Same reason why I can't watch like a TV 

370
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:00,660
show at the laugh track.
I feel like it's fake,

371
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,340
you know,
like of course we'll have

372
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,720
the new,
my new favorite porn which is the 

373
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:07,720
casting couch stuff.

374
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,250
Casting couch.
But you can't even believe that,

375
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,200
you know,
it's not.

376
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,830
That is not fake because they'll say it 
to greg.

377
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,730
There's two moments.
Moments

378
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,790
I look for.
All right.

379
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,010
One is the hello when they come in,
I want to see if there's a cause.

380
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Look,
I studied acting and we spent fucking 

381
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,201
six months on answering a door in a 
scene and how you react to not knowing 

382
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:29,700
what's on the other side of the door,
opening it and then is it real.

383
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,650
I look for that and then the moment that
it goes from I'm here to do like a,

384
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:37,500
you know,
a topless photo shoot too.

385
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,930
He says,
I want you to suck my Dick.

386
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:40,860
It's always,
you know,

387
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,230
you'll make a thousand to $5,000
a day.

388
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:44,750
I'm the producer.
I make the tape,

389
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:46,350
I send it to the buyers,
you know,

390
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:51,351
it goes through me.
We want to see if you can follow 

391
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:51,351
direction.
And the girls,

392
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:51,351
she's online.

393
00:17:51,351 --> 00:17:51,390
She wants a job too.
Here's the money.

394
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:56,391
All the sudden the fucking morality goes
way down and then the moment always 

395
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:58,200
builds to where he goes,
now I want you to suck my dick.

396
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,530
And you see them go fucking vacant.
You see their eyes just go like what?

397
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,800
And I'm telling you.
And you know what those real.

398
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:12,801
They have to have sex test before,
like std tests before they have to have 

399
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,250
paperwork.
They have to have a location shoot,

400
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:18,030
but given by the city to have a permit 
to shoot in Arizona.

401
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,860
Yeah.
But they still have to have tests.

402
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,840
Notes,
friend.

403
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,360
My friend is the head of,
in the Health Department of,

404
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:25,710
uh,
of California.

405
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,610
He,
the,

406
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,500
he's the head of stds and they've been 
fighting,

407
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:33,501
you know,
they had a big breakthrough last week 

408
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:33,501
where they have to wear condoms and in 
La county now,

409
00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:35,520
how could you call that a breakthrough 
because it's a workplace.

410
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:40,521
People should not die of AIDS in a 
workplace that's legal and it's more 

411
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:45,321
realistic that they're wearing condoms.
That's what I feel that they're allowed 

412
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:46,860
to take it off and still do the khaki 
shots to the face.

413
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:49,390
They can freestyle.
That doesn't give you a right?

414
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,980
I don't think so.
Would you take aids written loads on 

415
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:54,980
your face?
Um,

416
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,770
it depends on the,
if the guy was white or black,

417
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,930
there's a couple of,
there's a couple of things you've 

418
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,460
located before the white black thing.

419
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah,
I mean that's the thing.

420
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,070
Put your money where your mouth is,
you know,

421
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,180
it seems.
I mean,

422
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:23,181
look,
I absolutely agree with testing and all 

423
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:25,431
that stuff,
but I don't want to watch porn and 

424
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:25,431
lester not wearing a condom.
Sorry,

425
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:26,790
I something gross.
Maybe I'm disgusting.

426
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,250
If they're going to do a test for me to 
feel good about porn,

427
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,740
I want to know that her parents are no 
longer living.

428
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,950
I don't want to know that there's a day.
I don't want to.

429
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:40,010
I don't want to know that there's a dad 
out there that might see this on the 

430
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,510
bluffs thing.
I want to know is that she's doing 

431
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:42,510
because she didn't have the love of her 
parents and the parents are dead.

432
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,590
That's the first thing I'm going to 
think of.

433
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,420
And then it's a boner killer right 
there,

434
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:46,820
son.
Yeah,

435
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,860
but do you want to be thinking that 
while you're jerking off,

436
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:52,200
her dad's jerking off finds the clip.

437
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,990
Can you imagine jerking off and then 
your daughter pops up?

438
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,600
That would be.
Is that a suicide moment?

439
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,580
There was a.
What was the.

440
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,560
Cause you've already got the erection.
It's not like you stumbled on it.

441
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:06,480
Flacid.
So you're rock hard.

442
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,600
You change clips as we do and then and 
then it pops up your daughter naked 

443
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,100
having sex.
You've got an erection.

444
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,920
You Dick's probably in your hand.
Suicide moment.

445
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,840
Oh No,
no.

446
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:22,080
You just stopped beating off.
Why would you do that?

447
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,720
That was his daughter's supposed to be 
like,

448
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,890
Yo,
go,

449
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,480
listen.
I just learned some disturbing news and 

450
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,491
as soon as I get rid of this load,
you've got to prioritize right back on 

451
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:35,530
it.
You will look at,

452
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,520
this doesn't have to stock.
This is boulder.

453
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,490
What's been achieved?
A boner.

454
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,930
That's the cheap should be released.
So you're staying open a new window.

455
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,930
Minimize that one.
Come back to it just because you know 

456
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,110
you're addicted and make the mistake.
Your daughter made the mistakes.

457
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,420
She'll give you digital medicine.
Interesting.

458
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,230
Your Dick is really more important than 
your daughter.

459
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,180
Could you imagine if you just kept going
like,

460
00:20:58,181 --> 00:20:59,440
God damn it,
I'm gonna yell at her.

461
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,300
Oh yeah,
I've got our Jello.

462
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,310
Accentuates your orgasm because now you 
get mad at somebody.

463
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,830
What have you came and it was your best 
orgasm ever.

464
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,590
You realize,
and it's the kind of nirvana that if you

465
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:16,591
can't get back to it,
you don't know what you're chasing the 

466
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:18,841
dragon.
You got to keep chasing that dragon 

467
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:20,600
dragon's your daughter.
What would you do in your daughter shot,

468
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:21,610
but you can only be shocked

469
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,660
by at once unless you just became a 
freak and you were into watching your 

470
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:26,660
daughter.
You're fucked.

471
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,410
That's like the seventies porn movies.
It was always like the preacher dad and 

472
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,280
his daughter.
They used to go fucking like,

473
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,650
do you watch Dave's old porn at all on 
showtime.

474
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:39,651
David tells you haven't seen it.
It's him watching classical porn with 

475
00:21:39,651 --> 00:21:43,041
the actress from it.
And I watched one of them and it was 

476
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,861
like it was a preacher dad and he ends 
up hitting on his daughter and seducing 

477
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:50,541
her and then they fuck.
And that's what a lot of those movies 

478
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,911
where they were really at a pole and 
there was a lot of like rapey stuff and 

479
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:53,520
repeat.
Yeah.

480
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,120
Rapey not full on rate.
Yeah.

481
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:02,770
Yeah.
It's interesting how times have changed 

482
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,800
when it comes to treating women.
Like there was something,

483
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,040
I was watching that j Edgar Hoover show 
the movie rather with Leonardo Dicaprio.

484
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:17,170
Pretty good movie.
But one of the most interesting aspects 

485
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,631
of it as how the g man before the g man 
became like the symbol that everybody 

486
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:23,741
wanted to achieve and everybody wanted 
to be at Gmail is young kids growing up 

487
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:26,150
before it was like James Cagney playing 
like these gangsters,

488
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,420
white hate anyone always like smushed 
something in the girl's face or slapper 

489
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,950
in the phase and like,
hey guys would be laughing.

490
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,790
And I was like,
yeah,

491
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:39,791
like look at all the violence that they 
would do to women who have like regular 

492
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:42,600
women would say something crazy and they
went to the moon.

493
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:47,630
Everybody was cool with it.
It's like they were the men that were 

494
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:47,630
taking control.
The situation.

495
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:47,850
Like she needed a smack right there.
Yeah.

496
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,210
She had something like you were helping 
her.

497
00:22:50,211 --> 00:22:51,770
She was,
she had lost it.

498
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:54,770
They were helping her get back.
Like I remember something quiet man with

499
00:22:54,771 --> 00:22:57,560
John Wayne.
Remember there was like his wife was a,

500
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,410
his brother was supposed to give him a 
dowery and he didn't.

501
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:05,560
And he fucking drags through the fields 
by her hair slapping her and the crap 

502
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,050
towns cheering and you're watching.
And it's like a feel good movie and 

503
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,191
you're like,
happy that he's finally standing up to 

504
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,620
his wife and Christ.
Do you remember high plains

505
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,680
drifter when he raped the chicken barn?
John Wayne,

506
00:23:16,681 --> 00:23:19,170
Clint Eastwood,
Clint Eastwood rape the Chicken Barn.

507
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,820
And it's like the way he treated her,

508
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,020
that's what guys used to do would hold a
girl down,

509
00:23:24,021 --> 00:23:27,380
pull her pants down and just fucker.
If they could get away with it,

510
00:23:27,381 --> 00:23:29,570
if no one was around,
that is what they would do.

511
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,650
It occurred to me the other day.
Are we the only species that doesn't 

512
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,480
just.
Yeah,

513
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,200
I mean,
is there.

514
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:39,700
Is there sex between any other animals 
that's consensual or is it all over?

515
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,140
Is there's one animal.
I can't remember what it is right now.

516
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,660
Sure.
Coursers.

517
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,130
We're get fucked.
I mean they

518
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,130
do in our study too.
They just don't want to get fucked by 

519
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:51,130
all the men.
Hence the problem.

520
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,701
The problem is that there's judgement.
The problem is that it's not that that 

521
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:57,850
people in this I don't want to fuck.
Can't find people on that side willing 

522
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:57,850
to fuck.
That's not what it is.

523
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,690
Just there's a lot of judgment going on.
People were deciding,

524
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:01,460
now I don't like,
you know,

525
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:03,200
I don't want you.
They want some Dick.

526
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:05,540
They just don't want your Dick.
And that gets people angry.

527
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,280
Hence the rapey.

528
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,430
Wow.
So it's sociological.

529
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:10,510
It's not biological.

530
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,240
There's this biological and sociological
what it was purely biological.

531
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:17,960
It could all be cured with masturbation.
There's a sociological aspect to it that

532
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:20,450
women are not attracted to you and you 
get angry.

533
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,060
You want to force yourself on them 
because it's what you want.

534
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,790
You want them to want you to fuck them.
They don't want to fuck you.

535
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,800
You're gross.
Your gross to them.

536
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,570
So whoever we were talking about the 
rapist,

537
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,920
you're not a rapist.
No,

538
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:34,030
no,
no.

539
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,450
So I think,
you know,

540
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:39,760
it's,
it's more psychological and sociological

541
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:42,260
than it even is physiological unless.
Yeah,

542
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,760
yeah.
Well that's not rape.

543
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,850
If you like holding a girl down with 
your stubs and you're fucking her.

544
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,800
You heart.
Yeah.

545
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,840
You can't masturbate.
So this is the only reason you're just 

546
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:55,840
like,
look,

547
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:55,840
this is,
I don't want to rape anybody,

548
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,380
but I got to do what I gotta do.
I gotta think you

549
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,670
right by a guy with no arms.
Were you really trying not to be raped?

550
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,080
I bet you there's a lot of dudes with 
norms that could rape the fuck out of 

551
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,620
you.
Real strong ones like farmhand guys,

552
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,920
just to stubs.
Just a big guy with a thick thighs.

553
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,930
God knows how to Pitney Down with his.
Wait,

554
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:20,050
wait,
does he put his Dick in me or they are 

555
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,630
everything.
Whatever the arm is just loosening your 

556
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,270
asshole up for his car because that's 
how big his car.

557
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,140
Good,
how about that?

558
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,960
See,
it's a terrific movie.

559
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,710
You think,
well,

560
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:31,320
this guy is going to use this to.
Oh Shit.

561
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,110
He's gonna ruin it for the,
uh,

562
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,120
the penis and you're not looking back.
You don't know if it's the arm of the 

563
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Dick.
You don't even care.

564
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,610
You're milking a cow.
You just loving it.

565
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,100
Just so happy that you're not in your 
mom's care anymore.

566
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,240
So I love this summer outreach programs.

567
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,310
No,
but it's a.

568
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,500
It is interesting though because uh,
that was the whole feminist movement was

569
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:57,501
saying that rape was a crime of power 
and not a crime of biology,

570
00:25:57,601 --> 00:26:02,601
but then kind of now the new thinking on
it by the postmodern feminists is that,

571
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,530
that,
that was bullshit that no,

572
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:08,910
it is men get horny and it is partially 
what you're saying that it is about,

573
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:14,090
you know,
I've been rejected and I'm more 

574
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:14,090
physically powerful so I'm going to 
rape,

575
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:18,020
but that there is also like guys that 
are so fucking wired for sex and 

576
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,821
something's off and that it's,
it's about the physical act of sex as 

577
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:23,730
well.
It's not purely one or the other.

578
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,440
I agree.
There's a broad spectrum,

579
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,670
a lot of reasons to rape.
Yeah.

580
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,550
You know,
it's,

581
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,490
it's just one more bullying.
One more example of people trying to get

582
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,170
people to do things that they don't want
to do.

583
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,940
There's a lot of people that like to do 
that.

584
00:26:36,941 --> 00:26:39,520
There's a lot of people that like to,
they like to be the boss.

585
00:26:39,521 --> 00:26:41,650
They like to get people to do things 
they don't want to do,

586
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,350
like to yell at people.
They to,

587
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:43,900
you know,
there's,

588
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:44,060
there's

589
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:49,060
a,
there's a lot of people that would love 

590
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,060
to be a cop just so they could yell at 
people,

591
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:53,340
you know,
a lot of judgment going on with human 

592
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:53,340
beings,
you know?

593
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,040
Yeah.
And religion is um,

594
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:01,090
uh,
is it a manifestation of that are the 

595
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:01,090
cause of that?

596
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:01,090
It's a manifestation I think.
I think every,

597
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,900
it wasn't a religion.
Somebody would make something up.

598
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,000
I think we're always looking,
we're,

599
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:10,001
we look so hard for someone to have the 
answers that it's almost impossible for 

600
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:11,750
someone with a big ego to not take 
advantage.

601
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:17,110
So some crazy dude would come along with
the answers all of a sudden and then 

602
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,110
boom,
you'd have a new religion.

603
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,470
So our longing,
you know,

604
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:23,120
it's like we have an amazing ability to 
control our environment right now,

605
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:23,680
you know,
with,

606
00:27:23,681 --> 00:27:28,681
with planes and the Internet and 
physically our physical infrastructure 

607
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:29,030
of our cities.
This is amazing ability,

608
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:33,650
but yet we're still trying to figure out
why the fuck we're here.

609
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:37,100
What is,
what is sex and breeding and what is the

610
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:42,101
purpose of making more people?
If I'm just going to die and everyone 

611
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:42,101
else is going to die eventually,
too late,

612
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:42,730
what is our purpose here?
What,

613
00:27:42,731 --> 00:27:44,660
what?
What the fuck is this really all about?

614
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,310
Isn't it amazing that that is really the
core.

615
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:52,340
Those three or four questions you just 
asked are there is no close second to 

616
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:56,260
importance in questions in life and 
they're the ones you never hear talk.

617
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,010
And when you,
when everyone brings them up,

618
00:27:58,011 --> 00:27:59,060
you belittle it.
It's like,

619
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:00,730
yeah man,
you're depressed,

620
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,240
you're sick.
And like that,

621
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:04,520
your breast,
I don't wouldn't want to be you man.

622
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,130
You had a friend who was a very nice 
guy,

623
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,740
but he's a mormon.
And uh,

624
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:13,890
he made Romney and his wife had had 
dinner with me and they were asking me 

625
00:28:13,911 --> 00:28:17,180
about higher powers if I believed in a 
higher power.

626
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,280
And I said,
I don't,

627
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,530
I don't not believe adult like 
disbelieve.

628
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,930
I've never been.
It's never been proven to me,

629
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,190
but it means it might be possible.
And the woman actually said,

630
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:30,620
I don't think I could sleep if I thought
that way.

631
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,130
If I had those questions not answered,
I go,

632
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:36,620
wow,
but what if there was no answer?

633
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,890
What if there really was no answer?
Like it's not like you couldn't get them

634
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:42,200
answered.
It's like the answer doesn't exist right

635
00:28:42,201 --> 00:28:44,390
now.
Like you don't have access to it.

636
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:46,910
So everything else is just speculation.
Like at a certain point in time,

637
00:28:46,911 --> 00:28:51,911
we have to accept that you have to 
accept the fact that he's just too much 

638
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:52,970
evidence that people are full of shit.
And these stories are terrible.

639
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,280
So you possibly

640
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,320
in most languages is interpreted as the 
unknowable.

641
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,060
You know,
you have to,

642
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,760
in a sense,
it puts the onus on you.

643
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:06,761
I don't think that true spirituality 
comes out of more of that idea of like 

644
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:11,111
Taoism where there is a nap,
there is this force of nature that is 

645
00:29:11,111 --> 00:29:12,950
positive and flows.
And by humbling your ego,

646
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,870
you can become a part of that force 
that's as close as I think if you really

647
00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:19,640
boil down,
most eastern thought,

648
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:24,200
it comes down to that selflessness and 
getting into a place where the power,

649
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,810
obviously something is making the 
flowers bloom,

650
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:29,810
the sun setting at the same time,
all the shit that you can count on.

651
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,860
There's a cycle,
there's a cycle and it.

652
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:32,900
And it works on a,
on a,

653
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,390
on a micro level and a macro level at 
all.

654
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:38,300
It's all consistent in a way that you 
go,

655
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:39,680
all right,
there's something.

656
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,860
But then to say that,
you know,

657
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:44,020
what that is,
is where the bullshit starts.

658
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,880
You know?
And to me it always starts with like 

659
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:49,880
what you're saying,
like there's a volcano.

660
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,371
People get scared and there's always one
guy who is so fucking cocky that he 

661
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:53,740
goes,
he's always got a robe.

662
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,020
So he's a guy in a robe.
It's got,

663
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,110
I'm going to go talk to God.
He doesn't talk to you.

664
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,230
They'll talk to me.
And he just decides that.

665
00:30:02,231 --> 00:30:04,330
And then he leaves for a little while.
He goes back and go,

666
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,360
here's what he said,
you guys should give me 10 percent for.

667
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,240
That was his first thing,
and then this other shit that's going to

668
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:15,241
play kate.
All your fears and it's going to make 

669
00:30:15,241 --> 00:30:15,241
you ashamed,
which will make you feel comfortable.

670
00:30:15,241 --> 00:30:15,630
It's just a pimp game.
Yeah,

671
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,780
it's always been.

672
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,340
There's no answers.
That's what people need to know,

673
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,390
but the idea that there is no god that 
there is,

674
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,580
there's absolutely no deity.
Absolutely.

675
00:30:25,581 --> 00:30:30,581
There's no intelligence to the whole 
process that I don't believe that 

676
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:30,581
either.
I don't either.

677
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:34,990
I don't see any evidence that there 
there isn't a very distinctive 

678
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,701
mathematical progression to to 
everything in the universe and I don't 

679
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:40,610
know if you can say that there's not a 
purpose for that.

680
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:45,850
I don't know if you can define if a an 
intelligent form of life or 

681
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,961
consciousness or whatever the fuck it is
created it or if it's just the ethic of 

682
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:51,230
the universal things always get more 
complicated,

683
00:30:51,231 --> 00:30:54,110
including intelligent life in technology
and it just.

684
00:30:54,111 --> 00:30:56,210
Everything will continue to get more 
complicated.

685
00:30:56,211 --> 00:30:57,920
Period.
That's how the universe works.

686
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,810
I mean that might be it.

687
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,370
Well,
if you look at it,

688
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:06,460
I always say,
I always say to people that are 

689
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:06,460
completely,
you know,

690
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:06,830
which is the one where you don't believe
in any God at all.

691
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:08,720
Not a theist.
Agnosticism,

692
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:09,340
not.
Well.

693
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,850
No.
Agnostic is you don't know.

694
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,690
You don't believe there is a god,
you know?

695
00:31:12,691 --> 00:31:14,300
I think there's not a god you haven't 
been.

696
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:19,301
It hasn't been proven.
Atheism is a lack the needle denial of 

697
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:22,310
any lack of a non belief in a deity and 
non non theists

698
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,670
atheists I will say too.
Okay,

699
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:28,240
so then at that means that you're purely
darwinist evolution.

700
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:35,380
I think you can be an atheist and still 
be open to something fucking crazy that 

701
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,530
no one's ever considered.
It just hasn't been proven yet.

702
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:41,920
I don't think any atheism is absolutely 
atheist rather is absolutely positive 

703
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,550
that when they die,
the energy seizes to exist.

704
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,370
They do not pass into another form of 
existence.

705
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,930
I don't think people are saying that.
Yeah.

706
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:51,020
I think what they're saying is that I 
don't buy religion.

707
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:54,710
I'm not buying the God concept.
I'm not buying the man in the sky.

708
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:56,780
I'm not buying any of that.
That's what they're saying,

709
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,690
and that agnostics are kind of like 
riding the fence on that,

710
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,550
but they don't want to piss people off.
So they're like,

711
00:32:01,551 --> 00:32:01,990
well,
yeah,

712
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,570
who knows,

713
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,800
sort of in a belief in God the 12 step 
because if you deny that there's any 

714
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:09,760
kind of,
um,

715
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:14,850
uh,
there was this movie that people hated 

716
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:14,850
that I actually really liked called tree
of life.

717
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,420
Did you see that?
What was really spacey?

718
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:17,430
Um,
it was a lot.

719
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,510
There was,
there were no worth 45 minutes.

720
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,820
And the theme of it was about,
it was grades versus nature and it,

721
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,570
it got me thinking a lot about,
um,

722
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:31,680
if you're going to be a pure 
evolutionists and believe that science 

723
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,820
is this thing that is,
there's an infinite possibilities,

724
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:38,821
we are one possibility and that all the 
things that are happening right now are 

725
00:32:38,821 --> 00:32:43,551
a result of complete freaky but yet 
logical science.

726
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,320
And I say,
well,

727
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:47,750
if that's true.
And evolution is the key,

728
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,110
why do we have handicap ramps?
Why do we have welfare?

729
00:32:51,111 --> 00:32:52,760
Why do we have affirmative action?

730
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,410
It wouldn't exist.
You know,

731
00:32:54,411 --> 00:32:59,411
liberals,
the ones that believe that there is no 

732
00:32:59,411 --> 00:32:59,411
god or that they,
they,

733
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:03,281
they downplay the God thing and they're 
the ones that are constantly promoting 

734
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:03,480
what I would call grace.
You know,

735
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:08,540
kindness,
kindness doesn't exist in the animal 

736
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:08,540
kingdom is like what we were talking 
about with rape,

737
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:08,720
you know,
that,

738
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:13,780
you know,
not raping his kindness because you 

739
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:13,820
could rape but you don't.
That's great.

740
00:33:13,821 --> 00:33:17,030
Something is in us,
whether it's shame sociologically,

741
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:22,210
but if you look at it more in the bigger
picture of I'm a liberal and yet I am 

742
00:33:23,211 --> 00:33:28,211
voting against my best interests because
there's something in me and I don't 

743
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:33,221
believe in any prescribed religion,
but there's something in me in my gut 

744
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:34,820
that feels like Jesus did,
you know,

745
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,200
so you can't have both.
You can't have evolution and completely 

746
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,261
deny that there is some kind of a spirit
within our process as humans that's 

747
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:49,540
guiding us towards something kinder than
complete survival of the fittest.

748
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,600
Yeah.
I think that's what the one thing that 

749
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:55,600
we are,
we are an animal,

750
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,850
but we're also the next stage of animals
where we're aware of who we are and we 

751
00:34:00,101 --> 00:34:05,101
contemplate our existence and when you 
contemplate your existence in you're an 

752
00:34:05,101 --> 00:34:06,910
intelligent life form,
you should always be seeking to improve.

753
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:12,450
If you're always seeking to improve the 
thing that you look at it like what has 

754
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,360
brought me the most positive results,
so it's kindness,

755
00:34:13,361 --> 00:34:14,410
it's kindness,
friendship,

756
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:18,730
the connection with human beings on a 
very positive level where you like build

757
00:34:18,731 --> 00:34:22,330
up like a trust in you.
You have a warmth and friendship and you

758
00:34:22,331 --> 00:34:27,331
root for each other and you share in 
each other's bounty and you you build 

759
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:31,111
together.
You know that we all know inherently in 

760
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:34,021
our,
in our heads that kindness is like one 

761
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:35,500
of the best gifts you can bestow another
human being,

762
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:40,501
whether it's giving them food when they 
don't have any or helping them out or 

763
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:43,441
hooking them up or doing something to 
help them just or being around them and 

764
00:34:43,441 --> 00:34:44,410
complimenting them.
Whatever the fuck it is.

765
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:49,650
We know that inherently.
That feels great and we know it when we 

766
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:53,070
know that that's the next we have to 
figure out how to use our resources 

767
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,650
together so that we can be like that all
the time.

768
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,390
Well,
as a,

769
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:59,440
as a person,
I see it because I know when I was 

770
00:34:59,440 --> 00:34:59,950
younger I would like you super fucking 
competitive,

771
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,110
you know,
just look at standup.

772
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:06,120
I mean you and I think probably pushed 
ourselves as hard as we possibly could 

773
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,300
for about 10 years nonstop.
And uh,

774
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:12,590
and then I got to a certain age where 
like now I appreciate like hanging out 

775
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,280
with you today just felt so fucking 
great.

776
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
You know,
somebody who has a shared history with 

777
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,601
you that you know,
has similar visions on life and things 

778
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:23,530
and that wasn't as important to me when 
I was in my early twenties.

779
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,570
All I cared about was competing,
winning I gotTa,

780
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,690
you know,
and creatively I enjoyed it all.

781
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:33,691
But,
but I think as you get older you start 

782
00:35:33,691 --> 00:35:36,391
to really understand what you just said,
that the kindness and the connection is 

783
00:35:36,391 --> 00:35:37,150
where it's all at.
You look at all these studies,

784
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,290
they're doing a lot of sort of 
quantifiable happiness,

785
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:42,180
you know,
studies on what brings us happiness.

786
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,730
It always comes down.
It's never about money.

787
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,970
Yeah,
I think it's always about doing what you

788
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:51,971
actually want to be doing with your life
as far as like if you have an inner 

789
00:35:51,971 --> 00:35:55,060
creative expression to get out and 
there's a lot of people who always 

790
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,070
wanted to be singers and they just,
for whatever reason,

791
00:35:55,071 --> 00:36:00,071
never pursued it so they just sing 
around their house and they always 

792
00:36:00,071 --> 00:36:00,200
wonder what could have been if they just
tried to be a singer.

793
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,140
That's one form of that that could bum 
you out.

794
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:08,320
That's one form of a,
a roadblock in your life to the 

795
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,390
depressed feeling that you didn't try.
You didn't try to reach your potential.

796
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,060
You didn't go after.
What is intriguing to you?

797
00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:19,061
Like we all have almost like a beacon 
that pulls us in a certain direction 

798
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:19,061
with some people.
It's nursing,

799
00:36:19,061 --> 00:36:23,890
some people.
It's construction and architecture 

800
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:23,890
parent.
For some people.

801
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:23,890
For some,
for us it was stand up.

802
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,370
It's really simple and it's like there,
there's,

803
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,490
there's something,
the,

804
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,500
the,
the happiness that's involved in 

805
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,250
pursuing your,
your inherent desires is uninvolved.

806
00:36:34,251 --> 00:36:34,580
I mean,
it's,

807
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,460
it's,
it's,

808
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,910
it's unappreciated.
It's under appreciated.

809
00:36:37,911 --> 00:36:38,480
People think,
well,

810
00:36:38,481 --> 00:36:40,250
all you have to do is find a career.
Yes.

811
00:36:40,251 --> 00:36:45,251
All you have to do is find a crib,
but I guarantee you there's one out 

812
00:36:45,251 --> 00:36:45,251
there that you really,
really want to do.

813
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,690
Yeah.
Just like,

814
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,630
I want to be famous.

815
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,160
So that was going to say the key is 
that,

816
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:55,161
you know,
we're in Hollywood and I see a lot of 

817
00:36:55,161 --> 00:36:57,350
misdirected what you're saying,
you see people that think that being 

818
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,370
famous is going to bring them happiness,
which you certainly have more experience

819
00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:00,860
with fam than I do,
but I,

820
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,980
you probably would say that it is 
marginally helps you be happier with 

821
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,600
giving you maybe some possibilities,
but it does not deliver you happiness.

822
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,950
Yeah,
it's managed madness is what it is.

823
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,070
You have.
You've traded the whole universe.

824
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,290
Brian,
how dare you keep that thing on?

825
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,580
Is that the turn it off?
I'm going to want to take care of it.

826
00:37:21,581 --> 00:37:22,690
Don't worry.
Um,

827
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:23,710
it's,
it's,

828
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,290
it's,
it's a form of madness because the whole

829
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:31,120
world has changed and now everywhere you
go people will know who you are,

830
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,250
but you won't know who they are,
you know,

831
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,040
and when you start becoming famous,
it's like one out of 100,

832
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,480
then it becomes one out of 10 or one out
of three when you were Tom Cruise.

833
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:41,920
It's everybody,
you know,

834
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:44,860
I'm not everybody,
but it's enough so that it's weird.

835
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:50,070
It's enough so that your reality shifts 
and then everywhere you go and people 

836
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,290
have their own all.
Also,

837
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,100
they have predetermined perceptions of 
you based on your work.

838
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:59,260
You know,
whether they can or it's something they 

839
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,260
read that you said or somebody who met 
you and you know,

840
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,260
oh,
he was.

841
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,260
Yeah,

842
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,140
he strikes me as kind of creepy,
is that they,

843
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:05,290
if they recognize you,
you're going to see their best side,

844
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,970
most likely you know,
there's the freaks,

845
00:38:06,971 --> 00:38:08,740
but most likely they're going to say,
look,

846
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,590
I'm meeting Joe Rogan.
I'm going to tell my friends about this.

847
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,060
I want to have as deep of a connection 
as quickly as possible as I can.

848
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:20,110
So you're getting all this energy 
focused on you constantly.

849
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:22,810
I just thought when we played pool,
I mean five or six different people came

850
00:38:22,811 --> 00:38:24,920
up to you and want to pictures and the 
thing is,

851
00:38:24,921 --> 00:38:28,900
is you're not necessarily.
Once you get over the novelty of,

852
00:38:28,901 --> 00:38:30,220
hey,
people recognize me.

853
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:35,430
You're really giving.
You're just giving people something 

854
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:35,570
unless you know,
unless you get a nice,

855
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:35,970
yeah,
you,

856
00:38:35,971 --> 00:38:36,400
you,
you know,

857
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:37,660
you're being nice,
which is.

858
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:42,661
But,
but for them it's like a positive 

859
00:38:42,661 --> 00:38:43,480
experience.
I liked it when I meet somebody,

860
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:45,010
I'm going to know if they're reduced.
You're not.

861
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:48,760
Because if they don't know me then I'm 
going to see who they really are.

862
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:51,430
But if they recognize me then it's going
to be,

863
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:53,140
I'm not going to see this person.
It's true.

864
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,060
They may talk shit behind my back or 
whatever,

865
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:56,410
but when they,
when I see them,

866
00:38:56,411 --> 00:39:01,411
they're going to have a little bit of an
agenda to be nicer or try to form more 

867
00:39:01,411 --> 00:39:02,500
of a relationship than they would have 
otherwise.

868
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,660
And that's confusing.
That really throws you off.

869
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,700
It can.
If you're not an analytical person.

870
00:39:07,701 --> 00:39:12,701
That looks.
I think the most difficult person to 

871
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:14,641
figure out always is our ourselves and I
think most people at least don't have 

872
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:20,670
nearly enough inner dialogue where they 
sit themselves down and go over all the 

873
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,481
different shit that they're thinking and
doing and behave and most people don't 

874
00:39:24,481 --> 00:39:27,490
understand their own mind and if you 
block shit in your life,

875
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:32,700
if you like,
I've seen it so many times with guys 

876
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,130
that are in the closet,
guys that are in the closet that are gay

877
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,460
and they become like huge boozers and 
they're just eating,

878
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,660
just blocking out this part of their 
brain as they're living their life in 

879
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,320
this tortured state.
Yeah.

880
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,530
You know,
I think that.

881
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,810
I think that's a,
that's a big issue for people.

882
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,750
Oh,
Kevin Meeney,

883
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,800
who's a dear friend of mine.
It was like a mentor for me coming up 

884
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,060
and stand up and he came out of the 
closet,

885
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:58,010
I want to say he was close to 50 with a 
kid and the guy had a drinking problem.

886
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,560
He was overweight and then he came out 
of the closet.

887
00:40:00,561 --> 00:40:02,780
He's fucking trim.
He's happy.

888
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,700
He's got new material.
And I mean,

889
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:07,580
I just saw this load come off as skews 
upon the load,

890
00:40:07,581 --> 00:40:09,230
come off his shoulders and onto his 
face.

891
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:09,830
Yeah.

892
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:16,140
You,
you know yourself better when you don't 

893
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,140
have secrets.
How bullshit in your head when you don't

894
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,380
have problems.

895
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,610
What was your biggest secret that came 
out in adulthood for you?

896
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,480
Because you changed your.
Somebody that.

897
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:28,481
Let me just preface it by saying this.
You're somebody who I think really 

898
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:30,830
significantly changed in the time I've 
known you and not in a bad way.

899
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,400
You went from being guy.
You never touched marijuana,

900
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,120
drinking nothing.
And you were uh,

901
00:40:38,121 --> 00:40:41,030
you were hardcore,
you were confrontational.

902
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,530
And it in an honest way,
it's what made you a good comedian early

903
00:40:44,531 --> 00:40:46,760
as you,
you took shit straight on and you didn't

904
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:51,761
back off and uh,
but you were always curious and I saw 

905
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:55,631
the curious side of you kind of expand 
as you got older and then I saw you 

906
00:40:55,631 --> 00:40:56,240
expand your mind with,
you know,

907
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,210
different,
different methods and,

908
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:04,320
and yet it's like you're still you,
but people don't really change usually 

909
00:41:04,971 --> 00:41:09,971
in life.
And it seems like something happened to 

910
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:10,280
you at a certain point,
like you had an epiphany or something.

911
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:15,470
What will one thing is I got an 
isolation tank and the isolation tank,

912
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:20,620
there's never been a bigger tool for me 
for in terms of like personal 

913
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:25,481
development than the tank.
Because the tank is you completely alone

914
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:30,290
only with your thoughts and there's no 
way to distract yourself with activities

915
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:35,291
with chronic masturbation,
with fucking watching tv when he 

916
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:38,621
flipping through channels late at night.
We really shouldn't be sleeping is no 

917
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:38,621
way to distract yourself from your inner
most thoughts.

918
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,580
When you're in there,
there's nothing there but you.

919
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,550
You don't even get your body in there 
because your body's in the warm water.

920
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:44,750
It doesn't feel the water.
After awhile,

921
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,070
there's so much salt.
You're floating.

922
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:51,370
So in that environment,
you're forced to take a lot of your,

923
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:56,420
your ideas head on and like,
is this a correct thought?

924
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,760
Did I do the right thing here?
Maybe I did,

925
00:41:58,761 --> 00:42:00,200
maybe I didn't.
Let's examine this.

926
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:05,201
You know?
And then as you look at things 

927
00:42:05,201 --> 00:42:06,971
objectively,
it's like you're sort of forced to grow 

928
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:07,370
in that environment.
The environment of the tank,

929
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:12,580
which is just another,
it's another form of a psychedelic 

930
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,911
experience.
It's a psychedelic experience that is 

931
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:15,911
natural.
You can.

932
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:16,130
It can be done while you're stone cold 
sober.

933
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,410
He just climb on in and within.
You know,

934
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,630
if you've done it for awhile,
within an hour,

935
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:25,631
you're in a psychedelic state,
you're in some crazy hallucinogenic 

936
00:42:25,631 --> 00:42:25,631
dream state.

937
00:42:25,631 --> 00:42:27,260
So what was it?
Truth over and over again.

938
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,940
A lot of my anger had to do with the way
I was raised A.

939
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:35,940
I hadn't seen my father since I was like
seven years old and I always thought 

940
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,301
that that didn't fuck with me,
but then as I got older I really truly 

941
00:42:39,301 --> 00:42:43,201
realized it fucked with me and I didn't.
I didn't really kind of understand it 

942
00:42:43,201 --> 00:42:47,401
until I had a few psychobilly 
experiences and kind of like looked at 

943
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:50,320
the source of a lot of angst and a lot 
of anger that I would have.

944
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:51,300
Like,
you know,

945
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,830
I would be a guy who would try to be 
nice to everybody,

946
00:42:53,831 --> 00:42:57,640
but I was already on a trigger.
So if something happened,

947
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,870
you know,
where someone did something route,

948
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:02,710
I would over escalate almost 
immediately.

949
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,500
I would be ready to take them to fucking
full on war

950
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,750
immediately.
Can I tell a story?

951
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,950
Which one?
Well,

952
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,720
I don't know that we've ever talked 
about this,

953
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:13,030
but we had one kind of blow out in our 
life.

954
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,080
And it was,
you were,

955
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,030
I was living with your girlfriend at the
time.

956
00:43:16,031 --> 00:43:18,460
Jennifer.
Jennifer from Staten Island.

957
00:43:18,461 --> 00:43:20,440
Was there an ambulance?
First names.

958
00:43:20,441 --> 00:43:20,920
Okay,
right.

959
00:43:20,921 --> 00:43:21,610
Yeah,
I guess.

960
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,240
Big Hair.
Very nice growth rate.

961
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,340
Check.
Great check.

962
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,500
I'll tell the story of how this happened
because we,

963
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:31,270
uh,
we went to some club.

964
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,800
Okay.
I don't want to say where she worked,

965
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,000
but we,
we,

966
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:39,001
uh,
Greg and I were there and she came over 

967
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:41,641
to talk to us and said that she had a 
room for rent in her apartment and she 

968
00:43:43,361 --> 00:43:45,850
needed to find a roommate.
And then,

969
00:43:45,851 --> 00:43:46,540
uh,
I was like,

970
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:49,570
I think greg needs a roommate.
I'm greg is looking for a room.

971
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,920
I was trying to get out of my friends.
We're all drunks and I quit drinking and

972
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,340
I needed to get the fuck out,

973
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,960
and so,
uh,

974
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,800
she walks away and greg was like,
Holy Shit,

975
00:43:58,801 --> 00:43:59,880
I want to be living with her.

976
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,550
Oh my God,
look out.

977
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,130
Can Hace as I go,
dude.

978
00:44:03,131 --> 00:44:04,220
She's fucking hot.
Right?

979
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,870
And so then a girlfriend before you 
started,

980
00:44:07,871 --> 00:44:09,520
before we started dating,
we had just met her.

981
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,750
We had just met her.
So then I called him the next day.

982
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:14,290
I go,
dude,

983
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:17,150
your new apartment is fucking awesome.
Eddie.

984
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,300
And he'd go,
what are you talking about?

985
00:44:19,301 --> 00:44:19,950
I just,
Oh,

986
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:24,951
well,
just fuck that girl in your new 

987
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:24,951
apartment.

988
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:25,370
Amazing.
You were like,

989
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:27,120
oh.
So we had like a little thing.

990
00:44:27,121 --> 00:44:27,250
We're

991
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:32,070
were greg kind of liked this girl first 
sort and I

992
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,020
fucked her and then he was living with 
her and it was,

993
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:39,110
it was kind of weird and there was one 
night where she had told me that you 

994
00:44:40,921 --> 00:44:45,921
were talking shit about me and it really
hurt my feelings because I couldn't 

995
00:44:45,961 --> 00:44:47,640
believe that you did it.
You,

996
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,600
she had her period and we were like 21 
years old,

997
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:52,770
whatever the fuck it was.
You know,

998
00:44:52,771 --> 00:44:57,771
you say stupid shit back then and um,
she was miserable and she would have bad

999
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:02,930
periods and you came up to her and you 
confronted me with,

1000
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:04,470
look,
if you're this miserable,

1001
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,690
why don't you just fucking leave him,
you know,

1002
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,140
like,
really,

1003
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:08,760
what are you doing here?
This is what she told you.

1004
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:11,550
She told me and then she told you,
Greg,

1005
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,860
I'm on my period.
That's why I'm miserable.

1006
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,730
And I was so upset.
I was like,

1007
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:19,380
wow,
I can't believe he did that.

1008
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:20,550
I mean,
she was hot,

1009
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,870
you know,
and you're living with her.

1010
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,010
I,
I get all that.

1011
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:28,100
I get all that,
but I couldn't believe that you have 

1012
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:28,100
said something to her like bad about me,
you know,

1013
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,710
because in my eyes I'm a very loyal 
person and when someone's,

1014
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:36,711
my friend,
they're my friend and I would never go 

1015
00:45:36,711 --> 00:45:36,870
to a friend's girl.
But it was a very complicated situation.

1016
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:41,871
You know,
it's not healthy for a heterosexual guy 

1017
00:45:41,871 --> 00:45:44,180
to be living with a hot girl in the day 
with two dead.

1018
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,240
Uh,
but.

1019
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:51,130
So anyway,
I go on this Gig and the Gig was 

1020
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:53,811
terrible.
It's a fucking awful gig and it was a 

1021
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:56,070
long drive and I did not have a good set
and I was coming back and I was with her

1022
00:45:56,071 --> 00:45:58,960
and you know,
she had just told me this thing that you

1023
00:45:58,961 --> 00:46:01,830
had did and I was so fucking mad I 
couldn't believe it.

1024
00:46:01,831 --> 00:46:06,390
I was so fucking mad and we went and got
ice cream and um,

1025
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:11,630
I went to the bathroom and I came back 
and I opened my ice cream and Jennifer 

1026
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:14,610
was eating hers and my ice cream bar had
a bite taken out of it

1027
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,130
and then Jerry's peace pop

1028
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:22,240
and it was greg had taken a bite out of 
it and so that I flipped the switch and 

1029
00:46:23,301 --> 00:46:25,460
I threw the ice cream that your face at 
about 100

1030
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,190
miles an hour.

1031
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,910
And uh,
I don't know what I said.

1032
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,980
I don't remember what I said,
but I remember I went into.

1033
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:34,960
I want it to danger zone.

1034
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:40,090
Yeah.
Well I wanted to bring it up because we 

1035
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:40,090
never talked about it.
We never did.

1036
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:40,510
And I want it to.
Because obviously luck.

1037
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:43,050
There's always two sides.
Of course.

1038
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,950
Three sides in this case.
Yeah.

1039
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,060
And uh,
I think number one,

1040
00:46:47,061 --> 00:46:51,020
I was a brash fucking wise ass pervert,
you know,

1041
00:46:51,021 --> 00:46:56,021
with a lot of energy back then.
And so first point I would say is that 

1042
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:59,920
with Jennifer,
if I said I can't believe it and live 

1043
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,201
with her,
I think it was probably more of a comic 

1044
00:47:02,201 --> 00:47:02,201
premise than like a real attraction on 
any level.

1045
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:03,110
I think it was like,
yeah,

1046
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:08,111
she was hot but I wouldn't be moving in 
with a chick to try to get laid with 

1047
00:47:08,111 --> 00:47:09,860
her.
Probably more like that.

1048
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,240
I'm not saying that it was a residual 
feeling with you that like I had said 

1049
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,080
that and it was maybe on your mind that 
I'm living with her and you know,

1050
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,190
that's a little bit.

1051
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:22,090
I'm pretty open minded dude.
She was living with another guy,

1052
00:47:22,091 --> 00:47:25,310
the gay guy and I would go out with them
all the time while he was gay.

1053
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,580
Don't give it up.
Same Damn it.

1054
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,750
So cut the whole thing.

1055
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,010
And the other thing is if

1056
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,790
I,
and if I,

1057
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:33,520
it's possible I might have said that 
thing about.

1058
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,720
Wait,
let me just say my side of it.

1059
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,180
It's possible.
Who knows?

1060
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:38,890
I might have said something about you,
you know,

1061
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,900
and again,
I was a fucking loud mouth.

1062
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:45,901
I sat and talked a lot of shit.
I think that in my heart you and I are 

1063
00:47:45,901 --> 00:47:49,471
good friends.
We had come up and done a lot of shit 

1064
00:47:49,471 --> 00:47:49,471
together,
gone through a lot,

1065
00:47:49,471 --> 00:47:51,220
support each other a lot.
And I think if I'd said something,

1066
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,860
it's again,
I have no fucking idea.

1067
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:55,070
I don't remember.
You know,

1068
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,650
it's so long ago.
The memories aren't real anyway.

1069
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,140
They're not.
No

1070
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:04,580
brought it up in this,
in this arena because I feel like I 

1071
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,541
don't know if there's humor in it,
but I think that there's a real moment 

1072
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:07,541
in it where,
you know,

1073
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:10,961
we were,
I think it fucked me up too because 

1074
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:13,370
first of all seeing you get that angry 
was like,

1075
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,960
you know,
scary shit.

1076
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,510
And it was the irony of you hitting me 
with the Ben and Jerry's piece.

1077
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,670
Pop was also not completely lost on me

1078
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:24,930
and I,
and I felt

1079
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:25,540
like,
you know,

1080
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:29,020
and sadly that was right at a time when 
you were moving to New York,

1081
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,870
you started going down and working in 
danger fields and all that shit.

1082
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:36,310
So it became kind of convenient debt.
We just didn't see each other as much.

1083
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:41,311
We will fucking write together every day
we drive to gigs and then all of a 

1084
00:48:41,311 --> 00:48:42,550
sudden this kind of blow out happened 
and uh,

1085
00:48:42,551 --> 00:48:47,551
and you just happened to be moving.
And so we spent a few years of just not 

1086
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:51,331
being in each other's spheres at all.
And then it was water under the bridge 

1087
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:51,331
and we started to,
you know,

1088
00:48:51,331 --> 00:48:56,250
hang out and all that stuff.
But I always wanting to talk to you 

1089
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:59,071
about it because I felt like whatever 
your takeaway was from that experience 

1090
00:48:59,071 --> 00:48:59,350
that,
you know,

1091
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:01,600
it was,
if I did say something,

1092
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:05,830
it wasn't from my heart and that I think
it was a loaded situation.

1093
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,590
It was a load of situation and there was
a few other things that,

1094
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:13,830
wait a minute,
a few other things that we're leaning 

1095
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:13,830
into that confrontation that,
you know,

1096
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:18,650
it wasn't anything bad that you did.
It was sort of an attitude that you had 

1097
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:18,650
taken with me.
I don't know.

1098
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:19,300
It was weird.
There was a,

1099
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:21,100
there was a resentment thing.
I'm pretty,

1100
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:22,240
uh,
pretty sensitive to it.

1101
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:24,340
Everything.
A lot of it had to do with living with a

1102
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:25,080
girl.
Well,

1103
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,730
you and I grew in different directions.

1104
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:28,430
Comics,
you,

1105
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:33,490
you were going hardcore.
You were hanging out with another 

1106
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:36,191
Michael and you were real Kennison guy 
and I was starting to move a little bit 

1107
00:49:36,651 --> 00:49:37,760
more towards

1108
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,610
clean.
Clever.

1109
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:41,110
Yeah.
I was going through a

1110
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:45,340
cleaning clever stage and you gave me a 
really hard time about it.

1111
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:48,580
You could call me a pussy and you got to
fucking be real up there.

1112
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:50,600
It was intimidating because it was like,
well,

1113
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:52,640
I'm not worried telling me how to do my 
act,

1114
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:57,790
but you will get really down.
You would get pissed at me because I 

1115
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:57,790
loved you.
I just want,

1116
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,780
didn't want to see you back off you were
you when you were at your best,

1117
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:03,610
Greg fitzsimmons would have the sets and
you would,

1118
00:50:03,611 --> 00:50:08,611
uh,
you would have a bunch of really well 

1119
00:50:08,611 --> 00:50:10,451
crafted jokes,
you had a bunch of good things and you 

1120
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:13,241
have one thing where you just went over 
the fucking edge completely and the 

1121
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:15,050
comics would be howling and I always 
knew I was like,

1122
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,990
if he can harness that,
if he can figure out how to do,

1123
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,360
I mean you have a sick fucking sense of 
humor.

1124
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:23,900
So when I would see a pull back,
like to do a letterman or pulled back to

1125
00:50:23,901 --> 00:50:25,070
do any of this stuff,
I'm like,

1126
00:50:25,071 --> 00:50:27,980
the only reason that exists is there's 
someone trying to

1127
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,270
sell Toyota trucks or tie.
The only reason why censored TV exists.

1128
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,360
So this idea that it became clean and 
clever.

1129
00:50:34,361 --> 00:50:39,361
I'm like,
what is clever about cutting out the 

1130
00:50:39,361 --> 00:50:41,621
most fun aspects of life and 
homogenizing it for so that four year 

1131
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,520
olds can watch it really?
Is that.

1132
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:45,350
What's clever?
That's clever.

1133
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,910
That's not real comedy.

1134
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:50,260
And in my head back then I was watching 
you and saying,

1135
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,320
well yeah,
you're just going up there and you're 

1136
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,601
just fucking throwing shit and common 
their faces and your healing and your 

1137
00:50:57,601 --> 00:51:02,221
fucking prancing the stage and a stock 
and you're fucking guys your hand over 

1138
00:51:02,221 --> 00:51:02,500
the money.
And I was just like,

1139
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:03,580
you know,
he's killing it.

1140
00:51:03,581 --> 00:51:08,581
But like that's like I was coming out of
college as an English major and I want 

1141
00:51:08,581 --> 00:51:08,581
it to.
Right.

1142
00:51:08,581 --> 00:51:11,950
You don't have gone into writing.
So to me it was just a different choice.

1143
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:14,320
And it was one that you didn't respect.

1144
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,520
No,
it's not that.

1145
00:51:15,521 --> 00:51:16,560
I know.
You just said it.

1146
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,500
You didn't really know I want.
I know.

1147
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,400
It's not that I didn't respect the 
writing.

1148
00:51:20,401 --> 00:51:22,410
It's not that I didn't respect the 
discipline of it.

1149
00:51:22,411 --> 00:51:24,870
I know it's more difficult.
It's more difficult path.

1150
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:30,080
It was that with you.
I always knew you had a sick fucking 

1151
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,080
sense of humor.
So I was like,

1152
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,920
oh,
it's like going back to Tom,

1153
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:33,270
don't pull,
don't pull away from that.

1154
00:51:33,271 --> 00:51:34,980
Are you crazy?
That's like what makes you unique?

1155
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,140
That's what makes us Howell in the back 
of the room.

1156
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:40,350
I mean we're not laughing because we 
like you and it's not funny.

1157
00:51:40,351 --> 00:51:45,351
It's like you would say some really dark
fucked up shit and they need bill eric 

1158
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:48,360
and never use that,
but they won't use me now.

1159
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,710
But Boston comedy will book me on the 
road because of the,

1160
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:51,780
you know,
they will.

1161
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:57,180
I think that there was a part of me that
I think in baseball terms you were 

1162
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:01,501
always the guy that was the grand slam 
swinger and I was the guy that just 

1163
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:05,221
wanted to get a lot of doubles and 
singles and so in a sense I think 

1164
00:52:05,221 --> 00:52:05,890
everybody,
my father used to say,

1165
00:52:05,891 --> 00:52:08,740
everybody ends up where they're really 
comfortable,

1166
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,510
you know,
and in a sense for you,

1167
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:13,300
like you talked about going on stage 
when you didn't have the material,

1168
00:52:13,301 --> 00:52:16,180
but doing an hour like balls out,
I'm fucking do.

1169
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:21,330
That wasn't me.
That would've been my worst fucking 

1170
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:23,281
nightmare.
To me it was like I wanted to make a 

1171
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:23,281
living doing this.
I wanted to write.

1172
00:52:23,281 --> 00:52:25,700
I want it to go on Letterman.
That was like things I wanted that,

1173
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:28,480
that we're in this strategy,
not that I like thought about it,

1174
00:52:28,481 --> 00:52:31,510
but it was just natural where I was 
going and for you it was like,

1175
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:34,150
you want it to fucking explode,
you know,

1176
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:38,650
you want it to be innocent and that was 
just a different fucking strategy,

1177
00:52:38,651 --> 00:52:42,520
different game plan than I had and I 
think that was a big part of it too.

1178
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,920
That was a lot of the tension underneath
the fight that happened.

1179
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:45,790
I,
yeah,

1180
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:47,830
I really,
really well I did.

1181
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:52,831
I resented that I was feeling like you 
were not approving of what I was doing 

1182
00:52:52,901 --> 00:52:54,430
and you're putting pressure on me not to
do it.

1183
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:59,500
That's hilarious because I always felt 
like that it was always the opposite 

1184
00:52:59,500 --> 00:52:59,500
with people,
that the people that we're dirty,

1185
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,240
we're especially back then in Boston,
they were the ones who were pressured,

1186
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,000
pressured to clean it up.
Oliver,

1187
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:05,810
Keith Lee,
that's all he ever used to tell me.

1188
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:07,250
You got to clean it up.
You've got to clean it up.

1189
00:53:07,251 --> 00:53:10,160
You said 10 bucks and 10 in 10 minutes.
Clean it up.

1190
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,300
Yeah.
It was always like,

1191
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:16,330
oh,
like I'm taking some sort of a shortcut 

1192
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:16,330
by doing things and I'm actually 
interested in talking about,

1193
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:20,891
so you saying that I think that I look 
down on you for for cleaning your act up

1194
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:23,630
or trying to go the professional route 
and it wasn't that,

1195
00:53:23,631 --> 00:53:26,040
it was never that.
It was that I didn't want you to

1196
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,040
stop doing the other staff because the 
darkest shit was the shit that would 

1197
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:31,580
make me laugh the most.
And then when you look,

1198
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,760
I can't do that,
but anymore I'm like,

1199
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:34,470
you're crazy.
That fucking bits.

1200
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:35,040
Awesome.

1201
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,100
I know in some of the bits I look back,
I can't.

1202
00:53:37,101 --> 00:53:39,530
I'm one of those people I cannot watch 
myself.

1203
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:44,590
I've early tapes.
I look at these clever fucking cute 

1204
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:44,590
jokes I was doing.

1205
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:46,880
I just remembered something he did that 
was fucking brilliant.

1206
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,380
This was back in the day where there was
like,

1207
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,920
maybe it's somebody had heard the jerky 
boys,

1208
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:57,010
like maybe like one one,
one of the cds were out and like they 

1209
00:53:57,010 --> 00:54:01,391
were really kind of funny,
recorded phone calls where they would 

1210
00:54:01,391 --> 00:54:04,151
fuck with people.
Greg did one where he called in a car 

1211
00:54:04,151 --> 00:54:07,490
rental place and you didn't win this 
extreme,

1212
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:12,280
extreme Boston accent for years,
for years after that go.

1213
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:17,500
It sounded fine.
The whole on fire you had that.

1214
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,010
You were doing a lot of dark.

1215
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:28,990
Well,
the thing is when you talk about the 

1216
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:28,990
Boston comedy community,
we really did have our own little pot.

1217
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:33,110
It was like me.
You caught her a Mike Mcdonald,

1218
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:38,260
McCarthy McCarthy.
It was really only a half a dozen of us 

1219
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:38,570
that and I felt like an outcast.
I didn't,

1220
00:54:38,571 --> 00:54:43,571
you know,
there was Dave Cross and and Marin and 

1221
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:44,450
all those guys that were doing like that
sketch esoteric stuff in Cambridge.

1222
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:47,210
Then you had like we talked about the 
big headliners that were,

1223
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,170
you know,
they had their own.

1224
00:54:48,171 --> 00:54:49,280
They were,
they were drinking

1225
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:54,310
in.
They were and looked at it in a 

1226
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:54,310
different way.
You know,

1227
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:54,510
those guys who were looked at as being 
clever with good material.

1228
00:54:54,511 --> 00:54:56,820
And then there was guys who were like 
Knox who will,

1229
00:54:56,821 --> 00:54:59,330
like a lot of people would like,
they would look down on them.

1230
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:03,000
They looked down on that material.
That's silly party guy,

1231
00:55:03,001 --> 00:55:03,720
sort of estate

1232
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:08,950
collar much more and yet we didn't fit 
nicely into any of the categories and so

1233
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:12,710
I think we were left in like it was a 
little bit of the misfit Toys Syndrome,

1234
00:55:12,711 --> 00:55:12,990
you know,
I,

1235
00:55:12,991 --> 00:55:14,740
I kind of felt like,
um,

1236
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,940
you know,
it wasn't about being clean or dirty,

1237
00:55:16,941 --> 00:55:21,941
it was just more about like resenting 
people that were fake and like seeing 

1238
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:26,081
people that were again looking like they
wanted careers and non backstabbers and 

1239
00:55:26,181 --> 00:55:31,181
all that shit.
And I felt like there was like a safety 

1240
00:55:31,181 --> 00:55:33,161
among the five or six guys we hung out 
with that we were like real people and 

1241
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:37,391
that we were doing ballsy comedy and 
that we were the hungriest ones out 

1242
00:55:37,391 --> 00:55:37,391
there.
I mean you went to an open mic night for

1243
00:55:37,391 --> 00:55:39,920
those couple years.
Ours with the first fucking names on the

1244
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:43,190
list and we were standing there like 
panthers waiting to see if we were going

1245
00:55:43,191 --> 00:55:43,490
to get on.

1246
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,340
Yeah.
We're not boasting.

1247
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:48,220
We really did drive to Rhode Island all 
the time to do free sets all the time.

1248
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:50,870
Constantly trying to the point where 
they would hold it over our head guy.

1249
00:55:50,871 --> 00:55:52,540
Now maybe you might not even built yet 
alone.

1250
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,730
Remember that dude,
Charlie,

1251
00:55:53,731 --> 00:55:58,731
it was kinda creepy about that.
Like hold it over your head and let her 

1252
00:55:58,731 --> 00:55:58,731
know tonight.

1253
00:55:58,731 --> 00:55:58,731
Yeah.
Yeah.

1254
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:01,920
He was this very flamboyant guy.
He does cabaret now and.

1255
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:05,550
Oh boy.
Did he liked checking you out and making

1256
00:56:05,551 --> 00:56:09,210
you kiss up to them?
Charlie?

1257
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:10,650
Um,
should I say?

1258
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:16,930
Yeah,
well I do that mainly when the bad guy 

1259
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:17,480
now just,
he shouldn't have had that power,

1260
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,600
you know?
And there was just a that,

1261
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:22,340
that whole little comedy scene in Rhode 
Island was very small.

1262
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:24,780
There wasn't.
Remember that one fucking really funny

1263
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:27,410
was Eddie.
He was your favorite.

1264
00:56:27,411 --> 00:56:28,540
Eddie uh,
damaged.

1265
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:29,830
Um,

1266
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,870
Eddie tell the story.
Well which one

1267
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:37,730
when you first dell his favorite joke 
about the,

1268
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:38,440
uh,
the,

1269
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:43,460
the um,
disposable douche commercial at the 

1270
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:43,460
mother and the daughter.
Oh yeah.

1271
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:44,790
But a lot of people.
Galvin,

1272
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:46,220
Eddie Galvin,
yes.

1273
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,350
Yeah.
Uh,

1274
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,980
yeah.
Yeah.

1275
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:54,010
What was it though?
Because this disposable douche 

1276
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:58,470
commercial,
it's a mother and the daughter walking 

1277
00:56:58,470 --> 00:56:58,470
down the beach together and the daughter
says to the mother,

1278
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:02,140
stinks,
but the cats have been following me

1279
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:09,810
and the Grad would plumping go nuts and 
then he ends up going to jail.

1280
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,620
We either got a death with a stick,
but the tree limb.

1281
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,660
Yeah.
I don't know what happened.

1282
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,100
I don't know what it was over.

1283
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:23,250
He was the second guy to go to jail.
There was another guy named Ed,

1284
00:57:23,251 --> 00:57:25,460
the machine regime.
Who Was it?

1285
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:30,300
Who was working also as a used car 
salesman who set the odometers back cars

1286
00:57:30,301 --> 00:57:32,070
and did about five or six years.

1287
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:32,960
Yeah,
I remember that.

1288
00:57:32,961 --> 00:57:35,480
I remember when he got out.
I remember when he got out,

1289
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:40,540
he got out and he started wearing like a
gangster suit and a hat stage at the 

1290
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,120
machine regime.
Yeah.

1291
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,880
He was a good like functional comment,

1292
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,900
functional comic.
He knew how to get the laughs and then 

1293
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,841
there's the other Rhode Island comic 
who'd put a clam suit on and then he 

1294
00:57:51,841 --> 00:57:53,770
would close out with a bit where you 
seeing muddy waters.

1295
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,210
I'm a man,
but it's.

1296
00:57:55,260 --> 00:58:00,260
I'm a clam,
I forgotten the crab with those their 

1297
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,190
shit and then you're on next.
That was,

1298
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:07,500
it was always about who you had to 
follow in Boston because you'd have 

1299
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,950
outrageous shit like that happen and the
crowds in some towns were so dumb.

1300
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:14,010
I mean Rhode Island,
they were all dumped and you'd have to 

1301
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:16,591
go on after that and,
and it's like they just fed the fucking 

1302
00:58:16,591 --> 00:58:17,830
mongrels some red meat and now you're 
going up and it's like,

1303
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:18,820
whoa.

1304
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,100
You were there with me on one of the 
Times.

1305
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:27,260
Were Hicks performed in Boston and we 
saw him clear the room clear the were,

1306
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:31,040
it was you and me and mccarthy and a 
couple other guys.

1307
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:35,030
Maybe it was a todd parker.
He might've been with us.

1308
00:58:35,031 --> 00:58:40,031
It's like a Sunday night and,
and Hicks went up there and he went on 

1309
00:58:40,031 --> 00:58:40,550
after Larry.

1310
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,200
Dr Larry.
Uh,

1311
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:44,830
yeah,
no,

1312
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:48,010
yeah,
La Comic on a Harley and Mary Norton.

1313
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:53,460
Norton Norton.
So Larry Norton goes up and he's doing 

1314
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:53,460
like cartoon characters.
If they got high,

1315
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,010
this would be bugs.
Plenty of.

1316
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,270
Got a really simple shit.
Cops and donuts,

1317
00:58:57,271 --> 00:58:57,720
you know,
like,

1318
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:00,600
like really like softballs,
he's lobbing a match,

1319
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:01,320
right?
Kill it.

1320
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:06,410
He's killing and Hicks goes on and just 
just each deck right away from the 

1321
00:59:07,051 --> 00:59:08,310
moment.
His very first joke,

1322
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,510
he's like patient with his,
you know,

1323
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,530
what he's going to say and thinking 
about things.

1324
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:18,531
It just goes and some weird points and 
the crunches gets up and fucking chunks 

1325
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:22,910
and so maybe 45 minutes into a set,
40,

1326
00:59:22,911 --> 00:59:26,360
40 minutes and knows what he's doing 
this bit where he's,

1327
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:30,290
he's playing John Davidson and John 
Davidson gets fucked by Satan.

1328
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:32,630
John Davidson used to be the host of 
that's incredible.

1329
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:37,810
And John Davidson is getting fucked by 
Satan and he swells up in the off season

1330
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:39,680
and shits out.

1331
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:44,510
Geraldo Rivera becomes pregnant with the
demon seed and it becomes Geraldo Rivera

1332
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,670
and he shits it out and he's like on the
toilet,

1333
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:51,700
shitting out Geraldo Rivera.
And he's grunting for like fucking two 

1334
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:55,460
solid minutes,
maybe more like literally no words,

1335
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:58,580
no words,
no words,

1336
00:59:58,581 --> 01:00:03,581
no words.
And then he looks up in the middle of 

1337
01:00:03,581 --> 01:00:03,581
people just getting them in trouble.
He goes,

1338
01:00:03,581 --> 01:00:04,530
Yup.
That's usually clears the room,

1339
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:11,600
goes right back to it and it was just 
you and I and a couple other guys in the

1340
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:17,591
back of the room howling laughing.
Maybe 50 slash 50 people stayed and 

1341
01:00:17,591 --> 01:00:19,610
wooded next seat,
like the seat 300 maybe.

1342
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:24,640
Yeah,
about that 200 plus people got up and 

1343
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,370
left and we were howling and I just 
remember we sat,

1344
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:31,850
I think another time we went to see him,
it was at the faneuil hall comedy 

1345
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:32,990
connection and we actually got to sit in
the green room for,

1346
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,100
you know,
10,

1347
01:00:34,101 --> 01:00:36,320
15 minutes,
nothing but small talk.

1348
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:39,410
But the fact that fucking sat in a room 
with that guy,

1349
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,440
got to see him perform a couple times.
It really is like a,

1350
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:44,090
you know,
comedy history.

1351
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,140
He was,
you know,

1352
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:50,141
a lot of.
He gets a little shit from a lot of 

1353
01:00:50,141 --> 01:00:50,770
people because a lot of his ideas are so
commonplace today that people go,

1354
01:00:50,771 --> 01:00:52,540
oh well he wasn't even doing comedy.
Like,

1355
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:57,541
you know,
like what are some of the stuff isn't 

1356
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:59,051
even funny,
but what they don't understand is that 

1357
01:00:59,051 --> 01:01:02,120
like every fucking comedian your stuff 
gets dated in time,

1358
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:03,050
you know,
it just,

1359
01:01:03,051 --> 01:01:03,950
it does,
it loses,

1360
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,230
it gets replicated again.
And again.

1361
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,520
Well Lenny Bruce,
a lot of,

1362
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:12,580
you know,
even Hicks's premises were like really 

1363
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:14,140
similar to Lenny Bruce's premises.
One of the Lenny Bruce premises was that

1364
01:01:14,141 --> 01:01:15,890
people don't,
he doesn't understand the cross,

1365
01:01:15,891 --> 01:01:20,891
you know,
years from now when people going to be 

1366
01:01:20,891 --> 01:01:20,891
running around with electric chairs 
around their necks.

1367
01:01:20,891 --> 01:01:21,560
And then Hicks had one about,
you know,

1368
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:24,250
it's like going up to Jackie Onassis 
with a rifle pendant.

1369
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,300
Just thinking of John Jogging.
Yeah.

1370
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:28,430
Know what I mean,
there's similarities.

1371
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:32,030
But what would hicks did was completely 
changed the way people do comedy.

1372
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:37,240
Like all of a sudden people to have 
comedy that would make you like make a 

1373
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,481
point.
And like it would be parts of it that 

1374
01:01:40,481 --> 01:01:43,181
would be funny,
but there'll be parts of it that would 

1375
01:01:43,181 --> 01:01:45,281
set up the funny by pointing out how 
fucking preposterous so much of this 

1376
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:45,281
shit is.
Yeah.

1377
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:49,100
And it's like it was a different ride.
It wasn't that Don Gavin punchline every

1378
01:01:49,101 --> 01:01:50,120
fucking three seconds,
Bang,

1379
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:50,540
Bang,
Bang.

1380
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:51,680
It was a different ride.
Well,

1381
01:01:51,681 --> 01:01:54,230
I think the turning point was really a 
declared.

1382
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,690
This distinction with him was that he 
didn't care.

1383
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,700
That's what it came down to,
was comedy.

1384
01:01:58,701 --> 01:02:03,701
That to its core did it was expressing 
itself without any regard to their 

1385
01:02:03,701 --> 01:02:08,381
section it was going to get from the 
audience and he figured out quite early 

1386
01:02:08,381 --> 01:02:08,840
that that was the way to find your real 
audience.

1387
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:13,940
Only performed their stuff and 
eventually everybody else leaves Jesus,

1388
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:16,250
this is terrible.
And then your people come long.

1389
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,810
Carlin did that too.
In a way.

1390
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,160
Shura be guests,
but he would become famous

1391
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:25,160
already.
Karlyn had become famous as sort of a 

1392
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:25,680
clean and squeaky.
But then he became,

1393
01:02:25,681 --> 01:02:30,681
I think a guy who was by the end to a 
fault more about his core beliefs and 

1394
01:02:30,681 --> 01:02:33,450
ended in his message.
I think he went so far with it,

1395
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:38,660
but in the sweet spot,
I think he was on the same level as 

1396
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:38,880
Hicks in terms of like taking on,
you know,

1397
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:41,460
religion.
Forget Bill Hicks was doing it in Texas,

1398
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:46,500
you know,
he was taken on Christianity in the 

1399
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,590
Bible belt in the eighties and he was 
doing it in a way that like,

1400
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,920
it wasn't that setup punchline and he 
started like that.

1401
01:02:49,921 --> 01:02:51,150
I mean,
I watched this documentary,

1402
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,580
he had like really cornet.
He was the guy,

1403
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:55,800
if you want to get to the place where 
Bill Hicks is,

1404
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,660
you got to be.
And Carlin,

1405
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,730
you have to learn the rules to break 
them.

1406
01:02:59,731 --> 01:03:00,330
And they did.

1407
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:02,730
They were very high functioning,
clean,

1408
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,560
you know,
monologue comics.

1409
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:08,520
And then they took that and they,
they made it dangerous by taking on real

1410
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:11,970
ideas and at the time that's what 
everybody is doing.

1411
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,220
And what he had done was running to 
Kennison.

1412
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,590
And then Kennison completely changed his
act.

1413
01:03:16,591 --> 01:03:19,380
And in fact,
when I first saw Hicks Hicks was doing a

1414
01:03:19,381 --> 01:03:21,620
lot of Kennison in his act,
much like you,

1415
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:26,650
you know,
you realize when there was a few guys 

1416
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:26,650
that would do,
um,

1417
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:29,520
a bunch of guards that will do Boston 
guys that would sound just like Knox.

1418
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:34,670
Oh yeah.
And they would do it just because there 

1419
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:34,670
was confidence in sounding like a really
funny guy,

1420
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:37,020
like a guy that you respect.
There's a confidence in it.

1421
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,010
And when I first saw Hicks,
it was years before that set,

1422
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,590
maybe a year,
year and a half before that said,

1423
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:47,930
the first time I saw him he was doing 
like a sort of a bit of a kinison and 

1424
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
you're like,
he wouldn't even make like we do like 

1425
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:53,000
the walking dead.

1426
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,500
He would roll his eyes and he said,
make the same noises that Kennison 

1427
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:57,500
would.
Megan.

1428
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:57,500
I'm like,
wow.

1429
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:57,580
Like,
that's really kind of close.

1430
01:03:58,530 --> 01:03:59,320
It doesn't,
you know,

1431
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:02,310
we've seen kinison.
Bobcat probably had a touch of that.

1432
01:04:02,311 --> 01:04:03,130
I think.
Uh,

1433
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:08,270
you know,
Marin had a touch of Hicks when he was 

1434
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:08,270
coming up.
He had a touch of the mannerisms.

1435
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:09,640
He would replicate math.
That's what I mean.

1436
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:12,120
The matter is,
you see that with a tail now.

1437
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,330
Lotta young towels out there.
Yes.

1438
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:16,560
A lot of young guys stand hopes.
Yup.

1439
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:17,400
You're right.
You're right.

1440
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:18,240
A lot of.
So yeah,

1441
01:04:18,241 --> 01:04:20,360
there was one time I was listening to 
this fucking guy on,

1442
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:23,580
on a raw radio and I couldn't believe 
it.

1443
01:04:23,581 --> 01:04:25,440
I was like,
this is a fucking stand hope clone.

1444
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:26,190
I was like,
confused,

1445
01:04:26,191 --> 01:04:28,610
like maybe standing up at a cold or on.
Sorry.

1446
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:30,210
No,
it's a different guy.

1447
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:31,600
Does he sound like staying home?
No,

1448
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:32,620
no.
Funny.

1449
01:04:32,621 --> 01:04:36,450
Or You just,
it's your opposite.

1450
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:38,340
That's your olive garden because he was 
on.

1451
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:42,690
Sorry.
So going back to the original topic,

1452
01:04:42,691 --> 01:04:45,180
our fight.
Glad it's over.

1453
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,310
I'm glad.
So I think that we're both uh,

1454
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,050
well we kind of abandoned it.
Know what I mean?

1455
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:51,540
I didn't really,
we didn't speak that much after that for

1456
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:53,550
awhile,
but it never came up again.

1457
01:04:53,551 --> 01:04:54,930
It wasn't like it needed to be 
discussed,

1458
01:04:54,931 --> 01:04:55,890
but I'm glad we did it.
Yeah,

1459
01:04:55,891 --> 01:04:58,750
I wanted to just clear it out,
clear it out because a,

1460
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:01,410
I was thinking today too,
I think I was telling you earlier,

1461
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:06,411
I changed my whole viewpoint on,
on gun control two weeks ago and did a 

1462
01:05:06,411 --> 01:05:07,240
lot of research and,
and,

1463
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,540
and it's like,
I think that there's a,

1464
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,840
there's two kinds of people.
There's people that will call people 

1465
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:14,840
when I make a mistake,
apologize,

1466
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,080
I tell I want to talk about shit.
If it's,

1467
01:05:16,110 --> 01:05:18,010
if it's under the and I

1468
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:23,010
want to,
I want the right to change my mind 

1469
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:23,010
later,
you know,

1470
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:25,890
and I think that that's,
that's the way I choose to go through 

1471
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:25,890
life.
I never want to fucking.

1472
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:27,730
And it's probably my family growing up,
Irish Catholic.

1473
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:32,500
I wrote this fucking book.
That was all the real shit from this was

1474
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:32,860
like,
uh,

1475
01:05:32,861 --> 01:05:37,861
I didn't,
I didn't think for one second when I 

1476
01:05:37,861 --> 01:05:37,861
wrote this book,
my mom's going to read this,

1477
01:05:37,861 --> 01:05:41,611
my aunt's going to read this.
I just fucking wrote my book and it's 

1478
01:05:41,611 --> 01:05:41,860
like,
you know,

1479
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:44,350
it was uh,
it was tough,

1480
01:05:44,351 --> 01:05:46,030
man.
I almost had a fucking nervous breakdown

1481
01:05:46,031 --> 01:05:46,810
doing it.
Uh,

1482
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:49,270
but that was like the point in my life 
where I think I went,

1483
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:50,680
you know,
I'm,

1484
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:54,010
I'm no longer going to do anything 
that's pandering.

1485
01:05:54,011 --> 01:05:59,011
I'm only going to be honest.
I'm only going to confront things in my 

1486
01:05:59,011 --> 01:06:00,040
life because I can't go back.
You know,

1487
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:05,041
I want to start my life in a sense over 
again and leave everything behind so I 

1488
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:08,821
don't want anything fucking connecting 
me to shit that I feel bad about from 

1489
01:06:08,821 --> 01:06:09,430
the past.
So I just like spit it all out,

1490
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:14,470
put it out there and now it's done.
And now this has done not the podcast.

1491
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,290
Please not the podcast.
I haven't gotten

1492
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,510
my plugs in yet.
No,

1493
01:06:17,511 --> 01:06:19,030
there's no plugs.
We can keep going.

1494
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,660
I'm glad.
I'm glad we got it out of the way to go.

1495
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:22,560
Uh,
you know,

1496
01:06:22,561 --> 01:06:27,561
we,
we actually worked together on the 

1497
01:06:27,561 --> 01:06:27,561
mantra as well,
you know,

1498
01:06:27,561 --> 01:06:27,561
it came up,
you know,

1499
01:06:27,561 --> 01:06:28,340
cause I had an issue,
you know,

1500
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,450
and then they said,
what about Greg Fitzsimmons?

1501
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,110
And I was like,
you just fucking talented,

1502
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:33,130
you know,
for sure.

1503
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:33,540
Hiram.

1504
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:36,140
I was shocked,
really shocked.

1505
01:06:36,141 --> 01:06:41,141
I was like,
it reaffirmed what I just said that 

1506
01:06:41,141 --> 01:06:41,141
you're like that.
Also like,

1507
01:06:41,141 --> 01:06:42,290
you know,
I'm not gonna guys get over Shit.

1508
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:43,370
Well,
you know,

1509
01:06:43,371 --> 01:06:48,371
bottom line is there's no way I could 
hold a grudge that long a and B,

1510
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:50,860
you're fucking talented.
And it was like,

1511
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:52,010
it was a,
it was like,

1512
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:53,810
it wasn't even a thing.
It wasn't like,

1513
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,010
like,
man should we work with.

1514
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,780
It was like,
of course we should work with them.

1515
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,430
You're a funny guy.
You know,

1516
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,410
you had a funny shit that I didn't even 
think would,

1517
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:02,580
could be funny.
And became funny that the uh,

1518
01:07:02,581 --> 01:07:05,840
the dead Ted Williams sketch that was 
fucking brilliant.

1519
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:08,390
Ted Williams frozen Ted Williams was 
awesome.

1520
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:11,330
That was turned out to be one of my 
favorite sketches because I don't give a

1521
01:07:11,331 --> 01:07:12,680
fuck about baseball.
So I was like,

1522
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:13,300
no,
no,

1523
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:14,360
I don't,
I don't understand it.

1524
01:07:14,361 --> 01:07:14,920
But it was great.

1525
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:15,530
Yeah,
it was,

1526
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,030
it was tough.
You were fucking,

1527
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:19,680
you were working.
That was non stop.

1528
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,770
It was a disaster.
You would show up like,

1529
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:26,780
you know,
at night when you were done taping all 

1530
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:27,470
day and then write all night and then go
back out.

1531
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,320
It was a disaster.
I was working way too much.

1532
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:32,320
I was doing fear factor and the mantra 
at the same time.

1533
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:35,470
And we had all the sudden,
like the,

1534
01:07:35,471 --> 01:07:38,170
they had completely changed how they 
were approaching it.

1535
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,330
Like Doug and I got completely 
hoodwinked.

1536
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:43,390
We thought that it was going to be like,
they literally told me like,

1537
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:45,130
you know,
have nudity,

1538
01:07:45,131 --> 01:07:46,870
we'll blur it out.
Swear,

1539
01:07:46,871 --> 01:07:48,430
we'll beep it out.
You can go wild.

1540
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:50,170
If we get sued,
it would be a good thing.

1541
01:07:50,171 --> 01:07:51,670
We can use the publicity.
And I'm like,

1542
01:07:51,671 --> 01:07:53,290
let's get fucking crazy.
I'm like,

1543
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:54,000
let's do it.
Um,

1544
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:55,340
you know,
Stan hopes and I'm in,

1545
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,080
come on,
let's go.

1546
01:07:56,081 --> 01:07:57,190
We're going to fucking change the 
manager.

1547
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:59,530
And then once we started,
that doesn't sound like the man show.

1548
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,440
That's not the man show.
That is not how the man show used to be.

1549
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:07,441
Like they had never had power.
I found out that Jimmy and Adam had 

1550
01:08:07,441 --> 01:08:09,550
given up the power so that they can have
creative control.

1551
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:10,270
They didn't,
they,

1552
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:10,870
they're like,
look,

1553
01:08:10,871 --> 01:08:15,871
you could,
you could own this fucking piece of 

1554
01:08:15,871 --> 01:08:15,871
shit.
Just don't just leave us alone,

1555
01:08:15,871 --> 01:08:19,410
you know,
just let us come up with their own 

1556
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:19,410
style.

1557
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:21,130
Like they had.
They had had to give it up to get 

1558
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:22,781
creative control.
That's why it was good because once you 

1559
01:08:22,781 --> 01:08:22,781
get in there and you remember what it 
was like,

1560
01:08:22,781 --> 01:08:23,300
it was nuts.

1561
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:28,400
It was the beginning of comedy central 
becoming a really uncreative place to 

1562
01:08:28,531 --> 01:08:31,200
develop and do things and it was,
you know,

1563
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:35,910
it was the studio and the network it.
We're probably six.

1564
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,470
All women,
all women.

1565
01:08:37,471 --> 01:08:39,990
Every note on the man show was coming 
from women,

1566
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,730
which isn't to say they weren't 
talented,

1567
01:08:41,731 --> 01:08:43,620
are funny.
It just always struck me of like,

1568
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:46,650
do these people really have the voice of
the show?

1569
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:52,040
They don't.
I don't think women were watching the 

1570
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:52,040
man show.

1571
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,220
One of the big things was Joey Diaz.
I wanted Joey Diaz naked at the 

1572
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:55,640
beginning of every show.
That was a mistake.

1573
01:08:55,641 --> 01:08:56,960
He would kick open the door,
go,

1574
01:08:56,961 --> 01:09:00,350
let's get this party.
Everybody would go crazy.

1575
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:05,560
Zoe was comedy central executive crying.
Why you tell me?

1576
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:10,720
Why is that funny?
That's not going to be funny with this 

1577
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:10,720
is not what we wanted to do with the 
show.

1578
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,050
She was literally in tears.
I'm like,

1579
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:14,480
first of all,
there's no crying in comedy period.

1580
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:15,130
Right?
There's,

1581
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:18,650
that's fucking ridiculous.
At second of all,

1582
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:21,890
you know,
I know I understood her point of view.

1583
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,050
She's an intelligent woman.
It's offensive to her.

1584
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:27,500
To her it's not funny.
She wants well scripted.

1585
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,570
We know well crafted,
you know,

1586
01:09:29,571 --> 01:09:32,770
really clever pieces and bits that 
appeal to understand this.

1587
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:37,870
How ever win a fucking 350 pound fat 
Cuban guy with a baseball hat and 

1588
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:41,570
timberlands comes running out as balls 
are like grapefruit and old ladies.

1589
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:45,800
Pantyhose and his Dick is big and it's 
flapping around on his giant belly.

1590
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:50,270
You cannot not laugh when he's going,
let's get this party started.

1591
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:55,450
So we made a deal.
We'll do it your way and then we'll do 

1592
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:55,450
it my way.
So we did it her way.

1593
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:56,450
Nice big thing,
big cheer.

1594
01:09:56,451 --> 01:09:58,130
Everybody gets crazy.
We started the show.

1595
01:09:58,131 --> 01:09:59,060
Okay,
take two.

1596
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:04,270
We do it.
The second time show ideas comes out 

1597
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:04,270
naked in the police,
falls apart.

1598
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:08,350
People are,
they're giving them standing ovations 

1599
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:10,541
and cheering and Joey's dancing and then
he brings us out and it was perfect.

1600
01:10:10,941 --> 01:10:13,970
Yeah.
And then that was the beginning of many,

1601
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:15,620
many problems that we had.
It just,

1602
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:20,800
I should have never tried.
I shouldn't never tried to do a show at 

1603
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,280
the same time as doing another show and 
on top of that I should have never tried

1604
01:10:22,281 --> 01:10:23,360
to do someone else's show.

1605
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:24,370
Well,
that's.

1606
01:10:24,371 --> 01:10:25,000
Yeah,
I mean,

1607
01:10:25,001 --> 01:10:26,410
look,
that's a fucking tough.

1608
01:10:26,411 --> 01:10:31,411
When you look at the fact that the 
office turned out a different office 

1609
01:10:31,411 --> 01:10:34,150
that is now as good as the original is a
fucking miracle.

1610
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,220
Amazing.
Luke doesn't happen.

1611
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:38,710
Not talented people.
Obviously they.

1612
01:10:38,711 --> 01:10:43,711
They figured it out there and those same
people could have taken a different 

1613
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:46,390
premise starting from scratch and been 
where they are today,

1614
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:48,640
shaking a,
taking a show that already existed.

1615
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:51,040
You're not getting any boost data that 
you're.

1616
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:56,041
All you're doing is fighting off the old
image and trying to recreate the new 

1617
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:56,041
one,
so why not just start with the new one?

1618
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:56,190
I think

1619
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:01,460
America was so distant.
It was a distant memory in people's 

1620
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:02,340
minds.
There was this English office,

1621
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:07,341
like there's a giant chunk of the 
population that had no idea and the 

1622
01:11:07,341 --> 01:11:11,600
people that were fans of the office 
tuned in out of curiosity and the other 

1623
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:11,600
people tuned in after.
Yeah,

1624
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,640
I've heard it's really good.
I heard it's really good,

1625
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:18,170
you know,
like it was not known enough so like 

1626
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:18,170
slipped in.

1627
01:11:18,170 --> 01:11:18,640
But you were doing it on the same 
channel?

1628
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:21,580
Yeah,
with the same name and the same set.

1629
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:23,160
Yeah.
You see,

1630
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:25,810
and the thing is,
it's like that was truly.

1631
01:11:25,811 --> 01:11:28,540
I mean Adam and Jimmy had worked 
together in radio.

1632
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,870
They had a fucking chemistry and a 
fluidity.

1633
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:37,020
You and doug are both Alpha males who do
stand up alone and then all of a sudden 

1634
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:37,750
it was like,
should we sit on stools?

1635
01:11:37,751 --> 01:11:39,310
Should we stand up?
And I was always just like,

1636
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:44,340
no,
Joe should go out and tear it up for 

1637
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:44,340
five minutes.
Then Doug should.

1638
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,910
Then they should throw the clips that 
they are both in but the two to you 

1639
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:47,910
standing on stage together,
which was weird.

1640
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:48,800
Yeah,
it didn't work.

1641
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:49,940
You know,
we should've done.

1642
01:11:49,941 --> 01:11:54,080
We should've,
we should've looked like after the first

1643
01:11:54,081 --> 01:11:55,100
time didn't work.
We should've said,

1644
01:11:55,101 --> 01:11:56,080
listen,
we should just read.

1645
01:11:56,240 --> 01:12:01,240
The only way we could ever do this 
correctly is if we just stopped calling 

1646
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,840
it the man show and it becomes a new 
thing because you just can't say,

1647
01:12:02,841 --> 01:12:04,100
that's not me.
Like they would be like,

1648
01:12:04,101 --> 01:12:06,290
that's not man show.
That's not man show.

1649
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:09,230
Especially remember when Janet Jackson's
nipple thing happened,

1650
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:12,380
we got fucked.
We lost like half of our monologues.

1651
01:12:12,381 --> 01:12:14,510
We lost a bunch of bits we couldn't do 
now.

1652
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,860
Oh,
because everything tightened up.

1653
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:16,550
Everything.
Yeah.

1654
01:12:16,551 --> 01:12:16,870
Yeah.

1655
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:22,020
Realize that,
that stupid stunt had a big impact 

1656
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:23,250
because the dummies that run these 
networks,

1657
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:26,280
they just don't want to lose their jobs.
So they'd go into panic mode.

1658
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:28,510
We've got to react to this trend of 
trucks.

1659
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:33,920
You give me anything you have that could
cause us trouble because now the 

1660
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:33,920
microscope of the media is going to be,
you know,

1661
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,120
people are going to be like peering into
every single show looking for anything 

1662
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:41,481
that's possibly offensive while this 
whole wave of indignation washes through

1663
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:44,940
the nation because someone saw a woman's
tit during the dinner hour

1664
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:45,580
did,
uh,

1665
01:12:45,581 --> 01:12:50,581
um,
one of the sketches that I wrote was 

1666
01:12:50,581 --> 01:12:52,631
called a ill suitors and it was like a 
dating service for men that didn't want 

1667
01:12:52,631 --> 01:12:56,171
longterm relationships,
pair it up with women that had terminal 

1668
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:57,080
illnesses and one of the scenes.
And it was all like,

1669
01:12:57,081 --> 01:13:02,081
you know,
Doug had this funny idea of like she's 

1670
01:13:02,081 --> 01:13:04,331
in a wheelchair on the beach trying to 
wheel through the sand and he's running 

1671
01:13:04,331 --> 01:13:04,650
in slow motion towards her and it,
it,

1672
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,220
it ends with like,
it was supposed to end with him.

1673
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:11,150
I'm making out with this woman in bed 
with his hand up her shirt.

1674
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,730
And then it goes to him giving mouth to 
mouth and pushing it.

1675
01:13:13,731 --> 01:13:15,120
And then they just,
they killed that.

1676
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:20,150
It was like we had no ending.
And so we had all these funny ideas of 

1677
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:20,150
like,
you know,

1678
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:21,620
you could,
you could order like a three day weekend

1679
01:13:21,621 --> 01:13:23,750
special of bird flu,
you know,

1680
01:13:23,751 --> 01:13:28,751
you have different diseases that matched
up with how long you want it to stay in 

1681
01:13:28,751 --> 01:13:28,751
the relationship.

1682
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:37,470
It was weird too because Giana sorta 
took over the show and he became like 

1683
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:38,650
the voice of it and you know,
he was the amount mayonnaise,

1684
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:43,680
you know,
he's a fucking executive producer who's 

1685
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,451
got to listen to the networks.
We never tried to do somebody else's 

1686
01:13:45,451 --> 01:13:45,451
show.

1687
01:13:45,451 --> 01:13:50,120
Now.
A lot of funny writers to Brian Posts 

1688
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:50,120
saying,
Ray James,

1689
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,230
Chris Mcguire,
it's funny shit to let me shoot came out

1690
01:13:52,231 --> 01:13:54,720
of it.
Frank Sebastiano was awesome.

1691
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,620
I think he's the best writer in town,
period.

1692
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:58,770
Great.
Jesus.

1693
01:13:58,771 --> 01:14:00,430
It was good writers.
Yeah.

1694
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:01,890
Too Bad.
Yeah.

1695
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:03,260
Have Fun.
You know,

1696
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,100
you and doug still a keep in touch.

1697
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

1698
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,280
One of the things that came out of that 
was A.

1699
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,010
Doug and I were doing mushrooms the day 
the war broke out.

1700
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:14,320
We w we sat around the student's house 
in the desert.

1701
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:16,540
We did mushrooms and that day it was 
like,

1702
01:14:16,541 --> 01:14:18,210
right when we were planning to do,
uh,

1703
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:21,160
the man show,
the war broke out and they were,

1704
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:25,300
they were showing that there was going 
to be beginning war coverage at 5:00

1705
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,250
PM and stanhope goes,
Holy Shit,

1706
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:32,251
there's a kickoff and were tripping 
balls in the desert like where you could

1707
01:14:34,801 --> 01:14:37,200
barely focus on the TV because it's 
become a,

1708
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,360
a soup of pixels,
you know,

1709
01:14:39,361 --> 01:14:42,090
it's not really the TV anymore.
Wow.

1710
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,050
Yeah.
Interesting Times.

1711
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,020
That was a good time,
but I definitely shouldn't have done it.

1712
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,520
I'm glad I did it,
but I shouldn't have done it.

1713
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:48,760
Yeah.
Well who knew?

1714
01:14:48,761 --> 01:14:49,120
I mean,
I,

1715
01:14:49,121 --> 01:14:52,900
I've done a,
I've been on a couple of pilots at where

1716
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:56,260
people end shows actually tv shows where
people were double dipping,

1717
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,560
you know,
I wrote on Wanda Sykes Shell last year 

1718
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,621
and she was doing the adventures of old 
Christine and then coming over and 

1719
01:15:04,621 --> 01:15:09,031
trying to do her show on Fox at night 
and we never saw her while she's so 

1720
01:15:09,031 --> 01:15:13,351
fucking talented and like what an 
opportunity to have a black woman while 

1721
01:15:13,351 --> 01:15:15,250
Obama is president.
And you know,

1722
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,030
all these,
you know,

1723
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:21,140
and you had Sarah Palin running for us.
All the sudden the floodgates were open 

1724
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,830
and show was it,
it was just a straight up monologue,

1725
01:15:23,831 --> 01:15:25,780
remote piece,
round table talk,

1726
01:15:25,781 --> 01:15:27,790
shelf topical.
Because she's so talented,

1727
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:32,791
she's great,
but people don't give themselves enough 

1728
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:33,640
enough time to do things.
Right.

1729
01:15:33,641 --> 01:15:36,310
And if your name is on it,
you got to fucking drop.

1730
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:41,430
Either don't do it or drop everything 
and say like a tell again going back to 

1731
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:41,430
this show,
what you got to see?

1732
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:44,260
Dave's all porn.
That guy gave up so much fucking work.

1733
01:15:44,261 --> 01:15:49,261
He invested so much of his own money.
Tons of it into this show because his 

1734
01:15:49,261 --> 01:15:53,281
name was and it's picked up and is 
roadwork is up and is merchant and you 

1735
01:15:53,281 --> 01:15:53,410
know,
it's like this is you,

1736
01:15:53,411 --> 01:15:55,530
this you're fucking brand.
Yeah.

1737
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:57,190
Hmm.
So you blew it man.

1738
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:59,950
He really blew me.
How did that happen?

1739
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:03,400
How did it come to that?
Well,

1740
01:16:03,401 --> 01:16:05,110
you think you would want to do a show 
like that again?

1741
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,450
Like a weekly scat?
No,

1742
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:07,150
no,

1743
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,320
no.
I like this.

1744
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:09,910
This is really what it should have been 
doing all along.

1745
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:12,540
This is the most fun podcast.
It's just this is,

1746
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:13,690
you know,
I mean,

1747
01:16:13,691 --> 01:16:14,200
what,
what do you,

1748
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:15,550
what are you providing?
You know,

1749
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:20,640
when you have an hour television show,
you're supposed to be providing 

1750
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,481
entertainment.
You're supposed to be providing some 

1751
01:16:24,481 --> 01:16:26,221
sort of a release.
I think I'm better at entertainment 

1752
01:16:26,221 --> 01:16:26,221
doing this than I am at all that other 
stuff.

1753
01:16:26,221 --> 01:16:27,010
Yeah.
I think writing.

1754
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:29,140
I can write.
I know how to make sketches.

1755
01:16:29,141 --> 01:16:30,840
I can make funny stuff.
I absolutely can.

1756
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:32,140
It's fun.
I enjoy doing it.

1757
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:35,770
I enjoy this more and between this and 
stand up comedy.

1758
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:40,800
Those are like my two favorite things.
Like the only reason why I ever did 

1759
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:40,800
acting is because they gave me money to 
do acting.

1760
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,120
Yeah.
I mean I had to do acting because I did 

1761
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,491
MTV and I got a development team and all
of a sudden I'm doing a pilot for a 

1762
01:16:47,491 --> 01:16:51,781
sitcom,
but I never really wanted to be an 

1763
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:51,781
actor.
So it's not that appealing to me.

1764
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:51,960
And then when you hang out with them,
you realize,

1765
01:16:51,961 --> 01:16:53,170
well,
there were fucking Weirdos,

1766
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:57,850
weird fucking pretentious self absorbed.
Strange fucking people,

1767
01:16:57,851 --> 01:16:58,840
man.
They're odd.

1768
01:16:58,870 --> 01:17:01,360
Nobody's saying a truthful thing all 
day.

1769
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:02,940
Oh,
everyone's trying to be.

1770
01:17:02,941 --> 01:17:07,941
This was the same person.
The person that like is everyone that 

1771
01:17:07,941 --> 01:17:08,760
everyone accepts.
You know the person that you know,

1772
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:10,520
everyone.
Everyone's liberal.

1773
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:11,820
Everyone is like,
you know,

1774
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,820
thinking about going Vegan.
You know everyone.

1775
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:13,900
Yeah.

1776
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:15,310
And everyone's unflappable.
Yeah.

1777
01:17:15,311 --> 01:17:17,980
Nobody's ever sweating.
Nobody's ever scared.

1778
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:23,190
It's just always got to be confident.
You got to always show people you're 

1779
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:23,190
relaxed.

1780
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:23,670
Weird,
weird.

1781
01:17:23,671 --> 01:17:26,160
A disconnected and test with your 
fucking life.

1782
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:28,470
I've met people that are obsessed with 
success,

1783
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:30,510
but they're varied there.
There's a,

1784
01:17:30,511 --> 01:17:34,980
there's a fucking sameness to the actor.
The douche.

1785
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:38,040
There's a sameness to them that's 
shocking because it doesn't make sense.

1786
01:17:38,041 --> 01:17:43,041
Doesn't seem to exist in other things in
people that there's people that develop 

1787
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:45,030
like a hardness if like they're in the 
financial business,

1788
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:47,830
you know,
there's like a cut throat aspect to like

1789
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:50,810
stocks and bonds and treasuries and 
there's a,

1790
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:52,290
there's,
there's similarities,

1791
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:55,130
but they're very more.
The actor is like,

1792
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,970
one thing,
you know,

1793
01:17:56,971 --> 01:18:01,110
it's like Strip club Dj.
Hey everybody dances on the table.

1794
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:06,200
The big girls come in.
They all have the same voice strip club 

1795
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,990
Djs have the same voice and actors have 
the same or something.

1796
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,040
I was thinking about this the other day.
It's not always

1797
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,120
you go in,
but when you go in and audition,

1798
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:18,121
there are so many.
It's like watching the fucking 

1799
01:18:18,121 --> 01:18:18,121
Westminster dog show.
You walk in,

1800
01:18:18,121 --> 01:18:20,170
you sign in,
you schmooze with the other actors,

1801
01:18:20,171 --> 01:18:25,171
you look at your lines.
Then when you walk in you got to say 

1802
01:18:25,171 --> 01:18:26,890
something clever and you a mile 
flirtation with the casting director.

1803
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:31,750
Then you say something that's a little 
bit naughty and then you start the scene

1804
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:36,930
and then you finish it and they tell you
you're fucking great and you tell them 

1805
01:18:36,930 --> 01:18:37,930
it's great seeing you walk out like you 
don't need the job.

1806
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:43,200
Then you get in your car in the parking 
garage and you start slamming your head 

1807
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,130
against the steering wheel and hating 
yourself and then waiting for the call.

1808
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:49,060
Yeah,
I only got into acting for money,

1809
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,170
you know,
and I don't.

1810
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:55,230
That's not what I started doing,
stand up for and once I realized that I 

1811
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,140
can make a living without acting,
you know,

1812
01:18:56,141 --> 01:18:57,700
I,
I kind of shied away from,

1813
01:18:57,730 --> 01:19:01,030
I don't even act at all for like 10 
years until I did a Kevin James Movie.

1814
01:19:01,031 --> 01:19:02,010
The zookeeper moving.
Yeah.

1815
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:07,160
I hadn't done anything like 10 years.
I just don't stand up and acting is 

1816
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:07,570
work.
That's a job standing up.

1817
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:12,680
It's not a job.
Even when the hard part coming up with 

1818
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:12,680
new material and putting together a new 
hour and you know,

1819
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,500
trying to structure it and you know,
in worrying,

1820
01:19:14,501 --> 01:19:15,940
you know,
how are you going to fill time,

1821
01:19:15,941 --> 01:19:16,700
how you gonna Start.
Don't,

1822
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,520
don't forget anything.
I don't want to go up notes though.

1823
01:19:18,521 --> 01:19:19,210
Fuck,
okay.

1824
01:19:19,211 --> 01:19:19,870
I got it.
I got it.

1825
01:19:19,871 --> 01:19:22,840
Got It.
That's still the kind of work is nothing

1826
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:24,700
compared to the work of doing somebody 
else's

1827
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:25,320
stuff.
Yeah,

1828
01:19:25,321 --> 01:19:30,321
because in standup you get back exactly 
what you put into it and I find 

1829
01:19:30,321 --> 01:19:30,321
sometimes I go on the road and I'll be 
like,

1830
01:19:30,321 --> 01:19:31,990
wow,
I just work two weekends in a row.

1831
01:19:31,991 --> 01:19:36,991
I don't have a single new joke.
What the fuck did I just go collect a 

1832
01:19:36,991 --> 01:19:40,471
paycheck is if I did,
I need to get another line of work 

1833
01:19:40,471 --> 01:19:40,930
because it's.
I got kids at home that's too precious.

1834
01:19:40,931 --> 01:19:43,540
If I'm going to be away,
I got to be creating.

1835
01:19:43,541 --> 01:19:46,480
I got to be doing the thing that got me 
into the business in the first place and

1836
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,810
that's what ultimately leads to more 
success.

1837
01:19:48,811 --> 01:19:52,090
As you got to go back to that fun,
that danger,

1838
01:19:52,091 --> 01:19:55,180
that need you gotta you gotta need it.
When you get up there,

1839
01:19:55,240 --> 01:20:00,240
you know,
talking to you today about guys who get 

1840
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:00,240
older,
they lose.

1841
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:00,250
They're funny because they get too,
too rich,

1842
01:20:00,251 --> 01:20:01,810
too comfortable.
They don't need it when they get up.

1843
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:02,530
Well,
we were talking,

1844
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:05,730
we were playing pool about bands that 
just no one even wants to hear any other

1845
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:06,610
new shit.
Yeah.

1846
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:10,130
But then other bands,
every time there's a new blank album,

1847
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:15,150
you know,
people are interested like the rolling 

1848
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:15,150
stones released an album recently.
You did you know that was it a rerelease

1849
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:16,370
of old stuff?
I don't know.

1850
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:20,100
Somebody told me that the role I should 
should be sure before I say that.

1851
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,710
Well,
spring one and I can't wait to get it.

1852
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:23,790
I heard that there.
It's good.

1853
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:26,250
People have been saying that.
It's good.

1854
01:20:26,290 --> 01:20:28,300
I think I feel the same way about the 
chili peppers.

1855
01:20:28,301 --> 01:20:30,370
I still and some people,
a lot of people disagree.

1856
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:32,710
I think that they're putting out their 
best stuff now.

1857
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,660
California cation is a great fucking 
song.

1858
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,520
Has a great song.
That was a member,

1859
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:39,590
Brian,
when we were in Phoenix.

1860
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:41,330
That was like the theme song for 
Phoenix.

1861
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,340
It would just come out.
It was so good.

1862
01:20:43,341 --> 01:20:44,450
We're like,
play it again.

1863
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,560
Play that shit again.

1864
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,520
Yeah.
They got another new album that came out

1865
01:20:47,521 --> 01:20:49,170
about six months ago.
That's dynamite.

1866
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,290
Subcategories.
That doesn't have it.

1867
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:54,180
I'm looking at their albums coming up 
next.

1868
01:20:54,181 --> 01:20:57,810
We got the Chili peppers that you 
followed by the stones.

1869
01:20:57,811 --> 01:21:02,811
New CD CT bed on stage.
How many guys get to do that voice?

1870
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:05,610
There's a lot of guys that make a living
doing that voice.

1871
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,500
My Dad was one really.
Well,

1872
01:21:07,501 --> 01:21:08,480
he was a.
He was a.

1873
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:09,930
well,
he was a broadcaster.

1874
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:14,931
He's doing,
he did exactly what we're doing right 

1875
01:21:14,931 --> 01:21:14,931
now,
except he introduced records.

1876
01:21:14,931 --> 01:21:18,111
He wasn't a cheese ball,
but he was one of the biggest disc 

1877
01:21:18,111 --> 01:21:18,111
jockeys in New York for 20 years.
Wow.

1878
01:21:18,111 --> 01:21:19,590
So you grew up with that?
Yeah.

1879
01:21:19,591 --> 01:21:22,530
I grew up going in and watching them 
have show business.

1880
01:21:22,531 --> 01:21:24,810
You grew up like looking at it?
Yeah,

1881
01:21:24,811 --> 01:21:27,510
he was famous in New York.
I mean we couldn't walk down the street.

1882
01:21:27,511 --> 01:21:30,140
Everybody fits a hey fits,
you know,

1883
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:35,150
and yeah,
it was pretty cool and kind of talk 

1884
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:37,521
radio that he'd do.
He did real liberal spewing hate 

1885
01:21:37,521 --> 01:21:37,521
callers,
you know,

1886
01:21:37,521 --> 01:21:42,111
people that couldn't stand him and he'd 
take them on and he was tough guy from 

1887
01:21:42,111 --> 01:21:43,290
the bronx and he could back it up.
Smart Guy.

1888
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:48,530
You remember that?
That was like the only time audience 

1889
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:48,530
members could interact before twitter.
You know,

1890
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:53,510
now people get fucking shit on you when 
people used to be able to catch you on 

1891
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:53,510
the phone.
Yeah.

1892
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:57,031
Yeah.
I just want to say I think you're a 

1893
01:21:57,031 --> 01:21:57,031
fucking bum.
Yeah.

1894
01:21:57,031 --> 01:21:57,031
It'd be able to call you,
hop like,

1895
01:21:57,031 --> 01:21:58,200
oh,
we're going to go to the phone calls.

1896
01:21:58,201 --> 01:22:00,270
All they're bubbling with anger,
you know,

1897
01:22:00,271 --> 01:22:05,271
you could pretty much be filtered from 
most of them unless you went on a few 

1898
01:22:05,271 --> 01:22:05,271
shows.

1899
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:06,080
Well,
I get the,

1900
01:22:06,081 --> 01:22:06,630
uh,
I,

1901
01:22:06,631 --> 01:22:09,770
I do a show still on Sirius xm on 
stearns channel and nate,

1902
01:22:09,771 --> 01:22:12,650
we get a call screen that shows me like 
whatever,

1903
01:22:12,651 --> 01:22:15,020
seven or eight calls their name,
where they're from,

1904
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:17,750
what they want to talk about.
And if it says thanks,

1905
01:22:17,751 --> 01:22:19,760
you're a piece of shit and you suck.
Like,

1906
01:22:19,761 --> 01:22:21,350
hey,
how you doing bill and Denver,

1907
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:26,570
those are the only calls I take.
I love it because I know that after two 

1908
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:27,740
or three minutes they're going to go up 
fucking around and do it.

1909
01:22:27,741 --> 01:22:32,741
I love you.
Or just silence and a hang up because 

1910
01:22:32,741 --> 01:22:33,770
they couldn't back up.
They're opening fucking barrage.

1911
01:22:33,771 --> 01:22:35,220
They couldn't back up.
Hey Greg,

1912
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,290
I should preface this by saying,
Greg,

1913
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:41,790
Greg is a one of those guys will every 
now and then,

1914
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:46,791
like today or yesterday,
I got a message from who the fuck is 

1915
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:50,001
this guy?
Some guy on twitter that's given them a 

1916
01:22:50,001 --> 01:22:50,001
hard time.
Do you know what this fucking guy is?

1917
01:22:50,001 --> 01:22:51,720
I'll tell you what these fucking cowards
face to face,

1918
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:56,400
like actually you actually get you pull 
your pants.

1919
01:22:56,401 --> 01:22:58,500
I'm going to get off my lawn.
You actually,

1920
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:00,420
you will fucking.
You'll engage them.

1921
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,940
I must got in a fistfight the other day.
Whoa.

1922
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,080
Onstage.
Other night I was in Chicago,

1923
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:05,980
did get into a

1924
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,990
fistfight in Boston.
Many,

1925
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:13,050
many in Boston at the stitches.
Didn't some guy come on stage and you 

1926
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:13,840
got in a fistfight with them.
This.

1927
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:18,870
They separate you.
Everything gets separated and then greg 

1928
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:18,870
goes,
all right,

1929
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:23,450
next.
I got my ass kicked.

1930
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,300
Yeah,
he's fucking.

1931
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:27,290
He's just gonna

1932
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:31,280
the army and he's spinning me around 
like a fucking helicopter.

1933
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:37,490
No video.
The guy with the guitar,

1934
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:41,660
some guy beat the fucking dude in the 
audience over the head with a guitar.

1935
01:23:41,661 --> 01:23:43,610
And that was back when people didn't 
videotape shit.

1936
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:48,640
That was magic because it was actually 
nowadays you probably can find that all 

1937
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:49,160
over the places.
That was legendary,

1938
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:50,880
but no,
I still get into fistfights.

1939
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:52,880
This guy was heckling me from the.
He heckled me.

1940
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:55,210
I'm new.
This joke about Hispanics and he goes,

1941
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,320
it goes back off.
I go,

1942
01:23:57,321 --> 01:23:59,000
what?
Back off I go,

1943
01:23:59,001 --> 01:24:00,410
what do you talk about?
Fun.

1944
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,260
And I asked for a wireless mic for this 
exact reason.

1945
01:24:03,261 --> 01:24:06,260
I can fucking walk right off.
He's in the back row places pack.

1946
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:09,410
Walk right up to his table.
What are you saying?

1947
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:11,420
You don't need to be talking about 
Hispanics.

1948
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:13,550
I go,
I just shit on Jewish people.

1949
01:24:13,551 --> 01:24:14,960
Chinese people,
Irish people,

1950
01:24:14,961 --> 01:24:17,060
black people.
You're relaxed in line.

1951
01:24:17,061 --> 01:24:19,030
I'm not even attack and nothing.
And he's,

1952
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:21,290
he's fucking fist clench looking at me.
I go,

1953
01:24:21,291 --> 01:24:22,610
come on man.
Come on.

1954
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:26,210
Come on man.
And I just fucking eye contact.

1955
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,270
I don't know what it is.
I am gone.

1956
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:36,770
I get crazy Irish,
Irish and I think it's also on stage.

1957
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:38,000
That's my fucking stage,
man.

1958
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:41,570
You're not,
you're in the audience now.

1959
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:42,240
Yeah,

1960
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:47,670
I remember I had a joke about Roswell,
New Mexico about the UFO crash and about

1961
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:49,870
how the government.
They're printed in the paper.

1962
01:24:49,871 --> 01:24:53,170
I actually have a day's newspaper,
the Roswell daily record.

1963
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,500
It's at my house in a frame.
And uh,

1964
01:24:55,501 --> 01:24:56,140
you know,
it's sad.

1965
01:24:56,141 --> 01:24:58,630
We have recovered a flying disc that you
had.

1966
01:24:58,631 --> 01:24:59,680
The government says,
you know,

1967
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:01,630
this is the first captured flying 
saucer.

1968
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:03,840
Then the next day they said,
oh,

1969
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:06,090
it was just a balloon.
I go,

1970
01:25:06,530 --> 01:25:07,810
what about the aliens?
I go,

1971
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,990
those are Mexicans.
Apparently they opened the balloon.

1972
01:25:10,991 --> 01:25:12,970
They were drinking,
so shenanigans took place,

1973
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:16,990
but they thought it was a Yada.
This chick stands up at the comedy store

1974
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:17,460
is like,

1975
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:22,730
don't be fucking talking about Mexicans.
We fucking talking about me.

1976
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,960
I go,
did you even listen to what I said?

1977
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,210
Like,
I'm not even making fun of Mexicans.

1978
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,670
I'm making fun of the government for,
for a,

1979
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,080
a lame,

1980
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:33,840
you know an excuse for this crashed ufo.

1981
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,490
You need a simple joke about the word 
aliens having two meetings.

1982
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:38,130
Yeah.
Not really much deeper than that.

1983
01:25:38,131 --> 01:25:39,860
It's Christ,
but no,

1984
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:41,920
I hit a hot mess.
Some people are so stupid.

1985
01:25:41,921 --> 01:25:43,810
Just the word is a hot button.
Oh,

1986
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:45,880
this is my favorite.
I'm doing a college and I do this joke.

1987
01:25:45,881 --> 01:25:47,080
It's probably.
You probably remember,

1988
01:25:47,081 --> 01:25:52,081
it is this fucking way long ago,
and I said in college I was on the crew 

1989
01:25:52,081 --> 01:25:52,081
team,
the rowing team,

1990
01:25:52,081 --> 01:25:57,001
and I didn't know anything about the 
sport except what I've seen those 

1991
01:25:57,001 --> 01:25:59,671
ancient Roman slave ship movies.
So I showed up for the first day of 

1992
01:25:59,671 --> 01:26:03,121
practice with a big drama in a whip and 
we won the league that year and we 

1993
01:26:03,121 --> 01:26:04,730
captured one of Harvard ships,
sold them off as slaves and the Adriatic

1994
01:26:04,731 --> 01:26:09,731
say stupid joke and exactly kind of joke
you probably hated me for when I was 

1995
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:09,731
kinda clever.

1996
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:12,240
Not that funny.
So paranoid.

1997
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:13,590
Hate you for,
you know.

1998
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:19,180
So I'm at the college.
I do that joke and this fucking black 

1999
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:22,121
chick goes,
you don't do no fucking jokes about 

2000
01:26:22,121 --> 01:26:22,121
slaves.
And I go,

2001
01:26:22,121 --> 01:26:22,460
Ma'am Ma'am,
collect yourself.

2002
01:26:22,461 --> 01:26:25,430
Number one,
talking about Roman slaves.

2003
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:28,210
There were white.
He didn't corner the market on slavery.

2004
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:29,670
Sit down.
Oh,

2005
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:34,930
and fucking she wouldn't stop.
Wouldn't stop in the face of a fact that

2006
01:26:35,361 --> 01:26:40,361
went against her whole fucking.
So what are you saying that slavery has 

2007
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:44,321
never existed or that because blacks 
have been one of the groups that has 

2008
01:26:44,321 --> 01:26:47,240
been subjugated into slavery,
that you're defending all slavery.

2009
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:52,450
Is it just not on the table?
It should not be discussed because 

2010
01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:55,151
you're a college where you're supposed 
to discussion and break it down and I 

2011
01:26:55,151 --> 01:26:56,360
just went off on that rant.
Well,

2012
01:26:56,361 --> 01:26:59,870
I've found that colleges were more pc or
more,

2013
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:03,620
more like restricted and censored than 
anywhere.

2014
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:06,740
People will get upset if you would bring
up anything controversial,

2015
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:08,630
look at the board.
Anything racial,

2016
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:11,390
anything racial,
anything sexist,

2017
01:27:11,391 --> 01:27:13,580
anything homophobic,
but you can't.

2018
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,800
There's a difference between racist and 
racial.

2019
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:21,080
Does the difference between discussing 
homosexuality and homophobic and they 

2020
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,450
can't make that distinction.
It's all buzzwords and just real,

2021
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:28,470
you know,
real facts about humanity that people 

2022
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:28,470
don't want you to talk about when it 
comes to,

2023
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:29,690
you know,
a bunch of different race.

2024
01:27:29,691 --> 01:27:31,340
It's fascinating.
It's part of a.

2025
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:36,610
You know,
what's interesting about life is 

2026
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:36,610
discussing what different people do in 
different parts of the world.

2027
01:27:36,610 --> 01:27:41,441
You know,
and I love that when you bring up 

2028
01:27:41,441 --> 01:27:41,441
religion onstage and somebody gets 
upset,

2029
01:27:41,441 --> 01:27:45,030
like I'll say I don't believe in the 10 
commandments and then you see somebody 

2030
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:46,130
crossed her arms and get pissed and I 
just stopped to.

2031
01:27:46,131 --> 01:27:46,970
Okay,
hold on lady.

2032
01:27:47,390 --> 01:27:48,470
Am I a preacher?

2033
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:51,500
Did you hire me to fucking lecture?
I'm a Dick joke comic.

2034
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:56,530
I tell jokes to drunks.
If you're looking at me as the guidance 

2035
01:27:56,530 --> 01:27:59,660
in you or anybody else's life,
you're a fucking idiot.

2036
01:27:59,661 --> 01:28:01,010
You know,
I'm a comic.

2037
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:06,310
We're the lowest,
the lowest fucking form of speech in 

2038
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:06,310
society.
You know,

2039
01:28:06,310 --> 01:28:08,780
we're not supposed to talk radio's lower
than us.

2040
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:11,660
Go Fill Henry.
Well that's good.

2041
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:13,370
He's really good.
Just coming on my show next week.

2042
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:17,880
Is He,
he's a professional troll to Gretchen's.

2043
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:20,180
Been up to lately.
Troll before the Internet.

2044
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:23,340
He's doing a,
I think he's got a lot of podcast stuff,

2045
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:24,810
website,
but he's doing.

2046
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:28,250
He's still got an am show going in am 
radio as well.

2047
01:28:28,690 --> 01:28:31,220
Our Bro.
Like the highbrow.

2048
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:34,880
Well now you know they're doing a lot of
sports is going to fm now.

2049
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:37,790
Sports talk really because people want 
to hear sports talk,

2050
01:28:37,791 --> 01:28:40,010
but young generations don't even tune 
into him.

2051
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:41,720
They just don't.
They don't even look.

2052
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:42,790
Yeah,
so it's like,

2053
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:46,010
am was just losing v listeners.
People are dying off.

2054
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:47,900
He had.
The only time I've ever put on aim is to

2055
01:28:47,901 --> 01:28:49,400
hear a sports game,
which is where,

2056
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:52,310
because I don't listen to sports for 
traffic and news.

2057
01:28:52,311 --> 01:28:53,450
Like if you're in your car and you're 
like,

2058
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:58,480
shit,
I need to know what's going on because 

2059
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:58,480
they always have like that every 10 
minutes.

2060
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:59,990
I only used to listen to when our bill 
was on the art bell was on.

2061
01:28:59,991 --> 01:29:01,480
I am.
I'd be coming home from the comedy store

2062
01:29:01,481 --> 01:29:02,010
at 1:00
in

2063
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,480
the morning,
listen to art bell,

2064
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:04,940
talking to some dude who

2065
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:10,490
just got here from Mars.
Hard the best fucking show ever for 

2066
01:29:10,621 --> 01:29:13,560
driving by yourself late at night,
you know,

2067
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:18,090
because it was always some fucking Ufo 
shit or cloning or pre podcast.

2068
01:29:18,091 --> 01:29:20,160
So you can listen to something different
if you.

2069
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:23,760
Yeah.
But it was nothing like that on the air.

2070
01:29:23,761 --> 01:29:28,761
You know,
like you could actually get your call 

2071
01:29:28,761 --> 01:29:30,951
through because it's late at night on a 
and it's got three guys on the line 

2072
01:29:30,951 --> 01:29:30,951
tops.
Well,

2073
01:29:30,951 --> 01:29:32,970
didn't he have a guy who called and said
that he was in area 50?

2074
01:29:32,971 --> 01:29:37,971
I'm calling from area 51 there and then 
like at the end he like yells and hangs 

2075
01:29:37,971 --> 01:29:39,690
up the phone and saying that they 
fucking captured.

2076
01:29:39,691 --> 01:29:41,430
I'm just trying to tell them where they 
all the UFO was.

2077
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,290
Our and all those security that we've 
got down here.

2078
01:29:43,291 --> 01:29:46,190
We have seven craft.
I can't believe I'm telling you this for

2079
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:50,160
77 shape crafts operate.
We don't understand what it is they send

2080
01:29:50,161 --> 01:29:52,420
us in here to back engineer.
I'm sure going.

2081
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,140
Let me just hang up the phone

2082
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:01,300
wells all over again.
I probably was Phil Henry.

2083
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:02,730
What do you think in terms of.
All right,

2084
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:05,140
you got a big podcast?
I have A.

2085
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:09,790
I have a fairly big podcast,
but I feel like what the fuck?

2086
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:13,390
The future possibly hold.
Accept this free form.

2087
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:16,990
A all content.
No restriction radio.

2088
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:19,750
How does that compare for free?
Anywhere you want it,

2089
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:20,950
you can download it.
Listen,

2090
01:30:20,951 --> 01:30:24,070
when you want pause it.
How does that compare to.

2091
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:28,300
I gotta have it on it's streaming live.
It's censored.

2092
01:30:28,301 --> 01:30:33,301
This like how do you think in 10 years 
people are going to listen because it 

2093
01:30:33,301 --> 01:30:35,380
started as radio.
It's becoming.

2094
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:40,420
Then it was satellite podcasting.
Do you think this is the one that's 

2095
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:40,420
going to hold?

2096
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:41,660
Well,
I think there's a place for this.

2097
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,700
You know,
and this isn't the ultimate thing to sit

2098
01:30:43,701 --> 01:30:45,800
when you're home with your girl and you 
want to watch something on TV.

2099
01:30:45,801 --> 01:30:47,540
You don't want to sit and watch a 
fucking podcast,

2100
01:30:47,541 --> 01:30:52,541
you know?
I mean that's weird to sit and watch 

2101
01:30:52,541 --> 01:30:54,380
conversation.
I think you maybe want to watch a movie 

2102
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:54,380
or do you want to watch a sitcom or.
But for times,

2103
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:57,230
especially when you're doing boring 
labor,

2104
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:02,320
you know,
like you're fucking stacking boxes and 

2105
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,271
shit.
Like there's a lot of people that are 

2106
01:31:04,271 --> 01:31:04,271
listening to this right now that are 
working jobs.

2107
01:31:04,271 --> 01:31:07,131
Yeah.
And they either have an ipod on or they 

2108
01:31:07,131 --> 01:31:07,131
have a little,
you know,

2109
01:31:07,131 --> 01:31:08,350
a,
a player somewhere where it's a,

2110
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:08,990
you know,
an MP,

2111
01:31:08,991 --> 01:31:13,991
three player or whatever the fuck it is.
And they're there listening to this 

2112
01:31:13,991 --> 01:31:16,751
while they're driving in their cars,
they'll listen to this while they're on 

2113
01:31:16,751 --> 01:31:19,031
planes.
There's a place for this form of 

2114
01:31:19,031 --> 01:31:19,031
entertainment,
you know,

2115
01:31:19,031 --> 01:31:20,090
and that's why I really don't have any 
desire to do anything else.

2116
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:20,830
You know,
I've,

2117
01:31:20,890 --> 01:31:23,390
I've thought about doing other different
sorts of TV projects,

2118
01:31:23,391 --> 01:31:28,370
but really the best thing that I do is 
like this and stand up and then the UFC,

2119
01:31:28,371 --> 01:31:32,910
that's like enough stuff to venture off 
into more acting as well.

2120
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:34,970
Yeah.
Just pretending,

2121
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:35,160
you know.

2122
01:31:35,430 --> 01:31:35,880
Yeah.
When I,

2123
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:39,570
when I look at the fact that in standup 
and podcasting,

2124
01:31:39,571 --> 01:31:42,870
I can literally say anything except 
killed the president.

2125
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:45,480
It's mindbody.
What did you just,

2126
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:49,080
he's not mit is not president yet to 
say.

2127
01:31:49,081 --> 01:31:51,670
I think I can say kill Mitt Romney.
Oh,

2128
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:56,680
you can't,
you cannot know he's running for 

2129
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:56,680
president.
I'm just saying in theory.

2130
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:57,120
Um,
but I guess my,

2131
01:31:57,150 --> 01:32:02,150
my question really though is like,
do you think that eventually it's going 

2132
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:05,161
to be like you're going to turn on your 
radio in your car and it's going to be 

2133
01:32:05,161 --> 01:32:08,131
podcasts streaming or a Ford edge or 
Ford has the sync.

2134
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:14,070
Which has like a three g built into it 
and you can download like stitcher and 

2135
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:16,930
content and you need to get off 
stitcher.

2136
01:32:16,931 --> 01:32:19,390
I got off it.
I've gotten a little off it.

2137
01:32:19,391 --> 01:32:22,780
I've gotten everybody off it because 
they steal your content.

2138
01:32:22,781 --> 01:32:27,781
They cut and paste it.
You don't get any record of the 

2139
01:32:27,781 --> 01:32:29,881
downloads.
They've got charts and records they 

2140
01:32:29,881 --> 01:32:30,820
didn't use to end.
They're running ads.

2141
01:32:30,821 --> 01:32:32,620
They're running banner ads on your 
content,

2142
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:37,650
so this advertising going on your 
content that you're not participating 

2143
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:37,650
in.

2144
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:38,050
Yeah,
those little itunes ads,

2145
01:32:38,490 --> 01:32:40,570
those are million dollar ad.

2146
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:43,180
I don't know what it is,
but this is what I know.

2147
01:32:43,181 --> 01:32:48,181
This is what I know.
Stitcher is an easy resource to put 

2148
01:32:48,181 --> 01:32:50,671
something out that's already free.
My thing is already free and stitcher 

2149
01:32:50,671 --> 01:32:52,030
allows more people to get my free shit 
and that's how I look at it.

2150
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,680
A lot of people like it.
They use it.

2151
01:32:53,681 --> 01:32:58,681
I think it's a good deal.
To me it's just another distribution 

2152
01:32:58,681 --> 01:32:59,830
platform.
My advertisement is in on it.com,

2153
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:02,050
which I owned part of and in the 
fleshlight,

2154
01:33:02,051 --> 01:33:07,051
which has been our sponsor since we were
on a laptop with fucking snowflakes in 

2155
01:33:07,051 --> 01:33:07,051
the background,
you know,

2156
01:33:07,051 --> 01:33:08,830
so for me,
I liked stitcher.

2157
01:33:08,831 --> 01:33:10,630
I liked the fact that it gets to other 
people.

2158
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:13,330
Some people don't like it because it can
mess with your itunes,

2159
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,660
your ratings,
your itunes numbers,

2160
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:18,660
but we're always in the top 10 and we 
have,

2161
01:33:19,030 --> 01:33:22,810
we have every way you can get it,
you can download it as a free MP.

2162
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:24,080
Three,
you can have it through it,

2163
01:33:24,081 --> 01:33:26,800
an rss feed.
You can have it through Stitcher,

2164
01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:30,220
you can have it through you stream,
you can have it through vimeo.

2165
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:32,080
You know we have it on itunes.
You can.

2166
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:37,110
We make it as as readily available as 
you can get a copy of throat up on 

2167
01:33:37,110 --> 01:33:37,180
torrents.
Who Cares?

2168
01:33:37,181 --> 01:33:38,620
Do whatever you want with it.
It's out there,

2169
01:33:38,910 --> 01:33:40,710
but if you had,
say you had a CD,

2170
01:33:40,890 --> 01:33:41,940
right?
Somebody buys it,

2171
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:43,400
that's different.
All right,

2172
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,900
say somebody a say.
I mean,

2173
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:50,960
to me it doesn't even need a metaphor 
for content is being taken and sold.

2174
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:52,190
It stays here.

2175
01:33:52,210 --> 01:33:57,210
They have done a service for me and 
they've distributed to me to eat for do 

2176
01:33:57,210 --> 01:34:01,080
that service,
but I'm already doing that service and 

2177
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:01,080
they have expanded my market.
They've,

2178
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:05,010
they've given more people something that
I do and have a great product that I do 

2179
01:34:05,010 --> 01:34:08,950
for free anyway and I only do this.
I only do it for free,

2180
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:11,800
so if more people get my free podcast,
good.

2181
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:17,160
So if somebody is making a couple bucks 
selling little ads in order to 

2182
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:17,560
distribute my podcast,
that's what it's worth to them.

2183
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:23,250
I guess for me,
my issue is I have ads that I get paid 

2184
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:23,820
per download and that they weren't 
giving me the count on those,

2185
01:34:23,821 --> 01:34:28,821
so that was taking money out of my 
pocket and then on top of it when I 

2186
01:34:28,821 --> 01:34:28,890
found out that they were running ads on 
my content,

2187
01:34:28,891 --> 01:34:33,891
that's double.
That's a double whammy and to me it's 

2188
01:34:33,891 --> 01:34:34,740
like the more guys that are on Stitcher,
the more people just go,

2189
01:34:34,741 --> 01:34:39,741
well fuck it.
I'm just going to listen to podcast on 

2190
01:34:39,741 --> 01:34:41,661
stitcher instead of people going,
I'm not going to be on this thing 

2191
01:34:41,661 --> 01:34:41,661
because it's a bad business.

2192
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:45,700
You have a different sort of a take on 
it.

2193
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:47,650
You know,
my take on it is a,

2194
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:49,540
uh,
not based on.

2195
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:51,910
I didn't have a thing that would pay me 
based on downloads,

2196
01:34:51,911 --> 01:34:53,440
so that makes more sense that you'd be 
pissed.

2197
01:34:53,670 --> 01:34:54,120
Yeah.
But you know,

2198
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:56,100
you have the numbers,
you can give them those numbers of those

2199
01:34:56,101 --> 01:34:58,100
downloads.
I use stitcher so

2200
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,230
much because I liked the software,
you know,

2201
01:35:00,231 --> 01:35:02,720
that would actually be thing if you 
could work it into,

2202
01:35:02,721 --> 01:35:04,360
that'd be like the best solution.
Like it looks.

2203
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:07,610
I still have additional downloads 
outside of itunes.

2204
01:35:07,611 --> 01:35:08,390
Can we incorporate?
Yeah.

2205
01:35:08,391 --> 01:35:13,391
Why wouldn't you?
Because they're still legitimate 

2206
01:35:13,391 --> 01:35:13,391
listeners.
Yeah,

2207
01:35:13,391 --> 01:35:13,391
that's a good point.

2208
01:35:13,391 --> 01:35:15,070
I guess they,
I got myth because I only found,

2209
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:20,100
I found out about it and I emailed them.
They didn't respond and then when they 

2210
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:23,911
finally did,
they denied it and then when they were 

2211
01:35:23,911 --> 01:35:23,911
found to be,
oh no,

2212
01:35:23,911 --> 01:35:24,790
yeah,
we do do that,

2213
01:35:24,850 --> 01:35:27,070
but we'll give you like a penny per 
million.

2214
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:27,970
And it's like,
first of all,

2215
01:35:28,090 --> 01:35:33,090
don't make me an offer now that you've 
already stolen it and sold it and made 

2216
01:35:33,090 --> 01:35:35,380
money and now now you want to negotiate 
and give me a shitty offer.

2217
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:38,050
So I just thought these are bad people,
these are not.

2218
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:43,170
And I've had the same conversation with 
a number of big podcast who's who had 

2219
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:44,440
the same experience they do when they 
confronted them,

2220
01:35:44,441 --> 01:35:46,600
they denied it,
they made shitty offers,

2221
01:35:46,601 --> 01:35:48,940
they were disrespectful.
And it's to me,

2222
01:35:48,941 --> 01:35:51,970
it's setting up a business model to say 
down the road you do this.

2223
01:35:52,030 --> 01:35:53,140
Say you do.
Just say fuck it.

2224
01:35:53,141 --> 01:35:56,320
I'm doing four podcasts a week and I'm 
not gonna go on the road,

2225
01:35:56,470 --> 01:36:01,470
I'm going to sell ads.
Now all the sudden there's gonna be 

2226
01:36:01,470 --> 01:36:04,231
other,
a aggregator sites like stitcher that 

2227
01:36:04,231 --> 01:36:06,580
I've already called your rss feed.
Copied and pasted it.

2228
01:36:06,581 --> 01:36:11,581
So it's not connected.
And you're not getting counts public or 

2229
01:36:11,581 --> 01:36:11,581
rss feeds on your website?
Yes,

2230
01:36:11,581 --> 01:36:12,820
but they have to be,
you know,

2231
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:15,520
they have to stream through the my rss 
feed.

2232
01:36:15,521 --> 01:36:18,240
They can't just scream your rss feed 
though than that.

2233
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:18,940
But they don't.

2234
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:19,740
No,
no.

2235
01:36:19,741 --> 01:36:24,741
I mean the and that means that you're 
just saying that any player can do the 

2236
01:36:24,741 --> 01:36:24,741
same,

2237
01:36:24,741 --> 01:36:24,741
think,
stitcher,

2238
01:36:24,741 --> 01:36:25,490
we cannot have another artist argument.
Oh yeah,

2239
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:26,350
yeah,
let's do that.

2240
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,170
Let's talk about the.
Goddamn it's,

2241
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:33,490
but it is.
It is an important point that you're 

2242
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:33,700
bringing up and especially what you were
saying that you know,

2243
01:36:33,701 --> 01:36:35,860
you were getting paid by the download 
and I didn't.

2244
01:36:35,861 --> 01:36:40,861
I didn't have any experience with 
negotiating with them because to me it 

2245
01:36:40,861 --> 01:36:44,041
was nothing but a good thing,
so I didn't get to experience the lying 

2246
01:36:44,041 --> 01:36:47,371
or the whatever you say you experienced.
I didn't get to experience that because 

2247
01:36:47,371 --> 01:36:47,860
my take was right away was like,
okay,

2248
01:36:47,861 --> 01:36:49,540
good.
Then we'll now more people can hear it.

2249
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:53,510
We have hundreds of thousands of people 
that listen outside of Itunes,

2250
01:36:53,511 --> 01:36:57,820
so for us it's to have the more 
distribution that way.

2251
01:36:58,010 --> 01:36:59,650
Better institutions is actually really 
good people.

2252
01:36:59,651 --> 01:37:04,270
I had dinner with the president and he 
was giving them free content.

2253
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:04,600
No,
no,

2254
01:37:04,601 --> 01:37:05,710
no.
I probably love you.

2255
01:37:05,711 --> 01:37:09,550
I'm giving free content out to every 
single person in the world and they just

2256
01:37:09,551 --> 01:37:11,700
happen to have the,
a player that,

2257
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:12,430
that they,
uh,

2258
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,880
use it does the same thing in my mind.
Am I see,

2259
01:37:14,881 --> 01:37:19,881
I don't get what you and a few of the 
other podcasts you guys are saying 

2260
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:20,330
because you're,
you're giving something for free out.

2261
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:22,130
Didn't you have an argument with 
somebody?

2262
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:24,190
Fuck it.
I don't want to go down there.

2263
01:37:25,050 --> 01:37:26,830
That's just saying that I said my piece,

2264
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:28,050
you,
we're both,

2265
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:31,800
we're both going after different things 
with the podcast and I guess there's a,

2266
01:37:31,801 --> 01:37:32,760
there's going to be.
Look,

2267
01:37:32,761 --> 01:37:34,140
we're finding,
you know,

2268
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:39,270
podcasting is finding its footing and 
how it's going to be delivered and this 

2269
01:37:39,270 --> 01:37:42,030
will be an ongoing discussion and see.
See what makes most sense and what's the

2270
01:37:42,031 --> 01:37:42,750
most ethical.

2271
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:47,920
Yeah.
I mean a bunch of guys are doing 

2272
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:49,031
different things.
Like Marin I know has a thing where you 

2273
01:37:49,031 --> 01:37:50,690
can't get as old ones unless you pay 
your premium listeners premium,

2274
01:37:50,890 --> 01:37:52,390
you know you're done.
Yeah.

2275
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,140
I just think he's done really well with 
that.

2276
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:59,260
Yeah.
But it seems me like you charge someone 

2277
01:37:59,260 --> 01:37:59,260
for something that you also have for 
free,

2278
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:04,540
like why not just have it for free.
He's just trying to find new ways to 

2279
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:04,540
make money.
I know it seems weird,

2280
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:08,691
like you know,
like the old ones they have to pay for 

2281
01:38:08,691 --> 01:38:08,691
the old ones.
Like what's that?

2282
01:38:08,691 --> 01:38:10,830
You want them to get all your stuff if 
you want any of it free.

2283
01:38:10,831 --> 01:38:15,831
I just,
it seems to me that it should all be 

2284
01:38:15,831 --> 01:38:15,831
free.

2285
01:38:15,831 --> 01:38:18,280
Well I think so to a point.
I think that with a lot of times with 

2286
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:18,830
premium membership,
they take out the commercials,

2287
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,310
you know,
a lot of times like I have,

2288
01:38:21,330 --> 01:38:26,330
I have something to give away for free,
which is like the best fits dog radio 

2289
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:29,890
and it's just,
I got like five or six like Zach 

2290
01:38:29,890 --> 01:38:33,460
Galifianakis and Jimmy Kimmel,
like some bigger names and I sort of 

2291
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:33,460
took the best five,
six,

2292
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:35,740
eight minutes from each as a way of just
promoting the shell.

2293
01:38:35,741 --> 01:38:38,210
I'm putting it out there.
Originally I was thinking,

2294
01:38:38,211 --> 01:38:43,211
oh,
I should make a bunch of best ofs and 

2295
01:38:43,211 --> 01:38:43,211
sell them.
And I went,

2296
01:38:43,211 --> 01:38:43,211
no,
that doesn't make sense.

2297
01:38:43,211 --> 01:38:43,580
I'd rather drive people.
It's all about building.

2298
01:38:43,581 --> 01:38:45,290
I just want more and more people to 
experience it.

2299
01:38:45,350 --> 01:38:46,580
They like it.
Keep listening.

2300
01:38:46,581 --> 01:38:47,660
If not,
they tried it.

2301
01:38:47,750 --> 01:38:52,750
Well we w we started doing is Brian 
started that desk squad network of 

2302
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:55,430
podcasts just for that very reason when 
I was telling you about at the pool hall

2303
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:59,810
to try to expand,
to use the popularity of this podcast to

2304
01:38:59,811 --> 01:39:04,811
promote the pop to make that more 
popular and sort of launched all these 

2305
01:39:04,811 --> 01:39:07,820
little different guys off into their own
little podcast world.

2306
01:39:07,821 --> 01:39:08,800
Yeah.
And you know,

2307
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:13,840
because of podcasts,
a lot of our friends are like making a 

2308
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:13,840
living now that weren't making a living 
out.

2309
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,890
It's great.
And they've done it in red.

2310
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,940
Well they've done a true content 
marketing,

2311
01:39:18,941 --> 01:39:23,941
you know,
like their name or their last comic 

2312
01:39:23,941 --> 01:39:26,161
standing appearance.
But actually know you've listened hour 

2313
01:39:26,161 --> 01:39:26,500
after hour to me and now you're going to
be inclined to come back.

2314
01:39:26,710 --> 01:39:28,310
Yeah.
They'd love to come see it.

2315
01:39:28,311 --> 01:39:33,311
Like Joey Diaz,
apparently they did a gig up in upstate 

2316
01:39:33,311 --> 01:39:33,311
New York.
Joe,

2317
01:39:33,311 --> 01:39:34,350
he got a standing ovation from the 
entire fucking room.

2318
01:39:34,351 --> 01:39:35,640
They just went.
They freaked out.

2319
01:39:35,641 --> 01:39:38,090
As soon as I saw he's a star.
That's amazing.

2320
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:39,810
He should have been like that a long 
time ago.

2321
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:44,550
He needed something like a podcast to 
really let the audience see who the fuck

2322
01:39:44,551 --> 01:39:46,980
he really was.
The day that Whitney Houston died,

2323
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:52,040
I put a.
I said in honor of the death of the 

2324
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:56,060
Great Whitney Houston.
Here's a video of Joey Diaz talking 

2325
01:39:56,060 --> 01:39:58,011
about selling coke to her days day.
She died.

2326
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:01,260
She died.
I totally should have done it.

2327
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:04,140
I totally should have done it.
It was so rude.

2328
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:05,610
She.
You get a lot of shit about it.

2329
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:06,800
No,
no.

2330
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:08,640
Look,
if that was one that everybody saw,

2331
01:40:08,641 --> 01:40:09,940
comment.
I mean that was ridiculous.

2332
01:40:09,941 --> 01:40:14,941
I mean,
Whitney Houston had that TV show with 

2333
01:40:14,941 --> 01:40:14,941
Bobby Brown.
Do you remember?

2334
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:17,840
Crack is whack.
Yeah.

2335
01:40:17,930 --> 01:40:19,280
Oh my God.
They'd be screaming.

2336
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:22,510
It was chaos.
They'd be screaming at each.

2337
01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:24,290
Remember when she would.
They would be.

2338
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:26,510
I said,
they didn't say,

2339
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:33,170
how dare you?
How dare you?

2340
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,290
A baby screaming if that's offensive to 
some people.

2341
01:40:36,291 --> 01:40:37,850
You can't even say that.
They'd be screaming,

2342
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:40,620
you can't talk like that.
You can.

2343
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:41,930
I great.
Maybe talk lot.

2344
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:44,730
Yeah.
You're not allowed to.

2345
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:45,630
Not Allowed to say that.

2346
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:49,130
I find the more I say it,
the more I'm allowed to.

2347
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:53,560
It's all about saying a lot.
You have to like stay wet.

2348
01:40:53,561 --> 01:40:58,561
It's like,
you know when you get out of the pool 

2349
01:40:58,561 --> 01:40:58,561
and you dry off and then you don't want 
to go back in to stay wet.

2350
01:40:58,561 --> 01:40:58,580
Say attack

2351
01:40:58,730 --> 01:41:00,610
are slowly being diminished.
Yeah.

2352
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:05,750
You know,
someone talked about the Jeremy Lin 

2353
01:41:05,750 --> 01:41:08,491
incident where a reporter got in trouble
for saying a chicken in his either 

2354
01:41:08,491 --> 01:41:08,980
accidentally.
He wasn't saying it as a joke.

2355
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,620
It slipped out.
That is what you say.

2356
01:41:11,621 --> 01:41:16,621
It's not so we're supposed to run every 
fucking thing we say through the prism 

2357
01:41:16,621 --> 01:41:20,440
of political correctness and who I how.
How do you talk craziness will or unless

2358
01:41:20,441 --> 01:41:23,080
the guy was trying to be cute because 
then you have to say if the guy was just

2359
01:41:23,081 --> 01:41:23,830
trying to be cute.
Yeah.

2360
01:41:23,831 --> 01:41:26,530
That's kind of a douchey thing to do.
If the guy was just trying.

2361
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:28,180
I mean he,
he's never really gonna admit it.

2362
01:41:28,210 --> 01:41:29,020
He's not going to say,
look,

2363
01:41:29,021 --> 01:41:30,550
I was trying to be cute.
I got caught,

2364
01:41:30,990 --> 01:41:31,630
whatever.
I said,

2365
01:41:31,631 --> 01:41:32,190
Jake.
Yeah,

2366
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:34,180
yeah.
He's a Chinese guy,

2367
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:36,230
you know,
but um,

2368
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:41,700
people,
people were upset enough that that guy 

2369
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:41,700
like he got suspended.
Right.

2370
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:42,850
You hired,
I think the writer,

2371
01:41:42,851 --> 01:41:43,690
somebody wrote it

2372
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:48,990
and then he said it.
I think the broadcaster might've gotten 

2373
01:41:48,990 --> 01:41:51,541
suspended or I got his wrist slap.
But I think the guy who wrote it into 

2374
01:41:51,541 --> 01:41:51,541
the copy

2375
01:41:51,541 --> 01:41:51,541
godfather was fired.
Well,

2376
01:41:51,541 --> 01:41:53,050
he was probably trying to be cute if he 
wrote it,

2377
01:41:53,051 --> 01:41:54,550
actually wrote it down.
Come on.

2378
01:41:54,551 --> 01:41:59,551
When you write things,
you think about them way more than just 

2379
01:41:59,551 --> 01:41:59,551
saying it's hard to think he didn't 
catch that.

2380
01:41:59,551 --> 01:42:04,500
I said kamikaze this weekend in Japan 
during a fight and it was totally 

2381
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:06,400
accidental.
Guy was losing,

2382
01:42:06,401 --> 01:42:09,490
but it's okay.
It kamikaze is not like in Japan,

2383
01:42:09,491 --> 01:42:12,280
like St Kamikaze in Japan is not like 
calling someone a check.

2384
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:13,690
It's like that.
Those are like,

2385
01:42:13,740 --> 01:42:16,740
they're revered warriors.
They risk their lives like their,

2386
01:42:16,741 --> 01:42:21,741
their,
their brain stumped on extinguish them 

2387
01:42:21,741 --> 01:42:21,741
while they're pretty sure that rather I.
and they were correct,

2388
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:24,610
but there was a dude who was losing and 
I said,

2389
01:42:24,640 --> 01:42:26,160
look,
he's losing he,

2390
01:42:26,230 --> 01:42:31,230
the only way he's going to win this 
fight is if he goes just fucking 

2391
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:31,230
kamikaze.
Adam.

2392
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:35,880
No,
I didn't even think about it until 

2393
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:35,880
somebody wrote it online.
I can't believe Rogan said kamikaze.

2394
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:37,240
That's what I would say.
That's what I would always say.

2395
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:40,930
You gotta just go kill or be killed.
Go in there and dive bomb on them.

2396
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,000
No,
I write on a lot of black shows for some

2397
01:42:43,001 --> 01:42:45,250
reason I've written on like for black 
shows.

2398
01:42:45,310 --> 01:42:48,850
And I always say shit.
Well Wanda Sykes and uh,

2399
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:51,730
cedric the entertainer presents.
That was the first guy I ever got.

2400
01:42:51,731 --> 01:42:54,090
Louis brought me out of that.
And um,

2401
01:42:54,180 --> 01:42:57,160
and then I wrote on Jamie Foxx show this
past spring.

2402
01:42:57,490 --> 01:43:01,480
And so every time I come in it's like,
because I'm white and it's almost always

2403
01:43:01,481 --> 01:43:03,070
like all,
like the Jamie Foxx thing.

2404
01:43:03,071 --> 01:43:04,990
I was the only white guy and I was 
brought in.

2405
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:10,020
Things weren't going well.
And then they brought me in and you 

2406
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:10,020
think to try to

2407
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:14,840
help out what was the Jamie Foxx thing?
It was this guy named Don crocket had a 

2408
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:17,310
sketch show that Jamie Foxx was 
producing and um,

2409
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:21,270
you know,
it was a late night talk show and uh,

2410
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:25,470
everything I said was taken like,
oh,

2411
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:29,000
you gotta say whip like let's whipped us
into shape kind of thing.

2412
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:31,100
And it was always like,
oh,

2413
01:43:31,101 --> 01:43:36,101
there he goes again.
They were calling me Mr Magoo because I 

2414
01:43:36,101 --> 01:43:36,800
would just blindly walk into things.
It was funny,

2415
01:43:36,801 --> 01:43:39,860
like nobody was offended,
but it was like the running joke is that

2416
01:43:39,861 --> 01:43:42,380
it's so easy to just say the wrong 
fucking thing.

2417
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:43,430
No,
it was hilarious.

2418
01:43:43,431 --> 01:43:46,160
It was like classic ball busting and it.
Yeah.

2419
01:43:46,161 --> 01:43:46,910
So,
uh,

2420
01:43:47,210 --> 01:43:47,560
no,
it's,

2421
01:43:47,561 --> 01:43:49,940
it's hard man,
because I really do feel like every time

2422
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,830
you put a take it off the table,
you're taking the idea off the table.

2423
01:43:54,831 --> 01:43:56,180
What you're really doing is saying,
no,

2424
01:43:56,181 --> 01:43:57,920
we're not allowed to,
um,

2425
01:43:58,100 --> 01:43:59,810
explore,
discuss,

2426
01:43:59,811 --> 01:44:03,290
dissect,
and possibly deflate an idea.

2427
01:44:03,710 --> 01:44:07,030
We have to just pretend it's not there 
because we,

2428
01:44:07,070 --> 01:44:08,840
because it's just,
I don't know.

2429
01:44:08,930 --> 01:44:11,270
Um,
I don't know where political correctness

2430
01:44:11,271 --> 01:44:12,590
even comes from,
you know,

2431
01:44:12,770 --> 01:44:15,380
who came up with the idea that people go
to college where you're supposed to open

2432
01:44:15,381 --> 01:44:19,100
your mind and then tell a comedian that 
he can't tell a bunch of 20 year olds.

2433
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:20,300
You can't say,
fuck,

2434
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:22,550
I can't say fuck in front of a bunch of 
20 year olds.

2435
01:44:22,670 --> 01:44:27,670
All they do is fuck and drink and,
and I can't talk about drinking or 

2436
01:44:27,670 --> 01:44:28,400
fucking why am I here?
Why are you,

2437
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:31,070
why are you charging them 30 grand a 
year for what?

2438
01:44:31,071 --> 01:44:36,071
To protect them from ideas at college.
Do you know that like the board of 

2439
01:44:36,071 --> 01:44:40,481
governors of every major university is 
overwhelmingly a occupied by fortune 

2440
01:44:40,481 --> 01:44:41,350
500,
uh,

2441
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:43,130
board members.
Really?

2442
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:44,270
Yeah,
it is.

2443
01:44:44,350 --> 01:44:46,460
College is there to create middle 
managers.

2444
01:44:46,461 --> 01:44:49,580
It's there to double down anybody.
It's going to challenge the status quo.

2445
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:53,510
My Wife's dad is a bit of a ruined 
neighborhoods.

2446
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:59,210
All the Ivy League schools are the worst
fucking neighborhood.

2447
01:44:59,390 --> 01:45:04,390
Columbia or Harvard.
Yale gets shot and stabbed anywhere near

2448
01:45:04,431 --> 01:45:06,560
Harvard.
Berkeley,

2449
01:45:06,561 --> 01:45:08,210
I think at one point was a bad 
neighborhood.

2450
01:45:08,211 --> 01:45:09,950
I think it's good now.
Burglary as good.

2451
01:45:09,951 --> 01:45:10,640
No.
Yeah.

2452
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:12,080
Yeah.
But it's close to Oakland,

2453
01:45:12,170 --> 01:45:12,890
right?
Isn't it?

2454
01:45:14,150 --> 01:45:15,110
Yes.
Yeah,

2455
01:45:15,111 --> 01:45:16,850
it's Oakland and then Berkeley.
So,

2456
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:22,090
but the point is my,
my wife's dad who graduated number one 

2457
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:23,740
in his class from Yale,
got a,

2458
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:25,910
became a medical,
got a medical degree,

2459
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:31,660
ran for president on the Green Party in 
California in 2000 and got close to 

2460
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:32,300
Nader.
Brilliant fucking guy.

2461
01:45:32,301 --> 01:45:34,610
His textbooks are published all over the
world.

2462
01:45:34,990 --> 01:45:36,140
Uh,
he had the Algebra,

2463
01:45:36,141 --> 01:45:41,141
his chair in sociology at Bard College,
very progressive liberal Jewish school 

2464
01:45:41,901 --> 01:45:46,901
in New York.
And he wrote a book that was anti 

2465
01:45:46,901 --> 01:45:47,160
Zionist and his opinion,
uh,

2466
01:45:47,210 --> 01:45:50,480
Israel is a terrorist state that has a 
attacked,

2467
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:51,810
uh,
the Palestinians and,

2468
01:45:51,820 --> 01:45:56,820
and you know,
he lost his chair who was fired because 

2469
01:45:57,470 --> 01:46:01,940
the alumni didn't like his view.

2470
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:07,390
Wow.
What the fuck is a college supposed to 

2471
01:46:07,390 --> 01:46:08,060
be?
Discourse argument,

2472
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:11,360
but that's not what it is.
It's just preparing people for work.

2473
01:46:11,630 --> 01:46:16,630
Yes.
I mean it's sort of discourse and 

2474
01:46:16,630 --> 01:46:16,630
argument,
but it's also preparing you for work,

2475
01:46:16,630 --> 01:46:17,420
for what work.
I mean,

2476
01:46:17,421 --> 01:46:18,980
if you look at the future of this 
country,

2477
01:46:18,981 --> 01:46:23,981
where is the work coming from?
It ain't coming from the fucking auto 

2478
01:46:23,981 --> 01:46:23,981
factories.
It ain't coming from the farms.

2479
01:46:23,981 --> 01:46:28,750
We don't know where it's coming from.
It's going to come from mines that have 

2480
01:46:28,750 --> 01:46:31,751
gone into the depths of challenged ideas
and come out of it with the tools to 

2481
01:46:32,930 --> 01:46:35,690
take the status quo and change it and 
create and develop.

2482
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:40,780
I couldn't imagine even existing and 
going to school in the age of the 

2483
01:46:40,881 --> 01:46:43,730
Internet.
It must be so fucking different.

2484
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:48,760
I know it must be so different because 
you can't stop anybody from googling 

2485
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:50,100
anything at anytime.
The teacher

2486
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,720
can't be full of Shit,
you know,

2487
01:46:51,721 --> 01:46:56,721
everyone has to.
Everything has to be checked and the 

2488
01:46:56,721 --> 01:46:56,721
information that's passing so quickly.

2489
01:46:57,140 --> 01:46:57,450
No,
I,

2490
01:46:57,460 --> 01:46:59,090
I,
you can go to classes.

2491
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:01,160
I forgot I'm talking to somebody in 
college and they were gonna.

2492
01:47:01,190 --> 01:47:06,190
They were gonna sit down and open up 
their laptop to watch the class that 

2493
01:47:06,190 --> 01:47:09,401
they'd missed because they videotaped 
the lectures and you can just download 

2494
01:47:09,401 --> 01:47:09,401
them.
So you're,

2495
01:47:09,401 --> 01:47:09,740
you know,
you got an 8:00

2496
01:47:09,741 --> 01:47:12,500
class in January and Boston,
you're going to get out of bed.

2497
01:47:12,620 --> 01:47:17,620
Fuck,
now you wait two hours and you watch it 

2498
01:47:17,620 --> 01:47:20,051
on your computer,
so why are you in Boston paying for a 

2499
01:47:20,051 --> 01:47:20,510
dorm room and all this shit.
Just go to a.

2500
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:22,940
what's the,
what's the online university?

2501
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:28,570
What is the Phoenix,
Phoenix University of Phoenix or 

2502
01:47:28,570 --> 01:47:28,570
wherever

2503
01:47:28,570 --> 01:47:30,940
mit offers the offer.
A lot of their lectures available online

2504
01:47:30,941 --> 01:47:35,941
as well.
Like there's a lot of like you can 

2505
01:47:35,941 --> 01:47:35,941
literally get.
I mean,

2506
01:47:35,941 --> 01:47:36,750
there was like the education joke in 
the,

2507
01:47:36,751 --> 01:47:41,070
uh,
was the movie with Damon Matt Damon in a

2508
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:46,560
strip tease the fucking Boston boys.
Matt Damon showed me the Appalachian 

2509
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:51,150
identity goes.
That's about Cinderella one.

2510
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:53,650
Who's the one who married a Jennifer 
Lopez?

2511
01:47:53,730 --> 01:47:55,910
AFLAC.
Ben.

2512
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:57,100
What?
Goodwill hunting.

2513
01:47:57,130 --> 01:48:02,130
Good will go and help them.
Remember he was talking about his 

2514
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:02,130
Harvard education and he was just joking
about.

2515
01:48:02,130 --> 01:48:03,160
Yeah,
you get that with a library card.

2516
01:48:03,330 --> 01:48:04,120
Yeah,
no,

2517
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:10,220
that,
it's kind of like in Boston he talked 

2518
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:11,991
about like going to harvard versus 
another school and it's how much better 

2519
01:48:11,991 --> 01:48:11,991
it is.
It's like,

2520
01:48:11,991 --> 01:48:13,110
what do they have professors at other 
schools that go,

2521
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:15,150
sorry,
I can't teach you that.

2522
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:19,370
You got to go to Harvard to learn that.
I mean,

2523
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:21,300
I'm sure it's just more competitive,
right?

2524
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:22,370
Well,
I think it's.

2525
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,060
You know what it is.
It's about,

2526
01:48:24,061 --> 01:48:29,061
it's about networking.
You're going to go to school with kids 

2527
01:48:29,061 --> 01:48:30,030
whose dads went to Harvard and I could 
afford to pay this and who had the juice

2528
01:48:30,031 --> 01:48:35,031
to get you in and you're going to those 
are there going to be your cohorts as 

2529
01:48:35,031 --> 01:48:35,031
you grow older,
you want to call in a favor.

2530
01:48:35,031 --> 01:48:39,950
You want to call a friend from fucking a
University of Phoenix or from Harvard 

2531
01:48:39,950 --> 01:48:40,620
who's going to,
who's going to help you out more

2532
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:41,340
and it's.
Yeah,

2533
01:48:41,341 --> 01:48:44,130
and they're most likely all going to be 
successful as well as they get older.

2534
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:47,790
And what's really interesting is those 
guys that get into like secret societies

2535
01:48:47,791 --> 01:48:50,250
when they're in college,
skull and crossbones,

2536
01:48:50,730 --> 01:48:53,220
that's real.
That's fucking real.

2537
01:48:53,221 --> 01:48:57,030
Those Ivy League schools,
like really high end schools,

2538
01:48:57,040 --> 01:49:02,040
the Illuminati all send their kids to.
They really do joined secret societies 

2539
01:49:02,130 --> 01:49:07,130
like the skull and bones.
They look really do like weird gay shit 

2540
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:08,510
to each other and the blokes and robes

2541
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:12,190
can hit each other and they do a lot 
more out on the surface.

2542
01:49:12,191 --> 01:49:14,000
They're called dinner clubs at Harvard 
and you,

2543
01:49:14,001 --> 01:49:16,960
you try to get into a dinner club and 
it's just,

2544
01:49:17,020 --> 01:49:19,990
it's a,
it's a more transparent version of skull

2545
01:49:19,991 --> 01:49:21,310
and bones,
but it's the same thing.

2546
01:49:21,490 --> 01:49:24,550
These are my boys.
We're gonna Watch each other's backs,

2547
01:49:24,580 --> 01:49:26,680
you know,
in college beyond college.

2548
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:31,760
And,
and the criteria for getting in are 

2549
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:33,631
fucking creepy.
They happen at this one happens to be 

2550
01:49:33,631 --> 01:49:33,631
all Jewish.
This one is all German Jewish.

2551
01:49:33,631 --> 01:49:34,690
This one is all,
you know,

2552
01:49:34,691 --> 01:49:39,691
uh,
people whose grandparents came over on 

2553
01:49:39,691 --> 01:49:42,331
the mayflower.
It's all like these specific fucking 

2554
01:49:42,331 --> 01:49:45,300
clicks.
And it's the same thing I was thinking 

2555
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:45,300
like origin based click.
Not always.

2556
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:47,470
I think there's different ways they 
distinguish themselves and I'm sure some

2557
01:49:47,471 --> 01:49:49,090
of them are based on like,
you know,

2558
01:49:49,091 --> 01:49:54,091
this is somebody who works,
has done a lot of community service 

2559
01:49:54,091 --> 01:49:54,091
work.

2560
01:49:54,091 --> 01:49:54,670
So let's have a dinner club,
but a lot of them are based on,

2561
01:49:54,810 --> 01:49:55,930
you know,
your blue blood.

2562
01:49:55,931 --> 01:49:56,320
You know,
what,

2563
01:49:56,321 --> 01:49:59,620
what your DNA is and who your who your 
parents were.

2564
01:49:59,810 --> 01:50:01,930
And that's the thing also.
But then on the other hand,

2565
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:05,710
like I remember at Boston University 
there was like the French house.

2566
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:08,320
It was the gay house,
there was the,

2567
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:09,790
you know,
black house.

2568
01:50:09,791 --> 01:50:14,791
It's like,
I thought the idea was that we're all 

2569
01:50:14,791 --> 01:50:14,791
going to get together and mix it up and 
get to know each other.

2570
01:50:14,791 --> 01:50:17,200
Why are we fucking secluding this is 
segregation.

2571
01:50:17,201 --> 01:50:18,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

2572
01:50:18,370 --> 01:50:20,170
Certainly is.
I'm against college.

2573
01:50:20,171 --> 01:50:21,910
I really am.
I really feel like my kids,

2574
01:50:21,911 --> 01:50:26,911
I've got a college savings account.
They got about two years paid for each 

2575
01:50:26,911 --> 01:50:30,481
at this point and uh,
I don't think I'm putting any more into 

2576
01:50:30,481 --> 01:50:30,481
it.
And when they turn 17,

2577
01:50:30,481 --> 01:50:30,481
I'm going to go.

2578
01:50:30,481 --> 01:50:35,310
You get two choices.
You can fucking waste your brain for 

2579
01:50:35,310 --> 01:50:37,000
junior college or take this money,
joined the circus,

2580
01:50:37,130 --> 01:50:39,370
go to Europe backpack.
I don't give a fuck.

2581
01:50:39,371 --> 01:50:41,920
But you're gonna you're gonna work,
you know,

2582
01:50:41,921 --> 01:50:46,921
you're gonna explore challenge Louis Ck 
is mom saved up all this money to send 

2583
01:50:46,921 --> 01:50:48,460
them to college.
And then when he had a chance,

2584
01:50:48,670 --> 01:50:51,190
he went to Nyu film school,
got in,

2585
01:50:51,340 --> 01:50:52,660
looked around and said,
well,

2586
01:50:52,661 --> 01:50:55,960
I've got an idea for a short film.
Can I take this money and make the film?

2587
01:50:55,961 --> 01:50:58,030
I think I can learn more than I can at 
the school.

2588
01:50:58,450 --> 01:51:00,790
And she thought about it and she gave 
him the money.

2589
01:51:01,090 --> 01:51:03,340
He made a short film,
got into Sundance.

2590
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:06,250
He ended up as the head writer of the 
Conan O'brien show.

2591
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:08,020
And then Chris Rock,
I mean it was like,

2592
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:13,320
you know,
there's other ways to make it in the 

2593
01:51:13,320 --> 01:51:15,331
world if you really know what you want 
besides going to college and being 

2594
01:51:15,331 --> 01:51:15,700
fucking coddled for years.

2595
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:18,550
Yeah.
Well I always felt like just learning,

2596
01:51:18,580 --> 01:51:21,460
like sticking to their lessons.
Like if you,

2597
01:51:21,461 --> 01:51:26,461
if you,
you have to have some sort of a base of 

2598
01:51:26,461 --> 01:51:28,981
education.
You have to be able to express yourself 

2599
01:51:28,981 --> 01:51:31,921
in the world.
You have to be able to understand 

2600
01:51:31,921 --> 01:51:31,921
things.
But once you get to a certain point when

2601
01:51:31,921 --> 01:51:35,200
you're 17 or 18 years old or you have an
idea of something you want to do,

2602
01:51:35,370 --> 01:51:37,330
you know,
if you want to be a gymnast,

2603
01:51:37,331 --> 01:51:39,910
you want to be a professional gymnast or
a fucking bike racer,

2604
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:41,770
it's not going to help you to learn 
Roman history.

2605
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:42,620
Yeah.
It's really not.

2606
01:51:42,630 --> 01:51:45,640
You know when it's in fact going to do,
it's going to take up a lot of time.

2607
01:51:45,870 --> 01:51:50,870
It's going to take away.
Some of your folks are doing your other 

2608
01:51:50,870 --> 01:51:50,870
shit primetime of your youth.
Oh,

2609
01:51:50,870 --> 01:51:52,360
you're going to learn.
You're going to be in a band,

2610
01:51:52,361 --> 01:51:54,550
but in the meantime you're going to 
learn calculus.

2611
01:51:54,730 --> 01:51:55,390
No,
you're not.

2612
01:51:55,540 --> 01:51:57,940
You know what you're gonna do.
You're gonna have a shitty guitar skill.

2613
01:51:58,060 --> 01:51:59,170
You're not.
You're not going to be as good.

2614
01:51:59,230 --> 01:51:59,980
Yep.
You're just not.

2615
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:01,930
You're not going to be.
You're not going to get in.

2616
01:52:02,020 --> 01:52:02,890
You're gonna.
You're gonna.

2617
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:05,140
Be on the outside because you have asked
it.

2618
01:52:05,190 --> 01:52:07,110
Yeah.
Now I think you got to go out.

2619
01:52:07,111 --> 01:52:08,640
Like I took a year off after high 
school.

2620
01:52:08,641 --> 01:52:10,710
I never thought I'd go to college and I 
traveled around.

2621
01:52:10,711 --> 01:52:15,711
I save three grand.
I went to Europe for six months with a 

2622
01:52:15,711 --> 01:52:15,711
backpack and I came back on like,
wow,

2623
01:52:15,711 --> 01:52:20,570
I want to go to college.
There's a lot of Shit I want to learn 

2624
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:22,581
and I'm not ready to be out there.
Like I knew I wanted to be a writer and 

2625
01:52:22,581 --> 01:52:23,790
I want it to go.
I wanted to study great works.

2626
01:52:23,791 --> 01:52:26,280
I wanted to learn how to write and I and
I did.

2627
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,230
And and I.
It was a great experience for me.

2628
01:52:28,410 --> 01:52:31,050
I wouldn't have known it if I'd gone 
straight in from high school.

2629
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:35,170
And I also think that like a boss sees 
should be offered earlier in high school

2630
01:52:35,171 --> 01:52:37,620
when you're a sophomore,
you may know that you want to be.

2631
01:52:37,870 --> 01:52:39,450
But Oh,
in New York they call it both sees.

2632
01:52:39,451 --> 01:52:43,380
It's like a vocational school.
Like if you know you don't want to learn

2633
01:52:43,381 --> 01:52:48,381
calculus and you're a sophomore,
you can start going to cooking classes 

2634
01:52:48,381 --> 01:52:51,970
are small engine repair and by the time 
you graduated high school you're 

2635
01:52:51,970 --> 01:52:53,020
qualified to be a chef or a,
you know,

2636
01:52:53,021 --> 01:52:55,220
a lead mechanic and eventually own a 
shop.

2637
01:52:55,260 --> 01:53:00,260
Yeah.
But a lot of people don't want their 

2638
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:01,731
kids to be boxed in like that because 
then if the kid grows up and then 

2639
01:53:01,731 --> 01:53:01,731
eventually wants to actually go to 
college,

2640
01:53:01,731 --> 01:53:04,710
well now he doesn't even have the base 
for it and he can't even compete.

2641
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:06,990
No.
You still get your core classes done.

2642
01:53:07,070 --> 01:53:08,550
Okay.
But instead of learning,

2643
01:53:08,551 --> 01:53:11,490
say a second language,
which you have to do in high school,

2644
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:16,880
you sub out those for these folks.
You go away like three days a week for 

2645
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:17,650
half a day to a vocational place.
Learn.

2646
01:53:17,690 --> 01:53:22,690
Remember the name.
Now that you're saying that now I 

2647
01:53:22,690 --> 01:53:22,690
remember.
It sounds like a slander,

2648
01:53:22,690 --> 01:53:22,770
but it's actually the name of the 
program.

2649
01:53:22,771 --> 01:53:22,890
Yeah.

2650
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,760
Forgot about that.
Wow.

2651
01:53:25,570 --> 01:53:27,140
Yeah.
Well who the fuck knows what they.

2652
01:53:27,160 --> 01:53:32,160
I mean,
I didn't figure out what I wanted until 

2653
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:32,160
I was 21.
What I wanted to do,

2654
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:36,350
you know,
I really didn't know until I started 

2655
01:53:36,350 --> 01:53:36,350
doing standup.
Did you go to college?

2656
01:53:36,350 --> 01:53:36,490
I went to Umass Boston.
Oh,

2657
01:53:36,491 --> 01:53:37,320
you did?
Yeah.

2658
01:53:38,200 --> 01:53:43,200
Oh No.
I only went for three years and I only 

2659
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:43,200
went because I didn't want people 
thinking I was a loser.

2660
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:47,280
Yeah.
So the only reason why I wanted it was 

2661
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:47,280
barely paid attention,

2662
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:49,410
a lot of money to not pay attention.

2663
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:51,150
And it was weird.
We know I was um,

2664
01:53:51,330 --> 01:53:52,440
you know,
uh,

2665
01:53:52,540 --> 01:53:54,480
I would be taking classes and,
you know,

2666
01:53:54,481 --> 01:53:55,100
I would,
uh,

2667
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:58,020
like one of them was a weird sociology 
class.

2668
01:53:58,410 --> 01:54:03,410
This fucking guy.
I'll never forget this guy because he 

2669
01:54:03,410 --> 01:54:03,410
was from Haiti.
And uh,

2670
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:08,480
no matter what we talked about,
no matter what we talked about when you 

2671
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:08,480
talked about the,
the,

2672
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:09,870
the philosophical works with Leonardo 
Davinci,

2673
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,040
whether it was,
uh,

2674
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:11,750
you know,
uh,

2675
01:54:11,850 --> 01:54:12,600
anything in was

2676
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:18,420
skinhead.
What we would do is we would say this 

2677
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:19,340
and he would always,
no matter what the fuck we talked.

2678
01:54:19,341 --> 01:54:20,920
And so that would became,
like,

2679
01:54:20,921 --> 01:54:24,430
all I could concentrate on was how many 
different things this motherfucker could

2680
01:54:24,431 --> 01:54:29,431
connect to Haiti because he always 
wanted to hear himself talk because I 

2681
01:54:29,431 --> 01:54:29,431
think he was learning English.
Yeah.

2682
01:54:29,431 --> 01:54:32,060
You know.
So while back in Haiti,

2683
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:34,990
that's all he would say.
And you just want to go,

2684
01:54:34,991 --> 01:54:37,570
dude,
you're not in Haiti for a reason.

2685
01:54:37,571 --> 01:54:39,550
Why are you trying to draw from that?
Well,

2686
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:40,510
this is the new.
Well,

2687
01:54:40,511 --> 01:54:44,230
he would wear a tie and suit and tie.
And in college it's crazy.

2688
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:45,460
Yeah.
That's fascinating.

2689
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:46,930
You know,
wanting to argue about everything.

2690
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:48,790
Yeah.
Well the fucking Haitians man,

2691
01:54:48,791 --> 01:54:53,791
they like to argue.
That's why I talked to my cab drivers 

2692
01:54:53,791 --> 01:54:53,791
are either Haitian.
I talked to this guy,

2693
01:54:53,791 --> 01:54:57,901
he was a Iranian cab driver the other 
day and he's taking me back from the 

2694
01:54:57,901 --> 01:54:58,780
airport and we start talking about this 
and that.

2695
01:54:58,780 --> 01:54:59,890
I was,
I was talking to him about,

2696
01:54:59,950 --> 01:55:00,960
uh,
you know,

2697
01:55:00,970 --> 01:55:02,530
whether or not he thinks that I had 
typed,

2698
01:55:02,531 --> 01:55:04,480
we're going to bomb Iran.
I go right into it with them,

2699
01:55:04,481 --> 01:55:05,650
like,
do you think we're going to bomb Iran?

2700
01:55:06,330 --> 01:55:07,540
We get into religion.
And he goes,

2701
01:55:07,541 --> 01:55:08,830
you know,
I don't know,

2702
01:55:09,110 --> 01:55:11,470
I couldn't be there because they wanted 
you to.

2703
01:55:11,471 --> 01:55:16,471
He was a Muslim that they wanted you to 
believe this and they couldn't accept 

2704
01:55:16,471 --> 01:55:17,200
it.
I could just believe that it was exactly

2705
01:55:17,201 --> 01:55:19,270
the conversation we had earlier about 
atheism.

2706
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:21,160
He goes,
I know there's a god.

2707
01:55:21,190 --> 01:55:26,190
I know there's a power.
I don't think that man has the capacity 

2708
01:55:26,190 --> 01:55:27,670
to assign meaning to it or to understand
it.

2709
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,630
And I would sit in the back on,
here's an immigrant from Iran who drives

2710
01:55:31,631 --> 01:55:36,631
a cab.
I grew up upper middle class in New 

2711
01:55:36,631 --> 01:55:36,631
York,
college educated.

2712
01:55:36,631 --> 01:55:40,450
I'm a comedian and I feel exactly the 
same way spiritually as this guy does.

2713
01:55:41,050 --> 01:55:43,680
And that's,
that's fucking amazing to me.

2714
01:55:43,710 --> 01:55:44,730
You know,
that it all,

2715
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:46,530
when it doesn't matter what culture 
you're from,

2716
01:55:46,531 --> 01:55:47,940
it transcends that.
It really,

2717
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:49,890
I think if somebody,
like you were saying,

2718
01:55:49,891 --> 01:55:52,950
if you really examine yourself when 
you're truthful about your,

2719
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:53,990
you know,
uh,

2720
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:56,820
what your reality is,
it comes out there.

2721
01:55:56,821 --> 01:56:01,821
There is one human experience I think.
And College to me is supposed to be a 

2722
01:56:01,821 --> 01:56:04,140
place where they pull that shit out 
where they say,

2723
01:56:04,141 --> 01:56:09,141
look,
here's four years we can give you a 

2724
01:56:09,141 --> 01:56:09,141
place to live,
place to eat now,

2725
01:56:09,141 --> 01:56:10,380
just fucking go to town on your brain.
You know,

2726
01:56:10,610 --> 01:56:11,190
someone needs to

2727
01:56:11,240 --> 01:56:16,240
develop a much more unconventional 
method of teaching people where they 

2728
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:20,070
truly can go towards things only that 
they're interested in and know you've 

2729
01:56:20,070 --> 01:56:20,260
got all your mathematics and everything 
already.

2730
01:56:20,270 --> 01:56:20,810
Let's,
let's.

2731
01:56:20,811 --> 01:56:21,940
This is instead of,
you know,

2732
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:23,330
learning about history,
learning what,

2733
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:26,320
what the fuck do you want to learn about
what he will.

2734
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:27,680
Let me tell you something.
This is will die,

2735
01:56:27,770 --> 01:56:29,870
will qualify you for.
Get really good at that.

2736
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:31,940
What are you interested in?
You're interested in this.

2737
01:56:31,941 --> 01:56:33,500
Okay,
well let's take you down that road.

2738
01:56:34,220 --> 01:56:35,930
But so many people don't even get that 
opportunity.

2739
01:56:35,931 --> 01:56:38,270
You just,
you're forced to fit into a whole,

2740
01:56:38,510 --> 01:56:40,340
whether it's a round hole or a square 
hole,

2741
01:56:40,341 --> 01:56:43,280
whatever it is,
forced to conform to become whatever,

2742
01:56:43,310 --> 01:56:44,960
whatever the fuck that hole is.
And then,

2743
01:56:44,961 --> 01:56:46,700
you know,
when you have people that were like,

2744
01:56:46,701 --> 01:56:48,050
that girl Jennifer,
that I was dating,

2745
01:56:48,140 --> 01:56:50,900
had a restaurant hotel management that 
was her major.

2746
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:56,350
And that poor fucking girl,
she went from right out of college to 

2747
01:56:56,350 --> 01:56:57,590
working 16 hours a day,
every fucking day.

2748
01:56:57,830 --> 01:57:00,800
She was always exhausted.
She was always broken down.

2749
01:57:00,801 --> 01:57:02,210
And that's what she had to look forward 
to.

2750
01:57:02,350 --> 01:57:03,950
All the people in the restaurant,
hotel,

2751
01:57:03,951 --> 01:57:08,951
bar management world,
those fucking people would work for a 

2752
01:57:08,951 --> 01:57:09,020
salary.
One salary,

2753
01:57:09,021 --> 01:57:11,330
no one got paid overtime and your work 
was never done.

2754
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:15,340
And you spent four years not doing that.
So you're behind the people that started

2755
01:57:15,341 --> 01:57:17,980
doing the same shit.
You know what?

2756
01:57:17,981 --> 01:57:20,980
It's also about technology and uh,
you know,

2757
01:57:21,050 --> 01:57:23,500
digital media,
every information and,

2758
01:57:23,501 --> 01:57:26,890
and the progress of every industry 
changes so fast.

2759
01:57:27,190 --> 01:57:31,000
If you're going to college,
you're learning your industry from a guy

2760
01:57:31,030 --> 01:57:35,170
who learned it before you started your 
learning yesterday's industry.

2761
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:40,500
And then you're going to try to go into 
computers or you're going to try to go 

2762
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:40,500
into,
you know,

2763
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:40,500
uh,
even acting,

2764
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:45,481
there's different styles of acting.
You go in and get these old acting 

2765
01:57:45,481 --> 01:57:46,000
teachers that learned from status laskin
you're teaching,

2766
01:57:46,001 --> 01:57:48,100
you know,
repeat an answer and repeat.

2767
01:57:48,280 --> 01:57:53,280
I fucking suck it audition.
I spent two years at the neighborhood 

2768
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,850
playhouse in New York and I fucking suck
at auditioning.

2769
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:56,140
I,
I'm a good actor,

2770
01:57:56,170 --> 01:58:01,170
but I don't get the chance because I 
fucking suck my own dick when I go into 

2771
01:58:01,170 --> 01:58:04,381
a casting room.
Nobody taught me how to do that because 

2772
01:58:04,381 --> 01:58:07,951
they were.
They wanted to teach you Russian 

2773
01:58:07,951 --> 01:58:07,951
theater.
Right.

2774
01:58:07,951 --> 01:58:10,800
And it's the same with every industry.
You're learning the fucking dinosaur 

2775
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:10,800
method of things.

2776
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:14,800
Yeah.
That used to be the way it was with 

2777
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:15,170
martial arts to the ultimate fighting 
championship sort of came around.

2778
01:58:15,171 --> 01:58:17,180
Everybody was learning this old style 
of,

2779
01:58:17,181 --> 01:58:19,210
of,
of doing things where it had been.

2780
01:58:19,250 --> 01:58:21,650
It already evolved past that should've 
been.

2781
01:58:21,980 --> 01:58:23,750
Should've been in a completely different
stratosphere,

2782
01:58:23,751 --> 01:58:28,751
but everybody was holding onto the 
traditional methods and no one was 

2783
01:58:28,751 --> 01:58:28,751
exchanging information.

2784
01:58:28,751 --> 01:58:29,740
Yeah.
Who was the first person?

2785
01:58:29,770 --> 01:58:34,390
Who would you say is the first pioneer 
in that kind of crossover?

2786
01:58:34,750 --> 01:58:36,000
Mixed signals.
Significant

2787
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,150
guys hoists gracie because he was the 
guy that won the first ultimate fighting

2788
01:58:39,151 --> 01:58:44,151
championship and he won it in a way that
proved that a smaller man with more 

2789
01:58:44,151 --> 01:58:46,990
skill could defeat a bigger man because 
that was always the goal of martial arts

2790
01:58:46,991 --> 01:58:50,110
was like the Bruce Lee thing where this 
little guy could fuck up everybody,

2791
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:56,040
but the reality is in striking,
that really doesn't work because little 

2792
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:56,440
people can't hit us hard.
They just can't.

2793
01:58:56,460 --> 01:59:01,460
You know what I mean?
The little guy who can kick kick you in 

2794
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:01,460
the face.
Yeah,

2795
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:02,890
it can hurt you,
but the reality is most fights end up on

2796
01:59:02,891 --> 01:59:07,891
the ground and the little guy might 
throw a kick and slip because the 

2797
01:59:07,891 --> 01:59:11,041
fucking beer bottle fell on the floor 
and there's water everywhere and you 

2798
01:59:11,041 --> 01:59:12,910
don't have the footing to throw.
Fucking wild head kicks in the middle of

2799
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:17,910
a bar.
But when push comes to shove and tangle 

2800
01:59:17,910 --> 01:59:20,160
and you go to the ground,
then you have to understand how to 

2801
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:21,661
grapple and what the Jujitsu that hoists
gracie had when he fought in the UFC was

2802
01:59:22,781 --> 01:59:26,170
Brazilian Jujitsu and no one here knew 
what the fuck that was.

2803
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:27,850
Dudes had no idea what that guy was.

2804
01:59:27,890 --> 01:59:30,200
But UFC at that point was.
That was.

2805
01:59:30,230 --> 01:59:32,960
That was chain link fences and it lives 
in another country,

2806
01:59:32,961 --> 01:59:33,440
right?
Well,

2807
01:59:33,441 --> 01:59:34,340
no,
it was denver,

2808
01:59:34,341 --> 01:59:35,680
Colorado was the first one.
Okay.

2809
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:38,210
You know,
it was put together by Horian Gracie who

2810
01:59:38,230 --> 01:59:41,230
is his older brother who was a lawyer,
a very smart guy.

2811
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:42,230
What year is this?
About?

2812
01:59:42,260 --> 01:59:43,820
Nineteen 93.
Yeah.

2813
01:59:43,930 --> 01:59:47,080
And that changed everything because my 
whole life I had been a striker,

2814
01:59:47,081 --> 01:59:52,081
I'd done kickboxing and taekwondo.
It was all striking and this was the 

2815
01:59:52,081 --> 01:59:53,890
first time that I had seen like what 
could happen with submissions.

2816
01:59:54,180 --> 01:59:59,180
I've wrestled in high school,
but I never really pursued it at much 

2817
01:59:59,180 --> 02:00:01,951
after the one year in high school.
I never learned any choke hold or 

2818
02:00:01,951 --> 02:00:03,700
anything like that and learn it and 
seeing this guy just dismantle people on

2819
02:00:03,701 --> 02:00:04,420
the ground.
You'd be like,

2820
02:00:04,421 --> 02:00:06,520
Holy Shit.
Like what would I do?

2821
02:00:06,730 --> 02:00:08,980
All these other guys,
these big strong guys getting strangled.

2822
02:00:09,080 --> 02:00:10,480
What'd I do?
He strangled me to,

2823
02:00:10,510 --> 02:00:12,670
you know,
it was inescapable conclusion.

2824
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:13,480
I saw it.
I was like,

2825
02:00:13,481 --> 02:00:18,481
the inescapable conclusion is if you 
didn't know what this guy knew and you 

2826
02:00:18,481 --> 02:00:19,390
got let him get ahold of you,
you're fucked.

2827
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:20,340
So.
But.

2828
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:22,780
So he changed it the most.
So he changed it the most.

2829
02:00:22,781 --> 02:00:24,850
But in terms of like what we're talking 
about,

2830
02:00:24,851 --> 02:00:28,330
which is that when you try to,
when you try to do things differently,

2831
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:30,440
people will try to stop,
you know,

2832
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:35,790
UFC still.
It's still trying to fight off the 

2833
02:00:35,790 --> 02:00:38,530
stigma that it's this vicious back 
alley,

2834
02:00:38,531 --> 02:00:40,090
you know?
Not too brutal,

2835
02:00:40,091 --> 02:00:43,060
but it wasn't this year,
kind of a big test for UFC.

2836
02:00:43,061 --> 02:00:45,070
Going to that next level and going on 
network.

2837
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:46,810
Yeah,
because it came on Fox.

2838
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:50,740
It is completely up the profile and 
visit a success.

2839
02:00:50,741 --> 02:00:51,490
Did it succeed?

2840
02:00:51,570 --> 02:00:53,940
Yes,
and Fox is really enthusiastic about it.

2841
02:00:53,941 --> 02:00:58,941
They have a big longterm deal and 
they've seen the UFC develop over the 

2842
02:00:58,941 --> 02:01:00,930
years and it took a long time before 
they got interested in,

2843
02:01:00,931 --> 02:01:05,931
but they got interested in it at the 
perfect time because the product is so 

2844
02:01:05,931 --> 02:01:06,000
developed.
The brand so developed.

2845
02:01:06,001 --> 02:01:09,660
The fighters are so high level now.
I mean the referees are great.

2846
02:01:09,661 --> 02:01:12,120
Everybody's safety's at the all time 
high.

2847
02:01:12,121 --> 02:01:12,450
As far as

2848
02:01:12,750 --> 02:01:15,160
broadcasting is state of the art.
It's easiest.

2849
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:16,080
Fuck.
It's the.

2850
02:01:16,081 --> 02:01:21,081
That's the easiest.
Easy because you love it and you know 

2851
02:01:21,081 --> 02:01:21,081
it.
It's very easy.

2852
02:01:21,081 --> 02:01:21,081
Yeah.
It's a,

2853
02:01:21,081 --> 02:01:21,330
it's a.
it's a fun,

2854
02:01:21,331 --> 02:01:24,840
exciting thing to do,
but it's like for me it's natural.

2855
02:01:24,841 --> 02:01:29,841
It's convinced.
Some guys don't seem like I watch Jim 

2856
02:01:29,841 --> 02:01:29,841
Rome.
I know a lot of people love them.

2857
02:01:29,841 --> 02:01:31,410
I feel like he's working.
I don't feel like the guys enjoying what

2858
02:01:31,411 --> 02:01:32,850
you do that like it's him.
Yeah.

2859
02:01:33,150 --> 02:01:33,990
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

2860
02:01:34,290 --> 02:01:35,780
Yeah.
Want a lot of people that don't.

2861
02:01:35,830 --> 02:01:37,920
In that world of sport.
That's a bullshit world.

2862
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:40,110
The sports world is full of Shit.
Too many guys in,

2863
02:01:40,111 --> 02:01:45,111
in fucking Italian suits talking about 
something that get basically the same 

2864
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:48,500
type of talking.
What we're dealing with here,

2865
02:01:48,530 --> 02:01:50,450
you know,
they have this artificial strip club.

2866
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:52,190
Joel,
what do you think next week,

2867
02:01:52,191 --> 02:01:55,190
Minnesota against another team.

2868
02:01:55,190 --> 02:02:00,190
Which one do you think will win by y and
how many points and why?

2869
02:02:01,040 --> 02:02:03,260
And Utah.
Oh my God.

2870
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:08,740
If fucking drink and it's always these x
jocks that are wearing suits and they 

2871
02:02:08,740 --> 02:02:09,980
look surprised there in a suit.
Oh my God,

2872
02:02:09,981 --> 02:02:12,070
I'm going to sue.
I'm going to look at me.

2873
02:02:12,250 --> 02:02:14,510
How many yellow suit?
Let's go to the uh,

2874
02:02:14,690 --> 02:02:19,690
let's go to the Latino Mulatto chicken.
The field who knows nothing about 

2875
02:02:19,690 --> 02:02:19,730
sports.
It's hot as fuck.

2876
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:21,500
Always.
They have done on showtime.

2877
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:26,501
When they do strikeforce,
they have hot girls at interview the 

2878
02:02:26,501 --> 02:02:26,501
fighters and they put together,
you know,

2879
02:02:26,501 --> 02:02:26,501
they,
they do a good job.

2880
02:02:26,501 --> 02:02:29,090
They put together some questions and 
they feed them to her and then she,

2881
02:02:29,410 --> 02:02:30,830
you know,
she knows a little bit about the sports.

2882
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:32,420
You could banter a little bit if she has
to,

2883
02:02:32,421 --> 02:02:34,130
but the most important thing,
she's hot.

2884
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:35,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

2885
02:02:35,171 --> 02:02:35,570
Look,
yeah,

2886
02:02:35,571 --> 02:02:36,340
look,
he did this.

2887
02:02:38,870 --> 02:02:40,670
Mix it up a little.
Yeah,

2888
02:02:40,720 --> 02:02:45,720
a sweaty guy with a hot check.
I got lucky with the UFC and that I got 

2889
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:48,830
in before it was ever a big market.
That's the second big wave you've caught

2890
02:02:48,831 --> 02:02:49,910
in your life.
I'm lucky as fuck.

2891
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,710
Yeah.
Always been lucky but not lucky.

2892
02:02:51,711 --> 02:02:56,711
I mean,
I was going to say this to you before 

2893
02:02:56,711 --> 02:02:56,711
and we were playing pool when young 
comics ask for advice,

2894
02:02:56,711 --> 02:02:58,550
I just want to say to them,
live a life,

2895
02:02:58,670 --> 02:02:59,960
do something,
you know,

2896
02:03:00,050 --> 02:03:03,230
don't just fucking write notes and go on
stage and then,

2897
02:03:03,470 --> 02:03:08,470
you know,
talk about your cubicle job and go 

2898
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:08,470
travel,
go.

2899
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:09,290
You know,
they follow your path.

2900
02:03:09,410 --> 02:03:14,410
You've always stayed with martial arts 
and then all a sudden this thing comes 

2901
02:03:14,410 --> 02:03:15,830
up and it wasn't lucky.
It was the fact that you had.

2902
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:18,650
I'm honored your,
your passion.

2903
02:03:18,710 --> 02:03:20,990
Not just in being a standup but in life.

2904
02:03:20,990 --> 02:03:23,270
And that's what I say to young comics.
Like go,

2905
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:23,810
you know,
like me,

2906
02:03:23,811 --> 02:03:26,150
I got married and I kid.
That's something I really wanted.

2907
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:27,560
I love,
I'm into.

2908
02:03:27,830 --> 02:03:29,780
I talk about it onstage and you,
you see people go,

2909
02:03:29,930 --> 02:03:30,740
oh,
I'm not going to be one of those.

2910
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:35,770
Go talk about my kids on stage.
It's like it doesn't matter when I talk 

2911
02:03:35,770 --> 02:03:37,490
about I'm saying it.
Anybody can make a topic interesting.

2912
02:03:37,491 --> 02:03:40,400
If it's truthful and real.
That's a weird thing that people do when

2913
02:03:40,401 --> 02:03:43,070
they believe that somehow or another.
If you talk about children,

2914
02:03:43,071 --> 02:03:46,340
like all of a sudden you've fallen into 
this soul sell out,

2915
02:03:46,860 --> 02:03:51,170
like really pacified sort of a wishy 
washy sort of stand up.

2916
02:03:51,410 --> 02:03:56,410
Like you abandoned the possibility that 
anything could actually be really funny 

2917
02:03:56,410 --> 02:03:58,460
about having kids when in fact it's 
funny shit that happens all the time.

2918
02:03:58,480 --> 02:03:59,780
Yup.
Well not just funny,

2919
02:03:59,781 --> 02:04:01,220
but it's perspective.

2920
02:04:01,250 --> 02:04:02,560
It's existential,
you know,

2921
02:04:02,570 --> 02:04:07,570
I mean you're talking about life here.
There's going to get any deeper than 

2922
02:04:07,570 --> 02:04:07,570
having looking at your son.
Like,

2923
02:04:07,570 --> 02:04:08,510
I'm going through this thing now where 
my kid is like,

2924
02:04:08,710 --> 02:04:13,710
I'll tell you,
he's testing for his black belt in 

2925
02:04:13,710 --> 02:04:13,710
taekwondo in the spring after fucking 
seven years.

2926
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:15,200
Uh,
he's 11 years old.

2927
02:04:15,201 --> 02:04:18,260
He's captain of the soccer team,
straight a student.

2928
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:21,950
He is fluent in Spanish because to a 
Spanish immersion school.

2929
02:04:22,070 --> 02:04:25,190
He's the tallest kid in his class.
It's fucking beautiful looking.

2930
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:27,290
And I go,
I need a DNA test.

2931
02:04:27,291 --> 02:04:28,540
No,
I don't fucking do.

2932
02:04:28,541 --> 02:04:29,430
Don't believe it.
Who?

2933
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:31,880
I'm the opposite of that Short,
scrawny,

2934
02:04:31,881 --> 02:04:34,730
horrible athlete.
Horrible fucking student.

2935
02:04:34,760 --> 02:04:37,560
Maybe it's the hormones and the beef 
could be.

2936
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:38,190
It could be.

2937
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:40,770
Kids are getting way bigger.
There are 100 percent.

2938
02:04:40,771 --> 02:04:41,150
They're bigger.

2939
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:45,260
The girls are having their periods and 
so I'm going through this thing.

2940
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:46,280
Land Connor,
good dad.

2941
02:04:46,310 --> 02:04:46,970
You raised them.
Well,

2942
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,260
I mean that's,
that's a good sign.

2943
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:50,630
It is a good sign.
I'm proud of that and it's also.

2944
02:04:50,631 --> 02:04:52,070
But it's,
it's a great premise.

2945
02:04:52,071 --> 02:04:57,071
Like I know my kid's going to be 
stronger and smarter than me soon and 

2946
02:04:57,071 --> 02:04:57,560
it's fucking scary and I'm trying to 
think,

2947
02:04:57,561 --> 02:04:58,610
how do I hide it from,
Oh,

2948
02:04:58,620 --> 02:05:01,590
you don't have to just be a great dad.
You don't have to look my.

2949
02:05:01,700 --> 02:05:04,580
You're using a belt.
I was a few late.

2950
02:05:04,581 --> 02:05:05,420
I'll hit me back.

2951
02:05:05,510 --> 02:05:07,430
Getting older.
There was always a,

2952
02:05:07,460 --> 02:05:12,460
these old martial arts guys that were 
around that were treated with great 

2953
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:12,460
reverence.
You know,

2954
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:13,540
you could easily kick their ass.
They're old,

2955
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:18,740
they're old and broken down,
but you never thought of that because 

2956
02:05:18,740 --> 02:05:18,770
you had always developed great reverence
for them.

2957
02:05:18,771 --> 02:05:21,560
Just as long as you develop respect your
kid,

2958
02:05:21,590 --> 02:05:23,670
your kid's never going to challenge.
You're going to have to deal with it.

2959
02:05:23,730 --> 02:05:24,170
Shit,
I never.

2960
02:05:24,270 --> 02:05:29,270
It's a very based biological.
I think it's just like a real in the 

2961
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:29,350
wild kind of thing.
It is a little bit,

2962
02:05:29,390 --> 02:05:34,390
but you know,
once you just got to calm that down by 

2963
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:34,390
letting them know that you're on his 
team,

2964
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:37,800
you know,
and letting them know that everything 

2965
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:37,800
that you do to discipline him is only 
for his own development.

2966
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:42,251
It seems weird,
but you went through it just as much as 

2967
02:05:42,251 --> 02:05:42,251
he is.

2968
02:05:42,251 --> 02:05:42,251
Yeah,
yeah.

2969
02:05:42,251 --> 02:05:43,090
Yeah.
And it is hard because as the dad,

2970
02:05:43,091 --> 02:05:45,850
and I don't know how deep you are into 
that part is like,

2971
02:05:46,090 --> 02:05:48,280
I feel like I have to be that,
you know,

2972
02:05:48,350 --> 02:05:53,350
it's a role.
She ended up being the disciplinarian 

2973
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:53,350
more than my wife does.

2974
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:53,350
Yeah,
of course.

2975
02:05:53,350 --> 02:05:53,840
Well,
you know,

2976
02:05:53,841 --> 02:05:58,841
there's a balance.
There's a yin and a Yang and there's a 

2977
02:05:58,841 --> 02:05:58,880
mom and dad and just the way it is and 
you know,

2978
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:00,470
you should be.
I mean,

2979
02:06:00,471 --> 02:06:02,540
my point of view is you should be as 
loving as possible,

2980
02:06:02,541 --> 02:06:06,950
but the shit stops with me and you know,
that's how it's always supposed to be.

2981
02:06:06,951 --> 02:06:08,570
That's how it isn't a fucking gorilla 
colony.

2982
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:09,450
When,
when,

2983
02:06:09,490 --> 02:06:13,020
when everybody's going crazy and fucking
swinging off trees and the grill goes,

2984
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:15,460
everybody settle the fuck down.
Alright.

2985
02:06:15,620 --> 02:06:18,470
Demands here we got this.
Let's calm down.

2986
02:06:18,720 --> 02:06:20,450
Yeah,
you can learn a lot about parenting from

2987
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:22,290
the dog guy.
What's his name?

2988
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:24,390
The kick your kids.
Everything.

2989
02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:27,370
He said,
well say takes the dog.

2990
02:06:27,410 --> 02:06:28,130
Oh,
I didn't know that.

2991
02:06:28,131 --> 02:06:33,131
You didn't know that.
Now I just knew this whole pack 

2992
02:06:33,131 --> 02:06:33,380
mentality saying is kick them.
He just taps him on the side.

2993
02:06:33,540 --> 02:06:33,840
No,
no.

2994
02:06:33,841 --> 02:06:36,180
He heals them in the gut and if you did 
it to me,

2995
02:06:36,181 --> 02:06:39,750
I'd punch him in his fucking face.
Reality kick is a kick.

2996
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:40,380
Yeah.
Well,

2997
02:06:40,410 --> 02:06:43,590
you know what the reality is though,
people don't want to hear.

2998
02:06:43,591 --> 02:06:45,510
You have to be physical with dogs.
You know?

2999
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:50,520
I know I never hit my dogs,
but I used to raise pit bulls and the 

3000
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:50,520
one thing you have to do is you have to 
dominate.

3001
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:52,530
Those motherfuckers are used to slam on 
their back.

3002
02:06:52,531 --> 02:06:55,980
I used to mount them and bite them,
bite their face and yell at them because

3003
02:06:55,981 --> 02:07:00,981
if they growl at you a little man,
you have to cease and desist that when 

3004
02:07:00,981 --> 02:07:01,260
they're a puppy,
you have to make sure that you make them

3005
02:07:01,261 --> 02:07:03,540
know that you are.
You are dominant over them,

3006
02:07:03,541 --> 02:07:06,120
but you're loving to them.
Do you control them?

3007
02:07:06,121 --> 02:07:06,570
Like,
listen,

3008
02:07:06,571 --> 02:07:08,220
bitch,
when you ever fucking do that again.

3009
02:07:08,221 --> 02:07:09,040
Okay.
Yeah,

3010
02:07:09,060 --> 02:07:10,310
we good Gimme Gimme kiss,

3011
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:11,030
yeah.
Yeah.

3012
02:07:11,031 --> 02:07:16,031
And too little pussy dogs,
but one of them is a buyer and I just 

3013
02:07:16,031 --> 02:07:19,620
grab her by the scruff of the neck and I
pushed her face down and I put my face 

3014
02:07:19,620 --> 02:07:23,731
in front of it and I growl and granted 
it doesn't matter how small a doug has 

3015
02:07:23,731 --> 02:07:25,560
that motherfucker bites.
My friend

3016
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:30,560
had a fucking,
a miniature pincher and this 

3017
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,140
motherfucker beat the shit out of me.
Once we were watching tv,

3018
02:07:31,141 --> 02:07:34,230
I was just sitting there and the thing 
snuck up behind me and just jacked me in

3019
02:07:34,231 --> 02:07:35,770
the back.
Oh yeah.

3020
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:40,950
Out of nowhere.
It was a creepy dark when on the couch 

3021
02:07:40,950 --> 02:07:42,150
and just fucking fucking.
Oh,

3022
02:07:42,340 --> 02:07:44,250
it was a mean little dog.
I don't know what happened to the little

3023
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:46,390
and development.
You motherfucker.

3024
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:48,430
You nailed it and right away.
But I was like,

3025
02:07:48,431 --> 02:07:49,870
dude,
you got to lock your dog up man.

3026
02:07:49,871 --> 02:07:52,270
Your dog's a biter.
Punctured skin on my back.

3027
02:07:52,410 --> 02:07:53,100
Yeah,
I actually,

3028
02:07:53,101 --> 02:07:55,500
it's funny you bring that up.
The reason my son's in taekwondo,

3029
02:07:55,590 --> 02:07:57,240
he used to bite other kids when he was 
like three.

3030
02:07:57,360 --> 02:08:02,360
And we're like,
what the fuck are we going to do when 

3031
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:03,741
someone is at taekwondo?
It'll teach them discipline piece and 

3032
02:08:03,741 --> 02:08:04,290
I'll tell you,
man,

3033
02:08:04,291 --> 02:08:09,291
it's six months.
He just stopped and he's like this 

3034
02:08:09,291 --> 02:08:09,291
well-disciplined kid.
But um,

3035
02:08:09,450 --> 02:08:10,170
no,
but it's all,

3036
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:12,720
it's all on me.
This thing with my son.

3037
02:08:12,721 --> 02:08:15,090
I know that it's a psychological thing 
and it's just.

3038
02:08:15,180 --> 02:08:20,180
But I'm,
I'd be embarrassed to think that and I 

3039
02:08:20,180 --> 02:08:23,571
say it out loud and I do talk about it 
onstage because to me that's what stand 

3040
02:08:23,571 --> 02:08:27,491
up is,
what's the thing I'm most embarrassed 

3041
02:08:27,491 --> 02:08:27,491
about in my life right now at a deep 
level.

3042
02:08:27,491 --> 02:08:29,100
And it's like I've,
I've a very oedipal feeling right now,

3043
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:34,160
which is a real thing that dads go 
through with sons is you start to my 

3044
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:34,620
dad.
I felt that my dad,

3045
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:37,770
but yeah.
But he's a kid

3046
02:08:42,220 --> 02:08:46,080
fairly might be a struggle.
Yeah.

3047
02:08:46,081 --> 02:08:48,510
And that was start taking Jujitsu now.
Keep him away.

3048
02:08:48,511 --> 02:08:50,640
And you start lifting.

3049
02:08:50,710 --> 02:08:55,710
Now I believe me,
I see only good things for us in our 

3050
02:08:55,710 --> 02:08:55,710
future.
It's just a,

3051
02:08:55,710 --> 02:08:55,710
it's a weird emotion.

3052
02:08:55,710 --> 02:08:56,840
I feel,
you know,

3053
02:08:57,200 --> 02:09:01,360
my friend Rick has two kids that are 20 
and 18 now and he's like to get both be.

3054
02:09:01,630 --> 02:09:05,790
He has this relationship with them.
It's good.

3055
02:09:06,090 --> 02:09:06,560
Used to go

3056
02:09:06,870 --> 02:09:10,200
period in their late teens when they 
fucking hated you and I don't think they

3057
02:09:10,201 --> 02:09:15,201
do as much.
I think parents are better now and I 

3058
02:09:15,201 --> 02:09:17,961
think there's obviously that pull away 
part where they have to find themselves 

3059
02:09:17,961 --> 02:09:17,961
among their friends more than their 
family,

3060
02:09:17,961 --> 02:09:19,980
but it's not that violent.
I hate you.

3061
02:09:20,460 --> 02:09:25,460
I think there was a lot of.
Because I said so when we were growing 

3062
02:09:25,460 --> 02:09:25,460
up,
what the fuck?

3063
02:09:25,460 --> 02:09:27,410
Give me a goddamn x and now I think you 
know,

3064
02:09:27,550 --> 02:09:30,070
because enough generations get through 
that where you say,

3065
02:09:30,071 --> 02:09:32,140
I am not going to do that stupid shit 
when I have kids.

3066
02:09:32,350 --> 02:09:34,180
I'm going to respect my kids 
intelligence.

3067
02:09:34,181 --> 02:09:39,181
Like I have like long conversations with
my daughter about why it's wrong to do 

3068
02:09:39,221 --> 02:09:41,650
this and this is what's wrong.
Because when you do that,

3069
02:09:41,651 --> 02:09:46,651
I know you feel like it's right,
but you heard other people's feelings 

3070
02:09:46,651 --> 02:09:48,280
and you should always avoid hurting 
other people's feelings.

3071
02:09:48,281 --> 02:09:51,660
If you can write right and then we'll 
have a long,

3072
02:09:51,661 --> 02:09:55,180
long time.
Nobody ever did that with me was because

3073
02:09:55,181 --> 02:09:58,040
I fucking said so go to your room and 
you know,

3074
02:09:58,090 --> 02:10:00,400
that's what,
what we got when we were kids.

3075
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:05,630
They were.
Nobody was educated on how to 

3076
02:10:05,630 --> 02:10:07,741
psychologically properly evaluate and 
how to raise children because their 

3077
02:10:07,741 --> 02:10:09,250
parents grew up in the fucking 
depression when you had it.

3078
02:10:09,390 --> 02:10:11,780
My grandfather used to tell stories 
about breaking rabbits.

3079
02:10:11,800 --> 02:10:13,320
Next,
how you break a rabbit's neck,

3080
02:10:13,510 --> 02:10:16,180
put a pot to make rabbit stew.
And I was like,

3081
02:10:16,181 --> 02:10:17,380
Jesus,
you hate rabbits.

3082
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:19,510
The fuck was wrong with the world back 
then.

3083
02:10:19,810 --> 02:10:22,000
And um,
but my grandfather living on a farm,

3084
02:10:22,001 --> 02:10:24,160
you know,
as a young boy in Italy.

3085
02:10:24,340 --> 02:10:25,690
Yeah.
So she had to do.

3086
02:10:25,900 --> 02:10:28,960
There was no getting around that growing
up in a Catholic country like that.

3087
02:10:28,961 --> 02:10:29,650
I mean,
there is a,

3088
02:10:29,680 --> 02:10:33,800
there's an intense shame that's put upon
you a young age.

3089
02:10:33,801 --> 02:10:34,310
You know,
you're,

3090
02:10:34,311 --> 02:10:37,430
you're taught at an early age,
you're born into original sin,

3091
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:42,440
Adam and he fucked up.
So you're bad and dirty starting out and

3092
02:10:42,441 --> 02:10:45,440
then you get to a sex.
Well,

3093
02:10:45,441 --> 02:10:50,441
Jesus came out of an immaculate 
conception because any woman that 

3094
02:10:50,441 --> 02:10:51,050
actually fucks to make a human life is a
whore.

3095
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:56,200
She had to be pure,
like all these images that you may not 

3096
02:10:56,200 --> 02:10:59,981
even processed,
but they get into your hard drive when 

3097
02:10:59,981 --> 02:10:59,981
you're young of like,
shame on us.

3098
02:10:59,981 --> 02:11:00,070
Shame on this bat.
I,

3099
02:11:00,080 --> 02:11:02,360
I was raised with it and it's like the 
biggest thing

3100
02:11:02,560 --> 02:11:05,930
that's the guilt is the.
The east coast is main curse.

3101
02:11:05,970 --> 02:11:10,970
Yeah.
It's one of the things most fucked up 

3102
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:12,671
about the east coast is the wave of 
Catholic guilt that is just polluted or 

3103
02:11:12,671 --> 02:11:16,381
the consciousness,
the consciousness of all the different 

3104
02:11:16,381 --> 02:11:16,460
people there and think about what our 
grandparents went through.

3105
02:11:16,461 --> 02:11:21,461
Man.
I mean our parents were raised by our 

3106
02:11:21,461 --> 02:11:22,520
grandparents.
Our grandparents lived in the dark ages.

3107
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:27,560
Essentially.
They lived in an area with no fucking 

3108
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:30,251
television.
There was no nothing when they were 

3109
02:11:30,251 --> 02:11:30,251
children,
there was no nothing there.

3110
02:11:30,251 --> 02:11:34,551
There was the written word and you know,
occasionally you would see a photo of 

3111
02:11:34,551 --> 02:11:34,920
somebody.
Yeah,

3112
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:36,980
know I mean Jesus Christ.
I mean,

3113
02:11:37,130 --> 02:11:40,190
imagine what was like growing up 
literally at the turn of the century,

3114
02:11:40,220 --> 02:11:42,860
1900 mean fuck

3115
02:11:43,020 --> 02:11:45,650
you didn't travel.
You had no outside influences,

3116
02:11:45,660 --> 02:11:50,660
so whatever you were taught,
whether it's by the church or by your 

3117
02:11:50,660 --> 02:11:52,410
parents that were living in fear,
that was your whole reality.

3118
02:11:52,411 --> 02:11:54,100
You had nothing to balance that out so 
you,

3119
02:11:54,140 --> 02:11:59,140
you bought it even more so than maybe I 
was affected by a Catholic upbringing 

3120
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:00,720
back then.
There was no separation between what you

3121
02:12:00,721 --> 02:12:03,600
were living and anything outside in the 
world

3122
02:12:03,700 --> 02:12:07,710
and my grandparents.
I don't know what generation you are all

3123
02:12:07,910 --> 02:12:09,570
came over from Ireland.
My grandparents.

3124
02:12:09,590 --> 02:12:10,810
Yeah,
mine as well.

3125
02:12:10,811 --> 02:12:13,510
Mine.
My grandfather came over from Ireland on

3126
02:12:13,511 --> 02:12:18,511
my father's side.
My grandmother on my father's side came 

3127
02:12:18,511 --> 02:12:21,421
over from Italy and both my grandparents
on my mother's side came over from 

3128
02:12:21,421 --> 02:12:21,910
Italy,
so everybody took a fucking crazy chance

3129
02:12:21,911 --> 02:12:23,800
and jumped in a boat when across the 
ocean.

3130
02:12:23,801 --> 02:12:27,230
So they were not the nuttiest fuckers 
effort.

3131
02:12:27,610 --> 02:12:31,420
You didn't even know what stories people
told you.

3132
02:12:31,430 --> 02:12:36,430
Stories.
You have to see a picture of what New 

3133
02:12:36,430 --> 02:12:36,770
York City looks like.
They took a fucking chance like animals,

3134
02:12:36,771 --> 02:12:37,020
like

3135
02:12:37,240 --> 02:12:39,550
I was thinking about that.
The second you step off the boat,

3136
02:12:39,670 --> 02:12:42,520
maybe you got a piece of paper with an 
address somewhere in the city.

3137
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:45,040
You've never fucking.
You've never found your way in a foreign

3138
02:12:45,041 --> 02:12:50,041
place in your life.
You grew up in one town that you never 

3139
02:12:50,041 --> 02:12:52,381
left.
Now you're surfing Manhattan trying to 

3140
02:12:52,381 --> 02:12:52,381
find Second Avenue East.

3141
02:12:52,381 --> 02:12:56,260
Crazy and you.
If you've never seen the gangs of New 

3142
02:12:56,260 --> 02:12:59,560
York,
most people don't know what Manhattan 

3143
02:12:59,560 --> 02:13:02,711
used to be.
You just kind of assume somehow that it 

3144
02:13:02,711 --> 02:13:03,010
was always this city at the big 
buildings.

3145
02:13:03,020 --> 02:13:04,820
No,
it was craziness.

3146
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:09,910
Who was a nutty village.
It was really feudalism gangs of New 

3147
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:10,460
York.
It was.

3148
02:13:10,580 --> 02:13:13,040
That was really what it was like back 
then and it's.

3149
02:13:13,041 --> 02:13:18,041
It's an amazing thing to watch.
It sort of puts the whole idea of 

3150
02:13:18,041 --> 02:13:21,431
settling this country into perspective 
because most people can't really wrap 

3151
02:13:21,431 --> 02:13:25,751
their heads around how quickly the 
United States has developed the idea 

3152
02:13:25,751 --> 02:13:28,670
that 17,
76 it was formed that that's nothing.

3153
02:13:29,060 --> 02:13:32,190
That is like nothing.
There was nothing here.

3154
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:35,160
A few houses.
If you fucking log houses here and there

3155
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:37,200
and then all of a sudden in a couple of 
hundred years,

3156
02:13:37,370 --> 02:13:40,000
wash everything.
Manhattan,

3157
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:44,280
fucking Atlanta,
Chicago fucking roads all the way across

3158
02:13:44,281 --> 02:13:46,200
this bitch back and forth.
Covered in.

3159
02:13:46,550 --> 02:13:50,770
Yeah.
Horace flying over freaking me out right

3160
02:13:50,771 --> 02:13:55,771
now.
The fact that that happens over looking 

3161
02:13:55,771 --> 02:13:56,440
at your eyes,
I was like,

3162
02:13:56,560 --> 02:13:57,300
Holy Shit.

3163
02:13:57,700 --> 02:13:59,740
One hundred years,
200 years.

3164
02:13:59,741 --> 02:14:04,741
It went from that to 1776 to 1976,
200 years

3165
02:14:05,350 --> 02:14:07,330
and then you think about,
and this is my always my thing,

3166
02:14:07,331 --> 02:14:07,850
people,
they'll,

3167
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:09,520
well,
black people need to get over it.

3168
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:11,740
There were slaves too to fucking 
generations ago.

3169
02:14:12,130 --> 02:14:17,130
That's a short period of time to expect 
an entire culture of people to recover 

3170
02:14:18,311 --> 02:14:23,311
from a really fuck.
You talk about Catholicism being fucked 

3171
02:14:23,311 --> 02:14:24,850
up two generations ago.
How about your mother?

3172
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:26,790
Your grandmother was getting raped and 
your,

3173
02:14:26,850 --> 02:14:30,100
your father and mother were split up.
Your aunts and uncles were splitter.

3174
02:14:30,150 --> 02:14:32,170
I mean that.
That's a lie and the grant.

3175
02:14:32,171 --> 02:14:37,171
Granted I'm not like A.
I think affirmative action was a 

3176
02:14:37,171 --> 02:14:38,440
failure.
I think that we're grappling with how to

3177
02:14:38,441 --> 02:14:42,520
try to equalize society for all people.
I don't know the answer,

3178
02:14:42,790 --> 02:14:45,250
but I do know that it did.
We got to look at is our problem.

3179
02:14:45,251 --> 02:14:46,270
It's not their problem.

3180
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:48,570
I think it has to do with poverty in 
general.

3181
02:14:48,690 --> 02:14:53,690
I think we have to address poverty from 
the standpoint of children's being 

3182
02:14:53,690 --> 02:14:53,820
children,
being raised in children's,

3183
02:14:53,850 --> 02:14:55,260
children's,
children's,

3184
02:14:55,310 --> 02:15:00,310
being raised in a bad community.
I think children being raised in poverty

3185
02:15:00,631 --> 02:15:03,410
and neglect is always the big issue 
because if you're,

3186
02:15:03,600 --> 02:15:04,920
if you don't do something about those 
kids,

3187
02:15:04,921 --> 02:15:09,921
now you are just essentially you're 
going to give them no choice but to 

3188
02:15:09,921 --> 02:15:13,431
become criminals themselves.
If they're being raised in the 

3189
02:15:13,431 --> 02:15:13,431
environment,
the imitate their atmosphere,

3190
02:15:13,431 --> 02:15:17,541
everything around them is bad.
Everything around them is negative and 

3191
02:15:17,541 --> 02:15:17,790
neglect and what is happening?
What is.

3192
02:15:18,030 --> 02:15:18,570
There's,
there's,

3193
02:15:18,571 --> 02:15:23,571
uh,
there's gotta be a way to get to those 

3194
02:15:23,571 --> 02:15:26,091
kids to get to those kids and help them 
see some something where it helps their 

3195
02:15:26,091 --> 02:15:26,910
parents or some sort of a community 
outreach.

3196
02:15:27,060 --> 02:15:30,840
But the idea that people at the top say,
why should I give them anything?

3197
02:15:30,990 --> 02:15:33,300
Fucking single mom just wants to have 
more kids and like,

3198
02:15:33,510 --> 02:15:35,670
well don't you?
Isn't there a root cause of that,

3199
02:15:35,671 --> 02:15:37,410
that single mom,
but someone's baby at one point,

3200
02:15:37,570 --> 02:15:42,570
obviously someone fuck that baby up bad 
that it became a grown adult that just 

3201
02:15:42,570 --> 02:15:47,331
shits out kids for welfare money,
like what are we going to do is get to 

3202
02:15:47,331 --> 02:15:50,241
them when they're babies.
You got to them when they're babies and 

3203
02:15:50,241 --> 02:15:51,480
help them help the mother help for the 
sake of the humanity as a whole,

3204
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:54,000
as a super organism.
Officially.

3205
02:15:54,060 --> 02:15:54,540
That's the thing.

3206
02:15:56,200 --> 02:16:00,680
Service is very often I find that there 
is a short sightedness if they're the.

3207
02:16:00,890 --> 02:16:05,390
They're the party of economic restraint 
and responsibility.

3208
02:16:05,690 --> 02:16:10,690
I think that you're creating a bigger 
deficit and you're creating a more 

3209
02:16:10,690 --> 02:16:12,650
fragile economy when you have people 
that are uneducated,

3210
02:16:12,860 --> 02:16:13,940
that grew up,
like you said,

3211
02:16:13,941 --> 02:16:18,941
in an atmosphere where they were abused 
and they don't have the tools and 

3212
02:16:18,941 --> 02:16:20,120
they're role models were shit.
If you allow that to happen,

3213
02:16:20,121 --> 02:16:23,240
it's a drain selfishly on your economy.

3214
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:28,320
Yes.
Absolute fucking Luli and on your 

3215
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:28,320
safety,
your economy and your safety,

3216
02:16:28,320 --> 02:16:32,970
investing in the of inner cities and 
building the bad neighborhoods and 

3217
02:16:32,970 --> 02:16:37,351
turning them into better neighborhoods 
and giving people a chance and hope and 

3218
02:16:37,351 --> 02:16:38,740
giving them a possibility of positively 
contributing to society.

3219
02:16:38,741 --> 02:16:41,080
So instead of being a burden there,
there's something

3220
02:16:41,590 --> 02:16:42,770
anybody wants.
Yes,

3221
02:16:43,130 --> 02:16:44,490
root of happiness.
They,

3222
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:49,500
again,
going back to these studies is the most 

3223
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:52,631
that you can boil it down to.
And there's this guy that wrote a book 

3224
02:16:52,631 --> 02:16:52,631
called happiness.
He was a,

3225
02:16:52,631 --> 02:16:56,231
he teaches a class at Harvard.
It's the most attended class in the 

3226
02:16:56,231 --> 02:16:59,861
history of Harvard University and he's a
guy that's taken every type of thought 

3227
02:16:59,861 --> 02:17:03,911
going back to fucking Confucius and 
Jesus and young and then modern 

3228
02:17:03,911 --> 02:17:08,471
psychiatry and basically just studied it
for a decade and come up with basically 

3229
02:17:08,510 --> 02:17:13,510
happiness is pursuing something that you
care about and feeling vital.

3230
02:17:14,990 --> 02:17:16,820
That's it.
Not Welfare.

3231
02:17:16,850 --> 02:17:19,880
Nobody wants to fucking welfare.
Check to re to be a single mom.

3232
02:17:20,060 --> 02:17:22,580
People want to be involved.
They want to feel that they,

3233
02:17:22,820 --> 02:17:25,130
uh,
they are making an imprint on the earth.

3234
02:17:25,220 --> 02:17:30,220
Yeah.
So some some sort of a community 

3235
02:17:30,220 --> 02:17:32,471
outreach with me and then you know,
you've got to have things that help 

3236
02:17:32,471 --> 02:17:35,891
people get off drugs just for a fact.
There's going to be people that are 

3237
02:17:35,891 --> 02:17:39,101
fucked up and they're not going to be 
able to make positive decisions because 

3238
02:17:39,101 --> 02:17:39,200
they're on drugs and if that's your 
environment,

3239
02:17:39,201 --> 02:17:41,240
if that's your community events,
your neighborhood,

3240
02:17:41,730 --> 02:17:43,970
it's within your best interest to clean 
these people up.

3241
02:17:44,010 --> 02:17:49,010
Yeah.
It's when the war on drugs now heading 

3242
02:17:49,010 --> 02:17:50,400
off the off the need to do drugs is 
what?

3243
02:17:50,401 --> 02:17:53,070
What does that treat treatment?
Not incarcerated.

3244
02:17:53,110 --> 02:17:58,110
Yeah.
Not and not judging people and the more 

3245
02:17:58,110 --> 02:18:00,871
things are illegal,
the more people are going to do those 

3246
02:18:00,871 --> 02:18:02,821
illegal things.
It's always been the case and at least 

3247
02:18:02,821 --> 02:18:02,821
if you had legality,
you could.

3248
02:18:02,821 --> 02:18:07,770
First of all,
it should always be a social pariah and 

3249
02:18:07,770 --> 02:18:11,131
you should boycott any fucking company 
that would profit off the sale of those 

3250
02:18:11,131 --> 02:18:11,131
drugs.
They should be you,

3251
02:18:11,131 --> 02:18:15,630
the drugs,
any drugs that you sell the fuck people 

3252
02:18:15,630 --> 02:18:18,511
up.
The negative stigma should be the 

3253
02:18:18,511 --> 02:18:20,311
punishment enough.
You should be disassociated by society 

3254
02:18:20,311 --> 02:18:23,080
if you choose to sell and something 
that's going to cause people to fuck up 

3255
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:26,521
their lives.
And we all know that there's drugs that 

3256
02:18:26,521 --> 02:18:28,561
do that.
And anybody who's selling math is a 

3257
02:18:28,561 --> 02:18:28,561
piece of shit.
It's 2012.

3258
02:18:28,561 --> 02:18:28,561
We've got info,

3259
02:18:28,561 --> 02:18:32,110
but there's always going to be a new 
hillbilly.

3260
02:18:32,290 --> 02:18:34,330
Cocaine is always going to be a fucking 
a meal.

3261
02:18:34,360 --> 02:18:36,070
Ammonia mixed with this.
That gets you high.

3262
02:18:36,370 --> 02:18:39,310
So to me it's about how do we cut out 
the abuse?

3263
02:18:39,430 --> 02:18:44,430
How do we cut out the loneliness,
the uselessness that creates a need for 

3264
02:18:44,430 --> 02:18:46,000
drug use or alcohol?
Alcohol is the fucking,

3265
02:18:46,150 --> 02:18:48,560
that's the unsung hero of failure.
You know,

3266
02:18:48,561 --> 02:18:51,280
it's,
it's worse than drugs and yet it's on in

3267
02:18:51,281 --> 02:18:53,360
the superbowl and it's legal.
And uh,

3268
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:54,010
you know,
to me,

3269
02:18:54,011 --> 02:18:55,630
I don't want to go down that road 
because that's a whole other.

3270
02:18:55,810 --> 02:18:56,550
Well,
that's awesome.

3271
02:18:56,560 --> 02:18:58,750
When you changed as a person when we 
were young,

3272
02:18:58,751 --> 02:19:01,030
you got much more serious about your 
career as well.

3273
02:19:01,031 --> 02:19:02,950
When you quit drinking,
you know,

3274
02:19:03,010 --> 02:19:03,880
you,
you went,

3275
02:19:03,881 --> 02:19:05,590
you were the first guy that I knew that 
uh,

3276
02:19:05,591 --> 02:19:07,900
you,
you handled it great because you didn't,

3277
02:19:08,170 --> 02:19:09,490
you didn't waver at all.
You're like,

3278
02:19:09,491 --> 02:19:10,630
look,
I can't drink.

3279
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:12,430
I drink.
I get fucked up.

3280
02:19:12,431 --> 02:19:14,350
I can't handle it,
period.

3281
02:19:14,650 --> 02:19:16,480
I don't want to be a loser.
I'm done.

3282
02:19:16,481 --> 02:19:18,850
And you did that when you were like 20,
22.

3283
02:19:19,300 --> 02:19:24,300
No,
I was probably 24 when I did it and it 

3284
02:19:24,300 --> 02:19:24,300
was,
you know,

3285
02:19:24,300 --> 02:19:24,360
I had started drinking very young and,
but,

3286
02:19:24,361 --> 02:19:29,361
but it was stand up.
I mean I couldn't drive to gigs if I 

3287
02:19:29,361 --> 02:19:30,350
lost my license and stand.
It was the first thing in my life I ever

3288
02:19:30,351 --> 02:19:32,330
felt like I might be good at what I was 
like,

3289
02:19:32,331 --> 02:19:34,970
I'm not going to lose.
This has been my dream since I was a kid

3290
02:19:34,971 --> 02:19:35,550
to be a standup.

3291
02:19:35,580 --> 02:19:36,780
So you're not,
you know,

3292
02:19:36,781 --> 02:19:41,640
you're not a stranger when it comes to 
the polls of addiction and the idea that

3293
02:19:41,641 --> 02:19:44,220
it could ruin your life and think,
what if you didn't have stand up?

3294
02:19:44,490 --> 02:19:49,490
What if you know you were in a pit of 
despair with a shit job and no future 

3295
02:19:49,490 --> 02:19:52,740
aspirations or hopes you know nothing on
the landscape.

3296
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:53,850
Fuck man,

3297
02:19:53,900 --> 02:19:58,900
you need an opportunity.
It's got to be a compelling option 

3298
02:19:58,900 --> 02:19:59,820
because getting high feels fucking 
great.

3299
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:03,840
Nobody can deny that and if you don't 
feel great and you can feel great,

3300
02:20:03,990 --> 02:20:08,990
that's what you're going to do.
And the only thing that feels better is 

3301
02:20:08,990 --> 02:20:11,930
feeling like people are expecting you to
produce something and you do it and you 

3302
02:20:11,930 --> 02:20:11,930
feel good.

3303
02:20:11,930 --> 02:20:12,310
Well,
especially as an artist,

3304
02:20:12,311 --> 02:20:13,750
I mean,
and I hate that word,

3305
02:20:13,751 --> 02:20:15,430
you know,
I'm an artist,

3306
02:20:15,490 --> 02:20:20,490
but,
but putting out something that you 

3307
02:20:20,490 --> 02:20:20,490
create,
that people enjoy,

3308
02:20:20,490 --> 02:20:20,490
they love it.
You know,

3309
02:20:20,490 --> 02:20:21,370
people like podcasts,
like this,

3310
02:20:21,371 --> 02:20:22,480
one of your podcasts,
people,

3311
02:20:22,510 --> 02:20:25,720
people love the fact that they can get 
some enjoyment out of this.

3312
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:26,850
Like when I go to,
um,

3313
02:20:26,851 --> 02:20:27,270
I,
I,

3314
02:20:27,360 --> 02:20:32,360
I'm the only podcast I really subscribe 
to other than a few of my friends still 

3315
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:34,750
from desk squad and stuff is a 
psychedelic salon.

3316
02:20:35,090 --> 02:20:37,360
My favorite podcast,
it's like this guy,

3317
02:20:37,870 --> 02:20:40,870
I think his name is Lorenzo.
Lorenzo is the guy who runs it and he,

3318
02:20:40,871 --> 02:20:42,250
um,
he puts all these really,

3319
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:44,110
really interesting lectures like Timothy
Leary,

3320
02:20:44,111 --> 02:20:47,230
lecturers and Robert Anton Wilson and 
Terence Mckenna,

3321
02:20:47,231 --> 02:20:47,770
and uh,
you know,

3322
02:20:47,830 --> 02:20:52,830
every week there's some new really cool 
fucking interesting lecture by some 

3323
02:20:52,830 --> 02:20:54,460
really educated,
trippy people,

3324
02:20:54,780 --> 02:20:55,300
you know,
it's,

3325
02:20:55,320 --> 02:20:57,670
it's really awesome.
And when I look at my Ipod,

3326
02:20:57,671 --> 02:20:59,610
when I sync my ipod on like,
oh,

3327
02:20:59,720 --> 02:21:00,330
keep looking,

3328
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:02,300
you get excited,
you know,

3329
02:21:02,301 --> 02:21:04,670
it's like now I know what I'm in,
I'm in my car.

3330
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:06,980
It syncs up with my car.
So I'm driving around,

3331
02:21:06,981 --> 02:21:08,960
I'm listening to it and it's a,
I love that.

3332
02:21:08,961 --> 02:21:13,961
I love that.
That's a treat that you can get for 

3333
02:21:13,961 --> 02:21:13,961
free.

3334
02:21:13,961 --> 02:21:17,140
And they've been pretty good feeling to 
think that people feel like that when 

3335
02:21:17,140 --> 02:21:18,150
they see your podcast going down.

3336
02:21:18,390 --> 02:21:23,390
And for Brian and I,
it's a particularly satisfying because 

3337
02:21:23,390 --> 02:21:24,160
we didn't have any aspirations at all.
We just,

3338
02:21:24,210 --> 02:21:29,210
we started it off.
You could see the first one's still 

3339
02:21:29,210 --> 02:21:29,210
available and ustream was with a laptop 
is terrible.

3340
02:21:29,210 --> 02:21:29,580
It's unwatchable,
right?

3341
02:21:29,820 --> 02:21:31,350
Yeah.
It's just because we,

3342
02:21:31,351 --> 02:21:31,790
w,
W,

3343
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:33,330
we weren't really paying attention to 
it.

3344
02:21:33,390 --> 02:21:35,210
As people listening,
we're,

3345
02:21:35,211 --> 02:21:36,270
we're more like,
hey,

3346
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:41,720
they're just watching us.
We'll just hang out in the chat room or 

3347
02:21:41,720 --> 02:21:41,720
something like that.
Paying 30 bitches,

3348
02:21:41,850 --> 02:21:43,950
what's going on?
And like read someone's tweets.

3349
02:21:43,951 --> 02:21:44,430
Yeah,
dude,

3350
02:21:44,460 --> 02:21:45,380
yeah,
we'll come into

3351
02:21:45,510 --> 02:21:48,350
New York.
I remember listening to an early one and

3352
02:21:48,351 --> 02:21:53,351
gone.
There was just a 32nd pause like you 

3353
02:21:53,351 --> 02:21:56,660
guys didn't the podcast.
I said I gotta take a shit.

3354
02:21:56,661 --> 02:21:57,730
So Brian,
you talked to them.

3355
02:21:58,020 --> 02:21:58,680
Surprise,
like,

3356
02:21:58,690 --> 02:22:03,690
so everybody do like cats,
like shit moving around and no one's 

3357
02:22:04,870 --> 02:22:06,560
going to be like,
oh,

3358
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:08,150
I kinda,
this is Kinda cool.

3359
02:22:08,151 --> 02:22:10,510
This is just a hang out.
It's the

3360
02:22:10,510 --> 02:22:13,120
real evolution of the podcast is 
available for everybody to say.

3361
02:22:13,130 --> 02:22:14,110
So we,
we,

3362
02:22:14,111 --> 02:22:14,990
uh,
I,

3363
02:22:15,010 --> 02:22:17,200
I always knew that I always wanted to do
a radio show,

3364
02:22:17,201 --> 02:22:19,300
but I always knew that I would never be 
able to do a radio show.

3365
02:22:19,360 --> 02:22:21,370
Like no one would ever hire me to do a 
radio show.

3366
02:22:21,670 --> 02:22:23,960
And I thought maybe when satellite radio
came along I was,

3367
02:22:24,190 --> 02:22:27,330
I became pals.
Like right when Santa Radio launch.

3368
02:22:27,331 --> 02:22:29,330
I became pals with opie and Anthony and 
then always like,

3369
02:22:29,331 --> 02:22:29,700
you know,
hey,

3370
02:22:29,701 --> 02:22:30,590
we have a channel,
you know,

3371
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:31,890
we'd always love to put you on the 
channel,

3372
02:22:32,130 --> 02:22:33,750
but nothing ever really happened out of 
it.

3373
02:22:33,751 --> 02:22:35,700
And there was some talks and nothing 
ever took pace.

3374
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:37,980
But then once I started doing a podcast 
I was like,

3375
02:22:38,040 --> 02:22:40,040
oh,
this is like,

3376
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:41,850
this is way easier.
This is.

3377
02:22:42,050 --> 02:22:44,370
And now I've got all these people coming
on,

3378
02:22:44,371 --> 02:22:46,620
like all these interesting people and 
all these like,

3379
02:22:46,621 --> 02:22:47,630
uh,
like uh,

3380
02:22:47,670 --> 02:22:50,160
like bands like we to be real from 
Cypress Hill.

3381
02:22:50,161 --> 02:22:52,130
Yesterday,
dude,

3382
02:22:52,140 --> 02:22:54,420
we've had everlast when the house of 
Payne,

3383
02:22:54,421 --> 02:22:57,570
he's done it before and his band honey 
honey is on next week.

3384
02:22:57,571 --> 02:22:58,740
And then Sam Harris,
the,

3385
02:22:58,741 --> 02:23:01,950
the,
the neuroscientist who's the atheist,

3386
02:23:01,980 --> 02:23:04,260
a author and lecturer.
He's coming,

3387
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:07,320
he's fucking brilliant.
I'm so excited about him coming on.

3388
02:23:07,470 --> 02:23:09,570
But it's like we've been able to turn it
from,

3389
02:23:09,930 --> 02:23:12,540
you know,
what he was supposed to be,

3390
02:23:12,700 --> 02:23:17,700
you know,
it was just us fucking around to what I 

3391
02:23:17,700 --> 02:23:17,700
really should have probably been doing 
in the first place.

3392
02:23:19,180 --> 02:23:20,590
I'm sorry,
know what is it?

3393
02:23:20,850 --> 02:23:25,850
It's Kinda like when you,
when you were talking about before with 

3394
02:23:25,850 --> 02:23:28,351
like the office,
the fact that or the man show the fact 

3395
02:23:28,351 --> 02:23:31,321
that you're stepping into a preconceived
creative paradigm and trying to fill it 

3396
02:23:31,321 --> 02:23:35,671
up is a failure to start with a podcast 
that aspires to nothing.

3397
02:23:36,400 --> 02:23:40,120
And then organically it builds itself 
and it knows what it is.

3398
02:23:40,121 --> 02:23:44,530
It's got a foundation based in who you 
really are as opposed to like,

3399
02:23:44,740 --> 02:23:45,380
you know,
um,

3400
02:23:45,640 --> 02:23:47,440
even as a comedian and he's starting 
out,

3401
02:23:47,441 --> 02:23:50,750
you go through so many different masks,
you think I'm going to be the,

3402
02:23:50,800 --> 02:23:53,080
like I was going to be the clever guy or
you know,

3403
02:23:53,081 --> 02:23:55,180
I'm going to be a political comic or I'm
going to use props.

3404
02:23:55,330 --> 02:23:56,200
Yeah,
go do it.

3405
02:23:56,230 --> 02:24:01,230
Go do it until it doesn't work and it 
keeps shedding and then eventually 

3406
02:24:01,230 --> 02:24:01,230
you're going to be the comic you're 
meant to be.

3407
02:24:01,230 --> 02:24:02,770
And I think with the podcast,
it's the same thing.

3408
02:24:02,771 --> 02:24:07,771
You kind of just,
you explore and you start to feel what 

3409
02:24:07,771 --> 02:24:11,281
feels right and um,
and hopefully not respond so much to 

3410
02:24:11,281 --> 02:24:11,281
like,
well,

3411
02:24:11,281 --> 02:24:12,730
people love this.
I try to avoid that.

3412
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:13,540
Yeah,
I think,

3413
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:18,600
you know,
people love what you love and if you 

3414
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:18,600
pursue,
if you pursue what you love,

3415
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:19,960
then people connected that and they can 
appreciate that.

3416
02:24:19,961 --> 02:24:20,980
I can appreciate that.
You know,

3417
02:24:20,981 --> 02:24:25,981
even if something that I'm not really 
into what I love is someone else being 

3418
02:24:25,981 --> 02:24:29,011
into something.
I love seeing people's passion and 

3419
02:24:29,011 --> 02:24:31,680
honesty and what you get from a podcast 
you don't get from anything else is 

3420
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:34,891
there's no restrictions on time.
We don't have to cut to a commercial 

3421
02:24:34,891 --> 02:24:38,930
there.
The thoughts never have to be 

3422
02:24:38,930 --> 02:24:40,711
interrupted.
I mean we didn't decide how long we're 

3423
02:24:40,711 --> 02:24:42,991
going.
We've been on for like two hours and 40 

3424
02:24:42,991 --> 02:24:42,991
minutes or something like that.
What's.

3425
02:24:42,991 --> 02:24:42,991
Yeah,
yeah,

3426
02:24:42,991 --> 02:24:43,990
let's do it all the time.
Yeah.

3427
02:24:43,991 --> 02:24:47,980
We do that all the time and they just go
on and take a 15 second pause.

3428
02:24:48,860 --> 02:24:51,700
This.
You don't get an opportunity to have a,

3429
02:24:51,900 --> 02:24:54,040
those kinds of conversations in,
in the,

3430
02:24:54,110 --> 02:24:54,700
in,
in.

3431
02:24:54,701 --> 02:24:57,880
Especially with someone that's in the 
public eye or something that's a comic.

3432
02:24:57,940 --> 02:25:02,940
No one gets a chance to really get to 
know you like they do in this form or 

3433
02:25:02,940 --> 02:25:06,991
like they do on your podcast where 
you're constantly communicating with 

3434
02:25:06,991 --> 02:25:07,510
them when they've heard you communicate 
for 100 hours,

3435
02:25:07,511 --> 02:25:08,550
they fucking know.
Yeah.

3436
02:25:08,551 --> 02:25:10,210
Yeah.
You can only hide so much

3437
02:25:10,290 --> 02:25:12,750
and you know,
what's amazing is every podcast,

3438
02:25:12,751 --> 02:25:17,751
no matter how long I end up hanging out 
with the guests for another 45 minutes 

3439
02:25:17,751 --> 02:25:19,200
afterwards and you're like,
but I want to leave.

3440
02:25:19,260 --> 02:25:20,640
But you could have just kept going.
Yeah.

3441
02:25:20,660 --> 02:25:21,690
And well,
I do.

3442
02:25:21,691 --> 02:25:26,691
I do to a point.
I always feel like a lot of times 

3443
02:25:26,691 --> 02:25:27,790
because I do the serious show first,
I've already given me an hour and then I

3444
02:25:27,791 --> 02:25:30,550
usually shoot a video with them.
I do this thing called talk your way out

3445
02:25:30,551 --> 02:25:33,040
of it where I give people and on I'll do
it to you right now.

3446
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:36,610
I'm going to give you an uncomfortable 
situation and in a split second,

3447
02:25:36,880 --> 02:25:41,880
you're going to have to talk your way 
out of it as if you're talking to the 

3448
02:25:41,880 --> 02:25:41,880
person.
Okay?

3449
02:25:41,880 --> 02:25:42,380
All right.
Um,

3450
02:25:43,810 --> 02:25:46,360
are you go to the doctor's office and 
uh,

3451
02:25:46,390 --> 02:25:48,670
he's gonna,
he's gonna check you out.

3452
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:49,900
So,
um,

3453
02:25:50,230 --> 02:25:52,600
he bends you over the table and then you
go.

3454
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:53,450
He says,
oh,

3455
02:25:53,870 --> 02:25:55,570
I forgot the rubber gloves.
He walks out.

3456
02:25:55,960 --> 02:25:57,610
You notice that the medicine cabinets 
open,

3457
02:25:57,611 --> 02:25:59,350
you reach and you find a bottle of 
Vicodin.

3458
02:25:59,530 --> 02:26:02,350
You see it as he's coming in,
he's going to bust you.

3459
02:26:02,351 --> 02:26:04,390
You take it,
you stick it up your ass to hide it.

3460
02:26:05,050 --> 02:26:07,410
The doctors spreads your cheeks.
He wants to look at you.

3461
02:26:09,190 --> 02:26:14,190
Look at your colon because his finger 
and he pulls out the bottle of Igon and 

3462
02:26:14,410 --> 02:26:15,080
talk your way out.

3463
02:26:15,770 --> 02:26:20,770
Oh,
that's where that was the word by words.

3464
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:24,640
It's all,
you're in the clear,

3465
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:26,740
oh,
that's where it is.

3466
02:26:28,730 --> 02:26:33,730
Thanking them thinking maybe.
But usually it takes like two minutes.

3467
02:26:35,900 --> 02:26:40,040
People talk around it.
They described you average five words.

3468
02:26:40,340 --> 02:26:42,300
Just go right for C'mon man.
You can't,

3469
02:26:42,520 --> 02:26:45,740
you're already busted guy.
Found a bottle up your ass.

3470
02:26:45,741 --> 02:26:47,070
You're a freak.
I did that.

3471
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:49,320
I did that too.
Not that particular one.

3472
02:26:49,321 --> 02:26:54,321
I thought of [inaudible].
My last show was with Natasha and I did 

3473
02:26:54,321 --> 02:26:57,351
that to her,
but it was in her pussy and she had her 

3474
02:26:57,351 --> 02:26:57,351
feet in the stirrups and she goes,
oh,

3475
02:26:57,351 --> 02:26:57,780
I was just tightening that for you.

3476
02:27:02,800 --> 02:27:04,500
Yeah.
But,

3477
02:27:04,501 --> 02:27:05,620
um,
yeah.

3478
02:27:05,621 --> 02:27:07,140
So,
um,

3479
02:27:08,710 --> 02:27:09,700
fuck.
This is great.

3480
02:27:10,270 --> 02:27:15,270
This is great.
I just forgot we were talking about it 

3481
02:27:15,270 --> 02:27:15,270
doesn't matter.
Oh yeah.

3482
02:27:15,270 --> 02:27:18,210
Those touches closer.
You're talking about and push you 

3483
02:27:18,210 --> 02:27:19,330
through to be fucking with you son.
Jesus.

3484
02:27:19,331 --> 02:27:20,290
That's what it is.
That image,

3485
02:27:20,291 --> 02:27:22,720
the image of her in her underwear.
What's your image right now?

3486
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:24,520
When you jerk off?
What's your scenario?

3487
02:27:24,610 --> 02:27:26,620
That works?
Um,

3488
02:27:26,710 --> 02:27:29,950
it's variable changes go through 
streaks.

3489
02:27:29,980 --> 02:27:31,670
One particular thing or another.
I stay.

3490
02:27:31,680 --> 02:27:36,680
I tried to stay away from porn when I 
first had kids just because of the idea 

3491
02:27:36,680 --> 02:27:38,350
of the daughter that would eventually 
become someone that's someone's baby,

3492
02:27:38,910 --> 02:27:40,140
but you know,
I can't fix it.

3493
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:40,870
It is what?
It is.

3494
02:27:41,110 --> 02:27:42,940
A Dick.
Yeah.

3495
02:27:42,941 --> 02:27:44,210
Yeah.
Who Do you want?

3496
02:27:44,420 --> 02:27:45,360
What's your,
what you're saying?

3497
02:27:45,380 --> 02:27:50,380
I don't have.
You don't go to like categories and 

3498
02:27:50,380 --> 02:27:50,830
picked just what's crazy.
It looks hot.

3499
02:27:51,060 --> 02:27:52,900
Whatever's nuts.
Yeah.

3500
02:27:52,901 --> 02:27:55,840
I used to have like types,
but I'm going to have types in your,

3501
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:59,350
you never know,
just click around with it now.

3502
02:27:59,410 --> 02:28:01,030
I can't,
I can't watch Asian porn anymore.

3503
02:28:01,600 --> 02:28:06,600
I watch too much of it.
And then I started to feel like when I 

3504
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:06,880
saw Asian women,
you know,

3505
02:28:07,740 --> 02:28:08,590
in the,
in the,

3506
02:28:08,591 --> 02:28:09,940
uh,
real world,

3507
02:28:10,360 --> 02:28:15,360
I started to feel weird like,
like I want to apologize for being off 

3508
02:28:15,800 --> 02:28:18,360
someone on a steady diet of Asians,
Asian,

3509
02:28:19,240 --> 02:28:21,660
cause I didn't get any when I was young 
and I got before I,

3510
02:28:21,670 --> 02:28:22,010
you know,
I

3511
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:25,910
used to date a lot of black women and I 
dated a couple of Tina women and I never

3512
02:28:25,911 --> 02:28:28,490
dated an Asian women and I find them 
just absolutely.

3513
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:30,330
They're so beautiful and they're

3514
02:28:30,370 --> 02:28:32,410
their feet,
if such cute little feet,

3515
02:28:32,800 --> 02:28:35,170
you would have loved Japan.
Japan.

3516
02:28:35,171 --> 02:28:40,171
They're so friendly.
So friendly.

3517
02:28:40,840 --> 02:28:45,840
Yeah.
Brian and I were just talking about the 

3518
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:45,840
other day when we got back,
we were just there together for the UFC.

3519
02:28:45,840 --> 02:28:46,280
Now are you married,
Brian?

3520
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:49,940
So you get to experience a girlfriend?
I have a girlfriend.

3521
02:28:50,260 --> 02:28:50,560
Yeah.

3522
02:28:53,810 --> 02:28:54,530
Good,
good.

3523
02:28:54,531 --> 02:28:54,920
Tell,

3524
02:28:55,400 --> 02:28:56,580
um,
the,

3525
02:28:56,620 --> 02:29:01,620
the beauty of the culture is the 
politeness and the women are so polite 

3526
02:29:01,620 --> 02:29:02,090
as well.
Men are simple.

3527
02:29:02,150 --> 02:29:04,110
Everyone's so polite in restaurants and 
bars.

3528
02:29:04,111 --> 02:29:05,340
Everywhere you go,
everyone,

3529
02:29:05,341 --> 02:29:08,490
like when people run into people on the 
street,

3530
02:29:08,491 --> 02:29:10,140
like everyone's just like,
there's there.

3531
02:29:10,170 --> 02:29:12,660
They're so polite.
It's a completely different culture than

3532
02:29:12,661 --> 02:29:13,380
ours.
Really.

3533
02:29:13,381 --> 02:29:18,381
Fascinating.
It almost literally truly is like an 

3534
02:29:18,381 --> 02:29:21,741
alien world.
Like you land in a world where 

3535
02:29:21,741 --> 02:29:23,550
everybody's just polite.
The language is totally different.

3536
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:25,530
The people all like,
you know,

3537
02:29:25,590 --> 02:29:27,660
they look Japanese,
the universally look Japanese,

3538
02:29:27,670 --> 02:29:29,700
Japanese do.
It's amazing.

3539
02:29:29,701 --> 02:29:33,540
So you're in this new place where 
everyone behaves super polite,

3540
02:29:33,630 --> 02:29:36,150
very orderly.
Like when they had the tsunamis and they

3541
02:29:36,151 --> 02:29:39,450
were giving out aid,
people just waited patiently,

3542
02:29:39,451 --> 02:29:41,350
politely disciplined,
you know,

3543
02:29:41,351 --> 02:29:42,330
I mean,
he,

3544
02:29:42,331 --> 02:29:46,530
the driver was really interesting.
We had a really cool driver and he spoke

3545
02:29:46,531 --> 02:29:47,430
very good English two.

3546
02:29:47,700 --> 02:29:50,340
And one of the things he said was about 
the,

3547
02:29:50,530 --> 02:29:53,370
the deal,
the deal with Radiation Fukushima,

3548
02:29:53,470 --> 02:29:56,340
that a lot of people are sick and the 
government lies about it.

3549
02:29:56,640 --> 02:29:58,090
And he was like,
well,

3550
02:29:58,200 --> 02:30:00,600
the problem is that we trust the 
government,

3551
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:02,280
the God we don't.
They don't,

3552
02:30:02,510 --> 02:30:05,370
they're not in the rising up and 
questioning the government.

3553
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:08,130
People are into the trust.
The government,

3554
02:30:08,131 --> 02:30:13,131
the government has their best interest 
and then they keep their eyes on their 

3555
02:30:13,131 --> 02:30:13,131
own business and they do what they have 
to do.

3556
02:30:13,131 --> 02:30:15,180
So there's not a lot of like,
this mother fucker go.

3557
02:30:15,290 --> 02:30:16,980
We tell him to take this motherfucker 
down.

3558
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:19,560
There's none of that.
They're not there.

3559
02:30:19,610 --> 02:30:22,860
It's politeness and not,
not subservient.

3560
02:30:22,861 --> 02:30:23,970
See.
But knowing your place,

3561
02:30:23,980 --> 02:30:26,030
discipline,
respect,

3562
02:30:26,310 --> 02:30:28,000
you know,
you never tried a community.

3563
02:30:28,150 --> 02:30:30,090
You don't,
don't try to do better than your boss.

3564
02:30:30,091 --> 02:30:31,670
You don't try to do better in your box.
Yeah.

3565
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:36,920
Callan was telling me that when you.
There's etiquette as far as businessmen 

3566
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:39,330
and like say if your boss orders a 
certain type of Scotch,

3567
02:30:39,331 --> 02:30:41,610
like a very expensive old scotch,
you don't order that.

3568
02:30:41,700 --> 02:30:44,460
You order newer,
cheaper scotch and you order.

3569
02:30:44,490 --> 02:30:45,570
You don't order what he ordered.

3570
02:30:45,690 --> 02:30:47,970
Yeah.
And a bow is based on that.

3571
02:30:47,971 --> 02:30:52,971
Also.
Do you bow lower to somebody who's 

3572
02:30:52,971 --> 02:30:52,971
superior?
Good question.

3573
02:30:52,971 --> 02:30:53,340
Yeah.
The lower you are,

3574
02:30:53,341 --> 02:30:58,341
the lower your bmi under that person,
so like that's why you can get in a 

3575
02:30:58,341 --> 02:31:01,170
fight with somebody if they think that 
they are lower than you and that's where

3576
02:31:01,171 --> 02:31:04,000
it's like back and forth,
rams on.

3577
02:31:04,070 --> 02:31:09,070
You're sucking your own Dick.
He knows what's up guys.

3578
02:31:10,120 --> 02:31:12,460
You know you're losing the bowel 
contents when you sucking.

3579
02:31:12,500 --> 02:31:17,500
Don't pee pee or something,
you know you're underneath somebody when

3580
02:31:18,861 --> 02:31:20,550
you're looking at the guy behind you.

3581
02:31:21,250 --> 02:31:26,250
Do you remember when one of the funniest
things about doing the road was like 

3582
02:31:26,250 --> 02:31:29,701
working with black comics because if 
black comics were supposed to be the 

3583
02:31:29,701 --> 02:31:34,470
Middle Act,
they always had heard from the book or 

3584
02:31:34,470 --> 02:31:34,470
that there was supposed to be the 
headliner.

3585
02:31:34,470 --> 02:31:38,750
If there was two other black acts,
there will always go up first I believe,

3586
02:31:38,751 --> 02:31:43,751
and I got another gig because they all 
wanted to do like some of the same 

3587
02:31:43,751 --> 02:31:44,030
references.
Like with road hacks,

3588
02:31:44,180 --> 02:31:49,180
there's like,
like black road hacks had so many stock 

3589
02:31:49,180 --> 02:31:49,940
jokes.
There was so much.

3590
02:31:49,941 --> 02:31:52,310
Like I haven't seen this many white 
people since my trial

3591
02:31:52,760 --> 02:31:57,760
at what am I,
what am I the only chocolate chip and a 

3592
02:31:57,760 --> 02:31:58,270
cookie tonight times.
Have you heard that?

3593
02:31:58,300 --> 02:32:03,300
Or the fame or the fat guy who takes the
mic stand moves and let me get that out 

3594
02:32:03,300 --> 02:32:04,120
of the way so you can see me.
Applause.

3595
02:32:04,130 --> 02:32:04,970
Laughter.

3596
02:32:05,380 --> 02:32:09,880
That was a thing about Boston was that 
Boston did not tolerate hacks.

3597
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:15,000
We were so lucky that we came up in a in
a time where that shit was ridiculed 

3598
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:16,870
when we would go on the road and we 
would work with

3599
02:32:18,150 --> 02:32:22,560
you guys.
Fucking look at what you fucking act.

3600
02:32:22,561 --> 02:32:23,610
Yep.
Look what you're.

3601
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:28,700
And then when you go to New York,
when your boss to comic and you go down 

3602
02:32:28,700 --> 02:32:28,700
in New York,
all of a sudden they're like,

3603
02:32:28,700 --> 02:32:29,130
fuck man,
you're good.

3604
02:32:29,131 --> 02:32:29,940
It's like,
yeah,

3605
02:32:29,941 --> 02:32:32,020
because we had to be different,
you know,

3606
02:32:32,070 --> 02:32:35,520
and you had to not be happy,
but the further you travel from Boston,

3607
02:32:35,790 --> 02:32:36,900
the more,
like you said,

3608
02:32:37,290 --> 02:32:39,930
use your bit.
Maybe do the guy comes in late.

3609
02:32:40,090 --> 02:32:41,490
What do you say when the guy comes in 
late?

3610
02:32:41,491 --> 02:32:42,840
Ya.
Oh,

3611
02:32:43,550 --> 02:32:45,300
I don't remember.
Can I get you anything?

3612
02:32:45,690 --> 02:32:47,760
Like a fucking clock?
Yeah.

3613
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,030
Every time.
And it's applause break every.

3614
02:32:50,190 --> 02:32:53,880
You had like those savers and you 
wouldn't dare do that Shit in Boston,

3615
02:32:54,070 --> 02:32:57,650
but if you were up in Maine race to who 
can do that first?

3616
02:32:57,670 --> 02:32:58,630
Hey,
I don't come to your job.

3617
02:32:58,720 --> 02:32:59,920
Slap the digs out of your mouth.

3618
02:33:01,250 --> 02:33:01,790
That was a

3619
02:33:02,220 --> 02:33:07,220
jim in your pocket.
There was a lot of tools that we had 

3620
02:33:07,220 --> 02:33:10,071
like especially as young scrubs.
It's almost like what you had was a 

3621
02:33:10,071 --> 02:33:11,700
scaffolding that allowed you to put 
together your little comedy

3622
02:33:12,790 --> 02:33:15,540
really didn't have the structure to do 
it on its own on its own.

3623
02:33:15,541 --> 02:33:17,440
It wouldn't hold up.
So you had it.

3624
02:33:17,560 --> 02:33:19,950
So I'm saying the guys in the background
going,

3625
02:33:19,951 --> 02:33:23,760
I've fucked your mother and I'm like,
Dad,

3626
02:33:23,910 --> 02:33:27,510
no one cares.
And the guys and the other comics in the

3627
02:33:27,511 --> 02:33:28,650
back,
crossing it off.

3628
02:33:29,020 --> 02:33:29,270
That one.

3629
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:29,950
Napa.

3630
02:33:33,100 --> 02:33:38,100
Do you remember those normal?
A full gigs js and Pittsfield and Oh my 

3631
02:33:38,750 --> 02:33:43,750
God.
It was like I'd never been to western 

3632
02:33:43,750 --> 02:33:46,061
Massachusetts and you would just get on 
the mass pike and he'd get off some 

3633
02:33:46,061 --> 02:33:49,151
exit.
Just a number with woods around it and 

3634
02:33:49,151 --> 02:33:49,890
then you drive for another 45 minutes.
Then you get to a normal phone,

3635
02:33:50,220 --> 02:33:54,510
western Massachusetts as a trip.
That's why Umass Boston or Umass amherst

3636
02:33:54,511 --> 02:33:55,500
rather.
So beautiful.

3637
02:33:55,830 --> 02:33:57,660
That amherst town.
It's amazing.

3638
02:33:57,940 --> 02:34:01,140
It's really cool.
Fucking town in the middle of nowhere in

3639
02:34:01,141 --> 02:34:04,110
western Massachusetts and there's so 
many towns like that where it's like,

3640
02:34:04,111 --> 02:34:06,180
what has brought the town together is 
essentially

3641
02:34:06,420 --> 02:34:08,500
college and stayed.
Yeah.

3642
02:34:08,501 --> 02:34:12,920
You go to Madison,
Wisconsin.

3643
02:34:12,950 --> 02:34:13,790
Yeah.
Yeah,

3644
02:34:13,800 --> 02:34:15,540
exactly.
I think in Nebraska,

3645
02:34:15,570 --> 02:34:16,560
boulder,
Colorado,

3646
02:34:16,930 --> 02:34:18,570
it was a lot of places like that.
But yeah,

3647
02:34:18,590 --> 02:34:20,440
that's why I always think like,
you know,

3648
02:34:20,520 --> 02:34:25,520
um,
I really would like to teach at some 

3649
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:26,110
point I was thinking back,
cool college town.

3650
02:34:26,300 --> 02:34:28,600
Um,
I would like to teach comedy.

3651
02:34:28,601 --> 02:34:30,010
I'd like to teach like,
you know,

3652
02:34:30,011 --> 02:34:32,050
um,
all aspects of it,

3653
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:34,840
you know,
comic history method.

3654
02:34:34,890 --> 02:34:39,440
Yeah.
Essentially in a phd in standup master.

3655
02:34:39,640 --> 02:34:42,220
I mean I've written it on sitcoms.
I've written it on late night.

3656
02:34:42,221 --> 02:34:46,930
I've written sketches.
I've done stand up for me.

3657
02:34:47,780 --> 02:34:49,780
Yeah.
So talk shows or.

3658
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:52,180
Yeah,
I bought a Alan Generous to,

3659
02:34:52,181 --> 02:34:55,140
for producing in two for writing and 
then I won a,

3660
02:34:55,460 --> 02:34:56,350
a,
I want a,

3661
02:34:56,351 --> 02:34:57,880
I'm,
what the fuck was it called?

3662
02:34:58,420 --> 02:35:01,600
Ace Award for you and Ellen besties.
Oh fuck.

3663
02:35:01,601 --> 02:35:03,610
She just called me.
God dammit.

3664
02:35:03,790 --> 02:35:05,110
I got to call that bitch back.

3665
02:35:07,060 --> 02:35:07,610
No,
no,

3666
02:35:07,850 --> 02:35:09,440
no,
we're not IBM.

3667
02:35:09,450 --> 02:35:11,070
We're nothing.
Did you ever kiss her on the lips?

3668
02:35:11,130 --> 02:35:12,530
I did.
Did you?

3669
02:35:12,630 --> 02:35:14,460
Did you ever wonder would it be like to 
make love to her?

3670
02:35:14,520 --> 02:35:15,930
Yes.
Really just thinking about that.

3671
02:35:15,931 --> 02:35:16,830
Like,
that's got to be weird.

3672
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:22,200
Um,
well I think if you put me in an office 

3673
02:35:22,200 --> 02:35:22,200
with a number of women by the end of the
week,

3674
02:35:22,200 --> 02:35:26,140
I will have imagined each of them.
Did you ever see her Mac?

3675
02:35:26,440 --> 02:35:27,180
You ever see her?
Put her,

3676
02:35:27,250 --> 02:35:31,690
put her girl Mac down.
Last time I talked about this,

3677
02:35:31,691 --> 02:35:34,170
I got a call from a lawyer.
Yeah.

3678
02:35:34,330 --> 02:35:35,070
Really?
Yeah.

3679
02:35:35,071 --> 02:35:35,970
I can't talk.
Wow.

3680
02:35:36,220 --> 02:35:41,220
Oh,
did you sign a nondisclosure when you 

3681
02:35:41,220 --> 02:35:41,220
work there?
Oh,

3682
02:35:41,220 --> 02:35:41,220
you shouldn't be talking to me right 
now.

3683
02:35:41,220 --> 02:35:41,760
She's an awesome person.
Right?

3684
02:35:41,980 --> 02:35:46,980
I love her.
Love her to show love everything about 

3685
02:35:46,980 --> 02:35:46,980
it.
You know,

3686
02:35:46,980 --> 02:35:47,720
it's wild.
I saw her on one of those hp,

3687
02:35:47,721 --> 02:35:52,721
a young comedian specials.
They plan on hbo now or have you seen 

3688
02:35:52,721 --> 02:35:52,721
him?
Yeah,

3689
02:35:52,721 --> 02:35:52,900
it's fucking great,
isn't it?

3690
02:35:53,350 --> 02:35:57,160
It's like I saw her in these balloony 
fucking like joy,

3691
02:35:57,161 --> 02:36:00,130
but a fuko pants and the shirt and uh,
and the,

3692
02:36:00,400 --> 02:36:02,110
and the mullet.
And then he said like,

3693
02:36:02,111 --> 02:36:04,120
Jerry Seinfeld,
come on and he's like,

3694
02:36:04,130 --> 02:36:07,360
looks like he's fucking 11 years old.
I love watching.

3695
02:36:07,880 --> 02:36:08,630
No,
that's a good one,

3696
02:36:08,631 --> 02:36:13,631
man.
I just wonder what ever happened to the 

3697
02:36:13,631 --> 02:36:13,631
gun?
Rick Ducommun.

3698
02:36:13,631 --> 02:36:13,631
Oh God,
yeah.

3699
02:36:13,631 --> 02:36:14,880
Rick Ducommun was fucking on him.
Yeah.

3700
02:36:14,881 --> 02:36:16,640
Yeah.
He had some good shit.

3701
02:36:16,700 --> 02:36:17,960
Yeah,
he was.

3702
02:36:18,030 --> 02:36:20,810
It was always angry at everything,
but it was a different kind of anger.

3703
02:36:20,811 --> 02:36:22,700
He was like,
he leaves the microphone in the stand.

3704
02:36:22,701 --> 02:36:25,610
I remember that because like,
all my guys like my favorite comics,

3705
02:36:25,611 --> 02:36:29,840
like prior kinison and George Carlin,
they always carried the microphone,

3706
02:36:30,170 --> 02:36:31,460
but he would leave in the stand.
I was like,

3707
02:36:31,461 --> 02:36:33,170
wow,
she's angry with it in a stand.

3708
02:36:33,171 --> 02:36:34,490
This is a new approach.
Yeah.

3709
02:36:34,491 --> 02:36:35,960
Yeah.
He was a funny guy,

3710
02:36:35,961 --> 02:36:37,010
man.
I always wondered like,

3711
02:36:37,011 --> 02:36:40,340
there's always a few guys,
like they were really funny at one point

3712
02:36:40,341 --> 02:36:41,090
in time.
Then you're like,

3713
02:36:41,120 --> 02:36:41,870
where's that guy

3714
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:43,970
will happen,
but you know,

3715
02:36:43,971 --> 02:36:48,971
as cool as like Dana Gould,
to me it was like that when he was 

3716
02:36:48,971 --> 02:36:48,971
young,
I was like,

3717
02:36:48,971 --> 02:36:48,971
fuck,
there's nobody funnier than this guy.

3718
02:36:48,980 --> 02:36:51,360
And then he went off to write for the 
simpsons and you know,

3719
02:36:51,390 --> 02:36:53,990
cat casual friends with.
I'm much better friends with him now,

3720
02:36:54,180 --> 02:36:59,180
didn't see him for years,
and then all of a sudden he came back 

3721
02:36:59,180 --> 02:36:59,900
with a vengeance and now he's like 
phenomenal again,

3722
02:36:59,901 --> 02:37:01,820
but in a totally different way.
I watched him,

3723
02:37:01,821 --> 02:37:04,010
one of his first sets back,
he still had it,

3724
02:37:04,011 --> 02:37:09,011
but it was weird watching the guy put 
together a new app and they lacked and 

3725
02:37:09,011 --> 02:37:09,490
though he clearly knew how to do 
standup,

3726
02:37:09,500 --> 02:37:11,890
but it was like you could see him doing 
it going like,

3727
02:37:11,920 --> 02:37:12,510
wow,
this is.

3728
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:14,330
It was really kind of interesting.
Yeah.

3729
02:37:14,331 --> 02:37:14,720
Yeah.
Well,

3730
02:37:14,721 --> 02:37:16,100
it's like with Chris rock every

3731
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:16,550
time,
man,

3732
02:37:16,551 --> 02:37:18,470
when he stuck.
Here's the thing about Chris Rock,

3733
02:37:18,500 --> 02:37:21,500
you got like Dave Chappelle who I think 
came out of the womb,

3734
02:37:21,501 --> 02:37:26,501
grabbed the mic and was funny,
and then you got Chris Rock who's a guy 

3735
02:37:26,501 --> 02:37:29,531
when,
I don't know if you've seen him when he 

3736
02:37:29,531 --> 02:37:29,531
starts out,
it's fucking painful.

3737
02:37:29,531 --> 02:37:29,531
He was

3738
02:37:29,531 --> 02:37:33,860
him getting ideas and not knowing where 
they're going and trudge it out on stage

3739
02:37:35,131 --> 02:37:36,270
and not have it work at all.

3740
02:37:36,290 --> 02:37:37,230
No,
I mean he,

3741
02:37:37,231 --> 02:37:40,850
he's a guy who I think is obviously 
extremely funny,

3742
02:37:41,240 --> 02:37:45,190
but at the same time I think he's 
cerebral funny where he,

3743
02:37:45,191 --> 02:37:46,940
he thinks about it,
he writes it,

3744
02:37:46,941 --> 02:37:51,941
he rewrites it,
he works hard and then he comes up with 

3745
02:37:51,941 --> 02:37:51,941
an hour like his is bigger and blacker 
is it?

3746
02:37:51,941 --> 02:37:53,500
Was that what it's called?
I mean,

3747
02:37:53,660 --> 02:37:55,690
I'd put it against any hour of stand up 
ever,

3748
02:37:56,430 --> 02:37:59,590
but,
but the way people get there is a,

3749
02:37:59,650 --> 02:38:00,290
you know,
it's,

3750
02:38:00,291 --> 02:38:02,600
it's fucking different for everybody and
uh,

3751
02:38:03,050 --> 02:38:08,050
you know,
I think seeing somebody start to finish 

3752
02:38:08,050 --> 02:38:08,840
that,
that to me is a great tv show.

3753
02:38:08,841 --> 02:38:11,630
I'd like to see something on comedy 
central where you watch,

3754
02:38:11,780 --> 02:38:16,780
you know,
put the cameras on four or five comics 

3755
02:38:16,780 --> 02:38:17,530
for the remodel and watch them develop,
you know,

3756
02:38:17,540 --> 02:38:22,540
interesting comic,
different styles and watch them right 

3757
02:38:22,540 --> 02:38:22,540
home,
rewrite

3758
02:38:22,540 --> 02:38:23,310
different show.
Dude,

3759
02:38:23,311 --> 02:38:24,660
you should pitch that.
You know,

3760
02:38:24,661 --> 02:38:29,661
the.
The thing is though that very few guys 

3761
02:38:29,661 --> 02:38:29,661
actually put together an act like Louis 
does every year.

3762
02:38:29,790 --> 02:38:34,790
Like to have people do it like that,
but if you force comics to do it for a 

3763
02:38:34,790 --> 02:38:35,070
show that's good.
At the end of it,

3764
02:38:35,071 --> 02:38:37,620
you do a special and the end of it,
they all do a half an hour.

3765
02:38:37,621 --> 02:38:39,000
It's an hour and a half specially if 
fall.

3766
02:38:39,001 --> 02:38:42,750
Three comics over the course of a year 
and over that or six months,

3767
02:38:42,770 --> 02:38:44,640
say six months for 30 minutes of 
material.

3768
02:38:44,641 --> 02:38:46,200
That's like,
that's plenty of time.

3769
02:38:46,230 --> 02:38:47,520
That's fair.
Yeah.

3770
02:38:47,521 --> 02:38:52,521
You know what really,
you could probably do it in three 

3771
02:38:52,521 --> 02:38:52,521
months.

3772
02:38:52,521 --> 02:38:52,930
I think you got to do three because 
that'd be tough.

3773
02:38:52,931 --> 02:38:54,640
I get it right.

3774
02:38:54,730 --> 02:38:55,690
Well,
unless you could come,

3775
02:38:55,720 --> 02:39:00,720
I mean you could pace it out where you 
come to them like once every couple 

3776
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:02,120
weeks or something to people.
Yeah.

3777
02:39:02,260 --> 02:39:04,780
And I wonder if there's a three.
You follow three,

3778
02:39:04,781 --> 02:39:09,781
but you fall,
you really follow six and use the best 

3779
02:39:09,781 --> 02:39:09,781
three,

3780
02:39:09,781 --> 02:39:09,781
right?
Yeah.

3781
02:39:09,781 --> 02:39:13,171
And I think there's a awesome.
Maybe you front load it with like they 

3782
02:39:13,171 --> 02:39:16,471
each have to get topics,
a sign if you want to make kind of a 

3783
02:39:16,471 --> 02:39:18,320
reality show that paid off with,
you know,

3784
02:39:18,430 --> 02:39:20,560
this new 15 minutes.
But you know,

3785
02:39:20,590 --> 02:39:22,900
just to keep it honest,
they have to start.

3786
02:39:23,230 --> 02:39:28,230
I don't know if they all start with the 
same topics or they draw from a hat for 

3787
02:39:28,230 --> 02:39:28,550
topics.
Something to give it like,

3788
02:39:28,750 --> 02:39:33,750
yeah,
some like real last comic standing shit 

3789
02:39:33,750 --> 02:39:36,931
because you know what I didn't like 
about last comic standing when they 

3790
02:39:36,931 --> 02:39:38,080
forced those guys to start auditioning 
in front of two judges,

3791
02:39:38,500 --> 02:39:41,590
do their act like what the fuck is that?
That's not even stand up.

3792
02:39:41,920 --> 02:39:43,990
If you really want to watch them do 
standup,

3793
02:39:43,991 --> 02:39:46,240
go watch them do fucking stand.
You're making a guide.

3794
02:39:46,241 --> 02:39:48,130
Tell jokes to you.
Give him some dignity.

3795
02:39:48,160 --> 02:39:49,690
Yeah.
And you're trying to do this whole,

3796
02:39:49,691 --> 02:39:50,420
uh,
the,

3797
02:39:50,460 --> 02:39:53,260
what's his name from um,
the,

3798
02:39:53,410 --> 02:39:54,430
the,
the English,

3799
02:39:55,200 --> 02:39:56,560
the English guy,
star search,

3800
02:39:56,561 --> 02:39:57,390
Simon,
Simon,

3801
02:39:57,430 --> 02:39:58,570
Simon,
Simon.

3802
02:39:58,571 --> 02:40:00,490
Callow bullshit.
They're like trying to be like,

3803
02:40:00,890 --> 02:40:05,350
please enough.
That joke is never going to work.

3804
02:40:05,590 --> 02:40:05,970
You know,
they're,

3805
02:40:05,971 --> 02:40:06,450
they're,
they're,

3806
02:40:06,451 --> 02:40:08,820
they're doing this like harsh judgment 
thing because there's a lot.

3807
02:40:09,050 --> 02:40:10,690
That's what a lot of people like,
you know,

3808
02:40:10,691 --> 02:40:11,830
I don't,
I don't think that's the way to.

3809
02:40:11,890 --> 02:40:13,980
So I think the way to a standup show

3810
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:15,660
is not in front of a live audience like 
that.

3811
02:40:15,661 --> 02:40:18,330
It's in front of a bunch of live on the 
fall guy around.

3812
02:40:18,390 --> 02:40:19,170
Yeah.
Yeah.

3813
02:40:19,180 --> 02:40:20,820
Have a reality show where you've fallen 
standups,

3814
02:40:20,850 --> 02:40:22,500
where they're putting together a 
special.

3815
02:40:22,560 --> 02:40:27,560
And then at the end of the whole thing,
they actually do their special monster 

3816
02:40:27,560 --> 02:40:30,120
live event being at a,
at a good size theater.

3817
02:40:30,121 --> 02:40:32,730
Only problem though is then the people 
are going to know the material.

3818
02:40:32,820 --> 02:40:36,230
So really the best way to do it because 
you're going to coordinate in advanced.

3819
02:40:36,290 --> 02:40:36,770
Yeah.
You,

3820
02:40:36,860 --> 02:40:41,860
you bet.
You bank the whole thing and then you 

3821
02:40:41,860 --> 02:40:41,860
roll it out later.
Yeah,

3822
02:40:41,860 --> 02:40:42,120
you couldn't do it live,
but you could,

3823
02:40:42,180 --> 02:40:47,180
but you could do it that way.
When you watch a live audience respond 

3824
02:40:47,180 --> 02:40:50,781
to that material and you see how that 
guys developed it and you'd really 

3825
02:40:50,781 --> 02:40:53,391
appreciate it as a,
as a person who enjoys the craft of 

3826
02:40:53,391 --> 02:40:53,391
comedy,
you know,

3827
02:40:53,391 --> 02:40:53,391
sucks.
Write it up.

3828
02:40:53,391 --> 02:40:54,510
Let's write it out.
I'm going to pitch it,

3829
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:55,230
what we call it.

3830
02:40:55,670 --> 02:40:56,240
Um,

3831
02:40:58,580 --> 02:41:01,600
common upcoming can comma,
Q,

3832
02:41:01,640 --> 02:41:02,450
how?
Kent area.

3833
02:41:03,560 --> 02:41:08,560
Um,
I think we call it a from scratch comic

3834
02:41:11,170 --> 02:41:12,530
from scratch,
something like that.

3835
02:41:12,550 --> 02:41:17,550
I like that.
I like that because that's essentially 

3836
02:41:17,550 --> 02:41:17,550
what it is.
And then he picked.

3837
02:41:17,550 --> 02:41:19,730
People have really different styles.
Comedy from scratch.

3838
02:41:19,731 --> 02:41:20,720
That's perfect.
You nailed it.

3839
02:41:20,780 --> 02:41:22,480
That's it.
That's the name you get.

3840
02:41:22,720 --> 02:41:25,630
I like,
maybe you get the same five topics.

3841
02:41:25,640 --> 02:41:27,440
You're gonna do 15 minutes on five 
topics.

3842
02:41:27,560 --> 02:41:32,560
Then you get a guy who's a storyteller.
You get a guy who's a setup punchline 

3843
02:41:32,560 --> 02:41:32,560
guy.
You get.

3844
02:41:32,560 --> 02:41:33,180
Yeah,
but you were.

3845
02:41:33,190 --> 02:41:34,970
We're limiting ourselves that we give 
them topics.

3846
02:41:34,971 --> 02:41:37,850
If you just let the guy explore,
then you get to see where he's coming up

3847
02:41:37,851 --> 02:41:42,851
with his material,
but you don't know if he didn't already 

3848
02:41:42,851 --> 02:41:42,851
write it.
I want to make sure they're.

3849
02:41:42,851 --> 02:41:43,370
They're not pulling some old shit out.
That's true.

3850
02:41:43,420 --> 02:41:45,440
Plus it'd be all come jokes.
That's true.

3851
02:41:45,880 --> 02:41:46,580
Well,
you know what?

3852
02:41:46,600 --> 02:41:48,860
We know when you disqualify them from 
the show,

3853
02:41:48,861 --> 02:41:50,060
if they do say,
listen man,

3854
02:41:50,061 --> 02:41:51,140
you can't lie about this.

3855
02:41:51,140 --> 02:41:52,940
If we find out you're lying about this,
you're fucked.

3856
02:41:53,330 --> 02:41:54,310
We want,
you know,

3857
02:41:54,340 --> 02:41:59,340
we want all new material.
I still feel like it needs a starting 

3858
02:41:59,451 --> 02:42:01,240
point.
It needs like a crisp,

3859
02:42:01,241 --> 02:42:01,920
like,
okay,

3860
02:42:02,310 --> 02:42:03,980
how about maybe,
how about this?

3861
02:42:04,010 --> 02:42:06,110
Maybe there's,
there's three comics,

3862
02:42:06,111 --> 02:42:09,200
right?
We want them to have five new topics.

3863
02:42:09,260 --> 02:42:14,260
Each one has five new top,
but assign them five topics that may 

3864
02:42:14,260 --> 02:42:17,241
come up with material,
but they have like a fucking big wheel 

3865
02:42:17,241 --> 02:42:17,241
and they have to reach in and pull the 
topics out.

3866
02:42:17,241 --> 02:42:17,840
Yeah,
that's good.

3867
02:42:17,900 --> 02:42:22,900
Yeah.
Like we spin the wheel and your reach 

3868
02:42:22,900 --> 02:42:22,900
in,
what's your first topic?

3869
02:42:22,900 --> 02:42:23,870
Marriage Shit.
Yeah.

3870
02:42:24,020 --> 02:42:26,690
And then there's also the pitfalls of 
hackery,

3871
02:42:26,870 --> 02:42:28,320
like how do you avoid,
you know,

3872
02:42:28,321 --> 02:42:33,321
like this subject's been dumped your,
you have to do a joke about women's 

3873
02:42:33,321 --> 02:42:33,321
tampons.
I'm sorry.

3874
02:42:33,321 --> 02:42:37,090
Yeah.
You know that Jesus Christ do a joke 

3875
02:42:37,090 --> 02:42:37,110
about buying women's tampons.
Is that what you're going to do?

3876
02:42:37,111 --> 02:42:39,560
A price check price check tampons.
Aisle five.

3877
02:42:40,610 --> 02:42:41,380
I mean,
is that,

3878
02:42:42,740 --> 02:42:44,480
how can you avoid the.
Yeah.

3879
02:42:44,870 --> 02:42:47,240
Well let's play it right now.
I'll give you a topic.

3880
02:42:47,270 --> 02:42:49,010
You do a joke.
You've given me a topic.

3881
02:42:49,100 --> 02:42:50,990
We'll play three rounds.
All right.

3882
02:42:51,020 --> 02:42:52,720
I'm going to start.
Um,

3883
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:58,120
and they.
And they should be hackey premise just 

3884
02:42:58,120 --> 02:42:58,940
to prove that you don't have to do it.
I'm kittens.

3885
02:42:59,720 --> 02:43:01,610
I fucked him.
Oh,

3886
02:43:01,850 --> 02:43:04,640
come came.
Oh,

3887
02:43:05,860 --> 02:43:07,730
big fat.
Fucking ace.

3888
02:43:14,310 --> 02:43:15,560
Yeah.
Uh,

3889
02:43:15,610 --> 02:43:19,270
I'm,
I'm midlife crisis cars.

3890
02:43:21,070 --> 02:43:26,070
If you buy a prius you might as well 
just put a white flag and your balls 

3891
02:43:26,070 --> 02:43:26,800
hanging from the antenna because it's 
over.

3892
02:43:27,090 --> 02:43:32,090
Greg actually bought a prius because we 
were having a conversation before he 

3893
02:43:32,090 --> 02:43:32,090
goes,
I go,

3894
02:43:32,090 --> 02:43:32,950
I go,
please tell me this is your Prius.

3895
02:43:32,951 --> 02:43:33,540
He goes,
yes.

3896
02:43:33,610 --> 02:43:38,610
It no idea what Venice mobile living in 
Venice and the worst thing is is I still

3897
02:43:40,661 --> 02:43:45,661
fucking.
I still have driving rage and I cut 

3898
02:43:45,661 --> 02:43:47,701
people off and the weird thing is 
there's a button on your dashboard on 

3899
02:43:47,701 --> 02:43:51,700
the new Prius where it takes all the 
electrical shit out and it's just a fast

3900
02:43:51,880 --> 02:43:56,880
light little Toyota and you go really 
fast and you get no gas mileage and 

3901
02:43:56,880 --> 02:44:00,991
that's how I drive all the time.
They did a thing on top gear where they 

3902
02:44:00,991 --> 02:44:04,621
had a prius and an m three and they sent
them around a race track and the 

3903
02:44:04,621 --> 02:44:07,300
[inaudible] actually ate less gas than 
the Prius did when it was driving around

3904
02:44:07,630 --> 02:44:08,740
meant for around town.

3905
02:44:08,740 --> 02:44:11,220
That's where you save the gas.
Now when I'm dropping,

3906
02:44:11,230 --> 02:44:16,230
go my fucking Florence,
but what he wanted with Greg really 

3907
02:44:16,230 --> 02:44:19,340
wanted was a one of those spiffy new 
dodge challenger was awesome.

3908
02:44:19,390 --> 02:44:21,190
The hammies.
Those cars are awesome.

3909
02:44:21,810 --> 02:44:25,030
They sound good.
They fucking look great.

3910
02:44:25,031 --> 02:44:28,660
That shape is satisfying.
I found one and I was looking at it.

3911
02:44:28,661 --> 02:44:33,661
It was a year old.
I got it down to Carmax and I was going 

3912
02:44:33,661 --> 02:44:36,271
to get a flight fucking 24,000
loaded via and then my wife and kids 

3913
02:44:36,551 --> 02:44:37,370
were gone.
Daddy,

3914
02:44:37,371 --> 02:44:40,070
the environment,
you've got to get a prius kind of pushes

3915
02:44:40,080 --> 02:44:41,710
you raise right now.
And I just,

3916
02:44:41,711 --> 02:44:42,240
uh,
I,

3917
02:44:42,370 --> 02:44:46,050
I cave me mom filled with conflict 
minerals.

3918
02:44:46,051 --> 02:44:51,051
Okay.
Prius's have lithium ion batteries to 

3919
02:44:51,051 --> 02:44:53,260
getting those from fucking little kids 
picking up minerals from Congo.

3920
02:44:53,350 --> 02:44:54,570
It's terrible.
Yeah,

3921
02:44:54,600 --> 02:44:55,570
it's,
there's nothing,

3922
02:44:55,780 --> 02:44:59,150
there's nothing good about the way they 
construct those fucking things now.

3923
02:44:59,170 --> 02:45:02,500
Now the only ideas that using less gas 
while you actually use it.

3924
02:45:02,710 --> 02:45:07,710
Yeah.
And what do you do with the batteries 

3925
02:45:07,710 --> 02:45:07,710
when it's done?
It's a,

3926
02:45:07,710 --> 02:45:07,710
I made it.
I made a mistake.

3927
02:45:07,710 --> 02:45:09,700
I made a pretty big mistake.
Motherfuckers kp from a challenger,

3928
02:45:09,701 --> 02:45:14,701
that's a man's car.
I know you can appreciate when you hit 

3929
02:45:14,701 --> 02:45:14,730
that gas and hit the rumble of the Va,
you feel it.

3930
02:45:17,260 --> 02:45:19,660
It's a car.
It's a man's car to man's car.

3931
02:45:19,661 --> 02:45:21,100
And you know,
when I pull up to a red light,

3932
02:45:21,101 --> 02:45:22,900
I'm next to a woman,
I'm married and whatever,

3933
02:45:22,901 --> 02:45:24,520
but I need to be able to look her in the
eye.

3934
02:45:24,521 --> 02:45:26,740
And with the Prius,
your eyes go straight ahead and you just

3935
02:45:26,741 --> 02:45:28,120
keep straight ahead.
Useless.

3936
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:33,300
This girl fucking popped the Zit on the 
side of her face in front of my 

3937
02:45:33,300 --> 02:45:34,060
direction in front of me while I was at 
a red light.

3938
02:45:35,190 --> 02:45:37,480
You're off the menu,
she's looking at a Prius,

3939
02:45:37,490 --> 02:45:42,070
driving a little bit in front of you.
The blood comes out,

3940
02:45:43,170 --> 02:45:46,870
keep squeezing until the blood squirts.
There's certain things you don't want to

3941
02:45:46,871 --> 02:45:48,520
ever see a girl do.
If you're gonna fuck her.

3942
02:45:48,630 --> 02:45:50,610
A zit is one of them.
Take a shit.

3943
02:45:50,611 --> 02:45:51,760
It's another.
You don't.

3944
02:45:51,780 --> 02:45:54,520
Oh no shit around the butthole.
Go Watch them.

3945
02:45:54,521 --> 02:45:55,070
Shit.
I mean,

3946
02:45:55,071 --> 02:45:56,470
not at this point in time,
you know?

3947
02:45:56,540 --> 02:45:57,850
Yeah.
But you know,

3948
02:45:57,851 --> 02:45:59,650
when you're a young man,
I have a friend who,

3949
02:45:59,651 --> 02:46:01,060
uh,
was in love with this chick.

3950
02:46:01,061 --> 02:46:03,000
And he came over her house and he lifted
up the toilet bowl,

3951
02:46:03,040 --> 02:46:05,320
take leak.
There was a floater and he couldn't fuck

3952
02:46:05,321 --> 02:46:05,950
her.
He was like,

3953
02:46:05,951 --> 02:46:08,530
it was done.
It was over.

3954
02:46:09,320 --> 02:46:10,310
It was like 20.

3955
02:46:10,610 --> 02:46:15,610
When you're 40,
you just flush it for then you hope she 

3956
02:46:15,610 --> 02:46:15,610
wiped 20.
She could take a shit.

3957
02:46:15,950 --> 02:46:17,990
I mean,
nothing would stop me.

3958
02:46:19,880 --> 02:46:22,310
Shit on your balls.
Actually,

3959
02:46:22,311 --> 02:46:27,311
that would be a.
Now that now we're going to find that 

3960
02:46:27,311 --> 02:46:27,311
site.
You.

3961
02:46:27,311 --> 02:46:27,410
Have you ever dated a girl that was into
like weird shit,

3962
02:46:27,411 --> 02:46:29,090
like she wanted you to piss on or 
anything crazy?

3963
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:31,370
It was a girl that used to like me to 
choke her and slap her.

3964
02:46:31,480 --> 02:46:33,500
Oh,
I've had a lot of that in my car because

3965
02:46:33,501 --> 02:46:36,050
she was a waitress at a club in Boston.

3966
02:46:36,700 --> 02:46:41,700
I never would do the slapping thing,
but I've choked the fuck out of some 

3967
02:46:41,700 --> 02:46:43,670
jokes from behind or are from all kinds 
of ways.

3968
02:46:44,320 --> 02:46:46,180
I had one girl that wanted to wrestle 
before we fucked,

3969
02:46:46,300 --> 02:46:48,130
would always wrestle,
like push me.

3970
02:46:48,490 --> 02:46:53,490
She would push me.
I'd come over her house and she drew 

3971
02:46:53,490 --> 02:46:53,490
what?
I go,

3972
02:46:53,490 --> 02:46:57,301
what?
And she looks I'm going to fucking 

3973
02:46:57,301 --> 02:46:57,301
wrestle.
Oh are you serious?

3974
02:46:57,301 --> 02:46:57,301
Like,
what are you talking about?

3975
02:46:57,301 --> 02:46:58,120
And she pushed me.
She goes,

3976
02:46:58,121 --> 02:46:58,750
you know,
I'm fucking.

3977
02:46:58,930 --> 02:46:59,680
I'm like,
okay,

3978
02:46:59,681 --> 02:47:01,330
what is going on here?
Like what are you doing?

3979
02:47:01,630 --> 02:47:04,310
And she should go when he's scared,
he's scared getting beaten by a girl and

3980
02:47:04,320 --> 02:47:06,610
then we'd be in this like little wrist 
fight thing.

3981
02:47:06,611 --> 02:47:11,611
Was she grabbing my wrists and shit?
Then I'd have to manhandle her and 

3982
02:47:11,611 --> 02:47:12,370
that's what she wanted.
She wanted to just get dominated.

3983
02:47:12,410 --> 02:47:13,040
Yeah,
yeah,

3984
02:47:13,070 --> 02:47:14,780
I could see that.
Yeah,

3985
02:47:14,930 --> 02:47:15,680
got crazy.
Yeah,

3986
02:47:15,681 --> 02:47:18,370
she would almost what it essentially was
what she wanted to.

3987
02:47:18,440 --> 02:47:22,140
She wanted to get raped by somebody that
she wanted to fuck her.

3988
02:47:22,210 --> 02:47:24,020
That's what she wanted to do.
That was her thing,

3989
02:47:24,021 --> 02:47:24,620
but it's,
I'll go.

3990
02:47:24,621 --> 02:47:26,480
This is a very confusing,
you know,

3991
02:47:27,080 --> 02:47:29,830
we were talk about when they shut 
fucking raped me,

3992
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:32,510
like she was crazy and I go,
listen,

3993
02:47:33,130 --> 02:47:34,520
I don't,
I don't want to rape you.

3994
02:47:34,550 --> 02:47:38,120
Okay.
If you want me to fuck you as if I raped

3995
02:47:38,121 --> 02:47:39,290
you,
that we can do.

3996
02:47:39,370 --> 02:47:44,370
Okay.
But I want to know when you're fighting 

3997
02:47:44,370 --> 02:47:44,370
me off that you want me to do this.
Like,

3998
02:47:44,370 --> 02:47:47,480
this is confusing as fuck and I don't 
want to develop any taste for this.

3999
02:47:47,720 --> 02:47:49,380
Yeah,
I know.

4000
02:47:49,670 --> 02:47:54,670
That's just it.
Because you've been socialized to not 

4001
02:47:54,670 --> 02:47:55,080
rape.
She's unsocialized in you and that's.

4002
02:47:55,130 --> 02:47:57,380
That doesn't make.
May Not be limited to her pool.

4003
02:47:57,381 --> 02:47:58,070
And it,
by the way,

4004
02:47:58,180 --> 02:48:01,260
took a while to get this out of her.
When we first started dating,

4005
02:48:01,261 --> 02:48:03,470
she was like super normal.
Like it came.

4006
02:48:03,570 --> 02:48:04,990
It was,
it was like,

4007
02:48:05,110 --> 02:48:07,920
it took some time.
We got to like what she really liked.

4008
02:48:08,580 --> 02:48:13,580
It was really weird.
It's like as she got a little bit more 

4009
02:48:13,580 --> 02:48:13,580
comfortable with me,
she would like want to arm wrestle me or

4010
02:48:13,580 --> 02:48:17,490
something and it was real weird and over
the course of a couple of months,

4011
02:48:17,660 --> 02:48:20,280
that next thing pretty quickly I was 
just fucking thrown around.

4012
02:48:20,281 --> 02:48:24,030
Dude was ridiculous.
I would like hoist her up in the air and

4013
02:48:24,031 --> 02:48:25,590
like toss her through the air and shit

4014
02:48:25,670 --> 02:48:27,620
the best is you meet a guy later and 
you're like,

4015
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:30,110
oh you stay Jennifer.
I was dating Jennifer and just look at.

4016
02:48:30,111 --> 02:48:31,870
I'm like,
yeah,

4017
02:48:31,871 --> 02:48:35,120
you just shake your head and walk away.
It wasn't Jennifer just,

4018
02:48:35,300 --> 02:48:36,500
Oh,
I didn't mean to say Jennifer.

4019
02:48:37,500 --> 02:48:39,590
She was a nice girl.
Now she was great,

4020
02:48:39,910 --> 02:48:41,480
but I had a girl.
I did a.

4021
02:48:41,510 --> 02:48:42,830
When I was at the neighborhood 
playhouse,

4022
02:48:42,831 --> 02:48:45,830
we had a scene from Farrah Fawcett did 
this movie,

4023
02:48:45,831 --> 02:48:48,470
I forget what it was called,
but she gets raped.

4024
02:48:48,490 --> 02:48:49,640
Oh,
the burning.

4025
02:48:49,641 --> 02:48:50,660
Yes,
exactly.

4026
02:48:50,661 --> 02:48:55,661
Yes.
So we're doing the rape scene from that 

4027
02:48:55,661 --> 02:48:55,661
and I'm like,
we get a that and I'm like fuck.

4028
02:48:55,661 --> 02:48:58,190
And this girl is like not a great face 
but giant rag,

4029
02:48:58,191 --> 02:49:03,191
good body.
And so we have to rehearse it and so we 

4030
02:49:03,191 --> 02:49:06,821
go to,
you get to go to the workspace and 

4031
02:49:06,821 --> 02:49:08,340
there's a combination lock and we go in 
and it's just us and we're practicing

4032
02:49:08,340 --> 02:49:11,520
the rape scene where I literally knock 
her down,

4033
02:49:11,521 --> 02:49:16,521
get on top of her,
rip her blouse on Jesus and I'm a kind 

4034
02:49:16,521 --> 02:49:20,100
of dry humping her while she screams.
So we start to rehearse it in.

4035
02:49:20,280 --> 02:49:23,370
The reason why we have to go to the 
studio alone is we try to do it in class

4036
02:49:23,371 --> 02:49:26,670
and he was like,
this is completely not believable.

4037
02:49:26,671 --> 02:49:30,000
You guys are so aware and you're so 
inhibited,

4038
02:49:30,150 --> 02:49:32,850
you need to let this scene out together,
come do it.

4039
02:49:33,300 --> 02:49:38,250
So we go to the studio and uh,
and I get on top of her and I ripped her

4040
02:49:38,251 --> 02:49:39,090
shirt.
She said,

4041
02:49:39,091 --> 02:49:40,260
you know what,
I brought an extra shirt.

4042
02:49:40,261 --> 02:49:45,261
You can just just rip it and I rip it 
giant rack and I start and I'm and I'm 

4043
02:49:45,261 --> 02:49:47,250
dry humping and we're supposed to be 
doing the lines and,

4044
02:49:47,400 --> 02:49:52,400
and we just start like dry humping,
dry humping and I keep and I was so 

4045
02:49:52,400 --> 02:49:52,400
embarrassed that I kept stopping.

4046
02:49:52,710 --> 02:49:57,000
I raging art on and I'm rubbing it 
against you could redo the scene and she

4047
02:49:57,001 --> 02:50:00,870
was totally into it and I was totally,
totally sexually oh,

4048
02:50:00,871 --> 02:50:05,871
it was such a turnout.
It was both totally into it and she was 

4049
02:50:06,391 --> 02:50:10,140
dating a guy in the class so I wasn't 
going to go over that line,

4050
02:50:10,530 --> 02:50:15,530
but I had to get in the head as an actor
of being a rapist and I just couldn't do

4051
02:50:16,051 --> 02:50:21,051
it.
I couldn't give over to really feeling 

4052
02:50:21,051 --> 02:50:23,010
what it would feel it because to really 
tap into what it would feel like to rape

4053
02:50:23,011 --> 02:50:28,011
somebody and want to.
I guess it would require me shedding so 

4054
02:50:28,011 --> 02:50:29,130
many constraints.
Do you know what I mean?

4055
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:32,550
Like I don't know how you could really 
portray a rapist.

4056
02:50:32,910 --> 02:50:35,670
I felt like apologizing the whole time 
that I was doing it.

4057
02:50:35,930 --> 02:50:40,930
Yeah.
That's a weird to put your mind into 

4058
02:50:40,930 --> 02:50:41,590
that place and then to.
To trust it to not actually.

4059
02:50:42,080 --> 02:50:44,360
Yes,
that's what it was.

4060
02:50:44,510 --> 02:50:47,390
I didn't know when the breaks we're 
going to go on if I let that.

4061
02:50:47,450 --> 02:50:50,780
I was afraid that if I let it out I 
couldn't stop because it's an every man.

4062
02:50:51,210 --> 02:50:56,210
Every man has some chimpanzee inside of 
them and chimps are just raping each 

4063
02:50:56,210 --> 02:50:56,210
other left and right.
Hey,

4064
02:50:56,210 --> 02:50:56,700
love it.
That's what they do.

4065
02:50:56,760 --> 02:50:58,560
They love to write,
so you get some pussy.

4066
02:50:58,561 --> 02:50:59,220
You gotta take it.

4067
02:50:59,640 --> 02:51:00,360
Well,
and,

4068
02:51:00,361 --> 02:51:01,710
and in,
in America,

4069
02:51:01,830 --> 02:51:04,420
I think we've gotten away from that and 
you know,

4070
02:51:05,790 --> 02:51:08,400
one of the things you were talking about
when we were playing pool that I totally

4071
02:51:08,401 --> 02:51:11,100
agree with is that people aren't afraid 
of getting punched in the face anymore.

4072
02:51:11,580 --> 02:51:12,450
And that's a problem.

4073
02:51:12,530 --> 02:51:13,730
That's a problem.
You know,

4074
02:51:13,731 --> 02:51:16,130
we've,
we've lost biologically and your act,

4075
02:51:16,131 --> 02:51:16,790
I know it's been,
uh,

4076
02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:21,800
you,
you play a lot with the idea of the 

4077
02:51:21,800 --> 02:51:23,000
animal kingdom and how as humans we have
to stop denying the connection.

4078
02:51:23,030 --> 02:51:25,040
Basically.
We're a species and,

4079
02:51:25,080 --> 02:51:28,850
and we developed as a species by getting
punched in the face and being killed for

4080
02:51:28,851 --> 02:51:33,851
doing this action.
And so the other people survived and 

4081
02:51:33,851 --> 02:51:33,851
they didn't do that action and that's 
what shaped us.

4082
02:51:33,851 --> 02:51:35,840
And it's also like when I see a guy on 
it,

4083
02:51:35,860 --> 02:51:40,860
like there was a guy in his convertible 
the other day and he was talking on his 

4084
02:51:40,860 --> 02:51:41,210
Bluetooth phone and I forget what he was
saying,

4085
02:51:41,211 --> 02:51:46,211
but just being allowed for self-involved
Douche who didn't look around and 

4086
02:51:46,211 --> 02:51:50,171
everyone could hear him.
And I just thought I want to punch this 

4087
02:51:50,171 --> 02:51:52,991
guy in the face.
You know when I should and I should 

4088
02:51:52,991 --> 02:51:55,301
because I'm doing society a disservice 
by not punching him in the face and if 

4089
02:51:55,301 --> 02:51:55,301
we.

4090
02:51:55,301 --> 02:51:58,660
What is it about someone that's talking 
loud with a convertible and a bluetooth?

4091
02:51:58,661 --> 02:51:59,620
It's so offensive

4092
02:52:00,630 --> 02:52:03,270
to me.
We live in a society that is supposed to

4093
02:52:03,271 --> 02:52:08,271
be aware of its other members and all 
working towards a certain set of beliefs

4094
02:52:09,790 --> 02:52:14,790
like I'm respecting each other's space 
and not being a flashy car,

4095
02:52:16,030 --> 02:52:21,030
so don't.
And it wasn't like he wanted attention 

4096
02:52:21,030 --> 02:52:23,320
to social bias.
You're not giving me the credit of being

4097
02:52:23,321 --> 02:52:26,230
a pedestrian who,
who doesn't want to hear you,

4098
02:52:26,600 --> 02:52:27,310
you're,
you're,

4099
02:52:27,570 --> 02:52:30,220
you're not even looking at me.
You're making me feel like I don't exist

4100
02:52:30,400 --> 02:52:35,400
and you're making me feel like whatever 
you're talking about is more important 

4101
02:52:35,400 --> 02:52:35,400
than me.
And I know that sounds weird,

4102
02:52:35,400 --> 02:52:36,820
but it's,
it's a subconscious thing where you feel

4103
02:52:36,821 --> 02:52:40,000
like you're not validating.
Even the fact that I'm a pedestrian.

4104
02:52:40,001 --> 02:52:40,270
Right,
right,

4105
02:52:40,271 --> 02:52:40,410
right,

4106
02:52:40,530 --> 02:52:42,150
right.
And it's not necessarily right.

4107
02:52:42,780 --> 02:52:43,540
You know,
if you,

4108
02:52:43,541 --> 02:52:47,060
if you do have your fucking car and you,
you answer a phone call,

4109
02:52:47,080 --> 02:52:47,580
you're like,
dude,

4110
02:52:47,740 --> 02:52:52,740
I'm A.
I've got my top down right now and I'm 

4111
02:52:52,740 --> 02:52:52,740
stopped.

4112
02:52:52,740 --> 02:52:53,550
Let me put the top on.
I'll call you right back.

4113
02:52:53,551 --> 02:52:54,360
Yeah,
right.

4114
02:52:54,570 --> 02:52:57,900
I would never talk to somebody in a 
restaurant or coffee shop.

4115
02:52:58,250 --> 02:52:58,650
Uh,
you know,

4116
02:52:58,651 --> 02:53:01,140
there's just things I wouldn't,
you don't talk to someone on the phone.

4117
02:53:01,141 --> 02:53:06,141
You mean I go outside.
He really always text when you're at a 

4118
02:53:06,721 --> 02:53:11,721
dinner or a restaurant.
Only when somebody like goes to the 

4119
02:53:11,721 --> 02:53:11,721
bathroom or whatever,
you know,

4120
02:53:11,721 --> 02:53:13,680
like I don't check texts that often 
because I feel like there's like,

4121
02:53:13,830 --> 02:53:18,830
I feel like life has a rhythm that we've
lost and if I'm constantly available 

4122
02:53:18,830 --> 02:53:23,450
then I'm not.
My rhythm is thrown off because it's 

4123
02:53:23,450 --> 02:53:24,510
something can happen in that text that 
changes my thought too.

4124
02:53:24,511 --> 02:53:29,511
Oh,
I gotta call that guy back or I get to 

4125
02:53:29,511 --> 02:53:31,031
do that.
I suddenly become a servant of my 

4126
02:53:31,031 --> 02:53:33,801
messages coming in,
but I try to space it out every two or 

4127
02:53:33,801 --> 02:53:36,621
three hours.
I don't think there's anything that 

4128
02:53:36,621 --> 02:53:36,621
important that I can't ignore.

4129
02:53:36,621 --> 02:53:40,580
I'm very addicted to a technological 
technological communication,

4130
02:53:41,320 --> 02:53:46,320
whether it's twitter or texting or.
It's very hard for me if my phone's in 

4131
02:53:46,320 --> 02:53:47,310
my pocket,
I it vibrates.

4132
02:53:47,311 --> 02:53:49,470
I know I got a text.
I almost have to read it.

4133
02:53:49,680 --> 02:53:51,780
Are you a multitasker though?

4134
02:53:51,880 --> 02:53:56,880
That's not good.
Especially when you're having a 

4135
02:53:56,880 --> 02:53:56,880
conversation with someone at a 
restaurant.

4136
02:53:56,880 --> 02:53:57,430
You really shouldn't be texting people 
at a restaurant.

4137
02:53:57,790 --> 02:54:00,010
I avoid it whenever possible.

4138
02:54:00,250 --> 02:54:05,250
I'm ashamed.
Like I'll excuse myself and go to the 

4139
02:54:05,250 --> 02:54:05,390
bathroom and then check my emails.
I would never do it at the table.

4140
02:54:06,920 --> 02:54:09,710
It's a.
it's an interesting thing because we.

4141
02:54:09,790 --> 02:54:13,460
We do have this weird disconnect when 
we're right in front of each other,

4142
02:54:13,610 --> 02:54:18,610
like this is the ultimate is to be right
in front of a person and communicate 

4143
02:54:18,610 --> 02:54:21,611
with them.
But meanwhile you're sitting there 

4144
02:54:21,611 --> 02:54:23,800
exchanging text words with someone who's
nowhere near you while there's a person 

4145
02:54:23,800 --> 02:54:25,180
right in front of you and they feel less
important now,

4146
02:54:25,250 --> 02:54:29,570
unless it's something like fucking super
important and really what is really what

4147
02:54:29,571 --> 02:54:31,970
is what is while you're having a 
conversation,

4148
02:54:31,990 --> 02:54:34,750
you get three calls a year.
They really are like,

4149
02:54:34,780 --> 02:54:39,780
you know,
you gotta call back for this thing 

4150
02:54:39,780 --> 02:54:40,000
that's coming tomorrow or your wife has 
taken the kid to the hospital

4151
02:54:40,120 --> 02:54:43,180
and I love the fact about the iphone.
If I look at my phone,

4152
02:54:43,240 --> 02:54:45,970
I get the message right there.
Didn't even have to read,

4153
02:54:45,971 --> 02:54:47,740
so I know.
Help call me right now.

4154
02:54:47,930 --> 02:54:48,430
Oh,
okay.

4155
02:54:48,431 --> 02:54:49,530
There's something going on.
Yeah,

4156
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:51,010
but what's up bitch?
Oh no,

4157
02:54:51,011 --> 02:54:51,730
that one's not important.

4158
02:54:51,800 --> 02:54:52,230
Yeah,
no.

4159
02:54:52,510 --> 02:54:53,630
Yeah.
I mean,

4160
02:54:53,631 --> 02:54:55,240
look,
we used to come home and uh,

4161
02:54:55,370 --> 02:54:57,290
there was no answering machine even,
you know what I mean?

4162
02:54:57,291 --> 02:55:00,280
People lived.
We got by and I think that like how hard

4163
02:55:00,340 --> 02:55:02,090
was it to find people?
It was hard.

4164
02:55:02,091 --> 02:55:03,540
You had to stick to a,
we got,

4165
02:55:03,610 --> 02:55:03,970
we got to

4166
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:05,990
end this because if it goes over three 
hours,

4167
02:55:05,991 --> 02:55:08,320
itunes shits on itself and doesn't know 
how to handle it.

4168
02:55:08,530 --> 02:55:12,740
Didn't seriously go that dude,
we got to do this more often.

4169
02:55:12,741 --> 02:55:13,760
That was flat.
Flew.

4170
02:55:13,880 --> 02:55:17,540
How do people get your podcast?
I know it's available on Sirius,

4171
02:55:17,900 --> 02:55:19,940
on Howard one-on-one.
That's the radio show.

4172
02:55:20,090 --> 02:55:22,280
The radio show,
podcast and radio shows different.

4173
02:55:22,281 --> 02:55:25,160
The podcast,
but a podcast is fits dog radio.

4174
02:55:25,161 --> 02:55:30,161
There's an app called Fitz dog and then 
a itunes and my site is [inaudible] dot 

4175
02:55:30,161 --> 02:55:31,250
com.
And my book,

4176
02:55:31,280 --> 02:55:36,280
I've got an audio book,
the one I told you I wrote it as an 

4177
02:55:36,280 --> 02:55:37,040
audio book of or a version available on 
audible.com.

4178
02:55:37,670 --> 02:55:38,600
You're right.
It did.

4179
02:55:38,601 --> 02:55:43,601
You read it.
I read it and then I had a bunch of 

4180
02:55:43,601 --> 02:55:46,151
other people read it like it's all 
letters that my mother saved my whole 

4181
02:55:46,151 --> 02:55:47,170
life when I was in trouble.
So I've got like Zach Alfin,

4182
02:55:47,171 --> 02:55:52,171
acus and Adam curl.
I got all these famous people reading 

4183
02:55:52,171 --> 02:55:52,171
the letters as if they're the teachers.
Oh,

4184
02:55:52,171 --> 02:55:53,350
that's awesome.
That's cool.

4185
02:55:53,390 --> 02:55:54,520
Dear Ms Dot Fitzsimons,

4186

4187
02:55:55,510 --> 02:55:56,270
Yeah.
That's awesome.

4188
02:55:56,480 --> 02:55:58,160
Beautiful.
Could I do all right man?

4189
02:55:58,220 --> 02:56:03,220

If you're interested in any of this 

4203
02:56:35,401 --> 02:56:36,720
stuff or just go to o,
n n I t there's ample information.

4204
02:56:37,350 --> 02:56:39,660
Any criticisms that we've had about that
information to pass,

4205
02:56:39,661 --> 02:56:44,661
it's all been reworked and it's done in 
the proper manner as far as scientific 

4206
02:56:44,661 --> 02:56:46,110
studies there in the middle of doing a 
double blind.

4207
02:56:46,111 --> 02:56:48,360
Placebo studies had an accredited 
university right now.

4208
02:56:48,360 --> 02:56:50,820
So this is a real supplement.
I love it.

4209
02:56:50,880 --> 02:56:51,370
Uh,
I,

4210
02:56:51,380 --> 02:56:54,350
I take it every day.
It's a nootropic.

4211
02:56:54,390 --> 02:56:56,940
If you don't know when nootropics are,
I suggest you google it.

4212
02:56:56,941 --> 02:57:00,390
New Tropics and O,
o t r o p I c s,

4213
02:57:00,660 --> 02:57:05,660
and what it is essentially it's 
nutrients for cognitive function and 

4214
02:57:05,660 --> 02:57:06,900
increases your brain's production of 
neurotransmitters.

4215
02:57:06,901 --> 02:57:09,660
And it helps you function better how 
your brain works smoother.

4216
02:57:10,160 --> 02:57:15,160
Um,
it's not going to make you smart if 

4217
02:57:15,160 --> 02:57:15,160
