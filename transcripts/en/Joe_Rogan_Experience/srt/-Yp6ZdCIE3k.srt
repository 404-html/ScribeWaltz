1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,690
And Morgan Masters are out there.
I use one out,

2
00:00:02,691 --> 00:00:03,211
three,
two,

3
00:00:03,211 --> 00:00:04,560
one boom.
And we're live.

4
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:06,270
We're just talking about target panic.
Ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:07,770
Shows people don't know about all this
lake.

6
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,230
Uh,
uh,

7
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,480
erectile dysfunction for entry.
It's panic.

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,170
Freak out it because you want that Arrow
to go so bad.

9
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:18,480
By the way.
Thanks for having me on my pleasure.

10
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:22,080
I understand from all the input I get
from all of my intelligent friends that

11
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:23,320
you deserve me,
Huh?

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,980
So I'm excited.
We'll have a good time with your,

13
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,100
your assistant reached out and said
people reach out.

14
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,950
She said,
I think you'll have more in common with

15
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:34,190
Ted.
Then you realize that was her.

16
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,400
That was her pitch.
Truth,

17
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:36,630
logic,
common sense.

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,400
Spirit,
physics of,

19
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:40,650
uh,
the American dream.

20
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,840
Perhaps controversial and misunderstood
people.

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,880
Oh yes.
Boy.

22
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:44,770
We're surrounded.
Oh,

23
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:46,350
maybe both of cluster.
Fuck ringing.

24
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:47,370
Any bells?
Yes,

25
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,600
indeed.
So,

26
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:49,081
uh,
yeah.

27
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:49,920
So target,
panic.

28
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:53,460
I got lucky in that a,
I got hooked up with John Dudley early

29
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:56,640
before I developed target.
Panic is the master and he explained to

30
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:58,680
me shot sequences.
Yeah.

31
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,460
Shot sequences.
Yeah.

32
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,910
And let's,
let's make this available

33
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,340
universally to all of our podcast
friends out there in life.

34
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,700
The clusterfuck to omniscience is what
we aspire to.

35
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,850
A maximum level of awareness on all
fronts.

36
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:21,420
Our curfew or a welder or a podcast or a
guitar player,

37
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,600
a butcher,
right?

38
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,820
Maximum efficiency.
I'm being the best that you can be,

39
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,640
clear mind,
clear conscience,

40
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:35,730
true north compass in the world of
archery because it does consume you.

41
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,130
And here I am,
70 years clean and sober because I'm

42
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,110
currently an forever consumed with the
mystical flight of the era,

43
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:50,000
which is the origins of Zen.
The Japanese religion of not shooting an

44
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:52,100
Arrow,
not being an arrow,

45
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,740
but being the path of your life.
And if you use the gifts from God to the

46
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,750
ultimate application of efficiency and
effectiveness,

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,920
you can put that fucking Arrow right,
right.

48
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:16,200
What you want it to,
and the baggage that all humans have to

49
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:21,180
deal with and it's most painfully
manifested in the pursuit of archery is

50
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,650
too many minds.

51
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,070
You can't think about it.
If you got to think about playing Wang

52
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,110
Dang sweet.
Poon Tang ain't going to play it.

53
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,410
It better just be you and unleash and
with an Arrow because you want to let

54
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:38,250
that Arrow go because you're.
You're shooting an arrow.

55
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,360
Archery,
I need to put that out down there in

56
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:43,590
that bullseye or on that pump station or
that crease of the Buffalo,

57
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,030
and so you want it to go because that's
what you're here for is to let the Arrow

58
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:50,250
go.
So you got to tell yourself,

59
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,850
you can't let the Arrow go.
You have to shoot so many arrows

60
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:56,520
throughout your life that no,
no.

61
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,050
Too many minds,
subconscious physics,

62
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,150
spirituality ingrained deep within your
origins and aboriginal ancestry.

63
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,763
There it is.

64
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,390
If ever there was an aim,
small Ms. Small perfection.

65
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,720
It's archery and let me,
I don't mean to monologue here.

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,760
Oh,
this is so much of my life.

67
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,860
I know.
No matter what you do,

68
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,760
and I've done this since the sixties
when the hippies were trying to get me

69
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:31,660
stone and I'm going,
no,

70
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:34,510
that's not what you want to do.
What you want to do is get a bone arrow.

71
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,150
Would you want to do is escape what
you're trying to escape,

72
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:38,260
the pressures,
the pressures,

73
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,190
fuck those pressures.
You be the source of pressure,

74
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,430
not the receiver of pressure,
and my dad raised me.

75
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:49,250
My Dad was a drill sergeant.
God blessed that son of a bitch is

76
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,620
awesome.
I hated them.

77
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,090
Discipline,
discipline,

78
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:52,960
discipline,
discipline,

79
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:57,340
especially at the archery range and so I
learned archery and when I'm playing

80
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,990
guitar and I'm playing all this
outrageous,

81
00:03:58,991 --> 00:03:59,980
chuck berry,
Bo Diddley,

82
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:04,120
a little richard stuff and everybody's
getting high and drunk and they're

83
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,880
really great musicians and the more high
in the more drunk they got.

84
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,800
They became less great musicians until
the point where they weren't even

85
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:16,720
musicians anymore and so I would escape
that and I as 1112 and there was no

86
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:20,680
hippies.
It was beatniks and I'd get back to my

87
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:24,430
little house in Redford on the Rouge
River in Detroit and I get that little

88
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:27,880
bone Arrow and I go down to skunk hallow
and a river rat.

89
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,400
And even as a stupid mushy brained idiot
child,

90
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,210
I was able to
little the Longbow.

91
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:41,210
No recurves yet.
And you know,

92
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,080
I could shoot a rat in the eye because I
had no baggage yet.

93
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,250
I haven't developed any social baggage
and that has served me.

94
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,700
So the many minds,
many.

95
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,710
I know.
Mine's the baggage.

96
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,663
Yeah.
Too many miles.

97
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,690
I think that that's a thing that people
don't shoot arrows when you start

98
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:06,430
talking about this,
they don't really understand what you're

99
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,840
saying.
I know exactly what you're saying.

100
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,900
But for a lot of people,
this is a very misunderstood subject,

101
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,773
right?
Yep.

102
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,780
That did that,
that this is a meditation.

103
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,230
There's a meditation involved in the
absolute meditation.

104
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,920
You,
it's out of body.

105
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,830
The ultimate Arrow,
like the ultimate guitar lick,

106
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,660
I suspect a comedian on stage,
which I qualify it.

107
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,190
You can't be thinking of your routine.
It's got a flow.

108
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,250
I mean,
I was in the presence of Sam Kinison for

109
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:37,630
50,
60 spontaneous performances and Robin

110
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,910
Williams at the comedy store.
And,

111
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,831
and,
and,

112
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:40,870
uh,
Richard Pryor,

113
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:42,850
you see,
remember I mentioned a moment ago,

114
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:46,120
I've been on the mountain top with Bill
Strop and the Broncos and Parnelli Jones

115
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:48,100
taught me to raise.
I played bass for Chuck Berry.

116
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:49,630
And Bo Diddley,
I mean I'm married,

117
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:53,620
Mrs Nugent.
I mean I've been to the peak of peaks

118
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:57,830
available to mankind.
I hunted with Fred fucking bear.

119
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,320
When did you do that?
I have five or six.

120
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,020
I met him.
He was started the brand new archery

121
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:03,801
shopping,
grayling,

122
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:05,810
Michigan.
My Dad was already a follower before I

123
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:09,230
was exploring to people who he is,
people who are uninitiated.

124
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,670
Powerful story.
He's like the Richard Pryor of archery.

125
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,460
I was expecting his afro to catch fire
any moment.

126
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,990
So I'm already into bows and arrows.
I don't know who fred bear was.

127
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,310
I really was just getting baptized by
the Chuck Berry,

128
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:27,470
Bo Diddley,
electronic guitar or g,

129
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,800
and in that late forties,
early fifties.

130
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,090
It was a firestorm of defiance and
rebellion musically manifested,

131
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,230
but Roy,
whether b was going beyond the 30 slash

132
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:41,240
30,
which everybody used for deer hunting

133
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,140
and it was a good hundred yard and for
real marchmen real zen marksman could

134
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:48,470
shoot a 30,
3,200 plus yards whether open sites or

135
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:53,590
scope and marksmanship and sniper
discipline was a powerful force in a

136
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,740
hunting family and in all families.

137
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,140
Every family I knew,
we all shot every weekend,

138
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,220
pistols,
shotguns,

139
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,570
rifles,
20 twos,

140
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:04,130
hunting,
woodchucks and Freiberg,

141
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:07,460
Pennsylvania with the target master
Remington single shot bolt,

142
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,520
20 to 22 shorts,
twenty five cents a box at the dry goods

143
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:11,540
store.
It's awesome.

144
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,870
And with my dad taught me to shoot him
in the eye.

145
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,680
Aim Small Miss Small breathe site
acquisition.

146
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:21,830
You have a responsibility to kill that
animal outright if you're going to

147
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:26,831
utilize that precious gift of flesh and
for body fluids and bone,

148
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,330
you better kill him clean because you're
a reasoning predator.

149
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,650
You have a moral,
intellectual and spiritual obligation to

150
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:41,260
kill your dinner humanely and cleanly.
Duh.

151
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,780
And so that marksmanship routine was
developing with ballistic Ted nugent,

152
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,880
ballistically maximized firepower.
And Roy stands for,

153
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:54,500
I thought it said bad motherfucker,
you know,

154
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:58,030
that has a ring to it.
Maybe that's maybe that's what it good.

155
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,530
Alright.
So Fred Threadbare,

156
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,180
Fred Beck.

157
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,060
So Roy,
whether be was extending long range

158
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:07,580
marksmanship and developing the,
the famous,

159
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:11,540
whether it be magnums with more powder,
more efficient burning powder.

160
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,960
I'm better primers,
better designed ballistic bullets that

161
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,390
would cut air better and go flatter,
longer,

162
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:22,100
better trajectory and velocity,
and so it was fun to shoot that deer or

163
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,370
a bullseye at 100 yards.
That takes a lot of trigger control and

164
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,380
discipline,
but now roy,

165
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,640
whether it be was creating,
whether it be magnums,

166
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:31,210
the 300,
whether it be magnum shout,

167
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:31,910
100,
eight years,

168
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,980
80 grain,
bullet it 32,

169
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:37,190
3,400 feet a second,
which was unheard of,

170
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,410
and so you could aim small,
Ms. Small,

171
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,780
and if you really got that really
intricate,

172
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,810
meticulous,
triggered a smoothness,

173
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,580
you could shoot thousand yards once you
learn the trajectory of your gun.

174
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,960
However,
1911,

175
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,960
the last of the Yani Indians issue was
discovered in Oroville.

176
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,480
I can't believe I remember all this in
Oroville,

177
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,220
California,
northern California,

178
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,440
and there was a bounty on Indians back
then.

179
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,710
You could shoot a man Indian and get 25
bucks.

180
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:12,120
You shoot until 11.
Yep.

181
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,600
They had bounties on him instead of
shooting this,

182
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:16,950
Yani,
this last Indian,

183
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,310
they called the local sheriff and they
took him into custody and they called,

184
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,960
uh,
some scientists.

185
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,610
And uh,
pellant theologists,

186
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,910
I'm from California University by the
name of our Saxton Pope,

187
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,280
and Saxton pope came and studied egg as
a,

188
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,510
as a aboriginal last pope,
Pope and young that's right.

189
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,090
And then he contacted his buddy,
art young,

190
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,720
who also studied in that genre and they
discovered ecg and they were fascinated

191
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:56,280
by his stealthy awareness of the
wilderness in his archery control,

192
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,170
with his funny little style of shooting
the bull with his thumb and getting

193
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:06,171
close and doing an ice cold river
bathing before the hunt to cleanse

194
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:11,871
himself to be worthy of the beast.
So Fred bear witnessed the film that

195
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:17,661
Pope and young eventually made of them
becoming consumed with the mystical

196
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:19,404
flight of the Arrow.

197
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,480
Now this was in the twenties and
thirties,

198
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,480
and they put a newsreel out when all
over the country and showed this

199
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:27,000
newsreel of hunting with the bone Arrow
by Saxton Pope in art,

200
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,120
young shooting grizzly bears in Yosemite
and going to Africa,

201
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:33,290
filling lines full of arrows.
They weren't really as good as he.

202
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,960
She said they'd fling arrows.
And these animals pretty relaxed,

203
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:39,390
almost tame because they'd never been
hunted like that before.

204
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,960
And so fred bear come from Pennsylvania
around that time to work at the palm oil

205
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,930
company,
building cabinets for the new radio.

206
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:52,500
They just invented in the wood
dashboards for the Ford Motor Company.

207
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,520
And he was also making bows a handmade.
You wouldn't,

208
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,610
or osage orange bows in his little
archery shop with nels grumbly.

209
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,280
I can't believe I remembered Nell's
grumbling one of the greatest boyers of

210
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:09,840
all time.
So my dad got the archery bug because

211
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,050
Fred defied the trend of easier hunting,
easier,

212
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:16,260
long range.

213
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,480
You didn't have to be very stealthy
issue to dear 500 yards.

214
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:21,000
They don't even know you're there.
I have to do is be a discipline

215
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:23,460
Marchmen,
which is a discipline and a great

216
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:27,780
accomplishment unto itself.
And it was a new challenge for long

217
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:32,730
range ballistic capability.
Will Pope and young and a handful,

218
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,790
fred bear knows grumbly went and saw
this newsreel of these guys,

219
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:39,600
these doctors,
these,

220
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,300
uh,
professors hunting all over the world

221
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,090
with these handmade bows and fed was
already into it.

222
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,380
And he was,
I'll be damn this,

223
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,250
I didn't realize you could do that.
And so now people after seeing the pope

224
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:58,710
and young newsreel started asking Fred
to make bows and it's spread.

225
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:02,620
So we started the bear archery company,
late twenties,

226
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,110
early thirties,
and he moved to grayling up in the

227
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:07,750
northern part of Michigan with a
wilderness was,

228
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:09,250
and they had cut down all the trees.

229
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,480
So there was this new growth of ideal
wildlife habitat because not many

230
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:16,510
animals can live in an old growth forest
and our tool,

231
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,840
but you need low level escape sanctuary
and browse that the animals can access.

232
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,280
And so fred was now promoting our tree
and Michigan won all the,

233
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:28,060
uh,
uh,

234
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,570
national field archery championship
championships along with an Marston.

235
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,200
It's awesome.
And so my dad was a follower because

236
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:39,520
he'd come back from World War II and he
needed that escape.

237
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,600
He needed that cleansing to get away
from that horror,

238
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,980
which is why they never talked about it.
And so we go up north every year,

239
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:50,290
October first,
the new gene family and the Ford station

240
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,880
wagon.
And I had my little bone Arrow with the

241
00:12:51,881 --> 00:12:54,160
suction cups,
and I'd shoot stuffed animals off the

242
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:56,380
couch,
but my dad would walk the woods with his

243
00:12:56,381 --> 00:13:01,381
real bowl and we'd stop at this little,
a brick shack that said bear archery.

244
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,630
And I had no idea.
And so I was already into bows and

245
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:06,640
arrows shooting all the time.
I was obsessed.

246
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,130
I was under the river every day.
No baseball,

247
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:10,840
no football,
no hockey bows and arrows,

248
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:11,530
bows,
murals,

249
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,620
critters.
I think I had the songbird world slammed

250
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,270
by the time I was eight.
And,

251
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:18,310
uh,
and so now I'm meeting this tall,

252
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:22,570
lanky gentleman named Fred Bear.
It didn't register with me until I

253
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:27,571
started seeing him on the cover of true
magazine and sporting magazines and in

254
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,590
life magazine with a Grizzly bear and an
elephant and a tiger and a lion in the

255
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:34,060
newsreels.
And I'm going,

256
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:35,950
I'm shooting river rats,
which is so thrilling.

257
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:38,140
I can't even describe it.
And here's this long,

258
00:13:38,141 --> 00:13:39,010
lanky,
tall,

259
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:42,770
lanky guy that was building bows in this
rustic,

260
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,240
rustic shop in northern Michigan.
On my way to my favorite thing in life,

261
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,060
October,
first opening day of archery season as a

262
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:49,811
six,
seven,

263
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:53,500
eight year old boy and we'd have
chocolate milk and Cherry Pie with this

264
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:54,490
fred bear guy.

265
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,910
Now it's registering.
This is the Chuck Berry of bonding.

266
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,130
This is it.
This is the guy.

267
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,810
So I became a namerd with him and he was
kind to me and he'd show me stuff,

268
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,640
but I got to hang out with them as I
grew.

269
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,120
By the time I was 16,
we moved to Chicago was my dad got

270
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,580
transferred,
but I got to visit with Fred bear at

271
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:16,120
least every other October.
Never hunted with them and I'm now.

272
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,380
I started amboy,
dukes.

273
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:19,870
I'd already had a great band when the
battle of the bands in Michigan with the

274
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:22,000
lawyers.
We opened up for the supreme and the

275
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,110
Bulb Romas at Cobo Hall.
Wow.

276
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,690
And so now I'm in Chicago shooting my
boner all the time.

277
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:28,270
Started the amboy dukes playing like a
madman,

278
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,870
graduated in 67,
went back to Michigan that two years

279
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,240
later and immediately went up to
grading.

280
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:38,080
We're now,
there's this huge cathedral bear archery

281
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:43,081
and fred bear is like that dude is like
the sporting dude because he taught the

282
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:46,810
long range marksman that there's an
intimacy,

283
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,890
there's a a better learning process and
more lesson to not kill the animal,

284
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,200
but to understand your relationship with
the animal and to try to use those God

285
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:01,910
given gifts.

286
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:06,910
I mentioned a moment ago to penetrate
the otherwise impenetrable defense

287
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:12,461
system of game because they are sneaky,
elusive crafty.

288
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:18,170
God made them to get away from guitar
players with sharp sticks and so this

289
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:19,850
caught on because people go,
you know,

290
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:23,260
I killed my deer every year with my 30,
30 now with the 30 odd six and Roy Beth

291
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,300
rather be long range.
I wonder if I'm a bad ass enough to get

292
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,790
close to a deer with a bow and arrow.
So it caught on like wildfire and they

293
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:36,890
made the first.
Fred got the first legal season in

294
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:39,590
Michigan,
the Alagan state park on November first

295
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:41,510
19,
47.

296
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,760
George Nichols,
my buddy got the first legal buck and

297
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:46,390
Michigan with a bone Arrow on that
morning,

298
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,730
and so I knew these are the guys I hang
with.

299
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,340
These were the founders.
These were like you were.

300
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,110
I was at the concord bridge of our tree
and so fred had embraced me.

301
00:15:56,111 --> 00:15:59,620
It was real suspicious of the long
haired Hippie looking,

302
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,430
you know,
rock and Maniac Motor City Madman,

303
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,080
but all of his friends would not.
No,

304
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:06,790
he's not into drugs.
He's in fact,

305
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:10,030
he's anti-drug and he's always promoting
our trash out my bone,

306
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:13,690
Arizona state forever,
like shoot flaming arrows at skulls and

307
00:16:13,691 --> 00:16:15,700
a big illegal.
I think it was a felony,

308
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,370
a big Turkey vulture I stuff,
but it looked great.

309
00:16:18,371 --> 00:16:19,210
Backlit,
you know,

310
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,520
and I'd shoot that fucker off this amps
at night.

311
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:24,910
People didn't know whether to shit or go
blind is this wild man screen,

312
00:16:24,911 --> 00:16:29,911
the bird lands,
make it all this outrageous racket.

313
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:33,040
I come up with a bow and Arrow and a
flaming Arrow and blow up a Turkey

314
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:35,320
vulture.
What more do you want?

315
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,590
And so fred got looked past the insanity
of the fear factor of rock and roll,

316
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,130
and he finally admitted to me,
he said,

317
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,030
sporting good show.
I go to Ted.

318
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,610
All the young people,
anybody under 30,

319
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:51,920
all they want to know is if I know Ted
nugent,

320
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,500
because that was the first time they
ever saw bone arrow.

321
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,760
And they read my you my interviews about
the the spirit,

322
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,770
the cleansing of escaping,
the insanity of whatever your job

323
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:06,320
description might be.
Mine being maniacal rock and roll.

324
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:11,590
I need to shut the fuck up,
take a deep breath,

325
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:18,610
get my bone Arrow,
let my guitars breed head back to the

326
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:24,311
woods
and live and remember who I am and what

327
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:31,250
I'm here for.
And I never killed a deer as little too

328
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,320
uppity and we didn't know what we were
doing back then.

329
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,630
You were too uppity,
you think?

330
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,920
What do you mean?
I just,

331
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,240
I'm high energy.

332
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,050
So you had to
be too loud.

333
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:43,970
I mean,
I could walk through.

334
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,330
I learned from Fred Ed.
I learned

335
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,140
to walk toe first and I learned to go
anything you

336
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,390
instead of stepping over and to stay in
the shadows so I knew the maneuvers,

337
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:58,500
but coming out of a tour and playing 350
nights a year and then you get a couple

338
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:00,390
of days after in November and you get
that bone marrow.

339
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,200
It's hard to go from that to total
silence,

340
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,270
but you know what?
I've mastered it.

341
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,100
I know yet.
Finally.

342
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,280
I mean I did,
but then you might take a long time by

343
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:16,230
the sixties.
I don't know about masters.

344
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:19,190
You'll never master it,
but I've mastered transition.

345
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,810
What do you say when people.
Like.

346
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,750
One of the arguments about hunting that
people bring up is why would you use a

347
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:28,380
bow and arrow bone is not as effective
if you wanted to kill somebody issues at

348
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:30,510
gun.
There's people that don't hunt that

349
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:33,570
think that hunting should only be one
thing and it should only be killing the

350
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,404
animal from me.

351
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,420
Whereas I think that someone who hunts
definitely kills the animal from me.

352
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,360
There's more.
There's more to the whole thing.

353
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,800
Have you ever seen me expound on that
fun sport meet trophy.

354
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,640
You can't hunt without having fun or you
won't do it.

355
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,230
It's fun to challenge yourself.
It's fun to get up and some people will

356
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:58,620
have a problem with that word.
They can kiss my ass if it wasn't fun.

357
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:00,570
None of us would do it.
I understand your,

358
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:03,120
your your take on it.
They can kicks kiss your ass,

359
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:06,450
but you.
It means something to you.

360
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:08,460
It's not as simple as like,
fuck you.

361
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,510
This is just how I'm going to do it.
Deep Fun is being the greatest

362
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,580
basketball.
Three point shooter.

363
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,950
Isn't that fun?
Must be discipline.

364
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,050
He will,
but it's.

365
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,780
It's always fun.
It's because it's invigorating and the

366
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:25,480
bow hunting is more invigorated because
it's so difficult.

367
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:29,180
Borderline impossible,
fun sport it.

368
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,530
Why?
I don't think sport hunting is good.

369
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:34,350
You shouldn't have sport.
How can you hunt without sport,

370
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,170
but don't you think that there's just
too many of these words are poisoned.

371
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,460
There's like trophy hunting.
Can't hunt without a trophy.

372
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,800
You know what I have on my wall in my
northern cabin?

373
00:19:43,801 --> 00:19:46,620
You're going to.
You already are inclined to love me,

374
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:49,470
but now you're really going to.
You're going to fuck me right here on

375
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:51,180
the show.
That's not loved.

376
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:54,240
Well,
it's a metaphorically speaking is for

377
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:55,530
some of my buddies.
Anyhow,

378
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,510
so on the wall of my cabin in northern
Michigan is my first kill.

379
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:01,830
November 15th,
19,

380
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:03,210
69.
My Dad's priest.

381
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:05,190
Sixty seven months.
Fuck button.

382
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:06,240
Buck.
Do you hear the story?

383
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,850
Yeah,
and I took it to the taxidermist and I

384
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:11,580
said I want this mind what he said here
to mount this,

385
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,140
but button button.

386
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,810
Buck is a font of the year,
but it has little buttons on his

387
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:18,060
forehead which is illegal deer with a
doe tag.

388
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:21,420
And I had that year and I said,
it's a buck feel.

389
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,460
You have to feel on the to make sure it
is a buck is it's such a little guy and

390
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,270
it's illegal dear,
and it's a delicious deer.

391
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:28,650
The deer,
the year is a fond.

392
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,350
That's why we have this hunting season
in the fall because now they're

393
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:33,290
independent.
They're not there had been weaned.

394
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,160
They're,
they're independent animals.

395
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,050
In fact,
the,

396
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,390
the button bucks are there assets get
kicked by their mother to throw him out

397
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:41,340
of the herd and get the hell out of the
way for more breeding,

398
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,370
which is what I do.
And uh,

399
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,320
and so I have that button,
buck mounted.

400
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,890
Well,
who's going to tell me that's not a

401
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:48,724
trophy?

402
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,770
The,
the,

403
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,580
the,
the experiences,

404
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:53,620
the memories,
the clothes,

405
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:54,550
the bullets,
the day,

406
00:20:54,551 --> 00:20:56,380
the sunrise,
the crows,

407
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,930
the sandhill cranes,
the birds,

408
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:01,900
the movement,
the anticipation.

409
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,770
And I got backstraps.
I had fun.

410
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,930
Ultimate discipline,
challenge,

411
00:21:07,931 --> 00:21:10,450
sport,
ultimate meet,

412
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,730
ultimate protein.
The purest,

413
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:17,731
most organic before it was even hip.
And if you could I dare you to tell me

414
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:19,870
that button.
Buck is not a trophy.

415
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,840
I got,
I have woodchucks mounted.

416
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,870
I got a shot.
I would chuck in the eye with my

417
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:29,440
grandson when I have,
I have squirrels.

418
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:30,990
Mount.
He's always a trophy mounts.

419
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,630
Squirrels.
The squirrels are,

420
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,660
um,
you know,

421
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:36,540
when you,
when you first start out and you killed

422
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,190
that first squirrel.
That's exciting stuff.

423
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,270
It's,
it's,

424
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,730
it's always put a squirrel that you're
mounted on a,

425
00:21:42,731 --> 00:21:47,230
on a limb at the,
in the cabin along with Rocco and my son

426
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:48,760
out here is first one we'd duck that.

427
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,830
He got very,
uh,

428
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,290
with much effort and we have that would
duck mounted.

429
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,410
There's a,
there's a love affair with our

430
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,800
instinctual stewardship duties to the
wildlife to harvest the surplus,

431
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:05,620
to make room for next spring's
productivity because there's going to be

432
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:07,720
more animals,
but there's not going to be more

433
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:12,070
habitat.
Hence sustain yield successful wildlife

434
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:14,440
management model.
That is so perfect.

435
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,000
It defies criticism.
Unless your alliance sack of Shit.

436
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,670
Have you ever had to have a reasonable
conversation with someone who's anti

437
00:22:21,671 --> 00:22:23,260
hunting?
Do you ever like sat down?

438
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,340
Yeah,
often.

439
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:27,090
Absolutely.
And to the man and woman,

440
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,860
I mean adamant Vegan until I explained
to them,

441
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:32,230
well vague and I like that Vegan,
a Vegan,

442
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,880
whatever is in Vegan.
I can't even pronounce it much less

443
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,510
really comes out of your mouth.
Figure it out.

444
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,740
So stupid.
My,

445
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:40,660
by the way,
my son Rocco,

446
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,810
who I love beyond description Vegan.

447
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,950
No.
Yes,

448
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,540
he has.
He needs to eat more

449
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,670
when he's asleep.
I try to shove up backstrap up his ass,

450
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,760
but he's got more muscles that I do.
Anyhow.

451
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,630
My point is,
is that how that.

452
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,630
How did he become Vegan?
He hasn't died yet.

453
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,330
He has a digest.
He has a great hunter.

454
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,670
He doesn't like to hunt anymore.
He's decided not to.

455
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,650
He's killed.
Great dear.

456
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,720
Great Hogs.
I've seen them on your TV.

457
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:08,141
Shit.
Ducks.

458
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:09,220
Yeah.
He's a great hunter,

459
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,970
but he does.
He decided he does not want to take part

460
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,700
in the harvest.
I respect it completely,

461
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,070
but if you.
If you really want to kill the most

462
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:25,480
things,
be a vegan because the farmers who

463
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:30,481
protect your beans kill everything.
I kill one animal per arrow.

464
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,660
In order to grow Tofu,
you have to kill every ground.

465
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:35,950
Squirrel,
every role,

466
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,600
every shoe,
every snake,

467
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,400
every turtle,
every frog,

468
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,440
every bird,
every rabbit,

469
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,740
anything that gets in that bean field,
I'm either going to plow and dismember,

470
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:46,070
which is

471
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,820
why the corrosion,
the seagulls follow the,

472
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,900
the combines.
It combines every year,

473
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,350
and then if anything does survive.
My first slaughter,

474
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,560
I'm going to come in with man's Santa
when poisoned the shit out of everything

475
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,670
so you can have a tofu salad and not be
responsible for any death.

476
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,460
Fuck you.
That's a really good point and it has to

477
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,790
have a lot of people ignore and avoid
because it's.

478
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,410
It's uncomfortable,
isn't life full of uncomfort and thing

479
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:15,110
and you shouldn't be uncomfortable to
kill.

480
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:20,111
Game to feed mankind is perfect to kill
cows and pigs to feed mankind.

481
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,990
It's the system is often less than
perfect,

482
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,390
but until someone comes up with a better
system,

483
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:34,690
I salute and genuflect at the altar of
farmers and ranchers and people who kill

484
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:39,560
animals to sustain my fellow man.
I agree with you.

485
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,400
I think you and I would probably both
disagree with factory farming when you

486
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:46,370
see animals stuffed into pitches,
but we have come up with a better

487
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:46,790
system.

488
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,180
I killed a lot of deer and I.
I feed more people than any.

489
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,200
Any hunter ever.
I killed so many much game of years.

490
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,480
I have to.
I have to hire sharp shooters.

491
00:24:56,481 --> 00:24:59,090
I guy.
I killed the animals on my beautiful

492
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:02,390
swamp and Michigan and my Texas property
that have to die.

493
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,440
They have to get out of there to make
room for the next year's funds,

494
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,910
so I've soup kitchens,
homeless.

495
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:11,150
Yeah.
I literally give tons and I'm a

496
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:12,560
sweetheart,
but I'm not an idiot.

497
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:17,030
I keep the backstraps,
but I give tons of venison to soup

498
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:18,680
kitchens and homeless shelters and
veterans.

499
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:21,680
We make jerky and send it over to the
troops overseas.

500
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,590
I mean I have to adjust my halo or just
to get in the room.

501
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,830
So what I do is literally perfect.
Well the problem is what you do.

502
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,750
Everybody can do like everybody's not
going to have.

503
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,280
You're kind of warn people could though.
More people could.

504
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,430
Yes.
Well you would definitely.

505
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:41,780
I know the hunters for the hungry
distributed a ton of $250.

506
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:46,810
Two hundred $50 million Joe.
Two hundred and $50 million meals every

507
00:25:46,851 --> 00:25:49,040
year.
A venison in.

508
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:52,400
There are people that would ban that.
Shame on you?

509
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,040
Well,
I do.

510
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,520
I just think there's a lot of films and
a lot of documentaries that portray

511
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,390
veganism is being this perfect way of
living that doesn't have any death or

512
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,400
any habitat loss associated with it,
and then they look at the extreme of

513
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:09,530
mediating,
which is the worst aspects of it.

514
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:12,590
Factory farming.
Some of these disgusting pig farms,

515
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,600
chicken,
disgusting,

516
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,770
horrible,
horrifying.

517
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:20,060
The upgrade goes on because more alarms
have been sounded not by paid and not by

518
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:24,170
the humane society of the United States.
They're just scam artist by people who

519
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:29,171
are coming to realize that we do not
only have a responsibility to kill

520
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:31,760
critters,
to feed mankind,

521
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,230
but it can be done in an environmentally
beneficial way.

522
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,510
I mean,
if you watch my great late friend

523
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:42,980
Anthony Bourdain on his shows and Andrew
Zimmern on the travel channel,

524
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,230
you watch their shows and the emphasis
on environmentally friendly

525
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,570
productivity.
More and more organic farming.

526
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,450
More and more conscientious waste
dispersal,

527
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,550
whether it's,
you know,

528
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,950
pig guts and a read we utilize.
Those are in Las Vegas.

529
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:02,610
They get all this wasted food and they
feed the pigs so it's good food going

530
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:03,900
in.
The port tastes better,

531
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:09,050
so there is upgrade taking place and
here's the ultimate inescapable fact of

532
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,480
upgrade environmentalist
environmentalism.

533
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:15,481
When I was grown up,
Joe Lake Erie would catch fire because

534
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:18,240
of the pollution.
It wasn't.

535
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:21,030
Environmentalist are greenies that
sounded the alarm.

536
00:27:21,031 --> 00:27:24,120
It was the duck hunters that said,
you're polluting this area so bad.

537
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:26,550
There's no ducks.
There's no wild salary.

538
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,710
There's no wall eyes,
there's no fish,

539
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,230
there's no muskrats for the trappers.
Hunters,

540
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:34,140
fishermen and trappers have sounded the
alarm more often than not,

541
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:39,030
about environmental irresponsibility and
now lake Erie,

542
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:42,180
they would spontaneously combust when I
was growing up,

543
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,240
is now the number one walleye and small
mouth bass fishery in the world and it's

544
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:49,500
still,
we're still producing and still got the

545
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,240
industrial revolution going on there.

546
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,720
But conscientious,
higher responsible level of awareness is

547
00:27:58,321 --> 00:28:00,420
spreading like wildfire across the
country.

548
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:05,570
And I believe that there's no mutual
exclusivity whatsoever to productivity

549
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:09,210
and environmental responsibility.
I believe that they both benefit each

550
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:10,470
other.
And I've got so many,

551
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:12,750
um,
unlimited examples where that worked

552
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,740
from farms.
It mean people who live downwind of a

553
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:20,850
pink pig farmers are going to be the
biggest squawker is rightly so.

554
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,710
Yeah.
And,

555
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,990
and so I see a lot of upgrade going on,
more organic,

556
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,970
more conscientious,
less waste.

557
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,710
It's not,
um,

558
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,460
it's not as a regular operating
procedures.

559
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,870
That should be.
But I see upgrade.

560
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,040
I see.
I think you're right.

561
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:38,670
And I think that the,
the thought process behind all these

562
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:41,820
people that are upset about factory
farming people even that go Vegan,

563
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,240
the thought process behind it is in the
right place.

564
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,570
I just think there's a lot of misguided
energy there because they don't really

565
00:28:48,571 --> 00:28:50,430
understand where the food is coming
from.

566
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,030
They don't understand large scale
agriculture that understand when you.

567
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:58,930
And a lot of large scale agriculture is
to grow food to feed animals that

568
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,800
essential.
Yeah.

569
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,100
Yeah.
But it's also wheat and is also a lot of

570
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:06,690
grain that people consume and that
displaces thousands and thousands of

571
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:11,400
acres of animals.
And the process is not a clean process.

572
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:14,670
It's not clean in terms of there's no
death,

573
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,950
there's no harm,
it's cruelty free.

574
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:21,951
This crazy as if you can possibly go
through a day without having blood on

575
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:24,990
your hands.
Do you drive on the highways?

576
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,960
Does any of your sustenance come on the
highways?

577
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:33,230
Because billions of animals are
slaughtered on the highways every day

578
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:38,330
and if you are on planet earth,
part of that blood is on your hands.

579
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:40,560
You got to be.
Who doesn't know this?

580
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:42,040
He was,
not to admit this,

581
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,740
but again,
I see an upgrade in level of awareness

582
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:49,000
and responsibility,
but the charge began in the hunting,

583
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:51,850
fishing and trapping community because
where does,

584
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:52,900
where does quality,
air,

585
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:54,190
soil,
and water come from?

586
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,420
I'll go ahead and answer that wildlife
habitat out of the people that are out

587
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,540
there every day to recognize it in more
and more.

588
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,381
You know,
I used to,

589
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:05,500
I still get death threats because I am
murder innocent animals,

590
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,920
but now I get those too.
What the hell?

591
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,970
So it's just so absurd.
But I think their heart like right

592
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,010
place,
they just don't know what they're

593
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:16,540
talking about.
They're just haters.

594
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,900
They're just a bit of that.
In 2018,

595
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:25,260
do you not acknowledged barbecue?
How in 2018 do you not acknowledge

596
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:29,110
there's a few dead Turkeys on
Thanksgiving?

597
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,850
What do you mean you going to be brain
dead?

598
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,970
I think they're so consumed with hate
that they fight.

599
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,790
Ignorance is acceptable.
I'm a grownup.

600
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,560
When I go to the indy 500,
I couldn't turn a cogsworth.

601
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,840
I don't.
I'm ignorant about cogsworth.

602
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,130
Ignorance is acceptable because you can
remedy it with knowledge and research.

603
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:48,850
Stupidity is when you guard your
ignorance,

604
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:54,060
if you think that were murdering
innocent animals to feed our families

605
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:56,590
with the purest protein available to
mankind.

606
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,740
Balancing the herds with more deer,
more elk,

607
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:01,210
more bison,
more turkeys,

608
00:31:01,211 --> 00:31:03,580
more waterfowl,
more cougars,

609
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:07,030
more bears than ever in recorded history
except for the bison,

610
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,880
but we're way back.
We have as many bisons we can sustain in

611
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:12,730
North America.
A lot of the native American tribes are

612
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,750
desperate to get more harvested in an
efficient and responsible manner.

613
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,900
So wildlife is thriving because hunters
implemented regulations for sustained

614
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:24,760
yield.
How many ducks can we kill?

615
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,720
How many will they reproduce?
Where's their habitat determines their

616
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,810
reproduction.
We must safeguard that Delta waterfowl,

617
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:33,130
ducks unlimited,
but see,

618
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:36,220
this information is universally
available,

619
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,620
but the fake news,
academia,

620
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,040
Hollywood,
and half of our government is stone

621
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,060
cold,
obsessed with political correctness and

622
00:31:46,061 --> 00:31:47,120
denial.
Yeah,

623
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,680
so I do what I do and our spirit of the
wild showed been number one.

624
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,710
An outer challenges is 29 years now.
Wow.

625
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,680
I'm getting old because we say it like
it is.

626
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,260
We don't play around fun sport.
Meet trophy,

627
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,710
sacred beast.
Prayer for the wild things.

628
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,120
Resource Stewardship,
conservation wise,

629
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:06,160
use.
Walk the wild ground.

630
00:32:06,161 --> 00:32:09,290
Before you comment on the wild,
grown the.

631
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,550
Well this is what I'm talking about when
you were talking about that last Indian,

632
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,930
but they found the guy who started river
study issue.

633
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,580
Okay.
I will write it down.

634
00:32:18,581 --> 00:32:20,790
What's this?
How do you suppose I s h I.

635
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,470
You have to learn this.
I'm going to send you a bunch of stuff.

636
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:25,930
I'm going to get your contacts and I'm
going to send you stuff.

637
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:31,110
It will expand your horizons like you
didn't know was available.

638
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,320
The.
The history of modern bowhunting at the

639
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:40,070
hands of Fred.
Bear and and Saxton Pope and young and

640
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,950
the families that wanted to get closer
to game,

641
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,490
not necessarily kill because 90 percent
of the time you don't kill squat with a

642
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:48,200
bone Arrow,
but when you do,

643
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:52,880
it's because you dedicate yourself to a
higher reasoning level,

644
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:58,210
Predator awareness and you put your
gifts from God to the maximum efficiency

645
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,150
and again,
that's welding and carpentry,

646
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,740
but ultimately you're going to kill
some.

647
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:09,070
You better kill it,
clean and being human and failing

648
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,950
overall to be perfect.
You can be perfect and put that Arrow

649
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:19,100
when you learned.
Read the wild signals,

650
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,471
the,
the,

651
00:33:19,471 --> 00:33:20,960
the,
the attitude,

652
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,750
and the the,
the bird indicators.

653
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,150
When the deals come in,
you use the light,

654
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:27,740
the wind,
the camel,

655
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,570
stealthy movements,
silence and learned time that shot.

656
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:38,170
My average deer dies in five seconds.
The the top of the heart taken off.

657
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:45,050
Both lungs are penetrated at deer falls,
asleep on his feet and there's never

658
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:47,270
been a beef steak ever had it.

659
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,490
So good.
The also,

660
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:54,200
there's a connection to what you're
doing that's different than almost any

661
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,730
other connection to food.
I mean,

662
00:33:55,731 --> 00:33:58,940
the only thing that's reasonably close
and it's pretty far off is when you grow

663
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:01,070
it yourself,
so if you grow your own vegetables,

664
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,310
you get a connection to that food,
but absolutely it's not the same

665
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:05,480
connection as you get.
No,

666
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:07,700
because you're just going to send an
Arrow through an animal.

667
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,100
You look in his eyes,
you look in that size,

668
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:12,380
but also the,
you know how difficult it is and when

669
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:14,750
you pull it off,
there's this powerful connection between

670
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:18,260
you and that animal.
You earn and you earn burn and when you

671
00:34:18,261 --> 00:34:20,000
eat it,
you feel that you earned it.

672
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,900
I'm telling you way out of it.
When Anthony Bourdain came to my place,

673
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:26,030
he was still a little squeamish with
killer stuff.

674
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,650
Even though he ate dead stuff on every
show and got his paycheck for me.

675
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,120
Dead stuff.
I hunted with him.

676
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,290
Yeah.
Did Ya know it was greg manning.

677
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,220
It was a great man.
I'm terrible loss,

678
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,920
terrible loss,
and we talked about it and I,

679
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,890
I shared my knowledge with them.
I'm not,

680
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:45,170
I don't have an opinion.
It's an animal.

681
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:49,790
It's dead.
You either revered or you don't utilize

682
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:53,630
it with respect or you pretend you
didn't have anything to do with it.

683
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,460
It's dead.
You're eating it.

684
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,840
You should have been closer to the
system and the hunters,

685
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:04,580
fishermen and trappers in this country
still carry on the definitive physics of

686
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:08,720
spirituality that the native and
aboriginal peoples called the great

687
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,280
spirit.
Hence the spirit of the wild.

688
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,690
The prayer for the wild things.
We're in a weird place,

689
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,210
ted,
with cities,

690
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,760
right?
Right,

691
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,250
right.
You were.

692
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,020
Yeah,
but I mean you got lucky and that your

693
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:27,170
father was interested in bowhunting and
that it gave him an escape,

694
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:29,600
which by the way,
it gives a lot of veterans today.

695
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,930
A lot of veterans and good friends of
mine have finding the Lt great relief in

696
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,220
bow hunting as a discipline after
combat.

697
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,880
Yeah,
talking to a guy that's shared mini camp

698
00:35:39,881 --> 00:35:42,090
fires with those guys.
It's a rare last night.

699
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:44,730
Great transition for them.
It's consuming.

700
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,300
Fred bear uses the phrase coined the
phrase,

701
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:53,301
and I use it all the time.
It cleanses the soul when you leave the

702
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:58,890
pavement.
When I leave the pavement and I make

703
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:01,320
that transition from modern concrete
jungle,

704
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:05,700
hand to hand combat city guy,
because that's where my rock and roll

705
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:10,020
career is the ultimate,
and you take that deep breath.

706
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:14,910
You literally go back to the year one.
I know there's a high we nearby and I

707
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:17,380
know I can hear trucks off in the
distance and the train whistle,

708
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:22,320
which is kind of titillated unto itself,
but when I get in my swamp and Michigan

709
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:24,120
or my woodland,
Texas

710
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,830
to quote Jimi Hendrix and no live
nowhere,

711
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,010
I am the aborigine.

712
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,700
It's me,
my resources and the beast and it's a.

713
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:44,100
it's a religious experience.
It's the spirit of that natives called

714
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:46,320
it the great spirit.
Thethe considered the buffalo.

715
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:51,321
They're brother and it is so consuming
that I don't care what kind of stress

716
00:36:51,551 --> 00:36:54,450
you could be going through the ugliest
divorce in the world and I have.

717
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,430
You could be fighting against people who
don't think that America should be first

718
00:36:59,431 --> 00:37:03,720
and you don't need secure borders and
and you don't need to earn your own way.

719
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,150
You're able bodied,
but you want somebody else's income.

720
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,290
It just crazy shit and all of a sudden I
get out there and I'm telling you,

721
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:15,291
Joe,
it's perfect and I'm,

722
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,970
I'm literally intoxicated.
I'm,

723
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,820
I'm drunk,
I'm stoned trying to pick up all the

724
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:26,280
signals and I do.
I do a pretty good job.

725
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,870
I've learned over the years because I
need that so much to play my music like

726
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:35,130
I play it,
that it cleanses my soul and I've been

727
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:40,050
contacted since the sixties with vets
who have gone through just absolute

728
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:46,130
torture in their military careers and
when I get them at a campfire and we go

729
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:52,311
out and sit before the sun comes up,
I can't tell you how many times they've

730
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:55,230
cried because it's,
it's good.

731
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,840
Again,
there was a great morning.

732
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,040
I didn't have any stress,
forgot all about that bullshit when I

733
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,680
thought I heard the deer.
Then when I saw the deer,

734
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:09,570
it was perfect.
So you've expressed that and I thank you

735
00:38:09,571 --> 00:38:13,050
for that because you're new to this
sport and uh,

736
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,960
for you to be an advocate and to
articulate,

737
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,300
you learn because you're already a
mature man.

738
00:38:18,301 --> 00:38:21,210
When you entered it,
I was a dirtball mushy brain kid,

739
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,030
but thank God I learned about that
spirit.

740
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,660
I learned about the discipline.
I learned about stewardship,

741
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:31,530
callings,
and responsibility course pounded by my

742
00:38:31,531 --> 00:38:32,390
dad.
God bless him.

743
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,920
I'm in my brothers,
my sister.

744
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:35,763
We all

745
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,870
are happy,
healthy,

746
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,800
successful,
hardworking,

747
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,990
funny,
cocky,

748
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:44,170
loving,
giving people because of that discipline

749
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:49,380
that revolved around my family hunting
seasons or discipline is one of the big

750
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:53,380
word that that was one of the really
important aspects of it because I

751
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:56,770
recognize the importance of discipline
and always have pretty much my whole

752
00:38:56,771 --> 00:38:59,380
life.
A as a martial artist especially.

753
00:38:59,390 --> 00:38:59,771
Yeah.
Yeah.

754
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:02,380
So I came into boat.
We're ahead of the.

755
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,930
You were ahead of the curve yet.
When I recognized it,

756
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:05,920
I was like,
oh,

757
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,420
I know what.
This is a different thing.

758
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:09,940
This is not what everybody thinks it is.
And this is a,

759
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:14,320
this is a spiritual experience because
you were around the masters.

760
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:17,860
Cameron Hanes,
you had John Dudley on over now is one.

761
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:19,480
It got me.
He's a Michigan boy.

762
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,710
Um,
yeah.

763
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,311
That's,
uh,

764
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:24,430
that they were good mentors for you.
I got lucky.

765
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,520
You got past the mistaken yet
irresponsibly and dishonestly promoted

766
00:39:33,821 --> 00:39:36,670
aspect of the drunk and hill billy
science shooter hunter.

767
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,451
Well,
that,

768
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:39,970
that stereotype is so ridiculous.
I mean,

769
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:44,700
my friends like guys like Cameron Hanes,
he's a Goddamn ultra marathon runner and

770
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:48,640
I run 240 miles in a week and then you
know,

771
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:52,620
is on the mountains all fall long.
Bad mofo.

772
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,200
I'm glad he doesn't play guitar.
Yeah,

773
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,170
he's a bad motherfucker across the
board,

774
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,300
but he's.
He's an incredibly disciplined.

775
00:39:58,301 --> 00:40:00,460
Gosh,
this is his life.

776
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,100
His and he.
He'll tell everybody all that stuff that

777
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:06,340
he does all the working out.
That's so he can be at his best in the

778
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:10,760
mountains as a bowhunter that he
considers his true spiritual call and I

779
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:13,270
got to tell you're sitting across from a
guy and I'm not bragging,

780
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:17,260
I'm just kind of sharing.
You can brag to brag a little bit.

781
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:17,910
Yeah,
but it's.

782
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:21,610
It's a celebration.
I have been humbled and blessed beyond

783
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:26,611
description to share campfires with more
hunters than anybody you've ever met

784
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,350
because I've been donating hunch for
years.

785
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,060
I started,
my son rides the fires.

786
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:36,210
I guide hundreds of hunters every year.
I don't take them all out to their

787
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:38,560
stand,
but we all get together at my Michigan

788
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,940
Place,
have 24 and a weekend,

789
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,830
20 and a weekend and it's a campfire.
Get Down with uncle Ted playing guitar,

790
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,800
but we shoot our bows,
we shoot our guns,

791
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:50,020
we set things up.
A lot of them are newcomers.

792
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,380
I got on my spirit wild ranch in Texas.
I guide in New Brunswick and Ontario for

793
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,060
kid rock into bowhunting.
Yes,

794
00:40:58,061 --> 00:40:58,894
I did.
I did.

795
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,020
That was a great story.
He hunted down.

796
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:05,580
Remember that discipline word.
We're talking about working on that,

797
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,810
but his girlfriend is a killer.
She is a killer.

798
00:41:10,811 --> 00:41:15,811
Gorgeous Gal,
but audrey is a dangerous bull Hutton

799
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,190
woman.
I mean she always killing stuff.

800
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,750
It's tough.
She's addicted.

801
00:41:19,751 --> 00:41:21,790
I get.
I get paced from her all the time and

802
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:23,920
never from Bob.
That's hilarious.

803
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,390
She's awesome.
I'll start sharing that stuff with your

804
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,660
turn.
You onto a higher level of appreciation

805
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:30,550
of finance.
Women with a sharp stick.

806
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,440
This gal between my wife,
Charmaine and Audrey,

807
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,190
I'm telling

808
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,023
you.
Yeah,

809
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,240
but anyhow,
the guys that you've hunted with,

810
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:44,380
you're talking about great human beings,
men of integrity and discipline and

811
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:51,251
productivity and a drive to be in the
asset column misunderstood because of

812
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:53,340
movies.
Very rarely I.

813
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:57,010
I get it.
I was about to say I shared campfires

814
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:01,460
with lots of newcomers because they see
it as rock and roll guy that they loved

815
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:05,030
the music and we share the appreciation
for my American rhythm and blues rock

816
00:42:05,031 --> 00:42:08,690
and roll Jihad,
and so they want to try hunting and they

817
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:12,800
come to my hunt with me or they make a
donation for a military or children's

818
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:16,130
charity and they've never hunted and I'd
tell them what to buy and they show up

819
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:18,860
and it's natty bumppo man who natty
bumppo.

820
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,320
No need to get into that.
Okay,

821
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,660
I'll write that down too,
and now I'm going to sell.

822
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:27,650
I'm going to send it to you.
James Fenimore Cooper.

823
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:30,120
He was a character in his last of
Mohicans.

824
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,330
It's a new hunter,
natty Bumppo,

825
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,910
like a novice of rookie.
Anyhow,

826
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,370
I get a lot of these people and you
know,

827
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:42,880
I've never met anybody at any of my
campfires that wasn't honest,

828
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:50,330
that wasn't friendly,
wasn't successful to some degree,

829
00:42:50,331 --> 00:42:53,180
whether it's a teacher on a teacher
salary,

830
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,220
successful.
There are teacher that's successful

831
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,580
who care deeply about the wildlife and
the wild grounds.

832
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,930
So when you hear about wow,
that drunk and bombs,

833
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,380
just shooting everything,
well,

834
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:08,480
nobody has spent more time with more
hunters than I have.

835
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:12,110
I've never seen that even
exists.

836
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,830
It exists sort of priests that.
But fuck kids,

837
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,810
you know,
but that's not the priesthood,

838
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,940
right?
I hope so.

839
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:22,130
There's always going to be Aberman dip,
shit,

840
00:43:22,131 --> 00:43:25,160
demonic behavior by our fellow man
somewhere somehow.

841
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:29,920
But it is so rare in the hunting world
that I,

842
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:30,823
again,
I,

843
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,971
I,
it's all.

844
00:43:31,971 --> 00:43:34,730
I do seven months a year as hunt.
Well,

845
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:37,070
I haven't hunted as much as you,
but I've been around a lot of great

846
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:38,150
people.
Great people.

847
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,800
Yeah.
And then it goes right back to fred

848
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:42,470
bear,
which is the start off of our dialogue

849
00:43:42,471 --> 00:43:43,880
here.
Great man.

850
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:48,850
We hunted until 1987 together in October
and he was on oxygen.

851
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,400
Then he passed away.
Have you ever heard the song?

852
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:51,760
Yeah.
Song.

853
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,810
And then that song happened with a life
of its own because of my love and

854
00:43:56,811 --> 00:44:00,260
admiration for the man and what he
represented,

855
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,500
someone like that,
that just carries that torch further

856
00:44:03,501 --> 00:44:07,370
than everyone that at times we were so
important at time where there was no

857
00:44:07,371 --> 00:44:10,730
indication that you have to.
The animal rights thing hadn't really

858
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,240
started,
um,

859
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,120
meaningfully yet.
Um,

860
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,910
political correctness,
which wasn't even coined.

861
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:20,660
There was no fake news.
There was the beginning of the attack on

862
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:22,920
hunting from,
you know,

863
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,470
ignorant,
citified,

864
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:28,490
people that somehow believed that their
food didn't die or they're not

865
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:32,130
responsible for any death.
And so they would play the holier

866
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,130
than now dishonesty move by attacking
those of us that actually took part in

867
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:42,471
the process of feeding our families.
And Fred was such a gentleman and he was

868
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:47,601
so clever and he so efficiently promoted
the challenge and the intimacy of man

869
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:54,630
and wild connection that uh,
he will live in infamy.

870
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:56,880
Uh,
everybody in the hunting world knows

871
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:01,350
that he was a force to reckon with and
he's always there and as the song says

872
00:45:01,351 --> 00:45:05,290
in the wind,
he still alive and it's powerful that a

873
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:07,350
lot of people know of him because of you
or.

874
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:08,210
Yeah,
a lot people.

875
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,180
More people have learned about Fred from
me than from the archery industry.

876
00:45:11,181 --> 00:45:11,910
Yeah.
Do you,

877
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,490
do you this,
this conversation you've been having

878
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:16,410
this conversation about hunting forever.
I mean,

879
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:18,990
I've heard a lot of these things that
you're saying today before from you.

880
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:22,120
Does this the ever get tired of seeing
this evangelist?

881
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,983
No.
No.

882
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,160
I love it so much and the other side is
so dishonest that I know I make inroads.

883
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,040
Yoda,
my facebook,

884
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,930
I'm dishonest.
Or you think they're ignorant.

885
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,230
They know that.
They know that there's going to be new

886
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:39,600
funds next year,
but there's not gonna be any new ground.

887
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:42,750
They know this.
They know that venison is good food,

888
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:47,430
but they don't think of it that way.
That's why I continue to do this because

889
00:45:47,431 --> 00:45:52,431
I caused them to think.
I can tell you thousands of examples

890
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:58,100
since the sixties where people thought I
was a coward for murdering innocent

891
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:00,230
animals that can't shoot back.
I mean,

892
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,980
what does that sentence even mean?
What it mean to catch you back and left

893
00:46:04,981 --> 00:46:09,620
trigger fingers yet jerk.
So I have taken this on and you notice

894
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,040
it.
I smiled throughout that whole thing.

895
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:13,170
I don't get angry.
I'm so.

896
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:17,790
I know that by continuing to promote in
the absence of any education and our

897
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:18,980
education system,
in fact,

898
00:46:18,981 --> 00:46:21,780
it's the opposite.
Animal rights gets more time in our

899
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:25,380
education system.
Our anti-education is the media lion,

900
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:27,900
sons of bitches,
Hollywood goofy,

901
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:33,690
half of the government out to lunch,
so you guys like you and me that know

902
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:36,630
the truth.
We should never give up because there is

903
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:39,210
a scourge of political correctness and
dishonesty,

904
00:46:39,211 --> 00:46:40,790
and that's what political correctness
is.

905
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,310
Denial and dishonesty,
and I know we're making inroads.

906
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:48,240
You should see the bombardment.
I got Joseph big hunter now.

907
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:50,670
He's really a fighter.
He speak cleverly,

908
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,280
speaks accurately and and passionately
about it.

909
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,130
Hallelujah.
There's a bunch of us out there with the

910
00:46:56,131 --> 00:46:58,250
advent of the outdoor channel and
sportsmans channel,

911
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:59,770
the pursuit network.
Uh,

912
00:46:59,771 --> 00:47:02,000
more and more people are getting,
you know,

913
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,680
wind of what we're doing.
I think a lot of it from the Internet to

914
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,960
end,
the monster communication people,

915
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:10,800
I think people understand that there's
more to it than they thought.

916
00:47:10,801 --> 00:47:13,380
And if they're willing to just look a
little bit further,

917
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,300
look a little bit further,
they realized like,

918
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:16,560
well,
especially western hunting.

919
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:18,780
Yeah.
These guys are running hills and

920
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,190
they're,
they're,

921
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:23,700
they're backpacking with heavy weights
on their back discipline for hours and

922
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,400
hours everyday just to build up their
endurance and they can hike out with,

923
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:28,980
meet these western hunters.
Man that are going.

924
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:30,120
MOFO is.
Yeah,

925
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:33,460
bow hunting elk and then packing them
out by themselves over the course of

926
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:35,080
five days.
Credible job.

927
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,710
I went to Alaska first time when I was
20 something,

928
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:43,390
I guess I must've been 28,
my first Alaska trip 77 and I was out

929
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:45,220
there for two weeks in a soggy,
wet,

930
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:49,020
nasty cold tent,
a little pup tent with George Fairbury

931
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:52,990
and I got a giant Caribou,
a great black bear in a big old moose

932
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:57,700
and boy humping them quarters in that,
that Tundra,

933
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:58,600
uh,
yeah.

934
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,690
I thought I was a superman athletic
amplifier,

935
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:02,740
jumping,
rock and roll.

936
00:48:02,741 --> 00:48:05,500
So new muscle boy,
my ass kicked,

937
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:09,170
carrying a moose shoulder.
$100 a quarter.

938
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:12,610
Just one big moose.
And you see one in real life.

939
00:48:12,611 --> 00:48:14,290
It's hard to believe that that's a real
animal.

940
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,360
And that goes back to what you were
saying earlier,

941
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:21,540
that when you dine on that and you put
that effort forth and you spent all

942
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,310
those days skunked and wet and cold and
nasty,

943
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:28,570
enjoying it for what it was,
but it was also a pain in the ass.

944
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,910
You can't get wait to get back to some
place with a wood burner,

945
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:36,250
but when you've packed it out yourself,
when you take that sacred flesh off that

946
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:39,310
grill,
before you even finished the first

947
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:43,810
knife,
slice all those memories and it just

948
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:47,530
tastes better and it really does taste
better,

949
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:52,150
but with that effort,
it is a spiritual moment that this

950
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,240
linkedin native say you don't kill the
animal.

951
00:48:55,450 --> 00:49:00,160
You accept the gift if you put your
heart and soul into your reasoning

952
00:49:00,161 --> 00:49:04,570
Predator ship,
and that's always been my mantra and my

953
00:49:04,571 --> 00:49:08,230
kids were all raised on Venison at,
we just don't buy meat.

954
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,890
That's all we eat is the stuff.
We kill a pheasants and quail and Doug's

955
00:49:11,891 --> 00:49:15,520
and woodcock and grouse and rabbits and
squirrels and ducks and geese and

956
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:20,521
galloon mules and snipe and beavers and
deer and elk and antelope and bear and

957
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:23,884
Cougar.

958
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,270
That's the greatest food in the world.
I'm 70 years old and I'm forced to

959
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:33,271
reckon with because of my discipline
diet of the ultimate rocket fuel

960
00:49:33,551 --> 00:49:34,450
available.
Unplanned.

961
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,700
You really do look good for 17.
Fucking fantastic.

962
00:49:37,701 --> 00:49:39,700
If I had some sleep,
I'd be downright handsome,

963
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:43,300
but you think about,
you know the average person that's been

964
00:49:43,301 --> 00:49:46,140
eating the average American diet for 70
years old,

965
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,610
by the time they're your age,
they're deteriorating,

966
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:52,180
rapidly poisoned,
the fruit toast to the chemicals,

967
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:53,590
the preservatives.
Oh my God.

968
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,930
Here's if I may on the Joe Rogan
podcast,

969
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,960
please do my friends.
Get rid of the goddamn sugar.

970
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:05,020
If you can't pronounce it on the
package,

971
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:10,350
do not buy it.
Do not feed your children high fruit

972
00:50:11,621 --> 00:50:15,160
toast poisoning.
My God,

973
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:20,161
people get the poisons out of your
blubbering lives.

974
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:27,990
Good food is so simple by what?
Catch a fish or buy

975
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,270
a fish by some fresh or grow some fresh
vegetables.

976
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,100
Put real butter and use the real fat.
Don't take the skin off the chicken.

977
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:41,300
That's where all the good fat is.
That's where all the flavor is and eat

978
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:42,980
real food.
Wow.

979
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:43,880
We can't afford that.
No.

980
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:48,881
You can't afford not to everything that
says diet on it or no sugar is poison

981
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,380
and it's not my opinion.
It's a chemical reality and when you,

982
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:58,070
when you died,
when you attempt to digest fructose and

983
00:50:58,071 --> 00:50:59,360
preservatives,
you're body goes,

984
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,480
I don't recognize this bullshit.
We can't process this,

985
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:09,710
and it turns into blubber and here's a
little update.

986
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,340
Blubber is for sperm whales,
not people.

987
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:17,930
If you have to lift up slabs to dry off
after the shower,

988
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:22,910
your diet sucks.
I saw you in an interview once,

989
00:51:22,911 --> 00:51:24,780
a long time ago before I started
watching.

990
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:26,080
I've done a bunch of them.

991
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,100
I know you have,
but when I saw you I was like,

992
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:29,660
how's this guy have so much fucking
energy?

993
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:32,240
I remember thinking that like,
this guy is so fired up,

994
00:51:32,241 --> 00:51:34,540
and then he started talking about your
diet started talking about.

995
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,590
He said,
all I eat is venison.

996
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:40,030
You start going off about backstraps and
then I started thinking like what?

997
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:45,130
Like think about the dark red meat of
wild game before you became 100.

998
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,210
Quite a few years before.
I flirted with it for several years,

999
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:53,930
he flirted with.
I didn't have anybody to take get a swan

1000
00:51:53,931 --> 00:51:57,440
dive into it.
I got lucky Steve to me with a mask on

1001
00:51:57,441 --> 00:51:59,450
his show.
I know Steve doesn't like me,

1002
00:51:59,451 --> 00:52:01,550
but he's like,
Huh?

1003
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,910
Why say he doesn't like you.
I've heard comments with is attacking me

1004
00:52:04,911 --> 00:52:08,210
for the whack 'em and stack 'em because
he wouldn't be much better if I just

1005
00:52:08,211 --> 00:52:11,690
butchered them and slaughtered them
because semantics is so important.

1006
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,350
Oh,
W,

1007
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:15,120
the way you phrase things,
waggaman snack on.

1008
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,760
It's fun.
I'm whacking,

1009
00:52:16,761 --> 00:52:18,320
I'm stacking.
I got 12 bluegills.

1010
00:52:18,321 --> 00:52:19,850
That's back.
Shut the fuck up.

1011
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:24,980
Well,
do people think that you were outrageous

1012
00:52:24,981 --> 00:52:28,580
behavior or somehow detrimental to the
movement of acceptance?

1013
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,580
Stupid people do,
but the people who come and join the

1014
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:34,340
sport because of my exuberance don't.
Well,

1015
00:52:34,341 --> 00:52:37,170
I would say that godless,
blessed Brunello and God bless Cameron.

1016
00:52:37,171 --> 00:52:38,660
All those guys,
I revere them.

1017
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:42,530
They're masters of their craft.
I have caused more young people to

1018
00:52:42,531 --> 00:52:46,130
become hunters than all other forces in
the world.

1019
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,780
Case closed because I'm having so much
fucking fun.

1020
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:51,980
They go,
hey,

1021
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:57,240
this guy's out of control.
Bows and arrows don't kill something.

1022
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:00,590
They absolutely come to it because of
the fund.

1023
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:05,000
Then they hear about the discipline and
hear about the quality diet and they

1024
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:08,000
hear about their spiritual trophy,
whether antlers or not,

1025
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:13,540
that has guided my passionate life and
manifest itself in these killer songs

1026
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:18,620
and killer guitar licks and outrageous
fire-breathing concerts and they go,

1027
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,720
oh fuck,
I can do that,

1028
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,090
and so they get a bone marrow.
They shouldn't get a shotgun.

1029
00:53:23,091 --> 00:53:24,650
They started hunting.
Go to my facebook.

1030
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:29,250
I don't know if it's millions,
but found thousands and thousands of

1031
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:34,251
young people that would be inclined to
be anti hunting or no gun Ho hunters

1032
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:39,690
because uncle Ted is having so much fun
because I whacked them and them.

1033
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,950
Well,
congratulations with that.

1034
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,210
Yeah.
The the.

1035
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,250
The thing is that they don't get.

1036
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,400
When they hear your enthusiasm,
then they go,

1037
00:53:47,401 --> 00:53:48,990
okay,
well I haven't had this perspective

1038
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:50,910
before.
Their perspective on hunting that I've

1039
00:53:50,911 --> 00:53:53,850
gotten before is that these are cruel
assholes that go out there and shoot

1040
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:57,120
animals and they don't care and or worse
or worse.

1041
00:53:57,121 --> 00:53:58,590
Joe,
that my critics,

1042
00:53:58,591 --> 00:54:00,780
and I won't mention any names,
but you know,

1043
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:04,410
when they're on,
they're a hunting TV shows and they're

1044
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:07,530
so ultra cautious not to ruffle any
feathers.

1045
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:11,910
They kind of come off like Mr Rogers
with a Lawrence welk soundtrack.

1046
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:16,840
And young people think you're a fucking
asshole if that's all you've got in a

1047
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:18,450
hunting.
Is that boring?

1048
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,610
I think I'll just smoke some dope and
go,

1049
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:22,320
you know,
cruzen tonight,

1050
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:25,140
which I know you like to smoke dope.
And uh,

1051
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:27,820
and I'll call it dope and go nuts.
Do you call it?

1052
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:29,470
Well,
I'm a cop.

1053
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,653
Yeah,
there you go.

1054
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:36,230
Well,
but I got buddies for that.

1055
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:39,600
I just don't think that comfortably numb
is the way to go.

1056
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:41,490
In fact,
I have a solid song I ever.

1057
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:44,310
Well,
you know a better song on my new record.

1058
00:54:44,311 --> 00:54:47,610
It's called uncomfortably dumb.
My point is,

1059
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,900
is,
are you a father?

1060
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,670
Yes.
You want your babysitter high?

1061
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,440
Uh,
no.

1062
00:54:52,441 --> 00:54:54,760
How about your doctor?
No pilot.

1063
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,610
I don't want my babysitter sleeping
either.

1064
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,350
You don't her what?
Sleeping.

1065
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,340
I want them paying attention.
You know what I'm saying?

1066
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:02,460
Yeah.
So that doesn't mean that you shouldn't

1067
00:55:02,461 --> 00:55:04,350
get high ever.
It just means you shouldn't get high

1068
00:55:04,351 --> 00:55:07,080
when you're watching kids.
Damn.

1069
00:55:07,081 --> 00:55:07,861
Right.
Yeah.

1070
00:55:07,861 --> 00:55:10,390
Or when you're flying my plane or I play
Bass Guitar.

1071
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:13,350
The only compromise me doing anything
delicate.

1072
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,410
You know,
the only guy want high who?

1073
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,660
My comedians.
Uh,

1074
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,190
it helps.
It's like steroids.

1075
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:25,970
I was there when Richard Pryor and Robin
Williams and Sam Kinison,

1076
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:26,993
God knows.

1077
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:30,810
Go ahead and snort anything you got
motherfucker because I need to laugh.

1078
00:55:30,811 --> 00:55:32,770
Delay Shit.
It's hard to come out.

1079
00:55:32,771 --> 00:55:36,390
But that shit sober
every night.

1080
00:55:36,391 --> 00:55:38,660
I'm a funny son of a bitch.
You gotta come see my show.

1081
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,130
I have so much fun on stage.
It's stupid.

1082
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,370
I think that perceptions about pot are
very similar to the perceptions about.

1083
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,200
There's a lot of people that abused pot,
they abused alcohol abuse.

1084
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:48,420
People will abuse every.
Sure.

1085
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,400
It doesn't mean you can't use it
responsibly.

1086
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,570
I agree.
Um,

1087
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:56,630
unfortunately in my 60 years of pursuing
the Chuck Berry Soundtrack of Ultra

1088
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,250
James Brown type music,
I have never seen anything but

1089
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:07,620
heartbreak from drugs,
from the drug use.

1090
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,240
Even in.
I'm on a new council by the way of

1091
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:15,720
working with President trump to legalize
medical marijuana nationwide.

1092
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,230
We don't want you to know that and I'm
all for that.

1093
00:56:18,231 --> 00:56:18,990
That was awesome.

1094
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:22,950
I deal with a lot of terminally ill kids
and there's nothing that's off limits.

1095
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,930
Take away that suffering.
So I need to fight for that.

1096
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,520
Well,
it's great for people with epilepsy as

1097
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:28,800
well.
A lot of kids.

1098
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:32,470
Kids have autism.
I got my bag out in the truck.

1099
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:37,360
Um,
some guys making water with cannabis oil

1100
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:41,370
with the CDB is that part of CBD and
sizzle.

1101
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,910
Helped me relax after my sonic bombast
tortured gassed on stage every night.

1102
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:47,760
I'm sure it,
they got to drink some of that shit.

1103
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:49,060
Well,
I know you've had some problems with

1104
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:52,990
your knees and stand both new knees and
both of them,

1105
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,790
you know,
jumping off all those amps.

1106
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:56,950
I never knew.
I never heard the word meniscus still.

1107
00:56:56,951 --> 00:57:00,070
My doctor said I had none.
I have a tear on mine.

1108
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:02,350
I just got a stem cell shots in it
yesterday.

1109
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:08,530
I have two brand new knees and uh,
I end dancing like the 25 year old Ted

1110
00:57:08,801 --> 00:57:09,130
nugent.

1111
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,140
But you're walking fine.
I'm doing fine.

1112
00:57:11,141 --> 00:57:15,010
So I used to have a bad limp right from
that shuffle.

1113
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:17,380
Yeah.
And now we're both gone.

1114
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:21,550
Steve Tyler was here from aerosmith and
he's got a new one.

1115
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:23,690
He's got one new one and he's thinking
about getting another one.

1116
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:25,720
Have both the same time.
Yeah.

1117
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:27,950
How long were you down for?
Um,

1118
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:32,920
I was walking the next morning.
So what do they do exactly?

1119
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,900
Well,
they're going to cut your knee open and

1120
00:57:34,901 --> 00:57:38,380
they get a hammer and a chisel and they
found out the old shit and put in some

1121
00:57:38,381 --> 00:57:40,930
metal stuff.
Have you ever seen this actually

1122
00:57:40,931 --> 00:57:43,510
available online?
You don't want to watch it if you're

1123
00:57:43,511 --> 00:57:44,590
going to have it done.
Oh,

1124
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:48,260
it's brutal.
But I had a good surgeon and uh,

1125
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:53,290
it came out good.
And the pain going on stage for so many

1126
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:55,840
years since certainly since the year.

1127
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,000
2,000 with the Damn Yankees.
Even.

1128
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:01,250
What year did you get it done?
A 2000.

1129
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:03,940
18?
No.

1130
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:06,460
12 maybe.
So 12 years of pain?

1131
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:07,323
Yeah,
oh it was,

1132
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,960
it was more than that,
but because I jumped off those fucking

1133
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:14,710
amplifiers.
Blew your knees out.

1134
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:18,790
Oh my.
What kind of dirt bag was I?

1135
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:22,600
Somebody should have said you have
meniscus will you know,

1136
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,420
discuss,
you know Maynard Keenan,

1137
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:27,250
the lead singer of tool,
right.

1138
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,330
He blew his hip out from just stomping
on the ground because the music.

1139
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:33,610
I have a new record called the music
made me do it.

1140
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,280
The music made him do it.
There's music made Steve.

1141
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:37,650
Tyler do it.
When you get up there,

1142
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:41,140
it is a world unto itself.
It is out of body is stream of

1143
00:58:41,141 --> 00:58:45,640
consciousness.
It you got to be careful because you

1144
00:58:45,641 --> 00:58:50,641
think you're invincible.
Invincible on net stage with Weiwei way

1145
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:52,210
that movie invincible.

1146
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:54,490
They use stranglehold.
Best use of my song ever.

1147
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,860
But anyhow.
Best use of your song ever was randy

1148
00:58:56,861 --> 00:58:59,020
coture coming out to stranglehold in the
UFC?

1149
00:58:59,021 --> 00:58:59,920
Yeah,
you're probably right.

1150
00:58:59,921 --> 00:59:00,850
Yes,
I remember that.

1151
00:59:00,851 --> 00:59:02,920
Yes.
And the Black Hawks in Chicago,

1152
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:05,260
every gigs for the 25,
30 years,

1153
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,250
they came out the stranglehold when he
beat Tim Silvia for the UFC heavyweight

1154
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:11,410
title,
severe undercard underdog.

1155
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:16,450
And he came out and the place went nuts
when he says it all to here,

1156
00:59:16,451 --> 00:59:20,680
like come again,
a baby like a dog in heat to me by the

1157
00:59:20,681 --> 00:59:21,950
clamor baby.
And I'd like to

1158
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,470
tear up the street.
I've been smoking for so long.

1159
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:26,990
I'm here to stay.
I've got you in a stranglehold bitch.

1160
00:59:26,991 --> 00:59:29,660
Get the fuck out of my way.
Fucking awesome.

1161
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,490
You're getting.
You're getting excited.

1162
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,660
It's a love song.
The connection between rock and roll.

1163
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:39,620
Guitarist and bow hunting.
For most people it's like a big stretch

1164
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:42,050
to stretch.
It's like what are those different

1165
00:59:42,051 --> 00:59:43,700
galaxies?
Different universities,

1166
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:47,000
except for the most important elements
in that is discipline.

1167
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:50,630
Discipline,
the focus to create an.

1168
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:55,520
I've been so blessed beyond words to
have the greatest musicians at my side

1169
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:58,880
for ever for literally 60 years right
now.

1170
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:02,600
I got Greg Smith on the Bass Guitar.
Just a god of thunder.

1171
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:07,370
Greg Smith the best,
like a funk brother and heat and Jason

1172
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:09,050
heartless.
Twenty three year old drummer from

1173
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:14,051
Detroit is just an absolute animal.
And every band from my royal high boys

1174
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:17,990
and the fifties to the lords in the
sixties.

1175
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:21,380
And the Amboy dukes and even the Damn
Yankees with Tommy and Jack and Michael.

1176
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:23,510
Are you kidding me?
I've had literally the,

1177
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:27,680
a list of musicians at my side from
Tommy Aldridge and Tommy [inaudible] and

1178
01:00:27,681 --> 01:00:29,860
make brown and drums and,
and,

1179
01:00:29,861 --> 01:00:31,790
and cliff Davis.
Are you kidding me?

1180
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:34,310
Denny Car Masiya.
I mean the best drummers,

1181
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:37,250
the best bass players.
I've just been the luckiest guitar

1182
01:00:37,251 --> 01:00:38,810
player in the.
But it's a weird connection,

1183
01:00:38,811 --> 01:00:40,910
right?
Like most people don't think of rock and

1184
01:00:40,911 --> 01:00:45,000
roll and bow hunting at the same thing
you do.

1185
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:48,380
You're the only one.
But there I was geographically in

1186
01:00:48,381 --> 01:00:49,480
Michigan,
uh,

1187
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:53,990
a firestorm of musical influence to all
the best musicians in the world.

1188
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:56,930
They'll tell you,
come out of Detroit from Motown,

1189
01:00:57,170 --> 01:00:58,640
Bob Seger.
Now Kid Rock,

1190
01:00:58,641 --> 01:01:00,680
eminem.
And just just killer,

1191
01:01:00,681 --> 01:01:02,030
killer bands.
Mc Five.

1192
01:01:02,031 --> 01:01:05,240
I got a great Wayne Kramer Story.
He has a wonderful book coming out

1193
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:08,090
called the hard stuff you ever talked to
Wayne,

1194
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:10,550
you need to have Wayne Kramer on your
show.

1195
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,010
He kisses him from New York,
the MC five,

1196
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,100
but at rock city I'm thinking,
yeah,

1197
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:19,190
I'm going to turn you onto Wayne Kramer.
Has got a book about his tragic mistakes

1198
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:21,830
and near death,
heroine prison,

1199
01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:24,770
dirt bag maneuvers,
but he's a great man,

1200
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:29,950
a musical authority,
and in the music of Detroit and of

1201
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:34,970
course fifties little Richard.
How do you not get moved by little

1202
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:39,470
Richard and Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry?
How do you not how he had not touched by

1203
01:01:39,471 --> 01:01:43,250
that and then you see him on tv and the
Ed Sullivan show it.

1204
01:01:43,251 --> 01:01:44,540
I don't care who you are.
Steven,

1205
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:46,130
Tyler,
Billy Joel or whoever,

1206
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:48,830
you know,
Elvis Presley and now the stones and the

1207
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:50,360
Beatles.
Are you kidding me?

1208
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:55,361
On Ed Sullivan and I had a guitar plus
I'm in Michigan and I every kid was

1209
01:01:56,061 --> 01:01:57,650
born.
You got a red rider,

1210
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,230
daisy bb gun.
You had a Wemo slingshot and you had a

1211
01:02:00,231 --> 01:02:01,640
little bone Arrow of some kind.

1212
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:04,940
I live right next to the rouge river,
so I was always down there,

1213
01:02:04,941 --> 01:02:06,800
you know,
chase and critters and building forts

1214
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:11,801
and crossing the river and the music and
the bowhunting music in the bowhunting.

1215
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:15,080
I met Fred Bear.
I got these great musicians,

1216
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:17,020
the music and the bowhunting music and
the book.

1217
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:20,100
Unbelievable.
What a life,

1218
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:25,170
what a dream,
what a firestorm of cravings and

1219
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:28,350
fulfillment of those cravings everyday.
And here it is.

1220
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:33,500
Last night mares my 6680th concert and
it goes all the way back to Stockholm.

1221
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:36,120
All counter to all the way back to the
19 fifties,

1222
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,520
60,600.
You write them down now.

1223
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,850
I did for years.
I took out all the books and start

1224
01:02:40,851 --> 01:02:42,180
adding them up.
But from the,

1225
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,510
from my,
uh,

1226
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:48,660
a musical review with the Royal School
of music in 1958.

1227
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,500
And then with Joe [inaudible] from the
Capital School of music at the Detroit

1228
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:54,810
fairgrounds.
And then we started playing sock hops

1229
01:02:54,811 --> 01:02:57,390
and pool parties and malt shops and
everywhere,

1230
01:02:57,391 --> 01:02:58,620
you know,
basement parties.

1231
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,280
I counted those,
those are gigs.

1232
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:03,600
And then when the amboy dukes started in
[inaudible] 65,

1233
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:08,250
we'd do 300 concerts,
three plus 300 a year for many,

1234
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:10,110
many years.
And then even with the Damn Yankees and

1235
01:03:10,111 --> 01:03:13,410
the early nineties we did over 200
concerts a year.

1236
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:18,590
So I added them all up.
And last year was 6,679 in Okinawa for

1237
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:22,260
the US Marine Corps.
Pretty intense.

1238
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:25,470
And then last night at the coach house
in San Juan Capistrano,

1239
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:28,800
6,680 to 96,
six 81.

1240
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:30,350
Jesus.
Yeah.

1241
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,010
Cool.
That's why I look tired.

1242
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:36,210
That's a lot of things in remedy.
How do you have the time?

1243
01:03:36,211 --> 01:03:38,670
Because I always figured out,
I tried to figure out how I have the

1244
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:41,370
time to do what I do,
but I think you do more than I do.

1245
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,140
Uh,
I think we can both agree.

1246
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:47,130
The greatest philosopher of all times
was dirty Harry when he said a good man

1247
01:03:47,131 --> 01:03:51,720
knows his limitations
back in the [inaudible] with the Amboy

1248
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,090
Dukes,
we do over 300 concerts a year and I was

1249
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:55,140
still craving my hunting.

1250
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,450
So I'd,
I'd carve out a weekend in October and a

1251
01:03:57,451 --> 01:04:00,420
weekend in November with my dad and we'd
get out there and hunt.

1252
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:03,780
But that wasn't enough.
What about practice time with the

1253
01:04:03,781 --> 01:04:07,380
archery?
Ida Bone Arrow on the road block target.

1254
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:12,510
Met in a parking lot somewhere.
Morel targets for morale and it's got a

1255
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:15,000
spot,
but no,

1256
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:19,410
I've shot my bow and Arrow on stage with
thousands of contracts and then I always

1257
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:21,690
have it with me and I always have
friends that have bows and arrows.

1258
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,920
In fact,
I wish I had brought it today because I

1259
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,840
could show you some this zen of mystical
flight of the Arab maneuvers.

1260
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,600
They had a really lightweight bowl,
only 50 pounds.

1261
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:35,240
That new matthews.
I shoot the new triax manager.

1262
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:38,200
There's not a bad bill out there.
Not Anymore.

1263
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,430
The competition is awesome.
So anybody listening to the most

1264
01:04:41,431 --> 01:04:44,180
important thing you can tell,
Joe and I love the mystical flight of

1265
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:49,190
the Arrow.
Go get you a bow and Arrow shop fire

1266
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:53,100
hazard.
Find a bowl that fits you and make sure

1267
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:55,460
it's graceful enough.
Don't struggle when you're starting to.

1268
01:04:55,461 --> 01:04:56,820
We've got to come back.
Mushy.

1269
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:01,770
Archery is grace,
not power and get that bow so it settles

1270
01:05:01,771 --> 01:05:04,170
back here for hand.
Eye Coordination,

1271
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,350
and you don't have to struggle.
People should start with a 25,

1272
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,440
30 pound bow to get that archery thing
going.

1273
01:05:10,441 --> 01:05:14,070
Preferably an old recover long boy if
you can and find out where you're

1274
01:05:14,071 --> 01:05:16,560
pointing,
where's that Arrow going and you will be

1275
01:05:16,561 --> 01:05:17,620
consumed with it

1276
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,460
and then work your way.
You can really teach you if you have to

1277
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:24,720
have a mentor because if you do it wrong
and you start with a bad,

1278
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,610
bad habits will plague you.
Then you could target panic.

1279
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:28,190
Well,
it's a.

1280
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:31,660
that's a problem with martial arts too.
It's really important to start off with

1281
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:36,190
a good instructor if you learn things
poorly first and then try to fix it,

1282
01:05:36,191 --> 01:05:38,920
but you're still kind of wired
incorrectly.

1283
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,620
It's very difficult and archery as well,
right?

1284
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,160
That's why America is in trouble because
people are learning at schools.

1285
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,240
That's a really good analogy.
I mean really learning the wrong stuff.

1286
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:50,830
I mean,
it really is what's going on.

1287
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:53,710
You know,
you get taught that life is boring,

1288
01:05:53,711 --> 01:05:56,290
droning.
Pay attention to the rules.

1289
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:59,260
Show me,
show me a graduate from the American

1290
01:05:59,261 --> 01:06:02,260
anti-education system that can balance a
checkbook.

1291
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:06,250
Does people do that anymore where they
ought to know?

1292
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:09,670
Unfortunately they don't hedge the debt.
You know,

1293
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:13,980
pragmatism went the way of maps,
but you know what I mean.

1294
01:06:13,981 --> 01:06:16,390
I'd be pragmatic.
Be Responsible,

1295
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,970
be accountable.
Be Utilitarian.

1296
01:06:18,971 --> 01:06:23,440
Self be the best that you can be.
Call your body the sacred temple that

1297
01:06:23,441 --> 01:06:25,660
it's supposed to be treated with
reverence,

1298
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:28,030
eat good,
be good,

1299
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:30,460
be the best that you can be.
Be Competitive.

1300
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:32,140
Life isn't fair.
Get used to it.

1301
01:06:32,141 --> 01:06:34,900
If you want to excel in life,
you show up earlier than the

1302
01:06:34,901 --> 01:06:36,850
competition.
You work harder than competition.

1303
01:06:36,851 --> 01:06:38,410
You do a better job than the
competition.

1304
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,830
You stay later than the competition.
You'll end up owning the damn company.

1305
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:44,290
Yeah,
and learning how to think.

1306
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,620
Learning how to think and learning how
to look at things.

1307
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:50,080
It's something that's never taught in
school and it's one of the most

1308
01:06:50,081 --> 01:06:52,570
important lessons in your life and you
learn that lesson,

1309
01:06:52,571 --> 01:06:54,250
I think through doing difficult things.

1310
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,440
Absolutely.
I had a conversation about you once and

1311
01:06:56,441 --> 01:06:57,210
someone was like,
well,

1312
01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:57,970
what do you think?
He's like,

1313
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:58,803
I go,
look,

1314
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:01,330
this is what you have to understand.
Forget about all the public shit.

1315
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:04,570
He's awesome at two things that are
really hard to be good at.

1316
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,600
Guitar in Bowhunting,
very difficult.

1317
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:12,490
Both very difficult to be disciplined.
You have to be an exceptional person,

1318
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:16,780
especially since you sound like such
shit for so long and the guitar,

1319
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:20,830
there's no satisfaction whatsoever.
You go out for how many years took

1320
01:07:20,831 --> 01:07:22,090
years.
I was the worst.

1321
01:07:22,091 --> 01:07:23,860
All my buddies learned faster than I
did.

1322
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,960
In fact,
I just met up with Donnie Henderson.

1323
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:29,530
He's probably listening right now and he
was in a band called the gang when I had

1324
01:07:29,531 --> 01:07:31,630
a band called the lawyers.
We kicked their ass and won the battle

1325
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:36,631
of the bands in Michigan when I was
about 13 or 14 and he and I are still

1326
01:07:37,871 --> 01:07:38,860
friends and he's.

1327
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:44,050
I guess he's going to be 70 soon too,
and he played all the Chuck Berry and Bo

1328
01:07:44,051 --> 01:07:45,490
diddly stuff.
Perfect.

1329
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:48,250
And I'm stumbling and making stupid
noises,

1330
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:51,490
but you know what happened because I
couldn't figure out the exact licks.

1331
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:54,880
I created my own style and I started
playing.

1332
01:07:54,881 --> 01:07:58,900
People thought I was being clever.
I just wasn't doing them wrong,

1333
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:02,560
but it still had a good rhythm at a kind
of cool Santa.

1334
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:04,990
Yeah.
Like John Coltrain meets,

1335
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:08,020
you know,
a punk kid play in bodiddly licks,

1336
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:11,500
and so I developed my own style and I've
had a lot of fun with it.

1337
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:15,010
But with all your question is though,
with all your media,

1338
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:16,070
all the stuff that you

1339
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,580
do,
you're,

1340
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:19,490
you're constantly doing interviews and
phone interviews.

1341
01:08:19,491 --> 01:08:22,190
You're constantly doing things.
How do you have time to do all this?

1342
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:24,350
Still write music.
I have a great team.

1343
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:26,810
You were talking about Linda getting
ahold of your team.

1344
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,660
Linda Peters have been with me for 30
years.

1345
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:31,040
Uh,
Doug Bankers,

1346
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:35,150
been my manager for over 30 years of all
my crew,

1347
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:38,390
Chris Helms and Jim nap and my sons and
my daughters.

1348
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:41,540
Um,
my wife Charmaine is the goddess.

1349
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:44,450
If you ever seen Shane,
sure God help me.

1350
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:45,620
Senior show.
Oh,

1351
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:48,070
she's so good.
And she's the queen of the forest.

1352
01:08:48,071 --> 01:08:49,640
He is the queen of the forest.
Full time.

1353
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:53,930
Not a damn thing you can do about it.
And I have such a great team.

1354
01:08:53,931 --> 01:08:58,070
My crew on the road right now.
I leave nothing to chance.

1355
01:08:58,071 --> 01:09:00,470
I don't have to worry or think about a
thing.

1356
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:05,500
All I have to do is play my guitar and
rock my balls off,

1357
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:10,820
so I always had a great team,
professional work ethic,

1358
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:13,460
monsters that are conscientious.

1359
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:16,070
I'm dedicated,
professional,

1360
01:09:16,071 --> 01:09:19,310
knowledgeable,
so there's no loose ends and that's how

1361
01:09:19,311 --> 01:09:20,990
I'm able to do all.
You're this,

1362
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:25,830
but you're also this really loud voice
in the culture war have to be,

1363
01:09:25,831 --> 01:09:27,140
you know,
you have to be.

1364
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:30,890
I,
I refuse to let lives go unchallenged.

1365
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:35,600
I refuse to let antilogic going.
Challenged antilogic like what?

1366
01:09:35,690 --> 01:09:38,150
Like did you.
You don't need secure borders really.

1367
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,760
So the Democrats,
I think we need to secure our borders

1368
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:45,260
and the Democrats don't admit there's a
difference between legal immigration and

1369
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:48,200
illegal immigration.
Let me give you a little metaphor.

1370
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,630
If you go to the bank and withdraw from
your account,

1371
01:09:50,631 --> 01:09:53,450
your illegal banker,
if you go to the bank and draw from

1372
01:09:53,451 --> 01:09:55,820
someone else's account,
you're a bank robber.

1373
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:58,790
That was a division.
There were four of legal banking.

1374
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:03,791
We're not for illegal banking and this
kind of antilogic has weaseled his way

1375
01:10:03,921 --> 01:10:08,921
into policy and it's just tragic with
the multi trillion dollar debt and

1376
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:12,620
unsecured borders and we're worried
about separating families,

1377
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,300
which we failed to say.

1378
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:19,540
If you're going to come here,
come legally are we will send you back.

1379
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,790
We send out a message,
have edit.

1380
01:10:21,791 --> 01:10:23,510
Just go ahead and implement across the
dam river.

1381
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:26,660
Well,
do you personally have a problem when

1382
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:30,050
they separate families?
Because I'm a father and a grandfather.

1383
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:31,400
Yeah,
the fucked up.

1384
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:35,170
But the real fuck up starts with the,
the,

1385
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:40,450
the insane irresponsibility of daring to
subject your children to that.

1386
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,580
I don't think they have any choice at a
dinner over there.

1387
01:10:43,581 --> 01:10:48,581
They live in
Mexico and Guatemala is one big gang

1388
01:10:48,681 --> 01:10:51,380
infested government.
Military law enforcement.

1389
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,710
Shithole.
Yeah.

1390
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,140
Yeah.
And if you call it a shit hole,

1391
01:10:54,141 --> 01:10:55,100
I'm racist.
Well,

1392
01:10:55,101 --> 01:10:57,050
if it wasn't a shit hole,
they would stay.

1393
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:58,910
It is a shit hole.
You ever been there?

1394
01:10:58,940 --> 01:10:59,773
Well,
some,

1395
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:00,290
some.
Uh,

1396
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:02,630
Mexico is also.
Some of the Mexico hasn't been raped and

1397
01:11:02,631 --> 01:11:04,010
pillaged yet,
but give them time.

1398
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:08,720
They'll make it that even in the big
resorts they're murdering and raping and

1399
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:11,390
bureau realizing people.
I mean,

1400
01:11:11,391 --> 01:11:14,310
it's just a hell hole.
There's definitely some bad things

1401
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:17,040
happen in a lot of it is because of the
drug war out of control.

1402
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:18,390
Yeah,
and a lot of people think that the

1403
01:11:18,391 --> 01:11:21,490
remedy to that is legalizing drugs and
taxing man.

1404
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,373
Yeah.
Yeah.

1405
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,690
So I mean the same thing with
prohibition.

1406
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:29,990
Same thing that would happen in America
really boosted organized crime and Al

1407
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:33,090
Capone and they.
They got a stronghold because of the

1408
01:11:33,091 --> 01:11:36,540
money they were making from illegal
drugs or alcohol at the time.

1409
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:41,590
I think that right now that the spoiled
Brat epidemic in this country,

1410
01:11:42,211 --> 01:11:45,570
if you don't get everything,
you want you to start shooting people or

1411
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:49,260
cut people off and road rage if
everything doesn't go just right.

1412
01:11:49,261 --> 01:11:53,550
Everybody is so touchy and so pussified
that when I was growing up,

1413
01:11:53,551 --> 01:11:56,580
sticks and stones may break your bones,
but words will never hurt me.

1414
01:11:56,610 --> 01:12:01,610
What do you think that's coming from the
liberalization of policy and the the

1415
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:08,930
horrible lie of the welfare dream that
people who need a helping hand are

1416
01:12:11,851 --> 01:12:14,710
always given a helping hand by neighbors
and family and friends,

1417
01:12:14,711 --> 01:12:16,260
and if they have.
Well,

1418
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:19,230
the Catholic Church has
$8,000,000,000,000 just in jewelry.

1419
01:12:19,231 --> 01:12:23,220
They could probably provide some
sandwiches and blankets so there's

1420
01:12:23,221 --> 01:12:26,670
plenty of help available,
but when you get into a system and you,

1421
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:30,540
you play on the people's emotions that
we need a safety net,

1422
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:32,730
these poor people are just too.
You need help.

1423
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,160
Okay,
let's create a welfare where we can help

1424
01:12:35,161 --> 01:12:36,960
these destitute people.
Meanwhile,

1425
01:12:36,961 --> 01:12:41,550
it's infested with scammers and blood
suckers and liars who are abled bodied

1426
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:43,350
and they just don't want to stop it to
help.

1427
01:12:43,351 --> 01:12:45,930
One is sign.
They want some of your income because

1428
01:12:45,931 --> 01:12:49,740
you're stupid enough to get up early and
work really hard and they don't want to.

1429
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:53,670
That's pandemic.
So meanwhile the people who are truly

1430
01:12:53,671 --> 01:12:55,800
needy,
they slipped through the cracks.

1431
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,780
We don't even get to know who they are
and and the the liberal policy of

1432
01:13:00,781 --> 01:13:05,010
eliminating the heartbreak and the
disrespect of Cuckoo's nest.

1433
01:13:05,011 --> 01:13:07,440
We can.
We can call them mental health centers.

1434
01:13:07,441 --> 01:13:09,720
We might hurt some feelings.
So now what are they doing?

1435
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:12,180
They're putting spikes in boards and
attacking people,

1436
01:13:12,181 --> 01:13:15,870
walking their dog and La.
He said there's no place for them to go.

1437
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,410
When I was growing up,
there's a place in Detroit called a

1438
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:21,050
[inaudible].
It was a nuthouse and that's the

1439
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:24,060
Cuckoo's nest.
That's where if you were mentally ill

1440
01:13:24,061 --> 01:13:26,970
and you needed help that there was a
place for you to go to get you off the

1441
01:13:26,971 --> 01:13:29,330
streets so you don't attack people with
spikes in Dubai.

1442
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,550
What are you talking about?
The spikes in right here,

1443
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:32,760
right down the street here.

1444
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:33,750
One,
two days ago.

1445
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:37,470
Tact some,
a fashion photographer walking his dog

1446
01:13:37,471 --> 01:13:40,710
and hit him in the head with a two by
four with a spike and almost killed him

1447
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:42,330
in a.
In a citizen.

1448
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,620
I didn't even hear about it.
Oh yeah.

1449
01:13:43,621 --> 01:13:45,540
It was awesome.
Citizen jumped up in the air and caught

1450
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:47,710
this guy with both feet right in the
neck and neck.

1451
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,980
Beat the shit out of him.
It was awesome.

1452
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:52,290
That's nice.
That was a rare occasion of justice.

1453
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:54,150
Pro Wrestling comes in handy,
but yes,

1454
01:13:54,151 --> 01:13:58,470
but that,
that incident is not rare where you go

1455
01:13:58,471 --> 01:14:03,471
to San Francisco and the mental health
institution isn't supposed to be the

1456
01:14:03,631 --> 01:14:07,290
streets.
That mental health is a good example of

1457
01:14:07,291 --> 01:14:11,100
too much liberal policy.
You get people that are a little bit too

1458
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:14,230
progressive and
regressive.

1459
01:14:14,231 --> 01:14:17,080
I don't know.
How did they ever utilize that term

1460
01:14:17,081 --> 01:14:19,300
that's bastardized as progressive?

1461
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:23,260
It gets so far that it becomes
regressive when you're letting bombed

1462
01:14:23,261 --> 01:14:24,970
shit all over the streets.
But thank you.

1463
01:14:24,971 --> 01:14:27,470
I think that would be an indicator.
So there's.

1464
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:31,030
So the idea is that just like these poor
people leave them alone,

1465
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:32,050
you know,
they're fine.

1466
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:33,030
They just,
you know,

1467
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,520
it's okay if they live on the streets,
but if you go to San Francisco,

1468
01:14:36,521 --> 01:14:39,460
they're very aggressive.
It's one of the weirdest places I've

1469
01:14:39,461 --> 01:14:42,430
ever been in terms of homeless people
and one of the most heartbreaking

1470
01:14:42,431 --> 01:14:44,500
unquote progressive places in our
country.

1471
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:46,870
So one of the most progressive cities,
heartbreaking.

1472
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:49,720
We need more cuckoo's nest,
but even those institutions,

1473
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:54,820
the corruption and the abuse of power
that runs ramp into nurse Cratchit and

1474
01:14:54,821 --> 01:14:55,200
that,
that,

1475
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:58,780
that,
that wasn't just a fantasy scrip that

1476
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:03,760
happens the irresponsibility and in,
in pharmaceutical,

1477
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:05,460
everybody,
you know,

1478
01:15:05,461 --> 01:15:09,400
they got a mental problem and then they
increased the mental problem with big

1479
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:10,234
farm.

1480
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:13,090
I mean,
I've had personal experiences with that

1481
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:18,040
with dear friends of mine that were
having mental problems and they end up

1482
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:23,041
in an institution and then their mental
problems are exasperated by chemical

1483
01:15:24,101 --> 01:15:26,060
warfare upon them.
You don't.

1484
01:15:26,070 --> 01:15:27,190
When I was growing up,
how old are you,

1485
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:28,900
Joe?
Fifty slash 50 just to boy.

1486
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:31,140
Um,
when I was growing up there was this,

1487
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:34,720
this mantra,
this colloquialism better living through

1488
01:15:34,721 --> 01:15:37,750
chemistry in many ways it is.
I mean,

1489
01:15:37,751 --> 01:15:42,751
we saved tens of millions of lives in
Africa with DDT by killing the Zec fly

1490
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:48,640
and we save tens of millions of people.
And then some environmentalist come in

1491
01:15:48,641 --> 01:15:53,641
and the DDT is a dangerous chemical,
so they stopped it and we lost tens of

1492
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:55,170
millions of people.
It's better to kill a bunch of seats.

1493
01:15:55,171 --> 01:15:58,330
He flies to save human lives than to
band the DDT.

1494
01:15:58,331 --> 01:16:00,910
That allows tsetse flies to flourish and
kills people.

1495
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:05,410
Uh,
so now it's gone full circle and that's

1496
01:16:05,411 --> 01:16:09,390
where the toxins have accumulated and
the,

1497
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:13,930
the horrific waste that I had texted
anthony just before he died,

1498
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:17,470
congratulating him,
hunt his hosting that brilliant

1499
01:16:17,471 --> 01:16:19,750
documentary if you haven't seen it yet,
it's waste,

1500
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:21,400
waste,
exclamation point,

1501
01:16:21,401 --> 01:16:26,401
what we do to where foods in this
country and the self inflicted scourge

1502
01:16:26,831 --> 01:16:27,640
of,
of,

1503
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:31,270
of toxification,
of our precious environment.

1504
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:34,810
So there's not a lot of easy answers.
But here it is,

1505
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,630
28th of June,
2018.

1506
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:41,470
And here you and I are at least
discussing this stuff to millions of

1507
01:16:41,471 --> 01:16:42,520
people,
I suspect.

1508
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:47,850
And I see upgrade taking place.
I see upgrade in awareness,

1509
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:51,490
uh,
not fast enough to make me happy,

1510
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:52,743
but,
uh,

1511
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:57,930
enough to indicate an upgraded prognosis
for people's awareness,

1512
01:17:00,551 --> 01:17:03,160
accountability,
responsibility.

1513
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:04,480
Where,
where are you seeing this?

1514
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:06,880
Uh,
whether it's,

1515
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,530
you know,
like the circles that you travel circles

1516
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:10,364
certainly in

1517
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:14,210
we don't waste.
One of my biggest pet peeves is little

1518
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:15,550
fat kids that,
you know,

1519
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:19,100
take a sip of $2 bottle of water and
then they leave it there and ended up

1520
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:24,101
throwing it away and the waist is
pandemic in this country and I see my,

1521
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:28,940
my kids are like,
like storm troopers there,

1522
01:17:28,941 --> 01:17:33,941
like drill sergeants with that we just
don't want to waste and we've always

1523
01:17:34,641 --> 01:17:38,120
recycled and the jury is still out,
whether that has any effect at all.

1524
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:39,980
But the,
the,

1525
01:17:40,370 --> 01:17:45,370
the disconnect in unconscionable
misbehavior of just tossing and throwing

1526
01:17:48,591 --> 01:17:49,790
away everything.
You know,

1527
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:52,250
what drives me fucking crazy.
Cigarettes out the window.

1528
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:55,340
People just went.
The people that smoke cigarettes for

1529
01:17:55,341 --> 01:17:57,770
whatever reason,
to have a problem throwing it on the

1530
01:17:57,771 --> 01:17:59,120
ground,
he wouldn't let her.

1531
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:01,970
How about what drives me crazy?
There's somebody still stupid enough to

1532
01:18:01,971 --> 01:18:03,790
buy cancer.
Yeah,

1533
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:04,690
exactly.

1534
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:06,920
Here,
let me invest in the companies that want

1535
01:18:06,921 --> 01:18:09,740
to kill me here.
Here's a couple extra thousand dollars.

1536
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,980
Kill more of us.
Strange.

1537
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:16,710
Cool.
It makes it look a rebel man.

1538
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:17,810
Well,
I've never smoked.

1539
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:20,900
I've never smoked a cigarette.
No drugs,

1540
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:22,490
no drugs,
no alcohol?

1541
01:18:22,491 --> 01:18:23,970
No.
You drink a little wine though.

1542
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:25,370
Fat Pussy.
I'm telling you,

1543
01:18:25,371 --> 01:18:27,850
that shit will kill you know families.
No,

1544
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:33,160
not even a little allergic.
I'm a big fan for those who want,

1545
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,750
but no,
I drink a little wine though.

1546
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,480
I do drink a little wine,
but I don't think that qualifies as a

1547
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:42,200
drink.
Having a glass of wine with my sons and

1548
01:18:42,201 --> 01:18:44,360
my daughters,
my brothers and sisters,

1549
01:18:44,361 --> 01:18:46,200
they Thanksgiving dinner.
Beer.

1550
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:48,150
Beer is better than coke,
right?

1551
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,680
Vastly.
Sure.

1552
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:54,850
It's when you start to enter the drool
zone that I have a big problem of

1553
01:18:55,371 --> 01:18:57,740
course,
and all of a sudden if there's a

1554
01:18:57,741 --> 01:19:00,520
problem,
I can't rely on you anymore.

1555
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:05,000
I want to be reliable and that's why I
have a problem with comfortably numb.

1556
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:07,640
Yeah.
I think in my experience,

1557
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:10,910
you can't wake up the bass player
because he was comfortably numb.

1558
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:13,460
The guys don't show up.
You can't tune his guitar.

1559
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:16,490
He forgot.
The lyrics were not as tight as we could

1560
01:19:16,491 --> 01:19:17,870
be.
You're fired.

1561
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:20,770
I know what you're saying,
but this is what I'm saying to you is

1562
01:19:20,771 --> 01:19:25,190
that this is just a discipline issue and
it's not the marijuana or anything that

1563
01:19:25,191 --> 01:19:27,680
gets people like that.
It's a lack of discipline.

1564
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:32,150
I think Jitsu world and the Jujitsu
world is filled with people that smoked

1565
01:19:32,151 --> 01:19:36,050
pot and these motherfuckers work hard.
They want.

1566
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:41,080
What's the number one karate guy?
Who was the guy that died personally?

1567
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,043
Yeah.
Bruce Lee.

1568
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:44,090
Did he smoke dope?
Uh,

1569
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,160
he ate hash.
The Hash.

1570
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:46,701
Yeah.
You know,

1571
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:48,560
he's into eating half.
Here's my question,

1572
01:19:48,561 --> 01:19:52,430
but that's not what killed them.
Here's my question to you is I offered

1573
01:19:52,431 --> 01:19:56,150
to my son Rocco,
because he's an advocate of marijuana.

1574
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:57,403
Yes.
Okay.

1575
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,610
And I said,
Rocco.

1576
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:00,470
And I said,
and I said,

1577
01:20:00,471 --> 01:20:05,471
so do you really believe that?
Perfectly clean and sober [inaudible]

1578
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,900
taking care of your health with a
conscientious diet,

1579
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:14,460
good athletic workout,
discipline,

1580
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:17,030
physical prowess,
[inaudible].

1581
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:20,370
Do you really think that an outside
source,

1582
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,160
payoti mushrooms,
dope,

1583
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:28,670
whatever you want to call it,
do you really think that with that

1584
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:33,890
outside influence you can do something
you can't do unto your God given gift,

1585
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:38,940
individual self?
I'm convinced,

1586
01:20:38,941 --> 01:20:42,750
Joe,
that you will be the absolute best you

1587
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:46,650
can be.
You will accomplish what I think is a

1588
01:20:46,651 --> 01:20:49,920
self inflicted curse of modern man,
that 90 percent,

1589
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:54,810
98 percent of humanity might be tapping
into five percent of their capabilities

1590
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:59,670
because they get on a treadmill.
They get into a paradigm self restricted

1591
01:20:59,671 --> 01:21:04,671
pier nine ever so decreasing a view of
the world and experiences and the

1592
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:10,560
overwrote,
the destroyed road over traveled versus

1593
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:14,550
not only the road less traveled,
but the non road untraveled.

1594
01:21:14,551 --> 01:21:16,980
That's my favorite.
I'm convinced that you,

1595
01:21:16,981 --> 01:21:21,981
Joe Rogan
will find your superior definitive best

1596
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:28,320
without any outside influence.

1597
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,860
I believe you have the power.
I think I have the power when I get

1598
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:35,400
onstage tonight and you gotta come you
gotta come witness this,

1599
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:38,670
but my bed and I do like it out.
We'll figure out a time.

1600
01:21:38,671 --> 01:21:40,390
I can't come tonight.
It's like Italy.

1601
01:21:40,391 --> 01:21:44,130
I got an orgy.
So at the Improv of human fire,

1602
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:49,140
we put our fists together and chant
James Brown and Wilson Pickett and funk

1603
01:21:49,141 --> 01:21:54,141
brothers and it's like the last wolves
on an island gun gnashing of teeth over

1604
01:21:54,811 --> 01:21:57,180
the last bone.
And Charlotte of flesh,

1605
01:21:57,510 --> 01:21:58,530
it's,
it's a,

1606
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:03,800
it's an out of body
soaring above life itself.

1607
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:10,580
Experience that we have in us.
I don't need anything.

1608
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:13,620
I understand me,
I understand that.

1609
01:22:13,621 --> 01:22:17,350
But you don't use anything,
so you're talking from a place of non

1610
01:22:17,351 --> 01:22:20,370
experience when it comes to marijuana or
mushrooms or any of these things.

1611
01:22:20,371 --> 01:22:24,840
But my 70 years,
I'd say at least 55 of those years from

1612
01:22:24,841 --> 01:22:26,490
the beatniks to the hippies,
to the,

1613
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:27,600
to the friends.

1614
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,750
And you got to meet this Wayne Kramer,
guide Mc five guitars,

1615
01:22:30,751 --> 01:22:32,340
new book,
the hard stuff.

1616
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:35,790
He and I were born the same time,
same influenced Detroit,

1617
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:37,290
the swamps,
the outdoors,

1618
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:38,850
but bodiddly,
Chuck Berry,

1619
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:40,080
Motown,
James Brown.

1620
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,820
He started smoking dope.
I didn't.

1621
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:46,470
And he's a any.
Got Heroin and had any prison again.

1622
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:52,260
And then arrested and I'm having the
time of my life and he's like wallowing

1623
01:22:52,261 --> 01:22:56,580
in a cesspool of dog shit.
And I'm not knocking Wayne.

1624
01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:59,400
I'm saying that he was courageous to
write this book.

1625
01:22:59,401 --> 01:23:02,070
It's a brilliant book.
You got to have them on.

1626
01:23:02,071 --> 01:23:03,630
You're going to read it.
You're gonna.

1627
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:06,400
You're going to be consumed

1628
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:11,400
by his conversational writing of the MC
five's a ascension to the most

1629
01:23:14,321 --> 01:23:19,120
authoritative power house music I've
ever witnessed in my life,

1630
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:23,770
to a bunch of dirt bags on the downward
spiral because of drugs and alcohol.

1631
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:27,010
I know that happens.
It definitely happens,

1632
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,700
but it happens with everything.
It happens with people when they eat too

1633
01:23:30,701 --> 01:23:32,680
much food.
It happens with people with gambling.

1634
01:23:32,681 --> 01:23:36,220
It happens in different things,
but I think it's because of discipline.

1635
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:38,140
It's because they don't have a clear
path.

1636
01:23:38,141 --> 01:23:40,870
I think it's because they let themselves
become self indulgent and they let

1637
01:23:40,871 --> 01:23:44,230
themselves be weak,
but I'm saying is that I know a lot of

1638
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:47,440
people who use,
whether it's psychedelics or they use

1639
01:23:47,441 --> 01:23:49,930
marijuana and they use it to enhance
their perspective.

1640
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,420
It doesn't become the primary focus of
their life.

1641
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:54,880
It doesn't consume their life.
They don't allow it to consume their

1642
01:23:54,881 --> 01:23:55,510
life.

1643
01:23:55,510 --> 01:24:00,400
There's a whole other world of
disciplined marijuana enthusiasts and

1644
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:03,460
they're confused.
Same way people confuse hunter's the

1645
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:06,220
same way.
People think of hunters as being lazy.

1646
01:24:06,221 --> 01:24:09,520
Drunk and slavs were cruel to animals
and you and I know that that's not the

1647
01:24:09,521 --> 01:24:13,780
case at all,
some of the most disciplined focused and

1648
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:17,080
just people in the world,
intense people because to be,

1649
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,260
to be at Cameron Hanes,
to be a John Dudley,

1650
01:24:20,261 --> 01:24:24,010
you have to be a superior type of human
being super athletes.

1651
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:28,420
You have to be able to execute in that
extreme moment,

1652
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:31,660
that moment where that animal walks out
into that shooting window and you're

1653
01:24:31,661 --> 01:24:36,280
looking at this three 90 bull elk
screaming,

1654
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:39,650
screaming,
overwhelming all over itself over

1655
01:24:39,651 --> 01:24:42,520
whelming and it's 40 yards away and your
center in that pen.

1656
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:46,780
It takes magical,
powerful human being to execute that

1657
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:48,910
shot and I don't think most people are
aware of that.

1658
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:52,510
Most people don't know in the same way
that that's misunderstood.

1659
01:24:52,511 --> 01:24:55,330
I think marijuana is misunderstood
because there's a lot of dummies in this

1660
01:24:55,331 --> 01:24:57,250
world.
If you get a group of 100 people,

1661
01:24:57,370 --> 01:24:59,140
what are the odds that one of them is
going to be a dummy?

1662
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:01,690
Fucking 100 percent,
right?

1663
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:03,820
One hundred percent nowadays more than
one.

1664
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:05,410
Well,
if you get a group of 100 people that

1665
01:25:05,411 --> 01:25:09,580
use marijuana,
the one loud fucking stupid one defies

1666
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:12,580
or defines rather what marijuana users
are.

1667
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:17,020
You see that fucking idiot who's pissing
all over himself and fallen down so high

1668
01:25:17,021 --> 01:25:19,000
you can't walk.
That's what you think of.

1669
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:22,840
You don't think of the Brazilian Jujitsu
black belt that smokes pot and then goes

1670
01:25:22,841 --> 01:25:26,980
out and strangles 50 people in class.
You don't think of people that take yoga

1671
01:25:26,981 --> 01:25:28,780
class.
I liked hiring marijuana.

1672
01:25:28,810 --> 01:25:32,180
Strangling there should be.
Listen,

1673
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:35,710
I'm absorbing,
absorbing,

1674
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:39,160
in,
respecting and considering your work.

1675
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:41,800
It can get away from you can get away
from you.

1676
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:44,230
All I've ever said,
everything can get away from you.

1677
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:47,350
That's all I've ever seen,
but I think it's because these people

1678
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:50,290
that consume it,
they don't have those other qualities.

1679
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:53,770
They don't have discipline and focus.
They don't have respect for their body.

1680
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,150
See,
the thing with the,

1681
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:57,910
especially in the Jujitsu community,
it's super common.

1682
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,330
Marijuana is really,
really,

1683
01:25:59,331 --> 01:26:00,670
really,
really common.

1684
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:01,660
Yeah.
I mean,

1685
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:04,430
there's a show called high rollers where
these guys,

1686
01:26:04,431 --> 01:26:07,280
they put together a Jujitsu tournament
and everybody had to get high before

1687
01:26:07,281 --> 01:26:11,580
they rolled and you're talking like
elite world class Brazilian Jujitsu,

1688
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,900
black belts competing high on marijuana,
and that's got to be one of the highest

1689
01:26:14,901 --> 01:26:17,540
forms of disciplines very available to
us.

1690
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:18,770
It's a very,
very.

1691
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:22,910
With the camera and climbing bowhunting
Coleen and milk in your lap.

1692
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,133
Well you're,
you're,

1693
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:28,010
you're doing an art that's designed to
break bodies and the two of you are

1694
01:26:28,011 --> 01:26:30,800
going to do it together and the whole
idea is that you're going to get someone

1695
01:26:30,801 --> 01:26:33,260
into a position where they have to tap
or they're going to get their arm

1696
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:35,030
snapped or they're going to get choked.

1697
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:39,590
Unconscious said intense.
Extremely difficult pursuit and a lot of

1698
01:26:39,591 --> 01:26:41,210
people do it under the influence of
marijuana.

1699
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:44,900
Do you know any of these master Jujitsu
martial artists?

1700
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,100
Oh yeah.
Fit that.

1701
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:48,020
Don't do any.
Oh yeah.

1702
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,570
And how did they perform?
They perform well.

1703
01:26:50,571 --> 01:26:51,800
Do very well.
There's.

1704
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:54,500
Look,
there's an elite world class athletes in

1705
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:57,890
Jujitsu that don't.
Do you know if the world champion got

1706
01:26:57,891 --> 01:27:00,110
high or not?
Well,

1707
01:27:00,111 --> 01:27:02,210
I know a lot.
I do,

1708
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:04,760
but I know a lot of them do.
A lot of world champions do.

1709
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:08,530
I know a lot of like real multiple time
world champion.

1710
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:10,070
They're marijuana users.
Yeah.

1711
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:11,990
How about world champions that don't get
high?

1712
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:16,160
There's a lot of those to see.
What happens with marijuana is increased

1713
01:27:16,161 --> 01:27:18,310
sensitivity that a lot of people talk
about.

1714
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,490
They call it paranoia because there's a
lot of things that people put blinders

1715
01:27:22,491 --> 01:27:23,000
on their life.

1716
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,730
A lot of people aren't aware,
and I'm sure because of your hunting,

1717
01:27:25,731 --> 01:27:29,480
you're spending time in the woods.
You're soaking in all the variables.

1718
01:27:29,481 --> 01:27:32,600
The sound when I'm a radar there.
Right.

1719
01:27:32,601 --> 01:27:35,000
You're aware there's a lot of people
that go through life like this.

1720
01:27:35,001 --> 01:27:36,020
No.
They go through life like they're

1721
01:27:36,021 --> 01:27:38,690
looking through a toilet paper roll
there in the left lane right now.

1722
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:39,540
Yeah.
They're not.

1723
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:42,020
They're not using their blinkers and
those people,

1724
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,480
those people,
when they smoke marijuana,

1725
01:27:44,481 --> 01:27:46,970
they freak out.
They get paranoid because what's

1726
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:50,890
happening is the marijuana increases.
Your sensitivity makes you aware of all

1727
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:53,630
these variables and a lot of people
consider that paranoia.

1728
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:55,880
He started freaking out about all these
variables.

1729
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,780
You start thinking about your mortality
and instead of embracing this time as a

1730
01:27:59,781 --> 01:28:02,480
magical moment,
instead of being in this moment,

1731
01:28:02,690 --> 01:28:05,750
you just start getting overwhelmed and
you feel your own heartbeat and you

1732
01:28:05,751 --> 01:28:06,390
start freaking.

1733
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:10,400
Now this all the time,
it's without anything.

1734
01:28:10,430 --> 01:28:15,430
It's an entheogenic.
It brings you closer to whatever you are

1735
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,100
not encumbered by your ego.
I will

1736
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:25,630
admit in escapable that everything
affects everyone differently.

1737
01:28:25,821 --> 01:28:29,200
Yes,
but once you make it widespread,

1738
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:31,820
I mean,
I've studied the results of legalization

1739
01:28:31,821 --> 01:28:36,770
for recreational use in Colorado and how
the highway fatalities and accidents

1740
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:38,750
have increased,
but you know what else has increased the

1741
01:28:38,751 --> 01:28:42,290
population in proportion,
so it causes breeding.

1742
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,570
Thousands is more people there.
More people are there,

1743
01:28:44,571 --> 01:28:48,770
so you having more accidents there.
The problem is is a boom of population

1744
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:51,890
also a boom in the economy of boom,
in the real estate.

1745
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:53,270
Real estate's taking off.
Yeah,

1746
01:28:53,271 --> 01:28:56,090
there's a lot of losers there too,
because a lot of hacky sack playing

1747
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:57,830
dirty,
stinky hippies that are wandering around

1748
01:28:57,831 --> 01:29:00,140
with no shoes on.
You're going to get those.

1749
01:29:00,230 --> 01:29:01,160
You're going to get those.

1750
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:03,960
You know,
if you have an opening welcome society

1751
01:29:03,961 --> 01:29:05,820
that's.
That doesn't lock those people up,

1752
01:29:05,821 --> 01:29:08,010
you're going to have those as a part of
freedom.

1753
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:09,023
Yeah,
it sucks.

1754
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:13,860
Losers are a part of this safe world
that our kids are allowed to wander too.

1755
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:16,800
We want the world to be safe,
so sometimes things are too safe.

1756
01:29:16,801 --> 01:29:19,200
You nerve the edges and you get a bunch
of people that are used to hitting their

1757
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:21,090
heads on things and they're not worried
about it.

1758
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:24,780
You're going to have these losers,
but it doesn't mean that everybody who

1759
01:29:24,781 --> 01:29:25,620
does,
it's a loser.

1760
01:29:25,621 --> 01:29:30,621
I know a lot of CEO's of big
corporations that have responsibilities

1761
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:32,580
and they liked to smoke a little pot.
I get,

1762
01:29:32,820 --> 01:29:37,620
I get punched back off and on facebook.
I'm a successful guy,

1763
01:29:37,621 --> 01:29:39,060
run my family.
I'm a good dad.

1764
01:29:39,061 --> 01:29:41,910
I'm a good hunter and I'm a.
I'm a trump supporter and I get high.

1765
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:44,480
Oh God bless you.
I just,

1766
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:47,370
I don't watch a babysitting my kids
while you're high.

1767
01:29:47,371 --> 01:29:48,870
Yeah,
but it's discipline.

1768
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,650
Discipline is the thing that fucks
people up and the lack of this lack of

1769
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:56,850
the lack of discipline and I think
that's with everything and could be with

1770
01:29:56,851 --> 01:29:58,710
sex.
It could be with gambling,

1771
01:29:58,711 --> 01:30:01,560
it could be with extreme risky
behaviors.

1772
01:30:01,561 --> 01:30:04,350
People could just get,
get real nutty and get carried away with

1773
01:30:04,351 --> 01:30:07,770
things and sometimes those things are
just a big distraction for the lack of

1774
01:30:07,771 --> 01:30:10,230
discipline they have in pursuing their
own goals in life.

1775
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:12,600
I think that that is the real high in
life.

1776
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:15,240
The real high end life is pursuing
difficult things.

1777
01:30:15,250 --> 01:30:16,350
Ratification,
yes,

1778
01:30:16,351 --> 01:30:19,170
getting good at them and then
accomplishing your goals.

1779
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,390
There's A.
There's a high to that that's.

1780
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:24,990
You can't find that in pills.
It doesn't exist in the needle.

1781
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:29,700
That high is a high of discipline and
determination and focus in learning,

1782
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:33,630
but there's so much weakness out there,
especially in a society that has been

1783
01:30:33,631 --> 01:30:38,631
spoiled for so long and you get a trophy
if you don't even show up and you can't

1784
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:42,650
hurt people's feelings and bullied,
get bullied and you're crying.

1785
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:45,630
Should fight and back,
I mean there's so many manifestation of

1786
01:30:45,631 --> 01:30:49,780
a cultural deprivation that runs a muck
in our society that my fear is nice.

1787
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:53,460
Studied all these mass shootings.
Joe,

1788
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:56,850
the Virginia Tech shooter high.
Well,

1789
01:30:56,851 --> 01:30:59,250
they're all buying high.
Yeah,

1790
01:30:59,251 --> 01:31:01,110
but they're all on SSRI.
Yes.

1791
01:31:01,111 --> 01:31:03,130
They're all on pills and
pharmaceuticals.

1792
01:31:03,131 --> 01:31:08,131
Almost all of them are on the PROZAC and
their parents or all of them are

1793
01:31:09,421 --> 01:31:12,750
chemical covering up a kid that shows
enthusiasm.

1794
01:31:12,751 --> 01:31:15,210
It's called an attention disorder now.
I mean,

1795
01:31:15,211 --> 01:31:16,830
if they had that back when I was growing
up,

1796
01:31:16,831 --> 01:31:18,050
I had ended up playing.
I don't know,

1797
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:21,840
I ended up being nosy,
but the problem is the word drugs,

1798
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:24,420
like you and I are drinking coffee.
We're on drugs right now.

1799
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,400
We're on caffeine.
This is a drug.

1800
01:31:26,610 --> 01:31:29,220
There's some drugs that if used
responsibly or.

1801
01:31:29,221 --> 01:31:31,470
Okay.
A glass of wine with dinner is a

1802
01:31:31,471 --> 01:31:32,370
drought.
Understood.

1803
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:34,830
It's a mild drug,
a little tiny Toke

1804
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:41,190
for sex with the Mrs. That's a little
drug and it makes you see I've never

1805
01:31:41,191 --> 01:31:43,940
smoked because I can't smoke.
I get in,

1806
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:46,560
when I shoot my machine guns,
all I do is chew on a Cuban.

1807
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:49,750
I don't really smoke it well.
You can get a little buzz.

1808
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:54,600
Just love it.
Seems to go with brash rainbows.

1809
01:31:54,601 --> 01:31:55,434
When I had that tight,
tight,

1810
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:59,070
tight site,
I was way faster than my best.

1811
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:00,280
My best morning

1812
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,950
with my m four a,
it's a,

1813
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:08,370
it's a [inaudible] carbon.
And I got a pof upper to piston driven.

1814
01:32:09,281 --> 01:32:13,480
So instead of 600 plus rounds,
minutes over 700 rounds a minute and my

1815
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:17,030
$600 to sit,
whether it is way too low,

1816
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:19,120
but they actually had the original,
um,

1817
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:21,860
uh,
Thompson's.

1818
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:26,470
We're 900 rounds a minute and nobody
including sargent rock could control

1819
01:32:26,471 --> 01:32:28,330
that.
So they backed it down to 600,

1820
01:32:28,331 --> 01:32:30,250
but that's 45 and it's got a whole lot
of lift.

1821
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:34,690
My two to three m for my best morning.
And this is how uncle Ted parties,

1822
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:39,880
Apache helicopter M,
four bags of Ammo,

1823
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:44,380
469 hogs.
One day we played videos that you and

1824
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:48,400
pig phillips.
No ridiculous that,

1825
01:32:48,490 --> 01:32:53,490
that is every wild.
But that the pig problem is the one that

1826
01:32:54,731 --> 01:32:58,070
throws in the face of vegans.
That's a weird one because you,

1827
01:32:58,090 --> 01:33:00,880
you got to do something about those
animals because they're going to destroy

1828
01:33:00,881 --> 01:33:01,610
your food.

1829
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:03,430
Sure.
They're going to eat every when we kill

1830
01:33:03,431 --> 01:33:07,240
pigs like that in such mass numbers from
helicopters with machine guns,

1831
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:11,230
we're literally saving the environment,
feeding a lot of people.

1832
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:16,000
We the pork that we process.
Thousands and thousands of people get

1833
01:33:16,001 --> 01:33:18,160
this pure organic port and it's
delicious.

1834
01:33:18,161 --> 01:33:20,590
The best.
The wild pork without white fat,

1835
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,910
dark meat handy.
So.

1836
01:33:22,911 --> 01:33:25,450
So we're saving the environment from the
pig destruction.

1837
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:28,870
We're saving agriculture.
I eat food production from the pig

1838
01:33:28,871 --> 01:33:32,500
destruction.
We're saving tax dollars from hiring

1839
01:33:32,501 --> 01:33:36,580
sharp shooters.
We're saving all wildlife because the

1840
01:33:36,581 --> 01:33:40,180
alternative would have been a
indiscriminate poisoning campaign and

1841
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:43,690
recreating a huge new industry of
helicopter hog hunting.

1842
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:44,401
When?
When?

1843
01:33:44,401 --> 01:33:44,970
When,
when,

1844
01:33:44,970 --> 01:33:48,520
when,
when will copter Haagan serious party

1845
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:50,950
time USA.
And guess who passed that law?

1846
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:52,450
You did.
Thank you very much.

1847
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,010
Again,
me and Chris Cole back.

1848
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:58,780
We were hunting and we weren't allowed
to pay the helicopter pilot by law.

1849
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:03,490
You couldn't be a for profit outfit
unless the government paid him,

1850
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,200
which was so,
so and Texas,

1851
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:09,480
so Kris Kobach,
who was the secretary of state and

1852
01:34:09,481 --> 01:34:12,130
Kansas and was running for governor and
should be governor of Kansas.

1853
01:34:12,340 --> 01:34:17,340
He's a constitutional master and he.
He took the current a pig hunting law

1854
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:19,750
firm,
helicopters that was government

1855
01:34:19,751 --> 01:34:20,590
controlled.
No,

1856
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:24,490
no citizens,
no commercial value whatsoever.

1857
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:28,780
He rewrote it.
We gave it to then Attorney General Greg

1858
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:31,060
Abbott and Governor Perry at the time
and we said,

1859
01:34:31,061 --> 01:34:33,850
this is insane.
This can't be Texas where you get to

1860
01:34:33,851 --> 01:34:35,650
hunt the pigs on our land,
but we can't,

1861
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:39,310
so literally within a week or two,
they passed the law where it became a

1862
01:34:39,311 --> 01:34:42,190
commercial outfit where we,
the people can hunt the pigs out of

1863
01:34:42,191 --> 01:34:44,830
helicopters and it's become a huge
success.

1864
01:34:44,831 --> 01:34:49,180
It's really knocked the shit out of this
dangerous pig population in those areas

1865
01:34:49,330 --> 01:34:53,530
where land owners allow it and give
authorization and if so much fun,

1866
01:34:53,531 --> 01:34:54,430
it's stupid.
Well,

1867
01:34:54,431 --> 01:34:56,500
that's what people need to realize.
You re,

1868
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,160
there's no way to get to them

1869
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,550
in certain circumstances.
There accessible.

1870
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:03,170
There are millions and millions of wild
pigs.

1871
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:05,120
They have three,
four litters a year,

1872
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:08,000
and there's no way to take care of them
naturally.

1873
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:13,520
Unless you gonna let hundreds of
thousands of wolves loose in Texas.

1874
01:35:13,521 --> 01:35:15,970
I'd really don't sit down with them from
the helicopters.

1875
01:35:15,971 --> 01:35:16,804
Yeah,
I mean how.

1876
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:18,430
I mean,
that's what they do in Alaska when they

1877
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:21,710
decimate the care enough to they.
There's no other way to control these

1878
01:35:21,711 --> 01:35:23,390
pigs other than God bless you,
joy.

1879
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:26,020
Not many people know that.
They don't know that and it's a.

1880
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:29,480
it's a real problem when you talk to
people were animal rights activists,

1881
01:35:29,481 --> 01:35:31,610
like,
how do you propose to fix this?

1882
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:32,720
That will like,
well,

1883
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,310
you know,
they shouldn't be here in the first

1884
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:35,960
place.
They're an invasive species that people,

1885
01:35:35,961 --> 01:35:36,830
Bro.
That's fine.

1886
01:35:36,831 --> 01:35:39,110
You're right.
But they're handing over in the 17

1887
01:35:39,111 --> 01:35:40,580
hundreds.
So what do we do?

1888
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:42,020
So.
So arrest.

1889
01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:43,220
Captain Cook.
Yeah,

1890
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:46,870
exactly.
Arrest William Randolph hearst because

1891
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,950
he released a bunch of them are in
northern California.

1892
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:53,570
That's where it starts to hone.
Ranch came from those pigs down and they

1893
01:35:53,571 --> 01:35:55,070
worked their way down and they're
awesome.

1894
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:56,510
They're delicious,
delicious.

1895
01:35:56,870 --> 01:36:00,380
The best pork in the world,
people who eat normal pork have no idea

1896
01:36:00,381 --> 01:36:03,980
what real pork tastes like.
I smoked some for a friend of mine.

1897
01:36:04,330 --> 01:36:05,740
This is insane.
I'm like this.

1898
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:06,910
He's like,
this is insane.

1899
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:08,990
Put it over.
A good coal will coles.

1900
01:36:08,991 --> 01:36:09,980
Yeah,
it's candy.

1901
01:36:09,981 --> 01:36:13,010
Brian did for a few days and here's a
little trick for you.

1902
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:15,610
I.
I'm a vernors Ginger Rail Guide,

1903
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:19,690
Detroit brewed bottled and Ginger,
Detroit vernors.

1904
01:36:19,691 --> 01:36:23,750
It's the only ginger ale without ginger
from the fortunate is full of fructose,

1905
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:26,780
so I don't drink it anymore,
but you can cook with it.

1906
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,690
Next time you Brian,
a slab of pork,

1907
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:33,330
put in a good olive oil and all the
seasons you like,

1908
01:36:33,331 --> 01:36:37,370
but also can have vernors ginger ale
because it's got real ginger and just

1909
01:36:37,371 --> 01:36:41,390
enough sugar in it to affect it and soak
that overnight in a glass dish.

1910
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:45,650
Covered up in a cool like a refrigerator
and then put that sum bitch on some hot

1911
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:47,300
orange,
Kohl's.

1912
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:48,291
I don't care.
Apple,

1913
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:49,400
Cherry,
Mesquite,

1914
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:50,631
Hickory,
whatever.

1915
01:36:50,631 --> 01:36:53,840
You got old.
Doesn't matter and let that song bitch

1916
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:56,890
just singed on the outside.
It's.

1917
01:36:56,950 --> 01:36:58,250
It's food,
sex.

1918
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:01,800
It's your in a wreck,
your palate erection.

1919
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:04,880
You get a culinary boner.
It's so delicious.

1920
01:37:04,881 --> 01:37:06,800
That's what we eat at home.
That's how we eat.

1921
01:37:06,801 --> 01:37:09,890
That's why I'm like this.
Do you ever use a pellet grill?

1922
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:11,360
I haven't,
no.

1923
01:37:11,361 --> 01:37:12,194
My,
um,

1924
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:14,630
my ranch manager,
Chris has got one.

1925
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:16,460
Um,
and he used a big fan of those things

1926
01:37:16,461 --> 01:37:17,810
because it's real wood,
right?

1927
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:20,000
It's just compressed wood shots they
take,

1928
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:24,010
like from making this table should take
that sawdust to compress it down.

1929
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:26,990
But I have all this timber we have at
our properties.

1930
01:37:26,991 --> 01:37:30,470
I like cutting down dead trees and
making my own firewood.

1931
01:37:30,830 --> 01:37:31,990
Is that what you do?
You Cook over here?

1932
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:32,751
Well,
there's a,

1933
01:37:32,751 --> 01:37:33,950
there's something to that,
right?

1934
01:37:33,951 --> 01:37:34,670
Yep.
Yep.

1935
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:36,080
It's the real mccoy.
Yeah.

1936
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:39,040
My,
my taste buds are as sacred as my dick.

1937
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,780
I mean,
I want to make sure I treat my taste

1938
01:37:41,781 --> 01:37:45,080
buds really good.
I consider my life to be like one big

1939
01:37:45,081 --> 01:37:48,920
six foot two,
220 pound purple rim.

1940
01:37:48,921 --> 01:37:53,090
Dick.
I'm susceptible to all influences and

1941
01:37:53,091 --> 01:37:57,660
stimuli and that's where I get this
passion in this happiness everyday.

1942
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:00,930
Spoiled rotten.
I get to hunt everywhere,

1943
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,080
that's what's crazy and I get to rock my
balls off every year.

1944
01:38:04,081 --> 01:38:07,740
So I'm the lucky one in your yard.
You essentially leave your house.

1945
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:10,410
My swamp in Michigan,
I have to close the door quietly because

1946
01:38:10,411 --> 01:38:13,250
I have tree stands really close to the
cabin and it's.

1947
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:15,030
The swamp is,
it's a miracle.

1948
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:18,290
It's just,
I think God loves me more than he loves

1949
01:38:18,291 --> 01:38:22,070
you because you created this place just
for me and it.

1950
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:24,570
It's a,
it's a glacier cut marsh swamp.

1951
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:29,720
Phen phen is no fen fen.
It's a very unique wetland habitat

1952
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:35,640
that's a cross between a marsh and swamp
and a bog and it's the,

1953
01:38:35,641 --> 01:38:37,030
uh,
the uh,

1954
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:41,310
habitat that produces the Mitchells
cetera butterfly environment,

1955
01:38:41,311 --> 01:38:45,690
which is the Christmas tree from and on
my Michigan Fan,

1956
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:49,530
I have the healthiest productivity of
the endangered species,

1957
01:38:49,531 --> 01:38:52,320
Christmas tree fern and Mitchell's
setter.

1958
01:38:52,321 --> 01:38:56,400
Butterfly according to the biologists
and the botanists that visit there every

1959
01:38:56,400 --> 01:39:00,720
year from universities because I killed
lots of critters that would otherwise

1960
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:06,020
denude those touchy for her wild
vegetations.

1961
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:10,650
And that's why a hundred every day up
there,

1962
01:39:10,651 --> 01:39:13,500
I coons and possums and skunks and
beavers,

1963
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:17,010
mink and muskrats and pheasants up the
as I.

1964
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:21,480
I'm the only ground in southern Michigan
that has pheasants because I wage war

1965
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:25,170
environments.
You cannot hurt vomit populations.

1966
01:39:25,171 --> 01:39:27,720
In fact they are drastically under
harvested.

1967
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:30,870
But on mine,
I killed so many egg rate environments

1968
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:34,560
that I have the best biodiversity of
all,

1969
01:39:34,740 --> 01:39:38,520
including the endangered Mitchell
Saturday butterfly and Christmas tree

1970
01:39:38,521 --> 01:39:42,840
fern because I'm a steward who actually
walks the wild ground,

1971
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:47,280
unlike a bureaucrat who looks at the
computer screen and is dnr office and

1972
01:39:47,281 --> 01:39:50,940
makes an assumption of what the model
might indicate instead of what the

1973
01:39:50,941 --> 01:39:55,830
actual wild ground will show you if you
get the fuck off your chair and go walk

1974
01:39:55,831 --> 01:39:56,311
that say,
well,

1975
01:39:56,311 --> 01:39:59,310
that's a big criticism to people or from
people that,

1976
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:02,100
uh,
especially like people in bc that are

1977
01:40:02,101 --> 01:40:06,120
now a part of that grizzly bear band,
unbelievably dishonest.

1978
01:40:06,130 --> 01:40:09,660
They're getting people that live in the
city that don't have any interaction

1979
01:40:09,661 --> 01:40:12,060
with these animals and that these
animals are trouble.

1980
01:40:12,240 --> 01:40:16,050
There's a lot of them.
They're not there can only you can eat

1981
01:40:16,051 --> 01:40:16,860
them too,
by the way.

1982
01:40:16,860 --> 01:40:20,070
I think their stakes bear backstraps
candy,

1983
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:22,860
especially in the spring if they're
eating berries and the grass,

1984
01:40:22,861 --> 01:40:26,340
but the perception is that what you're
doing is trophy hunting,

1985
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:29,010
that you know you're eating,
you're shooting something you don't plan

1986
01:40:29,011 --> 01:40:31,180
on eating,
just to put a hand on you because you're

1987
01:40:31,181 --> 01:40:33,690
a cruel person.
How dishonest can you be?

1988
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:34,950
Well,
they're not talking to the people that

1989
01:40:34,951 --> 01:40:37,140
are in the forest,
the actual people that are on the

1990
01:40:37,141 --> 01:40:37,974
ground,
and that's,

1991
01:40:38,010 --> 01:40:41,520
that's a real part of the problem is
that these laws get passed by these

1992
01:40:41,521 --> 01:40:44,820
people that have no interaction with
this actual environment.

1993
01:40:45,060 --> 01:40:49,260
It's like people who live in a drought
voting on what's going on in your flood.

1994
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:50,281
Yeah.
You know,

1995
01:40:50,281 --> 01:40:53,440
it's like the people in Detroit voting
on wolves in the upper peninsula.

1996
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:54,070
If you don't

1997
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:57,460
live with bull with the wolves,
you don't get say so.

1998
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:00,790
You need to respect the people who live
with the wolves and wolves.

1999
01:41:00,791 --> 01:41:03,730
Don't buy licenses.
Wolves don't buy permits.

2000
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:07,270
Wolves don't pay fees.
Wolves don't have bag limits.

2001
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:11,290
Wolves don't have seasons.
They just like to kill stuff and if you

2002
01:41:11,291 --> 01:41:14,830
have too many wolves,
nobody spending money on deer license or

2003
01:41:14,831 --> 01:41:18,580
bear license or small game hunting,
and the upper peninsula of Michigan has

2004
01:41:18,581 --> 01:41:23,230
been abandoned by a bunch of politically
correct ignorant city jerks who think

2005
01:41:23,231 --> 01:41:26,590
they have to save the endangered wolf.
I want wolves in Michigan,

2006
01:41:26,591 --> 01:41:30,160
but not to the detriment of wildlife
that actually pays for the game

2007
01:41:30,161 --> 01:41:33,460
department to manage it for a sustained
yield productivity,

2008
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:35,710
Duh.
But that's the thing we're talking about

2009
01:41:35,711 --> 01:41:36,101
here,
right?

2010
01:41:36,101 --> 01:41:39,400
Like wildlife management,
like this idea that you have to manage

2011
01:41:39,401 --> 01:41:42,880
the population of pigs.
You also have to like what you're doing

2012
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:44,560
in your place in Michigan.

2013
01:41:44,710 --> 01:41:49,710
You're managing this wildlife to the
ultimate diversity that if you don't

2014
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:54,610
have to deal with walls and if you don't
yet higher tax paid sharp shooters that

2015
01:41:54,611 --> 01:41:58,510
have no respect for the animals at all.
They're just doing a job of killing

2016
01:41:58,511 --> 01:42:00,490
stuff,
which is what they do in California with

2017
01:42:00,491 --> 01:42:04,180
the mountain lions.
Unbelievably irresponsible.

2018
01:42:04,181 --> 01:42:08,680
And here's a challenge and a
condemnation for the California fish and

2019
01:42:08,681 --> 01:42:11,620
game society.
The cod fish and game anymore,

2020
01:42:11,621 --> 01:42:13,210
they call it fish,
fish and wildlife.

2021
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:16,750
Because of that,
how can you go to work everyday,

2022
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:22,680
violating your oath to wildlife science?
How can you force the mountain lion and

2023
01:42:23,741 --> 01:42:28,741
the black bear and California into the
liability column as a game warden,

2024
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:34,260
as a person dedicated to conservation,
how can you violate your wise use oath

2025
01:42:36,670 --> 01:42:41,130
and turn them out in line and the black
bear into a liability because some dirt

2026
01:42:41,131 --> 01:42:46,000
bag in San Francisco think it's unfair
to use hounds or bait for bear and then

2027
01:42:46,001 --> 01:42:50,620
you have to go in and shoot black bears
with tax dollars and buried them in a

2028
01:42:50,621 --> 01:42:54,100
hole in the ground instead of a family
recreational,

2029
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:59,420
a resource that you buy licenses and
fees and permits and guides and

2030
01:42:59,711 --> 01:43:01,180
outfitters,
hotels,

2031
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:03,310
food lodging,
grocery supplies,

2032
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:05,830
butcher's ice,
taxidermists.

2033
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:10,920
None of that happens because the some
liar has forced the wildlife manager,

2034
01:43:12,970 --> 01:43:17,050
wildlife mismanagement of California to
ban mountain lion hunting.

2035
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:20,470
While you continue to kill them as
damage control,

2036
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:22,750
instead of manage them as quality
control.

2037
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:26,440
Shame on the California wildlife
officers.

2038
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,420
Shame on you for not blowing the
whistle.

2039
01:43:28,421 --> 01:43:30,220
It's like,
call me at the FBI,

2040
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:34,660
how dare you walk into that building
that says j Edgar Hoover over the top

2041
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:38,290
and not feel a sense of guilt because j
Edgar Hoover was one of the biggest

2042
01:43:38,291 --> 01:43:42,220
criminal punks that ever walked this
earth and now call me is following in

2043
01:43:42,221 --> 01:43:45,010
his footsteps and I challenged my FBI
buddies.

2044
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:49,200
How did you go all these years without
blowing the whistles on the corruption,

2045
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:52,190
the power abuse and the criminality by
your so

2046
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:54,950
called leaders?
I don't know enough about pussy to

2047
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:57,080
comment,
but I don't know enough about what you

2048
01:43:57,081 --> 01:44:01,020
did do.
I do know because he's a liar and he's.

2049
01:44:01,050 --> 01:44:04,700
He's a.
he's a perjurer and he's a felon and he

2050
01:44:04,701 --> 01:44:07,460
had a.
I'm really angry because I worked with

2051
01:44:07,461 --> 01:44:10,190
the FBI.
I've had to rely on these guys to cover

2052
01:44:10,191 --> 01:44:14,570
my back on on raids and they're great
warriors and they look the other way

2053
01:44:14,571 --> 01:44:17,540
because they're saving their pensions
and instead of blowing the whistles on

2054
01:44:17,541 --> 01:44:19,100
there,
corrupt criminal leaders.

2055
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:20,900
Damn them.
Well,

2056
01:44:20,901 --> 01:44:22,490
I don't know how that relates to
mountain lions.

2057
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:25,700
Like to bring it all back.
Corruption is corruption.

2058
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:28,850
Same thing,
but I was saying I don't think it's

2059
01:44:28,851 --> 01:44:32,300
corruption here,
wildlife officers that I don't think

2060
01:44:32,301 --> 01:44:35,030
they're getting this conversation.
I think there is some that they're

2061
01:44:35,031 --> 01:44:37,800
trying to preserve their jobs.
They don't want to stick their neck out

2062
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:41,170
with a very liberal government,
but you know,

2063
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,390
I think that there's.

2064
01:44:42,510 --> 01:44:46,370
There's a real problem with education
that this conversation doesn't happen in

2065
01:44:46,371 --> 01:44:49,970
most circles.
This understanding of balance,

2066
01:44:50,210 --> 01:44:53,450
of nature of that you really do have to
manage the wardens.

2067
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:56,630
They know what they studied,
they got degrees in it and they defy it

2068
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:58,460
and it's good.
Good about permits.

2069
01:44:58,461 --> 01:45:01,580
After the mountain lion is destroyed,
millions of dollars worth of livestock

2070
01:45:01,581 --> 01:45:04,460
and pets and it scared the shit out of
people and killed people.

2071
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:07,610
Then they kill them,
kill them before they just do the depth.

2072
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:10,340
Supposed to be quality control,
not damage control.

2073
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:13,040
They know the system,
they've abandoned it and they've gone

2074
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:16,490
the political correct denial route and
said that the mountain lions are not

2075
01:45:16,491 --> 01:45:19,940
game animals.
That is a lie.

2076
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:23,270
So the California Game Department are
Liars,

2077
01:45:23,480 --> 01:45:25,700
period.
With the idea of the mount lines on a

2078
01:45:25,701 --> 01:45:27,740
game.
Animal comes from people that have never

2079
01:45:27,741 --> 01:45:28,660
eaten one.
Yeah,

2080
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:30,980
the estimate backstrap.

2081
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:32,900
Most people don't know.
I've never eaten one,

2082
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:35,570
but I know people that have he
delicious,

2083
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:37,620
delicious,
which beautiful p.

2084
01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:38,970
You hear,
you tell that to people and they go,

2085
01:45:38,971 --> 01:45:40,090
wait a minute.
What I can bear.

2086
01:45:40,091 --> 01:45:42,710
A lot of people don't think eat bears.
Eat Berries.

2087
01:45:42,711 --> 01:45:44,300
You dirt bag.
Who doesn't know this?

2088
01:45:44,301 --> 01:45:45,800
Wake up.
A lot of people don't know they're

2089
01:45:45,801 --> 01:45:47,600
idiots.
I've had conversations with people

2090
01:45:47,601 --> 01:45:51,320
because I'm 100 bears that no one has
gotten more mad at me at anything I've

2091
01:45:51,321 --> 01:45:53,360
ever done.
Then when I killed a bear,

2092
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:54,260
good,
good for you.

2093
01:45:54,700 --> 01:45:57,860
That you pissed.
If you're not pissing off the assholes,

2094
01:45:57,861 --> 01:46:00,050
you're an asshole,
but it's people that don't understand

2095
01:46:00,051 --> 01:46:02,890
what a bear is not around.
Then they don't understand.

2096
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:06,470
I recommend shut the fuck up.
Go do a little research and come back

2097
01:46:06,471 --> 01:46:08,150
when you have some knowledge.
Until then,

2098
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:09,223
suck my dick.

2099
01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:12,500
No,
it's better to just explain to them what

2100
01:46:12,501 --> 01:46:15,570
it is and I see it over and over again.
Refused.

2101
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:18,340
They refused to listen.
Yeah,

2102
01:46:18,360 --> 01:46:20,120
they.
They liked their ignorance.

2103
01:46:20,210 --> 01:46:25,040
They go to maniacal levels to protect
their ignorance because it feels good

2104
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:28,040
because it's booboo.
It's really a tune.

2105
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:30,590
I respect animals,
so I'm going to reduce them to the level

2106
01:46:30,591 --> 01:46:32,630
of a cartoon.
What's also weird too,

2107
01:46:32,631 --> 01:46:37,610
because there was a deprivation permit
that was issued for a mountain lion in

2108
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:42,410
Malibu because it was killing the got to
this Alpaca farm and just went fucking

2109
01:46:42,411 --> 01:46:44,890
crazy.
Like 10 Alpaca and Alpaca.

2110
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:45,793
Yum.
Yeah,

2111
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,500
just fucked.
I didn't even eat.

2112
01:46:47,501 --> 01:46:49,710
I'm just fucked him off.
They laid lines to kill.

2113
01:46:49,711 --> 01:46:50,160
I'm a

2114
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,340
big fan,
so a deprivation depredation permit was

2115
01:46:53,341 --> 01:46:55,960
issued so this.
They destroyed a bunch of livestock so

2116
01:46:55,980 --> 01:47:00,980
this lady could kill this cat that had
been really qualified,

2117
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:04,500
so she was going to hire somebody,
but then she got all these death

2118
01:47:04,501 --> 01:47:06,570
threats,
which is hilarious,

2119
01:47:06,571 --> 01:47:08,490
but here's the thing,
people say they love animals.

2120
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:10,280
Well,
you obviously don't love these Alpine

2121
01:47:11,120 --> 01:47:13,370
lions coming in and fucking killing them
all the time.

2122
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:16,410
The way they die,
a slow death because the lion just bites

2123
01:47:16,411 --> 01:47:19,590
them and let them bleed to death and
flop around for a couple hours and then

2124
01:47:19,591 --> 01:47:21,600
goes to the one that's next to it.
He's just trying to get away.

2125
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:26,670
It's the ignorance is staggering and
that's why I continue to fight it.

2126
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:27,930
It's convenient,
right?

2127
01:47:27,931 --> 01:47:29,250
It's like,
we love animals.

2128
01:47:29,251 --> 01:47:30,420
We don't want to kill this mountain
lion.

2129
01:47:30,421 --> 01:47:31,980
Okay,
well if you love animals,

2130
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:35,460
you'll let them kill this one mountain
line that's obviously targeting these

2131
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:37,860
pets because this is not hunting.

2132
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:39,390
By the way.
You know why they're mountain lion is

2133
01:47:39,391 --> 01:47:42,360
targeting the pests because there's too
many mountain lions and the dominant

2134
01:47:42,361 --> 01:47:46,200
males have run all the other mountain
lions out of ideal habitat into your

2135
01:47:46,201 --> 01:47:49,260
neighborhood because you didn't harvest
the surplus.

2136
01:47:49,350 --> 01:47:51,300
Now the surplus is coming into your
home.

2137
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:55,530
Now it's a liability because you were
too stupid to keep it in the asset

2138
01:47:55,531 --> 01:47:58,020
column.
It's absolutely sinful.

2139
01:47:59,370 --> 01:48:01,980
People have accomplished.
They have a pond over it to hone ranch.

2140
01:48:01,981 --> 01:48:04,560
They have a game camera,
the trail camera on that pond.

2141
01:48:04,561 --> 01:48:07,290
They got 16 different mountain lions are
in that camera.

2142
01:48:07,330 --> 01:48:09,840
Then they're not allowed to do damn
thing and it's hard to find deer.

2143
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,970
It's hard to find deer here.
It's like it's nothing.

2144
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:13,620
I mean,
the one thing is good people aren't

2145
01:48:13,621 --> 01:48:17,520
dying in car accidents with deer,
but if you see a deer in California,

2146
01:48:17,521 --> 01:48:17,990
it's.

2147
01:48:17,990 --> 01:48:19,370
It's pretty rare,
but again,

2148
01:48:19,371 --> 01:48:21,950
there's plenty of cattle.
I fly over California.

2149
01:48:21,951 --> 01:48:23,180
I Love California,
man.

2150
01:48:23,181 --> 01:48:25,600
My blood brothers live out here.
We're having the greatest conscience.

2151
01:48:25,610 --> 01:48:29,360
My late last night in San Juan
Capistrano firestorm tonight,

2152
01:48:29,540 --> 01:48:32,660
tomorrow night we're in Pasadena,
and then we'd go to a Gore hills.

2153
01:48:33,310 --> 01:48:34,460
Clear Rita.
Yeah,

2154
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:38,900
and then we go to big bear and then we
go to reno and we'd go to Iowa and Ohio

2155
01:48:38,901 --> 01:48:42,110
and Pennsylvania and know we're all over
the country and I fly in a little plane

2156
01:48:42,470 --> 01:48:47,270
over the country and it's God's country.
It's wildlife habitat.

2157
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:52,460
It eternally all across this country and
California is one of the most beautiful

2158
01:48:52,461 --> 01:48:56,780
wilderness states in the world,
and because mountain lions have been

2159
01:48:56,990 --> 01:49:00,920
irresponsibly mismanaged,
now you have a destruction of the

2160
01:49:00,921 --> 01:49:05,870
wildlife in the deer category and those
small game and other game because the

2161
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:07,910
mountain lions are in the liability
column.

2162
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:12,080
If you reduce the mountain lion numbers,
then hunters will pay for the deer

2163
01:49:12,081 --> 01:49:15,830
licenses which pay for the game
departments in the scientists to manage

2164
01:49:15,831 --> 01:49:19,490
the wildlife sea.
We have balanced California is him

2165
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,510
balanced.
It's out of balance because of the lie

2166
01:49:23,511 --> 01:49:28,460
of the animal rights that have effect
how the wildlife officers of this

2167
01:49:28,461 --> 01:49:32,390
country,
except that bullshit is just a crime.

2168
01:49:32,660 --> 01:49:37,660
They should stand up and go your wrong.
This is a renewable wildlife research

2169
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:42,380
resource and we're going to have a
season on it because now we're killing

2170
01:49:42,381 --> 01:49:44,390
them as damage control.
They're still dying.

2171
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,790
We're killing them.
We're taking millions of dollars to

2172
01:49:46,810 --> 01:49:48,010
compensate the Lama and the

2173
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:51,160
Alpaca and the cattle and the sheep and
the goat and the horse.

2174
01:49:51,330 --> 01:49:54,910
We're millions of dollars compensating
and then we're going to kill the lion

2175
01:49:54,911 --> 01:49:56,020
and bury it.
No,

2176
01:49:56,021 --> 01:49:57,490
you don't get to eat it.
No.

2177
01:49:57,491 --> 01:50:00,670
You don't get to spend any money and
provide game department,

2178
01:50:00,671 --> 01:50:01,840
finances.
No.

2179
01:50:01,841 --> 01:50:05,740
You don't get to go to hotels and travel
and food and lodging and supplies and

2180
01:50:05,741 --> 01:50:09,640
sporting goods and taxidermist.
You don't get to increase the economy of

2181
01:50:09,641 --> 01:50:11,920
the entire area because of one mountain
lion hunt.

2182
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:17,040
We're going to take your tax dollars and
compensate all the dead livestock and

2183
01:50:17,291 --> 01:50:20,350
then we're going to hire a guy to kill
the mountain lion Joe.

2184
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:23,470
Dig a hole,
which by the we're going to take your

2185
01:50:23,471 --> 01:50:25,390
tax dollars to hire a guy with a front
loader,

2186
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:30,720
dig a hole and bury.
Don't put this magnificent animal public

2187
01:50:31,151 --> 01:50:33,660
perception.
It's because of the average person like

2188
01:50:33,810 --> 01:50:34,990
you saved precept chunks.

2189
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:36,880
I have dogs.
It's not perception.

2190
01:50:36,881 --> 01:50:41,881
It's ignorance and it's
this perception that does come from

2191
01:50:42,161 --> 01:50:45,700
ignorance is that we love animals.
Like I have a dog.

2192
01:50:45,701 --> 01:50:47,470
You have dogs.
I've lived for my.

2193
01:50:47,471 --> 01:50:48,700
Yeah,
I have three dogs.

2194
01:50:48,730 --> 01:50:50,170
We love dogs.
Can't live without them.

2195
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:51,370
You go home,
you pat them.

2196
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:54,340
People that don't have any interaction
whatsoever with wildlife.

2197
01:50:54,341 --> 01:50:56,080
Think of animals like they think of
their dog.

2198
01:50:56,081 --> 01:50:58,750
I don't want anything to document and
then you hear about a mountain lion

2199
01:50:58,751 --> 01:50:59,021
like,
oh,

2200
01:50:59,021 --> 01:51:01,270
why would you kill them?
Outlined mind you're being cruel,

2201
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:03,820
like you would only kill them.
Outline if you're one of those dickless

2202
01:51:03,821 --> 01:51:07,420
assholes and once I go to Africa and
shoot a line and the head mounted on

2203
01:51:07,421 --> 01:51:10,510
your wall just because.
But this is the thought process behind

2204
01:51:10,511 --> 01:51:14,950
it and there's no pushback because the
public speaks and then I pushed back in

2205
01:51:14,951 --> 01:51:15,580
the attack.

2206
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:19,630
They attack you bring it on,
bring it up because ignorance bounces

2207
01:51:19,631 --> 01:51:22,150
off of me.
Like personal hygiene from Michael

2208
01:51:22,150 --> 01:51:24,640
Moore.
It just has no impact whatsoever.

2209
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:28,930
I think he washes you don't think God
what a.

2210
01:51:29,050 --> 01:51:30,080
What a swine.
He.

2211
01:51:30,140 --> 01:51:33,010
That's a subhuman Mongrel.
If I ever saw I met him,

2212
01:51:33,011 --> 01:51:34,540
he was in this guy.
He's a prick.

2213
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:36,290
He's a liar.
What do you think?

2214
01:51:36,291 --> 01:51:38,410
He's a scam artist.
Like gun control.

2215
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:40,180
Well,
how about the fact that he put together

2216
01:51:40,181 --> 01:51:42,850
that move,
that so documented that Hollywood

2217
01:51:42,851 --> 01:51:47,110
actually gave them an award and he
copied and pasted out of sequence the

2218
01:51:47,111 --> 01:51:50,350
attack on the grid.
Charlton Heston claiming he was somehow

2219
01:51:50,351 --> 01:51:54,910
responsible for the little child killing
herself with you're paroled felon,

2220
01:51:54,911 --> 01:51:58,120
father's gun,
and they put it out of sequence and

2221
01:51:58,210 --> 01:52:01,750
attributed.
Charlton Heston defending such

2222
01:52:01,780 --> 01:52:05,080
irresponsible gun ownership.
Michael Moore is a line,

2223
01:52:05,170 --> 01:52:07,780
cruel,
stoned punk,

2224
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:10,090
as he stoned constantly all day.

2225
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:13,450
All the time.
I think he used the suppositories.

2226
01:52:14,950 --> 01:52:17,090
I don't know him.
I do and I.

2227
01:52:17,240 --> 01:52:19,060
He's a punk.
Has He ever had a conversation?

2228
01:52:19,061 --> 01:52:19,580
Got.
Yeah.

2229
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:23,290
I was on his TV show and I was
responsible for ending his TV show

2230
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:25,510
because he tried to fuck with me and I
don't know if you'd noticed you,

2231
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:28,450
but I'm unfuckable you.
Fuck with me.

2232
01:52:28,451 --> 01:52:31,810
I'll eat your family tree and shit.
Saw dust into your face.

2233
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:35,470
Ask Pierce Morgan.
That seems like I saw your compensation.

2234
01:52:35,471 --> 01:52:38,140
Not even close.
I was arm wrestling a torso.

2235
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:39,550
Well,
the Pierce Morgan.

2236
01:52:39,551 --> 01:52:41,290
The problem is he didn't understand the
facts.

2237
01:52:41,291 --> 01:52:43,620
When you talk about gun violence,
he didn't understand how much of

2238
01:52:43,621 --> 01:52:45,440
guidelines.
In fact he knew them.

2239
01:52:45,441 --> 01:52:46,050
He avoided

2240
01:52:46,050 --> 01:52:46,760
him.
That's true.

2241
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:47,800
Absolutely.
Plus,

2242
01:52:47,801 --> 01:52:50,690
we explain what we're talking about
because when you say the numbers of gun

2243
01:52:50,691 --> 01:52:53,630
violence,
a giant percentage of murder suicide,

2244
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:57,210
a giant percentage of them are cops
killing bad guys and citizens defendant.

2245
01:52:58,190 --> 01:53:02,660
So all of those are out of the.
And then accidental gun deaths may have

2246
01:53:02,661 --> 01:53:06,020
summarized it for you.
So Pierce Morgan fancies himself a

2247
01:53:06,021 --> 01:53:08,780
cookie,
rather woody limey usually got the

2248
01:53:08,781 --> 01:53:11,270
accent and everything.
It's funny little Matt actually an

2249
01:53:11,271 --> 01:53:12,500
accent.
It's an impediment.

2250
01:53:13,190 --> 01:53:13,521
But,
uh,

2251
01:53:13,521 --> 01:53:16,850
he came out and of course he's going to
take on the motor city madman.

2252
01:53:16,851 --> 01:53:18,500
I mean this guy is going to be easy
pickins.

2253
01:53:18,501 --> 01:53:23,180
He actually wrote Wango tango be all
intellectually this thing you're doing,

2254
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:29,520
that's the limey.
You've got manufactured confidence based

2255
01:53:29,631 --> 01:53:33,860
on nothing except an ego that has no
foundation.

2256
01:53:33,861 --> 01:53:35,360
In fact.
So Pierce Morgan,

2257
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:40,220
the CNN exec,
so when it's put Pierce Morgan on the

2258
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:44,540
Motor City Madman in a gun store to the
first time you didn't see the first one

2259
01:53:44,541 --> 01:53:46,590
at the CNN officers,
that's the best thing.

2260
01:53:46,590 --> 01:53:48,440
Both of them,
that's the best one.

2261
01:53:49,370 --> 01:53:54,370
And so they think I'm a dirt bag and in
a goof ball because I not only wrote

2262
01:53:54,741 --> 01:53:56,870
Wang Dang sweet poon Tang,
I meant it,

2263
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:01,700
but when they take me on they don't
realize I never went to college because

2264
01:54:01,701 --> 01:54:05,120
I was too busy learning shit.
And if you take me on,

2265
01:54:05,121 --> 01:54:08,390
on any subject that I am even slightly
aware of,

2266
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:13,340
I will fuck you up because I've studied
this stuff.

2267
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:17,150
I've lived this stuff.
I've been with guns since I could walk.

2268
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:22,360
I have had universal unlimited access to
fire power my whole life,

2269
01:54:22,850 --> 01:54:26,810
both in a recreational,
a disciplined,

2270
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:31,960
a law enforcement military training,
and just a family plinking competition.

2271
01:54:32,990 --> 01:54:37,990
So when every considerable,
a imaginable gun use,

2272
01:54:38,690 --> 01:54:42,410
I've been 68 years of it.
Um,

2273
01:54:42,740 --> 01:54:47,740
so they sick Pierce Morgan Ami to teach
me a lesson about how irresponsible gun

2274
01:54:48,441 --> 01:54:50,870
owners are and that if we could just ban
guns,

2275
01:54:50,871 --> 01:54:52,370
that all the violence would end.

2276
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:55,460
And of course,
if you haven't seen it,

2277
01:54:55,461 --> 01:54:58,070
you got to google it because it was his.
What's his take?

2278
01:54:58,370 --> 01:54:59,200
Well,
I've,

2279
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,640
I almost fixed them,
um,

2280
01:55:02,150 --> 01:55:06,830
because I so overwhelmed them with
evidence that they finally research and

2281
01:55:06,831 --> 01:55:10,130
realized that every word out of my mouth
was absolutely indisputable.

2282
01:55:10,131 --> 01:55:11,960
What was most compelling that you were
saying to him?

2283
01:55:12,010 --> 01:55:13,910
I'll,
I'll summarize it this way.

2284
01:55:13,911 --> 01:55:18,170
Like I did the pierce.
The anti gunners have their dream.

2285
01:55:18,590 --> 01:55:22,670
It exists.
It existed in a Paris where all those

2286
01:55:22,671 --> 01:55:24,610
people were shot with coalition of
coughs,

2287
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:28,040
coalition to costs were banned.
They have their dream.

2288
01:55:28,041 --> 01:55:31,520
Pierce morgans dream exists.
It's called a gun free zone.

2289
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:34,490
Virginia Tech,
Columbine,

2290
01:55:34,910 --> 01:55:37,250
Sandy Hook,
Aurora,

2291
01:55:37,850 --> 01:55:42,740
Parklin every instance where the most
innocent lives have been,

2292
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:47,250
had been a Nancy Pelosi,
maxine waters,

2293
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:49,950
Eric holder,
Hillary Clinton,

2294
01:55:49,951 --> 01:55:54,951
Barack Obama's dream.
Their dream is a gun free zone,

2295
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:57,660
but we're free.
People are forced,

2296
01:55:57,810 --> 01:56:02,810
forced into unarmed helplessness where
the most innocent lives are lost and

2297
01:56:03,450 --> 01:56:08,450
that dream has produced more carnage and
destroyed lives than anything in the

2298
01:56:09,121 --> 01:56:13,260
world compared to the NRA convention
where you have the highest incidence of

2299
01:56:13,261 --> 01:56:16,530
gun ownership or opening day of deer
season in Michigan where you have 100

2300
01:56:16,531 --> 01:56:19,560
percent gun ownership and access where
nobody gets hurt.

2301
01:56:20,310 --> 01:56:23,730
So if you know that your dream is a gun
free zone and that's where the most

2302
01:56:23,731 --> 01:56:28,680
innocent lives are lost,
what kind of demonic dirt bag would

2303
01:56:28,740 --> 01:56:31,350
actually want more?

2304
01:56:31,410 --> 01:56:32,243
Well,
let me stop.

2305
01:56:32,410 --> 01:56:35,100
Let me stop being kids position or
anybody's position.

2306
01:56:35,101 --> 01:56:38,430
On the other side.
You would say the real gun free zone

2307
01:56:38,431 --> 01:56:42,120
would be no one having access to the gun
that killed those people in the gun free

2308
01:56:42,121 --> 01:56:43,710
zone,
a gun free zone,

2309
01:56:43,770 --> 01:56:47,670
and the real and the real answer to
drownings in America would be the band

2310
01:56:47,671 --> 01:56:50,460
water.
And you work on banning water.

2311
01:56:50,461 --> 01:56:53,640
I'll work on banning guns and we'll
touch base every few weeks and see how

2312
01:56:53,910 --> 01:56:58,260
you can not banned.
You cannot eliminate guns.

2313
01:56:58,261 --> 01:57:00,870
Finland,
you cannot eliminate guns.

2314
01:57:01,050 --> 01:57:02,490
Uh,
Alberta Canada,

2315
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:05,010
where the guy who came into the
University of shot everybody up.

2316
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:07,500
It's impossible.
So what you do,

2317
01:57:07,501 --> 01:57:12,501
instead of thinking you could ban water,
learn to swim and watch your children by

2318
01:57:14,011 --> 01:57:15,810
the pool.
Call me weird.

2319
01:57:15,960 --> 01:57:20,960
But the way to handle violence is to
carry a gun practice with it.

2320
01:57:21,330 --> 01:57:24,330
And when someone brings lethal force
against you,

2321
01:57:24,510 --> 01:57:25,960
shoot the motherfucker.

2322
01:57:25,990 --> 01:57:29,920
But people are very uncomfortable with
the idea of any society,

2323
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:31,740
comfortable babies.
Sorry,

2324
01:57:31,741 --> 01:57:34,500
you're uncomfortable that go ahead and
bend over and die.

2325
01:57:34,530 --> 01:57:36,750
But you know what I'm saying.
I know what you're saying,

2326
01:57:36,751 --> 01:57:39,750
but wouldn't it be better if there
weren't any concern that the.

2327
01:57:39,770 --> 01:57:42,150
The,
the idea is to somehow enter the

2328
01:57:42,151 --> 01:57:44,370
takeaway,
the concern of people being shot

2329
01:57:44,550 --> 01:57:48,300
randomly by some psycho that you've got
to figure out if you get all the guns

2330
01:57:48,301 --> 01:57:50,070
away,
how do you get all the guns away?

2331
01:57:50,071 --> 01:57:50,821
Oh No.
I don't know.

2332
01:57:50,821 --> 01:57:52,830
But this is what I'm saying is that you
don't know.

2333
01:57:52,831 --> 01:57:54,430
So let's just start.
If they're not,

2334
01:57:54,730 --> 01:57:57,300
if it's not that,
then everybody's got guns to shoot.

2335
01:57:57,301 --> 01:57:58,830
Nobody.
Everybody will not have guns.

2336
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:00,090
Some people have guns.

2337
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:03,030
Some people here.
I studied San Bernardino.

2338
01:58:03,150 --> 01:58:05,310
I studied at Aurora.
I started at Virginia Tech.

2339
01:58:05,311 --> 01:58:07,650
I studied columbine.
I studied sandy hook.

2340
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:11,220
I studied them all.
Do you know joe and everybody better

2341
01:58:11,221 --> 01:58:14,220
write this down because I'm the only guy
that will tell you this.

2342
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:17,640
I've studied the cadence,
the bullet manufacturers,

2343
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:20,450
the rate of fire,
the movement of the purpose,

2344
01:58:20,850 --> 01:58:25,850
and the movement of the victims.
In every instance,

2345
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:30,040
including in Connecticut,
including Aurora,

2346
01:58:30,250 --> 01:58:32,320
including San Bernardino,
right here,

2347
01:58:33,310 --> 01:58:38,310
there were American citizens who would
have had a gun on their person if they

2348
01:58:38,931 --> 01:58:43,931
were allowed to and they could have been
a meaningful force to at least reduce,

2349
01:58:44,201 --> 01:58:48,130
if not terminate the violent murderous
threat,

2350
01:58:48,550 --> 01:58:53,550
but by law we have been so dumbed down
and so forced against our natural

2351
01:58:56,590 --> 01:59:01,590
survival instinct to have a tool on our
belt that in every instance where the

2352
01:59:02,711 --> 01:59:06,490
most innocent lives were slaughtered,
those people that would have intervened

2353
01:59:06,491 --> 01:59:07,570
with a firearm.

2354
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:09,640
Not many of them,
but there was a janitor.

2355
01:59:09,820 --> 01:59:11,710
There was a couple of guys in the
office.

2356
01:59:11,711 --> 01:59:14,350
They had concealed weapons permits,
but they weren't allowed to have in that

2357
01:59:14,351 --> 01:59:16,000
building.
In Virginia Tech,

2358
01:59:16,001 --> 01:59:18,280
there were guys that had concealed
weapons permits,

2359
01:59:18,281 --> 01:59:20,170
but they weren't allowed to have them
there in Aurora,

2360
01:59:20,171 --> 01:59:21,700
Colorado.
Are you kidding me?

2361
01:59:21,910 --> 01:59:24,910
All kinds of people would have had guns.
They could have returned fire,

2362
01:59:24,970 --> 01:59:27,760
but they were forced into unarmed
helplessness.

2363
01:59:27,910 --> 01:59:29,500
Here,
here's the gun debate.

2364
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:32,050
In it's con,
irrefutable conclusion,

2365
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:37,000
if you are forced into unarmed
helplessness,

2366
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:42,420
you are unarmed and helpless.
What a horrible,

2367
01:59:43,030 --> 01:59:47,470
irresponsible,
suicidal condition that in.

2368
01:59:47,710 --> 01:59:49,510
I'm just a guitar player,
Joe.

2369
01:59:50,380 --> 01:59:54,250
I've never been on armed since I
graduated from high school.

2370
01:59:54,830 --> 01:59:59,810
I've always had a hanky and a pocket
full of guitar picks and a pocket knife

2371
01:59:59,811 --> 02:00:04,130
and a belt knife and built tool and a
pistol and some extra bullets.

2372
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:07,670
I just have them everywhere I go.
I've never been on armed.

2373
02:00:07,671 --> 02:00:10,300
I find it.
How do you travel around?

2374
02:00:12,130 --> 02:00:13,090
I improvise,
adapt,

2375
02:00:13,091 --> 02:00:16,570
and overcome.
I luckily I helped pass house resolution

2376
02:00:16,571 --> 02:00:18,760
to 18,
which means all sworn law enforcement

2377
02:00:18,761 --> 02:00:20,800
officer allowed to carry a gun
nationwide.

2378
02:00:21,010 --> 02:00:25,390
I've been a sheriff deputy since 1984
and my credentials allow me to carry a

2379
02:00:25,391 --> 02:00:27,970
gun everywhere I go and I carry a gun
everywhere I go.

2380
02:00:28,090 --> 02:00:29,290
In fact,
even in England,

2381
02:00:29,490 --> 02:00:31,750
uh,
American law enforcement are allowed to

2382
02:00:31,751 --> 02:00:34,450
carry guns and I carry a gun over there.
It's just a tool.

2383
02:00:34,570 --> 02:00:36,700
If somebody comes up and we carry a gun
in England.

2384
02:00:36,850 --> 02:00:38,800
Yeah,
eat some dirt bag.

2385
02:00:38,801 --> 02:00:41,980
Comes at me with a spike in the board.
I'll just shoot them,

2386
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:44,920
but why not?
What's plan b?

2387
02:00:45,550 --> 02:00:46,310
No,
I.

2388
02:00:46,310 --> 02:00:51,310
I agree that it's better to be better,
to have it and not need it than to need

2389
02:00:51,801 --> 02:00:55,400
it and not to have been.
The thing that we would all like to have

2390
02:00:55,430 --> 02:00:58,700
is no school shootings,
no mass shootings,

2391
02:00:58,701 --> 02:01:00,590
no reward,
no columbine,

2392
02:01:00,591 --> 02:01:02,180
no.
So how do you stop that?

2393
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:04,310
Do you think you stopped that with more
guns?

2394
02:01:04,330 --> 02:01:08,030
Where do you think you stopped that with
mental health education,

2395
02:01:08,031 --> 02:01:10,550
figuring out how to get people off of
pills,

2396
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:13,940
figuring out how to keep people from
living despondent lives where they want

2397
02:01:13,941 --> 02:01:17,750
to just tear it all down and shoot
everybody in her hurt a bunch of people.

2398
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:18,471
Well,
here we are.

2399
02:01:18,471 --> 02:01:19,430
That's the route,
right?

2400
02:01:19,460 --> 02:01:20,150
Sure.
Here we are.

2401
02:01:20,150 --> 02:01:20,190
We are

2402
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:25,190
2018 so we can't go back in history in
find the goofball from Virginia Tech and

2403
02:01:27,181 --> 02:01:30,930
what motivated him.
We can't go back there because we have

2404
02:01:30,931 --> 02:01:35,931
failed as a society to take care of
people or respond with any sense of

2405
02:01:36,001 --> 02:01:40,040
responsibility or effectiveness to the
glaring

2406
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:45,040
danger signs most outrageously in
Parkland where the guy called the cops

2407
02:01:47,090 --> 02:01:50,160
42 times,
called the FBI three times that guys

2408
02:01:50,190 --> 02:01:51,890
going to shoot up the school.
Okay.

2409
02:01:51,891 --> 02:01:52,850
We'll make a note of that.
No,

2410
02:01:52,851 --> 02:01:55,880
the guy's going to shoot up the school.
Okay.

2411
02:01:55,881 --> 02:01:59,360
We'll make a note of that.
The guy is bringing a gun to school to

2412
02:01:59,361 --> 02:02:01,340
shoot people.
Here's his manifesto.

2413
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:04,850
We've made a note of that.
What are you kidding me?

2414
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,840
So now if we go for them to do something
until someone does something which not.

2415
02:02:09,770 --> 02:02:10,351
No,
no,

2416
02:02:10,351 --> 02:02:12,050
it's not.
I don't think it's a failure of law

2417
02:02:12,051 --> 02:02:14,340
enforcement.
I had put matter.

2418
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:17,570
It's just a shooting two hours ago.
Oh Jesus Christ.

2419
02:02:17,571 --> 02:02:19,940
Another one,
five people are dead and multiple people

2420
02:02:19,950 --> 02:02:20,720
are.
Where?

2421
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:22,470
Annapolis,
Maryland at a Oh,

2422
02:02:22,480 --> 02:02:24,320
Maryland.
Where no one's allowed to have a gun by

2423
02:02:24,321 --> 02:02:26,410
the way.
Maryland to a newsroom and shot a bunch

2424
02:02:26,411 --> 02:02:27,244
of reporters.

2425
02:02:27,880 --> 02:02:29,380
How much cheese?
A bit.

2426
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:32,840
It was a gun free zone.
Annapolis newsroom shooting leaves.

2427
02:02:32,841 --> 02:02:35,060
Five people dead.
Suspect in custody.

2428
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:36,680
A newsroom.
Yeah.

2429
02:02:37,170 --> 02:02:39,000
Well,
there's my point.

2430
02:02:39,001 --> 02:02:41,510
So I made a newsroom and I'm ready to
rock.

2431
02:02:41,511 --> 02:02:43,850
I'd rather be sitting where you are,
but I figured you got me covered.

2432
02:02:44,030 --> 02:02:48,110
My point is is that the cat is already
out of the bag,

2433
02:02:48,111 --> 02:02:50,930
but
it's not too late.

2434
02:02:52,580 --> 02:02:55,850
Columbine guys,
glaring signals,

2435
02:02:55,851 --> 02:02:58,790
red alarms going off over Virginia Tech
Guy.

2436
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:03,020
Red Alarms going off for years,
but the columbine thing is a difficult

2437
02:03:03,021 --> 02:03:06,560
one because it really hadn't happened
before that no one expected it,

2438
02:03:06,650 --> 02:03:11,650
but the parents walked through the
garage for three years where the bomb

2439
02:03:11,811 --> 02:03:13,940
making materials were on the table.
Yeah,

2440
02:03:13,941 --> 02:03:16,880
they weren't.
The best parents guys were like zombies.

2441
02:03:16,881 --> 02:03:21,881
These guys were like doper freaks from
Bonzai Zulu land maniacs.

2442
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:25,280
Well,
he's just.

2443
02:03:25,281 --> 02:03:26,330
He's just different.

2444
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:26,961
No,
he's not.

2445
02:03:26,961 --> 02:03:29,600
He's freaky.
We need to sit down with this guy and

2446
02:03:29,601 --> 02:03:32,270
get him some healthy.
Aurora guy told his psychiatrist.

2447
02:03:32,450 --> 02:03:35,930
My goal is to shoot as many people as
possible and the psychiatrist didn't say

2448
02:03:35,931 --> 02:03:38,420
anything really.
It's on record.

2449
02:03:38,450 --> 02:03:43,130
He said it in numerous visits with his
psychiatrist that he had threatened his

2450
02:03:43,131 --> 02:03:47,360
golden life was to kill as many people
as possible and he's now got his new ar

2451
02:03:47,361 --> 02:03:50,120
15 to do it with and the psychiatrist
didn't say anything.

2452
02:03:50,121 --> 02:03:53,510
I've studied this stuff.
We need to not only see something,

2453
02:03:53,511 --> 02:03:55,610
say something,
we're missing the part,

2454
02:03:55,611 --> 02:04:00,611
the final part do something when this
kind of abberant threatening violent red

2455
02:04:02,271 --> 02:04:07,271
alarm behaviors going off.
Inter veen sit down with this kid at the

2456
02:04:07,851 --> 02:04:12,200
first instance when your kid comes home,
all glassy eyed and goofy and

2457
02:04:12,201 --> 02:04:16,670
incommunicable and showing weird signs
like the sandy hook guide he had all his

2458
02:04:16,671 --> 02:04:20,680
life and the Aurora guy did all his life
and the Parkland guys.

2459
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:24,520
I'm being all staring like a.
When blinken a sandstorm,

2460
02:04:24,730 --> 02:04:26,930
somebody go.
I know I would.

2461
02:04:27,140 --> 02:04:31,490
I mean in my life with her as musicians
or family members are going,

2462
02:04:31,491 --> 02:04:35,570
are you going to write what is going on?
You look like you're going to shit

2463
02:04:35,571 --> 02:04:36,321
yourself,
man.

2464
02:04:36,321 --> 02:04:38,640
Are you okay?
Didn't have that conversation with

2465
02:04:38,641 --> 02:04:41,430
somebody like the psychiatrist did to
the Aurora shooter.

2466
02:04:41,431 --> 02:04:43,470
Didn't mean how do you fix these people?
I mean,

2467
02:04:44,130 --> 02:04:48,090
what you're saying is if you have no gun
free zones and people allowed to have

2468
02:04:48,091 --> 02:04:49,410
guns,
at least they'll have an ability to

2469
02:04:49,411 --> 02:04:51,000
defend themselves.
I agree with you.

2470
02:04:51,180 --> 02:04:54,270
I agree with you on that,
but how do you stop it from happening in

2471
02:04:54,271 --> 02:04:57,060
the first place?
The anti gun people say the way to stop

2472
02:04:57,061 --> 02:05:00,780
it is to have no guns available to
civilians that can do things virtually

2473
02:05:00,781 --> 02:05:02,700
impossible.
A porsche.

2474
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:04,890
So what we're dealing with just
pragmatically,

2475
02:05:04,891 --> 02:05:09,360
when you look at 300 million people and
probably 400 million guns,

2476
02:05:09,361 --> 02:05:10,710
but you haven't counted mine yet.

2477
02:05:11,230 --> 02:05:14,640
I mean,
how many guns for every guy like you

2478
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:16,940
that has hundreds of guns,
you know,

2479
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:19,800
almost everybody I know has hundreds of
guns.

2480
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:22,250
He just not like a man.
I got hundreds of arrows.

2481
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:25,920
I have four.
I have thousands of guitars.

2482
02:05:26,120 --> 02:05:31,120
Um,
we need to be a more assertive,

2483
02:05:31,171 --> 02:05:32,820
aggressive,
compassionate,

2484
02:05:33,030 --> 02:05:36,630
aware society.
And when we see these glaring

2485
02:05:36,631 --> 02:05:38,520
indicators,
we're never going to stop it all.

2486
02:05:38,521 --> 02:05:43,440
There's always going to be a evil in our
lives and you can't stop it.

2487
02:05:43,441 --> 02:05:45,690
Hence,
you should be armed and prepared.

2488
02:05:45,691 --> 02:05:47,310
And if you're not comfortably being
armed,

2489
02:05:47,610 --> 02:05:49,350
by all means,
don't be.

2490
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:52,680
If you don't want to.
Like I saw the debate bill marcy or why

2491
02:05:52,681 --> 02:05:54,660
you can't expect every teacher to have a
gun.

2492
02:05:54,750 --> 02:05:57,240
I go,
who's ever recommended that?

2493
02:05:57,660 --> 02:05:59,520
That's what the anti gun people always
go.

2494
02:05:59,740 --> 02:06:02,940
Why should have everybody should have a
machine gun just shooting everything.

2495
02:06:03,150 --> 02:06:04,080
Yeah.
That's a pretty good.

2496
02:06:04,410 --> 02:06:09,410
That quote for quote what I recommended.
They go to the deep end every time where

2497
02:06:09,871 --> 02:06:13,110
they're trying to make fun,
they try to make fun of the proposition.

2498
02:06:13,140 --> 02:06:16,620
Unbelievable.
Should be armed against killers.

2499
02:06:17,190 --> 02:06:20,830
There are people I know everywhere.
Teachers,

2500
02:06:22,450 --> 02:06:25,370
grocery store,
baggers,

2501
02:06:25,870 --> 02:06:27,700
a name,
a walk of life.

2502
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:29,850
My Weldon Buddy,
my mechanic,

2503
02:06:29,851 --> 02:06:31,980
my dentist,
my doctor,

2504
02:06:32,150 --> 02:06:33,730
Dr. strapped.
Yes.

2505
02:06:33,731 --> 02:06:35,970
I mean they just.
They're pragmatists,

2506
02:06:35,971 --> 02:06:38,340
they're utilitarian.
They're self sufficient.

2507
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:43,640
What?
When did that become an desirable to be

2508
02:06:45,091 --> 02:06:47,700
self sufficient and capable?
I think that's the problem.

2509
02:06:47,701 --> 02:06:50,310
I think what we're saying is that we
have such a gun problem.

2510
02:06:50,340 --> 02:06:53,700
There's so many people in so many guns
that people just want to somehow or

2511
02:06:53,701 --> 02:06:55,800
another they do finish the numbers.
Joe,

2512
02:06:55,801 --> 02:06:57,960
we do not have a gun problem.
When I was growing up,

2513
02:06:57,961 --> 02:07:01,290
we had guns in school during the season.
Rifles,

2514
02:07:01,291 --> 02:07:03,510
shotguns were brought and put in your
lockers.

2515
02:07:03,690 --> 02:07:08,690
There was unlimited ubiquitous access to
firepower throughout my youth.

2516
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:13,000
No school shootings,
something else has happened and it has

2517
02:07:13,090 --> 02:07:18,090
to do with big farm in the dis,
the irresponsible knee jerk,

2518
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:23,960
a bandage on a gaping wound of a,
of a child showing up at each childlike

2519
02:07:25,831 --> 02:07:27,990
behavior.
And all of a sudden they PROZAC,

2520
02:07:27,991 --> 02:07:29,640
um,
in a Ritalin.

2521
02:07:29,641 --> 02:07:32,070
Them,
this stuff turns into a Zombie.

2522
02:07:32,071 --> 02:07:34,110
My dear,
dear blood brother,

2523
02:07:34,111 --> 02:07:36,430
cliff Davis,
the greatest

2524
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:41,430
drummer on the planet listened to what
he did on the Ted nugent album and the

2525
02:07:41,771 --> 02:07:44,440
cat scratch fever album in the free for
all album.

2526
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:48,580
And the weekend,
I mean this guy was a god of musicality.

2527
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:54,300
He became depressed and was prescribed.
And the incidents of people being

2528
02:07:56,231 --> 02:08:01,231
prescribed a mood controllers in emotion
controllers and depression controllers.

2529
02:08:03,670 --> 02:08:08,670
The incidents in the consistency with
which they attempt to go cold Turkey and

2530
02:08:10,690 --> 02:08:13,090
kill themselves.
You,

2531
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:17,350
your brain becomes changed.
It becomes altered.

2532
02:08:17,351 --> 02:08:22,351
Your logic meter is off duty with this
pharmaceuticals in your system.

2533
02:08:23,530 --> 02:08:26,860
Cliff came home,
decided to get off the PROZAC,

2534
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:31,810
walked out into the yard screaming,
thrown his clothes out the window and

2535
02:08:31,811 --> 02:08:36,811
shot himself in the head and Aurora guy,
all the.

2536
02:08:39,010 --> 02:08:41,320
They're all on something.
It's true.

2537
02:08:41,530 --> 02:08:44,800
It's at and mothers and fathers out
there.

2538
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:49,720
Discipline is the answer,
not pharmaceuticals.

2539
02:08:50,050 --> 02:08:55,050
Conversation is the answer.
Probing parenting is the answer would.

2540
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:58,780
Like I said,
when I was growing up,

2541
02:08:58,781 --> 02:09:02,220
we had a cuckoo's business,
we had a eloise and people showed

2542
02:09:02,221 --> 02:09:06,280
dangerous and an in an antisocial
behavior.

2543
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:11,520
You intervened and you put them in an
institution and even that was a mistake

2544
02:09:12,011 --> 02:09:15,370
because there was always a chemical
response instead of a,

2545
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:20,590
a compassionate response to chemical to
some people do or fucked in the head.

2546
02:09:20,591 --> 02:09:22,250
Yes,
you do have to do something.

2547
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:25,420
Absolutely,
but there is the argument that there's a

2548
02:09:25,421 --> 02:09:28,690
lot of people that take these
pharmaceuticals and they have no violent

2549
02:09:28,691 --> 02:09:30,370
outbursts,
which I agree with too,

2550
02:09:30,371 --> 02:09:35,371
but the people that do have violent
outbursts are almost universally on

2551
02:09:35,771 --> 02:09:37,500
something universe.
Yeah.

2552
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:40,600
If you look at the numbers,
and I've said this many times that I

2553
02:09:40,601 --> 02:09:43,510
don't think we have a gun problem,
I think we have a mental health problem

2554
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:45,640
disguised as a gun problem.
Absolutely,

2555
02:09:45,641 --> 02:09:48,310
because whether it's someone driving a
truck into a crowd of people,

2556
02:09:48,311 --> 02:09:49,480
that's the same thing.

2557
02:09:49,510 --> 02:09:53,230
Do you think,
do you think after 42 calls to the

2558
02:09:53,231 --> 02:09:56,770
sheriff's department threatening to
shoot the school and three to the FBI,

2559
02:09:57,100 --> 02:10:00,490
do you think the Parkland shooters
should've been visited a little earlier

2560
02:10:00,491 --> 02:10:03,730
than after 42 and three calls of
threatening to shoot up the school?

2561
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:07,240
Do you think the authorities should have
the right to go visit this kid,

2562
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:11,200
get the guns out of there,
don't you think when you say,

2563
02:10:11,201 --> 02:10:14,530
I am going to shoot up the school in my
world,

2564
02:10:14,650 --> 02:10:19,300
that would be good enough to disqualify
that person from owning a gun?

2565
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:21,790
I agree with you.
I don't know what the circumstances were

2566
02:10:21,791 --> 02:10:25,180
with the Parkland kid and I do.
I know that the FBI did visit him on one

2567
02:10:25,181 --> 02:10:26,860
occasion.
Not good enough.

2568
02:10:26,861 --> 02:10:28,210
You.
I don't know what they there.

2569
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:32,440
It's not like he was peeing on the Alamo
and just being a dirt bag.

2570
02:10:32,441 --> 02:10:33,980
He was threatening to kill as many

2571
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:38,480
people as possible.
That to me is enough information to

2572
02:10:38,481 --> 02:10:41,750
disarm the guy and probably
institutionalized Murray's and take him

2573
02:10:41,751 --> 02:10:45,830
in for review to a psychiatric ward.
At that point,

2574
02:10:45,980 --> 02:10:49,450
you can't say,
I'm going to kill people yet.

2575
02:10:49,490 --> 02:10:53,510
Can't say that.
Are you comfortable with a world where

2576
02:10:53,511 --> 02:10:56,960
there's so much gun violence that
everybody just has to be strapped or.

2577
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,170
No Way?
The last thing I.

2578
02:10:59,990 --> 02:11:02,510
I've said it 100 times.
I'm going to say it again on the Joe

2579
02:11:02,510 --> 02:11:04,280
Rogan podcast.
Write it down.

2580
02:11:04,610 --> 02:11:09,610
I do not want everyone to carry a gun.
I do not want everyone to own a gun.

2581
02:11:13,010 --> 02:11:17,810
I don't want everyone to hunt.
I don't want everyone to have an 850

2582
02:11:17,811 --> 02:11:22,130
horsepower Ford Bronco.
I don't want everyone to go on the Joe

2583
02:11:22,130 --> 02:11:25,580
Rogan podcast.
There is a time and place for

2584
02:11:25,581 --> 02:11:29,660
individuality and individual choices and
many people will always be

2585
02:11:29,661 --> 02:11:31,070
uncomfortable.
You know,

2586
02:11:31,250 --> 02:11:36,020
taken a hook out of a fish's lip,
so don't go fishing and if you don't

2587
02:11:36,021 --> 02:11:38,600
feel comfortable around guns,
by all means,

2588
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:43,610
just don't have one,
but those of us that have a hint of

2589
02:11:43,611 --> 02:11:48,320
warrior instinct and rugged boy scout
being prepared,

2590
02:11:48,740 --> 02:11:51,740
desire,
don't disarm us,

2591
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:55,910
we're your best friend with and they're
everywhere.

2592
02:11:56,320 --> 02:12:00,440
They're those teachers in all these
school shootings that were teachers that

2593
02:12:00,441 --> 02:12:03,920
would have had a gun but they were
forbidden to and there are instances,

2594
02:12:03,921 --> 02:12:06,830
and this is something that people that
are anti gun don't like to talk about,

2595
02:12:06,831 --> 02:12:09,440
but there are instances where trained
shooters have stopped.

2596
02:12:09,650 --> 02:12:12,590
Mass shootings have stopped someone
killing people.

2597
02:12:12,591 --> 02:12:15,970
It's theirs and let me come in on the
train while I.

2598
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:18,040
As long as they get training,
let's let's,

2599
02:12:18,070 --> 02:12:23,070
let's squash that myth.
Big Old fat Jewish lady in New York City

2600
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:26,600
back in the sixties.
She was robbed at gunpoint at knife

2601
02:12:26,601 --> 02:12:29,270
point over and over again.
Remember when they had like 2000 murders

2602
02:12:29,271 --> 02:12:32,480
a year in man.
It just runaway mayhem.

2603
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:36,050
She was getting upset.
She wanted to get a pistol and she went

2604
02:12:36,051 --> 02:12:37,760
to the police station.
I need to get permanent.

2605
02:12:37,761 --> 02:12:39,230
Well,
I'm sorry we don't give permission,

2606
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:41,660
but I had been robbed all these times.

2607
02:12:41,660 --> 02:12:44,570
I'm scared.
He comes back all the time.

2608
02:12:44,571 --> 02:12:46,820
A guy had his good points gun once my
money.

2609
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:49,070
I'm sorry,
you can't have a gun.

2610
02:12:49,670 --> 02:12:53,840
So she was frustrated.
This was a documented case and so she

2611
02:12:53,841 --> 02:12:56,090
went to uncle Joe and uncle John.
I'm scared.

2612
02:12:56,091 --> 02:12:58,160
I need a gun.
Guy Keeps dumps.

2613
02:12:58,260 --> 02:13:00,310
He's gonna kill me.
So uncle Joe got,

2614
02:13:00,370 --> 02:13:01,970
I'm a row.
Got Her a revolver.

2615
02:13:02,210 --> 02:13:03,500
She'd.
I don't like it.

2616
02:13:03,501 --> 02:13:06,560
Just put it under the kind of scared
that I don't like guns.

2617
02:13:06,830 --> 02:13:08,930
Never fired it in her life.
No training.

2618
02:13:09,410 --> 02:13:11,060
Had no idea,
but she knew which,

2619
02:13:11,090 --> 02:13:13,790
which end.
The bullet came out of next time she was

2620
02:13:13,791 --> 02:13:15,290
robbed.
She shot the son of a bitch.

2621
02:13:15,560 --> 02:13:18,590
She knew what to do.
She knows the trigger and the training.

2622
02:13:18,591 --> 02:13:21,380
She one shot the guy that was
threatening her life.

2623
02:13:21,530 --> 02:13:24,980
Now they put her in jail initially.
Slake,

2624
02:13:25,070 --> 02:13:29,060
you know,
Bernie gets a defendant in his life,

2625
02:13:29,420 --> 02:13:32,880
but eventually the charges were dropped
because it was clear and present.

2626
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:37,880
She was defending herself from an
engineered recidivistic write that down,

2627
02:13:38,640 --> 02:13:43,640
engineered recidivistic the system in
knowingly and intentionally lets out,

2628
02:13:44,710 --> 02:13:48,030
knife and stabbers and rapists and
murderers and child molesters.

2629
02:13:48,150 --> 02:13:50,460
They keep letting them out.
Those are the people.

2630
02:13:50,461 --> 02:13:52,920
90 six percent of the time that commit
the violent.

2631
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:55,190
When you say engineered,
do you think they do that because of

2632
02:13:55,191 --> 02:13:56,300
prison?
Overpopulation,

2633
02:13:56,390 --> 02:13:59,820
lack of funds to do it because they want
society to be dangerous.

2634
02:14:00,210 --> 02:14:05,100
I can't imagine how the engineered.
I can't imagine that anything is just in

2635
02:14:05,101 --> 02:14:10,101
competence and incompetence and the
fusion of responsibility for the

2636
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:13,410
individuals.
Bureaucratic.

2637
02:14:13,950 --> 02:14:16,910
Institutionalized irresponsibility.
Yeah,

2638
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:19,680
and corruption and abusive party.
They don't want to deal with it.

2639
02:14:19,700 --> 02:14:20,750
Well,
lack of resource.

2640
02:14:21,210 --> 02:14:22,950
Cut them a deal.
They only shot three people.

2641
02:14:22,951 --> 02:14:24,840
Let's I get them on jaywalking.
Okay.

2642
02:14:25,030 --> 02:14:28,860
We'll cut them a deal.
He only serve six years of his life

2643
02:14:28,861 --> 02:14:30,120
sentence for killing those people.

2644
02:14:30,240 --> 02:14:33,300
I mean it happens all the time and that
guys on the street and he kills

2645
02:14:33,301 --> 02:14:34,134
somebody.
Go,

2646
02:14:34,140 --> 02:14:35,700
I can't believe it.
He had an arrest record,

2647
02:14:35,701 --> 02:14:37,770
goes back to his youth and it was 100
pages lie.

2648
02:14:37,771 --> 02:14:38,850
I can't believe you.
Let him out.

2649
02:14:38,851 --> 02:14:39,684
Well,
we let them out.

2650
02:14:39,870 --> 02:14:41,370
We knew we killed people.
In fact,

2651
02:14:41,371 --> 02:14:43,290
he stabbed two people,
but he missed the artery.

2652
02:14:43,291 --> 02:14:46,380
So we're going to let them out and see
if he can study anatomy enough and get a

2653
02:14:46,381 --> 02:14:50,160
good stab next time that our court
systems are a joke.

2654
02:14:50,790 --> 02:14:54,150
Our prison system is a joke.
I mean,

2655
02:14:54,151 --> 02:14:56,760
if somebody stabbed somebody,
do you want him?

2656
02:14:56,820 --> 02:14:59,700
You want him on the street with you?
If he stabbed somebody,

2657
02:14:59,701 --> 02:15:01,950
you are killing that person.
You're just shitty at it.

2658
02:15:02,610 --> 02:15:05,430
If you shoot at somebody in your miss
that's murder,

2659
02:15:05,431 --> 02:15:07,470
you just,
you're just bad at it.

2660
02:15:07,770 --> 02:15:10,110
If you're willing to just throw a bullet
at a human being,

2661
02:15:10,260 --> 02:15:12,660
I want him in a cage forever or better
yet,

2662
02:15:12,690 --> 02:15:15,810
dead right there.
And then if he's capable of taking an

2663
02:15:15,811 --> 02:15:18,780
innocent life,
I want him out of the gene pool.

2664
02:15:19,050 --> 02:15:20,010
I don't believe in,
uh,

2665
02:15:20,440 --> 02:15:21,440
um,
uh,

2666
02:15:21,570 --> 02:15:24,210
how did I put it in that one interview?
I don't.

2667
02:15:24,211 --> 02:15:28,380
I don't believe in repeat crime.
Repeat criminals.

2668
02:15:28,381 --> 02:15:32,010
I believe in dead criminals.
If someone threatens innocent life,

2669
02:15:32,610 --> 02:15:35,400
get him Outta here.
I really believe that.

2670
02:15:35,401 --> 02:15:37,440
And you know who the best person to make
that decision is?

2671
02:15:37,710 --> 02:15:40,830
The person that bought to get stamped,
the lady bought to get raped.

2672
02:15:41,580 --> 02:15:44,430
The gigabyte to get shot at this all
makes sense.

2673
02:15:44,490 --> 02:15:44,881
I mean,
I,

2674
02:15:44,881 --> 02:15:48,600
I feel what you're saying.
I think the real problem is why does it

2675
02:15:48,601 --> 02:15:51,180
happen in the first place?
Because we're a society that doesn't

2676
02:15:51,181 --> 02:15:56,181
respond to alarming signals in the hope
of not hurting feelings instead of

2677
02:15:56,371 --> 02:16:01,371
saving lives.
It's a liberal mantra of a feel good

2678
02:16:01,860 --> 02:16:06,860
inaction versus tough choices and harsh
choices that will actually save lives.

2679
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:10,020
Don't you think it's also a lack of
resources to.

2680
02:16:10,021 --> 02:16:14,220
And a lack of these people that are
interviewing these psychos before they

2681
02:16:14,221 --> 02:16:15,780
snap based on that.
Really,

2682
02:16:15,781 --> 02:16:18,480
psychology based on my tax bill.
Um,

2683
02:16:18,481 --> 02:16:21,690
I think they have the resources is just
mismanaged and wasted.

2684
02:16:22,140 --> 02:16:23,430
By the way,
while we're doing this,

2685
02:16:23,460 --> 02:16:27,060
can I hit the bathroom real quick before
I squirmed out of here?

2686
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:28,770
Can I never.
This will be right back

2687
02:16:30,050 --> 02:16:31,390
and I came in here.
Will stay here.

2688
02:16:31,391 --> 02:16:32,440
Yeah.
Amazing.

2689
02:16:32,441 --> 02:16:34,480
You're walking fantastic on those robot
knees,

2690
02:16:34,481 --> 02:16:36,250
man.
It's crazy.

2691
02:16:39,470 --> 02:16:41,740
It's amazing how few people can hold
their pis.

2692
02:16:42,770 --> 02:16:44,190
Sometimes it comes.
Yeah.

2693
02:16:44,300 --> 02:16:45,860
He's got to waterstone.
Yeah.

2694
02:16:45,910 --> 02:16:47,580
He,
he slammed to waters this.

2695
02:16:47,730 --> 02:16:52,550
A shooting happening while he's on is so
appropriate.

2696
02:16:53,010 --> 02:16:53,811
I mean,
it's so,

2697
02:16:53,811 --> 02:16:55,550
uh,
crazy that this,

2698
02:16:55,620 --> 02:16:58,180
this is the time.
So this is a newsroom wide.

2699
02:16:58,181 --> 02:17:00,160
They got,
do they have a motivation for this guy?

2700
02:17:00,450 --> 02:17:03,030
No motivation is being interrogated
right now is what I just read.

2701
02:17:03,210 --> 02:17:04,043
And uh,

2702
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:08,730
it's amazing that these guys want,
they get captured but they don't get

2703
02:17:08,731 --> 02:17:12,540
killed like the Parkland kid and the,
a lot of these people like how are they

2704
02:17:12,541 --> 02:17:15,000
not killing these people when they're,
when it's happening.

2705
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:17,020
Supposedly a white guy in his twenties.

2706
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:20,500
Is it some fake news thing?
I mean,

2707
02:17:20,501 --> 02:17:22,590
he,
he shot reporters,

2708
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:23,490
you know,

2709
02:17:23,490 --> 02:17:27,220
until the interrogation comes out.
I feel like it's not fair to say,

2710
02:17:27,221 --> 02:17:30,010
but there are people pointing at things
that have been in the news recently.

2711
02:17:30,240 --> 02:17:31,570
Oh fuck.

2712
02:17:32,540 --> 02:17:34,370
It's just so much.
I mean,

2713
02:17:34,430 --> 02:17:38,180
I hear what Ted's saying,
that you should be able to defend

2714
02:17:38,181 --> 02:17:39,590
yourself.
And I agree.

2715
02:17:39,620 --> 02:17:44,150
Like if you were in a grocery store
somewhere and some guy came in shooting

2716
02:17:44,151 --> 02:17:46,490
and you had a gun,
I would want you to be able to defend

2717
02:17:46,491 --> 02:17:48,440
yourself.
You know,

2718
02:17:48,441 --> 02:17:51,150
I want you to be alive.
I agree with you.

2719
02:17:51,151 --> 02:17:54,860
I get that.
But that's the only way.

2720
02:17:54,861 --> 02:17:56,990
I mean.
Or is it just what we have to do right

2721
02:17:56,991 --> 02:17:57,950
now.
I mean,

2722
02:17:57,951 --> 02:18:01,640
I don't know what anybody on the other
side wants other than taking away

2723
02:18:01,641 --> 02:18:04,710
everyone's guns.
But if you take away everyone's guns,

2724
02:18:05,130 --> 02:18:08,520
how are we possibly going to do an audit
of 300 million guns in this country?

2725
02:18:08,521 --> 02:18:10,190
How are you going to find all the
illegal ones?

2726
02:18:10,220 --> 02:18:11,730
Are you going to find all the stored
ones?

2727
02:18:11,970 --> 02:18:13,620
And then there's that old cliche.

2728
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:16,260
If you outlaw guns,
only outlaws will have guns.

2729
02:18:16,261 --> 02:18:18,730
I mean it's almost like the same thing
we're talking about when it,

2730
02:18:18,950 --> 02:18:23,950
in terms of legalizing illegal,
illegal drugs and when drugs are legal,

2731
02:18:25,081 --> 02:18:28,590
they can be taxed and you can make sense
of the situation.

2732
02:18:28,591 --> 02:18:30,960
You can have treatment centers.
The stigma of,

2733
02:18:31,220 --> 02:18:31,621
you know,
the,

2734
02:18:31,621 --> 02:18:33,930
the,
the appeal of them of doing something

2735
02:18:33,931 --> 02:18:37,470
you're not supposed to do is no longer
there and then you're not funding these

2736
02:18:37,471 --> 02:18:41,190
illegal organizations.
Organizations like the cartels in Mexico

2737
02:18:41,191 --> 02:18:46,191
or back when it was organized crime in
America for alcohol when the prohibition

2738
02:18:48,111 --> 02:18:49,300
was going on.
It's,

2739
02:18:49,650 --> 02:18:54,510
I don't think that you're going to be
able to take away all these guns,

2740
02:18:55,350 --> 02:18:57,990
but I don't know what the argument I
would like to talk to somebody who has

2741
02:18:57,991 --> 02:19:01,800
an argument that you could do it because
I know they did it in Australia,

2742
02:19:02,370 --> 02:19:06,150
but Australia so small and by the way
you can get guns in Australia.

2743
02:19:06,151 --> 02:19:08,070
People use guns for hunting all the
time.

2744
02:19:08,071 --> 02:19:12,240
So guns are available and occasionally
they do have gun violence but they had

2745
02:19:12,241 --> 02:19:15,750
like one mass shooting in the 19
nineties in Australia and they just

2746
02:19:15,751 --> 02:19:17,700
banned all the guns.
But Australians,

2747
02:19:17,701 --> 02:19:22,701
are there a different culture too?
Like this fucking culture is gun happy

2748
02:19:22,981 --> 02:19:27,770
from all of our movies and television
shows and the solution is like bang,

2749
02:19:27,771 --> 02:19:28,371
Bang,
Bang.

2750
02:19:28,371 --> 02:19:30,620
Like shooting people as a part of the
solution.

2751
02:19:33,170 --> 02:19:34,400
You know,
I don't know.

2752
02:19:35,210 --> 02:19:36,043
I don't know,
man,

2753
02:19:36,050 --> 02:19:38,090
I just.
No one has an answer.

2754
02:19:38,230 --> 02:19:40,640
There's no one on that side.
No one on this side.

2755
02:19:40,641 --> 02:19:44,240
Every answer has holes in it.
You're laughing.

2756
02:19:44,241 --> 02:19:46,860
What happened?
Our Pis,

2757
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:48,970
I always say,
God,

2758
02:19:48,980 --> 02:19:53,980
I love that.
I always say to this conversation about

2759
02:19:54,951 --> 02:19:55,731
guns,
you know,

2760
02:19:55,731 --> 02:19:57,890
and,
and I don't see an answer.

2761
02:19:57,930 --> 02:19:58,850
I do.
I really don't.

2762
02:19:58,851 --> 02:20:01,430
I don't see an answer.
The ultimately will be like,

2763
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:04,280
I'm all for responsible gun ownership.
I have guns,

2764
02:20:04,281 --> 02:20:06,710
I've hunted with guns,
I believe in gun ownership,

2765
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:09,200
but how do you stop gun violence?
And I don't know.

2766
02:20:09,201 --> 02:20:11,550
I don't know what the answer is and I
think this is ultimately what everybody

2767
02:20:11,560 --> 02:20:14,360
is trying to find.
We were talking about when you were

2768
02:20:14,361 --> 02:20:15,980
gone,
the Australians were,

2769
02:20:15,981 --> 02:20:19,490
they banned guns because of one mass
shooting and they've never had a mass

2770
02:20:19,491 --> 02:20:21,020
shooting sense,
but doesn't.

2771
02:20:21,190 --> 02:20:26,000
Crime continues to go up and down based
on other social factors and there's not

2772
02:20:26,001 --> 02:20:28,070
many of them.
There's only 20 million people in the

2773
02:20:28,071 --> 02:20:28,904
entire country

2774
02:20:29,650 --> 02:20:33,940
to address.
Probably the glaring beast in the room

2775
02:20:34,270 --> 02:20:37,730
of America.
You're 50 something,

2776
02:20:38,030 --> 02:20:39,110
50,
50,

2777
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:42,170
51 in August,
I'll be 70 and I've had a pretty good

2778
02:20:42,171 --> 02:20:46,160
writer.
I got a pretty good absorption factor of

2779
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:47,510
information,
evidence,

2780
02:20:47,511 --> 02:20:50,210
experiences,
ideas,

2781
02:20:51,020 --> 02:20:53,540
opinions,
activities,

2782
02:20:56,570 --> 02:21:01,570
what the hell happened
that would allow Americans so many of us

2783
02:21:04,510 --> 02:21:09,510
to become so evil that we want to hurt
each other and kill each other and

2784
02:21:12,250 --> 02:21:15,760
it killed children,
rob in and molests so want to make the

2785
02:21:15,761 --> 02:21:19,230
biggest impact that hurt the most people
because they're hurt.

2786
02:21:19,240 --> 02:21:20,490
Doing what w,
W,

2787
02:21:20,491 --> 02:21:20,911
W,
W,

2788
02:21:20,911 --> 02:21:21,410
w,
w,

2789
02:21:21,410 --> 02:21:26,410
w where did that delineation from a post
World War,

2790
02:21:26,470 --> 02:21:31,470
two celebration of the freedoms that
motivated our armed forces to defeat the

2791
02:21:32,531 --> 02:21:37,531
worst evil on the planet,
the Japanese Slaughters and the Nazi

2792
02:21:39,550 --> 02:21:44,550
devils that it was our constitution and
our individual rights that motivated

2793
02:21:47,021 --> 02:21:50,110
these guys to fight harder and you know,
it was a martial artist.

2794
02:21:50,111 --> 02:21:55,111
You have to see beyond the contest and
it's almost like you don't,

2795
02:21:55,990 --> 02:21:58,300
you don't make your hit where you want
to hit.

2796
02:21:58,870 --> 02:22:01,300
You want your hit to go past where you
want to hit.

2797
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:08,120
We were a united nation in 1946,
19,

2798
02:22:08,131 --> 02:22:12,720
47 and certainly right,
48 when I was born in Detroit was the

2799
02:22:12,721 --> 02:22:15,930
work ethic,
productivity epicenter of planet Earth,

2800
02:22:16,020 --> 02:22:21,020
universally known.
We were the war machine that built the

2801
02:22:21,301 --> 02:22:23,280
tanks and the bombers and the planes
and,

2802
02:22:23,850 --> 02:22:26,090
and pride ownership and,

2803
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:30,660
and you got up early and you busted your
ass to be the best that you can be and

2804
02:22:30,661 --> 02:22:35,661
you kept your yard good and you kept
your house clean and you earn your own

2805
02:22:35,941 --> 02:22:38,250
way.
And it was an embarrassment not to earn

2806
02:22:38,251 --> 02:22:42,690
your own way and you save for a rainy
day and you live within your means and

2807
02:22:42,930 --> 02:22:44,270
you discipline yourself.
My,

2808
02:22:44,300 --> 02:22:46,590
my upbringing was,
and wasn't poverty.

2809
02:22:46,591 --> 02:22:49,800
I was never in need,
but you couldn't drink a whole coke.

2810
02:22:50,440 --> 02:22:52,320
You couldn't buy something because you
wanted it.

2811
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:55,170
You needed some socks.
She probably got them for Christmas.

2812
02:22:55,660 --> 02:22:58,350
Um,
and if I wanted an Arrow,

2813
02:22:58,351 --> 02:22:59,790
I had a,
you know,

2814
02:22:59,850 --> 02:23:03,630
go to the pickup garbage and try to sell
golf balls back and,

2815
02:23:03,820 --> 02:23:05,070
and,
and bought,

2816
02:23:05,130 --> 02:23:09,190
get deposits on bottles and cans.
And yeah,

2817
02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:12,750
there was a,
I was the rugged individualism,

2818
02:23:13,130 --> 02:23:16,560
the self sufficiency,
the neighborliness,

2819
02:23:16,561 --> 02:23:20,340
the giving and caring and you know,
it did take a village.

2820
02:23:20,340 --> 02:23:23,340
It started with family,
but you cared about your neighbors and

2821
02:23:23,341 --> 02:23:28,050
you watched over each other.
And then I saw and with all due respect,

2822
02:23:28,500 --> 02:23:33,500
when the beatniks and the dope and then
the hippies and the disconnect and a

2823
02:23:35,371 --> 02:23:40,371
carelessness erupted and and a meanness,
I started seeing more meanness and anger

2824
02:23:44,971 --> 02:23:49,971
and and disconnect.
And then after whether it was the new

2825
02:23:50,491 --> 02:23:55,491
deal or the great society,
which kind of incentivized not being the

2826
02:23:56,731 --> 02:23:59,730
best that you can be and you can
actually stay home and get a check.

2827
02:23:59,731 --> 02:24:04,731
And I'm the unions would negotiate not
unquality automobiles but money that may

2828
02:24:06,691 --> 02:24:09,210
or may not be there,
but we'll get you some more money and

2829
02:24:09,211 --> 02:24:11,340
you can make Chrysler's that won't even
start.

2830
02:24:11,460 --> 02:24:14,460
It can't even drive them.
They're such a pile of shit.

2831
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:18,840
And I saw this Detroit go from this
glowing

2832
02:24:20,790 --> 02:24:25,790
epicenter of goodwill and decency and
work ethic to Liberal Democrats,

2833
02:24:27,870 --> 02:24:31,620
scamming people and bribing people for
votes by getting you something you

2834
02:24:31,621 --> 02:24:32,340
didn't know.

2835
02:24:32,340 --> 02:24:37,340
And then all of a sudden the city burned
down and no age couches in the street

2836
02:24:39,481 --> 02:24:44,481
and refrigerators on the lawns and it
just turned into a lump I shit and it

2837
02:24:46,290 --> 02:24:49,860
breaks my heart.
I go downtown Detroit now and building

2838
02:24:49,861 --> 02:24:54,150
the beautiful architecture still boarded
up from the 67 riots.

2839
02:24:54,900 --> 02:24:58,530
I took my kids down for the 42nd
anniversary of the Amboy Dukes and I

2840
02:24:58,531 --> 02:25:02,760
wanted to show him this beautiful city I
was raised in and what happened to it?

2841
02:25:02,940 --> 02:25:06,990
And almost for dramatic effect,
almost like Cecil B de Mille was,

2842
02:25:07,270 --> 02:25:10,020
you know,
directing a scene for me to emphasize

2843
02:25:10,530 --> 02:25:14,940
how deteriorated Detroit got,
here's this guy in a sidewalk with his

2844
02:25:14,941 --> 02:25:18,440
pants down,
taking a dump in the middle of the after

2845
02:25:18,441 --> 02:25:19,710
known.
And I go,

2846
02:25:19,711 --> 02:25:21,840
wow,
I didn't actually hire that guy.

2847
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:23,220
That's really what's happened.

2848
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:29,010
So if you allow your society to crumble
before your eyes without intervening and

2849
02:25:30,521 --> 02:25:30,941
go,
hey,

2850
02:25:30,941 --> 02:25:32,490
you can't do that.
You go,

2851
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:33,400
hey,
you can't do that.

2852
02:25:33,410 --> 02:25:35,080
I've done it with my musicians all my
life.

2853
02:25:35,081 --> 02:25:36,120
You Go,
God demo.

2854
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:40,450
We were really rocking last week and now
you're all stoned and can't even wake

2855
02:25:40,451 --> 02:25:42,190
you up,
but don't you think that when you're

2856
02:25:42,191 --> 02:25:44,410
talking about 1946,
the United States,

2857
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:49,500
we were.
We were all against the Nazis and the

2858
02:25:50,291 --> 02:25:53,790
Japanese.
We were united certainly that are our

2859
02:25:53,830 --> 02:25:57,040
lives were threatened.
The world's future was threatened and

2860
02:25:57,041 --> 02:25:58,840
people felt like they had a purpose.
Purpose.

2861
02:25:59,140 --> 02:26:00,700
Do you remember?
I was in.

2862
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:04,660
I was in New York right after September
11 and one of the credit and something

2863
02:26:04,661 --> 02:26:06,450
happened.
A friend of mine fainted and we had to

2864
02:26:06,460 --> 02:26:11,460
call the fire department.
EMT showed up and the respect and the

2865
02:26:12,431 --> 02:26:15,490
happiness that people had when they saw
the first responders,

2866
02:26:15,790 --> 02:26:16,600
and I was like,
this is.

2867
02:26:16,600 --> 02:26:18,670
This is fascinating because I lived in
New York.

2868
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:22,300
It was,
it was a high point because people had

2869
02:26:22,301 --> 02:26:25,330
felt what it was like to be attacked to
be at war.

2870
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:28,450
I mean that was what the attack and the
Trade Center,

2871
02:26:28,490 --> 02:26:30,700
the Twin Towers was.
We were at war.

2872
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:33,610
They felt this and they felt united
because of it,

2873
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:37,750
and when these people showed up to help,
they were excited to see them.

2874
02:26:37,751 --> 02:26:40,780
They were like heroes.
They treated them like real heroes and I

2875
02:26:40,781 --> 02:26:42,280
was like,
this is a different feeling than

2876
02:26:42,281 --> 02:26:46,240
anything I've had before and I had.
I had to imagine that this was probably

2877
02:26:46,241 --> 02:26:49,780
what it was like in the United States in
the forties fixture in the middle of the

2878
02:26:49,781 --> 02:26:54,781
war when people were united working
together to make sure there was enough

2879
02:26:55,151 --> 02:26:58,750
scrap metal and enough rubber and there
were car pooling so that they have

2880
02:26:58,751 --> 02:27:03,751
enough raw materials to create twine and
rubber bands for the workout.

2881
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:07,810
People felt sacrificing for the benefit
of their society.

2882
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:09,970
Yeah,
and they felt like there was something

2883
02:27:09,971 --> 02:27:13,330
real going on.
Whereas when there's no threat and no

2884
02:27:13,331 --> 02:27:15,910
worries,
I think people get lost.

2885
02:27:16,210 --> 02:27:18,340
I think especially people with no
discipline.

2886
02:27:18,341 --> 02:27:20,130
Not Everybody of course,
but some it's.

2887
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:23,680
There's a tendency to get lost.
Then there's a tendency for people to

2888
02:27:23,681 --> 02:27:25,450
take advantage of those people that are
lost and say,

2889
02:27:25,451 --> 02:27:28,060
it's not your fault.
It's the government's fault and the

2890
02:27:28,061 --> 02:27:31,210
government needs to pay you and the
government needs to help out so wrong,

2891
02:27:31,270 --> 02:27:36,100
but there's this very strange tendency
that people have and also if I may

2892
02:27:36,101 --> 02:27:37,570
exalt,
here I am with Joe Rogan.

2893
02:27:37,571 --> 02:27:39,120
We'd never met.
I didn't know much about.

2894
02:27:39,130 --> 02:27:40,780
Yes,
everybody was bombarding me.

2895
02:27:40,781 --> 02:27:43,300
So you got to go on Joe Rogan's guys.
Reasonable,

2896
02:27:43,360 --> 02:27:47,380
sensible,
smart and funny and he's promoting

2897
02:27:47,381 --> 02:27:50,680
hunting now and I got motherfuckers.
Sounds like my boy.

2898
02:27:50,860 --> 02:27:55,030
Let's go do this.
You have to admit with intelligent,

2899
02:27:55,390 --> 02:28:00,390
conscientious,
well-formulated prioritization.

2900
02:28:02,710 --> 02:28:06,430
Twenty 18.
We can go on and on about the problems

2901
02:28:06,431 --> 02:28:08,740
in the world.
Do you know that I'm the happiest

2902
02:28:08,741 --> 02:28:12,160
motherfucker with the greatest band,
the greatest crew,

2903
02:28:12,190 --> 02:28:17,190
the greatest family.
Love my TV show and New York Times best

2904
02:28:17,270 --> 02:28:21,830
sellers and successful to some degree
and the things that I pursue my passions

2905
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:25,790
and I'm doing your show.
We're talking about important issues and

2906
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:29,720
I have dangerous zone people that come
backstage and we raise money for

2907
02:28:29,721 --> 02:28:33,790
charities every night.
Do you know Joe that I can't find a dirt

2908
02:28:33,791 --> 02:28:38,120
bag as well,
but a pretty big circle,

2909
02:28:38,180 --> 02:28:40,730
but you're a pretty big circle and I
walked down the streets here.

2910
02:28:40,731 --> 02:28:43,400
I go to starbucks and get a coffee.
I'll go up there and they pay.

2911
02:28:43,401 --> 02:28:46,670
They pay for it for me and I love spirit
of the wild.

2912
02:28:46,820 --> 02:28:49,660
Thanks for standing up for our freedoms.
God bless you.

2913
02:28:50,420 --> 02:28:53,240
I can't find a dirt bag.
I'm sure I could,

2914
02:28:53,630 --> 02:28:58,630
but here's the solute on a Joe Rogan Joe
Rogan podcast to all those people out

2915
02:28:59,571 --> 02:29:04,571
there that do intelligently and
responsibly prioritize and they bust

2916
02:29:04,851 --> 02:29:09,851
their ass because they're out there.
There's no monster armies of working

2917
02:29:09,981 --> 02:29:11,120
hard,
playing hard shit.

2918
02:29:11,121 --> 02:29:16,010
Kickers who sacrifice and take risks and
try to start a new business and fall

2919
02:29:16,011 --> 02:29:20,420
down in the arena and stand up and brush
themselves off and get back at it.

2920
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:24,110
Those are the people that I want to talk
to right now because they're the best of

2921
02:29:24,111 --> 02:29:28,100
the best.
Don't back off

2922
02:29:29,960 --> 02:29:34,550
friction.
Don't back off discomforting encounters

2923
02:29:34,580 --> 02:29:36,530
whether it's your kid,
because I've got buddies.

2924
02:29:36,980 --> 02:29:40,010
Kids died of fentanyl.
Great families

2925
02:29:41,660 --> 02:29:43,400
that Fentanyl Shit.
God,

2926
02:29:43,430 --> 02:29:46,940
I'll cry for Ya,
and you take them in your arms and they

2927
02:29:46,941 --> 02:29:51,020
didn't do anything wrong and they're
burying the fucking kid.

2928
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:55,610
Did you confront him?
Why are you telling me you didn't see

2929
02:29:55,611 --> 02:29:59,600
this man?
Here's my alert to people listening to

2930
02:29:59,601 --> 02:30:02,380
the upward Ted and Uncle Joe.
Bookie,

2931
02:30:04,910 --> 02:30:09,620
look harder,
be more assertive is something doesn't

2932
02:30:09,621 --> 02:30:12,590
look perfect.
Look into it,

2933
02:30:13,250 --> 02:30:17,090
and if,
if there's needy people instead of

2934
02:30:17,091 --> 02:30:19,910
giving them money because they get
probably buy drugs or alcohol and you're

2935
02:30:19,911 --> 02:30:22,490
probably going to die if you make a
donation to most homeless people are

2936
02:30:22,491 --> 02:30:23,690
going to.
You're helping to kill him.

2937
02:30:23,990 --> 02:30:28,280
Brighton there ain't going to buy good
shit with it and Badger.

2938
02:30:28,340 --> 02:30:33,340
You're elected employees.
We need to have mental health

2939
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:35,700
facilities.
What?

2940
02:30:35,790 --> 02:30:37,880
What?
What are you wasting money on?

2941
02:30:38,030 --> 02:30:40,820
You don't need to find out the sex life
of a turtle.

2942
02:30:41,150 --> 02:30:44,720
You need to take those billions of grant
money that you're blown right now for

2943
02:30:44,721 --> 02:30:49,430
some jack off and you need.
We need to address the mental health,

2944
02:30:49,460 --> 02:30:51,890
homeless,
truly needy,

2945
02:30:51,891 --> 02:30:54,660
not the greedy,
not the scammers where abled bodied,

2946
02:30:54,680 --> 02:30:59,270
they just like to stay home.
The people who have mental issues and

2947
02:30:59,271 --> 02:31:04,271
physical issues and that Donald trump
has finally got to a point in time where

2948
02:31:05,031 --> 02:31:09,140
you can fire a veteran administration
scam artists.

2949
02:31:09,170 --> 02:31:14,170
Punk who doesn't care about the vets,
doesn't show up for work in absconds on

2950
02:31:14,390 --> 02:31:17,690
revenues that could have got a couple of
wheelchairs for a legless marine.

2951
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:19,350
Now we can fire the bastards.

2952
02:31:19,470 --> 02:31:24,390
So there is upgrade happening.
But those that do know and do care no

2953
02:31:24,391 --> 02:31:27,510
more care.
More and,

2954
02:31:27,730 --> 02:31:30,240
and,
and demand answers.

2955
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:32,350
Whether it's your family member.
How come,

2956
02:31:32,910 --> 02:31:35,700
how come you didn't show up at the
family event?

2957
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:38,880
What are you doing?
Are you high?

2958
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:41,880
Are you using?
What are you doing?

2959
02:31:42,570 --> 02:31:47,570
I think if we start family neighbors,
and don't be afraid to tell your

2960
02:31:47,701 --> 02:31:48,051
neighbor,
you know,

2961
02:31:48,051 --> 02:31:51,480
I saw your son the other day was passed
out at the curb.

2962
02:31:51,780 --> 02:31:54,930
I don't think we intervene like we did
back when I was growing up.

2963
02:31:55,140 --> 02:31:57,570
Nobody would have tolerated that shit
when I was growing up.

2964
02:31:57,870 --> 02:32:00,960
They would have sounded the alarm.
And I don't think there's enough of

2965
02:32:00,961 --> 02:32:02,550
that.
Neighborliness,

2966
02:32:03,110 --> 02:32:04,410
um,
uh,

2967
02:32:04,860 --> 02:32:07,950
uh,
not being afraid to hurt feelings.

2968
02:32:08,220 --> 02:32:09,300
Well,
it's none of your business.

2969
02:32:09,301 --> 02:32:11,470
Well you wrote is my business because
you're,

2970
02:32:11,770 --> 02:32:14,190
you're my neighbor and the guy you're
shitting on my lawn.

2971
02:32:15,130 --> 02:32:17,460
I mean,
I don't think we're aggressive enough.

2972
02:32:17,461 --> 02:32:20,330
I come from a world of aggression,
not,

2973
02:32:20,370 --> 02:32:23,040
not being a prick about it,
but asking questions.

2974
02:32:23,041 --> 02:32:25,130
At some point you might have to shrug
your shoulders and go away.

2975
02:32:25,140 --> 02:32:26,760
He doesn't want any help.
There's nothing I can do,

2976
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:27,790
but I tried.
Well,

2977
02:32:27,791 --> 02:32:29,580
you'd like conflict.
You Do,

2978
02:32:29,690 --> 02:32:32,370
you do.
I like to eradicate it.

2979
02:32:32,371 --> 02:32:34,740
I like to intervene to reduce.
Clearly,

2980
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:37,710
you know that the way you express
yourself is entertaining,

2981
02:32:37,711 --> 02:32:40,530
but it's also polarizing like a lot of
things to say,

2982
02:32:40,980 --> 02:32:41,930
you know?
Sure.

2983
02:32:42,060 --> 02:32:44,880
You invite this sort of.
Not intentionally.

2984
02:32:45,090 --> 02:32:49,560
I think by being a pragmatist you're
going to invite conflict because some

2985
02:32:49,561 --> 02:32:51,660
people don't like to hear this shit.
Yeah.

2986
02:32:51,900 --> 02:32:53,190
Some people don't like to hear this
shit,

2987
02:32:53,191 --> 02:32:57,540
but the style in which you talk like
even when you're debating Pierce Morgan,

2988
02:32:57,541 --> 02:32:59,940
you're very,
very powerful with the way you describe

2989
02:32:59,941 --> 02:33:01,380
things and you,
you,

2990
02:33:01,470 --> 02:33:04,200
you get people that want to argue back
with you.

2991
02:33:04,860 --> 02:33:08,040
It's time for that because I think the
gentleman's approach,

2992
02:33:08,070 --> 02:33:12,210
Mitt Romney and John Mccain,
you didn't represent nothing.

2993
02:33:12,450 --> 02:33:16,740
The reason Donald Trump won is because
finally the shit kickers who worked

2994
02:33:16,741 --> 02:33:21,480
rough and tumble those construction guys
outside the four seasons.

2995
02:33:21,481 --> 02:33:23,370
I stayed at the four seasons.
How cool does that.

2996
02:33:24,370 --> 02:33:27,540
They're busting their ass to getting
approved and they're working hard and to

2997
02:33:27,541 --> 02:33:30,300
go throw back a few beers and have a
little barbecue at night.

2998
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:35,540
These are the guys I'm talking about and
talking to and they're the ones who

2999
02:33:36,030 --> 02:33:38,190
voted for Donald trump.
Finally because he came out,

3000
02:33:38,191 --> 02:33:40,740
he wasn't afraid.
He sounded like a shit kicker.

3001
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:43,560
Really sounded like them.
Sound like us.

3002
02:33:43,570 --> 02:33:45,180
Yeah.
There's a.

3003
02:33:45,400 --> 02:33:48,630
There was a real problem that we have in
this country with people that are career

3004
02:33:48,631 --> 02:33:51,060
politicians and he was really the first
problem.

3005
02:33:51,480 --> 02:33:54,270
Career politicians is the problem.
The status quo.

3006
02:33:54,620 --> 02:33:55,453
That's,
you know,

3007
02:33:55,470 --> 02:33:57,720
Donald Trump isn't perfect.
I liked imperfect,

3008
02:33:57,870 --> 02:33:59,470
imperfect,
just cool you and me.

3009
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:03,660
Good examples,
but he came in swinging a crow bar to

3010
02:34:03,661 --> 02:34:06,590
this horrible status quo that can best
be described as one of.

3011
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:09,690
He's not presidential.
You're goddamn right is not presidential

3012
02:34:09,750 --> 02:34:13,340
because all these presents presidential
guys got us into this mess because there

3013
02:34:13,341 --> 02:34:16,320
were so cautious and they didn't want to
ruffle any feathers.

3014
02:34:16,330 --> 02:34:21,330
We want have a big tent,
including all the bad guys and people

3015
02:34:21,581 --> 02:34:23,920
that don't believe in secure borders.
What is that?

3016
02:34:24,100 --> 02:34:25,900
And people that don't believe in earning
your own way.

3017
02:34:25,930 --> 02:34:27,970
What's that?
People that don't know the difference

3018
02:34:27,971 --> 02:34:30,220
between legal immigration and illegal
immigration.

3019
02:34:30,221 --> 02:34:32,590
What's that?
So the shit kickers.

3020
02:34:32,591 --> 02:34:35,200
Finally her saw somebody busted the
status quo.

3021
02:34:35,201 --> 02:34:37,120
You're damn right,
he's not presidential.

3022
02:34:37,510 --> 02:34:41,320
Presidential got us into this train
wreck and we're done with it.

3023
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:46,010
So the Republicans better be paying
attention because if you're status quo,

3024
02:34:46,011 --> 02:34:47,890
we were not voting for you.

3025
02:34:48,040 --> 02:34:50,380
If you come in swing,
you don't have to be rude enough to be

3026
02:34:50,381 --> 02:34:52,060
screaming,
don't have to be condemning,

3027
02:34:52,270 --> 02:34:55,060
but you have to be honest and forthright
and sound like somebody.

3028
02:34:55,180 --> 02:34:57,010
You'd have a beer with it,
a barbecue,

3029
02:34:57,100 --> 02:34:59,940
and if you sound like a shit kicker and
one of us working our plane out

3030
02:34:59,960 --> 02:35:03,550
Americans and you address our concerns
will vote for you.

3031
02:35:03,670 --> 02:35:06,070
If you don't,
we're going to stay in our tree stand in

3032
02:35:06,071 --> 02:35:08,470
November,
which is what happened traditionally.

3033
02:35:08,560 --> 02:35:11,420
That's why Michigan,
Wisconsin and Pennsylvania with 800,000,

3034
02:35:11,440 --> 02:35:14,050
100,
one it for trump because we are a

3035
02:35:14,051 --> 02:35:18,220
hunter's nation and those families were
a huge voting block.

3036
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:20,860
They'd never felt like they had skin in
the game.

3037
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:23,260
Finally,
somebody had skin in the game,

3038
02:35:23,261 --> 02:35:25,540
including my teamster buddies,
my union buddies,

3039
02:35:25,690 --> 02:35:28,630
instead of just like puppets pulling
that deliberately went,

3040
02:35:29,160 --> 02:35:30,760
the Democrats had been lying to me.

3041
02:35:31,060 --> 02:35:33,850
The Democrats have been scamming me.
I'm voting for trump.

3042
02:35:33,940 --> 02:35:35,960
He's a status quo wrecker.
Yeah.

3043
02:35:35,970 --> 02:35:37,210
Was uh,
when you say look,

3044
02:35:37,211 --> 02:35:38,550
lying and scamming,
what,

3045
02:35:38,570 --> 02:35:39,850
what are you,
what are you examples?

3046
02:35:39,851 --> 02:35:42,160
Like what do you mean?
Good grief.

3047
02:35:42,470 --> 02:35:44,200
But like what?
What gets to you?

3048
02:35:44,201 --> 02:35:46,900
Like what is the thing that you,
when you think of Democrats and you

3049
02:35:46,901 --> 02:35:50,490
think of lying and how about,
what do you think you need to read this?

3050
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:52,810
You need to cite it to find out what's
in it.

3051
02:35:54,100 --> 02:35:58,510
Nancy Pelosi on the House floor with
this huge voluminous healthcare bill

3052
02:35:58,630 --> 02:36:00,790
actually said,
you don't need to read it.

3053
02:36:00,940 --> 02:36:03,040
You need to cite it to find out what's
in it.

3054
02:36:03,770 --> 02:36:06,070
Wow.
You don't remember that?

3055
02:36:06,100 --> 02:36:07,750
No.
Holy Shit.

3056
02:36:07,780 --> 02:36:11,950
That sounds pretty ridiculous.
She said it and then watch her try to

3057
02:36:11,951 --> 02:36:15,700
form a sentence.
Watch maxine water desperately searched

3058
02:36:15,701 --> 02:36:19,000
for a syllable.
Listen to the words out of their mouths.

3059
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:20,860
Well,
the Greeks.

3060
02:36:20,890 --> 02:36:24,340
Did you see this thing that she was
calling out for people to see anyone in

3061
02:36:24,341 --> 02:36:27,040
the administration having dinner?
Including Ted nugent?

3062
02:36:27,070 --> 02:36:28,390
Yeah.
Bring it on,

3063
02:36:28,391 --> 02:36:31,120
asshole.
Disrupt and cause a crowd.

3064
02:36:31,121 --> 02:36:32,950
And tell them what you're not welcomed
every.

3065
02:36:32,951 --> 02:36:35,110
That's an insanely irresponsible thing
to say.

3066
02:36:35,150 --> 02:36:38,050
That's treacherous.
Every one of my promoters have death

3067
02:36:38,051 --> 02:36:42,090
threats because they dare to hire me.
Every one of my band mates and my crew

3068
02:36:42,091 --> 02:36:44,080
mates,
some guys that are building this

3069
02:36:44,081 --> 02:36:45,090
wonderful,
uh,

3070
02:36:45,190 --> 02:36:47,210
a bell amplifier,
the,

3071
02:36:47,360 --> 02:36:50,440
they just showed a picture on their
website with me testing the new

3072
02:36:50,441 --> 02:36:53,110
amplifier and people attacked him and
threatened to kill them because they're

3073
02:36:53,111 --> 02:36:58,111
working with the coward animal murderer
or the the gun nut.

3074
02:36:58,480 --> 02:36:59,690
I'm a gun nut.
I'm also,

3075
02:36:59,691 --> 02:37:02,320
I'm a screwdriver not to,
but that's what I'm saying about you

3076
02:37:02,321 --> 02:37:05,890
being this polarizing figure that people
that aren't looking too deeply into it

3077
02:37:05,891 --> 02:37:09,300
or listening to everything you say,
but you can was thing how.

3078
02:37:09,330 --> 02:37:12,390
How else can you address it?
Because that's why I'm asking.

3079
02:37:12,410 --> 02:37:13,380
Well,
I'm telling you,

3080
02:37:13,470 --> 02:37:16,280
you know Joe,
the guys who have tried own very polite

3081
02:37:16,281 --> 02:37:20,690
and a very nonconfrontational got us
into this mess.

3082
02:37:20,930 --> 02:37:23,690
If you don't believe America needs
secure borders,

3083
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:27,290
you're the enemy of America.
You need secure.

3084
02:37:27,530 --> 02:37:29,720
Who doesn't know you need secure
borders?

3085
02:37:29,780 --> 02:37:32,990
Nancy Pelosi doesn't.
Hillary Clinton didn't have Loretta

3086
02:37:32,990 --> 02:37:34,190
Lynch didn't.
I mean,

3087
02:37:34,191 --> 02:37:35,870
come on.
These people are freaks.

3088
02:37:36,350 --> 02:37:41,350
America first pisses off Democrats.
How can that be if it's not America

3089
02:37:43,580 --> 02:37:44,410
thinkers,

3090
02:37:44,410 --> 02:37:48,330
think of it as you're denying
opportunity to people that live in an

3091
02:37:48,331 --> 02:37:50,820
impoverished third world country that's
connected to us.

3092
02:37:51,090 --> 02:37:52,140
Think of it as racism.

3093
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:57,340
All my ancestors came through Ellis
Island and did mine and denounce their

3094
02:37:57,341 --> 02:38:02,341
allegiance to where they came from.
You can still cook Swedish and still

3095
02:38:03,131 --> 02:38:06,760
cook German,
but you got an announce allegiance to

3096
02:38:06,761 --> 02:38:08,650
where you come from because you're
coming here.

3097
02:38:09,570 --> 02:38:13,590
Of the habits pages per night,
fucking hard for someone to come over

3098
02:38:13,591 --> 02:38:17,060
from Mexico and don't you think that the
real problem is that Mexico sucks or

3099
02:38:17,070 --> 02:38:20,730
they parts of Mexico sock overall.
You figure out a way to help those

3100
02:38:20,731 --> 02:38:23,130
people.
Really the only way would be to make

3101
02:38:23,131 --> 02:38:27,540
Mexico so healthy and and and a great
place to live.

3102
02:38:27,541 --> 02:38:30,630
That it's just like the United States.
There's no reason to come over here and

3103
02:38:30,631 --> 02:38:34,050
certainly we have tried.
Our policies have been very generous to

3104
02:38:34,051 --> 02:38:36,870
those countries were in fact we're the
only country that has been generous to

3105
02:38:36,871 --> 02:38:39,070
them,
but the massive.

3106
02:38:39,630 --> 02:38:41,960
Yeah,
massive corruption.

3107
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:44,220
Hire Mexican,
Guatemalan.

3108
02:38:44,580 --> 02:38:49,440
All those governments are as criminals.
Al Capone in Chicago and 32.

3109
02:38:49,730 --> 02:38:53,250
I mean,
so infested by the law enforcement is

3110
02:38:53,251 --> 02:38:55,560
the cartel.
The military is the cocktail,

3111
02:38:56,070 --> 02:39:00,630
so where do you next?
We have the right to secure,

3112
02:39:00,631 --> 02:39:05,631
but this is not my opinion.
We in America have the right and the

3113
02:39:06,181 --> 02:39:10,500
responsibility to secure our borders.
If you think otherwise,

3114
02:39:10,680 --> 02:39:13,740
your dangerous.
We need to break.

3115
02:39:13,830 --> 02:39:17,100
I want people who need a better quality
of life.

3116
02:39:17,101 --> 02:39:20,640
I welcome them.
I got buddies that came like that,

3117
02:39:21,060 --> 02:39:22,140
my,
my sound man,

3118
02:39:22,141 --> 02:39:26,030
frank went through the seven year
process from Germany and now he's

3119
02:39:26,050 --> 02:39:29,550
illegal citizen in America.
Why should someone be able to swim

3120
02:39:29,551 --> 02:39:33,900
across the Rio Grande and circumvent all
that process so we know whether you're

3121
02:39:33,901 --> 02:39:37,650
going to be an asset or a liability.
It's not rocket science.

3122
02:39:37,980 --> 02:39:42,980
It's liability or asset.
We want assets and that's why our

3123
02:39:44,731 --> 02:39:47,460
immigration system is horrific.

3124
02:39:47,460 --> 02:39:49,980
Even the legal one,
so I know it's a problem,

3125
02:39:50,100 --> 02:39:54,900
but we're putting all these resources
and man hours into securing the poorest

3126
02:39:54,901 --> 02:39:59,901
border instead of processing those who
legitimately would like a better quality

3127
02:40:00,331 --> 02:40:02,580
of life in America,
but first they have to.

3128
02:40:02,640 --> 02:40:06,600
We have to differentiate between the
protesters who think that we need to

3129
02:40:06,601 --> 02:40:11,580
turn over California and Arizona and
Texas back to Mexico so it can turn into

3130
02:40:11,581 --> 02:40:12,990
a shit hole.
Of course,

3131
02:40:13,170 --> 02:40:15,240
left Mexico.
They know it's horrible.

3132
02:40:15,300 --> 02:40:18,450
That's why they're here.
Why would you come here to get away from

3133
02:40:18,451 --> 02:40:22,740
a Shithole and then turn the place you
came to into the shit hole.

3134
02:40:23,250 --> 02:40:26,310
We have a constitution.
We have a bill of rights.

3135
02:40:26,460 --> 02:40:31,460
You need to earn your own way.
You need to work very hard if you're in

3136
02:40:31,621 --> 02:40:34,560
the asset column,
I love you.

3137
02:40:34,830 --> 02:40:38,670
If you're in the liability column,
I love you if you're having hard times,

3138
02:40:38,820 --> 02:40:43,820
but if you have squatted intentionally
as an able bodied individual in that

3139
02:40:44,161 --> 02:40:48,360
liability column,
you are a detriment to America and you

3140
02:40:48,361 --> 02:40:49,860
should get the fuck outta here.

3141
02:40:50,010 --> 02:40:51,540
That's when you look at it in
perspective.

3142
02:40:51,541 --> 02:40:54,510
The people that are able bodied
Americans that don't do Jack Shit and

3143
02:40:54,511 --> 02:40:58,410
some poor bastard is trying to do
anything they can to get here from

3144
02:40:58,411 --> 02:41:02,310
Mexico to the point where they're
literally dying and hydration in the

3145
02:41:02,470 --> 02:41:03,390
desert.
Yeah,

3146
02:41:03,570 --> 02:41:05,680
and they would bust their ass if given
that opportunity.

3147
02:41:05,700 --> 02:41:09,540
So it's not fair.
It's not easy and it's never going to be

3148
02:41:09,541 --> 02:41:10,880
easy advocated,
but.

3149
02:41:10,980 --> 02:41:14,100
But it is doable.
But our priorities as a government are

3150
02:41:14,101 --> 02:41:19,101
so clustered.
There's so just prioritized that all

3151
02:41:21,841 --> 02:41:26,841
this efforts going towards securing the
Rio Grande when people are illegally

3152
02:41:27,481 --> 02:41:31,140
swimming across and jeopardizing their
very life and limb when just down a

3153
02:41:31,141 --> 02:41:33,750
couple of miles.
There's a legal entrance and it might be

3154
02:41:33,751 --> 02:41:36,990
a pain in the ass,
but you're here with me today,

3155
02:41:37,560 --> 02:41:39,150
June 28th,
20,

3156
02:41:39,380 --> 02:41:43,830
2018.
Have you not put up with major pains in

3157
02:41:43,831 --> 02:41:46,020
the ass as a martial artist,
as a comedian,

3158
02:41:46,021 --> 02:41:47,220
that's a tough life.

3159
02:41:47,730 --> 02:41:52,730
You got your world carved out because
you put up with a pain in the ass and

3160
02:41:53,011 --> 02:41:53,400
you.
Oh,

3161
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:55,200
you improvise,
adapt and overcome.

3162
02:41:55,470 --> 02:41:59,760
It makes you happier at night.
It was very fortunate.

3163
02:41:59,761 --> 02:42:01,640
I was born in America.
I,

3164
02:42:01,641 --> 02:42:03,780
you know,
I didn't grow up in an impoverished

3165
02:42:03,781 --> 02:42:07,530
crime ridden community.
Understood to deal with gang violence,

3166
02:42:07,531 --> 02:42:10,140
but you're certainly not advocating them
coming in illegally.

3167
02:42:10,230 --> 02:42:12,450
No,
I just think there's gotta be.

3168
02:42:12,840 --> 02:42:16,200
There's gotta be a better conversation
about this and I think that the

3169
02:42:16,201 --> 02:42:19,620
conversation is that if you oppose these
people that are illegal,

3170
02:42:19,630 --> 02:42:21,660
immigrating illegally,
immigrated into this country,

3171
02:42:21,661 --> 02:42:24,450
that you're a racist.
So is what's going on right now.

3172
02:42:24,451 --> 02:42:26,090
My Bass player,
Mark Mendoza's,

3173
02:42:26,220 --> 02:42:29,040
I'm Mexican and my bass player,
Johnny gunnels,

3174
02:42:29,041 --> 02:42:31,890
a black guy,
but it's simple to call people racist.

3175
02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:34,600
Like people love to do that.
They love to reduce you down that,

3176
02:42:35,820 --> 02:42:36,720
but it's cruel.

3177
02:42:36,770 --> 02:42:38,220
It's,
it's ignorance.

3178
02:42:38,370 --> 02:42:40,890
It's a denial of nuance.
So that's a,

3179
02:42:40,950 --> 02:42:43,920
that's a tsunami of accusations against
me.

3180
02:42:44,070 --> 02:42:48,060
And I've always made it perfectly clear
throughout my 70 year life,

3181
02:42:48,290 --> 02:42:51,210
I have always judged by content of
character,

3182
02:42:51,570 --> 02:42:55,260
never by color of skin.
I have to admit there is a racist

3183
02:42:55,261 --> 02:42:58,860
element in me because I'm going to
expect a black guy to be able to play

3184
02:42:58,861 --> 02:43:01,680
better groove than a white guy that has
been,

3185
02:43:01,970 --> 02:43:04,320
uh,
had been overruled over the years

3186
02:43:04,321 --> 02:43:08,430
because there's so many white guys that
learned from the black masters that now

3187
02:43:08,431 --> 02:43:11,500
it is raceless.
But in growing up,

3188
02:43:11,501 --> 02:43:14,320
I always figured the black guy would be
a better musician.

3189
02:43:14,660 --> 02:43:19,270
I'm in a racist against white people in
the early days it was that way.

3190
02:43:19,410 --> 02:43:23,140
Um,
but nowadays we learn from those black

3191
02:43:23,141 --> 02:43:28,141
soul artists that were the consummate
definitive authority of emotional music

3192
02:43:29,710 --> 02:43:32,770
from the James Brown,
the funk brothers and chuck and Bo and

3193
02:43:32,771 --> 02:43:37,771
little Richard and bb and Freddy and
Albert and Ali's monster black heroes of

3194
02:43:38,261 --> 02:43:39,040
everybody's.

3195
02:43:39,040 --> 02:43:41,320
And there's not a musician in the world
that won't admit that.

3196
02:43:41,860 --> 02:43:44,710
But now,
because of that influence all these

3197
02:43:44,710 --> 02:43:45,461
years,
uh,

3198
02:43:45,461 --> 02:43:47,370
the white boys,
um,

3199
02:43:47,430 --> 02:43:49,300
can keep right up there with them.
In fact,

3200
02:43:49,301 --> 02:43:52,080
in many instances,
a compared to a lot of the rap and the

3201
02:43:52,081 --> 02:43:53,280
hip hop,
um,

3202
02:43:53,281 --> 02:43:55,330
there's a whole lot of white guys out
there.

3203
02:43:55,331 --> 02:44:00,331
I think a job on a Masa and Anton Fagan,
certainly Jason Heartless and Greg Smith

3204
02:44:00,670 --> 02:44:03,580
and all the guys narrows Smith and Zz
top.

3205
02:44:03,581 --> 02:44:05,170
I mean,
you close your eyes and there's not a

3206
02:44:05,171 --> 02:44:08,710
Caucasian to be found in these bands
nowadays soul wise.

3207
02:44:08,800 --> 02:44:10,750
So yeah,
it raised the,

3208
02:44:10,810 --> 02:44:11,800
the,
the,

3209
02:44:12,370 --> 02:44:17,050
the repugnant.
I'm dishonest.

3210
02:44:17,590 --> 02:44:22,390
Charge of racism is completely.
It's one that you can't shake.

3211
02:44:22,420 --> 02:44:25,000
Just somebody calls you a racist and
heat it,

3212
02:44:25,640 --> 02:44:28,930
but people have called you a racist.
Everybody,

3213
02:44:28,990 --> 02:44:31,820
everybody with a heart and a soul knows
I'm not in a,

3214
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:32,740
you have,
you know,

3215
02:44:32,740 --> 02:44:34,060
you know who the racists are.

3216
02:44:34,060 --> 02:44:38,590
People that call me a racist.
Those are the racists while and dirt

3217
02:44:38,591 --> 02:44:39,850
bags to be.
It's just,

3218
02:44:40,390 --> 02:44:45,160
it's an unfair thing to do that people
like to do because it automatically puts

3219
02:44:45,161 --> 02:44:47,680
you on the defensive.
You're automatically on your heels and

3220
02:44:47,681 --> 02:44:50,650
you have to defend this charge against
raising by proving you're not a racist,

3221
02:44:50,770 --> 02:44:53,310
which makes people suspicious that you
might be raised and Speidel.

3222
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:54,540
Yeah.
I'm just,

3223
02:44:54,550 --> 02:44:57,940
I just live a great life with great
people and race,

3224
02:44:58,060 --> 02:44:59,500
creed,
ethnicity,

3225
02:44:59,501 --> 02:45:00,820
religion,
gender,

3226
02:45:01,240 --> 02:45:03,780
gender,
confusion matters.

3227
02:45:03,880 --> 02:45:05,950
What do you think about that?
I think,

3228
02:45:06,040 --> 02:45:10,150
I think Caitlin,
I think Caitlin,

3229
02:45:10,151 --> 02:45:12,490
because I beat him in all the races we
raced against.

3230
02:45:13,300 --> 02:45:17,050
That's what it is.
I pray for Bruce.

3231
02:45:17,080 --> 02:45:18,040
Katelyn.
Like,

3232
02:45:18,450 --> 02:45:22,000
what a great guy or a girl.
Now I will,

3233
02:45:22,001 --> 02:45:24,520
if that's what he said,
if that's what she likes.

3234
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:26,590
It's a weird one,
right?

3235
02:45:26,591 --> 02:45:26,860
Yeah.

3236
02:45:26,860 --> 02:45:28,360
Where was this when you were a kid?
Yes.

3237
02:45:28,410 --> 02:45:28,961
It's,
it's,

3238
02:45:28,961 --> 02:45:32,140
it's a different arena of thought.
Um,

3239
02:45:32,530 --> 02:45:37,530
and only she can make that choice and
you have to respect that choice.

3240
02:45:37,790 --> 02:45:40,120
It,
it's mind twisting,

3241
02:45:40,150 --> 02:45:42,400
twisting in.
Anybody says it's not,

3242
02:45:42,401 --> 02:45:43,870
it's not being honest,
but,

3243
02:45:43,890 --> 02:45:44,680
uh,
it's,

3244
02:45:44,680 --> 02:45:46,570
it's very strange.
Diane Sawyer.

3245
02:45:46,571 --> 02:45:48,730
God love her,
but she had the opportunity of a

3246
02:45:48,731 --> 02:45:51,940
lifetime when she was interviewing bruce
and he was saying,

3247
02:45:51,941 --> 02:45:53,590
you know,
for all practical purposes,

3248
02:45:53,980 --> 02:45:55,120
um,
I'm a,

3249
02:45:55,180 --> 02:45:58,390
I'm a woman.
And she said she should've said,

3250
02:45:58,391 --> 02:45:59,570
yeah,
except for the Dick.

3251
02:46:00,790 --> 02:46:05,790
But I raced against her if she did say I
wish like that man.

3252
02:46:06,330 --> 02:46:07,163
Uh,
but I,

3253
02:46:07,260 --> 02:46:09,040
I,
I got to be friends with Bruce.

3254
02:46:09,170 --> 02:46:11,740
He was the god of manliness.
Yeah,

3255
02:46:11,960 --> 02:46:13,910
the gold medalist on everything.
It was just the,

3256
02:46:14,530 --> 02:46:18,350
the baddest motherfucker hurdled the
earth.

3257
02:46:19,050 --> 02:46:22,500
And I raced with them in off road races
and stuff and I always beat him,

3258
02:46:23,780 --> 02:46:26,240
which was just shit luck because I was
more aggressive.

3259
02:46:26,720 --> 02:46:29,070
And uh,
he was a great guy and I spent a

3260
02:46:29,140 --> 02:46:30,030
suspect.
He's still,

3261
02:46:30,230 --> 02:46:32,490
she's still a great gal.
Yeah,

3262
02:46:32,600 --> 02:46:33,231
I mean,
I,

3263
02:46:33,231 --> 02:46:36,350
I respect everyone's choice to do
whatever you want as long as we're

3264
02:46:36,390 --> 02:46:38,570
reading people.
And that fills right into that category.

3265
02:46:38,630 --> 02:46:43,130
Absolutely.
How many people have come to you that

3266
02:46:43,131 --> 02:46:44,700
you run into in,
in all your,

3267
02:46:44,701 --> 02:46:45,291
your,
you know,

3268
02:46:45,291 --> 02:46:49,050
your circles and musicians and the son
of a bitch,

3269
02:46:49,110 --> 02:46:51,350
like,
curious about hunting that didn't know

3270
02:46:51,351 --> 02:46:54,470
where to start because that's one of the
things that comes to me a lot.

3271
02:46:54,560 --> 02:46:57,800
People like I want to get it.
I have so many comedians is great,

3272
02:46:57,801 --> 02:46:58,634
isn't it?
Yeah.

3273
02:46:58,700 --> 02:47:00,020
And they don't know how to get started.
And I'm like,

3274
02:47:00,021 --> 02:47:01,760
man,
I wish I had the time to take you,

3275
02:47:02,150 --> 02:47:04,820
but I don't,
I barely have enough time to go myself.

3276
02:47:04,880 --> 02:47:07,940
I've witnessed you articulate it and
you're doing a great job and I thank you

3277
02:47:07,941 --> 02:47:11,600
for that and I salute you and you've
made great progress in inroads in that

3278
02:47:11,601 --> 02:47:14,960
arena of ignorance and a
presumptuousness.

3279
02:47:15,470 --> 02:47:18,980
But I'm very blessed because I'm a loud
mouth and I'm alive.

3280
02:47:18,981 --> 02:47:23,960
I mean I'm engaged.
I exercised my duties as we the people

3281
02:47:23,961 --> 02:47:28,961
to talk about policies and getting the
face of my elected employees and hold

3282
02:47:29,781 --> 02:47:32,780
them to constitutional accountability.
And I'm like,

3283
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:35,900
I missed the concord bridge.
So I'm here doing this now.

3284
02:47:36,380 --> 02:47:41,380
And I in my everyday walk at the Sushi
restaurant at the gas station,

3285
02:47:43,671 --> 02:47:45,830
at the feed mill,
at the charity event.

3286
02:47:46,100 --> 02:47:50,300
People always coming up.
And those that would hesitate,

3287
02:47:50,301 --> 02:47:53,090
I guess never showed up because I never
felt any hesitation.

3288
02:47:53,330 --> 02:47:55,960
They're always genuinely intrigued.
And they express,

3289
02:47:56,420 --> 02:48:00,260
um,
confusion and uncomfortableness,

3290
02:48:00,290 --> 02:48:03,320
discomfort with the concept of killing
game.

3291
02:48:03,720 --> 02:48:07,160
Uh,
but within minutes when I talk about

3292
02:48:07,220 --> 02:48:09,650
sustained yield,
habitat carrying capacity,

3293
02:48:09,830 --> 02:48:14,830
just simple,
readily understood earthly logistics,

3294
02:48:15,920 --> 02:48:16,610
um,
they go,

3295
02:48:16,610 --> 02:48:18,030
I never thought of it like that before
he,

3296
02:48:18,120 --> 02:48:19,340
even,
whether they're going to have babies

3297
02:48:19,341 --> 02:48:22,550
next year and there's not going to be
any new ground,

3298
02:48:22,730 --> 02:48:26,570
we're going to have to grow next year as
wildlife on the existing habitat and in

3299
02:48:26,571 --> 02:48:29,090
most cases reduced habitat.

3300
02:48:29,240 --> 02:48:32,300
But thank God the cougars can live in
your backyard and the bears can live in

3301
02:48:32,301 --> 02:48:36,240
the Culdesac and Pennsylvania and
coyotes that live in your bathroom if

3302
02:48:36,320 --> 02:48:40,310
you don't lock the door.
So wildlife has adapted miraculously.

3303
02:48:40,520 --> 02:48:44,540
I mean geese and ducks and turkeys and
deer and elk and bear.

3304
02:48:44,541 --> 02:48:46,420
They're literally everywhere.
Check out,

3305
02:48:46,590 --> 02:48:48,500
uh,
at estes park in Colorado.

3306
02:48:48,501 --> 02:48:51,290
I mean their,
their landscaping,

3307
02:48:51,291 --> 02:48:54,740
destructo derby.
So we don't need to worry about

3308
02:48:55,130 --> 02:48:59,210
encroaching on habitat because they will
adapt and they have wonderful.

3309
02:48:59,330 --> 02:49:00,740
And again,
more deer,

3310
02:49:01,130 --> 02:49:02,810
more elk,
more cougar,

3311
02:49:02,960 --> 02:49:04,320
more bare,
more tricky,

3312
02:49:04,321 --> 02:49:06,950
more geese than ever in recorded
history.

3313
02:49:07,050 --> 02:49:11,130
And we're slaughtering them by the
gazillions every year because they

3314
02:49:11,270 --> 02:49:15,900
growed gazillions every year.
And once I expressed it to people like

3315
02:49:15,901 --> 02:49:17,550
that,
and then I inject the,

3316
02:49:17,640 --> 02:49:22,640
the inescapable truism you talk organic,
you talk close to the earth quality,

3317
02:49:24,990 --> 02:49:28,860
real food.
Is there something better than venison

3318
02:49:28,900 --> 02:49:29,490
eye?

3319
02:49:29,490 --> 02:49:32,040
Because if there is,
I want some of this conversation is what

3320
02:49:32,041 --> 02:49:34,530
I'm talking about.
People don't know how to get started.

3321
02:49:34,560 --> 02:49:38,100
They hear about that and there's all
this talk about organic and you know,

3322
02:49:38,280 --> 02:49:41,070
close to nature and being connected to
your food,

3323
02:49:41,340 --> 02:49:43,950
but they don't know how to.
It's pretty easy to start a garden if

3324
02:49:43,951 --> 02:49:45,480
you have a yard,
but to,

3325
02:49:45,530 --> 02:49:49,740
to start hunting.
That's a great barrier to entry there

3326
02:49:49,741 --> 02:49:52,320
is.
But it's easily overcome.

3327
02:49:52,710 --> 02:49:53,730
Um,
and go again,

3328
02:49:53,731 --> 02:49:57,090
go to my facebook.
I mean not just to be made my facebook,

3329
02:49:57,091 --> 02:50:02,091
but I am the,
the glow worm of the hunting lifestyle.

3330
02:50:02,341 --> 02:50:04,650
I mean,
people have always come to me for that

3331
02:50:05,070 --> 02:50:08,520
because I've always promoted it and I've
never backed down and almost every

3332
02:50:08,560 --> 02:50:12,900
interviewer brings it up since the 19
sixties because it was the tip of the

3333
02:50:12,901 --> 02:50:15,120
culture work.
Controversial spear.

3334
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:19,440
It really was hunting and guns.
Those are the tip of the culture war

3335
02:50:19,530 --> 02:50:23,560
from the beginning because people were
moving from urban self-sufficient,

3336
02:50:23,640 --> 02:50:24,271
hunting,
fishing,

3337
02:50:24,271 --> 02:50:27,120
trapping,
earthly lifestyles to the city where

3338
02:50:27,121 --> 02:50:30,310
they were catered to and they didn't
hear the chickens squawking,

3339
02:50:30,330 --> 02:50:32,600
so they didn't feel responsible for its
death.

3340
02:50:32,870 --> 02:50:35,300
Right.
If you haven't caught on blue era

3341
02:50:35,301 --> 02:50:36,200
killer,
yeah.

3342
02:50:36,510 --> 02:50:37,740
That is the problem.
When I,

3343
02:50:37,770 --> 02:50:38,940
when I expressed that,
they go,

3344
02:50:38,941 --> 02:50:40,150
hey,
you got a point there and I went,

3345
02:50:40,160 --> 02:50:42,270
yeah,
I think so.

3346
02:50:42,510 --> 02:50:47,510
I use blunt street term nomenclature and
easily identified colloquialisms of of

3347
02:50:52,500 --> 02:50:57,500
modern terminology that is timeless and
it it registers with them quickly now

3348
02:50:59,640 --> 02:51:02,550
getting over the hump to have access to
hunting ground.

3349
02:51:02,790 --> 02:51:06,780
I also have been effective in educating
people on that because everybody's got

3350
02:51:06,781 --> 02:51:09,870
an uncle Joe.
Everybody's got access to some state or

3351
02:51:09,871 --> 02:51:14,760
federal open ground and even though the
hunting isn't very quality on those

3352
02:51:14,761 --> 02:51:18,870
public areas,
oftentimes if you are willing to pursue

3353
02:51:19,050 --> 02:51:24,050
what should have inspired you to ask
about hunting and that means to go

3354
02:51:24,121 --> 02:51:27,180
beyond the beaten path,
which is part of the spiritual

3355
02:51:27,181 --> 02:51:28,014
experience.

3356
02:51:28,080 --> 02:51:33,080
Leaving the modern Kush and getting into
a wild area.

3357
02:51:33,390 --> 02:51:36,050
I find that a lot of my new,
uh,

3358
02:51:36,180 --> 02:51:38,580
baptized hunting,
young,

3359
02:51:38,581 --> 02:51:42,120
old and otherwise,
that they like going deep and they will

3360
02:51:42,121 --> 02:51:44,970
find that deer that's not on the fringes
of public ground,

3361
02:51:44,971 --> 02:51:49,620
that have already been so pressured that
they moved into the anterior nucleus of

3362
02:51:49,650 --> 02:51:52,620
more sanctuary habitat.
And these guys,

3363
02:51:52,640 --> 02:51:55,500
it's almost cry.
They're so happy.

3364
02:51:55,560 --> 02:51:58,800
Even if they didn't get something
because I got in there and it took me

3365
02:51:58,801 --> 02:52:02,490
two hours to get in.
There was still dark and I was concerned

3366
02:52:02,491 --> 02:52:04,800
about my safety.
I'd never been that deep in the woods

3367
02:52:04,810 --> 02:52:06,340
before the manistee national forest

3368
02:52:06,340 --> 02:52:09,880
in Michigan or any wild ground.
Colorado,

3369
02:52:09,881 --> 02:52:10,870
Wyoming,
Montana,

3370
02:52:10,990 --> 02:52:12,760
California.
And they said,

3371
02:52:13,060 --> 02:52:13,990
you're right,
ted.

3372
02:52:14,890 --> 02:52:19,150
It's changed my life.
Just watching that deer come down.

3373
02:52:19,151 --> 02:52:22,480
I forgot to draw my bow.
So it,

3374
02:52:22,550 --> 02:52:24,040
it,
it's an immediate

3375
02:52:27,430 --> 02:52:32,430
alive snus that is rarely available in a
modern setting except for great family

3376
02:52:35,561 --> 02:52:36,700
times.
Birth,

3377
02:52:37,840 --> 02:52:39,760
death,
sex,

3378
02:52:41,500 --> 02:52:44,200
laughter around a campfire,
primal moments,

3379
02:52:44,230 --> 02:52:45,760
primal,
primal moments.

3380
02:52:45,761 --> 02:52:48,580
Yes.
I call it a prayer for the wild things.

3381
02:52:48,581 --> 02:52:50,440
I actually wrote this in the New York
Times,

3382
02:52:50,441 --> 02:52:52,010
way back in the,
uh,

3383
02:52:52,120 --> 02:52:55,600
I guess it was the eighties.
I wrote a New York Times Sunday magazine

3384
02:52:55,601 --> 02:53:00,601
feature about my Christmas Buck and I've
written it in all kinds of places and

3385
02:53:02,321 --> 02:53:05,980
I'm amazed that people still question
whether I'm serious about hunting or

3386
02:53:05,981 --> 02:53:06,880
not.
I bet you kidding me.

3387
02:53:06,881 --> 02:53:09,450
I've written New York Times bestsellers
and the number one showing up your

3388
02:53:09,460 --> 02:53:12,070
channel for 30 years almost.
Who questions whether or not you're

3389
02:53:12,071 --> 02:53:13,060
serious about hunting?

3390
02:53:13,060 --> 02:53:13,893
Yeah,
I did.

3391
02:53:14,080 --> 02:53:15,700
Someone actually questions?
Yeah,

3392
02:53:15,730 --> 02:53:18,890
just did not sure what it's all about.
Um,

3393
02:53:19,320 --> 02:53:20,620
well they don't know what it's all
about.

3394
02:53:20,650 --> 02:53:23,970
Being receptive to my statements are
just a,

3395
02:53:23,980 --> 02:53:26,800
how can you not?
How can you avoid them?

3396
02:53:27,420 --> 02:53:30,940
I mean there's many people that would
hear about you and then immediately go,

3397
02:53:30,941 --> 02:53:32,080
oh,
fuck that guy.

3398
02:53:32,081 --> 02:53:34,720
I heard him talk sit.
He said fuck.

3399
02:53:34,721 --> 02:53:36,400
And he called somebody a motherfucker.
Shit.

3400
02:53:36,820 --> 02:53:39,550
He did something.
And you've never been on the street.

3401
02:53:39,551 --> 02:53:41,590
Really the street.
You've never been on the street.

3402
02:53:41,591 --> 02:53:44,140
You've never heard this language before.
You lying sack of shit.

3403
02:53:45,010 --> 02:53:47,740
Being this polarizing guy though,
does it get exhausting?

3404
02:53:47,741 --> 02:53:50,100
Like so many people hungry in Tom faker
rating.

3405
02:53:50,390 --> 02:53:54,700
You don't get tired of constantly doing
well in battle with people,

3406
02:53:54,880 --> 02:53:56,560
but I don't,
I don't do battle.

3407
02:53:56,561 --> 02:53:58,300
I merely put out the truth,
logic,

3408
02:53:58,301 --> 02:53:59,860
common sense,
the science.

3409
02:54:00,310 --> 02:54:02,140
It's irrefutable.
It's not my opinion.

3410
02:54:02,141 --> 02:54:04,990
I have no opinion on.
And I'm just genuflect at the altar of

3411
02:54:04,991 --> 02:54:06,100
truth,
logic,

3412
02:54:06,101 --> 02:54:09,040
common sense of science.
And I share it.

3413
02:54:09,280 --> 02:54:11,530
And if you can't grasp it,
you work on it.

3414
02:54:11,531 --> 02:54:13,380
And I'm here if you need me.
Um,

3415
02:54:13,900 --> 02:54:17,590
but you clearly like it.
You liked Pierce Morgan interviews?

3416
02:54:17,620 --> 02:54:19,840
Yes.
Because without me,

3417
02:54:21,210 --> 02:54:26,210
who's going to do it right there lies
will stand their,

3418
02:54:26,321 --> 02:54:28,780
their,
their dishonesty.

3419
02:54:29,020 --> 02:54:31,170
And they're mean spirited.
Well,

3420
02:54:31,171 --> 02:54:33,620
why do you think they have these low?
Why do you think a good cause?

3421
02:54:33,621 --> 02:54:35,020
There's.
Morgan does.

3422
02:54:35,050 --> 02:54:39,520
He's been so removed.
They are so satisfied that they say

3423
02:54:39,521 --> 02:54:42,160
five.
They think their cord on blue didn't

3424
02:54:42,190 --> 02:54:45,490
die.
They think that their pulled pork

3425
02:54:45,491 --> 02:54:48,580
sandwich came like that.
And,

3426
02:54:48,730 --> 02:54:53,530
and within just minutes,
an honest person will admit that they're

3427
02:54:53,531 --> 02:54:55,810
Tofu.
Salad has a whole bunch of dead ground

3428
02:54:55,811 --> 02:54:57,370
squirrels and it's vapor trail.

3429
02:54:57,640 --> 02:54:59,230
And,
but unless they're,

3430
02:54:59,380 --> 02:55:01,570
unless I tell them then what nobody else
can I tell them,

3431
02:55:01,780 --> 02:55:03,560
well,
another thing that's a big spot,

3432
02:55:03,561 --> 02:55:05,750
if they don't understand where
conservation money comes from,

3433
02:55:05,751 --> 02:55:10,370
when you talk to them about the Pickman
Robertson or talk to them about how many

3434
02:55:10,430 --> 02:55:14,990
billions of dollars every year and
generated from sales of ammunition,

3435
02:55:14,991 --> 02:55:17,650
hunting gear,
bows and arrows and all that stuff.

3436
02:55:17,930 --> 02:55:20,990
We selfimposed that the hundreds before
our time.

3437
02:55:20,991 --> 02:55:22,300
But yeah,
the hunters.

3438
02:55:22,730 --> 02:55:24,240
There wasn't before my time,
but yeah,

3439
02:55:24,260 --> 02:55:29,260
it was that.
Well a 30 the dingle Robert Pitchman,

3440
02:55:29,801 --> 02:55:33,020
he edited.
It was almost a Teddy Roosevelt thing,

3441
02:55:33,530 --> 02:55:38,530
but the real battle cry was in my
lifetime.

3442
02:55:38,931 --> 02:55:40,220
We.
There was no anti hunting.

3443
02:55:40,260 --> 02:55:45,260
First 10 years of my life.
It was the concrete jungle citification

3444
02:55:46,281 --> 02:55:49,430
removal from the system by which we are
sustained.

3445
02:55:49,850 --> 02:55:54,290
That was a convenient disconnect and you
could deny it because you didn't hear

3446
02:55:54,291 --> 02:55:56,540
the animals die,
didn't see the blood.

3447
02:55:56,540 --> 02:55:59,570
It was nice and cleaned up in the little
cellophane package.

3448
02:55:59,990 --> 02:56:04,550
And then this is new over the last few
generations and that denial metastasized

3449
02:56:04,551 --> 02:56:09,380
into a cult of make believe and fantasy.
But to their credit,

3450
02:56:09,810 --> 02:56:14,810
and there is only a lunatic fringe,
I don't believe that the animal rights,

3451
02:56:15,110 --> 02:56:17,780
even though they've succeeded,
and in California,

3452
02:56:18,290 --> 02:56:21,620
they are run into dead end brick wall
everywhere else.

3453
02:56:21,800 --> 02:56:26,800
Even though in Michigan the dirtbags
succeeded in banning the hunting of the

3454
02:56:26,931 --> 02:56:30,800
number one game animal on planet earth.
The morning dove where we grow more

3455
02:56:30,801 --> 02:56:32,690
doves in Michigan than all the quail
pheasant,

3456
02:56:32,691 --> 02:56:34,820
woodcock and grouse combined.
That's a weird one,

3457
02:56:34,821 --> 02:56:36,890
right?
Because Doug's been people who've never

3458
02:56:36,891 --> 02:56:37,510
eaten,
dove.

3459
02:56:37,510 --> 02:56:39,510
They don't know the delicious.
And you hear about a dub,

3460
02:56:39,511 --> 02:56:40,071
you go,
wait a minute.

3461
02:56:40,071 --> 02:56:41,780
That's piece.
You can't shoot p.

3462
02:56:41,781 --> 02:56:43,730
This is.
This isn't an analogy of everything

3463
02:56:43,731 --> 02:56:46,010
that's wrong in America,
you're killing piece.

3464
02:56:46,370 --> 02:56:49,670
You're killing piece.
But what is a lunatic fringe though?

3465
02:56:49,760 --> 02:56:51,770
It really is a lunatic fringe.
It's.

3466
02:56:51,860 --> 02:56:55,970
It's a convenient opinion because it
seems like it's sensible.

3467
02:56:56,150 --> 02:56:57,620
Yeah.
You're shooting a dove.

3468
02:56:57,621 --> 02:56:59,120
Why would you shoot a dove Ted,
and you're like,

3469
02:56:59,121 --> 02:57:01,220
listen,
I'm going to cook up some dub for you.

3470
02:57:01,550 --> 02:57:03,780
And then you tell me why wouldn't shoot
it up?

3471
02:57:04,740 --> 02:57:06,910
Is it okay to shoot a chicken?
It's not okay to shoot a dove.

3472
02:57:06,911 --> 02:57:11,780
Why is it okay to shoot a pheasant is
not as you have much to pragmatic joe

3473
02:57:11,850 --> 02:57:14,240
and watched the logic.
You might hurt somebody.

3474
02:57:14,270 --> 02:57:16,770
Conversations don't take place.
Thank you.

3475
02:57:16,940 --> 02:57:20,780
Thank God you've been baptized because
this has a great impact because your

3476
02:57:20,930 --> 02:57:23,900
average listener does not come to
hearing haunting truth.

3477
02:57:24,020 --> 02:57:29,020
Your average listener comes to hear
smart ass a dialogue in issue review and

3478
02:57:30,321 --> 02:57:34,670
intellectual analysis of life's
experiences.

3479
02:57:34,970 --> 02:57:36,290
All good,
all perfect,

3480
02:57:36,620 --> 02:57:41,620
but that you have inflicted and injected
the truth about conservation wise use

3481
02:57:42,631 --> 02:57:45,380
wildlife management is a Hallelujah
moment,

3482
02:57:45,440 --> 02:57:49,310
which is why I'm sitting across from you
today because I value that and a lot of

3483
02:57:49,311 --> 02:57:52,940
it I got honestly from people like you
that were enthusiastic about it.

3484
02:57:52,940 --> 02:57:56,000
That got me curious.
When I saw how enthusiastic you are

3485
02:57:56,001 --> 02:57:59,090
about hunting and about the eating of
wild meat and how much energy it gives

3486
02:57:59,091 --> 02:58:01,410
you.
I got very curious many years before I

3487
02:58:01,411 --> 02:58:06,270
ever started hunting because because I.
I saw a lot of those p to videos.

3488
02:58:06,271 --> 02:58:10,140
We see these horrific conditions in
factory farms and I didn't want to be a

3489
02:58:10,141 --> 02:58:15,141
part of that was trying to figure out
how to not be a part of that and so when

3490
02:58:15,181 --> 02:58:18,830
I first decided to start hunting,
but before that I was making two

3491
02:58:18,870 --> 02:58:20,280
decisions,
either I'm going to do this and I'm

3492
02:58:20,281 --> 02:58:23,340
going to hate it and I'm never going to
do it again and I'm going to be a

3493
02:58:23,341 --> 02:58:25,680
vegetarian or I'm going to become a
hunter,

3494
02:58:25,710 --> 02:58:28,170
and the moment I shot that deer and then
we ate it,

3495
02:58:28,171 --> 02:58:28,681
I was like,
oh,

3496
02:58:28,681 --> 02:58:29,630
I'm doing this forever.

3497
02:58:29,660 --> 02:58:31,290
Metrics.
Zuckerberg actually came out and

3498
02:58:31,291 --> 02:58:33,300
admitted that if he's going to eat
flesh,

3499
02:58:33,540 --> 02:58:36,000
he's going to kill it himself,
but he did it for a whole year and

3500
02:58:36,001 --> 02:58:37,650
everything he ate,
he killed.

3501
02:58:37,950 --> 02:58:40,650
You know,
and I think that people would have a

3502
02:58:40,651 --> 02:58:44,370
better understanding of what their food
is and when you have these conversations

3503
02:58:44,371 --> 02:58:45,210
with people,
when it talks,

3504
02:58:45,240 --> 02:58:47,630
when it comes to animal rights ideas and
what shouldn't,

3505
02:58:47,640 --> 02:58:50,280
shouldn't be legal 90,
what,

3506
02:58:50,310 --> 02:58:54,480
five 97 percent of the people eat meat.
I mean,

3507
02:58:54,481 --> 02:58:57,030
it's a crazy number.
It's our life support system.

3508
02:58:57,480 --> 02:58:59,760
Proteins,
food and people will think you're just

3509
02:58:59,761 --> 02:59:00,990
going to stop that.
Listen,

3510
02:59:01,050 --> 02:59:03,030
you're going to get a lot of people that
aren't healthy.

3511
02:59:03,031 --> 02:59:06,420
This is not the way to go,
and if some people want to go vegan and

3512
02:59:06,421 --> 02:59:10,080
they can pull it off with careful
studying of their diet and making sure

3513
02:59:10,081 --> 02:59:12,210
they're supplementing with all the right
things,

3514
02:59:12,540 --> 02:59:13,373
good luck.

3515
02:59:13,500 --> 02:59:14,510
Go.
Go for it.

3516
02:59:15,310 --> 02:59:18,420
How we can initiate this conversation.
After my great hero,

3517
02:59:18,421 --> 02:59:20,070
Fred Bear,
died in 1987.

3518
02:59:20,071 --> 02:59:22,530
It was the next year I started the Ted
nugent camp for kids,

3519
02:59:22,740 --> 02:59:27,270
which was a a movement forward of what
he told me to continue promoting

3520
02:59:27,271 --> 02:59:31,250
conservation and hunting the way I was,
so I started a charity 500,

3521
02:59:31,251 --> 02:59:33,180
one c,
three church did the Ted nugent camp for

3522
02:59:33,181 --> 02:59:36,360
kids where we run in Colorado,
South Dakota,

3523
02:59:36,750 --> 02:59:38,060
Nebraska,
and Iowa.

3524
02:59:38,061 --> 02:59:42,170
Every year we graduated over 16,000 boys
and girls between the ages of seven and

3525
02:59:42,171 --> 02:59:47,171
17 from great volunteers,
men and women from every measurable walk

3526
02:59:47,581 --> 02:59:49,860
of life that I have to vet because it's
got my name on it,

3527
02:59:50,130 --> 02:59:54,420
but a great heroes of law enforcement,
military and just great families and we

3528
02:59:54,421 --> 02:59:59,421
teach them the discipline of archery,
the discipline of wildlife management

3529
02:59:59,461 --> 03:00:02,250
colluding.
If you don't fish upon the fish will,

3530
03:00:02,580 --> 03:00:07,440
if they'll overpopulate and they'll die
off that you have to harvest a surplus

3531
03:00:07,441 --> 03:00:12,090
to make room for the next productivity
and trapping the importance of trapping

3532
03:00:12,091 --> 03:00:15,960
that that's how you keep disease under
control and that's how you keep value to

3533
03:00:15,961 --> 03:00:16,800
fur bearers.

3534
03:00:16,950 --> 03:00:21,480
And that's how you make really great,
great warm clothes and at laterals and

3535
03:00:21,540 --> 03:00:26,540
fly fishing and the meticulous detail
and discipline of tying flies and being

3536
03:00:27,631 --> 03:00:30,360
clean and sober and being the best that
you can be.

3537
03:00:30,450 --> 03:00:32,940
And self sufficiency and rugged
individualism.

3538
03:00:32,941 --> 03:00:36,660
So this has been going on since 1989.
And,

3539
03:00:36,740 --> 03:00:38,900
uh,
still you haven't read a word about it.

3540
03:00:38,930 --> 03:00:41,220
New York Times.
You haven't worried about it anywhere

3541
03:00:41,280 --> 03:00:45,660
because they're too quick to condemn me
because I'm so good at promoting hunting

3542
03:00:45,661 --> 03:00:49,050
gun ownership that they.
They avoid me like the plague,

3543
03:00:49,200 --> 03:00:53,010
but the real tragedy is that outdoor
life field and stream sports,

3544
03:00:53,050 --> 03:00:57,360
field guns and Ammo,
all of these sporting publications,

3545
03:00:57,480 --> 03:01:00,160
not a word,
30 years

3546
03:01:00,160 --> 03:01:05,160
of a wonderful charity created by a
household name celebrity about the most

3547
03:01:06,101 --> 03:01:09,520
important things in life.
They just don't care.

3548
03:01:09,940 --> 03:01:13,930
It's so.
I'm mentioning it here on the Joe Rogan

3549
03:01:13,931 --> 03:01:18,931
podcast because my volunteers have been
doing God's work for all these years and

3550
03:01:19,361 --> 03:01:22,300
plus people have been very generous to
Shukar Safaris,

3551
03:01:22,510 --> 03:01:26,650
donate money every year and people just
dig deep and make donations to keep the

3552
03:01:26,651 --> 03:01:29,050
camp alive.
So if people want to find out about

3553
03:01:29,051 --> 03:01:30,310
that,
then go to my website,

3554
03:01:30,580 --> 03:01:35,440
but it's a charity for children about
being aware of resource stewardship and

3555
03:01:35,441 --> 03:01:38,530
hands on boots on the ground.
Environmentalism.

3556
03:01:38,710 --> 03:01:42,250
If you're going to cut a tree,
you might want to plant 50 simple.

3557
03:01:42,251 --> 03:01:46,120
I know you do a lot of that.
We do a lot of that tree planting and

3558
03:01:46,121 --> 03:01:47,410
you've.
You've done every year since [inaudible]

3559
03:01:47,411 --> 03:01:50,020
69.
I've got forest in Michigan.

3560
03:01:50,021 --> 03:01:53,770
I mean giant towering forest.
It's fun to kill deer on your own grads

3561
03:01:53,771 --> 03:01:54,760
fund to kill deer anywhere.

3562
03:01:55,030 --> 03:01:57,880
It's exciting and it's challenging.
It's all the good things both to me to

3563
03:01:57,881 --> 03:01:59,470
do it on your own ground that you
earned.

3564
03:01:59,471 --> 03:02:02,200
It's really special,
but when you do it on the ground that

3565
03:02:02,201 --> 03:02:05,650
you earned and you literally built the
forest,

3566
03:02:05,850 --> 03:02:07,100
it's,
it's,

3567
03:02:07,220 --> 03:02:09,820
it's spiritual.
It's almost like.

3568
03:02:09,821 --> 03:02:13,270
I love aetate when I'm in my forest.
Well,

3569
03:02:13,330 --> 03:02:15,490
I remember you had,
I don't remember who it was.

3570
03:02:15,491 --> 03:02:17,620
He had some rock and roll guy on your,
uh,

3571
03:02:17,680 --> 03:02:19,960
Sebastian Bach.
I think one time it was one of one of

3572
03:02:20,010 --> 03:02:20,751
the guys.
But you were,

3573
03:02:20,751 --> 03:02:22,600
you were talking about how someone was
saying,

3574
03:02:22,601 --> 03:02:24,820
this is amazing.
I wish I had my own thoughts.

3575
03:02:24,830 --> 03:02:25,410
Was Great.
Yeah,

3576
03:02:25,410 --> 03:02:27,730
it was that.
That was Steven Tyler and Joe

3577
03:02:29,450 --> 03:02:31,770
snored in your own forest.
I said,

3578
03:02:31,830 --> 03:02:34,700
you snorted the upper peninsula.
Who are you kidding?

3579
03:02:35,020 --> 03:02:38,890
And they did you add a mine here?
He could have bought one hell of a nice

3580
03:02:38,920 --> 03:02:39,753
ranch.

3581
03:02:40,150 --> 03:02:44,170
He would admit that the life that you
live that life,

3582
03:02:44,171 --> 03:02:45,010
uh,
having this,

3583
03:02:45,011 --> 03:02:47,950
uh,
you essentially live in an area in both

3584
03:02:47,951 --> 03:02:52,420
places when Michigan into taxes,
you hunt in your own environment,

3585
03:02:52,421 --> 03:02:56,080
you have your own hunting place,
but it's controversial.

3586
03:02:56,170 --> 03:02:57,610
And this is what's controversial about
it.

3587
03:02:57,611 --> 03:02:59,000
The fence,
well,

3588
03:02:59,001 --> 03:03:01,750
the,
the Texas property is fenced because I

3589
03:03:01,751 --> 03:03:04,960
have exotic,
so by law in why do I have it fenced

3590
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,210
whatsoever exotics,
because if it wasn't fenced with

3591
03:03:07,211 --> 03:03:10,210
exotics,
exotics would have probably been extinct

3592
03:03:10,211 --> 03:03:12,280
by now,
but land owners in Texas,

3593
03:03:12,281 --> 03:03:15,520
we took the lead from South Africa and a
lot of people don't know this Joe.

3594
03:03:15,521 --> 03:03:17,620
In fact,
I articulated in an upcoming spirit of

3595
03:03:17,621 --> 03:03:21,340
the wild show,
high fence hunting saved wildlife in

3596
03:03:21,341 --> 03:03:25,690
Africa because the,
the development of agriculture in Africa

3597
03:03:26,050 --> 03:03:29,410
was in total conflict with the migration
of wildlife.

3598
03:03:29,411 --> 03:03:33,970
We're talking all those incredible
species from Eland and Kudu and GMS,

3599
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:37,750
Bach in Yallah and willdabeast and,
and,

3600
03:03:37,751 --> 03:03:39,370
and,
and the wart hogs.

3601
03:03:39,370 --> 03:03:42,450
And in elephants,
they would migrate every year and have

3602
03:03:42,460 --> 03:03:46,060
Gulf sudden the migration came to your
citrus grove and destroyed everything.

3603
03:03:46,110 --> 03:03:49,180
You had killed all the wildlife.
Because you want to sell your citrus.

3604
03:03:49,510 --> 03:03:52,120
Well,
some of the ranchers who value the

3605
03:03:52,121 --> 03:03:55,390
wildlife more than citrus and there's
nothing wrong with citrus.

3606
03:03:55,870 --> 03:03:58,210
They literally said,
God dammit,

3607
03:03:58,211 --> 03:04:02,660
everytime I herds migrate,
only a portion of them come back because

3608
03:04:02,661 --> 03:04:05,360
they all these agric concerns are
destroying,

3609
03:04:05,960 --> 03:04:08,780
killing the wildlife to protect your
agriculture.

3610
03:04:08,930 --> 03:04:12,560
So I'm an offense my 20,000 acres and
I'm going to manage it.

3611
03:04:12,770 --> 03:04:15,230
Twenty thousand acres is huge.
Even my spirit world,

3612
03:04:15,231 --> 03:04:16,400
ranches,
300 acres,

3613
03:04:16,520 --> 03:04:21,520
it's still has a finite productivity.
Every habitat is finite and so they

3614
03:04:22,461 --> 03:04:27,260
started selling those hunts for the
surplus every year of these magnificent

3615
03:04:27,260 --> 03:04:32,030
wildlife species instead of agriculture.
So those animals are thriving and

3616
03:04:32,060 --> 03:04:36,590
absolute natural habitat as is my home,
ground spirit,

3617
03:04:36,591 --> 03:04:41,270
wild ranch in Texas,
you must harvest the surplus fence or no

3618
03:04:41,271 --> 03:04:46,160
fence and mark my words,
people who condemn and criticize high

3619
03:04:46,161 --> 03:04:47,480
fence hunting is not fair.

3620
03:04:47,480 --> 03:04:52,480
Chase are speaking out of their ass.
Ted nugent hunts more days in an average

3621
03:04:55,010 --> 03:04:57,950
year than most people will in their
lifetime.

3622
03:04:58,310 --> 03:05:02,120
I hunt hundreds of days every morning,
every afternoon.

3623
03:05:02,840 --> 03:05:07,840
The animals have to die.
I must make room for next year's

3624
03:05:08,871 --> 03:05:10,790
productivity.
In your situation,

3625
03:05:10,850 --> 03:05:13,850
in all situation,
in your situation in particular because

3626
03:05:13,851 --> 03:05:15,380
you're only on 300 acres.
That's right.

3627
03:05:15,381 --> 03:05:17,790
I have a certain amount of animals and
habitat.

3628
03:05:17,810 --> 03:05:21,620
Everybody even on outside my fence.
You still gotta kill them animals too,

3629
03:05:21,621 --> 03:05:24,620
but a lot of like purists would look at
that and go,

3630
03:05:24,650 --> 03:05:26,120
man,
is that really hunting?

3631
03:05:26,150 --> 03:05:27,350
I mean,
here's my answer.

3632
03:05:27,380 --> 03:05:28,670
Read in areas.
You're ready?

3633
03:05:28,671 --> 03:05:32,000
Yeah.
Lifetime experience hunting.

3634
03:05:32,001 --> 03:05:33,780
You know,
most difficult animals in the world.

3635
03:05:33,790 --> 03:05:35,300
The most challenging animals in the
world.

3636
03:05:35,301 --> 03:05:37,940
Pressured are my pressured animals and
spirit.

3637
03:05:37,941 --> 03:05:40,510
One ranch on my open,
1100 acres,

3638
03:05:40,511 --> 03:05:43,400
swamp and Michigan.
If I want to shoot a deer,

3639
03:05:43,550 --> 03:05:48,550
I can 90 percent plus tell you with all
my different choices of tree stands and

3640
03:05:50,091 --> 03:05:53,900
my strategies of wind and and habitat
and positioning.

3641
03:05:54,140 --> 03:05:55,190
Bader,
no bait,

3642
03:05:55,191 --> 03:05:57,420
just travel corridors.
I've been living there.

3643
03:05:57,860 --> 03:06:00,500
I've owned it since 1978.
In fact,

3644
03:06:00,501 --> 03:06:05,501
the one place I've owned since 1970 I.
I have a like a 20 times the shot

3645
03:06:08,300 --> 03:06:13,010
opportunity on my open ground than I do
on my fence ground.

3646
03:06:13,610 --> 03:06:17,580
My high fenced hunting and all the high
fenced hunting I've ever had is,

3647
03:06:17,590 --> 03:06:22,590
is absolutely pure fair chase is any
wilderness I've ever been to from the

3648
03:06:24,441 --> 03:06:27,740
Sudan to Alaska,
to Saskatchewan,

3649
03:06:27,741 --> 03:06:29,930
to Ontario,
to Montana,

3650
03:06:30,050 --> 03:06:32,300
to Wyoming,
to northern California.

3651
03:06:32,660 --> 03:06:37,660
It is hunting the role the fence plays
is zero in my killing an animal.

3652
03:06:40,490 --> 03:06:44,090
It only plays a role in keeping pressure
outside,

3653
03:06:44,180 --> 03:06:46,760
so I don't have to shoot that two or
three or four year old buck.

3654
03:06:46,880 --> 03:06:49,820
I can wait till he's five,
but I still have to kill those fidgety

3655
03:06:49,821 --> 03:06:54,821
dose and it's absolutely pure hunting.
I understand your

3656
03:06:56,010 --> 03:06:58,890
perspective.
The way the way people disagree is that

3657
03:06:58,891 --> 03:07:00,720
the idea that these animals can never
leave.

3658
03:07:00,780 --> 03:07:02,850
They're stuck.
They're stuck there so you know that

3659
03:07:02,851 --> 03:07:05,730
they're going to be there,
which is the difference between that and

3660
03:07:05,731 --> 03:07:08,870
like say you go into a back country
hunt,

3661
03:07:08,871 --> 03:07:12,620
you know you park your truck and the
trailhead and hike in twitch and tried

3662
03:07:12,621 --> 03:07:15,030
to do.
I'm sure you do these animals,

3663
03:07:15,060 --> 03:07:19,200
you have no idea if they're.
They are not white ranch.

3664
03:07:19,230 --> 03:07:21,540
You have no idea whether they're right,
but you know,

3665
03:07:21,541 --> 03:07:23,190
you don't have to have,
I'm sure you know,

3666
03:07:23,191 --> 03:07:24,550
you have a lot of them,
right.

3667
03:07:24,570 --> 03:07:26,610
It's just,
it's a different thing to be both,

3668
03:07:26,790 --> 03:07:28,890
but then again,
it's like do people have a problem

3669
03:07:28,920 --> 03:07:33,920
fishing in a stock pond or in a pond?
It's not stocked but managed on my

3670
03:07:33,961 --> 03:07:38,130
property so that I fish it adequately
enough so that the basket to be six,

3671
03:07:38,131 --> 03:07:41,010
seven and eight pounds,
but I don't let them get stunted.

3672
03:07:41,400 --> 03:07:43,380
Same thing.
Those fishing going anywhere and quite

3673
03:07:43,381 --> 03:07:48,150
honestly in those suburban areas and
urban areas and even farming across

3674
03:07:48,151 --> 03:07:51,120
America.
Those deer are there.

3675
03:07:51,180 --> 03:07:54,540
Yeah,
they are there and I have no better

3676
03:07:54,541 --> 03:07:58,740
chance of shooting deer and spirit wild
ranch and the high fence than I do

3677
03:07:58,741 --> 03:08:03,741
hunting the suburbs of Columbus,
Ohio where those deer can go everywhere

3678
03:08:03,781 --> 03:08:06,840
except that there is a highway right
there and there's a hospital over there

3679
03:08:06,950 --> 03:08:10,230
and there's a school over there and
there's a neighborhood over there and

3680
03:08:10,231 --> 03:08:14,970
there was a factory over here.
So every habitat has its limitations.

3681
03:08:15,920 --> 03:08:17,640
Yeah.
I had a conversation with someone about,

3682
03:08:17,641 --> 03:08:19,200
um,
access deer and Lanai.

3683
03:08:19,230 --> 03:08:20,880
We just got back from Lanai.
Awesome.

3684
03:08:21,410 --> 03:08:23,840
Populated there.
It's crazy overpopulated.

3685
03:08:23,850 --> 03:08:28,560
So I said there's two irresponsible,
20,000 axis deer and 3000 people on this

3686
03:08:28,561 --> 03:08:30,060
island.
And so someone says to me,

3687
03:08:30,300 --> 03:08:31,710
what's the challenge in that?

3688
03:08:31,710 --> 03:08:32,460
I'm like,
Oh,

3689
03:08:32,460 --> 03:08:34,860
Christ,
you never seen an axis so uppity.

3690
03:08:34,950 --> 03:08:39,950
They are white,
are the most weird species this side of

3691
03:08:41,220 --> 03:08:45,090
bungle and uh,
I'm going to say mature,

3692
03:08:45,091 --> 03:08:46,350
Kudu,
these guys,

3693
03:08:46,530 --> 03:08:51,060
Tango Bango is a huge antelope.
It's actually orange with black and

3694
03:08:51,061 --> 03:08:55,350
white stripes from the Central African
Republic and Cameroon.

3695
03:08:55,351 --> 03:08:57,640
And so they evolved to get away from
lions,

3696
03:08:57,660 --> 03:09:00,330
whereas the axis deer evolved to get
away from tigers.

3697
03:09:00,360 --> 03:09:01,193
Yup.
Yeah.

3698
03:09:01,210 --> 03:09:03,720
Just anything that lives around cats
like mule deer,

3699
03:09:03,721 --> 03:09:06,200
high country,
we're just switched on or looking for

3700
03:09:06,900 --> 03:09:11,520
Michigan deer because there's so many
hundreds of either pressure from the

3701
03:09:11,521 --> 03:09:13,500
time they're with.
That's the thing about your place in

3702
03:09:13,501 --> 03:09:14,790
Michigan.
In Michigan,

3703
03:09:14,791 --> 03:09:17,790
it's very hard to find a large,
mature deer,

3704
03:09:17,970 --> 03:09:19,830
not on our property because what I'm
saying,

3705
03:09:19,831 --> 03:09:23,040
we stopped shooting young ones and all
the neighbors agree just like they did

3706
03:09:23,041 --> 03:09:24,640
in Buffalo County,
Wisconsin,

3707
03:09:24,810 --> 03:09:29,250
which is all just decisions by
contiguous land owners to not shoot

3708
03:09:29,251 --> 03:09:32,680
young bucks because somebody shot a $200
and then when we get that,

3709
03:09:32,700 --> 03:09:35,400
I went on my farm so they knew they were
there.

3710
03:09:35,401 --> 03:09:39,540
That's why I was so popular because deer
hunting was not popular in guys were

3711
03:09:39,541 --> 03:09:43,560
shooting six and seven year old mammoths
and so the hundreds that started deer

3712
03:09:43,561 --> 03:09:45,720
hunting went well.
I'm not shooting at two year old,

3713
03:09:45,721 --> 03:09:48,690
you know,
bulger buck because joe down the road

3714
03:09:48,691 --> 03:09:50,790
got a,
got a massive stag.

3715
03:09:50,791 --> 03:09:54,220
I'm going to wait for one of them and by
waiting them they do

3716
03:09:54,220 --> 03:09:58,480
get older and they do have that
mysticism of stagnant,

3717
03:09:58,481 --> 03:10:01,750
which is better for the population
because of the bad guy gets to breed

3718
03:10:02,260 --> 03:10:05,530
geared and spread those good genetics.
Talk about that to let people go.

3719
03:10:05,531 --> 03:10:07,600
Trophy hunting takes out the best jeans.
Yeah,

3720
03:10:07,840 --> 03:10:09,700
no,
it does not understand.

3721
03:10:09,701 --> 03:10:12,640
We keep.
We keep setting records for deer and

3722
03:10:12,641 --> 03:10:17,260
Moose and elk and Caribou and bear and
mountain lion and antelope every year.

3723
03:10:17,320 --> 03:10:22,320
We set world records constantly because
our hunting system of being disciplined

3724
03:10:22,751 --> 03:10:25,630
and waiting for that mature animal are
hunting system,

3725
03:10:25,631 --> 03:10:30,631
has produced the healthiest most
monstrosity specimens in the history of

3726
03:10:31,031 --> 03:10:35,920
record keeping every year,
so we're not hurting anything by being

3727
03:10:35,921 --> 03:10:39,430
disciplined and patient,
which I've learned over the years and my

3728
03:10:39,431 --> 03:10:43,300
son is very adamant about in so many
hunters are.

3729
03:10:43,480 --> 03:10:46,570
There's A.
There's a mysticism to that mature stag.

3730
03:10:47,470 --> 03:10:52,180
The breeders of our ancestors were the
best hunters and they did the breeding

3731
03:10:52,181 --> 03:10:57,181
because they were more resourceful and
more intelligently connected to the

3732
03:10:57,431 --> 03:11:00,220
system by which we fed the tribe.
So those,

3733
03:11:00,430 --> 03:11:03,640
those killer stag hunters were always
the leader of,

3734
03:11:03,820 --> 03:11:05,470
of uh,
of tribes.

3735
03:11:05,471 --> 03:11:10,471
And in it's still that way today I'd
like to think and also this pursuit of

3736
03:11:11,170 --> 03:11:14,050
bowhunting,
which is more difficult and more

3737
03:11:14,051 --> 03:11:18,730
rewarding because it's more difficult,
is many levels more difficult when

3738
03:11:18,731 --> 03:11:22,240
you're chasing after a 200 inch box.
Because this is a six,

3739
03:11:22,241 --> 03:11:26,530
seven year old animal that's been
avoiding mountain lions and bears and

3740
03:11:26,531 --> 03:11:29,680
whatever else is trying to eat it for
years and years,

3741
03:11:29,681 --> 03:11:32,620
this thing is switched on.
They take very clever paths.

3742
03:11:32,621 --> 03:11:37,270
They let the dose and the Fonz Wander on
first and they laid back and typically

3743
03:11:37,271 --> 03:11:37,990
come out around,

3744
03:11:37,990 --> 03:11:40,960
turn to come out about midnight and go
back to bed around one.

3745
03:11:41,380 --> 03:11:46,380
Now there is a variance there in south
Texas where a age management was created

3746
03:11:48,220 --> 03:11:52,060
because they they supplement and they
got a center pivot agriculture down in

3747
03:11:52,061 --> 03:11:55,930
the deserts of south Texas and that
genetic is a very fortified genetic.

3748
03:11:55,931 --> 03:11:58,330
Anyhow,
200 pound deer are not that rare.

3749
03:11:58,710 --> 03:12:00,790
A lot of people think all deer in Texas
are little,

3750
03:12:00,791 --> 03:12:03,280
but they're not,
and if you let them grow,

3751
03:12:03,310 --> 03:12:08,310
which texts is pretty much pioneered.
Those bucks in south Texas are the

3752
03:12:11,020 --> 03:12:15,370
easiest deer on the planet to kill and
there's a couple of dynamics.

3753
03:12:15,520 --> 03:12:20,440
There's just some strange genetic
lineage there that they're a calmer

3754
03:12:20,441 --> 03:12:23,080
animal.
Plus they're on wide open,

3755
03:12:23,350 --> 03:12:27,310
vast private ground,
which means they don't get the public

3756
03:12:27,311 --> 03:12:32,140
hordes of pressure and once that book is
a button buck the first year,

3757
03:12:32,260 --> 03:12:34,840
nobody shoots at him,
so he encounters.

3758
03:12:34,841 --> 03:12:36,670
He smells that person,
he sees that person,

3759
03:12:36,790 --> 03:12:38,500
he hears that person.
No problem.

3760
03:12:38,650 --> 03:12:40,120
Second year,
a little booger.

3761
03:12:40,121 --> 03:12:42,150
Buck,
you ran into people.

3762
03:12:42,870 --> 03:12:44,280
Nobody.
Nobody messed with him.

3763
03:12:44,610 --> 03:12:48,750
Third Year she's got a nice little rack.
You still run into people.

3764
03:12:49,540 --> 03:12:52,190
No problem.
There's some corn is where the

3765
03:12:52,250 --> 03:12:54,380
wheat field is the.
I smelled that guy,

3766
03:12:54,381 --> 03:12:55,520
but male,
three years,

3767
03:12:55,521 --> 03:12:57,440
he's never bothered me.
I'll just keep you in fourth year,

3768
03:12:57,441 --> 03:13:01,490
same thing.
So they reduce their fear factor of the

3769
03:13:01,491 --> 03:13:04,880
encounter with humans because nobody
shot at them because they're not going

3770
03:13:04,881 --> 03:13:06,830
to shoot him.
There is that natural,

3771
03:13:07,640 --> 03:13:09,700
but probably isn't with nappy
considered.

3772
03:13:09,701 --> 03:13:12,200
Like that's weird.
It's almost like this is a pet or a

3773
03:13:12,240 --> 03:13:14,040
farmer about that.
I mean,

3774
03:13:14,041 --> 03:13:16,670
I'm just a relaxed animal that he's not
pressured,

3775
03:13:16,850 --> 03:13:19,580
which not just relaxed but accustomed to
humans.

3776
03:13:19,581 --> 03:13:21,140
Yes.
But they're still elusive.

3777
03:13:21,141 --> 03:13:22,740
You're not going to walk up to them and
club.

3778
03:13:22,830 --> 03:13:24,020
Um,
though,

3779
03:13:24,021 --> 03:13:28,340
there are some places down there where
they get so relaxed that they do hand

3780
03:13:28,341 --> 03:13:31,430
feed some of the dose.
They get so relaxed.

3781
03:13:31,460 --> 03:13:33,000
That seems so strange to me.
Well,

3782
03:13:33,150 --> 03:13:36,910
but everybody's got their own little
preference and I,

3783
03:13:36,950 --> 03:13:39,230
I've never thought of wildlife as pets.

3784
03:13:39,230 --> 03:13:42,380
I just wouldn't own a deer as a pet.
I would.

3785
03:13:42,770 --> 03:13:46,220
You're asking for trouble and it's not
natural,

3786
03:13:46,400 --> 03:13:48,090
but if that's what you like,
um,

3787
03:13:48,350 --> 03:13:49,730
have a nice day.
Well,

3788
03:13:49,731 --> 03:13:51,080
you know,
those farms,

3789
03:13:51,280 --> 03:13:52,820
uh,
the deer farms,

3790
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:57,950
that's one of the primary ideas of the
source of CBC Cwd,

3791
03:13:57,951 --> 03:13:58,784
right?
No,

3792
03:13:58,790 --> 03:14:03,440
they think that a lot of it comes from
deere phones came from Colorado

3793
03:14:03,440 --> 03:14:03,981
Department of Wildlife.
What do you mean?

3794
03:14:03,981 --> 03:14:05,080
Nineteen,
67.

3795
03:14:05,081 --> 03:14:08,330
They injected scrapers,
which is the sheep version of the

3796
03:14:09,120 --> 03:14:11,990
sponge.
A forum and stuff elect me into the mule

3797
03:14:11,991 --> 03:14:14,870
deer in 1967 and they got out.
That's where it started.

3798
03:14:14,880 --> 03:14:18,180
Why did they inject?
I can not imagine bureaucrats be an

3799
03:14:18,181 --> 03:14:19,100
Asshole,
I suspect.

3800
03:14:19,460 --> 03:14:22,170
And so that is some sort of experiment.
I don't know the,

3801
03:14:22,320 --> 03:14:24,860
you know,
the sheep were more popular in America

3802
03:14:24,861 --> 03:14:27,290
than cattle.
There were way more sheep and cattle

3803
03:14:27,410 --> 03:14:28,970
until scrape.
These came in,

3804
03:14:28,971 --> 03:14:32,060
which is that that cwd version for
sheep,

3805
03:14:32,090 --> 03:14:35,720
mad cow and bovines and Crutchfield,
Jacob and humans,

3806
03:14:36,080 --> 03:14:37,040
and of course,
crutchfield.

3807
03:14:37,040 --> 03:14:40,700
Jacob was a result to scientists
determined by the scientists,

3808
03:14:40,701 --> 03:14:43,760
crutchfield end Jacob,
that the Indonesians,

3809
03:14:44,090 --> 03:14:47,150
people that got this,
the sponge of forum,

3810
03:14:47,260 --> 03:14:52,260
a condition from a prion because they
ate the brains of their conquered

3811
03:14:52,821 --> 03:14:54,920
enemies.
Never a good idea.

3812
03:14:55,700 --> 03:14:58,190
So,
so I'm aware of all this stuff,

3813
03:14:58,310 --> 03:15:03,020
but believe me when I tell you live on
the Joe Rogan podcast,

3814
03:15:03,590 --> 03:15:08,590
the cwd hysteria is a scam.
More deer are killed in Michigan every

3815
03:15:11,870 --> 03:15:16,870
year by feral dogs.
Then all the deer ever worldwide by cwd.

3816
03:15:18,980 --> 03:15:22,100
I think the concern though with cwd is
that it's spreading.

3817
03:15:22,400 --> 03:15:25,910
It's not my friend Doug,
his farm in Wisconsin,

3818
03:15:25,911 --> 03:15:30,320
they're just starting to test positive
for cwd know why?

3819
03:15:30,610 --> 03:15:32,000
Because they're looking for it.
Well,

3820
03:15:32,001 --> 03:15:34,070
it's not just that they were looking for
it before,

3821
03:15:34,071 --> 03:15:38,090
but they think that it's come from
animals that get out of these high fence

3822
03:15:38,091 --> 03:15:42,190
farm operations where they all feed from
the same trough and they they,

3823
03:15:42,240 --> 03:15:45,740
they spread this from there.
I think there's no evidence to support

3824
03:15:45,741 --> 03:15:48,980
that.
Dr James Crow just testified with me in

3825
03:15:48,990 --> 03:15:50,990
front of the Michigan Natural Resource
Commission

3826
03:15:50,990 --> 03:15:55,440
and Department of Natural Resources and
all the exhaustive studies have

3827
03:15:55,441 --> 03:16:00,441
concluded that cwd cannot be cross
species.

3828
03:16:01,950 --> 03:16:03,930
You can't get by eating.
Person.

3829
03:16:04,440 --> 03:16:07,980
Person can't get it.
They they had on macaque monkeys get up,

3830
03:16:07,981 --> 03:16:11,890
but that's because the injected massive
quantities into the brain of a cop

3831
03:16:11,910 --> 03:16:14,040
monkey.
Otherwise they couldn't get in.

3832
03:16:14,550 --> 03:16:19,550
But cwd Wisconsin spent $70,000,000.
I'm not making that number up.

3833
03:16:21,360 --> 03:16:23,820
Wisconsin spent $70,
million dollars,

3834
03:16:24,120 --> 03:16:28,170
tried to eradicate certain hers,
which is a virtual impossibility by the

3835
03:16:28,171 --> 03:16:29,790
way,
and even if you were successful,

3836
03:16:30,110 --> 03:16:32,880
the the mutated prion,
they,

3837
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:38,000
they stay in the ground typically
through urine and there isn't a part of

3838
03:16:38,320 --> 03:16:42,510
plants as well.
There was no evidence whatsoever that

3839
03:16:42,511 --> 03:16:47,511
cwd is ever compromised.
A servant heard it.

3840
03:16:47,790 --> 03:16:50,630
There's been no reduce seasons even in
the epicenter,

3841
03:16:50,760 --> 03:16:53,940
the endemic areas of Colorado,
Wyoming where it started,

3842
03:16:53,941 --> 03:16:57,000
where it's the most prevalent.
No seasons have been reduced,

3843
03:16:57,270 --> 03:17:00,930
no reduced tags,
no reduced in harvest.

3844
03:17:01,830 --> 03:17:06,830
It's in consequential.
It occurs so rarely.

3845
03:17:07,830 --> 03:17:12,830
They've studied the deer for 18 years in
Wisconsin and deer that had cwd 18 years

3846
03:17:14,161 --> 03:17:17,670
collared and monitored.
Still having funds,

3847
03:17:18,180 --> 03:17:22,170
they say it's always fatal.
It is not always fatal.

3848
03:17:22,320 --> 03:17:25,920
Go to the doctor,
dear a slash facebook.

3849
03:17:25,921 --> 03:17:28,860
Either Dr Dr. Com slash facebook or
failure.

3850
03:17:28,890 --> 03:17:33,060
You're not worried about it at all.
Not worried about bureaucrats that have

3851
03:17:33,061 --> 03:17:38,061
scared away hunters in Wisconsin and
caused butchers to quit processing deer

3852
03:17:38,551 --> 03:17:43,551
because of the manufactured hysteria.
CWD is not a concern.

3853
03:17:44,310 --> 03:17:48,680
Buicks kill more deer than cwd it,
it,

3854
03:17:48,770 --> 03:17:51,200
it.
The bureaucrats go in and slaughtered

3855
03:17:51,201 --> 03:17:54,120
dear by the thousands.
So if cwd is killed,

3856
03:17:54,121 --> 03:17:56,730
58 deer in Michigan,
which has,

3857
03:17:57,240 --> 03:17:58,890
they found,
um,

3858
03:17:59,010 --> 03:18:02,280
I don't think any of them were fatal.
I think they had to kill him though they

3859
03:18:02,281 --> 03:18:04,200
did find one in Jackson County.
They claim,

3860
03:18:04,201 --> 03:18:06,110
I don't believe,
I just don't believe bureaucrats.

3861
03:18:06,300 --> 03:18:07,590
Remember,
these are the bureaucrats.

3862
03:18:07,591 --> 03:18:12,591
Joel in Michigan that claimed that there
were quote 5,000 to 7,000 Russian boar

3863
03:18:13,561 --> 03:18:16,380
running wild and Michigan.
Can we analyze that,

3864
03:18:16,381 --> 03:18:19,470
analyze that claim for a moment?
Maybe you can tell me Joe,

3865
03:18:19,590 --> 03:18:23,460
what the fuck is a Russian boy?
I'll tell you what a Russian boar is.

3866
03:18:23,550 --> 03:18:28,320
It's a male pig in Russia.
There is no such genius as a Russian

3867
03:18:28,321 --> 03:18:31,260
boar.
It's all wives tale bullshit.

3868
03:18:31,560 --> 03:18:34,800
That was the official statement by a
game agency in Michigan.

3869
03:18:34,801 --> 03:18:37,560
Lions,
sons of bitches and then they claim,

3870
03:18:37,620 --> 03:18:41,160
and here's another one.
So isn't it our moral and spiritual

3871
03:18:41,161 --> 03:18:44,940
obligation to wisely use the animals we
harvest,

3872
03:18:44,970 --> 03:18:46,380
isn't it?
Yes.

3873
03:18:47,320 --> 03:18:49,930
In Michigan,
the farmers can slaughter sandhill

3874
03:18:49,931 --> 03:18:51,910
cranes,
which are known as rib eye in the sky,

3875
03:18:51,911 --> 03:18:53,380
right?
It's supposed to be delicious.

3876
03:18:53,830 --> 03:18:58,240
It is farmers and Michigan's can can
shoot sandhill cranes,

3877
03:18:58,241 --> 03:19:01,720
but by law are not allowed to eat them.

3878
03:19:01,870 --> 03:19:04,510
What is this a game department you can
trust?

3879
03:19:04,511 --> 03:19:05,440
Wait a minute,
don't.

3880
03:19:05,441 --> 03:19:06,570
I will not.
Wait a minute.

3881
03:19:06,730 --> 03:19:09,480
You heard me right?
You're not allowed to eat sand.

3882
03:19:09,940 --> 03:19:14,530
This game department is going to try to
tell me about wildlife management when

3883
03:19:14,531 --> 03:19:17,590
they claimed there were 6,000 or 70,000
Russian born.

3884
03:19:17,591 --> 03:19:20,200
By the way,
let's say there were 6,000,

3885
03:19:20,201 --> 03:19:24,070
5,000 to 7,000 wild pigs and Michigan
back when they claimed it in the

3886
03:19:24,071 --> 03:19:26,050
nineties.
You know how many that would be today?

3887
03:19:26,380 --> 03:19:29,650
Show me some game cameras.
800,000 deer hunters in Michigan.

3888
03:19:29,710 --> 03:19:30,350
What are there?
10,

3889
03:19:30,350 --> 03:19:33,520
20,000 game cameras.
It's a lie.

3890
03:19:33,730 --> 03:19:37,930
Cwd is ally cwd as killed 58 deer in
Michigan,

3891
03:19:37,931 --> 03:19:42,931
so they claim the dnr has authorized the
slaughter of tens of thousands.

3892
03:19:43,690 --> 03:19:46,960
Who's the enemy of the deer hunter?
The bureaucrats are.

3893
03:19:47,350 --> 03:19:51,100
I'm telling you in Michigan they have
lost their souls.

3894
03:19:51,520 --> 03:19:54,430
It's a heartbreaker.
I can't understand the rationale for not

3895
03:19:54,431 --> 03:19:55,270
eating sandhill cranes.

3896
03:19:55,270 --> 03:19:56,230
There is none.
What w?

3897
03:19:56,250 --> 03:19:57,580
What are they saying?
When you shoot them,

3898
03:19:57,581 --> 03:19:59,980
you have to just let them rot bay.
You have to bury.

3899
03:20:00,030 --> 03:20:02,950
So we're shooting them as a nuisance
animals that the idea,

3900
03:20:02,980 --> 03:20:05,320
even if even if that's.
That's the idea,

3901
03:20:05,440 --> 03:20:06,740
but here's the.
Here's the truth,

3902
03:20:06,741 --> 03:20:09,910
here's the guitar tags.
The guitar player will help.

3903
03:20:09,911 --> 03:20:12,310
Okay.
If there's enough sand,

3904
03:20:12,311 --> 03:20:16,270
no cranes for farmers to shoot open the
season,

3905
03:20:16,450 --> 03:20:21,220
sell licenses,
create a management plan and show some

3906
03:20:21,221 --> 03:20:25,600
decency and respect and let us eat the
rib eye in the sky.

3907
03:20:25,810 --> 03:20:29,080
You stupid bastards.
Yeah,

3908
03:20:29,081 --> 03:20:30,010
that makes sense.
Now,

3909
03:20:30,011 --> 03:20:31,600
see,
I'm confrontational now,

3910
03:20:31,630 --> 03:20:34,080
but because I've been confronted with an
offensive,

3911
03:20:34,780 --> 03:20:39,780
a criminal law that forbids us to
utilize God's precious protein.

3912
03:20:41,160 --> 03:20:45,550
This is bizarre world that doesn't make
any sense.

3913
03:20:45,551 --> 03:20:48,970
It doesn't make any sense that the
morning who the picture of the dove on

3914
03:20:48,971 --> 03:20:52,900
millions of boxes of Ammo in Michigan,
there's a picture of a dove and it says

3915
03:20:52,901 --> 03:20:54,910
game load,
but the Michigan Dnr will say,

3916
03:20:54,911 --> 03:20:55,451
oh no,
no,

3917
03:20:55,451 --> 03:20:58,300
no,
that's a song bird.

3918
03:20:58,750 --> 03:21:03,000
You can't shoot them and eat them.
It's it's planet of the apes and it's

3919
03:21:03,050 --> 03:21:06,970
Cooper's people that don't have any
background whatsoever in wildlife for

3920
03:21:06,971 --> 03:21:10,330
hunting as well,
but that they're trained biologists.

3921
03:21:10,340 --> 03:21:11,200
That's different.
Right,

3922
03:21:11,620 --> 03:21:14,680
and they're influenced by politicians
and bureaucrats.

3923
03:21:14,681 --> 03:21:17,260
They're liars.
That question to wild boar,

3924
03:21:17,261 --> 03:21:20,080
like whenever I go to a restaurant it
says like wild boar sausage,

3925
03:21:20,130 --> 03:21:21,260
like how do you know it was a male?

3926
03:21:23,610 --> 03:21:26,440
Why are you calling it a boar wild pig?
It's.

3927
03:21:26,570 --> 03:21:30,460
It's a sound sexy Russian bores.
We have 8,000 Russian boards.

3928
03:21:30,461 --> 03:21:31,294
What are they,
gang?

3929
03:21:31,490 --> 03:21:33,010
They're out there in the woods.
Band each other.

3930
03:21:33,160 --> 03:21:35,380
Thank God.
Thank God they're all males there.

3931
03:21:35,381 --> 03:21:38,110
Maybe that's what happened.
Maybe they did have 8,000 boys and

3932
03:21:38,111 --> 03:21:39,790
they're all going,
where's the fucking check?

3933
03:21:39,791 --> 03:21:44,290
But how can the game department use that
kind of terminology?

3934
03:21:44,320 --> 03:21:45,890
Yeah,
it's a real problem with a straight

3935
03:21:45,891 --> 03:21:46,580
face.

3936
03:21:46,580 --> 03:21:47,840
It's a real problem.
Then when they,

3937
03:21:47,870 --> 03:21:50,660
when they speak about it that way,
you immediately dismiss what they're

3938
03:21:50,661 --> 03:21:51,860
saying because you're.
You're not.

3939
03:21:52,100 --> 03:21:55,430
They're not being accurate and not being
accurate with describing what the animal

3940
03:21:55,431 --> 03:21:58,430
is and you're inclined to dismiss
anything,

3941
03:21:58,490 --> 03:22:02,630
so you're only allowed to shoot those
sandhill cranes as a nuisance animal.

3942
03:22:02,631 --> 03:22:05,450
You can't shoot them and eat them.
It's unbelievable.

3943
03:22:05,480 --> 03:22:06,520
That's crazy.
And there,

3944
03:22:06,521 --> 03:22:07,790
by the way,
they're everywhere.

3945
03:22:07,791 --> 03:22:10,710
There's plenty of sandhill cranes in
Michigan to open the season in.

3946
03:22:10,711 --> 03:22:13,130
A lot of people go.
Have you ever talked to senators and

3947
03:22:13,131 --> 03:22:13,881
congressmen?
They go,

3948
03:22:13,881 --> 03:22:14,510
well,
you can't.

3949
03:22:14,510 --> 03:22:16,170
You can't shoot sandhill cranes.
I went,

3950
03:22:16,171 --> 03:22:18,230
it's a game bird.
He had dirt bag.

3951
03:22:18,240 --> 03:22:21,920
You need to cook it for him.
I watched the episode of Rinella show

3952
03:22:21,921 --> 03:22:22,850
and they were cooking.
I was like,

3953
03:22:22,851 --> 03:22:26,150
that looks like a steak.
It's time read animal.

3954
03:22:26,220 --> 03:22:27,470
Yes.
Red Meat.

3955
03:22:27,880 --> 03:22:30,410
You know,
it's just tragic in California.

3956
03:22:30,411 --> 03:22:31,800
Can Eat mountain lions.
You got to bury him.

3957
03:22:32,330 --> 03:22:35,630
He told me he didn't eat them.
If you shot one with the depredation

3958
03:22:35,631 --> 03:22:37,340
permit and the.
That's right.

3959
03:22:37,460 --> 03:22:38,930
Wow,
that's.

3960
03:22:39,000 --> 03:22:44,000
That's indecent in the animal.
That's why I'm confrontational.

3961
03:22:44,780 --> 03:22:49,780
I'm confronting indecency and trying to
get some honesty involved and you can't

3962
03:22:50,361 --> 03:22:54,980
do it by backing off and being Mitt
Romney like and bring a doily to a

3963
03:22:54,981 --> 03:22:55,814
grenade.
Fight.

3964
03:22:56,330 --> 03:22:57,980
Doily.
I like to bring an eight,

3965
03:22:57,981 --> 03:23:01,190
10 wart hog to a poker game.
Ted,

3966
03:23:01,580 --> 03:23:04,070
we just did three hours in like 15
minutes,

3967
03:23:04,140 --> 03:23:05,360
but I,
I'd even warmed up.

3968
03:23:05,420 --> 03:23:09,980
Just flew by right at this time.
Just flew by because it's a love fest of

3969
03:23:09,981 --> 03:23:11,660
truth,
logic and common sense.

3970
03:23:12,230 --> 03:23:15,170
Well listen,
man has been a pleasure to meet.

3971
03:23:15,180 --> 03:23:19,340
You should be able to sit down with you
again and have a good conversation here.

3972
03:23:19,370 --> 03:23:22,730
My friends were right.
You do deserve me and I think it's,

3973
03:23:22,880 --> 03:23:26,570
I think it's a good opportunity for
people to get a chance to see you in a

3974
03:23:26,571 --> 03:23:29,960
long form conversation rather than these
soundbites they could just choose to

3975
03:23:29,961 --> 03:23:31,880
hate,
especially when they sound bites her

3976
03:23:31,881 --> 03:23:35,180
edited and a manufacturer has it.
Let's make it perfectly clear.

3977
03:23:35,240 --> 03:23:37,970
I did not avoid the draft.
I did nothing.

3978
03:23:38,330 --> 03:23:39,290
Oh,
let's go to that.

3979
03:23:39,291 --> 03:23:43,670
I am raising real quick.
So that was an old school story of an

3980
03:23:43,671 --> 03:23:47,120
interview supposedly that you should all
over yourself and hype type.

3981
03:23:47,570 --> 03:23:48,403
By the way,
Joe,

3982
03:23:48,460 --> 03:23:51,200
you know me pretty well in the last
three hours.

3983
03:23:51,380 --> 03:23:54,320
If I had shit on myself to get out of
the draft,

3984
03:23:54,340 --> 03:23:56,390
do you think for a minute?
I would deny it.

3985
03:23:56,630 --> 03:23:59,990
No,
it was the stories out about.

3986
03:24:00,260 --> 03:24:03,380
I went in and got my draft physical and
by the way,

3987
03:24:03,381 --> 03:24:05,990
when I win in 1969,
I was superman.

3988
03:24:05,990 --> 03:24:08,660
I literally would hurdle Volkswagen
bugs.

3989
03:24:08,750 --> 03:24:12,440
I was all muscle and sinew.
I could.

3990
03:24:12,620 --> 03:24:15,530
I was superman.
I was the most athletic running,

3991
03:24:15,531 --> 03:24:18,890
jumping,
gazelle known demand,

3992
03:24:19,250 --> 03:24:21,560
and I went in for my.
I didn't know anything about Vietnam.

3993
03:24:21,561 --> 03:24:23,840
I didn't know anything about war.
My Dad was a war hero,

3994
03:24:23,841 --> 03:24:27,020
but nobody talked about it.
I never heard of the Bataan death march.

3995
03:24:27,021 --> 03:24:29,120
I graduated from the American education
system,

3996
03:24:29,210 --> 03:24:32,840
so I knew nothing and there was all
protests around me,

3997
03:24:32,841 --> 03:24:36,530
but I wasn't really tuned into the
protests because I was making music

3998
03:24:36,531 --> 03:24:39,050
every day.
I mean just obsessed with the amboy

3999
03:24:39,051 --> 03:24:42,260
dukes and playing gigs every day.
And I didn't pay attention.

4000
03:24:42,261 --> 03:24:44,100
I never watched a in my life,
but

4001
03:24:44,100 --> 03:24:45,990
I was given a draft notice and I went
down,

4002
03:24:45,991 --> 03:24:48,450
I went down,
I had my draft physical and I passed

4003
03:24:48,451 --> 03:24:52,270
with flying cover colors and I got a
draft card in the mail a couple of

4004
03:24:52,280 --> 03:24:53,300
months later,
uh,

4005
03:24:53,430 --> 03:24:55,170
through my mom and dad's house.
And one,

4006
03:24:55,190 --> 03:24:59,700
why not a deferment?
It's a designation.

4007
03:24:59,910 --> 03:25:03,030
I was in Oakland Community College at
the time,

4008
03:25:03,210 --> 03:25:06,900
so it was,
why was a student a designation?

4009
03:25:06,901 --> 03:25:08,580
I believe,
but I was ready to rock.

4010
03:25:08,940 --> 03:25:09,930
Um,
I didn't want to go.

4011
03:25:09,931 --> 03:25:12,100
I didn't understand me,
but my buddies were going,

4012
03:25:12,210 --> 03:25:12,990
uh,
uh,

4013
03:25:12,990 --> 03:25:15,360
John Break,
my singer had to go,

4014
03:25:15,870 --> 03:25:19,230
uh,
Rob Leonard from Amboy.

4015
03:25:19,231 --> 03:25:20,940
Dukes had to go,
uh,

4016
03:25:21,010 --> 03:25:23,490
so the only way you could have gone as
if you dropped out of school,

4017
03:25:23,491 --> 03:25:24,560
is that what it is?
No,

4018
03:25:25,020 --> 03:25:26,250
it wasn't a deferment.
No,

4019
03:25:26,251 --> 03:25:26,750
I wouldn't,
I,

4020
03:25:26,750 --> 03:25:30,420
I would have been called anytime.
So you could have been called or just

4021
03:25:30,421 --> 03:25:30,720
weren't.

4022
03:25:30,720 --> 03:25:33,030
Sure.
And then the wikipedia claims,

4023
03:25:33,031 --> 03:25:36,550
I got a four,
f four f what is a four f four F emmys.

4024
03:25:36,610 --> 03:25:40,410
You're physically incapable.
I've never been physically incapable of

4025
03:25:40,411 --> 03:25:43,190
anything so they make this shit up.
So.

4026
03:25:43,191 --> 03:25:46,200
So I did an interview with high times,
which by the way,

4027
03:25:46,201 --> 03:25:48,510
let's make it clear.
I've done this so many times that people

4028
03:25:48,600 --> 03:25:52,560
ignore my actual statements.
So I had been doing interviews all

4029
03:25:52,580 --> 03:25:56,190
because the employee dukes were on fire
and I was just an outrage on stage with

4030
03:25:56,191 --> 03:26:00,060
the loin cloth and the bone Arrow and
feedback and he's killer songs and the

4031
03:26:00,061 --> 03:26:02,550
band was so good.
Greatest musicians in the world.

4032
03:26:02,700 --> 03:26:06,450
So I did interviews all the time talking
about the music I loved and they never

4033
03:26:06,451 --> 03:26:10,560
got anything right.
These stone dirt bag hippie writers get

4034
03:26:10,561 --> 03:26:14,250
the gas guys in the band's names wrong.
They got the facility wrong,

4035
03:26:14,490 --> 03:26:19,290
they mentioned songs we didn't perform,
they got nothing right.

4036
03:26:19,290 --> 03:26:21,150
And every time I'd read the interview,
God,

4037
03:26:21,151 --> 03:26:24,990
we're talking about my music.
You didn't even get the song titles

4038
03:26:24,991 --> 03:26:27,210
right.
So I started having fun with these

4039
03:26:27,230 --> 03:26:29,310
interviewers,
much to the entertainment of my band

4040
03:26:29,311 --> 03:26:33,880
mates who would break out in hysterics
when I'd make up stories because I'm not

4041
03:26:33,881 --> 03:26:35,460
going to even try to be accurate
anymore.

4042
03:26:35,580 --> 03:26:40,080
It was an ongoing maneuver of mine.
We'd have these hippie writers come in

4043
03:26:40,081 --> 03:26:42,150
to take notes and I'd say,
yeah,

4044
03:26:42,151 --> 03:26:45,810
I played his fender stratocaster as I
hold up my Gibson bird land,

4045
03:26:45,811 --> 03:26:47,870
which was known for.
And they'd write down,

4046
03:26:47,880 --> 03:26:52,880
he played in a Gibson a stratocaster.
There's no such thing as a guest.

4047
03:26:53,910 --> 03:26:57,510
So I was having fun with dirt bag anti
journalists.

4048
03:26:57,570 --> 03:27:01,830
So now I'm invited to high times
magazine and I was hardcore anti-drug.

4049
03:27:02,400 --> 03:27:04,530
So I go in and this guy is.
And

4050
03:27:08,100 --> 03:27:08,933
so,
uh,

4051
03:27:10,190 --> 03:27:11,960
so uh,
tell me about,

4052
03:27:11,961 --> 03:27:14,090
uh,
this I am boy,

4053
03:27:14,120 --> 03:27:14,950
do.

4054
03:27:14,950 --> 03:27:17,220
What?
Is it like a band?

4055
03:27:17,400 --> 03:27:17,821
I went,
yeah,

4056
03:27:17,821 --> 03:27:21,910
it's like a band.
So it's almost exactly like a bad fuck

4057
03:27:22,040 --> 03:27:23,550
kind of question.
Is this,

4058
03:27:24,140 --> 03:27:26,470
how did this get started?
Draft.

4059
03:27:26,520 --> 03:27:28,650
So anyhow,
we started talking about when I'm with

4060
03:27:28,651 --> 03:27:30,780
the MC five and the stooges and we
would.

4061
03:27:30,980 --> 03:27:31,950
And I go,
yeah man,

4062
03:27:31,951 --> 03:27:34,170
I was snorting something.
I don't know what it was,

4063
03:27:34,230 --> 03:27:35,820
man,
I just got higher than a kite.

4064
03:27:35,821 --> 03:27:36,870
And he goes,
wow,

4065
03:27:36,880 --> 03:27:38,670
you think it might've been a crystal
meth?

4066
03:27:38,671 --> 03:27:39,181
And I went,
yeah,

4067
03:27:39,181 --> 03:27:41,070
that's what they called it.
I never snorted,

4068
03:27:41,410 --> 03:27:43,450
just made up some shit.
Just went nuts.

4069
03:27:43,451 --> 03:27:45,790
And I,
we went into the war thing and I go,

4070
03:27:45,791 --> 03:27:47,230
I don't know anything about war.
I'm a,

4071
03:27:47,290 --> 03:27:50,110
I'm a guitar player.
But I went down for my draft physical

4072
03:27:50,111 --> 03:27:53,350
and when I went into the a booth to give
my urine sample,

4073
03:27:53,351 --> 03:27:55,630
I made sure I eat Mexican food all week.

4074
03:27:55,630 --> 03:27:59,050
So instead of pissing in the Urine Cup,
I took a big dump in it was green and

4075
03:27:59,051 --> 03:28:00,400
went all over the place.
And the guy went,

4076
03:28:01,330 --> 03:28:05,440
wow,
he really ain't really.

4077
03:28:05,770 --> 03:28:08,950
And so I made up the story for High
Times magazine,

4078
03:28:08,951 --> 03:28:12,760
you know,
the great magazine of good information.

4079
03:28:13,150 --> 03:28:16,270
And uh,
and then it turned out that my drummer,

4080
03:28:16,271 --> 03:28:17,380
Kj night,
God bless him,

4081
03:28:17,381 --> 03:28:21,520
he was actually admitted this in and
testified that that's what he did.

4082
03:28:22,990 --> 03:28:26,470
We thought it was the funniest thing in
the world were teenagers and this guy

4083
03:28:26,471 --> 03:28:31,390
went into the draft physical,
just an absolute near death lump of Shit

4084
03:28:31,391 --> 03:28:33,900
to get out of the draft.
And we thought it was funnier than hell.

4085
03:28:33,920 --> 03:28:36,160
We weren't paying attention to important
things in life.

4086
03:28:36,400 --> 03:28:41,290
And so the,
the Ted Hating liberal press started

4087
03:28:41,291 --> 03:28:46,291
quoting the high times magazine and
quoting an ex girlfriend who claimed

4088
03:28:47,741 --> 03:28:50,330
that I had adopted her,
that her,

4089
03:28:51,070 --> 03:28:54,370
I adopted my girlfriend to have you read
that one.

4090
03:28:54,430 --> 03:28:55,910
I did read that one.
I forgot about it.

4091
03:28:56,800 --> 03:28:58,960
So this kind of stuff,
I was like,

4092
03:28:58,961 --> 03:29:01,570
you adopted her so you could take her on
tour with,

4093
03:29:01,571 --> 03:29:03,190
you know,
so I could fuck her.

4094
03:29:03,400 --> 03:29:06,490
That's what the story was.
But that's APP.

4095
03:29:07,280 --> 03:29:09,280
Absolutely.
That's how it works.

4096
03:29:09,310 --> 03:29:11,500
That's not how I think.
It makes it easy to talk to them once

4097
03:29:11,501 --> 03:29:14,670
you adopt them.
I didn't adopt anybody Christ.

4098
03:29:14,830 --> 03:29:19,240
I never shit my pants since I was,
I think eight months old.

4099
03:29:19,620 --> 03:29:21,580
Um,
I've never been with an underage girl

4100
03:29:21,581 --> 03:29:24,730
since I was under age.
I'm not a racist.

4101
03:29:24,731 --> 03:29:25,690
And what else they said,
oh,

4102
03:29:25,691 --> 03:29:29,140
and they seem that they claim that I
made courtney love blow me when she was

4103
03:29:29,141 --> 03:29:30,730
12.
I think she claimed that.

4104
03:29:30,970 --> 03:29:32,770
Yeah,
I never met Courtney love.

4105
03:29:32,771 --> 03:29:37,270
You can tell I don't have a rash of you
gotta be kidding me.

4106
03:29:37,540 --> 03:29:42,540
They just make this shit up because they
know I'm so good at bringing my basic

4107
03:29:45,160 --> 03:29:50,160
conservative agenda forward that they
have to go full solid Linsky and lie and

4108
03:29:51,671 --> 03:29:53,470
lie and lie.

4109
03:29:53,620 --> 03:29:57,130
And if you go to Wikipedia to find out
about Ted Nugent,

4110
03:29:57,370 --> 03:30:00,880
they will repeat these lies.
They're lies.

4111
03:30:01,000 --> 03:30:03,400
And every one of those things,
every one of those things,

4112
03:30:03,401 --> 03:30:04,510
if I had done it,
I go,

4113
03:30:04,570 --> 03:30:05,860
yeah,
it was awesome.

4114
03:30:05,890 --> 03:30:08,560
But I didn't do any of those things.
Anyone can edit wikipedia,

4115
03:30:08,561 --> 03:30:10,500
you know,
very strange.

4116
03:30:10,790 --> 03:30:13,650
Think she might have edited it yet.
So it was,

4117
03:30:13,670 --> 03:30:15,970
I'm glad we got that.
So this thing is just persistent

4118
03:30:15,971 --> 03:30:17,950
forever.
Obviously it stuck in your crop because

4119
03:30:17,951 --> 03:30:19,250
you wanted to bring it up at the very
end.

4120
03:30:19,270 --> 03:30:20,710
It doesn't take up my cross.
Just.

4121
03:30:20,711 --> 03:30:25,120
It's a fascinating example of the
dishonesty and the anti journalism

4122
03:30:25,390 --> 03:30:29,950
agenda driven.
I'm anti Anti-american Anti-tech,

4123
03:30:29,980 --> 03:30:33,430
anti second amendment,
anti freedom buffoonery.

4124
03:30:33,431 --> 03:30:35,500
They exist.
I think it makes for an interesting

4125
03:30:35,501 --> 03:30:37,500
podcast exchange.
I think so.

4126
03:30:37,600 --> 03:30:40,010
It's not in my crotch.
It's not even in my universe,

4127
03:30:40,220 --> 03:30:42,080
but I notice it.
It's hysterical.

4128
03:30:42,260 --> 03:30:43,080
Ted nugent,
ladies.

4129
03:30:43,080 --> 03:30:45,920
Gentlemen,
there you have it fully.

4130
03:30:46,070 --> 03:30:47,600
Until next week.
Bye everybody.
