1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,453
Okay.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,890
We live Amy Schumer.

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:07,890
Oh,

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,641
very funny today.

5
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:09,241
It was hilarious.

6
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:09,750
He killed it.

7
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,550
I think beyond expectations,

8
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,290
you destroyed really very funny.

9
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:16,050
He made me how well I was
howling laughing very hard,

10
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,400
like four or five times.

11
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:17,941
It really,

12
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:19,050
really very,

13
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:19,870
very funny.

14
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,703
And uh,

15
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,650
I'm excited that we pulled this off.

16
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,101
You know,

17
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:23,351
we,

18
00:00:23,351 --> 00:00:24,600
we communicated online.

19
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:27,120
We haven't even met until today.

20
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,540
The wonderment of the Internet isn't
the Internet and fucking a gem.

21
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,770
Isn't that fantastic Brian?

22
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,480
He's a lovely,

23
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,390
it's really outrageous.

24
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:36,840
I mean,

25
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,730
I was introduced to you.

26
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:39,181
Like I said,

27
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:39,681
from the trolley,

28
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:41,820
she and rose like right away.

29
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,240
I said,

30
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,781
oh my God,

31
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:43,650
this chick's hilarious.

32
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,040
Well,

33
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,660
how great would she be on the podcast?

34
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,081
Boom,

35
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:46,441
boom,

36
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:46,801
boom.

37
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:47,970
Tweets back and forth.

38
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:48,804
Shit happens.

39
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,340
I don't even know the exact order.

40
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,060
Bam.

41
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:51,893
Look who's here.

42
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,130
Amy Schumer,

43
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:53,963
who could crushed it?

44
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,770
Amy Schumer misleading.

45
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,180
What's The lady right here?

46
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,571
Dude?

47
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:00,270
If you ever come here
and move here for real,

48
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:01,950
we want to hook you up for the podcast.

49
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:03,300
You're perfect for this shit.

50
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,250
It would change everything if you want to,

51
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,420
if you want to do really well.

52
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:07,254
It's comedian,

53
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,460
it's the best tool.

54
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:10,230
Like we're immediately,

55
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,490
you're going to get a big jump
in the amount of people that,

56
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,940
that,

57
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,690
that come to your show.

58
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,400
Yeah,

59
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,890
I think,

60
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:15,190
yeah,

61
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,030
I think it's my,

62
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:16,864
um,

63
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,430
my hesitance maybe that because of that.

64
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,383
That's why you're funny.

65
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,420
It's really a problem.

66
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:23,750
Well,

67
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,580
we're people who like are super ambitious
and promoting themselves are often

68
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,980
terrible douche bags.

69
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,063
They have like,

70
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,550
uh,

71
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,241
there's a two,

72
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:32,350
there's two different mentalities.

73
00:01:32,351 --> 00:01:34,330
Like there's a mentality
of like promotion,

74
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,100
which is like,

75
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,890
I'm amazing.

76
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:36,910
You're part of the team.

77
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,170
We're doing this together.

78
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,580
Team really well.

79
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,680
Like Dane Cook was,

80
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,510
I liked Danko.

81
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,330
He's a good dude.

82
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,760
But I remember when he had the super
finger get the fuck outta here,

83
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:46,594
man.

84
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,640
Finger super figured you'd
like sue fire everybody.

85
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,860
It became his thing.

86
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,390
Like so far I was like his tee shirt.

87
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,290
He got crazy.

88
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:57,880
Yeah.

89
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,713
I don't know.

90
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,443
I don't know of a finger.

91
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,600
So that's a dramatic marketing move.

92
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:03,110
You know what I'm saying?

93
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,250
You don't have that in,

94
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:05,084
you know,

95
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,670
I was too naive to know
that I need that right now.

96
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,180
You don't need that,

97
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,840
but you can get a with

98
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,400
Jetta with boys with matches.

99
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,380
That was your thing.

100
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,750
Insurance say he could eat it.

101
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,430
Okay.

102
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,263
You guys,

103
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,530
I'm telling you if that
would be your opening move.

104
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,101
Get a whiff.

105
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:27,850
Boys.

106
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,683
If he just

107
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,851
get a whiff,

108
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,160
boys and two.

109
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,940
I like it.

110
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,300
I like what you're doing.

111
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,850
Is it a worse parent?

112
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:37,684
Like who?

113
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,710
I don't trust.

114
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,060
I don't think I just learned
once it gets to the Internet,

115
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,370
whatever.

116
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,730
Where I miss you guys that I
will never try that I will never,

117
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,420
sorry.

118
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,230
We're gonna do is we're going to get
a less talented comedian and feed them

119
00:02:57,231 --> 00:03:01,900
lines that we can come up with and if
that's a great idea at them to infiltrate

120
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,080
and become your best friend.

121
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,590
It's your comedy.

122
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,603
This is a,

123
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,670
we're going to have a tactical approach.

124
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,830
She's a crusher.

125
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,530
You gotta be careful.

126
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,363
Lunesta.

127
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:19,950
Yeah.

128
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,411
It's very funny.

129
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:21,640
Young lady who was a friend of ours,

130
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,340
she's the only other girl that just squad,

131
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,320
which you just joined.

132
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,250
Didn't realize he joined
the desk and me forever.

133
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:32,860
Well,

134
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,840
it's a Fisheye Lens.

135
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,520
That's fine.

136
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,353
Not Flattering.

137
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,600
Look at his face.

138
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,520
Just to forget about all this jazz.

139
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,170
Concentrate on Brian.

140
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,243
Brian right there.

141
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,780
You guys had a relationship

142
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,690
with someone who's aging poorly,

143
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,810
but it is weird.

144
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,673
It's a weird lens,

145
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,550
but um,

146
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,200
you guys had a relationship
on the podcast.

147
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:54,550
It was very strange in the beginning.

148
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:56,780
He was trying to please
you and he's trying to

149
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,970
get a little weird with you.

150
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,560
I just don't understand New York.

151
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,440
He thinks that New York people like,

152
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:09,280
Geez,

153
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,350
he thinks New York people
are kind of Douchey.

154
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,080
No,

155
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,930
I don't like people that much.

156
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,883
So

157
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,560
everywhere sounds

158
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,860
won't travel with them.

159
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,650
The idea live in stacked
on top of each other.

160
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,580
Like a hundred stories.

161
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:25,414
It's kind of night.

162
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,700
Yeah.

163
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,580
It's not good for you.

164
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,960
What are the big apartment buildings?

165
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:29,980
I mean a hundred stores is like,

166
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,000
that's the empire state building,

167
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:31,400
right?

168
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:31,810
Yeah.

169
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,291
What is,

170
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,390
what is like a big high rise in New York?

171
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:35,950
Because it's 60 70 floors.

172
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,810
Did they have like 64 sir?

173
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,153
How nuts is that?

174
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,410
Each other like 40 right?

175
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,593
I don't know.

176
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,650
I live on the first floor.

177
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,620
I know I get there and a moist half awake.

178
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,730
I'm always drinking coffee,

179
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:50,230
trying to wake up for opie and Anthony,

180
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,320
and if you're dealing with
all that regretting them,

181
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,510
those guys are the shit that,

182
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,060
that,

183
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,000
those guys are like.

184
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,050
Every time you do that show,

185
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:00,670
it's like hanging out with some friends.

186
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,480
It's like,

187
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,170
it's like,

188
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:02,650
you know,

189
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,100
it's doesn't feel like a radio show.

190
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:04,380
No,

191
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,213
it doesn't feel like,

192
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,720
you know,

193
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,530
it feels like you're all just shooting
the shit and try and make each other

194
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:09,280
laugh.

195
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,900
You feel better about
myself because I'm like,

196
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,121
ah,

197
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:13,030
now I know I'm not the
worst person on earth.

198
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,141
Well,

199
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:15,700
you also feel good,

200
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:16,091
don't you?

201
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:18,790
Because like you're kind of in
with these guys and everyone's,

202
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,500
you know that you're a
part of that and they all,

203
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,210
I remember,

204
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:21,690
I mean,

205
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,590
I had been doing comedy for a long time
at the first time I came on the show and

206
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,120
I was like,

207
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,391
you know,

208
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,730
I think they're kind of
notoriously tough on people.

209
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,661
Then all of sudden I'm like,

210
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,051
Holy Shit,

211
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:30,030
I'm on the opiate Anthony's right?

212
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,883
Like this is,

213
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,210
you know,

214
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,043
and it's working.

215
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:32,951
Let's go,

216
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:35,140
well this is pretty fucking bad ass.

217
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,470
Yeah.

218
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,190
Cause you,

219
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,400
when you're a young comic and
there's any established radio show,

220
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:41,300
whether it's Howard stern or you know any,

221
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,280
anyone where it's like,

222
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:42,521
you know,

223
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:43,241
like Holy Shit,

224
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:44,250
like this is like a,

225
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,891
a big,

226
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:45,461
like I did,

227
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:45,760
uh,

228
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,760
there was a guy and I'm mark Parenteau
was like big and WBCN in Boston and I did

229
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,540
his radio show once and I was like,

230
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:53,374
Holy Shit,

231
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,170
I can't believe him doing his radio show.

232
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,520
Listen to this radio show when I was
a kid and I went to be on it live.

233
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:58,731
Yeah.

234
00:05:58,731 --> 00:05:59,161
That's how I,

235
00:05:59,161 --> 00:05:59,994
when I was for me.

236
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,460
Yeah.

237
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,293
Yeah.

238
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:01,950
Anytime.

239
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,240
Yeah.

240
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,900
You're like,

241
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,733
you're on.

242
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,770
Like if you,

243
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:08,340
you friends with Patrice and if you sit
in there with Patrice and you and him

244
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:10,520
and you know there's
Lucy Kay and Bobby Kelly.

245
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,570
Everybody's just shooting the shit.

246
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,231
Jimmy Norton.

247
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:14,070
It's like what a crazy little roundtable.

248
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,130
What a fun way to do a radio show.

249
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,003
Yeah.

250
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,140
You're making me grateful.

251
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:18,910
Oh,

252
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,743
you shouldn't be.

253
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,101
No,

254
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:20,420
I do.

255
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,700
I appreciate when we did Vegas with them.

256
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,170
How fucking fun was that?

257
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,610
It was fucking great.

258
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:25,971
You know,

259
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:28,880
that was really the only
time I got the hung out with.

260
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,350
I got to hang out with Patrice.

261
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,910
I didn't know Patrice that well.

262
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,451
You know,

263
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:33,530
I knew of him,

264
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:33,801
you know,

265
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:36,140
and when I met him I would
say hi to him and you know,

266
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:37,100
but we really,

267
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:39,500
the first time we really hung
out and talked was in Vegas,

268
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,460
was for that big,

269
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,323
oh it ain't show.

270
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,840
I got to hang out with him.

271
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,510
Talks about all kinds of shit.

272
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,171
Who got booed?

273
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:45,921
Not that one.

274
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:48,950
I know one that was the
Vegas one was a happy one.

275
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:49,993
It was fun.

276
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,660
While I flip,

277
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,660
I like to think of did
another one they would ask me,

278
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,421
they would totally ask you,

279
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:55,880
but the crowds were monsters.

280
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,030
I opened for Norton for a long time
in the road and it's different though.

281
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,710
These crowds are awesome.

282
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,320
But the ONA crowds,

283
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,430
there was savages,

284
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,343
savages,

285
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,880
crossover for sure.

286
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:10,370
But there's a lot of dudes that
would try to make guys fail.

287
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,650
I might eat shit there,

288
00:07:11,651 --> 00:07:13,340
but I would like to risk it.

289
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,660
Did you see the bill burr video

290
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,960
bill burrs a monster?

291
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,430
Yeah.

292
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,870
If you don't know what it is folks,

293
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:21,950
check out bill bird.

294
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,330
This is Philadelphia.

295
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,980
They went on and booed dom.

296
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:26,690
I rera who for guys like me.

297
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:26,930
Dot.

298
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,650
My rare it's,

299
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,340
you know,

300
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,780
not just a friend of mine,

301
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,510
he's a Philly staple and uh,

302
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,340
he's a great standup comedian
and they were so mean.

303
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,320
They booed him like right from the star.

304
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:36,801
I just,

305
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:38,240
cause he doesn't do ONA that much.

306
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:39,680
I mean why did they boons it wasn't valid

307
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:47,000
for whatever reason they booed dom Irrera
and so bill burr was so incensed by

308
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:47,390
this.

309
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:51,920
He went up and just shit all over
Philly cause his whole act 10 minutes,

310
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,550
10 minutes.

311
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,560
You've got some of the best
boxes to have a commodity here.

312
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,820
Who Do you fucking love?

313
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,380
A white guy from a movie.

314
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:58,400
It was not real.

315
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,900
They thought rocky.

316
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,550
Oh was genius.

317
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,080
It was genius.

318
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,880
It's so good.

better fanny pack.

344
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,130
See I'm not at that level.

345
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,270
I got to stick with the plain black fanny
pack and hope that it kind of fades in

346
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:00,960
the background.

347
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,180
This motherfucker shows up for the
weigh ins at a hot pink one hit.

348
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,810
Had a hot pink fanny pack
wants to the way is amazing.

349
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,380
Can you have one with like sequins
on it and she just rainbow sequence.

350
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:17,361
I know.

351
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:19,510
That's what people keep telling me this.

352
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,050
He looks like he's been
hanging out with me.

353
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
This is Anthony Giordano.

354
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,710
He's the guy who directed my a spike TV
comedy special and the next one and the

355
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:29,630
next one from Atlanta.

356
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,440
My Eyes Barbecue.

357
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,943
The

358
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,360
barbecue.

359
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,193
How high does he look?

360
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,491
Dude,

361
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:44,480
you look fucking high.

362
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,910
You look like you couldn't get any higher.

363
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,010
If you are high as kitty right now,

364
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,400
you were in a car with me
and it costs Bolus over.

365
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,600
I'd say pretend you're asleep.

366
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,250
My eyes are red or all their bread.

367
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,510
They're swollen and puffy.

368
00:10:01,511 --> 00:10:01,751
Come on.

369
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:02,050
Are you?

370
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:02,500
Hi Him.

371
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,170
I'm not at all.

372
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,930
I will tell you Anthony,

373
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:06,130
I just do me a favor and turn right.

374
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:06,641
Just Paul and me.

375
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:07,720
Some of that shit right now.

376
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,013
Tell you,

377
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,720
show you what it's.

378
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:13,554
Go say

379
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,450
hi,

380
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,490
I'm Joe Susa.

381
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,423
Nice.

382
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,273
Awesome.

383
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,300
What about freaks out of the Internet?

384
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,820
Because this thing is
this thing run some late.

385
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:39,770
Some guy tried to tell me on Twitter,

386
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,400
like I was saying that
the pride lady was okay.

387
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:45,230
I said she was really good,

388
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,120
but she's not Bruce buffer.

389
00:10:47,121 --> 00:10:48,200
I prefer Bruce Buffer.

390
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:48,981
And the guy's like,

391
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,390
are you fucking crazy?

392
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,373
The Pri Lady,

393
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,490
I got two words for you,

394
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,950
but for three 16 that's it.

395
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,360
It's the end of the conversation.

396
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:01,460
You're the only one who would
do that crazy private lady.

397
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,550
She might go vine.

398
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,400
It's Kinda cool.

399
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,031
It's Kinda cool,

400
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:08,170
but it's not as good as the buffer.

401
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:09,190
Do you know what I just
realized right now?

402
00:11:09,191 --> 00:11:10,330
We don't need her cause I got you.

403
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:12,160
You should be up there and
we share in the guys with me.

404
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:12,371
Yeah,

405
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,204
I could do it.

406
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,373
Yeah.

407
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,540
Lenay is tweeting me to directly.

408
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:18,901
She's like,

409
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:21,310
we need to get together for drinks when
you're here we need to get together with

410
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:21,500
friends,

411
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,800
so fuck you and steal your power.

412
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,010
I just don't like the stuff
you say about the mom.

413
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:33,880
No,

414
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,571
I don't know that.

415
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:38,020
And I always want you to
know that if I say anything,

416
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:39,580
it's never out of disrespect.

417
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:43,340
I like you and are always
tell you there were,

418
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,171
since we hung out together,

419
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:45,004
when we do it inside,

420
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,520
I like you do I root for you if I ever
sang in front of me because I want you to

421
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:52,354
do that.

422
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,480
Hey,

423
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,080
I'd like you to,

424
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,000
if you know what I'm saying.

425
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:55,834
But it's just like,

426
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,790
it's just the outcome of like I
got these new fancy new UFC fans.

427
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:02,200
They don't know what the
fuck they talking about.

428
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:03,040
And when I meet them,

429
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,140
I'm tired of them saying that shit.

430
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,661
Did you say,

431
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:07,140
did they repeat a lot
of shit and they do it.

432
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,360
I respect that immensely.

433
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,863
Well,

434
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,620
all I'm doing is just trying
to get my thoughts on the shit.

435
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,480
I understand that it
fucks with you personally.

436
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,900
I can take criticism.

437
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,140
No,

438
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,160
but I don't want that.

439
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,510
What I'm trying to say is
I've never tried to do that.

440
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,340
It hurt my feelings.

441
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:28,670
Well,

442
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,021
I'll tell you,

443
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:29,854
I'm trying to fuck with you.

444
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,161
Honestly.

445
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:30,491
I'm gonna you.

446
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:30,651
Hey,

447
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:31,630
I can take criticism.

448
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:32,464
It didn't bother me.

449
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,840
Every time I meet one of these fans,

450
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:35,670
it's bringing shit up,

451
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,503
man.

452
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,281
Never had a case.

453
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:38,520
And you need to learn how to black kids.

454
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,290
You learn,

455
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,390
do you do you train?

456
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:41,380
UFC was like,

457
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,611
you know what I'm saying?

458
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:43,444
I'm like,

459
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,330
it makes,

460
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,520
that turns me off to those fans,

461
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:46,470
maybe not even wanna talk to him.

462
00:12:46,471 --> 00:12:48,760
So once I just walk
away or cussed them out,

463
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,440
I know that's a problem with the Internet
and the problem with the accessibility

464
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:54,980
that you even run it to
a certain amount of shit.

465
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,860
I know we do this the problem.

466
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,431
That's where I'm at.

467
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:58,810
Then I figured,

468
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,644
you know what I'm saying?

469
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,160
They didn't start to shift to a,

470
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,033
came here,

471
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,200
listen,

472
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,751
listen and stuff.

473
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:05,360
You say,

474
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,250
I don't say you got your job,

475
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:06,521
dude.

476
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:07,354
You know what I'm saying?

477
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,170
I can honestly say that I'm wrong for
even going in San and intermediate,

478
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:13,330
but when I did the interview or yeah,

479
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,740
I must've just seen some shit.

480
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,060
That's how I work.

481
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,230
I must've just saying some shit.

482
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,470
I just heard some shit right before I
did the interview and that's how I work

483
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,990
because I don't remember what I said now.

484
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,580
It doesn't matter.

485
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,413
You know?

486
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,180
I just want you to know that it's
never disrespectful and if I,

487
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:31,970
if it never on my phone
number saying anything,

488
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,873
just we need to do.

489
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:33,800
All right.

490
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,633
Rolling.

491
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,563
Don't worry about it.

492
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,063
Correct.

493
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,643
Okay.

494
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,513
Yeah.

495
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,293
Oh

496
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,410
[inaudible] [inaudible]

497
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,220
be real nice gentleman
to send out the podcast.

498
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,671
It was fun,

499
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:16,504
man.

500
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,053
Thanks for having me.

501
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:20,783
Thanks for,

502
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,720
we freaked everybody out.

503
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,910
We've got scared about animals.

504
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:25,744
It was awesome.

505
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,230
Especially talking about scary shit.

506
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,790
It's something fun about being high,

507
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,430
talking about things they can fuck
you up in another part of the world.

508
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,750
I don't know what it is,

509
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,100
but it's so compelling,

510
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,650
but it's good to know
what gets stuck you up.

511
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,120
It is hard to sit there and go there.

512
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,090
Avoid the shit.

513
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,060
Yeah,

514
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,541
don't get,

515
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:47,291
get out of your car.

516
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,850
State me your fucking car man.

517
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:50,470
And there's birds that will kill you.

518
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,131
Okay.

519
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:53,950
This fucking crazy birds in
Australia that will jack you.

520
00:15:53,951 --> 00:15:56,140
They run up to people on the beach
and they check him occasionally.

521
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,150
Talk that crazy.

522
00:15:58,151 --> 00:15:58,984
Fuck that.

523
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,970
I'm not going to the beach.

524
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,281
Is that going?

525
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:03,850
Is that rolling?

526
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,150
Oh,

527
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,391
hey,

528
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:05,410
we're great for 10 minutes.

529
00:16:05,411 --> 00:16:05,950
This is,

530
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,330
we do a post,

531
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,500
uh,

532
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,380
post podcasts.

533
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:10,214
Video blogs.

534
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:10,990
Yeah.

535
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,660
We have a lot of people put videos.

536
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,621
That's cool.

537
00:16:14,621 --> 00:16:15,760
At one more way to reach people,

538
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,613
man.

539
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:19,950
Underneath it all.

540
00:16:19,951 --> 00:16:20,221
I mean,

541
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:21,720
you're talking to him and live.

542
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,740
You talking to him here to
tweeting and we're doing this.

543
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:26,061
What,

544
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:26,940
what is it?

545
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,980
I mean obviously if you were Santorum,

546
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,210
you would just want people to kill
abortion doctors and such as tick.

547
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,450
That's what he wants.

548
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,550
One scarves to sergeant star.

549
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,270
I would let people do that.

550
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,223
That's what he wants.

551
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,920
He wants you think that's what's
underneath it all starts with stuff.

552
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:44,100
Just took his [inaudible] pretty sure
whenever guys trying to stop gay things,

553
00:16:44,101 --> 00:16:44,934
he's usually gay.

554
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,870
Yes.

555
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:47,761
It's probably a little bit,

556
00:16:47,761 --> 00:16:52,270
maybe it's 10% but if you're allowing
gay things then you're gay or straight.

557
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,040
If you're promoting gay
things should definitely do,

558
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,290
can't win out of the closet.

559
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,400
When you're in the closet.

560
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:56,871
You,

561
00:16:56,871 --> 00:16:59,640
you try to stop Caifanes
we've got to stop this.

562
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,710
Well that's why I loved um,

563
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,190
uh,

564
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,660
what's her name's husbands as
she was running for a couple of,

565
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,330
yeah.

566
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:06,730
Oh,

567
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,520
Christine.

568
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:07,821
Yeah.

569
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:08,654
What's the name?

570
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:08,970
Oh,

571
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,710
Donal.

572
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,543
Christine O'Donnell.

573
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:10,821
No,

574
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:10,941
no,

575
00:17:10,941 --> 00:17:11,121
no.

576
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:12,500
That's the Senate Delaware.

577
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:13,070
Michelle Buck.

578
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:13,510
Michele.

579
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:13,900
Bob.

580
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,280
Her husband was doing like a,

581
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,370
a a learn how to not be gay thing and
then you see him dancing and shit.

582
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,200
Ba is greatest.

583
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,770
I just wanted her to become president
because what a story that was big and

584
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:25,250
awesome.

585
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,330
She kind of just stopped.

586
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,110
Right?

587
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,490
She got trounced.

588
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:31,750
I mean she was getting no numbers and so
she went back to Texas and she endorsed

589
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,773
Mitt Romney

590
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,890
but getting back to a gay,

591
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,040
what's the gay is thing like if you
had to think in your life that was,

592
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:44,690
what was the moment you are
the gayest I guess Jujitsu.

593
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,460
Yeah,

594
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,001
essentially.

595
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:47,480
And your,

596
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,160
your your fucking underwear but cop

597
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,810
on she ever get any?

598
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,680
No.

599
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,880
Anybody else ever get any,

600
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,270
Ooh,

601
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:54,961
that would be a bump.

602
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:56,190
That would make it a real fight.

603
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:01,250
That would instantly transition to
like your story that you told them the

604
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:04,350
podcasts about going over the rave scene
seems the girl and he had a bone or the

605
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,184
whole time,

606
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:05,880
sorry.

607
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,713
Sorry.

608
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,840
I think I did that with Jujitsu.

609
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,800
That would be a real problem though.

610
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,600
That should be a sport is two guys
wrestling and one of them has to get an

611
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,310
erection to start the fight.

612
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,230
That guy could attack first and you
can only defend until you got your dick

613
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,353
hard.

614
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,820
That might be the gayest
thing I've ever done.

615
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,140
It's the gas thing ever.

616
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,640
That might be the greatest
thing I ever thought up.

617
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,830
Gay and aggressive and dominant.

618
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,780
What's the closest you ever came to?

619
00:18:36,781 --> 00:18:38,130
What will be considered date rape?

620
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,710
Like with a girl like that?

621
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:41,940
I did not scan of gay.

622
00:18:41,941 --> 00:18:42,774
Yeah.

623
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,890
I guess when you're young and
the girl says no and you keep,

624
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,870
you keep grabbing her hand and
put it on your tenure and yeah,

625
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,010
I mean that's essentially she's saying
no and you're still trying to put her

626
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:53,730
hand on your deck.

627
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,180
Yeah,

628
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,080
but you never know when they go.

629
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,750
Okay.

630
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,583
Now

631
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,910
let's talk a lot about rape.

632
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,020
I noticed what were around you

633
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,690
were on you or rape instincts kick in.

634
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,421
He had,

635
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:08,910
there's something about you that,

636
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,530
I'm not getting them out of rapists but
like all I want to do is fucking ray

637
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:15,000
radio in the ass.

638
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,530
I Dunno.

639
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,640
Maybe it's a Boston thing.

640
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,700
Can you grab that?

641
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,780
Still go with this.

642
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,793
I'm not on,

643
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,030
that would be the gayest
thing you've ever done.

644
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,350
I thought you bought that for your girl.

645
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,820
You didn't buy it for her.

646
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,580
He bought for a joke for
somebody not cool dildo.

647
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,200
They're always black cause
that's what everybody wants.

648
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,310
They want,

649
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,840
they want Reggie Bush.

650
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,373
She,

651
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,190
is that what it was to me on ports.

652
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,280
I know female at once.

653
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:49,281
You can buy a fleshlight that that's
like a women's like a porn stars vagina.

654
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,360
They do they have that from your point?

655
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:51,840
Yes.

656
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,021
Yeah,

657
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:52,854
they do.

658
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:53,850
Yeah they have that.

659
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,290
Uh,

660
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,680
I bet they have a for
dudes bottles cause I know,

661
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,893
I bet they do.

662
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,973
Gay dudes.

663
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,310
How'd you like to be the guy that's
going to measure and sculpted?

664
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,133
I wouldn't like to be that guy.

665
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,660
That would be the gang.

666
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:09,180
It's the electric rate.

667
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,260
Well I want to,

668
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,620
I feel like at some points in the
interview I started interviewing you and I

669
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:17,281
apologize.

670
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:18,900
It was like a conversation.

671
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:22,020
It wasn't even an envelope and there were
some things I just wanted to ask you.

672
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,430
Open ended existential things because uh,

673
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,040
I think that you have a
unique perspectives on things.

674
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,510
And so I was curious about some of them,

675
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:34,620
like gun control we were talking about
earlier and I was always for gun control.

676
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,890
And a couple of weeks ago
I completely flipped sides.

677
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:40,320
And now I don't think that
everyone should have a gun,

678
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,760
but I just can't.

679
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,270
I'm a,

680
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,200
I'm a facts guy and I looked at all
the numbers and it's very hard to

681
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,700
legitimately say that we need to

682
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,060
have gun control.

683
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,050
Well,

684
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:54,170
there should be some control
or some criminal shouldn't
be allowed to have guns.

685
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,220
And I agree it shouldn't be,

686
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,080
you shouldn't be screenings.

687
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,380
You know,

688
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,340
there should be that,

689
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,350
that I agree with all that stuff.

690
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,860
But what I don't agree with is the idea
that we live in some sort of a Utopian

691
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:06,890
society where violence has been cured
and you don't need to protect yourself.

692
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,000
That's crazy.

693
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,200
If cops have guns,

694
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,100
people should have guns.

695
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,960
There's a reason why the
compounds that we've got,

696
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,000
the cop asked to have a
gun to protect society.

697
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:14,781
Well,

698
00:21:14,781 --> 00:21:15,710
one of the cops aren't there.

699
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,101
Well,

700
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:17,420
you better have a fucking gun.

701
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,643
You should have a gun.

702
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,310
You shouldn't use it if
you don't have to use it.

703
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,970
But would they say brandishing it,

704
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:23,810
um,

705
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:28,700
prevents like 90 something percent of
crimes from happening and then eventually

706
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,600
you don't even have to brand.

707
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,910
It should because people have
to wonder if you have one.

708
00:21:31,911 --> 00:21:32,300
Yeah,

709
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,480
I guess I'm not suddenly
like I'm not encouraging it.

710
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,260
It's just,

711
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,120
it was fucking mind opening to have
held a belief for so many years and then

712
00:21:41,121 --> 00:21:43,970
realize that it was the
foundation of it was off.

713
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,833
It's a core tenant

714
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,640
of left wing thinking that you're
supposed to get the guns or make them as

715
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,900
restrictive as possible.

716
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:51,890
People don't need guns.

717
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,880
Guns cause problems.

718
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,901
It's like that's,

719
00:21:53,901 --> 00:21:54,440
you know,

720
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,320
there's certain thinking like
abortion should be legal.

721
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:00,020
Women has a right to choose and you know
when you bring it home you should be

722
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:00,651
able to shoot the,

723
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:02,120
maybe it's a fetus,

724
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:02,991
you bring it up to them.

725
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:05,270
Like what's really going on when you're
saying the right to choose to choose to

726
00:22:05,271 --> 00:22:07,250
suck that baby out with
the vacuum and kill it.

727
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:07,950
No,

728
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:08,600
no.

729
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,440
Well yes,

730
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,310
sort of.

731
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,960
I mean at what point in time is it a baby?

732
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,921
Three months.

733
00:22:12,921 --> 00:22:14,450
At four months they started
looking like things.

734
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:14,960
Yeah.

735
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,221
And it's,

736
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:19,070
it is illegal then or it's not legal
that it's legal then it's a ball of mush.

737
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,400
Yeah.

738
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,480
When it comes to looking like a baby,

739
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:21,630
then it's not like,

740
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,120
but no one wants to even
have that discussion.

741
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:24,560
Now.

742
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,630
The cat's had a joke.

743
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,101
He goes,

744
00:22:26,101 --> 00:22:30,240
I believe that human life begins
after the Second Cup of coffee,

745
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,920
but the best is the Republicans ago.

746
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,221
All right,

747
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:36,054
here's the caveat.

748
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,630
Uh,

749
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,070
no abortion,

750
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,530
except in the case of rape and incest.

751
00:22:40,531 --> 00:22:40,771
Okay?

752
00:22:40,771 --> 00:22:44,130
So what you're saying is that's a
human life and it's being murdered,

753
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,400
but it's okay to murder it if
somebody who raped somebody.

754
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,320
Well,

755
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,131
if you don't live for,

756
00:22:49,131 --> 00:22:49,840
it's not

757
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,560
Rick Santorum says that you
should celebrate the rate
baby because it's a gift

758
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:54,394
from God.

759
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,610
How do you celebrate?

760
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,110
Do you have what you'd even have
a board like every birthday,

761
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,680
happy birthday to you.

762
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,451
Gift from God.

763
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,284
So rape baby.

764
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:05,920
Wow,

765
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,970
you're like a beautiful baby.

766
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:07,211
I mean the,

767
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:07,401
yeah,

768
00:23:07,401 --> 00:23:08,111
that guy's a rapist.

769
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:09,490
And every time you see him,

770
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:12,840
you have to think about what my baby
looks just like this means help me down

771
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,713
Saturday to me.

772
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,060
But he said that you should.

773
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,181
What do you believe?

774
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:17,260
Should abortion be legal?

775
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,230
I don't believe I have the right to tell
you what to do with a bunch of cells in

776
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:23,290
your body and that we'd have to decide
at what point in time does that become a

777
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:23,710
life?

778
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,191
And it was,

779
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:27,910
it isn't an early detection issue
cause it was an early detection issue.

780
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:32,911
I mean how much different is it to
have a birth control pill that tricks

781
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,090
chemically the body into the sperm
comes in and tries to do its job,

782
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,670
but there's nothing there because the
body thinks that it's already pregnant.

783
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,130
How much different is that
than killing two cells?

784
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,730
The birth control pill actually allow
a sperm attach and then it goes right.

785
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,840
No birth control pill
is essentially hormones.

786
00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:52,330
The trick the woman's body into
thinking that it's already pregnant.

787
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,210
So no sperm ever attaches
to it to an over,

788
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,920
maybe it's not a hundred
percent effective.

789
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,370
The way it works is the women can't get
pregnant while they're already pregnant.

790
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:04,110
So it's setting the hormones that
leapt up to about another story with,

791
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,460
yeah,

792
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:05,720
yeah.

793
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,480
Well that's why it really
fucks with their whole system,

794
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,101
you know?

795
00:24:08,101 --> 00:24:08,200
Right.

796
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,490
It's like you should just be a way,

797
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:12,100
I mean the diaphragm
is a bad example of it,

798
00:24:12,101 --> 00:24:16,630
but diaphragm kind of thing where it
just goes in when you're in a period of

799
00:24:16,631 --> 00:24:19,270
your life where you're not going to
have babies and it comes off when you're

800
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:23,050
ready and if you can't and it should be
cheap and it should be paid for by the

801
00:24:23,051 --> 00:24:24,610
government function.

802
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:24,971
Well,

803
00:24:24,971 --> 00:24:26,440
because they used to
make them out of metal,

804
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,410
I UDS or metal and now they make
them out of some kind of thing

805
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,630
or metal and your pussy
just to stop loads.

806
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,550
I know.

807
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:33,760
Yeah,

808
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,650
it was a spring.

809
00:24:34,651 --> 00:24:34,790
Right,

810
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,511
but isn't that,

811
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:35,810
I mean,

812
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:40,810
isn't that a as close to a perfect
solution as we can get has just on off.

813
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,690
It's an off switch

814
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:42,770
I guess.

815
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,101
Yeah.

816
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:45,230
But then like what if society
falls apart and you know,

817
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:48,170
you live in the woods and you really
want to have babies now because society

818
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:49,690
might die off and you've got the slide,

819
00:24:49,691 --> 00:24:52,160
you d stuffed up your pussy and
there's no doctors available.

820
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,240
A couple sticks,

821
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,040
pull it out with some tweezers.

822
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,480
How'd it get in there?

823
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,890
I didn't even look around.

824
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:58,880
Well,

825
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,400
you get little circles.

826
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:01,970
This is what we're going to,

827
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:03,610
I'm going to tie a rope
to it and the other,

828
00:25:03,611 --> 00:25:08,611
but it's going to put on a horse should
have got off and he's got a rug and it

829
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:09,704
pull the ideas

830
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:16,430
and on that note can doors around
or you can go to race track.

831
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,810
Hey Fella,

832
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,750
I went to bed and Suzanne was a video.

833
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,410
You don't even know what the fuck is up.

834
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:28,250
It should have happened.

835
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,513
Bam.

836
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,443
Nowhere.

837
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,180
We just got done doing the podcast
and it was really fucking fun.

838
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,140
Is that a bad example?

839
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,173
That's the reality.

840
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,343
Both

841
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,090
true and real

842
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,580
court.

843
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,413
Ben,

844
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:52,010
we just got done doing the podcast the
first time anybody's ever performed songs

845
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:53,510
on the podcast and that right Brian?

846
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,890
It's pretty bad ass.

847
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,130
Pretty fucking cool.

848
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:56,963
That's a good time.

849
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,423
We had a great time.

850
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,050
We hit a stride to,

851
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,441
yeah,

852
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:01,670
it was really fun in 45 minutes.

853
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:03,870
Then I think runaway,

854
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,410
well,

855
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,970
I got a lot of positive uh,

856
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,520
Twitter responses or super excited about

857
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,680
the insecure.

858
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:16,530
It's good.

859
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,730
It's good to have the balance.

860
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,090
Most of them are insecure
cause he's in subscribes.

861
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,101
Yeah.

862
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:25,310
A little bit terrified of being one that

863
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,470
you don't like.

864
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,370
Female voices.

865
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:30,603
What in what way?

866
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,881
Being a pussy.

867
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,560
But then now I've accepted
it and I enjoy it.

868
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,540
Did you enjoy being a pussy or excepted
accepted people that call you a pussy?

869
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:39,250
You're assholes.

870
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,083
You know what it is.

871
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,290
But that's true.

872
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,010
You know.

873
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,740
But the problem is sometimes you know,

874
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:44,010
you get a

875
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,870
resent non pussies and
that's really not fair.

876
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:46,240
You know,

877
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,210
this sort of reverse
type of discrimination

878
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,970
except him off reverse
discrimination sticks.

879
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,320
Agency did.

880
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,260
You can be a bad ass.

881
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,140
We need you.

882
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,280
Yeah.

883
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,530
That was the yellow belt for a minute.

884
00:26:58,990 --> 00:26:59,470
Yeah.

885
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,360
It's when you're a little kid.

886
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,531
Yeah,

887
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:00,711
yeah,

888
00:27:00,711 --> 00:27:01,200
yeah.

889
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,033
It was spread the light.

890
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,353
Oh and karate.

891
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,910
If you took my my shirt there I'd go,

892
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,210
oh you know how to do it.

893
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,370
Probably take your hand.

894
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,203
Wow.

895
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,360
Like a panther edit out.

896
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,020
Um,

897
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,460
but you started doing it recently,

898
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:17,731
right?

899
00:27:17,731 --> 00:27:18,680
You started taking Jujitsu?

900
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:18,990
I did.

901
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,711
A little while ago.

902
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:20,550
I got the shrimp out.

903
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,420
I've got a couple of them.

904
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,003
Don't worry.

905
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,140
Oh No.

906
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,030
If you know other than the shrimp out,

907
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,570
you'd have to test me
in a combat situation.

908
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,620
I'd rather know I can do a
full Nelson and I heard that,

909
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:33,630
but apparently I heard that
was illegal in wrestling.

910
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,523
I know how to chill.

911
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,583
I'm serious.

912
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:36,781
I know.

913
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:37,440
The one thing,

914
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,940
I think it's illegal in Eritrea

915
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,870
that it's a rear naked choke,

916
00:27:40,871 --> 00:27:43,720
but if you give it like that on the head,

917
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,130
actually us more leverage.

918
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,500
If you go like karate chop.

919
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:47,070
Yeah,

920
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,610
as you,

921
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:48,810
as you get it underneath the neck,

922
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,230
under the arms.

923
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:55,430
This one right here was this way
and then this one lyric there,

924
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,390
grab your bicep like this and then you
karate chop the back of his head like

925
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,010
this.

926
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:00,270
We're not,

927
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,710
that's where the pressure comes in,

928
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,431
but I feel like I,

929
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,590
my Chin tell you really,

930
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,520
you really go,

931
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:05,761
yeah,

932
00:28:05,761 --> 00:28:06,800
he's got his Chin Tuck.

933
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,393
You want to get under that,

934
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,200
but if you've got a really good squeeze,

935
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:11,340
you can take him from there.

936
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,383
Let me tell you something.

937
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:12,870
Well,

938
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,091
okay,

939
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:13,350
I see.

940
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,210
That was an easy,

941
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,230
it doesn't always work.

942
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,320
See a lot of these techniques
that take years to train.

943
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,291
Totally.

944
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:20,230
Maybe look on cool.

945
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,200
I can,

946
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,760
you want me to shine for the children?

947
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,330
I think you kind of shine honey,

948
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,164
honey band.

949
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,250
Follow them on Twitter.

950
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:33,450
It's honey honey band on Twitter at
one whole gigantic word and their honey

951
00:28:33,451 --> 00:28:33,661
honey,

952
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:36,000
ban.com not to be confused with honey.

953
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:39,510
honey.com which is a sad
sight for shitty parenting

954
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,440
is the Joe Rogan experience

955
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,140
12th of never know.

956
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,340
Put it in your calendar.

957
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,010
I didn't even,

958
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:03,861
Oh God,

959
00:29:03,861 --> 00:29:04,694
I'm Austin.

960
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,040
Yeah.
