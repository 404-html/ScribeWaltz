1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,680
The Joe Rogan experience,
that's an interesting way of doing it.

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,170
Are you completely opposed to
legalization?

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:06,951
No,
no,

4
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:09,590
no.
I mean I am not completely opposed to

5
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:13,340
legalization.
Mind concern here is that the country

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,740
are too ignorant right now for
legalization.

7
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:19,310
Not that people will go out and do some
dangerous things related to drugs,

8
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:23,420
but if you legalize drugs now,
what will happen is that you will have

9
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:27,620
the detractors say things like,
any ills in our society is going to be

10
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:30,020
blamed on a drug.
We are so ignorant.

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:35,290
We're susceptible to believing that.
So before legalization I'm arguing that

12
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,960
we have this increase in education about
what drugs do and don't do,

13
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:43,990
do so people cannot be susceptible to
being hoodwinked like that.

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,900
I'm arguing that the education provides
an inoculation,

15
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:48,734
if you will.

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,960
So you're saying we can handle the truth
essentially.

17
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:55,250
What are you saying is that we need this
decriminalization step before we get to

18
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:56,830
a legalization,
that it's the.

19
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,210
We couldn't just jump right into
legalization.

20
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,850
It will be too much change.
Pandemonium.

21
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,070
People go crazy.
Fear.

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,200
People would use propaganda to set
people against the,

23
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:08,360
you know,
to go against it.

24
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,560
Yeah,
so I'm thinking about,

25
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:12,320
well,
I'm not saying it'll be pandemonium.

26
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,870
We have Washington and Colorado right
now.

27
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,460
Mark my words.
There will be studies coming out of

28
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:24,461
Washington and Colorado showing that
young people in those states do more

29
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:30,500
poorly on whatever measure you want to
have as a result of marijuana.

30
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,160
The studies,
the data won't support that conclusion,

31
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,280
but that's what people are going to be
drawing from those data.

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,610
And so I'm.
This is my prediction right now as a

33
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:45,380
result of people's ignorance about
marijuana and that's that's marijuana.

34
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:49,100
A drug that we have a lot more
experienced in with heroin and,

35
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,260
but mark my words,
you'll see those steps come up

36
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,270
and they religions have a way of
prosecuting psychedelic losers are

37
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,500
losers say users throughout history,
but they would call it the work of the

38
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:06,950
devil and that's what I ran into with
the Mazda text who I was working with up

39
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:08,900
in Wahaca,
is that they had to.

40
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,500
When the Spaniards came,
they had to flee into the hills to

41
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:16,340
continue the mushroom tradition.
And now you'll actually see,

42
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:17,780
um,
I went to San Jose,

43
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:20,300
Delpha Civica,
one town where the mushrooms are readily

44
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:23,450
accessible in this other town,
what La de Jimenez and you'll see on the

45
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:26,660
churches they have Jesus and Mary and
then on the other side they have a

46
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:29,060
mushroom,
so they actually worship the mushrooms.

47
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,220
They've kind of mixed,
I guess to survive.

48
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:35,670
They mixed Catholicism in with their
worship of these mushrooms and um,

49
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,300
it's,
it's pretty trippy per se to see it

50
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:40,080
painted on these churches.
That's actually

51
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,420
a big part of really ancient religious
artwork,

52
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,220
period.
You know,

53
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,850
a lot of,
if you look in,

54
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,220
look up,
do some research on the connection

55
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:49,620
between mushrooms and even the Catholic
Church.

56
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,850
There's mushroom iconography all over
the place and really ancient

57
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:57,690
descriptions like one of the earliest
depictions of Adam and Eve on some

58
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:01,480
ancient fresco is Adam and eve with a
mushroom tree in between them.

59
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,090
Have you ever seen that image?
See if you can pull that up.

60
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:07,360
Jamie,
Adam and eve mushroom picture and we'll

61
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,490
find the description of it.
Uh,

62
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,490
and eve mushroom.
Yeah.

63
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,750
We just lost track of all this stuff.
It's also one of the reasons,

64
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:17,584
yeah,
this is.

65
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,690
It's right away.
You could pull up that image.

66
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,590
It's pretty intense.
That's a.

67
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,800
that's an image of Adam and eve.
I mean,

68
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,643
look at that.

69
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,950
That's crazy.
The mushroom.

70
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,160
That's fucking crazy.
It was really strange for me when I was

71
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:37,720
in Mexico to see them blessing the
mushrooms on the altar a instead of the

72
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:40,780
communion holy water,
they give you mushrooms and that's your

73
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:42,070
sacrament.
That's what you eat.

74
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,210
There's another one,

75
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:43,960
Jamie,
pull up.

76
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,060
There's the other,
another one that's a different image,

77
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,920
but a very,
very similar image.

78
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,780
See that one on the far left.
Far Left.

79
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,650
Yeah,
right there.

80
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,483
Click up that one.

81
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,673
Look at that.

82
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,710
Isn't that trippy?
That's from 1147.

83
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,140
They call it ce now.
They don't call it a d anymore for

84
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:04,840
whatever reason,
but that's from 1147.

85
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,990
So they knew even back then about
psychedelic plants having some sort of a

86
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:13,420
connection to Christianity and these
were,

87
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,950
you know,
these are from churches.

88
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,800
So it's,
um,

89
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,390
it's really fascinating.
That's just something that went away

90
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,930
even before I ever went incident Jujitsu
philosophy.

91
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:25,330
I fought a tough man contest when I was
18 years old.

92
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,040
Mr t was the referee.
I swear to God it was a video that I

93
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,330
have.
Video was on entertainment tonight.

94
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,860
Show a clip of me with a Mohawk.
So you had three guys.

95
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:39,460
I fought all heavyweight day,
day one 75 minutes.

96
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,900
I will have my clothes on.
And I was,

97
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,620
I was,
I was,

98
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,230
I was like,
I was brown that weight by one 75 at

99
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,480
all.
So,

100
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:48,040
uh,
I fought three guys.

101
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,550
I knocked out two guys,
man,

102
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,920
the second guy took.
Dude,

103
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,060
how about that?
Tough man experience was the worst head

104
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,940
trauma than all my fights combined.
How about that?

105
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:58,810
Oh yeah,
yeah,

106
00:04:58,811 --> 00:04:59,644
for sure.
Wow.

107
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,830
I had a concussion like you wouldn't
believe I've never get through to this

108
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,910
day.
You want to get grossed out

109
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,270
in case you didn't hear it at home.

110
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,250
Kids.
Oh my God,

111
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:15,410
that's nothing.
That's my joy.

112
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,090
That goes from the tough was my.
I fought one guy and he was a day.

113
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:22,900
It's funny because they put it,
the two small guys together.

114
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,520
So they put me verse this guy,
he's fucking scarred for life now.

115
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,040
It was me versus this.
Ah,

116
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,343
they,
they,

117
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,060
they announced me as a weight lift in
pizza boy from long island because I

118
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,670
delivered pizzas and my buddy at the
time,

119
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,290
Jim mccluskey,
he was a professional boxer.

120
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,570
Me and him,
we got into a ton of street fights

121
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,520
together.
But uh,

122
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,750
he used the items for the day,
my life.

123
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:47,170
But I used to fight a lot.
He got it looks stand like this,

124
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:49,040
you less of a target as it.
That's why he,

125
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:50,390
that was my lesson.
So,

126
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,850
uh,
so I,

127
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,390
I went in there,
I didn't know what the fuck do you

128
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:53,830
expect?

129
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,770
No head gear,
just these big gloves on that guy who

130
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:57,990
runs it,
whatever his name was.

131
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,911
Beard.
Yeah,

132
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,631
I believe,
I don't know.

133
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:01,310
I guess so.
But uh,

134
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,580
they put me in verse,
this platoon leader from Desert Storm

135
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,020
and this guy,
he's from long island to.

136
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,940
I didn't know.
And uh,

137
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:12,680
I ended up fucking drilled him so I,
I fucking hammered them and they stopped

138
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:13,910
it right away.
That clip.

139
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,160
I can get it.
It was on it.

140
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:16,300
I got it on tape.
I get,

141
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,170
I get,
I can get it to you.

142
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:19,004
I think you'd be.
Want to see it.

143
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,650
It's funny because they showed it on it,
that statement tonight and I'm like,

144
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:22,484
ah,
that's great.

145
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,970
Mary or whoever it is making a face.
But Mr t was the referee.

146
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,020
I thought it was amazing.

147
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:31,160
You're a smart dude because I was just
at this tech conference,

148
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,540
uh,
and we as ceos and this thing and we

149
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:37,700
were talking about it and I,
we got into a fight with one of these

150
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:40,100
big dudes or an old dude,
big powerful guy.

151
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:41,150
And he said,
you know who,

152
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,170
who,
who wouldn't,

153
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,230
jails.
Snowden.

154
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,851
I said,
me,

155
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:47,420
I wouldn't tell them what's the
difference between snowden and Woodward

156
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:50,000
and Bernstein,
Woodward and Bernstein and the

157
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:52,070
presidential papers,
like they were the punks of their

158
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:54,860
generation like,
but now they're heroes because it's the

159
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:58,160
baby boomers and Snowden's fuck you.
It's what's good for the goose is good

160
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:59,510
for the Gander.
Anyway,

161
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:00,850
we got into this fight.
What's he,

162
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,480
what's his argument?
You know,

163
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,840
he was just,
he's bad and has the same argument.

164
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:09,674
No,
he's not,

165
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,460
he's weakened country,
a trader,

166
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,830
I'd kill myself in front of them.

167
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,890
And so and so,
so we got into this fight,

168
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:19,890
but,
but uh,

169
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:22,370
you know,
the interesting thing about that is a,

170
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,380
the fact that a lot of people,
you know,

171
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,390
whistleblowing is seen as eye.
I see it as,

172
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,150
as that's what's going to keep democracy
safe,

173
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,360
but this sort of overreaching and I
said,

174
00:07:35,361 --> 00:07:35,901
look,
you know,

175
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:39,050
I didn't come to America for it to be
able to live in a police state and this

176
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:42,260
is the definition of a police state is
that they could watch everything that we

177
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:45,920
do and that it was all these tech guys
in the tech guys just sort of rolled

178
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:49,040
their eyes and said it's already
happened.

179
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,790
The tech is already there.
The,

180
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,140
the government has already made the
deals.

181
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,720
It's a de facto thing.
You can't change it.

182
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,420
And then,
then I got kind of worried because

183
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,190
you're exactly right.
You're 100 percent right.

184
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,220
The tech is so pervasive that you can't
fuck with it.
