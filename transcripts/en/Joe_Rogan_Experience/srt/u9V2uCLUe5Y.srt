00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Hello Freak bitches on.
People definitely want to fight.

2
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:07,590
I can't live in with fight fighter.
I'm not either.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,390
Some people think that you're supposed
to.

4
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:10,890
That's how a relationship is supposed to
be.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,710
If you're not fighting the years somehow
or another,

6
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:16,500
you don't care about each other because
if you care you get upset.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,780
So very weird sort of dynamic.
The man woman relationship dynamic of

8
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:25,620
things that people think you shouldn't,
shouldn't expect the way people behave

9
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:29,070
or don't behave the way they talk to you
or don't talk to you like it's very,

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,031
you know,
it's weird.

11
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:32,970
It's as if it's all the same.
If any friendship is the same.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,540
Yeah,
don't let,

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,810
don't let people be mean to you.
Don't let them fucking beat you down.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,040
You'll shit at you.
But some people like if you grow up in a

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,320
home that fights all the time,
you get used to that and then you.

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,770
It's not a big deal.
Like she,

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,700
this girl,
would she fight,

18
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,850
scream and yell at him and like as soon
as it was,

19
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,560
it was done,
she'd be fine.

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,920
Just like say I have some coffee and
just sit there and I'd be shaking like,

21
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,970
oh my God,
why did she say like,

22
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,230
I'm not good with that kind of attention
that at all?

23
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,530
Yeah.
I used to date this girl would get

24
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,470
really mad,
really mad and want to fight.

25
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,880
And then once,
once there was some sort of resolution

26
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,680
should immediately turned docile.
It was very odd thought she'd be

27
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:20,400
aggressive to start some sort of
altercation,

28
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,370
but you could calm the altercation down,
shut it down.

29
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,810
But you had an almost shut it down by
just saying or you're not going to do

30
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:29,130
this.
I'm not going to talk like this.

31
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,500
Like this child.
Yeah.

32
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,580
And I was young.
So I had,

33
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:36,270
I needed to learn like how to talk to
people or how to manage situations.

34
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,390
Like sometimes like something's
happening between two people,

35
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:39,810
like,
uh,

36
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,100
you're,
you're upset about something.

37
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,130
And instead of thinking about how you're
conveying your thought to them,

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,140
all you think of is what you want to
happen.

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,960
You know,
I want you to shut the fuck up.

40
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,990
I know.
Even though you want someone to shut the

41
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:00,840
fuck up,
the problem is when you say that you're

42
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:04,440
not really thinking about communicating
with them,

43
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:08,790
like through their eyes wants anyone to
say shut the fuck up,

44
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:12,810
but we say because we want people to
shut the fuck up and you can't deal with

45
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:13,480
it.
I'm not.

46
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,230
Yeah.
Is there a point you don't want?

47
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:18,990
You don't care what their needs are,
you just stop.

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,530
Well,
it's.

49
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,880
Well it's also like when people want
people to do things so they want people

50
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:23,714
that are.
There's,

51
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,210
there's the,
the mindset of you wanting a result.

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,010
You want someone to behave a certain way
instead of thinking about them as like

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,510
your equal.
I can just another human being and

54
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,030
instead of thinking like I have to get
what I want.

55
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,640
Like what is it that you want?
Okay,

56
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,020
what happened here?

57
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,030
Like why are we to pass?
I find like impasse getting older,

58
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,240
that thing that I'm more aware of your.
It's a big part of not thinking about

59
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:57,330
you all the time.
You're always thinking,

60
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:59,190
especially when you're young and you're
like coming up and you're doing.

61
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,490
It's just me,
me,

62
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:00,880
me,
me,

63
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,470
because you're just trying to survive.
You're trying to figure.

64
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:07,300
You don't even know what you want.
When you shut that part down and think

65
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:11,560
about the person across from you.
It opens up the whole world,

66
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,250
but it's a difficult thing to learn when
it's also when you're young,

67
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,990
the camera industry just done.
Just tell other uses.

68
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,310
Last time you saw like a straight up
camera.

69
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,170
Well,
you'd have to be like a guy who was a

70
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:26,290
photographer like Jamie.
Then you carry those goofy bricks

71
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,170
because you want to press checks and you
know what he's doing.

72
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,730
It's just take a picture of the church
all the time.

73
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,200
Just cleared the lighting.
Let me just fix your hair.

74
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,520
Your hair's.
But even that just loved that.

75
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:40,480
They loved to pose.
Sure she did.

76
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,710
They go because I see them all the time.
They just go on like little photo shoot

77
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:46,740
dates with girls too and two,
three,

78
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,181
four,
five,

79
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:49,090
10 times and there's taking pictures of
each other.

80
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,180
They don't need to hire the photographer
anymore.

81
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,020
I've seen that man.
I was at a restaurant in these two

82
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:55,110
bitches.
Just kept doing that back and forth with

83
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,050
each other.
I was like,

84
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:58,120
ladies,
enjoy your meal.

85
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,031
Right?
And they were like,

86
00:03:59,031 --> 00:03:59,601
no,
like this,

87
00:03:59,601 --> 00:04:01,490
like this.
Hold on with phones.

88
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,450
Yeah.
This is the.

89
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,220
I'm about to take a selfie face.
Ready?

90
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:07,310
There's a thing that girls do with their
neck that they only do when they're

91
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:08,540
about to take a selfie.
This is it.

92
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,374
Ready?

93
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,480
Just Dab that weird neck.
Boom.

94
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,270
It's like they're like,
Shit.

95
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,150
This is weird cell phone.
You don't ever do that.

96
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,700
And the other time,
except for when you're looking at your

97
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:29,580
phone,
just trying to sell you nothing is

98
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,200
nothing is more awkward scene.
So someone tried to take a selfie.

99
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,140
You ever seen that mom at the playground
where they're trying to take selfies?

100
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,090
She takes 40 something.
Selfies.

101
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,220
You still like dispatch smile as what
you look like.

102
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,260
Okay.
You just roll with it doesn't always

103
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:44,930
look great.
You don't need to tricking people but

104
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,380
filters
how they do it because this weird

105
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:54,890
chicken movement,
chicken ads,

106
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:57,590
chicken and chicken and that's where it
comes from.

107
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,950
Chickens be crazy.
It's not where it comes from,

108
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:02,470
but it belongs in it.
True.

109
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,770
It's in the same night.
Yeah.

110
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,900
Umbrella.
But that's a real chicken head.

111
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,520
Yeah.
I mean this is really.

112
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,110
This is.
Trust me,

113
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:11,040
I've chickens.
This is the fucking chicken.

114
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,490
This is.
That's what they do,

115
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:15,620
man.
There's nothing more awkward seeing

116
00:05:15,621 --> 00:05:17,840
someone's trying to take fucking
selfies.

117
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,990
So embarrassing.
This is definitely more awkward.

118
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:23,270
Shit.
It's more awkward if your friend is

119
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:26,150
taking and you're a guy.
You're standing there like,

120
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:27,050
hold up bro.
Hold on Bro.

121
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,460
Oh my God.
Hold on Bro.

122
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,660
Hold on Bro.
Like this.

123
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,480
It's so weird.
What do you think?

124
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,550
Like this year was okay and she kicked
you out,

125
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,060
Bro.
Your guy and you're poking your ass out.

126
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,340
Okay.
How many guys take pictures?

127
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:45,341
Like the hero?
I'm going to look mysterious.

128
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,970
Thinking about this book.
I'm writing

129
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,850
as out
so awkward.

130
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:53,240
Man.
