1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,800
Freak bitches,
like my friend Remy,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:08,580
Remy Warren was in New Zealand and a
used one of those and like wrote in the

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:09,360
log,
you know,

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,630
where he was from when he was there.
And I guess it also,

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,940
it helps identify if people are missing.

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:16,461
Exactly,
yeah.

7
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:19,580
I think it's a safety precaution.
So if you can kind of track down where

8
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:21,290
it was the last person seen,
you know,

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,060
or wherever they last seen.
So if they were,

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,300
if they logged into a shelter and then,
you know,

11
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,470
they can't find them,
they can say okay,

12
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:31,550
on this date we know that they were here
so you can give a given radius and know

13
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:34,940
that if they are missing their within at
least within a certain,

14
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:36,950
you know,
20 miles in distance walking distance of

15
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:37,970
their.
But yeah.

16
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:41,120
And I think those things actually turned
into like a just fun.

17
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:43,930
You know,
some people just go write full on poems

18
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:44,764
in there,
some,

19
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,680
you know,
confess like life stories and they're

20
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,250
like,
Oh God,

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,000
yeah.
The trail log books are entertaining the

22
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:53,740
doubt.

23
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,880
Wow.
Here,

24
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:56,080
warning,
what does it say?

25
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,110
Harassing Baron Camp Night of 5:11 swipe
clause in two tents.

26
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,070
Stepped on my tent.
Tila collapsed on me.

27
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:11,071
Please be careful he didn't even try to
get the food hanging low on a branch

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,221
here.
Oh,

29
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:14,090
look at her name.
Flower.

30
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,980
Passion flower with a sad face and
there's another one.

31
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:19,240
Bear rip.
This is a different.

32
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,850
This is a different person's
handwriting.

33
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,410
Bear ripped the bag hanging on my pack,
which was hanging on my hammock.

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,500
I was Muslim.
Say Bullshit.

35
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,920
Bouncing,
bouncing up and down.

36
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,830
He stole my toilet paper.
Exclamation point.

37
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,630
What does that say?
Subway.

38
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,370
That's his name.
Subway.

39
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,330
Eat fresh.

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,460
Yeah.
Ps,

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,320
the Pivi is great.
What's a pivot?

42
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,360
Are Pretty.
It's the a privilege.

43
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,360
It's just like an outhouse.
Oh,

44
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,510
okay.
Compost.

45
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:48,960
Toilet.

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,550
How about this one?
Dat Shit.

47
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,760
Cray all balls.
Ghetto savior.

48
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,623
Baltimore.

49
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,210
What?

50
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,810
All balls?
Ghetto savior.

51
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,850
Baltimore.
Okay.

52
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,960
Okay.
Well you're dealing with like fringe

53
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:12,650
people,
right?

54
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:17,060
I mean these are people that are just
not fitting into the corporate module.

55
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,610
I don't what what you're talking about
with the New York Times and I don't

56
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:22,320
really.
I'm not going to step out and take a

57
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,560
view on it,
but what,

58
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,630
what I believe you're saying with the
times is that they were pro Clinton and

59
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:30,780
anti trump.
That's different from having a position

60
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:31,614
on climate change.

61
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,631
Well,
it's not.

62
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:33,464
Well,
no,

63
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,460
because they have a position on just
just take the Lens as climate change.

64
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,960
You have one candidate who is denying
the reality of climate change.

65
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:42,351
Where?
Who's,

66
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:47,351
who's just claiming that the Chinese
trump?

67
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,651
Well,
no,

68
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:52,130
because it won't because when trump says
climate change is a Chinese hoax,

69
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,120
you have to call him.
Here we go.

70
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,100
He said it's a Chinese hoax.
He should go to China and see those

71
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:03,220
people that are walking around with gas
masks on because they can't breathe in

72
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:03,881
Beijing.
Okay.

73
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:04,620
But that's,
I mean that's,

74
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,720
that's the pollution,
right?

75
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,900
Which I think is actually much stronger
because that's just.

76
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,220
You can't go to Beijing and say this is
how we want the air to be.

77
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,720
Right.
But I think something like 20,

78
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,780
I think something like 25 percent of the
air pollution in California on some days

79
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,430
is coming from China.

80
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,430
Maybe there's some amazing pr.
I could have that slightly wrong.

81
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:28,780
Jamie can check that out,
but please do.

82
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:30,490
There's some,
there's some extraordinary amount of

83
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,160
Arab air pollution that we get from
China.

84
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,780
That's insane.
I did not know that.

85
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,160
It makes its way across the ocean.
Yeah.

86
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:37,994
Oh yeah,
it does.

87
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,120
There's no wall build that wall,
but.

88
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:44,500
No,
but at a certain point,

89
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:47,560
I mean there's some,
there's some level of dishonesty and

90
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,610
misinformation that's so egregious that
if you're a journalist coming at all

91
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:56,611
committed to being an unbiased or
disinterested broker of information and

92
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,980
a conversation,
if you set up a conversation between,

93
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,930
you know,
the Sean Spicer's of the world or the

94
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,180
Kellyanne Conway's who were,
have their alternative facts and someone

95
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:10,030
who's honestly talking about whatever it
is,

96
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:11,540
climate change,
um,

97
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,230
it's very,
you know,

98
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:15,190
you can't split that up

99
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,020
baby,
but I don't think you have to create

100
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,590
mock unnecessary debates around climate
change.

101
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:23,660
What I do think is that,
uh,

102
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,420
with the trump administration,
uh,

103
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:31,421
that it is imperative for journal that
journalists a call out when things are

104
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:36,290
said that aren't true,
but I don't think it's constructive for

105
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:41,291
mainstream journalistic organizations to
have an openly hostile anti-trump

106
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,930
attitude or pro somebody else attitude
because then you lead that just leads to

107
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:50,030
further polarization,
but when you exactly what we don't need,

108
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,520
but you call them out on all the times
that he said things that were just

109
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:55,220
absolutely not true.
That's like your anti trump.

110
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,083
Yes,
it can.

111
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,620
There's no question.
There's no question.

112
00:04:57,621 --> 00:04:58,850
And uh,
and I think that's,

113
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:00,660
uh,
an issue we're dealing with and I,

114
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,700
but I think this is a time of real soul
searching in my industry because I,

115
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,420
I firmly believe there is a very
powerful place in a functioning

116
00:05:11,421 --> 00:05:13,580
democracy for a press,
for,

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,210
for media that people generally view as
fair.

118
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,510
I don't know how they do it,
but they figured out how to splice

119
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:24,511
things and change things and selectively
breed certain plants and they came up

120
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:28,330
with different strains.
That's why corn looks the way it looks.

121
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,870
Old school corn was like the size of a
Hobos Dick,

122
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:35,060
and it was so naughty and fucked up
look,

123
00:05:35,061 --> 00:05:37,300
and it was like four inches long.
So it's a little tiny thing.

124
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,640
It tastes the same.
No,

125
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,481
I mean it's uh,
hobos.

126
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:41,230
Dick.
No.

127
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,610
Hobos dicks are weird,
man.

128
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,140
They're so variable.
You never know what you get.

129
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:48,970
And it could be a recent Hobo and be
like,

130
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:51,940
that guy who punched you.
Just old school snot blowing.

131
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:54,670
Veteran Dick.
Tastes like battery acid.

132
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,880
Those addict.
That's through the Pacific southwest

133
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,460
for guys just doing north northwell.
Danny comes in your mouth.

134
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,550
What do you think that to say that like,
oh,

135
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:07,580
guide drinks.
Orange juice has come taste better.

136
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:08,930
Have you heard that?
Yeah.

137
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,160
Whenever I heard that,
I was like,

138
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,440
how many dicks do you have to suck for
you figure that out.

139
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:17,730
You can get away from me.
Do you hold this fucking scientists?

140
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,210
He's sucking Dick with a lab coat on.
Taking notes,

141
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,700
asparagus.
Not recommended.

142
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,110
Switching it around in your mouth.
Like you're a wine connoisseur,

143
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,010
right?
If a guy eats pineapples,

144
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:35,990
if a guy eats pineapples,
is cum tastes better.

145
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,970
Right?
But conversely,

146
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,560
if you're just doing nothing but smoking
meth,

147
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,530
your loads have to taste like hot death.
Yeah.

148
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,230
And it does.
And it's fucking lumpy.

149
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,220
Pesticide loads.
Tastes like roundup.

150
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,040
It's not good when you have to kill it.
It's not much either.

151
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:03,041
It's like a fucking Hershey's kiss.
No

152
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,270
mother fucker
didn't.

153
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,690
She's immediately tripping on meth.
She's out of her mind.

154
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,950
By the time they came back then they
were different enough from coyotes that

155
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,550
they not only couldn't interbreed with
them anymore,

156
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,870
but they sort of are mortal enemies of
one another.

157
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,970
I mean,
when we reintroduced wolves to

158
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:37,971
yellowstone in 1995,
coyotes had had 75 years and yellowstone

159
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:40,010
without any wolves.
I mean.

160
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:44,760
And that served as a wonderful
laboratory to study them too because it

161
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,890
gave us a sense of what happens with
coyotes when nobody is harassing them

162
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,070
when people aren't harassing him,
which of course we didn't.

163
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,980
And Yellowstone Park and when wolves
aren't harassing them either.

164
00:07:55,981 --> 00:08:00,810
And what we realize is that they create
these really stable territory's.

165
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,910
They create very stable packs and their
population rises to a particular point.

166
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:09,300
The carrying capacity of the landscape
based on what they eat,

167
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:14,301
which is mostly rodents and rabbits and
things and some fruit and berries,

168
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,610
but it doesn't,
they don't,

169
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,710
their populations sort of levels off and
stays at a carrying capacity.

170
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,220
And so we got to watch that happen in
yellowstone for like 75 years and it's

171
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:34,161
become sort of the,
the example of what would happen if we

172
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:36,750
just left them alone.
I mean,

173
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:37,620
some people think,
well,

174
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:39,830
if we don't try to control them,
how they're gonna,

175
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,810
you know,
they're just going to be millions upon

176
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,020
millions of them running everywhere,
but that's actually,

177
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,190
they only do that when you try to
persecute them and they go into this

178
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:54,450
colonization mode and generate more and
more and more pups and have more and

179
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:58,440
more pups survive.
So yellowstone in that period from 19,

180
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:03,441
25 to 1995 was this sort of model of
what happens when you just leave them

181
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,280
the hell alone and they just kind of
rise to a particular population level

182
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:15,740
and are really stable at that level.
And uh,

183
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,220
and don't really go beyond it.
