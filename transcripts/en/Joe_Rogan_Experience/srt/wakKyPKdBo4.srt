1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,960
Her low freak bitches.
Hey y'all.

2
00:00:03,961 --> 00:00:05,580
I got a white hat on because I'm a good
guy.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,740
You want me to do it?
The black hat now you want me to do,

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,950
I'm the lack of a white hat sort of a
guy according to my record label.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,430
So the Jeremy Pivot down there at yelp.
Oh,

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,130
does he have a glass in his hand or his?
No,

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,060
that's something.
Just know they changed outfits.

8
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:20,190
There was a makeup lady,
you know what I mean?

9
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:22,170
It's just cute for Sutherland.
Oh,

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,800
what's this?
No Cigar.

11
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:26,430
Cute.
There's no fucking cigar.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,500
Yeah,
him and Deniro.

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,680
Hey.
Hey.

14
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:31,530
What the fuck is this Kiefer?
Listen,

15
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,390
Pussy.
You're scared to pull it off.

16
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,790
Look at Kramer James Bond.
No.

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,420
Sukar go into a Kramer's over,
by the way,

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,250
Best James Bond by far,
right?

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,750
Daniel Craig.
No one's even close.

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,740
Yeah,
he's the coolest.

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,300
Oh,
Kramer Kramer.

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,310
It's lovable.

23
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:49,920
You know he's thinking when he's holding
that cigar.

24
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,380
I love black people.
Yes.

25
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,110
He's thinking he's thinking of saving.
That word rhymes with bigger

26
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,670
Danny Devito.
He's got something going on.

27
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,230
What is he doing?
He's lighting it.

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,960
Manny too many takes there.
I know there was more than one take on

29
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:12,720
it.
I can pull it off.

30
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,440
It's dead on the inside.
I don't care.

31
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:19,500
This is good for publicity.
This is good for my image.

32
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,490
When I smoke as their God gives you the
feeling of prosperity.

33
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,870
I live in a mansion in the palisades and
I fucked my maid Dai

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,190
gum inside them or don't give your woman
with me.

35
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:40,191
I come inside her as well.
That's why his cover works.

36
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,660
Adrian Brody,
I'm just sitting here wondering what

37
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:47,700
happened.
You're right,

38
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,130
arnold is the perfect person that sees
to investors to loan.

39
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:56,040
Seems fairly candid photos but I'm
worried there was too many takes.

40
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,180
I'm worried they took several takes.
Now you spitting into that thing.

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,880
What's going on here?
We got mom drinking Copenhagen.

42
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,320
What does that shit?
Yeah,

43
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,570
Copenhagen.
What's the deal with that?

44
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,270
Explain that to me.
What does that do for you?

45
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,240
I've never been involved.
I have no experience in this.

46
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,210
I chewed tobacco once when I was a kid
cause I read huckleberry Finn,

47
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,870
they give you,
they give you a head high threw up.

48
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,740
I started extra salivating and I felt
like shit,

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,070
I don't know.
It was it good.

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,970
I like it.
I'm gonna try something that give it a

51
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:31,650
go.
What do you do with it?

52
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,290
Take a little bump.
Put under your lip bump.

53
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,900
A little pinch,
like a cocaine style bump.

54
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,700
Now we've never done that either.
I'd go less is less than what you asked

55
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:42,300
plenty for you.
Is that too much?

56
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,230
That's good.
Okay.

57
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,600
Where do you put it?
Anywhere you put any love you want.

58
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,960
Okay.
Yeah.

59
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,370
It's going to start to burn a little bit
bigger cancer immediately.

60
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,560
I don't think so.
I mean,

61
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,160
now you shouldn't.
That doesn't taste bad.

62
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,170
No,
it's like wintergreen done.

63
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,520
It's been the right one because you do
not,

64
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,500
I repeat.
Do not want to drink juice.

65
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:04,780
Spit.
That is a fucking day gone bad.

66
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,320
Well,
one of the guys who worked in UFC who

67
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,154
was a,
uh,

68
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,850
Jamie's laughing cause of chewing,
it looks ridiculous.

69
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,420
Why does it look ridiculous?
You're going to get a supervisee high.

70
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,340
It's gonna be great.
I get messages every day from people

71
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:20,590
that lost a hundred pounds right there
feeling healthy.

72
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,550
The problem is we're dealing with
propaganda and you can do one or two

73
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:26,380
things.
You could either just say,

74
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:27,580
well,
you know,

75
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:28,420
this is this,
this,

76
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,320
I think I swallowed all that tobacco.
Yeah.

77
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:34,060
It's all gone.
Oh yeah.

78
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,820
I was wondering why I'm so high.
You got Tobacco on it.

79
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,050
It's gone.
I don't have it.

80
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,450
Yeah.
Swallowed up.

81
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,220
I had a boy,
I don't know what I'm doing.

82
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,150
All right too.
And drank and swat.

83
00:03:47,151 --> 00:03:49,910
Right.
So he makes a ton of videos and puts

84
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:51,890
them on instagram.
Chris Brown.

85
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,310
Yeah.
Of Him given his side of what things are

86
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,410
and then he's,
he's keeping it real essentially.

87
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,740
Yeah.
It videos and it's his,

88
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,170
and he's smoking a cigarette.
It's very sketch.

89
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,440
So they didn't hold on him.
They arrested him and then the fuck out

90
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:07,274
of them.
Yeah.

91
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,510
Uh,
I don't know if they kept them,

92
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:14,050
but I mean they went in and they booked
him for assault with a deadly weapon or

93
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:16,460
attempted assault with a deadly weapon.
Is that what it is?

94
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,700
How long until he's saying that the cops
were roughing him up.

95
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,580
I'm sure they have video footage of
everything.

96
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,530
They wouldn't be crazy.
It'd be crazy not to.

97
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,840
Yeah,
something like that.

98
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,160
Like Chris Brown,
like fuck is under age cousin and then

99
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:32,540
piss on somebody.
No,

100
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:36,080
that was our Kelly.
You can find like three different black

101
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:39,190
people.
I don't know who fuck their cousin Kelly

102
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,790
was peanut people didn't he used to put
with this lately and molest them?

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,810
No,
that's the other guy.

104
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,250
That's bill cosby.
Oh,

105
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,650
got it.
Jesus Christ.

106
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,550
And that crazy like,
what the fuck man,

107
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,360
I can't tell black people heart and just
realize that you confused r Kelly and

108
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,440
Chris Brown is that bad.
And they close.

109
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,210
They're off by like 15,
20 years.

110
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:13,060
What if one of them is our age?
Our Kelly is our eyes.

111
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,590
He's 49.
And when did he play basketball?

112
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,540
He didn't play basketball.
He's a singer.

113
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,100
A singer.
Got It.

114
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,510
Yeah.
Um,

115
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,130
I don't know any of his songs other than
the really hilarious ones.

116
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:32,840
Okay.
