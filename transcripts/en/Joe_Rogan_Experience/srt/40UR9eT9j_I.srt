1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,940
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,720
And I became aware of you specifically
because of your interview with my crazy

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:07,740
friend Alex Jones.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,701
Oh yeah.

5
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:09,061
Alex.

6
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:09,900
I love Alex Jones.

7
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,280
Alex was great.

8
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,660
He had me on to talk about,

9
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,570
I mean this is a topic
I'm discussing that is,

10
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,130
is difficult to get people to have you
on to talk about it because they not Alex

11
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:20,550
though.

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,911
No,

13
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:21,744
not

14
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:22,723
site.

15
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,180
We found more corruption.

16
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,270
I can't believe this is
the insanity of it all.

17
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,810
You have to love his passion.

18
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,700
He's a good friend of mine.

19
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,540
I love him.

20
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:31,751
Yeah,

21
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:32,980
he is so passionate.

22
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,780
And when you follow your passion,

23
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:35,680
successful following,

24
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:36,491
that's happened with,

25
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:37,324
with Alex.

26
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,660
He's so passionate that
people think it's fake.

27
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,920
They think that the like,

28
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:43,650
he's like some sort of a
CIA plant and he's like,

29
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,250
you know,

30
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,510
living this lie of,

31
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,410
you know,

32
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,450
it's like the idea of putting up,

33
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,880
I almost wish it was fake
that because like I feel,

34
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,470
I always tell them every
time I hang out with them,

35
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,100
like you stress me out
or just stress like,

36
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:56,250
like I feel bad for him.

37
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:57,330
Like he can't calm down.

38
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:57,900
He's always,

39
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,051
yeah,

40
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,640
he's intense when he's eating hot dogs.

41
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:00,990
I mean,

42
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,380
need another all fucking hot dog man.

43
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,750
Where's she going with those hot dogs?

44
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:04,500
Yeah,

45
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,001
he was,

46
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:05,700
uh,

47
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,900
we came with us to the UFC

48
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,470
great time with that guy.

49
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:09,100
He was fun.

50
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,311
Dude,

51
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:09,881
I have to tell you,

52
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:11,560
after interviewing with him for an hour,

53
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:11,751
he,

54
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:12,610
he's genuine,

55
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,300
genuinely cares about the direction this
country is going in and he's willing to

56
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:17,290
put his neck out on the line.

57
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:17,530
Yeah.

58
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,363
Just like you,

59
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,151
you do Joe.

60
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:19,984
And uh,

61
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,310
and,

62
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,760
and that's admirable because you're,

63
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:24,010
you're seeing a lot of people
just kind of shut up right now.

64
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,610
Yeah.

65
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,510
It takes the real heroes to really come
forward and talk about everything that's

66
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:29,800
going on or crazy.

67
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,420
That's when people are
freaking out of your mind.

68
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,263
Are you nuts

69
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,980
for folks who don't know the story,

70
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,760
the story that I got from
the Alex Jones show is,

71
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,420
and this is a subject that I had been
really curious about why this wasn't

72
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:46,310
receiving any mainstream coverage.

73
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:47,960
When we would see all this coverage,

74
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:51,980
what was going on in Syria and all this
coverage is going on in Egypt and in

75
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:52,730
Libya.

76
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,101
But no,

77
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:54,770
we never saw anything on Bahrain.

78
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,671
And uh,

79
00:01:55,671 --> 00:02:00,671
I saw some horrific videos that I
found online of just the military

80
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:02,530
assassinating dissent,

81
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,130
uh,

82
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,480
assassinating a different
people that were protesting.

83
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,141
And you,

84
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:07,070
you look at the video and you like,

85
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:08,750
how is this not huge?

86
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:11,300
How was this not all
over the news every day?

87
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:11,720
How was,

88
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,520
how were we not,

89
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:12,800
you know,

90
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,330
imposing sanctions on his country?

91
00:02:14,331 --> 00:02:15,090
How are we not,

92
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,470
you know,

93
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,390
speaking out against this
horrific show of just,

94
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,310
it was just horrifying to watch,

95
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,600
but it was weird how silent the
mainstream news was about it.

96
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:29,270
It was like there was nothing
and you ran into this.

97
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,363
Oh yeah.

98
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,900
I didn't only run into it,

99
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,030
I was knocked over by it and run over.

100
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:34,740
No.

101
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,270
Okay.

102
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,240
They just hire you thinking
you're a beautiful woman.

103
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,060
You just want to be like a model who's
going to read the news and you're just

104
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:42,020
going to shut the fuck up.

105
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,080
I think so.

106
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,570
And unfortunately I'm Greek
and I'm a Scorpio and attorney.

107
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,460
Yeah.

108
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,293
Is that good?

109
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,500
That's dangerous.

110
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,483
Super Dangerous.

111
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,581
I don't think they,

112
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:56,030
I really don't think that they knew I
wasn't just a talking head puppet when I

113
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:56,541
was hired.

114
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:59,410
I was actually hired by someone
who ended up leaving the network.

115
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,303
Um,

116
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,300
and uh,

117
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:01,930
and so,

118
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,520
so I think they were surprised.

119
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,290
Uh,

120
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,080
I fucked up.

121
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,360
They didn't see it coming

122
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,321
in 10 years.

123
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,590
If people go back and
evaluate the situation though,

124
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,570
they thought you were going to be a female
Ryan Seacrest and just run with this.

125
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:14,931
Well,

126
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:16,130
there's a weird trend,

127
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,540
especially in Fox News,

128
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,730
these gorgeous women reading the news.

129
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,301
I'm like,

130
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:23,600
that is such a sneaky trick because
especially if you're a guy who can't get

131
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:24,110
laid,

132
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,300
like having a beautiful
woman talk about anything,

133
00:03:26,301 --> 00:03:27,710
it's like I just want to hear her talk.

134
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,180
I just want to just tell him.

135
00:03:29,181 --> 00:03:30,014
He would tell him what's going on.

136
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,220
And so like what better way to program
people for your right wing agenda then

137
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:35,870
have like the hottest
chicks in the planet.

138
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,610
Tell you what's wrong with the left

139
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,730
and then also have them say
weapons of mass destruction.

140
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,290
Whoa.

141
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:44,750
Damn.

142
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,710
And it worked.

143
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,131
You know,

144
00:03:46,131 --> 00:03:50,210
obviously we ended up in
Iraq and Afghanistan and
they're continuing to bleed

145
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,220
the hot chips.

146
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,280
Propaganda is strong for sure.

147
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,260
Well tell us your experience cause you,

148
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,490
you know better than anyone.

149
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:58,810
You were working on CNN.

150
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,790
I saw some of the other
stuff that you did.

151
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,840
That was amazing though.

152
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:06,040
Especially the theme of the piece on
the child prostitutes in Las Vegas.

153
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,350
So you watched that.

154
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:08,650
It was hard.

155
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,120
I felt for that mom.

156
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:13,510
It was so horrible seeing
that mom holding one baby,

157
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,100
talking about her other baby who's
now 13 and is just running around as a

158
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:18,581
prostitute.

159
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:19,361
It was insane.

160
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:20,530
It was insane to watch.

161
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,250
So I know you did serious
work for them and that's like,

162
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,490
that was some really deep
shit and it was a long piece.

163
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,040
What is it like to,

164
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:35,070
to go from that to just running into
this wall and this one particular subject

165
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,170
that set you off this Bahrain issue.

166
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,490
Like what was that like?

167
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,240
It works well for me it
was really disturbing.

168
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,160
I was,

169
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,993
it was

170
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,290
horrific because I knew these people in
Bahrain were being tortured and abused

171
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,220
and um,

172
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,330
and systematically killed and
doctors can be killing doctors.

173
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,450
Doctors are taking care
of people who protested,

174
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,150
who got shot for the,

175
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,420
for treating these people.

176
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:01,290
They got tortured.

177
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,630
Yeah,

178
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,460
they got tortured.

179
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,570
Some of them are still in jail.

180
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:05,190
These are genuinely good people.

181
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:07,500
A ambulance drivers were beat journalists.

182
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:07,831
Uh,

183
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:08,790
one was arrested,

184
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,470
his body showed up a couple of days later,

185
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:11,640
just full of,

186
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,750
of torture marks.

187
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:13,260
And,

188
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,560
and what really bothered me is because
I grew up in the Midwest and I know how

189
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:20,580
the American people get taken advantage
of and our tax dollars are going to this

190
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:22,650
bar brain regime to support them.

191
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:24,720
And they're the ones doing
this to their people.

192
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,460
How much money do we send to Bahrain?

193
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,770
Every year we send a,

194
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:29,020
we,

195
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,450
I don't know the exact amount of money,

196
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:33,330
but I know that we send more than
a billion dollars worth of weapons.

197
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:35,410
We've given them more than a
billion dollars worth of a weapons.

198
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:36,570
They're using some of these weapons,

199
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:40,200
some of this tear gas that they're using
to systematically gas their people,

200
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,310
which they are doing.

201
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,740
They're taking weapons that
they're allowed to use,

202
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:45,150
which is tear gas and bird shot.

203
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:47,550
And instead of using
those for crowd control,

204
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:51,180
they're using those to systematically
kill their people and gas them.

205
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:54,030
And this is being made in
Pennsylvania with tear gas.

206
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,450
Yeah,

207
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,880
they're there because
it's you and approve.

208
00:05:56,881 --> 00:06:00,380
So literally dropping tear gas on
these villages every single day,

209
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:01,430
all day long and night.

210
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,810
And Physicians for Human Rights and Nobel
Peace Prize winning organization has

211
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:08,630
been trying to raise hell
about this because it's,

212
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:10,340
it's tearing up these people's lungs.

213
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:12,020
People who are as Madec are dying,

214
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,250
elderly are dying,

215
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:17,150
they're suffocating in their homes and
they're misusing this gas and it's a very

216
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:18,740
systematic way that they're doing it.

217
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,030
People are having miscarriages,

218
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:20,864
women,

219
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,201
um,

220
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:23,600
some of these doctors are now
connecting it to the tear gas.

221
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,280
Uh,

222
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,561
so,

223
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:28,580
so this is something that needs to be
talked about urgently because these people

224
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,780
as I speak right now,

225
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,360
they're,

226
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,220
they're being guests.

227
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,400
How many people have
died from this so far?

228
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,570
Uh,

229
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,300
so far they don't know it because
they can't a hundred percent,

230
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:37,671
uh,

231
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:38,021
you know,

232
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:39,550
say you were gassed in
a couple of days later,

233
00:06:39,551 --> 00:06:41,530
you die because you have
a respiratory issues.

234
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:44,170
You can't 100% connected to the gas,

235
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,010
but so far more than a couple
dozen people have been killed

236
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,610
and they just continually do this.

237
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,320
You continually all day long.

238
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,460
Yeah.

239
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,870
And I think it's a way,

240
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,590
it's a way that they're trying to suppress
the protests also a way that they're

241
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:58,550
trying to,

242
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,030
uh,

243
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,680
to silence the opposition and get people
in these and these neighborhoods to

244
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,250
convince the youth to quit protesting
because they keep getting gassed.

245
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:07,820
His,

246
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,720
as a result of it.

247
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,740
What is our business there?

248
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,170
What is our business with Paul
Ryan that we support them?

249
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,471
Well,

250
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:14,940
this means everything to us right now.

251
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:15,840
And a lot of people will say,

252
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:16,081
okay,

253
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:17,670
Bahrain is so far away.

254
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:18,690
What does it matter to me?

255
00:07:18,691 --> 00:07:21,600
I always explain this to my sister
because she's in that mindset.

256
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:23,460
She doesn't really know about
the politics in the region.

257
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,351
Well we,

258
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:27,630
we keep hearing more and more about
Iran and a potential war with Iran.

259
00:07:27,631 --> 00:07:28,920
So we need,

260
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:31,040
we have a navy base in Bahrain,

261
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,470
in Bahrain is right across a,

262
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,040
there's a body of water
separating bufferin and Iran.

263
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,650
So we need that naval base if we're
going to go in and eventually attack you,

264
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:39,001
Ron.

265
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:43,050
It's very strategic for the u s that's
why we have buffering as an ally.

266
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,770
Um,

267
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,390
and so this situation is a situation where
the u s is giving Bob Crane money and

268
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:52,200
keeping our base there and allowing
these atrocities to happen because of a

269
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:53,880
potential war with Iran.

270
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:54,151
So,

271
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:57,300
so your tax dollars are going
directly to this regime.

272
00:07:57,301 --> 00:07:58,134
Not only that,

273
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,860
covering up the story
further gets us into some,

274
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:01,981
uh,

275
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:06,570
potential conflict with Iran
because you're not knowing.

276
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,540
We're demonizing people
who we want to attack.

277
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,041
And then we're,

278
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,940
we're praising people who
we want to keep as our,

279
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:12,803
as our allies,

280
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,590
who we really should
probably should be attacking.

281
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,590
Exactly.

282
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,370
If people knew we wanted to
stop atrocities in the world,

283
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:19,640
you wouldn't be looking at a run.

284
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,700
You'd be looking at fucking ball ranch.

285
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,431
Exactly.

286
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:22,641
You know,

287
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:23,990
we were detained violently there.

288
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:24,950
We were thrown on the ground.

289
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:28,400
We had machine guns pointed at our
heads and they tried to erase all of our

290
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:29,180
video.

291
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,350
Uh,

292
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,280
and this was about 10 a 10 minutes
drive from the naval base worth.

293
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:36,800
15,000 Americans are living and um,

294
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,311
you know,

295
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:38,330
and they tried to,

296
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:38,780
uh,

297
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,890
to bury the story.

298
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:40,481
But,

299
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:43,340
but fortunately I was with
another female producer.

300
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:44,450
We were able to hide these,

301
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,520
these media discs actually in our,

302
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,620
in our bras during the detainment.

303
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,263
Yeah.

304
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,290
Um,

305
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,250
now that I look back on it,

306
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:53,084
it's kind of funny,

307
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,170
but at the time we were
very worried about that.

308
00:08:55,171 --> 00:08:58,380
The discs falling out is you're laying
on the ground and you have a gun pointed

309
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:00,510
at your head and erasing your video.

310
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:02,850
You don't want that just
to drop out on the floor.

311
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:03,630
What do you say to them?

312
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,081
Oops.

313
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:04,750
I don't know.

314
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,583
I came from,

315
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,600
none of my tits

316
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,383
actually got,

317
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,220
uh,

318
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,340
so it was a,

319
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,140
it was a situation that
was just pretty eyeopening.

320
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,891
That's intense.

321
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:17,970
And you tried to go back.

322
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,541
Oh,

323
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:18,780
I've,

324
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,770
I've tried many times.

325
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:20,640
They won't let me back.

326
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,470
You go back after that because you
find a connection to this story as a

327
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:27,390
journalist when you know
something's happening,

328
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,990
um,

329
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,170
I,

330
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:28,411
he,

331
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:29,244
you're crazy.

332
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,953
In other words,

333
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,120
no,

334
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,930
the people are really good people.

335
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,771
When you meet them,

336
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:35,270
you,

337
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,390
you just remember them.

338
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:36,960
You,

339
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,720
you hold a,

340
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:37,930
uh,

341
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,720
a big place in your heart for them and,

342
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,950
and for,

343
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:41,760
um,

344
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,290
for their survival and,

345
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,030
and you feel duty to tell their story.

346
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,450
What is it about the Middle East
that makes these crazy dictators?

347
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,901
I mean,

348
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:51,990
that's really the last place in the
world were due to still rocking it.

349
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:56,880
Old School like that where there's
like a king running a whole country.

350
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,320
There's only the Middle East.

351
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,830
And it's really fascinating when you look
at human history and you find out that

352
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:03,630
that's where the original civilization,

353
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:05,490
the oldest known
civilization as soon mirror,

354
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,740
that's where Iraq is.

355
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,311
So like,

356
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:09,210
so those people that are,

357
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:11,280
they're essentially the
townies of the world.

358
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,670
It's like people in the Middle
East are like these dictators.

359
00:10:14,671 --> 00:10:17,940
I mean they really are running things
the way they did thousands of years ago.

360
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:19,590
They have never had to evolve.

361
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,710
They've never had to move on
like the rest of the world has.

362
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,850
So I don't think we can even wrap our
heads around the idea of kings in this

363
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:27,271
country.

364
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:28,350
It's like it seems,

365
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:32,340
even though as our police state clamps
down on our rights starts slipping away

366
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,220
every day with the more of
these insane bills at pass,

367
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,390
I still don't think we understand what
it would be like to be under the rule of

368
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:42,890
Saddam Hussein and having his
Uday Day and whatever the,

369
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:45,570
his other sons name this
crazy evil psychopaths,

370
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:48,030
sons running around
torturing and killing people.

371
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,500
I don't think we can even understand that.

372
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,480
I think that's almost
outside of our range.

373
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,520
So as long as something like this
about rain isn't reported on,

374
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:57,690
it's not talked about in the news.

375
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:58,920
We don't have to focus on it.

376
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,370
We don't,

377
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,150
we don't really,

378
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,983
it doesn't,

379
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,490
it doesn't register with us

380
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:02,911
and,

381
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:04,360
and we're keeping them in power.

382
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:06,070
We're keeping these dictators in power.

383
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:08,020
So that's another thing
that I don't think,

384
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:08,770
um,

385
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,603
our,

386
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,270
our current government wants us to discuss
because they don't want the people to

387
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:15,280
be outraged and make us leave.

388
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,700
And they don't want this protest to
succeed because if the protest succeed,

389
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,950
these protesters are
going to kick the u s out.

390
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:21,611
I mean,

391
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:25,720
the u s has a aided this regime and,

392
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,820
and oppressing them for decades and,

393
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,631
and so,

394
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:34,030
so that's another reason the US doesn't
want this reported on in the mainstream

395
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:34,864
news.

396
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,700
Wow.

397
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,200
It's so crazy because I guess the idea
is by not have taking military action

398
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,160
against someone like that,

399
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,030
you're,

400
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,580
you know,

401
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:42,890
what,

402
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,870
what are you just turning a
blind eye to it or what do you,

403
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,081
I mean,

404
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:46,501
how do you,

405
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:47,970
how do you continue to,

406
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,330
how did you know,

407
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,310
send them weapons?

408
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,600
How's that possible?

409
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,853
It seems,

410
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,820
it just seems unconscionable.

411
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:55,400
It seems like a,

412
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,350
at a certain point in time,

413
00:11:56,351 --> 00:12:00,340
someone has to cross some
line somewhere and just go,

414
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:00,551
what,

415
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:00,851
what are,

416
00:12:00,851 --> 00:12:02,230
what exactly are we doing?

417
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:06,220
Like is it really that important to go
into Iran that were allowing this country

418
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:06,971
to run like this?

419
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:07,610
Like what,

420
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:07,910
what,

421
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,160
why are we supporting this?

422
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,510
Like what are we doing as a country?

423
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:12,730
Are we completely about dollar bills now?

424
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,180
Is it just about
controlling oil ports and,

425
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:15,511
and,

426
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:15,791
and,

427
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:16,720
and pathways?

428
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:16,871
I mean,

429
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:18,550
that's really what the
Iran thing is about,

430
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:19,120
right?

431
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,220
It's about controlling the,

432
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:23,140
about being able to get oil out of a,

433
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:23,711
what does that,

434
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:24,100
that,

435
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,600
that shipping route yes.

436
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,020
There.

437
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,710
And um,

438
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,700
and it's about,

439
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,320
it's about exactly.

440
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,101
And it's not,

441
00:12:30,101 --> 00:12:32,560
don't let people lie to you
and tell you it's about,

442
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,830
they're worried about human rights
abuses in any Ron because look what we're

443
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:38,110
doing in buffering in order
to potentially attack you,

444
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:43,111
run where we're helping them oppress
hundreds of thousands of people on a daily

445
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:44,010
basis.

446
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,420
So,

447
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,210
so if we really cared about human rights,

448
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:46,930
we wouldn't,

449
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,540
we would have left
buffering a long time ago.

450
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,230
We wouldn't be sending them weapons

451
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,330
be in Mexico when,

452
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,060
right,

453
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,900
exactly.

454
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:54,241
And,

455
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,940
and we're being an a and once again,

456
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:56,151
Joe,

457
00:12:56,151 --> 00:13:00,800
this goes back to the American public
being lied to systematically by the media.

458
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:02,060
And it's a real shame.

459
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:03,860
I think so many people say,

460
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:08,390
oh well the Americans are stupid and
they don't know what's going on and know

461
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:10,790
it's Americans are being
fed lies constantly,

462
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,730
all day long and,

463
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:14,000
and it really needs to stop.

464
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,570
Um,

465
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:14,831
it's,

466
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:15,664
it's a shame.

467
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,470
Now you were there,

468
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,370
you're inside,

469
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:19,930
you're on CNN now.

470
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,230
What was it that you wanted to
report on that you couldn't,

471
00:13:23,231 --> 00:13:23,801
what was the,

472
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:25,030
the exact censorship?

473
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:27,610
What did they tell you what you
could or couldn't say about it?

474
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,480
Yeah.

475
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:28,661
Well,

476
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:30,710
what happened was once
I got back from Bahrain,

477
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,270
um,

478
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,580
they were surprised when
obviously the Bahrain regime,

479
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:35,260
when we started airing this video,

480
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,910
cause we were able to
sneak out with the video.

481
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:38,740
They thought that they had
erased all of our video.

482
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,461
Uh,

483
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:41,140
and so we started hearing these stories.

484
00:13:41,141 --> 00:13:42,480
And at first it was great.

485
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,470
CNN was letting us air all of these.

486
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:45,250
Um,

487
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,100
and that was for,

488
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,410
you know,

489
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,191
about a week or so.

490
00:13:47,191 --> 00:13:48,490
It's very easy to get coverage on.

491
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:52,450
But then Barbara and started calling
and complaining and their PR companies,

492
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:56,110
they pay US citizens and US PR
companies to do PR for them.

493
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:56,621
Uh,

494
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:57,700
the people can't afford that,

495
00:13:57,701 --> 00:13:59,020
but of course the regime can.

496
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,183
And um,

497
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:00,820
and then,

498
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,061
uh,

499
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:02,410
eventually three months later,

500
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:06,370
we finished our documentary and we found
out that it wasn't going to be airing

501
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:07,690
on CNN international.

502
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,340
It aired once on CNN,

503
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,183
us,

504
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,270
but never on CNN international
to the target audience,

505
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,110
which is,

506
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,220
is the most,

507
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,000
uh,

508
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,610
the most viewed English
news station in the region.

509
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,721
And so,

510
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:20,050
uh,

511
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,420
we need these people needed
to see this documentary.

512
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,590
And it was an airing.

513
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:24,190
And,

514
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,210
and I've had documentaries.

515
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:25,901
I've done at CNN,

516
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:26,191
the dinner,

517
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:26,501
Aaron,

518
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:27,490
CNN international,

519
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,950
but this entire documentary
was shot overseas.

520
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,100
And what really got me was my
bosses directly above me were,

521
00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:35,140
were dumbfounded.

522
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,020
We would have phone calls
and emails and people said,

523
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:39,160
I don't know why this is an hearing.

524
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:40,510
I don't know what's going on.

525
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,230
Um,

526
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,910
my producers were very,

527
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,080
very upset.

528
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:44,321
I mean,

529
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:46,300
they had risks are lives
to tell this story.

530
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,780
Our sources had risked their
lives to tell CNN their story.

531
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:50,290
Uh,

532
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:55,160
one guys who for Doctors Without Borders
has house was burnt down after he

533
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:55,910
talked with us.

534
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,300
And,

535
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,133
um,

536
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,071
and yeah,

537
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:00,980
I mean in our main source
and the documentary,

538
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:01,940
he's in prison right now.

539
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:04,520
His mom just died yesterday and he
didn't even get to say goodbye to her.

540
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,460
Nabeel Rajab,

541
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,110
he's in prison for the next three years
and he's a peace activist who has a

542
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:10,550
picture of Gandhi on his cell phone.

543
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:11,480
Um,

544
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,220
and so all of these sources that helped
us film this documentary or punished and

545
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:18,020
harassed for helping CNN.

546
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,400
And so we still couldn't believe why they
had an aired it on CNN international.

547
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,100
And,

548
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,120
and so I kept getting people writing
me and calling me and telling me,

549
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,320
you need to look into this.

550
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:28,700
There's something going on here.

551
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:29,350
There.

552
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:29,630
It's a,

553
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,890
it's a much bigger story.

554
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,740
And seeing as how I don't
have a family and you know,

555
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:38,741
I'm not tied down to a retirement plan
or I really could give a crap about,

556
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:40,040
about the money.

557
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,903
Um,

558
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,120
I started looking into it and realizing
the brain's actually a paying customer

559
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,983
at CNN.

560
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,140
They are literally paying
the network for programming.

561
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:48,890
Uh,

562
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,850
journalistically.

563
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,180
I don't know if a lot of people out
there listening know about journalistic

564
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:53,991
ethics,

565
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:56,120
but we're supposed to be
watchdogs on government.

566
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,180
We are not supposed to
accept money from them.

567
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,620
Not only accepting money.

568
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:00,861
Okay,

569
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:03,590
that's different if you accept
money and you air a commercial.

570
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,100
But they're actually airing
our long programs on CNN,

571
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,890
paid for by the buffering regime,

572
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:10,701
not only Bob rain,

573
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:11,451
we're talking Georgia,

574
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:13,040
Kazakhstan and other,

575
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,700
uh,

576
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,533
other regimes.

577
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,680
And this has been going on for decades
and it bothers me cause people are being

578
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:19,514
lied to.

579
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:24,250
So it's just paid propaganda
programming unit for propaganda.

580
00:16:24,251 --> 00:16:25,660
So instead of being the news,

581
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,690
they're there select pieces of information
that these governments want Americans

582
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:32,890
and whoever watches CNN to see.

583
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:33,820
So they pay them for it.

584
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:34,270
Yeah,

585
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,300
they pay illegal.

586
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,160
Well journalistically it's,

587
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:37,640
it's,

588
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,120
um,

589
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,600
I would,

590
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,210
if there were a journalist's police,

591
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,150
I would arrest them.

592
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,050
Uh,

593
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,883
but it,

594
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,940
it is legal,

595
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,530
but is it right?

596
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,340
Uh,

597
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,470
because when the air,

598
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,470
some of these programs,

599
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:48,831
Joe,

600
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:53,150
they don't let the viewers know that
that's paid for by the government.

601
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:53,661
Right.

602
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:57,530
When you watch like one of those wacky
fake talk shows where they're selling a

603
00:16:57,531 --> 00:16:58,190
blender,

604
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,830
they have to tell you this
is a paid infomercial.

605
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,560
They have to tell you when this,

606
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,260
this blender guys in his talk show,

607
00:17:04,261 --> 00:17:04,851
so showing,

608
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:05,031
you know,

609
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:07,490
how you make cucumbers
slice real easy and stuff.

610
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,810
They have to tell you,

611
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,820
why don't they have to
tell you that on CNN?

612
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,160
That seems way more important
than the fucking blender.

613
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:13,621
Well,

614
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:15,780
exactly because it's
shaping our foreign policy.

615
00:17:15,781 --> 00:17:16,051
I mean,

616
00:17:16,051 --> 00:17:19,320
they're feeding the American public
this propaganda so that they think

617
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:24,321
everything's rosy and happy in Bahrain
when really the situation there is,

618
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:26,460
is horrific.

619
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,080
And if you look at one of these programs,

620
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,040
you can youtube it.

621
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,080
It's called I list Bob Rain.

622
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,150
They have their host Richard Quest.

623
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,310
They have him live at the race track
for a week in Bahrain talking about how

624
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,710
wonderful the country is
and how progressive it is.

625
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,010
And he interviews the crown
prince and calls him a reformer.

626
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,430
And this is the same crown prince who was
in empower when troops shot and killed

627
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:50,940
and broad daylight,

628
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,120
these tanks to shot out into a,

629
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:56,200
a crowd of protesters and just
killed them in broad day light.

630
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:56,731
This is the,

631
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:58,140
the prince that two years earlier,

632
00:17:58,141 --> 00:18:00,240
CNN was telling the public was great,

633
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:01,620
was progressive of reformer.

634
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,181
And,

635
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,890
and it's not fair to the
public when you watch these,

636
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,330
the disclosures are so minimal or they're
not even there if you go on youtube,

637
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:09,961
the videos,

638
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:10,530
you know,

639
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,200
um,

640
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,030
and it's not fair to not only seen
as journalists to our sources,

641
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:15,690
but,

642
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,080
but to the people watching because they
don't know they're getting propaganda.

643
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,730
So this has been going on for decades.

644
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,170
For decades.

645
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:23,460
We haven't had real news.

646
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:28,260
We've had a mixture of some real news and
some bullshit that's paid for by other

647
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:28,620
country.

648
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,453
Yes.

649
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,360
Look up,

650
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:30,511
uh,

651
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:33,450
I list bufferin commercial and you
can watch the whole commercial.

652
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,960
And you'll see not once in the
commercial that's like progressive,

653
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,550
fabulous new this week we're
talking about buffering,

654
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:41,790
you know,

655
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,511
it never says,

656
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:46,790
and then commercial that this
is paid for by buffering and,

657
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,491
and so it's,

658
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:49,470
that's not fair to the people.

659
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,831
It's not,

660
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,870
it's not fair to view beyond creepy.

661
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,770
How big is Bahrain?

662
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,810
Bahrain is about the size.

663
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:55,980
Bahrain is small.

664
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:57,720
It's about the size of San Francisco.

665
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,740
Population wise,

666
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,220
you can't say Bahrain every time.

667
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,260
Right.

668
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,410
Not going to say Bahrain.

669
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:03,891
Bahrain.

670
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:04,421
Okay.

671
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:05,360
And you know what I mean?

672
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:06,171
It's like one of those words,

673
00:19:06,171 --> 00:19:08,060
like if you commit to saying
it correctly every time,

674
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,913
how do you spell it?

675
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,360
A,

676
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,651
B,

677
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:09,891
a,

678
00:19:09,891 --> 00:19:10,760
h r a,

679
00:19:10,761 --> 00:19:13,340
I n and m and also we can,

680
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,050
you can see a video of these protests.

681
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:16,100
They're insane.

682
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:20,200
You watch them and you just see
miles of people protesting and,

683
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,510
and then you really realize this is a
true revolution they're trying to have

684
00:19:23,511 --> 00:19:23,781
there,

685
00:19:23,781 --> 00:19:26,540
but it's being oppressed
by the United States.

686
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,500
Um,

687
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,251
because you know,

688
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:29,390
if the people get in power,

689
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:30,800
they're going to kick the U s out there.

690
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:32,420
Very upset because the US has,

691
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,180
has kept a regime in power for them.

692
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,210
So we're helping this creepy
fuck by giving them $1
billion worth of weapons use

693
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:39,400
tear gassing people to death.

694
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,150
Oh yeah.

695
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,250
Oh Wow.

696
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:41,941
And,

697
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:42,721
and not only that,

698
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:44,660
they're systematically getting it off the,

699
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:47,370
the news in the u s as
what happens to me it was,

700
00:19:47,371 --> 00:19:47,790
it was,

701
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,890
it became nearly impossible
to cut through the red tape.

702
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:50,210
Well,

703
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,900
this is really disturbing.

704
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:55,290
If you had any hope whatsoever that we
were going to avoid some sort of conflict

705
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:59,060
with Iran because it seems like that
it's just there they are dead set on it.

706
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,620
That's why another reason I came forward
urgently and cause this is about much

707
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:07,130
more than Bahrain and the systematic
cover up of what's happening about rain

708
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:08,090
only tells you what's,

709
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,320
what's potentially going to
happen in the future and,

710
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:10,561
and,

711
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:11,750
and in the near future.

712
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:12,860
And that's uh,

713
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,130
an attack on Iran or
potentially some people,

714
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:16,271
if you,

715
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:20,210
if you go to the far side who have
really analyzed this could say this could

716
00:20:20,211 --> 00:20:22,010
potentially become a world war three,

717
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,680
Jesus Christ.

718
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,660
And it's all just to control the oil,

719
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,220
right?

720
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,440
I mean,

721
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,790
is that what's it's about?

722
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,624
I mean,

723
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,700
it's just a control oil and it's just,

724
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,170
this is the way they've always done it.

725
00:20:32,171 --> 00:20:33,640
So they're going to
continue to do it this way,

726
00:20:33,641 --> 00:20:37,360
even though now people are
paying attention finally
for the first time in human

727
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,190
history.

728
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:38,610
Yeah.

729
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:38,791
Well,

730
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,820
they're going to tell you if you talk
to people who are very pro Israel,

731
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,450
um,

732
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:42,870
and,

733
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,411
and once again,

734
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:44,940
I don't have an opinion on,

735
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,440
on any of that area.

736
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:47,730
I try to cover objectively,

737
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:47,921
I've,

738
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:50,110
I've covered stories in the
West Bank and in Israel,

739
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,880
but they're going to tell you that Iran,

740
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:52,961
uh,

741
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:53,501
often deny.

742
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:57,010
God said he will wipe Israel off the map
and they're going to repeat that over

743
00:20:57,011 --> 00:21:00,370
and over because that's there for ward
propaganda that they're going to start

744
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:01,210
feeding to you.

745
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,920
And they already have for years.

746
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:03,911
And actually,

747
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:07,130
if you go back to that speech that
they're referring to aqua dinners,

748
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:09,490
I'd never said that it
was miss translated,

749
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,180
but instead they rolled with that in
the u s media has continued to roll with

750
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:13,391
that.

751
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:13,631
Watch.

752
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:14,680
Erin Burnett show.

753
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,141
Yeah,

754
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:15,921
I've seen the,

755
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:16,190
uh,

756
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,150
the original one.

757
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:17,221
They,

758
00:21:17,221 --> 00:21:18,440
when it's translated correctly,

759
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:19,580
it's a totally different meaning.

760
00:21:19,581 --> 00:21:21,020
It wasn't that we were w but it was,

761
00:21:21,021 --> 00:21:21,920
it wasn't nice,

762
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,300
but it wasn't the same thing.

763
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,403
Exactly.

764
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,640
I think it was in response
to if Israel attacked Iran,

765
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:29,271
you know,

766
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:31,610
we would wipe them off the map
or something along those lines.

767
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:31,890
Wasn't,

768
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,930
it wasn't that it was Maura.

769
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,250
Uh,

770
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,031
I'm saying that he,

771
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:35,770
they want the regime out of Israel.

772
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:36,910
They want that government out.

773
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,790
It was more a rhetorical
then than physically,

774
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,190
like we want to go in and
murder you all and kill you.

775
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:44,560
It was more w we want you to be,

776
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,423
be kicked out of office.

777
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,700
So we sort of have acquainted it to
like Khrushchev banging his heel,

778
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,061
you know,

779
00:21:50,061 --> 00:21:52,070
saying we will bury you like that.

780
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,660
That sort of a thing that's like,

781
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,461
so we've,

782
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:56,300
we've decided to run with
that is the big threat.

783
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:56,880
Yup,

784
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,391
exactly.

785
00:21:57,391 --> 00:21:59,760
And they say it's as if Iran gets a nuke,

786
00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:02,010
they're going to send it right
in and wipe Israel off the map.

787
00:22:02,011 --> 00:22:03,540
So that's what they're
trying to use that for.

788
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:04,860
And everyone needs to pay attention.

789
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:05,161
It is,

790
00:22:05,161 --> 00:22:06,360
it is propaganda.

791
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,030
It is forward.

792
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,720
It's just like weapons
of mass destruction.

793
00:22:09,721 --> 00:22:10,620
I see them now,

794
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,630
now that I've been in inside,

795
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:16,170
I know how they start feeding propaganda
and this is exactly what they're doing

796
00:22:16,171 --> 00:22:16,890
was saying,

797
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,041
well,

798
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:17,620
it will be,

799
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,690
Ron's going to wipe Israel off the map
so we need to go in and attack and,

800
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,280
and,

801
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,801
and guys,

802
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:23,041
I mean,

803
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:26,820
this could potentially get
us into a conflict with much,

804
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,840
uh,

805
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,660
more permanent and
damning implications than,

806
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,340
than Iraq and Afghanistan ever,

807
00:22:32,341 --> 00:22:33,174
ever wore.

808
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:33,801
Yeah.

809
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:35,390
It seems like this would be huge.

810
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,720
This would be much bigger if
we actually went into Iran.

811
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,421
It's a,

812
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:42,830
it's another level of civilization above
what was going on in Afghanistan and in

813
00:22:42,831 --> 00:22:45,170
Iraq and theirs does no reason for it.

814
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:46,130
It doesn't make any sense.

815
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,310
And there's no way the rest of
the world is going to tolerate it.

816
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:49,880
It's gonna be,

817
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,713
it's gonna be chaos.

818
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:50,941
Yeah.

819
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:53,250
We have Russia and China
to worry about as well.

820
00:22:53,251 --> 00:22:54,540
If we go in and,

821
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:54,871
and,

822
00:22:54,871 --> 00:22:55,704
and,

823
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,210
and Lord knows what can happen from there.

824
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:00,120
I just hope that the American people
realize that there they are being fed

825
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:01,650
propaganda with,

826
00:23:01,651 --> 00:23:04,890
with the Iran situation now in
the same people behind Iraq,

827
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,690
same forces are behind this
push to get us in Iran.

828
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,703
Okay.

829
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:18,720
Okay.
