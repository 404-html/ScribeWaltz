Is this is not that
other version of is it?

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,073
Yeah,

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:30,850
I think it's per se

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,960
physician theme song.

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,423
No,

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,593
this is uh,

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,080
the gay electronic
version of our theme song.

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,560
Then any s eight bit is that we can sell.

17
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,413
Yeah,

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,250
I want to eat a mushroom bigger.

19
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,440
I'm not want to step on a dragon.

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,610
Not Quite geeky enough to appreciate that
tiny as it sounds like shit that made

21
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:55,540
my dick hard.

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,190
Kevin Smith is in the House,

23
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:57,881
Ladies and gentlemen,

24
00:00:57,881 --> 00:00:59,350
emerging of the podcast,

25
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,940
two huge influences.

26
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:02,740
One you influenced me to,

27
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,230
to have the fleshlight
sponsor the podcast.

28
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,460
I know what you're talking about.

29
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:07,090
I was like fucking,

30
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,110
I was going to jump in.

31
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:09,130
Like I can vouch for it.

32
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,230
I fucked many of those things.

33
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,660
But we also made the fleshlight legit.

34
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,961
Like,

35
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:17,410
if I tried to do that before you
were using them as a podcast sponsor,

36
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:17,951
it'd be like,

37
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:21,910
what are you doing connecting
yourself with such a vile sex toy?

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,170
Somebody had to go first.

39
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:23,471
And I'm like,

40
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:24,370
Kevin Smith has,

41
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:26,170
his whole podcast is sponsored by it.

42
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:27,040
He has these logos.

43
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,770
He puts up this big
flashlight banners and shit.

44
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,070
I,

45
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,210
my feeling was this,

46
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:31,600
like,

47
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,190
women have,

48
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:32,510
uh,

49
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:32,940
uh,

50
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,280
you know,

51
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,660
something to come with for years other
than me other than you something else.

52
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:42,070
And it's socially acceptable and they
make fucking jokes about it on sitcoms and

53
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:42,790
shit.

54
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,421
We're just like,

55
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,320
you could go now,

56
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:45,220
my friend is here.

57
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,980
So in a world war that's
become socially acceptable,

58
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:48,521
I felt like,

59
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:49,330
why not?

60
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,410
Why not vice versa?

61
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,790
Why can't I have something to fuck?

62
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:54,160
It's funny that we feel
bad about feeling good.

63
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,850
We feel bad about wanting
something to feel shame they build.

64
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:57,271
Yeah.

65
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:58,150
It's amazing.
