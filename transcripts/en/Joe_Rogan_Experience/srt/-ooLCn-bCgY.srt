00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,500
Well hiking on antelope
island one time and uh,

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,070
just north of Utah and then they have
this big buffalo reserve out there.

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,320
It's like a public peak,

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,060
probably 6,000 a day height and uh,

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,200
but there's all these free range
in buffalo or were on the island,

7
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:17,830
you know,

8
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,500
and it's coming back down the hill.

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,770
Me and my buddy and as we
were hiking down a trail,

10
00:00:23,771 --> 00:00:23,921
you know,

11
00:00:23,921 --> 00:00:25,060
about 300 yards down,

12
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:27,040
I can see there's a couple
of buffalo right on,

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,851
right on the trail,

14
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:28,684
on the footpath.

15
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,640
And we're like,

16
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:29,890
eh,

17
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,150
sorry,

18
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,530
they'll,

19
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,170
they'll be moved on by the time we
get there and we come down the hill,

20
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,720
come around this big
boulder and sure as shit,

21
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:36,554
they're still standing there.

22
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:37,880
And I,

23
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,620
you know,

24
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,610
my uncle had a farm,

25
00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:40,301
he had cows.

26
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:41,590
I never been around a damn buffalo.

27
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:44,050
I don't know the difference in a suddenly,

28
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:44,710
well they'll move.

29
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,880
It's just a big ass cow,

30
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:46,091
you know,

31
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:47,490
so we just keep walking towards him.

32
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,210
But if he jumps up on a rock and he's
just laughing at me like a dumb ass

33
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:53,450
because I'm standing there at this point,

34
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,470
this thing is 15 feet and it was grazing
like sideways with his hip towards me

35
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,341
and he's just eating.

36
00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:02,730
And finally he looks up and
turns his head and looked at me,

37
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:03,020
man.

38
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,020
And I realized holy shit was like
the size of a Volkswagen beetle man.

39
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,270
Oh my God.

40
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,150
He's just looking at me.

41
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:13,240
I'm thinking this is some dumb shit.

42
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,493
Like,

43
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,790
what am I doing?

44
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,210
You know,

45
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,110
what do I do?

46
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,960
And that's a different buffalo buddy.

47
00:01:19,961 --> 00:01:20,980
That's a water buffaloes,

48
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,840
animals school.

49
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:23,741
There you go.

50
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:24,500
Top lives.

51
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,150
Bison.

52
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,983
Yeah.

53
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,090
He just turns and looks
at me and I'm like,

54
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,380
I'm so fucked.

55
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:30,933
And uh,

56
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,080
I didn't know what else to do.

57
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,990
That thing took one more step forward.

58
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,880
You did towards him.

59
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,290
I didn't know what else to do.

60
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:38,540
Mix.

61
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,373
We're looking at,

62
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:39,810
we,

63
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,300
we're making it,

64
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:40,461
you know,

65
00:01:40,461 --> 00:01:41,380
I just kinda like took.

66
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:42,850
I didn't know like he's
going to charge me,

67
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:43,181
I'm eating,

68
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:44,020
running or what.

69
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:49,090
So I took one more step and you just kinda
like often and him and his buddy ran,

70
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:52,930
but when he started running me like
the whole ground shook and I remember

71
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:56,680
standing there looking at
my friend thinking like that
could've been really bad,

72
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,330
but it's.

73
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,920
But it's open to the public
and out there all the time.

74
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:03,740
It's buffalo everywhere.

75
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,440
So how's that?

76
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:06,274
A winning combination.

77
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,310
I like it.

78
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,271
I do.

79
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:13,020
I like it way better than I liked
the idea of nature at your own risk.

80
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,740
Thanks for introducing me to your dog
because I have to tell you that that video

81
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:21,741
of you grabbing that raccoon and chucking
it down the stairs was easily one of

82
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:24,070
the most gangster things I've ever seen.

83
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,760
That lets you do.

84
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,690
Is this it?

85
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,810
I had to put a little disclaimer
up here so that you know,

86
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:32,970
the animal rights folks
wouldn't get pissed off.

87
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,763
Yeah.

88
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,873
That's.

89
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,280
They're going to get pissed off right now.

90
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:40,650
I hear him crying because
there's no audio in the cameras,

91
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:41,190
but he's like,

92
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,100
just getting mauled by this thing and
you just picked it up and fucking chucked

93
00:02:46,101 --> 00:02:46,171
it.

94
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:47,580
Like gangster dude.

95
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,780
I mean,

96
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,370
you didn't just push it away,

97
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,200
you picked it up over your head,

98
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:56,040
went back behind the head like you're
throwing a medicine ball because another

99
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:56,340
angle.

100
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:56,461
Yeah,

101
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:58,980
this is the best tag over
the back of the head.

102
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,240
And Bang,

103
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,040
we're talking to Kevin rose,

104
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,630
the founder of dig.

105
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:04,950
I,

106
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,780
I gotta say though it was
a little liquid courage.

107
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,360
I'd had a couple glasses
of wine and number two,

108
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,060
my intention was to go down
there and just kick it.

109
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:13,660
Right.

110
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,200
But it was on top of my dog so I'd
be punting my dog at the same time.

111
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,240
It was tangled is.

112
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,810
Yeah.

113
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,520
So I mean,

114
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,030
you know,

115
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,280
then I grabbed it and it's,

116
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:25,030
it's greasy and kind of bristly so,

117
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,631
but you know,

118
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:26,051
whatever,

119
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:26,420
it's kind of,

120
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,640
it's when it's your baby.

121
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,290
I know it sounds weird
to say with the dog,

122
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,570
but it's just like I thought he was dying.

123
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,111
He was getting,

124
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,150
he was howling like he
was getting shredded.

125
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:35,050
But with this clause,

126
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:35,261
you know,

127
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:37,090
so I'm thinking my dog is being killed.

128
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,260
Did you think it was a coyote?

129
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,460
No.

130
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:39,761
You know,

131
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,420
we had seen raccoons in the backyard
before and it was just one of those things

132
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:46,450
where they always just kind of like run
away the second that the lights come on

133
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,090
and this time I don't know what he was.

134
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,200
I don't know if he had babies.

135
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:52,930
Actually there were some other records
that we saw with him at the same time.

136
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:54,460
So I don't know,

137
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,253
man,

138
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,320
those weird sort of a fringe wildlife
creatures like raccoons and coyotes and

139
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:02,861
kind of hang around.

140
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:04,300
Cities are so creepy.

141
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:04,571
Yeah,

142
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:06,190
there's a ton in San Francisco.

143
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,050
It's just all over the place at night.

144
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:09,280
They just dig through the trash.

145
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:09,850
Basically.

146
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,250
A

147
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,790
friend of mine was living out with the
Navajos to kind of get his head straight.

148
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,300
Okay.

149
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,560
And he would,

150
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,190
um,

151
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,140
help take care of their animals when they,

152
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,240
this male female shamans both
would go off to do pod ceremonies.

153
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:23,991
Oh Wow.

154
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:27,290
And he stayed out there for about a year
and he kind of put himself together and

155
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,124
they said,

156
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,000
what helped you and we're
interested in what your medicine is.

157
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,650
And he said it was Mtma.

158
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,521
And they said,

159
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:34,641
well,

160
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,570
we'd be interested in
trying to experience Mtma.

161
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,680
So I was invited out there and we ended
up doing this ceremony in a Navajo and

162
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:49,130
they only spoke Navajo.

163
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:51,080
They didn't speak English at all.

164
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,850
And there was this,

165
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,620
like in the western movies,

166
00:04:54,621 --> 00:04:57,620
there was a trail of dust coming in.

167
00:04:57,621 --> 00:05:02,621
Somebody came on horseback to be our
translator and it was their friends,

168
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,860
it was their 17 year old niece,

169
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,150
holy Shit.

170
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,380
And she came

171
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,060
to mediate during this mtv experience
and it became clear that this was really

172
00:05:18,681 --> 00:05:19,514
for her,

173
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,320
not so much for them to,

174
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:21,860
for,

175
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,340
for,

176
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,210
for them to show their seventh year who
was torn between the different cultures,

177
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,250
that that's something about our culture.

178
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:30,380
We wanted what they had or was,

179
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,910
we saw it and respected it.

180
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,020
Wow.

181
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,853
And the,

182
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,260
and a lot happened in and in the,

183
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,320
it was wonderful in all different ways
and there are some important healings.

184
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:43,154
But in the morning,

185
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:43,880
um,

186
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,840
when we were going,

187
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,890
this young woman,

188
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,013
uh,

189
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,070
was going to get back on her
horse and she had 17 magazine.

190
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,540
Whoa.

191
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,500
And was reading it.

192
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,800
And that's where I started out that,

193
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,191
you know,

194
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:03,191
even out on the reservation in these
protected cultures that had this

195
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,220
globalization of ideas and Internet and
vodcasts and people are being exposed to

196
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,940
ideas that they wouldn't have
normally been exposed to.

197
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:14,691
Even in China.

198
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:14,871
I mean,

199
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:17,270
they're having to do so much
just kind of sensor stuff.
