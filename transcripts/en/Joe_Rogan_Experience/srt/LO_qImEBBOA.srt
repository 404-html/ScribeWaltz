1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,860
Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:03,531
I'm,

3
00:00:03,531 --> 00:00:03,780
I'm,

4
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,650
I'm interested to talk to
you about a bunch of things,

5
00:00:05,651 --> 00:00:10,651
but one of the big ones is this idea of
effective altruism and this is something

6
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:12,190
that you really promote
to the point where,

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:12,911
I don't know if this is true,

8
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:13,780
but I read this about you,

9
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:17,650
that everything that you
make over $36,000 a year,

10
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:18,484
you donate,

11
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,290
so wow.

12
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:20,621
Yeah.

13
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,990
So everything above.

14
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,310
Technically it's having above
20,000 pounds from 2009 Oxford.

15
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:29,050
So just with inflation,

16
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,970
cost of living changes and stuff,

17
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:32,950
but that's about $36,000.

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,620
So you've just sort of decided
that which is by the way,

19
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,630
the one percent for the whole world.

20
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,500
Yeah.

21
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,820
Not quite two percent.

22
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,300
Yeah,

23
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,900
I'll be in the top.

24
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,070
Still be in the top two percent.

25
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:43,920
Even despite that it was 34,000.

26
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,300
I think 34,000 puts you
in a top one percent.

27
00:00:46,301 --> 00:00:48,220
I think it's $55,000.

28
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,590
That was a changed maybe
since trump's been in office,

29
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,350
but it's a,

30
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,950
it's,

31
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,340
you know,

32
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,600
what you're doing is a,

33
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,950
if that's really a case,

34
00:00:56,951 --> 00:00:57,371
that's a,

35
00:00:57,371 --> 00:00:58,810
that's a very charitable thing.

36
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,201
Yeah,

37
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:00,100
and it's also,

38
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,950
I mean it's most of my income
over the course of my life,

39
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,210
like especially as an academic,

40
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:06,400
you're not going to an tons though,

41
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,400
since the effective altruism blew up,

42
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:13,450
you end up getting things like speaking
fees and give all that away as well.

43
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,870
It's going to end up probably
being the large majority of income,

44
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:17,291
of course,

45
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:17,800
of my life.

46
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,870
Do you ever like want to
buy something and be like,

47
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:20,201
shit,

48
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:22,810
if I wasn't so goddamn generous
I'd be able to get this,

49
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,171
you know,

50
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:24,004
I never do.

51
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,900
I like basically never think that.

52
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:26,500
Yeah,

53
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,510
I think like this.

54
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:33,070
Like I think like in contemporary society
we just get bombarded with marketing

55
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:34,950
stuff all the time saying like,

56
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:35,081
oh,

57
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:37,810
you really need this thing if
you're going to have a good life.

58
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,940
And I think like an almost every case,

59
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:41,230
that's just not true.

60
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,560
I think the psychological evidence just
shows that once you go above a certain

61
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:45,430
level of income,

62
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,733
um,

63
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,590
additional money just has a very
small impact on your happiness.

64
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,910
And in my own case,

65
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,950
like the things that make me happy,

66
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:55,330
I like being surrounded by friends.

67
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,130
That's for the gym membership,

68
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,170
that's like $40 a month or something.

69
00:01:59,171 --> 00:01:59,861
It's not very much.

70
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:00,694
I can afford that.

71
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,360
Um,

72
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,500
being able to work and you know,

73
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:03,670
why valium,

74
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,260
passionate about and I already have that.

75
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,030
So my life is just so good in so many
ways and I feel like there's so much of a

76
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:13,240
focus on money and how money is
the key to happiness and it's just,

77
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:14,770
I think it's just all bullshit basically.

78
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,420
I liked that one moment,

79
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:16,571
like,

80
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:16,661
yeah,

81
00:02:16,661 --> 00:02:19,900
we all have these moments where we feel
bad and that when that girl said that I

82
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:20,880
felt better about,

83
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,071
like,

84
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:24,130
I was glad that I didn't go occur.

85
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,660
Did you stay friends with her?

86
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,380
Oh yeah.

87
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,220
I'm not mad at her.

88
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,980
I'm not mad at her and she had
told me some sexual shit to it.

89
00:02:29,981 --> 00:02:30,570
I didn't know.

90
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,180
It was almost like the shit you told me
that I didn't judge you on what kind of

91
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:35,014
Shit?

92
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,913
Um,

93
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,890
she had had a fantasy.

94
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,860
I can say this because he doesn't
even live in state anymore.

95
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,010
I,

96
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,221
she,

97
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:42,881
I wouldn't say this,

98
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:43,511
but I still saw her.

99
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:44,344
I would feel bad.

100
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,370
But uh,

101
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,780
she had a,

102
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,070
let's just say had a,

103
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,580
an,

104
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,570
and she'd never done it,

105
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:54,571
but she had had an animal fantasy or
she had watched a video of an animal

106
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:56,360
fucking a woman and admitted it to her.

107
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,630
Something about it that had turned her on.

108
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,641
What kind of animal?

109
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:01,240
Um,

110
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,920
it was a pony

111
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,633
and

112
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,613
toys

113
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,100
pause.

114
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,610
It was funny.

115
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,410
He told me that she wasn't being dirty.

116
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:19,510
She was literally just
talking to me about it.

117
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:19,661
Well,

118
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:20,920
it's a big fat hog.

119
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,700
Yeah,

120
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,720
I think I blurted that out.

121
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,530
It was a dog and pony hog.

122
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:31,511
Well,

123
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,260
there's a famous,

124
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,640
that's a common fantasy.

125
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:34,570
Women in horses,

126
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,460
a horse.

127
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,550
His Dick is so big.

128
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,860
You can't think about the horse
without thinking about it's Dick.

129
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,730
Absolutely.

130
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,870
When you think about a horse,

131
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:41,750
like you said,

132
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,960
oh,

133
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,010
she'll dig on my thing.

134
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,253
It's just like,

135
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,400
it's a giant Dick.

136
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,960
My horse dicks are fucking huge.

137
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,150
What a great reputation.

138
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,380
Horses are such dopes.

139
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,530
Didn't know what a great reputation.

140
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,430
What was it like having
him having him on here?

141
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:55,210
By the way,

142
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,200
Alex Jones,

143
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,190
it was a dream come true.

144
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,130
Like sitting face to face and talk.

145
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:00,370
Well,

146
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,420
I've been friends with them for a
long time on that guy since 1999.

147
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:06,010
I think it was fun.

148
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,061
It was fun for me,

149
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:10,240
but it was also something like for
the longest time people thought I was

150
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:12,880
avoiding having him on for
some reason and he kept saying,

151
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,121
well,

152
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:14,380
I tried to get ahold of Joe Rogan.

153
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,490
Nevermind Tom and Tom,

154
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:16,330
but he blows me off.

155
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,610
He was always texting the wrong number.

156
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,570
He's always like,

157
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,630
he didn't get worried.

158
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,820
Get Ahold of me that day.

159
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:22,121
And I'm like,

160
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:22,301
dude,

161
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:23,540
I already have a podcast scheduled.

162
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:24,460
I can't do it today.

163
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,061
Well,

164
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:26,500
I'll be back soon when I'm back.

165
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,161
We'll figure it out.

166
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:27,760
We'll figure it out.

167
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,331
And then it would go on.

168
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:30,070
I showed Joe Rogan's been avoiding me.

169
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,900
I've been trying to get in there to give
out this information is very important.

170
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,401
Maybe scared.

171
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,270
Maybe he's been threatened.

172
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,590
The government threatened him.

173
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,630
He won't open up about bigfoot.

174
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,360
I believe Joe Rogan
did experience bigfoot.

175
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,580
He saw he was there in the woods.

176
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,330
Oh,

177
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,650
Alex doesn't really believe in big foot.

178
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:48,484
I guess.

179
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,580
Who knows what he's got on?

180
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,241
I know he believed.

181
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:54,190
He seems to believe in demons these days.

182
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,581
Oh yeah.

183
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:54,790
Well,

184
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,870
they are demons.

185
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:56,950
They're all.

186
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,510
They're all demons from hell.

187
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,051
All of them.

188
00:04:59,051 --> 00:04:59,884
They're damned.

189
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,460
They're damned.

190
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:00,960
I'm sorry.

191
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,740
And I apologize.

192
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,993
The apology,

193
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,500
the apology compilation.

194
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,633
Excuse me.

195
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,900
It's amazing.

196
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,180
I will stop your head.

197
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,691
Excuse me.

198
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:11,440
I gotta go.

199
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,700
This was a Christian family show.

200
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:13,700
It's like what?

201
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,550
I'm a Christian and I apologize.

202
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,490
He's just such a fucking
awesome guy to me.

203
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:19,324
He's awesome.

204
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:19,800
He's,

205
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,080
he's like a boundless source of
entertainment and if you knew him,

206
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:23,321
man,

207
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:23,771
like if you.

208
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:25,270
Me and him went out.

209
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:25,991
We went to a bar,

210
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:26,824
we had a couple of drinks.

211
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,450
We didn't have a great fucking time.

212
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:28,931
I'm telling you.

213
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:30,010
He's a really nice guy.

214
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,270
He's a real nice guy.

215
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,350
And he would start telling you,

216
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:32,530
well,

217
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,071
the Barium,

218
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:34,780
they've been putting Barium
in the water and you're like,

219
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:35,890
what do you want another beer?

220
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,953
Like?

221
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,060
It's,

222
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,470
it's,

223
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,240
I'm telling you he's a great guy,

224
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,140
but I understand that people are upset
that he has the president's ear and maybe

225
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:45,070
the president's like me.

226
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:47,400
Maybe the president just thinks
he's awesome to listen to.

227
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,200
Crazy story trumps just like
barium underwater sounds,

228
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:50,500
great.

229
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,010
Interdimensional child molesters
are coming in through the cigarette,

230
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:58,280
smoke cigarettes with the 599
chemicals are designed to let the gates

231
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,640
of hell come loose in the interdimensional
child molesters come in and he just

232
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,060
will go on and on and on.

233
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,580
The interdimensional child molester
thing because it's like they have

234
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:13,810
interdimensional travel capabilities
and they're like immediate thing.

235
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:13,961
Like,

236
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:14,920
what do we use this for?

237
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:18,790
I know what the kids will rape
kids and other dimensions,

238
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,751
you know,

239
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:23,140
like what will there always is that really
the best application of that fucking

240
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:25,630
technology and that fight.

241
00:06:25,631 --> 00:06:27,910
First thing she does right away
was he against Yulia bears.

242
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,400
Covich first thing she
does punch me in the nose,

243
00:06:30,401 --> 00:06:31,900
just shatters my nose blood everywhere.

244
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:32,501
I was like,

245
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:32,741
great.

246
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:33,440
This is again.

247
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,820
And it was right after the Kurento fight.

248
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:36,240
So it was like I was used to losing which.

249
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,410
And you never want to get in that
space of being used to losing.

250
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,720
But somehow I clicked and you know,

251
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:40,881
I,

252
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:43,930
I did pretty well in the fight and I
ended up getting a mounted triangle on her

253
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,040
and finishing with
strikes in between rounds.

254
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,941
Another corner,

255
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:53,440
man put cold water in the back of my
neck and I thought that I just farted.

256
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:54,880
I thought it was a Fart,

257
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,400
but turns out,

258
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,990
and this poor girl mounted triangle,

259
00:06:59,020 --> 00:06:59,853
no less,

260
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,810
I had no idea of this.

261
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,123
So they grab us,

262
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,781
put us on this bus,

263
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:06,614
I'm still in my fight,

264
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,510
it's a blood limit,

265
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,730
gloves on and they just put us on a bus
separate me and Amanda Buckner from our

266
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:14,570
corner men and everything because we'd
want our fights and they take us to this

267
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,960
palace and I cannot remember who's pals.

268
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,130
Alexander something that
was in St Petersburg and it
was beautiful gold damask

269
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:26,000
and silk and just I'm in
my clothes and I'm like,

270
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:27,080
what is that smell?

271
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:27,980
And I was like,

272
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,040
I'd seen a guy puking backstage
because cars have a headshot.

273
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,371
And I was like,

274
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:32,990
I must've like rolled
in it or stepped into.

275
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,670
I smell so bad.

276
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,730
And John Claude van Damme
randomly walks up to us.

277
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:38,420
I mean it was just like,

278
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:38,940
you know,

279
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,471
faders here,

280
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:40,280
John Claude van Damme,

281
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,911
this and that,

282
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:44,150
like just weird and surreal already
head trauma going on with me,

283
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:48,500
like not really in my
right mind and I just,

284
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,010
it was so weird to be like
smelling myself and being like,

285
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,281
God,

286
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:52,731
I stepped in.

287
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:53,061
Puke.

288
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:55,130
I'm sorry Mr. Van dam like that.

289
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:56,000
I smelled so badly.

290
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,250
That's so crazy too because you got
punched in the nose if you smelled it

291
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:01,420
through your nose fucked up.

292
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,150
I remember being on the bus and looking
around going say Miami perfume or

293
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:06,401
anything.

294
00:08:06,401 --> 00:08:07,770
And people were allowed to shower.

295
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:09,060
But I was always a swing bat.

296
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:09,301
Right.

297
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:12,020
So I was right after put you on a bus.

298
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:13,160
Didn't tell me where I was going.

299
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,890
And that's a good way to get staff.

300
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,700
No kidding.

301
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,540
It was really gross.

302
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,920
I've been lucky with staff,

303
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,810
but yes.

304
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:21,160
So we,

305
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:21,390
I,

306
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,790
I ended up going to the restroom.

307
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,390
I'm looking at this shit caked all over.

308
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,570
Oh did I shit myself.

309
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:27,881
But I was like,

310
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:29,050
it must've been in between rounds.

311
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,570
Like there's no trash can,

312
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,270
it's like silk and gold and
this beautiful palace and stuff.

313
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:37,210
So I just like take my panties off and
just like roll them up and show them

314
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:38,044
behind the toilet.

315
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,660
Black Lace Thong Vladimir Putin.

316
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,351
That was mine.

317
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:43,710
I want to,

318
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,640
I want it back.

319
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,030
No,

320
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,863
I don't want it back.

321
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,321
No,

322
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:49,370
in 2000 it was 10 years ago and it's crap.

323
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,180
Yeah.

324
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,790
So then I just go back out there and it's
like Berlusconi was hitting on me and,

325
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:53,991
and,

326
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,590
and like trying to pick
up and he was like,

327
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:55,741
Hey,

328
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:56,760
can I be your boyfriend tonight?

329
00:08:56,761 --> 00:08:57,190
And I'm just like,

330
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,780
what?

331
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,130
But he's seeing it through a translator.

332
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:00,170
So it was so and I'm like,

333
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,530
I smelled like shit.

334
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,920
Like you are a dirty motherfucker

335
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,070
comes,

336
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,251
you know,

337
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:09,690
puts his arm around me and I'm just like,

338
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,310
this is weird as hell.

339
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:12,720
That was it.

340
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,900
It was just like I shit myself in
front of foreign dignitaries in another

341
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,793
country.

342
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,230
That's probably my favorite MMA store

343
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:19,770
right.
