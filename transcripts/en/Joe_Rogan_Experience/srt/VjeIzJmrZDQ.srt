00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,710
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,580
You're earning your keep.
That's one thing I rather know where I

3
00:00:06,581 --> 00:00:09,280
stand and get fucked with.
That's the leg I'm talking about.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,990
Really?
You need a tape of me.

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,320
You just saw him at the store.
What the fuck do you leave?

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,910
If I'm good enough for Mitzi shore,
why do you want to take,

7
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,680
who the fuck are you and your fucking
shit down to want to take from me?

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,010
I'm not the fucking major league.
Leave fucking comedy.

9
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,090
The comedy store.
You can me.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,450
You want to tape?
Go Fuck Yourself.

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,980
I'm not sending you a fucking day.
It's against my fucking,

12
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:39,370
well,
it's like these people now with movies

13
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:40,660
and TV,
Joey,

14
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,100
they,
they want you to do a coast,

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,610
but they want you to send the real.
Don't don't send Shit Joey,

16
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:49,090
but they know it's a Costar.
They could offer it to me and if they

17
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,110
don't that's fine.

18
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,880
I'll do my podcasts and I'll live
another week.

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,370
That's the mind and eventually it will
go.

20
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,460
This motherfucker isn't gonna.
We might as well give it to them.

21
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,520
I'm not doing it for that.
You want me to fucking be a guest star

22
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:02,110
recur?
You want to give me a series regular?

23
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:04,810
I'll give you a fucking paper and I'll
fucking to come down and talk to you.

24
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,060
But for Costar,
we've been doing this.

25
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,650
Look at the IMD.
Be What?

26
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:12,760
Fucking tape,
you know to fuck are you to decide.

27
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,540
Let me see your fucking tape.
Let me see your fucking tape.

28
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,101
Hey,
you said that,

29
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:18,970
you know,
fucking tape.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,530
Even then I had my fucking pride,
even that I wouldn't send the fucking

31
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,450
paypal.
I refused.

32
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:28,200
I finally send a blank tape.
He gave me that anti.

33
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,890
Never had respect for none of them
again,

34
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,500
because I found that it was a power
play.

35
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,300
It was like,
you're on my court.

36
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:34,901
Uh,
you know,

37
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:37,120
you want to give me some respect but
respect.

38
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:37,990
What do you do?
You're a pimp.

39
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,780
You take 20% of what people come to the
fucking door.

40
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:41,740
What the fuck are you?
One of?

41
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:43,900
You don't,
you can't even play the fucking Ukulele.

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,400
The fuck are you doing?
You can't put a fucking Ukulele.

43
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:50,560
What the fuck have you done?
That's my,

44
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,910
that's where I'm coming from.
I didn't want them to self club owners

45
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:55,270
are bad,
but they did great jobs.

46
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,390
It was the ship.
They bold that in fucking like,

47
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,340
and that's why I always get excited
about coming on this show cause because

48
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:06,940
this show is democracy in action,
you have millions of fucking people

49
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:08,380
listening.
And guess what?

50
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,060
Unless we say something,
unless we wake up from our volume and

51
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:17,050
booze induced stupor,
nothing's going to fucking happen.

52
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,680
So why the fuck are you doing it?
That's the question you should ask

53
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:24,730
yourself from 2015 not am I going to
lose weight now I'm going to read more

54
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:27,520
fucking books.
Not Am I going to go worse sketchers

55
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:28,960
instead of Nike's.
It should be.

56
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,140
Why the fuck do I get up in the fucking
morning and now we're very lucky

57
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:37,810
motherfuckers that were posted economic
and we can fucking say,

58
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,150
I'm going to get up in the morning
because of this.

59
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,390
I like how the 1% is relabeled
themselves post economic.

60
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,120
Well,
I'm the newest,

61
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,050
I'm the newest of the 1% and I'm giving
it all away.

62
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,370
Cause I,
I'll tell you one thing,

63
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,890
money means a fuck of a lot when you
don't have it.

64
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,970
By my old man told me the only thing
that ever made any sense about money,

65
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:00,430
he said life is like a shit.
The more bread you have,

66
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,010
the last sheet you have to eat.
But once you get it,

67
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,900
once you get that a plus,
you just say,

68
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:06,550
fuck it.
You know what I'd like to do?

69
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,440
I would like to buy 20 million acres and
say,

70
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:11,980
no one's allowed to fuck with that.
You can't fucking do shit with that

71
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,470
fucking line.
I'm just gonna fucking leave it because

72
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:16,780
that's one of the only things you can
do.

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,240
That's a pure good.
Just leave the land.

74
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,110
Don't fucking mine it.
Don't fucking pissing in,

75
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,360
don't shit in it.
Don't put Joe's tuna bards and Tequila

76
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,440
boom,
boom room in there.

77
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,320
Just leave it fucking gorgeous because
fucking that's,

78
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,840
that's,
that's God had to me is nature.

79
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,580
Yeah.

80
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,280
And I'm telling you,
if you think,

81
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,350
okay,

82
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,360
your wife has been happy when you've
called before,

83
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,180
after fucking three days on the road and
not being able to call,

84
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,000
you've never heard.
You tell a girl,

85
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,260
oh,
I was wrong.

86
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,880
You don't have herpes.

87
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,300
Okay.

88
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,590
They get elated.

89
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:50,870
Yeah.

90
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,600
Overcome with joy.
Now do you think maybe you should have

91
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:57,340
just waited till results came back
showing these girls and you just didn't

92
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:00,070
want him to fuck somebody else in the
meantime and then while I'm waiting to

93
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,060
side some other guy's life is ruined.
Right?

94
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,870
Well I heard this is this.
It'll suck it up and take my lumps also

95
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,370
on the other level,
I figured I could tell them I'm 90% sure

96
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:10,670
it was like a cop out.
So I'm not like fully sag.

97
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,360
Look,
I have it.

98
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,420
We fucked.
I thought it that uh,

99
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,720
from what I understood when I got tested
was that you can only test herpes while

100
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:20,420
the outbreaks happen.
Then they act to actually spoon a little

101
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:22,940
out of the outbursts that I could.
You can't really,

102
00:04:22,941 --> 00:04:26,390
it's really hard to test for herpes.
So a lot of times you can get tested

103
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,790
during like not an outbreak and be like,
oh yeah,

104
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,560
to just positive for herpes.
No,

105
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,110
I think it was an old tests.
I think that was like 15 years ago.

106
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:35,810
Toast.
They need Olympic style Herbie's

107
00:04:35,811 --> 00:04:40,811
everybody's time
for serious overcome his boy.

108
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,410
And
I heard if you do pop it like you could

109
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,100
actually taste it.
Taste herpes.

110
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:48,320
Yeah.
It's like a sweetness.

111
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,670
How many different fucking puss woes
before herpes is like,

112
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:53,630
I got it.
Yeah.

113
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,960
You can't just say it's the once.
That might just be,

114
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,500
that was solving your own blog.
This person's had it for awhile.

115
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,130
It's a burgundy,
burgundy is or on the culture.

116
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,190
Well,
I think that,

117
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,710
you know,
w with civilization,

118
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,060
part of another inherent component of
civilization did you have to be better

119
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:18,950
than someone else,
you know?

120
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,980
And so a lot of the things that we do,
um,

121
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,860
our,
our,

122
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,590
our ways of delineating ourselves from
Sab,

123
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,650
like what we would call savages are more
primitive people.

124
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:34,490
Like you wore shoes,
you didn't want your skin to be too dark

125
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:35,750
or Tan you,
you know,

126
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:37,730
you wanted to show that you had more
affluence,

127
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:40,090
that you weren't as barbaric.
He didn't have to poop on it.

128
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:42,680
You could just poop it and push it
flusher and it went away.

129
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:45,020
And like it just,
that just comes soft hands.

130
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,180
Right?
Cultured demeanor.

131
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,500
You were less and less animal running
away if you were less animal.

132
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,030
Right.
And you're trying to be more animal,

133
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,000
but the word is primitive.
I am a primate.

134
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,273
Yeah.

135
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,230
What advancements the society make that
you think has society made that you

136
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:05,450
think are beneficial?
Well,

137
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:07,760
Gosh,
I mean I think medicine is benefit.

138
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:09,650
I mean,
I think everything is beneficial.

139
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:14,060
It's just that what I'm more concerned
of about is what's,

140
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,290
what has been,
what is no longer needed that is still

141
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:20,060
essential.
So it's,

142
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:20,780
it's my,
it's,

143
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,910
I don't,
I don't have really an aversion against

144
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:28,180
civilization and technology.
It's just that vitamin C is still

145
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:31,640
necessary.
Like we can't get around the fact that

146
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,340
vitamin C is still necessary.
So I'm just trying to figure out

147
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,890
diseases.
So when you're trying to figure out

148
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:38,870
diseases,
you have to kind of boil down to,

149
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:43,160
could this disease be a rising because
of some non input,

150
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:45,770
some essential input that we're not
getting.

151
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:49,820
And so as people get more and more
advanced,

152
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,040
the our,
our health,

153
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:55,370
again,
in the terms of biological sense isn't

154
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,440
getting better with us.
And so what happens to a species that

155
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,490
advances itself right out of being a
species?

156
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,620
You know,
like that,

157
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,760
that's more what I'm,
I'm interested in.

158
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,410
So I like it all.
I like all technology.

159
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,620
Netflix,
Netflix might be my favorite technology.

160
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,000
[inaudible].
