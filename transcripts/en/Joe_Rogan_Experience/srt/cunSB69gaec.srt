1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:05,750
Okay,

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,590
boom.
We're alive.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,850
That's it.
Just like that.

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,340
So thank you for doing this.
Welcome.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,810
What's going on?
Total pleasure.

6
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,240
Nothing.
Happy to be in La are you?

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,190
I am always New York's could right now 
though.

8
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:17,840
Right?
It's good.

9
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,320
It's like June ish.
It's like an addictive relationship,

10
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,690
but most of us would rather be in 
California.

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,830
New York is,
yeah,

12
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,330
yeah,
yeah.

13
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:27,164
It's,
um,

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,433
you're a psychiatrist and um,
I would think that there was ample work 

15
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,463
in New York,
just the environment that New York 

16
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,820
provides people stacked on top of each 
other,

17
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:40,190
like that beep,
beep Hong Kong.

18
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:41,024
Fuck you all that like,
I would just assume all that stress 

19
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,910
leads to a lot of people with a,
yeah,

20
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,860
absolutely.
It's like if you're a fisherman,

21
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:50,120
you want to live near a river.
Right?

22
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,460
Right.
And it's fetishized in New York too,

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,353
to have a psychiatrist.
It's sort of almost expected that you 

24
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:56,510
do.

25
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,290
So not only is there like ample supply 
and demand,

26
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,730
but then it's,
you know,

27
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,270
it's a thing you're talking about.
Yeah.

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:03,761
Yeah.
What,

29
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:05,840
what's that about?
Can you explain that?

30
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,090
I think it's like,
you know,

31
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:10,220
Woody Allen level,
right?

32
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:11,054
Like sort of embracing your shadow and 
then there's something refreshing about 

33
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:14,714
it because we don't pretend to be okay.
I mean we're deeply not okay in New 

34
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,600
York.
Chronically bullied someone.

35
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,720
Okay.
Like in general anywhere.

36
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,690
Is there a spot like,
oh yeah,

37
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:24,860
Seattle,
they've got it nailed.

38
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,980
I mean there's this term actually in the
medical literature,

39
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:28,814
believe it or not,
called Paleo deficit disorder and it 

40
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:34,730
just refers to like how far have you 
strayed from the path in your lifestyle?

41
00:01:34,731 --> 00:01:37,280
Like basic stuff,
greenspace movement,

42
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:38,114
you know,
sleep.

43
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,320
And I would imagine that if you have 
more of those components intact,

44
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,840
you're probably a bit more okay than if 
you're living,

45
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,063
you know,
right.

46
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,053
In midtown Manhattan,
like Seattle in the summer to me is a 

47
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:55,940
really good place because it's so green 
and it's so pretty.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,450
And the ocean's right there.
So you're getting some good air and then

49
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:01,250
you're getting sun cause it's the 
summer.

50
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:04,190
So you don't have to seasonal depression
thing that goes on.

51
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,820
I mean I imagine they're doing better.
They're doing it,

52
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:07,970
they've been there.
You never know.

53
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:09,560
I've heard it's like crazy beautiful.
Yeah,

54
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,030
it's awesome.
It's awesome.

55
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:11,864
But those winners,
they get to you after the 30th day 

56
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,010
around and you're like,
come on,

57
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,950
this is stupid.
Like how much water do you need?

58
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,220
I'm like a big,
big winter complainer and I have been my

59
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:23,054
whole life.
So I complain 10 months of the year of 

60
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:26,084
what it's like to live in the northeast.
But recently I've been playing around 

61
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:32,750
with the idea that there's actually 
something cool about like,

62
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,660
you know,
sort of cyclical living.

63
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,483
It's almost just like if you embrace it,
then there's something just like 

64
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:45,641
everything did and miserable for a 
period of time and then it blooms.

65
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,180
You're getting to experience like this 
rebirth and then it,

66
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,160
you know,
flourishes and then it dies again.

67
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,040
But there's another perspective on that 
actually being,

68
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,200
I don't know,
like if you work with it,

69
00:02:57,201 --> 00:02:59,860
it's sorta like a woman who's on birth 
control

70
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,670
has no idea that there's any point to,
uh,

71
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:06,250
you know,
a cycle of energy over the course of the

72
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:08,170
month range.
She sort of thinks is that,

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,540
that's annoying.
But there's a way you can wrap your mind

74
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,540
around it where you work.
Okay.

75
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,000
So like if you're on birth control,
you have no menstrual cycle,

76
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,610
right?
So you're just like,

77
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,260
you're like a man,
you're like a flat line the whole month.

78
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,300
But there's actually something really 
empowering if you understand how to work

79
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:30,100
with your energy shifts because 
naturally like a woman's natural men,

80
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,570
I know this is really what you want to 
be talking about,

81
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:33,640
right?
It's salient to me.

82
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,010
So I do want to hear like I figured this
out,

83
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,830
I'm 39 I was on birth control for 12 
years,

84
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:39,664
so I never knew what it was,
what it meant to have like a menstrual 

85
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,500
cycle until very recently.

86
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,010
Cause then I had two kids breastfeeding.
So a couple of decades into my life,

87
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:48,844
I'm just figuring this out.
But you have like totally different 

88
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:51,874
kinds of energy over the course of the 
month and you have to know how to work 

89
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:55,384
with that.
So there's a kind of energy that you 

90
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,040
want to go out and socialize or you want
to stay in and work or you want to sleep

91
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:03,700
more or less.
And if you don't know how to ride that,

92
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,790
then you could be sort of taken off 
guard by it.

93
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,653
But if you know how to work with it,
it's so much more powerful than just 

94
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:14,200
having this like artificial hijacking of
your endocrine system.

95
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,103
That's interesting.
So there's like some sort of analogy to 

96
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:17,264
be drawn between the cycles of nature 
and the cycles of your body month to 

97
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,943
month.
Yeah.

98
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,780
Huh.
I would have never considered that.

99
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:24,763
I never even thought about it,
but I have thought about birth control 

100
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:27,734
before about how crazy it is that you 
give a woman a hormone that convinces 

101
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:35,330
her body that she's perpetually pregnant
and that a giant percentage of women are

102
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:39,470
on it for convenience or even from other
medical issues like skin issues.

103
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,180
Right,

104
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,841
exactly.
Yeah.

105
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:43,360
I mean when I,
I've always been a feminist,

106
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:46,360
right?
So even when I was younger and very much

107
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:50,080
asleep,
I identified as a feminist and I was one

108
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,590
of those people who thought that birth 
control was like a female entitlement.

109
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:57,040
Like how dare you not make this free and
widely available.

110
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,293
But as I began to research more about it
and more about how it's in many ways 

111
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:04,150
like the ultimate,
you know,

112
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:04,984
not to sound too inflammatory,
but the ultimate tool for oppression of 

113
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,993
you know,
the modern woman now I find it 

114
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,870
incredible that we,
you know,

115
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,170
there were still taking it because it 
seems like a good idea,

116
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:18,004
right?
Who wants to deal with your annoying 

117
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:20,290
menstrual cycle?
Who wants to get pregnant,

118
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,410
who wants to have endometriosis or 
polycystic ovary,

119
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,513
you know,
who wants to have acne or like hair 

120
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:30,340
growing in weird places.
But it's the magic pill illusion.

121
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,370
There's no free lunch,
there's never going to be something that

122
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:37,090
just fixes it for you and you just waltz
off into the sunset.

123
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:40,600
There's always a cost and the cost is so
much more vast,

124
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:41,434
like ranging from literally death all 
the way to just like subtle alterations 

125
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:48,430
in your personality.
And like the fear Moans,

126
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,290
you secrete,
you know,

127
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,410
and there there was just a million woman
study,

128
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,313
um,
and Scandinavia that showed about the 

129
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:58,730
vast increase in antidepressant

130
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,850
prescribing for teenagers who are 
prescribed birth control.

131
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:02,684
So it's the beginning of sort of,
it's like a gateway drug sometimes for 

132
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,290
psych meds to her.
I had a friend who,

133
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,124
one of his good friends,
his daughter died from some 

134
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:16,760
complications with taking birth control 
pills and smoking cigarettes.

135
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,440
Yes,
pulmonary embolism,

136
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:19,274
probably smoking cigarettes.
Apparently along with the birth control 

137
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,520
pills are extremely dangerous,
but so many do it of course.

138
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,190
And you don't even have to have that 
additional risk factor,

139
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,480
you know,
cause birth control,

140
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:34,010
whether it's the pill or something 
called the Nuva ring by itself has that,

141
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:34,844
you know,
I'm contacted often by parents of girls 

142
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:41,990
who have died from pulmonary embolism 
who've now become like activists in this

143
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:43,970
realm.
It's because of birth control pills.

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,491
Yeah,
yeah.

145
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:45,324
No,
it's like a known mechanism and it's a 

146
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:49,730
known risk factor.
Like I think that's not being suppressed

147
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:50,564
or hidden.

148
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,523
It's just that we're sort of in trained 
to dismiss the risks as we attached to 

149
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:56,774
the promise,
so we sort of like collude and ignoring 

150
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,410
that potential.
You know?

151
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,453
That's so interesting because most 
people when they think about the birth 

152
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:04,994
control pill,
they think about it as something that 

153
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:07,440
liberated women.
Exactly.

154
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,683
They can control whether or not they got
pregnant and they were allowed for the 

155
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:12,884
first time to have careers and do 
whatever they wanted to because they 

156
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:17,990
didn't have to worry about being 
trapped.

157
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,030
That's right.
That's a story,

158
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,300
but that's the biological free lunch 
thing,

159
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,134
right?
There's isn't there also a lot of 

160
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,980
issues.
Chris Ryan was on here at Dr Chris Ryan,

161
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:28,814
the author of sex at dawn.
He was on here and he was talking about 

162
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:36,830
how women can look.
If you smell the clothes of other men,

163
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,280
you can literally tell the men that you 
are attracted to,

164
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,323
you would be biologically compatible 
with those men and that when they did 

165
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,670
these same studies on women who are on 
the birth control pill,

166
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:47,960
they couldn't smell the difference.

167
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,520
That's right.
It's called the t shirt study.

168
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,960
Yeah.
How does that work?

169
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,310
Could you explain that?
Well,

170
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,233
essentially the,
the premise of pharmaceutical medicine 

171
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:57,224
is that you can just pull like one 
little thread of the spider web and 

172
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:01,754
leave the rest of it intact.
Like everything else is going to be 

173
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:05,960
fine.
We're only working on this one area.

174
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:09,050
So with birth control for example,
the idea is we're just,

175
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,123
you know,
taking over the management of your sex 

176
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:14,360
hormones,
but the rest of your body is going to be

177
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:18,020
totally unaffected.
And of course as we learn more about how

178
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:22,580
all of these systems are totally an 
inextricably interconnected,

179
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,640
we have a better understanding of how,
you know,

180
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:26,474
when you interfere with sex hormones,
you also potentially have other effects 

181
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:32,130
including,
um,

182
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,650
raising things called binding Globulin 
is including inflammatory response.

183
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:39,380
You're depleting a number of nutrients 
and we're having,

184
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,200
you know,
it's possible that we,

185
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,053
we haven't even begun to look through 
the keyhole of the effects on brain and 

186
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,653
you know,
sort of neuropeptides and these arenas 

187
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:53,300
where we don't have any idea what 
pheromonal secretion is about.

188
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,340
Like we just have to defer the 
probability

189
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,860
that our bodies are more complex than 
we've.

190
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,620
Right and like began to understand.
So your biology is meant to guide you.

191
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,740
It's meant to empower you and it's meant
to create a sense of vitality.

192
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:14,460
If you can inhabit your body and be in a
truce with it.

193
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,653
That's part of the problem with the 
mindset of birth control is I'm just 

194
00:09:18,271 --> 00:09:19,170
going to,
you know,

195
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,690
take this over.
I'm going to some manage this.

196
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,813
And so who knows?
Maybe even it's a top down like mindset 

197
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,600
thing that begins to sort of divorce you
from your sensibilities.

198
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,270
We don't really know is the point that's
going,

199
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,910
that's going to be a common answer I 
think I have to give you is that we,

200
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,650
we don't really know,
but it,

201
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,050
it does make sense that you're,
you know,

202
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:43,680
the subtle nature of your biology that 
involves,

203
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:44,514
you know,
sort of guiding your human interactions 

204
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:49,590
and particularly sex related 
interactions is going to be derailed.

205
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,150
I mean,
low libido is one of,

206
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,670
ironically the most common,
um,

207
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:56,460
disclosed side effects of birth control.
So you're,

208
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,860
you're taking it so that you can have 
unprotected sex.

209
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:01,540
We don't feel like having sex ultimately
anyways.

210
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,350
So it's not even really that well 
thought out,

211
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:06,540
I think by most of us.
That's very bizarre.

212
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:10,470
But what other alternatives are there?
I mean if you're a woman and you want to

213
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:13,050
have control of whether or not you get 
pregnant,

214
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,840
there's not a whole lot of options other
than weird ones like Iud,

215
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,840
which seemed real weird.
Yeah.

216
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:22,860
I mean there is some of my patients use 
what's called a copper iud.

217
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,183
You know,
it's funny cause I had one put in and 

218
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:26,754
two and a half,
it costs like $700 and two and a half 

219
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:28,854
weeks later I had it taken out because I
just felt weird about having like a 

220
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,020
pharmaceutical metal and mind.

221
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,670
And my body was about like a tracking 
device.

222
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:37,790
It felt like feel it and there are no,
no,

223
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,630
no,
it's not really a thing.

224
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,430
It's just like psychologically it felt 
weird.

225
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,010
But um,
I use something called a daisy,

226
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,800
which is like this highly calibrated 
thermometer.

227
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:48,300
I need track your,
you know,

228
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:50,430
cause you have six fertile days a month.
This isn't,

229
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,383
you know,
like some major sacrifice you have to 

230
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:54,354
make in order to learn how your cycle 
works and then you get the benefits of 

231
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:02,430
being in your hormonal millia you know,
like it's not,

232
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,250
um,
it's not that complicated,

233
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,770
but there's a learning curve,
you know,

234
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,613
requires like learning how to be a woman
and also sharing the onus because you 

235
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:13,934
know,
with all of these side effects had been 

236
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:15,480
talking about,
you know,

237
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:16,314
there was like a male birth control 
study that was just terminated because 

238
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:22,050
of how many side effects like the men 
didn't want to deal with.

239
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,883
You know,
so there's such this socio cultural 

240
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:24,744
double standard around this,
but if we're talking about six days a 

241
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:27,564
month,
like have we collaborate and try and 

242
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:29,870
figure something out,
you know,

243
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,713
that doesn't involve a risk of death.
Perhaps this daisy thing just monitors 

244
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:37,230
or temperature and tells you exactly 
what's going on.

245
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,093
Yeah.
I mean it's a little more sophisticated 

246
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:39,834
than that.
It actually has the efficacy like above 

247
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:44,460
99% efficacy if you listen to it.
That's part of the,

248
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,410
you know,
room for human error,

249
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,393
but it basically just tells you like 
have sex now if you want to conceive or 

250
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:54,250
if you don't then don't.
So it's a little like a light's green,

251
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,050
red or yellow.
Well,

252
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,190
how many women are on birth control?
If you had to guess nationwide?

253
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,770
You know,
I would,

254
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,090
that's a good question.
I don't know the stat off hand.

255
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,163
Upwards of like 10 million I would say.
But that's a growing number of people 

256
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:15,320
taking some sort of substance that 
alters the,

257
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,920
the very nature of who they are.
Exactly.

258
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,461
Yeah.
I mean,

259
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:19,294
my interest in it really came from 
looking at the psychiatric side effects 

260
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,470
because I'm very interested in 
medications that have potential,

261
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,353
you know,
gateway effects around psychiatric meds 

262
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,540
that we aren't informing women have 
before they start the prescription.

263
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,560
So,
you know,

264
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:37,990
whether it's like acid blocking 
medications,

265
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,670
you know,
or antibiotics,

266
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,940
um,
you know,

267
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,853
birth control of vaccines,
these things have known a psycho 

268
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,650
biological effects.
If you don't know that,

269
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:48,484
then you'll never connect the dots.
And then you end up in the polypharmacy 

270
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,084
realm where you're taking multiple meds 
without ever knowing where the dominoes 

271
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,010
like started to fall.

272
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,310
I remember there was a commercial they 
used to have,

273
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:01,144
I don't know if they're still there,
but it was for a psychiatric medication 

274
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,853
that you take who's an antidepressant 
when you are depressed from 

275
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:12,280
antidepressants.
Do you know what I'm talking about?

276
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,920
I think you've probably talking about 
abilify.

277
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,150
It was actually the number one 
prescription in America recently.

278
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,950
Terrifying.
It's an anti psychotic,

279
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,980
you read the side effects.
It's like Whoa,

280
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:25,900
slow down.
Like what is this?

281
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:29,530
Like psychotic thoughts and death and 
yeah,

282
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,453
bleeding and right and if what you were 
taking that had similar side effects 

283
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:36,010
isn't working,
then you can just layer this on.

284
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:38,200
It's very common practice.
It's very rare.

285
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:42,310
I would say actually for people to be on
just one psychiatric med.

286
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:46,180
It's almost an industry standard to be 
taking upwards of,

287
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:47,320
I would say,
you know,

288
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,760
two,
three,

289
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,670
sometimes even five.
Many of the patients I work with come to

290
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:54,190
me on a cocktail of like five medics.

291
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,740
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

292
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,480
Well,
you're chasing something for like years,

293
00:13:58,481 --> 00:13:59,314
right?
Because you're never really gonna feel 

294
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:02,554
yourself the way you want to.
And that's what I've found is really 

295
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,480
what we want.
You know,

296
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:10,330
like we just want to feel comfortable in
her own skin.

297
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:12,900
We just want to feel ourselves like in 
fact,

298
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:14,030
they don't want to,
you know,

299
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,913
be her or him or be rich are beautiful.
We just want to feel cool being who we 

300
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:20,110
are.
And you're never going to,

301
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,783
I don't want to say never,
but it's very unlikely you'd feel that 

302
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:23,914
way while on a medication that has 
consciousness altering effects and a 

303
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:29,704
slew of side effects.
And so you're going to be chasing that 

304
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,340
with other,
with the promise of other meds,

305
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:34,174
you know,
a stimulant because you're a paxil is 

306
00:14:35,861 --> 00:14:36,694
making you tired and then you need a 
benzodiazepine because you can't sleep 

307
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:42,340
and you know,
then you're sort of depressed again.

308
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,590
And so you have another antidepressant 
layered on.

309
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:46,990
And then there's a fad,
you know,

310
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:48,060
sort of,
you know,

311
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,880
bipolar to medication that you could try
out like lamictal or abilify.

312
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,193
And so this is sort of the culturally 
sanctioned approach to mental health 

313
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,560
today.
Yeah.

314
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,413
So how does the doctor know?
Like say if you think they put you on 

315
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:08,000
some zoloft or something like that,
and I'm not to pick on Zoloft,

316
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:09,440
but then they,
they say,

317
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,274
well,
it's just not really totally doing it 

318
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:12,800
for Ya.
Oh,

319
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,690
we're thinking about stack and abilify 
in with the Zoloft and I think that just

320
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:19,220
might be the ticket to your happiness.
Right,

321
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:20,054
right,
right.

322
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,820
Yeah.
Well it's important to remember,

323
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,070
right?
Like particularly in psychiatry,

324
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,220
there's no objective testing measure.
You have a broken arm like,

325
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,120
Hey,
I see you have a broken arm.

326
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,100
We're going to put your arm in a cast 
over the broken arm.

327
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,310
You can get an x ray.
Right,

328
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,901
right.
Improve.

329
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:36,900
They have a broken arm.
Right.

330
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,600
In psychiatry,
there's no blood test.

331
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:40,370
There's no eeg,
there's no,

332
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,990
you know,
scan of any kind.

333
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:44,990
It's a conversation.
Sometimes as short as 10 minutes.

334
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,140
If I came into your office and my office
is a little different,

335
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,570
but just say if you were a regular 
psychiatrist and I'm like,

336
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,270
ah man,
I dunno Kelly.

337
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,060
I'm a fucking mess.
I can't keep it together.

338
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,560
What do I do?
What do I take?

339
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:58,394
Could you just start someone off on like
a low dose of something and see if it 

340
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:03,620
helps and they come back and a couple of
weeks like how does it work?

341
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:06,020
It's like it,
it's like an art form.

342
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:06,854
I mean you have your personal favorite 
medications that you feel comfortable 

343
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:12,560
prescribing so you're more likely to 
prescribe them.

344
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,230
But then also,
and this is also,

345
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,313
you know in the literature itself,
if a patient comes in asking for a 

346
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:19,304
particular medication,
then you 49% I think it was like of 

347
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:24,704
prescriptions that are written are 
written because of specific patient 

348
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,410
requests.

349
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,900
So like where are people getting 
exactly.

350
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,063
They're getting these ideas from the 
fact that we are one of three countries 

351
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:36,920
in the world that allows for direct to 
consumer advertising.

352
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,450
North Korea and Russia.
No,

353
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:40,100
it's surprising.
It's surprising.

354
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,560
Brazil and New Zealand.
Oh Wow.

355
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:44,600
That is surprising.
It's weird,

356
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:45,434
right?
It confuses the hell out of me when I 

357
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:47,804
watch those commercials and those like 
beautiful piano music playing and 

358
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:54,140
there's cartoon flowers are smiling and 
everybody was brainwashed.

359
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,360
What are they selling me?
And they know it works.

360
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,580
Ask Your doctor multibillionaires are 
put into those commercials.

361
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:04,880
Yeah,
for good reason.

362
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,773
So there's no real like,
there's not like a blood test or 

363
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,970
something they give you,
they say,

364
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:13,460
I think this is going to be the ticket 
for you.

365
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,441
Nope.
Yeah,

366
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:17,150
no,
it's very impressionistic.

367
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,980
And that's sort of the issue.
I mean,

368
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:23,960
the diagnostic and statistical manual,
the DSM is sort of the dictionary,

369
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,490
so to speak,
in psychiatry.

370
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,323
And like in the 50s,
it was like 150 pages and now it's 886 

371
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:32,924
pages and it's grown in volume largely 
because of the consensus decisions of a 

372
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:42,200
bunch of older white men sitting around 
a table.

373
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,030
You say the bane,
um,

374
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,620
you know,
almost all of them have industry ties.

375
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,483
And this is out there.
This isn't like a conspiracy theory on 

376
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,390
my mom was a nurse and she was always 
telling me that,

377
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,530
um,
they would,

378
00:17:58,531 --> 00:17:59,364
uh,
get taken out on these really nice 

379
00:18:00,301 --> 00:18:01,134
dinners by these pharmaceutical 
companies to take it to a real nice 

380
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:04,254
restaurant,
buy steak and champagne potato and 

381
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:08,820
everybody could have a drink.
And you know,

382
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:13,330
they would be so willing to be like very
complimentary of this medication.

383
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,193
Why?
I know a girl took this and it really 

384
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:18,280
helped her a lot.
And you doctor Kinesin and I'm like,

385
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,123
I was in that generation to where I got 
taken out to five star restaurants in 

386
00:18:23,731 --> 00:18:24,570
Manhattan all the time.

387
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,403
It's by you stuff,
it feels really good because you're 

388
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:29,670
making like 20 grand a year working your
ass off.

389
00:18:29,671 --> 00:18:33,030
And so when someone takes you to a fancy
restaurant with your friends,

390
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,930
but you could convince yourself that 
it's not actually going to,

391
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,833
you know,
that you're an intellectual and you're 

392
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:39,174
gonna make your own decisions.
But all of the data suggest otherwise 

393
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:46,110
that you are unduly influenced by that 
kind of courtship behavior.

394
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,180
And it's,
it's true.

395
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:49,890
So we have this like,
you know,

396
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:50,724
sort of collusion on the part of the 
doctor and the patients to support 

397
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,060
industry interests over any,
any sort of,

398
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,633
I know,
shred of a scientific or evidence based 

399
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:01,284
process for really diagnosing someone,
especially when we're talking about 

400
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,184
something that is so subjective where 
it's not like a broken arm or a like a 

401
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,990
Joe,
you've got a broken arm.

402
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:12,840
Like I know what to do,
we're going to set your arm in a cast.

403
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,910
It's like,
so you're feeling down,

404
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,670
hey man.
Right.

405
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,920
They even ask you like,
does this,

406
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:20,754
this does a normal cycle,
like I guess like someone who's really 

407
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:23,784
good wood,
but is your diet and your sleep 

408
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:27,684
patterns,
is that a consideration before they 

409
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:32,100
prescribe medication medication?
No.

410
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:33,270
In fact,
um,

411
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,283
most sorta turncoat doctors like me will
tell you that we have one hour of 

412
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:43,860
nutrition education in all of our 
medical school and residency training.

413
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,703
One keeping you a turncoat or you like 
considered like a rat bad person in the 

414
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:49,684
industry.
I'm not welcome in the highly calls 

415
00:19:51,211 --> 00:19:52,120
anymore.
Now I lost,

416
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:55,370
saw my faculty positions and yeah.

417
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:03,600
Um,
because I guess the kind of science that

418
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,330
I bring to the table,
which is not my own,

419
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:07,970
I don't have any original ideas,
but I,

420
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,913
I am really good I think at curating 
information and collecting it and 

421
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,410
synthesizing it,
presenting it,

422
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:14,244
right.
So what I have to shine a light on is 

423
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,630
very inconvenient,
um,

424
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:23,810
science for industry interest but also 
for conventional practice because,

425
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,223
you know,
I don't prescribe medication anymore 

426
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:29,800
under any circumstances ever.
Um,

427
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:34,850
but I do have an entire practice devoted
to taking people off of medication.

428
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,083
So I have sort of my thing,
and it's a lot based on lifestyle 

429
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:41,490
changes you mentioned,
right?

430
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,893
If you don't have your methodology as an
alternative to prescribing and you're 

431
00:20:46,771 --> 00:20:48,040
going to what a

432
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,450
lot of the science says that condemns 
the pharmaceutical approach,

433
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,300
what are you going to do instead?
You just invested $200,000

434
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:56,740
of debt,
blood,

435
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:57,610
sweat,
and tears,

436
00:20:57,611 --> 00:21:00,150
indentured servitude for like a decade 
of your training.

437
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:01,930
You're just going to give that up,
you know?

438
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:02,764
So it's a lot to expect.
The average psychiatrist who 

439
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,270
acknowledge,
you know,

440
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:11,020
anything beyond what's called like 
consensus medicine.

441
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:14,860
It's called that because it doesn't even
have a connection to the evidence.

442
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:15,694
It's not evidence based.
It's just they all agree on it and 

443
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:19,660
they're just going to keep doing it.
You know?

444
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,360
So this consensus medicine,
like in psychiatry,

445
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:26,710
there's kind of like this understanding 
that you don't criticize the system that

446
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:29,440
everybody's operating under.
He just work within that system.

447
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,090
Yeah.
Why would you bother?

448
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,953
You know,
cause just going to get you to be 

449
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:37,390
uncomfortable for you is going to get 
you in trouble and there's no incentive.

450
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:38,224
You know?
Like I read more science than probably 

451
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:40,594
all my conventional colleagues put 
together because I have a lot of 

452
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:45,730
incentive to do so because I'm 
practicing outside of the,

453
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,610
you know,
the gold standard so to speak.

454
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:52,240
So when you're in the fold,
why would you bother reading science?

455
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:54,820
Who Cares?
You just do what you are taught to do.

456
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:56,170
Don't question it.
You know?

457
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,420
So it's,
you know,

458
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,403
the reason that lifestyle is not 
presented as a relevant factor in 

459
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:10,081
conventional medicine is because it 
flies in the face of the whole model,

460
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,253
right?
Like the model is still a gene based 

461
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:15,460
model.
It's still are born with it.

462
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,770
You know,
it's like coddling the victim.

463
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:19,240
There's nothing you can do about it.

464
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,073
So you know,
you better just be a good boy and take 

465
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:25,960
your medication is the only thing you 
can do because diet doesn't matter,

466
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,790
you know,
whether you're,

467
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,010
you know,
huffing fumes through your window.

468
00:22:30,011 --> 00:22:30,844
It doesn't matter whether you're eating 
six cans of tuna day and mercury 

469
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:34,630
poisoning yourself,
does it,

470
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:38,500
none of that matters really.
Maybe it's like of minor interest,

471
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:43,420
but the real problem is your inborn 
genetic chemical imbalance,

472
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,670
right?
So if that is the premise,

473
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:46,504
and it's not just in psychiatry,
it's in all of medicine is gene based 

474
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:50,104
determinism,
freeze Pharma to offer the only 

475
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:57,040
solution.
And it actually validates people on some

476
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:59,140
level as the victim,
right?

477
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:02,410
So like a lot of people want to feel 
weirdly,

478
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,780
um,
you know,

479
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:07,300
like their own victimization.
It feels comfortable.

480
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,483
And even though there's science that 
supports that having a healthy nutrient 

481
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:12,904
dense diet allows your body to produce 
the all the healthy hormones and 

482
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:20,320
chemicals and neurotransmitters and all 
of that.

483
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,840
And then along with exercise,
which also increases,

484
00:23:22,841 --> 00:23:23,674
it is having,
there were studies also that show that 

485
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:28,630
exercise,
regular aerobics exercise in particular,

486
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:29,763
um,
it does as much to treat depression as 

487
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:33,370
ssrs

488
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,593
more,
more actually because the efficacy of 

489
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:39,740
most antidepressants is pretty 
embarrassing.

490
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,790
Like,
you know,

491
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:44,660
to be frank because if you really dig 
into the literature,

492
00:23:44,661 --> 00:23:47,240
it's what you think it is.
Um,

493
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:49,640
in terms of really being a viable 
treatment option,

494
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:54,590
so many of these natural alternatives 
like far out pace,

495
00:23:54,591 --> 00:23:57,860
I mean things even like herbs like 
Tumeric or acupuncture,

496
00:23:57,861 --> 00:23:59,120
Yoga,
you know,

497
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:01,700
exercise.
And that's just a single intervention.

498
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:04,520
So there's nothing miraculous about my 
approach.

499
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:05,354
It's basically just putting all those 
things together at once for like a 

500
00:24:08,061 --> 00:24:08,894
synergistic effect.
So you can send your body and mind is 

501
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:13,520
like a signal of safety,
right?

502
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,550
And it works,
right?

503
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:17,384
So if you're just doing one of those 
things in isolation and even one of 

504
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:23,630
those things is more effective than you 
know,

505
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,493
it's really,
it really comes down to the mindset 

506
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:27,044
because if you wanted an a pill,
it's going to be challenging for you to 

507
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:32,990
get results through effort or something 
behavioral.

508
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,453
So the mindset piece has become a real 
focus for me as being maybe the most 

509
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:42,311
important determinant of what's going to
be an effective intervention piece.

510
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,823
Meaning meaning what you believe like 
about health and if you want to believe 

511
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:50,204
that you're broken and that you know,
chemicals aren't necessary to manage 

512
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:55,560
your scary body.

513
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,530
I've changed a lot of smart people that 
believe that.

514
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,210
I have a friend,
she's a scientist,

515
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:00,044
she's very smart,
she's on antidepressants and if you 

516
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:02,174
talked to her,
she will argue to the death and these 

517
00:25:03,831 --> 00:25:06,710
are critical for her life and that she 
needs him.

518
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:07,544
And she has some sort of a brain 
imbalance and it's no different than 

519
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,150
having you know,
some other organ in your body.

520
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:14,540
It doesn't function properly and you 
need medication for that.

521
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,403
We've been told,

522
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,740
I was told that and I believe that for 
sure.

523
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:19,810
You know,
the analogy is often,

524
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:22,750
well it's like insulin to a diabetic.
It's the same thing.

525
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:27,700
And the more you challenge that you're 
stigmatizing mental illness and how dare

526
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:28,211
you,
you know,

527
00:25:28,211 --> 00:25:30,460
I've been accused.
Yeah,

528
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:35,490
I've been accused of shaming women,
which is of course the last,

529
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:38,620
you know,
all I care about is,

530
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:42,700
is empowering women around their health.
Literally I wake up every single day and

531
00:25:42,701 --> 00:25:45,760
devote my life to that purpose.
Like the last thing I have any intention

532
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,780
of doing is shaming anyone who's made 
this decision.

533
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,813
Well,
it's just whenever something make 

534
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:50,870
someone uncomfortable with their 
choices,

535
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,810
they immediately want to turn someone 
else into a,

536
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:56,180
an aggressor or someone who is 
victimizing them.

537
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,351
But this,
uh,

538
00:25:57,351 --> 00:26:01,390
this woman that I'm friends with,
it's unfortunate because I feel like,

539
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:02,690
uh,
if she exercised,

540
00:26:02,691 --> 00:26:05,090
at least she would know that she doesn't
exercise.

541
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:05,924
So if you don't exercise,
do you don't really know if that would 

542
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:08,654
help.
Right.

543
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,063
You know,
but I hate to be that guy because I 

544
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:12,990
already am,
you know,

545
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,020
like that proselytizing.
You got to work out.

546
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:16,550
God,
that's fucking annoying.

547
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,930
It's like the crossfit person or the 
proselytizing Vegan or whatever,

548
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:25,610
a new cult member.
You just want to talk forever about it.

549
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,310
Still never going to convince someone 
why people to hate you.

550
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,990
It's true.
And it's like the,

551
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:31,760
you know,
you bring a horse to water thing,

552
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:32,840
you know,
you can't,

553
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,200
can't make it happen of course.
But there is more.

554
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,043
Yeah.

555
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,610
Now,
um,

556
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,300
then I think ever before,
like people are ready and once they have

557
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,060
the information it's like,
you know,

558
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,570
usually like,
and then they just transferred.

559
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,573
Well,
these conversations are happening now 

560
00:26:47,451 --> 00:26:49,340
more and more with people,
um,

561
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:52,130
where they're starting to look at like,
what,

562
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,590
what is it in my life that's causing me 
stress?

563
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,603
What is it in my life that is a 
depleting my sleep patterns or my 

564
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:00,884
health?
Have I ever gotten my blood test done 

565
00:27:02,691 --> 00:27:04,430
and find out where my nutrient levels 
are?

566
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,290
Yes.
And you know,

567
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:11,291
and everybody's nutrient needs are very 
different biologically.

568
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:13,730
People like people are going to respond 
differently to drugs.

569
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,650
People are gonna respond differently to 
food.

570
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,903
It's just we,
we come from different parts of the 

571
00:27:18,021 --> 00:27:19,700
world and some people need different 
stuff.

572
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,673
And this is being called like an of one 
medicine and meaning like meaning the 

573
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:27,760
number of people in a study.
So like the phrases and of one medicine,

574
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:29,830
because we're beginning to understand 
exactly what you're saying,

575
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:32,650
which is that it's you,
this is your thing.

576
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,860
This is your journey.
This is very specific to you,

577
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:36,880
right?
So like,

578
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,640
you know,
your depression let's say,

579
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,700
could be because you have a b,
12 deficiency.

580
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:44,800
It could be because you have low thyroid
function.

581
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,020
It could be because you're taking birth 
control.

582
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,830
It could be because you know your dog 
died.

583
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:53,410
It could be because you have a shitty 
job that you hate.

584
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,510
It could be because your marriage has to
go.

585
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:59,230
And it could be because you're ready for
some psycho spiritual emergence,

586
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:00,064
you know,
and you are the only one who really 

587
00:28:02,171 --> 00:28:03,004
knows and who really can figure it out.
But we on the conventional side of 

588
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:09,430
things,
seek to depersonalize it.

589
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,660
So it's,
it's not you,

590
00:28:10,661 --> 00:28:11,494
it has nothing to do with you.
It's just a chemical process that's 

591
00:28:13,571 --> 00:28:17,460
unfolding and you need this one size 
fits all intervention.

592
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,070
It's very disingenuous,
but it's also a super common.

593
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,170
Isn't that weird that that everyone,
I mean there's the access to the data is

594
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:27,480
there for everybody.
It's there for psychiatrists as well.

595
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,930
Like they would know the efficiency or 
the effectiveness rather of exercise.

596
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,240
Right.

597
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,073
But that's what I'm saying.
It's really coming down to like almost 

598
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:39,350
religious level belief systems.
Like either you believe,

599
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,630
right,
which I used to ps.

600
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,230
Either you believe that we're sort of 
machines,

601
00:28:45,231 --> 00:28:46,490
right?
Like as Alan Watts would say,

602
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,970
we're like flesh robots on a dead rock 
floating in the middle of nowhere.

603
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
So everything is purposeless and random 
and it's just bad luck and bad genes.

604
00:28:55,431 --> 00:28:56,264
And you know,
it's like the other shoe could fall at 

605
00:28:57,951 --> 00:28:58,784
any moment and life is just the hustle 
and you're just trying to survive and 

606
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,390
you got to avail yourself of real 
medicine,

607
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,463
which is pharmaceutical medicines.
The only legit option and you just got 

608
00:29:09,501 --> 00:29:10,334
to do it and you know what you want some
credit for even having the courage to 

609
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,480
actually take the steps to take your 
meds.

610
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:16,520
Right?
So that's one mindset.

611
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,120
And then the other,
which is I believe growing,

612
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:24,770
um,
is that we have no idea what we're doing

613
00:29:24,771 --> 00:29:25,670
scientifically.

614
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,710
And we're just looking through the 
keyhole.

615
00:29:27,711 --> 00:29:28,544
And Science is a process.
It's not like a destination where the 

616
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:33,050
science is settled.
My favorite phrase,

617
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,200
so you know,
the body itself has this,

618
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:37,034
you know,
chiropractors call it vitalism like has 

619
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:43,301
this innate wisdom and it doesn't make 
mistakes.

620
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,320
Like it doesn't mess up.
Every single thing your body is doing is

621
00:29:47,321 --> 00:29:50,710
in wise response to a perceived,
you know,

622
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:51,670
stimulus,
right?

623
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,910
And Diseases of course,
cancer,

624
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,140
no,
no.

625
00:29:56,141 --> 00:29:58,900
It would include without exception,
without an,

626
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,530
I could explain what I mean by that,
but,

627
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,051
but,
right,

628
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:06,100
so,
so if I have an ache or a pain or I,

629
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,730
my hair's falling out or I have a tumor 
growing out of the side of my body,

630
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,910
my first response it's possible could be
curiosity.

631
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,910
Like it could be,
what is this about,

632
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,610
you know,
where am I off?

633
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,863
Right?
Because in like indigenous cultures for 

634
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:24,814
example,
illness is not like something that your 

635
00:30:27,491 --> 00:30:28,660
body is doing.

636
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,250
It's the,
you know,

637
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:34,030
sort of manifestation of things out of 
balance with you and your soul,

638
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,073
you know,
with you and the relationships in your 

639
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:39,340
life with you and nature and maybe the 
collective itself.

640
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,503
So it's this expression,
it's this physical manifestation of 

641
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:43,414
something much deeper that has roots.
And until you understand what those 

642
00:30:46,571 --> 00:30:48,940
roots are for you,
you won't resolve it.

643
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,863
Right?
Serious errors like birth defects and 

644
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:52,234
things along those lines.
That's not like a wise response to 

645
00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:55,151
anything,
right?

646
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:57,700
It's an error.
It's a good question.

647
00:30:57,701 --> 00:30:58,534
You know,
the,

648
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,373
the sort of like congenital question,
like if you're just like born without a 

649
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:04,234
leg,
I mean you could take it to the extent 

650
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,450
where you say,
okay,

651
00:31:07,451 --> 00:31:10,930
so what drove the birth defect?
Whether it was some sort of,

652
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:11,891
you know,
okay,

653
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:15,100
so let's back up a second because Epi 
genetics,

654
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:15,963
right?
Is the word de jure for beyond or above 

655
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:22,390
actually technically jeans,
right?

656
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,223
So there's the genes are interesting,
but perhaps as insignificant as like 1% 

657
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:28,870
of what makes us sick,
right?

658
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,780
Or well,
we never studied what makes us well it's

659
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:32,614
like a total black box.
But epigenetics is like how does the 

660
00:31:35,681 --> 00:31:37,660
environment impact our genes?
Right?

661
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:40,240
So you could argue that a lot of 
congenital,

662
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,283
you know,
sort of malformations and things like 

663
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:43,144
that because this was an area of study 
for me when I was prescribing to 

664
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:46,960
pregnant women,
which believe it or not,

665
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,670
was my specialty prescribing psychiatric
meds to two pregnant women.

666
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,903
Um,
that it is a risk in response to that 

667
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:56,374
exposure.
And it's the body's method of adapting 

668
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,150
to an exposure or is it just an error?
Like if someone's born without a leg,

669
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,253
what kind of adaptation is that?
It seems like so just some sort of a 

670
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:08,860
genetic error.
No,

671
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,770
it depends how you want to look at it.
I mean,

672
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:12,604
to me there are no errors because the 
body is responding to a perceived 

673
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:18,670
stimulus.
Now if you throw a lot of toxicity,

674
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,290
you know,
in the way of your body,

675
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:23,980
there may be a limit to which a can or 
will accommodate.

676
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,293
Right?
Cause like something confusing for me 

677
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,440
was at one point I was reflecting on the
fact that,

678
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,303
you know,
we've had all of these environmental 

679
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:34,210
exposures for like about a hundred 
hundred and 50 years.

680
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:36,970
Like since the industrial revolution,
right?

681
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,090
So we like live totally different lives 
now is all

682
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,943
these toxic exposures that we sit all 
day and we don't sleep and we have 

683
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:48,200
Monsanto and all the rest pretty much 
for like the past 100 years or so.

684
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:53,060
We can adapt like my body is adapting 
within the hours that were,

685
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,050
you know,
hanging out.

686
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:58,700
So why would it not have adapted over 
the past 100 years?

687
00:32:58,701 --> 00:32:59,534
And like a Paleo argument is like we've 
evolves the same way for 95% of our 

688
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:06,374
evolution and in now we just haven't 
taken enough time to evolve to catch up 

689
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:14,420
with today's modern influences.
Right.

690
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:15,763
But I actually think we're not meant to 
accommodate this and we will self 

691
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:21,860
extinguish.
Like if we don't course correct,

692
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:22,694
which I have faith we will do,
but we're not meant to adapt to this 

693
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:28,570
kind of lifestyle.
Yeah,

694
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,680
exactly.
Chemicals,

695
00:33:30,681 --> 00:33:33,410
you know of people if we don't course 
correct,

696
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,850
I think we will.
And I think it's pretty much like,

697
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,660
I think even though we could 
biologically adapt,

698
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,823
I think we won't because there is like a
cosmic intelligence that is holding us 

699
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:53,111
accountable to a certain level of 
respect for this human organism.

700
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:56,060
A certain level of respect for the 
privilege of being alive.

701
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,700
You know?
And the way we're living today,

702
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:03,050
just like trashing ourselves and 
trashing this planet is in,

703
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,810
is a violation.
So I dunno,

704
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,860
I just,
it's like a subtle point,

705
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:09,500
but I think the point is we're not going
to adapt,

706
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:11,270
so don't wait for it.
You know,

707
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,730
and we're just going to get sicker and 
sicker and sicker and die and,

708
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:17,000
and perhaps that is the most intelligent
response.

709
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:18,830
Doom and gloom.
No,

710
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:23,831
I said it's going to get better.
Remember the sacrifice for productivity,

711
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,093
the daily sacrifice for productivity 
that comes at the expense of health and 

712
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:30,650
happiness is the norm.
You know,

713
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,493
that's what a lot of people deal with.
They deal with having bills and like as 

714
00:34:36,081 --> 00:34:36,914
you were pointing about,
pointing out about exorbitant medical 

715
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:39,870
bills,
right?

716
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,703
I mean,
so many people that are in the medical 

717
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:42,374
industry start their practice or start 
practicing being a doctor of 

718
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:49,100
professional doctor with a quarter 
million dollar debt.

719
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,720
Right?
Which is crazy.

720
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,550
It's so much money.
It's so crazy.

721
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,703
It's so what a terrible idea.
Like what's almost mandatory for any 

722
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:00,830
civilization?
Well,

723
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:01,664
you need health care for sure.
You need to be able to take care of 

724
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:04,370
people.
I got an idea.

725
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,473
Let's take those people that you need to
make these critical decisions to save 

726
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:08,744
your life and let's fuck them over.
Let's saddle those people up with crazy 

727
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:15,420
debt and leave them trapped in a world 
of stress.

728
00:35:15,421 --> 00:35:18,050
And I got an even better idea when 
they're going through the residency.

729
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,580
Let's not let them sleep.
Right?

730
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,073
Right.
Keeping caffeinated sugar and work and 

731
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:24,110
give them pills.
Give them,

732
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,450
giving them amphetamines.
You know,

733
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,370
give him adderall.
You need a prescription,

734
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:30,500
sally,
are you tired Sally?

735
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,470
I got a little pick me up.
It's called adderall sweetie.

736
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,510
It's not your fault.
You've got Adhd,

737
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,670
d s t u P

738
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,400
qrs.
But that's how it's like a hazing.

739
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,520
It's a hazing process,
not unlike the military.

740
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:45,271
Right.
You know,

741
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:47,670
so that you remain loyal.
I mean,

742
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:50,520
that's obviously one perspective on it,
but this is what I'm saying,

743
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:52,470
right?
Like I was $200,000

744
00:35:52,471 --> 00:35:53,304
in debt.
It took a lot for me to just like jump 

745
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,560
ship and say,
okay,

746
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,420
whatever.
I,

747
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,290
you know,
invested that and I'm just going to walk

748
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:00,240
away from it.
Most people,

749
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,640
you know,
are not in a position to do that.

750
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:04,390
And perhaps that's part of the design.
I Dunno.

751
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,030
Well I don't,
even if it's not designed,

752
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,893
it's a very efficient,
efficient survival mechanism for the 

753
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:10,190
industry.
You know,

754
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,043
it just seems like one of the worst ways
for someone to start a career in taking 

755
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:17,400
care of people's,
to be all fucked up themselves,

756
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,740
but they need to be broken down in that 
way to stay in line.

757
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,830
And that's kind of,
it's just basic,

758
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:23,664
you know,
sort of hierarchical systems work this 

759
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:27,234
way.
There is no conspiracy or is it people 

760
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:30,624
just taking advantage of this need and 
being greedy and just charging 

761
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:35,994
exorbitant amounts of money and having 
the whole thing subsidized by the 

762
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:40,890
government.
So that could be expensive.

763
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:41,724
And then the whole thing is crazy.
And also here's the big one that a lot 

764
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:45,990
of people,
maybe if you're a kid,

765
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:51,020
you're not aware of this,
your student loans you til you're dead.

766
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,750
You cannot get out of those fuckers.
Like you can get out.

767
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:56,400
You could,
you could buy Ferrari,

768
00:36:56,401 --> 00:36:59,100
you could be stupid and buy a Ferrari 
and go God damn it,

769
00:36:59,101 --> 00:36:59,934
I can't afford this car.
And you go bankrupt and they will allow 

770
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:04,460
you to go bankrupt.
Right.

771
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,910
That's that.
That can happen.

772
00:37:05,911 --> 00:37:08,040
You can have a business,
make terrible decisions,

773
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:08,874
lose all your money would go bankrupt 
and literally be absolved of your debt 

774
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:14,400
except your student loans.

775
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,720
That shit is into your DNA.
They keep you,

776
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,510
you have to pay that.
You have to,

777
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,583
it's crazy.
It's so nuts how much money it is when 

778
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:30,561
you find out what the student loan 
industry is in this country and how much

779
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:32,760
money children go,
oh,

780
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:34,470
you're a fucking child when you're 18 
years old,

781
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:35,304
right?
So you make some ridiculous decision to 

782
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:37,734
go to some school and you get some grant
or you get some sort of scholarship and 

783
00:37:41,131 --> 00:37:41,964
then the rest of it you're going to get 
loans or whatever the hell your 

784
00:37:44,191 --> 00:37:45,024
situation is.
And then you get out of four years and 

785
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,880
then you go and do your masters.
You go and do some graduate work.

786
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,410
Ah,
you're funds,

787
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,960
you're fucked,
you're so broke.

788
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,000
And then if you get out,
what are the odds?

789
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,310
You even get a job in your field.
You know,

790
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,473
you have to scramble to try to make some
money and then you have this never 

791
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:08,811
ending pool of debt that you have to 
suck a little bit out of every month.

792
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,350
It's like living for the oasis on the 
horizon,

793
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,570
but that's what we do in this country.
You know?

794
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:18,180
We just are constantly waiting for it to
feel okay.

795
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:20,070
Constantly waiting to until we get 
there.

796
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:22,980
We're not getting there.
I think that free education,

797
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,883
if it would be possible,
if it is possible to do it without 

798
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:29,280
ruining the educational system,
if it's not already ruined,

799
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,533
if it is possible to do that,
it'd be like one of the best things we 

800
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:33,624
could ever do for young people.
Just keep them from being saddled down 

801
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:40,630
with some bullshit that you have to keep
with you for the rest of your life.

802
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,210
Say you like are handicapped out the 
gate.

803
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,460
Yeah,
it's crazy and it also,

804
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:46,294
it inhibits any risk taking it.
You're going to have any chance like to 

805
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:52,870
jump ship and try something new.
Like maybe you're doing something,

806
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:55,060
but all the while you have this idea of 
God,

807
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:57,130
I thank think this is really what I'm 
supposed to be doing.

808
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,260
I'm always thinking about it.
I got to take a chance,

809
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,273
but I have this fucking debt and the 
only way to really pay this debt off is 

810
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,780
if I enter into this same,
that's it.

811
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,783
Oh,
that's a really important point because 

812
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:10,480
if you sort of look across dimensions 
culturally,

813
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,130
they're all geared towards supporting a 
certain kind of mindset and mentality,

814
00:39:15,131 --> 00:39:17,230
which is productivity oriented,
which is,

815
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,080
you know,
capitalism and consumer supportive.

816
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,490
Um,
in terms of that,

817
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,010
you know,
sort of financial apparatus.

818
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,310
And so the things and elements,
you know,

819
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,260
like Graham Hancock has talked about 
this,

820
00:39:29,261 --> 00:39:31,450
you know,
the elements that are convenient to that

821
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:32,284
paradigm,
including psychiatric meds and even 

822
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,263
alcohol on some level,
like these more sort of suppressive 

823
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,690
consciousness,
suppressive tools are sanctioned.

824
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,990
Right.
But the things that would encourage risk

825
00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:46,540
taking and courage,
creative expression and courage,

826
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:47,374
you know,
sort of consciousness expansion are 

827
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,470
demonized her,
you know,

828
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,730
rendered illegal because they're 
inconvenient to the paradigm,

829
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:55,480
I guess.

830
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,313
But honestly,
I think it's a victim of circumstance 

831
00:39:58,061 --> 00:39:59,130
more than anything.
When I,

832
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,970
I don't,
I'm not necessarily,

833
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:05,710
I believe that when the psychedelic act 
of 1970 was put into play,

834
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:06,544
it was clearly put it into play because 
they were trying to arrest people that 

835
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:12,400
were in the civil rights movement and 
the antiwar movement.

836
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:13,234
That's been proven.
It's been proven that there was a 

837
00:40:14,171 --> 00:40:15,004
collusion and that what they were trying
to do was make it so that they could go 

838
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:21,520
after these people in the civil rights 
movement go after these people that were

839
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:25,660
in the antiwar movement and they would 
catch them for drugs and arrest them and

840
00:40:25,661 --> 00:40:30,070
they would cripple these movements.
And this is all like documented,

841
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:34,450
real clear by the Nixon administration.
The reason why they passed that sweeping

842
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:35,284
psychedelics act of 1970 which covered a
lot of stuff that's not even 

843
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:38,800
psychoactive.

844
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,000
They didn't even know what they're 
doing.

845
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,960
And they miss some of the big ones.
They missed like five methoxy DMT,

846
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:45,760
which is more than most potent 
psychedelic drugs.

847
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:46,594
Don't demand just a few years ago used 
to be able to buy that shit online from 

848
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,810
a chemical companies.
They would give you like a jug of it.

849
00:40:52,811 --> 00:40:53,644
They could get a whole city high for a 
month and you could go buy it with a 

850
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:59,440
credit card.
Not that I know of anybody who did it.

851
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:00,603
And I certainly didn't.
And I definitely still still don't have 

852
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:03,520
any of it.
But if I did,

853
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,650
it's not even illegal.
That's what's crazy.

854
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,680
It's like they made stuff that was like 
a normal part of human use for thousands

855
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,750
and thousands of years that made it 
highly illegal.

856
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:14,703
And they did it at a time when they were
trying to break down these people that 

857
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:21,430
we're trying to change society.

858
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:24,250
Right?
So that was 1970 but along the way,

859
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:29,251
I think what's really happened is it 
became a matter of financial risk.

860
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,603
Like marijuana is a big one,
like financial risk of the 

861
00:41:33,111 --> 00:41:33,944
pharmaceutical drug companies.
If they found out that there's so many 

862
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:38,360
different things that marijuana get 
help,

863
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,630
whether it is a people's appetite or 
certain arthritic conditions,

864
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:47,160
or you can go down the list,
uh,

865
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,263
kids with epilepsy,
it's a huge factor on children with 

866
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:53,210
autism,
especially edible marijuana,

867
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,223
all these different things,
all these different things that it 

868
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:56,204
treats.
If that was made legal and people 

869
00:41:57,981 --> 00:42:01,610
started turning to that and exercise and
it'll a holistic approach,

870
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:02,743
it would cost the pharmaceutical 
companies literally billions of dollars 

871
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:08,450
a year.
So I think that's the big conspiracy.

872
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:13,160
I think it's a,
it's not really a paradigm consciousness

873
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,250
sort of a thing.
As much as it's a financial thing.

874
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,040
I don't think the people that don't 
totally related,

875
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:20,803
but I don't think the people that are 
suppressing it or even aware of the 

876
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:23,670
effects.

877
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,371
I agree.
No,

878
00:42:24,371 --> 00:42:27,910
I would just part of the master puppet 
string puller.

879
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,203
It's,
it's like this organism that's just 

880
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:33,130
moved only in one direction,
you know?

881
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,140
Yes.
Money toward,

882
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,993
yeah.
The same reason why also involved in 

883
00:42:37,001 --> 00:42:37,834
trying to keep these drugs illegal.
You have prison guard unions because 

884
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:44,640
they want to keep their money coming in.
Do you have police unions?

885
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,593
I mean there's a lot of that where you 
find lobbying by these unlikely groups 

886
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:50,160
and you're like,
I don't understand why,

887
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,420
and then you go,
oh,

888
00:42:51,421 --> 00:42:52,750
they just want to make more money.
Right?

889
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,080
Like they're more than willing to lock 
people up.

890
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,123
They're more than willing to demonize 
helpful things that grow naturally and 

891
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:02,850
have virtually no negative effects in 
terms of like your health,

892
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,530
things like marijuana.

893
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,670
Totally.
I mean that's,

894
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,350
that's why I,
you know,

895
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,184
when I speak about this,
because I used to be really in like 

896
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:12,360
warrior mode on this,
um,

897
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,560
topic.
Huh?

898
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,401
How so?
Like,

899
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:15,890
what do you mean by warrior?
I just thought,

900
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,740
okay.
Like I've,

901
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,000
you know,
once I woke up,

902
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,710
whatever it was almost 10 years ago.

903
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,230
Do you ever use Hashtag woke,
do you have a right to and no.

904
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,183
No.
Okay.

905
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,820
Should I know it's a joke with the kids 
today.

906
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,630
Hashtag woke or Hashtag woke AAF.
I'm old.

907
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,270
I'm old too.
Okay.

908
00:43:32,271 --> 00:43:33,660
Half that's good.
Woke as fuck.

909
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,321
Yeah.
Thanks.

910
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:38,640
I got that.
I'm a quick study.

911
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,713
So when you,
when you became aware of what I became 

912
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,633
aware,
I was pissed.

913
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,580
What was,
was it a gradual process?

914
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:45,443
No,

915
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:47,020
no.
I um,

916
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,960
I would,
I got like sick,

917
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:51,070
I guess.
Uh,

918
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:51,983
wasn't very dramatic.
But my big sob story is that I was 

919
00:43:53,561 --> 00:43:55,420
diagnosed with my,
my first health condition,

920
00:43:55,421 --> 00:43:58,300
which is an autoimmune disorder after my
first pregnancy.

921
00:43:58,301 --> 00:43:59,330
Hashimoto's.
Oh,

922
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,280
I have the,
Oh,

923
00:44:00,281 --> 00:44:01,114
really?
Yes.

924
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,380
Oh,
that's interesting.

925
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:05,080
My Dad and my brother do.
My mom has it also,

926
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:05,914
I would just like not as common in men,
but probably because nobody's looking 

927
00:44:08,261 --> 00:44:09,790
for it.
Um,

928
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,163
yeah.
So I was diagnosed with that and I just 

929
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:13,684
had this intuitive sense that I wasn't 
going to go to a conventional doctor 

930
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:19,200
even though I had never ever,
you know,

931
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,370
done anything but dismiss alternative 
medicine.

932
00:44:21,371 --> 00:44:24,340
Like I was hard core into the 
pharmaceutical model,

933
00:44:24,341 --> 00:44:27,220
very into science it from that 
perspective.

934
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,510
Right.
And so I,

935
00:44:28,511 --> 00:44:29,344
um,
but I knew that all they had to offer 

936
00:44:30,761 --> 00:44:31,800
was,
and I,

937
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,430
I

938
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,620
had enough patients that never felt well
on it.

939
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,030
And so it's weird stuff.
Yeah.

940
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:37,883
Stuff for a while.
And then I switched to armour thyroid 

941
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,693
and a,
that's one reason why I got pissed at 

942
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:44,190
doctor drew when doctor drew was giving 
that,

943
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:45,300
um,
that,

944
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,253
uh,
when he was talking about Hillary 

945
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:51,390
Clinton and all of her health issues and
he was going over her prescription,

946
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:52,224
he was mocking the fact that she was on 
armour thyroid and he was saying that 

947
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,220
that's old.
That's an old way of treating him.

948
00:44:56,221 --> 00:44:58,080
Like he doesn't know what the fuck he's 
talking about.

949
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,603
He's absolutely wrong because I went 
through a bunch of different stuff and 

950
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:03,330
then when I took armor,
thyroid,

951
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,790
all of the symptoms went away.
Gone.

952
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:06,683
And that's what the data shows that 
people feel subjectively better on t 

953
00:45:08,671 --> 00:45:09,630
three containing.
Yeah.

954
00:45:09,631 --> 00:45:11,730
We'll explain what that is.
It comes from pig thyroid.

955
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,693
Yeah.
It's a glandular and he's not wrong 

956
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:17,510
because it is an old fashioned medicine 
wrong there.

957
00:45:17,511 --> 00:45:18,344
It's ineffective though.
He was talking about how outdated it is 

958
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,190
and that subject at all.
People feel better on it.

959
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:25,950
Yeah.
So I took that for something similar,

960
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,920
um,
called nature throid for a while.

961
00:45:28,921 --> 00:45:33,210
But I went to a naturopath because,
which is so funny that I did that,

962
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,250
you know,
at that time it sounds like a hippie.

963
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:38,760
Did you go to a place with like macrame 
and stuff?

964
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,180
Now?
It's really good friends.

965
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,660
Do you have any friends?
Very friendly.

966
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,550
Oh,
she's friendly.

967
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:44,410
Yeah.
Did she smell like,

968
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:45,990
but truly or incense?
Yes.

969
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:46,590
Oh,
she did.

970
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,390
Absolutely.
That was good.

971
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:49,980
That's,
that's it felt right.

972
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,990
Even that really struggling wrong at the
moment.

973
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,080
No I did.
And um,

974
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,023
she,
I put it into remission in the space of 

975
00:45:57,341 --> 00:46:00,550
like a year in my antibodies were like 
in the high two thousands,

976
00:46:00,551 --> 00:46:04,750
my Tsh was like 20 and I had to do to 
put it in remission.

977
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:07,030
So the same things I do with my 
patients.

978
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,103
So I initially just changed my diet.
So initially I just very simply at her 

979
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,790
recommendation and I'm Italian.
I grew up Italian,

980
00:46:15,791 --> 00:46:20,791
my mom's from Italy and I ate cheese and
bread of some variety,

981
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:25,600
like five times a day,
literally for my whole life.

982
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:26,710
Right.
So the two things,

983
00:46:26,711 --> 00:46:28,720
of course she asked me to take out where
gluten and dairy,

984
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:30,200
dammit.
So has it been,

985
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:33,580
it was a very amazing transition,
but I,

986
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:34,900
my early,
when was that?

987
00:46:34,901 --> 00:46:38,320
I started like pooping every day and 
hadn't ever done that in my whole life.

988
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,060
Thank you.
Thank you.

989
00:46:40,061 --> 00:46:42,880
These things that matter.
And so I was like,

990
00:46:42,881 --> 00:46:44,110
wow,
she must be on to something.

991
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,980
And then later I layered in other

992
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,800
stuff.
Yeah.

993
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,780
Well you eating a lot of vegetables at 
the time.

994
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:52,103
No,
I think it was more about what I took 

995
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:56,850
out then at that point then like what I 
put in.

996
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,230
But when I saw the change on paper,
I was like,

997
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,120
this is not even supposed to be 
possible.

998
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,193
This is literally not even,
we're not even taught that this is 

999
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:07,800
possible,
let alone that it has anything.

1000
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:08,963
You know,
they're putting autoimmune conditions 

1001
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:11,700
into remission,
has anything to do with diet.

1002
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:12,723
Right.
And so I was really indignant and I've 

1003
00:47:14,781 --> 00:47:18,020
always been a science nut.
I've always spent Saturday,

1004
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:20,060
you know,
like a good four hours every Saturday on

1005
00:47:20,061 --> 00:47:22,130
pub med.
Of course I'm looking at different stuff

1006
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,620
over time,
but I went to pub med and I was like,

1007
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:25,454
what else did I learn?
And I was like on an obsessive rampage 

1008
00:47:28,251 --> 00:47:29,084
for like a good couple of years and 
that's when I just turned over every 

1009
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:34,150
stone.
Like everything,

1010
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,013
every sacred cow,
whether all these meds we were talking 

1011
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:38,884
about like you know,
statens or acid blockers are 

1012
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:42,130
antibiotics.

1013
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,173
I then I got onto psych meds and then I 
started to look at the science 

1014
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:50,440
supporting a very different kind of 
perspective on,

1015
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:51,274
you know,
this interconnected model and the gut 

1016
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:53,044
microbiome and you know,
sort of the impact of belief on our 

1017
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,053
biology that we can sort of like 
reprogram our hardware with our 

1018
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:02,524
software,
which is like we're the only species 

1019
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:05,800
that can really do that.
Um,

1020
00:48:05,801 --> 00:48:08,440
that we can literally change.
Yeah,

1021
00:48:08,441 --> 00:48:10,000
exactly.
And,

1022
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,890
but also interacts with your body and 
then you change your body.

1023
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,670
You literally change your body.
So what did you do to do that?

1024
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:22,990
Like what methods?
So I was very reluctant to meditate.

1025
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,930
I was an atheist,
my whole like a belligerent,

1026
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,480
you know,
sort of like Dawkins level,

1027
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:29,920
atheist,
um,

1028
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:33,070
my whole life because I was a science 
worshiper and I was like,

1029
00:48:33,071 --> 00:48:34,030
well,
you know,

1030
00:48:34,031 --> 00:48:34,864
spirituality and religion is for weak 
people who like need to believe in some 

1031
00:48:38,621 --> 00:48:40,910
fairytale to make them feel better about

1032
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,430
typical New Yorker,
New York liberal coming at Ya,

1033
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,980
New York liberals.
Scientists.

1034
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:48,430
Exactly.
Well,

1035
00:48:48,431 --> 00:48:49,450
it's scientism,
right?

1036
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,510
It literally is the Church of,
of science.

1037
00:48:52,511 --> 00:48:54,040
And so,
you know,

1038
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:56,320
when I had this crisis of faith,
so to speak,

1039
00:48:56,321 --> 00:49:01,150
like I was lost for a long time because 
science had sort of,

1040
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:03,640
you know,
or what I believed has sort of failed me

1041
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:08,641
in some ways and then I didn't have,
I don't know what the readiness to start

1042
00:49:09,731 --> 00:49:10,564
meditating or find out what you know 
people were talking about when it comes 

1043
00:49:13,581 --> 00:49:16,120
to spirituality.
Although I followed the literature,

1044
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:19,780
so like I read the literature on 
meditation and epigenetic expression for

1045
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:22,360
years and years and years and I used to 
tell my patients to do it,

1046
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:28,320
but I didn't do it and hold you back 
because I liked feeling stressed out.

1047
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,050
Yeah.
When you don't do something,

1048
00:49:32,051 --> 00:49:34,420
you're not doing it because you like 
actually being sick.

1049
00:49:34,421 --> 00:49:37,180
You like how you're feeling,
you're invested in it.

1050
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:40,210
Is it that you like or that your 
addictive familiar in that?

1051
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:41,420
Yeah,
it's comfortable

1052
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,753
and the unknown for some of my patients,
the meditation piece is the last part 

1053
00:49:46,211 --> 00:49:47,044
because they know it's going to be the 
game changer and they're not ready for 

1054
00:49:48,971 --> 00:49:50,950
everything to just be totally 
reconfigured.

1055
00:49:50,951 --> 00:49:52,830
They're not ready for that level of 
transformation.

1056
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:54,013
What they say too about sometimes people
that are addicted to cigarettes that 

1057
00:49:56,981 --> 00:50:00,250
you're almost addicted to the idea that 
you're doing something bad or yourself.

1058
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,800
You're addicted to that rush of being 
naughty.

1059
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,100
Yeah.
Oh,

1060
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:06,260
so good.
Oh,

1061
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:07,790
so good.
It confirms,

1062
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,200
yeah,
some like self loathing hook too because

1063
00:50:11,201 --> 00:50:11,861
you're like,
fuck it.

1064
00:50:11,861 --> 00:50:13,240
I'm alive.
Who gives a shit?

1065
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:15,130
This is all bullshit.
I'm not the future.

1066
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:17,740
Fuck the future.
Trialists settle now.

1067
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:19,203
Right?
Like so many fucking smart people smoke 

1068
00:50:20,381 --> 00:50:25,360
cigarettes and it's so confusing.
It's like you're making a deal to slowly

1069
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,070
pay to poison.

1070
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,010
You'll like throwing a little bit of 
money in the pot every month.

1071
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:34,330
Guarantee you guaranteeing that 20 years
down a line,

1072
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,170
30 years down the line,
however long it takes,

1073
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:37,123
you're going to have some,
some bolt is going to come off the 

1074
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:41,420
machinery and the,
Hey Mike,

1075
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,940
you got a tumor in your lungs.
It's not good.

1076
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:45,800
We're going to have to cut one of these 
things out of your chest.

1077
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,730
You can get by on one lung buddy.
This is what we got to do though.

1078
00:50:49,731 --> 00:50:51,130
We got to,
you got to start eating papayas.

1079
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,170
Like what sort of thing,
why am I even alive?

1080
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,880
You know,
we all do stuff like that.

1081
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,610
I mean it's not always trained,
but we recognize,

1082
00:50:58,611 --> 00:50:59,031
right?
Yeah,

1083
00:50:59,031 --> 00:51:01,550
we do because we,
you know,

1084
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:06,350
we're invested in reflecting a felt 
wrongness,

1085
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:08,270
you know,
I would call it felt wrong.

1086
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:11,210
Like we feel deep inside something is 
wrong,

1087
00:51:11,211 --> 00:51:12,710
wrong with us,
wrong with society,

1088
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,220
right.

1089
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:17,990
Something's missing and then we don't 
want to pretend that everything is okay.

1090
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,280
So we self medicate,
you know,

1091
00:51:19,281 --> 00:51:22,670
right there with you know,
drugs or cigarettes or you know,

1092
00:51:22,671 --> 00:51:23,504
workaholism or you know,
sex addiction or we're all sort of in 

1093
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:29,120
this place not wanting to acknowledge 
that there's a reason,

1094
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,490
you know,
like one of my favorite quotes is this,

1095
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:32,324
like Christian Murti quote,
that it's no measure of health to be 

1096
00:51:35,121 --> 00:51:37,880
well adapted to a profoundly sick 
society.

1097
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,150
Right.
So,

1098
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:41,390
right.
We really low.

1099
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,220
I love New York.
It's the best.

1100
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:45,830
I love the traffic.
I like.

1101
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:46,641
You're like,
oh,

1102
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:47,930
you're a sick person,
man.

1103
00:51:47,931 --> 00:51:50,510
Nigga is wrong with you.
Totally love it.

1104
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:52,760
Hong Kong some home.

1105
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,610
Yeah.
That's a weird,

1106
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,253
one of my very,
very best friends is just addicted to 

1107
00:51:58,790 --> 00:51:59,570
York.
Yeah.

1108
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:01,510
And it's like loves it.
He's been there forever.

1109
00:52:01,511 --> 00:52:03,460
He's like an abusive relationship.
Loves the city.

1110
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,390
Totally.
But he loves the energy.

1111
00:52:05,391 --> 00:52:09,040
He likes to all the cars and traffic.
I don't,

1112
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:10,120
you know,
I don't know what it is,

1113
00:52:10,121 --> 00:52:10,954
but he's healthy like fairly like 
physically he's got a few issues but 

1114
00:52:14,501 --> 00:52:15,334
like mentally

1115
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,210
very healthy.
That's unusual.

1116
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:20,640
Look like just one thing sorted out.
He's a smart guy.

1117
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:21,693
It's problematic.

1118
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,270
He just loves the,
I don't know what it is.

1119
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:26,610
Hong Kong,
you know

1120
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,620
that's the thing though.
Like if you've,

1121
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:32,310
if you think about what the messaging is
from the top down we were talking about,

1122
00:52:32,311 --> 00:52:36,870
right?
Like the messaging is keep it together.

1123
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:40,710
Punch the clock on Monday,
like you know,

1124
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:45,300
sorted out right.
And you're supposed to be like fine,

1125
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,070
be fine.
Right.

1126
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,580
But many of us don't feel fine.
No like range,

1127
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,930
a huge range of not fineness.
That's what I'm saying when I say like a

1128
00:52:54,931 --> 00:52:58,350
felt wrongness and that's actually 
healthy,

1129
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,940
you know,
to sense that.

1130
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,550
And a lot of artists I would say are the
canaries in the coal mine,

1131
00:53:03,551 --> 00:53:05,580
so to speak.
Like they're the ones who feel,

1132
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,850
you know,
the,

1133
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:08,280
the collective wound,
you know,

1134
00:53:08,281 --> 00:53:11,160
if you want to call it that more than we
do,

1135
00:53:11,161 --> 00:53:12,750
they're sensitive in ways.
Well,

1136
00:53:12,751 --> 00:53:16,320
I don't want to put you in my category,
it's more of an artist than I am.

1137
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,393
I'm not an artist.
So I sort of look at yourself as an 

1138
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:19,980
artist.
No,

1139
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:20,813
no,
definitely not.

1140
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,133
No.
It's interesting actually because most 

1141
00:53:23,281 --> 00:53:27,330
of my patients are real or they become 
after I get them off meds.

1142
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:28,260
Yeah,
Whoa,

1143
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,400
wait a minute.
Yeah.

1144
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,233
So they weren't artists.
You get them off meds and all of a 

1145
00:53:31,921 --> 00:53:32,754
sudden they start like composing music 
or something or making paintings are 

1146
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:39,180
exactly,
they say find some repressed expression,

1147
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:40,770
something like that,
you know.

1148
00:53:40,771 --> 00:53:42,600
But if you also look at,
you know,

1149
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:43,434
like I just wrote an article recently 
that tied in Chris Cornell and his 

1150
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,430
hurts.
I know,

1151
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,900
I know.
Bothered me.

1152
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:53,940
I know.
And it's,

1153
00:53:53,941 --> 00:53:55,500
it's not an isolated,
I mean,

1154
00:53:55,501 --> 00:53:56,880
listen,
I don't know the details.

1155
00:53:56,881 --> 00:53:59,660
I don't know what happened,
but I said she likes the smell a rat.

1156
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,513
Yeah.
Let's just say what his wife believes 

1157
00:54:01,341 --> 00:54:02,280
that they sent his wife.

1158
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:07,460
He took too many antidepressants or anti
anxiety medications,

1159
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:13,040
but wasn't there like some rumor about 
him having a relapse?

1160
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,940
Was there a rumor,
rumor that there was like track marks,

1161
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,290
fresh track marks,
CV,

1162
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:20,124
find anything on that?
How the hell would anybody know that 

1163
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:22,374
that seems like some shit that people 
just start making up the annual listen 

1164
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:26,370
and I could be accused of doing the same
thing,

1165
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,233
even commenting,
but his wife who is married to him was 

1166
00:54:30,031 --> 00:54:32,790
the one that said that she believed,
like when she talked to him on the phone

1167
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:36,510
that he had taken too much of his anti 
anxiety medication and it'd be one thing

1168
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:37,231
to just be like,
oh,

1169
00:54:37,231 --> 00:54:38,064
she's like a grieving widow.
If there wasn't like a very indicting 

1170
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:42,024
body of evidence that unequivocally like
literally two new studies just came out 

1171
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:50,480
this week that unequivocally implicate 
benzodiazepines in homicide and suicide.

1172
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,333
Right.
So you are the very important finish 

1173
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:55,824
study demonstrated that benzodiazepines 
are led to like a 223% increase risk of 

1174
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,040
committing homicide.
Jesus Christ,

1175
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:05,740
they,
um,

1176
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:06,623
along with the antidepressants and 
actually other psychotropics including 

1177
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:10,740
stimulants.
You know,

1178
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:11,574
all of these medications have been 
linked to an increase in suicide as 

1179
00:55:14,101 --> 00:55:14,934
well.
So when I hear about a school shooting 

1180
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:19,620
or I hear about the German wings,
you know,

1181
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,370
plane crash wings,
that Guy Lubick like who,

1182
00:55:22,371 --> 00:55:24,660
who took down the plane,
the German wings plane,

1183
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:28,410
he suicided with a whole plane of people
and crashed the plane.

1184
00:55:28,411 --> 00:55:32,850
Like when I hear about these mass 
murder,

1185
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,240
like menace to society kind of 
situations,

1186
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:39,300
my first thought is what psych meds were
they on?

1187
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:40,463
And you know,
my training basically conditioned me to 

1188
00:55:44,011 --> 00:55:45,750
say,
oh well they're mentally ill.

1189
00:55:45,751 --> 00:55:46,584
So obviously they're taking psych meds.
That's like saying umbrellas cause the 

1190
00:55:49,831 --> 00:55:50,664
rain,
right?

1191
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,640
That's not how it works.
Causation.

1192
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:54,930
Correlation.
Exactly.

1193
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:56,183
But actually there's a massive 
suppressed body of literature that 

1194
00:56:00,391 --> 00:56:02,820
implicates these medications,
all of them.

1195
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:05,610
And we know why we think,
right.

1196
00:56:05,611 --> 00:56:06,444
So we think that it has to do with the 
way you metabolize some people 

1197
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,750
metabolize these medications.
So they,

1198
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:15,510
you might be born with a genetic variant
in your liver,

1199
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,553
then makes it so that you buy design,
metabolize medications differently than 

1200
00:56:21,301 --> 00:56:22,200
someone else.
Right?

1201
00:56:22,201 --> 00:56:24,130
So you can enter into a state of

1202
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,510
what's called auto intoxication more 
easily than someone else,

1203
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,373
even sometimes in a couple of doses.
And you develop what's called Aca 

1204
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,070
Athenia induced impulsivity,
impulsivity,

1205
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:36,904
which is like ack.
Athena is like this feeling like you 

1206
00:56:38,471 --> 00:56:42,220
just want to crawl under your skin,
but you seem really chill.

1207
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:45,370
It's really creepy,
like horror movie level.

1208
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:50,380
Um,
to fucking boil over.

1209
00:56:50,381 --> 00:56:52,720
Exactly right.
I had a,

1210
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:53,554
I spoke in July in London.
I did this like workshop and this guy 

1211
00:56:57,281 --> 00:57:00,100
contacted me named David Carmichael and 
he's like,

1212
00:57:00,101 --> 00:57:04,150
I'd love to meet you,
followed your work and I want us to tell

1213
00:57:04,151 --> 00:57:06,010
you about my story.
Um,

1214
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:10,330
I had known about this paper of which he
was one of 11,

1215
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:12,280
10 or 11 subjects,
um,

1216
00:57:12,281 --> 00:57:13,114
by these authors.
Lucier and karate was from 2011 older 

1217
00:57:15,611 --> 00:57:20,170
paper where they took all these people 
who had committed like heinous acts,

1218
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:21,004
right?
Like,

1219
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:22,630
you know,
murdered their therapists,

1220
00:57:22,631 --> 00:57:23,464
are killed,
their child or themselves jumped in 

1221
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:26,800
front of a train or whatever.

1222
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:32,250
And they were prescribed antidepressants
for totally run of the mill stress.

1223
00:57:32,261 --> 00:57:35,500
Right?
So like work stress or a dog dying,

1224
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:39,760
not because they had like severe mental 
illness and we're suicidal,

1225
00:57:39,761 --> 00:57:41,590
right?
These people were not suicidal.

1226
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:42,424
They were not homicidal.
They were normal citizens and they went 

1227
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:46,234
on to do this crazy thing.
And what they found was when they 

1228
00:57:49,121 --> 00:57:51,490
analyze each of these,
you know,

1229
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,660
victims,
perpetrators,

1230
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:54,230
everyone to look at it,
um,

1231
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,113
they found,
they all had these liver variants that 

1232
00:57:56,651 --> 00:58:01,180
I'm talking about so that they were 
basically poisoned by medication,

1233
00:58:01,181 --> 00:58:02,014
but before they were poisoned,
they were put into this altered state 

1234
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:08,350
where they did impulsive leave,
violent things.

1235
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:09,184
So this guy basically gets on the stage 
where I was speaking and he talks about 

1236
00:58:13,361 --> 00:58:16,490
how he was prescribed Paxil,
uh,

1237
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,000
because he works,
I think as an accountant.

1238
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:19,883
Um,
and he was prescribed it for work 

1239
00:58:20,981 --> 00:58:21,700
related stress.

1240
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,010
Like it was just like taking on too much
stress at work.

1241
00:58:24,011 --> 00:58:24,844
Right.
And he remembers feeling like his mind 

1242
00:58:31,031 --> 00:58:32,920
like slip away.
Like he began,

1243
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,340
you entered this realm of like psychosis
essentially.

1244
00:58:36,341 --> 00:58:37,720
And he started to,
you know,

1245
00:58:37,721 --> 00:58:39,400
to develop all of these paranoid 
beliefs.

1246
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:41,590
But he looked and people told him like,
Oh,

1247
00:58:41,591 --> 00:58:43,840
you're getting better.
I'm so glad you're feeling better.

1248
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:48,040
Long Story Short,
he strangled his 11 year old son dead.

1249
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:52,540
And that's before or after you met him 
after,

1250
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:57,250
this was actually years ago and he was 
not jailed at him and he was telling you

1251
00:58:57,251 --> 00:58:59,620
about all this.
And then after that he killed his kid.

1252
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:00,483
No,
he killed his son before we met years 

1253
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:04,000
ago.
But he wanted,

1254
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,560
you know,
to share,

1255
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:06,441
you know,
with the,

1256
00:59:06,441 --> 00:59:08,950
the audience of doctors I was speaking 
to like,

1257
00:59:08,951 --> 00:59:11,810
listen,
it's Russian based on this medicated,

1258
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:12,663
which is rare actually believe it or not
because a lot of times these people are 

1259
00:59:15,011 --> 00:59:15,490
jailed.

1260
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,230
So it's like,
you know,

1261
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:20,320
punishing the,
punishing the victim so to speak.

1262
00:59:20,321 --> 00:59:25,190
But that's sort of the issue that it's 
an important issue.

1263
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:26,390
Right.
Cause your friend.

1264
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:27,230
Right.
Okay.

1265
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:30,260
So let's say some people,
this is in line with their consciousness

1266
00:59:30,261 --> 00:59:31,094
to,
to not have any curiosity about why 

1267
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:34,874
they're having symptoms,
not want to see what they can do in 

1268
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:39,890
terms of optimizing their lifestyle.
It's just like not their deal.

1269
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:40,610
Right?
Right.

1270
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:43,670
So they want to take a medication and 
they want to suppress their symptoms and

1271
00:59:43,671 --> 00:59:44,990
just like,
hope it works out.

1272
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,450
That's fine.
I don't care what people do.

1273
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,100
This should be a free country,
right?

1274
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:52,040
You do what you want to do and practice 
the medicine that makes sense to you.

1275
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:56,300
But the sort of like chink in the armor 
is perhaps this issue,

1276
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:00,200
which is that we don't really have a 
good way of identifying,

1277
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:02,150
you know,
it's Russian roulette.

1278
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:06,250
We don't have a good way of identifying 
if you're going to be David Carmichael,

1279
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:07,700
right?
So,

1280
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:09,470
and it's,
you know,

1281
01:00:09,471 --> 01:00:12,140
it's one thing to kill yourself 
impulsively,

1282
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:13,370
but like,
you know,

1283
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,320
those school shootings,
for example,

1284
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:19,580
have without an exception,
been committed by,

1285
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:20,553
uh,
people who are kids who are recently 

1286
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:25,100
medicated.
So

1287
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:28,140
just as a public health issue or coming 
off psych meds.

1288
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,390
Exactly.
The changes.

1289
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:31,663
Yes.
If not 100% is really crazy that that's 

1290
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:35,120
tonight.
And when you bring that up,

1291
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:37,850
by the way,
people call you a gun rights apologist.

1292
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:40,190
Well you're,
you're distorting the issue,

1293
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:43,430
you're turning it to a psych meds issue.
When it's a gun issue.

1294
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:46,520
If these people don't have guns,
they can't commit these crimes.

1295
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:51,340
Like that to me is a very bizarre way of
looking at like the one science,

1296
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:53,280
which is why would they,
but it's,

1297
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,140
it's what you were talking about before 
where psychiatrists aren't talking about

1298
01:00:57,141 --> 01:00:58,130
this,
this is,

1299
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:03,220
this is such a taboo subject that by the
time it gets to the average educated and

1300
01:01:05,001 --> 01:01:09,110
informed person who for the most part it
was probably liberal and you know,

1301
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:10,003
you're,
you're,

1302
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:11,143
cause we're talking about people that 
want to get rid of guns with what 

1303
01:01:13,581 --> 01:01:14,414
they're seeing is only the gun.
They're not seeing the mindset behind 

1304
01:01:17,511 --> 01:01:20,390
the ability to do something like that,
which is relevant context.

1305
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:21,463
This liver issue that you're talking 
about is this testable and nobody tests 

1306
01:01:26,931 --> 01:01:27,710
for it.
Oh Jesus.

1307
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:30,190
Clearly apart from functional medicine 
doctors

1308
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,730
perhaps,
but for the most part,

1309
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:34,580
they're not going to be the one starting
patients on psychiatric meds.

1310
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,910
Most psych meds are started by primary 
care doctors after 10 minutes.

1311
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:38,803
And there's a scientific consensus that 
this issue exists that this with this 

1312
01:01:41,721 --> 01:01:44,150
liver issue that if you take these 
medications,

1313
01:01:44,151 --> 01:01:48,740
it can turn turn you into this or take 
you to the psychotic state.

1314
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:49,700
Yes,
yes.

1315
01:01:49,701 --> 01:01:50,534
And you would be surprised how much 
scientific acknowledgement there is of 

1316
01:01:53,121 --> 01:01:53,871
such quality,
again,

1317
01:01:53,871 --> 01:01:54,704
I'm sorry.
Or

1318
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:57,470
it's called Eq Athenia induced 
impulsivity.

1319
01:01:57,471 --> 01:01:59,060
Achalasia is the,
um,

1320
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,013
experience,
the symptom neurologic symptom that's 

1321
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:02,443
induced by the impaired,
it's thought to be impaired metabolism 

1322
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:09,350
on the liver level of these medications.
Um,

1323
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:12,350
so this is not like a theory,
it's not a theory.

1324
01:02:12,351 --> 01:02:13,290
It's,
yeah,

1325
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:16,160
but there's a lot of stuff like that.
Like there's,

1326
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:18,350
um,
you know,

1327
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:20,520
in the literature there's something 
called antidepressant,

1328
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:22,020
um,
tacky phylaxis,

1329
01:02:22,021 --> 01:02:22,854
which is the acknowledgement in the 
scientific literature that like a good 

1330
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:30,390
30% of the time they just stopped having
an effect.

1331
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:31,510
Like stop working.

1332
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,560
Yeah.
That's the thing that people that I know

1333
01:02:33,561 --> 01:02:35,720
that have taken the most sad that the 
doctor will tell you,

1334
01:02:35,721 --> 01:02:37,670
hey,
this is going to work for a little while

1335
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,190
and then it's not going to work anymore.
Just hope you don't like.

1336
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:45,950
Well my friend who got on them,
and actually I have two friends that got

1337
01:02:45,951 --> 01:02:46,784
a great benefit from getting on ssrs.
They had a great benefit and they both 

1338
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:52,340
eventually got off of them.
Cool.

1339
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:55,170
They got on them and then their life 
improved.

1340
01:02:55,180 --> 01:03:00,180
They improve the,
the just the overall existence that they

1341
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:02,810
experience,
like they improve their job,

1342
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,750
they improve their,
just their state,

1343
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,950
their status in life,
relationship stuff.

1344
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:10,520
All these different things improved and 
then they slowly wean themselves off and

1345
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:13,700
now they don't need them anymore.
But both of my friends that were on them

1346
01:03:13,701 --> 01:03:16,850
say that it was a great benefit of that 
to get on them.

1347
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:21,620
So that's a rare story.
I would say it's a pretty rare story.

1348
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:22,483
Now you could argue that I have a skewed
exposure to the population because I 

1349
01:03:25,071 --> 01:03:25,904
only see the people who've been on 10 20
years and want to desperately get off 

1350
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:29,780
and can't,
you know,

1351
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:34,130
but I am again,
this public health issue aside,

1352
01:03:34,131 --> 01:03:35,090
which is that,
you know,

1353
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:35,924
these medications could be inducing 
impulsive violence at random and like 

1354
01:03:39,981 --> 01:03:42,770
perhaps we should at least be talking 
about this as a society,

1355
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:43,683
right?
Right.

1356
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:46,310
That issue aside,
I'm,

1357
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:48,710
you know,
a crusader for informed consent.

1358
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:49,993
I believe that you just should know all 
the options and all of the available 

1359
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:56,510
science and then you make your own damn 
decision,

1360
01:03:56,511 --> 01:03:58,190
right?
With your free will.

1361
01:03:58,191 --> 01:03:59,024
You do what's right for you,
what matches your level of 

1362
01:04:00,801 --> 01:04:01,850
consciousness,
right?

1363
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:07,240
Because the problem is that most people 
are not taken off of meds.

1364
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:11,480
Um,
and they are maintained for longterm,

1365
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:16,780
even though all of the longterm science 
suggest that people do worse longterm on

1366
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:21,230
all categories of psychiatric beds than 
if they were never medicated.

1367
01:04:21,231 --> 01:04:23,990
And this includes this anti psychotics 
for schizophrenia,

1368
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,430
all of them,
all of them.

1369
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,620
And the person who exposed this and 
really,

1370
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:29,420
you know,
sort of blew the whistle on this issue.

1371
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:33,830
His book changed my life and made me put
down my prescription pad is um,

1372
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:34,693
Robert Whittaker who's an investigative 
journalist and he wrote a book called 

1373
01:04:37,581 --> 01:04:40,220
Anatomy of an epidemic.
And I've read it,

1374
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:42,770
you know,
when it came out and I was ready to read

1375
01:04:42,771 --> 01:04:43,604
it because and receive it cause I just 
had this health experience in my own 

1376
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:47,534
right.
So I read it and basically what he says 

1377
01:04:49,311 --> 01:04:50,061
is,
okay,

1378
01:04:50,061 --> 01:04:53,150
so we have escalating rates of 
treatment,

1379
01:04:53,151 --> 01:04:54,770
right?
Like more and more people,

1380
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:55,843
you know,
16% of the American population is on 

1381
01:04:57,291 --> 01:04:58,124
these meds.

1382
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,350
Right?
Good on a lot of your friends,

1383
01:05:00,351 --> 01:05:05,351
my friends and with more treatment,
shouldn't we have less disability?

1384
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,630
Right?
Like shouldn't people be more functional

1385
01:05:08,631 --> 01:05:09,464
and less sick?
And what we find is that the reverse is 

1386
01:05:12,741 --> 01:05:13,371
true.
You know,

1387
01:05:13,371 --> 01:05:16,130
that we have more disability with more 
medicating.

1388
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:20,380
So his book goes through all of these 
studies.

1389
01:05:20,381 --> 01:05:23,770
I never heard about one of them in my 
ivy league training.

1390
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:27,100
All of these studies that are not 
industry funded,

1391
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:28,203
right?
Because we know that the pharmaceutical 

1392
01:05:29,141 --> 01:05:31,900
industry is four times more likely to 
publish something.

1393
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:33,043
Um,
when it's positive then when it's not 

1394
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:35,224
and they can publish whatever they want 
and not publish whatever they don't 

1395
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:37,721
want.
Right.

1396
01:05:37,721 --> 01:05:40,540
So they are in charge of their own 
policing,

1397
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:43,960
which is the Fox guarding the hen house 
kind of a situation.

1398
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,393
Um,
so these were all non industry funded 

1399
01:05:47,561 --> 01:05:52,360
studies and the story they tell is quite
different than what you might imagine.

1400
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,370
And it's,
it's like almost shocking,

1401
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:56,770
right?
That you have schizophrenia,

1402
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,990
right?
Obviously you need to take meds,

1403
01:05:59,170 --> 01:05:59,920
right?
Right.

1404
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:00,753
Well,
but what if like doing something is not 

1405
01:06:02,471 --> 01:06:05,320
as good as doing nothing according to 
the published literature,

1406
01:06:05,321 --> 01:06:05,630
right?

1407
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:06,463
So doing nothing is better according to 
the published literature then doing 

1408
01:06:09,891 --> 01:06:13,810
something than doing medications.
So taking medication for site,

1409
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:16,010
some sort of a psychotic disorder.
What,

1410
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:17,810
what are the odds that it's going to 
work?

1411
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:19,373
So when we're looking at the data that 
suggests that it's effective to take an 

1412
01:06:23,821 --> 01:06:27,540
anti psychotic there without exception 
short term studies.

1413
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:29,340
So six to eight weeks.
Oh.

1414
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,233
But people are taking these medications 
for months to years and they lose their 

1415
01:06:34,411 --> 01:06:35,244
efficiency over time.
Where their effectiveness or dating 

1416
01:06:37,231 --> 01:06:39,240
effects usually upfront.
Not the same as us.

1417
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:41,190
The sorrows in terms of,
no,

1418
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,113
no,
the story is similar because if we look 

1419
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:49,890
at our outcomes and long term like,
like do you have a job?

1420
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:52,800
You know,
do you have a friend network you like,

1421
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:53,663
are you a functional member of society?
If we look at those parameters in the 

1422
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,940
longterm,
people do worse.

1423
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:02,040
And that's his argument,
you know,

1424
01:07:02,041 --> 01:07:02,874
is that,
that's why we have more and more of the 

1425
01:07:03,931 --> 01:07:04,764
population literally getting checks from
the government because they cannot 

1426
01:07:07,231 --> 01:07:10,860
function in society even though they're 
medicated to the hilt,

1427
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,570
you know,
like they're fully treated,

1428
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:13,404
so to speak.

1429
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,690
And he makes this argument for 
Benzodiazepines,

1430
01:07:15,691 --> 01:07:18,110
for stimulants.
And if you look into the literature,

1431
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:18,963
you understand that all that's happening
is you're forcing an adaptation on the 

1432
01:07:24,001 --> 01:07:25,740
part of the body.
This is a chemical,

1433
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:29,490
it is not fixing anything and just like 
alcohol.

1434
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,940
Okay?
Like some people love alcohols.

1435
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,820
For some people it's very relaxing,
right?

1436
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:38,430
Some people hate it and it's terrible 
and it makes them sick.

1437
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:39,863
So just like any other chemical 
substance with unpredictably 

1438
01:07:42,781 --> 01:07:47,781
psychoactive effects,
it may be adaptive for a given period of

1439
01:07:48,031 --> 01:07:48,864
time.
But we know through the alcohol analogy 

1440
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:51,990
that there's no free lunch,
right?

1441
01:07:51,991 --> 01:07:53,640
So even if it's adaptive in the short 
term,

1442
01:07:53,641 --> 01:07:57,570
your body adapts habituates you become 
potentially dependent,

1443
01:07:57,571 --> 01:08:00,030
although that's a more complex 
conversation.

1444
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:05,540
You know what drives that dependency.
But the longterm is known to us like the

1445
01:08:06,511 --> 01:08:10,830
long term picture of like chronic use of
alcohol for let's say social anxiety.

1446
01:08:10,830 --> 01:08:11,663
It doesn't look pretty if you want to 
just stop drinking 15 years down the 

1447
01:08:13,681 --> 01:08:16,010
line after you've been drinking every 
right.

1448
01:08:16,011 --> 01:08:16,844
So,
but we've been told to think of psych 

1449
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:18,374
meds differently and when I'm trying to 
say is we shouldn't be right because 

1450
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:26,090
they are just chemicals having chemical 
effects that your body is adapting to.

1451
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,420
So obviously that chemical effect is not
going to endure that.

1452
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:32,420
Like it's not going to last.
And then there's going to be a cost.

1453
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:37,190
So one of the major pieces of informed 
consent I would like to see foregrounded

1454
01:08:37,191 --> 01:08:38,024
for people is it may be nearly 
physically impossible for you to come 

1455
01:08:43,431 --> 01:08:47,240
off of this medication after several 
years of use.

1456
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,890
Are you cool with that?
Right?

1457
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:49,724
Like are you physically impossible and 
all you have to do is google like 

1458
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:59,030
antidepressant withdrawal or 
benzodiazepine withdrawal,

1459
01:08:59,031 --> 01:09:01,250
right?
Cause we're keeping people on these meds

1460
01:09:01,251 --> 01:09:01,650
longterm.

1461
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:04,640
Cause of course we're not fixing the 
root cause of the problem,

1462
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:05,474
right?
It's like if you have glass in your 

1463
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:08,570
foot,
we're not taking the glass out.

1464
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,050
We're just like putting a bandaid on it,
giving you a tylenol and being like,

1465
01:09:12,051 --> 01:09:13,820
okay get out of here.
You know,

1466
01:09:13,821 --> 01:09:16,610
so we're not fixing the problem so to 
speak.

1467
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:20,690
So we're masking it and there's going to
be,

1468
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:21,950
you know,
sort of it's going to,

1469
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:23,263
it's like a whack.
Like is this going to keep manifesting 

1470
01:09:25,101 --> 01:09:25,934
in other ways?
So people are kept on these meds 

1471
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:32,540
longterm and then coming off them is,
I've come to the conclusion that they're

1472
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:35,000
more habit forming than any chemicals on
the planet.

1473
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:37,610
Crack Oxi content,
nothing.

1474
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:38,780
They,
they do not.

1475
01:09:38,781 --> 01:09:42,320
Hold a candle to how hard it can be to 
come off of psych meds.

1476
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:43,813
All you need to do is ask someone.
So your friends are very rare examples 

1477
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:46,753
because there are millions of people on 
the Internet right now trying to help 

1478
01:09:49,011 --> 01:09:54,011
each other like survive the process of 
coming physically survive,

1479
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,390
let alone,
you know,

1480
01:09:56,391 --> 01:09:59,060
psycho spiritually survive the process 
of coming off of meds.

1481
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,860
So that's what I focus on.
You know,

1482
01:10:00,861 --> 01:10:02,870
in my day to day practice now.
No.

1483
01:10:02,871 --> 01:10:06,620
Are there certain meds that are more 
difficult to come off than others?

1484
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:08,413
I would say yes,
although I've seen exceptions to that 

1485
01:10:11,001 --> 01:10:11,751
too.
You know,

1486
01:10:11,751 --> 01:10:12,584
I would say that there are certain 
antidepressants that are notoriously 

1487
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:17,090
challenging,
you know,

1488
01:10:17,091 --> 01:10:20,300
meds like Paxil or affects her.
But then Prozac,

1489
01:10:20,301 --> 01:10:21,134
which is supposed to be like have this 
long half life and be easy to come off 

1490
01:10:23,571 --> 01:10:24,404
of.
And I have patients who develop what 

1491
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:26,864
looks like aids.
Like they get so sick in such 

1492
01:10:29,661 --> 01:10:34,580
complicated ways that no one believes 
them and then they think that they're,

1493
01:10:34,610 --> 01:10:36,830
you know,
well you must have ms or you must have,

1494
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,540
you know,
Mano or you must have,

1495
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:39,950
you know,
some new diagnosis.

1496
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,280
And in the literature since 2014 has 
told us,

1497
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,070
no,
this is a withdrawal is,

1498
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:45,913
is a complicated protracted withdrawal 
that is worse than any other meds out 

1499
01:10:50,691 --> 01:10:51,350
there.

1500
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:54,260
And so if you knew that,
you might be like,

1501
01:10:54,261 --> 01:10:55,700
all right,
well what are my other options?

1502
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:57,830
Do I have other options?
And you know,

1503
01:10:57,831 --> 01:10:58,664
since I put down my prescription,
I have many years now of experience of 

1504
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,173
treating all manner of bipolar disorder,
suicidality and psychosis without 

1505
01:11:07,101 --> 01:11:07,934
medication.
And let me tell you like the outcomes 

1506
01:11:09,501 --> 01:11:10,334
that I get today,
I couldn't have fantasized about when I 

1507
01:11:13,171 --> 01:11:14,004
was prescribing.
I didn't even know that this was 

1508
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:16,134
possible.
So if you know that these outcomes are 

1509
01:11:17,971 --> 01:11:18,804
possible,
then maybe you would consider a 

1510
01:11:20,761 --> 01:11:24,150
lifestyle approach.
But you have to know it's possible.

1511
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,450
That's informed consent.
Best case scenario.

1512
01:11:26,451 --> 01:11:30,140
When you were prescribing and d,
what did it ever feel like?

1513
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:31,860
Like what I mean did,
did,

1514
01:11:31,861 --> 01:11:35,840
did it ever get to the point where you 
were wondering like,

1515
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:38,600
the none of none of these people are 
really getting better.

1516
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:39,643
They're,
they're improving in certain ways where 

1517
01:11:41,361 --> 01:11:42,194
they're not getting better.
You don't have to the goal of getting 

1518
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:46,430
them totally better.
What was your goal?

1519
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:51,320
Management Management.
So the idea is you have an issue.

1520
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:52,243
This issue has never gone away.
Let's just throw a wet blanket on the 

1521
01:11:54,151 --> 01:11:54,984
soccer.
Yeah.

1522
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,000
See if we could,
uh,

1523
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:56,893
hold down the fire.

1524
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,200
Exactly.
And you know what,

1525
01:11:58,201 --> 01:11:59,340
I have a lot of compassion.
I've,

1526
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:01,200
many of my friends are conventional 
psychiatrist,

1527
01:12:01,201 --> 01:12:02,034
so I have compassion for people who are 
in the trenches practicing conventional 

1528
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:08,520
approaches because I thought I was doing
good.

1529
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:09,533
You know,
when I was prescribing I thought I was 

1530
01:12:10,921 --> 01:12:12,360
doing good things for these.
Yeah.

1531
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:13,560
These friends,
uh,

1532
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:15,910
how do they feel about what you're doing
now?

1533
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,810
They sort of like tolerate me.
I don't know.

1534
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,940
Well,
it's funny because,

1535
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,460
because I have this,
I don't know what you want to call it,

1536
01:12:23,461 --> 01:12:25,410
like scientific advantage,
meaning like,

1537
01:12:25,411 --> 01:12:27,150
I,
I know more of the literature,

1538
01:12:27,151 --> 01:12:27,984
I've read more of it.
I've obsessive Lee devoted my life to 

1539
01:12:30,811 --> 01:12:33,750
this subject.
They know sort of not to fuck with me on

1540
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:34,650
some level.
Like,

1541
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,440
so I have respect.
Um,

1542
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:40,890
but they also,
it's like my thing that I do over here,

1543
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,940
we have a business,
my business given pills.

1544
01:12:44,941 --> 01:12:47,760
Crazy people like leave me alone.
Yeah,

1545
01:12:47,761 --> 01:12:49,860
exactly.
I share an office,

1546
01:12:49,861 --> 01:12:51,240
one of my best friends,
you know,

1547
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,510
he rents from my office,
you know,

1548
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,900
with all the Buddhas everywhere.
And I mean,

1549
01:12:57,901 --> 01:12:59,280
he's very,
he's more conscious about it.

1550
01:12:59,281 --> 01:12:59,821
Then the,
actually,

1551
01:12:59,821 --> 01:13:01,470
he works in forensics.
Um,

1552
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,333
which means that he works to sort of 
identify where people in the legal 

1553
01:13:06,181 --> 01:13:09,750
system are being medicated necessarily 
or unnecessarily.

1554
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:10,501
So.
Yeah,

1555
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:11,334
there's all sorts of weird 
specializations within the guild of 

1556
01:13:13,711 --> 01:13:16,410
psychiatry.
It's like a many tentacled animal.

1557
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:17,323
So when you say management,
like did you ever take someone from 

1558
01:13:20,301 --> 01:13:21,134
being like a real mess and bring them 
off the ledge and then their life 

1559
01:13:24,801 --> 01:13:25,634
improved?

1560
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:27,340
Um,
yes,

1561
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:29,590
that is,
that's the good summary of,

1562
01:13:29,591 --> 01:13:30,424
of what I do today.
So I see the sickest people that no one 

1563
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:35,320
can help because they've gotten to the 
end of the road.

1564
01:13:35,321 --> 01:13:37,420
So they've done electroconvulsive 
therapy,

1565
01:13:37,421 --> 01:13:39,670
they're on six medications,
they've been hospitalized,

1566
01:13:39,671 --> 01:13:42,850
even in state facilities there,
you know,

1567
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,370
at the end of their rope because they're
not well.

1568
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:48,760
And even conventional psychiatry has 
nothing left to offer them.

1569
01:13:48,761 --> 01:13:49,840
So I,
you know,

1570
01:13:49,841 --> 01:13:50,501
people think like,
oh,

1571
01:13:50,501 --> 01:13:52,960
I treat the worried well like some upper
east side,

1572
01:13:53,290 --> 01:13:54,123
you know,
woman who's having an affair and she's 

1573
01:13:55,281 --> 01:13:57,280
stressed out or whatever it's called,
the worried well,

1574
01:13:57,310 --> 01:13:58,420
the worried well,
yeah,

1575
01:13:58,990 --> 01:14:00,130
but it's not,
you know,

1576
01:14:00,131 --> 01:14:00,964
it's not true.
Like my patients are very sick and you 

1577
01:14:03,881 --> 01:14:07,660
know,
I have an online version of what I do in

1578
01:14:07,661 --> 01:14:10,990
the office and the outcomes there are 
even wilder,

1579
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:11,973
the ones in my office.
So you can even do this totally on your 

1580
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:15,730
own.
It's not like some Voodoo,

1581
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:17,920
I'm working on Madison Avenue in New 
York,

1582
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:20,740
but like for example,
okay so one of my,

1583
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:24,610
so I've started to video interview these
people as social proof and like it's all

1584
01:14:24,611 --> 01:14:25,444
about my website and you can see what 
they have to say about it because why 

1585
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:30,820
would you believe me?
Cause it sounds crazy what I'm saying.

1586
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:31,654
So like,

1587
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,910
so say I come to you and I say,
Hey,

1588
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:37,680
I've got real problems across all Tommy 
Brown,

1589
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:39,910
super bummed out.
Can't keep it together.

1590
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:44,980
99 problems.
So this I'll tell you about a woman,

1591
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:46,420
allie.
Okay,

1592
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:48,850
so she a real name?
No,

1593
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:51,280
she's a,
she's on my website and a video.

1594
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:52,820
Yeah.
That she's done.

1595
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:55,840
She is an intrepid woman.
She's an incredible,

1596
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,430
some beloved.
Um,

1597
01:14:57,670 --> 01:15:00,340
I've never said that about a person 
during trepid.

1598
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:03,230
She is,
that's the point I'm ultimately going to

1599
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:08,240
make is that this process of moving 
through the fire of your mental illness,

1600
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:14,410
which I don't believe in mental illness,
but moving through the fire.

1601
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,270
I don't,
what do you believe?

1602
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:20,350
I believe that we are by design as 
humans.

1603
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:21,470
Yeah.

1604
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:26,000
You know that we feel things intensely 
and some people have experiences,

1605
01:15:26,001 --> 01:15:27,800
you know,
like in other cultural settings,

1606
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:30,980
some of the early experiences as what we
would label schizophrenia.

1607
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:32,323
You know,
there is an elder that is assigned to 

1608
01:15:33,381 --> 01:15:34,214
you to,
to shepherd you through your psycho 

1609
01:15:35,841 --> 01:15:37,730
spiritual emergence.
You know,

1610
01:15:37,731 --> 01:15:38,564
we just don't have a cultural context 
for anything other than full and total 

1611
01:15:41,421 --> 01:15:42,254
complacency,
full and total adaptation to this sick 

1612
01:15:45,071 --> 01:15:45,920
society.
Right?

1613
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:46,660
So just

1614
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:47,493
godless of environmental influences and 
whatever genetic problems you might 

1615
01:15:52,751 --> 01:15:53,584
have,
people can have something really wrong 

1616
01:15:55,631 --> 01:15:56,710
with their mind.
Right.

1617
01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:00,510
I don't ever think it's really wrong 
when it gets really wrong,

1618
01:16:00,511 --> 01:16:03,020
is under the influence of Psych meds 
always.

1619
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:05,480
So there's very few exceptions.

1620
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:06,423
If someone's experiencing psychotic 
breaks and they don't get put on psych 

1621
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:09,874
medication,

1622
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,353
does it go away?
I mean that's what the longterm data I 

1623
01:16:13,181 --> 01:16:15,130
was describing for you.
It does.

1624
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:16,023
It does.
So we have turned what might've been a 

1625
01:16:17,261 --> 01:16:18,094
single episode experience that when 
properly supported for totally 

1626
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:25,210
completely resolves and you get back to 
life,

1627
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:28,360
which is what used to happen even in the
early 19 hundreds,

1628
01:16:28,361 --> 01:16:31,300
you know,
when we documented the natural history,

1629
01:16:31,301 --> 01:16:32,920
so to speak,
of these illnesses,

1630
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,980
we would see that they would go away on 
their own within a year,

1631
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:36,940
you know,
80% of it.

1632
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:39,040
So when they would come up out of 
nowhere,

1633
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:41,020
they would go away out of nowhere as 
well.

1634
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:41,953
Right?
Huh.

1635
01:16:42,050 --> 01:16:45,130
And we've turned them how many people 
you're talking about Aussies,

1636
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:46,360
sorry to interrupt you,
but like what,

1637
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:49,490
how big is this study?
Like how many people are being many,

1638
01:16:49,491 --> 01:16:51,530
many.
And this is where whittaker is like,

1639
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:53,300
you know,
my knight in shining armor,

1640
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:55,880
Robert Winter Guard,
because he's cataloged all of this data.

1641
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,173
It's,
there's a robust amount of data and 

1642
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,190
importantly it wasn't paid for by the 
industry.

1643
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:04,660
So that's an important bias to control 
for.

1644
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,513
Right?
So if someone comes to you and they're 

1645
01:17:07,041 --> 01:17:08,600
psychotic,
so,

1646
01:17:08,601 --> 01:17:10,160
so something to tell you about Allie.
Right.

1647
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:11,150
Okay.
Um,

1648
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:14,390
and her video is on my website.
This is all you know,

1649
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,410
fully with her consent that I share it 
and she came to me end of her rope.

1650
01:17:18,411 --> 01:17:23,411
She came with her husband from Kansas to
my office and she was actively,

1651
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:26,510
you know,
in an episode.

1652
01:17:26,511 --> 01:17:27,380
What are her episodes?

1653
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,213
Okay.
Her episodes are three days before her 

1654
01:17:29,991 --> 01:17:34,400
period for years she would develop 
psychotic symptoms,

1655
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:35,234
become totally paranoid and delusional 
to the extent that at one point she was 

1656
01:17:38,511 --> 01:17:39,344
digging a hole in her face trying to get
at like a thread she thought was in 

1657
01:17:42,831 --> 01:17:44,210
there.
She committed,

1658
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:46,820
attempted to commit suicide multiple 
times.

1659
01:17:46,821 --> 01:17:47,654
She had been on at least seven different
psychiatric medications in and out of 

1660
01:17:50,991 --> 01:17:51,824
hospitals,
like a laundry list of diagnoses like 

1661
01:17:54,891 --> 01:17:58,040
this literally including bipolar 
disorder with psychotic features,

1662
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:00,620
premenstrual dysphoric disorder,
you know,

1663
01:18:00,621 --> 01:18:03,740
all manner of dating back from like 
eating disorders.

1664
01:18:03,741 --> 01:18:06,320
In her earlier history she'd been 
through the ringer.

1665
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:07,183
Okay.
So she was like a professional psych 

1666
01:18:08,061 --> 01:18:12,290
patient and I was the last stop before 
an inpatient facility.

1667
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:15,050
Basically like institutionalization.
Okay.

1668
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:21,370
I told her this is how it's going to go.
So I have like a very heavy hand upfront

1669
01:18:22,161 --> 01:18:24,500
and I can be a hard ass for sure.

1670
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:27,860
Um,
but it's in service of passing the baton

1671
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:31,610
to these women because I don't have 
longterm patients.

1672
01:18:31,611 --> 01:18:33,730
Like there's an intense window and then 
they,

1673
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:35,083
they're done with me right.
Once they're through the birth canal so 

1674
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:38,504
to speak.
Right.

1675
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:42,200
So what I asked her to do is follow a 
very strict diet,

1676
01:18:42,201 --> 01:18:45,530
no cheating,
none like zero bullshit.

1677
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:47,180
Okay.
So what's the Diet?

1678
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:48,443
Okay,
so the template for the Diet that I 

1679
01:18:51,801 --> 01:18:54,980
recommend is based not only on like my 
personal experience,

1680
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:58,400
but also on my work with my mentor Dr.
Nicholas Gonzalez,

1681
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:02,180
who was the most best figure in modern 
medicine.

1682
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:07,510
He passed suddenly in 2015 but he for 27
years treated terminal cancer,

1683
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:11,030
metastatic like no hope,
cancer,

1684
01:19:11,031 --> 01:19:12,390
literally,
um,

1685
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:14,990
neurodegenerative illnesses,
lyme disease,

1686
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:16,063
you know,
diabetes all with a 100% holistic 

1687
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,490
approach that was based on three 
pillars,

1688
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:25,580
a personalized diet.
So like one of 10 diets,

1689
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:27,530
um,
coffee enemas.

1690
01:19:28,010 --> 01:19:28,910
Oh,
do you know that?

1691
01:19:28,911 --> 01:19:30,830
If you heard of it,
right?

1692
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,250
Cause it's like in the Zeitgeists like 
people are hearing about coffee enemas.

1693
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:36,020
Coffee.
Yeah.

1694
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:36,854
I know it's only necessary because we 
live in like a pretty toxic world at 

1695
01:19:41,001 --> 01:19:44,060
this point.
But what happens is the caffeine,

1696
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:46,520
okay,
so you're sticking this little tube like

1697
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:47,383
12 inches of the,
actually I know and it seems totally 

1698
01:19:51,231 --> 01:19:52,670
crazy and weird,
but you do it all yourself.

1699
01:19:52,671 --> 01:19:54,890
You don't go somewhere to do it.
It's not like that.

1700
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:58,130
And you're hitting this like it's called
a flexor.

1701
01:19:58,131 --> 01:19:58,964
You're hitting this point right here 
where your intestines come across and 

1702
01:20:01,581 --> 01:20:03,050
then down.
Okay.

1703
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:08,290
And right there is a nerve bundle.
That reflex is to your,

1704
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:10,260
it's called a parasympathetic nerve 
bundle.

1705
01:20:10,261 --> 01:20:11,094
It reflexes to your liver and it 
basically helps your liver to dump 

1706
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:16,860
toxicants.
Like it's,

1707
01:20:16,861 --> 01:20:19,540
it's a,
it's like a supercharging of your livers

1708
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:21,600
ability to detox you.

1709
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:22,673
Right.
Coffee in there because the caffeine 

1710
01:20:24,451 --> 01:20:25,284
stimulates that nerve bundle.
It's basically like jacking up your 

1711
01:20:27,751 --> 01:20:28,584
liver.
It cause we don't know how to detox 

1712
01:20:30,271 --> 01:20:31,104
better than our own body does.
Your liver is charged with that 

1713
01:20:32,971 --> 01:20:36,150
responsibility.
So if you can help your liver do it,

1714
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:38,190
it's going to be best.
And,

1715
01:20:38,191 --> 01:20:39,024
and this is most relevant in cancer,
like radical cancer treatments because 

1716
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,153
when the tumors are breaking down,
you need to flush that waste or you'll 

1717
01:20:48,091 --> 01:20:48,924
die.
Like literally it's called Tumor Lysis 

1718
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:52,170
Syndrome.
So you know,

1719
01:20:52,171 --> 01:20:55,770
some early pioneers discover that coffee
enemas are critical,

1720
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,790
like literally life or death critical 
for helping you flush those wastes.

1721
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:00,624
So I learned about them from the master 
and since using them in my practice 

1722
01:21:05,731 --> 01:21:06,564
completely changed my practice.
So like a med taper that would take two 

1723
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:13,380
to three years now takes me like six 
months was a given patient and,

1724
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:14,071
and Allie,
so,

1725
01:21:14,071 --> 01:21:18,030
so allie started doing coffee enemas 
twice a day.

1726
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:21,390
So,
but the dietary template is,

1727
01:21:21,690 --> 01:21:25,560
is a little bit,
I wouldn't say it's like totally,

1728
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:27,270
um,
uh,

1729
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:28,590
people think healthy,
right?

1730
01:21:28,591 --> 01:21:31,200
And they think like Vegan or they think 
vegetarian or they think,

1731
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,330
you know,
tons of green juice or whatever.

1732
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:34,403
And I noticed early on that as long as 
my patients say to fair amount of red 

1733
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:38,160
meat,
they got better.

1734
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,270
And I used to be like an ethical 
vegetarian when I was eating like cheese

1735
01:21:42,271 --> 01:21:47,271
doodles and Pepsi basically and so it 
was very confusing to me that you know,

1736
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:48,504
red meat could be a healthy part of 
anyone's lifestyle or you know anything 

1737
01:21:51,901 --> 01:21:54,480
I could ever wrap my mind around 
recommending.

1738
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,960
But over the past 10 years and now with 
the understanding of Nick's metric,

1739
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:01,553
you know where there are some people who
do require red meat to balance their 

1740
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:06,800
nervous system,
essential

1741
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:08,713
actual requirement or is this,
can this be mitigated through like a 

1742
01:22:13,611 --> 01:22:16,340
very smart and conscious vegetarian 
diet?

1743
01:22:16,341 --> 01:22:17,174
Like if you're really careful about your
nutrients and making sure they get the 

1744
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:21,993
essential fatty acids and making sure 
you get the essential amino acids and a 

1745
01:22:24,711 --> 01:22:27,350
really balanced profile of vegetable 
protein.

1746
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:28,733
It's a great question.
Ultimately my goal in this month is to 

1747
01:22:32,521 --> 01:22:34,000
clear the slate,
right?

1748
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:34,883
Of all the stuff that's like yanking on 
your brain and your immune system and 

1749
01:22:38,701 --> 01:22:42,480
driving inflammation so that you can 
begin to sense what you need.

1750
01:22:42,570 --> 01:22:44,250
Has He,
have you ever had anybody that attempted

1751
01:22:44,251 --> 01:22:48,160
to do it was so like hemp protein or pea
protein or a vegetable based proteins

1752
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:49,830
point.
I am going for gold.

1753
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:50,664
Right.
So I'm interested in like massive 

1754
01:22:52,411 --> 01:22:54,150
transformation for people and not just 
like,

1755
01:22:54,180 --> 01:22:55,013
oh I guess I feel a little better so I 
won't even see a new patient if they're 

1756
01:22:58,021 --> 01:23:01,680
not willing to at least try for the 
month to eat red meat.

1757
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:02,723
Really,

1758
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:06,130
I'm still a little,
so it's all just like what you've

1759
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:06,963
experienced for working with patients.
But if you ever experienced a single 

1760
01:23:09,911 --> 01:23:14,110
patient that tried to do it correctly 
through vegetable protein,

1761
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,180
the job at mount,
try it.

1762
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,670
I wouldn't cause I,
you know what I'm saying like,

1763
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:19,683
but I do have this online program where 
there are people who get well on and 

1764
01:23:23,801 --> 01:23:28,770
they stick to a vegetarian diet.
So it's apparently possible turn it when

1765
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:29,613
she can get eggs.
You know in his model there were no 

1766
01:23:32,651 --> 01:23:37,240
vegan diets and it's based on the work 
of Weston price.

1767
01:23:37,241 --> 01:23:39,550
You know he is Weston price.
Yeah.

1768
01:23:39,551 --> 01:23:40,384
He's like a dentist in the 19 hundreds 
who like went around the world with his 

1769
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:43,984
wife and studied all of these different 
people who like indigenous people all 

1770
01:23:47,681 --> 01:23:50,350
over like Eskimos,
like Himalayan,

1771
01:23:50,351 --> 01:23:52,090
you know,
folks,

1772
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:52,953
Mexican folks in South American and 
studied the healthy indigenous 

1773
01:23:57,101 --> 01:24:00,220
populations that we're not eating 
industrialized food.

1774
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:01,293
Right.
And what he found was they all eight 

1775
01:24:02,561 --> 01:24:05,110
different stuff.
So there isn't like a diet,

1776
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:07,720
right?
So how do you know,

1777
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:09,640
what is your version?
Right?

1778
01:24:09,641 --> 01:24:12,760
So like an Eskimo doesn't eat coconuts 
and like a mess.

1779
01:24:12,770 --> 01:24:15,040
I warrior doesn't eat whale blubber.
So like,

1780
01:24:15,041 --> 01:24:18,310
how do you know what's your version?
The truth is only,

1781
01:24:18,311 --> 01:24:19,144
you know,
but like our signals are so distorted 

1782
01:24:21,341 --> 01:24:23,320
and suppress that we can't figure it 
out.

1783
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:29,010
But you'll begin to like clear the,
like lower the white noise enough if you

1784
01:24:29,741 --> 01:24:31,960
have this month long experience of 
detox.

1785
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:34,270
So I asked,
I asked for daily meditation,

1786
01:24:34,271 --> 01:24:35,630
three minutes,
um,

1787
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:38,020
I told you I'm going to Kundalini 
zealot.

1788
01:24:38,021 --> 01:24:41,070
So I asked for people to do that before 
the podcast.

1789
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:42,110
Yeah.
Okay.

1790
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:43,700
They didn't hear me.
Yeah.

1791
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:44,830
So,
so I,

1792
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:49,060
I came to Kundalini Yoga basically out 
of sheer desperation at a very difficult

1793
01:24:49,061 --> 01:24:52,510
time in my life after my,
largely after my mentor died.

1794
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:57,010
And it totally changed my,
like rewired my nervous system,

1795
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:57,993
literally,
literally where now nothing stresses me 

1796
01:25:00,671 --> 01:25:01,750
out.
But if you have someone,

1797
01:25:01,751 --> 01:25:02,584
I mean obviously not a Vegan,
but if you have someone that comes to 

1798
01:25:07,961 --> 01:25:08,794
that does not want to eat meat but wants
to try this out and wants to try this 

1799
01:25:12,251 --> 01:25:13,630
out with a,
I mean,

1800
01:25:13,631 --> 01:25:15,910
it's really just the science of 
nutrition.

1801
01:25:15,911 --> 01:25:16,744
I mean,
you can eat a vegan diet and be healthy 

1802
01:25:18,461 --> 01:25:20,470
as long as you do it right.
Well,

1803
01:25:20,471 --> 01:25:21,304
so his model is that there are different
kinds of people and different kinds of 

1804
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:28,180
people and I can explain a little more 
require,

1805
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:31,210
require for,
for their health,

1806
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:36,480
certain dietary compliments and what are
called the parasympathetic dominance.

1807
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:39,093
Right.
Which is more like the Eskimos require 

1808
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:42,573
red meat to be healthy.
You will not only never be fully 

1809
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:46,654
healthy,
but then you're at risk for developing 

1810
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:49,063
the,
the illnesses that parasympathetic 

1811
01:25:50,471 --> 01:25:53,500
dominance develop like leukemia,
lymphoma,

1812
01:25:53,770 --> 01:25:55,340
hypothyroidism,
you know,

1813
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:57,700
chemical sensitivity,
chronic fatigue,

1814
01:25:57,850 --> 01:25:58,690
depression.

1815
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:01,390
Right?
So many,

1816
01:26:01,391 --> 01:26:01,841
many,
many,

1817
01:26:01,841 --> 01:26:02,540
many,
many,

1818
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:03,373
um,
former vegetarians converted from 

1819
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:08,450
vegetarianism because they felt 
depressed,

1820
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:11,780
right?
So while that's true,

1821
01:26:11,810 --> 01:26:16,810
on the other side of the spectrum are 
the sympathetic dominance who don't need

1822
01:26:16,851 --> 01:26:21,851
to eat red meat and who do really well 
on like a full force like plants,

1823
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,170
grains,
you know,

1824
01:26:24,171 --> 01:26:25,004
even a high carb diet and they feel well
and it's when they eat too much red 

1825
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:29,834
meat,
particularly industrial red meat that 

1826
01:26:31,521 --> 01:26:33,800
they developed solid tumors like,
you know,

1827
01:26:33,801 --> 01:26:37,070
breast cancer or pancreatic cancer,
colon cancer as this is a very common,

1828
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:37,720
you know,

1829
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:38,553
so essentially when you're dealing with 
particularly indigenous populations and 

1830
01:26:41,891 --> 01:26:42,724
people that have a,
a very strong gene pool to comes from 

1831
01:26:44,771 --> 01:26:45,604
one very strong area in the world,
like the Eskimos or like people that 

1832
01:26:48,491 --> 01:26:51,160
live in the Pacific northwest or 
something like that.

1833
01:26:51,690 --> 01:26:53,920
Uh,
not Pacific northwest,

1834
01:26:53,921 --> 01:26:55,990
but you know what I mean,
like Alaskan people,

1835
01:26:56,530 --> 01:26:57,363
there's people that live on like 
pneumonia vac and all these different 

1836
01:26:59,951 --> 01:27:00,784
islands that have eaten seal for 
hundreds and hundreds of years and have 

1837
01:27:04,181 --> 01:27:06,180
very little access to vegetables,
right?

1838
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:07,350
And meanwhile,
they're healthy,

1839
01:27:07,630 --> 01:27:10,180
super low instances of cancer.
Okay.

1840
01:27:10,210 --> 01:27:11,043
So is it just because their bodies have 
adapted and evolved for those 

1841
01:27:14,531 --> 01:27:16,630
requirements with the environment?
Right,

1842
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:18,850
exactly.
That's exactly what your body like.

1843
01:27:18,851 --> 01:27:19,684
Say if you came from Vietnam,
you would have a very different 

1844
01:27:21,821 --> 01:27:23,870
nutritional requirement then that person
was right.

1845
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:24,060
Yeah.

1846
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:24,893
And you will never be fully vital or 
healthy on the wrong version of the 

1847
01:27:28,921 --> 01:27:29,220
Diet.

1848
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:30,390
No.
Just all science.

1849
01:27:30,391 --> 01:27:32,340
Or is this an anecdotal guests?

1850
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:35,200
So when it comes to nutrition based 
science,

1851
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:37,450
there ain't none.
There's just none.

1852
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:38,553
Because the idea of nutrition research 
is like taking one nutrient out of the 

1853
01:27:41,621 --> 01:27:44,110
context of the person out of the context
of their life,

1854
01:27:44,111 --> 01:27:46,420
out of the context of their cultural,
you know,

1855
01:27:46,740 --> 01:27:48,850
his surroundings.
That's how we treat.

1856
01:27:48,851 --> 01:27:50,180
We treat it like a pharmaceutical.
We,

1857
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:52,510
we look at single nutrient out of,
you know,

1858
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:56,050
a whole compliment of information.
So we just don't,

1859
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:57,093
I tried learning about nutrition that 
way and I drove myself crazy because I 

1860
01:28:00,131 --> 01:28:01,840
was like,
what the hell do I tell my patients eat?

1861
01:28:01,841 --> 01:28:03,760
I can't find any science to support 
this.

1862
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,720
And that's why I looked for outcomes.
So Nick Gonzales is,

1863
01:28:07,721 --> 01:28:11,440
outcomes are unprecedented in medical 
history.

1864
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:12,513
Literally like 34 year terminal 
pancreatic cancer survivor you how long 

1865
01:28:15,431 --> 01:28:17,680
you have to live when you're diagnosed 
with pancreatic cancer,

1866
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:21,290
like three to six months.
Any of those here's

1867
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:25,490
on it.
But he's actually taking meds and uh,

1868
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:28,700
that's a very,
very amazing,

1869
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:30,500
they still eat sugar.
This fucker.

1870
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:34,610
He's doing his thing.
Gummy bears and shit.

1871
01:28:34,830 --> 01:28:36,470
Um,
do you know Rob Wolf?

1872
01:28:36,471 --> 01:28:37,580
Do you know Rob Walters?
Yeah,

1873
01:28:37,581 --> 01:28:38,780
not personally.
I know his work.

1874
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:39,673
Rob's a really interesting guy and one 
of the things that he does that's kind 

1875
01:28:41,601 --> 01:28:46,601
of a fascinating is on his instagram.
He and his wife will do these tests.

1876
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:51,080
They'll um,
they'll do carbohydrate absorption tasks

1877
01:28:51,081 --> 01:28:55,190
and Ketosis a tests and they'll both eat
the same things,

1878
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:58,760
but he'll test her and then test him.
And the results vary widely.

1879
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,450
Yes.
His,

1880
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:02,070
his reaction is

1881
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:02,993
like,
he just jokes around about how poor his 

1882
01:29:04,231 --> 01:29:07,230
genetics are and how about how robust 
his wife's genetics are.

1883
01:29:07,231 --> 01:29:09,690
Apparently like nothing can knock 
craddick ketosis.

1884
01:29:09,691 --> 01:29:13,080
She can eat like crazy amounts of food 
and then like a couple hours later she's

1885
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:17,070
like back on baseline.
Whereas his buyers all are like his body

1886
01:29:17,071 --> 01:29:18,510
just goes off the tracks.
Yeah,

1887
01:29:18,511 --> 01:29:19,920
he's weird.
Yeah.

1888
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:21,900
So his um,
studies though,

1889
01:29:21,901 --> 01:29:23,580
and it's a little tests,
although you know,

1890
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:25,680
they're very small.
It's just him and his wife.

1891
01:29:25,681 --> 01:29:26,514
They're really fascinating to see how 
two people who are in the exact same 

1892
01:29:30,271 --> 01:29:31,800
household,
same environment,

1893
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:32,880
you know,
one's male,

1894
01:29:32,881 --> 01:29:33,714
one's female,
but also just different genetic and 

1895
01:29:34,861 --> 01:29:39,240
backgrounds and how wildly they vary.
It's really,

1896
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:40,860
so what do you do with that?
Right,

1897
01:29:40,870 --> 01:29:41,701
right,
right.

1898
01:29:41,701 --> 01:29:44,010
How do you know who you are in medicine?
Right?

1899
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:44,844
So,
so the truth is that you have an 

1900
01:29:46,681 --> 01:29:48,300
intuitive compass,
right?

1901
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,133
Especially with food.
You are going to want to eat the diet 

1902
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,510
that is going to make you well,
candy and ice cream.

1903
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:56,670
It's intuitive.
Dude.

1904
01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:01,770
I knew it.
If you actually like take this break and

1905
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:02,913
detox,
so to speak from all those addictive 

1906
01:30:03,871 --> 01:30:06,840
foods and you have this shift in your 
body,

1907
01:30:06,841 --> 01:30:07,674
you're not going to want it.
You're going to be with the wrong cause 

1908
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:14,280
Tiramisu after you have like a nice 
dinner and you see that on the menu,

1909
01:30:14,281 --> 01:30:15,061
you're like,
come on,

1910
01:30:15,061 --> 01:30:16,470
roll it out,
let's do this.

1911
01:30:16,471 --> 01:30:20,160
Get that cream with the photo on the top
of it.

1912
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:22,020
So good.
It's gross.

1913
01:30:22,021 --> 01:30:23,480
So we should've never liked it.
Oh,

1914
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:27,090
I quit coffee like nine years ago and 
now I'm one of those ladies.

1915
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:31,740
What about the chocolate ice cream?
Is that okay?

1916
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:35,190
Nothing doesn't do anything for you.
Well you're like some sort of an android

1917
01:30:35,191 --> 01:30:38,630
then what's wrong with you here is into 
this stuff.

1918
01:30:38,631 --> 01:30:39,464
So that's,
it starts to like deep condition and 

1919
01:30:42,441 --> 01:30:44,940
then if you like really,
really feel like something like that,

1920
01:30:45,150 --> 01:30:45,931
then you're,
you're like,

1921
01:30:45,931 --> 01:30:48,330
what's up?
Like what am I like?

1922
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:51,390
You know what I mean?
Like what the fuck is up?

1923
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:54,353
Shit is good.
If you ever had like an ice cream 

1924
01:30:56,041 --> 01:30:57,720
Sundae,
whipped cream.

1925
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:02,040
I grew up in New Jersey.
I was born,

1926
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:06,480
went to friendly's like on the regular 
and I got the happy ending.

1927
01:31:06,481 --> 01:31:09,450
Can you believe it was called that 
Sunday?

1928
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:10,483
I know.
And the fries and a grilled cheese I 

1929
01:31:12,181 --> 01:31:13,480
used to eat.
Sounds good.

1930
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:17,790
Through my training,
I trained at Bellevue in New York and at

1931
01:31:17,791 --> 01:31:18,624
the gift store they used to know me so 
they'd have twizzlers and dark 

1932
01:31:21,061 --> 01:31:24,030
chocolate,
milky way waiting for me every day,

1933
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:27,630
every day.
So I was like an addict,

1934
01:31:27,660 --> 01:31:32,460
you know by any definition and you can 
resolve that,

1935
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,790
you know,
and then out what actually your meant to

1936
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:36,624
eat.
Cause Nicco we said you will eat the 

1937
01:31:38,401 --> 01:31:40,950
food that you're meant to eat,
you'll want it,

1938
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:42,720
but you have to sort of get your brain 
out of the way.

1939
01:31:42,721 --> 01:31:44,250
So if you have,
you know,

1940
01:31:44,251 --> 01:31:45,084
all of these nutrition gurus in your 
head telling you like red meat's going 

1941
01:31:48,121 --> 01:31:50,850
to kill you and give you a heart attack,
then you're gonna not want it.

1942
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:55,620
That's why I demand the openness as a 
criteria,

1943
01:31:55,621 --> 01:31:56,151
you know,
to,

1944
01:31:56,151 --> 01:31:57,670
to,
to participate with me anyway,

1945
01:31:57,690 --> 01:32:00,160
the clinical setting because then like I
can't

1946
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:00,993
tell you how many of my patients were 
former vegans and now they're totally 

1947
01:32:03,821 --> 01:32:04,331
thriving.
Okay.

1948
01:32:04,331 --> 01:32:05,590
So let me finish telling you about 
alley,

1949
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:06,960
which I didn't finish line.
Okay.

1950
01:32:07,150 --> 01:32:09,700
So that's basically what she did,
right?

1951
01:32:09,701 --> 01:32:14,350
She was off all meds except for as,
as needed Klonopin,

1952
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:15,910
uh,
when she met me.

1953
01:32:15,911 --> 01:32:18,250
So she had already done,
what does Klonopin do?

1954
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:21,190
It's like Adavan like the one we were 
talking about with Chris Cornell.

1955
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:23,920
It's an antianxiety medicine like Xanax 
or valium.

1956
01:32:23,921 --> 01:32:25,580
If you've heard of those.
Um,

1957
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:29,490
it's one of the most challenging,
uh,

1958
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:33,680
to get off of in the long term.
And that why wouldn't it be longterm?

1959
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:38,700
Like that's the confusing part.
Like why would you just voluntarily stop

1960
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:42,790
taking something that makes you feel 
chilled out when you're feeling anxious?

1961
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:43,624
Right?
But what if your anxiety is because you 

1962
01:32:46,331 --> 01:32:47,164
have unstable blood sugar and you're 
having this like fight or flight 

1963
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:51,160
explosion every hour and a half,
right?

1964
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:51,993
If you're not resolving that,
then it's like putting a bandaid on a 

1965
01:32:54,491 --> 01:32:56,140
piece of glass in your foot.
It's like,

1966
01:32:56,141 --> 01:32:56,974
okay,
but why don't you just fix it and then 

1967
01:32:58,121 --> 01:33:01,030
you won't need it.
So you make them eat a certain amount of

1968
01:33:01,031 --> 01:33:04,450
red meat.
Do limit the portions to know there's no

1969
01:33:04,451 --> 01:33:06,370
calorie counting,
there's no portion anything.

1970
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:10,150
Um,
because you are initiating yourself into

1971
01:33:10,151 --> 01:33:12,070
the process of determining what's best 
for you.

1972
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:13,143
So the whole point of this month,
this like military month that I impose 

1973
01:33:16,601 --> 01:33:21,601
on people is that it's like an 
initiation to your own self.

1974
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:25,180
So the stuff you're doing,
whether it's the meditation,

1975
01:33:25,181 --> 01:33:26,014
enemas,
detoxing your products and stuff like 

1976
01:33:28,001 --> 01:33:28,834
that,
basic,

1977
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:31,840
you know,
functional medicine stuff or the Diet is

1978
01:33:31,841 --> 01:33:34,900
all in your control,
which is why you can do this without me,

1979
01:33:34,930 --> 01:33:37,570
which has been the best like evidence 
I've ever,

1980
01:33:37,950 --> 01:33:38,783
you know,
I never even dreamed that was totally 

1981
01:33:40,121 --> 01:33:40,540
possible.

1982
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:41,373
And now I'm super pumped about it 
because the last thing I want it to be 

1983
01:33:43,961 --> 01:33:45,160
as like about,
you know,

1984
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:48,280
the Kelly Brogan effect or something 
like this at all what I'm interested in.

1985
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:49,631
Um,
so yeah,

1986
01:33:49,631 --> 01:33:52,870
so you do all this yourself though,
besides road meat.

1987
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:55,030
Okay.
So basically food.

1988
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:55,953
Okay,
so you're eating animal food like 

1989
01:33:58,930 --> 01:33:59,711
literally,
no,

1990
01:33:59,711 --> 01:34:02,200
but listen,
it's because tell me this isn't food.

1991
01:34:02,370 --> 01:34:04,330
It's animal food,
including,

1992
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:05,770
you know,
any kinds of meat,

1993
01:34:06,430 --> 01:34:07,300
fish,
eggs,

1994
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:09,130
whole eggs,
not just the way it's,

1995
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:10,593
um,
any kind of vegetables except for white 

1996
01:34:13,031 --> 01:34:14,470
potatoes.
I'll explain why.

1997
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:16,840
Um,
any kinds of fruit,

1998
01:34:17,450 --> 01:34:19,970
nuts and seed seeds,
natural salts,

1999
01:34:19,971 --> 01:34:22,000
as much as you want,
tons of filtered water,

2000
01:34:22,001 --> 01:34:25,090
that's important.
And then natural fats,

2001
01:34:25,091 --> 01:34:27,730
so like ghee,
which is clarified butter,

2002
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:28,990
coconut oil,
olive oil,

2003
01:34:28,991 --> 01:34:30,970
that kind of thing.
That's food.

2004
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:32,343
By the way.
What you're taking out is a little more 

2005
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,033
challenging for some people.
So you're taking out all this is just 

2006
01:34:38,621 --> 01:34:41,410
for the month.
It gets so much easier in the future.

2007
01:34:41,411 --> 01:34:44,410
But you're saying it all grains,
all beans,

2008
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:45,963
all dairy and that.
So the ice cream is going and then all 

2009
01:34:49,721 --> 01:34:52,570
refined sugar.
So like honey and maple syrup are fine.

2010
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:55,480
And then coffee and alcohol.

2011
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:00,890
But listen,
if you were really desperate,

2012
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:02,610
you might think about this,
right?

2013
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:05,420
And it can be challenging for the first 
like week.

2014
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:06,583
And then you start to see the dividends 
and you want to just have one month in 

2015
01:35:10,101 --> 01:35:12,590
your adult life where you just see 
what's up.

2016
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:16,700
When you control for these variables 
it's worth it because then you know what

2017
01:35:16,701 --> 01:35:20,570
the sort of relationships are between 
you and your personal,

2018
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,610
you know,
biology and these,

2019
01:35:22,660 --> 01:35:24,470
you know,
elements of your nutrition.

2020
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,393
So what's the general reaction when you 
get someone to get rid of processed 

2021
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:29,150
sugars,
cut out the grains,

2022
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:30,253
cut out the,
the non science dairy and just eat 

2023
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:34,730
regular healthy food.
What's the,

2024
01:35:34,910 --> 01:35:35,860
what's a normal range

2025
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:37,493
that sometimes you feel worse depending 
on how much of this stuff you were 

2026
01:35:40,291 --> 01:35:42,480
eating?
You can literally go through like a mini

2027
01:35:42,481 --> 01:35:45,300
withdrawal,
like headache,

2028
01:35:45,450 --> 01:35:47,790
fluid symptoms,
fatigue,

2029
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:48,653
irritability,

2030
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,720
the Keto flu.
Exactly.

2031
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:52,550
Heartflow yeah,
or Paleo.

2032
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:53,753
Exactly.
So that can be real from the coffee to 

2033
01:35:56,731 --> 01:36:00,270
obviously anyone has ever tried to quit,
but it's like a couple days and then you

2034
01:36:00,271 --> 01:36:01,104
move through it.
And then when normally starts to happen 

2035
01:36:02,791 --> 01:36:05,220
is you start to like sort of feel the 
clearing.

2036
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:07,830
Your energy is better,
your sleep is better.

2037
01:36:08,010 --> 01:36:08,843
One of the most interesting things is 
how many people tell me that they sleep 

2038
01:36:10,891 --> 01:36:11,724
better when they eat more red meat.
Like you would never make that 

2039
01:36:13,891 --> 01:36:14,730
connection.
Right.

2040
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:17,040
Sounds crazy.
I didn't mention this.

2041
01:36:17,041 --> 01:36:19,920
I hope it goes without saying that 
there's like massive,

2042
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:23,220
like millet and focus on organic and 
sourcing.

2043
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:26,660
Like I would tell people never to touch 
an animal food if they don't know,

2044
01:36:27,030 --> 01:36:29,250
you know,
that it was consciously raised.

2045
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:30,510
Okay.
So that's a caveat.

2046
01:36:30,511 --> 01:36:32,550
Important caveat.
So I'm,

2047
01:36:32,730 --> 01:36:36,330
so sleep gets better.
A lot of the like ravenous hunger,

2048
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:37,343
like I have patients who can't even go 
as long as we've been talking without 

2049
01:36:39,691 --> 01:36:41,850
like having a snack or they get hangry,
right?

2050
01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:44,340
Like they got like irritable light 
headed,

2051
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:46,830
you know,
sort of racing heart.

2052
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:48,631
Yeah,
pretty much.

2053
01:36:48,631 --> 01:36:49,560
But like,
who is it,

2054
01:36:49,561 --> 01:36:50,394
you know,
when you're just eating convenience 

2055
01:36:52,021 --> 01:36:54,030
food,
like that's a natural response.

2056
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:57,300
Um,
and then sometimes as much more radical.

2057
01:36:57,301 --> 01:37:02,301
So like in,
in alleys case within two cycles,

2058
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:04,223
she was completely symptom free.
So she went from grossly psychotic and 

2059
01:37:09,521 --> 01:37:12,220
suicidal to not only totally symptom 
free,

2060
01:37:12,221 --> 01:37:15,370
but now she's like moved through,
is moving through,

2061
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:19,660
I would say a process of awakening.
Like it's a spiritual shift,

2062
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:21,640
right?
Because it's like,

2063
01:37:21,850 --> 01:37:24,240
you know,
good Braun says like the,

2064
01:37:24,241 --> 01:37:25,074
the wound is where the light enters and,
and we don't have that consciousness as 

2065
01:37:27,461 --> 01:37:31,510
a society because we think that 
suffering the wound is where the light,

2066
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:34,660
it means that grief,
pain,

2067
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:35,703
suffering is where you grow.
Like it's where the real experience of 

2068
01:37:40,691 --> 01:37:44,290
being human and where the real contact 
with who you are.

2069
01:37:45,010 --> 01:37:45,491
Right?
So,

2070
01:37:45,491 --> 01:37:47,980
so this is true even for something like 
Iowasca,

2071
01:37:47,981 --> 01:37:49,750
like why would anyone ever do something 
like that?

2072
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:53,110
Right?
But the point is through that experience

2073
01:37:53,111 --> 01:37:56,460
of humbling surrender,
you meet yourself,

2074
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:57,863
right?
But we don't have a consciousness for 

2075
01:37:58,231 --> 01:37:59,940
that in America.
In fact,

2076
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:03,990
crying,
like literally tears is a symptom in the

2077
01:38:03,991 --> 01:38:05,250
DSM.
So,

2078
01:38:05,251 --> 01:38:09,120
so it's literally a pathological symptom
to cry.

2079
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:13,950
That is the most basic evidence of our 
humanity is that we cry.

2080
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:16,440
And if we are living in a culture that 
says,

2081
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:20,070
you're sick when you're crying,
stop doing that.

2082
01:38:21,140 --> 01:38:23,940
You know,
take this so that you can stop feeling.

2083
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:26,160
We have a bigger problem on our hands,
right?

2084
01:38:26,161 --> 01:38:29,940
So I know I can't just sit in my Madison
Avenue Office taking people off of meds.

2085
01:38:29,941 --> 01:38:31,110
And think like,
Oh,

2086
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:32,153
you know,
I'm changing the world that this is a 

2087
01:38:33,511 --> 01:38:38,511
systemic cultural issue that we make no 
room for things to fall apart.

2088
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:42,480
We make no room.
Do you know that with the Dsm five.

2089
01:38:42,481 --> 01:38:43,314
So like the latest Dsm,
they took out something called the 

2090
01:38:46,141 --> 01:38:50,790
bereavement clause from the depression 
diagnostic category.

2091
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:54,480
And that means that if you meet criteria
for depression,

2092
01:38:54,481 --> 01:38:57,240
which is what you would imagine,
you know,

2093
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:59,370
what the changes in sleep changes in 
appetite,

2094
01:38:59,371 --> 01:39:01,080
low mood,
poor concentration,

2095
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:02,700
um,
hopelessness.

2096
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:05,940
If you meet that criteria it for two 
weeks.

2097
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:10,440
It doesn't matter if your kid just died 
or your wife,

2098
01:39:10,710 --> 01:39:13,560
uh,
or like your dad.

2099
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:15,960
So that's bereavement,
right?

2100
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:19,140
It doesn't matter.
You're still a candidate for treatment

2101
01:39:19,330 --> 01:39:23,080
or if you got fired or a few experience,
natural disaster doesn't matter.

2102
01:39:23,110 --> 01:39:25,870
Or if you lost your house in a fire,

2103
01:39:25,950 --> 01:39:27,030
right.
It doesn't matter.

2104
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:29,220
Right.
So some people saw that as like,

2105
01:39:29,221 --> 01:39:30,054
wow,
really a last straw of pathologizing 

2106
01:39:32,821 --> 01:39:34,710
normal human experience.

2107
01:39:35,180 --> 01:39:36,013
So there's that.
One of the issues with these 

2108
01:39:37,191 --> 01:39:38,024
disassociative sort of uh,
chemicals that people get put on cause 

2109
01:39:41,181 --> 01:39:42,014
that's like one of the ways to describe 
a lot of people's reaction to ssrs and 

2110
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:48,020
antidepressants is a dis associative.
Yes.

2111
01:39:48,290 --> 01:39:50,210
They have a very,
they can,

2112
01:39:50,211 --> 01:39:51,800
anything can happen in their okay with 
it.

2113
01:39:51,830 --> 01:39:53,180
It's fine.
No worries,

2114
01:39:53,181 --> 01:39:54,014
no big deal.
So they don't get these highs and lows 

2115
01:39:55,850 --> 01:39:56,683
and so because they don't get the lows,
they don't get the rebound and get the 

2116
01:39:59,241 --> 01:40:03,830
highs and then also find themselves,
understand themselves so they can manage

2117
01:40:04,070 --> 01:40:04,903
how low the lows get through the mind 
and through your just living in the 

2118
01:40:10,521 --> 01:40:12,420
moment and understanding.
Exactly.

2119
01:40:12,530 --> 01:40:13,363
Understanding that there's a just a 
natural process of life and you've been 

2120
01:40:15,411 --> 01:40:17,660
through it before.
So instead of taking a pill,

2121
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:18,740
just suck it up

2122
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:21,590
100%.
I mean we don't write like in,

2123
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:24,290
in in tribal cultures like men are 
initiated,

2124
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:24,890
right?

2125
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:26,180
Oh I've got a video,
I'll show you,

2126
01:40:27,150 --> 01:40:27,983
say really tooth yanked out or you going
to like survive in the wild for can 

2127
01:40:32,301 --> 01:40:34,310
circumcision video if you really want to
get crazy,

2128
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:35,540
my guess.
Yeah.

2129
01:40:35,550 --> 01:40:37,400
One wells,
you know,

2130
01:40:37,670 --> 01:40:40,280
so we think of ourselves as being lucky 
like that.

2131
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:44,990
You don't have to do that though.
I sure I'm not taking responsibility for

2132
01:40:44,991 --> 01:40:48,080
what's in his video as being in any way 
related to what I'm talking about.

2133
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:50,240
No,
it's definitely not,

2134
01:40:51,650 --> 01:40:54,010
you wouldn't approve.
But it's

2135
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:56,500
true.
Like we were just like,

2136
01:40:56,830 --> 01:41:01,630
we just bb our way through life because 
no one is teaching us how to,

2137
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:02,823
to confront our deepest fears.
You like explore the shadow realms and 

2138
01:41:08,051 --> 01:41:11,050
integrated into our own power.
Right?

2139
01:41:11,051 --> 01:41:13,600
We have no understanding of it.
We make fun of that.

2140
01:41:13,601 --> 01:41:16,390
We think it's like woo weirdness that 
like other cultures can,

2141
01:41:16,590 --> 01:41:19,450
you know,
do in their little tropical islands.

2142
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:24,840
But what I have found is that taking 
people off of Psych meds,

2143
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:26,313
um,
somehow is seeming to serve as like an 

2144
01:41:29,861 --> 01:41:33,550
initiation process for like thousands 
today.

2145
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:35,320
So interestingly,
right,

2146
01:41:35,321 --> 01:41:36,154
like that you took it because you 
thought it was a good idea and it's so 

2147
01:41:38,951 --> 01:41:39,784
challenging to come off it and forces 
you to confront a lot of elements of 

2148
01:41:43,271 --> 01:41:44,104
your consciousness live differently.
It forces you to work with your body 

2149
01:41:46,871 --> 01:41:47,704
differently.
It forces you to begin to look at why 

2150
01:41:49,361 --> 01:41:52,510
you went on them in the first place.
And then there's a whole nother layer of

2151
01:41:52,511 --> 01:41:53,344
just,
it's being really physically disabling 

2152
01:41:54,571 --> 01:41:55,404
in some cases to come off these meds and
it really brings you to your knees 

2153
01:41:58,841 --> 01:41:59,674
sometimes.
And so a lot of what I think of myself 

2154
01:42:01,481 --> 01:42:04,630
as doing is just like a holding space 
for that process to happen.

2155
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:06,333
And then once it happens,
they move through into this like 

2156
01:42:09,371 --> 01:42:10,204
awakened stay.
I mean the vast majority of my patients 

2157
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:16,210
and you know online course completers go
on to become healers.

2158
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:19,690
Why else would that happen if they will?

2159
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,580
People crazy.
That's why you're turned to healers,

2160
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:23,933
but surely a massive blow back from just
conventional psychiatric medicine 

2161
01:42:32,101 --> 01:42:34,590
practitioners who are looking at what 
you're saying and like,

2162
01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:38,250
so you're telling someone all they have 
to do is just stop eating sugar and they

2163
01:42:38,251 --> 01:42:40,680
won't be psychotic anymore.
That's fucking crazy.

2164
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:43,080
I know you're not saying that,
but I'm,

2165
01:42:43,081 --> 01:42:43,914
I'm boiling it down to that.
You're saying that you took this woman 

2166
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:46,883
and you took her off of processed foods,
you made her eat healthy vegetables and 

2167
01:42:50,761 --> 01:42:51,594
meat and eggs and healthy fats,
coconut oil and avocado oil and detox 

2168
01:42:55,951 --> 01:42:59,190
and medication and all the inflammation 
went away.

2169
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:01,550
The problem of the,
the,

2170
01:43:01,551 --> 01:43:06,551
the insulin spikes and all the blood 
sugar spikes that goes away and then the

2171
01:43:06,751 --> 01:43:10,080
body somehow or another comes back to 
some sort of a baseline.

2172
01:43:10,130 --> 01:43:11,510
That's right.
And you know,

2173
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:14,180
in the New England Journal of Medicine 
recently,

2174
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:16,190
there was a case report,
right?

2175
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:17,053
37 year old woman who was so psychotic 
that her family took out a restraining 

2176
01:43:21,351 --> 01:43:22,400
order on her.
Okay.

2177
01:43:22,401 --> 01:43:23,390
Paranoid,
delusional,

2178
01:43:23,391 --> 01:43:24,224
totally psychotic.
She was treated with risperdal and 

2179
01:43:26,481 --> 01:43:27,314
Zoloft and anti psychotic and an 
antidepressant which did nothing a year 

2180
01:43:30,771 --> 01:43:31,604
of this nonsense.
Later she was finally diagnosed with 

2181
01:43:34,371 --> 01:43:35,790
gluten sensitivity.
Okay,

2182
01:43:35,791 --> 01:43:37,070
so wheat sensitivity,
right.

2183
01:43:37,430 --> 01:43:39,680
They put her on a three.
This is in the hospital.

2184
01:43:39,681 --> 01:43:43,130
This is not like in some quacks office,
you know in,

2185
01:43:43,131 --> 01:43:44,600
in boulder they,

2186
01:43:44,890 --> 01:43:47,040
there you go.
After bulldog.

2187
01:43:47,650 --> 01:43:49,300
It's one spot though.
That is a spot.

2188
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:51,070
And Sedona,
that's an incident.

2189
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:52,000
I'm going actually

2190
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:54,380
next week.
I can't wait to check it out.

2191
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:56,120
Totally.
So.

2192
01:43:56,121 --> 01:43:59,090
So in three months on this strict gluten
free diet,

2193
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:02,030
she was totally normal again.
Wow.

2194
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:07,090
So this is not like a wellness fad.
There are real route drivers,

2195
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:09,200
but we don't know what it is for you.
Right?

2196
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:11,540
Like I said,
it could be physiologic where it's like,

2197
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:13,700
you know,
there's a similar story about a lifelong

2198
01:44:13,701 --> 01:44:15,830
vegetarian woman.
This is in the published literature,

2199
01:44:16,150 --> 01:44:18,800
um,
who became psychotically depressed,

2200
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:23,910
was admitted for Catatonia.
Catatonia is like the worst diagnosis in

2201
01:44:25,130 --> 01:44:25,963
psychiatry.
Right?

2202
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:30,440
She's basically unresponsive.
She was so mentally ill.

2203
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:31,303
Okay.
They treated her with electric shock 

2204
01:44:33,111 --> 01:44:36,620
therapy because the antipsychotics and 
antidepressants,

2205
01:44:36,621 --> 01:44:37,730
they,
they used didn't work.

2206
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,820
Finally she gets transferred to announce
that hospital cause they were like,

2207
01:44:40,821 --> 01:44:41,654
well,
we don't know what to do with this 

2208
01:44:41,811 --> 01:44:44,480
woman.
They check her b 12 level and it's like,

2209
01:44:44,930 --> 01:44:46,400
you know,
tanked.

2210
01:44:46,850 --> 01:44:48,830
They give her a couple of b 12 
injections.

2211
01:44:48,860 --> 01:44:52,130
And not only is she better,
but she's better than she's been in like

2212
01:44:52,131 --> 01:44:52,964
14 years from a couple of b 12.
And so my point is that for her it was 

2213
01:44:57,210 --> 01:44:58,730
b12.
For her it was week.

2214
01:44:58,731 --> 01:45:00,290
For someone else,
it could be blood sugar,

2215
01:45:00,291 --> 01:45:02,180
instability for someone else.
Thyroid,

2216
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:03,253
autoimmune thyroid can make you crazy,
can make you suicidal according to the 

2217
01:45:08,061 --> 01:45:09,350
literature.
It's not a theory,

2218
01:45:09,351 --> 01:45:10,184
right?
You ever had anybody that you put on 

2219
01:45:10,911 --> 01:45:14,740
this diet and they didn't respond,
they stayed psychotic or whatever.

2220
01:45:15,860 --> 01:45:16,693
Here's why.
Not a long time because I screened for 

2221
01:45:21,681 --> 01:45:23,240
readiness,
right?

2222
01:45:23,241 --> 01:45:27,860
So I screened for a mindset and that's 
what we're talking about earlier because

2223
01:45:27,890 --> 01:45:28,723
if you're ready and you believe that 
you'd like a whole radical next chapter 

2224
01:45:32,871 --> 01:45:35,910
of your life is like forthcoming,
then I,

2225
01:45:36,050 --> 01:45:38,870
I'm just part of the ritual,
you know?

2226
01:45:39,410 --> 01:45:42,920
And it's like using the placebo effect 
even,

2227
01:45:43,130 --> 01:45:44,000
I don't know.
I mean,

2228
01:45:44,001 --> 01:45:44,834
I'm very interested in science,
but it is a belief that if you don't 

2229
01:45:49,461 --> 01:45:52,760
believe that this is going to do 
anything for you and you're a skeptic,

2230
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:55,070
it won't.
It won't.

2231
01:45:55,130 --> 01:45:59,210
And I can show you all the science in 
the world and it won't work for you.

2232
01:45:59,240 --> 01:46:02,510
But the physiological changes of 
adjusting your diet,

2233
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:03,530
those are real.
Right?

2234
01:46:03,620 --> 01:46:06,890
So like why won't it?
But your beliefs can even override that.

2235
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:08,360
Whoa.
I think that's true.

2236
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:10,700
Okay.
So I'll tell you about another study.

2237
01:46:10,910 --> 01:46:11,743
So these are people like your friends 
and millions of others who think they 

2238
01:46:15,561 --> 01:46:18,290
are treated to remission.
Think medication really helped them.

2239
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,090
Right?
With PROZAC.

2240
01:46:20,450 --> 01:46:21,350
Okay.
So they're like,

2241
01:46:21,351 --> 01:46:22,760
well on Prozac,
okay,

2242
01:46:22,940 --> 01:46:23,773
so they're put in this study 12 week 
study and they get to either stay with 

2243
01:46:27,381 --> 01:46:28,214
their same dose of Prozac that helped 
them or they get crossed over to the 

2244
01:46:32,361 --> 01:46:34,460
placebo arm,
the sugar pill arm,

2245
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:37,370
and they don't know which is going to 
happen.

2246
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:38,593
Right.
So what happened interestingly in that 

2247
01:46:40,191 --> 01:46:43,070
study is that the time they were crossed
over or not,

2248
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:44,503
they both,
both groups became statistically 

2249
01:46:47,781 --> 01:46:49,590
significantly depressed,
right?

2250
01:46:49,591 --> 01:46:52,080
So like Mary takes her 40 milligrams on 
Tuesday,

2251
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:56,790
enters the study is still taking her 40 
milligrams like next Thursday.

2252
01:46:56,791 --> 01:46:57,624
But now all of a sudden she's acutely 
depressed just because of the 

2253
01:46:59,341 --> 01:47:02,160
possibility that she might have gotten 
the sugar pill.

2254
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:03,173
That's called the no cbo effect.
So the no cbo effect is the impact of 

2255
01:47:06,991 --> 01:47:07,824
fear or negative beliefs that limit your
ability to respond to a given 

2256
01:47:11,341 --> 01:47:13,350
intervention.
It's real.

2257
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:18,450
It's more important than anything we're 
actually doing is what you believe

2258
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:20,173
convinces you that Krispy Kreme donuts 
and could fix you literally might be 

2259
01:47:27,001 --> 01:47:27,834
some truth to that.

2260
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:29,060
There could be.
And,

2261
01:47:29,061 --> 01:47:29,894
and I will,
I would have Kuwait on some level like 

2262
01:47:31,531 --> 01:47:32,364
psych meds with Krispy Kreme donuts.
So there are some people who are going 

2263
01:47:34,401 --> 01:47:35,460
to say like,
wow,

2264
01:47:35,461 --> 01:47:36,810
that really helped me.
So,

2265
01:47:36,811 --> 01:47:38,880
so this Guy Irving Kirsch,
right?

2266
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:42,600
He's a psychologist who's,
who's like a placebo effect expert.

2267
01:47:42,601 --> 01:47:43,434
Arguably what,
what he identified was that when you 

2268
01:47:46,171 --> 01:47:49,470
control for what's called the active 
placebo effect,

2269
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:53,100
which is what happens when you feel the 
side effects,

2270
01:47:53,101 --> 01:47:53,934
you've been warned about of a given 
medication and then you feel the 

2271
01:47:58,591 --> 01:48:01,620
medication is working and then it 
actually works,

2272
01:48:01,770 --> 01:48:02,603
right?
So when you control for the active 

2273
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:08,130
placebo effect by giving people in a,
in a trial,

2274
01:48:08,500 --> 01:48:09,390
um,
uh,

2275
01:48:09,391 --> 01:48:12,290
antidepressant,
but then also a medication like atrazine

2276
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:14,820
for example,
that has very similar side effects,

2277
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:16,680
dry mouth,
headache,

2278
01:48:16,681 --> 01:48:17,670
constipation,
this kind of thing.

2279
01:48:18,330 --> 01:48:19,163
There's no difference.
So what he showed is that there is no 

2280
01:48:21,931 --> 01:48:22,764
statistically significant effect of 
antidepressants above and beyond 

2281
01:48:26,820 --> 01:48:27,600
placebo.

2282
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:31,440
And that the reason that people believe 
that they're working and they are right,

2283
01:48:31,441 --> 01:48:36,441
so they believe it and then they do is 
because they feel a shift.

2284
01:48:36,570 --> 01:48:40,680
They feel a change and they've been 
educated by commercials and their doctor

2285
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:44,070
maybe about these side effects.
And then they start to say,

2286
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:48,480
oh,
my chemical imbalances being adjusted.

2287
01:48:48,490 --> 01:48:49,950
Right?
So it's a,

2288
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:52,350
it's subtle,
but this is not just in psychiatry.

2289
01:48:52,351 --> 01:48:55,980
It's really relevant to psychiatry,
but it's true in surgery.

2290
01:48:56,220 --> 01:48:57,053
You know,
they do sham operations in orthopedics 

2291
01:48:58,771 --> 01:49:00,720
and it's true in,
in even,

2292
01:49:00,721 --> 01:49:02,120
you know,
um,

2293
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:03,780
pain management,
you know,

2294
01:49:03,781 --> 01:49:07,840
that the placebo effect is so real and 
it's not like you're being fooled.

2295
01:49:07,841 --> 01:49:08,581
So like,
you know,

2296
01:49:08,581 --> 01:49:10,260
like in,
in my training,

2297
01:49:10,261 --> 01:49:12,120
I was taught to dismiss the placebo 
effect.

2298
01:49:12,121 --> 01:49:14,430
Like some nuisance,
we have to control for it,

2299
01:49:14,431 --> 01:49:15,810
but it's,
if we could,

2300
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:18,450
Bruce Lipton said this,
like if we could harness this,

2301
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:22,140
we would have a side effect free 
medicine for everyone,

2302
01:49:22,410 --> 01:49:24,030
you know,
but we don't study it.

2303
01:49:24,031 --> 01:49:24,864
We don't understand it.
And we just assume it's like people 

2304
01:49:27,451 --> 01:49:28,650
being tricked or something,

2305
01:49:28,690 --> 01:49:30,950
they go onto placebo effects.
Fairly Limited.

2306
01:49:30,951 --> 01:49:31,910
Like nothing really truly

2307
01:49:32,170 --> 01:49:33,520
miraculous.
It's true.

2308
01:49:33,550 --> 01:49:34,383
It's about 30%.
But that's exactly the efficacy of 

2309
01:49:37,571 --> 01:49:39,790
antidepressants is,
is around 30%.

2310
01:49:41,410 --> 01:49:46,410
So there was a study once that was done 
on some,

2311
01:49:47,710 --> 01:49:48,543
a kid

2312
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:52,610
who had some horrible war disease,
um,

2313
01:49:52,630 --> 01:49:53,463
where they,
it was incurable and it was like 

2314
01:49:55,121 --> 01:49:57,490
spreading all over their body,
over their arm,

2315
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:58,593
do you know,
this study?

2316
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:04,380
And they gave this kid some sort of a 
placebo and it completely cleared it up.

2317
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,700
And that's amazing.
I should know that.

2318
01:50:07,870 --> 01:50:10,360
Yeah.
And then when they found out that it was

2319
01:50:10,361 --> 01:50:11,194
a placebo,
then it became a problem and I think it 

2320
01:50:12,341 --> 01:50:13,610
came back.
Yeah,

2321
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:14,440
yeah,
yeah.

2322
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:15,273
Um,
I think that there's something going on 

2323
01:50:17,921 --> 01:50:19,840
with the mind and the body.
Right.

2324
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:22,420
And that's what the placebo effect is 
demonstrating.

2325
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:25,500
Right?
But this is unharnessed and this is uh,

2326
01:50:25,570 --> 01:50:26,403
untrained and this is very different 
than what's going on with the mind with 

2327
01:50:29,321 --> 01:50:30,154
meditation,
which is harnessed and trained and 

2328
01:50:32,201 --> 01:50:37,201
focused.
So your thought is that this mine factor

2329
01:50:37,780 --> 01:50:40,590
is not just an inconvenience,
it's not just a,

2330
01:50:40,591 --> 01:50:41,424
a variable,
but maybe one of the most crucial 

2331
01:50:43,271 --> 01:50:45,310
aspects to overall health,

2332
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:48,230
if not the most crucial.
Yeah.

2333
01:50:48,470 --> 01:50:49,303
And again,
conventional medicine is interested in 

2334
01:50:50,601 --> 01:50:51,434
this to some extent.
Now noticing that what people believe 

2335
01:50:54,861 --> 01:50:57,740
like that,
you'll lose less blood in surgery if you

2336
01:50:57,741 --> 01:51:01,400
visualize losing less blood and surgery,
that that actually happens.

2337
01:51:01,401 --> 01:51:05,300
How can you control the physiologic 
activity of your body?

2338
01:51:05,301 --> 01:51:06,890
But you can,
that's what I'm saying.

2339
01:51:06,891 --> 01:51:09,170
Like we have soft proof that it's,
it's a,

2340
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:10,033
it's a study on power.
How did they convince them that they're 

2341
01:51:12,321 --> 01:51:13,730
gonna lose last broad?
They met it.

2342
01:51:13,731 --> 01:51:16,850
They visualize it,
they meditate on it and visualize losing

2343
01:51:16,851 --> 01:51:17,684
less blood.
So they have one group that says you're 

2344
01:51:19,431 --> 01:51:23,840
going to do a visualization where you 
just like visualize your body letting go

2345
01:51:23,841 --> 01:51:26,120
of less blood after the surgery or 
during the surgery.

2346
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:27,133
And then the other group does,
does their thing know if you have one 

2347
01:51:28,941 --> 01:51:29,691
group you say,
dude,

2348
01:51:29,691 --> 01:51:31,670
you're gonna Spray like a fountain.

2349
01:51:32,010 --> 01:51:32,843
He'll look a broken fire hydrant.
You're going to just big gush over the 

2350
01:51:35,601 --> 01:51:37,540
table.
You're going to be a sprinkler.

2351
01:51:37,610 --> 01:51:39,290
You're right.
You should conduct this study.

2352
01:51:39,291 --> 01:51:40,124
That would be fascinating to see if the 
no CBO affects would have it probably 

2353
01:51:43,641 --> 01:51:45,350
would they?
Probably what?

2354
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:45,651
Uh,
yeah,

2355
01:51:45,651 --> 01:51:46,484
I would imagine there's probably a way 
you could mind fuck someone into some 

2356
01:51:49,801 --> 01:51:51,080
terrible state.
Right?

2357
01:51:51,330 --> 01:51:52,163
That so you know where we see this is in
cancer diagnosis is called medical 

2358
01:51:55,071 --> 01:51:56,540
hexing.
That you know,

2359
01:51:56,541 --> 01:51:59,110
when you are diagnosed with cancer,
your risk of your,

2360
01:51:59,111 --> 01:52:00,800
you know,
the completion of suicide,

2361
01:52:00,801 --> 01:52:05,801
but also other accidents and your health
basically declines simply because of the

2362
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:08,600
diagnosis.
And that's why it's considered to be,

2363
01:52:08,601 --> 01:52:10,880
it's like bone pointing or something.
So it's Voodoo.

2364
01:52:10,881 --> 01:52:11,714
It's what we've always known that like 
someone could put a hex on you and if 

2365
01:52:13,791 --> 01:52:15,500
you know that a hex is on you,
you're like,

2366
01:52:15,501 --> 01:52:17,150
God damn,
there's a God damn hex on me.

2367
01:52:17,270 --> 01:52:21,560
That's when you start believing it and 
then it could really cause a huge issue.

2368
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:23,060
I,
that's what I,

2369
01:52:23,061 --> 01:52:23,894
it has become clear to me is real and we
don't want to think about it that way 

2370
01:52:26,541 --> 01:52:28,850
because we think medicine is science and
it's,

2371
01:52:29,090 --> 01:52:30,260
you know,
this,

2372
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:31,970
you know,
sort of impenetrable.

2373
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:33,920
Well you know the hallowed halls of 
truth,

2374
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:36,380
but it's a religion just like anything 
else.

2375
01:52:36,381 --> 01:52:37,161
In fact,
nick and Saul is,

2376
01:52:37,161 --> 01:52:37,994
my mentor said it's the last really 
unrecognized religion on the planet is 

2377
01:52:41,691 --> 01:52:42,524
medicine and you know,
we have special language and we were 

2378
01:52:44,301 --> 01:52:46,280
costumes.
There's initiatory

2379
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:47,840
rights.
We're talking about the hazing process

2380
01:52:48,730 --> 01:52:49,563
real in a lot of aspects like the 
medicine involved in treating a 

2381
01:52:53,531 --> 01:52:55,690
bacterial infection,
antibiotics,

2382
01:52:56,070 --> 01:52:58,570
medicine involved in healing,
a broken arm.

2383
01:52:58,870 --> 01:52:59,411
You know,
there's,

2384
01:52:59,411 --> 01:53:00,244
there's real stuff there too.
Next is a whole nother conversation for 

2385
01:53:03,971 --> 01:53:05,920
sure.
Emergency medicine.

2386
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:06,911
Listen,
if,

2387
01:53:06,911 --> 01:53:09,040
if you know,
I get hit by a bus,

2388
01:53:09,041 --> 01:53:09,874
don't like bring me to my,
don't pronounce my natural path in her 

2389
01:53:13,300 --> 01:53:15,680
is going to love it.
Exactly.

2390
01:53:15,820 --> 01:53:17,920
It's gonna be fine.
Just go changing my body,

2391
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:19,870
um,
for emergencies

2392
01:53:19,870 --> 01:53:22,420
sees that's what conventional medicine 
is really designed for.

2393
01:53:22,421 --> 01:53:25,900
We only ran into trouble when we started
extrapolating from acute,

2394
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:27,153
uh,
setting medicine into the outpatient 

2395
01:53:29,051 --> 01:53:29,540
world.

2396
01:53:29,540 --> 01:53:32,570
Well also the denial of the aspects of 
nutrition.

2397
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:35,450
I did denial the influence of nutrition 
like this,

2398
01:53:35,451 --> 01:53:36,284
this idea of the only concentrating on 
the medicine and not concentrating on 

2399
01:53:39,381 --> 01:53:40,214
what we know to be viable alternatives 
and things that can make your body 

2400
01:53:43,701 --> 01:53:46,280
healthier.
Like not taking that into account seems,

2401
01:53:46,730 --> 01:53:49,970
it seems almost insane.
It seems like you're going to fix a car.

2402
01:53:49,971 --> 01:53:50,804
Like I hear a banging,
I'm just gonna inflate these fucking 

2403
01:53:52,221 --> 01:53:53,510
tires and you know,
like,

2404
01:53:53,650 --> 01:53:54,590
well,
what about the engine?

2405
01:53:54,591 --> 01:53:57,050
There's a banging in the engine.
Should I fix the engine?

2406
01:53:57,051 --> 01:53:57,571
Like,
no,

2407
01:53:57,571 --> 01:53:58,190
no,
no.

2408
01:53:58,190 --> 01:54:01,030
I just turn off the alarm.
Like let's just turn the AC on.

2409
01:54:01,031 --> 01:54:01,864
Like it's almost like there's,
there's certain aspects they're looking 

2410
01:54:04,731 --> 01:54:09,731
at the aspects of medication and because
of all the aforementioned variables,

2411
01:54:11,211 --> 01:54:14,390
like student loans,
the consensus of your peers,

2412
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:15,493
everybody is in this sort of group 
together is all the unspoken word that 

2413
01:54:19,131 --> 01:54:20,960
you're not going to criticize the 
establishment.

2414
01:54:21,290 --> 01:54:22,820
And you can't really do that because if 
you do,

2415
01:54:22,821 --> 01:54:25,790
you're out of a job and all your money 
that you spend on God.

2416
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:29,340
Yeah,
I mean it's,

2417
01:54:29,370 --> 01:54:34,370
it's important to remember that the 
pharmaceutical industry is a business,

2418
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:36,060
right?
When you,

2419
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:39,020
when you forget that and you think that 
they're in it to protect your wellbeing,

2420
01:54:39,040 --> 01:54:39,873
help us.
I see.

2421
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,830
If you forget that,
which is easy to do,

2422
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:45,393
especially because they work with 
doctors and we think of doctors says 

2423
01:54:49,081 --> 01:54:50,110
priests sale,
right?

2424
01:54:50,730 --> 01:54:52,650
If you forget that,
then you can get into trouble.

2425
01:54:52,710 --> 01:54:53,543
Um,
because you take their word for 

2426
01:54:55,771 --> 01:54:59,080
something you perhaps should be doing a 
broader investigation on.

2427
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:02,040
But if you remember that it's a business
and it's very lucrative,

2428
01:55:02,041 --> 01:55:03,180
successful business,
I mean,

2429
01:55:03,181 --> 01:55:04,014
it's the business model of all time.
Then you'll look with some 

2430
01:55:07,561 --> 01:55:11,550
circumspection upon their claims and 
their approach.

2431
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:13,830
You know,
but our education as doctors is,

2432
01:55:13,890 --> 01:55:17,550
is totally through the lens of 
pharmaceutical model.

2433
01:55:17,551 --> 01:55:18,384
You know,
regulatory agencies famously like the 

2434
01:55:20,611 --> 01:55:23,010
FDA,
CDC and industry.

2435
01:55:23,010 --> 01:55:25,710
It's like a revolving door literally,
you know,

2436
01:55:25,711 --> 01:55:28,920
and this is totally available 
information on the Internet that they're

2437
01:55:28,950 --> 01:55:29,783
all the same people.
So we really do have the Fox guarding 

2438
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:34,860
the hen house and that's where we get 
into trouble.

2439
01:55:34,861 --> 01:55:35,694
If we don't have transparency around uh,
a true regulatory body that is not 

2440
01:55:40,380 --> 01:55:44,100
fiscally invested,
we're have a problem,

2441
01:55:44,101 --> 01:55:44,934
especially for presenting this as the 
only legitimate course of action for a 

2442
01:55:47,851 --> 01:55:49,290
sick patient.
You know,

2443
01:55:49,291 --> 01:55:50,124
where,
where you can actually as a parent have 

2444
01:55:51,931 --> 01:55:55,890
your children taken away from you if you
don't participate in the model.

2445
01:55:56,240 --> 01:55:57,073
Have there ever been any serious 
suggestions that we remove this whole 

2446
01:55:59,661 --> 01:56:04,130
ask your doctor commercial aspect of 
medicine?

2447
01:56:04,310 --> 01:56:05,580
Like it just seems,
to my knowledge,

2448
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:09,230
it seems so crazy that we know how 
influential commercials are,

2449
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:10,093
right?
I mean there are so influential and 

2450
01:56:11,541 --> 01:56:13,280
these are not just fact based 
commercials.

2451
01:56:13,430 --> 01:56:15,410
They've got cheery music.
Go on,

2452
01:56:15,411 --> 01:56:17,510
there's sunshine and butterflies and 
shit.

2453
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:20,060
And then it just makes you feel like 
super happy.

2454
01:56:20,061 --> 01:56:22,370
Like I want to be like these people,
they're smiling all the time.

2455
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:26,540
Totally conditioning crazy that,
that they can do that for drugs.

2456
01:56:26,630 --> 01:56:27,390
But you could argue,

2457
01:56:27,390 --> 01:56:30,840
you write that you're just empowering 
patients with knowledge,

2458
01:56:30,930 --> 01:56:31,621
um,
to,

2459
01:56:31,621 --> 01:56:33,480
to help themselves.
Right.

2460
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:35,970
Like that's why we're,
we're allowing the commercials.

2461
01:56:36,470 --> 01:56:37,420
Yeah.
Cause it's your doctor.

2462
01:56:37,421 --> 01:56:40,910
If abilify is going to keep you from 
jumping off a bridge or make you do it,

2463
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:41,833
ask your doctor like had,
so you said abilify was at one point in 

2464
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:46,460
time?
The most prescribed.

2465
01:56:46,550 --> 01:56:47,383
Yeah.
Recently it was the number one 

2466
01:56:47,901 --> 01:56:49,820
prescription,
I think it was two years ago.

2467
01:56:50,390 --> 01:56:51,950
Um,
synthroids always up there.

2468
01:56:52,370 --> 01:56:53,900
But yeah,
it was,

2469
01:56:53,901 --> 01:56:56,250
and it's,
it's because it's it,

2470
01:56:56,290 --> 01:56:57,123
there's these trends I guess these 
stylistic trends in prescribing that of 

2471
01:57:01,341 --> 01:57:02,174
course have no evidence based.
But in psychiatry we're really 

2472
01:57:04,581 --> 01:57:07,010
vulnerable to that because there isn't a
clear,

2473
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:08,233
you know,
a to B in terms of presenting symptoms 

2474
01:57:10,131 --> 01:57:13,040
and medication recommendation.
It's sort of a free for all,

2475
01:57:13,041 --> 01:57:15,860
you know,
you can pile on as many or as few as you

2476
01:57:15,861 --> 01:57:16,694
want.
And there are algorithms but they're 

2477
01:57:18,561 --> 01:57:19,550
very loose.

2478
01:57:19,620 --> 01:57:20,453
Well,
you're trying to say scientology's 

2479
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:23,730
right.
Who said that?

2480
01:57:24,450 --> 01:57:25,860
That's kind of what you're trying to 
say,

2481
01:57:26,190 --> 01:57:26,821
right?
I mean,

2482
01:57:26,821 --> 01:57:30,640
aren't they like Super Anti Scientology?
Remember when Tom Cruise was on,

2483
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:33,690
what's his face?
What's that dude's name?

2484
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:36,330
The Dude's name?
The Good Morning America guy.

2485
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:39,830
He nail our Matt Lauer.
Matt,

2486
01:57:40,690 --> 01:57:41,523
you're Glib.
Matt.

2487
01:57:41,530 --> 01:57:42,210
Yeah,
he's been on out,

2488
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:44,190
but an oprah who was one who was in 
love.

2489
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:45,293
He jumped off hand couch and he was in 
love like no straight man who's ever 

2490
01:57:48,211 --> 01:57:53,211
lived on the face of the planet.
He's his love.

2491
01:57:55,160 --> 01:57:57,960
Now I'm divorced,
but back then I was into it.

2492
01:57:58,270 --> 01:57:59,700
Um,
but no,

2493
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:00,593
when,
when he was saying that on the Good 

2494
01:58:03,001 --> 01:58:03,834
Morning America show with Matt Lauer,
he was essentially just saying what 

2495
01:58:06,571 --> 01:58:10,530
scientology has always said.
Like if you go down sunset or Hollywood,

2496
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:13,960
where's the psychiatry kills center?
Oh,

2497
01:58:13,961 --> 01:58:14,860
right.
You know,

2498
01:58:14,980 --> 01:58:15,813
I think it's on sunset.
There's some part of Hollywood people 

2499
01:58:19,571 --> 01:58:22,370
with like electro shock helmets on like,
ah,

2500
01:58:22,870 --> 01:58:24,910
like it's like psychiatry kills.
Like,

2501
01:58:24,911 --> 01:58:26,950
what is this?
It's a fucking scientology center.

2502
01:58:27,310 --> 01:58:28,330
If you go in there,
they're like,

2503
01:58:28,331 --> 01:58:29,164
you don't need scientology.
You need to hold onto these cans that 

2504
01:58:31,871 --> 01:58:34,510
are attached to the meter and we got to 
find out what's ticking,

2505
01:58:35,110 --> 01:58:35,943
you know,
and then they start manipulating your 

2506
01:58:37,601 --> 01:58:40,510
beliefs and that in turn helps you feel 
better.

2507
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:42,430
So there some sort of a correlation

2508
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:44,350
between the mind,
you know,

2509
01:58:44,380 --> 01:58:45,160
getting out.
I mean,

2510
01:58:45,160 --> 01:58:45,993
you know,
in a way like they're almost like not 

2511
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:49,210
totally misguided in their efforts.

2512
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:50,331
Right?
Yes.

2513
01:58:50,331 --> 01:58:52,870
And I would say an important difference,
um,

2514
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:55,100
in my perspective perhaps.
And there's,

2515
01:58:55,101 --> 01:58:57,240
is that I believe in like individually

2516
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:58,713
also,
you're not asking for 10% of all their 

2517
01:58:59,821 --> 01:59:04,050
income and you don't require two and a 
half hours of study every night.

2518
01:59:04,070 --> 01:59:04,903
Okay.

2519
01:59:05,220 --> 01:59:05,731
Yeah,
no,

2520
01:59:05,731 --> 01:59:07,410
it does.
So hopefully more differences than that,

2521
01:59:07,650 --> 01:59:08,490
but,
but no,

2522
01:59:08,491 --> 01:59:09,660
I mean it's,
you know,

2523
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:14,250
if you're a subsuming someone into a,
I don't want to say cult culture.

2524
01:59:14,251 --> 01:59:15,150
How about a culture?
Oh,

2525
01:59:15,151 --> 01:59:15,984
that's cool.
I'm just pause before you say the chair 

2526
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:20,070
called.
Sure.

2527
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:23,970
Then you're just transferring 
dependence,

2528
01:59:23,971 --> 01:59:25,680
you know,
from one model to the next.

2529
01:59:25,950 --> 01:59:26,783
And you know,
sort of my bag is to really become 

2530
01:59:29,430 --> 01:59:30,263
people back there.
Their power through a methodology 

2531
01:59:32,011 --> 01:59:33,150
that's,
you know,

2532
01:59:33,151 --> 01:59:34,380
their own alone

2533
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:39,040
that highlights why that stuff works for
people and why a lot of different things

2534
01:59:39,041 --> 01:59:39,874
work for people,
a lot of different kinds of religions 

2535
01:59:40,991 --> 01:59:41,824
and unfortunately a lot of different 
cults and a lot of different ideologies 

2536
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:46,960
and a lot of different mindsets do work 
for people.

2537
01:59:46,961 --> 01:59:49,660
Even fucking crossfit.
There was a great article that I've read

2538
01:59:49,661 --> 01:59:53,050
about equating crossfit to,
um,

2539
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:56,140
the fact that people do not have these 
religious groups,

2540
01:59:56,141 --> 01:59:56,974
they don't have these social bonding 
groups because they're not going to 

2541
01:59:58,661 --> 01:59:59,494
church anymore.
So now they're going to this gym and 

2542
02:00:00,670 --> 02:00:03,220
they'll like a lot of them literally 
call the gym church.

2543
02:00:03,490 --> 02:00:04,360
Totally.
Yeah.

2544
02:00:04,650 --> 02:00:08,730
Have you heard of the rat park studies 
rat park rat?

2545
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,790
Like the rodent?
What does which studies on what?

2546
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:12,893
So the,
there are these Canadian studies that 

2547
02:00:15,181 --> 02:00:17,730
basically looked at the addictive model 
of cocaine,

2548
02:00:17,731 --> 02:00:19,110
right?
So like you put,

2549
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:20,393
we know right,
that if you put a rat in a cage by 

2550
02:00:22,741 --> 02:00:25,680
itself and you give it the choice of 
water or cook or cocaine,

2551
02:00:25,820 --> 02:00:27,720
right,
it's going to drink the cocaine until it

2552
02:00:27,721 --> 02:00:28,770
dies.
Yeah.

2553
02:00:28,771 --> 02:00:29,361
I'm,
or at least,

2554
02:00:29,361 --> 02:00:30,191
but then these,
yeah.

2555
02:00:30,191 --> 02:00:32,040
So then these researchers were basically
like,

2556
02:00:32,220 --> 02:00:32,851
well,
hold on a minute.

2557
02:00:32,851 --> 02:00:35,010
That's like totally a natural 
environment for right to be.

2558
02:00:35,011 --> 02:00:35,844
And so if we,
what if we like put it in rat heaven 

2559
02:00:38,191 --> 02:00:39,024
where it can like have sex with the rats
and hang out and have like a community 

2560
02:00:42,241 --> 02:00:44,640
and there's things to play with and 
little wheels and whatever.

2561
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:45,990
Then what happens?

2562
02:00:45,990 --> 02:00:50,070
And if you give them cocaine or water,
they don't touch the cocaine and you can

2563
02:00:50,071 --> 02:00:54,570
even addict them in isolation and they 
will voluntarily detox in Rad Heaven,

2564
02:00:54,770 --> 02:00:55,870
isn't it?
Yeah.

2565
02:00:56,230 --> 02:00:57,450
So what does that mean?
Right?

2566
02:00:57,630 --> 02:01:01,860
It means that we fundamentally need 
community.

2567
02:01:01,890 --> 02:01:02,723
Like we need each other like it or not.
And we don't have that as a part of the 

2568
02:01:06,841 --> 02:01:08,790
fabric.
We live in boxes.

2569
02:01:09,180 --> 02:01:12,090
We don't know our neighbors.
Like we don't have communities anymore.

2570
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:15,810
Um,
and so any time we have the opportunity,

2571
02:01:15,811 --> 02:01:19,890
whether through aa or crossfit to to 
plug into a community,

2572
02:01:19,891 --> 02:01:24,650
we fixed something inside ourselves so 
we have less of a vulnerability to,

2573
02:01:24,651 --> 02:01:26,610
to abuse,
uh,

2574
02:01:26,611 --> 02:01:30,270
the effects of a substance like okay,
in her,

2575
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:31,313
right.
It doesn't have the rat park studies so 

2576
02:01:32,641 --> 02:01:33,474
important because so many people will 
cite that as evidenced that cocaine is 

2577
02:01:36,601 --> 02:01:39,620
so incredibly addictive when they,
when they find out about this,

2578
02:01:39,800 --> 02:01:40,010
because

2579
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:42,780
this is a different variation on that 
study and they,

2580
02:01:42,781 --> 02:01:43,250
oh,
well,

2581
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:44,090
oh,
okay,

2582
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:46,230
well I'm in a rat park.
Yeah.

2583
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:49,340
The context matters me,
you're kind of in a rat park every day.

2584
02:01:49,341 --> 02:01:52,670
If you're in a cubicle environment,
you're in your car in traffic,

2585
02:01:52,671 --> 02:01:54,740
or you're on the bus and no one's 
talking to anybody,

2586
02:01:54,820 --> 02:01:55,653
you're,
you're in your little cubicle by 

2587
02:01:56,421 --> 02:01:57,400
yourself,
you know,

2588
02:01:57,430 --> 02:01:59,270
with,
and then there's shared suffering that's

2589
02:01:59,271 --> 02:02:01,970
coming from things like crossfit.
We have these,

2590
02:02:01,990 --> 02:02:03,890
hey,
these moments are you bonding together.

2591
02:02:03,891 --> 02:02:04,790
I'm just like,
you guys are,

2592
02:02:04,791 --> 02:02:06,140
you know,
you're in the trenches,

2593
02:02:06,170 --> 02:02:07,040
right?
Yeah.

2594
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:08,460
Yeah.
There's something,

2595
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:12,530
there's something to yoga class like 
that people get all sot nom nom.

2596
02:02:12,531 --> 02:02:14,990
I stay on you.
I mean there's a lot of that.

2597
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:17,690
There's a lot of struggles.
It's hard.

2598
02:02:17,750 --> 02:02:19,190
It's hard.
Yeah,

2599
02:02:19,430 --> 02:02:20,263
yoga is really hard.
And that's part of what's good about it 

2600
02:02:22,431 --> 02:02:25,100
is that we need,
I think we need hard things.

2601
02:02:25,550 --> 02:02:26,383
I think your body,
if you're just constantly nerfed and 

2602
02:02:29,270 --> 02:02:30,103
everything's soft and everything's a f a
free ride and there's no ops or downs 

2603
02:02:33,651 --> 02:02:36,290
and everything's middle.
Like what is that?

2604
02:02:36,350 --> 02:02:38,360
That's not a human,
it's not live.

2605
02:02:38,990 --> 02:02:39,823
It's not what you're designed for.
So like when you're having a difficult 

2606
02:02:42,951 --> 02:02:45,140
window in your life,
you know,

2607
02:02:45,141 --> 02:02:47,570
and maybe you know why,
like you had a loss.

2608
02:02:47,740 --> 02:02:51,260
I mean you don't know why and things are
just off,

2609
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:52,393
right?
Like either you have a consciousness 

2610
02:02:53,991 --> 02:02:56,480
that says there's something here.
You know,

2611
02:02:56,481 --> 02:02:58,280
there's something to this.
There's some meaning to this.

2612
02:02:58,281 --> 02:03:00,800
I got to look deeper.
I got to pay attention to things.

2613
02:03:00,801 --> 02:03:03,170
I got to rebalance in different,
I got to up my game,

2614
02:03:03,171 --> 02:03:04,280
you know,
self care.

2615
02:03:04,970 --> 02:03:06,830
Or you're like,
this sucks.

2616
02:03:06,831 --> 02:03:07,664
I don't want to feel this way.
And there are thousands of prescribers 

2617
02:03:10,371 --> 02:03:12,350
like happy to open their door to you.

2618
02:03:12,710 --> 02:03:14,930
So that is really the problem,
right?

2619
02:03:15,140 --> 02:03:15,973
The real problem is that there's so many
different options other than what's 

2620
02:03:18,021 --> 02:03:18,854
going to make you healthy and there's so
many different ways to just numb this 

2621
02:03:22,401 --> 02:03:24,780
whole experience.
Just numb it all down.

2622
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:27,290
Like let's put some ice on a baby.
You're going to be fine.

2623
02:03:27,590 --> 02:03:29,750
Let's numb this whole thing down.
I,

2624
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:33,080
I have been of the opinion,
especially over the last few years,

2625
02:03:33,081 --> 02:03:36,920
I've really focused on this heavily and 
I've talked about it maybe too much,

2626
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:38,143
but I think people need to struggle in 
order to appreciate how nice things are 

2627
02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:49,070
and also to mitigate the effects of 
actual bad things that happen to you.

2628
02:03:49,190 --> 02:03:52,400
If you can do difficult,
hard things on a daily basis,

2629
02:03:52,401 --> 02:03:54,350
on a regular basis,
you know,

2630
02:03:54,351 --> 02:03:58,250
whatever your schedule allows for.
But whether it's martial arts or whether

2631
02:03:58,251 --> 02:04:00,680
it's yoga or whether it difficult 
struggle,

2632
02:04:00,740 --> 02:04:02,810
physical struggles where you have to 
test yourself.

2633
02:04:02,830 --> 02:04:04,010
Yeah,
we have to pull through.

2634
02:04:04,011 --> 02:04:06,980
You have to have discipline and resolve 
and it's hard to do.

2635
02:04:07,190 --> 02:04:08,023
When you get through that you,
you develop that muscle and that 

2636
02:04:11,271 --> 02:04:14,120
understanding of struggle and believe it
or not,

2637
02:04:14,300 --> 02:04:15,770
this is where it's going to seem really 
weird.

2638
02:04:15,830 --> 02:04:16,663
The struggle that you get in a yoga 
class is so much harder than the 

2639
02:04:19,971 --> 02:04:24,430
struggle that you'll ever experience 
outside of that make any sense.

2640
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:24,741
Like,
no,

2641
02:04:24,741 --> 02:04:26,780
you're going to work out like this is 
just like,

2642
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:28,310
no,
this is not spin class,

2643
02:04:28,311 --> 02:04:29,144
man.
This is something like very intense and 

2644
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:35,960
not that spin class I'm all about.
So second spin are too,

2645
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:37,980
I mean it's a

2646
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:40,260
bad example.
What I should say is it's not like going

2647
02:04:40,261 --> 02:04:41,094
to the gym and doing like a,
a simple round of like calisthenics or 

2648
02:04:44,421 --> 02:04:48,540
exercise or your discomfort.
Real serious discomfort,

2649
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:49,710
right?
Where you want to quit,

2650
02:04:49,890 --> 02:04:51,540
you want to stop and you have to push 
through.

2651
02:04:51,810 --> 02:04:55,740
And that intense focus on difficult 
things,

2652
02:04:56,010 --> 02:04:59,430
it makes life more bearable.
It makes more enjoyable.

2653
02:04:59,790 --> 02:05:02,220
My awakening,
so to speak,

2654
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:05,550
began when I gave birth for the first 
time,

2655
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:06,660
right?
Yeah.

2656
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:10,350
And I had a natural birth and she's 
doing a bathtub.

2657
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:11,193
Did you get crazy?
So the second time I did a birthing 

2658
02:05:12,721 --> 02:05:14,430
center the first time and second time I 
had a home birth.

2659
02:05:14,660 --> 02:05:16,700
Why'd you do that though?
What if there was anything wrong?

2660
02:05:16,701 --> 02:05:19,080
I need to get to the hospital.
Um,

2661
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:22,080
it's interesting because my first birth 
I was still in the matrix,

2662
02:05:22,081 --> 02:05:22,914
right.
So like I was still eating Mcdonald's 

2663
02:05:24,451 --> 02:05:25,284
and you know,
prescribing and you liked that kid less 

2664
02:05:27,541 --> 02:05:28,374
than the second code.

2665
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:31,470
You have the matrix baby.
It's totally.

2666
02:05:31,471 --> 02:05:33,920
Then it meanwhile she's like,
let's say age.

2667
02:05:34,050 --> 02:05:35,790
She had to compensate for all my dark 
energy.

2668
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:37,013
Um,
so I actually had a natural birth 

2669
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:43,920
because of the science because I was 
like in this real like no,

2670
02:05:43,921 --> 02:05:46,650
it all place in my life.
Um,

2671
02:05:46,670 --> 02:05:47,820
are,
believe it or not,

2672
02:05:47,821 --> 02:05:52,821
I've tried to move past that but I had 
this ob at the time and I was like,

2673
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:55,830
she doesn't know what she's talking 
about.

2674
02:05:56,190 --> 02:05:59,520
And I researched like,
what does the evidence show ob?

2675
02:05:59,521 --> 02:06:00,354
It's actually like psychiatry.
Only about 30% of obstetrical practices 

2676
02:06:03,301 --> 02:06:05,430
are evidence based and the rest is 
consensus.

2677
02:06:05,670 --> 02:06:06,503
Like the rest is just,
they're just doing it because they're 

2678
02:06:07,501 --> 02:06:10,380
doing it like the cords wrapped around 
the baby.

2679
02:06:10,850 --> 02:06:11,880
Dang.
What if nothing,

2680
02:06:11,881 --> 02:06:12,714
we've been doing this since the 
beginning of time and if you died since 

2681
02:06:15,091 --> 02:06:17,070
the beginning of time because of these 
things.

2682
02:06:17,070 --> 02:06:20,610
So we actually have a home birth versus 
hospital birth data,

2683
02:06:20,850 --> 02:06:23,270
which it should be totally unnecessary.
Right?

2684
02:06:23,430 --> 02:06:27,080
But we actually have it at this point to
demonstrate that that's like patent.

2685
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:29,070
It's fear mongering.
It's like patently false.

2686
02:06:29,071 --> 02:06:31,170
People do get choked by a biblical 
courts,

2687
02:06:31,171 --> 02:06:33,270
right?
Yes.

2688
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:35,340
Certainly.
Anything is possible.

2689
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:38,660
Of course that's going down.
But the truth is that when you,

2690
02:06:39,160 --> 02:06:42,480
when you researched the interventions 
you will find,

2691
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:43,373
so I had a natural birth because the 
research that I did on the 

2692
02:06:46,231 --> 02:06:48,210
interventions,
things like fetal monitoring,

2693
02:06:48,211 --> 02:06:49,260
a PCR,
atomy,

2694
02:06:49,590 --> 02:06:52,570
even ultrasound,
let alone csection,

2695
02:06:53,450 --> 02:06:55,170
you know,
antibiotics during delivery,

2696
02:06:55,171 --> 02:06:56,004
et cetera.
What I found was that there wasn't 

2697
02:06:57,301 --> 02:06:58,134
science to support them and actually the
science suggests that they should be 

2698
02:06:59,851 --> 02:07:00,684
abandoned.
So what I was left with was the code of 

2699
02:07:03,270 --> 02:07:06,060
silence with Josh should be abandoned.
These interventions.

2700
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:07,740
C-Sections.
Yeah.

2701
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:08,850
Oh,
I mean the consensus,

2702
02:07:08,851 --> 02:07:10,780
even the WHO,
um,

2703
02:07:10,830 --> 02:07:11,663
which is part of the machine,
but even even the WHO says they should 

2704
02:07:14,521 --> 02:07:16,530
be less than 10%.
I mean,

2705
02:07:16,531 --> 02:07:19,050
they're over in New York,
there are upwards of almost,

2706
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:21,100
almost 40% of births.
Birds.

2707
02:07:21,730 --> 02:07:25,290
Are they doing that to save the vaginas?
They're doing it because they don't want

2708
02:07:25,291 --> 02:07:27,660
to feel bad feelings and they don't want
to feel pain.

2709
02:07:27,930 --> 02:07:28,763
It's exactly what we're talking about.
I've heard women like specifically say 

2710
02:07:31,441 --> 02:07:35,470
they don't want to get stretched out.
I don't think that's a big yes,

2711
02:07:35,510 --> 02:07:36,160
certainly.

2712
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:37,360
But I don't think that's a huge 
motivator.

2713
02:07:37,361 --> 02:07:38,194
I think people are really,
women have been made to feel afraid of 

2714
02:07:40,841 --> 02:07:41,674
their own bodies.
It's the birth control thing we were 

2715
02:07:42,761 --> 02:07:43,594
talking about earlier.
If you think of your body as a total 

2716
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:47,590
pain,
you know,

2717
02:07:47,591 --> 02:07:51,100
that's dangerous,
is gonna fuck up at any given time.

2718
02:07:51,101 --> 02:07:52,150
And you're going to,
you know,

2719
02:07:52,151 --> 02:07:54,850
wish you had listened to your,
you know,

2720
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:57,250
doctor who's a man and he's never had a 
baby.

2721
02:07:57,730 --> 02:08:01,750
Then you could obviously be led down 
this path that says,

2722
02:08:01,930 --> 02:08:02,763
let me manage your body.
I know better science knows better how 

2723
02:08:05,111 --> 02:08:06,850
to do this.
Your body,

2724
02:08:06,950 --> 02:08:08,950
it messes up all the time.
Right?

2725
02:08:09,100 --> 02:08:11,650
So that's the mentality.
And in that mentality,

2726
02:08:11,890 --> 02:08:12,723
in my opinion,
is that you're robbed of this 

2727
02:08:14,591 --> 02:08:15,424
opportunity,
like psychedelic level opportunity to 

2728
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:22,840
have a transformation of your 
consciousness.

2729
02:08:23,020 --> 02:08:26,800
Because it is hard and it is scary and 
it breaks your mind.

2730
02:08:26,890 --> 02:08:31,890
My mind broke on that day broke,
and it's never been recovered because it

2731
02:08:33,281 --> 02:08:37,390
was literally so intense that my mind 
was telling me,

2732
02:08:37,391 --> 02:08:38,230
you're gonna die.
You're gonna die,

2733
02:08:38,231 --> 02:08:39,190
you're gonna die,
you're gonna die.

2734
02:08:40,030 --> 02:08:41,830
It's like pain.
But it's more,

2735
02:08:42,190 --> 02:08:44,470
more than that.
It's not pain that you've ever,

2736
02:08:44,770 --> 02:08:49,770
you would recognize because it's,
it's purposeful pain.

2737
02:08:49,901 --> 02:08:51,850
It's not just a signal of something 
wrong,

2738
02:08:52,510 --> 02:08:53,230
right?
So it's,

2739
02:08:53,230 --> 02:08:54,063
it's a sensation that is a part of the 
process of moving a human being through 

2740
02:08:59,230 --> 02:09:01,030
an out of your body.
So it's not,

2741
02:09:01,031 --> 02:09:02,290
we call it pain,
but you know,

2742
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:04,240
midwives don't call it pain,
for example.

2743
02:09:04,270 --> 02:09:06,550
It's not pleasure either.
It's just another thing.

2744
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:08,900
It's another thing.
So screaming,

2745
02:09:10,750 --> 02:09:13,150
because when you're in that intense 
portal,

2746
02:09:13,151 --> 02:09:14,350
you moan,
you have the,

2747
02:09:14,351 --> 02:09:16,660
there are these primal sounds.
We make,

2748
02:09:16,900 --> 02:09:17,733
you know,
when we're making love or when we're 

2749
02:09:18,701 --> 02:09:20,140
experiencing,
you know,

2750
02:09:20,141 --> 02:09:23,140
fear when we're,
we're really in it,

2751
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:25,620
you know,
we make those kinds of sounds and,

2752
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:27,700
and,
and there is a lot of fear.

2753
02:09:28,030 --> 02:09:30,730
But ultimately if you don't succumb to 
it,

2754
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:32,890
you,
it breaks and you see,

2755
02:09:33,430 --> 02:09:35,530
oh that was trying to tell me I couldn't
do this and look,

2756
02:09:35,531 --> 02:09:36,270
I just did it.

2757
02:09:36,270 --> 02:09:37,103
Do you ever think that if you could meet
your old self that your old self bilic 

2758
02:09:42,630 --> 02:09:45,150
listen to this crazy bitch?
100%.

2759
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:50,460
I wouldn't even have hung out with me.
Like talk to me at a bar.

2760
02:09:50,520 --> 02:09:52,440
Coon lenient placebos.
Huh?

2761
02:09:52,470 --> 02:09:53,700
What do you want me to do?
Eat eggs.

2762
02:09:53,730 --> 02:09:57,340
The Fuck Outta here.
This girl is crazy pills.

2763
02:09:57,650 --> 02:09:59,040
Oh,
you need pills?

2764
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:00,113
You're delusional.
You're talking about healers and 

2765
02:10:02,611 --> 02:10:03,444
holistic medicine.
It would have been the eye roll all 

2766
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:08,370
total.
That's hilarious.

2767
02:10:08,371 --> 02:10:09,320
How do you,
uh,

2768
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:11,320
how do you,
you know,

2769
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:12,503
reconcile that?
Because I feel myself like I feel 100% 

2770
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:18,263
myself.

2771
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:19,173
And that is,
it's there's zero self conscious aspect 

2772
02:10:21,311 --> 02:10:22,144
of it where you do recognize that there 
are certain science based practitioners 

2773
02:10:25,481 --> 02:10:27,100
that will be like rolling their eyes at 
you.

2774
02:10:27,130 --> 02:10:27,880
Oh,
I don't care.

2775
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:28,950
You don't care.
I don't

2776
02:10:28,950 --> 02:10:30,450
care about that.
And it was interesting,

2777
02:10:30,451 --> 02:10:31,284
right?
So I published this book last year in 

2778
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:33,853
March,
but what's it called again and mind of 

2779
02:10:34,701 --> 02:10:35,534
your own and I published it.
It was really weird experience because 

2780
02:10:39,140 --> 02:10:40,000
I,
you know,

2781
02:10:40,001 --> 02:10:42,440
I was total newbie.
I'd never written a book before,

2782
02:10:42,441 --> 02:10:43,274
whatever and out the gate I got like 
this very generous advance from a 

2783
02:10:46,761 --> 02:10:47,594
mainstream publisher,
which shocked me and then it comes time 

2784
02:10:51,051 --> 02:10:54,830
to publish it and they can't get me on a
single,

2785
02:10:55,450 --> 02:10:56,283
you know the today show Doctor Oz 60 
minutes and they're used to waltzing 

2786
02:11:00,261 --> 02:11:01,094
their authors who they give these large 
advances to like write onto these 

2787
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:05,900
platforms,
right?

2788
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:09,470
Mainstream media platforms.
I told them is not going to work with me

2789
02:11:09,471 --> 02:11:11,180
like you haven't worked with someone 
like me before.

2790
02:11:11,181 --> 02:11:12,500
Trust me,
it's not going to work out.

2791
02:11:12,650 --> 02:11:15,050
These are all Pharma funded outlets,
even NPR,

2792
02:11:15,051 --> 02:11:16,370
pbs,
they all are.

2793
02:11:16,610 --> 02:11:17,710
So,
you know,

2794
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:19,100
we're going to have to come up with 
something else.

2795
02:11:19,101 --> 02:11:23,930
And ultimately they didn't listen and 
they started to Baz when I,

2796
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:26,330
a month before launch,
didn't have a single interview,

2797
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:31,280
they'd never had that happen before.
And so it was cool because alt media,

2798
02:11:31,490 --> 02:11:32,420
you know,
like this,

2799
02:11:32,421 --> 02:11:36,350
I just called on a bunch of my friends 
and colleagues and we,

2800
02:11:36,550 --> 02:11:39,140
it was like top 20 on Amazon within the 
first week.

2801
02:11:39,141 --> 02:11:42,260
And that's like the power,
like mainstream media is totally dead.

2802
02:11:42,261 --> 02:11:43,094
And I have tell you that,
but it was so quiet for like the whole 

2803
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:49,850
year afterward.
If you Google my book,

2804
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:50,713
there is not a negative review of this,
like very controversial text on the 

2805
02:11:54,771 --> 02:11:56,600
Internet.
Very weird.

2806
02:11:56,690 --> 02:12:01,690
Because we have trolls on our site every
single day on facebook for example.

2807
02:12:01,731 --> 02:12:02,870
Or you know,
twitter,

2808
02:12:02,900 --> 02:12:03,733
even instagram.
It's like part of the deal of being an 

2809
02:12:05,511 --> 02:12:06,344
activist is that you deal with 
astroturfing and you deal with that 

2810
02:12:08,151 --> 02:12:09,290
whole,
you know,

2811
02:12:09,291 --> 02:12:10,850
sort of strew turfing.

2812
02:12:11,060 --> 02:12:11,751
Oh yeah.
Oh,

2813
02:12:11,751 --> 02:12:13,370
you should.
There is um,

2814
02:12:13,940 --> 02:12:18,140
an amazing ted talk that you need to 
watch by Sharyl attkisson who's like a,

2815
02:12:18,230 --> 02:12:20,380
um,
a turncoat journalist,

2816
02:12:20,381 --> 02:12:21,650
right?
Like she used to be an anchor,

2817
02:12:21,651 --> 02:12:22,484
I don't know where.
And so she has this Ted talk on 

2818
02:12:23,841 --> 02:12:25,940
astroturfing and she basically breaks it
down.

2819
02:12:25,941 --> 02:12:28,340
Astroturfing is like what?
So the word,

2820
02:12:28,341 --> 02:12:31,190
right?
It's because it's like a fake grassroots

2821
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:33,530
movement.
I'm on social media,

2822
02:12:34,010 --> 02:12:34,843
right?
So it's paid industry paid bots 

2823
02:12:38,931 --> 02:12:43,931
basically who generate the impression 
that there is an opinion anti anyone who

2824
02:12:46,671 --> 02:12:49,100
threatens the establishment.
Right?

2825
02:12:49,340 --> 02:12:50,173
And then they,
there are people who like organically 

2826
02:12:53,301 --> 02:12:56,140
glom onto that.
So they create this,

2827
02:12:56,420 --> 02:12:57,171
this,
okay,

2828
02:12:57,171 --> 02:13:00,020
so they'll come on my site by the 
thousands.

2829
02:13:00,050 --> 02:13:00,883
Right.
And it immediately after a comment is 

2830
02:13:03,051 --> 02:13:04,970
written,
like you quack,

2831
02:13:04,971 --> 02:13:05,804
like,
where did you get that fake medical 

2832
02:13:06,951 --> 02:13:08,690
degree?
Like you're killing people.

2833
02:13:08,690 --> 02:13:11,600
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You're reckless and yeah,

2834
02:13:11,601 --> 02:13:12,434
exactly.
And they almost always call me it's 

2835
02:13:13,651 --> 02:13:15,680
water account.
That's like almost always part of it.

2836
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:19,310
That's how you know,
and there'll be like 500 likes within 10

2837
02:13:19,311 --> 02:13:20,144
minutes.
That's like one of the indications that 

2838
02:13:22,101 --> 02:13:24,050
it's a troll.
You know what I mean?

2839
02:13:24,051 --> 02:13:24,884
So like there'd be a face on the note 
that that's a troll and not just people 

2840
02:13:27,321 --> 02:13:29,750
resonating with this idea that the hate 
quarks,

2841
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:32,130
cause I don't have that many people on 
my facebook page so that that would ever

2842
02:13:32,131 --> 02:13:33,580
be a metric.
You know,

2843
02:13:34,810 --> 02:13:35,643
it's,
it's not even like probably 

2844
02:13:37,861 --> 02:13:41,450
algorithmically possible that it would 
be an organic phenomenon.

2845
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:42,353
Did you see that thing recently?
Jamie brought it up yesterday about 

2846
02:13:44,071 --> 02:13:44,904
Donald Trump that turns out that he just
had millions of bots follow him on 

2847
02:13:49,471 --> 02:13:50,304
twitter.
Just letting I know where it's like 

2848
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:55,350
something like 4 million bots.
Yeah.

2849
02:13:55,530 --> 02:13:57,600
Just joined on and everyone's like,
okay,

2850
02:13:57,601 --> 02:13:59,250
what's going on here?
What happened here?

2851
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:00,810
What is this?
These are fake accounts.

2852
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:02,640
Yeah.
It's like a thing that's,

2853
02:14:02,641 --> 02:14:03,474
you know,
it's not surprising that part of the 

2854
02:14:06,280 --> 02:14:07,113
data that they can manipulate.
This is half of president trump's 

2855
02:14:09,271 --> 02:14:11,070
twitter followers are bots.
Right?

2856
02:14:11,071 --> 02:14:13,440
Holy Shit,
this is so crazy.

2857
02:14:13,680 --> 02:14:14,513
So you generate the impression that 
there's a grassroots energy and that 

2858
02:14:18,390 --> 02:14:19,500
it's actually not real.

2859
02:14:19,580 --> 02:14:22,790
He picked up 3 million twitter followers
in recent days,

2860
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:25,970
most of which appear to be recently 
created twitter bots,

2861
02:14:25,971 --> 02:14:26,804
screenwriter,
John Nivon pointed out Tuesday morning 

2862
02:14:28,731 --> 02:14:31,730
that trump's account saw a big spike in 
followers over the weekend.

2863
02:14:31,880 --> 02:14:34,880
Most of them newly created accounts 
without photos or tweets,

2864
02:14:34,910 --> 02:14:35,743
right.
Tells Herald Times signs of twitter 

2865
02:14:37,131 --> 02:14:38,900
bots.
Wow,

2866
02:14:38,901 --> 02:14:42,980
that's crazy.
So that is something that they're doing.

2867
02:14:42,981 --> 02:14:43,814
They're making it an active campaign.
Sort of boast up is a public appeal and 

2868
02:14:48,210 --> 02:14:49,043
is

2869
02:14:49,320 --> 02:14:50,400
right.
And in that case,

2870
02:14:50,401 --> 02:14:52,140
you know,
I don't know specifically,

2871
02:14:52,141 --> 02:14:55,440
but in that case it would be to generate
the impression that it's grass roots.

2872
02:14:55,480 --> 02:14:56,191
Right?
When it's not.

2873
02:14:56,191 --> 02:14:58,010
That's why it's called astroturfing.
God,

2874
02:14:58,030 --> 02:14:59,530
it's fake grassroots.
Got It.

2875
02:14:59,560 --> 02:15:00,151
Got.
But yeah,

2876
02:15:00,151 --> 02:15:00,984
so,
so I have all that energy in my daily 

2877
02:15:03,451 --> 02:15:04,284
life,
but I didn't have a single negative 

2878
02:15:05,221 --> 02:15:07,440
review of this book in like a year left 
in the weird,

2879
02:15:07,490 --> 02:15:08,323
nope.

2880
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:11,450
Says it's false.
Why this is mostly false.

2881
02:15:11,860 --> 02:15:12,693
Since president trump,
like other twitter users with large 

2882
02:15:14,691 --> 02:15:15,524
following has a large number of 
followers that appear to be bots or 

2883
02:15:19,311 --> 02:15:23,500
inauthentic automated user profiles.
What's false?

2884
02:15:23,501 --> 02:15:24,334
Trump did not receive an influx of 5 
million new twitter followers in three 

2885
02:15:28,631 --> 02:15:30,070
days.
Oh,

2886
02:15:30,250 --> 02:15:31,860
so stops questioning.
Yeah.

2887
02:15:32,500 --> 02:15:34,570
How many did I thought they said 3 
million.

2888
02:15:36,080 --> 02:15:39,250
I mean,
it says as of May 1st it had 28.5

2889
02:15:39,251 --> 02:15:41,800
so it couldn't have gone up that fast 
over the month.

2890
02:15:41,830 --> 02:15:43,600
Cause it's Atlanta one and a half 
million gain.

2891
02:15:43,660 --> 02:15:45,280
I don't know.
Uh,

2892
02:15:45,870 --> 02:15:48,960
that's not even not abnormal for someone
with that many millions.

2893
02:15:48,990 --> 02:15:50,160
He is 28 million.

2894
02:15:52,150 --> 02:15:52,791
Oh,
it could go away.

2895
02:15:52,791 --> 02:15:54,230
I don't know.
The story just got weirder,

2896
02:15:54,231 --> 02:15:55,580
so,
yeah.

2897
02:15:56,840 --> 02:15:57,950
Hmm.
Hmm.

2898
02:15:58,280 --> 02:16:00,150
According to the image archive images,
twins,

2899
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:02,450
twitter page rumors of a surgeon.
Farmers were great.

2900
02:16:02,451 --> 02:16:04,220
Really exaggerated.
Wow.

2901
02:16:04,380 --> 02:16:05,450
That's,
that's,

2902
02:16:05,510 --> 02:16:07,490
that's fake news.
I mean,

2903
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:10,070
it's what he's talking about.
Kinda jumped on the fake story,

2904
02:16:10,071 --> 02:16:10,730
Jack.
Yeah.

2905
02:16:10,730 --> 02:16:12,860
But I'm sure there's a ton of bots 
following him.

2906
02:16:12,861 --> 02:16:14,750
I know there's a ton of bots following 
me.

2907
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:16,310
Yeah.
I get them all the time.

2908
02:16:16,311 --> 02:16:19,820
These women that are fake women that 
want to talk about sex.

2909
02:16:20,050 --> 02:16:23,180
I come to come chat with me about sex,
come sex me up.

2910
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:26,240
And they're like,
it's all like the worst broken English.

2911
02:16:26,510 --> 02:16:28,670
Like it's time to tried to have a 
conversation with them.

2912
02:16:28,671 --> 02:16:29,610
And that worked out.
Who?

2913
02:16:29,690 --> 02:16:30,040
Who

2914
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:30,970
explained it to it?
Yeah,

2915
02:16:30,971 --> 02:16:33,490
I tried to dm them.
They didn't ignore me.

2916
02:16:33,640 --> 02:16:38,640
Who tried to explain that to us that 
they use intentionally?

2917
02:16:39,670 --> 02:16:40,503
Was it malice?
Was it Michael Miles that they used 

2918
02:16:43,301 --> 02:16:47,590
intentionally shitty language so that if
you follow them,

2919
02:16:47,591 --> 02:16:48,424
like they're poor grammar,
sort of like alerts them to suspicious 

2920
02:16:51,461 --> 02:16:55,840
people so that suspicious people don't 
interact with them but dumb people.

2921
02:16:55,930 --> 02:16:56,763
So they are,
they're a honeypot that creates this 

2922
02:16:58,990 --> 02:16:59,823
environment that stupid people are 
attracted to it because they can't see 

2923
02:17:02,171 --> 02:17:04,420
that grammatical errors because they're 
dumb.

2924
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:05,433
And so it makes it more effective.
So these Nigerian scammers apparently 

2925
02:17:08,950 --> 02:17:09,783
purposely use bad grammar.
Like they're more than capable of using 

2926
02:17:13,061 --> 02:17:13,894
good English,
but they use the shitty grammar so that 

2927
02:17:15,581 --> 02:17:18,400
the people that they do get are just 
really dumb.

2928
02:17:18,460 --> 02:17:22,240
They're not trying to snag like I was 
trying to sell you the Ivy Leaguers.

2929
02:17:22,270 --> 02:17:24,730
Yeah.
Well anybody who's got a discerning idea

2930
02:17:24,731 --> 02:17:25,840
of,
you know what,

2931
02:17:25,841 --> 02:17:27,150
this may or may not be.
They're not,

2932
02:17:27,190 --> 02:17:28,023
they're not trying to get that.
They're trying to get the gullible and 

2933
02:17:30,101 --> 02:17:31,420
there's plenty of them.
Like,

2934
02:17:31,421 --> 02:17:32,920
why,
why go fishing for sharks?

2935
02:17:32,921 --> 02:17:34,680
We can catch guppies,
you know,

2936
02:17:34,690 --> 02:17:35,523
and get nets fully guppies.
They came to that in a way through the 

2937
02:17:37,271 --> 02:17:38,104
net.
It's this easy pickins still be able to 

2938
02:17:40,031 --> 02:17:41,530
talk and try to catch a whale.
Dude,

2939
02:17:41,531 --> 02:17:43,210
that's too much work.
You know,

2940
02:17:43,330 --> 02:17:45,070
it's really interesting though.
It's,

2941
02:17:45,071 --> 02:17:47,680
um,
I mean if that is how sophisticated they

2942
02:17:47,681 --> 02:17:49,840
truly are,
it's kind of fascinating.

2943
02:17:50,490 --> 02:17:52,840
But when sort of know this stuff,
then you can interpret it.

2944
02:17:53,010 --> 02:17:54,820
You know,
it just helps to be aware of it.

2945
02:17:55,090 --> 02:17:55,923
It would be a big,
big deal if we found out that 

2946
02:17:59,261 --> 02:18:00,094
pharmaceutical companies,
we're actively engaging in the use of 

2947
02:18:02,771 --> 02:18:04,480
these bots to attack people like you.

2948
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:05,553
Like if you had someone like wikileaks 
on your side to like dug into this shit 

2949
02:18:08,620 --> 02:18:09,453
and you know Scott,
some whistleblower from the 

2950
02:18:10,901 --> 02:18:15,700
pharmaceutical industry that cares and 
release that stuff,

2951
02:18:15,910 --> 02:18:16,743
that'd be pretty giant where I have some
colleagues working on that really don't 

2952
02:18:20,081 --> 02:18:23,050
tell people now they're going to try to 
cover their tracks.

2953
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:25,450
They'll never know.
No,

2954
02:18:25,451 --> 02:18:27,370
I mean,
and the truth is that I don't think it's

2955
02:18:27,371 --> 02:18:31,790
going to require that because I think 
people are waking up just by sheer,

2956
02:18:31,791 --> 02:18:33,760
it's like I synergy.
Like people are waking up,

2957
02:18:33,790 --> 02:18:34,623
they are calling bullshit on a lot of 
the heavy handed claims of the 

2958
02:18:38,441 --> 02:18:39,274
pharmaceutical industry.
They know that doctors aren't helping 

2959
02:18:40,871 --> 02:18:42,030
them.
You know,

2960
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:42,873
they know that the conventional model 
has very limited ability to help them 

2961
02:18:46,361 --> 02:18:48,490
and or they've tried it and it's not 
worked.

2962
02:18:48,700 --> 02:18:49,533
So people are waking up and that's why 
in more recent time I've focused my 

2963
02:18:52,361 --> 02:18:56,800
energy not on fighting the sis like some
David and Goliath situation,

2964
02:18:57,160 --> 02:18:57,993
but I,
I'm just focusing on making sure people 

2965
02:19:00,251 --> 02:19:03,910
know like what's possible.
It's like bucky fuller quote,

2966
02:19:03,911 --> 02:19:06,340
like you don't fight the existing 
system.

2967
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:06,891
You know,
you,

2968
02:19:06,891 --> 02:19:09,790
you create one that makes the existing 
system obsolete.

2969
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:11,500
Basically.
I don't know who made this quote,

2970
02:19:11,501 --> 02:19:13,240
but it's a wonderful one in this regard 
that,

2971
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:14,153
uh,
before diagnosing yourself with 

2972
02:19:15,521 --> 02:19:16,354
depression first,
make sure you're not surrounded by 

2973
02:19:17,711 --> 02:19:20,400
assholes.
Who's quote is,

2974
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:23,920
it's a great quote,
great quote.

2975
02:19:24,250 --> 02:19:25,300
It is.
You know,

2976
02:19:25,301 --> 02:19:27,740
and also you might have a shitty life.
You know,

2977
02:19:27,741 --> 02:19:28,070
you might

2978
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:30,250
be bummed out because you're working all
the time and a job,

2979
02:19:30,251 --> 02:19:31,084
it's uninspiring.
You might be bummed out because he got 

2980
02:19:32,241 --> 02:19:34,640
an abusive spouse.
You might be bummed out because you live

2981
02:19:34,641 --> 02:19:37,580
in a crime infested neighborhood.
You might be bummed out for,

2982
02:19:37,581 --> 02:19:39,860
you know,
you might have some environmental issues

2983
02:19:39,861 --> 02:19:43,010
that are causing health problems.
So a lot going on.

2984
02:19:43,130 --> 02:19:48,130
You might work in a job that gets you 
exposed to toxic fumes or chemicals or,

2985
02:19:49,110 --> 02:19:50,540
right.
A lot of variables.

2986
02:19:50,600 --> 02:19:55,600
We were in a medical system that blames 
your biology.

2987
02:19:56,810 --> 02:19:57,530
That's it.

2988
02:19:57,530 --> 02:19:59,540
Yeah.
Just blames your biology.

2989
02:19:59,541 --> 02:20:00,374
So if it says it's convenient and 
because it suits the paradigm that's in 

2990
02:20:03,111 --> 02:20:03,944
place,

2991
02:20:05,220 --> 02:20:06,090
that's exactly right.

2992
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:10,780
Is that what it should be?
A lot of people,

2993
02:20:11,150 --> 02:20:13,000
uh,
ascribe it to Freud.

2994
02:20:13,270 --> 02:20:15,100
Right.
But this a quote,

2995
02:20:15,101 --> 02:20:15,934
investigator.com,
he says that it actually should go to 

2996
02:20:18,341 --> 02:20:20,680
this twitter account,
a twitter account,

2997
02:20:21,070 --> 02:20:25,030
which twitter account,
Debbie hope should be credited with the,

2998
02:20:25,160 --> 02:20:26,920
it says Debbie wizard,
you,

2999
02:20:27,760 --> 02:20:29,110
whoever it was,
she nailed it.

3000
02:20:29,570 --> 02:20:33,520
Did she nail it and attributed to Freud?
That's a kind of a clever move.

3001
02:20:33,521 --> 02:20:36,490
I don't want the attention version.
Yeah,

3002
02:20:36,491 --> 02:20:39,280
really awesome and attributed to some 
dead dude who was a genius.

3003
02:20:39,370 --> 02:20:40,203
I found the site before they kind kinda 
like do the telephone game with quotes 

3004
02:20:42,881 --> 02:20:44,770
and sort of like this is what people are
saying.

3005
02:20:44,771 --> 02:20:45,604
And then they go through like this,
all the iterations of how it's been 

3006
02:20:47,831 --> 02:20:48,664
translated out.
Do you remember that one Greg Giraldo 

3007
02:20:50,951 --> 02:20:51,784
joke that got attributed to me online 
and people have photos of me with Greg 

3008
02:20:55,541 --> 02:20:57,760
draw those quote and something that I 
never said.

3009
02:20:57,840 --> 02:21:01,120
It's absolutely not mine.
I didn't know whose it was.

3010
02:21:01,121 --> 02:21:02,440
And then someone had to say,
that's great girl.

3011
02:21:02,470 --> 02:21:04,990
Geraldo's and then people say like,
why are you stealing greg?

3012
02:21:04,991 --> 02:21:07,540
Geraldo shut my making memes.
Like,

3013
02:21:07,541 --> 02:21:09,310
I'm not doing that.
Somebody else did that,

3014
02:21:09,370 --> 02:21:12,130
but I put it on twitter.
This is not mine.

3015
02:21:12,160 --> 02:21:14,830
I think I might've put it on instagram 
too long time ago,

3016
02:21:14,831 --> 02:21:16,750
but it was weird.
It was like I kept getting them.

3017
02:21:16,780 --> 02:21:20,050
Or you get them.
These memes come in waves.

3018
02:21:20,530 --> 02:21:23,620
You know,
I get ones that I did say I get those in

3019
02:21:23,621 --> 02:21:24,454
waves too.
I get these pictures of me with like 

3020
02:21:26,741 --> 02:21:29,590
weird quotes that I'd said names are 
very powerful.

3021
02:21:29,591 --> 02:21:30,424
Yeah.
Video is even more powerful though 

3022
02:21:31,691 --> 02:21:32,524
because I think people have come to this
conclusion that they can't trust 

3023
02:21:34,991 --> 02:21:36,580
anything anymore.
Names are funny.

3024
02:21:36,820 --> 02:21:40,240
That's one of the things that,
but like good solid shame.

3025
02:21:40,390 --> 02:21:41,223
That's one of the things that was so 
egregious about that fat Jewish guy and 

3026
02:21:43,710 --> 02:21:44,543
said he was stealing these brilliant 
ideas and it made him look brilliant 

3027
02:21:47,380 --> 02:21:48,213
when really he's just sort of this 
aggregator of other people's awesome 

3028
02:21:50,441 --> 02:21:55,030
ideas without giving them credit and he 
just got on this plagiarism loophole and

3029
02:21:55,031 --> 02:21:55,990
everybody's like,
what?

3030
02:21:56,500 --> 02:21:57,333
And now he's got this weird thing that 
he does where he says that he puts up 

3031
02:22:00,401 --> 02:22:01,234
the meme.
He writes his own quote and then just 

3032
02:22:03,581 --> 02:22:06,670
puts the originators name at the end of 
it.

3033
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:09,070
He doesn't even say originally created 
by,

3034
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:10,113
he just puts their name and that's like 
attribute and credit and some sort of a 

3035
02:22:13,541 --> 02:22:14,374
weird way.
It's super slimy like what's going on 

3036
02:22:17,921 --> 02:22:20,410
now with like,
and the problem is like some,

3037
02:22:20,411 --> 02:22:22,540
it'll send you something and I have real
issue with this.

3038
02:22:22,541 --> 02:22:26,010
Like someone sends me something that's 
hilarious and I want to it on instagram.

3039
02:22:26,030 --> 02:22:26,730
I'm like,
I don't know,

3040
02:22:26,730 --> 02:22:28,290
made it,
can I just put it up?

3041
02:22:28,590 --> 02:22:30,360
Like what do I do?
Do I say,

3042
02:22:30,361 --> 02:22:31,680
Hey,
I don't know who the fuck made this.

3043
02:22:31,830 --> 02:22:34,380
Let me know.
And then put it up and then people go,

3044
02:22:34,381 --> 02:22:35,760
oh,
just see what Joe Rogan said.

3045
02:22:35,761 --> 02:22:37,380
There's Hilariously,
I didn't say it.

3046
02:22:37,500 --> 02:22:38,333
It matters.
I'm big into attribution because it 

3047
02:22:39,691 --> 02:22:42,490
makes it like,
it's like I have company around me,

3048
02:22:42,500 --> 02:22:43,010
you know,
I,

3049
02:22:43,010 --> 02:22:45,600
it's also people turn into a business.
Yeah.

3050
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:49,810
Like the meme business is a business and
then they have sponsored posts,

3051
02:22:50,040 --> 02:22:55,020
sponsored instagram posts and sponsored 
tweets and they make a lot of money.

3052
02:22:55,021 --> 02:22:55,854
Like there's a lot of money to be made 
and people were getting these 

3053
02:22:57,271 --> 02:22:58,104
development deals to do television shows
and all sorts of other things based on 

3054
02:23:01,591 --> 02:23:04,410
the content of other people's ideas that
they're just aggregating.

3055
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:05,340
That's amazing.
Yeah.

3056
02:23:05,340 --> 02:23:08,700
Well it's just a weird loophole and it's
like if you were doing it with music,

3057
02:23:08,701 --> 02:23:09,534
like say if you just wanted to take 
rifts that you thought were really 

3058
02:23:12,031 --> 02:23:15,060
awesome and put them on your music page,
people will go,

3059
02:23:15,061 --> 02:23:16,380
well fuck you.
You can't do that.

3060
02:23:16,381 --> 02:23:18,090
This is my stuff.
I created this,

3061
02:23:18,450 --> 02:23:19,283
but we that signature,
unless you're putting watermarks on 

3062
02:23:21,361 --> 02:23:22,194
everything,
that signature is not necessarily 

3063
02:23:23,701 --> 02:23:25,100
available with mediums.
Right.

3064
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:27,330
Cause they're that powerful.
Yeah.

3065
02:23:27,690 --> 02:23:29,580
And if even if you do put a watermark,
you know what they do,

3066
02:23:29,790 --> 02:23:30,623
they just find the original photo,
put their own quote over it and just 

3067
02:23:33,691 --> 02:23:34,524
don't attribute anything to you because 
they don't want you to have the 

3068
02:23:36,481 --> 02:23:38,730
watermark on their page.
It's sneaky.

3069
02:23:39,480 --> 02:23:42,390
It's like some weird copyright loophole 
that exists now.

3070
02:23:43,270 --> 02:23:44,103
You know?
No one knows exactly what to do about 

3071
02:23:45,271 --> 02:23:46,104
it.
You need some ambulance chasing lawyers 

3072
02:23:47,341 --> 02:23:48,650
to,
that's right.

3073
02:23:48,690 --> 02:23:50,520
Yes.
Ambulance chambers chasers,

3074
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:51,593
so what blow back have you experienced 
other than this influx of trolls and 

3075
02:23:58,651 --> 02:24:01,860
people there is that for a whole year?
None.

3076
02:24:01,890 --> 02:24:02,723
Like I took out a large life insurance 
policy when I published my book 

3077
02:24:06,601 --> 02:24:10,200
expecting like pretty serious.
You could word you were going to die.

3078
02:24:11,130 --> 02:24:13,410
It's happened.
I have colleagues.

3079
02:24:13,560 --> 02:24:14,393
What do you,
what college did you have that have 

3080
02:24:15,901 --> 02:24:16,734
died?

3081
02:24:19,080 --> 02:24:19,291
My,
no,

3082
02:24:19,291 --> 02:24:20,124
leave that mystery hangar,
but it's you think people have been 

3083
02:24:23,041 --> 02:24:26,190
killed because they've criticized 
pharmaceutical companies.

3084
02:24:27,150 --> 02:24:27,983
You just have to know that it's the most
powerful industry in the public eye 

3085
02:24:32,341 --> 02:24:33,900
anyway.
That's intense though.

3086
02:24:33,901 --> 02:24:37,590
What you just said like you,
you have colleagues that you believe may

3087
02:24:37,591 --> 02:24:39,180
have been killing me.
You don't want to talk about it.

3088
02:24:39,181 --> 02:24:43,170
Obviously he'd clamp right up.
It's hard to shut me up.

3089
02:24:43,650 --> 02:24:45,720
It's hard to tell,
but you really believe that.

3090
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:50,010
You know what I mean?
Is was like focus on this layman,

3091
02:24:50,070 --> 02:24:51,640
but I do.
You're lying.

3092
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:54,750
It's powerful narrative habit that it's 
a possible narrative.

3093
02:24:54,790 --> 02:24:57,270
They might silence you.
And in the,

3094
02:24:57,271 --> 02:24:58,104
in the realm of independent journalism 
and media where some random Schmo like 

3095
02:25:03,721 --> 02:25:06,690
me can actually have influence,
especially,

3096
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:07,553
you know,
that I am credentialed in a way that 

3097
02:25:09,361 --> 02:25:10,194
people might pay attention to.
Right then why would they not want to 

3098
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:14,693
quiet me?

3099
02:25:14,850 --> 02:25:15,331
But,
well,

3100
02:25:15,331 --> 02:25:17,760
they put labels on cigarettes.
No one gives a shit.

3101
02:25:17,940 --> 02:25:19,230
Yeah.
You know,

3102
02:25:19,231 --> 02:25:23,010
I don't know if what you're saying is 
worth killing somebody over who,

3103
02:25:23,350 --> 02:25:24,131
I mean,
I'm still here,

3104
02:25:24,131 --> 02:25:25,270
so apparently not.
Right.

3105
02:25:25,540 --> 02:25:26,373
And what will know what I mean?
It means like all those whistle blowers 

3106
02:25:28,121 --> 02:25:29,650
when it came to his cigarettes and 
cancer,

3107
02:25:29,651 --> 02:25:30,484
those who gives a shit,
it's people there make more money from 

3108
02:25:32,231 --> 02:25:34,090
cigarettes now than ever.
Less people smoke.

3109
02:25:34,150 --> 02:25:36,910
So they just charge more for cigarettes 
and they make more than ever.

3110
02:25:36,970 --> 02:25:39,790
They make more now for cigarettes and 
they have in the last 15 years.

3111
02:25:40,590 --> 02:25:41,011
Yeah,
no,

3112
02:25:41,011 --> 02:25:41,771
I believe that.
And,

3113
02:25:41,771 --> 02:25:43,530
and,
and it's true that just because,

3114
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:45,750
but I,
right,

3115
02:25:45,751 --> 02:25:48,860
like I'm not just trying to scare people
out of taking meds and trying to help.

3116
02:25:48,890 --> 02:25:49,723
Also showing that you can totally shed 
your chronic illnesses completely 

3117
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:56,033
forever macho forever,
but that you can have longterm shedding 

3118
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:02,610
of your chronic ells is.
That to me is a more threatening element

3119
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:03,713
of what I have to say.
Then just like these pills are 

3120
02:26:05,281 --> 02:26:06,240
dangerous,
you shouldn't take them.

3121
02:26:06,241 --> 02:26:07,074
I'm not saying that,
I'm saying you might have been told 

3122
02:26:09,331 --> 02:26:11,460
you're broken,
that you have a mental illness for life,

3123
02:26:11,610 --> 02:26:12,930
but in fact,
you know,

3124
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:15,460
like I have a woman who completed,
um,

3125
02:26:15,570 --> 02:26:16,403
my online program had such bad migraine 
headaches that she had to be on Ivy 

3126
02:26:19,651 --> 02:26:20,484
Treatments.
She was treated by the top neurologist 

3127
02:26:21,571 --> 02:26:24,500
at emory.
She was on multiple pharmaceuticals.

3128
02:26:24,501 --> 02:26:26,550
She was bedbound for two years.

3129
02:26:26,550 --> 02:26:29,610
Okay.
And she completed my program,

3130
02:26:29,611 --> 02:26:31,320
which we talked about.
This is not rocket science.

3131
02:26:31,321 --> 02:26:33,750
Okay.
And she's totally symptom free.

3132
02:26:34,260 --> 02:26:35,093
Totally.
Yeah.

3133
02:26:35,160 --> 02:26:36,960
So that's pretty threatening,
right,

3134
02:26:36,961 --> 02:26:38,430
to,
to show you that in fact,

3135
02:26:38,580 --> 02:26:39,413
what you're told is a permanent problem 
you just have to deal with and live 

3136
02:26:42,601 --> 02:26:43,434
with,
with pharmaceutical medicine could be 

3137
02:26:44,671 --> 02:26:47,370
completely dissolved as a very 
threatening concept.

3138
02:26:47,371 --> 02:26:48,204
And I'm not the only one.
I mean many functional medicine doctors 

3139
02:26:50,341 --> 02:26:52,170
and holistic healers are,
are,

3140
02:26:52,340 --> 02:26:53,173
you know,
working to create awareness of this 

3141
02:26:54,721 --> 02:26:57,000
possibility.
But regardless,

3142
02:26:57,030 --> 02:26:59,010
it was pretty weird that,
you know,

3143
02:26:59,011 --> 02:26:59,844
the book made the New York Times list 
strangely and there wasn't a mention of 

3144
02:27:04,261 --> 02:27:07,980
it in mainstream media for a year.
Not once.

3145
02:27:08,110 --> 02:27:10,570
Like nobody wanted you to have to have 
you on their show.

3146
02:27:10,660 --> 02:27:13,210
This is amazing.
I'm not a negative review,

3147
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:15,560
like not a single mention in mainstream 
media.

3148
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:16,473
So the negative review is,
the problem with that is that you could 

3149
02:27:17,801 --> 02:27:21,490
refute the negative reviews and also 
cause tension attention on it.

3150
02:27:21,890 --> 02:27:24,280
Now let's see what her response is 
decided to ignore me,

3151
02:27:24,281 --> 02:27:26,350
which I was totally cool with because I 
had a very chill year.

3152
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:29,560
But it's,
I'm your life insurance policy.

3153
02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:30,750
Yeah,
exactly.

3154
02:27:30,770 --> 02:27:31,550
Just,

3155
02:27:31,550 --> 02:27:32,510
just waiting,
uh,

3156
02:27:32,610 --> 02:27:34,590
you know,
to get my couple million to my kids.

3157
02:27:34,591 --> 02:27:38,850
But it's changing.
Even in the past month or so,

3158
02:27:38,970 --> 02:27:39,803
there's been like a more of a targeted 
effort and a couple of allure and cosmo 

3159
02:27:44,971 --> 02:27:49,210
and couple of mainstream outlets have 
begun to um,

3160
02:27:49,260 --> 02:27:51,120
suggest that I am in,
you know,

3161
02:27:51,121 --> 02:27:54,480
a dangerous reckless person who shames 
women,

3162
02:27:54,840 --> 02:27:55,351
um,
who,

3163
02:27:55,351 --> 02:27:56,184
who take meds.

3164
02:27:56,410 --> 02:27:58,180
They've said this in articles.
Yeah,

3165
02:27:58,181 --> 02:27:59,014
I mean you can,
yeah.

3166
02:27:59,250 --> 02:28:01,530
Wow.
I don't want to give it the claims quick

3167
02:28:01,550 --> 02:28:02,383
energy,
but not funny that like if you give 

3168
02:28:03,601 --> 02:28:08,601
advice that is based on actual studies,
actual medicine,

3169
02:28:09,180 --> 02:28:10,890
give advice about,
you know,

3170
02:28:10,891 --> 02:28:11,221
like,
hey,

3171
02:28:11,221 --> 02:28:12,054
maybe it's not a good idea that you take
these crazy medications where we don't 

3172
02:28:14,371 --> 02:28:15,204
exactly know why you're taking them.
We don't know exactly if these are the 

3173
02:28:17,041 --> 02:28:19,740
right medications for you,
the testing them on you literally as you

3174
02:28:19,741 --> 02:28:21,980
go along that you're shaming.
I'm

3175
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:23,270
not even saying maybe it's not a good 
idea.

3176
02:28:23,420 --> 02:28:24,253
I'm just saying,
here's what the science says that you 

3177
02:28:25,401 --> 02:28:27,980
might not have been told and here's 
what's additionally possible.

3178
02:28:27,981 --> 02:28:29,570
You should just at least know,
okay,

3179
02:28:29,571 --> 02:28:31,280
and here's the social proof.
You know,

3180
02:28:31,281 --> 02:28:32,114
interviews,
I'm publishing for case reports as we 

3181
02:28:33,561 --> 02:28:35,930
speak in the peer reviewed index medical
literature.

3182
02:28:36,290 --> 02:28:37,123
You know,
so this is not like some random blog I 

3183
02:28:40,611 --> 02:28:41,444
wrote.
Okay.

3184
02:28:41,540 --> 02:28:44,120
So just know that that's possible and 
then make your decision.

3185
02:28:44,121 --> 02:28:44,954
And guess what,
if you're on meds and this sounds 

3186
02:28:46,820 --> 02:28:49,040
interesting to you,
then I'm showing you you,

3187
02:28:49,041 --> 02:28:51,910
there's a path to a new,
you know,

3188
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:53,600
approach that's,
you know,

3189
02:28:53,630 --> 02:28:57,500
that's it.
But actually it hits even given airwaves

3190
02:28:57,501 --> 02:29:00,980
cause it's just sort of ridiculous.
And I do believe a lot of initiated with

3191
02:29:00,981 --> 02:29:04,100
astroturfing,
but I'm being called an ablest.

3192
02:29:04,530 --> 02:29:06,830
Never heard that word.
I never heard that word before.

3193
02:29:06,840 --> 02:29:08,820
Hundred folds,
one of the new ones that kids are using.

3194
02:29:08,821 --> 02:29:11,100
All these little snowflakes.
Good to know of it.

3195
02:29:11,230 --> 02:29:11,940
So like,
uh,

3196
02:29:11,940 --> 02:29:15,370
so I'm shaming people who can't do what 
I'm able to do,

3197
02:29:15,371 --> 02:29:16,450
including have a home birth.

3198
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:21,340
But this has been around for a while to 
sort of,

3199
02:29:22,440 --> 02:29:26,120
I know you're a woman,
it's not as bad.

3200
02:29:26,660 --> 02:29:29,210
White woman privilege is not real it 
Israel.

3201
02:29:29,211 --> 02:29:30,680
No it's,
it certainly is.

3202
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:34,310
It certainly is.
But you guys have a struggle with that a

3203
02:29:34,311 --> 02:29:35,480
bit more.
Perhaps.

3204
02:29:35,980 --> 02:29:37,400
I'm a conqueror.
I'm a man.

3205
02:29:37,401 --> 02:29:40,130
Terrible person.
Done are things throughout history.

3206
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:42,710
Clearly all men are responsible for all 
the horrible stuff.

3207
02:29:43,910 --> 02:29:45,260
Yeah.
Able,

3208
02:29:45,290 --> 02:29:48,140
this is a wonderful term.
Do you ever use that Jamie?

3209
02:29:48,200 --> 02:29:49,180
No.
Call.

3210
02:29:49,190 --> 02:29:51,680
Anybody enabled us and actually done 
well in college.

3211
02:29:51,681 --> 02:29:52,514
They do and they do online.
I don't know where I've been that I 

3212
02:29:55,171 --> 02:29:57,830
never heard that term.
It's too easy to get by.

3213
02:29:57,990 --> 02:29:58,970
Sue.
Easy to eat.

3214
02:29:59,450 --> 02:30:01,910
It's too easy to survive is not enough 
difficulty out there.

3215
02:30:01,911 --> 02:30:06,440
People go looking for insults and 
looking for things that are off.

3216
02:30:06,590 --> 02:30:07,423
Yeah.
There there's a constant searching for 

3217
02:30:09,921 --> 02:30:10,754
outrage.

3218
02:30:10,970 --> 02:30:13,620
This quest for recreational outrage,
you know,

3219
02:30:13,621 --> 02:30:16,190
and,
and people find things to be appalled at

3220
02:30:16,191 --> 02:30:18,200
and then attack them and go nuts over 
it.

3221
02:30:18,201 --> 02:30:19,880
It's just,
it's a very strange time.

3222
02:30:20,270 --> 02:30:20,900
It's,
uh,

3223
02:30:20,900 --> 02:30:23,240
I think it's beautiful though.
I think it's all,

3224
02:30:23,241 --> 02:30:24,770
it's all really good.
Like we're,

3225
02:30:24,771 --> 02:30:28,160
we're coming to grips with how 
preposterous we are and we're,

3226
02:30:28,161 --> 02:30:32,150
we're doing so in the middle of these 
embroiled battles over ideologies,

3227
02:30:32,151 --> 02:30:34,580
over cultural expression.
I,

3228
02:30:34,581 --> 02:30:35,414
there's some girls in Portland that had 
taken a rash of shit because they're 

3229
02:30:38,661 --> 02:30:40,820
selling burritos and they're white.
They,

3230
02:30:40,860 --> 02:30:41,693
they made a burrito truck and people are
going crazy and trying to shut them 

3231
02:30:44,361 --> 02:30:45,194
down,
shut them down because they're not 

3232
02:30:47,210 --> 02:30:51,230
Mexican and they're selling burritos 
like they're not,

3233
02:30:51,640 --> 02:30:53,300
you know,
they're not pretending.

3234
02:30:53,301 --> 02:30:54,134
They're not like putting shoe Polish on 
and pretending and that put in brown 

3235
02:30:56,691 --> 02:30:57,524
face on there,
just fucking selling burritos like it's 

3236
02:31:00,291 --> 02:31:03,990
so crazy.
Its critics close.

3237
02:31:04,010 --> 02:31:07,010
White Women's Portland Burrito stand for
cultural theft.

3238
02:31:07,011 --> 02:31:09,860
What the fuck man?
Their burritos assholes.

3239
02:31:10,820 --> 02:31:13,070
Mexicans don't even eat burritos.
Yes they do.

3240
02:31:13,190 --> 02:31:15,740
Okay.
She's a Mexican expert.

3241
02:31:15,770 --> 02:31:19,770
Burrito's uh,
I've eaten Burrito's in Mexico food.

3242
02:31:20,490 --> 02:31:24,150
I have had a real chicken burrito in 
Mexico and was quite delicious.

3243
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:25,560
I love Mexico.
It's done a lot of it.

3244
02:31:25,610 --> 02:31:29,340
I just don't understand why anybody 
thinks that there's something wrong with

3245
02:31:29,341 --> 02:31:32,070
learning a style of cooking.
It's like,

3246
02:31:32,250 --> 02:31:34,350
I think if you have cultural 
appropriation,

3247
02:31:34,351 --> 02:31:35,184
if you have like a person who's 
pretending they're from Laos and they 

3248
02:31:38,791 --> 02:31:41,580
start talking with a fake accent and you
know,

3249
02:31:41,750 --> 02:31:42,780
and you go,
hey man,

3250
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:44,910
you're full fucking Cleveland.
You're not even,

3251
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:46,103
you're not even of Laos to scent.
Like you do a 23 and me on you and you 

3252
02:31:48,931 --> 02:31:50,730
find out like your family is from 
Finland.

3253
02:31:50,731 --> 02:31:52,360
Like the fuck is wrong with you.
Like,

3254
02:31:52,430 --> 02:31:54,930
but there are people that do that and 
that is crazy.

3255
02:31:54,960 --> 02:31:57,120
Right?
But that's just deceptive.

3256
02:31:57,390 --> 02:32:00,120
This is not deceptive.
Is it someone who likes making Burritos,

3257
02:32:00,121 --> 02:32:00,954
they're making burritos and then these 
goofy white kids are fucking closing 

3258
02:32:03,541 --> 02:32:04,374
them down.

3259
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:07,260
And that's what it is.
Cultural appropriation.

3260
02:32:07,261 --> 02:32:10,800
Heroes just shouting out from the 
rooftop that you're wrong,

3261
02:32:11,130 --> 02:32:12,570
you're wrong.
It's like you said,

3262
02:32:12,571 --> 02:32:14,610
we're just always looking for who to 
blame,

3263
02:32:14,611 --> 02:32:17,670
who to be mad at,
who to make sort of the,

3264
02:32:17,671 --> 02:32:21,420
the persecutor of our felt wrongness.
It's that same issue.

3265
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:22,520
It's so crazy.
Yeah.

3266
02:32:22,860 --> 02:32:23,693
No,
it is a weird,

3267
02:32:23,850 --> 02:32:26,100
it is a weird time.
And the trouble is,

3268
02:32:26,250 --> 02:32:27,083
you know that the more that we,
this infighting is like in some ways a 

3269
02:32:32,821 --> 02:32:33,654
distraction from the greater issues that
are sure government overreach and these 

3270
02:32:38,041 --> 02:32:38,874
greater issues that are allowed to 
unfold while we're busy calling each 

3271
02:32:40,981 --> 02:32:41,814
other names and you're doing it on 
twitter and the government's literally 

3272
02:32:43,951 --> 02:32:46,770
reading your emails while you're doing 
it and you're like,

3273
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:47,633
no,
but we have to worry about this burrito 

3274
02:32:48,241 --> 02:32:50,490
stand.
Do you think you're finding it salsa?

3275
02:32:50,910 --> 02:32:52,170
You can't have tortillas.

3276
02:32:52,470 --> 02:32:53,303
You're not from here.
Like what is wrong with people that 

3277
02:32:57,361 --> 02:32:59,070
never existed before?
Like whatever.

3278
02:32:59,250 --> 02:33:01,050
Here's the thing,
here's what's fascinating.

3279
02:33:01,170 --> 02:33:02,003
It only works if the people that you're 
supposedly culturally stealing from our 

3280
02:33:06,751 --> 02:33:07,584
brown.
Like if you tried cooking French food 

3281
02:33:10,411 --> 02:33:12,630
and you're not a French to send,
nobody gives a shit.

3282
02:33:13,020 --> 02:33:13,853
You could cook Italian food all day long
and no one cares about copd cultural 

3283
02:33:17,221 --> 02:33:18,054
appropriation.
Like you could be a white woman from 

3284
02:33:20,011 --> 02:33:20,844
Switzerland who lives in New Jersey and 
runs an Italian restaurant and no one 

3285
02:33:25,021 --> 02:33:26,700
cares.
They won't care.

3286
02:33:26,790 --> 02:33:27,623
Well,
arguably they haven't been like 

3287
02:33:28,291 --> 02:33:29,124
oppressed,
I guess in the same way where at one 

3288
02:33:31,141 --> 02:33:33,440
point in time we just got through it and
techniques.

3289
02:33:33,510 --> 02:33:35,070
It's Mexican,
but it mean for real.

3290
02:33:35,071 --> 02:33:35,904
I mean that's literally the path of 
boxing in America was it was Jewish 

3291
02:33:39,301 --> 02:33:40,590
people,
Italians,

3292
02:33:40,591 --> 02:33:42,480
Irish.
It was the suppressed people,

3293
02:33:42,481 --> 02:33:43,314
black folks.

3294
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:44,273
It was always the people that were the 
most economically suppressed that rose 

3295
02:33:48,181 --> 02:33:49,014
to.
And then they were also like my 

3296
02:33:49,801 --> 02:33:53,940
grandparents came from Italy and they 
experienced horrible racism back then,

3297
02:33:53,941 --> 02:33:58,140
back in the early 19 hundreds but by the
time they integrate into society,

3298
02:33:58,141 --> 02:34:02,550
like being Italian isn't even thought of
as being not white anymore.

3299
02:34:02,950 --> 02:34:06,000
Yeah.
But when my grandparents were kids,

3300
02:34:06,001 --> 02:34:07,980
it was like,
just like being Mexican,

3301
02:34:08,250 --> 02:34:09,083
I was the same kind of thing.
It was like you were treated like 

3302
02:34:10,890 --> 02:34:13,510
someone from somewhere else that they 
didn't want here,

3303
02:34:13,970 --> 02:34:14,803
you know,
they called them Guinea waps and all 

3304
02:34:15,931 --> 02:34:17,250
these crazy slangs

3305
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:20,140
horrible expressions that don't even 
mean anything anymore.

3306
02:34:20,170 --> 02:34:21,003
Right there.
It's so ineffective now and our hope is 

3307
02:34:22,721 --> 02:34:25,870
right that one day it's going to get 
like that with Mexicans the same way.

3308
02:34:25,871 --> 02:34:29,050
It's like you can't really mock someone 
from being from Holland.

3309
02:34:29,051 --> 02:34:30,400
No one gives a shit.
Like you can say,

3310
02:34:30,401 --> 02:34:31,450
Oh,
you're from Holland.

3311
02:34:31,451 --> 02:34:32,530
Like,
yeah,

3312
02:34:32,770 --> 02:34:34,900
like it's not about Quito though.
Like does that,

3313
02:34:35,220 --> 02:34:36,053
it doesn't matter.
They call it as themselves Guido's like 

3314
02:34:39,230 --> 02:34:40,660
family.
They call themselves Guido.

3315
02:34:40,870 --> 02:34:41,703
They'll call themselves guineas,
they'll call themselves and it's like 

3316
02:34:43,961 --> 02:34:47,410
almost like a term of endearment and 
it's power.

3317
02:34:47,411 --> 02:34:49,270
It's true.
It's totally lost its power because it's

3318
02:34:49,271 --> 02:34:52,480
culturally acceptable to be Italian.
And then one day,

3319
02:34:52,510 --> 02:34:53,343
I mean,
but the idea that these girls are 

3320
02:34:54,551 --> 02:34:56,920
stealing from Mexicans where it's so 
crazy.

3321
02:34:56,921 --> 02:34:58,030
Like,
Oh,

3322
02:34:58,650 --> 02:35:00,490
there's a salad burritos folks,
just food.

3323
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:02,200
It's just a certain way of preparing it.

3324
02:35:02,620 --> 02:35:03,453
You know?
It's not like they're pretending we 

3325
02:35:04,091 --> 02:35:06,700
event this and no one else did it.
It's a wrap.

3326
02:35:06,970 --> 02:35:09,760
Like the people who make wraps,
those should be slapped.

3327
02:35:09,761 --> 02:35:12,010
That's not how rap motherfucker,
that's a burrito.

3328
02:35:12,310 --> 02:35:14,860
You're making a Shitty Burrito and 
you're calling it a wrap.

3329
02:35:15,070 --> 02:35:16,340
Right?
Gluten free.

3330
02:35:16,360 --> 02:35:19,390
Those are the real problem.
Those are the problem people.

3331
02:35:19,391 --> 02:35:22,120
They're calling it wraps.
That's looks like a Tortilla.

3332
02:35:22,121 --> 02:35:22,561
No,
no,

3333
02:35:22,561 --> 02:35:25,310
no,
no rap.

3334
02:35:25,470 --> 02:35:26,710
What is,
what did they call,

3335
02:35:26,711 --> 02:35:29,590
did they call a rapid tour in?
They say it's a Tortilla.

3336
02:35:30,660 --> 02:35:32,530
What do they call that?
Outside of a rap,

3337
02:35:33,070 --> 02:35:34,540
right?
Like when you come up,

3338
02:35:34,550 --> 02:35:36,850
Dang.
Totally coopting right.

3339
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:37,713
That's the real theft is raps,
but it doesn't even taste like if those 

3340
02:35:40,091 --> 02:35:41,830
girls were just selling wraps,
everybody be like,

3341
02:35:41,831 --> 02:35:42,431
oh,
that's cool.

3342
02:35:42,431 --> 02:35:45,250
It's just a wrap.
They just mislabeled it.

3343
02:35:45,270 --> 02:35:47,530
As long as you don't have a Mexican flag
anywhere.

3344
02:35:47,630 --> 02:35:49,720
And he like a cartoon of a Chili Pepper.

3345
02:35:53,820 --> 02:35:54,480
It's just,
I,

3346
02:35:54,480 --> 02:35:56,610
I really feel like this goes,
I mean it's,

3347
02:35:56,611 --> 02:35:59,950
it's a stretch granted,
but I really feel like this goes back to

3348
02:35:59,951 --> 02:36:03,040
what we're talking about is that people 
need difficulty in their life.

3349
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:04,113
They really do.
And that way they don't seek out 

3350
02:36:05,720 --> 02:36:07,750
difficulty.
Yeah,

3351
02:36:07,751 --> 02:36:08,620
no,
it's true.

3352
02:36:08,650 --> 02:36:09,483
And I think that's one of the reasons 
why you're getting a lot of this from 

3353
02:36:11,450 --> 02:36:15,610
these college kids where their tuition 
is being paid for their,

3354
02:36:15,640 --> 02:36:16,510
you know,
they don't,

3355
02:36:16,540 --> 02:36:19,300
they don't have jobs.
They're not competing in the real world.

3356
02:36:19,420 --> 02:36:20,253
They're just operating on ideologies and
they're being taught by these 

3357
02:36:23,321 --> 02:36:24,154
knuckleheads that are just trying to 
keep their tenure and they're trying to 

3358
02:36:26,771 --> 02:36:27,604
spread the same sort of ideology that 
they had when they were in college and 

3359
02:36:30,431 --> 02:36:33,730
they never really entered into the 
workforce in a lot of examples.

3360
02:36:33,731 --> 02:36:37,210
A lot of these people went from academia
to teaching,

3361
02:36:37,270 --> 02:36:37,720
right?

3362
02:36:37,720 --> 02:36:38,860
I mean,
right in there,

3363
02:36:38,861 --> 02:36:41,380
just embedded into the system.
I don't really know,

3364
02:36:42,310 --> 02:36:45,040
hey Ho these racist teachers have got to
go,

3365
02:36:45,310 --> 02:36:47,050
right.
It's just people are going crazy today.

3366
02:36:47,260 --> 02:36:49,390
And I think a lot of it has to do at the
same thing.

3367
02:36:49,391 --> 02:36:52,300
I think it's this new found ability to 
communicate,

3368
02:36:52,301 --> 02:36:55,120
which is fantastic and it's going to 
have its hiccups and is going to be some

3369
02:36:55,121 --> 02:36:59,080
issues and he's going to be some,
some real coopting of the system,

3370
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:02,050
like what you're experiencing with 
trolls attacking an idea.

3371
02:37:02,380 --> 02:37:03,213
But overall those ideas are spreading in
a way that's unprecedented and 

3372
02:37:07,541 --> 02:37:08,374
impossible just a few decades ago.
Like your ideas spreading the way they 

3373
02:37:12,341 --> 02:37:15,070
have where I hear about them and now you
know,

3374
02:37:15,080 --> 02:37:16,040
you and I sit down and

3375
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:16,873
talk about this.
Millions of people are going to hear 

3376
02:37:17,871 --> 02:37:21,380
this conversation and this and this is 
unprecedented.

3377
02:37:21,410 --> 02:37:23,360
Like this has never been available 
before.

3378
02:37:23,660 --> 02:37:24,493
So all the bad stuff,
you've got to take it with all the good 

3379
02:37:26,421 --> 02:37:30,470
stuff and it's dark 100% yeah.
I like what you expressing,

3380
02:37:30,471 --> 02:37:34,220
what you're trying to get out to people.
This is all this,

3381
02:37:34,250 --> 02:37:37,400
all new stuff.
Like no one was saying this 20 years ago

3382
02:37:38,090 --> 02:37:41,000
because we were all asleep.
He's matrix talk.

3383
02:37:41,001 --> 02:37:43,070
This is more hippy talk that you would 
hate 20 years ago.

3384
02:37:43,650 --> 02:37:44,720
He'd be like,
Oh my God,

3385
02:37:44,721 --> 02:37:46,690
I'm so crazy when I'm older.
But that's why it's,

3386
02:37:46,830 --> 02:37:50,900
it is a cool time because it sorta like 
the democratization of information where

3387
02:37:50,901 --> 02:37:55,250
if if you want to learn about other 
perspectives on anything,

3388
02:37:55,670 --> 02:37:57,050
you look it up,
you know,

3389
02:37:57,051 --> 02:37:57,884
and then you make your own decision.
So it is a time where you have the 

3390
02:38:00,890 --> 02:38:05,510
potential to be an individual in ways 
that were not honored in,

3391
02:38:05,511 --> 02:38:07,220
in more conformist,
you know,

3392
02:38:07,221 --> 02:38:09,080
controlled media environment.

3393
02:38:09,110 --> 02:38:09,943
I mean,
the trouble is that many people are 

3394
02:38:10,701 --> 02:38:12,200
still,
you know,

3395
02:38:13,010 --> 02:38:16,650
still believe that mainstream media is 
telling them the truth,

3396
02:38:16,651 --> 02:38:17,031
that,
that,

3397
02:38:17,031 --> 02:38:19,440
that deconditioning is very challenging.
Um,

3398
02:38:19,860 --> 02:38:21,650
but yeah,
that's a real problem.

3399
02:38:21,651 --> 02:38:24,500
I mean,
I think even though like the trump stuff

3400
02:38:24,501 --> 02:38:27,200
with all this fake news talk is so 
detrimental,

3401
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:30,530
ultimately it is like you're getting 
people,

3402
02:38:30,531 --> 02:38:31,364
even if they realize this guy's a 
knucklehead and he's wrong about a lot 

3403
02:38:33,471 --> 02:38:34,304
of stuff,
they're gonna,

3404
02:38:34,440 --> 02:38:35,273
they're at least challenging these ideas
that these networks are only giving you 

3405
02:38:39,771 --> 02:38:40,970
the news.
I mean,

3406
02:38:41,180 --> 02:38:45,800
Fox News is a Goddamn sexual assault 
paradise over there.

3407
02:38:45,801 --> 02:38:46,370
I mean,
these,

3408
02:38:46,370 --> 02:38:49,940
these guys just keep getting kicked out 
of Fox News over and over again.

3409
02:38:49,970 --> 02:38:50,803
There's all these sexual harassment 
allegations and people are resigning 

3410
02:38:54,201 --> 02:38:55,190
left and right.
Right.

3411
02:38:55,340 --> 02:38:57,200
Well because of all that stuff,
it makes you go,

3412
02:38:57,230 --> 02:38:58,730
oh,
oh,

3413
02:38:58,731 --> 02:38:59,780
these guys are creeps.

3414
02:38:59,810 --> 02:39:00,643
Like there's a lot of creeps even there,
like when Brian Williams got busted 

3415
02:39:03,291 --> 02:39:04,124
lying and you're like,
oh that news guys just like another 

3416
02:39:06,561 --> 02:39:08,630
asshole.
They just make shit up.

3417
02:39:08,830 --> 02:39:09,663
Like just because he's saying the real 
news sometimes doesn't mean everything 

3418
02:39:13,431 --> 02:39:16,370
he says is true and there's no way to 
filter it.

3419
02:39:16,560 --> 02:39:17,393
So everybody has to question things now 
in a way that you never questioned 

3420
02:39:20,091 --> 02:39:20,924
during the Walter cronkite era.
You know when people were giving the 

3421
02:39:23,151 --> 02:39:25,400
news back when Ted Koppel was on the 
air,

3422
02:39:25,720 --> 02:39:27,890
you weren't quite like Ted Koppel full 
of Shit.

3423
02:39:28,040 --> 02:39:29,870
Like no one was saying that,
you know?

3424
02:39:30,860 --> 02:39:31,693
Right.
But Brian Williams is clearly full of 

3425
02:39:33,771 --> 02:39:34,604
shit at.
That's why it's weirder now to follow 

3426
02:39:36,681 --> 02:39:40,070
mainstream media because if you're not 
saying that like,

3427
02:39:40,120 --> 02:39:40,953
how are you,
how do you have so much allegiance to 

3428
02:39:44,001 --> 02:39:45,980
the machine that you would never 
question it?

3429
02:39:46,040 --> 02:39:47,780
Like,
to me that's surprising.

3430
02:39:48,070 --> 02:39:48,903
Also,
that machine is the only vehicle for 

3431
02:39:50,841 --> 02:39:51,674
these pharmaceutical companies.
They have to sandwich those commercials 

3432
02:39:54,231 --> 02:39:55,430
in between,
you know,

3433
02:39:56,210 --> 02:39:57,043
whatever show you're watching,
that's know three 60 whatever the fuck 

3434
02:39:59,451 --> 02:40:00,284
it is.
This guy's every 10 minutes and they 

3435
02:40:02,601 --> 02:40:04,100
just sandwich.
I'm in there,

3436
02:40:04,250 --> 02:40:05,083
whereas you're not going to see those 
commercials like no one's going to read 

3437
02:40:08,421 --> 02:40:12,350
those drug ads on a podcast.
You're not going to say,

3438
02:40:12,380 --> 02:40:13,500
okay,
well hey,

3439
02:40:13,560 --> 02:40:17,600
been really nice talking to you and I 
want to talk to you folks about abilify.

3440
02:40:17,790 --> 02:40:22,790
Are you right now thinking about being 
suicidal and really want to cement those

3441
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:27,820
thoughts and solidify them tea and make 
actions or enough money?

3442
02:40:28,880 --> 02:40:29,713
That's right.
I shouldn't say it cause I don't even 

3443
02:40:30,511 --> 02:40:33,180
know what I'm talking about.
You should be talking about this,

3444
02:40:33,181 --> 02:40:34,860
not me,
but here I am.

3445
02:40:35,820 --> 02:40:39,180
What does this abilify drug blame for?
Compulsive gambling,

3446
02:40:39,210 --> 02:40:40,590
eating shopping,
sex.

3447
02:40:40,620 --> 02:40:41,970
That's just life,
Bro.

3448
02:40:42,690 --> 02:40:44,940
How can you get blamed?
The abilify?

3449
02:40:45,060 --> 02:40:48,780
Here's one you can cause of this 
impulsivity thing I'm telling you.

3450
02:40:49,650 --> 02:40:51,210
Yeah,
whoa.

3451
02:40:51,510 --> 02:40:52,343
Nearby a gambling habit costs are 
between 1 million and 2 million in less 

3452
02:40:56,791 --> 02:40:59,190
than five years.
You just suck it gambling lady,

3453
02:40:59,370 --> 02:41:00,203
stop blaming drugs.
The woman had been living in Las Vegas 

3454
02:41:02,501 --> 02:41:06,750
since 1999 but she had never been to 
town the gamble until she started taking

3455
02:41:06,751 --> 02:41:08,640
the drugs.
Get the fuck out of here.

3456
02:41:08,790 --> 02:41:12,660
That lady got a good lawyer,
she got a good lawyer and she's crazy.

3457
02:41:12,680 --> 02:41:16,810
They got 200 people in this lawsuit that
had off claimed that gambling has to get

3458
02:41:16,811 --> 02:41:17,280
in on it.

3459
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:19,380
I want to take abilify so we can get 
some of that cash.

3460
02:41:19,700 --> 02:41:20,533
There was a drug called re-equip and 
there was a man in Ireland that took 

3461
02:41:26,761 --> 02:41:27,594
this drug and said before the drug he 
was a healthy heterosexual and after he 

3462
02:41:31,771 --> 02:41:32,604
took the drug,
he became gay and a gambling addict and 

3463
02:41:35,491 --> 02:41:36,324
he would engage in risky sex and he 
would meet men and chat rooms and have 

3464
02:41:39,391 --> 02:41:40,224
unprotected sex with them.
And then he got off the drug and was 

3465
02:41:42,241 --> 02:41:43,250
like,
what did I do?

3466
02:41:43,490 --> 02:41:44,323
And he won the equivalent of us 
somewhere in the neighborhood of 

3467
02:41:48,391 --> 02:41:51,820
$600,000
from Glaxo Klein Smith.

3468
02:41:52,380 --> 02:41:53,280
Yeah.
Here it is,

3469
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:54,233
man.
Says Parkinson's drug made him addicted 

3470
02:41:55,621 --> 02:41:56,454
to gambling and gay sex.
What is that from 2000 what was it say 

3471
02:41:58,771 --> 02:42:00,510
up there?
Yeah,

3472
02:42:01,030 --> 02:42:02,760
it was my memory.
That's what I remember.

3473
02:42:02,761 --> 02:42:06,030
I remember things that can turn me into 
a gay sex and gambling junkie.

3474
02:42:06,400 --> 02:42:07,233
Like,
hey,

3475
02:42:07,500 --> 02:42:12,500
hey,
what else works good on Parkinson's pot?

3476
02:42:13,160 --> 02:42:15,600
Yeah.
Pot and pot doesn't do that.

3477
02:42:16,410 --> 02:42:17,640
Okay.
It's crazy.

3478
02:42:17,641 --> 02:42:18,474
This guy sued the shit out of him and 
one that's what's crazy because I 

3479
02:42:22,321 --> 02:42:23,154
believe it.
Well it's crazy is it's one dude hopes 

3480
02:42:24,811 --> 02:42:27,540
for new trucks.
I love all the sandwich that now as many

3481
02:42:27,541 --> 02:42:28,374
as 1 million people in the United States
have Parkinson's and there's some new 

3482
02:42:30,571 --> 02:42:33,030
stuff that doesn't turn aside.
Oh for sure.

3483
02:42:33,270 --> 02:42:34,103
Yeah.
I like how when you scroll down the 

3484
02:42:35,401 --> 02:42:39,060
video keeps playing anyway.
Like they put a little video,

3485
02:42:39,061 --> 02:42:42,360
like you can't escape the video.
It's always sitting in the corner.

3486
02:42:42,361 --> 02:42:44,100
Like go ahead and press play.
Don't be timid.

3487
02:42:44,130 --> 02:42:44,963
Did Heaven doing this on the bottom?
Like where usually you'll see another 

3488
02:42:48,271 --> 02:42:51,000
story or similar stories.
A sponsored story.

3489
02:42:51,001 --> 02:42:54,300
I can't even tell it.
Sponsored usually or you can't Ken

3490
02:42:54,310 --> 02:42:55,143
now on CNN,
they have a ton of those on a lot of 

3491
02:42:57,281 --> 02:42:58,570
websites.
They have a ton of those.

3492
02:42:58,810 --> 02:43:00,040
Yeah,
it's pretty fascinating.

3493
02:43:00,041 --> 02:43:00,874
And it's like,
you know,

3494
02:43:00,900 --> 02:43:02,950
you won't believe what they look like 
now and you're like,

3495
02:43:02,951 --> 02:43:03,940
God,
what do they look like now?

3496
02:43:04,150 --> 02:43:04,983
And then you have to go to like fucking 
20 pages of what other people that look 

3497
02:43:08,621 --> 02:43:11,140
like shit.
Now to get to this one person,

3498
02:43:11,590 --> 02:43:12,070
you might not

3499
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:13,690
even,
they might even beyond that,

3500
02:43:13,750 --> 02:43:14,583
you know,
lemme just totally wasted 10 minutes of 

3501
02:43:16,721 --> 02:43:17,770
your life.
You never get back.

3502
02:43:18,100 --> 02:43:18,551
Yeah.
I mean,

3503
02:43:18,551 --> 02:43:22,360
on medscape and these like seemingly 
official medical websites,

3504
02:43:22,361 --> 02:43:25,660
there are Pharma ads that are,
uh,

3505
02:43:25,670 --> 02:43:30,670
appear to be diagnostic quizzes.
Do you have depression?

3506
02:43:31,420 --> 02:43:33,500
And then you go take the quiz.
And this is,

3507
02:43:33,550 --> 02:43:34,690
this is known,
you know,

3508
02:43:34,691 --> 02:43:35,524
has been exposed.
100% of people are identified pretty 

3509
02:43:38,381 --> 02:43:39,214
much no matter what you click,
you're identified as being a candidate 

3510
02:43:41,411 --> 02:43:43,150
for president.
It's not like,

3511
02:43:43,151 --> 02:43:44,070
dude,
you're fine.

3512
02:43:45,220 --> 02:43:48,910
Go play Frisbee and this objective 
assessment and you're doing great.

3513
02:43:48,911 --> 02:43:50,070
You're doing great.
Yeah.

3514
02:43:50,260 --> 02:43:51,093
Oh my God,
I'm so glad that I don't have to sell 

3515
02:43:51,941 --> 02:43:52,870
you drugs.
Right.

3516
02:43:55,150 --> 02:43:55,983
So what,
what do you hope to really get into 

3517
02:44:01,031 --> 02:44:01,864
people's heads with this book and with 
all this information and what you've 

3518
02:44:05,261 --> 02:44:08,650
gone on in your journey,
if you had to like sum it up?

3519
02:44:11,230 --> 02:44:14,320
Well,
it's sort of like when you know better,

3520
02:44:14,321 --> 02:44:16,270
you do better.
It's like a Maya angelou quote.

3521
02:44:16,271 --> 02:44:18,400
It's like one of my favorite quotes.
That's a great quote.

3522
02:44:18,460 --> 02:44:22,150
It is because there's no shaming in that
is as good as the fake freud quote.

3523
02:44:23,270 --> 02:44:24,430
When you know better,
you do better.

3524
02:44:24,431 --> 02:44:28,050
It's really good when Fred said the word
asshole and it um,

3525
02:44:28,570 --> 02:44:32,320
so,
so with this information,

3526
02:44:33,100 --> 02:44:37,240
is there something in you that's like 
excited about it or that says like,

3527
02:44:37,360 --> 02:44:37,901
hmm,
yeah,

3528
02:44:37,901 --> 02:44:40,660
there's something to that.
Because if there is,

3529
02:44:40,690 --> 02:44:43,180
then you should know what's possible,
right?

3530
02:44:43,181 --> 02:44:44,014
Because if you know it's possible,
then you will naturally move towards 

3531
02:44:46,451 --> 02:44:49,360
that.
And the transformations that I have seen

3532
02:44:49,361 --> 02:44:50,194
and continue to see,
I mean like I could cry thinking about 

3533
02:44:51,851 --> 02:44:52,684
it,
it's so deeply inspirational because 

3534
02:44:54,701 --> 02:44:57,790
it's a kind of human experience that is 
so redemptive.

3535
02:44:57,790 --> 02:44:58,623
It's like a real reclamation that is not
possible through the pharmaceutical 

3536
02:45:01,901 --> 02:45:02,734
model in my opinion.
I want to tell you a quick story about 

3537
02:45:04,691 --> 02:45:07,060
antibiotics cause you brought this up 
earlier.

3538
02:45:07,510 --> 02:45:09,010
So I went to India recently,
right?

3539
02:45:10,060 --> 02:45:14,860
And I bought some antibiotics when you 
got back and we never take,

3540
02:45:14,890 --> 02:45:16,180
I would never,
I don't take any farms.

3541
02:45:16,570 --> 02:45:19,960
You don't take antibiotics ever.
What if you've got an infection?

3542
02:45:19,961 --> 02:45:20,794
Like what?
If you've got staff then I'll tell you 

3543
02:45:21,461 --> 02:45:22,960
exactly what would happen,
right?

3544
02:45:22,990 --> 02:45:25,630
So I went to India,
I brought my little kit with me.

3545
02:45:25,631 --> 02:45:27,280
Right.
Knowing that there's like,

3546
02:45:27,540 --> 02:45:28,373
and honestly like I,
I don't believe in germ theory in the 

3547
02:45:31,601 --> 02:45:34,540
classical sense.
So I know and neither should anyone.

3548
02:45:34,541 --> 02:45:37,330
Germ theory is like if you're exposed to
a bad bug,

3549
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:39,220
then you get sick,
right?

3550
02:45:39,221 --> 02:45:41,590
Exposure equals infection.
Right?

3551
02:45:41,980 --> 02:45:45,580
But you know,
pester himself on his deathbed said that

3552
02:45:45,581 --> 02:45:47,690
it was the terrain,
not the bug.

3553
02:45:47,690 --> 02:45:50,380
So what's the terrain?
The terrain is the context.

3554
02:45:50,381 --> 02:45:54,420
The terrain is your body in your 
lifestyle and you know,

3555
02:45:54,421 --> 02:45:58,300
in your existence.
So that seems to be more relevant.

3556
02:45:58,301 --> 02:46:00,400
And then the discovery of the 
microbiome,

3557
02:46:00,401 --> 02:46:01,234
like this inner ecology has totally,
we got to go back to the drawing board 

3558
02:46:04,150 --> 02:46:07,440
completely in medicine because we didn't
know that before.

3559
02:46:07,441 --> 02:46:09,070
We soon as the discovery of the 
microbiome.

3560
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:12,170
It's about like 20 years,
20 years and 20 years.

3561
02:46:12,171 --> 02:46:16,400
We've the science of probiotics and,
and,

3562
02:46:16,410 --> 02:46:20,170
and understanding the importance of 
consuming fermented foods and,

3563
02:46:20,990 --> 02:46:21,823
and you know,
super infections through antibiotic 

3564
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:24,433
overuse and the fact that you can't ever
get out from under this idea of just 

3565
02:46:27,471 --> 02:46:30,290
killing the bad bugs.
It doesn't work.

3566
02:46:30,291 --> 02:46:31,124
And so the more you sanitize and you use
bleach and alcohol and prl and all that 

3567
02:46:34,221 --> 02:46:35,054
stuff,
you're actually distorting things and 

3568
02:46:36,681 --> 02:46:37,514
you're making it more likely for people 
to develop what are called nosocomial 

3569
02:46:41,181 --> 02:46:44,360
illnesses or infections,
which is hospital induced infections,

3570
02:46:44,361 --> 02:46:44,600
right?

3571
02:46:44,600 --> 02:46:45,433
This is the hospital as a sick 
environment in part because we have a 

3572
02:46:47,301 --> 02:46:51,740
wrong idea about how biological 
ecosystems work.

3573
02:46:51,770 --> 02:46:54,530
There's no bad guys.
Everything works together.

3574
02:46:54,531 --> 02:46:56,150
It's like a metaphor for life.
In fact,

3575
02:46:56,151 --> 02:46:58,040
there aren't really any bad guys.
It's all,

3576
02:46:58,460 --> 02:46:59,293
you know,
is sort of part of the polarity of life 

3577
02:47:01,910 --> 02:47:03,860
we need,
we need bad to know where good,

3578
02:47:03,861 --> 02:47:06,860
like it's that ancient philosophy.
So anyway,

3579
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:10,910
so we go to India and I bring bentonite 
clay,

3580
02:47:10,911 --> 02:47:13,970
I bring colloidal silver.
I bring a bunch of little silver.

3581
02:47:14,060 --> 02:47:17,150
Do you know that as a real,
that's the stuff that you like.

3582
02:47:17,151 --> 02:47:19,430
Do you use like a little electrodes,
you know,

3583
02:47:19,440 --> 02:47:21,060
stick the,
the water,

3584
02:47:21,090 --> 02:47:21,923
the stick to that or you just rely on 
people to make that forward in a 

3585
02:47:25,041 --> 02:47:27,710
responsible way then that turned some 
dude glue?

3586
02:47:27,711 --> 02:47:28,544
Yeah.
Yeah.

3587
02:47:28,750 --> 02:47:32,120
Again,
it can do that if you ask the wrong,

3588
02:47:32,570 --> 02:47:36,040
if you're using large particles,
like an Avatar lady,

3589
02:47:36,050 --> 02:47:37,020
you're having a good work.

3590
02:47:37,090 --> 02:47:37,923
But anyway,
I think it would undermine my 

3591
02:47:38,601 --> 02:47:40,480
credibility.
I don't know freaky.

3592
02:47:40,930 --> 02:47:44,890
I'm super healthy but I'm blue is fuck 
that poor guy.

3593
02:47:44,891 --> 02:47:46,170
He does.
Oh my gosh,

3594
02:47:47,010 --> 02:47:49,310
that's a reversible apparently.
Yeah.

3595
02:47:49,311 --> 02:47:50,144
That's not what we're going for.
That's why as a diy it may not be the 

3596
02:47:53,631 --> 02:47:56,390
best idea.
So does colonial silver,

3597
02:47:56,391 --> 02:47:58,090
what's the benefits of cool?
So,

3598
02:47:58,130 --> 02:47:58,963
okay,
so like herbal [inaudible] like 

3599
02:48:00,380 --> 02:48:02,300
botanical,
you know,

3600
02:48:02,301 --> 02:48:05,390
sort of like antimicrobials if you want 
to call them that.

3601
02:48:06,410 --> 02:48:07,243
They don't kill stuff there.
I think they have like a rebalancing 

3602
02:48:10,851 --> 02:48:11,750
effect,
but there,

3603
02:48:11,930 --> 02:48:13,820
you know for like,
you know,

3604
02:48:13,821 --> 02:48:14,654
CBO,
which is small intestinal bacterial 

3605
02:48:15,531 --> 02:48:16,364
overgrowth.
It's like a thing people are struggling 

3606
02:48:18,051 --> 02:48:20,090
with that a lot of functional medicine 
doctors treat.

3607
02:48:20,350 --> 02:48:21,183
There is randomized trial looking at 
antibiotics versus herbal botanicals 

3608
02:48:24,650 --> 02:48:26,720
showing herbal botanicals are as 
effective.

3609
02:48:26,960 --> 02:48:29,870
So why would you ever bother with the 
risks of antibiotics,

3610
02:48:29,871 --> 02:48:31,040
which are legion?

3611
02:48:31,040 --> 02:48:34,630
I mean they're massive risks.
Botanicals are specifically,

3612
02:48:35,030 --> 02:48:37,250
especially things like oil of Oregano 
for example.

3613
02:48:37,251 --> 02:48:39,680
It's like one of the better studied 
ones,

3614
02:48:39,681 --> 02:48:41,430
you know,
grapefruit seed extract there,

3615
02:48:41,930 --> 02:48:44,240
Pau d'arco,
there's a whole number of them.

3616
02:48:44,241 --> 02:48:48,980
Golden Seal like in Asia that have these
properties and a lot of supplements just

3617
02:48:48,981 --> 02:48:51,200
sort of put them all together.
Right.

3618
02:48:51,290 --> 02:48:53,330
Okay.
So I'm making this story too long.

3619
02:48:53,331 --> 02:48:55,070
So I go to India,
I bring all this stuff right.

3620
02:48:55,310 --> 02:48:56,143
And one of the women,
it's like a Kundalini trip and one of 

3621
02:48:57,801 --> 02:48:58,634
the women gets really sick like Cru,
like projectile vomiting and like 

3622
02:49:02,991 --> 02:49:05,330
screaming in pain.
Like bad scene.

3623
02:49:05,690 --> 02:49:07,890
I left right before you got the 
screaming in pain.

3624
02:49:08,080 --> 02:49:10,100
I'm sorry,
I thought she was just puking.

3625
02:49:10,530 --> 02:49:11,660
I know it was,
it was,

3626
02:49:11,661 --> 02:49:12,950
she was super sick.
Right.

3627
02:49:12,951 --> 02:49:16,520
And even the Indian dude who was sorta 
like our chaperone in a way,

3628
02:49:16,521 --> 02:49:19,310
like a friend of the woman who led the 
led the trip was like,

3629
02:49:19,311 --> 02:49:20,144
oh,
we got to bring her to the hospital 

3630
02:49:21,261 --> 02:49:21,770
hospital.

3631
02:49:21,770 --> 02:49:22,670
And you're like,
no,

3632
02:49:22,671 --> 02:49:23,840
I've got to give her clue silver.

3633
02:49:23,910 --> 02:49:25,650
And I was like,
gimme 12 hours,

3634
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:26,940
just really cute.
I looked him in the eyes,

3635
02:49:26,941 --> 02:49:27,774
it's like gave me 12 hours and I know 
her well enough to know that she would 

3636
02:49:32,431 --> 02:49:34,890
be down for this approach.
Okay.

3637
02:49:35,250 --> 02:49:37,500
So,
and she was not afraid,

3638
02:49:37,770 --> 02:49:39,690
important detail.
She's not afraid.

3639
02:49:39,840 --> 02:49:40,673
She was super uncomfortable,
but she wasn't like freaking out and 

3640
02:49:42,781 --> 02:49:43,261
like,
oh my God,

3641
02:49:43,261 --> 02:49:44,490
we're gonna die.
Okay.

3642
02:49:44,520 --> 02:49:46,980
She just thought she was sick,
which is true.

3643
02:49:47,310 --> 02:49:51,660
Right.
So in 12 hours she was completely,

3644
02:49:51,661 --> 02:49:53,520
well,
we were in the car for a two hour trip,

3645
02:49:53,521 --> 02:49:56,010
going to like another part of northern 
India.

3646
02:49:56,190 --> 02:50:00,630
And how did you cure or treat her?
She may very well have done it herself.

3647
02:50:00,631 --> 02:50:01,464
And,
and the ritual of these supplements and 

3648
02:50:02,791 --> 02:50:05,430
Bentonite Clay and whatever could have 
just been an accessory.

3649
02:50:05,431 --> 02:50:06,360
Who,
who knows.

3650
02:50:06,361 --> 02:50:09,210
The truth is that if she had taken 
antibiotics,

3651
02:50:09,211 --> 02:50:12,780
which she never did,
if she had taken them reflexively,

3652
02:50:13,140 --> 02:50:14,910
she probably would have been sick 
longer.

3653
02:50:15,420 --> 02:50:17,190
And she then ultimately when she got 
better,

3654
02:50:17,191 --> 02:50:19,680
what have attributed to,
to the end of antibiotics.

3655
02:50:19,681 --> 02:50:19,970
Right,
right,

3656
02:50:19,970 --> 02:50:20,803
right.
So she never would have had the 

3657
02:50:21,601 --> 02:50:24,090
opportunity to just see what her body's 
capable of.

3658
02:50:24,750 --> 02:50:25,583
So we make these assumptions about 
pharmaceuticals in the absence of any 

3659
02:50:29,251 --> 02:50:30,084
baseline evidence,
information or even experience to help 

3660
02:50:33,631 --> 02:50:35,640
us understand what our bodies are 
capable of.

3661
02:50:35,730 --> 02:50:39,720
But what if someone catches one of these
antibiotic resistant,

3662
02:50:39,750 --> 02:50:41,010
very aggressive

3663
02:50:41,510 --> 02:50:45,710
strains like Marissa.
I mean,

3664
02:50:45,800 --> 02:50:46,820
you know,
so,

3665
02:50:46,940 --> 02:50:50,120
so my partner has a website called green
med info comm,

3666
02:50:50,121 --> 02:50:51,020
right?
What is it called?

3667
02:50:51,050 --> 02:50:53,900
Green Med info.green
Med info.com

3668
02:50:53,920 --> 02:50:57,770
and he catalogs all of the data from Pub
med.gov

3669
02:50:58,070 --> 02:51:02,390
on these natural substances evidence 
that shows that something like garlic,

3670
02:51:02,930 --> 02:51:03,763
you know,
cause there's a study he put up on on 

3671
02:51:05,230 --> 02:51:09,860
and I think it was like garlic and maybe
honey or something you would laugh at,

3672
02:51:09,861 --> 02:51:10,170
right?

3673
02:51:10,170 --> 02:51:12,000
Doctor,
Rhonda Patrick went through this and she

3674
02:51:12,001 --> 02:51:13,610
talked about on the podcast,
she had a,

3675
02:51:13,630 --> 02:51:17,700
an persistent staph infection that would
not go away and treat.

3676
02:51:17,701 --> 02:51:20,600
She treated it with garlic and um,
uh,

3677
02:51:20,620 --> 02:51:23,910
in a topical form and it cured it when 
nothing else would.

3678
02:51:23,911 --> 02:51:24,744
And she had gone through this host of 
antibiotics that really wrecked her gut 

3679
02:51:28,021 --> 02:51:31,260
biome and she was really fucked up for 
like a year because of it.

3680
02:51:31,500 --> 02:51:34,350
And she treated with a topical 
application of garlic,

3681
02:51:34,590 --> 02:51:35,430
which is crazy.

3682
02:51:35,550 --> 02:51:38,520
And it sounds crazy until you actually 
learned that there's,

3683
02:51:38,550 --> 02:51:41,160
you wouldn't know that there's actually 
science to support that.

3684
02:51:41,580 --> 02:51:44,430
So there's a ton of science to support 
natural medicine.

3685
02:51:44,431 --> 02:51:45,264
I don't know who funds these studies.
It's crazy that they're even done 

3686
02:51:47,161 --> 02:51:49,740
because there certainly isn't Pharma 
money behind them,

3687
02:51:49,950 --> 02:51:51,990
but they are done.
And if you know about them,

3688
02:51:51,991 --> 02:51:54,240
it might help you to make an informed 
decision.

3689
02:51:54,690 --> 02:51:57,300
But this is reflexive assumption that 
well,

3690
02:51:57,301 --> 02:51:58,134
pharmaceutical medicine is the only 
legit choice if it gets bad enough is 

3691
02:52:01,711 --> 02:52:03,480
conditioning.
That's all I'm saying.

3692
02:52:03,481 --> 02:52:06,010
It's a,
it's a conditioned assumption.

3693
02:52:06,220 --> 02:52:08,830
And if you have an experience that 
defies that,

3694
02:52:09,340 --> 02:52:11,650
then you'll make different decisions for
yourself in the future.

3695
02:52:11,651 --> 02:52:12,484
But you have to have like that woman 
will probably make different decisions 

3696
02:52:15,221 --> 02:52:16,054
for herself in the future because now 
she trusts her body like just a little 

3697
02:52:18,551 --> 02:52:19,900
bit more,
you know,

3698
02:52:19,901 --> 02:52:24,280
she's that much less afraid of all of 
the horror stories.

3699
02:52:24,281 --> 02:52:28,750
The fearmongering is the greatest 
marketing device,

3700
02:52:29,170 --> 02:52:30,003
you know,
employed by the industry is scaring you 

3701
02:52:32,411 --> 02:52:34,570
into what if you don't do it.

3702
02:52:35,350 --> 02:52:36,183
Bunch of people that like when they do 
catch Murcia or something like that and 

3703
02:52:39,611 --> 02:52:44,611
then get devastated like the right move 
is to get on an IV antibiotic.

3704
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:47,580
Like is isn't that sometimes

3705
02:52:47,800 --> 02:52:50,760
you just told me a story where that's 
not true.

3706
02:52:51,130 --> 02:52:53,520
What told you a story.
Okay,

3707
02:52:53,521 --> 02:52:54,354
so then what is one but it's one and she
had a topical issue but if it's one in 

3708
02:53:00,001 --> 02:53:03,300
you're the one then that's important 
information for yourself.

3709
02:53:03,320 --> 02:53:05,070
It certainly is.
I mean antibiotics

3710
02:53:05,320 --> 02:53:06,153
but I mean don't,
don't they serve a purpose in some 

3711
02:53:07,781 --> 02:53:09,550
functions sometimes.
I mean,

3712
02:53:09,790 --> 02:53:11,620
you don't want to throw the baby out 
with the bath water,

3713
02:53:11,621 --> 02:53:12,311
right?
I mean,

3714
02:53:12,311 --> 02:53:15,280
if someone has some rapid aggressive 
infection,

3715
02:53:15,281 --> 02:53:16,480
a bacterial infection,

3716
02:53:17,560 --> 02:53:21,820
if we only used antibiotics for true 
life or death emergencies,

3717
02:53:22,030 --> 02:53:25,630
we would have a very different situation
on our hands than what we have now,

3718
02:53:26,050 --> 02:53:28,270
which is a combination of,
you know,

3719
02:53:28,271 --> 02:53:30,640
devastating our ecosystem.
You know,

3720
02:53:30,641 --> 02:53:31,474
making people gravely ill because they 
have very serious and totally 

3721
02:53:34,481 --> 02:53:38,320
unpredictable side effects including 
longterm neurologic side effects.

3722
02:53:38,680 --> 02:53:40,000
Um,
you know,

3723
02:53:40,270 --> 02:53:41,260
the,
the,

3724
02:53:41,560 --> 02:53:42,393
what's even going on with our livestock,
like we are in a mess with our worship 

3725
02:53:46,120 --> 02:53:47,630
of this idea of,
of,

3726
02:53:47,650 --> 02:53:50,230
and you know what antibiotic means.
It means against life.

3727
02:53:50,231 --> 02:53:53,830
Like literally there's something wrong 
headed about that mentality.

3728
02:53:53,831 --> 02:53:56,020
And so it comes back to philosophy.
Like,

3729
02:53:56,140 --> 02:53:58,090
if you want to believe in,
in war,

3730
02:53:58,300 --> 02:53:59,890
you know,
you want to war against your body,

3731
02:53:59,891 --> 02:54:00,724
you want to war against and blame all 
the bad people who do all this bad 

3732
02:54:03,191 --> 02:54:06,190
things and you want to lock them up in 
prisons and you want to hate the,

3733
02:54:06,460 --> 02:54:08,590
you know,
you know,

3734
02:54:08,591 --> 02:54:10,910
Arabs and terrorists.
And if that's fair,

3735
02:54:11,610 --> 02:54:12,443
but if that's your general vibe,
then it's gonna make sense to take 

3736
02:54:15,731 --> 02:54:17,380
medications like that for you.
Right.

3737
02:54:17,381 --> 02:54:18,160
But I,
you know,

3738
02:54:18,160 --> 02:54:22,210
have plenty of colleagues and myself,
we have a different philosophy.

3739
02:54:22,211 --> 02:54:25,570
So that's why it comes down to it's a 
religion,

3740
02:54:25,660 --> 02:54:26,493
you know,
it really comes down to your belief 

3741
02:54:27,071 --> 02:54:27,904
system.

3742
02:54:27,910 --> 02:54:28,743
So your philosophy is improve the health
of the gut biome taken natural 

3743
02:54:33,071 --> 02:54:35,350
antibiotics,
things like garlic,

3744
02:54:35,351 --> 02:54:37,890
things like Oregano oil,
things that are nature.

3745
02:54:37,890 --> 02:54:38,723
Yeah,
right,

3746
02:54:38,850 --> 02:54:40,710
right.
Get back to the continuum.

3747
02:54:40,711 --> 02:54:41,940
Like,
you know,

3748
02:54:41,941 --> 02:54:46,440
there's this notion that there's like a,
a path where meant to walk,

3749
02:54:46,441 --> 02:54:49,920
you know,
where we sort of follow our,

3750
02:54:49,921 --> 02:54:54,360
what our ancestors sort of set us up for
and we've strayed from it big time.

3751
02:54:54,361 --> 02:54:57,420
And,
and we're in some ways being reminded,

3752
02:54:57,421 --> 02:54:58,254
you know,
that we can't go too much farther 

3753
02:54:59,700 --> 02:55:02,370
without like struggling pretty 
seriously.

3754
02:55:02,490 --> 02:55:04,040
I think one of the big

3755
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:05,930
points that you just made,
which is really huge,

3756
02:55:05,960 --> 02:55:10,960
is that if we only used antibiotics when
necessary in life or death situations,

3757
02:55:11,420 --> 02:55:14,510
we wouldn't have the issues that we have
right now with livestock,

3758
02:55:14,511 --> 02:55:15,344
with,
with people's House and the people take 

3759
02:55:16,881 --> 02:55:17,714
z packs like it's going out of style.
I mean they take them out to take 

3760
02:55:19,701 --> 02:55:20,534
tylenol for a headache.
I know so many people that take 

3761
02:55:22,701 --> 02:55:24,890
antibiotics,
they just throw him down.

3762
02:55:25,140 --> 02:55:26,070
Oh,
I feel so much better.

3763
02:55:26,071 --> 02:55:26,904
I took a z pack.
Like you might feel better because you 

3764
02:55:28,840 --> 02:55:29,673
going to feel better anyway,
and the z pack he just threw on top of 

3765
02:55:32,001 --> 02:55:35,510
the mix and decided that that was what 
was taking you over the top.

3766
02:55:35,720 --> 02:55:36,441
That's right.
Meanwhile,

3767
02:55:36,441 --> 02:55:39,170
it's like in the water supply now is it 
z packs,

3768
02:55:39,350 --> 02:55:42,110
but it's like microscopic levels that 
you can't really,

3769
02:55:42,290 --> 02:55:44,060
they're not psychoactive,
right,

3770
02:55:44,090 --> 02:55:44,670
isn't it?

3771
02:55:44,670 --> 02:55:47,540
There was just this,
there was just something I put on social

3772
02:55:47,541 --> 02:55:48,374
media.
It was like studying fish that are 

3773
02:55:51,231 --> 02:55:56,231
exposed to antidepressant water and they
became like more aggressive.

3774
02:55:57,470 --> 02:55:58,990
Something like,
you know,

3775
02:55:59,180 --> 02:56:00,013
fish aren't made happier by but,
but the point is that antidepressants 

3776
02:56:02,511 --> 02:56:03,344
are just in the water supply now to 
products apparently in dosages relevant 

3777
02:56:07,101 --> 02:56:09,800
to the clinical expression of fish 
behavior.

3778
02:56:09,801 --> 02:56:12,320
I don't know.
But Jesus Christ.

3779
02:56:12,600 --> 02:56:14,510
Yeah.
I mean there's no free lunch.

3780
02:56:14,511 --> 02:56:16,100
There's no free lunch with Pharma I 
think.

3781
02:56:16,280 --> 02:56:19,220
But if you're in a fishing that's good 
cause you want fish to be aggressive.

3782
02:56:19,330 --> 02:56:22,310
I mean maybe they don't want to be,
I'll give a fuck what they want.

3783
02:56:22,311 --> 02:56:23,144
I'm going to eat chill.
I've never seen one fisher just eating 

3784
02:56:27,891 --> 02:56:30,320
things.
Mostly other fish are a bunch of goddamn

3785
02:56:30,380 --> 02:56:32,030
cannibals.
All of them.

3786
02:56:32,630 --> 02:56:34,690
Um,
yeah.

3787
02:56:35,090 --> 02:56:36,380
Silly,
silly thoughts.

3788
02:56:36,740 --> 02:56:38,120
Thanks for indulging in those,
by the way.

3789
02:56:38,420 --> 02:56:39,920
Um,
and thanks for coming on here.

3790
02:56:39,921 --> 02:56:41,480
I really appreciate it.
We just sent three hours.

3791
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:42,840
It was fun.
Wow.

3792
02:56:43,580 --> 02:56:44,413
Quite an attention span.
So you do not need to add or all you're 

3793
02:56:46,431 --> 02:56:50,630
doing just I'm scared of that or all.
I'd had two cups of coffee though,

3794
02:56:50,810 --> 02:56:54,470
but if I had adderall,
I just don't want to try one day,

3795
02:56:54,950 --> 02:56:55,783
but it's,
I'm terrified of it and Canadian study 

3796
02:56:57,531 --> 02:57:00,440
just came out that if,
if you take a stimulant,

3797
02:57:00,441 --> 02:57:04,700
you're 13 times more likely to be 
prescribed and it's a psychotic and four

3798
02:57:04,701 --> 02:57:06,920
times more likely to be prescribed 
Canadian.

3799
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:08,033
Like regular people.
There's totally different kind of 

3800
02:57:09,351 --> 02:57:10,550
person.
Very important.

3801
02:57:10,730 --> 02:57:14,780
Super important to confounding variables
from the woods.

3802
02:57:15,080 --> 02:57:17,180
They're forest folks.
I know.

3803
02:57:19,010 --> 02:57:21,290
All right Kelly,
so one more time to tell people.

3804
02:57:21,650 --> 02:57:23,420
What does the name of your book where 
you can get it?

3805
02:57:23,780 --> 02:57:27,740
I'm sure you're going to get a lot of 
positive and negative stay offline for a

3806
02:57:27,740 --> 02:57:28,573
couple of days.

3807
02:57:28,800 --> 02:57:32,630
Just I do have your back.
I'm just telling you I don't want,

3808
02:57:32,870 --> 02:57:35,000
I don't want you to get hit with the 
trolls.

3809
02:57:35,930 --> 02:57:36,763
No,
listen,

3810
02:57:37,490 --> 02:57:39,020
first of all,
it's important.

3811
02:57:39,080 --> 02:57:41,930
It's my disclaimer that I'm not here to 
tell anyone what to do,

3812
02:57:42,080 --> 02:57:45,050
right?
It's just about informed consent.

3813
02:57:45,320 --> 02:57:46,153
And if you know all the information,
you want it to continue making your 

3814
02:57:47,601 --> 02:57:48,434
choice do you were saying,
but I do believe people are entitled to 

3815
02:57:51,080 --> 02:57:53,900
all of the Information and I didn't know
about it when I was prescribing,

3816
02:57:53,901 --> 02:57:55,810
so I carry that charge,
you know?

3817
02:57:56,420 --> 02:58:00,380
So my book is called the mind of your 
own and,

3818
02:58:00,381 --> 02:58:03,750
um,
the rest of my nonsense on my website,

3819
02:58:03,960 --> 02:58:05,520
just Kelly Brogan,
md.com.

3820
02:58:05,690 --> 02:58:07,110
All right.
Beautiful.

3821
02:58:07,170 --> 02:58:09,630
Thank you so much.
Enjoy the total pleasure.

3822
02:58:09,910 --> 02:58:10,830
All right,
my friends,

3823
02:58:10,860 --> 02:58:11,693
that's it.
We'll be back tomorrow with hilarious 

3824
02:58:13,141 --> 02:58:17,580
and drew Santino don't till then get off
those pills.

3825
02:58:17,581 --> 02:58:20,070
You fucked or don'ts.
