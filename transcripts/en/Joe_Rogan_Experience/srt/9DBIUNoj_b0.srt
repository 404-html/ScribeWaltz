Daniel Pinchbeck is in the house.

6
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:13,464
Ladies and gentlemen,

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,560
strapping and experience.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,833
We're going to get crazy

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,640
[inaudible].

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,200
It's taken a long ride

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,773
down.

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,810
Some of my favorite schools
of thought with this guy here.

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,790
Daniel Pinchbeck is a author.

14
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:37,630
If you'd never heard of him,

15
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:41,500
he's got a great book called breaking
open the head and another one called,

16
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:41,860
uh,

17
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,550
2012 the return of Queso Quadel is that,

18
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:46,121
how do I say it?

19
00:00:46,121 --> 00:00:46,450
Right?

20
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,110
Good enough.

21
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,531
Good enough.

22
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:48,270
Close enough.

23
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,360
[inaudible] and I'm just an all around.

24
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:53,260
Fascinating dude.

25
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,071
Thanks for coming by,

26
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:54,281
man.

27
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:55,480
I'm sorry you got stuck in traffic,

28
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:59,680
but it's almost appropriate because
you're sort of a little bit of a doom and

29
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:01,030
gloom end of civilization,

30
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:04,450
sort of a dude and there's a giant power
outage in la that fuck traffic upside

31
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:04,870
down.

32
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,201
Well,

33
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:05,411
yeah.

34
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:07,480
Now that I know that I feel
better about the situation.

35
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,380
Yeah.

36
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,213
Do you though?

37
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:09,851
Oh,

38
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:10,391
finally.

39
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:13,300
Some apocalyptic shit's
happening and while I'm here,

40
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,193
perfect.

41
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,041
In New York,

42
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:17,470
we just had a hurricane and
an earthquake and a one week,

43
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,190
uh,

44
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,230
I moved here when the earthquake happened.

45
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,380
I moved here like only like a month
after the earthquake in [inaudible] 94

46
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:23,801
happened.

47
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:27,550
And it was this feeling of
humility in La that I liked.

48
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,720
Like when I first got here,

49
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:28,931
I was like,

50
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:30,190
people are seem kind of shook up,

51
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,510
but they seem pretty friendly,

52
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,051
you know,

53
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,520
sort of almost like,

54
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,180
you know,

55
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,090
any sort of a natural disaster
does to any big group of people,

56
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:37,631
you know,

57
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:38,464
they uh,

58
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,550
what are you doing there buddy?

59
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,990
I'm looking at your Alpha brain.

60
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,560
Do you want some,

61
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,070
what is it?

62
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,120
It's own nootropics.

63
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:45,110
It's vitamins for cognitive function.

64
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,340
Sure.

65
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,480
We're not going to go get brighter.

66
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,180
It's 1.5 million people
in power right now.

67
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:50,650
I think it was in Los Angeles,

68
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:51,550
in Los Angeles right now,

69
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:52,510
which is kind of crazy.

70
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,230
But yeah,

71
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,831
it is crazy.

72
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:55,060
That's a lot of fucking people.

73
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,141
We sell those.

74
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:56,801
I'll get you a bottle.

75
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:57,221
Those things,

76
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:57,490
man.

77
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,271
We just started,

78
00:01:58,271 --> 00:01:58,720
uh,

79
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,770
putting those out on a,

80
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:02,560
on@dotcomonnit.com.

81
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,641
And what it is is,

82
00:02:03,641 --> 00:02:04,240
uh,

83
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,750
there's a lot of different things that
people take to improve mental function

84
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:12,700
and they just put the highest
ingredients together and started a,

85
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,563
started selling it.

86
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,260
Nice.

87
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,550
It's fascinating stuff man.

88
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:15,941
You know,

89
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:16,081
the,

90
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:17,710
the science of it is a little sketchy.

91
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,150
A lot of people call bullshit,

92
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,040
but I think it works.

93
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,641
Works for me,

94
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,000
man.

95
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,410
Even if it's just a placebo effect.

96
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:26,020
I'll take all the lies that
you tell me if I believe them.

97
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,310
It seems like it works to me too.

98
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:27,671
Well,

99
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:29,780
the dreams or no question you,

100
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,370
you,

101
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:30,980
you take them,

102
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,260
you have this fucking,

103
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,890
these crazy vivid rememberable dreams.

104
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:36,940
It's very unusual.

105
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:39,370
And supposedly it's because of Coleen.

106
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:40,120
Is that how you saying?

107
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,570
Is that the,

108
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,380
the nutrient,

109
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,810
I believe you said it's called Coleen,

110
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,540
but apparently it's known
to stimulate dreams.

111
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,190
It gives you fucking weird,

112
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:49,024
creepy,

113
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,140
memorable dreams.

114
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,120
I've got a weird dream of battle Werewolf
and a gorilla having sex and I was

115
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:57,880
trying to be quiet and get out of the
room before they realized I was there

116
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,170
because you,

117
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,190
I was last night

118
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,360
I was laying in bed and I was looking
up your books on Amazon and uh,

119
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,920
the one cover he has is so trippy.

120
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,790
I actually spent a good time just
scrolling up and down on my browser.

121
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,990
Just looking at the code.

122
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,980
Which one?

123
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,780
Over the head?

124
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,310
I think so.

125
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,390
And the one that has the mushroom in
the middle and then it's just like,

126
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,920
it was fucking awesome.

127
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,101
I,

128
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:19,870
that's how stone it was
the last time you're,

129
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,723
you're here

130
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,660
when this is,

131
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,580
what if this really was going down?

132
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,980
Like right now in Los Angeles.

133
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:26,761
Are you prepared?

134
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:29,640
Because I know you're a big 2012
advocate and I've talked to you about,

135
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,791
well,

136
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:30,660
I'm just that of burning man,

137
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:33,350
so at least I have my flashlight
and Kevin [inaudible].

138
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,620
Did you just leave burning man?

139
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,070
Yeah,

140
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:35,903
three days ago.

141
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,600
Wow.

142
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,350
I was it,

143
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,920
it was great.

144
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,300
Now you're like my age,

145
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:39,750
right?

146
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,290
45.

147
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,123
I'm 44.

148
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,170
Do you not tired of those,

149
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,890
those crazy hippies yet really nutty ones,

150
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,331
you know,

151
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:48,721
whatever.

152
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:48,931
I mean,

153
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:49,160
I,

154
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,993
I,

155
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,970
I like the whole scene.

156
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:51,091
I mean,

157
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:52,320
it's all sorts of genius people.

158
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:54,080
They're actually like a very,

159
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:54,390
like,

160
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,970
not just hippies but the heads
of all the technology companies.

161
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:59,630
I had to debate with
them Google exact cause,

162
00:03:59,631 --> 00:03:59,720
a,

163
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,690
he was a yoga practitioner and you know,

164
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,010
just,

165
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,530
I have lots of great
conversations where they are.

166
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,200
I mean it's all the,

167
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,350
you know,

168
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,510
the psychedelic community.

169
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:08,760
And I spent a lot of time with this
woman who runs the women's visionary

170
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:13,050
Congress and my friend John Perry Barlow
who wrote lyrics for the grateful dead

171
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:15,390
and it started electronic
freedom foundation.

172
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,530
Um,

173
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,700
it's actually an amazing,

174
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:18,031
uh,

175
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:18,300
you know,

176
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,700
brain trust of,

177
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,740
of human oddities and eccentric fossils.

178
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,730
I believe that.

179
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,970
But there's also a lot of douchebags
and you've got to wade through them.

180
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:27,870
And when your,

181
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,980
what you are is like this figurehead for
this psychedelic movement and sort of a

182
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:32,700
lot of ways.

183
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,020
So you must get a lot of crackpots.

184
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,040
And when I say Douche bags,

185
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:35,700
it's not their fault.

186
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,830
I didn't just say us a lot of it,

187
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,683
there's a lot of crazy,

188
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,000
she didn't have one,

189
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:40,530
a douchebag experience and all every,

190
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,890
a lot of people did come up to you and
whoever who was cool who would read my

191
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:48,020
books or seen the film and people were
extremely like respectful and I still

192
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,631
kind of like,

193
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:50,400
I'm like moving like people tell me,

194
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:52,890
people told me that the books had
affected them or impacted their lives.

195
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,070
Sure.

196
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,361
What I mean,

197
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:56,130
every dead show I've ever been to
or any fish show I've ever been,

198
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,460
it was never been douche bag.

199
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,110
So I was think you would think that
there'd be a shitload distract.

200
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:01,940
Everyone has like this
positive vibe to them.

201
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:02,510
So everyone,

202
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,650
even if there are a douche bag,

203
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:05,030
they still have like this underlining.

204
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,331
Yeah.

205
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:06,920
I'm like a happy and in love.

206
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,900
I want to give you love
and positive energy.

207
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:11,780
It seems like the whole scene and stuff
like so I just have a negative idea.

208
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:12,321
I think so.

209
00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:14,450
I think you're like carbon right now.

210
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,430
I lived in boulder for a walking,

211
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:17,790
became very terrified of him.

212
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,490
You're very east coast.

213
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,461
Before.

214
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:23,160
I was like so down with it and you're
around them for wine like Todd.

215
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,690
So many people are fucking crazy.

216
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,850
You know everybody's crazy.

217
00:05:26,851 --> 00:05:29,550
You know there's a Republican's a
crazy right wing Christians or crazy.

218
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,230
I mean you look at the
Republican convention,

219
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:31,920
you look at these,

220
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,281
these,

221
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:33,101
these speeches is,

222
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:33,810
so there's these,

223
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,370
these debates they're having,

224
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,410
it's like one nutty
fucking person after nutty,

225
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,220
nutty person.

226
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,930
I mean it's this fucking,

227
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,450
the guy from California with a guy from
the Massachusetts rather mitten Romney.

228
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:45,780
He's,

229
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,613
he's a Mormon.

230
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,960
I mean at a certain point
in time you got to go,

231
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:49,501
come on man.

232
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:52,050
Really you believe that Joseph Smith,

233
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,530
this 14 year old kid found
these golden tablets with the,

234
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,940
the last words of,

235
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,010
and only you

236
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,750
could read them cause
you had a magic rock.

237
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,003
Really.

238
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,040
Okay.

239
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,460
Right.

240
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,300
At a certain point in time,

241
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:04,134
I mean,

242
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:04,600
how,

243
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,620
how does a guy like that allowed
to even run for president?

244
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,793
Wow.

245
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,880
Is there certain things that you believe,

246
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,990
do you think that there should be a line
that like someone completed signing go,

247
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:14,261
come on,

248
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:15,040
man,

249
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,740
this is crazy.

250
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,530
It was very hard to draw
that line at this point.

251
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:17,831
I mean,

252
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:18,300
people,

253
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:18,610
you know,

254
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,320
believing in the Bible and so on,

255
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:21,130
it's hard enough.

256
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:21,250
We'll,

257
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,720
how about the 6,000 year people?

258
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:24,940
The people that really believe
the earth is 6,000 years old.

259
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:25,863
There's a lot of them.

260
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,063
Sarah Palin,

261
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,260
she really believes that

262
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,653
a lot of people do.

263
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,360
I think you learned from that movie
red state that that like everybody,

264
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:38,350
there's a this big center of the world
that's really crazy and like fucking,

265
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:40,090
they believe crazy shit.

266
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,081
Like you can't,

267
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:43,750
even though I just watched that
wild whites of West Virginia.

268
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:43,990
Oh,

269
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,201
I mean,

270
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:44,620
yeah,

271
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,170
those people believe probably
things that you would be amazed.

272
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,690
I don't think that they're
thinking about that.

273
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:49,590
They're just pill people.

274
00:06:49,591 --> 00:06:51,120
Pill pop and people in partiers.

275
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:51,590
Yeah.

276
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,210
And you've seen that the wild and
wonderful whites of West Virginia.

277
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,930
Nope.

278
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,190
It's a fascinating yet
terrifying documentary that
Johnny Knoxville put together

279
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,870
about this family in West Virginia.

280
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:02,250
That's completely crazy.

281
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:02,700
Hmm.

282
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,530
All there do.

283
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,530
Like they're just constantly committing
crimes and selling pills and going on

284
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:11,040
rampages and get arrested and
just a fascinating family.

285
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,920
That's just not living by
the rules that you are.

286
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:14,754
I live by,

287
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,370
no,

288
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,710
now Berston burning man was sold
out this year and it's just like,

289
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:20,540
I think the first time
that it was ever sold out.

290
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,900
Did it seem like overly
crowded or did it seem like,

291
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,100
why did they even put a,

292
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,193
uh,

293
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,850
they don't have a control over that.

294
00:07:27,851 --> 00:07:29,080
It's the bureau of land management.

295
00:07:29,081 --> 00:07:29,710
I think it's a,

296
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:29,951
actually,

297
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:31,270
because it counts as a city.

298
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:32,270
It's only allowed to go three Pr,

299
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:32,590
uh,

300
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,150
to grow 3% per year.

301
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,480
So it was growing from 51 to
54,000 or something like that.

302
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,900
Right.

303
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,471
Something like that.

304
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:38,801
So,

305
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:39,634
um,

306
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,211
so yeah,

307
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:43,300
I mean he could easily go up to 75 or a
hundred thousand in terms of the space

308
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:43,511
there.

309
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:43,631
I mean,

310
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:43,991
they just keep,

311
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:46,630
they can just keep adding avenues
and expanding it and so on.

312
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,100
Do you see any awesome art?

313
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:48,934
Did you see any like,

314
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:49,571
wow,

315
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:51,520
they took it to the next
level type shit this year?

316
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,300
Um,

317
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:52,571
yeah,

318
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:52,791
there were,

319
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,000
so there was some beautiful stuff there.

320
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:56,110
There was a huge model
of the Trojan horse,

321
00:07:56,111 --> 00:08:01,111
which a 300 Greeks and white togas a
drag for the gates and they blew it up in

322
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:03,130
spectacular fashion on Friday night.

323
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:03,964
There's lots of fun stuff.

324
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,301
Oh,

325
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:05,134
that sounds pretty fun.

326
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,500
I want to go so bad.

327
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:09,320
Like I talked about it and
maybe fit 20 podcasts ago.

328
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,230
Like I was thinking about going and
I'm mad at myself for not going.

329
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,920
Perceptions are always just going
to be some really cool people did,

330
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:18,150
but just going to wade through
some knuckleheads to get to them.

331
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:20,010
But you're sounding
like it's not that way.

332
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,780
You're sounding like it's
pretty positive overall.

333
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,591
Yeah,

334
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:23,011
I mean I'm,

335
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:23,380
you know,

336
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,310
I still like it.

337
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:24,970
No,

338
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,610
it's still not.

339
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,443
Okay.

340
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,190
What if this is December 21st,

341
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,320
2012 is the the big day and that's,

342
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:31,910
you know,

343
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,210
etched in stone and a lot of people's
ideas about a lot of the shit that you

344
00:08:36,211 --> 00:08:39,990
write about and a lot of the shit that
people think of about the coming of the

345
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,680
next age.

346
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,060
If it rolls around and nothing happens,

347
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:42,690
then what?

348
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,310
Right.

349
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:43,531
Yeah.

350
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:43,681
Well,

351
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:43,831
I mean,

352
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:43,891
I,

353
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:44,321
once again,

354
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:44,581
we're actually,

355
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:47,160
people would have to look at whatever I
said and read about it because I never,

356
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:49,020
I never particularly said that
anything was going to happen.

357
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:49,854
Absolutely true.

358
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,300
Yes.

359
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,133
I mean,

360
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,080
absolutely having that,

361
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,291
you know,

362
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:52,741
on the other hand,

363
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,200
it seems to me that it's
super clear that we're in

364
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,370
the middle of a transformation that,

365
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:58,711
that,

366
00:08:58,711 --> 00:08:59,041
uh,

367
00:08:59,041 --> 00:08:59,311
you know,

368
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:02,100
we can see now the global
economy is buckling.

369
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,610
The planetary ecology is also buckling.

370
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,530
We've re we've hit peak oil.

371
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,370
A lot of the resources are
in a serious depletion.

372
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,301
Um,

373
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:12,751
so yeah,

374
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:12,931
we're,

375
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:13,141
we're,

376
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:13,990
we're faced with,

377
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:14,210
with,

378
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,520
with an end game for the,

379
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,910
for the current global
civilization that we're adding.

380
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,250
Is that peak oil thing
been clearly established?

381
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,851
Yeah,

382
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,200
it's been very clearly established.

383
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:24,270
So everyone agrees it's
not a debated thing.

384
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,481
Well,

385
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:24,661
I mean,

386
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:25,261
of course there's,

387
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:25,471
there's,

388
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:27,540
there's some debate and
there's some misinformation.

389
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:27,990
There's a lot of,

390
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,130
there's a lot of money involved,

391
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:29,281
you know,

392
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:30,114
but if you look at what,

393
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,361
you know,

394
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:30,471
the,

395
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:30,670
the,

396
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,720
the main geologists talk about,

397
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:34,021
and you know,

398
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:34,201
I mean,

399
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:36,170
it's prediction that was
made back in the 70s.

400
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,410
That's why they're trying to
get all this oil in Canada.

401
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,950
There's big protests had been happening
on the White House lawn where Daryl

402
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,701
Hannah got arrested.

403
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:49,260
One of the NASA's top climate scientists
get arrested and they're protesting

404
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,180
this extraction,

405
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:53,490
which is apparently
incredibly inefficient.

406
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:53,551
Yeah,

407
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:53,911
of course.

408
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:54,590
But it's why we are,

409
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:54,991
we are,

410
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:55,381
you know,

411
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:56,340
in wars and,

412
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:56,581
you know,

413
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:56,940
Libya,

414
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,710
Afghanistan and Iraq and you know,

415
00:09:58,711 --> 00:09:59,970
why we're trying to hold down the,

416
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:00,211
you know,

417
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:00,341
our,

418
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:01,310
our access to the,

419
00:10:01,311 --> 00:10:02,640
to the remaining resources,

420
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,493
you know.

421
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,110
Um,

422
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:04,441
but yeah,

423
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:04,681
so,

424
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:05,101
so,

425
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:05,370
um,

426
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,720
I never represent anticipated than
anything exactly what happened on December

427
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:09,720
21st,

428
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,950
2012 although it certainly might.

429
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,551
Uh,

430
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:12,390
but I think that,

431
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:12,571
uh,

432
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:12,931
you know,

433
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:13,110
the,

434
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,380
what we need to do and when I tried to
do and in my work up to this point is

435
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:20,400
really tried to take a big step
back and look at our situation.

436
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,250
And factory in all sorts of stuff that,

437
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,940
you know,

438
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,940
the modern worldview was
not really factoring in,

439
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:29,730
which for me includes Shamanism,

440
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:29,971
you know,

441
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:31,650
the DMT experience,

442
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,600
psychic experience in general.

443
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:33,840
Uh,

444
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,051
you know,

445
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:37,730
the kind of psychic capacities that
actually many people are aware of that

446
00:10:37,731 --> 00:10:38,580
happen all the time,

447
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:41,190
whether it's synchronicity
or tube top of thing.

448
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:42,240
And so we were on the phone today.

449
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,240
We talked to,

450
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,100
I talked to you about it.

451
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,630
Like I was picking up your,

452
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,950
I picked up my phone and I was going
through the contacts to find your number

453
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,780
and the phone rang and it was you.

454
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,703
I love that shit.

455
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:53,611
That's,

456
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,200
that's as creepy as it gets.

457
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:55,831
What are the,

458
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:56,910
there's a lot of minutes in a day,

459
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:57,570
more and more.

460
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:57,930
Right?

461
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,920
How do you know what I'm calling you,

462
00:10:58,921 --> 00:10:59,071
man?

463
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:00,390
There's a lot of God demands in the day.

464
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:01,620
When was the last time
I fucking called you?

465
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,071
I mean,

466
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:02,281
yeah,

467
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:03,960
you were supposed to be on the podcast,

468
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:04,201
the name.

469
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:05,610
We had emailed each other about it,

470
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:07,860
but we hadn't talked on
the phone a long ass time.

471
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,150
That's a weird coincidence.

472
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,021
Right?

473
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:10,141
Well,

474
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:10,370
I mean,

475
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:10,481
you,

476
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:12,270
you think you could say
that it's weird and creepy,

477
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:15,000
but then you kind of get past that point
and you just kind of integrate it and

478
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:15,241
it's like,

479
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:15,511
okay,

480
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:15,991
there's somehow,

481
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:20,580
there's actually no one consciousness
that's kind of working through all of us.

482
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:20,731
And,

483
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:20,981
and,

484
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:21,390
and,

485
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:21,631
you know,

486
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:24,210
as time moves on in this period,

487
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:26,550
it seems like those synchronicities
are speeding up and our,

488
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:30,060
and our psychic capacities
are somehow and intensifying,

489
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,080
you know,

490
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,340
but,

491
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,430
but I will say that my one idea
I'm working on for December 21st,

492
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,180
2012 is to utilize the date because now
there's so much popular focus on it to

493
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:41,190
create a kind of global events,

494
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,900
which would be a kind of spectacle.

495
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,950
I'm working with the composers and a team
from Cirque du Solei and they're kind

496
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:51,630
of putting together a concept for a
show that would kind of celebrate humans

497
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:52,500
evolution,

498
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:53,060
you know,

499
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,620
mentees evolution to this present point
and then ending with a synchronized,

500
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,473
uh,

501
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:02,890
peace meditation kind of global focus
on unity with the idea that you could,

502
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:03,730
you could take that,

503
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:07,660
the energy for that that's pointed
towards that day and there's so much fear

504
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:11,080
around that and anxiety and trepidation
and actually make it into like the most

505
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:12,640
awesome thing possible where it's like,

506
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:12,791
well,

507
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:17,260
look where we've arrived at and look at
our opportunities now to make a shift

508
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:20,650
and a jump into a new form
of planetary civilization.

509
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:20,871
Well,

510
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:21,560
this is the,

511
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,120
the,

512
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,040
the clearest time in human
history where the common person,

513
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,940
any person really has a direct influence
over an incredible amount of people

514
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:30,230
with viral information,

515
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:33,380
with videos and with anything that you
ride that really resonates with people.

516
00:12:33,381 --> 00:12:35,840
You can hit an amazing
amount of people now.

517
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,170
So a guy like you could get in touch
with a bunch of other people who could do

518
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,490
exactly the same thing.

519
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,300
And a ripple effect can go on and it
can hit millions and millions easy.

520
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,760
There's never been an opportunity
to do anything like that.

521
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,080
Got,

522
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,680
we totally love to have you
involved with our unified earth.

523
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,870
I'm not too sure.

524
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,200
Let's do see real sure.

525
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,670
Start to say I'm down.

526
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,241
Actually,

527
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,800
we're actually working at,

528
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,151
at the moment,

529
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:57,571
at the moment,

530
00:12:57,571 --> 00:12:57,990
we're actually in

531
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,260
negotiation with the Mexican
government to use a Chichen Itza,

532
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:01,261
Chichen Itza,

533
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:04,140
which is considered by the Mayans
to be the heart of the Mayan world.

534
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,370
You know,

535
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,460
it would be the shit dude,

536
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,950
a Toby Keith concert at cheats in Eatsa
gotta be the most ironic thing of all

537
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:10,784
time.

538
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:14,180
So he keeps his like this super raw,

539
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:15,770
raw American country music.

540
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:16,920
He's like,

541
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,540
[inaudible],

542
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,530
I'm gonna kick your ass.

543
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:18,711
You know?

544
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:19,700
He's like one of those guys.

545
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:20,060
He's,

546
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,810
but he's kind of,

547
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,621
he's a good singer.

548
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:22,101
I mean his,

549
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,240
he's got good songs,

550
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,141
but there are just,

551
00:13:24,141 --> 00:13:26,930
some of them are like real
knucklehead Rah Rah Rah songs.

552
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,040
I just think him on the fucking pyramids
play in a concert might be one of the

553
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,540
most ironic things of all time.

554
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:34,791
Oh,

555
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:35,211
awesome.

556
00:13:35,211 --> 00:13:36,044
America.

557
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,030
You can love it or leave it.

558
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,980
He had a good song about smoking
weed with Willie Nelson though.

559
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,260
He's got good music.

560
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:42,891
He's got a good music.

561
00:13:42,891 --> 00:13:43,870
I just think it would be funny.

562
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,041
Be Funny.

563
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:46,191
Yeah.

564
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:46,771
I'm scared to teach.

565
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:47,390
Teacher need to know.

566
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,390
Don't ever get a Mexican dream right.

567
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,420
That dream down right now.

568
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,620
It's on the Internet.

569
00:13:51,621 --> 00:13:53,420
Now we can draw this dream for you.

570
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,351
You're right.

571
00:13:54,351 --> 00:13:54,891
I should bullshit.

572
00:13:54,891 --> 00:13:57,310
Never stopped dreaming
going never stop to the eye.

573
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:58,144
I think

574
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,570
as as you do that things are moving in a
certain direction and I wonder how much

575
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:03,291
people steer it.

576
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:05,170
You know how much things like this steer,

577
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,380
how much communication online steers it
because it seems to me this is the only

578
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:14,381
time where people have been able to sort
of like merge in this way globally on

579
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:16,910
their own and do it on a regular basis.

580
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:17,150
You know,

581
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,070
people are addicted to
just going on Twitter,

582
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:23,270
addicted to communicating with people
on message boards and on Facebook and

583
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:23,781
there,

584
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:23,991
there,

585
00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:24,201
there,

586
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:24,471
there's,

587
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:24,681
there's,

588
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:27,110
there's an inner connectivity
that's never existed before.

589
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:32,111
So an idea that the idea of a hive
mind like influenced by anyone is way

590
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:35,330
different now than it's ever been
in human history as far as we know,

591
00:14:35,331 --> 00:14:35,810
right?

592
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,381
Absolutely.

593
00:14:36,381 --> 00:14:36,561
Yeah.

594
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:37,320
Amazing Time,

595
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,440
Huh?

596
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,651
Yeah,

597
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:37,921
for sure.

598
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:39,860
I mean now one idea that a lot of um,

599
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,620
different people are kind of moving
towards this idea that maybe humanities on

600
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:46,590
the verb of transition on the verge of
transitioning into being kind of like a

601
00:14:46,591 --> 00:14:47,730
super organism.

602
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,391
You know,

603
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:52,970
that we're kind of like coming to
awareness of ourselves as a being in a

604
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:53,421
sentence,

605
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:53,631
you know,

606
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:54,800
and then we can,

607
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:55,400
you know,

608
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,210
begin to act more symbiotically rather
than like parasitically or aggressively.

609
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,450
There was a really fascinating article
recently written on creativity and how

610
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:07,230
people are always praising creativity
and looking forward to getting new and

611
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:08,064
creative ideas,

612
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,000
but that other people's creativity
actually makes people uncomfortable.

613
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,310
It makes people uncomfortable and uneasy.

614
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,490
And the idea that someone had come
up with these ideas that they didn't,

615
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,241
you know,

616
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:19,074
and you know,

617
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,251
you,

618
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,080
you wonder if like the,

619
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:25,680
the really powerful push
towards fundamentalism,

620
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:29,580
the really powerful push towards a
6,000 year old earth kind of Shit,

621
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,181
you know,

622
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:35,181
and follow the Bible kind of Shit is
really the same thing as someone trying to

623
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,050
confined creativity.

624
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:39,340
They're trying to confine
enlightenment will say reasonable.

625
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,370
I guess my feeling is basically,

626
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:41,641
you know,

627
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:41,990
we,

628
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,910
we live in a culture where there's,

629
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,400
um,

630
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:44,581
you know,

631
00:15:44,581 --> 00:15:45,414
basically they're being,

632
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,240
people are being indoctrinated
not to think they're being,

633
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:50,260
they're being indoctrinated by the,

634
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:51,060
the media,

635
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,510
the mainstream culture by the
education system to be ignorant,

636
00:15:54,511 --> 00:15:55,470
to not question,

637
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:58,620
to not develop their independent
capacity of thoughts.

638
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,261
Are you okay,

639
00:15:59,261 --> 00:16:03,130
but you saying this as an
from the education system
or he's saying this from the

640
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:03,820
media?

641
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:03,970
Yeah,

642
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,121
yeah.

643
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:04,571
From both,

644
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:05,404
I think.

645
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,300
But the media does not make you dumb,

646
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:07,900
right?

647
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,620
Oh yes it does.

648
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,280
Does it mean it makes
people incredibly skewed,

649
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,360
makes you dumb.

650
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,540
You can't watch CNN.

651
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,070
I don't watch that stuff.

652
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:15,761
But mean if you,

653
00:16:15,761 --> 00:16:16,870
did you think it would affect you?

654
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,071
Yeah,

655
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:19,620
but if I'm in a hotel room and I
watched that stuff for a couple of days,

656
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:20,720
I feel like I'm having a lobotomy.

657
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,400
Whoa.

658
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,200
Really?

659
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,360
Just CNN or you can just
see it as a program.

660
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:26,461
Things are,

661
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:27,190
um,

662
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:27,580
from my,

663
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,690
from my perspective,

664
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,280
they're basically,

665
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,460
I'm kind of holding
the mass consciousness,

666
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:37,590
the planetary consciousness at a certain
low level or low frequency where it's

667
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,990
passive consumerist fear based.

668
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:41,141
You know,

669
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:42,580
there's this violent activity,

670
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,930
very disjointed.

671
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:45,640
It creates a lot of
frustration and anxiety.

672
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:47,740
There's no deeper analysis.

673
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,620
There's no attempt to
create like a coherence,

674
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,440
you know,

675
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,210
understanding of what's happening.

676
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:52,830
And Yeah,

677
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:53,790
I could see your point.

678
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:58,791
That may be perhaps it isn't used to
its utmost abilities or the capabilities

679
00:16:58,861 --> 00:16:59,641
that we would have for it.

680
00:16:59,641 --> 00:17:00,890
But I don't think that it's,

681
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,170
it's not a good form of entertainment.

682
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:04,860
I don't,

683
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,540
I don't think it has to be either or.

684
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,800
I feel like you could sit home and watch
a fucking silly TV show and it doesn't

685
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:11,634
hurt you.

686
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:11,911
I mean,

687
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:16,680
I think this idea that we're helpless
to media constantly bombarding us with

688
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:18,690
these images and ideals and that we,

689
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,250
we have to accept them.

690
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,960
I think that's silly.

691
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:23,340
And I think that honestly,

692
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:24,151
with the Internet,

693
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:27,170
with you look at the society
that's growing out at the Internet,

694
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,070
look at like movements like anonymous,

695
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,420
look at Shit like this.

696
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:31,710
Things that have never happened before,

697
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:35,310
these giant groups moving forward.

698
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:35,981
And uh,

699
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:36,211
and,

700
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:36,351
and,

701
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:41,351
and taking down websites and taking down
companies that they feel have acted in

702
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:42,890
justly.

703
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,501
We didn't have,

704
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:45,630
no one's ever been able to do
something like that before.

705
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:46,560
And he at Stevie,

706
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:47,100
if you want it,

707
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,191
oh,

708
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,180
it's going to have some coffee.

709
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,520
Thanks.

710
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:48,960
Uh,

711
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,321
yeah.

712
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:49,471
Well,

713
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:49,980
I mean,

714
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,220
so,

715
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
so we have two things that will be,

716
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,800
a number of things are
happening simultaneously.

717
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:55,830
And that's another thing that's very
interesting about our time is that things

718
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:57,450
are getting pretty complicated right now.

719
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:01,050
One problem with television in general
is that it's designed to reduce

720
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:02,850
everything into tiny little soundbites.

721
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,181
You know,

722
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:03,340
when,

723
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:08,010
when Lincoln and Jefferson debated and
the 1860s the debates lasted eight hours.

724
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,640
You know,

725
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,870
when we have a debate on TV,

726
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:12,990
each person gets like 36
seconds for this response.

727
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:17,460
23 [inaudible] were basically used to
everything being spoonfed and dumbed down

728
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,500
to an absolute level of stupidity,

729
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,041
you know?

730
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,220
And basically the problem is that because
our scenario on the planet is very

731
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:24,450
complex at this point,

732
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,550
we actually need to be able to,

733
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,030
you know,

734
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,400
articulate and analyze
at a much deeper level,

735
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:29,760
you know?

736
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,151
So yes,

737
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,080
we have two things going on.

738
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,360
We have the one directional mass media,

739
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,510
which I really am convinced is basically
a kind of a la bottomy machine that

740
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:43,380
anesthetize people into an ultimate
state of idiocy and consumers passivity.

741
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,100
And then we have the development
of this new interactive media,

742
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,490
which is having profound effects and
will continue to have profound effects.

743
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:51,680
And if you go look at the history of the,

744
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,553
of media,

745
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,130
every time there's a new form
of media that's very powerful,

746
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,630
it transforms,

747
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,281
you know,

748
00:18:58,281 --> 00:18:58,461
the,

749
00:18:58,461 --> 00:18:58,660
the,

750
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,491
the society,

751
00:18:59,491 --> 00:19:00,690
the political system,

752
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:02,040
the government changes,

753
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:02,874
everything.

754
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,061
You know,

755
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:06,300
you could never ever had an empire until
you had a written code of laws that

756
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:08,850
could be distributed to
the borders and beyond.

757
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,230
You could never have had a,

758
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,410
a modern representational democracy,

759
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:13,591
you know,

760
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:16,230
nation state unless you
had the printing press,

761
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:17,640
which distributed enough,

762
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,360
you know,

763
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,400
materials that everybody
could participate in.

764
00:19:20,401 --> 00:19:21,420
Civic dialogues.

765
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,150
Now with this interactive
technology potentially points
towards a much deeper or

766
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:28,530
transition in our political
and social paradigm,

767
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,130
uh,

768
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:34,130
potentially towards a away
from centralized control
hierarchy to more of a kind

769
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:37,020
of a distributed or direct democracy

770
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,530
and interconnectedness as
human beings in general.

771
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,640
It's never,

772
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,960
no one's been this close to this many
people just through online communication.

773
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,350
No one has ever had that kind of an
influence before by such a wide variety of

774
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,430
people and ideas,

775
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:49,941
you know,

776
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:51,000
all come and watch,

777
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,830
look how incredibly knew it as.

778
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:52,970
I mean,

779
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,170
we're,

780
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,070
we're just adapting.

781
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:54,371
We're just,

782
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:54,731
we're just,

783
00:19:54,731 --> 00:19:56,290
we're just like treading water trying to,

784
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,370
trying to catch up with the,

785
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:58,270
with this forest that,

786
00:19:58,271 --> 00:19:58,451
that,

787
00:19:58,451 --> 00:19:59,530
that our culture has a,

788
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,061
has unleashed,

789
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:00,390
unleashed

790
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,901
and it's good.

791
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:01,560
Or is it no,

792
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,520
or is it also just,

793
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,450
is it as awesome?

794
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:03,811
Well,

795
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:04,561
if you love change,

796
00:20:04,561 --> 00:20:04,981
it's great.

797
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:06,180
I mean if you're somebody who had this,

798
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:07,200
you know Warner records,

799
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:08,490
you're probably scratching
your head at this point.

800
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,140
The most fascinating conversation.

801
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:10,261
Yeah,

802
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:10,800
right.

803
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,170
I had the most fascinating conversation
with a guy who was trying to say that

804
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,600
Google is bad and the idea of
the Internet search is bad.

805
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,081
I go,

806
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:16,500
why?

807
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:16,801
He goes,

808
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:17,630
because you know,

809
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,020
it used to be if you wanted knowledge,

810
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:20,040
I had to go look for it.

811
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:20,851
I was like,

812
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:21,121
wow,

813
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:23,510
that might be the craziest
fucking thing I've ever heard.

814
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,190
You think it should be hard to
find that shit and she'd be hard.

815
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,500
You'd have to go to a library
and look up the right bug.

816
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:29,310
It should take hours.

817
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:29,521
No,

818
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:30,950
you should be able to save your phone.

819
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,280
That's very much like
people would talk about,

820
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:32,730
oh,

821
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,930
you shouldn't take a psychedelic cause.

822
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:37,200
It's like a shortcut to the
mystical experience and of
course the answer to that

823
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:37,520
is like,

824
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,720
you know what's right with a shortcut.

825
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,930
If I'm trying to get somewhere,

826
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,250
am I going to go like all around like a
circuitous barring route or am I gonna

827
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,610
just take the frigging shortcut?

828
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,000
That reminds me of a joke.

829
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,010
Terence Mckenna used

830
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,000
to say that,

831
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:49,480
uh,

832
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,830
some guy practice a city of levitation
for 40 years and figured out,

833
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:56,530
finally had a float and he came
up to the Buddha and he said,

834
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:56,951
master,

835
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:58,420
I can walk across the water.

836
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,801
And the Buddhist said,

837
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,060
but the fairies only a nickel,

838
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,181
you know,

839
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:04,690
I mean,

840
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:05,800
take the fucking mushroom,

841
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:06,341
take a chance,

842
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:06,670
dude.

843
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,630
Take a take a shortcut.

844
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,561
Not only that,

845
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:13,561
the idea that you are independent from
nature and then you don't need some help

846
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,100
in any way mean you're constantly getting
help from nutrients and vitamins and

847
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:20,230
protein and all these different
things he absorbed through nature.

848
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,200
But then when it comes to this that you
think may or may not do something to

849
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:23,681
your mind,

850
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:24,010
you're not,

851
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:24,640
you're not,

852
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,230
I can get there naturally

853
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,870
back to the Google search.

854
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:29,021
I mean,

855
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:29,171
yeah,

856
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:29,321
I mean,

857
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:29,951
I think fat,

858
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:30,700
um,

859
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:30,941
you know,

860
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:31,121
the,

861
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:34,070
the fact that we now have so
much knowledge and information,

862
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:34,390
you know,

863
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,310
at her disposal is an extraordinary thing,

864
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:36,760
you know?

865
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,100
But then the question is
still how do we manage that?

866
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:40,990
What do we do with it and what type of,

867
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,193
you know,

868
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,670
society can we pull ourselves into?

869
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,310
Because at the moment what we have is,

870
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:48,730
is not going to last very much longer.

871
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,730
I liked what you said,

872
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,240
pull,

873
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,230
pull ourselves into,

874
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:51,891
because it's really,

875
00:21:51,891 --> 00:21:55,250
it's going to have to be that because
it's gonna you're gonna have to pull away

876
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,860
from the system that we have now that,

877
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:57,170
I mean,

878
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:01,070
especially the financial system and we've
learned from when Ron Paul wanted the

879
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:04,430
audits of the bail outs and people found
out how many trillions of dollars had

880
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:06,380
been sent into the,

881
00:22:06,381 --> 00:22:06,681
this,

882
00:22:06,681 --> 00:22:07,790
this whole idea of,

883
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:08,630
of bailouts and it,

884
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:09,680
where this tax dollars went.

885
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:14,720
I think a lot of people became really
disillusioned and disenfranchised and,

886
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,700
and it had no connection to it.

887
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,570
You know what I mean?

888
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:17,811
I mean,

889
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:17,991
when,

890
00:22:17,991 --> 00:22:18,201
when,

891
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:18,711
when it happened,

892
00:22:18,711 --> 00:22:22,250
did it make any sense to you when you
were hearing him about the bailouts at any

893
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:24,230
of that make any sense to
you and don't pay attention?

894
00:22:24,231 --> 00:22:24,521
It's like,

895
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:24,680
it's,

896
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,061
it seems,

897
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:26,780
it seems like a system you can't fix.

898
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,350
So it seems like I,

899
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:28,791
you know,

900
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:32,510
it almost feels like trying to go against
the machine that's currently in place

901
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,110
is,

902
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,711
it's so,

903
00:22:33,711 --> 00:22:34,850
it's so intangible.

904
00:22:34,851 --> 00:22:36,170
It's like so gigantic.

905
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,320
The financial system is completely and
utterly corrupt and unrecognizable.

906
00:22:41,511 --> 00:22:43,280
It's impossible to understand.

907
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:43,631
Right.

908
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:44,141
Well that's like,

909
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:46,990
I've been a bunch of the work I've
been doing over the last few years.

910
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:47,321
I mean,

911
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:47,461
uh,

912
00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:47,661
in the,

913
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:48,461
in the film,

914
00:22:48,461 --> 00:22:49,480
actually we interviewed you for the film.

915
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:50,590
We didn't end up using your interview.

916
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:51,730
We just couldn't somehow splice it.

917
00:22:51,731 --> 00:22:55,000
And I document online
in 2012 time for change.

918
00:22:55,001 --> 00:22:55,721
And we interviewed this guy,

919
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:56,141
Bernard,

920
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:56,974
Leah Tarr,

921
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,561
who was a,

922
00:22:57,561 --> 00:22:58,241
he's an economist.

923
00:22:58,241 --> 00:22:59,770
He was one of the architects of the euro.

924
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,810
You wrote a great book
called the future of money.

925
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,290
And in that book he,

926
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,561
he,

927
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:04,210
you know,

928
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,021
and in our film also,

929
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:08,050
we discussed how the financial system is
broken and it really doesn't matter at

930
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:11,380
this point who you put in control because
it's still just like a car with no

931
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:12,214
brakes.

932
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,160
But that actually we're
going to have to reinvent,

933
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:15,640
uh,

934
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,430
instruments for,

935
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:20,920
for exchanging value that actually
have fundamentally different,

936
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,200
different value systems connected to them.

937
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:24,281
So for instance,

938
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:27,940
he proposes a currency which he closes
the terror that has a negative interest

939
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:28,750
charge.

940
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,070
So it's a new trading currency,

941
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:34,300
big global trading currency that's
indexed not to just a virtual abstraction

942
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:35,230
like our money currently is,

943
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:40,231
but actually it's index to a basket
of real world goods and resources that

944
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:41,890
decline in value over time.

945
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:43,120
Cause most things do,

946
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:43,811
you know,

947
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:44,041
so,

948
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:46,430
so if the longer you held onto a terror,

949
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,840
the less it would be worth.

950
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,350
So instead of a gold standard,

951
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:51,840
it would be made based on a bunch of,

952
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:52,591
exactly.

953
00:23:52,591 --> 00:23:55,590
I'm a bundle of resources that
would include things cool.

954
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,180
And wheat and you know,

955
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:59,980
processed foods and
unprocessed goods and so on.

956
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,460
And,

957
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,001
and as,

958
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:01,241
as,

959
00:24:01,241 --> 00:24:01,490
as,

960
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:01,811
as,

961
00:24:01,811 --> 00:24:03,070
as a summation of all of that,

962
00:24:03,071 --> 00:24:03,221
it would,

963
00:24:03,221 --> 00:24:04,600
it would actually decline in value.

964
00:24:04,601 --> 00:24:06,460
It would have what's
called a demo Raj charge.

965
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,910
So when people got a bunch of these
terrorists through some business deal,

966
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,490
rather than seeking to hoard
them or hold on to them,

967
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,481
that wouldn't work.

968
00:24:13,481 --> 00:24:14,350
So they would eat best,

969
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:14,890
you know,

970
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,950
used by putting them back into
circulation by sharing them or,

971
00:24:17,951 --> 00:24:18,281
or,

972
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:19,114
or whatever.

973
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,571
So,

974
00:24:19,571 --> 00:24:19,971
so,

975
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:20,130
um,

976
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,900
that's Leotard is concept
and one of many concepts.

977
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:23,430
Uh,

978
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,650
we're actually publishing a book
through my company evolver called sacred

979
00:24:26,651 --> 00:24:28,450
economics by Charles Eisenstein.

980
00:24:28,451 --> 00:24:29,710
It's actually already up on,

981
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:29,850
uh,

982
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,990
it's out on the Internet
and you can get copies,

983
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,000
but he actually puts together a whole
paradigm looking at the inevitability of,

984
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:41,320
of the financial system breaking down
and really seeing that rather than just

985
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:43,290
having one monopoly of,

986
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:43,641
of a,

987
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:45,550
of a value exchanging instrument,

988
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,890
like money that's controlled
by private banking and trusts,

989
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,940
you could really create a whole ecology
of different ways of exchanging value

990
00:24:51,941 --> 00:24:53,590
that would be used for different purposes.

991
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,220
Do you think that the government would
ever allow something like that to

992
00:24:56,221 --> 00:24:57,031
actually take place?

993
00:24:57,031 --> 00:24:59,580
I mean it almost seems like trying to
create a government inside the government.

994
00:24:59,610 --> 00:24:59,701
Well,

995
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:02,620
I mean it's happened before I'm in for
instance in the Depression and they

996
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,380
reissued a lot of local currencies.

997
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:05,790
It has also done in the 19th century.

998
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:09,120
Obviously you know that about a town in
North Carolina or South Carolina that's

999
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:10,230
trying to do that right now.

1000
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:10,951
Exactly.

1001
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:11,721
Well I think that's,

1002
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:12,030
that's,

1003
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,940
that's definitely going to be on the
horizon because people are not going to be

1004
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:15,631
able to use this.

1005
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:15,820
This,

1006
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,230
there was a small town and they had their
own currency in his town and there was

1007
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:20,790
a debate about its legality.

1008
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,060
And in fact if you look at,

1009
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:23,331
um,

1010
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:27,320
the bankruptcy of the government and the
effects of a p Coyle and I'm all this

1011
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:28,220
other stuff going on,

1012
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:33,110
the capacity of the federal government
to intervene into metal may actually

1013
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:37,130
become radically reduced and the next
and the next years because there's just

1014
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:39,770
not going to be the money
available for that kind of endless,

1015
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,610
you know,

1016
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,443
um,

1017
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,433
effort.

1018
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,500
Damn I face is melting

1019
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,740
thinking about when you're saying,

1020
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:49,711
yeah.

1021
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:52,940
It was like just so much information
I'm thinking about right now.

1022
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:53,750
Well,

1023
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,583
you know,

1024
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,340
is it possible that none of this will
actually happen that will sort of stumble

1025
00:25:58,341 --> 00:25:59,150
into the finish line?

1026
00:25:59,150 --> 00:25:59,301
No,

1027
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:00,110
it's not possible.

1028
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,640
It's not.

1029
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,700
It's absolutely not possible.

1030
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:06,580
So you think it's absolutely 100% that
the society that we currently enjoy is

1031
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,190
going to collapse?

1032
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,860
Absolutely.

1033
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,693
100%.

1034
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,520
What kind of timeframe
are you to have in it?

1035
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,080
Uh,

1036
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,830
you know,

1037
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,930
could be a year,

1038
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,170
could be 10 or 15 years.

1039
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,651
Uh,

1040
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:14,860
but,

1041
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,630
but the point is to recognize that,

1042
00:26:16,631 --> 00:26:16,901
you know,

1043
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:17,051
we're,

1044
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:17,741
we're in it now.

1045
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:18,061
I mean that,

1046
00:26:18,061 --> 00:26:18,251
that,

1047
00:26:18,251 --> 00:26:18,461
you know,

1048
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:18,671
our,

1049
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:20,170
our faith in capitalism,

1050
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,860
capitalism is a system that has
an inherent unstability to it.

1051
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,060
And basically what it requires
is constantly new markets
that need to be turned

1052
00:26:28,061 --> 00:26:30,640
into money so you can keep the
dynamics of now you can wait,

1053
00:26:30,641 --> 00:26:33,160
you can keep the debt growing and
you keep extending the credit.

1054
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:33,951
But we,

1055
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:34,211
we,

1056
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:34,391
you know,

1057
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:38,050
but what I think what we're going to
realize soon enough is that capitalism was

1058
00:26:38,051 --> 00:26:39,190
not a final system.

1059
00:26:39,191 --> 00:26:40,600
It was a transitional system.

1060
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,700
We don't know what that
transition is into yet,

1061
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,090
but is like an adolescent in system.

1062
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:46,260
It's like aggressive,

1063
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:47,190
compulsive,

1064
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:48,150
competitive,

1065
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:48,361
you know,

1066
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:49,001
at a certain point.

1067
00:26:49,001 --> 00:26:53,040
And you'd have to shift into maturity
and adulthood and you have to let go of

1068
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:55,470
some of that adolescent compulsion.

1069
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,200
How important is psychedelics
in this equation?

1070
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,360
Because the best tool,

1071
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:01,320
in my opinion,

1072
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:03,750
to sort of calm down that those instincts,

1073
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:08,100
those competitive super hyper
aggressive instincts is psychedelics.

1074
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:08,934
And it's,

1075
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,530
we try most illegal things.

1076
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:11,380
No,

1077
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,000
I think that really helps.

1078
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,580
It's awesome.

1079
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,590
It's funny because it makes
me violent when I watch it.

1080
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,310
Really?

1081
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,440
Why it's so fun.

1082
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,630
So I think that psychedelics
have tremendous value.

1083
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:21,920
I mean,

1084
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,680
but you know,

1085
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,540
people always say that I'm
an advocate of psychedelics.

1086
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:26,160
And I suppose that's
true to a certain extent.

1087
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:27,870
But I also feel that it's
an individual decision.

1088
00:27:27,871 --> 00:27:28,860
They're not for everybody.

1089
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:31,200
And obviously there's still illegal
and frowned upon in our society.

1090
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,790
Right.

1091
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,010
But,

1092
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,250
but the fact is that one of the
values of psychedelics is they kind of

1093
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:38,760
decondition you from your present
state of consciousness and your,

1094
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,610
and your kind of social
ideology and belief system.

1095
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,031
You know,

1096
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:43,880
there's a kind of peeling away when,

1097
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,630
I remember the first
time I took mushrooms,

1098
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,380
one of the first experiences I had was
going to a deli and buying something with

1099
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:54,000
money and just finding it
totally ludicrous that our
culture invested so much

1100
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:57,600
belief and these wrinkly
brown ugly pieces of paper,

1101
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,090
you know,

1102
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,560
and that everybody was kind
of so disconnected from
their present experience and

1103
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:06,270
focused on the sports or the stock ticker
or all this crap and for my opinion,

1104
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:06,871
you know,

1105
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:07,081
so,

1106
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:07,321
so,

1107
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:12,321
so I think that peeling away back to a
kind of phenomenological as they say,

1108
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:14,400
level of just presence of being,

1109
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:14,880
that's,

1110
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,290
that's a very powerful thing.

1111
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,250
And we tend,

1112
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,440
as humans,

1113
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,300
it's very easy for us to get lost in,

1114
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:20,640
in,

1115
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,500
in abstractions and concepts.

1116
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,810
And we take her and we then
we believe in our concepts.

1117
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:26,400
We think that they're real,

1118
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:26,790
you know,

1119
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,780
so the psychedelics can,

1120
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:28,770
can break that,

1121
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:29,110
um,

1122
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,331
that,

1123
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:32,430
that investment we've made and all
these things that we think are real,

1124
00:28:32,431 --> 00:28:34,080
that are just abstractions and concepts.

1125
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:38,870
Does it have to be either or can you
enjoy a good movie and still be a person

1126
00:28:38,871 --> 00:28:43,871
who believes that we're evolving as
a consciousness and that we are in an

1127
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:47,720
adolescent state of evolution and somehow
or another we're in a transitionary

1128
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:48,620
period and we're all coming at Kipp,

1129
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,960
but can't you just enjoy the x men?

1130
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,550
I actually thought I love the x men movies
or just tell him and tell him what's

1131
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:55,701
called.

1132
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:56,241
Movies are cool,

1133
00:28:56,241 --> 00:28:57,074
but TV's not.

1134
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,060
Do you ever see walking dead?

1135
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,260
It's pretty fucking good show man.

1136
00:29:00,261 --> 00:29:02,720
There's zombies and these
people trying to survive.

1137
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,770
It's fucking fun.

1138
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:07,970
Sometimes I like to sit in
front of something and watch
some shit that somebody

1139
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:09,740
created that's supposed
to been an entertain me.

1140
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:14,980
I don't think it has to cut your capacity
for thinking and reason and logic and

1141
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:16,454
original thought.

1142
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,450
I don't think it has to.

1143
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,220
I think you could just be fun to watch.

1144
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,040
I think a lot of people
are conditioned by,

1145
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:22,970
a lot of people are weak,

1146
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,000
but a lot of people fucking eat
cheeseburgers all day and become 700.

1147
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,040
I mean,

1148
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,321
you know,

1149
00:29:27,321 --> 00:29:27,760
I,

1150
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,940
I'm not like in a,

1151
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,301
you know,

1152
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:29,531
I don't,

1153
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:31,670
I don't judge you enjoy
whatever you want to enjoy.

1154
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:32,361
I don't really care.

1155
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:32,571
I mean,

1156
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:33,500
I'm personally,

1157
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:33,980
you know,

1158
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,761
what I like are,

1159
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:35,530
are kind of,

1160
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:38,570
when I get excited now
about popular narratives,

1161
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:38,950
it's,

1162
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:43,480
it's more because I see in them the seeds
of part of this transformation that's

1163
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,500
underway now.

1164
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:44,921
For instance,

1165
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:49,870
if you look at like a lot of the most
archetypally huge stories that our culture

1166
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,860
keeps telling us,

1167
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,300
which includes the mutant,

1168
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:52,421
you know,

1169
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:53,380
the x man,

1170
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,730
Harry Potter,

1171
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:54,940
you know,

1172
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,560
Lord of the Ring [inaudible]
for a certain extent.

1173
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:56,720
But,

1174
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,250
um,

1175
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,031
Star Wars,

1176
00:29:58,031 --> 00:30:02,020
let's say avatar destroy that's repeated
over and over again is there's like

1177
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:03,160
this hero's journey.

1178
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,630
And as part of that hero's journey,

1179
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:08,800
there has to be a learning
to use our psychic faculties,

1180
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,401
you know,

1181
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:09,671
so,

1182
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:10,091
so,

1183
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:10,730
you know,

1184
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,030
uh,

1185
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,820
the matrix,

1186
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,220
you,

1187
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:12,460
those,

1188
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,293
we're all superheroes,

1189
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,163
dude.

1190
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:14,531
Yeah.

1191
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:14,811
So,

1192
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:16,660
so if you look at a Mutans,

1193
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:17,770
they're going to this academy.

1194
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:19,270
They have to learn how
to master these power,

1195
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:19,991
normal gifts.

1196
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:20,171
You know,

1197
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:20,831
Harry Potter,

1198
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:22,540
you have to learn to cast your spells,

1199
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,321
Star Wars,

1200
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,580
you have to use the force.

1201
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,031
You know,

1202
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:25,631
I actually,

1203
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:28,510
the more that I've thought about it and
the more my own experiences have kind of

1204
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:29,890
echoed some of these things,

1205
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,490
I think that these stories are,

1206
00:30:31,491 --> 00:30:31,671
are,

1207
00:30:31,671 --> 00:30:36,671
are so powerful because they represent
a kind of yearning that people have for

1208
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:39,700
kind of initiatory training
and extra sensory perception.

1209
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,260
And that is something that our
society has rigorously denied us.

1210
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:44,810
You know?

1211
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,900
And I think if you look at like what
happens to you when you're like an

1212
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:47,471
adolescent,

1213
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,450
like let's say you're a 1520 years old,

1214
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:49,841
you know,

1215
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:50,350
you have this,

1216
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:50,590
you,

1217
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:53,560
you have this beginning and when you're
young teenager you have this tremendous

1218
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:55,300
sense of expectation.

1219
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,620
You're like waiting for
some transformative thing
to happen to you and then it

1220
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:00,580
doesn't happen.

1221
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,790
And so instead you accept
a lot of basically crappy,

1222
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:06,880
degraded substitutes like
dulling entertainment.

1223
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:07,211
Like,

1224
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:07,511
you know,

1225
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:10,480
watching athletes do this
and that or whatever,

1226
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:10,841
you know,

1227
00:31:10,841 --> 00:31:15,370
rather than having gone through something
that you always just know is missing

1228
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:15,701
but that,

1229
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:17,740
but then the culture kind
of like hides it from you.

1230
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,370
And I think that that thing that that's
missing from our culture is this direct

1231
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,020
initiatory process.

1232
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,030
How was the culture
hiding it from you though?

1233
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,421
I,

1234
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:25,871
you know,

1235
00:31:25,871 --> 00:31:27,070
I think the culture,

1236
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:30,130
the water sort of seeks its own level
and a lot of these things and a lot of

1237
00:31:30,131 --> 00:31:32,170
people just get lazy
and don't look for it.

1238
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:34,420
And this culture that's
opening up right now,

1239
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,340
experiences now or being detailed and
talked about that people could never

1240
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:44,290
understand before the connection that
people have together through the Internet

1241
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:45,400
now it's,

1242
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:45,690
there's,

1243
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,440
there's never been
anything like this before.

1244
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:47,891
You know,

1245
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:48,291
I don't,

1246
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:50,110
I don't think it's getting dumber.

1247
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:52,210
I think there's always gonna be
a certain amount of dumb people.

1248
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,380
I think there's always
going to be a certain lot of
people who smoke cigarettes.

1249
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:54,610
Totally.

1250
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:54,730
Well,

1251
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,070
I think we,

1252
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,110
I just stopped actually recently,

1253
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:56,900
which was very exciting.

1254
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,250
Really.

1255
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,270
You smoked cigarettes?

1256
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,141
Pathetic.

1257
00:31:59,141 --> 00:31:59,974
Wow.

1258
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,000
Just for smart guy.

1259
00:32:02,001 --> 00:32:02,260
No,

1260
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,501
I know.

1261
00:32:02,501 --> 00:32:02,800
I know.

1262
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,940
What the fuck is that?

1263
00:32:03,941 --> 00:32:04,390
You know,

1264
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:04,990
I apologize.

1265
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,470
That's ruthless it

1266
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:08,890
bro.

1267
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:09,723
I swear to

1268
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:14,650
fuck with you because I love you because
[inaudible] actually it was through

1269
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:16,460
Iowasca that I stopped
actually was through.

1270
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,980
I lost what I started also to be honest,

1271
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:20,740
cause there's a whole relationship between
Iowasca shamanism and the Amazon and

1272
00:32:20,741 --> 00:32:21,574
tobacco.

1273
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,750
That's when I first started smoking.

1274
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,010
It was low tobacco on you,

1275
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:24,250
right?

1276
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:24,761
They do.

1277
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:25,271
And it's also,

1278
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:28,060
there's something about the tobacco
and Iowasca that are very synergetic

1279
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:28,391
together.

1280
00:32:28,391 --> 00:32:29,200
I mean it's a,

1281
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,411
you know,

1282
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:32,710
tobacco is considered a
very important power plant.

1283
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,840
Why didn't you first,

1284
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,140
why didn't you try cigars?

1285
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,550
We can get natural tobacco.

1286
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:37,901
Tobacco,

1287
00:32:37,901 --> 00:32:38,350
I tried.

1288
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,660
The guards are way function.

1289
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:40,040
I mean

1290
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,810
they're probably not
the best thing for you,

1291
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:43,310
but they're better for
you than cigarettes.

1292
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:43,670
Yeah,

1293
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,090
isn't it?

1294
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:48,110
It's all the chemicals in cigarettes
that are natural American spirits.

1295
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:49,500
I mean I stayed at least at that level.

1296
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,830
It seems like it hurts me more though.

1297
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:53,440
Like when I do natural spirits it's,

1298
00:32:53,441 --> 00:32:55,100
it's like the next day
I'm coughing up black.

1299
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:58,300
It's cause it's not giving you
any numbing powers like slick car.

1300
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:03,340
There's 590 fucking ingredients in
cigarettes that by the way usually made

1301
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,020
government approved or did anybody really

1302
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,530
go over all those 590 you know a lobbyist,

1303
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,320
right?

1304
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,280
You know who the fuck went over all those
ingredients and made sure that they're

1305
00:33:13,281 --> 00:33:13,920
all cool.

1306
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,240
People are dying half a million
a year in America alone.

1307
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:19,400
Directly related to cigarette smoking.

1308
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,191
What you were saying?

1309
00:33:20,191 --> 00:33:20,460
No,

1310
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,570
a lot of people probably,

1311
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,170
I think also feel like they did
accomplish what they wanted in life.

1312
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,831
Like I think that's,

1313
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:30,030
it seems like it seems almost a negative
that you say it like that because I

1314
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:30,721
talked to my dad,

1315
00:33:30,721 --> 00:33:30,991
he's like,

1316
00:33:30,991 --> 00:33:31,620
fuck yeah,

1317
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,570
this is exactly what I
wanted to do with my life.

1318
00:33:33,571 --> 00:33:34,560
I had loved my life.

1319
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:36,150
I'm happy I'm married.

1320
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:36,891
I know they'll do it.

1321
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:38,070
Don't you think your Dad's pretty smart?

1322
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,390
I think.

1323
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:39,780
I mean,

1324
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,300
unless I think that's
just a negative look.

1325
00:33:42,301 --> 00:33:43,800
I think a lot of people like what they do.

1326
00:33:43,801 --> 00:33:44,011
I mean,

1327
00:33:44,011 --> 00:33:45,810
you're going to definitely a job though.

1328
00:33:45,811 --> 00:33:47,970
You've got an easy job at all.

1329
00:33:47,971 --> 00:33:48,960
I'm not talking about me at all.

1330
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:50,400
I'm talking about like my mom,

1331
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,270
my dad,

1332
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:51,600
Mike,

1333
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,040
Everyone I grew up around with,

1334
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,720
they all liked what they did.

1335
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:59,410
Well you might've been lucky and you grew
up in the Midwest and I'm offering you

1336
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,020
is like,

1337
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,200
you know my way of thinking about it.

1338
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:01,640
Yeah.

1339
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,490
I think he might be your friend.

1340
00:34:02,491 --> 00:34:03,324
No,

1341
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,120
my personal experience
growing up was like,

1342
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:06,660
you know,

1343
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,141
I fought,

1344
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:09,570
there would be this amazing
thing that would happen.

1345
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,613
Right.

1346
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:11,290
Have

1347
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:11,861
those things,

1348
00:34:11,861 --> 00:34:12,071
man.

1349
00:34:12,071 --> 00:34:12,910
You gotta you know,

1350
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,330
I,

1351
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,260
I've always said that there should be
some sort of a right of right of manhood

1352
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,123
or right.

1353
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,970
It doesn't have to be even a man who'd
thing attached to like something manly or

1354
00:34:21,971 --> 00:34:22,750
aggressive.

1355
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,171
I mean,

1356
00:34:23,171 --> 00:34:25,150
as to finding your character,

1357
00:34:25,151 --> 00:34:26,320
finding your limitations,

1358
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:27,490
doing something extraordinary.

1359
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:27,621
Yeah.

1360
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:27,791
Well,

1361
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:28,150
I mean,

1362
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:28,810
you know,

1363
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,320
some of the thinkers that I wrote about
in my books talked about how cultures

1364
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:36,490
need to have some type of initiatory
ritual and if they don't have it

1365
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,170
consciously constructed,

1366
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,480
it'll end up being unconsciously,

1367
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:40,781
you know,

1368
00:34:40,781 --> 00:34:41,530
destructive.

1369
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,970
It'll happen through war or
through destruction of the
environment or something.

1370
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,361
So,

1371
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:46,781
so one,

1372
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:48,820
one theory that I have about the,

1373
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:49,031
you know,

1374
00:34:49,031 --> 00:34:52,840
quote unquote 2012 or this transition
that we're in is that it's almost on an

1375
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,160
unconscious level.

1376
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:54,581
You know,

1377
00:34:54,581 --> 00:34:56,590
humanity has not been able
to change its behavior,

1378
00:34:56,591 --> 00:34:56,830
right?

1379
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,081
So it's,

1380
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:58,810
it's like it's on an unconscious level.

1381
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:03,250
We're kind of willing ourselves into a
state of catastrophe to bring about an

1382
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:06,610
initiation and thereby a
transformation of consciousness.

1383
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,180
100% sure of that,

1384
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,410
that 94% that's strong,

1385
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:13,691
man.

1386
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:14,590
That's very strong.

1387
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,520
Those are strong words.

1388
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,440
Who knows what the fuck
is going to happen?

1389
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:21,610
That's what I say I say could be some
sort of a meteor impact or it could be

1390
00:35:21,611 --> 00:35:23,050
some sort of a sky net thing.

1391
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,900
I do believe that something
is absolutely going to happen.

1392
00:35:25,901 --> 00:35:30,370
It's just seems to me that things are
moving at such a furious pace that it just

1393
00:35:30,371 --> 00:35:31,420
can't last.

1394
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,670
And I think it's a natural cycle,

1395
00:35:33,671 --> 00:35:33,970
man.

1396
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,571
I really do.

1397
00:35:34,571 --> 00:35:37,210
I think the reason why we're
having all these natural disasters,

1398
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,850
that's a part of a natural cycle too.

1399
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:39,081
Yeah.

1400
00:35:39,081 --> 00:35:42,680
But if you talk to my grandpa
grandfather about TVs will take it.

1401
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:43,461
Like he was like,

1402
00:35:43,461 --> 00:35:43,731
wow,

1403
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:44,501
this is crazy.

1404
00:35:44,501 --> 00:35:45,470
Who TV was invented.

1405
00:35:45,471 --> 00:35:46,580
You can see TV were,

1406
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:47,350
you know it's,

1407
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:47,961
they probably,

1408
00:35:47,961 --> 00:35:51,410
it's just us living our life and then
during around a certain age where we grow

1409
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:52,820
up to a certain point where we're like,

1410
00:35:52,821 --> 00:35:53,031
yeah,

1411
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:54,620
it's fucking spinning out of control.

1412
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,710
That is back in the forties it's probably
like Charlie Chaplin thought it was

1413
00:35:57,711 --> 00:35:58,360
spinning out of

1414
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,380
that is possible,

1415
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,870
but it also could be that human beings,

1416
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,500
even though we love to think of ourselves
as being separate from all the other

1417
00:36:05,501 --> 00:36:06,580
things in this world,

1418
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:11,820
we are a natural thing and even though
we have plastic fucking cars and glass

1419
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:16,020
lenses for fucking cell phones even,

1420
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:20,830
we are still a natural thing and we are
subject to the natural cycles of this

1421
00:36:20,831 --> 00:36:21,131
earth,

1422
00:36:21,131 --> 00:36:23,770
of this super organism
of the universe itself.

1423
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:26,800
And even when we see crazy
weather patterns and wild,

1424
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:27,520
crazy shit,

1425
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,960
there could easily also be crazy
cultural patterns and that culture,

1426
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,900
even though we can create it
and we do have control of it,

1427
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:39,820
it may be very well a natural movement
as natural as your evolution from baby to

1428
00:36:39,821 --> 00:36:40,654
adulthood.

1429
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,800
It could be a natural,

1430
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,450
it could be what we've published.

1431
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,284
Some uh,

1432
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:45,491
could,

1433
00:36:45,491 --> 00:36:46,020
we will be,

1434
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,380
make me want to fucking choke of it.

1435
00:36:47,381 --> 00:36:48,214
That's a good one.

1436
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:49,723
On the West Mag,

1437
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,770
it's a shirt at web magazine that I
run reality Sandwich and we've been

1438
00:36:53,771 --> 00:36:56,080
publishing some excerpt which
is not mac friendly by the way.

1439
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:56,771
I want you to know that.

1440
00:36:56,771 --> 00:36:58,900
I don't know if you know
that both of these computers,

1441
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:03,100
I tried to go to your website today and
just search my name obviously first,

1442
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:06,400
but then Joe Rogan's name and
both of them kept on crashing.

1443
00:37:06,401 --> 00:37:07,950
My browser crashed my browser.

1444
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,200
No,

1445
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,033
I've never had that problem.

1446
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,330
I don't really know Google chrome.

1447
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:10,940
Check it out.

1448
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,620
Just one of those old
Max with a track ball.

1449
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:12,921
No.

1450
00:37:12,921 --> 00:37:16,130
I used to new Mac track balls anyway,

1451
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,110
published a few pieces
by a German scientists.

1452
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:18,920
I did our brows,

1453
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,580
wrote a book called Revolution 2012 and
he's one of a bunch of people who are

1454
00:37:22,581 --> 00:37:24,320
arguing that a lot of what's happening,

1455
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:28,220
it has to do with changes that are
taking place throughout the whole solar

1456
00:37:28,221 --> 00:37:29,980
system to have to do
with the sun changing it.

1457
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:33,530
Actually the electromagnetic environment
of the earth is shifting what is

1458
00:37:33,531 --> 00:37:37,250
supposed to be a galactic
alignment on December 21st,

1459
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,390
2012 because I've heard Neil Tyson
who I very much respect who is that?

1460
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,150
Who it,

1461
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,983
he's a scientist,

1462
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,580
a very famous internet
scientist that sign,

1463
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,550
I shouldn't say gain wrestler.

1464
00:37:46,551 --> 00:37:47,270
He's a fucking,

1465
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,820
he's a scholar of a very well respected,

1466
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,640
I believe he's an astrophysicist
or something along those lines,

1467
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,481
but super,

1468
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:54,530
super brilliant guy.

1469
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,390
He Poo pooed that there was
any alignment whatsoever.

1470
00:37:56,391 --> 00:37:57,530
You said it's a constant thing.

1471
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,120
That alignment,

1472
00:37:59,121 --> 00:38:00,650
that same alignment happens all the time.

1473
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,080
He's like,

1474
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,360
you know,

1475
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,220
the fact that everyone's
making it out to December 21st,

1476
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,770
2012 was the first time that
has happened in 25,000 years.

1477
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,041
He's like,

1478
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:07,874
that's nonsense.

1479
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,403
And he's,

1480
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,530
I believe he knows more than I do,

1481
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,890
probably know for sure.

1482
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:14,010
So,

1483
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:14,300
I mean,

1484
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,360
I can just give you my little meditation.

1485
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:16,761
I mean,

1486
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:17,594
um,

1487
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,270
my understanding is that it's
simply an obstacle alignment,

1488
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:20,571
which,

1489
00:38:20,571 --> 00:38:23,510
which means there's no particular reason
that we would know of that would be

1490
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:24,344
such a tremendous,

1491
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:29,410
tremendous transformative thing where
the winter solstice sun rises within the

1492
00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:31,280
dark rift at the center of the Milky Way.

1493
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,500
So in a sense,

1494
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,410
it's an eclipse of the center
of the Milky Way by the,

1495
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,740
by the sun on the winter
solstice on that particular date.

1496
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,140
So,

1497
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,140
so that date had a lot
of significance for them.

1498
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:45,610
It was like the key moment in the year
and they considered the son to be the

1499
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:49,000
first father and they saw the dark rift
at the center of the Milky Way as the

1500
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:49,990
cosmic mother,

1501
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:52,120
or they also called it
apparently a black hole.

1502
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,420
Which is interesting because only in the
last like 15 years that are astronomers

1503
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:58,450
discover there is a huge black
hole to center of the Milky Way.

1504
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,960
Also know that there's actually a
supermassive black hole and his son are of

1505
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:02,950
every single galaxy,

1506
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,670
and that that supermassive black hole
is one half of 1% of a mass of every

1507
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:07,360
galaxy.

1508
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,950
So if you have a giant galaxy,

1509
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:10,180
it's a much bigger black hole.

1510
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,420
And they even have the first photograph
they've ever taken of a black hole

1511
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,590
eating a black hole.

1512
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,450
It's fucking crazy.
