00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,770
Hello Freak bitches.
One of the main things,

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:09,771
I think that my advice would be,
it's a lot easier to focus on what you

3
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:15,441
should eat then on what you shouldn't.
And I think that an more inclusionary

4
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:17,460
diet is,
is key.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,180
So focusing on what your body needs,
you know,

6
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:25,410
not only for short term but what it
needs for long term focus on that more

7
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:26,750
than yeah,
because,

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,850
because it's just,
first of all,

9
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:31,710
if you focus on what you're limiting
from your diet,

10
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:34,020
then you're not going to be getting all
the good stuff that you need.

11
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,150
That's part of the talking a lot about
loss.

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,640
You're also thinking,
it's just like,

13
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:42,630
it's so there's too many little,
it's easy to become caught up in a lot

14
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:43,830
of minutia.
Um,

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,010
and I know this because I've been there.
Uh,

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,960
and so,
you know,

17
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:50,670
getting caught up in all this little
minutia,

18
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:53,400
you know,
it can take you forever to try to figure

19
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,480
out what's going on.

20
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,360
And then in the meantime you're getting
distracted from the important thing is

21
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:58,440
not as what you need.
You know,

22
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:01,080
your body,
your body is very resilient.

23
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:04,590
And if you feed it what it needs,
you can fight off stuff.

24
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,210
You're going to,
you're going to age better.

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,580
You know,
all these little chemical reactions and

26
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:10,920
enzymatic reactions going on in all your
cells,

27
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,570
in your liver and your kidney and your
brain.

28
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:14,790
All these things are going to keep
happening because you're feeding it.

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,770
And when you have a little bit of toxic
stuff,

30
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,470
guess what?
All of these pathways are ready because

31
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:21,270
they're so,
they're getting nourished,

32
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:23,370
are getting what they need that they
activate in the,

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,790
your body has protective mechanisms to
make sure it doesn't get cancered.

34
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,100
You know,
I explained that when you make reactive

35
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:32,100
oxygen species,
you can repair it or you can do the cell

36
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:32,430
will die.

37
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,850
But all those,
all those repair a stress response

38
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:38,280
mechanisms,
they require that,

39
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:39,090
you know,
you're,

40
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,920
you're giving yourselves what they need
to do that.

41
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:43,710
So if you're so focused on what not to
eat,

42
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:45,420
that you're not getting enough of what
you need,

43
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,610
then your body is,
you know,

44
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,280
capacity to do that isn't going to be as
optimal.

45
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,310
So I really like,
I really think it's easier,

46
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,270
especially for people that don't have a
scientific background that don't have

47
00:01:57,271 --> 00:02:00,210
time.
I mean because it takes a lot of time to

48
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:03,210
sit there and read through all the
scientific ses and figuring out what's

49
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:05,070
going on,
all the complex interactions,

50
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,640
you know,
I barely have time to do that and it's

51
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,490
like I do this every day.
Like I do research every day and on top

52
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:13,470
of that,
in my spare time I do and it's still

53
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,170
overwhelming and I still can only get so
much done.

54
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,580
Didn't you have like plans on being some
sort of a marine biologist or something?

55
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:23,280
At some point?
I tell people that story because this is

56
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:25,950
funny.
On twitter I found this rock,

57
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:29,670
my daughter found this rock on the beach
in Santa Barbara and had all these holes

58
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:32,340
in it and we're trying to figure out
what the fuck it was was an asteroid or

59
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:33,300
something.
I put on twitter,

60
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:36,630
I go,
what's this rock Joe fucking Perry is

61
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:40,200
the first guy to answer me on twitter
and tells me it's a see stone.

62
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,980
Like these animals had like burrowed
into this stone and created a little

63
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:48,590
homes really well
told me.

64
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,170
Well anyway,
listen,

65
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,860
I love the ocean and it captured me from
the very beginning.

66
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,723
I mean,
I love,

67
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,190
I love

68
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,070
Jacques Cousteau and watching those,
those specials and I got to see,

69
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,740
seems speak a couple of times in Boston
and I just was,

70
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,120
uh,
that's what I wanted to be.

71
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,020
I want it to be.
I W I went to woods hole and you know,

72
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,350
visited there and,
and uh,

73
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,600
uh,
and I,

74
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,030
and I thought that's what I wanted to do
was be a marine biologist and uh,

75
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,120
you know,
and the whole learning disability thing,

76
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,420
um,
which they didn't know what to call it

77
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:31,150
back then except the discipline thing,
you know what I mean?

78
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,920
I wasn't studying hard enough.
Well,

79
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,320
I wanted to,
wanted to get good grades.

80
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:37,030
They studied as hard as I could.
I mean,

81
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:38,620
it looked at the page,
read it,

82
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,070
nothing's stuck.
And this lexicon couldn't get grades.

83
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,090
Now it's like a Adhd,
I guess they call it down.

84
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,380
And,
uh,

85
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,060
and that's where,
uh,

86
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,170
they have different ways to teach kids
now and it doesn't involve,

87
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,300
you know,
like taking some pills.

88
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,820
I mean there's just different ways of
teaching that,

89
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,640
that work and they just didn't have it
back then.

90
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,930
What would you say to one though?
Like say if someone came along like some

91
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:05,190
15 year old kid says,
Hey,

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm a huge UFC fan.
I want to fight in MMA.

93
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,870
Uh,
how should I get started?

94
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,240
I would have him pick one discipline to
start.

95
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:14,340
If you're 15 years old,
go wrestle.

96
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,590
If he,
if you are more drawn to boxing or

97
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,110
kickboxing and then go do that along the
way.

98
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,340
Play and experiment a little bit.
But athlete development is changing now.

99
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:26,310
There's this,
this trend for when kids are as young as

100
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:28,280
five,
six years old that there's these an

101
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:31,170
intensive training program.
She had larger cities where there's good

102
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,870
resource,
good coaching and good facilities.

103
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:37,380
They take these kids from an early age,
maybe they train them football or

104
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:40,500
basketball or hockey,
something like this with the intent of

105
00:04:40,501 --> 00:04:41,850
development professional athletes.

106
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,840
This approaches almost producing zero
professional athletes.

107
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,350
The ones who are successful are the ones
who played three or four sports growing

108
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:53,640
up and then they get to a certain age
and then they start narrowing in and

109
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,310
kind of defining the best way to be.
What are they going to do?

110
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,350
The Australians did it before the
Olympics in 2000 they started to take it

111
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:02,280
a whole bunch of metrics on their
athletes finding,

112
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,900
okay,
you're not good enough to win a metal

113
00:05:03,901 --> 00:05:05,580
here.
Have you thought about this,

114
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:06,960
try this.
And as a result,

115
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:09,810
the Ozzies,
they've won national governing body for

116
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,630
um,
for their Olympic sports development as

117
00:05:12,631 --> 00:05:14,670
their assault.
They did 10 times per capita.

118
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,870
The man of metals at the u s did in
2012,

119
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,000
um,
in,

120
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,150
in the UK they did the same thing.
They took it a little bit further as

121
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:28,320
example of one woman who was good,
I think she was some type of distance

122
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:29,190
runner or something.

123
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,320
They'd all sorts of measurements like
the,

124
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,070
the wrist to elbow measurement.
And this is more technical than than I

125
00:05:35,071 --> 00:05:36,170
know,
but they found,

126
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,920
she had the certain measurement in here
and said,

127
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,330
okay,
you're not going to win a medal in this.

128
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:40,980
Have you ever considered rowing?
She goes,

129
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:42,840
I've never done road.
Three years later,

130
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:44,610
she was an Olympic champion.
Watts.

131
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,800
Yeah.
You could be an Olympic rowing champion

132
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:48,660
in three years,
but think about if you are already a

133
00:05:48,661 --> 00:05:52,470
well trained athlete for something else,
it involved that type of cardiovascular

134
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:55,980
stuff.
I have this specific biomechanics that

135
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,920
fits.
So if you know those biomechanics,

136
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,870
sorry,
you know what to look for in an athlete,

137
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,530
you can steer them in this direction.
The UK did great with metal count.

138
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,120
That's amazing.
