1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,750
I'm tweeting and

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,160
doing this at the same time.

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,450
I just don't feel rushed.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,650
It smells when you tweets,

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,143
what?

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,500
It really stinks when you do that.

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,160
How do you wait?

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,993
In what way?

9
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,290
Your fingers smell

10
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,530
the magic finger.

11
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,341
Do you have stinky feet?

12
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:21,060
Sometimes,

13
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,421
but no,

14
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,590
my fingers never stink.

15
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,850
But that would be the weirdest thing,

16
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:24,001
man.

17
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,300
If your fucking fingers stunk,

18
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,930
that would be like a major deal breaker.

19
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:28,830
It's kind of weird.

20
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,560
You've definitely been with a vagina
that smells like an arm pay before,

21
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:32,010
right?

22
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:32,330
Um,

23
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,390
you have some girls don't smell
that really touched my vagina.

24
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:35,250
Smelling and armpit.

25
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,110
You like that be oh,

26
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:38,310
smells sounds great.

27
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:38,730
Yeah.

28
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,770
The Joe Rogan experience is
brought to you by the fleshlight.

29
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:43,220
Speaking of Pussy here,

30
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,510
who would you consider it

31
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,180
getting a fleshlight model of your
vagina if they offered you a tidy sum,

32
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,610
I would do it for 15
minutes at at the Improv.

33
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,731
I can't do that.

34
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:57,160
Let's go to Joe rogan.net.

35
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,450
Click on the link for the flashlight.

36
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,570
Linda the code name Rogan,

37
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,840
and you'll save yourself 15% of
the number one sex toy from my,

38
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,190
it's a fucking solid product.

39
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:05,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

40
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,391
I'll tell you why.

41
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:07,930
There's nothing will ever
say we're in the middle of,

42
00:01:07,931 --> 00:01:08,360
uh,

43
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,500
taken out some new sponsors.

44
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,070
There's nothing will ever sell on
the show that we don't believe in it.

45
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,990
And that's something I believe,

46
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,640
start sowing the improv.com then Joe,

47
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,050
because that is the best comedy club ever
in a 15 minute spot for Amy Schumer to

48
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:21,190
become a fleshlight mold.

49
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:22,570
Sounds like an awesome idea.

50
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:22,871
Well,

51
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:23,141
you know,

52
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:23,770
the emperor's,

53
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,730
I'd have to say if you want to go with
like a solid chain of comedy clubs,

54
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,101
don't do it for free.

55
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:34,180
At least the number one comedy
chain across the country.

56
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:35,420
That's a strong move.

57
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,750
I had a great domain.

58
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,613
They do it right.

59
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:38,960
Yeah,

60
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,800
they do it right everywhere.

61
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:42,350
We just did the Improv in
Louisville was fucking awesome.

62
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,820
Yeah,

63
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,760
it was the shit.

64
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:43,971
Yeah,

65
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:44,331
it was great.

66
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:46,280
Every improv is just solid as a rock.

67
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,040
They know what the fuck they're doing
and every time I should be happy that

68
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:49,580
they're around,

69
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,980
but not as good as the Pasadena Ice House.

70
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,340
It was a browser and ice house.

71
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,611
Look at,

72
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:53,480
they're all awesome.

73
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,740
I love the Improv.

74
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:55,670
I love this place.

75
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:56,270
I love,

76
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:56,690
you know,

77
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,110
little comedy clubs like that.

78
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,650
We could support it and we're
helping support it with this podcast.

79
00:02:00,651 --> 00:02:01,271
Actually this,

80
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:03,560
this podcast actually
makes the club money,

81
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,820
so it's nice.

82
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:05,361
It's a,

83
00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:07,730
we do shows here and we pay them rent.

84
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,050
This place is booming lately,

85
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:09,291
man.

86
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,650
Mark Marin's has been here lately.

87
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,380
Great Club.

88
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,530
It's been here since

89
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,710
19 fucking 50 or
something crazy like that.

90
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,131
Yeah.

91
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:18,030
It's like Europe.

92
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,920
This isn't sane for real.

93
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:20,700
I do believe it.

94
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,280
Like I think it just celebrated
its 50th anniversary.

95
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,061
Not Kidding.

96
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,080
So I was exaggerating,

97
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:25,914
but only slightly.

98
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,600
That's incredible.

99
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:28,434
Right?

100
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,413
Is that the goal?

101
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,443
I have no idea.

102
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,110
Anyway,

103
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,770
um,

104
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:31,970
uh,

105
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,860
we're also sponsored by
on at.com on it is a,

106
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:37,770
a maker of a bunch of different
nutritional supplements,

107
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,420
most notably Alpha brain.

108
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,680
That's one that I get mine.

109
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:42,240
I took two of them right
before we do the show.

110
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:43,230
I take them all the time.

111
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,490
Every time I want to do a set,

112
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:48,300
I take them if I have anything where we
need to form coherent sentences and not

113
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,830
stumble over my words like a retard,

114
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,700
I take them.

115
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,870
I think it works.

116
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,610
If you want to find out about it,

117
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:57,350
go to [inaudible] dot com o n
n I t and Google nootropics.

118
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,260
It's a very fascinating subject,

119
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,000
pros and cons against.

120
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,720
Um,

121
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,130
one thing I will tell you about on it,

122
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,090
when you order something,

123
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,700
the first order your 30 pill bottle,

124
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,850
you have a 100% money back guarantee.

125
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:11,200
You don't have to return it.

126
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,180
You can eat it all and say it sucks.

127
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:15,700
I want my money back and you
get 100% of your money back.

128
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,953
So that is to,

129
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,830
to try to let people know that the last
thing we're trying to do is rip anybody

130
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:21,664
off.

131
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,470
Making money is second to making
sure that no one feels ripped off.

132
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,960
These are all supplements that I use and
I have used before I ever in endorsed

133
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,591
this company.

134
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:34,120
I use them independently.

135
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:34,810
Um,

136
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,470
uh,

137
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,340
especially the,

138
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,110
a lot of the contents and Alpha brain,

139
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,470
not so much a shroom tech
sport and shroom tech immune,

140
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,120
which are really fascinating.

141
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:46,780
Shroom tech sport being one that actually
enhances your body's absorption of

142
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:47,300
oxygen,

143
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,990
gives you a little bit more endurance
and it's got to be 12 in it,

144
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:53,130
which also gives you a little bit
more endurance both of those together.

145
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,190
It's a great combination.

146
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:55,540
It's based on the quarter steps mushroom,

147
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,620
which they found,

148
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:56,830
uh,

149
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,400
people in high altitudes where eating
to help them cope with the altitude.

150
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,620
And there's a shroom tech immune,

151
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,461
which is a,

152
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:03,950
another,

153
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,120
a different mushroom supplement
frame for your immune system.

154
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,130
And then there is new mood,

155
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:13,210
which is a five HTP and l trip
defend serotonin boosting supplement.

156
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,360
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on
the link for Alpha brain entering the

157
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:17,194
code name Rogan,

158
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,880
you'll get 10% off all orders.

159
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,390
All right,

160
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,280
let's go start giggle.

161
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,990
Tell me what you were doing
that after the music ready.

162
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:24,261
Three,

163
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:24,531
two,

164
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:25,191
one lunch.

165
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:26,024
And Amy Schumer's,

166
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,340
that was the worst DJ mix a lot.

167
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,840
I have a whole new set up today.

168
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:38,070
He doesn't give him practice.

169
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:39,690
He only does it when we're live on air.

170
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,820
That's when he learns what it does.

171
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,713
What does this one do?

172
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,530
Yeah,

173
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,640
I'm using all new equipment today.

174
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,110
Well you were giggling about before,

175
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,220
are you early?

176
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,400
You're,

177
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,300
you were saying if you
can't cope with altitude,

178
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:54,590
you know,

179
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,300
that helped take one of those pills.

180
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,310
And I'm thinking of about
being really high up going,

181
00:04:58,311 --> 00:04:59,660
I can't cope with this and going,

182
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,770
oh here's some new new mood.

183
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,140
Oh it feels scattered.

184
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,610
I wonder if it would work.

185
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,760
You will never know because yeah,

186
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:08,111
when you,

187
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:10,730
when you get too high and
then if you took something,

188
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,850
how would you know if you just got over
being high or if the stuff took it down

189
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:16,784
a notch,

190
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,570
you would have to,

191
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,170
you'd have to be super experienced,

192
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:19,800
you know?

193
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,633
And there's also like,

194
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,950
you know how,

195
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,930
how much time had you taken off between
that session and the last session?

196
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:28,130
Because if you just take like five,

197
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:30,740
six days off and then reset yourself,

198
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,001
you can,

199
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:33,650
you can get yourself scary high.

200
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,441
You can get,

201
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:34,850
you know,

202
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,480
if you like,

203
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,050
like we don't realize if you get high
every day that you kind of build this like

204
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:41,960
weird acceptance and
tolerance for the high state.

205
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,120
But if you step off for five,

206
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:45,470
six days a week or so,

207
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,313
do you really?

208
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,430
Oh sorry.

209
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,910
It wasn't my idea.

210
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,070
I told you we just do what
your instincts tell you.

211
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,400
Do your instincts tell you like
I just got out of the hospital.

212
00:05:58,401 --> 00:05:58,821
You were like,

213
00:05:58,821 --> 00:05:59,930
your friends are doing it.

214
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,340
I did not say that.

215
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,780
It never said it that way.

216
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,490
The kid was begging for weed.

217
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:04,920
I was like,

218
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,510
listen,

219
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,010
your health is number one.

220
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,920
I was like,

221
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,541
I really,

222
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:11,841
you guys,

223
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:12,860
I'd just get out the hospital.

224
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:13,310
You guys were like,

225
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,970
this will,

226
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,530
this will answer your prayers.

227
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,150
It's good for people to
just get all the hospital.

228
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:17,690
Um,

229
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,523
it's medicine.

230
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:19,911
Let me ask you what,

231
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:20,511
what did you,

232
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,100
you said you got food poisoning.

233
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,190
I am a crab cake and
Phoenix like a dickhead.

234
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,050
Oh,

235
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,590
as a prep get all the way to Phoenix.

236
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:28,490
I'm such a

237
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:28,951
like,

238
00:06:28,951 --> 00:06:29,410
I'm like,

239
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:29,960
Ooh,

240
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,793
smells good.

241
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:31,691
And then,

242
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:32,280
uh,

243
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,661
and like,

244
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:32,850
you know,

245
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,060
I like new halfway through.

246
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:34,600
I was like,

247
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,140
Huh,

248
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,261
what?

249
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:35,900
I'm hungry.

250
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,430
So Howard through like I'm
such a fucking worthless.

251
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,271
And then,

252
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:41,104
um,

253
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,240
and I was like really excited
about my show that night.

254
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:46,060
I was supposed to be at stand up
live and I was like all fired up.

255
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,020
I was manic,

256
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,230
I was in the gym with my
opener and my friend Jackie,

257
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,520
we're just like dancing.

258
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:52,331
I was like the show tonight,

259
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:53,500
David spade was going to come.

260
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:54,251
I've never met him.

261
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:59,251
I think he's really funny and it's like
cute wrestler and a pro like WWE guy.

262
00:06:59,560 --> 00:06:59,891
Yeah.

263
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:01,960
And I was just like excited for
the show and then I was like,

264
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,710
Ooh.

265
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,110
And then just vacating,

266
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,810
like every hole in my body was
getting a ton of use and uh,

267
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,041
until I,

268
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:10,840
and I still was like,

269
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,920
I'll be able to do the show,

270
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:13,600
like showering and puking in the shower.

271
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,051
And then,

272
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:14,500
uh,

273
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,380
finally the club manager
came over and was like,

274
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:17,801
um,

275
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:19,150
you are dying.

276
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:20,560
And they took me to the hospital.

277
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
Oh Shit.

278
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:22,031
Yeah.

279
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:23,020
And the doctor was like,

280
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,070
he,

281
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,000
they put me on morphine
and all this stuff.

282
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,561
And they were like,

283
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:27,910
no one ever says like,

284
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:32,330
so they took me to the hospital
doctors like you fucking pussy go home.

285
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,450
Everybody always has like the story.

286
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:35,170
It's always,

287
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,590
and then the doctor said that you were
moments away from 10 more seconds,

288
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,780
you would have been fish food.

289
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,350
No,

290
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,850
we wouldn't have been able to help you.

291
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,940
Literally one more minute if we don't get
them to the operating table right now.

292
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:46,631
Doctor said,

293
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:47,291
had I not come in,

294
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,750
I would have been uncomfortable
for another 10 minutes now.

295
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,220
He was like,

296
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,050
it's good that you came in with diarrhea.

297
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:53,411
Yeah.

298
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:55,000
But the thing is when
you're that dehydrated,

299
00:07:55,001 --> 00:07:56,350
you can't drink water.

300
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,161
You just puke.

301
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:57,520
And Pew,

302
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,900
I don't know how people sneak it,

303
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,771
sneak it in,

304
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,090
but they kept me overnight.

305
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,870
And uh,

306
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,090
the woman next to me was
so much worse than me.

307
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:06,790
I felt bad for being
there when she was like,

308
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:07,541
I never saw her,

309
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:10,150
but she sounded like an old black woman.

310
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,750
And uh,

311
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,030
she was like puking and praying.

312
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,223
So she was like,

313
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,730
like this weird kind of,

314
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,751
and then she's being like,

315
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:18,550
don't turn your back on me Lord.

316
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,800
Oh.

317
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,210
I was like,

318
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:19,680
bitch,

319
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,513
he's gone.

320
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,780
He's gone.

321
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,690
She's definitely dead.

322
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,830
She's definitely dead.

323
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,783
Wow.

324
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,391
Holy.

325
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,160
She can really die from food poisoning.

326
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,013
Right?

327
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,863
Yeah.

328
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,611
But I mean,

329
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:32,941
yeah,

330
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:33,370
you can,

331
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,150
it happens.

332
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,110
I was in Korea town the other day and
it's really scary how many bees and even

333
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:38,860
sees it.

334
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,630
I think I saw in Korea town,

335
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,340
like it's not normal,

336
00:08:42,341 --> 00:08:44,050
like almost all the restaurants.

337
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:45,940
And I asked somebody like,

338
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:47,500
why is there so many B's and C's?

339
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:48,040
And they're like,

340
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:48,251
oh,

341
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:50,080
because we don't have a connection.

342
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:50,291
You know,

343
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:50,501
like,

344
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:51,131
like you know,

345
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,120
in Hollywood it's like,

346
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:52,421
Hey,

347
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:52,871
I got this,

348
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:53,740
here's some extra money,

349
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,574
look the other way.

350
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,543
And

351
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,640
that's exactly what police,

352
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,510
we're not willing to pay them.

353
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:00,960
Right?

354
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,570
Like if it was some kind of scam
that they don't trust our soul,

355
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,850
what does it take to close?

356
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,430
You have to fail like it.

357
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,280
The R D so I don't know.

358
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,590
I've never seen a C.

359
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,440
Yeah,

360
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,790
I don't think I've seen a c I s I think
I saw the see what has to happen to get

361
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,240
a seat.

362
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,540
I don't,

363
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,930
I don't know how many died and it
be the most mediocre motherfucker.

364
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,050
You look back at like what a
Sam meant to you in high school.

365
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,110
I got seasoned shit that I
didn't even remotely try it.

366
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:25,750
Yeah,

367
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,740
that's what's up.

368
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,130
I don't know when that's from.

369
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,240
I think he's probably still safe.

370
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:30,960
We smelled it.

371
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,960
C a c you get a c just by being there
and like the absorbing every 10th we're

372
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,100
having a bathroom.

373
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,280
The fuck man.

374
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,600
To see really

375
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,430
allowed to keep serving food.

376
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:44,760
Yeah.

377
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,990
Well this was in a place,

378
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,943
but uh,

379
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,461
I'm wondering,

380
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:47,700
yeah,

381
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,001
well,

382
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:48,271
you know,

383
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:49,380
if you go to other countries,

384
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,920
I wonder what that would be like if
you went to Singapore and you saw those

385
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:52,754
street vendors,

386
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,511
you know what,

387
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:54,540
what do you think they would get?

388
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,360
Excuse me?

389
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,950
Do you know what your rating is in Zag is?

390
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,730
They're just like,

391
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,780
I have no legs.

392
00:09:58,781 --> 00:09:59,110
You're like,

393
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,261
oh,

394
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:00,094
sorry.

395
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,120
So say people,

396
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,620
a lot of that apparently is going on
right now with food trucks and food trucks

397
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:08,000
have become like an artsy sort of thing.

398
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,460
Yeah.

399
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,250
Like there was a,

400
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,420
there was a food truck festival
at this mall near my house.

401
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,411
It was crazy.

402
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:17,650
It was like all these food trucks pulled
up and it was like everybody had a

403
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,170
different theme and you know,

404
00:10:19,171 --> 00:10:19,921
there was a food truck,

405
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:21,190
it was just waffles,

406
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,090
just guy had crazy waffles with all kinds
of different fruit toppings and shit.

407
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,030
And then another one was,

408
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,521
you know,

409
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:29,230
like really healthy Vegan one.

410
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:30,640
Another one was this wild,

411
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:30,911
the,

412
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:31,690
you know,

413
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,470
Mexican and it's like what they're doing
is they're getting away with having

414
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:38,050
amazing food but not having
to pay rent somewhere.

415
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,690
Right.

416
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,630
It's like I've seen those
in like San Jose and Austin.

417
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,230
It's like a circus comes to town until
they just like fill up and it's like the

418
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:45,840
trendy,

419
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,560
like you don't need it.

420
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,830
Like we don't need a restaurant.

421
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,830
It's kind of cool.

422
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,180
It really is kind of cool.

423
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,200
I don't want to like what do you do?

424
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,034
You stand there.

425
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,281
Well,

426
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:54,800
you got a fee out of the
problem is the line suck it.

427
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,210
The lines are terrible.

428
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,190
So it takes 20 minutes to get everything.

429
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,050
I'll tell you 20 minutes
to get everything,

430
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,120
but you get all these different,

431
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,391
you know,

432
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:05,840
you're wandering around all these
smells like you're walking past.

433
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:07,790
This dude is making fresh waffles.

434
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,180
Yeah.

435
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,400
You,

436
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,430
you smell the hot syrup of,

437
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:10,760
you know,

438
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,020
whatever berry sauce,

439
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,640
these porn on it and then you walk by
next to that and some Mexican dude is

440
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:19,250
frying up some Connie
Assata and you're like,

441
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:19,911
God damn,

442
00:11:19,911 --> 00:11:20,960
that smells good.

443
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:21,950
Cultures Mingle,

444
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,813
Woo.

445
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,770
The all those smells together.

446
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:25,161
Just,

447
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:25,994
you know,

448
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,740
that's when you go to a restaurant,

449
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:27,951
you know,

450
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:28,281
you don't,

451
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:31,610
you don't get to like walk right by
where the food is cooked in that close.

452
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,200
Yeah.

453
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,470
And you're walking by a truck,

454
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:35,330
you're like 15 feet away from that food.

455
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:36,020
It's cooking.

456
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,980
It's too real for you.

457
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,630
It's too much reality.

458
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,180
Feel it in my bones.

459
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,670
I think it's cool though.

460
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,320
I think it's cool that they can be like,

461
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,950
they can make like really cool food and
they don't have to pay rent somewhere.

462
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:51,230
Then you have to get a
truck one time investment.

463
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:53,030
Then tweaked to people
where they're going to be.

464
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,471
Right.

465
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,010
That's the thing.

466
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,970
It's like speakeasy,

467
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:57,430
like you have to get the word.

468
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,070
Twitter is so amazing
when you think about that.

469
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,720
Follow me on Twitter,

470
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,060
here's where I'm going to
be selling my burritos.

471
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,953
Bam.

472
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,520
And then it's like the cool
place to go everywhere he goes.

473
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,383
Holy Shit.

474
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,650
That's a fucking brilliant.

475
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,383
That is brilliant.

476
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,440
And there's your screenplay
contributing even more and what?

477
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:16,601
Yeah,

478
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:16,930
right.

479
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:17,501
David spade,

480
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:17,721
you said,

481
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:18,100
do you know him?

482
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,933
Right.

483
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,120
I just want to wait and
we just like kind of met.

484
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,183
I met him before,

485
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,420
you know,

486
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,890
I'm pretty good friends with them,

487
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,483
get them all together.

488
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,150
Have you ever had someone try to pitch
you a terrible idea or just pitch you

489
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:35,590
jokes in conversation?

490
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,453
You're just like,

491
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,000
God,

492
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,500
like really?

493
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,490
They tried to give you jokes aside stage.

494
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,330
They'll just like just slip
it in and conversation like,

495
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:43,900
yeah.

496
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,260
By the way,

497
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,790
you ever think a and you're just like,

498
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,320
please stop a shower.

499
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,650
My mom will do it.

500
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:51,484
She's like,

501
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,463
your mom.

502
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,750
She like she did the other day.

503
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:58,270
She talked about how in the bathrooms,

504
00:12:58,271 --> 00:12:59,200
the automatic,

505
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,180
you know you put your hand
under the paper towels,

506
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:04,330
they come out and she just thought it
was so funny to walk around the bathroom

507
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,620
trying to get everything and I was like,

508
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:06,400
mom please,

509
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:06,970
I'm not,

510
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,950
I'm never going to use
anything you give me.

511
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:12,550
Please imagine if you did
all the shit you would take.

512
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:13,960
What if it became your closing bit?

513
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,923
I'm like,

514
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,810
I love my mom

515
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,040
would never let you let it go.

516
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,300
Never let it go.

517
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,800
I made your closing.

518
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,480
How much did you make last year from
doing your stand up and think about how

519
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:32,860
much better it is with my closing because
you're channeling my mom right now.

520
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,570
This went with general in general.

521
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,380
Yeah.

522
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,071
That's what it was.

523
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:40,180
There was no race behind it.

524
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:41,170
Just what a con.

525
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,700
I thought the general,

526
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,320
does your mom have harbor secret wants
to be not calling your mom con by the

527
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:50,441
way,

528
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:51,540
this is the artificial mom

529
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,730
and she won for real.

530
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,010
She's so cool cause that's the only thing.

531
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,870
The only rule she has for me.

532
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,350
I'll talk about everything.

533
00:14:00,351 --> 00:14:01,750
Like I talk about her vagina,

534
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,460
everything on stage,

535
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,111
but I won't,

536
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:05,531
but she's like,

537
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:07,660
just don't call me a cunt if I'm there.

538
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:08,890
So,

539
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,300
so what I say is I'll be like my mom's
here at night and I promised I wasn't

540
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:16,870
going to call her and I'm not going
to and she's still after the show.

541
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:17,260
I was like,

542
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,470
thank you for not doing it.

543
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:21,100
I'm like,

544
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,851
you're the best.

545
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:22,684
I love you.

546
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,551
Now she's pretty,

547
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:26,650
she's pretty cool with letting
me talk about whatever.

548
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,260
It's one of the coolest things about
having friends that are comedians and you

549
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:30,710
could actually say that
your mother might be,

550
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,500
oh my God and nothing or
no comedian even flinches.

551
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,620
I remember you did a roast and you
said something about a Patricia's

552
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:39,454
grandmothers.

553
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,260
I thought it was so funny because
I knew that you guys were friends.

554
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,103
Yeah.

555
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,740
Favorite joke to say.

556
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,190
It was really funny.

557
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,980
Silvermen wrote to me after that
was like after Gospel Brunch,

558
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,630
like that was her fear was like,

559
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,450
yes,

560
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,440
that was a site.

561
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,320
It was just so silly that you did it.

562
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:01,660
And it was so much like a
bunch of comedians sitting
round talking shit to me.

563
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,910
I mean that is completely something
that Brian would say if you were eating

564
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:05,350
breakfast,

565
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,870
right?

566
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,051
Yeah.

567
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:08,470
When I fucked your mother's
brown dirty ass holes

568
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,430
were so you see each other that
then when we're out in the world,

569
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,391
I forget,

570
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:18,620
like last night I went up to the
roof of my hotel and I looked around,

571
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:20,630
I came out to the front and the host goes,

572
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,493
he was like,

573
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:22,281
he's like,

574
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:23,390
do you come in the back door?

575
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,200
And I was like,

576
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,680
what?

577
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,420
And he was like the back door.

578
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:27,200
And I was like,

579
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,651
I said,

580
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:29,510
are you making like an anal joke?

581
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:29,931
And he was like,

582
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:30,764
no.

583
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,603
Like what?

584
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,450
And I was just like,

585
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:32,870
um,

586
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,070
and it was off a moment,

587
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,493
but I'm like,

588
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,190
I'm not used to talking to people that
that wouldn't be okay to say that in

589
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:40,520
front of me.

590
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,370
So imagine if that's the first words.

591
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:45,900
That dude says the back door.

592
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,343
I'm like,

593
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,381
all right.

594
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:48,741
And he's like,

595
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:49,550
no.

596
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:49,910
I was like,

597
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,743
oh right.

598
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,783
I'm discussing.

599
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,990
That was his hustle.

600
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,500
Maybe it works.

601
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,334
Maybe worse.

602
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,380
I would probably be that girl.

603
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,620
This guy knows what he wants.

604
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,820
This guy's a go getter and there,

605
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:05,180
boy,

606
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,013
I could see it.

607
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,983
You can see it.

608
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,761
But now he was like,

609
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:08,594
no.

610
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,260
Yeah,

611
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,160
it's tough.

612
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:10,910
Yeah.

613
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,190
It's just tough to like
be with normal people.

614
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,060
Yeah.

615
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,300
People get mad when we call
a regular folks civilians.

616
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,460
Yeah.

617
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:21,800
Probably.

618
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,520
That probably is a
disrespect to [inaudible].

619
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,220
We were calling them
civilians before the war.

620
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:26,881
Yeah.

621
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:27,950
I always called them civilians.

622
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:30,950
We call them siblings in the 80s when
were worn at war and there had been no

623
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:32,780
wars yet in the eighties no,

624
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:33,620
it never had happened.

625
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,230
All the other wars had
been artificial ones.

626
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:36,981
Right.

627
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:37,461
The ones that,

628
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:38,294
like you said,

629
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,710
the conspiracy theories,

630
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,340
zero wars until this last one.

631
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:43,521
Well,

632
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:48,521
could you imagine if you could get a
culture and take everyone from like age

633
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,100
five and below,

634
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,200
take them and kill everyone else.

635
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,680
So you take all the babies and all the
really young kids don't really know what

636
00:16:57,681 --> 00:17:01,880
the fuck is going on yet and then he'd
just give him a totally fake history.

637
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:04,910
CGI,

638
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,650
old writing.

639
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,460
Everybody has their prepared and that's
how the Illuminati really take over the

640
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:11,000
world.

641
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,260
What they do is they kill everybody
but babies up to like four after four,

642
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:18,020
you'd probably have some memories
of some shit that went down,

643
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,010
you know?

644
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,400
But I think what you're describing is
like what actually without killing people,

645
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:23,720
like that's what actually happens.

646
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:26,420
Like everyone's just
raised with to ton of lies.

647
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,060
Yeah.

648
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,030
There's a little of that and
they're just like unfolding it.

649
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:29,780
As you get older,

650
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,110
you're like,

651
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,201
oh,

652
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:31,310
that was all horse shit.

653
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,151
Yeah.

654
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:37,151
But I think that if you want it
to like really recreate a history,

655
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,080
like create a false history,

656
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,580
I think it's possible to do.

657
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,490
I mean it sounds completely ridiculous,

658
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:46,250
but if you were in a situation,

659
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:50,130
like if it was like after an
asteroid hit and a bunch of people

660
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,570
were killed and there was,

661
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,980
there was very little resources left
and then someone decided we're going to

662
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:59,280
kill everybody but the children and
we're going to start society again with a

663
00:17:59,281 --> 00:18:00,990
fake history that I made up.

664
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,530
Yeah.

665
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,570
Which is essentially
like with Joseph Smith,

666
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,643
he made up a fake

667
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,530
[inaudible].

668
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:05,850
Yeah.

669
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,670
Created the Mormons.

670
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:07,201
I love that.

671
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:08,170
Write that shit works.

672
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,050
They had a whole state and they're all
like so nice and good looking nice.

673
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,590
What's the problem I heard
are the f I went to him

674
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,960
Mormon funeral recently and
it was the nicest friendliest

675
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,281
were you,

676
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:19,114
you were allowed in,

677
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,720
I thought to be allowed in that
church you had to be more a,

678
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:22,901
well,

679
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:23,860
they were UFC fans,

680
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,400
John.

681
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,290
It's all bets are off zero.

682
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,410
Syrians has the religious
people were like,

683
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,760
they really love what you just

684
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,693
made that up.

685
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,940
So the real answer is,

686
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,361
yeah,

687
00:18:40,361 --> 00:18:41,194
my friend,

688
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,710
uh,

689
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,390
who,

690
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,961
who dies,

691
00:18:42,961 --> 00:18:45,030
here's your secret Mormon there.

692
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,110
Their family is Mormon.

693
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,060
So they did an alarming thing.

694
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,930
Yeah.

695
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:49,320
Yeah.

696
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,831
It was,

697
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:50,220
um,

698
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,450
it was a very,

699
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,800
there are so nice.

700
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,260
This is like one nice
person after another.

701
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,670
And even like when you know,

702
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:56,971
there's,

703
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:57,751
there's things like when it's,

704
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:59,430
people write their own speeches,

705
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,290
especially like civilians,

706
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:01,681
right?

707
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:02,610
Their own speeches.

708
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,300
You know,

709
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:08,130
a person who's got a regular
job in society that's not
like used to writing and

710
00:19:08,131 --> 00:19:08,780
having their stuff.

711
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:08,950
Yeah.

712
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,640
Heard you can their ego like squeaks out,

713
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,691
know your ego.

714
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:16,680
Will squeak out when you're talking about
people with a past and you know what

715
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:16,980
happened.

716
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,311
I just,

717
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:17,611
you know,

718
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:18,480
weird shit.

719
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:19,111
You'll find out.

720
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:19,530
Like,

721
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:19,741
you know,

722
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,720
when someone reads it,

723
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,460
it's too long and verbose and you know,

724
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:23,791
you know,

725
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,570
and it's like there's,

726
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,861
there's people that I've,

727
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:27,081
I've,

728
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:30,960
I've been to a couple of funerals and
the grossest thing that ever happens is

729
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:35,961
when someone comes up and uses that time
to talk about them and talk about their

730
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:43,410
relationship and how good a friend they
were like justifying themselves about,

731
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:43,681
you know,

732
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:44,060
to this

733
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,451
daddy.

734
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:48,890
Most people have at least a moment
of that in their speech at funerals.

735
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,131
Like,

736
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:49,341
I've,

737
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:51,530
I've only seen people I've seen,

738
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,510
well actually I like,

739
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:54,710
we're talking about it like it's a set,

740
00:19:54,711 --> 00:19:55,340
but,

741
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:55,551
uh,

742
00:19:55,551 --> 00:19:58,850
I've Seen Collin Quinn speak at two
funerals and he does not do that,

743
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,760
but I think he's the only person I've
ever seen that doesn't even have a moment

744
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:01,971
of,

745
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:03,280
it's about the cones

746
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,130
where,

747
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:04,560
God,

748
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,040
that's why he's so funny and so smart.

749
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,140
And so she's so observant,

750
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,820
picks things up.

751
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,511
But,

752
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:11,930
um,

753
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,340
what I was saying about this,

754
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,650
this funerals that no one did that.

755
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,301
Oh,

756
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:16,780
okay.

757
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,900
It was really about the person.

758
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,681
No,

759
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:19,371
none of that.

760
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:20,204
There was no,

761
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:25,010
cause the last funeral I had been to him
was a Hollywood type affair and I swear

762
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:30,011
a guy went up that knew the dead
person for fucking like three months or

763
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:30,710
something.

764
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,710
And somehow or another he got on the
podium and was like way over doing it and

765
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,561
connecting.

766
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:41,390
This guy's a funeral with the reason
why the son was in a certain position in

767
00:20:41,391 --> 00:20:44,180
the sky and the clouds had
parted and I knew it was him.

768
00:20:44,181 --> 00:20:44,961
It was him talking.

769
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:45,794
I'm like,

770
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,580
fucking get off that podium.

771
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,601
Stupid.

772
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:50,480
Fuck you can.

773
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,720
He's the sun through the clouds.

774
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:54,170
You Retard off.

775
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,090
How dare you.

776
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:57,580
How dare you make me listen
to your nonsense at us.

777
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,660
Sit here and listen to this stupid fucking
meandering bullshit is poorly thought

778
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:01,840
out.

779
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,400
How much more offensive at a funeral,

780
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,500
you are the worst human.

781
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:09,070
And then the guy used it to announce
the fucking opening of his movie.

782
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:09,400
No,

783
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,980
no,

784
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,520
no,

785
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:10,911
no.

786
00:21:10,911 --> 00:21:15,911
He said tried to claim that this guy's
death coincided somehow with the opening

787
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:17,201
of his movie.

788
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:18,640
I Shit you not,

789
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,770
which is a blue dog.

790
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,450
No,

791
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:21,941
no.

792
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:22,361
We were,

793
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:23,230
we were sitting there.

794
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:24,110
We were sitting there and the

795
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:24,731
dude,

796
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:27,220
we knew the dude pretty well
and we were sitting there.

797
00:21:27,221 --> 00:21:29,740
It was me and three of my friends
who knew him when we were just going,

798
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:30,530
fuck,

799
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,363
fuck.

800
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,410
What is this guy doing?

801
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:34,880
Like this is crazy.

802
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,930
This guy's going on
talking about give the,

803
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,370
give out the exact date of
his movie premiere like yes,

804
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,010
like,

805
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,843
and when you go,

806
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,740
he's gonna remember this day and go on
rotten tomatoes and give my movie a good

807
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:49,574
rating.

808
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,520
When the sun part it through those clouds,

809
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,990
that was him talking to me.

810
00:21:53,991 --> 00:21:54,710
He's,

811
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,280
that is why.

812
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,510
Why wouldn't you just talk to you?

813
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,780
He can use his magic to make
the clouds and the sun move.

814
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:03,470
He can make the sun in a certain
position and push the clouds away.

815
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,161
She can do that,

816
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:07,880
but he can't just send you like an
email or mail from beyond the grave.

817
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:08,811
Hey Dude,

818
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:09,441
I'm dead.

819
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:10,191
But it's cool.

820
00:22:10,191 --> 00:22:11,120
I'm in heaven now.

821
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,160
Would it be so hard to
send a fucking email?

822
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:13,431
No,

823
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:15,080
you got to like move trees and shit.

824
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:15,914
What are you going to do?

825
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:16,310
You know,

826
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,680
you've got to cause a lightning
bolt to land on people.

827
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,570
Have you ever had to give
one of his speeches though?

828
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:21,330
Those speeches?

829
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,163
Socks,

830
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,200
you have shit and it's so gross.

831
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,043
The the dollar.

832
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,750
It's not yourself.

833
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,830
It's not your everyday person.

834
00:22:27,831 --> 00:22:31,420
You have to almost play a character
where you're overdoing almost.

835
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,140
It's harder for Comedians I think.

836
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:33,800
Yeah.

837
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,710
Well I dunno.

838
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,200
I just cried and said some
shit that I believed I did.

839
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,021
I didn't,

840
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:39,854
um,

841
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,210
I didn't write anything out.

842
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,690
I felt like if I wrote anything out then
it would just sound like horse shit.

843
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,400
I just tried to say as,

844
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,940
as as much about the
person that affected me,

845
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,720
you know,

846
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,021
what's,

847
00:22:51,021 --> 00:22:53,900
what's positive about
them and then we just go,

848
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:54,860
you know,

849
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,760
cherish our time.

850
00:22:55,761 --> 00:22:56,091
It's so,

851
00:22:56,091 --> 00:23:00,290
it's so difficult to think about
the fact that your time is not,

852
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:00,741
it's not,

853
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:01,820
it's not permanent.

854
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,910
You are only going to get a little bit
of this shit and you could waste it.

855
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,511
You can waste sue.

856
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:06,380
It's shitty thoughts.

857
00:23:06,381 --> 00:23:07,430
You could waste it with,

858
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,990
with doing the wrong thing.

859
00:23:08,991 --> 00:23:11,520
You can raced it with bad energy and it,

860
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:14,690
sometimes it takes like a death for us
to realize that I don't like going to

861
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,620
funerals anymore.

862
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,461
I don't like it.

863
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:19,940
I don't like the feeling of being around
a bunch of people who are mourning.

864
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:20,661
I don't like it.

865
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:21,230
I like,

866
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,920
there's been a few people that died
comics especially where I'm like,

867
00:23:24,921 --> 00:23:28,490
I don't want to be around all my friends
that are also fellow comedians and sit

868
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,620
around and cry and about,

869
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,260
I don't want to do that in her life.

870
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,560
I think it's harder seeing comedians
upset and maybe it's just cause I'm closer

871
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:35,891
to them,

872
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:36,670
but,

873
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,850
but seeing like those
guys that I'm close to,

874
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,350
like when they're sad,

875
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:41,551
it,

876
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:41,890
it,

877
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:42,200
it,

878
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,450
it feels so much worse,

879
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,321
you know?

880
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:44,740
And,

881
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,261
but it,

882
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:45,711
it also,

883
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:45,921
like,

884
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:46,700
I,

885
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,150
I like,

886
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,020
I don't like the funerals,

887
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:51,680
but then hanging out after and talking
with them and just telling stories

888
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,020
because that's what we
would all want it if I,

889
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,700
if I died when I die,

890
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:56,534
I want,

891
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,970
I want people to tell,

892
00:23:57,971 --> 00:23:58,090
uh,

893
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,660
the most fucked up shit that I did.

894
00:23:59,690 --> 00:23:59,930
Right.

895
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:00,141
You know,

896
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:01,430
you want people sitting around like,

897
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:02,120
oh my God,

898
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,840
I'll never forget when he did this and
went right because that's what we would

899
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:06,021
want.

900
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:06,854
So it's like,

901
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,190
it's also a good opportunity to just
like celebrate the shit out of that

902
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:11,990
person's life and tell every story.

903
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:12,860
And you know,

904
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:13,694
there was like a,

905
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,601
at least with them,

906
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:16,250
with Patrice and a Geraldo,

907
00:24:16,251 --> 00:24:16,511
like,

908
00:24:16,511 --> 00:24:17,120
uh,

909
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,440
like a good number of nights in a row
where everyone just was going around just

910
00:24:21,441 --> 00:24:25,070
nonstop and it felt really therapeutic
and like what they would have wanted.

911
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,500
They,

912
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,333
they don't want to,

913
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,010
they want people to be upset of course.

914
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:28,671
But you know,

915
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:28,881
like,

916
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:32,810
just talk about maybe some stories
and nobody ever heard that.

917
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:33,644
I did

918
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,330
listen to opie and Anthony after he died.

919
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:36,631
Yeah.

920
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:36,931
I went,

921
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:38,790
I went on day dedicated.

922
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,301
I mean,

923
00:24:39,301 --> 00:24:40,650
like so many shows to him.

924
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:41,250
Yeah,

925
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:41,910
it was great.

926
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:46,910
I couldn't think of any other
show that would respect and,

927
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,880
uh,

928
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,880
honor one of their favorite guests the
way they did their brothers way they did.

929
00:24:54,331 --> 00:24:55,380
It was so beautiful.

930
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,303
I love them.

931
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,360
They're the best.

932
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,290
They're the nicest fucking guys,

933
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:02,720
this easiest radio show to do.

934
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,180
Fucking hilarious history.

935
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,180
Hilarious comedians.

936
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:08,970
But they are just as
fast and they kill me.

937
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,440
Anthony's a fucking brilliant.

938
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,540
He kills,

939
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,950
he knows weird shit about
weird things and he's,

940
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:14,560
you know,

941
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,020
he's,

942
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,890
he's a Weirdo.

943
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,020
Fascinating guy.

944
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,700
Fat and Oakland is,

945
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,670
he knows how to move a fucking show.

946
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,960
Jim Norton.

947
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,250
Norton is mine.

948
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,020
I believe he's the funniest guy in radio.

949
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:25,600
I really do.

950
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,870
Nobody makes me laugh
consistently more than him.

951
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,880
He's made trainees exceptable

952
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,330
he'll just say something and it doesn't

953
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,391
so unfazed.

954
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:36,190
I don't know what would
faze me at this point,

955
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:36,570
but it,

956
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:36,971
it'll just,

957
00:25:36,971 --> 00:25:38,950
it'll just be some story
about like fucking a tranny.

958
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,710
Just

959
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,070
like,

960
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,450
while we're eating eggs and I'm like,

961
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,330
you block it off like a
bad child molestation.

962
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:44,620
You're like,

963
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,453
sounds great.

964
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,190
All right.

965
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,780
She sounds like she really gets you to me.

966
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,180
Nobody else has ever been able to
pull off the whole tranny thing.

967
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,520
You do it also people are like,

968
00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:00,500
well you know they like ask for advice
like comedy advice and just going on the

969
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:02,120
road with Jimmy and a towel.

970
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:02,720
No,

971
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,160
they worked so fucking hard.

972
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,280
They're not like just sitting
around doing dog shit all day,

973
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:08,300
like googling themselves.

974
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:11,090
They're like writing and
thinking and you know,

975
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:13,340
it's like they work harder than anyone.

976
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,011
Well,

977
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:17,250
especially when you're on the road and
you're trying to piece together a new

978
00:26:17,251 --> 00:26:17,880
act,

979
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,780
which I know Jimmy's had to do
a couple of times recently ever.

980
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,750
You put something out,

981
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,350
you got to burn,

982
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,280
start all over again.

983
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:23,640
Yeah.

984
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,780
I saw him in Austin about a year ago
and it was all shit I hadn't seen before

985
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:29,430
and it was fucking great.

986
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,870
Oh that's so funny.

987
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:31,600
So funny.

988
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,131
I said to him,

989
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:32,440
I said,

990
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,440
I was so happy I saw it and I enjoyed
it so much because sometimes I feel self

991
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:39,780
conscious that I have so many Dick Jokes.

992
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,880
You have to pick and
choose like Mike am I just,

993
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,970
I have like so many with Dick Jokes
but with him every other jokes and Dick

994
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,630
check.

995
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,520
But he finds a different
way that you're like,

996
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,151
okay,

997
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,370
I think we can take one more dick joke.

998
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,440
I also realize that um,

999
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,760
I'm very childish and my sense of humor.

1000
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:59,610
My favorite comedians or Joey Diaz,

1001
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:02,850
Joey Diaz is my all time favorite is
like the one guy who makes me laugh the

1002
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:05,190
most and then everyone else,

1003
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:07,050
it's like their most childish Shit,

1004
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,303
you know?

1005
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:11,790
I like,

1006
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,640
I like my shit childish
me to the dumbest Shit.

1007
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,660
This simplest Norton's talking about
someone's sucking hogs and laughing like a

1008
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:21,690
little,

1009
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,810
like a silly high school.

1010
00:27:22,811 --> 00:27:23,581
What do you call someone?

1011
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:25,710
Like if he'll just use
some like old timey.

1012
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:27,120
I felt like a real maroon.

1013
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:27,571
You're like,

1014
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:28,231
what's it like?

1015
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:29,460
No one talks like that.

1016
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:34,260
So funny that he's made having sex with
trannies and acceptable thing that could

1017
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:35,850
be a scan of the could ruin your career.

1018
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,790
Zero apologies.

1019
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,773
Zero.

1020
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,950
He doesn't give a shit.

1021
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:43,500
That's a really original
thing and it's like just,

1022
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,850
and he's not really,

1023
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:45,570
isn't it?

1024
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:48,800
What the original is at Norton?

1025
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,970
I don't think Eddie Izzard
a sex with trainees,

1026
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:55,080
but he like that's pretty bad ass
to where did he do standup in drag?

1027
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:55,771
Yeah,

1028
00:27:55,771 --> 00:27:58,200
I think that was more of a gimmick than
anything cause I don't even think you

1029
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:01,420
discussed it and now I
don't talking about it.

1030
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:01,590
Yeah,

1031
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:04,710
but I mean he didn't discuss the fact
that he was wearing women's clothes.

1032
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,181
I don't think so.

1033
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:08,580
I think he just went on
and I could be mistaken.

1034
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,780
Someone will correct
me on Twitter by sure.

1035
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:11,370
I was,

1036
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,640
that was the thing was that he would just
go on stage and do his whole act dress

1037
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:18,660
like a woman just like to freak people
out or call attention to himself.

1038
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:19,740
I used to,

1039
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,850
didn't used to think that,

1040
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:21,391
you know,

1041
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:22,680
I didn't think about that guy.

1042
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,300
Positive or negative until I watched some
documentary about him wanting all the

1043
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:28,590
way across the UK.

1044
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:29,731
Oh my God.

1045
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:30,564
It was insane.

1046
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:31,051
He's,

1047
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:35,640
the fucking gun wasn't even in shape
and he did like a marathon a day.

1048
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,530
He did like 26 miles every day and his
feet were falling apart and massive

1049
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:45,180
blisters and everything was
open uninfected and he just
would tape it up and the

1050
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,290
next day brought a fucking marathon.

1051
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,030
It's a special kind of crazy right there.

1052
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,391
Oh,

1053
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:48,721
it was,

1054
00:28:48,721 --> 00:28:49,800
what are you running from Eddie?

1055
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,330
No,

1056
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,460
well he was wanting for
a charity and if he,

1057
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:55,920
if he got dickhead and as he was doing,

1058
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,180
he was running for kids with aids.

1059
00:28:57,181 --> 00:28:57,421
I'm like,

1060
00:28:57,421 --> 00:28:58,530
fuck them.

1061
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,281
I'm telling you.

1062
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:00,540
It was really impressive.

1063
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:00,961
I mean,

1064
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:01,980
it was really impressive.

1065
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:03,210
This fucking guy ran,

1066
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,360
lacked in Arabic and French
also doesn't realize,

1067
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,050
he's like,

1068
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:07,883
I don't,

1069
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,790
I don't know.

1070
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,720
I don't understand.

1071
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,053
Wow.

1072
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,521
Yeah.

1073
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:11,941
There's some,

1074
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:13,110
a humbling people out there,

1075
00:29:13,111 --> 00:29:13,890
right?

1076
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,210
I guess dude ranch,

1077
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,410
I guess I haven't met him,

1078
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:18,990
but I gotta be out there somewhere.

1079
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:20,880
I'll meet somebody that'll
shut me the fuck up,

1080
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,080
but not today.

1081
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,470
Maybe the best right here.

1082
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,903
Every time,

1083
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,380
knocking it out of the park.

1084
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,330
The funniest thing is there's someone out
there that thinks that way and there's

1085
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,180
a lot of people,

1086
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,780
we know a lot of people like that on,

1087
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:38,100
Bro.

1088
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,410
I'm the best I could
fix this whole country.

1089
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,100
Right,

1090
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,933
right.

1091
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,030
They're doing it wrong.

1092
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,090
I'll fix NASA will fix
fucking Rick Santorum.

1093
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,920
Fix a mall and you're like,

1094
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,161
yeah,

1095
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,120
you're the best.

1096
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,681
You're the best.

1097
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:51,850
You know what I watched the other day,

1098
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,530
best of the best.

1099
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:56,130
Have you ever seen the best
of the best way to say,

1100
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,973
uh,

1101
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,520
uh,

1102
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,130
Eric,

1103
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:58,660
um,

1104
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,440
Roberts movie from like 1989?

1105
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,790
Oh my God.

1106
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,211
What is,

1107
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:05,710
it's a karate movie.

1108
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,430
Hello?

1109
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,260
They're in a karate tournament with some,

1110
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:10,660
some other dudes and a,

1111
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:10,931
you know,

1112
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:12,730
they have all these crazy karate fights.

1113
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:14,020
Did he learn how to do karate?

1114
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,710
So very rudimentary on Roberts.

1115
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,610
That's what happened to him.

1116
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:19,840
That's why he disappeared for a while.

1117
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:20,140
Yeah.

1118
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:20,351
I mean,

1119
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,120
it doesn't look like you really learned.

1120
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,820
It's not like ever see like Michael
Jai white ever see that guy.

1121
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,140
The guy who played um,

1122
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:28,020
Mike Tyson in that movie about Tyson.

1123
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,613
He was spawn.

1124
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,790
You ever see the movie spawn?

1125
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,230
I haven't seen any of these movies.

1126
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,093
Muscular black,

1127
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,720
27 dresses.

1128
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:35,561
No.

1129
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:36,394
What do we do?

1130
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:37,920
This the area committee.

1131
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,240
This is it,

1132
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,440
dude.

1133
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,110
This is such a terrible,

1134
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:41,970
terrible movie.

1135
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,410
You never even heard of it.

1136
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,130
Yeah.

1137
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:45,791
Tommy Lee,

1138
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:47,320
they couldn't come up
with a different name.

1139
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,070
Nah,

1140
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,560
I think this was before
Tommy Lee was famous.

1141
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,170
You know,

1142
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:54,090
back then Tommy Lee was
still in motley crew,

1143
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,933
but better.

1144
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:56,740
Yeah.

1145
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,461
James old draws.

1146
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:58,650
A lot of good people are in it.

1147
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,170
Am I wrong?

1148
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,670
There's the eighties token hot chick with
the 80s there's a bunch of respectable

1149
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:07,540
actors in this movie is one of the reasons
why it's such a hunk of shit all the

1150
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:07,811
time.

1151
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:10,720
Gold medal winner and heart
and soul of the Korean team.

1152
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,610
This guy went on to open a Holy Spirit

1153
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,483
restaurant.

1154
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,350
Korean barbecue.

1155
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:22,780
Perhaps this guy's a
knocking it off the charts.

1156
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,580
This isn't a scene with Eric Roberts,

1157
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:25,414
unfortunately,

1158
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,820
because these guys probably
actually know martial arts.

1159
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,380
Watching Eric.

1160
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,510
Eric Roberts was my
favorite celebrity rehab.

1161
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,290
I didn't see that one.

1162
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,020
Why?

1163
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,701
What was his deal?

1164
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:35,130
We'll be like,

1165
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,620
we'll just pause.

1166
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,660
That's what a fuck though.

1167
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,940
His agents like,

1168
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:41,590
uh,

1169
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,560
in the morning,

1170
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,640
he be like looking at the paper twiddle
and his little foot around drinking a

1171
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:47,474
cup of coffee.

1172
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,580
Love shakes,

1173
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,041
and they're like,

1174
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,840
my family isn't talking to me.

1175
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:51,681
He's like,

1176
00:31:51,681 --> 00:31:52,590
I'm a little hungry,

1177
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,310
but the people like Lee,

1178
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,791
I got got it.

1179
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:54,460
Just got to go outside.

1180
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,670
It means friends real quick.

1181
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,330
Yeah.

1182
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:57,490
Oh my God.

1183
00:31:57,491 --> 00:31:57,831
It's like,

1184
00:31:57,831 --> 00:31:58,071
oh,

1185
00:31:58,071 --> 00:31:58,461
come on.

1186
00:31:58,461 --> 00:31:59,390
Stay with the program.

1187
00:31:59,391 --> 00:31:59,740
I'm,

1188
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,680
I'm gutting it out.

1189
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,043
Gutting it out.

1190
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,523
He is.

1191
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,610
He goes to a chipolte lay.

1192
00:32:04,611 --> 00:32:05,570
That's all you got.

1193
00:32:05,571 --> 00:32:06,770
You can't get off your morphine.

1194
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,663
I'm gutting it out.

1195
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:08,691
I mean,

1196
00:32:08,691 --> 00:32:09,530
we touched weed.

1197
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,240
I haven't touched weed three days.

1198
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:11,451
Oh,

1199
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:12,620
you're so strong.

1200
00:32:12,621 --> 00:32:13,071
I don't think,

1201
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:14,450
I mean pain right now.

1202
00:32:14,451 --> 00:32:15,320
There is wrong.

1203
00:32:15,321 --> 00:32:15,861
Eric,

1204
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:18,470
you don't think I'm a hurt
on the inside right now.

1205
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,550
Don't turn your back on me,

1206
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:20,150
Lord.

1207
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,500
It became some weird
therapeutic thing where he,

1208
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,610
he had his stepson and his
stepson came on the show.

1209
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,090
Oh my God.

1210
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,520
Steps.

1211
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,040
I hated him for how he treated them.

1212
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:31,310
Like,

1213
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,920
Oh God damn too much.

1214
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:35,481
Well,

1215
00:32:35,481 --> 00:32:35,721
you know,

1216
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:36,471
you realize,

1217
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:36,951
and this is,

1218
00:32:36,951 --> 00:32:38,960
this is a reality of a lot of,

1219
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,010
there's a reason why a lot of

1220
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,490
people,

1221
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,410
famous people's kids become crazy.

1222
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:42,740
Yeah.

1223
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,450
It's because when you're
like a movie star,

1224
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,820
you go places for months at a time.

1225
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,760
Right.

1226
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,230
You know,

1227
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,210
if you're Eric Roberts,

1228
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:50,810
I mean,

1229
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,140
I guarantee you that guy had to
go places when that guy was a kid.

1230
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:54,321
I mean,

1231
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:55,700
I don't know if he took
his family with him.

1232
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:56,690
I don't know how he rocked it,

1233
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,300
but a lot of people just go places.

1234
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:02,000
I know folks that leave their
family behind for months.

1235
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,630
It seems like that's how it used to be.

1236
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:04,021
Even now,

1237
00:33:04,021 --> 00:33:05,850
everybody's so aware and sensitive.

1238
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:07,200
I can't believe that shit still happens.

1239
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,790
It still happens for sure.

1240
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,570
Yeah.

1241
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,980
I think it happened a lot though,

1242
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,873
back in the day.

1243
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,420
I mean you look,

1244
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:12,961
there's a lot,

1245
00:33:12,961 --> 00:33:13,141
I mean,

1246
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:15,110
I don't want to name any names
because I'm not trying to,

1247
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:15,461
well,

1248
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:16,630
like who are you talking about?

1249
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,250
I'm just looking at it objectively.

1250
00:33:20,251 --> 00:33:20,440
Like

1251
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,720
when you look at all
these famous kids love,

1252
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,960
see you like people who were famous in
the 70s and the Andes and then the kids

1253
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:28,340
become adults and complete fuck ups.

1254
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,730
There's a God damn laundry list to them.

1255
00:33:30,731 --> 00:33:31,510
It's a big,

1256
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,560
almost all of them.

1257
00:33:32,561 --> 00:33:33,190
Yeah,

1258
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:34,060
it's incredible.

1259
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,380
Yeah.

1260
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:34,900
So you gotta,

1261
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,430
you gotta think like what?

1262
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,450
What happened there?

1263
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:38,740
How did this go wrong?

1264
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,570
What w how can this be avoided?

1265
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:41,171
Right.

1266
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:41,411
You know,

1267
00:33:41,411 --> 00:33:41,801
this is,

1268
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:42,590
this is a,

1269
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,200
there's something's going wrong here.

1270
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:45,250
And then the mechanism of,

1271
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,470
of raising a human under the,

1272
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:48,040
you know,

1273
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,873
this job,

1274
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,600
but what is it?

1275
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,800
Is it the distance,

1276
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:51,611
the time away?

1277
00:33:51,611 --> 00:33:54,340
Is it the unfair and weird
treatment that you can,

1278
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:54,600
yeah.

1279
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,860
Just having a parent that's a huge
narcissist probably isn't awesome.

1280
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:58,160
Yeah,

1281
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,330
that probably is an awesome mom line.

1282
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,071
Not the best.

1283
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:01,841
You remember mommy dearest?

1284
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:02,360
Yeah.

1285
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:02,791
What the fuck?

1286
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:03,550
It's scary movie.

1287
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,250
That was good.

1288
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,730
That movie scared the shit out of
me that Faye Dunaway is how bad ass.

1289
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,450
Gosh,

1290
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,350
so good.

1291
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:14,740
She was a bad ass because you believed
it would every fucking we don't Dunaway,

1292
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:16,620
wasn't it Joan Collins?

1293
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,320
Which one is Faye Dunaway.

1294
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:18,471
Oh,

1295
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:19,000
fait dollars.

1296
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,671
There's another one,

1297
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:20,450
right?

1298
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,283
Yeah.

1299
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,450
Who was a which one?

1300
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,373
Oh No.

1301
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,223
What's in it?

1302
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,011
Mommy dearest?

1303
00:34:26,011 --> 00:34:26,970
Was it Joan Collins?

1304
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,710
Oh yeah.

1305
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:29,910
Feed Dunaway was like,

1306
00:34:29,911 --> 00:34:31,230
wasn't she like Bonnie and Clyde?

1307
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,220
You might know.

1308
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:32,341
Well,

1309
00:34:32,341 --> 00:34:33,210
I think she was.

1310
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,251
No,

1311
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:38,530
it's Faye Dunaway was in
mommy dearest Faye Dunaway.

1312
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:39,240
Swami Derris?

1313
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:39,640
Yes.

1314
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,060
Oh yes.

1315
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,181
Oh,

1316
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:40,980
it's in the family.

1317
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,461
Oh my God.

1318
00:34:41,461 --> 00:34:42,270
I'm looking at the picture.

1319
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:42,640
Oh,

1320
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:42,991
are you?

1321
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:43,920
I know you remember this.

1322
00:34:43,921 --> 00:34:44,910
Of course it's Faye Dunaway

1323
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,163
shit.

1324
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,840
Oh God.

1325
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,100
Oh God.

1326
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:54,780
If you haven't seen this movie and you
want to know how crazy actresses really

1327
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:56,050
are capable thing,

1328
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,670
this is a real win.

1329
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,171
An Oscar.

1330
00:34:58,171 --> 00:34:58,741
She must have.

1331
00:34:58,741 --> 00:34:59,371
She had to.

1332
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:00,181
She must've that.

1333
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:00,751
She went,

1334
00:35:00,751 --> 00:35:01,321
she did it.

1335
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:02,130
She went deep.

1336
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,090
If she didn't win an Oscar,

1337
00:35:03,091 --> 00:35:04,050
the Oscars are bullshit.

1338
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,770
If she didn't win an Oscar for that,

1339
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:06,660
I'm moving to Canada.

1340
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,700
If she didn't want to ask
you for that right now.

1341
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,170
I won't get my bags,

1342
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,740
Brian.

1343
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,820
I'll consider Hawaii.

1344
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:13,640
I am go,

1345
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,050
I'm at least going out of a
couple of days to Saint Lucia.

1346
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,483
Saint Lucia.

1347
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,353
What's done?

1348
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,150
Um,

1349
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,230
oh,

1350
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,220
I just went there with my sister.

1351
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,330
That was in my mind or something.

1352
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,231
You went through what?

1353
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:22,890
Your sister?

1354
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:23,071
Yeah,

1355
00:35:23,071 --> 00:35:23,861
we went to,

1356
00:35:23,861 --> 00:35:24,390
um,

1357
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,840
I did not know that sandals
was a couples resort.

1358
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,320
Oh.

1359
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,501
Oh.

1360
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,050
So you look,

1361
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:32,370
oh everyone just thought we were
raging dykes the whole time.

1362
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,030
Wow.

1363
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,350
And we look like twins.

1364
00:35:34,351 --> 00:35:37,650
So we looked like the most
narcissistic lesbians ever.

1365
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:37,980
Like we

1366
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,130
saw each other to Barr Lake.

1367
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,720
Huh?

1368
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,291
Hey,

1369
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:41,370
like how you look?

1370
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,180
Um,

1371
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,140
everyone hated us.

1372
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,100
It was all did,

1373
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:44,970
did,

1374
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:48,550
did you know sandals was all couples
like d has that marketing reached you?

1375
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,310
I just did not reach me either.

1376
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,320
I didn't really actually know.

1377
00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:53,450
I actually have thought about like,

1378
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,343
Hey,

1379
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,760
all resort thing where
they pay you pay one thing.

1380
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:57,594
You don't have to pave.

1381
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:59,003
We,

1382
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,761
that's what we did.

1383
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:00,480
And uh,

1384
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,313
she's married,

1385
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,190
I'm single.

1386
00:36:02,191 --> 00:36:03,540
I'm not trying to hook up with like,

1387
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:03,931
you know,

1388
00:36:03,931 --> 00:36:04,860
like an islander.

1389
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,790
Um,

1390
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,720
but whatever we,

1391
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,940
but it was a hundred percent couples.

1392
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:12,540
We were the only people and it was
really uncomfortable because people are

1393
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:17,541
either mad we were there or way overly
talking to us so that we knew how

1394
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:19,770
tolerant they were of lesbians.

1395
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:20,883
Like they'd be like,

1396
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,480
stop having so much fun.

1397
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:23,314
You too.

1398
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,950
And thank you for accepting our lifestyle.

1399
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:27,843
We're sister,

1400
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:29,801
but we did,

1401
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:30,960
everybody did everything.

1402
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,180
We were the biggest assholes.

1403
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,340
We did everything that the couples did.

1404
00:36:34,341 --> 00:36:37,850
So we like went to all
the like dinners and um,

1405
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:38,780
uh,

1406
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,410
like if the photo shoots inside like a
heart shape rose pedals on the beach,

1407
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:43,430
like we held each other.

1408
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,180
I put,

1409
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,530
I put some pictures on Twitter,

1410
00:36:45,531 --> 00:36:46,760
but it was,

1411
00:36:46,761 --> 00:36:47,180
uh,

1412
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,080
it was pretty brutal.

1413
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,220
Should finger blasted her.

1414
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:49,701
Oh,

1415
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:50,361
I fucked her.

1416
00:36:50,361 --> 00:36:50,990
She got her,

1417
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:51,970
she got good and fucked.

1418
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:53,720
Sorry.

1419
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,350
Sorry.

1420
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:59,350
This is not just lesbian sex is
assessed a lot of game of Thrones.

1421
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,470
I'm anything goes.

1422
00:37:00,471 --> 00:37:01,940
It's just started watching it.

1423
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,450
How far are you two episodes?

1424
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:05,910
Oh,

1425
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,743
I'm jealous.

1426
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,940
I was at the even seen it.

1427
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,710
Did you like the wire here?

1428
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,030
It's what Conan the
barbarian should have been.

1429
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:19,340
Show's so good.

1430
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,131
So jealousy.

1431
00:37:20,131 --> 00:37:22,130
You have so much time to work.

1432
00:37:22,131 --> 00:37:22,341
See,

1433
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:24,350
when you go to that Conan movie,

1434
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,420
they had good intentions,

1435
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,690
but you can't tell Conan story in,

1436
00:37:28,691 --> 00:37:29,930
in in an hour and a half.

1437
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:34,931
The Real Robert he Howard books with
these long Sagas of adventure and betrayal

1438
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:40,001
and sorcery and and fucking demons and
sword fights and shit in like two hours.

1439
00:37:41,001 --> 00:37:42,560
You can't do that in a movie,

1440
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:42,990
man.

1441
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:43,520
You,

1442
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,160
the only way you're going to rock that
is if you have a series like this.

1443
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:49,850
Game of Thrones is the
best fucking good dude.

1444
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,140
Good show.

1445
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,840
At least the first two episodes
gets better and better.

1446
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,620
I want more fucking supernatural.

1447
00:37:57,621 --> 00:37:58,454
You fucks

1448
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,190
the supernatural.

1449
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,050
You start off the whole show,

1450
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,370
get me all roped up and you supernatural.

1451
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,020
I want to see a little bit
more of this supernatural.

1452
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,960
There's one I'm looking
for a little less incest.

1453
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,630
One more where we disagree.

1454
00:38:14,631 --> 00:38:15,950
I want more incest.

1455
00:38:15,951 --> 00:38:16,784
Also,

1456
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:20,780
it's like the wild brother and
sister fucking being surprised

1457
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,523
the way

1458
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,900
probably is how they used to do it

1459
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,600
gets even crazier.

1460
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,460
I don't even want to know.

1461
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,140
And that's actually reality by the way.

1462
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:34,070
That's what people were doing.

1463
00:38:34,071 --> 00:38:36,160
They were fucking their
sisters until like a week ago.

1464
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,290
I was in Birmingham.

1465
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:38,670
That shit is still going on.

1466
00:38:38,671 --> 00:38:39,720
I saw some eyes,

1467
00:38:39,721 --> 00:38:41,490
place to God knows where

1468
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,380
people are fucking whatever they can,

1469
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:43,951
you know.

1470
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:45,930
And if you can fuck your
sister and no one's gonna know,

1471
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,823
hey,

1472
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,880
save gas,

1473
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:48,810
fuck your sister.

1474
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,250
Where's that bumper sticker?

1475
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,740
Let's make a deal.

1476
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,150
You want from Dick?

1477
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,370
I want to pussy.

1478
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,273
I got a dick.

1479
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,791
God Damn.

1480
00:38:57,791 --> 00:38:58,960
Why are we got to outsource?

1481
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,770
I really wonder how many
relationships are are like boy,

1482
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:02,351
like brothers,

1483
00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:03,220
sister relationships.

1484
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:04,180
I bet it's a lot

1485
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:06,560
everywhere.

1486
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,710
Like if you take in the
whole United States,

1487
00:39:08,711 --> 00:39:10,340
I bet there are a lot of brothers.

1488
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,140
The ultimate form of keeping it local,

1489
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:13,981
keep it real,

1490
00:39:13,981 --> 00:39:15,930
keep it local by local.

1491
00:39:15,931 --> 00:39:17,700
Made local products.

1492
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,511
They're really,

1493
00:39:18,511 --> 00:39:18,811
it's a,

1494
00:39:18,811 --> 00:39:19,631
it's a sick feeling,

1495
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:19,830
right?

1496
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,910
Incest is a sick feeling.

1497
00:39:20,911 --> 00:39:22,170
Like the idea that people would do that.

1498
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,310
Maybe that's why the idea of nationalism
is such a bizarre fucking feeling.

1499
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,993
Nationalism.

1500
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,990
Someone really being into
being from one country.

1501
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,820
Keep it local.

1502
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,150
American rod here.

1503
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,290
I'll play it a little more.

1504
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,000
Cause there's a Toby Keith song there's
made in America and it's all about he

1505
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:44,940
pay a little more,

1506
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:46,350
but it's made in America.

1507
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,810
Relax Toby.

1508
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,970
I would like it if it was amazing there.

1509
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:57,210
Oh there's another guy who is
Keith urban on the country.

1510
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,120
I wouldn't mind if things are made in
other countries if I thought that people

1511
00:40:00,121 --> 00:40:00,954
were getting paid.

1512
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:03,420
The only thing about America
is like if you buy a corvette,

1513
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,950
you know that someone's got a pension.

1514
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,660
You know that.

1515
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,830
You know that the people that
are making her in the auto union,

1516
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,310
you know,

1517
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,500
you really do know how much they get paid.

1518
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:13,220
You can find out and you buy Nike's.

1519
00:40:13,221 --> 00:40:13,410
You know,

1520
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,280
it's like some child,

1521
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:15,120
they bound their hands,

1522
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:15,811
their fingers,

1523
00:40:15,811 --> 00:40:16,644
so they wouldn't grow.

1524
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,260
If you buy like Foxconn products,

1525
00:40:19,261 --> 00:40:21,720
if you buy I iPhones are a
lot of other cell phones.

1526
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,380
You know there,

1527
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,800
there's a huge debate right now
they're trying to figure out how,

1528
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:30,120
how to straighten this out in the eyes
of the people because they've in a ton of

1529
00:40:30,121 --> 00:40:31,290
suicides and you know,

1530
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:33,110
their thoughts are on,

1531
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:33,511
yeah,

1532
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:34,740
they've got a lot of suicides,

1533
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,020
so much so that install suicide nets,

1534
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,700
what staff suicide nets at the Fox on
building and people would try to talk you

1535
00:40:41,701 --> 00:40:42,534
through this.

1536
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:43,723
So hilarious.

1537
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,400
Like,

1538
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,970
well statistically that's actually
less than the number of suicides in the

1539
00:40:47,971 --> 00:40:49,770
population in that area.

1540
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,341
And you're like,

1541
00:40:50,341 --> 00:40:51,150
first of all,

1542
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:51,510
that's,

1543
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,050
that's,

1544
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:56,850
that's a ridiculous thing because what
you're saying is that the whole time

1545
00:40:56,851 --> 00:40:59,550
they're alive when they
would commit suicide.

1546
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,390
No.

1547
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,790
How many people kill themselves at work,

1548
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,601
at work,

1549
00:41:03,601 --> 00:41:06,290
at work in the place
that they hate the most?

1550
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:06,690
Yeah.

1551
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:07,610
That's your,

1552
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,430
you're talking about a
completely different experience
talking about people that

1553
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:16,170
are living on campus and our
proxy throwing themselves
off the fucking roof and

1554
00:41:16,171 --> 00:41:19,730
smashing their brains onto
the concrete and the pain.

1555
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,100
We don't,

1556
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,100
we can't find the combat is statistically
less than would be had they been

1557
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:26,460
slaves.

1558
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:27,721
Yeah,

1559
00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:28,050
it's,

1560
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:28,770
it's weird.

1561
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,450
But that's the only way you're
going to get a cell phone.

1562
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,190
They don't know if there's no other way.

1563
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:33,024
I mean,

1564
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,160
they've tried to figure

1565
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,821
out how to,

1566
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:35,060
you know,

1567
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,900
make them in other countries.

1568
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:38,180
And I know they started
making iPhones in Brazil.

1569
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,010
They make some stuff in Korea,

1570
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,270
South Korea where they,

1571
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:41,511
you know,

1572
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:41,930
they don't,

1573
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:44,850
they don't have anything remotely like a,

1574
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,370
what they got going on in China.

1575
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,740
Would you ever hire Foxcom
for like a small job,

1576
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,660
like stuffing envelopes
or something like that?

1577
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:54,020
Because lately I was wondering really
how cheap it would be if I just had them

1578
00:41:54,021 --> 00:41:55,130
do like small things.

1579
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:55,900
I A lot,

1580
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,300
there's a lot of that
started factories in China.

1581
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,050
Um,

1582
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,530
and they started factories in China.

1583
00:42:01,531 --> 00:42:05,310
Like I know a dude who makes pool cue
cases out there and he lives in China.

1584
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,480
Yeah,

1585
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,050
I guess,

1586
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,160
I don't know why you decided,

1587
00:42:08,161 --> 00:42:09,600
but he's an American guy and they,

1588
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:09,991
you know,

1589
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:10,320
they'll,

1590
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,300
their manufacturing is like good out
there and get good skilled craftsmen and

1591
00:42:15,301 --> 00:42:15,601
you know,

1592
00:42:15,601 --> 00:42:17,190
it's a way cheaper for them and they,

1593
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,900
they can make a ton of profit,

1594
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:19,591
you know?

1595
00:42:19,591 --> 00:42:22,020
And I think a lot of them get over
there and they actually like it too,

1596
00:42:22,021 --> 00:42:22,854
so

1597
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,331
I don't know.

1598
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:25,080
But it's,

1599
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:25,440
I don't,

1600
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,273
I just don't,

1601
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:27,991
yeah,

1602
00:42:27,991 --> 00:42:28,830
we like living in China.

1603
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,120
I think a lot of white guys do.

1604
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,910
If I've talked to a bunch of white

1605
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,190
guys that have been to China and
they say that Chinese girls like,

1606
00:42:35,191 --> 00:42:35,551
Whoa,

1607
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:36,211
this is weird.

1608
00:42:36,211 --> 00:42:36,841
Look at this white guy.

1609
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:37,670
I like him.

1610
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,930
I think it makes sense.

1611
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,500
I think like all dudes are going
to wind up with Asian chicks.

1612
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,100
Really?

1613
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,430
Yeah.

1614
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:46,640
Like how many dudes have
you lost the Asian chicks?

1615
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,953
Um,

1616
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,750
well I haven't lost anybody but no,

1617
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,620
no one,

1618
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:51,771
no.

1619
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:55,070
But one guy that I dated for
like years is engaged to,

1620
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:55,490
well she's,

1621
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,121
she's Indian,

1622
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:56,890
but that's Asia.

1623
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:57,020
Yeah.

1624
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,100
But um,

1625
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,911
it makes sense.

1626
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:03,620
Like there was like a whole wave of like
black chicks being like white women are

1627
00:43:03,621 --> 00:43:03,951
taking,

1628
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:06,320
are men and they like
have asses or something.

1629
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,310
Uh,

1630
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:09,170
but now it's like,

1631
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,490
I don't think we're a real threat,

1632
00:43:10,491 --> 00:43:12,060
I think is Asian chick is where,

1633
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,070
but he's going to wind down,

1634
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,150
it's like going back to an
iPhone three do an iPhone five

1635
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:15,711
yeah,

1636
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:15,971
it's a,

1637
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:16,581
I have nothing.

1638
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:17,950
I can't compete with an Asian chick.

1639
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:20,820
There is nothing grosser
than that white woman,

1640
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,500
white women are taken are men

1641
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,463
attitude.

1642
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,900
You can't like who the fuck you like in
the black eyes are supposed to like you

1643
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,790
supposed to like you more.

1644
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:36,270
That attitude is the very reason why
white girls are preferred by those black

1645
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:43,201
guys because white girls aren't going
to be as crazy angry and you know,

1646
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,320
why does mother fucking
time to go out with my time

1647
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:46,920
flag being mad like,

1648
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:48,690
oh if the card pulled up more,

1649
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:51,780
I could've parked like somebody else
would have still gotten that space.

1650
00:43:51,781 --> 00:43:53,240
Like that black guy does not want you

1651
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:58,330
regardless of what race is happening
opened that racism is in the in comparison

1652
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:00,470
to the other way around.

1653
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:02,130
Don't they know we've
done that with so much.

1654
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,520
If it was the other way around and people,

1655
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:04,970
you know,

1656
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,000
if it was a bunch of,

1657
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:06,630
uh,

1658
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:06,900
uh,

1659
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,270
white girls that were complaining that
some girls getting fucked by a black guy,

1660
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:11,800
yeah.

1661
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:12,260
You know,

1662
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,130
that would be,

1663
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,023
you know,

1664
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,390
there'll be a completely different things
and that would be like KKK and this is

1665
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:17,750
like,

1666
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:18,440
you know,

1667
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:18,950
hey Chris,

1668
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:19,783
it's interesting that it's,

1669
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,020
you can say like,

1670
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:22,580
why are these white women got up?

1671
00:44:22,581 --> 00:44:23,414
Fuck on man.

1672
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,040
You can say that you were a black charger.

1673
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,160
I do think with,

1674
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:26,490
um,

1675
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,710
I have no anger about
the Asian chick thing,

1676
00:44:28,711 --> 00:44:29,640
but I do think,

1677
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,090
um,

1678
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:30,461
like I'm,

1679
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:31,230
I'm half,

1680
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:36,230
but it makes sense like the
guy's gravitating toward
them because just the way

1681
00:44:36,961 --> 00:44:37,471
it used to be,

1682
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:40,380
like you used to be
with a man because like,

1683
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:42,340
he made a living and you,

1684
00:44:42,341 --> 00:44:44,070
you kind of needed him and
you looked at him like,

1685
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:44,933
I need you,

1686
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,590
uh,

1687
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,400
and easy lowered your voice.

1688
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,290
I feel like that's how like women talk.

1689
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:49,800
They're just like,

1690
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,371
I love you.

1691
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:51,204
Do you want dinner?

1692
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:52,200
Um,

1693
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:52,471
you know,

1694
00:44:52,471 --> 00:44:52,921
I'm like,

1695
00:44:52,921 --> 00:44:53,251
well,

1696
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:54,090
what about me?

1697
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:54,960
Uh,

1698
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,940
but it checks,

1699
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:56,251
you know,

1700
00:44:56,251 --> 00:44:56,970
like there's,

1701
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:57,781
they're from Asia,

1702
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:58,614
this isn't there,

1703
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,570
this isn't their first language.

1704
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,560
And they come here and they kind of
need you and they're like quiet and they

1705
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:05,760
like have smaller pussies.

1706
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:06,470
Oh,

1707
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,800
so what is really small?

1708
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,663
What am I,

1709
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,810
what am I going to do?

1710
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,711
Bring to the table.

1711
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:13,380
I've gotten zero like I've gotten here,

1712
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,201
like getting happy.

1713
00:45:14,201 --> 00:45:14,820
You're like,

1714
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,110
I need an Asian chick.

1715
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:18,390
This Asian girl in high school,

1716
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:19,320
her name was,

1717
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,310
I don't know if I should say there's now,

1718
00:45:20,311 --> 00:45:21,580
her name was [inaudible],

1719
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:26,040
which was also a video game company
in the 90s which so she's awesome.

1720
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:26,670
Her name,

1721
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:26,970
uh,

1722
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,190
because he's what he
was trying to find her.

1723
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:30,980
You want her back in
his life because I've,

1724
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:32,730
maybe I've changed it
to a different video.

1725
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:33,564
Came back,

1726
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,040
it was a pocket,

1727
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,041
it was a,

1728
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:40,200
it was a video game company that was
popular in the nineties so name was donkey

1729
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:41,034
Kong notice.

1730
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,820
But all the boys are boys.

1731
00:45:44,821 --> 00:45:48,570
The guys liked her because of video games
were really popular in the 90s so she

1732
00:45:48,571 --> 00:45:50,610
had did like this extra
kind of glow to her.

1733
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,590
And people because of her name.

1734
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,473
Yeah.

1735
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,433
She told me,

1736
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,530
she told me once,

1737
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,170
I grew up in a test city.

1738
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:00,263
Yeah.

1739
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,570
The government has literally,

1740
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:04,270
he literally would test this year.

1741
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:05,530
It's true.

1742
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,190
Test Him and I'm pretty sure
a parts of his life were um,

1743
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,330
actually artificially
created by the government.

1744
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:11,950
Yeah.

1745
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:12,400
Angel.

1746
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,370
A lot about you.

1747
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:13,581
Yeah.

1748
00:46:13,581 --> 00:46:14,780
He's like a test subject.

1749
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:19,920
He got cereal that no one else
got failing the test right now.

1750
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,013
There's no failing.

1751
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,140
He is what he is.

1752
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,480
You can't have fell out all.

1753
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:24,650
Look how sweet you are with them.

1754
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,011
That's true.

1755
00:46:25,011 --> 00:46:25,850
You can't fail that test.

1756
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,181
They cheat.

1757
00:46:26,181 --> 00:46:27,860
The government just wants to
know what's going on in there.

1758
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:29,920
[inaudible] told me that,

1759
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,810
that they're pussies
are tighter because we,

1760
00:46:31,811 --> 00:46:36,430
they kneel all day cause the
kneel tightens up the pussy.

1761
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:36,911
Did you guys,

1762
00:46:36,911 --> 00:46:40,210
do you mind if I do the wo
wrestle this show from a dope

1763
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,960
we calling under our desk
trying to tie number two.

1764
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:46,120
You might just take a quick,

1765
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:47,650
can we just move this mic down?

1766
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,220
Nope.

1767
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:48,701
Uh,

1768
00:46:48,701 --> 00:46:49,091
yeah.

1769
00:46:49,091 --> 00:46:50,860
I don't think you imagine
if that's all you had to do.

1770
00:46:50,861 --> 00:46:54,240
And women just found that out so
they started kneeling for the banks.

1771
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,110
Every bit I'm on the subway like,

1772
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:56,460
oh no,

1773
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,293
I don't need to seat,

1774
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:58,450
just try to keep Bob happy.

1775
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,190
It'd be like a big joke.

1776
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:00,550
Yeah.

1777
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:01,600
You wouldn't be able to hide it.

1778
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:03,530
You know if feel like
when you get fake clear,

1779
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,260
you can't pretend you
didn't get fake tits.

1780
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,390
So one day your flat and
the next day the huge,

1781
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:07,961
hey,

1782
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:09,430
I'm just trying to keep my husband happy.

1783
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:09,761
Yeah.

1784
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:11,650
It's the same thing Neil everywhere.

1785
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:12,311
I don't know.

1786
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:12,911
Is that what it is?

1787
00:47:12,911 --> 00:47:13,121
I don't know.

1788
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:13,480
I don't,

1789
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,530
there's a lot of different reasons.

1790
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:15,760
I'm sure I'm forgetting implants.

1791
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:16,380
Yeah.

1792
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,080
Oh God.

1793
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:17,801
I'm not doing it.

1794
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:20,110
I think I'm never going
to get any work done.

1795
00:47:20,111 --> 00:47:21,100
We're going to get any work done.

1796
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:21,963
No.

1797
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:22,600
Um,

1798
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,433
you don't need to,

1799
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:25,060
I mean like I,

1800
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:25,911
I drank,

1801
00:47:25,911 --> 00:47:27,500
so I'm probably gonna age like dog shit,

1802
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:28,910
but I'm just going to let you and hit the,

1803
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:29,771
yeah,

1804
00:47:29,771 --> 00:47:30,010
you got

1805
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,950
to just let it ride.

1806
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:32,020
Tara Reid style.

1807
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,670
Maybe shave off a little
off your shoulders.

1808
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:35,790
You like,

1809
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,740
it looks like you got those
things in like a suit jacket.

1810
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:39,574
The cushions,

1811
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:40,463
but in your shoulder.

1812
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:41,560
Yeah.

1813
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,393
It looks like what?

1814
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:42,640
Yeah.

1815
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,450
What are they called?

1816
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:44,350
The shoulder pads.

1817
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,700
It looks like you have shoulder
pads on your shoulders,

1818
00:47:45,701 --> 00:47:47,320
so maybe just get a little bit
of shaved off for it there.

1819
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:47,441
Oh,

1820
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:48,460
I play volleyball.

1821
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,061
Oh,

1822
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:51,190
that told her to get
her shoulder shaved off.

1823
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:52,091
Can you manage it?

1824
00:47:52,091 --> 00:47:52,930
If it was that easy?

1825
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:54,640
It's like you've got too much muscle here.

1826
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:56,030
It was just that carved this away.

1827
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:57,190
Ooh.

1828
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,590
Can you imagine like to your body.

1829
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,550
I know I played volleyball
and I think that it,

1830
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,283
I like how I look.

1831
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:06,683
Eat a dick.

1832
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:07,623
I was just kidding.

1833
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:09,261
All right.

1834
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,094
Brian doesn't,

1835
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:13,960
he doesn't like to be around women that
he's pretty sure could kick his ass.

1836
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,340
That's really what fucks him up.

1837
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:16,990
We had Ronda Rousey in here.

1838
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:17,980
She know who she is.

1839
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,410
Strikeforce women's MMA champion.

1840
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:21,010
Oh Shit.

1841
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,900
She's a beast and Brian

1842
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:26,920
scared to give her a hug and she's like,

1843
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:27,610
get over yard.

1844
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:28,443
I won't buy it.

1845
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,620
I used to do it at the end,

1846
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:34,390
like a proper gentleman at the beginning.

1847
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:35,224
I don't do hug

1848
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,240
her.

1849
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,310
He was so cute.

1850
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:40,691
It was adorable.

1851
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:42,070
He was so terrified of her.

1852
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,920
It was like he was in the room
with a tiger that he wanted a pet,

1853
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,090
but he was too scared to

1854
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:48,580
Rhonda,

1855
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:48,911
by the way,

1856
00:48:48,911 --> 00:48:50,080
one of the coolest fucking people.

1857
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:52,060
She's strikingly beautiful.

1858
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,213
She's gorgeous.

1859
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:00,430
She's not even a debate.

1860
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,980
She's a 10 yeah,

1861
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:03,460
and she's a killer.

1862
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,820
She was a a a women's
Olympic judo medalist.

1863
00:49:06,821 --> 00:49:09,190
She meddled in the Olympics.

1864
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:13,120
I think she was the first woman to
ever win a medal in the Olympics.

1865
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:13,954
In judo.

1866
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,770
No.

1867
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,100
Nobody busted a move.

1868
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:19,840
Well,

1869
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:23,890
I'm married and Brian is
terrified of her naked or not.

1870
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,260
Eddie Bravo's getting

1871
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:30,480
her in her underwear so we can
see what's she's hot as fuck.

1872
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:32,463
That's a killer.

1873
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,120
Do what's that press conference she broke?

1874
00:49:40,121 --> 00:49:41,060
The girls are,

1875
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:41,894
and when their last fight

1876
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,690
the girl didn't tap and
so she snapped her arm.

1877
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:50,151
She's young.

1878
00:49:50,151 --> 00:49:51,140
She's only 25

1879
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,150
that's not her either.

1880
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:01,333
That's

1881
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:10,680
a killer.

1882
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,513
Grow.

1883
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:13,210
Go down to that picture,

1884
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:14,044
dude.

1885
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,010
Are you going to do a video?

1886
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:21,280
I don't think you've got to
find the video highlight reel.

1887
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:27,830
I love her.

1888
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:29,241
What a nightmare.

1889
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:30,850
A hot chick that could
beat the fuck out of.

1890
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,670
When is she coming back on Joe?

1891
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:33,960
We'll work on something.

1892
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,120
She just won the title.

1893
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,460
I'd like to do this stuff.

1894
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:40,420
We'll do this

1895
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:41,383
snap.

1896
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:42,923
I don't watch this.

1897
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,310
She brought,

1898
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:45,830
she's broken a couple of girls arms.

1899
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:48,970
I'm just going to look
at you Amy and started.

1900
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:49,500
We're lucky,

1901
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,070
right?

1902
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:53,720
It's why you are fries when a Shitty,

1903
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,183
she's a beast.

1904
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,150
She is.

1905
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:58,230
I love her.

1906
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,920
She's a bad ass it fucking jail.

1907
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:04,101
Whoa.

1908
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:07,610
Look at that and this is
in the Song Song Austin,

1909
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:07,881
isn't it?

1910
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:08,031
No,

1911
00:51:08,031 --> 00:51:09,710
it's not you asshole.

1912
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,110
She actually filmed and edited this,

1913
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,160
these arm bars.

1914
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,970
This is nasty shit.

1915
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,260
See in in judo they stand you up way
quicker than they do in MMA or even in

1916
00:51:19,261 --> 00:51:21,720
Jujitsu though they don't really
stand you up usually Jujitsu,

1917
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:22,210
but in,

1918
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:26,640
in judo they have to go for
their submissions really
quickly because once they

1919
00:51:26,641 --> 00:51:27,660
get to the ground they got to get,

1920
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:31,410
they've got to get a submission on
before the referee gets to them and she

1921
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:36,240
developed the ability to snap armbars
bars on people with lightening speed and I

1922
00:51:36,241 --> 00:51:38,280
don't think any of these
girls are ready for that shit.

1923
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:39,323
They just,

1924
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,860
she's so good at it.

1925
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,800
Everybody else takes way
more time to go for shit.

1926
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:48,420
She's just got a few techniques like
especially armbars just completely locked

1927
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:50,040
down and when you roll with her,

1928
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:53,250
it's almost just a matter of time before
she gets one of those on you because

1929
00:51:53,251 --> 00:51:57,720
you're probably not used to anybody having
the kind of submissions that she has

1930
00:51:57,721 --> 00:51:58,500
where they just,

1931
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,880
she explodes on you.

1932
00:51:59,881 --> 00:52:02,230
She's strong as fuck and
she's super tactical.

1933
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,091
Look at that arm bar you see,

1934
00:52:03,091 --> 00:52:04,180
how do you see how,

1935
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:04,651
watch that,

1936
00:52:04,651 --> 00:52:05,970
but just back that up a second.

1937
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:11,100
This is like no space in between her
body and that girls face as she moves

1938
00:52:11,101 --> 00:52:11,670
around.

1939
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,260
When she locks this chick down,

1940
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,270
she starts beating on her and
as soon as she has this song,

1941
00:52:15,271 --> 00:52:15,601
what's that?

1942
00:52:15,601 --> 00:52:16,550
See how fast that goes.

1943
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:16,890
Yeah.

1944
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:18,800
She swung that leg over fish.

1945
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:20,880
She knew exactly where her face was,

1946
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,230
clamped that shit down.

1947
00:52:22,231 --> 00:52:23,580
There was no air in there.

1948
00:52:23,581 --> 00:52:24,570
That was death.

1949
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,740
There was no getting out.

1950
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:27,510
I just think she's really pouty lips.

1951
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:28,290
Yeah.

1952
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:29,310
She wanted to make out with you,

1953
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,690
which you go last boat for a little bit.

1954
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:31,170
Yes.

1955
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:31,710
Yeah.

1956
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:32,340
You would?

1957
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:32,940
Yeah.

1958
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,773
Wow.

1959
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:35,243
I think you'd have to.

1960
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:35,851
Yeah.

1961
00:52:35,851 --> 00:52:35,941
I,

1962
00:52:35,941 --> 00:52:37,110
I've never worked with a girl,

1963
00:52:37,111 --> 00:52:38,640
but I get like major girl crushes.

1964
00:52:38,641 --> 00:52:38,880
I.

1965
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,320
I've never hooked up with a girl.

1966
00:52:40,321 --> 00:52:41,430
But you're opening up your idea.

1967
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:42,150
Do you want to,

1968
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:44,340
I hope I'm like at least
hook up with a girl,

1969
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,320
but at least once I can arrange that.

1970
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,020
Like the hottest girl ever.

1971
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:49,710
I can let you choose from a book.

1972
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:49,981
No,

1973
00:52:49,981 --> 00:52:50,814
I like girls.

1974
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,140
I'm going to get crabs.

1975
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,673
Oh yeah.

1976
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:55,540
Whatever he's going,

1977
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,400
Mr Lobster.

1978
00:52:56,401 --> 00:52:56,850
Brian,

1979
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,050
I'm not going to use that money.

1980
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,310
All you can eat me.

1981
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:02,880
You're not setting me up with anybody.

1982
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:03,451
Yeah,

1983
00:53:03,451 --> 00:53:04,290
I would say no.

1984
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:05,010
Don't want to do that.

1985
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:05,280
No,

1986
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,390
that's not happening to me.

1987
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,224
I'm your filter.

1988
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:08,460
I'm going to just be real with you.

1989
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:09,910
I'm going to be real with you.

1990
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,540
Either of you at all.

1991
00:53:12,541 --> 00:53:13,740
Do you want to go camping this weekend?

1992
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:14,430
A little bit.

1993
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:15,001
The ones who got you?

1994
00:53:15,001 --> 00:53:15,211
Hi.

1995
00:53:15,211 --> 00:53:16,170
How can I remember?

1996
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,070
I remember being like,

1997
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:17,730
I just had it.

1998
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,370
I saw the bruise from the IB in
my arm and you guys were like,

1999
00:53:20,371 --> 00:53:21,540
you need this?

2000
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,291
And I was like,

2001
00:53:22,291 --> 00:53:22,561
no,

2002
00:53:22,561 --> 00:53:22,861
and I,

2003
00:53:22,861 --> 00:53:25,830
and then I said yes right before
you blew all the in my face.

2004
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,810
I could tell you were getting into that.

2005
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:28,501
I was like,

2006
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:31,070
just give it to me and
don't blow this smiley face.

2007
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:33,180
You guys are the worst,

2008
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:33,700
right?

2009
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,321
Aren't you glad you did?

2010
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:34,771
It felt good,

2011
00:53:34,771 --> 00:53:35,010
right?

2012
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:36,450
You don't feel sick or anything?

2013
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:36,631
No.

2014
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:37,190
I feel fine.

2015
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:40,470
This weed is so strong that we hotbox
Fitzsimmons back here and he went on stage

2016
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:41,870
high and he couldn't remember his act.

2017
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:42,031
Oh,

2018
00:53:42,031 --> 00:53:42,811
I would love to see him.

2019
00:53:42,811 --> 00:53:43,290
Hi.

2020
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:43,650
Was He,

2021
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:44,371
did you see it?

2022
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:44,520
Huh?

2023
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:44,781
Yeah,

2024
00:53:44,781 --> 00:53:46,110
I've been how it Greg before?

2025
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:46,800
Let me see.

2026
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,180
He's essentially,

2027
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:49,320
I don't know if he talks about,

2028
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:51,420
I know he was smoking
pot for a little while,

2029
00:53:51,421 --> 00:53:52,590
but then he stopped doing that too.

2030
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:53,270
But he,

2031
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:53,881
he went for,

2032
00:53:53,881 --> 00:53:54,571
when I met him,

2033
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:58,560
he was an alcoholic when we were
like 21 together and then he,

2034
00:53:58,561 --> 00:53:59,100
um,

2035
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,500
he quit it like instantly
just cold Turkey.

2036
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:02,370
Wow.

2037
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:02,760
Yeah.

2038
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:03,840
No Aa.

2039
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,910
Did he have something happen?

2040
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,180
No,

2041
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,020
I just decided to,

2042
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,340
this is fucking up his life.

2043
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:08,950
Yeah.

2044
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:09,870
It was pretty smart about it.

2045
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:12,360
But then later he realized that
he could smoke pot wherein,

2046
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:12,841
you know,

2047
00:54:12,841 --> 00:54:14,970
because if you talk to like
a doctor drew type character,

2048
00:54:14,971 --> 00:54:15,421
they'll tell you,

2049
00:54:15,421 --> 00:54:16,254
you can't do that.

2050
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:17,720
They'll tell you that you can't.

2051
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:18,280
What?

2052
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,113
Dalton.

2053
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:19,621
Dalton,

2054
00:54:19,621 --> 00:54:20,790
any substances.

2055
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,653
Yeah.

2056
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,790
But some people even have,

2057
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:24,150
uh,

2058
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:24,560
you know,

2059
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:24,720
look,

2060
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,060
I don't want to ever encourage
anybody to even try this,

2061
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,300
but I know that some people
used to be alcoholics,

2062
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,370
took a long time off drinking
and then began drinking casually.

2063
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:34,870
Really?

2064
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:35,703
Yes.

2065
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,870
Nobody have done it well,

2066
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:37,410
yeah.

2067
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:38,190
Well I think so.

2068
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,590
I think there's different
levels of alcoholism.

2069
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:41,520
That's what we have to realize.

2070
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:45,480
There's some physiological connections.

2071
00:54:45,481 --> 00:54:46,680
Like there's some people,

2072
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:48,330
they just have that gene,

2073
00:54:48,331 --> 00:54:51,120
whatever that wacky gene is
and they can't drink at all.

2074
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,530
Or they will go off,

2075
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,520
they'll go off the rails.

2076
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,050
And then there's other folks that,

2077
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:58,170
it was a compulsion and it
could have been beating off,

2078
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:00,060
it could have been gambling,

2079
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:02,130
it could have been a
million different things,

2080
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:03,270
but it happened to be drinking.

2081
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,770
And then they realize that this is a,

2082
00:55:05,771 --> 00:55:08,490
an issue that they have
with their own psychology.

2083
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:11,070
And then slowly over time they evolve it.

2084
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:14,100
And then one day they were at a party
and have a glass of wine and they're fine

2085
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,740
and they don't want to go out and
get cocaine and beat people up.

2086
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:17,574
And you know,

2087
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:18,090
why not?

2088
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,980
The Germans don't drink.

2089
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,510
So like because they are,

2090
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,050
you know,

2091
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:22,950
because they were too hard.

2092
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,521
And alcoholics.

2093
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:23,860
Yeah,

2094
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:24,270
yeah,

2095
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:24,481
yeah.

2096
00:55:24,481 --> 00:55:27,630
I feel like most of the time I'm
like the only comic drinking.

2097
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,111
Well,

2098
00:55:28,111 --> 00:55:29,910
I'm happy when I see
a guy like that's how,

2099
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:34,080
that's how it seems like
it's so focused now.

2100
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:34,943
Clean is,

2101
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,050
Norton has been cleaned
though since he was right.

2102
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,433
But I,

2103
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,470
I like very much likes with sermons.

2104
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:41,100
Really.

2105
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:41,900
Yeah.

2106
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,030
I worked with him a bunch of shit.

2107
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,271
I had never knew.

2108
00:55:45,271 --> 00:55:47,790
I never knew any of those guys
when they hurt were boozing.

2109
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:48,571
I wonder what,

2110
00:55:48,571 --> 00:55:49,980
even if I knew a tell a little bit,

2111
00:55:49,981 --> 00:55:53,370
but I never like saw him like
wasted or anything like that.

2112
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:53,551
Yeah.

2113
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:54,384
I've seen him wasted.

2114
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,620
I've seen him wasted at the Improv.

2115
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:55,831
Yeah,

2116
00:55:55,831 --> 00:55:56,011
it was,

2117
00:55:56,011 --> 00:55:58,290
it's nice to see a guy figure out,

2118
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,730
well this is not good for me.

2119
00:55:59,731 --> 00:55:59,980
Yeah.

2120
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:03,390
That's probably better to not take
this back on that up in an alley.

2121
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:04,081
Yeah.

2122
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:04,920
I've always been,

2123
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,310
even when I was a drinker,

2124
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:08,641
you know,

2125
00:56:08,641 --> 00:56:09,150
like when I,

2126
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,870
when I didn't smoke pot and I only would,

2127
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:11,550
you know,

2128
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,050
drink on weekends or whatever I would do,

2129
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,540
it was never something
that I had to do and just,

2130
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:16,860
yeah.

2131
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:17,880
Could do it or not do it.

2132
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,300
Yeah.

2133
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,070
But we all know somebody
that's not like that.

2134
00:56:20,071 --> 00:56:22,600
We all know that one dude that's
just itching for that drink all,

2135
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,160
it's fun to be around them.

2136
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:26,120
Worse when they get off and then they,

2137
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:26,560
they,

2138
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,180
they start drinking like right away

2139
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,660
and they don't realize that
it's not like that for you.

2140
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:31,020
All right.

2141
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:31,411
You know,

2142
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:32,190
like I,

2143
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:34,800
my friend who who is now sober,

2144
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,450
like we would go out and you'd be like,

2145
00:56:36,451 --> 00:56:37,350
let's get a shot and a beer.

2146
00:56:37,351 --> 00:56:37,741
And I'd be like,

2147
00:56:37,741 --> 00:56:38,550
okay.

2148
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:39,930
And then right away he's like,

2149
00:56:39,931 --> 00:56:40,320
all right,

2150
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:40,921
no shot.

2151
00:56:40,921 --> 00:56:41,400
And you're like,

2152
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:41,911
oh,

2153
00:56:41,911 --> 00:56:43,290
drinking is different for us.

2154
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,660
I'm not going to shock people.

2155
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:45,930
I didn't want to do a shot.

2156
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,880
Especially on Tuesdays.

2157
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:48,743
Yeah.

2158
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:49,921
Tuesday,

2159
00:56:49,921 --> 00:56:50,520
drunks.

2160
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:50,821
That's,

2161
00:56:50,821 --> 00:56:51,360
that's uh,

2162
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:51,840
you know,

2163
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,900
I'm more of a light beer
Miller lite drinker,

2164
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:55,171
you know,

2165
00:56:55,171 --> 00:56:56,490
like I'll just drink like,

2166
00:56:56,491 --> 00:56:57,840
it's almost like water,

2167
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,321
you know,

2168
00:56:58,321 --> 00:56:59,154
to me.

2169
00:56:59,260 --> 00:56:59,650
Yeah.

2170
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:00,483
It's just like,

2171
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,010
I'm like a beer at west.

2172
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:02,780
I like

2173
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:05,960
doing shots too and we'd have shows
and stuff and we're just all being,

2174
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:06,440
you know,

2175
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,180
hanging out around the other one out.

2176
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,740
But just drinking for
the sake of drinking.

2177
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,510
I kind of got tired of
that a long time ago.

2178
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:15,140
You know drinking does facilitate
great conversation though.

2179
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,200
You have some fucking fun
loose conversations when
you're around a bunch of

2180
00:57:20,331 --> 00:57:22,070
people that can handle
the handle their liquor.

2181
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:25,500
You know you have three or four beers
and everybody starts laughing and it'd be

2182
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:28,810
unfriendly as long as you're
only around that right

2183
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:30,530
person in the mix.

2184
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,730
That's just like,

2185
00:57:31,731 --> 00:57:34,490
just has that kind of
Zombie just difference.

2186
00:57:34,491 --> 00:57:34,970
It's,

2187
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:36,650
it ruins it like I am,

2188
00:57:36,651 --> 00:57:40,700
we're so sensitive to
other people's energy.

2189
00:57:40,701 --> 00:57:41,061
Yeah.

2190
00:57:41,061 --> 00:57:45,170
That if there's that one person and it's
also the same kind of pre people where

2191
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:46,640
it's just like never enough for them.

2192
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:49,180
You'll be out till four in the morning
and you're like all right and they're

2193
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,540
like you're leaving now.

2194
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:51,710
You're like,

2195
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:53,600
yeah cause I'm like an adult.

2196
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,160
I'm trying to live my life.

2197
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:55,911
Yeah.

2198
00:57:55,911 --> 00:58:00,500
I really don't like the really pushy
five o'clock in the morning party people

2199
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,970
does an after hours.

2200
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:04,970
I've been doing that lately
though like last week or so.

2201
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,240
But it's just comedy store
shit cause comedy store,

2202
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:10,310
they go rock and all night long.

2203
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:13,880
Don Buress is on stage just
doing crazy shit once in a while.

2204
00:58:13,881 --> 00:58:14,714
I think that's fun.

2205
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:15,050
Yeah.

2206
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:15,321
Yeah.

2207
00:58:15,321 --> 00:58:16,130
But,

2208
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:16,963
but I don't know

2209
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,230
best part about the comedy store.

2210
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:18,531
Yeah.

2211
00:58:18,531 --> 00:58:19,130
Late night.

2212
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,300
Hang in that back parking lot.

2213
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:20,960
Yeah.

2214
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,180
And they said that back parking
lot should be a goddamn satcom.

2215
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:23,681
It should.

2216
00:58:23,681 --> 00:58:23,750
Yeah.

2217
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:23,960
Yeah.

2218
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:24,691
Is it the comedy store,

2219
00:58:24,691 --> 00:58:25,440
like the seller,

2220
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,670
like it's a work comics or not really is

2221
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,190
the ownership is a mass
people running in our mass,

2222
00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:30,610
but the,

2223
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:30,981
the what,

2224
00:58:30,981 --> 00:58:32,170
what the place is though,

2225
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:33,460
what it represents is like,

2226
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:34,330
you know what I mean?

2227
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:36,460
One of the oldest clubs in the country,

2228
00:58:36,461 --> 00:58:40,990
one of the oldest in Hollywood and with
great history of like so many comedians,

2229
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,850
so many of comedians started out there.

2230
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,600
And I,

2231
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,670
I started out there really,

2232
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:44,981
I mean,

2233
00:58:44,981 --> 00:58:45,970
I didn't start out there,

2234
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:46,900
but I got good there.

2235
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,490
That's where I became a real comedian,

2236
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:50,380
the comedy store for sure.

2237
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,030
I had done it before that,

2238
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:52,541
but,

2239
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:53,374
uh,

2240
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:58,930
I think it was my time at the comedy
store when I was just on TV when I,

2241
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,450
when I really started
dedicated myself to stand up,

2242
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:03,370
that that was the,

2243
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,910
that's the place that helped me
develop cause it's so fucked up there.

2244
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,550
Ari and I were just talking
about this last night that,

2245
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:09,850
um,

2246
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:10,091
you know,

2247
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:11,830
he was talking about
how he just started a,

2248
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:14,740
Ari's got like a Arash fears
all these headline and gigs.

2249
00:59:14,741 --> 00:59:17,080
Now he's fucking selling places
out and he's really good.

2250
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:17,860
This podcast.

2251
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:18,171
Yeah.

2252
00:59:18,171 --> 00:59:18,400
Yeah.

2253
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,800
It's because of this
podcast and his podcast.

2254
00:59:20,801 --> 00:59:22,220
It's just really what it was,

2255
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,080
is just people weren't aware of them.

2256
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:24,261
Right.

2257
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:24,531
You know,

2258
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:26,300
and now they're aware of them now.

2259
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:27,230
And uh,

2260
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,610
I talked about him with,

2261
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,091
I'm like,

2262
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:31,790
it's so good that it's happening to you
now because you've been doing standup

2263
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:32,840
for 10 years.

2264
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:33,620
Yeah.

2265
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:34,191
He's ready.

2266
00:59:34,191 --> 00:59:37,520
And he's being in front of
the craziest crowds ever.

2267
00:59:37,521 --> 00:59:39,200
He's been in front of my crowds,

2268
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,840
which are like UFC fans.

2269
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:42,351
It was,

2270
00:59:42,351 --> 00:59:46,040
first it was UFC fans then became
podcast fans were just fucking savages,

2271
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:46,911
you know.

2272
00:59:46,911 --> 00:59:47,101
And,

2273
00:59:47,101 --> 00:59:48,680
and then it's the store.

2274
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:50,660
He's at the store in front of maniacs.

2275
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:51,350
I mean it's the,

2276
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:52,121
that is like the,

2277
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:53,840
the vortex on sunset.

2278
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:56,270
We're all the nutty fucking people come.

2279
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:57,104
I mean Brian,

2280
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:00,580
Brian used to film people
backstage and that we,

2281
01:00:00,581 --> 01:00:02,690
we filmed like a hooker,

2282
01:00:02,691 --> 01:00:04,270
came back and told her exactly,

2283
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:08,600
told us exactly how she ran her business
and like explain some stuff that we had

2284
01:00:08,601 --> 01:00:11,270
a guy come back that told
us he was the Holy Spirit.

2285
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:15,630
I mean like every week we'd meet some
new fucking crazy person in that.

2286
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,230
They're really crazy.

2287
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:22,640
That sunset strip is the epicenter
of crazy in this country.

2288
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:23,810
That's sunset strip.

2289
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:24,620
There was a deer.

2290
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,240
Scary difference to the dude.

2291
01:00:26,241 --> 01:00:28,340
It's at the store that
comes by with the cross.

2292
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:29,780
He puts himself

2293
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:30,440
cross.

2294
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:30,830
He's not,

2295
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:31,700
he doesn't come around anymore.

2296
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:33,830
Now we actually have a way better Jesus.

2297
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:34,400
Oh,

2298
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,330
he's a nice guy.

2299
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:36,141
I Hollywood,

2300
01:00:36,141 --> 01:00:36,974
Jesus.

2301
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:38,780
He did a Hollywood Jesus.

2302
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:39,471
He would,

2303
01:00:39,471 --> 01:00:39,740
they would,

2304
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:43,760
they would have these kids and they
would all be like yelling out different

2305
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:49,440
passages in the Bible while one guy was
strapped to a cross of wooden cross.

2306
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:51,960
And they were walking down
the street with him saying,

2307
01:00:51,961 --> 01:00:53,130
he died for your sins.

2308
01:00:53,131 --> 01:00:53,631
He died for,

2309
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,740
it was fucking crazy.

2310
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,760
And they would always stop right in
front of the store and proselytize.

2311
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:00,960
They would stop right there.

2312
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:01,210
It would

2313
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:01,451
figure,

2314
01:01:01,451 --> 01:01:01,571
well,

2315
01:01:01,571 --> 01:01:03,490
this is the place that we're
going to fix the world right here.

2316
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:05,880
We're going to find these
fucking dirty comedians.

2317
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:08,530
Pot the worst.

2318
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:08,810
Yeah,

2319
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:09,970
the worst entertainers,

2320
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:13,150
the most depraved
entertainers in la for sure.

2321
01:01:13,151 --> 01:01:17,210
Standup comedians at the store
and they would stop by and yeah,

2322
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:17,610
it was,

2323
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:18,371
it was a really,

2324
01:01:18,371 --> 01:01:19,390
really bizarre place.

2325
01:01:19,391 --> 01:01:20,770
It would have made for an amazing,

2326
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:21,370
uh,

2327
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:22,840
they tried to do a reality show on it,

2328
01:01:22,841 --> 01:01:24,770
but it was mostly just
following Pauline around.

2329
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:26,050
It was harsh realities.

2330
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:27,753
Pauly shore.

2331
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:29,043
Remember him?

2332
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,550
I saw some last night.

2333
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:31,920
Did you see nice to you?

2334
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:32,853
Yeah.

2335
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,540
Did you guys hug or did
you just shake hands?

2336
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:36,190
Kiss on the lips.

2337
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:36,940
What'd you do?

2338
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:37,773
How'd you deal with it?

2339
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:39,063
Shake hands.

2340
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:40,150
Hug or shake hands.

2341
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:41,111
Shake.

2342
01:01:41,111 --> 01:01:41,890
Hands to hug.

2343
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:42,071
No,

2344
01:01:42,071 --> 01:01:43,090
I think I just said Hi.

2345
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:43,953
I don't even think,

2346
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:44,920
no touching.

2347
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,753
Ooh,

2348
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:48,160
maybe I don't remember though.

2349
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:49,810
I could be telling her you don't remember,

2350
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,950
you might've been raped again,

2351
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:51,960
I'm not thinking of it.

2352
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:52,810
You take a Dick,

2353
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:56,620
sometimes you have folks pick them up
in the middle of the night because he's

2354
01:01:56,621 --> 01:01:57,420
part of the,

2355
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,480
the Columbus thing.

2356
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:58,680
You,

2357
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:02,260
you leave Columbus but you never really
leave Columbus cause the aliens will

2358
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:04,600
come and do additional research on you.

2359
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:06,603
So that's Brian's.

2360
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:08,060
Yeah,

2361
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:08,890
exactly.

2362
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:10,900
Which I'll be there May 17th yeah.

2363
01:02:10,901 --> 01:02:12,150
You gotta be there with Joey Diaz?

2364
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:12,390
Yeah.

2365
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:15,040
It's a Joey Diaz and
Brian Red band world tour.

2366
01:02:15,170 --> 01:02:16,390
And when he gets out of the second show,

2367
01:02:16,391 --> 01:02:17,560
because the first show sold out,

2368
01:02:17,561 --> 01:02:18,394
so go to desktop.

2369
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,490
Can I smell a man selling

2370
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:21,323
out?

2371
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,373
Can I say,

2372
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:22,801
yeah,

2373
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:23,790
go ahead and say your thing.

2374
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:24,950
Well,

2375
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:25,650
I,

2376
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:26,910
I'm looking at my phone calendar.

2377
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,510
Your phone getting high and your website.

2378
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:29,960
Yeah,

2379
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,451
I've got it.

2380
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:31,040
Okay.

2381
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:34,230
It's hit Tampa next weekend and in Denver,

2382
01:02:34,231 --> 01:02:37,740
comedy works the weekend
of the 27th oh dude,

2383
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:38,550
you have a cool site.

2384
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:38,790
It's,

2385
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:42,240
you look at a black art and once a month,

2386
01:02:42,241 --> 01:02:43,530
this is my favorite
thing I've got going on.

2387
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:45,960
I'm at the Riviera at the starlight room.

2388
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:47,160
Uh,

2389
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:47,671
yeah.

2390
01:02:47,671 --> 01:02:48,481
I've got once a month.

2391
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:49,980
I'm there Friday,

2392
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:49,980
Saturday,

2393
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:50,180
Sunday.

2394
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:50,940
That's fun.

2395
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:51,480
I love,

2396
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:52,800
I'm like loving Vegas.

2397
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:53,341
Wow.

2398
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:54,174
That's crazy.

2399
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:56,010
Do you think you could be
like one of those like,

2400
01:02:56,011 --> 01:02:56,340
whoa.

2401
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:56,790
You know,

2402
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:59,400
I'm telling you what was a woman who,

2403
01:02:59,401 --> 01:02:59,830
um,

2404
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:00,451
it was the,

2405
01:03:00,451 --> 01:03:00,660
uh,

2406
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:01,493
Rita Rudner.

2407
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:02,850
Does she still have a thing there?

2408
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:05,910
I know she was always like,

2409
01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:06,691
kind of like,

2410
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:06,931
you know,

2411
01:03:06,931 --> 01:03:08,610
she was a headliner
and national headlines,

2412
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:11,040
but when she settled
down in Vegas and like,

2413
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,410
like only did a show at this one place,

2414
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:16,150
that's when I think she
started making crazy man.

2415
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:17,550
I'm loving the crowds,

2416
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:20,250
the riff so that we could do it.

2417
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:26,150
I've done two weekends already and it's
been great to do one weekend out of the

2418
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:26,760
month.

2419
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,840
I do one weekend a month.

2420
01:03:27,841 --> 01:03:29,160
It's me headlining.

2421
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:30,533
It's,

2422
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:33,750
they're starting their marketing as
Amy Schumer slaughterhouse and it's me,

2423
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:38,910
Jackie Monaghan and then one other
female comic like Nikki Glaser,

2424
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,020
Rachel Feinstein or,

2425
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:41,140
that's fucking awesome.

2426
01:03:41,141 --> 01:03:41,610
Yeah,

2427
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:42,630
it's a fun show.

2428
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:43,141
It's like the,

2429
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:44,790
it's like this old timey theater.

2430
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:45,480
Um,

2431
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:50,480
the starlight in the of every single
weekend marked off like what if something

2432
01:03:51,421 --> 01:03:52,140
comes up?

2433
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:55,800
But what if they've been cool
about I'm filming a special,

2434
01:03:55,801 --> 01:03:56,281
they were like,

2435
01:03:56,281 --> 01:03:56,910
no problem.

2436
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:57,780
Just change it.

2437
01:03:58,550 --> 01:03:58,860
Yeah.

2438
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:59,693
That's great.

2439
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:00,653
I love it.

2440
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,560
I'm loving it.

2441
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,520
So it's once a month.

2442
01:04:02,521 --> 01:04:04,600
Is it like the last weekend
of every month or something?

2443
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:09,360
Like it's kind of all over the map
so people can follow us on Twitter.

2444
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,670
[inaudible] on Twitter
or it'll be on my site.

2445
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,810
On your Twitter page.

2446
01:04:13,410 --> 01:04:13,891
Twitter page.

2447
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:14,640
Just for that show.

2448
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:15,091
Not yet,

2449
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:15,721
but there will be.

2450
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:16,201
She'll be right.

2451
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:16,711
It's like a new,

2452
01:04:16,711 --> 01:04:20,430
like it went really well the first two
weekends cause right now I'm splitting it

2453
01:04:20,431 --> 01:04:21,264
with dice.

2454
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:22,523
Oh,

2455
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:24,750
he's there to do the podcast.

2456
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:25,730
I've got to get,

2457
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:26,563
get a hold of him.

2458
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:31,780
He's there when I'm not there and
maybe like I think and Gilbert Godfried

2459
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:33,970
yet.

2460
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:34,510
But it's,

2461
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:35,101
it's been cool.

2462
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:37,110
I'm digging the shit out of Vegas.

2463
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:37,801
Wow.

2464
01:04:37,801 --> 01:04:38,634
That's crazy.

2465
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,170
You're going to be a Vegas girl.

2466
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:41,190
What do you dig about Vegas?

2467
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:41,821
The hookers.

2468
01:04:41,821 --> 01:04:42,654
The math.

2469
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:47,160
I don't like big crowds are like
people drinking for the first time.

2470
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,090
Um,

2471
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:48,923
but uh,

2472
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,910
like I really like the Sunday show.

2473
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:51,200
I've,

2474
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,030
I've been there a couple of days during
the week now in Vegas is very cool.

2475
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,650
Not on the weekends.

2476
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,231
Yeah.

2477
01:04:58,231 --> 01:05:00,450
Everyone is like very
chill and they're like,

2478
01:05:00,451 --> 01:05:00,661
okay,

2479
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:02,010
now we have our world back.

2480
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:02,840
Ah,

2481
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:03,150
yeah.

2482
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:04,500
It's a totally different vibe.

2483
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:05,334
It's really,

2484
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,220
it's like nice to crazy God damn city,

2485
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:12,930
crazy goddamn city to have a city where
everything stays open 24 hours a day.

2486
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,370
Strip clubs,

2487
01:05:14,371 --> 01:05:15,121
food,

2488
01:05:15,121 --> 01:05:15,930
booze,

2489
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:16,621
cabs.

2490
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:17,321
Keep moving,

2491
01:05:17,321 --> 01:05:18,010
stay up.

2492
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,880
You need coke.

2493
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:20,260
I got called everything.

2494
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:20,871
Boom,

2495
01:05:20,871 --> 01:05:21,470
boom.

2496
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:22,630
And then even know I needed that.

2497
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:23,530
Yeah.

2498
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:25,090
You didn't even know you
need until you got it right.

2499
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:26,650
We're a tranny.

2500
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:27,700
Norton can move there.

2501
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:28,031
No,

2502
01:05:28,031 --> 01:05:28,750
I uh,

2503
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:29,860
but it's like every night,

2504
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:30,760
all the girls,

2505
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:31,450
like,

2506
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:32,380
they're all like,

2507
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:37,000
these young girls squeezed into these
tube dresses and the Kiehl's are so crazy.

2508
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:38,170
They're just walking like,

2509
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:38,890
ah,

2510
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:40,330
they look so comfortable.

2511
01:05:40,331 --> 01:05:41,140
Yeah.

2512
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:42,280
They don't even know what they want.

2513
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:42,990
They don't know yet.

2514
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:46,230
Putting their ass in a
catapult right in their legs.

2515
01:05:46,231 --> 01:05:49,970
And just launching the crowd
but launching it at the end.

2516
01:05:50,090 --> 01:05:51,050
But there no way to do it.

2517
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:52,370
It's like everybody's splitting.

2518
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,110
Like there's 10 girls in a hotel room.

2519
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:54,680
Yeah,

2520
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:55,430
there's always that.

2521
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:58,250
The dudes are all just
like so psyched wearing.

2522
01:05:58,251 --> 01:05:59,031
They're just,

2523
01:05:59,031 --> 01:05:59,511
they're just like,

2524
01:05:59,511 --> 01:06:00,380
fuck yeah.

2525
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,400
Men with perfume on and shit.

2526
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:03,530
What are you thinking about Cologne?

2527
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,660
What do you think about when you're about
to make out with a guy and you smell

2528
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:07,460
some artificial smell on him?

2529
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,150
I like a guys smell normal smell,

2530
01:06:11,151 --> 01:06:13,670
but I don't mind some old spice old spice.

2531
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:13,880
Yeah,

2532
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:14,940
but I don't know.

2533
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:16,050
I don't know.

2534
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:16,500
Daddy,

2535
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,440
how many dudes do you
think bought 50 cents?

2536
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:20,190
Cologne?

2537
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:21,300
I still wear Cologne.

2538
01:06:21,301 --> 01:06:21,600
Joe.

2539
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:22,470
I know you're against Jeb.

2540
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,410
I wear Cologne was spoil.

2541
01:06:23,411 --> 01:06:23,941
If I was you,

2542
01:06:23,941 --> 01:06:25,050
I'd probably be into it.

2543
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,333
What does that mean?

2544
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:28,490
These whatever help he gets?

2545
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:29,070
No,

2546
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:29,221
no,

2547
01:06:29,221 --> 01:06:29,441
no.

2548
01:06:29,441 --> 01:06:29,850
I mean,

2549
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:32,640
I spray axe on my balls at the spray.

2550
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:34,220
Little low on the board,

2551
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:34,780
on my,

2552
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:35,220
uh,

2553
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,053
Bonnie.

2554
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:38,020
Zach's when you spray on the balls,

2555
01:06:38,021 --> 01:06:38,850
does it sting?

2556
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:39,420
No,

2557
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:40,710
I have no open sores.

2558
01:06:40,711 --> 01:06:41,544
Like you

2559
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:45,370
safe.

2560
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:46,470
I did not shave my body,

2561
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:47,511
my balls,

2562
01:06:47,511 --> 01:06:49,960
and then put aftershave on my balls
just to see what it would feel like.

2563
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:50,480
Kind of go,

2564
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,250
whoa.

2565
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:51,650
Um,

2566
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:52,483
it was not,

2567
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:54,290
I'll tell you it didn't really,

2568
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,273
it hurt,

2569
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:56,690
but it was more like,

2570
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:01,440
I would say more like a really alert
sensation that a pain reminded you.

2571
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:03,050
Follicle.

2572
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:04,460
It was like there was no cuts.

2573
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:05,750
Luckily I didn't,

2574
01:07:05,751 --> 01:07:05,930
uh,

2575
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:08,120
I didn't injure my balls
during the shaving.

2576
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:08,331
No,

2577
01:07:08,331 --> 01:07:09,081
there was no nicking.

2578
01:07:09,081 --> 01:07:11,170
I fortunately had a really good razor.

2579
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:11,991
Yeah.

2580
01:07:11,991 --> 01:07:12,651
The event is,

2581
01:07:12,651 --> 01:07:14,000
I like to see my balls

2582
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,180
to be covered and now my,

2583
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:20,060
my balls are so salt and pepper.

2584
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:20,980
It's so sad.

2585
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,860
It's literally maybe 20%.

2586
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:25,610
No,

2587
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:26,420
not 20,

2588
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:26,991
but 10.

2589
01:07:26,991 --> 01:07:29,700
I'd say $110 chocolate munchkins.

2590
01:07:29,701 --> 01:07:31,080
So one and a 10 is gray.

2591
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:32,510
Mike.

2592
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:33,200
They're going,

2593
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:33,780
oh no.

2594
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,360
And so I don't like looking at him.

2595
01:07:35,361 --> 01:07:36,390
So I shaved the board.

2596
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:37,860
There's no one's in the,

2597
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,110
no one's in the gray.

2598
01:07:39,111 --> 01:07:40,960
Pubes not girls drive

2599
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:42,260
English.

2600
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:47,260
I saw a dude at Runyon yesterday and he
had facial hair from here down thick.

2601
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:49,581
Like,

2602
01:07:49,581 --> 01:07:53,330
he looked like a wolf and he was walking
with all these like overweight Hispanic

2603
01:07:53,331 --> 01:07:54,120
checks,

2604
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:54,510
uh,

2605
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:55,550
and like yelling at them.

2606
01:07:55,551 --> 01:07:57,740
So I caught up to one of them
in the front and I was like,

2607
01:07:57,741 --> 01:07:58,580
is that your teacher?

2608
01:07:58,581 --> 01:07:59,414
And she's like,

2609
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:00,253
yeah.

2610
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:00,711
And I was like,

2611
01:08:00,711 --> 01:08:01,250
what's this?

2612
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:01,590
What's it?

2613
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:02,061
His hair?

2614
01:08:02,061 --> 01:08:02,451
And she's like,

2615
01:08:02,451 --> 01:08:03,800
his wife likes it like that.

2616
01:08:03,801 --> 01:08:04,160
And I was like,

2617
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,000
oh my God.

2618
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:05,570
Wow.

2619
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:07,040
Paul's got a really hairy pussy.

2620
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,480
And they lock up like velcro.

2621
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:09,830
God,

2622
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:10,120
I could.

2623
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,050
That's how she makes
sure she keeps eating.

2624
01:08:12,051 --> 01:08:15,070
Eat that Boosie I want to
let your mom go out of my,

2625
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:15,621
my mouth.

2626
01:08:15,621 --> 01:08:16,100
You

2627
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:16,933
stop.

2628
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:19,190
You'll go.

2629
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:19,821
Well,

2630
01:08:19,821 --> 01:08:21,830
I'm thinking here we box.

2631
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,870
You've got to go with
you to that are Lebanese.

2632
01:08:23,871 --> 01:08:26,370
I don't know how to do a Lebanese
accent will give it a shot.

2633
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:31,020
I don't think

2634
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,690
I'd be careful

2635
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:39,170
making me sad.

2636
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:40,160
You're a racist.

2637
01:08:40,970 --> 01:08:43,760
We're trying to like
promote like unity and here,

2638
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:46,130
you know how we were talking

2639
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:51,000
podcasts the other day about these giant
packs of wolves and the Soviet Union.

2640
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:56,210
Somebody sent me a tweet right afterwards
about a story where these 400 wolves

2641
01:08:57,601 --> 01:08:59,400
had killed 30 horses.

2642
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,240
They're a pack of 400 wolves apparently
is like from over a year ago,

2643
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,510
but he just tweeted me to show
me how bad it actually got.

2644
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:08,440
There were pictures,

2645
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:09,070
oh,

2646
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:09,521
I don't know.

2647
01:09:09,521 --> 01:09:10,301
They didn't have pictures.

2648
01:09:10,301 --> 01:09:13,660
They had just had the article about how
they're hiring teams of hunters to go

2649
01:09:13,661 --> 01:09:14,494
after these walls.

2650
01:09:14,530 --> 01:09:16,930
This is an unprecedented size pack.

2651
01:09:16,931 --> 01:09:17,764
They usually,

2652
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:20,320
they go and pack of packs
of like less than a dozen,

2653
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:21,880
much smaller packs.

2654
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:25,800
Really taking over taking the
Thrones in the Soviet Union.

2655
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,450
There's some spots were
former Soviet Union,

2656
01:09:28,451 --> 01:09:29,051
what do you call it now?

2657
01:09:29,051 --> 01:09:29,470
Russia.

2658
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:30,101
What do you call that?

2659
01:09:30,101 --> 01:09:30,910
Big,

2660
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:31,391
what do you call it?

2661
01:09:31,391 --> 01:09:33,310
That because Russia is only part of it,

2662
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,144
right?

2663
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:35,561
Whatever it is.

2664
01:09:35,561 --> 01:09:36,190
It's like,

2665
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:39,250
I think this is happening
like up north and it's,

2666
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:39,520
you know,

2667
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,930
these poor people live in this

2668
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:43,743
fucking sucks.

2669
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:47,230
It sucks to live up there and apparently
the wolves are starving so they just,

2670
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:48,790
they just got together and I said,

2671
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:49,390
listen,

2672
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:51,000
the all of us together there,

2673
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:52,120
I guess they figured it out.

2674
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:52,954
It's overpopulated.

2675
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:53,980
Six people,

2676
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,960
six walls can't really
go in and kill horses.

2677
01:09:55,961 --> 01:09:56,794
They'll shoot Ya.

2678
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:58,450
But if there's 400 of us,

2679
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,330
we're going to get some horses and
they're not even going to shoot at you

2680
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:02,380
because you're going to be terrified.

2681
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:06,340
She imagined I just rush in and in,

2682
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:07,720
in the Russian Tundra,

2683
01:10:07,721 --> 01:10:12,130
wherever the fuck it would be like frozen
outside and you look out and see 400

2684
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:12,983
wolves

2685
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:13,893
horses.

2686
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:15,440
Oh my God.

2687
01:10:16,890 --> 01:10:19,070
Well that was the thing about
that game of Thrones movies.

2688
01:10:19,071 --> 01:10:22,580
Like it really connected you with how
these people had to live back then.

2689
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:25,570
It was a real like chicken,

2690
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,820
it's my white walkers.

2691
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,103
I was like,

2692
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,060
I was watching it with
Mrs Rogan and I was like,

2693
01:10:35,061 --> 01:10:37,600
what happens if one of those
stupid wooden wheels brakes,

2694
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:38,950
they have an extra wouldn't wheel.

2695
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:44,710
We're going to camp here.

2696
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:46,953
I was

2697
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:52,040
looking at how slow it was moving
to and then like that's real shit.

2698
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:54,050
It moves like the way you jog.

2699
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:55,850
That's how people got across the country.

2700
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,431
We're talking about,

2701
01:10:58,431 --> 01:11:00,200
we've been traveling for over a month.

2702
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:04,940
Look what you have to bring enough food
and water for a month and this stupid

2703
01:11:04,941 --> 01:11:08,750
big box that they're pulling on dumb
wooden wheels and they're just hoping

2704
01:11:08,751 --> 01:11:10,490
there's going to be a road
there when they get there.

2705
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:14,700
I was mad that the valet valet
like wasn't ready with my car.

2706
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:15,833
Yup.

2707
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:17,371
Back then.

2708
01:11:17,371 --> 01:11:18,001
What did you have?

2709
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:21,990
You had like a kingdom and then you had
some roads that would go off until like

2710
01:11:21,991 --> 01:11:26,760
villages and shit and everything would
just be the same ground that was stepped

2711
01:11:26,761 --> 01:11:28,980
on over and over again
until it flattened out.

2712
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:29,311
You know?

2713
01:11:29,311 --> 01:11:30,900
It's like from people walking.

2714
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:32,070
That's how roads are creating,

2715
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:32,520
right?

2716
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,200
There weren't,

2717
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,620
we're doing community service.

2718
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:35,910
Keep the trail.

2719
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:38,550
Chris Brown wasn't out there
picking up passing cops.

2720
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:40,680
Oh yeah.

2721
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:44,120
Just in case you guys like ever
have to do some hoeing wireless.

2722
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:44,510
Yeah,

2723
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:45,520
just like this.

2724
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:46,690
That's not how I do it.

2725
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:47,783
What's the difference?

2726
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:50,790
What's really fucked up about that
is that that's not that long ago.

2727
01:11:51,150 --> 01:11:51,750
I know.

2728
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:52,590
Not that long ago.

2729
01:11:52,591 --> 01:11:53,700
That's how people live.

2730
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:58,701
They just walked around and got on horses
and couldn't go very far and people

2731
01:11:59,461 --> 01:12:02,160
are still doing it and then you'd
have to worry about the people from,

2732
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:05,630
you know over there getting all their
shit together and coming over here and

2733
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:06,540
fucking everybody up.

2734
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:07,590
You always had to worry about that.

2735
01:12:07,591 --> 01:12:09,270
People are always looking
to take everybody's shit.

2736
01:12:09,330 --> 01:12:10,020
Yeah.

2737
01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:10,381
It was like,

2738
01:12:10,381 --> 01:12:12,690
can you please just promise
not to take our shit?

2739
01:12:12,691 --> 01:12:14,730
Like we promise we will not fuck with you.

2740
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:15,151
Yeah.

2741
01:12:15,151 --> 01:12:15,690
When people,

2742
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:17,910
the king would get there and
they'd all get off their horses.

2743
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:18,601
You just said,

2744
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:22,020
I had to hope that the king
wasn't a fucking total psychopath.

2745
01:12:22,021 --> 01:12:22,260
Like,

2746
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:23,460
oh this new king,

2747
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:24,720
he eats babies.

2748
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:27,410
She's going to be a
tough hundred year rob.

2749
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:28,463
That was it.

2750
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,000
James can do whatever the fuck they want.

2751
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,410
That's what was really crazy.

2752
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:33,000
Oh God.

2753
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:33,751
Back in the day.

2754
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:34,080
That's,

2755
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,100
that's how people,

2756
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,180
that's how people live

2757
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:38,800
and like groups of people
are supposed to die out like,

2758
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,070
like species.

2759
01:12:40,071 --> 01:12:40,341
Like,

2760
01:12:40,341 --> 01:12:41,174
there's all,

2761
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:41,540
you know,

2762
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:43,790
the crazy like deep into Africa who still,

2763
01:12:43,791 --> 01:12:44,624
they're just like,

2764
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:46,220
do not give a fuck what we're doing.

2765
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:49,400
And they make like clay bowls
and no one buys them anymore.

2766
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:52,730
But like we like outsourced
to help them and uh,

2767
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:56,120
but now we've gotten so smart with
medicine and the Internet that we're just

2768
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:57,650
staying alive forever and we're like,

2769
01:12:57,651 --> 01:12:58,640
Fuck God,

2770
01:12:59,460 --> 01:12:59,791
whoa.

2771
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:02,040
That was deep yo dude,

2772
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:04,620
who has a BA in theater

2773
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:07,010
down to the universe.

2774
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:10,040
That should have been the
opening to the new soul train.

2775
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:10,850
That's it.

2776
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:13,490
Do you think if you were king you would
just go around the village and like pick

2777
01:13:13,491 --> 01:13:16,460
a different girl at like almost
every day and let them do it more?

2778
01:13:16,461 --> 01:13:18,860
Would you like to find one
girl that you really liked

2779
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,300
martial artists and to have discipline
and I would know that if I did that I

2780
01:13:22,301 --> 01:13:23,134
would go mad.

2781
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,193
Yeah.

2782
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:26,110
Yeah.

2783
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:26,930
Brian

2784
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:28,310
go barbarian style.

2785
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,360
I don't like my,

2786
01:13:29,361 --> 01:13:30,320
that part of my brain.

2787
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:32,030
I like to keep that part
of my brain under route.

2788
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:32,440
Just no,

2789
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,300
just to experience different flavors.

2790
01:13:34,301 --> 01:13:37,550
Like a total neanderthal
lurking that I got a wild,

2791
01:13:37,551 --> 01:13:37,910
yeah.

2792
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:39,530
Pansy deep in the back of my brain.

2793
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:41,780
And if I'm in a hotel and it's on fire,

2794
01:13:41,781 --> 01:13:42,650
that's when it comes out.

2795
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,520
Yeah.

2796
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:44,230
Oh Shit.

2797
01:13:44,230 --> 01:13:44,450
No,

2798
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:47,840
I'm saying if there's a bunch
of people in front of a door,

2799
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:48,770
we were at,

2800
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:50,450
we were at a hotel fire in San Francisco.

2801
01:13:50,451 --> 01:13:53,540
It's four 30 in the morning and all
these people were moving slow down this

2802
01:13:53,541 --> 01:13:54,374
flight of stairs.

2803
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:55,570
And uh,

2804
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:59,200
I was seriously contemplating
running over some fucking pages,

2805
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:00,090
started stabbings.

2806
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:00,651
Cause I was like,

2807
01:14:00,651 --> 01:14:03,080
you guys are not the first of
a lot of people were on Ambien.

2808
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:04,370
Actually talk about this in my act.

2809
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:06,440
Cause it's true where people want people,

2810
01:14:06,441 --> 01:14:09,890
a woman was having to explain to her
husband as he was walking down the stairs.

2811
01:14:09,891 --> 01:14:10,280
Yeah.

2812
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:11,113
What the fuck was going?

2813
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:11,940
It was,

2814
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:12,050
it

2815
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:12,280
was,

2816
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:12,941
it was crazy.

2817
01:14:12,941 --> 01:14:13,570
And I was like,

2818
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:14,300
fuck,

2819
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:14,891
that happened to me.

2820
01:14:14,891 --> 01:14:15,724
One second.

2821
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:16,883
I'm going to me.

2822
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:18,400
I was woken up.

2823
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:20,950
I got woken up fire in the
middle of the night at the hotel.

2824
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,150
I was on Ambien.

2825
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:23,020
And,

2826
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:23,470
uh,

2827
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:26,980
I walked to Mcdonald's
with Abraham Lincoln.

2828
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:27,863
We knew where,

2829
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,033
where was this?

2830
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:30,780
It was warm out.

2831
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:31,900
Maybe Florida.

2832
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:32,351
Wow.

2833
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:35,140
You got woken up from a fire in your hotel
to how many times does that happen to

2834
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:35,460
you?

2835
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:36,670
I wish I could wait once.

2836
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:37,631
I mean once with me.

2837
01:14:37,631 --> 01:14:38,110
Yeah.

2838
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:38,920
It was like,

2839
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:39,430
yeah,

2840
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:40,750
everybody was outside.

2841
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:42,401
They were talking,

2842
01:14:42,401 --> 01:14:44,210
but I was like on drugs.

2843
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:44,590
You know?

2844
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:45,400
Brian was there.

2845
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:45,941
It was a,

2846
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:46,900
was Joe Diaz?

2847
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:47,800
Ari was already too?

2848
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:47,981
No,

2849
01:14:47,981 --> 01:14:48,610
I think it was just,

2850
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:49,040
whoa.

2851
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:49,261
No,

2852
01:14:49,261 --> 01:14:49,460
no.

2853
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:49,781
Sorry.

2854
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:50,220
I fell hard.

2855
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:50,590
Was there too?

2856
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:51,180
I know Jody,

2857
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:52,180
I suppose he was Dunkin.

2858
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:52,631
No,

2859
01:14:52,631 --> 01:14:53,070
it wasn't done.

2860
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:54,220
It wasn't dark yet either way.

2861
01:14:54,221 --> 01:14:56,270
It was definitely Joey and
Brian and I think Aria,

2862
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:57,123
I think it was all right.

2863
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:57,611
And we were,

2864
01:14:57,611 --> 01:14:58,680
we were all outside.

2865
01:14:58,690 --> 01:14:58,931
We're like,

2866
01:14:58,931 --> 01:14:59,621
this is crazy,

2867
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:00,454
man.

2868
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:05,900
They were waking up on the stairs like
people were walking out of a blackout,

2869
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:07,670
like the guys walking down the stairs,

2870
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:07,931
like what?

2871
01:15:07,931 --> 01:15:08,764
What is happening?

2872
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:09,830
And the woman's like,

2873
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:10,660
we worked though.

2874
01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,020
The hotel's on fire.

2875
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:13,160
I woke you up.

2876
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:14,481
I was like,

2877
01:15:14,481 --> 01:15:15,314
grab the rails.

2878
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:16,220
What's going on?

2879
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:16,920
He kept,

2880
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:19,100
they had this look on
his face like he didn't,

2881
01:15:19,101 --> 01:15:20,990
he really didn't know
how he got to that spot.

2882
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,370
And you look beyond that spot.

2883
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,301
Yeah.

2884
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:27,380
People have like crazy stories about
being in the car on the highway and waking

2885
01:15:27,381 --> 01:15:28,370
up and realize like,

2886
01:15:28,371 --> 01:15:29,204
Holy Shit,

2887
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:30,470
what the fuck?

2888
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:32,090
They don't even know how they got there.

2889
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:35,350
They're just driving and
it's totally legal data

2890
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:36,660
talk to,

2891
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:37,750
we give it out like,

2892
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:39,073
like nothing.

2893
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:42,060
And I know a bunch of
people addicted to it.

2894
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:42,600
Yeah.

2895
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,820
I know several people addicted.

2896
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:44,401
It's not good.

2897
01:15:44,401 --> 01:15:45,330
I was addicted to it.

2898
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:45,751
Yeah,

2899
01:15:45,751 --> 01:15:45,961
I know.

2900
01:15:45,961 --> 01:15:48,450
It got it takes two to full amp.

2901
01:15:48,451 --> 01:15:49,110
Yes.

2902
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:49,360
Yes.

2903
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,240
Take Xanax.

2904
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:53,270
Like that's not good for you.

2905
01:15:53,310 --> 01:15:53,880
No,

2906
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:54,713
it's not real.

2907
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:56,130
It's not actual asleep.

2908
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:57,600
He's a very functional guy.

2909
01:15:57,940 --> 01:15:58,710
Like a coma.

2910
01:15:58,710 --> 01:15:59,543
He's a civilian.

2911
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:01,560
He's a hardworking businessman.

2912
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,040
Yeah.

2913
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:02,371
But uh,

2914
01:16:02,371 --> 01:16:03,240
he um,

2915
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:04,320
he,

2916
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,340
he fucking,

2917
01:16:05,341 --> 01:16:07,780
here's a stressful job
and he can't go to sleep.

2918
01:16:07,781 --> 01:16:09,630
Just sometimes it takes to know what he's,

2919
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:10,590
he runs a business.

2920
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:11,071
It was very,

2921
01:16:11,071 --> 01:16:14,520
very complicated business
and he's a long hours.

2922
01:16:14,521 --> 01:16:16,050
It takes work home with
them and he can't sleep,

2923
01:16:16,051 --> 01:16:16,670
so he pops.

2924
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:18,550
Ambiance do.

2925
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:19,201
Yeah.

2926
01:16:19,201 --> 01:16:23,800
Well I think some people are just wrecked
and they have so much shit going on

2927
01:16:23,801 --> 01:16:25,200
and they just need to shut it down.

2928
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:25,441
Well,

2929
01:16:25,441 --> 01:16:28,980
a lot of people had to like really
readjust in this fucked up economy too.

2930
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:29,400
Yeah.

2931
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:29,650
There's all,

2932
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:31,680
I mean if you go and
look at like real estate,

2933
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:31,950
uh,

2934
01:16:31,950 --> 01:16:32,970
websites and like,

2935
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:35,670
I like to look at houses
just fascinated by like,

2936
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:36,510
you know,

2937
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:37,530
what's going on inside?

2938
01:16:37,531 --> 01:16:39,280
Like the construction
of houses where it what?

2939
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:39,600
Wow.

2940
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,740
That'd be cool to live there.

2941
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:42,060
What does it like to live and you know,

2942
01:16:42,061 --> 01:16:42,960
over by the ocean,

2943
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:43,080
right?

2944
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,420
What are those houses look like inside?

2945
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:45,390
Um,

2946
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:49,590
it's amazing how many houses on these
real estate sites are all foreclosures,

2947
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:50,461
foreclosure,

2948
01:16:50,461 --> 01:16:51,690
foreclosure short.

2949
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:53,700
Some people lost their money.

2950
01:16:53,701 --> 01:16:55,230
They couldn't pay for the house anymore.

2951
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:56,490
Losing their house.

2952
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:57,151
They lose their house.

2953
01:16:57,151 --> 01:16:59,680
They have to move out and the
bank owns it and they get nothing.

2954
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:00,533
Bank sells it.

2955
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:00,841
No,

2956
01:17:00,841 --> 01:17:01,650
they don't get shit.

2957
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:01,981
You get,

2958
01:17:01,981 --> 01:17:02,520
you get,

2959
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,280
you get out on your ass or you could
have been paying for that house for 20

2960
01:17:05,281 --> 01:17:05,580
years.

2961
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:06,031
It doesn't matter.

2962
01:17:06,031 --> 01:17:06,870
It's not yours anymore.

2963
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:10,040
I do miss a years worth of payments and
now they're going take it from you and

2964
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:13,250
living in reneged on your
loans are always rented.

2965
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:14,870
And I don't have a car.

2966
01:17:14,871 --> 01:17:16,580
Like I don't want the economy.

2967
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:17,414
I have not,

2968
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,560
I know people are fucked,

2969
01:17:18,561 --> 01:17:19,790
but I've never had any money.

2970
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:20,780
So it's never,

2971
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:21,730
never really.

2972
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:22,563
Yeah,

2973
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:24,950
but it seems like really shitty.

2974
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:27,290
Like if you have a family
and you're just like,

2975
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:28,483
what do you do?

2976
01:17:28,530 --> 01:17:33,500
They said 40% of young adults
between 18 and 34 living home,

2977
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:35,450
man,

2978
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,310
I would almost want to go back.

2979
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:38,110
Is that right?

2980
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:39,950
Or are they really need is like nothing.

2981
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:41,330
Like if my mom lived here,

2982
01:17:41,331 --> 01:17:44,490
I could almost live with my mom
because I'm never really home serious.

2983
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:44,661
No,

2984
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:44,781
no,

2985
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:45,051
I'm not.

2986
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:46,130
I'm never home.

2987
01:17:46,131 --> 01:17:46,610
But,

2988
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:46,851
uh,

2989
01:17:46,851 --> 01:17:48,170
if she like,

2990
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:50,870
cause I use it just for sleeping
and then I'll tell you what,

2991
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:52,520
there's nothing wrong
with living with your mom.

2992
01:17:52,521 --> 01:17:57,380
If your mom respects you as an adult
and you love her and she's not a needy

2993
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,380
person and you can be
around her and you know,

2994
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:01,780
you don't have to babysit
or anyway like that.

2995
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:02,571
Yeah.

2996
01:18:02,571 --> 01:18:04,460
My mom was a very easy going person.

2997
01:18:04,461 --> 01:18:05,900
If my mother wanted to move in,

2998
01:18:05,901 --> 01:18:06,920
I mean it would be no problem.

2999
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:07,640
I mean,

3000
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,920
I think we all have to kind
of take care of her mom,

3001
01:18:09,921 --> 01:18:11,250
but at some point don't,

3002
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:12,740
we're taking care of my mom.

3003
01:18:12,741 --> 01:18:13,940
My mom took care of my mom.

3004
01:18:13,941 --> 01:18:14,920
My mom could live with me.

3005
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:15,531
Yeah.

3006
01:18:15,531 --> 01:18:17,090
So I think we're not
going to have to do it.

3007
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:19,130
She's not like tell you what to do.

3008
01:18:19,131 --> 01:18:20,660
Watch over your business mom.

3009
01:18:20,661 --> 01:18:24,740
Like some people have moms that are like
really like invasive start problems are

3010
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:24,980
alive.

3011
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:25,840
I have friends whose,

3012
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,950
who literally can't talk to
their moms because their moms,

3013
01:18:27,951 --> 01:18:29,130
we'll start drama in their lives.

3014
01:18:29,131 --> 01:18:29,540
Yeah.

3015
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:30,321
And start picking them.

3016
01:18:30,321 --> 01:18:31,440
The girlfriend or picking on the,

3017
01:18:31,441 --> 01:18:31,730
yeah.

3018
01:18:31,730 --> 01:18:32,170
Yeah.

3019
01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:33,460
And they don't know how
to break that habit.

3020
01:18:33,461 --> 01:18:34,980
They've been doing it their whole lives.

3021
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:36,980
But then you get old enough
and you realize that,

3022
01:18:36,981 --> 01:18:38,500
that that behavior's insane.

3023
01:18:38,501 --> 01:18:38,790
Yeah.

3024
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:43,790
You form patterns in your head based
on certain ways of behaving that you've

3025
01:18:44,281 --> 01:18:48,300
always followed in these grooves in
the past and they can be totally shitty

3026
01:18:48,301 --> 01:18:48,840
grooves.

3027
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,220
I personally,

3028
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:51,220
when I was younger,

3029
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:55,050
had a bunch of Shitty grooves that
I had to get my own mind out of.

3030
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:55,770
Yeah.

3031
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:58,440
I had a bunch of like jealousy grooves,

3032
01:18:58,441 --> 01:18:59,730
hater grooves,

3033
01:18:59,731 --> 01:19:01,170
feeling sorry for myself.

3034
01:19:01,171 --> 01:19:04,410
Grooves like a self defeating thoughts,

3035
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:05,263
grooves.

3036
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:07,020
Totally normal.

3037
01:19:07,021 --> 01:19:08,610
And as long as you're interested in,

3038
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:08,971
you know,

3039
01:19:08,971 --> 01:19:10,590
making yourself better than

3040
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:11,460
right.

3041
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,990
But you've got to recognize
them and dump them in.

3042
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:14,721
That's what it is.

3043
01:19:14,721 --> 01:19:15,620
And some people don't.

3044
01:19:15,621 --> 01:19:17,450
And so they find themselves an old lady,

3045
01:19:17,451 --> 01:19:17,691
you know,

3046
01:19:17,691 --> 01:19:18,740
picking on their kids,

3047
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:19,020
you know?

3048
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:19,310
Yeah.

3049
01:19:19,310 --> 01:19:19,851
I've seen it.

3050
01:19:19,851 --> 01:19:20,684
It's gross.

3051
01:19:20,770 --> 01:19:21,460
Gross.

3052
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:21,750
It's,

3053
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:23,360
it's so awful.

3054
01:19:23,361 --> 01:19:25,490
And just like trying
to make them need you,

3055
01:19:25,491 --> 01:19:27,860
like those mothers that light
when their kids are sick.

3056
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:29,840
Oh my mom is like pretty,

3057
01:19:29,841 --> 01:19:30,710
she's pretty cool.

3058
01:19:30,711 --> 01:19:32,870
But definitely there
were some bad patterns,

3059
01:19:32,871 --> 01:19:37,820
but I can't even like really stay
overnight in the same place as her.

3060
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:38,540
Wow.

3061
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:38,931
Yeah.

3062
01:19:38,931 --> 01:19:39,620
Just,

3063
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:39,890
um,

3064
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:41,360
it just gets too intense.

3065
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:42,283
Uh,

3066
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:42,801
yeah.

3067
01:19:42,801 --> 01:19:43,670
Just with like,

3068
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,260
like what kinds of neediness?

3069
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:45,471
Oh,

3070
01:19:45,471 --> 01:19:45,861
really?

3071
01:19:45,861 --> 01:19:46,071
Yeah.

3072
01:19:46,071 --> 01:19:48,230
Like I need a ton of alone time.

3073
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:48,630
Like,

3074
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:50,810
cause I'm so used to being by myself,

3075
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:51,861
so it,

3076
01:19:51,861 --> 01:19:52,410
it'll be like,

3077
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:52,671
mom,

3078
01:19:52,671 --> 01:19:53,271
I need to like,

3079
01:19:53,271 --> 01:19:53,931
just do this.

3080
01:19:53,931 --> 01:19:54,980
Like I need to write this thing.

3081
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:55,431
And she'll be like,

3082
01:19:55,431 --> 01:19:55,731
okay,

3083
01:19:55,731 --> 01:19:55,941
okay,

3084
01:19:55,941 --> 01:19:56,480
that's fine.

3085
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,270
And then she'll come over and she'll like
put a chair in front of me and read a

3086
01:19:59,271 --> 01:19:59,660
book,

3087
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:01,190
like in my direction and I'm like,

3088
01:20:01,191 --> 01:20:02,024
yeah,

3089
01:20:02,150 --> 01:20:03,050
that's crazy.

3090
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:03,440
Like,

3091
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:03,891
you know that,

3092
01:20:03,891 --> 01:20:04,724
that's insane.

3093
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:05,603
Yeah,

3094
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:06,530
yeah,

3095
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:07,260
yeah,

3096
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:07,561
yeah.

3097
01:20:07,561 --> 01:20:08,010
Some people

3098
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:08,843
don't get that.

3099
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:09,953
No.

3100
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:14,040
Everybody's got their own needs when
it comes to the time and space alone.

3101
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:14,790
Ah,

3102
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:16,140
I don't know how I would ever,

3103
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:16,860
I don't know how I would,

3104
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:18,630
I'm going to like ever
live with somebody again.

3105
01:20:18,631 --> 01:20:19,291
You can live with someone.

3106
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:21,900
You just have to make sure that you
have your respected to that space.

3107
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,210
It would make you have to
live in a place where you can,

3108
01:20:24,211 --> 01:20:24,480
you know,

3109
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,830
have a little room away from them.

3110
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:27,950
You pitching like you'd
just shut a door somewhere.

3111
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:28,810
Yes,

3112
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:32,250
I mean like are you in 10 so you're
like throwing items around the house or

3113
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:33,270
anything like that or,

3114
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:34,020
no,

3115
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:34,531
I didn't know.

3116
01:20:34,531 --> 01:20:35,011
I'm like,

3117
01:20:35,011 --> 01:20:36,930
I want to be as drama free as possible.

3118
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:37,770
I'm not,

3119
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:38,670
I'm not needy.

3120
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:39,510
I'm like,

3121
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:41,850
how many domestic violence
calls have you made in a wall,

3122
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:42,300
you know,

3123
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,111
domestic violence,

3124
01:20:43,111 --> 01:20:45,810
whole silence holes is that
you were saying glory holes,

3125
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:49,680
Brian in a whole like a plaster zero.

3126
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:50,970
How many have I caused?

3127
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:52,051
Probably a lot.

3128
01:20:52,051 --> 01:20:53,160
So you've seen him before.

3129
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:54,030
So there,

3130
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:58,050
there's definitely some number
of walls next to my head punched.

3131
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:58,380
Yeah.

3132
01:20:58,380 --> 01:20:58,830
Wow.

3133
01:20:58,830 --> 01:20:59,663
Really?

3134
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:03,210
You deserve,

3135
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,163
hold on.

3136
01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:05,251
Stop yelling.

3137
01:21:05,251 --> 01:21:06,084
You deserved it.

3138
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:08,940
Psycho you cause you're
going through a breakup,

3139
01:21:08,941 --> 01:21:09,130
right?

3140
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:09,310
No,

3141
01:21:09,310 --> 01:21:09,460
no,

3142
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:10,680
just don't take it out on me

3143
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:14,781
guy.

3144
01:21:14,781 --> 01:21:15,510
When I was,

3145
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:15,950
um,

3146
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:17,270
in my early twenties,

3147
01:21:17,271 --> 01:21:21,320
like when I was 19 to 21 that uh,

3148
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,671
he didn't hit me,

3149
01:21:22,671 --> 01:21:24,710
but I got hurt by accident all the time.

3150
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:26,390
Yeah.

3151
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:28,760
We had one night where he,

3152
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:30,080
we were like 21,

3153
01:21:30,081 --> 01:21:31,220
like drinking a lot,

3154
01:21:31,221 --> 01:21:35,780
like drinking martinis before we would
go out and it was like we were in love

3155
01:21:35,781 --> 01:21:36,441
with each other.

3156
01:21:36,441 --> 01:21:40,370
And so scared of losing each other
and it was fucking wild and horrible.

3157
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:42,020
And One night he,

3158
01:21:42,290 --> 01:21:42,770
um,

3159
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:45,680
we were out at a bar and I was
like trying to make him jealous.

3160
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,300
I was like dancing with another guy.

3161
01:21:47,690 --> 01:21:48,523
Uh,

3162
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:49,371
I'm 19,

3163
01:21:49,371 --> 01:21:50,570
I'm wearing like a tube top.

3164
01:21:50,571 --> 01:21:50,990
I'm like,

3165
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:51,830
life is amazing.

3166
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:55,550
And he comes over and yells
at me and I spit on him.

3167
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:56,883
Uh,

3168
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:57,590
yeah.

3169
01:21:57,590 --> 01:21:57,831
And I,

3170
01:21:57,831 --> 01:22:02,060
so I spit on him and he like grabs me and
throws me out of the bar and chases me

3171
01:22:02,061 --> 01:22:02,570
all over.

3172
01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:04,820
Wound up like throwing
me on the roof of a car.

3173
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:07,010
I ran into an apartment,

3174
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:08,210
uh,

3175
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:12,230
like just ran in like for help cause
he was chasing me and these guys,

3176
01:22:12,231 --> 01:22:12,591
it was like,

3177
01:22:12,591 --> 01:22:15,500
they were obviously doing a bunch
of illegal stuff like these,

3178
01:22:15,501 --> 01:22:18,010
I think it was like some
sort of a gang and uh,

3179
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:18,560
they were like,

3180
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:18,891
okay,

3181
01:22:18,891 --> 01:22:19,191
just,

3182
01:22:19,191 --> 01:22:22,220
they hit me and like their bathroom
and then he came there and was making a

3183
01:22:22,221 --> 01:22:22,581
scene.

3184
01:22:22,581 --> 01:22:26,390
So the guys threw me out because they
didn't want the cops to come and he wound

3185
01:22:26,391 --> 01:22:27,770
up getting in a fist fight with them.

3186
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:28,940
End of the night.

3187
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:30,290
We're back at our apartment.

3188
01:22:30,291 --> 01:22:31,640
We lived together in Santa Barbara.

3189
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:36,440
He starts breaking
classes over his own head.

3190
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,380
And then I finally find a way
to run out of the apartment.

3191
01:22:39,381 --> 01:22:41,030
And he was chasing me with a knife,

3192
01:22:41,031 --> 01:22:45,380
like American psycho chasing me
around our apartment complex.

3193
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:46,491
And I bang,

3194
01:22:46,491 --> 01:22:46,701
Bang,

3195
01:22:46,701 --> 01:22:47,271
Bang on the door.

3196
01:22:47,271 --> 01:22:51,230
Finally someone opened and I go in
this apartment and it was a guy,

3197
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:52,460
um,

3198
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:53,630
who's chopping up a woman.

3199
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:54,560
Like,

3200
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,393
I'm not kidding.

3201
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,170
He,

3202
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:58,130
I'd like seen this guy
around our apartment.

3203
01:22:58,460 --> 01:22:59,293
I walk in,

3204
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:00,260
he closes the door,

3205
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:01,670
I noticed it smells like shit,

3206
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:02,863
like feces.

3207
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:03,651
And I look over,

3208
01:23:03,651 --> 01:23:04,940
his wife is in a hospital,

3209
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:08,260
she has no arms and legs and
her mouth is cocked open.

3210
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:09,880
I'm not like,

3211
01:23:09,881 --> 01:23:11,170
this is all totally true.

3212
01:23:11,171 --> 01:23:12,220
I've never like told this.

3213
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:13,540
I haven't thought about this in years.

3214
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:14,883
But uh,

3215
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,150
and they call and I was like,

3216
01:23:16,180 --> 01:23:17,950
then I was more scared in that house.

3217
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:18,760
But they called,

3218
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,500
they called the cops for me and uh,

3219
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:21,970
and yeah,

3220
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:24,010
and I got out and moved back to New York.

3221
01:23:24,090 --> 01:23:25,480
Did you ever talk to that guy again?

3222
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:26,410
Yeah,

3223
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:27,880
we're back together and I'm just kidding.

3224
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:29,330
Yeah.

3225
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:29,800
Yeah.

3226
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:30,161
We were,

3227
01:23:30,161 --> 01:23:30,821
we were kids.

3228
01:23:30,821 --> 01:23:33,730
We were horrible kids get a knife.

3229
01:23:33,731 --> 01:23:34,564
He was chasing me.

3230
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:36,071
I don't,

3231
01:23:36,071 --> 01:23:36,670
I don't know.

3232
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:37,390
He was,

3233
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:39,280
he was drunk and he was
really afraid of losing me.

3234
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:40,950
Uh,

3235
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:41,300
I,

3236
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,080
I,

3237
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,270
I don't know what his plans were,

3238
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:43,871
but uh,

3239
01:23:43,871 --> 01:23:44,230
yeah,

3240
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:44,860
we,

3241
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:46,960
we like I'm just gonna
give you a second gash.

3242
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:48,640
You wanted a new hole.

3243
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:49,763
Um,

3244
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:52,390
but it was like after him,

3245
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:57,130
dating was weird because I
was like confused by if a
guy really liked me or not.

3246
01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:00,040
Like I dated this really nice guy
after him and I was just like,

3247
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:01,001
I was like,

3248
01:24:01,001 --> 01:24:01,900
are you into this?

3249
01:24:01,901 --> 01:24:02,321
And he's like,

3250
01:24:02,321 --> 01:24:02,561
yeah,

3251
01:24:02,561 --> 01:24:03,251
I'm told why.

3252
01:24:03,251 --> 01:24:03,491
I was like,

3253
01:24:03,491 --> 01:24:06,580
cause you've never like spit on
me or threatened my coworkers.

3254
01:24:06,581 --> 01:24:07,414
Like are you,

3255
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:08,680
is there any passion here?

3256
01:24:08,681 --> 01:24:09,600
He's like a,

3257
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:10,690
what do you want from me?

3258
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:11,520
But yeah.

3259
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,730
So the way I feel about it,

3260
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:14,450
that's all real.

3261
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:15,270
Yeah.

3262
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:17,230
Oh is your real feeling like that?

3263
01:24:17,231 --> 01:24:20,520
Like when a guy doesn't do anything crazy
or violent that he's not really you?

3264
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:20,951
No,

3265
01:24:20,951 --> 01:24:23,020
that was just me at 22,

3266
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:25,390
like being really fucked
up by this relationship.

3267
01:24:25,391 --> 01:24:27,610
So that's why when someone's
like really did feel that.

3268
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:28,420
Yeah,

3269
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:29,253
I felt,

3270
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:35,820
I really felt believed that because
they weren't spitting on your warrant,

3271
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,070
violent towards your core.

3272
01:24:37,250 --> 01:24:39,490
That whole next year I was confused.

3273
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:42,370
I didn't think that the guy I was dating
really cared about me because of that.

3274
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:43,630
And the guy was dating.

3275
01:24:43,631 --> 01:24:45,760
I mean he really liked did a number on me.

3276
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:46,630
Um,

3277
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:50,470
he would like rip the shower curtain
down when I was in there and do a number

3278
01:24:50,471 --> 01:24:50,990
two,

3279
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:53,870
he would rip the shower,

3280
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:57,660
I'd be like in the shower and he would
like come in and rip it down and like,

3281
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:59,380
like point at me and laugh.

3282
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:00,460
Um,

3283
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:02,500
like just crazy horrible shit.

3284
01:25:02,501 --> 01:25:02,951
And I thought,

3285
01:25:02,951 --> 01:25:04,510
I thought we were living
with a crazy person.

3286
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:06,760
I know it was really bad and it was like,

3287
01:25:06,761 --> 01:25:07,900
but I was in love with him,

3288
01:25:07,901 --> 01:25:09,250
so it's like,

3289
01:25:09,251 --> 01:25:09,521
no,

3290
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,420
I've done that.

3291
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:11,423
Yeah.

3292
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:11,860
Yeah.

3293
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:12,760
He had a cock on him.

3294
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:13,753
Wow.

3295
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:14,080
Yeah,

3296
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,120
probably I was 20 and he was,

3297
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:18,340
he just knew how to make it happen.

3298
01:25:18,341 --> 01:25:19,121
I don't know what it was.

3299
01:25:19,121 --> 01:25:19,954
It was,

3300
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:21,580
it was 10 years ago.

3301
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:21,940
No,

3302
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:22,331
no,

3303
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:23,800
there was no shitting and farting.

3304
01:25:23,801 --> 01:25:24,100
Brian.

3305
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:24,730
I mean,

3306
01:25:24,730 --> 01:25:27,880
but I understand when people like,

3307
01:25:27,881 --> 01:25:30,760
I really don't judge anybody who gets
in some awful relationship cause I've

3308
01:25:30,761 --> 01:25:32,020
always been like a strong,

3309
01:25:32,021 --> 01:25:33,280
like I don't keep my mouth shut.

3310
01:25:33,281 --> 01:25:33,511
Chicks.

3311
01:25:33,511 --> 01:25:35,770
So I think like you,

3312
01:25:35,771 --> 01:25:37,120
like it could happen to anybody.

3313
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:38,200
Like you can be,

3314
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,210
you can fall in love with
somebody who hurts you.

3315
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:40,540
Well,

3316
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:41,980
especially when you're 20 years old,

3317
01:25:41,981 --> 01:25:42,340
you really,

3318
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:43,173
you're a child,

3319
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:44,650
you don't know anything.

3320
01:25:44,651 --> 01:25:45,100
Right.

3321
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:49,330
But I've never been in a relationship
with any sort of even meanness.

3322
01:25:49,331 --> 01:25:49,451
I,

3323
01:25:49,451 --> 01:25:50,800
I've never since then,

3324
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:54,520
I don't think I've even said anything to
anyone in a relationship that I regret.

3325
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:55,560
Awesome.

3326
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,393
Yeah,

3327
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:59,650
I've learned chase of a knife.

3328
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:01,930
It was,

3329
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:03,620
it was really bad and he was really sick.

3330
01:26:03,621 --> 01:26:04,040
I would feel

3331
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:07,610
like he would like grab me and then I'd
have a huge bruise and the next day I'd

3332
01:26:07,611 --> 01:26:07,880
be like,

3333
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:08,001
oh,

3334
01:26:08,001 --> 01:26:09,380
he's going to feel so bad about this.

3335
01:26:09,381 --> 01:26:10,790
Like I would feel bad for him.

3336
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:11,420
Right.

3337
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:11,870
You know,

3338
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:12,650
never again.

3339
01:26:12,650 --> 01:26:13,850
That guy's my holocaust.

3340
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:17,330
He didn't feel bad when he
grabbed you when you left bruises.

3341
01:26:17,490 --> 01:26:18,170
He would like,

3342
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:20,090
can you really convince
me that it was my fault?

3343
01:26:20,091 --> 01:26:21,110
It was really like,

3344
01:26:21,111 --> 01:26:21,470
wow.

3345
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:21,731
Yeah,

3346
01:26:21,731 --> 01:26:22,070
it was.

3347
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:22,910
I was a kid.

3348
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:23,893
How old was he?

3349
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:24,773
My Age.

3350
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:25,220
Wow.

3351
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:25,700
Yeah,

3352
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:26,533
he had a good PillCam.

3353
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:27,471
Are you one of those girls?

3354
01:26:27,471 --> 01:26:28,304
I bruise easy.

3355
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,140
Have you ever met one of
those girls were like,

3356
01:26:30,141 --> 01:26:33,290
like you could just pretty much like
touch her and then the next day like you

3357
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:34,150
could just go like this.

3358
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:35,570
Is that what you tell yourself Brian?

3359
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,410
You sound like maybe like
maybe you're a contender.

3360
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:39,741
No,

3361
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:39,870
no,

3362
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:40,110
no.

3363
01:26:40,110 --> 01:26:42,330
I've actually dated
somebody that like serious,

3364
01:26:42,331 --> 01:26:43,190
like she could just go like,

3365
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:46,230
like let's just put her hand down too
hard on a desk and she would get a bruise

3366
01:26:46,231 --> 01:26:46,730
right here.

3367
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:47,030
Fine.

3368
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:49,820
I get massages a lot and I
know that's super unhealthy.

3369
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:50,091
I mean,

3370
01:26:50,091 --> 01:26:50,501
she's like,

3371
01:26:50,501 --> 01:26:52,520
it is some sort of of iron deficiency.

3372
01:26:52,521 --> 01:26:55,760
You should drink more water and
you should stop shaking her.

3373
01:26:56,660 --> 01:26:57,493
No more math.

3374
01:26:58,760 --> 01:26:59,600
No math,

3375
01:26:59,660 --> 01:27:00,410
no more math.

3376
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:00,750
Yeah.

3377
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:03,920
I feel that our relationship with
somebody where you guys brought out the

3378
01:27:03,921 --> 01:27:05,300
fucking worst in each other.

3379
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:05,651
Oh yeah.

3380
01:27:05,651 --> 01:27:06,740
Just toxic.

3381
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:06,981
Oh,

3382
01:27:06,981 --> 01:27:07,490
sure.

3383
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:08,210
Absolutely.

3384
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:08,421
Yeah,

3385
01:27:08,421 --> 01:27:09,254
I've had those.

3386
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:09,471
Yeah.

3387
01:27:09,471 --> 01:27:11,900
Especially when you're young and you
don't realize like what fighting in a

3388
01:27:11,901 --> 01:27:12,621
relationship is.

3389
01:27:12,621 --> 01:27:12,891
Yeah.

3390
01:27:12,891 --> 01:27:14,270
You don't know what it
is supposed to be yet.

3391
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:14,541
Yeah.

3392
01:27:14,541 --> 01:27:14,991
And you,

3393
01:27:14,991 --> 01:27:15,261
you know,

3394
01:27:15,261 --> 01:27:17,250
you say shitty things to each
other and you didn't realize like,

3395
01:27:17,251 --> 01:27:17,480
oh,

3396
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:18,330
what the fuck am I doing?

3397
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:19,640
Take that shit back.

3398
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:22,370
I took me once to learn all of that stuff.

3399
01:27:22,371 --> 01:27:24,230
I got every lesson in one dude.

3400
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:24,950
Right?

3401
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:25,131
Yeah.

3402
01:27:25,131 --> 01:27:27,110
I got lucky that I never
had anybody that crazy,

3403
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:28,910
but it's fascinating to watch people,

3404
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:29,970
you know when you,

3405
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:31,100
you get close to somebody,

3406
01:27:31,101 --> 01:27:32,300
you don't know him very well,

3407
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:35,090
and then all of a sudden within
like a month or two months,

3408
01:27:35,091 --> 01:27:38,300
you're hanging out with him every day
and you're like deepen their life.

3409
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:40,730
Like when you remember when you're young
and you first start meeting people,

3410
01:27:40,731 --> 01:27:40,911
I mean,

3411
01:27:40,911 --> 01:27:42,410
that's essentially what happens,

3412
01:27:42,411 --> 01:27:42,591
right?

3413
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:42,831
You're like,

3414
01:27:42,831 --> 01:27:43,890
throw yourself at point.

3415
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,010
You're like so codependent.

3416
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:46,701
You don't even know.

3417
01:27:46,701 --> 01:27:48,240
You don't know how to regulate it,

3418
01:27:48,241 --> 01:27:48,450
right?

3419
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:49,430
Like us.

3420
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:51,710
And then you get into
there with wife and you go,

3421
01:27:51,711 --> 01:27:52,071
Whoa,

3422
01:27:52,071 --> 01:27:54,410
I'm dealing with fucking
Hornets nest here.

3423
01:27:54,411 --> 01:27:54,561
Like,

3424
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:55,100
yeah.

3425
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:57,410
What is all this craziness
you got going on here?

3426
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:57,951
Yeah.

3427
01:27:57,951 --> 01:27:59,450
Not No more now.

3428
01:27:59,451 --> 01:27:59,841
Like I,

3429
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:01,850
I met a dude recently and I was like,

3430
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,650
you could try and get him to the music.

3431
01:28:03,651 --> 01:28:04,230
Brian.

3432
01:28:04,230 --> 01:28:05,063
Oh,

3433
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:06,770
you got some sexy piano player.

3434
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:08,020
You met,

3435
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:08,630
met a dude.

3436
01:28:08,630 --> 01:28:10,070
I met a guy was the guy do,

3437
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:11,100
um,

3438
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:12,050
I don't mind comedian.

3439
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:13,220
He's a nine comedians.

3440
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:14,480
He fancies himself to be funny.

3441
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:16,460
Everybody does who?

3442
01:28:16,490 --> 01:28:17,323
That's all good.

3443
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:18,443
No,

3444
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:19,783
no,

3445
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:20,331
no.

3446
01:28:20,331 --> 01:28:21,164
But she too,

3447
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:22,063
but right away.

3448
01:28:22,410 --> 01:28:23,243
Really?

3449
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:26,211
Okay,

3450
01:28:26,211 --> 01:28:26,511
Brian,

3451
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:26,960
you're fired,

3452
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:27,350
Brian.

3453
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:29,000
You are really not bringing it to that.

3454
01:28:29,001 --> 01:28:29,870
You're in a bad place.

3455
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,280
I'm not going to hold it against you.

3456
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:32,293
I support you.

3457
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:35,600
There's a person isn't a
fucking sound manager country.

3458
01:28:35,601 --> 01:28:36,480
Then we're fucked it up.

3459
01:28:36,550 --> 01:28:40,700
Like you just got this equipment today
and he's just pressing it thinks it's

3460
01:28:40,701 --> 01:28:41,001
cute.

3461
01:28:41,001 --> 01:28:42,000
What does this do?

3462
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:45,080
He's just pushing that retard angle.

3463
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:46,370
Hard and strong.

3464
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:49,820
So the guy is non-successful non comedian.

3465
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:51,180
Yeah.

3466
01:28:51,180 --> 01:28:54,500
But what I'm saying is
that probably not whoa,

3467
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:55,401
like he will.

3468
01:28:55,401 --> 01:28:55,641
Yeah.

3469
01:28:55,641 --> 01:28:57,560
Like everybody wants to be
doing better than they're doing,

3470
01:28:57,561 --> 01:28:58,490
but it's just like a general,

3471
01:28:58,491 --> 01:28:59,480
I want to be doing better.

3472
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:02,790
Do you think he can be your creepy
manager that steals money from you?

3473
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:03,961
No,

3474
01:29:03,961 --> 01:29:05,460
I don't think he's got the intellect.

3475
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:05,970
No.

3476
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:07,260
That's what I'm searching for.

3477
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:08,620
You searching for a [inaudible] guys,

3478
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,170
guys,

3479
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:11,160
that's going to just
take me for everything.

3480
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:11,400
No,

3481
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,410
I was just going to come
along and be your manager.

3482
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:13,940
Everything.

3483
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:16,950
I need my bills behind your back
and that is that what happens?

3484
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:17,761
Girls date guys,

3485
01:29:17,761 --> 01:29:18,780
they become their managers.

3486
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:20,423
Why not?

3487
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:20,641
No,

3488
01:29:20,641 --> 01:29:21,300
I just,

3489
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:25,230
what I'm saying is at 30 like
meeting a guy now you just like,

3490
01:29:25,231 --> 01:29:26,064
see,

3491
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:26,740
you're like a,

3492
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:27,240
you're like,

3493
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:27,840
oh,

3494
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:28,230
oh no,

3495
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:28,291
no,

3496
01:29:28,291 --> 01:29:28,351
no,

3497
01:29:28,351 --> 01:29:28,730
no.

3498
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:29,160
Like I,

3499
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,810
and I'm not even going to fuck you.

3500
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:32,040
Like I'm not,

3501
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:33,990
let's just stop this right here,

3502
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:35,220
but the strike one,

3503
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:35,820
right?

3504
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:36,580
Yeah.

3505
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:40,930
I was in a party the other night and
there was a dude who just just have these

3506
01:29:40,931 --> 01:29:42,730
like Uber Douche vibes.

3507
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:43,500
Yeah.

3508
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:43,770
Yeah.

3509
01:29:43,770 --> 01:29:44,580
For no reason.

3510
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:44,821
Like,

3511
01:29:44,821 --> 01:29:45,091
you know,

3512
01:29:45,091 --> 01:29:46,140
you just look at a guy and you go,

3513
01:29:46,141 --> 01:29:46,531
wait,

3514
01:29:46,531 --> 01:29:48,090
what are you the worse?

3515
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:48,953
What's going on here?

3516
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:49,441
He goes,

3517
01:29:49,441 --> 01:29:50,460
a bunch of people I didn't know,

3518
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:51,510
but uh,

3519
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:52,560
he had a thumb ring.

3520
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:55,830
That's all it take for me.

3521
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:55,951
Well,

3522
01:29:55,951 --> 01:29:56,790
I have a wallet chain.

3523
01:29:56,791 --> 01:29:58,010
I'm really glass houses.

3524
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:58,853
I'm throwing rocks.

3525
01:29:58,890 --> 01:29:59,930
I don't think a wall chains.

3526
01:29:59,931 --> 01:30:00,540
I bet it's nothing.

3527
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:01,230
It's no fun.

3528
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:04,810
It's pretty had a submarine and he was
wearing leather flip flops and a pony

3529
01:30:04,811 --> 01:30:05,644
tail.

3530
01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:07,020
And when he talks,

3531
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:07,854
he was my manager

3532
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:10,980
over exaggerate like the of the,

3533
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,730
the name of a country
that's in Mozambique.

3534
01:30:14,090 --> 01:30:14,470
Uh,

3535
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:16,920
I just really like on a sec.

3536
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:22,620
Then I found out that he was living off
the alimony from a rich woman that he

3537
01:30:22,621 --> 01:30:23,420
had married.

3538
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:23,721
Yeah,

3539
01:30:23,721 --> 01:30:24,051
you're like,

3540
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:24,770
it all adds up.

3541
01:30:24,770 --> 01:30:25,603
It all adds up.

3542
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:27,200
Well this is hilarious.

3543
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:29,760
It's amazing when you
just see a guy's like a,

3544
01:30:29,761 --> 01:30:31,500
like a male hustlers type character.

3545
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:32,401
And I saw him,

3546
01:30:32,401 --> 01:30:33,240
I observed him,

3547
01:30:33,241 --> 01:30:33,781
I watched him,

3548
01:30:33,781 --> 01:30:36,540
I followed him around because I was
fascinated by him cause he was fabulous.

3549
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:38,490
He went over to these mothers.

3550
01:30:38,491 --> 01:30:38,790
And,

3551
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:39,020
uh,

3552
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:40,910
although all these mothers
were hanging around and,

3553
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:41,071
you know,

3554
01:30:41,071 --> 01:30:43,380
he's fairly decent looking guy and uh,

3555
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:43,681
you know,

3556
01:30:43,681 --> 01:30:46,900
it just goes over and tries
to talk really seriously.

3557
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:47,820
This is a wow,

3558
01:30:47,821 --> 01:30:49,890
what a beautiful ensemble.

3559
01:30:49,891 --> 01:30:50,071
What,

3560
01:30:50,071 --> 01:30:50,400
uh,

3561
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,630
an amazing bouquet of
flowers and sensitively put,

3562
01:30:54,631 --> 01:30:55,770
they're just so beautiful.

3563
01:30:55,771 --> 01:30:56,060
So many.

3564
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:56,893
Yeah.

3565
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:57,993
Oh,

3566
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,780
well not this chick.

3567
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:03,710
A guy that was collecting alimony
from a woman is not a man,

3568
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:05,990
not a man.

3569
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,790
And women should be doing it either.

3570
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:09,020
It seems awful.

3571
01:31:09,080 --> 01:31:09,380
Uh,

3572
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:09,531
well,

3573
01:31:09,531 --> 01:31:09,861
you know what?

3574
01:31:09,861 --> 01:31:10,521
I disagree.

3575
01:31:10,521 --> 01:31:12,950
If a man is taken care of
a woman and she has kids,

3576
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:15,590
or if you told her she
doesn't have to work,

3577
01:31:15,591 --> 01:31:16,011
I'm rich,

3578
01:31:16,011 --> 01:31:16,551
come with me.

3579
01:31:16,551 --> 01:31:17,160
And then she's like,

3580
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:19,100
do you ever send money to get
her shit back together again?

3581
01:31:19,101 --> 01:31:20,450
I think everybody deserves,

3582
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:21,410
you know,

3583
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:23,240
I don't think anybody deserves to,

3584
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:26,240
to be fucked up and on
skid row or what have you.

3585
01:31:26,241 --> 01:31:29,540
If there's a way to avoid it where the
other person could just be a decent and

3586
01:31:29,541 --> 01:31:30,374
moral person.

3587
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:31,533
Right.

3588
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,920
Breakups are so bad for the most part.

3589
01:31:33,921 --> 01:31:35,480
A lot of times people don't want to help.

3590
01:31:35,481 --> 01:31:38,300
The other person and want them
to be a fucking homeless person.

3591
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:40,730
They need the courts to kind of step in.

3592
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:41,491
Yeah.

3593
01:31:41,491 --> 01:31:42,324
But that dude,

3594
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:45,320
but like that dude at the party,

3595
01:31:45,321 --> 01:31:49,790
like I've had guys that like that do well.

3596
01:31:49,791 --> 01:31:53,460
You know some guys that are a little
bit famous and you see how they're,

3597
01:31:53,490 --> 01:31:55,430
their shit would work on somebody else.

3598
01:31:55,431 --> 01:31:55,790
Like,

3599
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:56,120
oh yeah,

3600
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:57,410
girls like when you pay attention,

3601
01:31:57,470 --> 01:31:57,551
you,

3602
01:31:57,551 --> 01:32:00,280
when you ask them questions
and see something about

3603
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:00,431
them,

3604
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:01,264
they're like,

3605
01:32:01,530 --> 01:32:04,780
cause we can just project everything
we've ever wanted on to the dude.

3606
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:05,680
So,

3607
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:06,311
but that,

3608
01:32:06,311 --> 01:32:08,680
but like that whole game,

3609
01:32:08,681 --> 01:32:11,830
like I wish that worked on me.

3610
01:32:11,831 --> 01:32:12,590
He see it coming right

3611
01:32:12,590 --> 01:32:13,350
a mile away.

3612
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:13,491
No,

3613
01:32:13,491 --> 01:32:14,110
you don't.

3614
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:15,050
You imagine no baffle.

3615
01:32:15,051 --> 01:32:16,070
You'd be every day,

3616
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:17,540
especially out here.

3617
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:18,141
But the,

3618
01:32:18,141 --> 01:32:18,620
the,

3619
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:22,490
the male hustler approach
talking about cleanses.

3620
01:32:22,491 --> 01:32:24,890
Who when he just returned
from a detox cleanse,

3621
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:25,371
I was like,

3622
01:32:25,371 --> 01:32:27,230
this guy isn't a goddamn movie.

3623
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:27,921
This is,

3624
01:32:27,921 --> 01:32:29,690
this is like a Judd Apatow movie.

3625
01:32:29,691 --> 01:32:31,110
And this guy is like the,

3626
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:32,210
the new age,

3627
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:32,801
you know,

3628
01:32:32,801 --> 01:32:34,330
it's like Russell brand and like some,

3629
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:34,671
no,

3630
01:32:34,671 --> 01:32:35,510
not even Russell brackets.

3631
01:32:35,511 --> 01:32:35,991
Brussel vans.

3632
01:32:35,991 --> 01:32:36,620
Always funny.

3633
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:36,861
No.

3634
01:32:36,861 --> 01:32:37,600
But I mean like,

3635
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:38,300
well,

3636
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:39,133
why Douche bag?

3637
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:39,390
Yeah.

3638
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:41,200
But he plays a wild douche bag guys.

3639
01:32:41,210 --> 01:32:42,050
And even wild,

3640
01:32:42,051 --> 01:32:42,870
he's just a mile.

3641
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:45,170
Does that guy like himself like,

3642
01:32:45,171 --> 01:32:45,691
or does he,

3643
01:32:45,691 --> 01:32:47,070
when he's alone in the bathroom,

3644
01:32:47,071 --> 01:32:50,580
does he look in the mirror and you
have to keep himself from sobbing?

3645
01:32:50,610 --> 01:32:51,120
Yeah,

3646
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:51,751
I hope so.

3647
01:32:51,751 --> 01:32:53,310
You can only hope that guy hates himself.

3648
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:53,661
If,

3649
01:32:53,661 --> 01:32:56,060
if anyone ever assaulted him on
the street who would just quit,

3650
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:57,200
he would curl up in a ball.

3651
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:58,190
It's just,

3652
01:32:58,190 --> 01:32:59,870
if you just had one thing to him,

3653
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:00,261
he's,

3654
01:33:00,261 --> 01:33:01,580
if someone attacked him physically,

3655
01:33:01,581 --> 01:33:02,390
he would fall apart.

3656
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:04,850
That's why like when those
guys are in my audience.

3657
01:33:04,910 --> 01:33:06,920
So this guy became my science
project for the party,

3658
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:08,723
which I did.

3659
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:09,441
I was,

3660
01:33:09,441 --> 01:33:10,210
I was thinking about,

3661
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:11,390
I'll start twittering about it.

3662
01:33:11,391 --> 01:33:13,010
I tweeted about it while
I was falling the sky.

3663
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:13,400
Yeah.

3664
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:13,881
And then,

3665
01:33:13,881 --> 01:33:14,060
uh,

3666
01:33:14,060 --> 01:33:18,320
I watched him talk to a young boy
and that's where it's shit got really

3667
01:33:18,330 --> 01:33:19,590
interesting because,

3668
01:33:19,610 --> 01:33:19,820
uh,

3669
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:20,061
no,

3670
01:33:20,061 --> 01:33:20,271
not,

3671
01:33:20,271 --> 01:33:21,104
not like that.

3672
01:33:22,190 --> 01:33:23,740
Like the kid was,

3673
01:33:24,530 --> 01:33:25,520
I should say a teenager.

3674
01:33:25,521 --> 01:33:28,220
The kid was about it probably
like 18 watch for 20 minutes.

3675
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:30,230
And,

3676
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:30,380
uh,

3677
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,180
they were talking about
things and you know,

3678
01:33:32,181 --> 01:33:32,371
the,

3679
01:33:32,371 --> 01:33:35,480
the guy was doing his sort of
smoldering thing with them and you know,

3680
01:33:35,481 --> 01:33:36,710
being wise and,

3681
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:37,750
and uh,

3682
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:38,750
the kid asked him,

3683
01:33:38,990 --> 01:33:39,860
what do you do?

3684
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:41,410
Okay.

3685
01:33:41,410 --> 01:33:42,700
And he didn't answer.

3686
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:44,040
He didn't answer.

3687
01:33:44,041 --> 01:33:44,801
It doesn't do anything.

3688
01:33:44,801 --> 01:33:45,581
He had like,

3689
01:33:45,581 --> 01:33:46,414
um,

3690
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:47,860
like a little pause a,

3691
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:48,430
um,

3692
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:50,350
and it was really crazy.

3693
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:51,251
And then he,

3694
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:54,850
the kid asked him again like he tried to
like change the subject or he tried to

3695
01:33:54,851 --> 01:33:56,380
like add something yeah.

3696
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:57,850
To the past statement that he,

3697
01:33:57,851 --> 01:33:58,001
you know,

3698
01:33:58,001 --> 01:33:58,221
the,

3699
01:33:58,221 --> 01:34:01,690
the previous sentence on the right to
finish it as if the guy didn't ask him

3700
01:34:01,691 --> 01:34:02,524
what he do.

3701
01:34:02,830 --> 01:34:04,090
And then the kid asked again,

3702
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:05,230
what do you do?

3703
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:10,800
And then he had this sort of a stutter
and we're working in developing property.

3704
01:34:12,011 --> 01:34:12,330
Right.

3705
01:34:12,330 --> 01:34:13,163
No,

3706
01:34:13,180 --> 01:34:13,420
you know,

3707
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:14,150
I don't know what it is,

3708
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:14,871
what the truth is.

3709
01:34:14,871 --> 01:34:15,171
He's like,

3710
01:34:15,171 --> 01:34:18,240
I am journaling and going
to whole foods twice a day.

3711
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:18,870
Well it was a,

3712
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:20,860
it was a fascinating dude
because he was doing it again.

3713
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:25,920
He had gotten one rich woman to marry
him and then he was there at the party

3714
01:34:25,931 --> 01:34:27,100
with an older rich woman.

3715
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:27,740
Ah,

3716
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:28,573
that's fascinating.

3717
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:29,210
Yeah.

3718
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:30,820
Setting a woman.

3719
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:31,450
Fascinating.

3720
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:32,560
People are so sad.

3721
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:33,161
Well it's,

3722
01:34:33,161 --> 01:34:33,580
you know,

3723
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:34,840
people need things in some,

3724
01:34:34,841 --> 01:34:35,171
you know,

3725
01:34:35,171 --> 01:34:36,660
some women don't need a us,

3726
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:39,350
a guy who some wild motherfucker
was going to run away.

3727
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:40,660
You need some bitch ass.

3728
01:34:40,661 --> 01:34:42,170
It needs you to pay the
bills and pretending.

3729
01:34:42,171 --> 01:34:43,004
Yeah.

3730
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:43,971
Well there was like that,

3731
01:34:43,971 --> 01:34:48,050
this whole article in the Atlantic
magazine about how we used to think of it

3732
01:34:48,051 --> 01:34:50,390
being like part of the
black culture that um,

3733
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:54,170
that it would be like the
dudes were either playboys,

3734
01:34:54,171 --> 01:34:55,220
like if they're successful,

3735
01:34:55,221 --> 01:34:57,500
like they can have lots
of chicks or a deadbeat.

3736
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:58,520
Like you would have to kind of,

3737
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:00,080
as a woman who is successful,

3738
01:35:00,081 --> 01:35:02,920
you have to like take on a
deadbeat or cheese and it should,

3739
01:35:02,921 --> 01:35:03,350
it's not,

3740
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:04,340
but it's not anymore.

3741
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:06,080
That's totally everybody.

3742
01:35:06,081 --> 01:35:07,520
It's not just for one community.

3743
01:35:07,521 --> 01:35:08,690
Like that's how it is now.

3744
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:09,380
Yeah.

3745
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:09,711
With,

3746
01:35:09,711 --> 01:35:09,980
uh,

3747
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:14,390
with dudes because women are succeeding
more and more and guys like there's like

3748
01:35:14,391 --> 01:35:15,224
that plateau.

3749
01:35:15,420 --> 01:35:15,661
Well,

3750
01:35:15,661 --> 01:35:18,990
there's certainly positions
where the roles are reversed,

3751
01:35:18,991 --> 01:35:20,310
where the woman's taken care of the man,

3752
01:35:20,370 --> 01:35:21,960
especially older women and younger,

3753
01:35:21,961 --> 01:35:22,501
better looking,

3754
01:35:22,501 --> 01:35:23,334
man,

3755
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:24,690
that shit's like super common.

3756
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:24,961
Yeah.

3757
01:35:24,961 --> 01:35:25,800
As long as a woman,

3758
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:30,700
it's like just like men and the young
girls that are like a little bit lost and

3759
01:35:30,701 --> 01:35:31,790
they take care of them and that,

3760
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:32,170
you know,

3761
01:35:32,170 --> 01:35:35,460
they're older men with a lot of
money that that shit's going on.

3762
01:35:35,490 --> 01:35:36,810
Especially in this economy.

3763
01:35:37,110 --> 01:35:37,381
There's,

3764
01:35:37,381 --> 01:35:39,120
there's guys that are putting
their ass up in the air.

3765
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:40,250
Oh my God.

3766
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:41,800
The branded over hook me up.

3767
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:44,120
I can get you hooked up if
you ever been to that website.

3768
01:35:44,121 --> 01:35:44,510
Legs.

3769
01:35:44,510 --> 01:35:46,810
Howard stern always talks
about cougar life Europe,

3770
01:35:46,811 --> 01:35:47,690
been to that website.

3771
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:49,220
It's a website with cougars.

3772
01:35:49,221 --> 01:35:51,050
I just want to get down and fuck.

3773
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,900
And so you get all these girls that have
been taken care of that just got out of

3774
01:35:53,901 --> 01:35:54,450
a divorce.

3775
01:35:54,450 --> 01:35:55,550
Now they're super rich.

3776
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:56,790
It's kind of interesting.

3777
01:35:57,270 --> 01:36:01,290
I find it hard to believe that those
hot ones need a fucking website.

3778
01:36:01,291 --> 01:36:04,350
I think those girls are getting Dick
hurled at them everywhere they go.

3779
01:36:04,351 --> 01:36:04,771
I just,

3780
01:36:04,771 --> 01:36:05,210
yeah,

3781
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:05,730
I hard.

3782
01:36:05,730 --> 01:36:08,490
I find it hard to believe that
if they don't have friends,

3783
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,470
it's this summer.

3784
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:11,011
What's the idea?

3785
01:36:11,011 --> 01:36:11,461
What the site,

3786
01:36:11,461 --> 01:36:15,150
is it like it's like a go to dinner
or is it like just come over and fuck.

3787
01:36:15,151 --> 01:36:18,120
Let's go out and eat how
it is awesome drinks.

3788
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:19,170
They know bill in the house.

3789
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:22,030
30 or 40 days of moisture.

3790
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,640
I know want to use every
day packs in fleet.

3791
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:26,850
Rest the life.

3792
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:29,210
No permanent state of hibernation,

3793
01:36:29,211 --> 01:36:30,680
and they gotta sneak lube in there,

3794
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:32,090
which is always embarrassing,

3795
01:36:32,350 --> 01:36:33,040
you know,

3796
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,420
to imagine actually brought the bone.

3797
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:34,821
The girls.

3798
01:36:34,821 --> 01:36:35,000
Got It.

3799
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:35,180
Okay.

3800
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:35,790
Sneaks.

3801
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,760
Looms sneak some lube in there.

3802
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:38,581
I'll be right back.

3803
01:36:38,581 --> 01:36:39,390
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

3804
01:36:39,390 --> 01:36:42,470
She goes to the bathroom and
sneak some blue in their boxes.

3805
01:36:42,471 --> 01:36:43,430
Done the boxes.

3806
01:36:43,431 --> 01:36:44,510
Docs is done online.

3807
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:45,360
It's a sandbag.

3808
01:36:45,410 --> 01:36:46,340
You're fucking a sandbag,

3809
01:36:46,341 --> 01:36:46,940
right?

3810
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:47,773
The Mojave.

3811
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,060
You're fucking two slabs of beef jerky.

3812
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:53,430
That is so make them
to about a beef jerky.

3813
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:54,970
Talking about my future right now.

3814
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:57,190
All Callisto you're,

3815
01:36:57,191 --> 01:37:00,380
you're hands and cows can you inside of
your vagina if you are like a hooker.

3816
01:37:00,381 --> 01:37:02,510
I just insisted on fucking all day,

3817
01:37:02,511 --> 01:37:02,961
every day.

3818
01:37:02,961 --> 01:37:06,470
He really had a lot of money that
you owed and you tag them all.

3819
01:37:06,471 --> 01:37:07,310
Come on next.

3820
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:08,173
Next.

3821
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:10,210
Which is it possible to get
a callus and you're posting?

3822
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:10,380
Okay.

3823
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:10,591
Yeah.

3824
01:37:10,591 --> 01:37:11,610
It's like skinning your knee.

3825
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:12,511
Yeah,

3826
01:37:12,511 --> 01:37:12,901
maybe.

3827
01:37:12,901 --> 01:37:13,681
I bet it would have to.

3828
01:37:13,681 --> 01:37:14,910
If you let it heal a little bit,

3829
01:37:14,911 --> 01:37:15,930
it would probably countless.

3830
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:17,003
Wow.

3831
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:17,903
But who has time?

3832
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:18,773
That's rough.

3833
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:19,643
Who has the time?

3834
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:23,090
What do you think is the number the
woman was fuck the most dudes ever.

3835
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:24,740
What did they do that work at once?

3836
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:25,011
Yeah.

3837
01:37:25,011 --> 01:37:25,350
No,

3838
01:37:25,350 --> 01:37:26,183
in her life.

3839
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:27,320
Oh Gosh.

3840
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:28,190
Different dudes.

3841
01:37:28,590 --> 01:37:29,460
It's gotta be a lot.

3842
01:37:29,490 --> 01:37:31,830
We had a male porn star in a
podcast recently and it was like,

3843
01:37:31,831 --> 01:37:32,190
how much?

3844
01:37:32,190 --> 01:37:33,870
How many people did you fuck last,

3845
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:34,500
uh,

3846
01:37:34,500 --> 01:37:35,340
last year?

3847
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:36,241
And he was just like,

3848
01:37:36,241 --> 01:37:37,130
I don't know a lot.

3849
01:37:37,150 --> 01:37:37,411
I'm like,

3850
01:37:37,411 --> 01:37:39,480
would you say over 200?

3851
01:37:39,481 --> 01:37:41,190
He's like probably weighs over 300.

3852
01:37:41,191 --> 01:37:41,490
And I'm like,

3853
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:42,323
what?

3854
01:37:42,530 --> 01:37:42,681
Well,

3855
01:37:42,681 --> 01:37:43,240
he's singing about it.

3856
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:44,300
If he's a porn star,

3857
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:47,060
he's probably working
how many days a week?

3858
01:37:47,450 --> 01:37:48,650
Probably like four or five.

3859
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:49,640
Four or five days a week.

3860
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:51,170
And how many different
girls you think you fucked?

3861
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:51,770
I don't know.

3862
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:55,060
It usually like a lot of these movies
you're doing like the whole movie,

3863
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:56,070
like one sitting

3864
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,770
like four different scenes
for different group one day.

3865
01:37:58,800 --> 01:37:59,120
Yeah.

3866
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,380
Usually you have to that one day.

3867
01:38:01,590 --> 01:38:02,423
Oh he probably,

3868
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:04,200
I don't think they come alive,

3869
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:05,340
but that's why the end.

3870
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:08,340
That's the most disappointing thing when
you watched a porn and the guy's like,

3871
01:38:08,370 --> 01:38:09,203
oh,

3872
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:14,280
that's what I'm trying to shake it.

3873
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:17,880
He chitty bang and the girl's like
getting her spit bubbles on it to make it

3874
01:38:17,881 --> 01:38:19,080
seem to me like as if it's bigger.

3875
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:20,940
I see what's going on there.

3876
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:24,540
That's nothing very small.

3877
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:26,530
An unimpressive load,

3878
01:38:26,531 --> 01:38:27,364
sir.

3879
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:29,340
I don't know about other girls,

3880
01:38:29,341 --> 01:38:31,220
but for me the size of the load is,

3881
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:33,170
does not matter doesn't it?

3882
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:34,200
You'd like all of it.

3883
01:38:34,210 --> 01:38:34,530
Oh,

3884
01:38:34,530 --> 01:38:37,140
wouldn't you be more excited if we
got came like a whole shit load.

3885
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:37,621
Like wow,

3886
01:38:37,621 --> 01:38:38,331
he's so excited.

3887
01:38:38,331 --> 01:38:38,521
Like it was.

3888
01:38:38,521 --> 01:38:39,354
It all is.

3889
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:41,250
And then instead of a guy like this,

3890
01:38:41,251 --> 01:38:41,521
then yeah,

3891
01:38:41,521 --> 01:38:42,261
I guess it's pretty good.

3892
01:38:42,261 --> 01:38:43,094
I'll just drop a load here.

3893
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,080
Doesn't seem very enthusiastic.

3894
01:38:46,081 --> 01:38:47,250
Not very complementary.

3895
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:48,781
I wouldn't,

3896
01:38:48,781 --> 01:38:50,070
I don't think I would take it personally.

3897
01:38:56,110 --> 01:39:00,030
That excited about to cut you off for
a week and see if we could pick up the

3898
01:39:00,031 --> 01:39:01,050
volume soldier.

3899
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:04,500
Some girls were into that though.

3900
01:39:04,930 --> 01:39:05,280
Yeah.

3901
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:06,420
Some girls like big loads.

3902
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:07,823
They find that Brian.

3903
01:39:07,870 --> 01:39:08,110
Uh,

3904
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:08,640
yeah.

3905
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:10,890
I think that don't like the thick ones.

3906
01:39:10,891 --> 01:39:11,131
You know,

3907
01:39:11,131 --> 01:39:13,080
once in a while when you
don't have a lot of water.

3908
01:39:13,081 --> 01:39:14,060
You've been drinking a lot.

3909
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:16,050
It's so unhealthy dude.

3910
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,180
Really Thick Yogurt.

3911
01:39:19,130 --> 01:39:19,591
Yeah,

3912
01:39:19,591 --> 01:39:20,880
like it's like almost like lumpy,

3913
01:39:20,881 --> 01:39:23,760
like mashed potato or cottage
cheesy or something like that.

3914
01:39:23,761 --> 01:39:24,900
Frozen yogurt loads.

3915
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:26,153
I love that.

3916
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:29,890
It's like great.

3917
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,950
It's funny that some girls
actually do like loads.

3918
01:39:37,951 --> 01:39:39,120
They like the swallow.

3919
01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:44,003
Some girls love it.

3920
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:45,210
It's like their favorite thing.

3921
01:39:45,211 --> 01:39:46,044
Loads of their mouth.

3922
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:50,420
Yeah.

3923
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:52,710
The summer you've had a few coronas,

3924
01:39:52,711 --> 01:39:53,700
you could use the salt.

3925
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:00,210
Is it good for your skin?

3926
01:40:00,211 --> 01:40:02,130
Is that I look so young,

3927
01:40:02,131 --> 01:40:02,610
Joe.

3928
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:04,350
That's why you guys say that.

3929
01:40:04,490 --> 01:40:05,323
Yeah,

3930
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:07,111
I would think so.

3931
01:40:07,111 --> 01:40:08,430
Probably do just as good a job.

3932
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:13,600
Is that shit real boy?

3933
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:13,990
Yeah.

3934
01:40:13,990 --> 01:40:14,740
That's a legit,

3935
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:16,020
is it still around?

3936
01:40:18,630 --> 01:40:21,330
Isn't that like supposed to
keep women a young forever.

3937
01:40:23,570 --> 01:40:25,260
I've got something better
that you should try.

3938
01:40:25,261 --> 01:40:25,610
We'll talk.

3939
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:26,443
I don't think so.

3940
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,650
Do you guys remember the Solo Flex woman?

3941
01:40:28,651 --> 01:40:29,640
There was like a 50 year old.

3942
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:34,470
Do you remember that pitch was hot and
she was like 50 and she's on cougar life

3943
01:40:34,471 --> 01:40:35,304
now.

3944
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,930
You think she's still rocking it when
you're 50 and like 2003 that's a long time

3945
01:40:39,931 --> 01:40:40,764
ago man.

3946
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:42,300
Back then you were hot,

3947
01:40:42,301 --> 01:40:44,190
but the wall is near.

3948
01:40:44,910 --> 01:40:46,590
Not much you can do about that.

3949
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:51,780
You know God aging as a woman just seems
like so often it's a mother fucker for

3950
01:40:51,781 --> 01:40:53,280
everybody and that's going to,

3951
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:54,123
how old are you?

3952
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:55,980
30 there's no getting around it either.

3953
01:40:56,030 --> 01:40:56,711
Five more years.

3954
01:40:56,711 --> 01:40:57,340
So you hit the wall.

3955
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:59,910
You think exercise is
the only thing so nice.

3956
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:01,180
You can hold it off a little bit.

3957
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:02,290
If you stay in shape,

3958
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:03,930
hold it off a little bit.

3959
01:41:03,950 --> 01:41:04,390
Run.

3960
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:05,580
I think that keeps people young.

3961
01:41:05,590 --> 01:41:06,010
Sure.

3962
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:06,191
Yeah.

3963
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:07,480
But your knees are going to get jacked.

3964
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:08,470
You run on the concrete.

3965
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,080
Are you running on?

3966
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:09,510
No,

3967
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:11,410
I run either on the treadmill or a dirt.

3968
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:11,521
Well,

3969
01:41:11,521 --> 01:41:12,030
that's thing.

3970
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:12,800
Yeah.

3971
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:13,720
I use my stuff.

3972
01:41:13,721 --> 01:41:15,230
I roll on just to sleep in our children.

3973
01:41:15,231 --> 01:41:16,270
Run on your toes,

3974
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:18,130
you know they say like those toe shoes.

3975
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:19,270
That's really the way to run.

3976
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:19,460
Yeah,

3977
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:20,890
but then I'll be a douche bag.

3978
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:23,760
Do you have those shoes?

3979
01:41:23,761 --> 01:41:24,161
I have them,

3980
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:24,330
yeah.

3981
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:25,163
That's hilarious.

3982
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:26,990
I don't wear 'em except to work out.

3983
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,420
I wasn't going to work out.

3984
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:28,580
I,

3985
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:29,500
I'm going to kick the back.

3986
01:41:29,501 --> 01:41:32,250
Sometimes if it's cold outside
really are like little piglet,

3987
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:35,170
but Jim is in my garage and sometimes
it's like if it's 40 degrees out,

3988
01:41:35,171 --> 01:41:36,520
I'm working out at 40 degrees.

3989
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:40,870
It's hard to kick a leather
bag with serious fitness.

3990
01:41:40,871 --> 01:41:41,231
Dude.

3991
01:41:41,231 --> 01:41:42,500
When I see people like running,

3992
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:46,530
I see people running around central
park in those footies and I'm just right

3993
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:47,550
now.

3994
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:48,850
Is it helping you that much?

3995
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:50,700
What it is is the,

3996
01:41:50,701 --> 01:41:53,420
the way people run is an unnatural way.

3997
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:57,140
The way people run where you go
heal and then down to your toes.

3998
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:57,440
Yeah.

3999
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:58,490
That's not how you run.

4000
01:41:58,491 --> 01:42:00,590
If you were running out
barefoot in the world,

4001
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:00,990
right,

4002
01:42:00,990 --> 01:42:01,310
you were,

4003
01:42:01,310 --> 01:42:05,510
you would run and you would use the
natural design of your foot as a shock

4004
01:42:05,511 --> 01:42:06,344
absorber.

4005
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:09,440
And that's what people do instead of
drop down on your heel because you have a

4006
01:42:09,441 --> 01:42:10,460
big pad there.

4007
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:10,780
Yeah.

4008
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:13,940
Because a shoe company has put an
artificial pad in the back of your heel.

4009
01:42:13,941 --> 01:42:14,270
They,

4010
01:42:14,270 --> 01:42:16,070
they literally changed the way people run.

4011
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:16,191
Yeah.

4012
01:42:16,191 --> 01:42:19,600
But don't we offer that before that
people would have to run and do.

4013
01:42:19,610 --> 01:42:22,250
The natural way to do is to land
on the ball of your foot and you,

4014
01:42:22,251 --> 01:42:23,780
if you look at the design of the foot,

4015
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:27,860
your foot bends and gives you land on
the toe and the ball of the foot and then

4016
01:42:27,861 --> 01:42:30,320
it gives and what these shoes and any,

4017
01:42:30,321 --> 01:42:33,650
any barefoot like exercise program.

4018
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:36,710
I lift weights barefoot and a I'll do,

4019
01:42:36,760 --> 01:42:37,160
um,

4020
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:38,330
a lot of different things,

4021
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:39,741
different exercises,

4022
01:42:39,741 --> 01:42:40,131
barefoot.

4023
01:42:40,131 --> 01:42:44,300
And the idea behind it is that that is
that that's a natural way for your body

4024
01:42:44,301 --> 01:42:46,340
to carry stress and to move things around.

4025
01:42:46,490 --> 01:42:49,160
And that if you run on the
ball of your foot like that,

4026
01:42:49,190 --> 01:42:53,210
it actually saves your body all the
damage that a lot of people get from the

4027
01:42:53,211 --> 01:42:55,680
pounding of a of knees.

4028
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:57,770
So that's why the tone
wasn't the natural way.

4029
01:42:57,771 --> 01:42:59,150
Not Be on concrete though.

4030
01:42:59,270 --> 01:42:59,750
Yes,

4031
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:00,411
you're absolutely right.

4032
01:43:00,411 --> 01:43:03,050
And that's just like a
fucking concrete concretes,

4033
01:43:03,051 --> 01:43:04,520
bad period for anybody,

4034
01:43:04,521 --> 01:43:05,360
any way you run.

4035
01:43:05,390 --> 01:43:05,841
It's just,

4036
01:43:05,841 --> 01:43:06,560
it's hard.

4037
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,150
It doesn't give nice dirt.

4038
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:10,130
Like if you're on it
like a nice dirt hill,

4039
01:43:10,190 --> 01:43:11,660
you know when you hit that thing,

4040
01:43:11,661 --> 01:43:13,190
it compacts a little compact.

4041
01:43:13,191 --> 01:43:16,790
So there's a nice dirt hill near a
house that I used to run until there was

4042
01:43:16,791 --> 01:43:19,100
three fucking mountain lions
signings in my neighborhood.

4043
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,360
The routine now running this hill anymore.

4044
01:43:22,810 --> 01:43:23,250
But uh,

4045
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:25,060
it was a nice steep dirt hill.

4046
01:43:25,061 --> 01:43:29,620
And you could feel it give as
you ran into her in the sand.

4047
01:43:29,890 --> 01:43:30,161
No,

4048
01:43:30,161 --> 01:43:30,390
no.

4049
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:31,780
Running in the sand is fantastic for you.

4050
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:32,290
Yeah.

4051
01:43:32,290 --> 01:43:32,531
I mean,

4052
01:43:32,531 --> 01:43:33,580
you've got to build your body up.

4053
01:43:33,581 --> 01:43:35,370
I wouldn't recommend it to
someone who's not shame.

4054
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:35,570
Oh,

4055
01:43:35,570 --> 01:43:37,780
I loved running on the beach
and then like barefoot.

4056
01:43:37,781 --> 01:43:40,660
But then I heard like who told you
there's anything wrong with that?

4057
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:41,920
Sand is great.

4058
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:42,460
No,

4059
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:44,020
I was going to say piece of advice.

4060
01:43:44,021 --> 01:43:46,900
I'm going to probably go
get those shoes running.

4061
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:47,773
The sand is hard.

4062
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:48,610
It's hard to run.

4063
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:50,320
I mean as long as you
don't step on something.

4064
01:43:50,321 --> 01:43:50,910
But if you know,

4065
01:43:50,910 --> 01:43:50,990
if,

4066
01:43:50,990 --> 01:43:51,380
if you know,

4067
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:54,380
if you step on something
you're fuck broken bottles
and shedding me if you trust

4068
01:43:54,381 --> 01:43:55,214
the beach.

4069
01:43:55,370 --> 01:43:56,130
But if you're a,

4070
01:43:56,130 --> 01:43:57,280
if you're running barefoot in the sand,

4071
01:43:57,281 --> 01:43:58,130
it's really good for you.

4072
01:43:58,130 --> 01:43:58,610
That's good.

4073
01:43:58,610 --> 01:43:58,881
Yeah.

4074
01:43:58,881 --> 01:44:00,250
So was running sand dunes.

4075
01:44:00,270 --> 01:44:02,090
That's fucking up incredibly good for you.

4076
01:44:02,091 --> 01:44:02,301
It's me.

4077
01:44:02,301 --> 01:44:03,530
Insane is,

4078
01:44:03,531 --> 01:44:05,000
I'm always in hotels of course.

4079
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:08,840
And in hotel gyms when people
just come in to just check it out,

4080
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:11,090
don't you always see like
couple of things they just like,

4081
01:44:11,091 --> 01:44:12,000
they'll come down like that.

4082
01:44:12,940 --> 01:44:13,773
It's like it,

4083
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:14,631
that's a gym.

4084
01:44:14,631 --> 01:44:15,431
Like you can tell how,

4085
01:44:15,431 --> 01:44:16,850
how nice the hotel is.

4086
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:18,380
You're going to know how nice the gym,

4087
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:19,160
like what do you,

4088
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:19,491
it's just,

4089
01:44:19,491 --> 01:44:20,001
I don't know why.

4090
01:44:20,001 --> 01:44:21,200
It just makes me so mad.

4091
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:23,710
Why you don't like being
looked at why you're a oils.

4092
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:24,550
I love being.

4093
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:24,770
Look

4094
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:25,541
that what it is.

4095
01:44:25,541 --> 01:44:26,890
They just come in and they don't commit.

4096
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:27,753
They don't send,

4097
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,040
someone's going to flirt with
me while we trained together.

4098
01:44:30,041 --> 01:44:30,450
Yeah,

4099
01:44:30,450 --> 01:44:30,940
yeah.

4100
01:44:30,940 --> 01:44:31,773
That's it.

4101
01:44:31,950 --> 01:44:32,220
You know?

4102
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:34,820
That's what cool thing about these
mirrors there in the corners.

4103
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:35,800
You just look one way.

4104
01:44:35,801 --> 01:44:36,870
Then even know if you're looking at that

4105
01:44:38,670 --> 01:44:39,730
on the ceilings in here,

4106
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:42,790
what are you laughing appropriately
at like an episode of friends,

4107
01:44:44,090 --> 01:44:45,700
so he has to say,

4108
01:44:45,701 --> 01:44:46,660
what is so funny?

4109
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:47,501
Oh my God,

4110
01:44:47,501 --> 01:44:49,180
I forgot how funny friends was.

4111
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:49,391
Oh,

4112
01:44:49,391 --> 01:44:50,380
it was more of my favorite.

4113
01:44:50,381 --> 01:44:51,214
Shows

4114
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:55,260
me the worst dating coach.

4115
01:44:55,270 --> 01:44:56,103
You'd be the worst

4116
01:44:57,970 --> 01:44:58,960
of all time.

4117
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:03,060
Just creating scenarios
are coming up with answers.

4118
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,170
Dudes have questions.

4119
01:45:05,300 --> 01:45:07,030
You know Amy Schumer's at the gym,

4120
01:45:07,031 --> 01:45:08,290
how am I going to make this happen?

4121
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:08,660
Yeah.

4122
01:45:08,660 --> 01:45:10,220
By laughing loudly at France.

4123
01:45:10,570 --> 01:45:11,300
Really,

4124
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:12,133
really loud.

4125
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:15,130
The girl would be the one who
laughed really loudly and see.

4126
01:45:15,131 --> 01:45:18,640
You're upset that the people come in
where they just look because they're not

4127
01:45:18,641 --> 01:45:19,510
going to play your game.

4128
01:45:19,900 --> 01:45:21,700
You feel like this is another person.

4129
01:45:21,701 --> 01:45:23,590
This is a new player,

4130
01:45:23,710 --> 01:45:24,580
has entered the game.

4131
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:27,400
You know when you're at the gym and
you're on your little lipstick go machine

4132
01:45:27,401 --> 01:45:29,110
and you listen to you Donna Summers music,

4133
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:38,830
I'm picturing you with a purple iPod.

4134
01:45:38,831 --> 01:45:39,521
Nano,

4135
01:45:39,521 --> 01:45:39,760
the,

4136
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:40,250
no,

4137
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,200
not even a nano.

4138
01:45:41,201 --> 01:45:41,740
What's the one?

4139
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:43,650
The clip on the clip while

4140
01:45:49,030 --> 01:45:49,900
legwarmers dude,

4141
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:54,220
you have no shoes on because
they haven't invented,

4142
01:45:54,221 --> 01:45:55,054
choose yet.

4143
01:45:59,420 --> 01:45:59,951
Get upset.

4144
01:45:59,951 --> 01:46:02,290
You look up and it's some
people just looking at the gym,

4145
01:46:02,300 --> 01:46:03,200
you fuckers

4146
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:04,440
all wrong at the gym.

4147
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:05,491
You me all wrong.

4148
01:46:05,491 --> 01:46:08,040
If the gene is your mindset when
you go to the chat and what is the,

4149
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:09,480
what's the thought process?

4150
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:14,330
I listened to Biggie
and odd future and um,

4151
01:46:14,730 --> 01:46:17,790
am I listen a bad shit
and I run like I'm angry.

4152
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:18,643
You're angry.

4153
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:21,030
And about when you're
really pushing yourself.

4154
01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:23,670
Do you think about the ex boyfriend with
a knife running through the apartment

4155
01:46:23,671 --> 01:46:24,190
complex?

4156
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:26,310
Did you said cause that's
what I think about you.

4157
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:28,530
And then I stopped,

4158
01:46:28,531 --> 01:46:33,531
I paused the treadmill so I can come
and then I get that and I just pushed

4159
01:46:33,651 --> 01:46:34,420
through.

4160
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:37,500
She is orgasm without even knowing it.

4161
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:41,550
Did you realize that a lot of women are
admitting now that there was a study

4162
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:42,393
done?

4163
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:46,740
A lot of women are achieving
orgasm during strenuous exercise.

4164
01:46:46,810 --> 01:46:47,420
What?

4165
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:48,030
Yes.

4166
01:46:48,030 --> 01:46:48,863
Very common.

4167
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:49,420
Yeah.

4168
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:50,010
What are they

4169
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:50,420
doing?

4170
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:51,253
Let me know.

4171
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:52,720
I'll,

4172
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:53,530
I'll Google it here.

4173
01:46:53,530 --> 01:46:54,780
Study shows.

4174
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:57,690
Just put this little balls in there
and I was so sick in the hospital.

4175
01:46:57,691 --> 01:46:59,250
I haven't masturbated in like a week.

4176
01:46:59,251 --> 01:46:59,611
Really?

4177
01:46:59,611 --> 01:46:59,911
Yeah.

4178
01:46:59,911 --> 01:47:01,080
I like forgot about it.

4179
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:01,914
That's how sick I was.

4180
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:04,230
I haven't thought about
masturbate with another guy.

4181
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,100
Like a real stupid fuck.

4182
01:47:07,230 --> 01:47:07,800
Yeah.

4183
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:08,131
Um,

4184
01:47:08,131 --> 01:47:09,690
I guess cause when you
were together a long time,

4185
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:13,110
women athletes for women have
orgasms at the gym study shows.

4186
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:13,980
Wow.

4187
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:14,161
Yeah,

4188
01:47:14,161 --> 01:47:14,760
that's really true.

4189
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:16,070
What are they doing at the gym?

4190
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:21,260
Findings and their trainers findings add
qualitative and quantitative data to a

4191
01:47:22,291 --> 01:47:26,280
field that has been largely
unstudied I'll field.

4192
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:27,300
Yes.

4193
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:27,720
What,

4194
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:29,820
what really makes the vaginal go pop pop,

4195
01:47:29,821 --> 01:47:30,390
pop.

4196
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:31,380
That's my field,

4197
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:31,950
my field.

4198
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:34,680
I'm in the old gas of field of field as a,

4199
01:47:34,681 --> 01:47:34,981
as a,

4200
01:47:34,981 --> 01:47:36,210
as women's orgasms.

4201
01:47:36,211 --> 01:47:37,044
Been a field,

4202
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:37,860
um,

4203
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:40,140
largely unstudied according
to researcher Debbie.

4204
01:47:40,141 --> 01:47:40,411
Oh,

4205
01:47:40,411 --> 01:47:40,801
Debbie,

4206
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:41,600
you silly bitch.

4207
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:42,100
Debbie.

4208
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:46,820
Debbie always thinking about
our club loves posting day.

4209
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:47,370
Debbie.

4210
01:47:47,370 --> 01:47:49,920
Debbie probably has a flashlight and
she's like licks it while she was sitting

4211
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:52,550
close to me.

4212
01:47:52,590 --> 01:47:53,460
So awesome.

4213
01:47:53,461 --> 01:47:54,510
This is my field.

4214
01:47:54,511 --> 01:47:56,520
I'm doing research on
my phone in the field.

4215
01:47:56,520 --> 01:47:57,001
You guys,

4216
01:47:57,001 --> 01:47:57,661
you can't talk.

4217
01:47:57,661 --> 01:47:57,961
Debbie,

4218
01:47:57,961 --> 01:47:58,591
you're awesome.

4219
01:47:58,591 --> 01:47:59,460
Thank you for your work.

4220
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:03,480
Co Director of the Center for Sexual
Health Promotion at Indiana University.

4221
01:48:03,930 --> 01:48:04,440
For instance,

4222
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:09,180
Alfred Kinsey and his colleagues first
reported the phenomenon in 1953 saying

4223
01:48:09,181 --> 01:48:12,930
about 5% of women they had interviewed
mentioned orgasm linked to physical

4224
01:48:12,931 --> 01:48:13,620
exercise.

4225
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:14,100
Wow,

4226
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:15,270
that's fucking awesome.

4227
01:48:15,271 --> 01:48:16,440
For those five checks,

4228
01:48:16,770 --> 01:48:17,880
what is the spring?

4229
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:22,440
The report of so called core orgasms
named because of their seeming link.

4230
01:48:22,441 --> 01:48:27,270
Two exercises for core abdominal muscles
have circulated in the media for years

4231
01:48:27,271 --> 01:48:28,380
according to the researchers.

4232
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,450
So apparently it's working your core.

4233
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:33,270
So the getting on the knees
and tightening up the pussy.

4234
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:34,290
That shit's real.

4235
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:34,770
Yeah.

4236
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:36,810
Well you want to do is
you get on your knees.

4237
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:37,291
Okay.

4238
01:48:37,291 --> 01:48:40,080
And I don't want you to rock
your ass back to your heels.

4239
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:40,471
Okay.

4240
01:48:40,471 --> 01:48:43,560
Pull yourself up with your abs
while you're squeezing your pussy.

4241
01:48:44,010 --> 01:48:45,930
Why don't I just rub my clit?

4242
01:48:47,330 --> 01:48:50,300
What like why all the while the work,

4243
01:48:50,310 --> 01:48:53,190
you do this while you're at work and no
one even knows you do it while you're

4244
01:48:53,191 --> 01:48:56,370
performing some exercise and
you get some good solid try it.

4245
01:48:56,371 --> 01:49:01,371
Right now it's a rockstar in the works
of the women who had orgasms drain 45%

4246
01:49:02,171 --> 01:49:04,950
said the first experience was
linked to abdominal exercises,

4247
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:10,280
45% 19 due to biking and spinning nine
point to full dance floor masters.

4248
01:49:10,570 --> 01:49:11,550
Robin likes to spin it.

4249
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:12,993
Yeah,

4250
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:17,610
I can see spinning 9.3 on a
bicycle to climbing poles or ropes.

4251
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:17,880
Oh,

4252
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:20,010
my stomach is still out from
all the saline solution.

4253
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:22,470
7% reported a connection
with weightlifting.

4254
01:49:22,650 --> 01:49:23,790
What does the sailing solution,

4255
01:49:23,791 --> 01:49:24,570
they had a pump in New York.

4256
01:49:24,570 --> 01:49:25,403
The pumps?

4257
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:26,171
Yeah.

4258
01:49:26,171 --> 01:49:26,650
They put,

4259
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:31,540
they pump five big ivy
bags in and so like I'm,

4260
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:32,950
I feel like okay now,

4261
01:49:32,951 --> 01:49:34,130
but I still have all the Waterweight.

4262
01:49:34,131 --> 01:49:34,420
Yeah.

4263
01:49:34,420 --> 01:49:35,560
Now when you were really sick,

4264
01:49:35,561 --> 01:49:38,980
did you try to drink water or was
it dehydration from throwing up?

4265
01:49:39,230 --> 01:49:40,490
I tried by threw it up.

4266
01:49:40,550 --> 01:49:41,150
Wow.

4267
01:49:41,150 --> 01:49:44,000
I threw up on somebody giving
me x rays in the hospital.

4268
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:44,151
Yeah.

4269
01:49:44,151 --> 01:49:44,780
Whoa.

4270
01:49:44,780 --> 01:49:45,613
Yeah.

4271
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:46,401
It was bad.

4272
01:49:46,401 --> 01:49:46,990
Wow.

4273
01:49:46,990 --> 01:49:47,621
It was really,

4274
01:49:47,621 --> 01:49:48,350
really bad.

4275
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:48,530
What's,

4276
01:49:48,530 --> 01:49:52,000
so what did you call the place that
gave you the a crab cake in Phoenix?

4277
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:53,373
Um,

4278
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:53,770
the,

4279
01:49:53,770 --> 01:49:53,951
well,

4280
01:49:53,951 --> 01:49:55,270
it was at my hotel,

4281
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:58,210
but their insurance is paying whatever,

4282
01:49:58,211 --> 01:49:59,290
my insurance really,

4283
01:49:59,291 --> 01:50:00,910
so they've admitted that it's their fault,

4284
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:01,990
two meals that day.

4285
01:50:01,991 --> 01:50:03,850
And they were both at my hotel.

4286
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:04,810
Oh,

4287
01:50:04,810 --> 01:50:06,310
there's no question.

4288
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:06,611
No.

4289
01:50:06,611 --> 01:50:06,791
If,

4290
01:50:06,791 --> 01:50:07,421
ands or buts.

4291
01:50:07,421 --> 01:50:07,810
Yeah.

4292
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:08,470
Wow.

4293
01:50:08,470 --> 01:50:09,191
I was there working.

4294
01:50:09,191 --> 01:50:10,870
I'd done press all morning like they were,

4295
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:12,470
I didn't drink or anything like that.

4296
01:50:13,730 --> 01:50:14,570
They're being cool about it.

4297
01:50:14,571 --> 01:50:14,710
Yeah.

4298
01:50:14,710 --> 01:50:14,950
Hey,

4299
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:19,740
clams in Illinois and Man Tino Illinois
and kind of a fucking horribly sick once

4300
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:20,980
then that,

4301
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:21,251
you know,

4302
01:50:21,251 --> 01:50:21,731
that night,

4303
01:50:21,731 --> 01:50:22,391
like five,

4304
01:50:22,391 --> 01:50:23,320
six hours later,

4305
01:50:23,321 --> 01:50:23,830
it just started.

4306
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:24,460
It hit me.

4307
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:26,020
The cramping was the worst.

4308
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:26,470
Yeah.

4309
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:26,921
You know,

4310
01:50:26,921 --> 01:50:31,480
like when you're trying even kicked in
maybe an hour and a half after you ate

4311
01:50:31,481 --> 01:50:31,571
it.

4312
01:50:31,571 --> 01:50:32,470
Only an hour and a half.

4313
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:32,950
Yeah.

4314
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:33,783
Really?

4315
01:50:33,910 --> 01:50:34,271
Wow.

4316
01:50:34,271 --> 01:50:35,104
That's incredible.

4317
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:36,430
That must be really bad.

4318
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:36,901
It was,

4319
01:50:36,901 --> 01:50:38,410
you say it takes hours usually.

4320
01:50:38,411 --> 01:50:39,191
Sometimes it is,

4321
01:50:39,191 --> 01:50:39,491
but I,

4322
01:50:39,491 --> 01:50:41,590
I had the same thing happened to me like,

4323
01:50:41,630 --> 01:50:42,120
uh,

4324
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:42,921
about two months ago.

4325
01:50:42,921 --> 01:50:44,200
Where you driving home?

4326
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:44,591
I was like,

4327
01:50:44,591 --> 01:50:47,620
I'm gonna shit myself right now
and I feel it's make puke out.

4328
01:50:47,621 --> 01:50:48,720
The bubbling inside of you.

4329
01:50:48,730 --> 01:50:49,420
Yeah,

4330
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:50,081
it was bad.

4331
01:50:50,081 --> 01:50:50,351
It was,

4332
01:50:50,351 --> 01:50:51,460
it hit like a little,

4333
01:50:51,461 --> 01:50:52,480
like I'm an hour and a half,

4334
01:50:52,481 --> 01:50:54,130
two hours and then it really hit,

4335
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:57,020
the worst one ever got me
was from a mushroom pizza.

4336
01:50:57,470 --> 01:50:58,730
I was in Providence,

4337
01:50:58,731 --> 01:51:02,150
Rhode Island in a comedy club
and I ordered a mushroom pizza.

4338
01:51:02,151 --> 01:51:03,230
One of those frozen pizzas.

4339
01:51:03,231 --> 01:51:03,830
Yeah.

4340
01:51:03,830 --> 01:51:05,120
Holy Shit.

4341
01:51:05,121 --> 01:51:06,380
That was the only thing I ate.

4342
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:07,670
And Holy Shit,

4343
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:10,970
the mushrooms especially,

4344
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:13,520
it's very possible that in these places,

4345
01:51:13,521 --> 01:51:18,280
like they dehydrate things or rather a
defrost things and then refreeze them.

4346
01:51:18,410 --> 01:51:18,561
Oh,

4347
01:51:18,561 --> 01:51:19,370
and that's really bad.

4348
01:51:19,370 --> 01:51:20,240
Really bad.

4349
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:20,740
Yeah,

4350
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:21,141
for sure.

4351
01:51:21,141 --> 01:51:21,974
And Pizza now.

4352
01:51:21,980 --> 01:51:22,191
Yeah,

4353
01:51:22,191 --> 01:51:22,550
sure.

4354
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:23,030
You can.

4355
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:23,511
I don't think,

4356
01:51:23,511 --> 01:51:24,590
I can't imagine ever,

4357
01:51:24,591 --> 01:51:26,930
I couldn't even say the
word crab cake until today.

4358
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:30,620
Why I threw up when I was
a kid to some Jack Daniels,

4359
01:51:30,621 --> 01:51:31,480
I was like 14.

4360
01:51:32,350 --> 01:51:32,870
Oh,

4361
01:51:32,870 --> 01:51:34,550
the smiling first puking from booze.

4362
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:34,761
Yeah.

4363
01:51:34,761 --> 01:51:35,870
I threw up in a cab.

4364
01:51:35,871 --> 01:51:36,704
I threw up,

4365
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:38,350
I threw up on the streets.

4366
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:38,900
Did you drink?

4367
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:39,710
I don't remember.

4368
01:51:39,710 --> 01:51:40,580
It was a lot though.

4369
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:41,453
Yeah.

4370
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:42,470
While having sex.

4371
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:43,170
Have I?

4372
01:51:43,170 --> 01:51:43,460
Yeah.

4373
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:43,830
No.

4374
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:45,530
If you having been with
a girl that threw up,

4375
01:51:45,531 --> 01:51:46,364
we'll have them having,

4376
01:51:46,370 --> 01:51:47,210
having too close,

4377
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:49,550
like we were about to get it on
and then she started throwing up.

4378
01:51:50,480 --> 01:51:51,410
Oh my God.

4379
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:52,161
Yeah.

4380
01:51:52,161 --> 01:51:53,000
I've had that.

4381
01:51:53,210 --> 01:51:55,970
I had finished and her hair punch out,

4382
01:51:55,971 --> 01:51:56,804
took off month,

4383
01:51:57,740 --> 01:51:58,370
hold it down,

4384
01:51:58,370 --> 01:52:01,900
grab her hair and she tries to fight
cause he wanted to have an orgasm.

4385
01:52:01,940 --> 01:52:03,990
You get a pin down the
left arm with your Shin,

4386
01:52:04,190 --> 01:52:04,550
right arm,

4387
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:05,383
you know,

4388
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:07,761
horrible.

4389
01:52:07,761 --> 01:52:08,390
Holy Shit.

4390
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:09,021
That's your move.

4391
01:52:09,021 --> 01:52:10,460
That's games of Thrones style.

4392
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:11,353
That is,

4393
01:52:11,390 --> 01:52:13,020
that's the one thing you see by all the,

4394
01:52:13,050 --> 01:52:13,270
the,

4395
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:15,410
the raping and pillaging
going on back then.

4396
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:16,273
It's the best.

4397
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:17,650
That's really like you,

4398
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:18,890
that's really how people live.

4399
01:52:18,891 --> 01:52:20,120
They just took whatever they wanted.

4400
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:21,560
You really had to put out.

4401
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:23,330
Yeah.

4402
01:52:23,330 --> 01:52:25,310
There wasn't a lot of
arguing with barbarian.

4403
01:52:25,311 --> 01:52:25,421
Yeah.

4404
01:52:25,421 --> 01:52:26,120

4405
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:27,140
Oh let's wait.

4406
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:28,610
Let's wait a month.

4407
01:52:28,730 --> 01:52:29,200
It was like,

4408
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:29,660
um,

4409
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:30,530
get on your knees.

4410
01:52:30,610 --> 01:52:32,890
Do you find yourself
not attractive to a man?

4411
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:34,230
If he is a,

4412
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:39,460
if it was like struggling or if he's
like he doesn't have his shit together or

4413
01:52:39,461 --> 01:52:40,850
if he make less money than you.

4414
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:41,890
Wow.

4449
01:53:24,211 --> 01:53:27,960
I hope I have not met anybody
like whoever he is yet.

4450
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:28,351
But yeah,

4451

But I don't have to have one for you.

4456
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:43,020
Well like I want him to what?

4457
01:53:43,050 --> 01:53:46,110
He could be like something weird
like a sculptor or something.

4458
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:48,810
Like I don't need them
to have like a great job.

4459
01:53:48,830 --> 01:53:49,231
Well listen,

4460
01:53:49,231 --> 01:53:50,670
there's a lot of sculptors in Vegas.

4461
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:52,261
No,

4462
01:53:52,261 --> 01:53:53,430
I really don't want to do a sculptor.

4463
01:53:53,431 --> 01:53:58,230
That was a bad [inaudible]
have to work on like get a job.

I would,

4468
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:07,350
I really don't think I would ever date
a guy in finance or something like that.

4469
01:54:07,351 --> 01:54:08,760
Like some of these suit wearing.

4470
01:54:08,790 --> 01:54:11,520
I don't think I would date an a
guy that wore a suit to a thing.

4471
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:14,160

4473
01:54:14,611 --> 01:54:15,090
boring.

4474
01:54:15,090 --> 01:54:15,923
I can't relate

4475
01:54:16,330 --> 01:54:16,870
muscle.

4476
01:54:16,870 --> 01:54:17,770
We're normal guys.

4477
01:54:18,490 --> 01:54:20,530
One of my best friends is
an accountant and he's,

4478
01:54:20,531 --> 01:54:20,831
he's,

4479
01:54:20,831 --> 01:54:21,101
he's,

4480
01:54:21,101 --> 01:54:22,060
he's fucking crazy,

4481
01:54:23,350 --> 01:54:23,651
crazy.

4482
01:54:23,651 --> 01:54:24,484
He's just stuck,

4483
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:25,930
buttoned down all day.

4484
01:54:25,931 --> 01:54:29,130
But you know he loves like you when I
talked to him on the phone and he's crazy.

4485
01:54:29,150 --> 01:54:29,400
He's,

4486
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:29,730
he's,

4487
01:54:29,730 --> 01:54:30,461
he's a regular dude,

4488
01:54:30,461 --> 01:54:32,410
but he's just has a job
and he's good at it.

4489
01:54:32,650 --> 01:54:34,180
So he gets paid well.

4490
01:54:34,570 --> 01:54:36,460
So that's what he does.

4491
01:54:36,510 --> 01:54:37,450
And the cats and dogs.

4492
01:54:38,050 --> 01:54:39,100
I like dogs,

4493
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:41,133
hate cats

4494
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:43,353
kind of questions.

4495
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:46,330
You always bring something
down to a six year old level,

4496
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:50,440
writing out her profile for
what's your favorite color?

4497
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:52,540
Please tell me the truth.

4498
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:53,360
I knew.

4499
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:54,390
Do you know

4500
01:54:59,340 --> 01:55:01,930
or men are intimidated by the
fact you're your comedian ever?

4501
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:03,770
I would assume so.

4502
01:55:04,170 --> 01:55:04,950
I don't know.

4503
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:06,330
They don't want to start talking shit.

4504
01:55:07,260 --> 01:55:08,490
They've seen you at roasts,

4505
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:09,773
Mike Tyson.

4506
01:55:10,020 --> 01:55:12,930
You went head to head
with Mike Tyson foods.

4507
01:55:12,931 --> 01:55:14,370
Don't want to talk shit with you.

4508
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:16,411
What?

4509
01:55:16,411 --> 01:55:16,930
You're looking for?

4510
01:55:16,930 --> 01:55:18,030
Fireman from Hoboken.

4511
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:23,520
Just like a Patrick Swayze type dude
and a movie from the 1980s yeah.

4512
01:55:24,170 --> 01:55:25,003
Take your pants.

4513
01:55:27,320 --> 01:55:28,410
We're not trying to marry you off,

4514
01:55:28,411 --> 01:55:28,591
right.

4515
01:55:28,591 --> 01:55:29,130
We just,

4516
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:32,280
we went down that road and we
stuck with it for no reason.

4517
01:55:33,060 --> 01:55:33,893
Trying to get some entertainment.

4518
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:35,100
Here's the podcast.

4519
01:55:35,490 --> 01:55:37,870
Supposed to make it funny and
I'm like really telling Craig,

4520
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:39,071
here's the podcast.

4521
01:55:39,071 --> 01:55:39,940
She goes on a date,

4522
01:55:39,941 --> 01:55:42,970
every episode's a different date
that we hook you up to get her.

4523
01:55:43,530 --> 01:55:44,010
Yeah.

4524
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:44,401
Yeah.

4525
01:55:44,401 --> 01:55:46,050
You got to trust mentored in one week.

4526
01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:46,281
Yeah.

4527
01:55:46,281 --> 01:55:48,310
You can't trust men to
want to dudes are creepy.

4528
01:55:48,730 --> 01:55:49,181
It's a,

4529
01:55:49,181 --> 01:55:49,631
it'd be nice.

4530
01:55:49,631 --> 01:55:50,250
We could trust him.

4531
01:55:50,250 --> 01:55:52,270
Bootcamp people we know
though or something.

4532
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:53,051
Come on man.

4533
01:55:53,051 --> 01:55:53,510
How many dude?

4534
01:55:53,510 --> 01:55:53,870
You know,

4535
01:55:53,870 --> 01:55:54,470
I'm not going,

4536
01:55:54,470 --> 01:55:55,550
you guys aren't setting me up.

4537
01:55:55,551 --> 01:55:57,650
I really truly don't trust you guys.

4538
01:55:57,680 --> 01:55:58,130
Yeah,

4539
01:55:58,130 --> 01:55:59,420
exactly correct.

4540
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:00,500
A lot of black friends.

4541
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:01,513
It's fine.

4542
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:02,730
I've never been with a black guy.

4543
01:56:02,731 --> 01:56:04,460
He's got a lot of black
and lesbian friends,

4544
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:05,510
so he's got mixed.

4545
01:56:05,511 --> 01:56:06,360
Whatever you need,

4546
01:56:06,361 --> 01:56:07,041
that's going to shock you.

4547
01:56:07,041 --> 01:56:07,874
Parents,

4548
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:08,713
Asian girls,

4549
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:09,793
boys and girls.

4550
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:11,773
That's what I want.

4551
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:12,561
So is this,

4552
01:56:12,561 --> 01:56:12,741
this,

4553
01:56:12,741 --> 01:56:13,570
this thing that happened

4554
01:56:13,570 --> 01:56:14,530
today that I don't totally,

4555
01:56:14,531 --> 01:56:15,460
completely understand,

4556
01:56:15,461 --> 01:56:16,170
but it's some,

4557
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:16,660
uh,

4558
01:56:16,660 --> 01:56:17,770
new Obama,

4559
01:56:17,830 --> 01:56:20,410
a jobs act that he just signed in Matt.

4560
01:56:20,530 --> 01:56:23,860
He be wrote this blog about
how fucking terrible it is.

4561
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:24,873
What's the act?

4562
01:56:25,330 --> 01:56:26,950
I don't completely understand it.

4563
01:56:26,951 --> 01:56:31,450
But though the way it's been explained
to me is that essentially almost

4564
01:56:31,451 --> 01:56:32,770
legalizes fraud.

4565
01:56:33,190 --> 01:56:37,090
The idea is that it used to be if
you wanted to take a company public,

4566
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:40,810
you had to file all sorts of paperwork
and have a hiring an account and have all

4567
01:56:40,811 --> 01:56:43,240
these financial statements in place.

4568
01:56:43,390 --> 01:56:46,570
But now they say you don't need to hire
an accountant before the company is

4569
01:56:46,571 --> 01:56:47,231
taking public,

4570
01:56:47,231 --> 01:56:50,650
nor do you need to do so for five
years after the company goes public.

4571
01:56:50,890 --> 01:56:55,890
So it's almost like you can fucking lie
about your financial statements for five

4572
01:56:56,111 --> 01:56:58,840
years without any independent
accounting of your claims.

4573
01:56:58,990 --> 01:57:00,880
I don't totally completely understand it.

4574
01:57:00,881 --> 01:57:01,600
I'm reading,

4575
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:05,470
Oh Matt Taibbi be getting money and lying.

4576
01:57:05,680 --> 01:57:08,500
And when public would things go
Publix manipulating the stock market,

4577
01:57:08,860 --> 01:57:09,220
um,

4578
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:10,660
I don't understand what,

4579
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:11,810
what the,

4580
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:13,330
the pros are of this,

4581
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:14,560
this thing it might have,

4582
01:57:14,590 --> 01:57:15,091
see when,

4583
01:57:15,091 --> 01:57:17,650
when they sign sign an act is,

4584
01:57:17,651 --> 01:57:18,510
there's usually a lot,

4585
01:57:18,511 --> 01:57:18,650
yeah.

4586
01:57:18,650 --> 01:57:19,670
Shit in there.

4587
01:57:19,940 --> 01:57:21,470
It's not just one statement.

4588
01:57:21,471 --> 01:57:21,640
Right.

4589
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:23,930
But people said it's out
bill one thing and that's,

4590
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:25,790
they put things in like this.

4591
01:57:25,791 --> 01:57:26,180
Yeah.

4592
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:26,860
That

4593
01:57:26,860 --> 01:57:31,210
make it easier for certain businesses
or make it easier for certain special

4594
01:57:31,211 --> 01:57:32,170
interest groups that,

4595
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:33,033
you know,

4596
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:36,010
it's like we'll give you this
but you got to give us that.

4597
01:57:36,040 --> 01:57:37,040
So I don't know what the,

4598
01:57:37,041 --> 01:57:37,450
the,

4599
01:57:37,450 --> 01:57:41,920
the positive benefit of this job Zack
is we've got to find a lot according to

4600
01:57:41,970 --> 01:57:42,880
um,

4601
01:57:44,020 --> 01:57:44,810
Matt Taibbi,

4602
01:57:44,810 --> 01:57:46,300
it's really crazy.

4603
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:47,450
It's really strange.

4604
01:57:47,610 --> 01:57:51,610
He equates it and he says
it's like formerly eliminating
steroid testing for the

4605
01:57:51,611 --> 01:57:53,680
first five years of a
baseball player's career.

4606
01:57:53,890 --> 01:57:56,380
You can pretty much bet you're going to
see a lot of home runs and those first

4607
01:57:56,381 --> 01:57:58,180
few years after you
institute a rule like that,

4608
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:03,070
but you better be ready to stick a lot
of asterisks in the record books 10 or 15

4609
01:58:03,071 --> 01:58:03,904
years down the line,

4610
01:58:04,030 --> 01:58:06,850
which is a great analogy
to what if this is correct,

4611
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:10,030
if you really don't have to
have the proper accounting to,

4612
01:58:10,230 --> 01:58:12,580
to go for a company to go
public for the first five years,

4613
01:58:12,581 --> 01:58:13,414
that's like,

4614
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:14,950
this is craziness.

4615
01:58:15,190 --> 01:58:20,050
It's like they keep passing more and more
laws and they keep doing more and more

4616
01:58:20,051 --> 01:58:22,780
things to control people and to make it,

4617
01:58:22,810 --> 01:58:25,990
to limit our ability to defend
ourselves against the government.

4618
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:29,830
And they keep doing more and more things
that allow people to somehow or another

4619
01:58:29,831 --> 01:58:31,450
siphoned money out of the system.

4620
01:58:31,810 --> 01:58:36,580
And you gotta wonder where does this
end when they stop making new bills and

4621
01:58:36,581 --> 01:58:41,581
start trying to fix this fucking
ridiculous government we have.

4622
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:41,801
Well,

4623
01:58:41,801 --> 01:58:42,550
the foreclosure

4624
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:42,911
bill,

4625
01:58:42,911 --> 01:58:44,290
what we were just talking
about with the fork,

4626
01:58:44,390 --> 01:58:45,890
the hell those houses foreclosing him.

4627
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:47,320
Obama just pass that,

4628
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:48,340
that bill.

4629
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:49,840
What is that a month ago?

4630
01:58:49,980 --> 01:58:50,540
Was it though?

4631
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:51,220
Um,

4632
01:58:51,220 --> 01:58:51,910
it's a good,

4633
01:58:51,910 --> 01:58:52,361
yeah,

4634
01:58:52,361 --> 01:58:53,410
I thought it was pretty good.

4635
01:58:53,411 --> 01:58:54,160
It sounded pretty good.

4636
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:54,730
What does it do?

4637
01:58:54,730 --> 01:58:55,391
It just like,

4638
01:58:55,391 --> 01:58:55,970
uh,

4639
01:58:55,970 --> 01:58:56,803
it,

4640
01:58:56,830 --> 01:58:57,100
it,

4641
01:58:57,100 --> 01:58:57,933
um,

4642
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,410
there were a bunch of
different facets of it,

4643
01:58:59,411 --> 01:59:02,380
but one of it was like your
house can be foreclosed on,

4644
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:03,303
um,

4645
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:04,300
in the first three years.

4646
01:59:04,301 --> 01:59:06,040
Like if you served in the military,

4647
01:59:06,041 --> 01:59:06,890
like just things that you,

4648
01:59:06,891 --> 01:59:07,361
you were like,

4649
01:59:07,361 --> 01:59:08,650
this wasn't already a rule,

4650
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:09,010
right?

4651
01:59:09,010 --> 01:59:09,730
Um,

4652
01:59:09,730 --> 01:59:10,121
yeah,

4653
01:59:10,121 --> 01:59:13,090
just like helping out the uh,

4654
01:59:13,540 --> 01:59:15,280
mental health when people get a chance.

4655
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:15,690
Yeah,

4656
01:59:15,690 --> 01:59:16,021
totally.

4657
01:59:16,021 --> 01:59:16,270
Get,

4658
01:59:16,270 --> 01:59:17,320
try and get their house back.

4659
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:18,570
I'm pro that.

4660
01:59:18,630 --> 01:59:18,970
Yeah.

4661
01:59:18,970 --> 01:59:19,870
This is terrible.

4662
01:59:19,871 --> 01:59:20,890
I need to know more about this.

4663
01:59:20,950 --> 01:59:22,270
I need to know more about this too,

4664
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:23,440
but I'm what I'm reading right now,

4665
01:59:23,441 --> 01:59:24,550
it's fucking terrifying.

4666
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:25,511
I just,

4667
01:59:25,511 --> 01:59:25,731
I,

4668
01:59:25,731 --> 01:59:29,470
I see all these things like the national
defense authorization act and all these

4669
01:59:29,471 --> 01:59:33,550
different rules that all are going to
allow them to have fucking drones in the

4670
01:59:33,551 --> 01:59:35,140
sky in the next 20 years.

4671
01:59:35,141 --> 01:59:37,780
Going to be 30,000 drones
flying through the sky.

4672
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:42,900
What's a drone flying machines that can
take video and send back realtime data

4673
01:59:45,161 --> 01:59:47,920
and work on a four g
connection or by that time,

4674
01:59:47,970 --> 01:59:48,220
you know,

4675
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:49,540
seven or eight g whatever the fuck.

4676
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:51,400
So much information in here.

4677
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:52,840
I think ignorance is bliss.

4678
01:59:52,841 --> 01:59:53,950
I'm going to keep on being retired.

4679
01:59:53,990 --> 01:59:54,800
It's probably a good mood.

4680
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:55,220
I agree.

4681
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:57,200
You got to find that dude
that doesn't have a job.

4682
01:59:57,260 --> 01:59:58,093
Who lucks

4683
01:59:58,740 --> 02:00:02,850
cool without a dude right now you guys
think I just go home and I'm just like,

4684
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:03,980
oh man

4685
02:00:03,980 --> 02:00:06,570
would have taken care of you with some
good deck and you wouldn't have had that

4686
02:00:06,571 --> 02:00:07,404
food poisoning.

4687
02:00:07,470 --> 02:00:08,303
You think straighten.

4688
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:08,730
Yeah.

4689
02:00:08,730 --> 02:00:09,310
Yeah.

4690
02:00:09,310 --> 02:00:10,030
Throw up once.

4691
02:00:10,030 --> 02:00:11,130
Get it all out of your system.

4692
02:00:12,050 --> 02:00:12,811
He pumps you fall.

4693
02:00:12,811 --> 02:00:14,450
Some hot lead's sweet,

4694
02:00:14,550 --> 02:00:15,960
energizes your back up.

4695
02:00:16,170 --> 02:00:18,630
Can you imagine if blokes
actually energized you?

4696
02:00:18,840 --> 02:00:22,270
If like when we would be mad if he didn't
fuck them because fight with a dude

4697
02:00:22,290 --> 02:00:22,740
again.

4698
02:00:22,740 --> 02:00:22,921
Yeah,

4699
02:00:22,921 --> 02:00:24,960
because that's the way you got God by.

4700
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:27,120
Could you imagine if we
needed each other that way?

4701
02:00:27,210 --> 02:00:28,080
Like we were like,

4702
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:28,470
well,

4703
02:00:28,470 --> 02:00:28,721
you know,

4704
02:00:28,721 --> 02:00:30,360
like we'll give you hit the brakes on us.

4705
02:00:30,420 --> 02:00:31,680
One of those electric cars,

4706
02:00:31,860 --> 02:00:33,360
it actually recharges the battery.

4707
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:35,520
Could you imagine if that's
the way humans recharge?

4708
02:00:35,521 --> 02:00:36,250
We gotta fuck.

4709
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:38,860
Like procreating is not
enough for a six day together.

4710
02:00:38,861 --> 02:00:39,694
It's gotta be right.

4711
02:00:39,770 --> 02:00:40,603
More appealing.

4712
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:43,160
What if we start evolving
like that and that direction?

4713
02:00:43,161 --> 02:00:43,341
You know,

4714
02:00:43,341 --> 02:00:45,710
they say that people
need physical attention.

4715
02:00:45,711 --> 02:00:46,544
You need,

4716
02:00:46,580 --> 02:00:48,740
you absolutely need
affection from other people.

4717
02:00:48,741 --> 02:00:51,170
It's like we did our bodies like needed.

4718
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:53,750
It desires it on a core level.

4719
02:00:53,930 --> 02:00:56,150
What if it turns into not just that,

4720
02:00:56,300 --> 02:01:00,080
but you actually need to fuck and then
if you don't fuck your body just rots

4721
02:01:00,081 --> 02:01:03,650
away and dies and the only way to keep
moving as if you have to have to fuck.

4722
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:04,350
You have to fucking,

4723
02:01:04,350 --> 02:01:05,200
they're gay.

4724
02:01:05,300 --> 02:01:06,140
So you'd be mad.

4725
02:01:06,730 --> 02:01:07,880
[inaudible] I dunno.

4726
02:01:07,881 --> 02:01:08,700
With Gay Jazz,

4727
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:12,920
probably like engineer do some genetic
engineering on their loads so that they

4728
02:01:12,921 --> 02:01:15,170
figured out how a guy can
absorb it through his ass.

4729
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:16,221
We'd have to time it.

4730
02:01:16,221 --> 02:01:16,461
Right?

4731
02:01:16,461 --> 02:01:17,630
Like what if we go ahead and take a shit?

4732
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:19,640
A Chevy shits out,

4733
02:01:19,641 --> 02:01:21,800
all the good sperm and
then you don't evolve.

4734
02:01:22,330 --> 02:01:23,720
You got the timing on that.

4735
02:01:25,310 --> 02:01:25,940
Seriously.

4736
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:28,310
It's not preposterous to
think that we would need each.

4737
02:01:28,311 --> 02:01:29,420
I mean we need each other.

4738
02:01:29,450 --> 02:01:30,020
I mean we get it.

4739
02:01:30,020 --> 02:01:31,490
You know how you get addicted to sex,

4740
02:01:31,491 --> 02:01:31,761
right?

4741
02:01:31,761 --> 02:01:32,630
If you're in a relationship,

4742
02:01:32,631 --> 02:01:33,680
when you first started having sex,

4743
02:01:34,030 --> 02:01:35,060
especially right in the beginning,

4744
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:37,340
don't you feel like it
mixed all you think about.

4745
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:38,001
Exactly.

4746
02:01:38,001 --> 02:01:38,491
You start thinking,

4747
02:01:38,491 --> 02:01:39,050
why don't we not?

4748
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:39,980
When you can't wait to

4749
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:41,210
get together with each other.

4750
02:01:41,211 --> 02:01:41,540
Yeah.

4751
02:01:41,540 --> 02:01:42,710
It's like a total drug.

4752
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:43,101
Yeah,

4753
02:01:43,101 --> 02:01:44,000
it is like a turtle drug.

4754
02:01:44,150 --> 02:01:48,650
But that's one of the reasons why people
are so angry when people leave them.

4755
02:01:48,651 --> 02:01:50,240
It's like you're taking my drug away,

4756
02:01:50,660 --> 02:01:51,560
taking my thing away.

4757
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:52,603
Right.

4758
02:01:52,760 --> 02:01:55,100
What if it was even
more intense than that?

4759
02:01:55,101 --> 02:01:59,900
And it literally got to a point where
your body would register very obvious

4760
02:01:59,901 --> 02:02:04,700
changes whether or not you had a sperm
inside your body withdrawal and whether a

4761
02:02:04,701 --> 02:02:05,690
guy got rid of it,

4762
02:02:05,870 --> 02:02:07,760
the guy has to get rid of it
and it doesn't get rid of it.

4763
02:02:07,761 --> 02:02:08,560
Like he's,

4764
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:09,800
it's burning him up,

4765
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:10,873
you know,

4766
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:13,050
not much different than reality.

4767
02:02:13,260 --> 02:02:16,890
I would rather die than have sex with
anybody I've ever had sex with him ever in

4768
02:02:16,891 --> 02:02:17,520
the past.

4769
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:18,540
Is there a one guy when you look

4770
02:02:18,590 --> 02:02:19,423
back and go,

4771
02:02:19,730 --> 02:02:20,900
that one could have worked out better?

4772
02:02:20,901 --> 02:02:23,630
Maybe I just fucking shut a one
for that finger in the ass thing.

4773
02:02:24,200 --> 02:02:25,033
Did what he asked?

4774
02:02:25,130 --> 02:02:25,461
No,

4775
02:02:25,461 --> 02:02:25,651
I,

4776
02:02:25,651 --> 02:02:27,830
I've always gone for
the finger in the ass.

4777
02:02:28,310 --> 02:02:28,670
Um,

4778
02:02:28,670 --> 02:02:29,390
but no.

4779
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:29,661
Yeah,

4780
02:02:29,661 --> 02:02:30,494
no.

4781
02:02:30,850 --> 02:02:32,590
I ask you to do something
creepy and you were like,

4782
02:02:32,591 --> 02:02:34,100
that swear I gotta go.

4783
02:02:34,650 --> 02:02:35,330
I don't know.

4784
02:02:35,330 --> 02:02:38,870
I think I've ever had anybody asked me
something that was too creepy that I said

4785
02:02:39,020 --> 02:02:39,630
no,

4786
02:02:39,630 --> 02:02:41,310
a girl told me to fuck her client once.

4787
02:02:42,240 --> 02:02:42,601
I was like,

4788
02:02:42,601 --> 02:02:43,434
whoa.

4789
02:02:43,860 --> 02:02:44,521
It was just like,

4790
02:02:44,521 --> 02:02:45,354
Whoa,

4791
02:02:45,570 --> 02:02:46,403
what did it mean you?

4792
02:02:47,480 --> 02:02:48,420
Is that what you call it?

4793
02:02:48,510 --> 02:02:49,590
Just isn't that what it is?

4794
02:02:49,591 --> 02:02:50,310
I'm like,

4795
02:02:50,310 --> 02:02:50,880
Oh,

4796
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:51,330
I mean

4797
02:02:51,330 --> 02:02:53,020
we change your terminology a little bit.

4798
02:02:53,021 --> 02:02:53,441
Seeing the,

4799
02:02:53,441 --> 02:02:53,771
I just,

4800
02:02:53,771 --> 02:02:54,650
I talked about this on,

4801
02:02:54,680 --> 02:02:57,030
I'm on o and a uh,

4802
02:02:57,070 --> 02:03:01,420
but I was like dirty texting
with a guy and he like,

4803
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:03,130
and I wrote something like,

4804
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:03,993
um,

4805
02:03:04,780 --> 02:03:05,371
like I,

4806
02:03:05,371 --> 02:03:07,500
I was going to send on his
face or something and like,

4807
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:08,353
uh,

4808
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:09,340
right.

4809
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:10,173
And uh,

4810
02:03:10,210 --> 02:03:11,980
and he wrote back like,

4811
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:13,493
all right,

4812
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:15,730
but like oral is going to go both ways.

4813
02:03:16,120 --> 02:03:16,931
And I was just like,

4814
02:03:16,931 --> 02:03:21,420
what is this a negotiation
like Douche Bro.

4815
02:03:21,730 --> 02:03:22,151
I think,

4816
02:03:22,151 --> 02:03:25,470
I think when it comes to like
talking shit in the bedroom you like,

4817
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:27,130
it's got to kind of be,

4818
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:30,820
anything goes in unless
it's complete insanity.

4819
02:03:30,821 --> 02:03:34,840
But I like if a guy's ever
mentioned something I've
said while having sex after,

4820
02:03:35,110 --> 02:03:35,943
I'm like,

4821
02:03:36,040 --> 02:03:37,420
are you fucking crazy?

4822
02:03:37,421 --> 02:03:41,710
Like not talk about that is a secret.

4823
02:03:41,740 --> 02:03:45,010
That was a circle of
trust that you are like,

4824
02:03:45,011 --> 02:03:46,000
I would never be like,

4825
02:03:46,001 --> 02:03:46,271
wow,

4826
02:03:46,271 --> 02:03:49,030
at dinner after you fuck
someone you talk shit.

4827
02:03:49,031 --> 02:03:49,690
You're like,

4828
02:03:49,690 --> 02:03:52,770
so I'm calling me a whore nonstop.

4829
02:03:53,310 --> 02:03:54,730
Like you gotta just,

4830
02:03:54,820 --> 02:03:56,410
you gotta just keep it,

4831
02:03:56,620 --> 02:03:57,610
keep it in there.

4832
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,140
If something makes you uncomfortable,

4833
02:03:59,141 --> 02:03:59,651
you have to be like,

4834
02:03:59,651 --> 02:04:00,484
that's not cool.

4835
02:04:00,490 --> 02:04:00,820
Don't,

4836
02:04:00,820 --> 02:04:02,040
don't call me your sister.

4837
02:04:02,210 --> 02:04:02,391
Yeah.

4838
02:04:02,391 --> 02:04:03,750
What do you do if something
like that happens?

4839
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:04,521
You pull them aside,

4840
02:04:04,521 --> 02:04:05,980
like when you're having dinner or do like,

4841
02:04:05,981 --> 02:04:06,111
oh,

4842
02:04:06,111 --> 02:04:07,220
can I talk to you for a second?

4843
02:04:07,800 --> 02:04:08,060
Uh,

4844
02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:08,350
do you,

4845
02:04:08,350 --> 02:04:08,900
uh,

4846
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:10,940
how do you write that ship?

4847
02:04:11,590 --> 02:04:12,370
Um,

4848
02:04:12,370 --> 02:04:12,620
uh,

4849
02:04:12,620 --> 02:04:13,780
I've just broken up with them.

4850
02:04:14,350 --> 02:04:15,183
It's work.

4851
02:04:15,190 --> 02:04:15,680
I had one guy,

4852
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:17,860
the sex got too weird in what way?

4853
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:18,820
We needed to watch.

4854
02:04:19,080 --> 02:04:20,150
He like,

4855
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:22,090
he needed to watch me watch me

4856
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:23,083
porn.

4857
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:25,310
And at first it was like,

4858
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:25,860
okay,

4859
02:04:25,860 --> 02:04:26,480
pretty high.

4860
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:26,751
It was,

4861
02:04:26,751 --> 02:04:28,580
it was fun at first and then it was like,

4862
02:04:28,610 --> 02:04:29,510
that's all he wanted to do.

4863
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:31,640
He wanted to catch me watching porn,

4864
02:04:32,030 --> 02:04:37,030
Ooh and Aah and then have sex while
I watched porn and like it was fun.

4865
02:04:37,590 --> 02:04:38,050
It is kind

4866
02:04:38,050 --> 02:04:38,730
of hard,

4867
02:04:38,730 --> 02:04:39,810
but I don't like the catching you.

4868
02:04:39,811 --> 02:04:40,410
I just want you to,

4869
02:04:40,410 --> 02:04:44,340
what if it's like creepy porn was poor
with girls who tits are just way too big

4870
02:04:44,341 --> 02:04:46,290
and they stretch out and you see the bag.

4871
02:04:46,291 --> 02:04:47,940
Every time they went to him with his dad,

4872
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:50,220
it was like pretty,

4873
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:52,490
pretty normal run of the mill.

4874
02:04:53,520 --> 02:04:55,920
It's hard doing regular normal porn.

4875
02:04:55,950 --> 02:04:59,550
Everybody wants to throw up and
gagged spitting and assholes.

4876
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:02,310
It's hard finding regular porn these days.

4877
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:02,730
Oh,

4878
02:05:02,730 --> 02:05:04,090
it's easy to Harley.

4879
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:07,110
I see a lot of gagging because a lot of

4880
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:09,750
what?

4881
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:12,570
When did that become
the fucking normal move

4882
02:05:15,050 --> 02:05:18,120
and have the girls isn't even on it.

4883
02:05:18,150 --> 02:05:18,661
They're not even,

4884
02:05:18,661 --> 02:05:21,540
they can't really close it mouth cause
the guy's kind of fucking the back of

4885
02:05:21,541 --> 02:05:22,374
their throat.

4886
02:05:25,190 --> 02:05:26,240
Spoiler alert,

4887
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:27,720
she's going to get a load on her face.

4888
02:05:29,510 --> 02:05:30,343
This one,

4889
02:05:30,380 --> 02:05:31,330
they're all the same.

4890
02:05:31,380 --> 02:05:33,810
Well sometimes they do
what they call cream pies.

4891
02:05:33,811 --> 02:05:34,830
That's very popular now.

4892
02:05:34,831 --> 02:05:35,221
What does that,

4893
02:05:35,221 --> 02:05:39,980
that's like when they showed it inside
the pussy orgasms in the girl's pussy and

4894
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:41,360
it just works it out.

4895
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:47,100
And there's anal cream pies and pies.

4896
02:05:47,730 --> 02:05:49,500
Yeah there's oral cream pies.

4897
02:05:53,080 --> 02:05:57,570
Got To be a strong man to
date one of those girls.

4898
02:05:57,650 --> 02:06:00,180
Like I never watched the end of a porn.

4899
02:06:00,430 --> 02:06:05,430
Yeah I never get to know I need the do
you watch porn by yourself or you always

4900
02:06:05,551 --> 02:06:09,990
would really do watch porn cause you're
excited by it cause a lot of girls are

4901
02:06:09,991 --> 02:06:10,824
not.

4902
02:06:11,070 --> 02:06:11,903
You are

4903
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:17,470
still figuring myself out a little bit.

4904
02:06:19,010 --> 02:06:21,910
Porn when I was younger I was like I,

4905
02:06:22,180 --> 02:06:27,150
I was living with a boyfriend and like
he would watch porn and I was like see

4906
02:06:27,180 --> 02:06:29,820
that he had like left on the computer
and I would be like that's like cheating

4907
02:06:29,821 --> 02:06:34,530
on me and I was young and dumb and a
and then this poor guy cause now I like

4908
02:06:34,531 --> 02:06:35,364
love porn.

4909
02:06:38,550 --> 02:06:40,710
Have you ever thought about
doing like the AVN awards?

4910
02:06:40,711 --> 02:06:42,080
Like hosting that?

4911
02:06:43,130 --> 02:06:47,910
I was supposed to host this like escort
awards this year for like hookers.

4912
02:06:47,970 --> 02:06:48,803
Yeah

4913
02:06:50,350 --> 02:06:51,183
guys.

4914
02:06:51,710 --> 02:06:54,840
But they have an award show was in New
York and I supposed to host escorts.

4915
02:06:55,980 --> 02:06:57,090
I must be gay.

4916
02:06:58,590 --> 02:07:00,560
Right before they set up.

4917
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:03,240
I think they saw my standup and fired me.

4918
02:07:04,410 --> 02:07:05,243
I don't know what it was.

4919
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:06,230
I don't know they but they,

4920
02:07:06,231 --> 02:07:06,830
uh,

4921
02:07:06,830 --> 02:07:07,380
they were like,

4922
02:07:07,380 --> 02:07:07,511
oh,

4923
02:07:07,511 --> 02:07:09,240
we decided not to have a comic or will,

4924
02:07:09,241 --> 02:07:10,190
they probably saw it.

4925
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:13,290
They probably saw you and thought this
bitch is going to talk about those.

4926
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:15,150
And then there was 10 minutes in her act.

4927
02:07:15,190 --> 02:07:16,680
You would for sure though.

4928
02:07:17,140 --> 02:07:17,610
I would have,

4929
02:07:17,610 --> 02:07:18,510
I was so excited.

4930
02:07:18,511 --> 02:07:19,410
The money wasn't a great,

4931
02:07:19,411 --> 02:07:19,711
I was like,

4932
02:07:19,711 --> 02:07:20,130
oh,

4933
02:07:20,130 --> 02:07:21,120
of course I'll do it.

4934
02:07:21,640 --> 02:07:24,990
I think they tried to insult
me with how low the offer was.

4935
02:07:24,990 --> 02:07:25,261
I was like,

4936
02:07:25,261 --> 02:07:25,870
nice try.

4937
02:07:25,870 --> 02:07:27,190
I'm like,

4938
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:30,390
I'm going to be there doing it or no,

4939
02:07:30,450 --> 02:07:30,740
no.

4940
02:07:30,740 --> 02:07:33,690
They said they didn't want to come
back kind of at the last minute.

4941
02:07:34,290 --> 02:07:36,360
They're probably scared of it's high,

4942
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:37,630
but I would have this,

4943
02:07:37,631 --> 02:07:39,190
is this before or after the roast?

4944
02:07:39,430 --> 02:07:39,910
After.

4945
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:40,330
Oh yeah.

4946
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:40,481
Yeah.

4947
02:07:40,481 --> 02:07:41,440
This is just supposed to be,

4948
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:42,910
they probably just didn't
sell enough tickets.

4949
02:07:42,911 --> 02:07:43,330
Awesome.

4950
02:07:43,330 --> 02:07:43,451
Oh,

4951
02:07:43,451 --> 02:07:43,931
I doubt it.

4952
02:07:43,931 --> 02:07:44,371
No doubt.

4953
02:07:44,371 --> 02:07:47,300
Have annual events freaks and they,

4954
02:07:47,301 --> 02:07:47,801
they'd probably,

4955
02:07:47,801 --> 02:07:48,251
someone said,

4956
02:07:48,251 --> 02:07:50,170
do you realize that you're
opening up the gates of hell?

4957
02:07:50,680 --> 02:07:54,760
Do you realize that by exposing our award
show to this comedian who gets to go

4958
02:07:54,761 --> 02:07:57,470
on national television and talk about us?

4959
02:07:57,471 --> 02:07:57,650
Yeah,

4960
02:07:57,650 --> 02:07:59,200
there must be a lot of confidentiality.

4961
02:07:59,201 --> 02:08:00,960
Was Paul Lynde sort of angry gay guy?

4962
02:08:00,970 --> 02:08:02,440
Just I um,

4963
02:08:02,530 --> 02:08:03,041
I don't know.

4964
02:08:03,041 --> 02:08:05,770
Like I like that whole industry
cause I really don't judge us.

4965
02:08:05,771 --> 02:08:06,020
Mail,

4966
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:06,853
hip or industry,

4967
02:08:07,020 --> 02:08:09,220
just like sex industry and strippers,

4968
02:08:09,221 --> 02:08:10,510
like a male hooker industries.

4969
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:12,910
The dots are dark wing of that world.

4970
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:17,170
I wonder what do you remember like when
there's a guy who got caught who was a

4971
02:08:17,171 --> 02:08:22,170
White House press correspondent or White
House press reporter who got caught,

4972
02:08:22,171 --> 02:08:23,004
what you got caught?

4973
02:08:23,010 --> 02:08:25,300
It turned out that he was
running a gay porn site.

4974
02:08:25,510 --> 02:08:25,601
Uh,

4975
02:08:25,601 --> 02:08:25,931
gay,

4976
02:08:25,931 --> 02:08:26,110
uh,

4977
02:08:26,110 --> 02:08:26,471
excuse me,

4978
02:08:26,471 --> 02:08:27,340
gay escort site,

4979
02:08:27,610 --> 02:08:28,421
like military,

4980
02:08:28,421 --> 02:08:28,781
a game,

4981
02:08:28,781 --> 02:08:29,770
military escort site.

4982
02:08:29,790 --> 02:08:30,623
I remember that.

4983
02:08:30,980 --> 02:08:31,691
His name was,

4984
02:08:31,691 --> 02:08:33,310
I believe his name is Jeff Gannon.

4985
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:34,181
And he would,

4986
02:08:34,181 --> 02:08:34,540
uh,

4987
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:39,540
he would lob these really s like underhand
slow pitch statement questions to the

4988
02:08:41,441 --> 02:08:41,861
president,

4989
02:08:41,861 --> 02:08:42,940
depression of Bush at the time.

4990
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:44,470
Mr. Bush,

4991
02:08:44,650 --> 02:08:45,483
Mr President,

4992
02:08:45,610 --> 02:08:48,730
when are the Democrats going
to get their head out of that

4993
02:08:48,770 --> 02:08:49,603
sand?

4994
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:53,670
Realize any that like literally he
was a reporter and people would go,

4995
02:08:53,890 --> 02:08:57,650
fuck is Bush wanted him in there every
time he would get it was his go to guy of

4996
02:08:57,651 --> 02:08:58,170
course.

4997
02:08:58,170 --> 02:08:58,830
And he is,

4998
02:08:58,830 --> 02:09:00,810
he actually stayed at the White House.

4999
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:05,840
This guy had slept over at the White
House and he turned out he had some gay

5000
02:09:06,691 --> 02:09:11,691
military escort website where it was
him lying there naked with like a,

5001
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:16,170
like a towel over his
deck wearing a dog tag.

5002
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:17,250
I am,

5003
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:18,233
yeah.

5004
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:23,000
It's all just about sucking Dick as
a soldier and taking in the military.

5005
02:09:23,390 --> 02:09:25,320
He said depressing and flow.

5006
02:09:25,321 --> 02:09:30,321
But this guy didn't him and they don't
know what the fuck that was all about.

5007
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:32,011
Who was,

5008
02:09:32,011 --> 02:09:32,670
who was the,

5009
02:09:32,670 --> 02:09:33,030
you know,

5010
02:09:33,030 --> 02:09:34,380
was it Ken Starr mean?

5011
02:09:34,381 --> 02:09:35,130
Who Was it?

5012
02:09:35,130 --> 02:09:35,310
Um,

5013
02:09:35,310 --> 02:09:36,143
which one of those,

5014
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:37,230
those guys?

5015
02:09:37,231 --> 02:09:37,701
It was the,

5016
02:09:37,701 --> 02:09:38,311
the gay guy.

5017
02:09:38,311 --> 02:09:39,420
There was another guy that's the,

5018
02:09:39,421 --> 02:09:39,570
uh,

5019
02:09:39,570 --> 02:09:42,660
the guy who was the mastermind
for bushes campaign.

5020
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:43,110
I,

5021
02:09:43,110 --> 02:09:43,943
what the fuck is his name?

5022
02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:44,873
The man behind.

5023
02:09:46,210 --> 02:09:47,710
I just wanted to j Edgar and that,

5024
02:09:47,740 --> 02:09:49,460
that gate hot,

5025
02:09:49,810 --> 02:09:50,361
that movie.

5026
02:09:50,361 --> 02:09:51,250
It was boom.

5027
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:51,900
It was,

5028
02:09:51,900 --> 02:09:52,421
it was boring.

5029
02:09:52,421 --> 02:09:53,320
But I liked like,

5030
02:09:53,370 --> 02:09:53,740
uh,

5031
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:53,981
I,

5032
02:09:53,981 --> 02:09:54,580
I've,

5033
02:09:54,580 --> 02:09:57,070
I don't get turned on by gay
dudes having sex with each other,

5034
02:09:57,071 --> 02:09:59,080
but I would have liked to have
seen them have sex with each other.

5035
02:09:59,650 --> 02:10:00,880
You would have liked to
have seen those guys.

5036
02:10:00,881 --> 02:10:03,210
I would love to see
Leo and an Army Hammer.

5037
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:04,120
You serious?

5038
02:10:04,210 --> 02:10:05,043
Please?

5039
02:10:05,170 --> 02:10:06,580
I don't care who's bending who over.

5040
02:10:06,581 --> 02:10:07,330
I'm watching.

5041
02:10:07,330 --> 02:10:08,410
Are you going to do a town Wednesday?

5042
02:10:08,890 --> 02:10:09,723
Yeah.

5043
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:11,950
Do you want to do the comedy
show here at the Ice House?

5044
02:10:13,030 --> 02:10:14,320
Do I have to drive here again?

5045
02:10:14,530 --> 02:10:14,680
No,

5046
02:10:14,680 --> 02:10:15,400
just kidding.

5047
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:15,820
Um,

5048
02:10:15,820 --> 02:10:16,330
yeah.

5049
02:10:16,330 --> 02:10:16,870
Can I,

5050
02:10:16,870 --> 02:10:17,580
yeah,

5051
02:10:17,580 --> 02:10:18,010
sure.

5052
02:10:18,010 --> 02:10:18,843
Nine o'clock.

5053
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:19,630
Okay.

5054
02:10:19,630 --> 02:10:20,470
Karl Rove.

5055
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:22,000
Oh yeah.

5056
02:10:22,001 --> 02:10:24,790
What was really Super Gay and he,

5057
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:25,070
uh,

5058
02:10:25,070 --> 02:10:25,903
hell no chicks.

5059
02:10:26,050 --> 02:10:27,370
I'm just making this up by the way.

5060
02:10:27,371 --> 02:10:27,790
Karl.

5061
02:10:27,790 --> 02:10:28,630
I could be totally wrong.

5062
02:10:28,631 --> 02:10:29,464
Please don't send me,

5063
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:30,630
Carlos loves this pocket.

5064
02:10:30,850 --> 02:10:32,680
I don't know who the
fuck it was that was gay.

5065
02:10:32,860 --> 02:10:33,620
Let's just say that.

5066
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:34,040
I have no

5067
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:34,251
idea.

5068
02:10:34,251 --> 02:10:35,690
I'm just totally guessing out of my ass.

5069
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:37,040
But whoever it was,

5070
02:10:37,041 --> 02:10:38,270
somebody knew this guy.

5071
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:41,820
And somebody got this Guy Gig there
and that guy turned out to be a

5072
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:47,350
madam and it was deep in
the White House in there.

5073
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:47,780
And Yeah,

5074
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:49,790
I guess people back then just thought,

5075
02:10:49,791 --> 02:10:50,031
wow,

5076
02:10:50,031 --> 02:10:51,020
the internet so big,

5077
02:10:51,021 --> 02:10:51,920
who's going to find this?

5078
02:10:52,430 --> 02:10:54,590
They didn't understand
the search search engines.

5079
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:55,873
Yeah.

5080
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:56,660
Shit.

5081
02:10:56,660 --> 02:10:57,630
That'll catch up to you.

5082
02:10:57,650 --> 02:10:58,401
You're in the White House.

5083
02:10:58,401 --> 02:11:02,330
I guess they all managing thinking
that you just get to pull that off.

5084
02:11:02,540 --> 02:11:02,960
Like,

5085
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:03,640
you know,

5086
02:11:03,640 --> 02:11:03,810
gay,

5087
02:11:03,810 --> 02:11:04,730
I score,

5088
02:11:04,790 --> 02:11:05,990
stay at the White House.

5089
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:07,700
No one's going to know
how they gonna know.

5090
02:11:07,940 --> 02:11:08,751
Fuck Dude,

5091
02:11:08,751 --> 02:11:09,584
I know that guy.

5092
02:11:09,690 --> 02:11:10,140
Oh Man.

5093
02:11:10,140 --> 02:11:12,680
I think about the things they
pulled off before the Internet.

5094
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:13,290
Oh yeah.

5095
02:11:13,290 --> 02:11:14,123
Oh my.

5096
02:11:14,130 --> 02:11:15,600
Well they say that Nixon was gay.

5097
02:11:15,601 --> 02:11:17,780
A guy just wrote a book
about Nixon being gay.

5098
02:11:17,781 --> 02:11:18,000
Every,

5099
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:23,000
there's a photo of him with this smaller
Hispanic man who was with a small dog,

5100
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:24,561
you know,

5101
02:11:24,561 --> 02:11:25,394
which by the way,

5102
02:11:25,550 --> 02:11:26,383
you know,

5103
02:11:26,610 --> 02:11:27,500
you have a small dog,

5104
02:11:27,501 --> 02:11:29,870
you either bad motherfucker
or you might be gay.

5105
02:11:29,871 --> 02:11:30,081
I mean,

5106
02:11:30,081 --> 02:11:32,600
back then in those days
you do the tiny dog.

5107
02:11:32,620 --> 02:11:33,490
That's tough too.

5108
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:34,071
Maybe.

5109
02:11:34,071 --> 02:11:35,210
Or maybe you know,

5110
02:11:35,211 --> 02:11:36,110
maybe he's a bad motherfucker.

5111
02:11:36,190 --> 02:11:37,160
Like my friend mayhem,

5112
02:11:37,220 --> 02:11:38,120
his MMA fighter,

5113
02:11:38,121 --> 02:11:40,620
he's got a a Datsun hotdog,

5114
02:11:40,810 --> 02:11:43,580
chocolate Dell when he was the
UFC light heavyweight champion.

5115
02:11:43,590 --> 02:11:44,600
He always had this little Chihuahua.

5116
02:11:44,601 --> 02:11:45,434
He took everywhere,

5117
02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:46,820
but he was such a bad motherfucker.

5118
02:11:46,821 --> 02:11:48,080
He could totally pull off.

5119
02:11:48,081 --> 02:11:48,501
Really?

5120
02:11:48,501 --> 02:11:52,880
That was also a lot of gay guys
walking around with a dog in a purse.

5121
02:11:53,030 --> 02:11:54,260
I lost mine in a divorce.

5122
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:54,781
Oh,

5123
02:11:54,781 --> 02:11:55,614
I'm sorry.

5124
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:56,600
I mean I got mine.

5125
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:58,090
I don't like the people in la are like,

5126
02:11:58,091 --> 02:11:58,910
he's beautiful dogs.

5127
02:11:58,910 --> 02:12:01,360
You could just see that they're just
using them as like an accessory.

5128
02:12:02,890 --> 02:12:04,790
That dog is supposed to represent them.

5129
02:12:04,850 --> 02:12:05,750
They liked the way it looks.

5130
02:12:05,751 --> 02:12:07,670
And a woman with a dog is not alone.

5131
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:09,530
She's busy and with my dog.

5132
02:12:09,531 --> 02:12:10,251
Come on honey.

5133
02:12:10,251 --> 02:12:11,180
We gotta go.

5134
02:12:11,181 --> 02:12:11,611
Sorry.

5135
02:12:11,611 --> 02:12:14,230
You think you were going always.

5136
02:12:14,270 --> 02:12:17,180
We just fucking be an adult.

5137
02:12:17,420 --> 02:12:18,680
Real woman with a dog is,

It's like she can we it
where she can get away.

5141
02:12:23,150 --> 02:12:23,601
Excuse me,

5142
02:12:23,601 --> 02:12:24,291
I'm busy.

5143
02:12:24,291 --> 02:12:27,080
I have to walk my dog got into
a relationship with someone.

5144
02:12:27,081 --> 02:12:27,291
You're like,

5145
02:12:27,291 --> 02:12:27,561
oh good.

5146
02:12:27,561 --> 02:12:28,430
She's distracted.

5147
02:12:28,431 --> 02:12:29,300
But up top.

5148
02:12:29,301 --> 02:12:30,830
That's got to be tapped into.

5149
02:12:30,831 --> 02:12:32,060
If like you've used tardies.

5150
02:12:32,061 --> 02:12:32,920
Boring ass conversation.

5151
02:12:32,921 --> 02:12:33,130
Yeah.

5152
02:12:33,130 --> 02:12:34,510
I just want you here.

5153
02:12:34,850 --> 02:12:35,690
Go play with your dog.

5154
02:12:35,710 --> 02:12:36,370
Yeah.

5155
02:12:36,370 --> 02:12:38,090
And then get ready to
be alone with the dog.

5156
02:12:38,740 --> 02:12:40,100
When I come around to slink deck.

5157
02:12:40,130 --> 02:12:41,930
Did you tell our con no.

5158
02:12:42,140 --> 02:12:44,930
Has anybody ever said to you be ready
when I come home and slink deck?

5159
02:12:45,710 --> 02:12:46,011
No.

5160
02:12:46,011 --> 02:12:46,791
That sounds good though.

5161
02:12:46,791 --> 02:12:48,150
I think I want to say that.

5162
02:12:48,240 --> 02:12:49,073
Really?

5163
02:12:50,740 --> 02:12:50,970
No.

5164
02:12:50,970 --> 02:12:52,210
Nobody right that to me on Twitter.

5165
02:12:53,410 --> 02:12:57,120
Of course I'm going to get
a hundred course sticks.

5166
02:12:57,570 --> 02:12:57,811
Yeah,

5167
02:12:57,811 --> 02:12:58,171
it's in,

5168
02:12:58,171 --> 02:12:59,010
it's inevitable now.

5169
02:12:59,040 --> 02:12:59,700
Yeah.

5170
02:12:59,700 --> 02:13:01,320
I'm coming home to slink
tech that's coming.

5171
02:13:01,350 --> 02:13:02,183
That's going to be,

5172
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:02,760
that's all.

5173
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:04,800
I'm going to be someone's new
signature on a message board.

5174
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:05,410
That's a cut.

5175
02:13:05,410 --> 02:13:05,891
That's what happened.

5176
02:13:05,891 --> 02:13:09,930
So like I'll forget that we said this
and then I'll be in Denver and some dude

5177
02:13:09,940 --> 02:13:11,080
will come up after the show and be like,

5178
02:13:11,081 --> 02:13:11,650

5179
02:13:11,650 --> 02:13:12,580
I'll sleep and I'll be like,

5180
02:13:12,581 --> 02:13:13,510
I'm calling the cops

5181
02:13:15,070 --> 02:13:15,903

5182
02:13:15,980 --> 02:13:16,150
What?

5183
02:13:16,150 --> 02:13:17,740
How does that really happens?

5184
02:13:17,741 --> 02:13:19,060
That seems like it would happen a lot.

5185
02:13:19,090 --> 02:13:20,080
That happens all the time.

5186
02:13:20,100 --> 02:13:20,350
Yeah.

5187
02:13:20,350 --> 02:13:20,860

how much crazy shit the last time.

5189
02:13:23,070 --> 02:13:25,290
Crazy people that tweet you
after you did the last one.

5190
02:13:25,950 --> 02:13:26,221
Yeah.

5191
02:13:26,221 --> 02:13:27,600
Mostly not crazy people.

5192
02:13:27,601 --> 02:13:28,860
Nice people were really nice.

5193
02:13:28,861 --> 02:13:29,131
Yeah.

5194
02:13:29,131 --> 02:13:29,551

I mean,

5234
02:14:00,820 --> 02:14:03,340

fan of a particular team,

5235
02:14:03,341 --> 02:14:03,521
you know,

5236
02:14:03,521 --> 02:14:05,470

Do you think you'd,

5243
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:12,870
you'd think about dating a professional
baseball player or would that be too

5244
02:14:12,871 --> 02:14:13,704
much pressure?

5245
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:14,650
Uh,

5246
02:14:14,650 --> 02:14:15,340

I'm very,

5254
02:14:24,140 --> 02:14:29,140
especially if they're like super
driven and concentrating on that goal.

5255
02:14:29,260 --> 02:14:30,011
I like that,

02:15:20,321 --> 02:15:21,310
It's just wow.

5299
02:15:21,340 --> 02:15:23,110
It's by how long has that on a plane?

5300
02:15:23,650 --> 02:15:25,150
It was six from New York.

5301
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:25,900
Ooh.

5302
02:15:25,900 --> 02:15:26,733
Yeah.

5303
02:15:26,740 --> 02:15:30,160
And then we took a helicopter
to our hotel to our couples.

5304
02:15:30,440 --> 02:15:32,200
Now I can love chamber

5305
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:33,311
those,

5306
02:15:33,311 --> 02:15:34,030
that area.

5307
02:15:34,030 --> 02:15:36,460
Like if you go down like The Bahamas,

5308
02:15:36,461 --> 02:15:37,330
Jamaica,

5309
02:15:37,360 --> 02:15:37,620
yeah,

5310
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:38,350
he'd go like,

5311
02:15:38,350 --> 02:15:39,340
and the Atlantic,

5312
02:15:39,341 --> 02:15:40,174
South Atlantic.

5313
02:15:40,410 --> 02:15:42,550
You got to worry about storms.

5314
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:43,191
Yeah.

5315
02:15:43,191 --> 02:15:44,420
Not this was not the season,

5316
02:15:44,421 --> 02:15:46,850
but there's like five months where
if you go there you're just like,

5317
02:15:46,851 --> 02:15:47,241
I hope,

5318
02:15:47,241 --> 02:15:48,074
I don't know,

5319
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:51,220
five months where there's a lot of
tourists that go there because it's less

5320
02:15:51,221 --> 02:15:53,530
money and you take some wild chances.

5321
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:57,060
They're so aggressive though because
like the tourist only come for a couple

5322
02:15:57,060 --> 02:15:57,061
months.

5323
02:15:57,061 --> 02:15:58,050
So every,

5324
02:15:58,060 --> 02:15:59,190
we did a ton of shit.

5325
02:15:59,191 --> 02:16:01,840
We like hiked this crazy mountain
and we would go to like these bags.

5326
02:16:01,860 --> 02:16:04,140
We did all this stuff and
every time you leave the hotel,

5327
02:16:04,141 --> 02:16:04,974
they're like,

5328
02:16:04,980 --> 02:16:07,080
just trying to sell
you a fucking necklace.

5329
02:16:07,081 --> 02:16:07,914
And you're like,

5330
02:16:07,950 --> 02:16:08,251
no,

5331
02:16:08,251 --> 02:16:10,080
but they need to come at you that hard.

5332
02:16:10,081 --> 02:16:11,160
Cause that's all they got.

5333
02:16:11,190 --> 02:16:11,461
Yeah.

5334
02:16:11,461 --> 02:16:13,650
It's all they have and
the guy's a hit on you.

5335
02:16:13,651 --> 02:16:14,484
They're like,

5336
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:16,210
that's a whole other ballgame.

5337
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:19,770
They're so aggressive and they're hoping
that you either have like white guilt

5338
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:21,570
or that you're scared of black people.

5339
02:16:21,571 --> 02:16:21,811
And I've,

5340
02:16:21,811 --> 02:16:22,470
I'm neither.

5341
02:16:22,470 --> 02:16:23,303
So I was just like,

5342
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:24,630
like what do they do?

5343
02:16:24,700 --> 02:16:26,420
They just come at you and like,

5344
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:26,660
yeah,

5345
02:16:26,660 --> 02:16:27,630
like they just dance.

5346
02:16:27,631 --> 02:16:29,950
Like they're going to be mad at you

5347
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:31,600
if you don't give me an example.

5348
02:16:31,601 --> 02:16:32,411
Like what's the accent?

5349
02:16:32,411 --> 02:16:33,244
Like?

5350
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:34,000
Oh,

5351
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,170
like I can't,

5352
02:16:35,220 --> 02:16:36,250
I have no idea.

5353
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:37,113
I can't.

5354
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:39,433
Oh,

5355
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:44,720
your dialect coach keeps chiming in
with flawless intonation cartoons.

5356
02:16:48,050 --> 02:16:51,800
I feel like you were
made by a computer dom.

5357
02:16:51,930 --> 02:16:53,230
My rera couldn't figure him out.

5358
02:16:54,420 --> 02:16:55,253
Where'd you get him?

5359
02:16:55,930 --> 02:16:56,763
Where'd you get this gun?

5360
02:16:57,430 --> 02:16:58,750
Has all the people in the world?

5361
02:17:00,850 --> 02:17:01,120
Well,

5362
02:17:01,120 --> 02:17:04,480
we're just talking about islanders.

5363
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:06,340
Really sweet people.

5364
02:17:06,341 --> 02:17:07,174
Then what is the accent?

5365
02:17:07,290 --> 02:17:09,780
It's like a Jamaican type thing.

5366
02:17:09,790 --> 02:17:12,400
So gimme like black
guy comes up to what's,

5367
02:17:12,401 --> 02:17:12,911
what's going on?

5368
02:17:12,911 --> 02:17:13,744
How's he doing?

5369
02:17:15,640 --> 02:17:16,550
I don't know.

5370
02:17:16,610 --> 02:17:17,000
I'm sorry.

5371
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:17,880
I'm so not giving him.

5372
02:17:18,250 --> 02:17:19,360
He's like ready to play.

5373
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:20,453
Would you like to buy some weed?

5374
02:17:21,370 --> 02:17:21,880
Brian?

5375
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:22,713
Brian is,

5376
02:17:24,540 --> 02:17:26,210
what do we do it like what do we do

5377
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,810
right here,

5378
02:17:33,650 --> 02:17:34,690
man on an island.

5379
02:17:36,850 --> 02:17:38,020
Good Dick Right here.

5380
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:38,861
That's good.

5381
02:17:38,861 --> 02:17:42,070
Is that what it is to grab their
dicks so they dance in front of you.

5382
02:17:44,790 --> 02:17:46,420
Grabbing like Michael Jackson style.

5383
02:17:46,430 --> 02:17:47,263
Nothing.

5384
02:17:49,420 --> 02:17:51,670
How often does this take place
during your travels then?

5385
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:53,250
We left the hotel really,

5386
02:17:53,730 --> 02:17:55,740
but there were some people,

5387
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:57,820
there were Great Dick Grammars

5388
02:18:13,390 --> 02:18:16,360
carnival cruises also because I
would imagine that would be the same

5389
02:18:19,130 --> 02:18:19,690
sandals.

5390
02:18:19,690 --> 02:18:20,351
All couples.

5391
02:18:20,351 --> 02:18:21,670
Those are what did you see any families?

5392
02:18:21,700 --> 02:18:22,533
Their

5393
02:18:23,760 --> 02:18:24,880
kids a lot.

5394
02:18:25,090 --> 02:18:26,140
How old can the kid be?

5395
02:18:26,141 --> 02:18:28,450
Can it be 18 no children,

5396
02:18:35,600 --> 02:18:36,800
but then they can drink down there.

5397
02:18:36,890 --> 02:18:38,980
If it's 18 they have crazy drinking loss,

5398
02:18:40,060 --> 02:18:42,340
bring it on the street like New Orleans.

5399
02:18:42,490 --> 02:18:43,820
New Orleans is amazing like that.

5400
02:18:43,870 --> 02:18:48,220
And then there's one place in
America that I say you should have,

5401
02:18:48,310 --> 02:18:50,140
you should have to have a
passport to go to New Orleans.

5402
02:18:50,360 --> 02:18:51,310
This just not America.

5403
02:18:52,780 --> 02:18:55,300
People walking on the street with beers
in their hands right by cops and the

5404
02:18:55,301 --> 02:18:56,740
cops are talking to them and everybody's,

5405
02:18:57,100 --> 02:18:57,970
everybody's friendly.

5406
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:59,150
Such a good vibe.

5407
02:19:01,670 --> 02:19:02,503
[inaudible]

5408
02:19:03,400 --> 02:19:04,240
special in New Orleans,

5409
02:19:04,241 --> 02:19:05,290
but I can time it right,

5410
02:19:05,340 --> 02:19:06,340
like timing sucked.

5411
02:19:06,790 --> 02:19:07,281
But that,

5412
02:19:07,281 --> 02:19:08,380
that place is amazing.

5413
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:10,210
Friendly and fun.

5414
02:19:10,211 --> 02:19:10,931
And I did a show there.

5415
02:19:10,931 --> 02:19:11,800
I did the House of Blues.

5416
02:19:11,801 --> 02:19:13,450
There was one of my favorite all time.

5417
02:19:15,450 --> 02:19:16,070
Yeah,

5418
02:19:16,070 --> 02:19:19,000
we went to and then we
watched some burlesque.

5419
02:19:19,160 --> 02:19:19,630
What a,

5420
02:19:19,630 --> 02:19:21,010
what a hustle that is.

5421
02:19:21,250 --> 02:19:22,960
What a nonsense hustle.

5422
02:19:22,961 --> 02:19:24,340
Those burlesque shows are.

5423
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:27,680
Well one of them of them,

5424
02:19:27,681 --> 02:19:28,040
it was

5425
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:28,880
really weird.

5426
02:19:28,881 --> 02:19:31,550
Like there was a guy like a
carnival barker dude comes on,

5427
02:19:31,551 --> 02:19:34,670
he's got a big handlebar mustache
and he's dressed kind of crazy.

5428
02:19:34,880 --> 02:19:36,050
Like he's from another time,

5429
02:19:36,230 --> 02:19:40,190
there was a couple people that actually
had a pretty dope act and one of them,

5430
02:19:40,191 --> 02:19:44,330
there was a guy and a girl and they
had like little Hula hoops and um,

5431
02:19:44,390 --> 02:19:44,621
the,

5432
02:19:44,621 --> 02:19:45,291
the guy would,

5433
02:19:45,291 --> 02:19:45,500
uh,

5434
02:19:45,500 --> 02:19:46,680
throw the girl up in the end,

5435
02:19:46,710 --> 02:19:48,390
she would land on her
shoulders that she would have.

5436
02:19:48,410 --> 02:19:48,920
It was,

5437
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:50,720
it was really a great act.

5438
02:19:50,721 --> 02:19:53,870
And they were like Hula Hoop and together
while the girl was on top and the guy

5439
02:19:53,871 --> 02:19:55,100
was like holding her up with his hands.

5440
02:19:55,220 --> 02:19:55,530
It,

5441
02:19:55,530 --> 02:19:57,560
they knew what the fuck they would
do and they had planned it out.

5442
02:19:57,570 --> 02:19:57,720
Yeah.

5443
02:19:57,720 --> 02:20:02,720
And then the next one was literally an
overweight woman who dances and the guy

5444
02:20:03,081 --> 02:20:06,620
introduces her saying that
beautiful things come at all,

5445
02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:08,600
literally said this.

5446
02:20:08,840 --> 02:20:10,220
She like really David.

5447
02:20:10,270 --> 02:20:12,440
And she wasn't obese.

5448
02:20:12,441 --> 02:20:14,770
It wasn't like disgusting
where he had a warrant.

5449
02:20:14,780 --> 02:20:16,340
Ours is not hiring her.

5450
02:20:16,370 --> 02:20:16,641
Yeah,

5451
02:20:16,641 --> 02:20:17,750
no scores is not hiring.

5452
02:20:17,770 --> 02:20:17,901
Right.

5453
02:20:17,901 --> 02:20:21,200
And so she gets up there and she's got
this bright smile on her face and it's

5454
02:20:21,201 --> 02:20:21,620
like,

5455
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:24,620
it's like this weird thing that everyone's
dressed from like a period piece,

5456
02:20:24,621 --> 02:20:27,140
but essentially all she did
was stand there and dance.

5457
02:20:27,340 --> 02:20:28,760
So it was the emperor's new clothes.

5458
02:20:29,930 --> 02:20:31,910
She took a little bit of
the clothes off at the end.

5459
02:20:31,911 --> 02:20:34,880
She was kind of in like sort of a bikini
type of thing and then she got off and

5460
02:20:34,881 --> 02:20:36,110
everybody clapped and I'm like,

5461
02:20:36,111 --> 02:20:36,471
fuck,

5462
02:20:36,471 --> 02:20:37,304
really?

5463
02:20:37,310 --> 02:20:37,581
I'm like,

5464
02:20:37,581 --> 02:20:38,301
what is going on?

5465
02:20:38,301 --> 02:20:40,850
Why are we pretending
like that was exciting,

5466
02:20:41,370 --> 02:20:42,080
real weird.

5467
02:20:42,080 --> 02:20:42,920
And we were complaining,

5468
02:20:42,921 --> 02:20:43,430
I'm sorry.

5469
02:20:43,430 --> 02:20:45,710
We were complaining about and the
people around us are getting upset.

5470
02:20:45,711 --> 02:20:46,490
We had to leave.

5471
02:20:46,490 --> 02:20:47,070
Oh really?

5472
02:20:47,070 --> 02:20:49,370
Everybody else's lives are
complaining and you were like,

5473
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:50,690
there's a man behind that curtain.

5474
02:20:51,340 --> 02:20:52,430
He's pulling the levers.

5475
02:20:52,431 --> 02:20:53,450
We can see it from here.

5476
02:20:53,470 --> 02:20:54,303
Exactly.

5477
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:55,250
This is not real.

5478
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:57,740
I'm glad you said something
while we were just like,

5479
02:20:57,770 --> 02:20:58,580
what is this?

5480
02:20:58,580 --> 02:20:58,790
Yeah,

5481
02:20:58,790 --> 02:20:59,481
like it just,

5482
02:20:59,481 --> 02:21:00,350
you just like truth.

5483
02:21:00,380 --> 02:21:00,831
You're just like,

5484
02:21:00,831 --> 02:21:03,860
can we not pretend like that was
something that should happen again?

5485
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:04,071
Well,

5486
02:21:04,071 --> 02:21:04,920
it was a two.

5487
02:21:04,950 --> 02:21:05,420
It was two,

5488
02:21:05,420 --> 02:21:06,380
two comics in me.

5489
02:21:06,381 --> 02:21:07,041
It was me,

5490
02:21:07,041 --> 02:21:08,680
Dunkin and Felicia Michaels.

5491
02:21:08,770 --> 02:21:09,080
Yeah.

5492
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:09,890
And uh,

5493
02:21:09,890 --> 02:21:10,401
Jeff,

5494
02:21:10,401 --> 02:21:11,960
who was our driver in New Orleans,

5495
02:21:11,961 --> 02:21:12,980
who's cool as fuck too.

5496
02:21:12,981 --> 02:21:13,340
Yeah.

5497
02:21:13,340 --> 02:21:13,531
And we'll,

5498
02:21:13,531 --> 02:21:14,030
we're all,

5499
02:21:14,030 --> 02:21:14,301
you know,

5500
02:21:14,301 --> 02:21:15,230
we're all looking at this going,

5501
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:16,670
what the fuck are we watching?

5502
02:21:16,700 --> 02:21:17,570
What is this?

5503
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:17,800
Oh,

5504
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:18,890
this is nonsense.

5505
02:21:18,910 --> 02:21:19,760
But that second place,

5506
02:21:19,761 --> 02:21:20,590
the food,

5507
02:21:20,590 --> 02:21:21,423
Oh yes.

5508
02:21:21,450 --> 02:21:22,283
Food anywhere.

5509
02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:23,011
Did your,

5510
02:21:23,011 --> 02:21:25,530
I went to Amsterdam and
we went to a sex show.

5511
02:21:25,650 --> 02:21:26,280
Oh shoot.

5512
02:21:26,280 --> 02:21:27,120
Did you see though,

5513
02:21:27,210 --> 02:21:29,130
have you seen those top
notes on what you saw?

5514
02:21:29,250 --> 02:21:29,521
It will,

5515
02:21:29,521 --> 02:21:30,660
they were really depressing.

5516
02:21:30,690 --> 02:21:32,280
It was like totally clinical.

5517
02:21:32,370 --> 02:21:32,790
Um,

5518
02:21:32,790 --> 02:21:33,420
so be like,

5519
02:21:33,420 --> 02:21:36,600
there was a DJ and then like a
bed would be wheeled out on stage.

5520
02:21:36,601 --> 02:21:37,980
It would be like this French guy.

5521
02:21:37,981 --> 02:21:38,814
And he's like,

5522
02:21:38,820 --> 02:21:39,660
Zec is,

5523
02:21:39,661 --> 02:21:40,494
uh,

5524
02:21:40,510 --> 02:21:40,950
um,

5525
02:21:40,950 --> 02:21:43,910
Michelle and her lover Mat and then a,

5526
02:21:43,930 --> 02:21:46,140
and they kind of like both come out
in the bed and then they're like,

5527
02:21:46,470 --> 02:21:49,230
they wave and then they like start like,

5528
02:21:49,620 --> 02:21:50,310
um,

5529
02:21:50,310 --> 02:21:53,490
like a second of kind of like
foreplay that's choreographed.

5530
02:21:53,910 --> 02:21:55,500
And then they start fucking like,

5531
02:21:55,501 --> 02:21:56,370
he starts fucking her.

5532
02:21:56,700 --> 02:22:00,090
And the bed's rotating and it's to
music and he's banging her to the beat.

5533
02:22:00,420 --> 02:22:00,991
And then,

5534
02:22:00,991 --> 02:22:01,824
uh,

5535
02:22:01,950 --> 02:22:03,510
and then after like three minutes,

5536
02:22:03,511 --> 02:22:04,080
they're like,

5537
02:22:04,080 --> 02:22:04,890
thank you.

5538
02:22:04,890 --> 02:22:05,401
And um,

5539
02:22:05,401 --> 02:22:09,960
and then they turned to the crowd and
they wave and the curtain closes and the

5540
02:22:09,961 --> 02:22:10,381
bag goes.

5541
02:22:10,381 --> 02:22:12,930
And then this girl would
come out in between.

5542
02:22:12,931 --> 02:22:17,630
I'm in between people having sex
and like kind of like a burlesque,

5543
02:22:17,631 --> 02:22:19,260
like type strep or she's Kinda hot,

5544
02:22:19,261 --> 02:22:21,090
like high school friend hot.

5545
02:22:21,510 --> 02:22:23,370
And she didn't really
know what she was doing.

5546
02:22:23,371 --> 02:22:23,880
She,

5547
02:22:23,880 --> 02:22:26,700
she danced like she was
for like the palm squad,

5548
02:22:26,970 --> 02:22:29,160
so she'd be in like a bra and
underwear and she would just be like,

5549
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:33,330
like just kind of dancing around.

5550
02:22:33,690 --> 02:22:34,710
And it was interesting.

5551
02:22:34,711 --> 02:22:37,050
It was like kind of interesting to watch,

5552
02:22:37,380 --> 02:22:38,041
but it just,

5553
02:22:38,041 --> 02:22:40,830
nothing was sexy about
the whole experience.

5554
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:43,320
And then somebody in a
gorilla suit comes out,

5555
02:22:43,740 --> 02:22:44,573
um,

5556
02:22:44,670 --> 02:22:48,270
with a fake dick and s
word sit on the crowd.

5557
02:22:49,750 --> 02:22:51,240
That was a whole show that was all show.

5558
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:52,530
But there was a couple of home visits.

5559
02:22:52,840 --> 02:22:53,760
Like what was the time?

5560
02:22:53,960 --> 02:22:54,793
Uh,

5561
02:22:54,960 --> 02:22:57,000
I think it was like an hour.

5562
02:22:57,930 --> 02:22:59,580
So the other stuff was just like filler.

5563
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:00,251
Yeah.

5564
02:23:00,251 --> 02:23:02,100
Filler between people having sex.

5565
02:23:02,170 --> 02:23:02,610
Wow.

5566
02:23:02,610 --> 02:23:03,750
But the DJ was pretty funny.

5567
02:23:03,751 --> 02:23:05,310
Like they were funny with
each other and they were like,

5568
02:23:05,311 --> 02:23:05,941
thank you.

5569
02:23:05,941 --> 02:23:06,360
Oh,

5570
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:08,220
she's back from her tour of the,

5571
02:23:08,221 --> 02:23:08,491
you know,

5572
02:23:08,491 --> 02:23:09,210
it was just,

5573
02:23:09,210 --> 02:23:10,710
it was all kind of like ironic,

5574
02:23:10,890 --> 02:23:14,970
but there was not a second of
anything sensual or exciting.

5575
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:16,080
Wow.

5576
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:16,890
I think,

5577
02:23:16,890 --> 02:23:18,240
I wonder if they do that on purpose.

5578
02:23:18,241 --> 02:23:18,841
Like nobody,

5579
02:23:18,841 --> 02:23:21,060
there would've been no one
was taking their dick out.

5580
02:23:21,061 --> 02:23:22,040
I think it was just like,

5581
02:23:22,190 --> 02:23:23,600
maybe that's probably
exactly what they're doing.

5582
02:23:23,601 --> 02:23:24,260
Yeah.

5583
02:23:24,260 --> 02:23:25,580
They had a show at the Riviera.

5584
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:27,170
They should do call crazy girl.

5585
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:28,030
But still there.

5586
02:23:28,030 --> 02:23:29,090
Is it still there?

5587
02:23:29,230 --> 02:23:29,470
Yeah.

5588
02:23:29,470 --> 02:23:30,590
Oh my God.

5589
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:32,023
That,

5590
02:23:32,060 --> 02:23:33,440
who's who's hosting it now?

5591
02:23:33,560 --> 02:23:34,340
I don't know.

5592
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:35,173
Let me see.

5593
02:23:35,740 --> 02:23:37,280
There we have is so funny.

5594
02:23:37,790 --> 02:23:38,481
We were just,

5595
02:23:38,481 --> 02:23:38,691
um,

5596
02:23:38,691 --> 02:23:39,950
I don't stay there.

5597
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:40,670
Um,

5598
02:23:40,670 --> 02:23:44,360
but we were just in a record store before
I start puking my guts out listening

5599
02:23:44,361 --> 02:23:47,330
to old comedy albums and Totie
fields had one and it starts,

5600
02:23:47,331 --> 02:23:48,980
it's like live from the Riviera.

5601
02:23:49,310 --> 02:23:49,581
I mean,

5602
02:23:49,581 --> 02:23:50,720
Jackie were so psyched.

5603
02:23:50,750 --> 02:23:51,321
And Woody Allen,

5604
02:23:51,321 --> 02:23:51,830
ed one,

5605
02:23:51,830 --> 02:23:53,150
like there's a lot of history at that,

5606
02:23:53,300 --> 02:23:54,133
at that place,

5607
02:23:54,290 --> 02:23:55,840
but yet crazy girls is up and running.

5608
02:23:56,400 --> 02:23:58,140
Dean Martin was a host of front.

5609
02:23:58,141 --> 02:23:58,560
Wow.

5610
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:00,520
Frank Sinatra and Dean
Martin used to do shows.

5611
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:01,220
Oh,

5612
02:24:01,220 --> 02:24:01,580
okay.

5613
02:24:01,580 --> 02:24:01,890
Yeah.

5614
02:24:01,890 --> 02:24:02,870
Stayed in Frank Sinatra.

5615
02:24:02,871 --> 02:24:04,300
Sweet once at Harris,

It's such a,

5624
02:24:12,480 --> 02:24:15,170
it's like such a horrible
old Vegas showroom.

Great Story.

5629
02:24:16,681 --> 02:24:16,921
I mean,

5630
02:24:16,921 --> 02:24:18,360
he was a guy who was,

5631
02:24:18,361 --> 02:24:18,710
uh,

5632
02:24:18,710 --> 02:24:21,810
the talent coordinator at the Riviera
and then all of sudden he got on

5633
02:24:21,811 --> 02:24:22,460
soprano's.

5634
02:24:22,460 --> 02:24:22,740
Yeah.

5635
02:24:22,740 --> 02:24:26,410
And then it turns into a real career
as an actor writing books and shirts.

5636
02:24:26,480 --> 02:24:26,910
Nuts.

5637
02:24:26,910 --> 02:24:27,400
Yeah.

5638
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:27,780
I don't,

5639
02:24:27,780 --> 02:24:28,613
it doesn't see,

5640
02:24:28,890 --> 02:24:31,170
it doesn't say here who
the host is crazy girls.

5641
02:24:31,590 --> 02:24:31,771
It's,

5642
02:24:31,771 --> 02:24:33,840
they're not advertising who
the host is at the hotel.

5643
02:24:34,050 --> 02:24:34,151
Oh,

5644
02:24:34,151 --> 02:24:34,560
really?

5645
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:35,730
It's just like crazy girls

5646
02:24:36,530 --> 02:24:37,390
used to be,

5647
02:24:38,260 --> 02:24:38,981
but what do they do?

5648
02:24:38,981 --> 02:24:39,580
I've never,

5649
02:24:39,580 --> 02:24:40,413
I haven't gone in,

5650
02:24:41,480 --> 02:24:42,050
uh,

5651
02:24:42,050 --> 02:24:43,610
well it's like girls,

5652
02:24:43,611 --> 02:24:45,800
they sing songs and then
they pulled her tits out.

5653
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:46,580
Oh.

5654
02:24:46,580 --> 02:24:48,260
And some of them actually have,

5655
02:24:48,290 --> 02:24:49,123
uh,

5656
02:24:49,130 --> 02:24:51,790
they actually have pretty good sense.

5657
02:24:52,040 --> 02:24:52,520
Okay.

5658
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:53,353
Well they're good tests,

5659
02:24:53,540 --> 02:24:54,830
but some of them actually have talent.

5660
02:24:54,910 --> 02:24:55,460
And A,

5661
02:24:55,460 --> 02:24:56,600
I watched it once and it was,

5662
02:24:56,660 --> 02:25:00,830
it was kind of sad because
this girl was singing like,

5663
02:25:00,831 --> 02:25:01,664
um,

5664
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:02,990
a Whitney Houston song.

5665
02:25:03,680 --> 02:25:06,320
It was like the greatest love of all or
something like that right after when you

5666
02:25:06,321 --> 02:25:06,770
died?

5667
02:25:06,770 --> 02:25:07,071
No,

5668
02:25:07,071 --> 02:25:07,904
as long time ago.

5669
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:08,110
Uh,

5670
02:25:08,110 --> 02:25:09,200
for the moment.

5671
02:25:09,201 --> 02:25:09,890
Sure.

5672
02:25:09,890 --> 02:25:10,723
Psychic.

5673
02:25:10,900 --> 02:25:12,130
She woke up in the middle of the night.

5674
02:25:12,160 --> 02:25:13,210
He'll set up in bed

5675
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:17,230
nailing and murdered Whitney.

5676
02:25:17,250 --> 02:25:17,920
Oh,

5677
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:19,030
that was a cover by the way.

5678
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:19,990
We did a cover,

5679
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:21,700
I might not even been that song,

5680
02:25:21,860 --> 02:25:22,810
but whatever song it was,

5681
02:25:22,811 --> 02:25:23,290
should we,

5682
02:25:23,290 --> 02:25:23,711
this song,

5683
02:25:23,711 --> 02:25:24,340
very soulful

5684
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:24,670
song.

5685
02:25:24,670 --> 02:25:27,070
And she has her tits out and I'm like,

5686
02:25:27,071 --> 02:25:27,311
wow,

5687
02:25:27,311 --> 02:25:29,110
that's gotta be kind
of demeaning in a way.

5688
02:25:29,111 --> 02:25:30,070
It's like really weird.

5689
02:25:30,130 --> 02:25:32,920
It's like she's singing at the top of her.

5690
02:25:32,980 --> 02:25:33,161
I mean,

5691
02:25:33,161 --> 02:25:34,750
she's singing the best of her abilities.

5692
02:25:34,751 --> 02:25:36,280
She's actually a talented singer,

5693
02:25:36,610 --> 02:25:41,200
but her tits are out and she's got like
a sort of like a mini skirt dress on and

5694
02:25:41,201 --> 02:25:44,980
her tits are out and you can tell that
she wants to be taken seriously as a

5695
02:25:44,981 --> 02:25:45,311
singer.

5696
02:25:45,311 --> 02:25:47,110
But she's saying let her tits out.

5697
02:25:47,111 --> 02:25:47,240
Okay.

5698
02:25:47,240 --> 02:25:48,320
It's horrible.

5699
02:25:48,350 --> 02:25:49,340
That's really sad.

5700
02:25:49,370 --> 02:25:50,120
It was weird.

5701
02:25:50,120 --> 02:25:50,960
It was just weird.

5702
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:52,700
It says so much sadness.

5703
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:53,553
Yes.

5704
02:25:53,750 --> 02:25:54,590
Deep Sadness.

5705
02:25:54,591 --> 02:25:55,101
They have those,

5706
02:25:55,101 --> 02:25:55,610
um,

5707
02:25:55,610 --> 02:25:56,660
at the imperial palace.

5708
02:25:56,661 --> 02:25:58,520
They've dealer Tanner's what?

5709
02:25:58,850 --> 02:25:59,081
Wait,

5710
02:25:59,081 --> 02:25:59,810
did I cut you off?

5711
02:25:59,810 --> 02:26:00,080
No.

5712
02:26:00,080 --> 02:26:00,530
Okay.

5713
02:26:00,530 --> 02:26:01,660
You're still doing this for the year.

5714
02:26:03,360 --> 02:26:03,741
I'm like,

5715
02:26:03,741 --> 02:26:03,861
oh,

5716
02:26:03,861 --> 02:26:04,940
is he still talking about her tits?

5717
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:05,833
No.

5718
02:26:06,310 --> 02:26:06,480
Yeah,

5719
02:26:06,480 --> 02:26:07,790
there's what they have or the,

5720
02:26:07,791 --> 02:26:10,790
the dealers are all dressed
like celebrity celebrities,

5721
02:26:11,610 --> 02:26:12,640
dealer detainers and your,

5722
02:26:12,641 --> 02:26:13,490
so your dealer,

5723
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:16,250
like every hour they'll like be
like some signal in there like,

5724
02:26:16,640 --> 02:26:16,761
oh,

5725
02:26:16,761 --> 02:26:17,151
sorry.

5726
02:26:17,151 --> 02:26:20,120
And so the guy dresses like Michael
Jackson or a girl's Rihanna,

5727
02:26:20,121 --> 02:26:24,200
and they have to like stand on the stage
and like do an act and sing and then

5728
02:26:24,201 --> 02:26:25,910
they come back and uh,

5729
02:26:25,911 --> 02:26:26,750
at first you're like,

5730
02:26:26,751 --> 02:26:27,441
it's kind of funny.

5731
02:26:27,441 --> 02:26:28,790
And then it gets so sad,

5732
02:26:28,791 --> 02:26:29,510
so fast.

5733
02:26:29,510 --> 02:26:30,230
Are we going?

5734
02:26:30,230 --> 02:26:30,411
Yeah.

5735
02:26:30,411 --> 02:26:30,920
You're just like,

5736
02:26:30,920 --> 02:26:31,190
ah.

5737
02:26:31,190 --> 02:26:32,150
And then you just want to gamble.

5738
02:26:32,151 --> 02:26:32,480
You're like,

5739
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:32,631
oh,

5740
02:26:32,631 --> 02:26:34,190
can you please stop with all the bullshit?

5741
02:26:34,191 --> 02:26:35,000
Just like,

5742
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:35,960
let's do this.

5743
02:26:36,410 --> 02:26:36,890
Wow.

5744
02:26:36,890 --> 02:26:37,310
Yeah.

5745
02:26:37,310 --> 02:26:38,360
Like who was your guy?

5746
02:26:38,510 --> 02:26:43,510
We had Michael Jackson and then I think
maybe Shania twain or Miley Cyrus.

5747
02:26:44,310 --> 02:26:45,770
It actually looked like Michael Jackson.

5748
02:26:46,430 --> 02:26:47,263
He was white.

5749
02:26:51,380 --> 02:26:51,531
Well,

5750
02:26:51,531 --> 02:26:54,350
that's a tricky one because you
can hire a black guy to do it.

5751
02:26:54,440 --> 02:26:55,040
I know.

5752
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:55,880
That's real.

5753
02:26:55,910 --> 02:26:57,110
You got to know from a lot of,

5754
02:26:57,111 --> 02:26:57,830
what do you do?

5755
02:26:57,830 --> 02:26:58,011
Yeah.

5756
02:26:58,011 --> 02:26:59,690
There's not a real
likeness to any of them.

5757
02:26:59,691 --> 02:27:02,780
Like you spend half the time
trying to figure out who they are.

5758
02:27:03,140 --> 02:27:03,711
Like you're like,

5759
02:27:03,711 --> 02:27:04,880
is that Bonnie Raitt

5760
02:27:08,920 --> 02:27:10,190
Boy George or whoever.

5761
02:27:10,210 --> 02:27:11,043
Now

5762
02:27:17,070 --> 02:27:18,470
it's a really tough,

5763
02:27:18,590 --> 02:27:18,921
all right,

5764
02:27:18,921 --> 02:27:20,700
let's bring this fucking
ship into the harbor.

5765
02:27:20,780 --> 02:27:21,340
Alright,

5766
02:27:21,340 --> 02:27:22,790
Schumer once again.

5767
02:27:22,850 --> 02:27:23,690
You were hilarious.

5768
02:27:25,160 --> 02:27:25,551
I'm glad.

5769
02:27:25,551 --> 02:27:26,990
We're besties for life.

5770
02:27:27,110 --> 02:27:27,930
We're besties.

5771
02:27:27,930 --> 02:27:30,350
We exchanged messages.

5772
02:27:30,410 --> 02:27:31,750
You're my emergency contacts

5773
02:27:32,090 --> 02:27:32,870
buddy.

5774
02:27:32,870 --> 02:27:34,010
So happy you came back.

5775
02:27:34,110 --> 02:27:34,821
He'd love you.

5776
02:27:34,821 --> 02:27:35,480
I love you.

5777
02:27:35,480 --> 02:27:36,141
When are you going to be,

5778
02:27:36,141 --> 02:27:36,410
um,

5779
02:27:36,410 --> 02:27:36,680
what's,

5780
02:27:36,680 --> 02:27:37,191
what's your,

5781
02:27:37,191 --> 02:27:37,550
um,

5782
02:27:37,550 --> 02:27:38,140
your tour dates?

5783
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:38,871
It's fine.

5784
02:27:38,871 --> 02:27:41,720
The next time I'm in Tampa and Denver,

5785
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:42,780
the end of April.

5786
02:27:42,781 --> 02:27:44,760
And then the Riviera tons of when,

5787
02:27:44,820 --> 02:27:45,600
when are you in Tampa?

5788
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:47,100
Like towards the end of April?

5789
02:27:47,101 --> 02:27:47,221
Yeah,

5790
02:27:47,221 --> 02:27:48,080
like so Amy Schumer,

5791
02:27:48,081 --> 02:27:48,200
[inaudible]

5792
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:53,200
dot com and it's Schumer
with an s c h s c h a m e s.

5793
02:27:53,751 --> 02:27:54,260
C h.

5794
02:27:54,260 --> 02:27:54,681
E m.

5795
02:27:54,681 --> 02:27:55,730
E.

5796
02:27:55,730 --> 02:27:55,730
R.

5797
02:27:55,730 --> 02:27:59,810
I m still selling tickets for a Atlanta.

5798
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:01,310
The second show's not sold out yet.

5799
02:28:01,311 --> 02:28:06,140
So the Tabernacle on April 20th
where I'm filming my new special,

5800
02:28:06,141 --> 02:28:10,940
I'm going to be releasing an online first
show sold out and a fucking pumped to

5801
02:28:10,941 --> 02:28:11,810
be doing in Atlanta.

5802
02:28:11,811 --> 02:28:12,260
Man,

5803
02:28:12,260 --> 02:28:16,610
I haven't been there in two years and
I'm super psyched and I'm completely

5804
02:28:16,611 --> 02:28:17,660
geared up for this bitch.

5805
02:28:17,720 --> 02:28:20,120
And a next year or next week rather is,

5806
02:28:20,121 --> 02:28:20,660
um,

5807
02:28:20,660 --> 02:28:25,460
the final stage I'm going to be at
the Fort Lauderdale Improv with,

5808
02:28:25,580 --> 02:28:26,900
they want an only Duncan Trussell.

5809
02:28:26,901 --> 02:28:30,740
So that'll be this upcoming Friday,

5810
02:28:30,740 --> 02:28:30,741
Saturday and Sunday.

5811
02:28:30,741 --> 02:28:31,401
It's not next week.

5812
02:28:31,401 --> 02:28:31,701
If this,

5813
02:28:31,701 --> 02:28:32,870
this next weekend,

5814
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:34,010
this weekend coming up.

5815
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:35,570
So this weekend,

5816
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:36,500
Fort Lauderdale,

5817
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:41,620
next weekend on the 20th is Atlanta and
that's when I'm going to be taping my

5818
02:28:41,691 --> 02:28:43,610
special Ed day before the UFC in Atlanta.

5819
02:28:46,210 --> 02:28:49,070
We have a show here Wednesday night
at nine o'clock at the ice house,

5820
02:28:49,450 --> 02:28:53,830
another wild tuneup show
before we escape to Florida,

5821
02:28:53,860 --> 02:28:57,010
before the race riot kicks in to hear
the shooting at cop cars down there now.

5822
02:28:57,610 --> 02:28:57,911
Yeah.

5823
02:28:57,911 --> 02:28:59,620
That's where the Trayvon
Martin shooting happened.

5824
02:28:59,980 --> 02:29:01,150
They killed Florida.

5825
02:29:01,580 --> 02:29:02,413
Florida's going crazy.

5826
02:29:03,250 --> 02:29:05,620
I don't know what part I'll have to
get back to you with that information.

5827
02:29:06,130 --> 02:29:09,550

5830
02:29:12,310 --> 02:29:14,800
thinking about masturbating and go pick
up one of those cause it's way better

5831
02:29:14,801 --> 02:29:15,670
than just using your hand.

5832
02:29:16,180 --> 02:29:17,013
Uh,

5833
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:18,010
entering the code name Brogan,

5834
02:29:18,040 --> 02:29:21,400
save yourself 15% off the
number one sex toy for men.

5835
02:29:21,430 --> 02:29:22,810
It's a solid product
that he's a gentlemen.

5836
02:29:23,050 --> 02:29:25,720
Thank you also to [inaudible]
Dot com o n n I t,

5837
02:29:25,721 --> 02:29:27,280
makers of Alpha Brain shroom,

5838
02:29:27,281 --> 02:29:27,491
tech,

5839
02:29:27,491 --> 02:29:27,851

5840
02:29:27,851 --> 02:29:28,151
shroom,

immune and new mood.

5843
02:29:30,580 --> 02:29:31,340
Both,

5844
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:31,870
um,

5845
02:29:31,870 --> 02:29:32,730
shroom techs or,

5846
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:33,071
well,

5847
02:29:33,071 --> 02:29:33,970
it was different things.

5848
02:29:33,971 --> 02:29:35,290
Different things do different things.

5849
02:29:35,320 --> 02:29:35,650
There's,

5850
02:29:35,650 --> 02:29:37,180
some of them are nootropics,

5851
02:29:37,181 --> 02:29:37,890
other ones are,

5852
02:29:37,890 --> 02:29:38,290
um,

5853
02:29:38,290 --> 02:29:40,760
athletic enhancement supplements and um,

5854
02:29:40,960 --> 02:29:42,700
maybe they'd be performance
enhancing drugs.

5855
02:29:42,730 --> 02:29:43,563
Maybe you could say that.

5856
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:45,040
I wonder if there'll be illegal someday.

5857
02:29:45,460 --> 02:29:47,860
Get them out before the government comes
in and takes all the shit that makes

5858
02:29:47,861 --> 02:29:48,694
you feel better.

5859
02:29:48,890 --> 02:29:50,590
Everything is a
performance enhancing drug.

5860
02:29:50,591 --> 02:29:50,781
Dude,

5861
02:29:50,781 --> 02:29:51,790
even fucking vitamins.

5862
02:29:51,791 --> 02:29:52,630
Did you know that Brian?

5863
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:54,340
It helps you perform.

5864
02:29:54,341 --> 02:29:55,960
It's a God damn performance enhancer.

5865
02:29:56,650 --> 02:29:56,920
Uh,

5866
02:29:56,920 --> 02:29:58,120

5870
02:30:07,451 --> 02:30:10,600
the bottle 30 pills is
100% money back guarantee.

5871
02:30:10,601 --> 02:30:11,470
If you're not satisfied,

5872
02:30:11,471 --> 02:30:12,161
if you don't like it,

5873
02:30:12,161 --> 02:30:13,150
you don't even have to return it.

5874
02:30:13,510 --> 02:30:16,240
Just tell us that shit sucks
and you get your money,

5875
02:30:16,870 --> 02:30:18,430
but it won't suck or use it.

5876
02:30:18,610 --> 02:30:20,620
This shit is awesome and
you should use it too.

5877
02:30:20,621 --> 02:30:21,620
Especially if you have a,

5878
02:30:21,640 --> 02:30:25,900
if you're jet lagged or hung over and
I know you are on a regular dirty you

5879
02:30:26,500 --> 02:30:29,320
dirty bitch or if he can't
cope without the Teede.

5880
02:30:30,100 --> 02:30:30,401
Uh,

5881
02:30:30,401 --> 02:30:31,234
I don't think that's true.

5882
02:30:32,230 --> 02:30:32,791
I think the,

5883
02:30:32,791 --> 02:30:34,600
the you got to eat the
actual cordyceps mushroom.

5884
02:30:34,601 --> 02:30:36,520
I don't know if it actually
helps you cope without the two.

5885
02:30:36,530 --> 02:30:37,780
I don't want to put any false statements.

5886
02:30:37,781 --> 02:30:37,991
Brian.

5887
02:30:37,991 --> 02:30:41,860
I want to do the research on that before
I confirm or deny cope with Whitney

5888
02:30:41,860 --> 02:30:42,310
Houston.

5889
02:30:42,310 --> 02:30:43,360
Altitude sucks dude.

5890
02:30:43,361 --> 02:30:44,194
Nothing is going to help you.

5891
02:30:44,880 --> 02:30:46,000
It might help you a little like,

5892
02:30:46,060 --> 02:30:46,893
Ugh,

5893
02:30:48,280 --> 02:30:49,240
that's the end of this program.

5894
02:30:49,241 --> 02:30:49,750
God dammit.

5895
02:30:49,750 --> 02:30:52,540
We'll be back tomorrow
with a Neal Brennan.

5896
02:30:52,780 --> 02:30:53,060

5898
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:57,910
and then uh,

5899
02:30:57,910 --> 02:31:00,670
I'll see you dirty bitches in Fort
Lauderdale this weekend in Atlanta.

5900
02:31:00,670 --> 02:31:03,690
Next week chronicles Amy
Schumer is going to do so.

5901
02:31:04,010 --> 02:31:06,220
Show was crazy as fuck you
going to do the show as well.

5902
02:31:06,560 --> 02:31:07,300
God Damn it.

5903
02:31:07,300 --> 02:31:08,140
What a fucking show.

5904
02:31:08,141 --> 02:31:08,920
It's me.

5905
02:31:08,920 --> 02:31:09,551
Amy Schumer.

5906
02:31:09,551 --> 02:31:10,384
Who else?

5907
02:31:10,470 --> 02:31:12,670
So surprises a bunch of the surprises.

5908
02:31:13,870 --> 02:31:14,730
We'll probably will stop.

5909
02:31:14,800 --> 02:31:16,960
A lot of la comics is always the,

5910

the regular crew.

5912
02:31:17,951 --> 02:31:18,341
I know Joe.

5913
02:31:18,341 --> 02:31:20,060
He's got a 10 o'clock at the implant.

5914
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:20,580
You can't do it.

5915
02:31:20,580 --> 02:31:21,413
Can't do it.

5916
02:31:22,620 --> 02:31:23,970
You dirty bitch.

5917
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:24,960
All right folks.

5918
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:25,351
That's it.

5919
02:31:25,351 --> 02:31:26,184
We'll see you tomorrow.

5925
02:31:32,850 --> 02:31:33,683
Let's ride this thing.

5926
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:35,820
Fucking boat hits the beach.
