00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,770
Hello Freak bitches in some
something that's like a,

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:05,610
I,

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:05,970
I,

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,680
I came in here and remember I got,

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,610
had gotten sick and I
had to postpone on you.

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,223
Um,

7
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,950
and anyways I went to
a hospital down in uh,

8
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,880
or up in Valencia I think,

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,230
and they had thrown me in a room for
three hours and they were thinking about

10
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,810
getting Hazmat suits out and all this
stuff because I thought you might've had

11
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:26,260
ebola because you came back from Africa,

12
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:26,430
right?

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:26,521
Yeah,

14
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:26,821
right,

15
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:28,170
right after the Ebola crisis,

16
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:28,771
but it had been,

17
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:29,604
um,

18
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,080
I had been back for like two months or
something or maybe even close to three

19
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,030
and a.

20
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:36,571
yeah,

21
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:38,730
they were going all crazy and stuff.

22
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,250
And this is just a stat that I
like to sum that grips my heart.

23
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:45,690
So that's why I want to say it now.

24
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:45,930
But,

25
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,763
um,

26
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,360
men,

27
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,110
I think I looked it up
right before I got in,

28
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,370
in here and it was around 11,000
people that have bullet took,

29
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,230
took out 11,000 people.

30
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,040
That's a ton.

31
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,731
It's a ton.

32
00:00:56,731 --> 00:00:57,960
It's a brutal crisis.

33
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,080
But I just remember the uproar that,

34
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,610
that in the fear,

35
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:03,561
like the,

36
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:08,060
the outcry that happened publicly all
over the United States and only a couple

37
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,440
people got it here and then,

38
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,551
and still,

39
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:12,270
that's terrible.

40
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,080
Um,

41
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,080
but whenever I compare that 11,000 people
total in this ebola crisis and then

42
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,280
the stat for children,

43
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,700
and this is on water for
his website and stuff and,

44
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,870
and on ours and dude,

45
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:28,080
it's what I want to fight and let people
know because there should be a real

46
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,340
public outcry and uproar that 5,000 kids,

47
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,460
50,000 kids under the
age of five years old,

48
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,130
die every single day,

49
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,250
every single day because of dirty water,

50
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,020
because of waterborne disease,

51
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,370
because of waterborne illness.

52
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:48,900
That's a legit stat from UNICEF
or one of those like legit places,

53
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,830
five down,

54
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,120
$5,000 a day.

55
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,220
It's like,

56
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,520
it fluctuates from like 4,700
or something to $50,000 a day.

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,751
And like for me,

58
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:57,991
man,

59
00:01:57,991 --> 00:01:58,290
I've,

60
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:58,590
I've,

61
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,970
I've held two of those children.

62
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:00,360
You know,

63
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,660
I've,

64
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,110
I've,

65
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,190
I've dug the grave,

66
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:03,660
I've had blisters on my hands.

67
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:08,100
I've had a little dude named Andy
Bo's blood on my hands and like,

68
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:09,900
like Bro,

69
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,733
it's,

70
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,270
it wrecks me and like that's why I'm
so passionate about this thing and like

71
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,930
I had come back and like I get it,

72
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:22,920
a bowl is terrible and we need to knock
it out because it can take out so many

73
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:23,311
people,

74
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:24,150
but why?

75
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,240
Why are people not like,

76
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,920
why don't they have their eyes open?

77
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:33,921
Their ears open their heart
open to hearing about 5,000
kids dying every day up

78
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,820
until the funeral of five other kids.

79
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,430
I've seen the grave of nine
or 10 others besides that,

80
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:39,421
like it.

81
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:41,940
These are just some of the
pygmies I've been to the.

82
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,730
I've seen the funerals going on with the,

83
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,580
of their oppressors,

84
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,000
like the slave masters and the Mokpala
than non pygmies that surround them.

85
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,760
Their kids are dying of
dirty water and it's not.

86
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,500
I don't,

87
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,460
I don't mean to go crazy,

88
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:53,941
but no,

89
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:54,840
it's not crazy at all.

90
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,240
It's that,

91
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,940
that statistic is crazy.

92
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,370
Five thousand a day a day and
they're under five years old.

93
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,750
So I mean,

94
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,130
I don't know how many with the six,

95
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:03,431
seven,

96
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:04,330
eight and nine year olds,

97
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:04,690
you know,

98
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,540
I've been to the funerals of those
kids where we are very strange,

99
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,560
but what we have,

100
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,590
what we focus our attention
on and the Ebola things,

101
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,120
just something that was over here because
we were worried about it coming over

102
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:18,010
here and we don't have
a problem over here.

103
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,510
We were,

104
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,540
it's so convenient for people to not look
at impoverished third world countries,

105
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:25,510
people that are just,

106
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,120
they've always been in this
sort of state of poverty.

107
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:30,550
So we just sort of accept
them as being like that.

108
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,100
We don't think that they necessarily,

109
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:37,450
that they have to live the way we
live or have access to clean water and

110
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:37,810
medical,

111
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,380
which is telling me,

112
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,010
think about it.

113
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,200
We worry about cecil the lion,

114
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,460
you know,

115
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,080
this the fuck comes out about cecil the
lion where everybody's going nuts and

116
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:47,711
freaking out.

117
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:47,891
Yeah,

118
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:48,521
I mean look,

119
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:49,750
poaching is terrible.

120
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,410
It's awful.

121
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,260
So the animals are beautiful and you know,

122
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,400
I get it.

123
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,550
But the way we really reacted to that,

124
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,170
to know your statistic,

125
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,230
to know that what you just said had 5,000
little kids die every day from dirty

126
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:06,460
water and people aren't
freaking out about that.

127
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,380
I think it's like every 20 seconds.

128
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,680
Who Attacks Pokemon people?

129
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:12,210
They're like the most adorable,

130
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,460
nicest people in the world.

131
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,294
But you look at that.

132
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,370
You said rural.

133
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,390
Do you not like the word world?

134
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,680
Like world?

135
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,150
Is that how you say world?

136
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,500
How do you say it?

137
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,040
W O r a l d o w e r before the.

138
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,330
Oh,

139
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,840
it rolls off the tongue easier
than going world world world.

140
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,670
World War old.

141
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,450
How do you say it?

142
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,283
World?

143
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,070
No,

144
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,440
you don't say it like that world.

145
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,360
How do you say world now?

146
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:40,200
That's the right way.

147
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,310
That's why they say no.

148
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,710
You say rural of.

149
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,950
How does he say at Jamie?

150
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,503
You say Debbie,

151
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,133
I can't even.

152
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,820
It's the best thing in the

153
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,700
world world.

154
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:54,961
Okay.

155
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,870
Keep saying it like that.

156
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:56,360
We're good.

157
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,640
No,

158
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,190
that's when I say

159
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,770
world world war now.

160
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:03,660
He doesn't even say world world.

161
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,810
World War old.

162
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,461
That's what he say.

163
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:10,020
Rural called road.

164
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,610
The best thing in the world,

165
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:11,970
the,

166
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:12,170
the,

167
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,980
the theory being the star wars program
has apparently never really effective and

168
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,700
the scientists that were
behind the star wars program,

169
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,870
a fuck load of them died by suicide,

170
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:25,830
by murder,

171
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,940
and there's a giant list of them
and it's one of the most fascinating

172
00:05:29,941 --> 00:05:33,100
conspiracies and modern time find it.

173
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:33,830
Okay.

174
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,590
Um,

175
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,760
these guys that knew the people
that knew the scientists,

176
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:40,530
the engineers dead,

177
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,850
like almost all of them,

178
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,420
they all died like murdered suicide.

179
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,470
And like very,

180
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,480
very suspicious that
someone did like a number,

181
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:48,991
like,

182
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:49,200
you know,

183
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,250
they did like a percentage.

184
00:05:50,251 --> 00:05:54,180
Like what are the odds that all these
people were murdered inside of billion to

185
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:54,660
one?

186
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:54,841
Yeah.

187
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:54,961

they knew.

189
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:56,940
They all knew that it was bullshit.

190
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,280
The Star Wars program,

191
00:05:58,281 --> 00:05:59,480
they'd spend millions,

192
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:04,481
untold billions of dollars to develop
this completely ineffective system to

193
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:07,640
shoot missiles at a sky was
never proven to work ever.

194
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,450
And those scientists are all dead as food.

195
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,313
Here it goes,

196
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,640

These scientists had been involved in the
classified star wars projects and that

207
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:41,090
the desks were in any way connected.

208
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,120
