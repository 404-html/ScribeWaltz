00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,380
Hello Freaks,
here we go again.

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,100
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is brought to you buy naturebox.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,430
Naturebox is a company that sends 
healthier snacks to your door.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,980
Now I really appreciate my message board
because every time anyone claims 

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,390
anything now people fucking crawl up 
their ass with a microscope and find out

6
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:29,121
what's cracking.
And one of the big things about 

7
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:29,121
naturebox is people go,
this stuff's not healthy.

8
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:30,480
We're not talking about Kale or grapes 
or,

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,070
or,
or blueberries.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,200
It is healthy and quite delicious.
Um,

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:36,960
I'm,
I'll tell you,

12
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:40,050
what are these things?
I'm smitten with these things.

13
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:42,930
I may get addicted.
They're sweet blueberry almonds.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,790
Oh,
they're so delicious.

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,270
I'm not sure what's in there because I 
don't have my glasses on.

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,530
I need glasses to read.
Fine print.

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,080
I thought,
why?

18
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:55,081
Why the fuck did they put fine print on 
box unpackages where they know that 

19
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,330
anyone over 12 can't read that shit.

20
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,340
All right,
that's ridiculous.

21
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,370
It puts them print on.
I know it's illegal thing they're 

22
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,760
putting print on so that you know,
like you can get away with it,

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,650
but you should,
you should have it on there.

24
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,880
Where people can fucking read.
So I asked naturebox what is,

25
00:01:10,881 --> 00:01:11,880
uh,
what's the deal,

26
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,530
is it,
is it healthy?

27
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,590
And their response was very reasonable 
and they said their products are all 

28
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,461
natural and containing much higher 
quality ingredients than the typical 

29
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:24,150
vending machine food ingredients which 
makes them healthier.

30
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:29,151
They have over 100 snacks to choose from
and if you're looking for something for 

31
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:29,850
certain dietary needs,
like wheat free,

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,800
which I,
I,

33
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,180
I'm a gluten free person because I'm 
very trendy,

34
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,810
a low sugar content,
a gluten free,

35
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:41,811
which is basically the same thing.
I don't know why they had to be 

36
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:41,811
redundant.
Uh,

37
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:45,050
they have it to,
whenever possible they also try to use 

38
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,050
non gmo food as well.

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,060
Although that's a thing about gmo.
It's not necessarily unhealthy to eat 

40
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:52,850
GMO.
It's very tricky anyway.

41
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,140
Their products are made from wholesome 
ingredients.

42
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,890
And our nutritionist approved.
They abide by strict quality standards,

43
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:03,810
no high fructose corn syrup,
no partially hydrogenated oils,

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,630
no trans fats,
no artificial sweeteners,

45
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:09,390
no artificial flavors,
no artificial colors.

46
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,000
All sounds good to me.
And like I said,

47
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,460
I've been enjoying these snacks.
They're very delicious.

48
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:19,461
It's good to have laying around things 
that you don't feel terrible about 

49
00:02:19,461 --> 00:02:20,370
eating.
And as I said,

50
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:22,710
they do have things like pretzels,
okay,

51
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:25,440
which are impossible to make healthy.
They're fucking pretzels.

52
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,630
Uh,
and that was one of the things that was 

53
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,630
brought up on our message board.
But again,

54
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,371
I appreciate you guys.
You guys are fact checking 

55
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:34,610
motherfuckers,
but check out naturebox.

56
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,100
They have some really delicious stuff.
A barbecued kettle corn,

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,390
which is really good stuff.

58
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,840
I'm a South Pacific plan team chips,
that's one another,

59
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:44,790
one of my favorites.
Zero Trans Fats,

60
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,730
zero high fructose corn syrup,
nothing artificial.

61
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,340
And with free shipping anywhere in the 
U.

62
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,250
S naturebox is busting up the vending 
machines.

63
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:58,251
Monopoly on your midday hunger.
They got rid of that dumb thing where 

64
00:02:58,251 --> 00:02:59,350
they said that they,
they're big deliver,

65
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,530
just like nature does.
They deliver for free.

66
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,970
That was something they were doing for a
while.

67
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,300
They gave that up.
So try nature box right now and get 50

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,540
squarespace,
squarespace,

75
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,810
one of my favorite podcast sponsors 
because I have many friends that have 

76
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,740
used this,
a sponsor to make their own websites and

77
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:40,741
I recently met the people that are 
responsible for this company in New 

78
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:40,741
York.

79
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:43,750
Excellent folks,
and the product is really fantastic.

80
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:48,751
For the longest time,
if you wanted to have a professional 

81
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:51,151
website,
you really had to either learn html or 

82
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:52,270
you had to hire someone to do it and it 
was a huge pain in the ass.

83
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:57,271
Squarespace offers you a very simple 
drag and drop solution that is quite 

84
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,860
excellent.
It also works on everything.

85
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:03,220
It works on ipads,
works on android phones,

86
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:05,800
it works on windows,
it works on pc.

87
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,780
They offer 24 slash seven support and 
they've even launched a logo creator.

88
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,930
If you're thinking about opening up a 
company and you want a logo,

89
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,140
they have a very simple logo creator.
We can create a clean and simple logo 

90
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,061
design yourself in minutes.
You can start an online store quite 

91
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:26,560
easily.
Not Difficult at all.

92
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,920
Brian Red Band who's not here today but 
has made dozens of websites while we've 

93
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,870
been doing shows during commercials.

94
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,370
He's actually constructed.
Oh,

95
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:37,060
that's good.
Jamie,

96
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,190
you learning from Brian said Brian's 
name.

97
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,150
You did just like him.
Um,

98
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,310
the,
the,

99
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:42,810
the,
uh,

100
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,010
drag and drop interface is super easy to
use.

101
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:50,011
You could literally make websites during
the time that it takes to do a 

102
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:50,650
commercial now,
no bullshit.

103
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,860
They also have a new health website that
will deliver a better customer 

104
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,090
experience.
And for a free child free child,

105
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,010
is that a child or as trial?
It's a hybrid of a trial and a child for

106
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,940
a free trial and 10 percent off of your 
first purchase.

107
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:11,260

108
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,010
So for 10 percent off your first

109
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:17,890

and enter the code word Joe.

110
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Another thing I like about squarespace,
they allow you to try it out before you 

111
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,040

112

So if you're thinking about making a

113
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,290
let me see what the squarespace shit is 
all about.

114

You can actually enter in,

00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:33,970
build a website and then say I liked it.
Then you put in your credit card.

117
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,890
It's a beautiful thing.
Squarespace.com.

118
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,910
Use the code word Joe.
Save yourself some money.

119
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,080
We're also brought to you by on it.com.
O n n I,

120
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:49,081
t on it is a human optimization website.
We basically sell things to allow human 

121
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:58,051
beings to reach your potential,
whether it's physically strength and 

122
00:05:58,051 --> 00:06:00,290
conditioning equipment,
whether it's cognitively,

123
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,280
which I don't think is a word through 
things like Alpha brain or new mood with

124
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:09,281
new moon is a five htp supplement if 
you've never heard of five htp five HDP 

125
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:14,330
is actually a supplement that allows 
your brain to build more Serotonin,

126
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,220
actually can enhance your mood.

127
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,440
So much so that people who are on Ssri 
eyes,

128
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:25,210
which is a serotonin uptake inhibitor,
people are on antidepressants 

129
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,060
essentially.
Um,

130
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:31,061
they tell you not to take things like 
new mood because new mood and the 

131
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:32,690
antidepressant together might actually 
give you too much.

132
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:34,670
There are Tonin,
which is not good,

133
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:40,630
but if you're interested,
go all the science behind all the 

134
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,360
supplements are available at [inaudible]
dot com,

135
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,510
whether it's Alpha brain,
whether it's new mood,

136
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,140
any of the supplements are explained 
with science.

137
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,980
And also with the research has posted 
with references.

138
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:55,400
Uh,
we recently completed a clinical test.

139
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:57,080
The first of a,
another.

140
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,240
We were in the process of doing another 
one right now.

141
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,730
A much larger one.
The first one was a pilot test.

142
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:06,050
It was 20 people a couple dropped out,
so I think we were left with 17 or 16,

143
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,920
but we had excellent results and the 
results are published at [inaudible] dot

144
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:10,250
com.

145
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,250
It's o,
n n I t these are all very expensive to 

146
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:15,250
do.
And the,

147
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,210
um,
the process of selling supplements is a 

148
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:19,880
very controversial thing because there's
a lot of bullshit out there.

149
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:25,270
I personally believe in supplements.
I've been taking supplements my whole 

150
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,270
life,
not my whole life.

151
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,400
When I was a baby,
I took nothing.

152
00:07:25,401 --> 00:07:27,920
How about that took mom's milk,
I guess as a supplement.

153
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,730
But since I knew about vitamins and 
supplementation,

154
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,870
I've always been interested in 
optimizing my health,

155
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,490
optimizing my fitness,
optimizing the way my brain functions.

156
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,310
And uh,
I've been a big fan of nootropics.

157
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:44,950
I got turned onto them by,
um,

158
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,530
by neuro one,
which is bill Roman [inaudible] company 

159
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:50,530
built Roman house if you don't know who 
he is,

160
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,451
he's a former pro football player who 
was experiencing a lot of what we're 

161
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:58,070
hearing about today in the news about 
pro football players.

162
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,740
A lot of these guys get busted up from 
football,

163
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:05,741
develop a lot of cognitive problems,
and he wanted to combat that with 

164
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:09,311
nutrition.
So he developed a product called 

165
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:09,800
[inaudible].
That was my introduction to the world of

166
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:12,480
nootropics from um,
uh,

167
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,290
Alice from Sarah and no name in San 
Francisco.

168
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,740
I got into that and then started 
researching all the various supplements 

169
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,960
before we ever created Alpha brain.
I'm Alpha brain is what I believe is the

170
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:28,961
best combination of all of the known 
ingredients that can increase cognitive 

171
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:29,450
function.
And again,

172
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,480
if you go to [inaudible] dot com,
all of the science behind all the 

173
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:34,910
various ingredients individually is 
referenced.

174
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,270
And then on top of that,
all of the,

175
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,000
uh,
the,

176
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,050
all the research that we've done and the
study that was just recently completed 

177
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,510
is also referenced.
We also have a 100 percent 30 pill,

178
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,880
90 day money back guarantee it on it.

179
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,110
We're not trying to sell any bullshit.
And we,

180
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,680
the last thing I personally want is 
anybody feeling ripped off.

181
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,900
That is also the last thing Aubrey 
wants.

182
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:02,901
Who is my partner in this?
We sell you the best shit we can find 

183
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:03,510
and we try to sell it to you at a 
reasonable rate.

184
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,850
That includes strength and conditioning 
equipment like kettle bells and battle 

185
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,171
ropes.
And that includes health and nutrition 

186
00:09:12,171 --> 00:09:15,151
things.
Supplements like a hemp protein powder 

187
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:16,770
or hemp force bars.
All of it is available on a.com.

188
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:19,440
It's o,
n n I t go there.

189
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,450
Enjoy it.
Get your freak on.

190
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,590
All Right,
ladies and gentlemen,

191
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,340
Louis Theroux is here and I'm very 
excited to talk to him.

192
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,530
So let's just get cracking

193
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,210
experience.
Joe Rogan podcasts all day.

194
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,030
Can you not hear that?

195
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,650
The headphones?
Is that what's going on there?

196
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,260
Just too loud.
Too loud.

197
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,460
Jamie.
Wants you hook them up.

198
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,580
This is probably something that we 
should do before the podcast starts.

199
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,650
Doo Doo do.
Is that better?

200
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:51,360
Is that better?
Is that beautiful?

201
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:52,890
Louis?
First of all,

202
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,200
thank you very much for doing this.
I'm a huge fan.

203
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,500
I've enjoyed your work over the years.
You have had probably one of the most 

204
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,820
unique views of Americans as an 
outsider.

205
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,450
I think possibly ever,
you know,

206
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,390
your shows are all about.
I mean,

207
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:11,391
if I wanted to think if I was like a 
conspiracy nut and I wanted to thank 

208
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:11,391
like me,
man,

209
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:14,100
this guy is probably like an,
an anti American propaganda is what he's

210
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:17,490
done is found the wackiest Americans 
ever known and,

211
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:21,390
and put them on television and shown 
just how fucked up we really can be.

212
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,780
But uh,
your shows are really excellent.

213
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,820
Thank you very much.
I don't remember which one I got turned 

214
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:29,820
onto was many,
many years ago,

215
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:29,870
but,
uh,

216
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,100
I've watched.
I went on a marathon last night.

217
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,590
Last night I watched the wrestling one,
I watched the African hunting one.

218
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,540
I watched the Indian Gurus,
one are watched the born again Christian

219
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:44,541
one.
I went on like a five hour Louis 

220
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:44,550
Marathon last night.
I lived to tell the tale.

221
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:47,040
That's a lot.
What,

222
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:52,070
what got you started in exploring all 
these bizarre human beings?

223
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,870
Oh Man.
I've always,

224
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,960
I've always had a kind of fascination 
with the dark side of human nature and 

225
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,910
with lifestyle outsiders and you know,
it goes so deep with me that I don't 

226
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,300
remember ever formulating a conscious 
decision to explore weirdness.

227
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,670
For me,
it just came naturally from,

228
00:11:13,671 --> 00:11:14,690
you know,
from when I was very,

229
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:15,590
very young.
I was,

230
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,830
I remember my dad having a things about 
the Ku Klux Klan laying around the house

231
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,410
and,
and reading them and thinking like,

232
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,470
wow,
it's so weird.

233
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:29,471
And it just sort of.
And then I used to subscribe to a 

234
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,811
magazine called the unexplained that was
all about a conspiracy theories and use 

235
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:35,060
bows and esp.
And I remember I subscribe to that.

236
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:39,770
And so it's always been part of my 
natural environment.

237
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,730
And then,
uh,

238
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,850
my dad's American.
So it felt very natural for me to come 

239
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:46,460
to America at a certain point after the 
fact,

240
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,520
after I left university.
And then once I was here I just felt 

241
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,100
like I was tuning into something 
different and strange.

242
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,580
Well,
you're a perfect guy for what you've 

243
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,790
done because you're so friendly and so 
amiable,

244
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:04,060
like when you're around these bizarre 
fucking freaks,

245
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,380
you,
you put them at ease to a certain 

246
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:09,380
extent.

247
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:09,380
Right?
Right.

248
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:09,380
And I,
and,

249
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,540
and again,
it wasn't something I sought out to do 

250
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:13,540
consciously.
I just,

251
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,370
my natural mode is to try and be 
ingratiating.

252
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,830
I mean,
I'm not a confrontational person,

253
00:12:16,831 --> 00:12:19,200
have quite a cowardly person.
I,

254
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:19,770
you know,
and I,

255
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,450
and I,
I try and avoid conflict and so I have a

256
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:26,670
natural strategy in life,
you know,

257
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:29,880
it's not something I just do on my 
programs in life.

258
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:31,530
I try to,
um,

259
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,040
get along with people and put people at 
their ease if possible.

260
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,460
At the same time,
I also have a kind of inquisitive side.

261
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:43,461
And so sometimes I get my questions 
answered by asking a difficult question 

262
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,570
politely.
You know,

263
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,760
I don't think you're a coward at all.
I mean,

264
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:53,761
I think you're being very self 
deprecating right now because you might 

265
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:55,030
avoid conflict if you could,
and,

266
00:12:55,090 --> 00:13:00,090
and I do as well,
but you're also very brave and the 

267
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:00,620
situations that you've put yourself in,
you know,

268
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,640
you,
you've thrust yourself into some very 

269
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:05,640
bizarre circumstances.

270
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:05,650
Well,
you know,

271
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,430
um,
you know,

272
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,330
maybe I'm more,
I am county,

273
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:13,340
but I'm more afraid of the consequences 
of I'm somehow not delivering on a 

274
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:19,720
creative idea than I am of the danger 
that fulfilling it involves,

275
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:24,721
if that makes sense.
So sometimes you're in a spot where the 

276
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:24,721
story,
you know,

277
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:25,720
people say you must be afraid when 
you're out on location,

278
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,670
you know,
what I'm afraid of is going home without

279
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:32,671
a story.
Like that's what keeps me awake at 

280
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:34,681
night.
Like are we actually going to get any 

281
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:37,141
usable material?
So I was in Johannesburg doing a story 

282
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:41,101
on crime in Joburg where the police are 
hugely under resourced.

283
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,640
And so a private security agencies go 
around policing the streets.

284
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:47,590
They're heavily armed,
they're accountable to no one.

285
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,190
And yet after.
So we went out to do this story and 

286
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,241
after about two weeks of being there,
we hadn't really seen any violent crime 

287
00:13:55,241 --> 00:14:00,240
and I was getting to the point of we got
to go and cause some crimes ourself if 

288
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,020
we have to,
like we got to get the story.

289
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,770
And so there was a,
I,

290
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,780
I tended to thrust myself into dangerous
situations just out of a sense of panic,

291
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,320
you know,
that we weren't kind of doing what we 

292
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:15,320
were supposed to do.

293
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,380
That's hilarious.
So essentially what's going on in South 

294
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,490
Africa is like a lot of what happened 
where was criticized the American 

295
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,141
military started using mercenaries that 
we're accountable to no one black water 

296
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:27,930
and the like.
And that was a huge,

297
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:32,931
huge issue because these folks were,
we're doing a lot of things that if 

298
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:37,010
soldiers had done them,
they would be responsible for war 

299
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,090
crimes,
but they fell into this very strange and

300
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:42,330
gray area because they were mercenaries 
because it was.

301
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:42,610
Yeah,
that's

302
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,280
a great story.
And in fact we spent a long time looking

303
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:48,080
at trying to do that story and getting 
into blackwater.

304
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,950
They rebranded themselves as something 
else now,

305
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,680
but um,
and the fact that these private citizens

306
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,800
essentially,
because they weren't servants of the 

307
00:14:59,800 --> 00:14:59,800
state,
they were,

308
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,200
um,
the citizens of private companies,

309
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,610
but they were still in Iraq,
but accountable to no government because

310
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:08,120
they could commit crimes more or less in
Iraq,

311
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:13,150
but be a go and arrested and 
unprosecuted because they were in this 

312
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,610
legal gray area.

313
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,250
They changed their name twice.
Actually.

314
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:20,230
Black water was x e dot a dot and then 
they changed the name to academy with an

315
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:23,380
I at the end of it.
So they just very strange.

316
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:28,381
Yeah.
Well I think they don't understand the 

317
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:28,381
internet,
so they probably did

318
00:15:28,381 --> 00:15:29,370
figures that may work for people.

319
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,430
Sure.
For a little bit,

320
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,450
for a bit.
For anybody who doesn't use google.

321
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:34,140
Yeah.
Sort of work.

322
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:39,170
That's what,
that's why con artists changed their 

323
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:39,170
name.

324
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:39,170
Yes.
Yes.

325
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:39,170
I mean,
it's interesting that,

326
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,871
I mean,
but this is how beautiful the Internet 

327
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:43,871
is.
I didn't remember what the name was.

328
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,651
I found out while you were in the middle
of a sentence and then by the time you 

329
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:47,651
were done,
I had the answer,

330
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:49,940
which is pretty incredible.
We live in strange times.

331
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,930
I have a friend who went to blackwater.
He was a,

332
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:55,190
uh,
he was in the marines.

333
00:15:55,191 --> 00:16:00,191
He was a sniper and then he got a job 
with blackwater and he didn't like to 

334
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:01,340
talk about any of this stuff that he 
did,

335
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:06,341
but he did it for money and he went over
and made a tremendous amount of money 

336
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,760
over.
They did more than one tour with 

337
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,810
blackwater,
but it's very disturbing that that is,

338
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:12,540
uh,
this,

339
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,740
this gray area and these words that we 
use like in surgeon and contractor.

340
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,340
Those are also disturbing.
Like contractor,

341
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,150
you know,
like,

342
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,530
Oh,
you're a contractor.

343
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,760
You're,
you're a mercenary.

344
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,060
No,
no,

345
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,080
no.
Contractor contractor to me is the guy 

346
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,080
who fixes your house,
you know,

347
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,180
a contract to me as a guy that you hire 
and he,

348
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:33,910
you know,
he builds a,

349
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,010
an addition onto your home.
It's not a fucking sniper,

350
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,150
but it's across the board as well 
because,

351
00:16:39,151 --> 00:16:40,820
you know,
I've done several stories on,

352
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,800
on prisons and there is a,
um,

353
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,410
there are private prisons as well.
And,

354
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,750
and if I could make a general 
observation,

355
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:53,751
it's that what I found in the course of 
making documentaries is that nine times 

356
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:57,381
out of 10 you get more access and more 
accountability from a public agency 

357
00:16:57,381 --> 00:17:01,311
from,
I mean I've been inside and spent weeks 

358
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,981
inside San Quentin prison and Miami jail
and a maximum security mental hospital 

359
00:17:04,781 --> 00:17:09,781
for pdf files here in California.
And all of those open their doors to us 

360
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:14,600
and I just wonder around and document 
what was going on in a way that I 

361
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,241
thought was very laudable.
I didn't agree with all the practices 

362
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:18,720
that were going on.
And yet if they're private prisons,

363
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:23,950
they,
they don't feel like opening up their 

364
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:23,950
doors they've got,
they don't feel the same sense of public

365
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,380
trust.
And that's,

366
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,130
that's just a personal observation.

367
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,160
Well,
they also,

368
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,230
they're a business and that's a real 
issue.

369
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:34,231
And anything that you say that's 
negative could negatively impact their 

370
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:38,010
bottom line.
They can make less money because of you 

371
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:38,050
and so there's no benefit in having you 
there.

372
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:43,350
Whereas the public outrage in a,
in a public institution is to have a 

373
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:44,580
real impact.
You know,

374
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,580
the public can actually vote to get 
people out of positions that are causing

375
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:49,920
certain rules to be in effect.

376
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,490
You can't really do that with private 
prisons.

377
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,420
Private prisons are,
in my opinion,

378
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:59,421
one of the most disturbing aspects of 
the current situation that we're in 

379
00:17:59,421 --> 00:18:02,520
right now because so few people are 
actually aware of what's going on.

380
00:18:02,521 --> 00:18:07,521
Most folks who have nine to five jobs 
plus whatever commute time and family,

381
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,370
they don't have the time to research any
of this stuff and they're really unaware

382
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:19,160
of what's going on that we have this 
good percentage of our prisons in this 

383
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:21,600
country,
in this country are actually businesses.

384
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,050
They're making money and even more 
disturbing.

385
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:30,290
They're lobbying to make sure that 
certain laws are in place so that they 

386
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,050
can ensure that they have more people in
their prisons and make more money.

387
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,200
It's very creepy.
Scary stuff.

388
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,080
It really is.
You.

389
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,970
You've been to the public prisons.
Yes,

390
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,600
and didn't know private prisons.
They wouldn't be here.

391
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,040
No,
no,

392
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:44,480
no.
Yeah,

393
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:45,790
we've never.
I mean it's,

394
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,890
it's.
If you can just talk into the alternate 

395
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,180
towards you,
like it's a story.

396
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:51,990
I'd be.
Oh,

397
00:18:51,991 --> 00:18:52,820
that's better.
Yeah,

398
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,860
much better.
It's a story I'd be interested in 

399
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:57,860
telling,
but uh,

400
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:57,860
we,
you know,

401
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:57,860
very Hong King.
I'm a,

402
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,820
I'm a victim of,
of,

403
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,080
of access,
you know,

404
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:03,530
I can only really tell the stories that,
um,

405
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,790
that I get inside,
you know,

406
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,080
I,
I sort of like,

407
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,150
well maybe I should.
I'm like a vampire.

408
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:10,230
I have to be invited in.

409
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,620
That's only so many a horror movies 
though.

410
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:22,130
That's my,
my issue with the recent trend of 

411
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:22,130
vampires that they just fuck around with
the rules.

412
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Like blade was the first word the 
vampires could wear sunscreen that go 

413
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,611
outside.
I remember I wanted a piece of paper up 

414
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:31,611
and threw it at my tv.
When I saw that,

415
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:31,750
I was like,
yeah,

416
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,960
I'll fight.
You can't fucking wear sunscreen.

417
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,000
You changed the rules.
Well,

418
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,950
Wesley snipes was a vampire,
right?

419
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,470
He was half vampire,
but he was a day walker.

420
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,080
He was allowed.
You have to wear sunscreen as well.

421
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:48,081
He did not.
He was allowed because he was half 

422
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:48,081
vampire.
It'd be a good guest for your show.

423
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:48,081
Yes,
he would.

424
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:49,050
Yes,
I would enjoy having.

425
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,060
Is he at?
Is he at liberty now?

426
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:53,250
He was,
he was doing time for tax evasion.

427
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,520
Um,
I wonder what he can say or what he 

428
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,160
would say if I was him,
I'd probably keep my mouth shut.

429
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,510
They locked him in a cage for several 
years and not only that,

430
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:06,390
they didn't allow him to just pay the 
money back.

431
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,320
They imprisoned him,
which is really disturbing to me because

432
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,560
if someone owes you money,
you should just have to pay that money 

433
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,260
back.
And the government is different when you

434
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:21,261
owe money to the government,
they decide that we're going to put you 

435
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:21,261
in a cage.
And he had gotten a,

436
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,850
I don't know his full story.
I've never met Wesley,

437
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:27,360
but he had gotten some really shitty 
advice from someone.

438
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,480
And if you're,
I think he was part of a religious 

439
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,241
group.
Do you know that side of the story 

440
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:35,241
called the New Orleans?
And it was,

441
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:38,500
there was some kind of Egypt to logical 
dimension to it and there's a,

442
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,700
I think there is a pyramid somewhere 
outside Atlanta and Georgia where they 

443
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,200
wish it.
Does this ring any bells with you?

444
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:51,290
Well,
I know that his is a secessionist idea 

445
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:51,290
that we don't really belong to the US 
state,

446
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,670
that we are our own sovereign in a weird
way.

447
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:59,671
It kind of aligns with certain aspects 
of the sovereign citizen movement where 

448
00:20:59,671 --> 00:21:03,331
you see yourself as not beholden to the 
federal government and an independent 

449
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:03,331
entity.
Why?

450
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:04,210
No,
he's his,

451
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,360
his production company was like almond 
raw productions.

452
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:08,950
I believe it would make sense.
Yeah.

453
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:11,410
He's got a big thing with,
uh,

454
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:16,411
with Egypt and,
but I believe his thing was 

455
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:18,460
constitutional.
His argument against taxes,

456
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,390
you know,
there's,

457
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:24,420
there's a bunch of people in this 
country that state that federal income 

458
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,980
tax is actually unconstitutional.
Exactly.

459
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,460
Yeah.
So it was for him,

460
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:31,660
it was a philosophical position.
I don't know if it was or was not.

461
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:34,830
I think it was,
but it was a ridiculous position.

462
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,650
He just can't fucking not pay taxes in 
this country,

463
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:39,190
this couch.

464
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,510
Neat.
Without a doubt,

465
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,840
this country is run by by money,
without a doubt.

466
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,550
They need money and anyone who comes 
along and fucks up that system and says,

467
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:49,450
Hey,
you know,

468
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,260
we don't have to give money.
What,

469
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,730
what,
how,

470
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,730
what percentage of the United States 
runs on taxes?

471
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:00,030
A pretty large percentage.
If someone comes along and fucks with 

472
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,391
that,
they're just going to throw you in a 

473
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:03,391
cage when it doesn't work on kind of 
ethical grounds because,

474
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:04,860
well,
if you're driving on the roads,

475
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:10,110
you're using tax dollars and on 
pragmatic grounds it doesn't work 

476
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,651
because they will send you to jail.
A pragmatic grounds of the most 

477
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:13,651
important,
the,

478
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:14,830
the ethical grounds about the roads.
There's a,

479
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:16,930
there's a large argument for that for 
sure.

480
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:22,110
But then there's also weirdness like in 
New York where it used to be that they 

481
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:27,181
set up the toll systems on the bridges 
and the tunnels and what was going to 

482
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:28,960
happen is once the bridges were paid 
off,

483
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,400
then the tolls would stop.

484
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:35,790
But the state and the city obviously got
addicted to all that money that keeps 

485
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,931
coming in from those tolls.
So even though the bridges are long 

486
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:39,940
since paid for,
they still,

487
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,030
it still costs like nine bucks every 
time you go across whatever the fuck.

488
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:48,031
It's really ridiculous.
Now when I was living there it was much 

489
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:48,031
less,
but it's,

490
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:51,900
you know,
it's a substantial amount of revenue 

491
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:51,900
that they're just not willing to give 
up.

492
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,700
So it doesn't matter if it's paid for,
the money has to keep coming in.

493
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:59,560
And then of course the money funds is 
bloated bureaucracy that keeps expanding

494
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:04,561
in order to keep itself alive.
Like any other organism that continues 

495
00:23:04,561 --> 00:23:08,431
to expand and just gets more and more 
ridiculous and needs tax money to stay 

496
00:23:08,431 --> 00:23:10,120
open.
So a guy like Wesley snipes,

497
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:12,040
it comes along and says,
I'm not paying taxes.

498
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,490
You know,
it's hard for everybody to be 

499
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:17,890
sympathetic to that because here's a guy
that makes millions of dollars,

500
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,100
doesn't want to pay taxes.
And the regular folks that have to pay 

501
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,211
taxes and make a fraction of that,
like they don't have any sympathy for a 

502
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:30,601
guy like that.
Plus he's half vampire indeed.

503
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,080
Yeah,
indeed.

504
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,760
So I don't,
I don't know what,

505
00:23:33,761 --> 00:23:35,820
uh,
with his current situations,

506
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,570
I may have a chance to meet him in 
Dallas.

507
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:42,571
Apparently there's a martial arts thing 
that is going on in Dallas.

508
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:45,770
There's a UFC event,
ultimate fighting championship event and

509
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:45,990
there's

510
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,030
also like a,
something that he may attend a,

511
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,090
I'm,
I get a chance to meet him.

512
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,970
If I get to talk to him,
I would definitely bring them on here.

513
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,740
I was supposed to fight him at one point
in time,

514
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,480
get off how we're supposed to have a 
mixed martial arts fight.

515
00:23:57,481 --> 00:23:59,990
Several years ago before he went into 
jail,

516
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,130
he,
um,

517
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,120
he owed a lot of money in taxes and a 
promoter,

518
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:07,550
one of the original promoters for the 
ultimate fighting championship.

519
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,580
Uh,
apparently he contacted them and wanted 

520
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,910
to have a mixed martial arts fight in 
order to make some money.

521
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:19,810
And they contacted me and offered me 
some ridiculous amount of money and I 

522
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:19,810
said,
yeah,

523
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,500
I'll fight that guy.
Fuck that guy for that much money.

524
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:23,720
But,
uh,

525
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,750
he changed his mind after a time went on
and I'm sure he was embroiled in legal 

526
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,521
battles and there might've been some 
chemicals involved in his decision 

527
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:33,521
making.

528
00:24:33,521 --> 00:24:33,980
So have you bought a,
I mean,

529
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:39,050
is that something you used to be a 
taekwondo champion before I was ever a 

530
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,700
standup comedian.
And uh,

531
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,460
I've done martial arts pretty much my 
whole life.

532
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,010
I've got a black belt in Brazilian 
Jujitsu,

533
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,040
black belt in taekwondo of kickbox.
I fought probably a hundred taekwondo 

534
00:24:51,861 --> 00:24:55,310
matches somewhere around there from age 
15 to 21.

535
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:59,810
That's pretty much all I did.
Since you've been a,

536
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,070
you know,
an older man,

537
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,770
have,
you know.

538
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,720
No,
it's not,

539
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,160
it's not advisable to do unless it's 
absolutely necessary.

540
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:09,980
And I wouldn't do it now if I was given 
the same offer,

541
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,200
but back then it was like five or six 
years ago.

542
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:14,720
It was a tremendous amount of money.
And he,

543
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,260
he's not a,
he doesn't know Jujitsu,

544
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,440
you know,
he doesn't have a background in that 

545
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,590
he's experienced and striking.
And if you've never experienced,

546
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:27,650
if you don't have an experience in,
in grappling,

547
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,580
a person who does have experience in 
grappling can pretty much have their way

548
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:31,970
with you.

549
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:36,970
It's very disturbing.
I found that out firsthand when I first 

550
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,680
started taking Jujitsu in 1996.
I thought I knew martial arts,

551
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:42,680
I was going to take Jujitsu and I'll get
fucking awesome at this too.

552
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:48,100
And I just got strangled and manhandled 
over and over again for years.

553
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,240
It was a long,
brutal,

554
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:53,330
painful,
humiliating process of learning.

555
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:58,570
And that's one of the things that was 
sort of exposed in the very first 

556
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,010
ultimate fighting championships.
If you don't understand grappling,

557
00:26:01,011 --> 00:26:02,960
if you don't understand Jujitsu and 
submissions,

558
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,670
you're almost helpless.
And uh,

559
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,780
that's Kinda what I was banking on.
I was banking on just kind of grabbing 

560
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:10,780
him,
choking him and I,

561
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,940
my background was standup martial arts 
was striking to.

562
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:16,340
I mean I competed and I knew he had 
never competed.

563
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,790
He was a trained martial artist who is 
apparently really good,

564
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:24,850
like in the gym.
But I thought it was probably a good 

565
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,570
idea to do.
Sounds like he got off lightly.

566
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:32,590
Who knows,
I mean anything can happen when people 

567
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:32,590
are throwing punches and kicks out each 
other.

568
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,680
It's a crazy business.
You know,

569
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:38,330
as I've been doing commentary for the 
UFC since I started,

570
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:43,331
I did a post fight interviews in 
[inaudible] 97 and I've done commentary 

571
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:43,990
since 2002.
So how

572
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:44,610
many,
many,

573
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:49,611
many years.
And I've learned along the way that 

574
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:49,950
crazy shit can happen.
People are throwing bombs at each other.

575
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:54,951
It's a.
have you ever done a show on mixed 

576
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:54,951
martial arts?
It's,

577
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:58,370
it's an interesting question because we,
it's one of the few times when knowing 

578
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:01,020
that we approach a story because it 
feels like it should be right for us and

579
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:02,910
then it doesn't pan out for whatever 
reason.

580
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:07,911
So I'm well aware of your work with the 
UFC and about three years ago we spent a

581
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,950
couple of months really trying to crack 
it as a story and then what happened was

582
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:18,951
we didn't get what we were trying to do,
mma and we and we didn't get access to 

583
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:24,210
the UFC or not good enough access.
So we will look at the second tier,

584
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:28,920
but it's quite a big drop off from the 
UFC down to the smaller leagues.

585
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,770
There was a guy we were dealing with,
cold terry,

586
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:33,000
triple cork.
I know him,

587
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,830
you know him.
He's King of the cage.

588
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:37,260
I always liked that name.
So that was why I remembered it.

589
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,410
Yeah.
Trouble cocs coc,

590
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:45,450
you know,
I wonder if we should get together with 

591
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:45,450
Jean tripplehorn ha.
But,

592
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:45,450
but I,
uh,

593
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,250
he,
he ran it.

594
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,270
I don't remember what his league was 
called.

595
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,740
Do you know what you're thinking of the 
cage?

596
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,470
King of the cage.
So we spent a bit of time with them.

597
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:57,060
They were doing a series of fights up in
northern Michigan.

598
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,670
Uh,
and it was kind of interesting,

599
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:04,671
but there was another one we would,
and part of the same shoot we looked to 

600
00:28:04,671 --> 00:28:07,830
a,
an outfit that I want to say it was cops

601
00:28:07,831 --> 00:28:10,350
versus cons or does that ring a bell?
Wow.

602
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:11,400
No,
I'm sure.

603
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,450
I'm sure it's out there though.

604
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,000
And they did.
They did felony fights as well.

605
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,020
You're aware of them,
but they'd sort of cleaned up since 

606
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,770
felony fights was very brutal,
very hardcore ex felons,

607
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,920
a really wailing on each other in in a 
way that was hard to watch teeth 

608
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,760
literally popping out.
And have you seen any of those videos?

609
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:34,770
I saw one where a guy bid a guy's face,
held the man down and bit his face.

610
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,180
It's hard.
Some of this horrible,

611
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:37,950
horrible,
really horrible.

612
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,900
The full range,
you know,

613
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:43,830
that's if you have a spectrum of fights,
that's probably the darkest,

614
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,940
but the guy in charge of it had got 
religion and he had.

615
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,010
He'd started a new outfit and he sort 
of.

616
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,860
He was.
He was in the awkward maneuver of trying

617
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:55,710
to edge away from the brutal super 
brutal,

618
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:58,890
horrible stuff into a,
into a lighter mode,

619
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,290
more acceptable,
fair but without,

620
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,930
but still kind of trying to keep his 
brand viable.

621
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:09,390
And,
and his new thing was called something 

622
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,971
like cops versus cons.
And the concept was it was law 

623
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:13,581
enforcement personnel fighting 
representatives of the criminal 

624
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:17,480
fraternity.
Does that not ring a bell is going to 

625
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:17,480
help him with Jesus.
That was his.

626
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,840
Because it was like he wants to show how
a,

627
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,860
there was some rationale,
like he wants to show how we can all be 

628
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,301
on the same team and kind of fight and 
then shake hands at the end of the day 

629
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:34,170
and there's not a big difference between
cops and the street street brawlers oh,

630
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:36,660
that sounds like a spin them.
It was a kind of a spin,

631
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:38,160
but when it got down to it,
it was.

632
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:42,190
It was nowhere near as brutal as what 
he'd doing with felony fights.

633
00:29:42,191 --> 00:29:47,191
And the reason we didn't pursue the 
story was it became clear that it was 

634
00:29:47,191 --> 00:29:50,410
actually a sport like it.
And if anything to my mind,

635
00:29:50,411 --> 00:29:54,460
and correct me if you think I'm wrong,
but less brutal than boxing,

636
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,150
that you take more punishment because 
the.

637
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,270
Because boxing bouts for so long and 
possibly because of the gloves as well,

638
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:06,540
you're getting more brain injuries 
through boxing and that compared with 

639
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,680
boxing and even maybe you know,
nfl football and stuff.

640
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,200
That was like,
it wasn't that questionable what the UFC

641
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:19,201
or the or the mma guys were doing.
They were just going out there fighting 

642
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:19,500
and then shaking hands,
hands

643
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,640
while there are certainly less animosity
between fighters and much more 

644
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,410
comradery.
In fact,

645
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,510
two men who were probably two of the 
best in the world,

646
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,470
Leo Machida and Chris Weidman who are 
going to fight for the UFC.

647
00:30:31,471 --> 00:30:36,471
Middleweight title Weidman is the 
current champion they met recently at a 

648
00:30:36,471 --> 00:30:39,540
seminar or some some convention and 
there's a photo of them together,

649
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:41,970
smiling,
holding like arm and arm.

650
00:30:41,971 --> 00:30:43,860
I mean these guys are in a couple 
months,

651
00:30:43,861 --> 00:30:48,861
they're going to try to kill each other,
but yet they're smiling and very 

652
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:52,821
friendly.
It's very common for people to be 

653
00:30:52,821 --> 00:30:54,660
friendly both before and after the 
fights and there's.

654
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:59,780
With martial arts,
the true martial art mentality is not 

655
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,620
one of thuggish nature.
It's not one of it's.

656
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,020
There's a photo of those two guys.
Those are the Weidman.

657
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:12,021
The guy on the left with the monster 
milk shirt on is the current champion 

658
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:12,660
and the other Guy Leo Machida.

659
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:17,220
The one on the right is the number one 
contender who's two amazing fighters are

660
00:31:17,221 --> 00:31:21,540
gonna fight and you see them hugging and
smiling before they're about to fight.

661
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,050
The Weidman,
who is a wrestler,

662
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:30,051
which I consider one of the very best 
martial arts and Machida is a karate 

663
00:31:30,051 --> 00:31:30,900
master,
a true martial artists.

664
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:35,901
Machida,
he really embodies what you expect from 

665
00:31:35,901 --> 00:31:39,930
a martial artist in the bowing he 
practices Cada.

666
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,450
He's very disciplined,
meditates,

667
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:44,810
and really is,
um,

668
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:50,030
what you would expect in a sort of a 
movie version of a martial arts 

669
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,000
competitor,
a martial arts master,

670
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:55,230
except he really truly is a real deal.
But I think that that attitude,

671
00:31:55,231 --> 00:32:00,231
the martial arts attitude is,
is one of the more appealing aspects of 

672
00:32:00,631 --> 00:32:03,510
fighting where it's not like a Mike 
Tyson,

673
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,330
you know,
the sort of a thuggish,

674
00:32:05,331 --> 00:32:06,660
you know,
insulting.

675
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:11,690
There's some of that in mma as well,
but it's very rare and boxing that you 

676
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,071
get someone who has the martial arts 
ideals or an ethics that sort of 

677
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:16,071
competes.

678
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,400
But when it comes down to whether or not
it's more or less dangerous,

679
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,580
it really depends upon the bouts.
And it depends upon the style that a 

680
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,270
person fights in.
Um,

681
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,160
if you look at like a floyd mayweather 
fight,

682
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,850
floyd mayweather is probably like the 
least hit boxer of all time.

683
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,180
If you wanted to argue that boxing is a 
super safe sport,

684
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,030
watch a floyd mayweather fight.
Watch how he fights,

685
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:44,140
rarely gets hit and he gets hit and hurt
much less than mixed martial arts 

686
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:47,900
fighters.
I would think that his style of fighting

687
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:50,570
is probably arguably one of the safest 
styles ever.

688
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:56,140
But would martial arts in mixed martial 
arts provide is more options when a 

689
00:32:56,181 --> 00:33:01,181
boxer gets hurt,
they're not even allowed to hold on and 

690
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:01,181
clinch.
Whereas with MMA,

691
00:33:01,181 --> 00:33:04,580
that's the number one strategy.
If you get hit and you get stunned,

692
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,760
you grab a hold of your opponent and try
to take them to the ground and fight on 

693
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:09,830
the ground and having all these 
different options,

694
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:14,300
it definitely gives you less a head 
impacts,

695
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,480
but not really much less,
you know?

696
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:19,860
I mean there's still a lot of standup 
fighting involved.

697
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:19,910
Yeah.

698
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:23,920
Is there any evidence of degenerative 
brain injury stemming from mma?

699
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,940
Most certainly.
Yeah.

700
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,280
Most certainly from long careers and 
from a lot of training,

701
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:30,140
hard training,
there's also,

702
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:35,141
um,
there's a bit of evolution going on 

703
00:33:35,141 --> 00:33:35,930
right now.
I'm in mixed martial arts as far as like

704
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:40,931
how they train,
how fighters train and there was a lack 

705
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:43,340
of knowledge and understanding about the
proper way to go about training.

706
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:48,341
In the old old days when it was first 
starting out were people would just try 

707
00:33:48,341 --> 00:33:52,451
to be as rough and tough as possible so 
they would spar in the gym at 100 

708
00:33:52,941 --> 00:33:57,941
percent.
They would basically have fights in the 

709
00:33:57,941 --> 00:33:57,941
gym.
They weren't just sparring matches,

710
00:33:57,941 --> 00:34:00,110
they were like full on fights.
Your uh,

711
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:05,130
your mic is on.
So when you do that click is making 

712
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:05,130
noise,
um,

713
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,460
the full on fights where they don't do 
that anymore.

714
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:12,461
Now it's very wise to rarely spar at 100
percent,

715
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,280
most of the time spar at a lighter,
lighter impact rate and a much more,

716
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:24,190
much more on technique and much more on 
strategy and positioning and preserve 

717
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:24,580
yourself inside,
uh,

718
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,460
inside the gym.

719
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,170
And uh,
so as I say,

720
00:34:29,171 --> 00:34:34,171
we abandoned it almost because of it's 
sense of feeling like there's the,

721
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,070
it seemed healthy and normal in a non,
you know,

722
00:34:38,071 --> 00:34:43,071
like kind of in a masculine.
So you would only go after it if it was 

723
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:44,080
a freak show,
you know,

724
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,130
with that story we needed some extra 
dimension.

725
00:34:47,131 --> 00:34:52,131
I know and I think that possibly if we'd
got to the top tier like with the UFC 

726
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:57,410
then that would,
that would have been sufficient sort of 

727
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,970
show business gloss to it to fee or,
or just a sense of stakes.

728
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,040
But the guys we will,
we were meeting,

729
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:07,041
we're all part timers.
They were guys who worked during the 

730
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:10,160
week,
it's mechanic's teacher's personal 

731
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,910
trainers and every couple of weekends 
they would fight a few bouts.

732
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,070
So it felt like a,
I mean I don't,

733
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,520
I'm not disrespecting them,
but they were,

734
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,300
they were not full time fighters and 
there was this,

735
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,560
there was missing some kind of sense of 
scale or something.

736
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:27,860
That's interesting.
So you decided to not pursue the story 

737
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,591
left that one.
We spent a few days on it and we 

738
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:30,591
thought,
well,

739
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:30,591
you know,
it might be that there's a way of coming

740
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:31,530
back to it at some point,
like I said,

741
00:35:31,531 --> 00:35:34,740
the UFC side of it seemed more 
interesting,

742
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,430
the sense of the personalities,
the ways in which intersected

743
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,770
with this multimillion dollar business 
that they were running,

744
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,080
that felt maybe more.
Um,

745
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:49,030
and we will look at,
we're trying to find back yard backyard 

746
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,030
bounce as well,
which if you remember a guy called,

747
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:51,990
there was a guy called data something.
Yes.

748
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,890
Data five thousand five thousand,
so $3,000.

749
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:59,950
Mother fucker's name was.
There was a scene in Florida have 

750
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,510
backyard mountain.
So we were going to fit into it,

751
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:02,910
but it was.
And then they call him smokers.

752
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,160
Yes.
Do they still have smokers?

753
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:07,590
Yes.
They still do like a true smoker,

754
00:36:07,591 --> 00:36:09,250
which is going to be a what?
No,

755
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,280
no gloves.
What kind of,

756
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:16,281
what is a classic smoker?
Kickboxing and boxing is where smokers 

757
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:17,780
really came from.
And what it is,

758
00:36:17,781 --> 00:36:20,310
is essentially fights that would take 
place in the gym.

759
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,650
And what they would do is wear head 
gear,

760
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:24,720
boxing gloves,
like sparring gloves,

761
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:30,050
Shin Pads,
which you don't see in a regular 

762
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:30,050
kickboxing.

763
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,310
And they would go at it essentially full
clip in front of family and friends and 

764
00:36:34,501 --> 00:36:39,501
it would be unsanctioned amateur bouts.
The problem with a lot of these smokers 

765
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:43,641
is there was oftentimes no medical care 
whatsoever and they were just,

766
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:47,010
you know,
hoping that no one got badly injured and

767
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,600
regulatory commissions frowned upon them
because they were really competitions,

768
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:56,040
but they were being labeled as non 
competitive sparring,

769
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:01,580
you know,
they were there were calling them 

770
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,021
sparring bouts.
So I've also had smokers where they had 

771
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:06,270
full mma rules with little gloves and,
and no pads at all.

772
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,520
You know,
they've done those and I'm sure they've 

773
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:11,520
had smokers where they had bare knuckle 
fights as well,

774
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,250
especially during the,
the formative days,

775
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:19,340
like from 93 on.
There was a lot of evolution in mixed 

776
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,461
martial arts.
There's a lot of things going on and 

777
00:37:22,461 --> 00:37:23,100
there was a lot of ways to skirt around 
the rules.

778
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,470
Like for the longest time it was illegal
in California.

779
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,870
And that's one of the ways king of the 
cage shine,

780
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:32,871
just because king of the cage would put 
on bouts in Indian reservations when 

781
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:33,630
they would go to these native American 
reservations.

782
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:36,600
The native American tribes could form 
their own rules.

783
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,040
And so,
uh,

784
00:37:38,041 --> 00:37:43,041
I went to see a lot of the king of the 
cage bouts in the nineties and when we 

785
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:47,111
would go see them,
they were all on native American 

786
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:50,061
reservations.
Then they also started doing a thing 

787
00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:52,821
called pancrase fights and what pancreas
fights where there was this strange 

788
00:37:52,821 --> 00:37:56,400
rule,
a loophole where you allowed to fight,

789
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:58,260
but you could,
you could slap,

790
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,260
you couldn't close your fists and punch 
to the face,

791
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,500
but you could pull your hands back and 
hit with the palms to the face and then 

792
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,180
kick full blast to the face,
kick full blast to the body.

793
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:14,360
So there was a lot of those fights going
on in the United States as well when 

794
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:18,471
there was no regulatory body for that.
It just sort of fit into some strange 

795
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:22,440
loophole.
But King of the cage is still one of 

796
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,070
those places right now where young 
fighters,

797
00:38:23,071 --> 00:38:28,071
when they're looking to get experience 
that they'll start to come up through 

798
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:28,071
that and that's still going.
And is it?

799
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:28,440
Yes.
Yeah.

800
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:33,441
I mean I just,
I don't know how many bouts that guys 

801
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:33,441
had.
Terry triple cock used to my,

802
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:34,560
my friend Bud Brotzmann is a good buddy 
of mine,

803
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:37,000
was also one of the original owners of 
that.

804
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:42,390
And he got out and um,
he became part of shark fights for 

805
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:44,260
awhile.
It was another organization,

806
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:45,740
but I don't think he does anything with 
them.

807
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:48,040
I may now,
but triple cox still going strong.

808
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:54,100
Um,
another one that we never quite figured 

809
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,671
out was um,
bare knuckle gypsy fighting it and we,

810
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,640
I don't know if you have a sort of 
documentary cold,

811
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,900
not cold.
Yes.

812
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:05,450
It's one of my favorite documentaries 
about Irish traveler families and the 

813
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:09,580
foods that go on between these families 
spending generations is the Joyce family

814
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,860
and another family.
Can't remember the name,

815
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,960
but um,
and the strange dynamic,

816
00:39:16,961 --> 00:39:19,780
it's just really weird.
Like the family,

817
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:23,530
they're very traditional that they got 
no money.

818
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,720
They were very close to the soil kind of
families and um,

819
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:33,950
that they issue these like fight videos,
like calling each other out into the 

820
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,590
fight saying like,
you come and see me and tell you,

821
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:37,370
you never instruct me access.

822
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:42,040
You have no courage.
Yeah.

823
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:47,100
And they.
And they're very secretive and we spent 

824
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,980
about three or four months trying to get
into that world.

825
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:52,990
I always found it fascinating and the 
code of honor and that and the defending

826
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:59,491
your name and the strangeness of the 
rules whereby there was all these,

827
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:02,980
this whole code of have rules about if 
you were called out,

828
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:04,900
you had to fight.
If they insulted your dad,

829
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:09,901
you have to fight.
And then the kids getting groomed into 

830
00:40:09,901 --> 00:40:12,421
it very young and,
and we could never build trust with the 

831
00:40:12,421 --> 00:40:13,000
families.
But the guy who made knuckle,

832
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,220
do you remember how he gets in with the 
families?

833
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:15,670
No,
no.

834
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:20,850
He shoot.
He gets invited to film one of their 

835
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:21,540
weddings as a videographer and so he 
films the wedding.

836
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,110
He's like,
this is really interesting.

837
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:24,370
These families,
they are wild.

838
00:40:24,371 --> 00:40:29,371
They can of drinking and fighting and 
getting married and having done one 

839
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:29,500
wedding,
he,

840
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:32,650
maybe there's another wedding and then 
he builds trust through,

841
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,810
through the access,
through the wedding videos.

842
00:40:34,811 --> 00:40:37,960
He parlays that into shooting the fight 
videos.

843
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,500
And so,
I mean,

844
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,790
I was glad someone did it,
you know,

845
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,920
uh,
it's really worth if listeners who 

846
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:46,920
haven't seen that,
we should,

847
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:46,920
should check out.

848
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,800
Yeah,
it's a fascinating,

849
00:40:47,801 --> 00:40:52,801
fascinating documentary and there's so 
many of those call out videos that are 

850
00:40:52,801 --> 00:40:56,941
available now.
They put them up on Youtube now to 

851
00:40:56,941 --> 00:40:59,941
really embarrass the person that they're
calling out instead of just a video 

852
00:40:59,941 --> 00:41:00,940
where you hand that cassette off to 
somebody else,

853
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:05,941
like in the olden days,
now they put these videos up on youtube 

854
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:07,990
and they're their damn hilarious.
They're beautiful,

855
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,950
amazing stuff.
I don't want them to stop.

856
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,720
Does that exist in,
in the states,

857
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:12,860
in this,
in the same way

858
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,880
as far as you know?
Well,

859
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,900
I'm sure there's probably a few people 
that have called people out to fights 

860
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,290
over the Internet,
like travel,

861
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:20,290
uh,
fights gypsy fight.

862
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,550
No,
it's very different.

863
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:24,190
It's very different.
That's a uniquely European thing.

864
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,630
I love it,
just the language they use,

865
00:41:28,631 --> 00:41:33,560
it's just so unique and unusual.
Ansys I also feel like that culture,

866
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:34,160
the Gypsy

867
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,910
culture,
it's,

868
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:39,020
it's probably a culture that's not going
to be around too many more generations.

869
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:44,320
It's very odd.
Like people sometimes ask me what the 

870
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,631
strangest or the most difficult story 
have ever done and one of them was 

871
00:41:46,631 --> 00:41:51,161
definitely a this gypsy one and it 
wasn't for lack of a story being at the 

872
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:56,921
story was there,
but we just couldn't figure out how to 

873
00:41:56,921 --> 00:41:56,921
get to it.
And,

874
00:41:56,921 --> 00:42:01,750
and,
and there was just no sense of you'd be 

875
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:01,750
having these conversations with the guy,
you know,

876
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,820
there was a guy who was um,
very high up in the Gypsy community and 

877
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,720
he had a number of sons and he was big 
in the fighting world and he was,

878
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,800
he was just connected in various ways,
both legal and probably not legal and,

879
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:19,180
and,
but you will have conversations with 

880
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:19,180
them and just,
you couldn't figure out what,

881
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,770
what was real and what wasn't real.
And there was a slight sense of,

882
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,230
you know,
they call non Gypsies Gorgeous.

883
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,450
That's a phrase they use scorcher 
gorgeous.

884
00:42:26,451 --> 00:42:31,451
I think it's Geo.
Our Gis or maybe I'm in the spellings 

885
00:42:31,451 --> 00:42:35,231
could vary,
but we were gorgeous and I always felt 

886
00:42:35,231 --> 00:42:35,231
that because we were gorgeous,
you know,

887
00:42:35,231 --> 00:42:37,390
non Gypsies that he,
that he is a gypsy,

888
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,240
just felt like no,
no real,

889
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:44,180
uh,
sense of needing to tell the truth to us

890
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:45,350
a lot of the time,
you know,

891
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,940
I don't,
I'm not trying to generalize.

892
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:51,941
That will be,
you're say that's true for all Gypsies 

893
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:51,941
are travelers,
but,

894
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:53,370
but for him it was like,
because we were gorgeous if felt like,

895
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:54,010
you know,
we,

896
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,070
we just didn't count.

897
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,270
Wow.
Well it makes sense.

898
00:42:57,271 --> 00:42:58,860
I mean,
what a tight knit culture.

899
00:42:58,861 --> 00:43:01,020
I mean these people are living in these 
caravans.

900
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,600
Is these a,
what do they call those?

901
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:08,620
The,
they don't call them trailers that they 

902
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:08,620
call them something else.
Oh,

903
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:08,620
well,
caravans would be,

904
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,380
it would be really cool.
They call them caravans and they uh,

905
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,920
what was that movie?
Snatch?

906
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,490
Sort of highlighted it with Brad Pitt.
But these people,

907
00:43:17,491 --> 00:43:19,050
they travel,
you know,

908
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,320
and they,
they set up shop in places and I have 

909
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,931
some friends from England and they have 
friends that live in this wealthy 

910
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:32,541
community,
the suburban community outside of 

911
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:34,971
London.
And these people apparently just moved 

912
00:43:34,971 --> 00:43:37,320
into the area,
set up their caravans,

913
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,680
set up shop,
and just started destroying the area.

914
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,400
They started putting garbage everywhere.
They started robbing people.

915
00:43:44,401 --> 00:43:45,240
They,
I mean,

916
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,400
and they can't do anything about it.
Apparently.

917
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:51,050
There's like massive protection of these
people in,

918
00:43:51,051 --> 00:43:54,210
in England and they're trying to be 
polite about it and the way they,

919
00:43:54,211 --> 00:43:57,510
uh,
they go about dealing with the situation

920
00:43:57,511 --> 00:43:59,290
and these folks that lived in these,
you know,

921
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,100
multimillion dollar estates are really 
kind of fucked.

922
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,080
Well,
it's one of these situations where,

923
00:44:05,081 --> 00:44:05,560
um,
it's,

924
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:10,670
it's very hard to find the right line 
because on the one hand we're talking 

925
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:13,390
about a community that is heavily 
discriminated against,

926
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,600
is deeply poor,
has massive dislocation in various 

927
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,410
respects,
very high rates of illiteracy,

928
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,690
of Cha children not going to school,
the children's health not being good.

929
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:27,340
Um,
and you know,

930
00:44:27,341 --> 00:44:29,470
having a massively out of work.
And then at the,

931
00:44:29,471 --> 00:44:30,160
so,
you know,

932
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:35,610
by all normal,
so barometers you'd think that's a 

933
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:36,630
community that needs help,
but also there's various social,

934
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:39,330
um,
vices that go along with that.

935
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,960
And um,
so then it's,

936
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,420
I think it's fair to say many of the,
uh,

937
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:46,440
the traveling folk are not well liked 
in,

938
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,500
in rural areas and they are.
And as a cultural thing too where they 

939
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,701
say like,
it's not in our culture to I'm a stay in

940
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:58,080
one place,
we have to rove around and we have to be

941
00:44:58,081 --> 00:45:03,081
allowed to build a house in a field 
where you're not supposed to build 

942
00:45:03,081 --> 00:45:03,081
houses.

943
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,010
So it's one of the,
it's like one of these,

944
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:10,100
you know,
they can sort of make a cultural 

945
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:10,100
argument,
say like,

946
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:10,100
you,
we're culturally,

947
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,640
you can't.
Our tradition is,

948
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:12,290
it's like,
you know,

949
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,530
it's like a native American saying like 
we have to be allowed to kill whales,

950
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,000
you know,
like,

951
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:22,010
you know,
there's these debates and there's a 

952
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:22,010
spectrum of.
And there's a point where you say like,

953
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:26,031
well,
it's your culture to mutilate female 

954
00:45:26,031 --> 00:45:28,011
genitalia,
but it's still illegal and you can't do 

955
00:45:28,011 --> 00:45:30,381
it right.
Or we say it's your culture to hunt 

956
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:30,381
whales.
Well,

957
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:32,160
we really want you to do that,
but maybe you can hunt deer instead.

958
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,460
It's our culture to,
you know,

959
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:36,280
so you've got to try and find.
It's a trick.

960
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,710
Yeah,
it's very tricky.

961
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:38,000
The,
the,

962
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:43,001
the area about the hunting whales is a 
very unique one because I believe 

963
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:45,510
there's certain inuit tribes that are 
still allowed to hunt.

964
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:50,770
Certain animals,
like sealed are allowed to hunt seals 

965
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:50,770
and whales.
I think on nails.

966
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,750
I don't know,
maybe some type of Wales.

967
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:00,170
Um,
I think in Alaska they allow certain 

968
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:02,661
inuits to hunt certain type of Wales.
I think it's a very weird area though,

969
00:46:03,871 --> 00:46:05,340
where it,
for anyone else,

970
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:08,160
it's very illegal.
Frowned upon endangered species.

971
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,230
The fact that they're intelligent 
mammals,

972
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:12,000
dolphins,
you can't,

973
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:17,330
but these people that have this long 
history of doing that somehow or 

974
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:20,991
another,
it's preserved as a cultural artifact 

975
00:46:20,991 --> 00:46:23,100
and it gets very tricky in the female 
genitalia.

976
00:46:23,101 --> 00:46:25,410
Mutilation is a very good example of 
that.

977
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,930
But my friends who are from England,
it's a horror story of these people that

978
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,560
live in this community that is besieged 
by these gypsies.

979
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,560
It's allowed to say Gypsies,
Gypsies,

980
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:38,800
like a sort of a negative term.

981
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,100
I think it's again,
like I not,

982
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,960
I'm not sure there's a show big show in 
Britain called my big fat gypsy wedding.

983
00:46:43,961 --> 00:46:47,380
So that made me think maybe it was,
maybe it's not.

984
00:46:47,381 --> 00:46:47,890
I don't know.

985
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,080
Some of them have a problem.
Well,

986
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:54,600
the Eskimos one that apparently inuits 
don't like the term Eskimo,

987
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:57,240
but yet they call themselves eskimos 
sometimes.

988
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,650
It's very tricky.
Um,

989
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,170
but the,
the,

990
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:04,530
the people that I know that have friends
that live in England,

991
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:09,531
I mean to them it's like this,
this horror story they lived in this 

992
00:47:09,531 --> 00:47:13,521
beautiful,
peaceful countryside is these elegant 

993
00:47:13,521 --> 00:47:15,030
manners,
beautiful states and multimillion dollar

994
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:20,031
properties and these people just sort of
destroyed it and now people are moving 

995
00:47:20,031 --> 00:47:24,861
out and selling their homes and it's a 
pretty devastating according to my 

996
00:47:24,861 --> 00:47:24,861
friend.

997
00:47:24,861 --> 00:47:25,600
Yeah.
So that's,

998
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:26,890
I mean,
you've got to have a law,

999
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,580
you know,
laws.

1000
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:30,100
We do need a few tools.
We certainly do.

1001
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,300
But the,
you know,

1002
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:32,340
what is,
you know,

1003
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,810
culture.
That's where things get strange.

1004
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,720
Now what do we accept a clearly,
you know,

1005
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:41,020
we moved,
we meaning North Americans,

1006
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:45,100
whoever team here from Europe and 
wherever when they migrated here,

1007
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:49,960
encroached on native American land and 
sort of changed the whole rules.

1008
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:55,350
So what are the rules the remaining and 
that's where this whole Indian 

1009
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:58,660
reservation thing comes into play here.
We allowed them to set up shop and these

1010
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:02,080
areas usually that sucked places that 
the,

1011
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:04,150
you know,
the new people didn't want it all.

1012
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:09,330
They allow,
these native Americans have these areas 

1013
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:11,341
and then they allowed them to sort of 
establish their own rules in these 

1014
00:48:11,341 --> 00:48:14,131
areas.
So then that was fine for the longest 

1015
00:48:14,131 --> 00:48:17,611
time and they just sort of lived in 
poverty until they started making 

1016
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:20,851
casinos.
Then it got really strange because then 

1017
00:48:20,851 --> 00:48:24,840
non native Americans were allowed to 
invest in these casinos and then they 

1018
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:29,071
established these crazy businesses where
they make millions and millions and 

1019
00:48:29,071 --> 00:48:30,250
millions of dollars and they allow 
gambling,

1020
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:32,560
which is frowned upon everywhere else.

1021
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,440
Again,
it's very strange.

1022
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:38,230
Very strange.
That's another one that I'd like to do a

1023
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:38,980
story on.
It didn't,

1024
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,930
didn't figure out a way of doing,
but you know,

1025
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:45,931
in talking about this,
I think what was the realization I had 

1026
00:48:45,931 --> 00:48:49,411
was in the end of the stories I do on 
about wackiness in my view or even stuff

1027
00:48:53,591 --> 00:48:58,591
that's kind of ethically dubious,
although I sometimes go into those 

1028
00:48:58,591 --> 00:49:00,410
areas,
it's more what I'm interested in is,

1029
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:04,120
is it's an angst and the and the deepest
kinds of,

1030
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:09,170
of human angst where you are facing 
issues the emotionally take you to the 

1031
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:10,570
core of your,
of your,

1032
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:14,740
of your being and your soul.
And in some cases it's,

1033
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:20,100
you know,
it could be stuff that seems kind of 

1034
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:20,100
dubious like the world.
I've done a story on brothels or I did a

1035
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:25,021
story about porn performers and it's the
strangest of taking the intimacy of the 

1036
00:49:25,021 --> 00:49:26,830
sex act and putting it on TV.

1037
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:29,320
And then in,
in other cases,

1038
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:34,350
it's stories where the angst is 
something where you're presented with a 

1039
00:49:34,350 --> 00:49:34,850
choice that is,
um,

1040
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:37,660
is,
is really through no fault of yours.

1041
00:49:37,661 --> 00:49:39,940
Like you've got a parent who's got 
dementia,

1042
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:44,770
so a serious Alzheimer's and you or a 
loved one,

1043
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:47,260
let's say your husband who you been 
married to for 50 years,

1044
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:51,700
doesn't recognize you anymore and is 
having sex at his old people's home with

1045
00:49:51,701 --> 00:49:54,700
some of the other women there are.
You still married to him?

1046
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:57,190
And we did the story about dementia.
And again,

1047
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,780
so that's not really about a choice.

1048
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,820
Old people homes,
they get down.

1049
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,630
What happens is we're in the post 
Viagara era.

1050
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:09,660
Ah,
so they can get Viagra and the old 

1051
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:09,660
people and some of the homes,

1052
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,580
as I understand it there,
I mean we didn't actually film,

1053
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,770
you know,
elderly people having sex.

1054
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:18,840
But it was clear when one of the women 
are spending time with,

1055
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:22,470
uh,
with visiting her husband of 30 years,

1056
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:27,890
whenever she visited him,
he would take one of his new 

1057
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:31,311
girlfriend's out.
They'd go out for a meal and they went 

1058
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:34,631
out as a threesome because he didn't 
remember that he was married to his 

1059
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:36,620
wife.
He thought he had a new girlfriend.

1060
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:38,380
And so,
I mean,

1061
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:43,540
but I'm just taking that as an.
So when I come to this question of why 

1062
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,380
didn't the story about the,
um,

1063
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,550
about,
about the mixed martial arts workout,

1064
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:55,180
I think it was to do with like,
there wasn't a great deal of angst 

1065
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:57,911
there.
It was kind of healthy and people just 

1066
00:50:57,911 --> 00:50:58,160
venting a little bit of male aggression.
Hm.

1067
00:50:58,550 --> 00:50:59,300
Does that make sense?

1068
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,030
Yes.
So I'm trying to give you the DNA of.

1069
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,510
We started out by talking about 
wackiness American culture,

1070
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:10,810
but the DNA for what I do is,
is much more about the fundamental 

1071
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:16,950
existential kind of the eras 
irresolvable Oh,

1072
00:51:16,951 --> 00:51:18,830
my word.
I don't know.

1073
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,920
Let's let it be a word like those sort 
of like those deep complex that we have 

1074
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,461
as human beings from which are just 
bundled into the whole package of being 

1075
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:32,120
human.
Do you find it limiting in that you have

1076
00:51:32,121 --> 00:51:34,310
to have conflict in order to have a 
story?

1077
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,590
Can you have a story where you're 
pursuing conflict and there no either.

1078
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,710
Like,
to me the conflict,

1079
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:43,740
that's what I live for.
I kinda thrive on,

1080
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:48,790
on experiencing conflict.
I'm vicariously through the medium of 

1081
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:52,490
reporting on the stories.
Like I couldn't see a story like,

1082
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:54,560
did you see this film her?
No,

1083
00:51:54,561 --> 00:51:55,730
I did not,
but I heard about it.

1084
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,910
So a lot of people love that film.
I got a lot of respect for Spike Jones,

1085
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:03,570
but I didn't get that film at all 
because there was no conflict in it.

1086
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:05,050
Uh,
it,

1087
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,660
it was just like a love story,
like a man falls in love with his,

1088
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:14,020
his operating system and then she,
she kind of evolves to a higher 

1089
00:52:15,021 --> 00:52:18,080
consciousness and a breakup,
but they're just having a lot of cozy.

1090
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:20,930
I sort of ruined it for fucking spoiled 
it man,

1091
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,420
but they kind of have a little cozy 
chats and I'm watching things like,

1092
00:52:23,421 --> 00:52:24,690
okay,
well I'm not getting,

1093
00:52:24,691 --> 00:52:26,270
I don't.
When's this going to start?

1094
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:31,840
And I think like,
it maybe I'm programmed in a different 

1095
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:35,441
way for some people because I could not 
watch that film and get white people 

1096
00:52:35,441 --> 00:52:39,250
what people were getting out of it.
So you require conflict in order to be 

1097
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:39,770
engaged?
Yes.

1098
00:52:39,771 --> 00:52:42,750
You must have it now.
Well,

1099
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:46,160
I found one of the things that I've 
found really fascinating about your show

1100
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:50,210
was the episode on Indian Gurus.
Yes.

1101
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,610
That was my favorite.
Really.

1102
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:57,670
It's just so fucking bizarre.
The American physicist was the most 

1103
00:52:58,881 --> 00:53:02,960
bizarre to me.
There was a mike that was a long time,

1104
00:53:02,961 --> 00:53:05,880
I guess Mike from California.
Um,

1105
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,700
there,
there was a Guy Swami,

1106
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,790
Swami Satchidananda,
Swamiji love those names.

1107
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,910
Yeah.
The Indians have fantastic language.

1108
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:22,210
Their names are amazing,
but there was this character who is this

1109
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:26,190
a yoga master,
spiritual

1110
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,890
leader,
whatever he is without judging.

1111
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:34,310
And there's this guy named Mike who was 
a Divo Tay who lived in this guy's 

1112
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:37,200
Ostrom,
I guess,

1113
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:42,201
and he believed that this man could 
materialize jewelry and objects and the 

1114
00:53:43,381 --> 00:53:48,381
story of him stomping his foot down and 
a 50 pound note appeared in his hand.

1115
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:51,690
Like,
this guy's a fucking physicist.

1116
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,850
That's right.
It's just so strange.

1117
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:56,190
That was a good one.
It was my favorite,

1118
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:01,220
but my,
one of my favorite moments was you 

1119
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:04,010
sitting on the edge of the bed talking 
to him and you asked him whether or not 

1120
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,000
you said try not to take this the wrong 
way,

1121
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:10,530
but did you have sadness in your life 
before you,

1122
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:12,390
before you met the sky?

1123
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,930
And He,
um,

1124
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:21,230
and he,
he took it a myths and he didn't like 

1125
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:21,690
that question.
And um,

1126
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:25,800
he said something like,
he said something like,

1127
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,500
uh,
what I,

1128
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,310
are you asking me?
I'm like,

1129
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:34,311
am I a burnout and burnout?
And this quote was fascinating because 

1130
00:54:34,311 --> 00:54:35,520
it was about fundamentalism.
Yeah.

1131
00:54:35,521 --> 00:54:37,110
He says like,
I always say that,

1132
00:54:37,111 --> 00:54:38,640
uh,
having a breakdown is the,

1133
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:43,820
is like the precursor to fundamentalism 
when I thought he was going to say that 

1134
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:44,240
he had a break.
Yeah.

1135
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:47,730
So I sort of went with the question,
like what he said,

1136
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,310
I thought like he was setting me up for 
that,

1137
00:54:50,311 --> 00:54:53,220
but he didn't see himself as a 
fundamentalist and I'm.

1138
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,870
It was a really,
it was a misunderstanding.

1139
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:59,871
I normally try and get into the 
difficult questions a little more 

1140
00:54:59,871 --> 00:55:02,010
gracefully and because I've 
misunderstood what he was saying.

1141
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:02,880
I don't think you did.

1142
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,160
I slid into it a bit.
I really don't think you did.

1143
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,290
I think he changed gears,
you think?

1144
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,570
Yeah,
I think he was sort of happened.

1145
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:12,060
Like the deep story there is that I 
spent.

1146
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,740
That was weird weekends,
days,

1147
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:16,500
which was about 10 years ago and I used 
to try and spend.

1148
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:21,740
It was like a little rule of thumb.
I'd find a contributor who I could 

1149
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:24,861
relate to the most.
Like you take something that seemed 

1150
00:55:24,861 --> 00:55:27,201
really out of whack.
Something that on the face of it you 

1151
00:55:27,201 --> 00:55:29,781
think that how could people really think
it's cool to move to Idaho and not pay 

1152
00:55:29,781 --> 00:55:31,380
taxes and think the UN is going to 
invade.

1153
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:36,410
How could people really think that an 
Indian guru is going to manifest rolex 

1154
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:41,211
watches?
They call them cities by meditating and 

1155
00:55:41,211 --> 00:55:42,390
cure cancer by jamming on a keyboard.
Right,

1156
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,240
and an old bon tempe keyboard and so.

1157
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,090
But the.
The.

1158
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,990
The technique we used was to try and 
find the most likable,

1159
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,950
reasonable seeming person who 
exemplified that belief system.

1160
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:58,130
So you was,
you take a weird subject but cost it 

1161
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:01,761
normal,
like cast it a person who's likable and 

1162
00:56:01,761 --> 00:56:04,311
relatable and Mike was the guy we 
thought and when you found that guy and 

1163
00:56:04,311 --> 00:56:04,311
say,
and I'll move it,

1164
00:56:04,311 --> 00:56:05,250
I'll spend the night with them.
It was like,

1165
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,400
it was like supposed to signal my 
commitment to the story as well.

1166
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:13,670
So in that story I spent the night at 
Mike's Ashram and um,

1167
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,040
but I,
I,

1168
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:17,220
I,
they had very thin mattresses,

1169
00:56:17,221 --> 00:56:22,221
although I later found out there were 
different thicknesses depending on how 

1170
00:56:22,221 --> 00:56:25,701
committed you were,
you would choose a thinner mattress so 

1171
00:56:25,701 --> 00:56:28,861
you can choose a thick when buying real.
I just found a thin one so I put it on 

1172
00:56:28,861 --> 00:56:32,680
and I had one of the worst nights of 
sleep in my life and I woke up the next 

1173
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,060
morning kind of groggy.
And as you are offering night's sleep,

1174
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,860
not just going to have bad tempered,
but also just my ci wasn't flowing right

1175
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:43,861
now.
Wasn't in tune with what was going on 

1176
00:56:43,861 --> 00:56:43,861
around me.
And so when he asked,

1177
00:56:43,861 --> 00:56:45,830
he said something about if you're,
you know,

1178
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:50,840
uh,
if you fundamentalists because you've 

1179
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:50,840
had a breakdown.
And I think,

1180
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:50,840
oh,
he's saying he had a breakdown.

1181
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,200
I think so did you have some sadness in 
your life?

1182
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,040
And then he,
he,

1183
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:54,210
he,

1184
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:57,290
let's play that and you can find that.
You can find that Jamie,

1185
00:56:57,291 --> 00:57:02,291
it's that video that you just showed if 
you back up about three or four minutes 

1186
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:06,311
before that find it is,
is you'll see louis getting out of bed 

1187
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:08,630
and he looks very groggy and then he 
communicates with this guy and they have

1188
00:57:08,631 --> 00:57:08,810
this

1189
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:13,850
sort of a weird breakdown.
It's also the one where I try and call 

1190
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,470
because then the guru says he's a big 
fan of siegfried and Roy or David 

1191
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:18,830
Copperfield.
He says he went to Vegas and I took that

1192
00:57:18,831 --> 00:57:23,831
as a kind of slightly very subtle coded 
possible admission that he takes an 

1193
00:57:24,531 --> 00:57:28,160
interest in magic and therefore what he 
does is it kind of conjuring.

1194
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:30,950
So I sort of,
I was trying to edge towards getting him

1195
00:57:30,951 --> 00:57:33,230
to admit that,
you know,

1196
00:57:33,231 --> 00:57:38,231
like we,
we know that you can't make a Rolex 

1197
00:57:38,231 --> 00:57:38,240
watch appear out of thin air.
Right.

1198
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:43,510
And so why not just,
let's just get that out there and admit 

1199
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:44,120
that you know,
that's what you do.

1200
00:57:44,121 --> 00:57:46,100
But he's a guru so he couldn't really 
admit it.

1201
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:47,290
Yeah.
This is a

1202
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:56,470
no,
no,

1203
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:04,290
he doesn't.
He's working on a cosmic level.

1204
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:06,360
Don't take this.
Don't take this the wrong way.

1205
00:58:06,361 --> 00:58:11,361
Mine who was there any sadness in your 
life before you came to see the Swami 

1206
00:58:11,361 --> 00:58:16,291
and committed to him?
I've always have a little saying 

1207
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:19,980
fundamentalism is the aftermath of a 
nervous breakdown when,

1208
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,350
you know,
it's a little bit of course,

1209
00:58:22,351 --> 00:58:27,351
but no.
Did you ever break come up with that 

1210
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:31,930
please?
Yeah,

1211
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:32,760
no,
I don't know.

1212
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:35,570
I like um,
you know,

1213
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:36,930
the,
you know,

1214
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,460
she pauses all this,
you know,

1215
00:58:40,461 --> 00:58:41,070
you know,
you know,

1216
00:58:41,071 --> 00:58:41,810
you know,
you know,

1217
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:48,840
then he goes down.
But I think these are all tells.

1218
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,750
I think he changed gears on you.
I really think his statement,

1219
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:54,730
his initial statement,
fundamentalism and,

1220
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,990
and you know about nervous breakdowns,
I think that's what he's really saying.

1221
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:00,280
Yeah,
I really do.

1222
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,430
And then when you confront him on it,
he realizes he's on camera.

1223
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:04,770
That's why the all the,
you know,

1224
00:59:04,771 --> 00:59:05,390
you know,
you know,

1225
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:10,500
he's thinking too much.
He's trying to come up with a way to 

1226
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:10,630
spin that story in a,
in a better light.

1227
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:13,540
He's not just free flowing,
what's going on in his mind.

1228
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,440
He's dancing around the subject trying 
to wrestle it into a more acceptable,

1229
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:18,880
palatable.
I think

1230
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,030
I created it,
but I think what I see my take it is he,

1231
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,990
he's emotionally,
you know,

1232
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:30,410
close to the surface and probably has 
been through a lot of difficult things.

1233
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:31,850
I,
I mean,

1234
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:35,450
I mean I getting dangerously close to 
kind of diagnosing him,

1235
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:36,950
uh,
in absentia.

1236
00:59:36,951 --> 00:59:38,180
But uh,
I,

1237
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:39,380
I,
and I think,

1238
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:42,020
but I also think he's trying to step 
outside it.

1239
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:44,150
He's trying to say like,
I agree with you like,

1240
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:47,780
but I'm not one of them.
Like I don't think he thinks that he did

1241
00:59:47,781 --> 00:59:48,860
have a breakdown.
Well,

1242
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:50,420
it could be bought.
He's trying to play it off.

1243
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:50,980
Yeah,
I mean,

1244
00:59:50,981 --> 00:59:53,240
I think maybe he was a lovely guy 
though.

1245
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,040
Uh,
it was from the bay area.

1246
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:55,730
I hope he's doing okay.

1247
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:57,220
Okay.
It seemed like a very nice guy,

1248
00:59:57,221 --> 00:59:59,080
which is one of the interesting aspects 
of it.

1249
00:59:59,081 --> 01:00:04,081
He also seemed fairly intelligent,
but he also claimed to be a total 

1250
01:00:04,241 --> 01:00:04,900
complete scan

1251
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,650
dick.
But look,

1252
01:00:05,651 --> 01:00:06,400
you know,
Isaac,

1253
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,220
I mean I don't want to go on a little 
lecture,

1254
01:00:08,221 --> 01:00:10,750
but Isaac Newton believed in Alchemy.
Right?

1255
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:11,560
Did he?
Yeah.

1256
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:16,730
And spent the last 20 years of his life 
having made probably the most important 

1257
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:20,440
scientific breakthroughs of all time,
the last 20 years of his life,

1258
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:25,560
kind of calculating the dimensions of 
Noah's Ark based on biblical 

1259
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,240
information.
I mean,

1260
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:31,260
just Wacko stuff and,
and believed in the philosopher's stone 

1261
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:31,260
and the idea of.
I mean,

1262
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:32,740
so the,
I,

1263
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:37,810
I'm constantly surprised and the ways in
which your rationality or what we can 

1264
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:40,930
choose to think of is rationality can 
coexist with rationality.

1265
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:46,030
Sir Isaac Newton.
Didn't he also have an issue with 

1266
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:46,030
sexuality?
I believe?

1267
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:47,400
I believe he was asexual.

1268
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:53,130
The light that he was pretty weird.
He was a pretty weird dude and then at 

1269
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:57,540
the same time it may have taken someone 
with a certain credulity or,

1270
01:00:59,371 --> 01:01:01,020
or like a willingness to believe in,
you know,

1271
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:04,250
occult forces to come up with the notion
of,

1272
01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:07,780
of gravitational pull through a vacuum 
at a distance.

1273
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:08,950
You know,
when,

1274
01:01:08,951 --> 01:01:10,600
until then,
you know,

1275
01:01:10,601 --> 01:01:13,390
they'd been grappling with science as 
mechanistic,

1276
01:01:13,391 --> 01:01:13,930
you know,
in other words,

1277
01:01:13,931 --> 01:01:17,950
don't say gravity.
Nothing explains why gravity exists.

1278
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,060
Right.
You know,

1279
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:23,080
why do objects attract one another at a 
distance through,

1280
01:01:23,081 --> 01:01:26,230
through a vacuum.
They just do like,

1281
01:01:26,231 --> 01:01:30,580
there's no prior cause before that.
So in a strange way,

1282
01:01:30,581 --> 01:01:34,510
I'm,
his mind may have been predisposed.

1283
01:01:34,511 --> 01:01:35,120
Am I going to it?

1284
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:36,060
No,
no,

1285
01:01:36,061 --> 01:01:37,860
you're not.
And I don't think there's anything.

1286
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:39,420
I mean,
obviously he's not,

1287
01:01:39,421 --> 01:01:41,370
I don't believe he's correct about 
Alchemy,

1288
01:01:41,371 --> 01:01:46,371
but I think you're dealing with a time 
when information was so limited that he 

1289
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:51,291
might have thought that he was onto 
something the same way he was on the 

1290
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:54,081
gravity.
He might have thought that there was 

1291
01:01:54,081 --> 01:01:56,220
some sort of a scientific basis to 
alchemy that he just couldn't hunt down.

1292
01:01:56,410 --> 01:01:57,070
Well,
exactly.

1293
01:01:57,071 --> 01:01:58,240
And I think that's what I'm trying to 
say,

1294
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:03,250
and at that time,
the paradigm of science in the 17th 

1295
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,761
century was that I'm all that nonsense 
that they used to believe in the Middle 

1296
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:11,370
Ages was nonsense,
that you didn't have an even 

1297
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:14,101
Aristotelian ideas of things going up 
and everything could be explained 

1298
01:02:14,101 --> 01:02:16,720
mechanistically.
It was a mechanistic that objects banged

1299
01:02:16,721 --> 01:02:18,460
into each other and that's why things 
moved.

1300
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:19,710
So

1301
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,050
it took a leap of faith to say,
you know what,

1302
01:02:22,051 --> 01:02:27,051
maybe objects move each other are 
through forces that are invisible and 

1303
01:02:27,051 --> 01:02:30,861
can't really be explained well.
It's also important to note that most 

1304
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:35,460
scientists were religious back then,
guess most scientists were Christians.

1305
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,280
It was a,
there was a or Islamic,

1306
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:42,150
um,
it was very common to be a Christian.

1307
01:02:42,151 --> 01:02:44,280
Very,
very uncommon to be an atheist.

1308
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,270
Yeah.
In fact,

1309
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:49,410
anyone espousing atheistic ideas was 
thought to be a fucking nut.

1310
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:54,740
Which is really interesting today where 
you look at the vast majority of 

1311
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:55,020
scientists,
you know,

1312
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:58,980
huge percentage of them either are 
agnostic or claim to be atheists.

1313
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:01,410
You know,
I think it would be comparable to saying

1314
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:03,420
nowadays saying I'm a pedophile,
you know,

1315
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:08,421
I think actually being an atheist in the
17th century was so outside the norm of 

1316
01:03:09,061 --> 01:03:12,060
what people considered acceptable or it 
was.

1317
01:03:12,061 --> 01:03:13,980
I mean,
I think that's the only way we could get

1318
01:03:13,981 --> 01:03:17,970
our brains around thinking you would be 
shunned.

1319
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,910
People would look at you and think like,
what is wrong with you?

1320
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:23,820
You know,
because it was just taken for granted,

1321
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:24,640
uh,
in,

1322
01:03:24,641 --> 01:03:27,090
in,
in all levels of acceptable society.

1323
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:27,940
Well,
I,

1324
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:33,060
it's really interesting just going back 
into our past just recent past,

1325
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:38,061
so we have with recordings and 
television and watching how different 

1326
01:03:38,161 --> 01:03:43,161
our culture is from today,
say from the 19 twenties and 19 

1327
01:03:43,161 --> 01:03:44,070
thirties.
Even films from the,

1328
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:45,690
you know,
the 19 forties and fifties,

1329
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,100
they're,
they very.

1330
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:52,250
So there's so much of a difference.
I'm a standup comedian and when I go 

1331
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:56,541
back and I listened to the standup 
Comedians of the 19 fifties in the 19 

1332
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:56,541
sixties,
I mean,

1333
01:03:56,541 --> 01:04:00,921
it's incredible how much different 
culture is between now and then.

1334
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:06,620
The greatest,
probably the most important comedian 

1335
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:06,620
ever is lenny.
Bruce,

1336
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:10,520
in my opinion,
but if you try to listen to Lenny Bruce 

1337
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:10,520
today,
it's really not funny.

1338
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,100
No,
it's not.

1339
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:14,070
It's not funny and it's almost blast for
me to say,

1340
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:19,430
but it's,
it's true because our culture has 

1341
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:21,840
changed so much since then that it's 
just not relevant anymore.

1342
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:24,030
The things that he's saying and the way 
he sang them,

1343
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:24,890
the,
the,

1344
01:04:24,891 --> 01:04:26,940
the humor,
the shockingness of it.

1345
01:04:26,941 --> 01:04:29,430
Then it's so normal today.

1346
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:33,090
Do you find any old,
like do you find the Marx brothers funny

1347
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:37,350
or chaplain or there's some physical 
comedy that's still pretty funny.

1348
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,200
Okay.
But if it was new it would suck.

1349
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,900
You know what I mean?
If it was released today,

1350
01:04:42,901 --> 01:04:44,960
if someone tried to release a three 
stooges movie today,

1351
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:49,990
be like,
what a piece of shit and that's a 

1352
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:49,990
person,
you know,

1353
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:51,660
I have great respect for the three 
stooges.

1354
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:52,260
Sounds crazy

1355
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:53,610
decide,
but I,

1356
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:56,160
I think that it's,
it's,

1357
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,440
it's an evidence of the references.
Our culture is just extremely different 

1358
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,211
now and I think that's one of the more 
challenging aspects of trying to look 

1359
01:05:06,851 --> 01:05:11,851
back on the 16 hundreds and trying to 
imagine what life was like trying to go 

1360
01:05:12,371 --> 01:05:17,371
back to the days when they used to have 
to put skirts on table legs because were

1361
01:05:17,411 --> 01:05:20,770
thinking that people are going to be 
sexually attracted to a table,

1362
01:05:20,771 --> 01:05:25,360
legs and piano and it's hard for people 
to imagine that that was a real thing.

1363
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:30,740
What about thinking of 100 years in the 
future and what will look back on now as

1364
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:35,460
a culturally weird that we take for 
granted?

1365
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:36,510
Oh,
there'll be so much.

1366
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,890
There'll be so much.
What would it be?

1367
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:38,460
Oh,

1368
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,850
massive amounts of contradictions that 
we have in our society.

1369
01:05:41,851 --> 01:05:44,970
I mean,
I think first of all,

1370
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:46,950
the way people dress,
be bizarre.

1371
01:05:46,951 --> 01:05:50,610
Women's high heels will be laughed at 
women's high heels.

1372
01:05:50,611 --> 01:05:52,410
Like when you see women walk around with
spikes,

1373
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:57,750
you know,
and when women love wearing stilettos 

1374
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:00,231
and pumps and all these really bizarre 
feet distorting shoewear or footwear,

1375
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:05,990
I mean,
I think that's one of the things it's 

1376
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:07,181
going to be looked back upon ties.
People look back on ties the way they 

1377
01:06:07,181 --> 01:06:08,260
looked at powdered wigs from the,
uh,

1378
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:09,840
you know,
George Washington era.

1379
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:12,710
So strange.
I mean,

1380
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:17,740
uh,
and racism was normal in the 19th 

1381
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:20,471
century.
And even someone like Lincoln who we 

1382
01:06:20,471 --> 01:06:20,960
think of as being a hero of the civil 
rights struggle,

1383
01:06:20,961 --> 01:06:22,190
you know,
freeing the slaves,

1384
01:06:22,191 --> 01:06:27,191
the emancipation proclamation made a 
number of deeply racist statements,

1385
01:06:27,770 --> 01:06:28,150
you know?

1386
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:31,020
Yeah.
The world was different.

1387
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,210
The way they looked at the world was 
very,

1388
01:06:33,211 --> 01:06:34,260
very,
very different.

1389
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:39,530
And have you followed the whole story in
Britain about show business celebrities 

1390
01:06:39,551 --> 01:06:44,551
being a accused of sex crimes based on 
behavior in the 19 seventies?

1391
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:51,010
Did I followed that whole thing about 
that one guy who was that famous talk 

1392
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,550
show host Jimmy Savile?
Yes.

1393
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:55,490
Wow.
That is fucking crazy.

1394
01:06:55,491 --> 01:07:00,491
That guy was a pedophile and apparently 
for decades and it was covered up much 

1395
01:07:01,761 --> 01:07:06,080
like the Jerry Sandusky case in America 
for a lot of folks are aware of that.

1396
01:07:06,081 --> 01:07:07,870
The Pennsylvania State,
uh,

1397
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:12,910
the guy who is a coach football coach 
who was just a massive pedophile and 

1398
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,840
they covered it up,
they covered it up so much,

1399
01:07:14,841 --> 01:07:16,670
so I don't know if you're familiar with 
that case,

1400
01:07:16,671 --> 01:07:21,671
but the DA,
the guy who was the prosecutor was 

1401
01:07:21,671 --> 01:07:23,030
trying to try to find out information.
He turned up missing.

1402
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:27,290
He turned up missing and they found his 
laptop and a river with no hard drive.

1403
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,680
They killed that fucking guy.
They killed the guy that is 

1404
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:33,050
investigating Jerry Sandusky.
Someone did.

1405
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:33,860
And he would go,
well,

1406
01:07:33,861 --> 01:07:36,080
why would someone do that when you're 
talking about a pedophile?

1407
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:41,340
But then you find out how much money the
school makes and the school makes from 

1408
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:45,581
their football program the school makes 
from people who went to that school who 

1409
01:07:45,581 --> 01:07:47,960
donate to the school.
And it's an insane amount of money.

1410
01:07:47,961 --> 01:07:51,080
It's hundreds and hundreds of millions 
of dollars.

1411
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:54,350
But did you know that I was the only 
person who,

1412
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:59,450
uh,
who lived with Jimmy savile on it's on 

1413
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,410
and off for two weeks and made a 
documentary about him?

1414
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:03,270
No,
in 2000 you could find that on,

1415
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:05,780
on Youtube.
What was that like?

1416
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:06,490
Well,
let's see.

1417
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:11,500
It's been a,
it's been a matter of a lot of soul 

1418
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:11,500
searching for me because of the,
um,

1419
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:16,190
because of the strangeness of them 
discovering that he had track record of,

1420
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,610
of apparently sexually abusing where you
that keen and excited.

1421
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:20,720
I'm like,
goodness,

1422
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:23,360
just,
he's talking and it just appears.

1423
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:29,730
Wow.
So go ahead place on the difference 

1424
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:32,330
between us.
We should be able to do something.

1425
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,860
When Louis met Jimmy,
so you,

1426
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,590
you spent two weeks with that guy?
More or less?

1427
01:08:39,591 --> 01:08:40,790
Yeah,
off and on over the,

1428
01:08:40,791 --> 01:08:45,791
over about three,
three or four months of miserable 

1429
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:45,791
Americans who were not aware of the 
story at all.

1430
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:47,630
It's not a very popular story.
Explain who he is.

1431
01:08:47,631 --> 01:08:52,631
So he,
there's no exact cultural figure in 

1432
01:08:52,631 --> 01:08:53,290
America to compare him with.
But he was mainly known as,

1433
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:58,470
as a DJ and from the late sixties,
right through to the nineties,

1434
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:04,120
he was a,
he was just on the radio a lot and then 

1435
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:08,561
he got a TV show on the back of his Dj 
career where it was called Jibo fix it 

1436
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,980
and people would call in with requests 
for special fixits,

1437
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,570
which were dreams that he would make 
come true for them.

1438
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:19,370
So kids would say I've always wanted to 
a box with a big bulk,

1439
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:20,930
you know,
meet Mohammed Ali or,

1440
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:24,890
or drive a Ferrari or um,
whatever it was,

1441
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:28,270
a dance with shorty know,
like just,

1442
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:33,460
and they would come on and he would fix 
it for them to do the things that was a 

1443
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,100
very popular mainstream TV show for 20 
years.

1444
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:39,610
And I'm all to.
Everyone in Britain knew who he was and 

1445
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:42,170
he was very,
very in his appearance was very odd.

1446
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,280
You know,
you could see him there,

1447
01:09:43,281 --> 01:09:46,430
but even more so in his younger years,
he had this helmet of hair.

1448
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:51,431
And so you,
you always looked at him and thought 

1449
01:09:51,431 --> 01:09:51,431
cottage,
he looks really hard,

1450
01:09:51,431 --> 01:09:54,320
like something not right about him.
But at the same time he became a knight,

1451
01:09:54,321 --> 01:09:57,230
he was very well as a,
the establishment.

1452
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:58,640
He,
uh,

1453
01:09:58,700 --> 01:09:59,660
became a night.
Yeah,

1454
01:09:59,661 --> 01:10:04,340
he was knighted for any raised millions 
and millions of dollars for a pounds for

1455
01:10:04,341 --> 01:10:07,790
charity.
So he like this unique cultural figure.

1456
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:12,791
And then after he died,
it turned out that he had sexually 

1457
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:13,810
assaulted a number of,
of women and um,

1458
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:17,360
many of them were under age.
So it was a women thing.

1459
01:10:17,361 --> 01:10:19,520
I thought it was boys as well.
Well,

1460
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:22,640
there's that that's been alleged and I 
don't know,

1461
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,380
you know,
with all this stuff,

1462
01:10:24,381 --> 01:10:29,381
the truth is,
it's not kind of been completely 

1463
01:10:29,381 --> 01:10:30,730
established because he hasn't been know 
he's dead.

1464
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:35,760
He can't be tried in court.
But some men have stepped forward and 

1465
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:38,420
said that they were abused by him when 
they were children.

1466
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:40,730
So it was all children,
boys and girls.

1467
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:45,770
When you say it was some of them,
some of the people who who said they 

1468
01:10:45,771 --> 01:10:50,771
were assaulted,
they said it happened when they were in 

1469
01:10:50,771 --> 01:10:50,771
their thirties,
twenties.

1470
01:10:50,771 --> 01:10:55,241
And then if he had a victim profile,
it seems to have been younger teens.

1471
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,040
Oh Wow.
Anyway,

1472
01:10:58,041 --> 01:10:59,990
so that's a whole other can of worms,
but I just,

1473
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:01,650
since you mentioned it,
I,

1474
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:04,480
I felt I should,
I should say you,

1475
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:09,550
I mentioned that had a connection.
So what was your experience when you 

1476
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:09,550
were with them for two weeks?
Well,

1477
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:14,100
there was a scene in the scene.
We should play this bit of today.

1478
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:15,740
I,
uh,

1479
01:11:15,870 --> 01:11:18,960
you,
you don't bother with anybody else,

1480
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:19,860
et cetera.
No,

1481
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:20,490
never,

1482
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:25,060
never know.
Even for like a week.

1483
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,160
Nope,
not even probation.

1484
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:31,190
So he's saying he never had a girlfriend
go me meaning he wants to fuck other 

1485
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:33,430
people and he says don't bother with 
anybody else

1486
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,800
basically.
That's what he's saying.

1487
01:11:35,950 --> 01:11:37,750
He's saying that I've never had a 
girlfriend.

1488
01:11:37,751 --> 01:11:42,751
I've only,
I've only kind of flitted from girl to 

1489
01:11:42,751 --> 01:11:44,950
go.
He says friends that are girls,

1490
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:46,840
thousands of them,
but girlfriend.

1491
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:49,000
No.
And he's like 70 there.

1492
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:50,220
Yeah.
But.

1493
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,740
So I didn't really even at that time I 
didn't.

1494
01:11:53,741 --> 01:11:54,130
I mean,
you,

1495
01:11:54,131 --> 01:11:58,660
you decoded that straight away.
At the time I wasn't really sure exactly

1496
01:11:58,661 --> 01:12:00,100
what he was saying.
Really?

1497
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:05,160
Yeah.
Because I think because like he'd been 

1498
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:08,221
so confusing and he said so many 
different things about the nature,

1499
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,560
I mean he'd been so evasive on the 
subject and if,

1500
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:12,610
uh,
but yeah,

1501
01:12:12,611 --> 01:12:17,611
absolutely.
He's saying now that he had lots of 

1502
01:12:17,611 --> 01:12:17,611
different girls who he would sleep with,

1503
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:22,720
so this,
but this line of conversation leads me 

1504
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:22,720
to believe that you were suspicious 
about him that

1505
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:26,760
knew that it was well known that,
um,

1506
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,680
let's say it was well known that it,
that his interests were unclear.

1507
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:32,820
Like in other words,
it was well known.

1508
01:12:32,821 --> 01:12:35,310
There was a mystery.
I would say that no one ever.

1509
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:37,590
If people always say like,
what are his interest?

1510
01:12:37,591 --> 01:12:41,910
I don't understand.
He's never had a girlfriend or a wife or

1511
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:44,510
you know,
maybe he's gay or maybe he is.

1512
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:47,490
Maybe he celebrate.
Maybe he's a sexual.

1513
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:52,080
And I'm.
So I knew that there was a blank spot,

1514
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:54,750
like a gray area space where,
you know,

1515
01:12:54,751 --> 01:12:55,350
his,
his,

1516
01:12:55,351 --> 01:12:58,030
he kept his sexuality kind of.
Um,

1517
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:00,870
and if you questioned him on it,
it was,

1518
01:13:00,970 --> 01:13:03,270
it was clear there was a secret.
And I didn't quite know what.

1519
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:07,350
I didn't know what the secret was and 
there were rumors of him being attracted

1520
01:13:07,351 --> 01:13:09,300
to underage,
underage girls.

1521
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,770
Was one of the rumors.

1522
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:15,860
Wow.
So this is not something that just 

1523
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:16,830
dropped after he died.
This was something that was,

1524
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:20,040
was it because of the fact that he did 
so much charitable work?

1525
01:13:20,041 --> 01:13:24,290
Was it difficult to question him because
the fact that he was knighted that

1526
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:27,090
for me,
like I never felt inhibited from,

1527
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:28,800
from asking tough questions.

1528
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:31,870
Well,
you wouldn't know that's your nature was

1529
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:33,530
culture where they.
I'll

1530
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:34,660
truly,
I think,

1531
01:13:34,661 --> 01:13:37,900
um,
what's emerging now is that there was an

1532
01:13:37,901 --> 01:13:39,970
atmosphere of,
of protection.

1533
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:45,320
I don't think there was,
there wasn't like a memo that went out 

1534
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,540
saying don't touch him.
He does a lot of work for charity.

1535
01:13:46,541 --> 01:13:51,541
But there was a,
there was an atmosphere of a feeling 

1536
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:52,190
that he was um,
uh,

1537
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:56,710
doing good works for charity and he was 
a vip.

1538
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:59,680
And you know,
I think abuse victims,

1539
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:05,740
even when it's not a celebrity,
there's a lot of pressure on them not to

1540
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:09,970
come forward due to embarrassment and a 
misplaced sense of guilt.

1541
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:12,190
And when it's a

1542
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:14,200
prominent member of,
of,

1543
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,370
of the celebrity world who's viewed as a
kind of,

1544
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:20,170
um,
uh,

1545
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:21,730
you know,
a benevolent,

1546
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:23,760
a philanthropist,
you know,

1547
01:14:23,761 --> 01:14:25,060
even more so,
yeah,

1548
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:27,070
that was the issue with Sandusky as 
well,

1549
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:32,071
that he worked in charities,
charitable organizations that helped a 

1550
01:14:32,071 --> 01:14:35,911
lot of young kids that were orphans and 
he took a lot of these young kids on 

1551
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:41,410
trips and this was apparently when he 
had sexually molested them,

1552
01:14:41,411 --> 01:14:42,610
allegedly.
What have you.

1553
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,070
I don't know if he's ever admitted to 
any of this,

1554
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:47,980
but of course he's obviously he's guilty
of something.

1555
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:53,330
Um,
but that was his thing that he had 

1556
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:56,101
helped all these kids and he was 
involved in all these charitable 

1557
01:14:56,101 --> 01:14:59,371
organizations,
but there was suspicions about him and 

1558
01:14:59,371 --> 01:15:02,230
there was stories about him for a long 
time and someone had protected him.

1559
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:07,231
And the idea is the reason why they had 
protected him was because it would take 

1560
01:15:07,231 --> 01:15:10,870
down penn state this enormous,
a money making machine.

1561
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:12,840
This huge cultural.
Uh,

1562
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,840
it was,
it was a huge business.

1563
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,870
And it was also like a big part of the 
community.

1564
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:22,490
I mean,
Penn State is this institution,

1565
01:15:22,491 --> 01:15:27,491
this,
this established institution that would 

1566
01:15:27,491 --> 01:15:29,170
be brought down by this and victims had 
come forward.

1567
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:32,310
Yes.
And gone to the police or,

1568
01:15:32,311 --> 01:15:37,311
or,
or gone to the university authorities 

1569
01:15:37,311 --> 01:15:37,311
authority.
It's a good question.

1570
01:15:37,311 --> 01:15:38,680
Um,
my friend Dom I rera is actually friends

1571
01:15:38,681 --> 01:15:39,990
with the prosecutor,
the,

1572
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:44,530
the one who chased him down at the end,
not the guy that turned up missing,

1573
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:49,690
but one of the ones who was involved at 
the very end when he did wind up getting

1574
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:50,500
prosecuted.
That guy,

1575
01:15:50,501 --> 01:15:51,700
he's amazing.
He's in jail now,

1576
01:15:51,701 --> 01:15:53,560
right?
Who Sent Dusky?

1577
01:15:53,561 --> 01:15:54,700
Yeah,
he's in jail.

1578
01:15:54,701 --> 01:15:57,820
Yeah.
The whole thing is very disgusting,

1579
01:15:57,821 --> 01:16:02,821
but it's,
it's so disturbing to think that they 

1580
01:16:02,821 --> 01:16:04,150
protected him.
Like that was the whole thing about this

1581
01:16:04,151 --> 01:16:08,830
joe paternal character who was the,
the much was the legendary coach,

1582
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:11,110
legendary coach who knew what was going 
on.

1583
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:12,280
Allegedly.
Yes.

1584
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:13,840
Yeah.
Allegedly knew,

1585
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:15,910
know,
and he took early retirement.

1586
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:18,790
He died very quickly afterwards too.
Yeah.

1587
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:23,791
I mean,
I think the news was just absolutely 

1588
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:23,791
devastating.
And when he was,

1589
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:25,210
I don't think he took early retirement.
I believe he was removed.

1590
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:30,250
I believe he was removed as a coach and 
that's when everybody went crazy.

1591
01:16:30,251 --> 01:16:35,251
I mean,
there was like riots when they removed 

1592
01:16:35,251 --> 01:16:37,021
him as the coach and then the news came 
out and then when the news came out 

1593
01:16:37,021 --> 01:16:37,900
everybody was like,
oh fuck.

1594
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:39,830
And then he died shortly afterwards and 
I,

1595
01:16:39,831 --> 01:16:44,831
I would probably safely say that a good 
reason why he died was not just old age.

1596
01:16:46,511 --> 01:16:51,511
That devastating effect of this all 
becoming public was probably just 

1597
01:16:51,511 --> 01:16:54,910
unbelievably hard to deal with.
Of course,

1598
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:59,911
you know,
not minimizing what happened to those 

1599
01:16:59,911 --> 01:16:59,911
kids is much more difficult for them to 
deal with it.

1600
01:16:59,911 --> 01:17:01,330
It's the whole thing is just totally 
disgusting,

1601
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,540
but fascinating in some sort of a 
strange,

1602
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:07,810
bizarre way that human beings are 
capable of doing something like that,

1603
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,270
that they're capable of shielding this 
monster.

1604
01:17:10,410 --> 01:17:11,580
It is.
Yeah.

1605
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,800
It really is.
And so,

1606
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:14,560
uh,
uh,

1607
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,130
but I'm curious about the fact that you 
enjoyed the,

1608
01:17:17,150 --> 01:17:19,500
the guru story.
Uh,

1609
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:20,210
I,
I,

1610
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:25,230
because I look back at that and it's not
one that I would feel is kind of one of 

1611
01:17:25,831 --> 01:17:28,740
my finest moments.
I loved it.

1612
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:34,370
I love the part where you met the woman 
who is this guy or this female guru,

1613
01:17:34,841 --> 01:17:35,530
and she hugged me

1614
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:40,810
right?
And I had a sort of transcendental 

1615
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:40,810
experience.
What happened there?

1616
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:41,560
What was that?
Um,

1617
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:43,270
it's hard to explain,
but I,

1618
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,610
you know,
sometimes I think,

1619
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,870
you know,
in a male way,

1620
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:51,530
I'm not that connected to like the 
deepest sources of my,

1621
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,580
of my emotion,
so I don't really know what it was,

1622
01:17:55,581 --> 01:18:00,080
but I do think that being hogged is a 
very simple and it's a physical act,

1623
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:00,500
but it's,
uh,

1624
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:01,550
it,
it,

1625
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:05,030
it creates all kinds of emotions inside 
of you.

1626
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:07,970
And it just sort of welled up from 
nowhere.

1627
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,000
It was just really odd.
I don't really know exactly what 

1628
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:13,000
happened.

1629
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Um,
I thought about that quite a bit after I

1630
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,741
watched it.
And one of the things that I took from 

1631
01:18:17,741 --> 01:18:20,261
it was the emotions and just the whole 
group of people waiting in line to hug 

1632
01:18:21,621 --> 01:18:26,621
someone.
The anticipation of it and the love 

1633
01:18:26,621 --> 01:18:29,471
that's in the air.
There's sort of this group minded thing 

1634
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:29,471
that's going on

1635
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:30,130
and there's a lot of music,
loud music.

1636
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:33,100
There's a lot of people around,
there's a,

1637
01:18:33,550 --> 01:18:36,610
there's a,
there's a very heightened atmosphere and

1638
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:38,680
then she gave me a sort of turbo hug 
too,

1639
01:18:38,681 --> 01:18:43,681
like she gave me the executive platinum 
card hug and I think they whispered to 

1640
01:18:43,991 --> 01:18:47,050
her like,
give this guy the works.

1641
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:54,150
And um,
so she hugged me for longer and she was 

1642
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:55,240
actually muttering things into my ear.
What was she saying?

1643
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:57,460
Not Words that I recognize,
but it was like,

1644
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:59,060
it was sort of like,
um,

1645
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,610
so it was,
is it comforting noises?

1646
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,430
That's the word.
Poon job is the word for their language,

1647
01:19:09,431 --> 01:19:09,790
right?
Well,

1648
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:14,791
there's several languages spoken Hindi 
or I'm this or there's a few others,

1649
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:16,600
too many to mention.

1650
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:21,990
I would think that just the experience 
itself of being around all those people 

1651
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:26,551
that were in this sort of dancing joyous
state in this long line to get to this 

1652
01:19:26,651 --> 01:19:31,651
woman and she probably had some sincere 
loving gesture towards everyone as well.

1653
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:38,940
I mean,
you imagine what it would be like to be 

1654
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:41,011
adored by so many people in such a large
group of people that are established 

1655
01:19:41,011 --> 01:19:43,870
there to come see you and get in line to
hug you or then you did it and.

1656
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:45,730
But you are really like movies.

1657
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,670
I was,
yeah.

1658
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:51,730
I mean I think as well I was under a lot
of pressure when I'm doing those 

1659
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:54,410
stories.
I feel very pent up and I'm aware that I

1660
01:19:54,411 --> 01:19:58,570
have one chance to kind of get the thing
that I'm trying to get and we.

1661
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:02,780
It was one of those classic things where
I was supposed to hug her the day before

1662
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:07,560
and then we took a crew break and went 
for an Indian meal and then when arrived

1663
01:20:07,561 --> 01:20:11,400
at the hugging tent that packed up and 
left and I was like,

1664
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:14,340
Oh my God,
we missed the hug and then it turned out

1665
01:20:14,341 --> 01:20:19,341
she was doing two nights.
She was doing like two dates in that 

1666
01:20:19,341 --> 01:20:20,010
city because she was on tour,
like hugging her way around India.

1667
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:21,290
So I was like,
oh,

1668
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:24,750
we're fucked out.
We can get the hug now just because like

1669
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:27,030
our crew wanted a nice meal and,
and,

1670
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:28,100
um,
uh,

1671
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:31,040
and so I got to here another night,
so it was,

1672
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,200
it was this long lead up to getting the 
hug.

1673
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,740
It's always a tightly wound coil of,
of anxiety.

1674
01:20:37,741 --> 01:20:39,690
So when I finally got there and had the 
hug,

1675
01:20:40,380 --> 01:20:43,680
it was a several levels on which I felt 
just sort of relieved.

1676
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:46,100
Wow,
that's fascinating.

1677
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,420
That's fascinating.

1678
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,420
But you know,
religions,

1679
01:20:48,421 --> 01:20:53,421
you know,
it's one of life's life's mysteries and 

1680
01:20:53,421 --> 01:20:56,661
um,
I'm trying to do a thing on scientology 

1681
01:20:56,661 --> 01:21:00,510
at the moment and that's proven quite,
quite a difficult road.

1682
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,120
Well,
religion is certainly,

1683
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:05,000
it certainly is one of life's great 
mysteries,

1684
01:21:05,001 --> 01:21:10,001
but I think there,
there's also group states have like 

1685
01:21:10,001 --> 01:21:14,101
mindedness that I find quite fascinating
and you could get them when the people.

1686
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:19,260
I was at a military base once it was a 
UFC fight for the troops and uh,

1687
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:22,610
they sang the national anthem.
It's in the middle of the Iraq war.

1688
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,830
And um,
the,

1689
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:25,790
the,
the,

1690
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:30,880
when they sang the national anthem,
the intensity and the feeling in the 

1691
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,200
air,
the patriotism,

1692
01:21:33,201 --> 01:21:33,800
the,
the,

1693
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:39,220
just the emotions involved in you're 
dealing with thousands of people in the 

1694
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:42,410
audience who have lost loved ones,
lost friends,

1695
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,190
maybe been wounded themselves,
may be taken lives themselves.

1696
01:21:46,191 --> 01:21:48,350
Many of them have shore taken lives 
themselves.

1697
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,090
And the,
the,

1698
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:55,100
the palpable,
the patriotism and the emotion and the 

1699
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,320
environment.
I am a person who was absolutely against

1700
01:21:57,470 --> 01:22:00,500
all of these wars,
whether it's the Iraq invasion,

1701
01:22:00,501 --> 01:22:01,670
the Afghanistan war.

1702
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:03,890
I thought the whole thing was about 
money.

1703
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:09,130
And the whole thing was ill advised.
I thought that the idea of going in for 

1704
01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:12,470
these supposed weapons of mass 
destruction was incredibly transparent.

1705
01:22:12,471 --> 01:22:17,471
And then I thought that the government 
and the military industrial complex was 

1706
01:22:17,471 --> 01:22:19,310
capitalizing on a horrible event in 
September 11th.

1707
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,810
And using that as an impetus to go and 
invade these countries and,

1708
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:25,470
and take over,
you know,

1709
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:30,880
resources.
But that moment when that thing was 

1710
01:22:31,101 --> 01:22:36,101
happening and that person was singing 
the national anthem was a soldier that 

1711
01:22:36,101 --> 01:22:39,470
was singing the national anthem and 
everyone was standing there proud.

1712
01:22:39,471 --> 01:22:44,420
And the energy in the air and they cheer
when it was over ready to go to war.

1713
01:22:44,810 --> 01:22:46,580
I mean,
you are ready to support the troops.

1714
01:22:46,581 --> 01:22:49,130
You're ready to not just support the 
troops but support the war.

1715
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:51,050
You're ready to,
to back them.

1716
01:22:51,051 --> 01:22:54,080
I mean,
there's this weird thing that happens.

1717
01:22:54,081 --> 01:22:57,620
These group minded sort of states that.

1718
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:01,360
So did you get into a kind of altered 
consciousness in that moment?

1719
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:05,530
I felt something for sure.
Did you feel I could have easily if I,

1720
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:05,950
if I

1721
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,830
coached myself into it or if I entertain
those thoughts,

1722
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,900
let it go.
If you'd gone with the feeling.

1723
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,900
I mean,
I was working at the time I was,

1724
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:13,660
it was,
you know,

1725
01:23:13,661 --> 01:23:17,520
I was there for the ultimate fighting 
championship and um,

1726
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:21,070
but the state of mind,
the,

1727
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:26,080
the group state was fucking intense and 
it was,

1728
01:23:26,170 --> 01:23:28,870
it was palpable.
It was tangible.

1729
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,450
It was in the air.
And you know,

1730
01:23:31,451 --> 01:23:35,950
this is coming from a person who I 
believe that it's very important to have

1731
01:23:35,951 --> 01:23:40,951
military.
I believe that there are bad people in 

1732
01:23:40,951 --> 01:23:43,201
the world.
I believe that there's sometimes no 

1733
01:23:43,201 --> 01:23:46,951
other solutions mean I don't believe in 
pacifism when you're dealing with thugs 

1734
01:23:46,951 --> 01:23:48,490
and evil people in the world.
I believe that,

1735
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:53,380
but I also believe that there's good 
people that are sent into bad situations

1736
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:58,470
for all the wrong reasons,
by people that are trying to make money 

1737
01:23:58,470 --> 01:24:00,340
in that state,
in that state,

1738
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:02,530
with being there with all those 
soldiers,

1739
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,000
being there with those people.
Man,

1740
01:24:04,001 --> 01:24:07,810
you got swept away by it.
He just carried away by this,

1741
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:13,070
this intense feeling of patriotism.
It's an indescribable because you could 

1742
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:17,731
feel the emotions of those people that 
are in that room and I wonder if that's 

1743
01:24:18,491 --> 01:24:22,090
similar to what you were experiencing 
when you were there.

1744
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:24,820
I'm sure.
I'm sure we're very close and,

1745
01:24:24,821 --> 01:24:27,100
and,
and it's not the only time when.

1746
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:33,260
I mean if the only time I think I felt 
that exact sort of emotion of sort of 

1747
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:34,780
whatever that was as a religious 
transcendence,

1748
01:24:34,781 --> 01:24:36,490
but I've,
you know,

1749
01:24:36,491 --> 01:24:38,950
there's plenty of times when you are 
around people.

1750
01:24:38,951 --> 01:24:40,420
I mean,
in a way,

1751
01:24:40,421 --> 01:24:45,421
a lot of the stories I do are about the 
altered consciousness of being exposed 

1752
01:24:45,421 --> 01:24:49,501
to people who believe things 
passionately and the slight sense of 

1753
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:52,900
Stockholm Syndrome that sets in when you
were there for prolonged periods,

1754
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:53,650
you know,
and,

1755
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:54,910
and,
and the weird,

1756
01:24:54,911 --> 01:24:57,150
um,
change the,

1757
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,320
the change in consciousness that takes 
place.

1758
01:24:59,560 --> 01:24:59,880
You know,
I,

1759
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:02,410
I did a story where I was with the 
Phelps clan,

1760
01:25:02,411 --> 01:25:04,780
the Westboro Baptist Church,
and uh,

1761
01:25:04,781 --> 01:25:08,590
I was spent three weeks with them if I 
did two different things,

1762
01:25:08,591 --> 01:25:09,690
but for the first one,
I was there for three,

1763
01:25:09,691 --> 01:25:11,710
which was called the most hated family 
in America.

1764
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:15,560
And it was really odd because when 
you're inside there,

1765
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:20,850
the little compound in their,
in their castle imbibing they're at and 

1766
01:25:20,981 --> 01:25:25,981
their doctrine round the clock,
stuff that seems really weird and 

1767
01:25:25,981 --> 01:25:29,920
hateful on the outside starts to seem 
mundane.

1768
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:35,450
You know,
you're still able to step outside of 

1769
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:35,450
their life.
I'm here to do a job and this is wrong,

1770
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:36,970
but you,
you get a nice sized,

1771
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:39,790
your mind,
your mind starts to get influenced.

1772
01:25:39,791 --> 01:25:40,810
It's really strange.

1773
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:42,390
I would imagine it is.
Um,

1774
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:47,450
I've found the Phelps won very 
fascinating because of the one guy that 

1775
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:51,150
came there to film a documentary on them
and then became one of them.

1776
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:52,500
He joined up.
Steve.

1777
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:54,000
Yeah,
he's very high up there now.

1778
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,630
Steve.
He's and his daughter left,

1779
01:25:58,430 --> 01:26:03,430
um,
a couple of years ago we went back and 

1780
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:05,661
did a followup because a couple,
the people we featured in the first one 

1781
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:08,870
then left.
But Steve almost you could argue by dint

1782
01:26:08,871 --> 01:26:13,871
of having been born outside the church 
was compensating by being even more 

1783
01:26:15,381 --> 01:26:18,290
hardcore because he was the fiercest and
the most,

1784
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:20,240
um,
in conversation.

1785
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:23,650
He was the hardest and the most,
um,

1786
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:27,350
the most abusive,
I guess most verbally

1787
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,660
full of bile.
And he also,

1788
01:26:29,661 --> 01:26:32,480
when you questioned anything that he was
saying,

1789
01:26:32,481 --> 01:26:33,980
what starting salting you.
Yeah.

1790
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:36,290
Yeah.
And aggressively insulting you.

1791
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:41,291
And I found that fascinating as well.
Wasn't just that you could have 

1792
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:41,291
questions.
It was,

1793
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:46,330
what are you fucking idiot?
It was immediately this aggressive sort 

1794
01:26:46,330 --> 01:26:46,330
of

1795
01:26:46,330 --> 01:26:50,610
told me I was the most.
I can't remember the phrase that it 

1796
01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:53,610
sounds like the most iniquitous or the 
most evil man in the history of the 

1797
01:26:53,610 --> 01:26:54,970
earth or one of the three most evil men.
He said,

1798
01:26:54,971 --> 01:26:59,971
you're right up there with punches pilot
like I was one of the three most evil 

1799
01:26:59,971 --> 01:27:02,110
men of all time,
like way beyond Hitler.

1800
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:07,770
And the reason was the reason was 
because I'd been exposed to the 

1801
01:27:08,261 --> 01:27:13,261
teaching,
so like I'd been given a special 

1802
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:16,560
opportunity like I was blessed beyond 
measure because I had been exposed for 

1803
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,301
three weeks to the pure teachings of the
only people preaching salvation on earth

1804
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,290
and having seen that and still rejected 
it,

1805
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:30,850
then that put me way beyond the Pale.

1806
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:36,160
I found it incredibly fascinating.
How effective of a guy who sucks at 

1807
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:40,840
speaking is at running a call,
like he's a terrible orator.

1808
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,150
He's not like this really charismatic

1809
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:44,170
gramps.
The main guy.

1810
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:47,650
He's very old now.
He's in his time.

1811
01:27:47,651 --> 01:27:48,820
He could.
He could do it.

1812
01:27:48,821 --> 01:27:53,821
I thought he was.
I think you're being a little unfair 

1813
01:27:53,821 --> 01:27:53,821
real.
You remember the bit where he says,

1814
01:27:53,821 --> 01:27:54,570
I'm going to eat.
You're going to eat your babies.

1815
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:56,260
Like he,
he still,

1816
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:01,320
he's very old and decrepit,
but he still cranks it up and he goes,

1817
01:28:01,871 --> 01:28:03,730
you're gonna,
eat your babies.

1818
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:05,360
See,
I don't agree.

1819
01:28:05,361 --> 01:28:08,420
I felt it was so one note,
it was like death metal.

1820
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:12,200
You can eat your baby.
I mean,

1821
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:15,020
it was just so obvious.
It's just there.

1822
01:28:15,021 --> 01:28:16,540
There's.
Who Do you like,

1823
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:19,640
you like Billy Graham?
Like what preaching style do you prefer?

1824
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,620
A Sam Kennison.
It's my favorite.

1825
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:26,780
Um,
I just think that there are people who 

1826
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:30,620
are better at it than Phelps.
Phelps is so negative and so abrasive.

1827
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:34,810
I think there's almost his.
He's so evil.

1828
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:37,390
Bill,
he starts dearly beloved.

1829
01:28:37,391 --> 01:28:41,450
He has a slow bill and then he ramps it 
up and then he get,

1830
01:28:41,470 --> 01:28:44,080
he hits his,
his kind of power chorus.

1831
01:28:44,081 --> 01:28:45,790
If you can eat your babies,

1832
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:51,160
I think there's something when someone's
unbelievably evil and aggressive where 

1833
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:55,421
you don't want them to be angry at you,
so you're willing to sort of like bend 

1834
01:28:56,631 --> 01:29:00,830
your mind to what they're saying and 
accept it and allow it in.

1835
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:03,240
And that's what I felt watching that 
guy.

1836
01:29:03,241 --> 01:29:06,390
And I've seen that in him before and in 
his speeches,

1837
01:29:06,391 --> 01:29:09,740
I've tried to sort of rationalize or 
understand what's going on when,

1838
01:29:09,741 --> 01:29:14,741
when he talks,
why would anybody gets sucked into all 

1839
01:29:14,741 --> 01:29:14,741
this evil,
hateful talk and not question it,

1840
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:19,790
but I think it's,
he's so over the top and so aggressive 

1841
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:21,230
that he's frightening to people,
like when you sat down with them.

1842
01:29:21,231 --> 01:29:21,330
And

1843
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:22,390
here's the thing,
they,

1844
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,660
I mean by and large,
they don't really make converts.

1845
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:30,690
They make a few,
but he's not trying to recruit new 

1846
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:31,090
personnel.
If anything,

1847
01:29:31,091 --> 01:29:32,950
it's the opposite.
They re,

1848
01:29:33,010 --> 01:29:35,110
they view it as a,
um,

1849
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:40,770
as a confirmation of the holy status of 
their salvation that they rejected 

1850
01:29:42,101 --> 01:29:44,680
because there's some verse somewhere in 
the Bible saying,

1851
01:29:44,681 --> 01:29:48,490
you will be hated of men and people will
throw things at you.

1852
01:29:48,491 --> 01:29:51,640
It's somewhere in the Bible.
And so every time someone says,

1853
01:29:51,641 --> 01:29:53,140
you're full of it,
you're scum.

1854
01:29:53,141 --> 01:29:55,870
We hate you.
That what they hear is,

1855
01:29:55,871 --> 01:29:56,770
yes,
we are.

1856
01:29:57,070 --> 01:29:58,810
We're saved.
So,

1857
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,370
and so when he,
um,

1858
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:05,420
and so,
like 90 percent of the people in there 

1859
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:05,500
were born into it and a family members.
And in fact,

1860
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:08,680
they lose,
they hemorrhage membership constantly.

1861
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:11,590
They kicked people out.
So when he's preaching,

1862
01:30:11,591 --> 01:30:15,730
he's not thinking,
how do I get new new followers?

1863
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:17,830
While I'm not saying that he's thinking 
that,

1864
01:30:17,831 --> 01:30:21,100
I'm wondering the effectiveness of 
retaining anyone.

1865
01:30:21,101 --> 01:30:23,370
I don't think it's even there.
I guess there is a,

1866
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:25,900
the,
the main effectiveness is that,

1867
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,450
um,
I don't know what it.

1868
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:33,570
Well,
you would know obviously much more than 

1869
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:35,701
I,
you were there for three weeks deeply 

1870
01:30:35,701 --> 01:30:37,240
embedded into that organization.
He hated me.

1871
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:42,820
GRANDPA did.
And he was one of the few times where 

1872
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:43,870
you try and do an interview with someone
who clearly can't stand you.

1873
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:46,630
And I did an.
I said something like,

1874
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,150
how can you really believe that there's 
no.

1875
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:54,220
Like,
even if you accept that what you say is 

1876
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:54,220
true,
you know that position is,

1877
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:57,720
there's no other church in the world 
that is preaching the doctrine.

1878
01:30:57,730 --> 01:30:58,900
I said,
how would you even know?

1879
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:03,910
Like there could be some tiny church in 
Nigeria that's preaching the exact same 

1880
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:04,680
message.
How would you,

1881
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:07,240
you wouldn't even know.
He goes and he says,

1882
01:31:07,241 --> 01:31:12,241
I didn't know about them.
And I asked another question you guys 

1883
01:31:12,241 --> 01:31:14,341
asked and answered and I also have 
another because asked an answer and he 

1884
01:31:14,341 --> 01:31:17,521
just kept saying Austin answered,
which is a legal term and you know,

1885
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:21,610
what do you do what you do then?
Well there's nothing you could chuck.

1886
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:24,070
He's the epitome of a close minded 
person.

1887
01:31:24,640 --> 01:31:25,390
He is

1888
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:27,950
closed minded.
Not just that,

1889
01:31:27,951 --> 01:31:32,780
but this arrogant assumption that he's 
the man with the word of God and that it

1890
01:31:32,781 --> 01:31:35,840
comes out of this angry old fuckheads 
face.

1891
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:36,610
You know,
it's,

1892
01:31:36,611 --> 01:31:41,611
it's a,
it's an amazing thing that this guy is 

1893
01:31:41,611 --> 01:31:41,870
able to put together this group.
I mean I just.

1894
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:44,780
This is the moment where you sat down 
and talked to this guy.

1895
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:45,620
You know what I mean?

1896
01:31:45,780 --> 01:31:49,110
How long have you been with him by then?
I think this was,

1897
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:50,570
I'm trying to think.
It was the end of it.

1898
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:53,580
We made three trips each of a week.
This was the second trip last day.

1899
01:31:56,430 --> 01:32:00,850
Just a little knowledge of what you just
said is stupidity

1900
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:06,150
in Spanish.
I don't know how to deal with questions 

1901
01:32:06,150 --> 01:32:06,800
like that.
Just you just took dom.

1902
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,970
Sorry,
W you're,

1903
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:12,090
you've got the duty to know the Bible as
well as I can.

1904
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:17,280
Why?
Because you are a human being because 

1905
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,580
God Almighty major and got all my is 
going to send you to hell.

1906
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:24,120
Is it accurate to say that you regard 
the Westboro Baptist church is the only 

1907
01:32:24,630 --> 01:32:29,630
biblical preaching?
Just three minutes of answering your 

1908
01:32:29,630 --> 01:32:30,530
question is yes.
No,

1909
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:32,200
it was five minutes.
Well,

1910
01:32:32,201 --> 01:32:35,350
but I already talked to them.
So there's three left.

1911
01:32:36,930 --> 01:32:40,750
He even had a laugh.
Their fucking shitty math preaching that

1912
01:32:40,751 --> 01:32:45,751
is according to the word of God.
It's been asked and answered my next 

1913
01:32:45,751 --> 01:32:48,190
question as far as your concerned.

1914
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:49,430
We got it.
Yeah.

1915
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:54,530
I mean this is angry old shitty man 
who's able to get a bunch of people to 

1916
01:32:55,711 --> 01:32:57,990
listen to him.
I finally gets his kids,

1917
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:00,780
his kids and his grandkids know how many
people were there.

1918
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:04,710
It seems like there was 20 or 30 or 90.
That's good.

1919
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,460
Yeah,
he had 11 year.

1920
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:09,750
I think I want to get this right.
I think it was like 12 kids,

1921
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:14,670
but for them had left the church and um,
and each of them had,

1922
01:33:14,671 --> 01:33:18,390
had quite a few kids,
but I think,

1923
01:33:18,391 --> 01:33:23,391
um,
I think if you're an EGOMANIAC number 

1924
01:33:23,391 --> 01:33:23,391
one,
number two,

1925
01:33:23,391 --> 01:33:28,191
if whatever reason you cleave to a 
certain kind of dogmatic religious 

1926
01:33:28,191 --> 01:33:31,360
outlook,
it's probably not that difficult to,

1927
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:32,370
to,
to run,

1928
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:35,190
to have a cult.
It's unfortunate,

1929
01:33:35,191 --> 01:33:36,870
but I think you're right,
you know,

1930
01:33:37,030 --> 01:33:38,490
shocking.
But I think you're right,

1931
01:33:38,550 --> 01:33:43,550
I've,
I've often said that all you have to do 

1932
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:43,550
is speak confidently and clearly and 
most people will be like,

1933
01:33:43,550 --> 01:33:43,850
I can't.

1934
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:44,620
Yeah.
And,

1935
01:33:44,621 --> 01:33:49,621
and have no compunction about saying 
that you speak the word of God or 

1936
01:33:49,621 --> 01:33:50,580
whatever it is.
It's really all you have to

1937
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:51,140
do,
right?

1938
01:33:51,141 --> 01:33:56,141
You have to be the guy with the answers.
You have to be the guy that absolutely 

1939
01:33:56,141 --> 01:33:57,140
not just the is like as a human,
but the answer is from above.

1940
01:33:57,890 --> 01:34:01,280
Have you read the new medicine book than
you Charles Manson Book by Jeff Gwinnett

1941
01:34:01,281 --> 01:34:02,670
came out last year?
No,

1942
01:34:02,690 --> 01:34:05,930
I try not to read anything that comes 
out about Manson A.

1943
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:07,610
Oh,
well I'll ask you why in a second,

1944
01:34:07,611 --> 01:34:09,590
but when you read it,
it's like,

1945
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:15,520
Oh my word.
You just have to be kind of come out 

1946
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:18,071
with a few kind of riddles that you've 
learned from St Pimps and people fall 

1947
01:34:18,171 --> 01:34:20,300
into your lap or so it would seem.

1948
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:24,280
You made me hate your garbage,
man.

1949
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:28,270
You people made me.
I'm your product.

1950
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:33,840
All that fucking shit.
I think that that guy's the Bob hope of 

1951
01:34:33,971 --> 01:34:35,620
serial killers,
you know,

1952
01:34:35,621 --> 01:34:40,621
because Bob hope was a comedian that 
never really made anybody that in my 

1953
01:34:40,621 --> 01:34:41,500
generation laugh.
Like we always knew him as a comedian,

1954
01:34:41,501 --> 01:34:46,030
but it's just really wasn't funny.
Manson's never scary to me.

1955
01:34:46,270 --> 01:34:49,540
Like there's some real serial killers 
that we're fucking terrifying.

1956
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:54,690
But when you think of serial killers,
it's always Manson Manson Manson is the 

1957
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:55,480
guy,
the crazy guy,

1958
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:58,400
the wild guy because he carved fucking 
swastika on his head.

1959
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:01,450
But if you mean Henry Lee Lucas,
the guy from that,

1960
01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:06,490
they made that movie about him.
Henry Portrait of a serial killer 

1961
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:08,150
allegedly killed somewhere around 60 
people.

1962
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,160
You know,
and I,

1963
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:09,350
I,

1964
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:11,050
with Manson,
the.

1965
01:35:11,051 --> 01:35:14,170
I think the reason people are fascinated
with medicine is because he didn't kill,

1966
01:35:14,230 --> 01:35:19,230
right?
He got other people too because he got 

1967
01:35:19,230 --> 01:35:19,230
the children that he,
uh,

1968
01:35:19,230 --> 01:35:21,760
he sent them out.
Tex Watson was as big killer,

1969
01:35:21,761 --> 01:35:26,761
right?
Become a born again Christian and I 

1970
01:35:26,761 --> 01:35:28,780
think he writes children's books or 
something fucking creepy

1971
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:29,720
that.
And you know,

1972
01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:32,140
a number of them still believe,
you know,

1973
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34,410
that trial is that Charlie's still.

1974
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:36,740
Yeah,
of course.

1975
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:40,420
Otherwise they're idiots.
Then they're fucked up and you know,

1976
01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:42,320
well,
what he did,

1977
01:35:42,321 --> 01:35:45,820
what they did do to Sharon tate,
tate labianca murders,

1978
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:50,960
fucking unbelievably horrific and caught
a baby out of her body and a lot all 

1979
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:53,570
over the walls.
And it was all really,

1980
01:35:53,571 --> 01:35:55,010
really terrifying shit.
I mean,

1981
01:35:55,011 --> 01:35:59,150
don't get me wrong,
but there's been a series of really,

1982
01:35:59,151 --> 01:36:04,151
really evil people that almost no one 
knows about and it's bizarre what 

1983
01:36:04,151 --> 01:36:07,460
becomes popular,
what becomes famous in the world of evil

1984
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:10,310
people you know.
And sometimes it's just a name,

1985
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:12,350
you know,
Manson,

1986
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:14,200
you know,
and everybody remembers that name.

1987
01:36:14,230 --> 01:36:19,230
They,
they're too lazy to kind of investigate 

1988
01:36:19,230 --> 01:36:19,550
and find out about other names.
But there's been a,

1989
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:24,580
you know,
so many God damn serial killers in this 

1990
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:27,131
country or have been.
It's bizarre that that one guy gets so 

1991
01:36:27,131 --> 01:36:27,140
much ink.

1992
01:36:28,870 --> 01:36:33,870
Yeah.
Well Geraldo can take his share of 

1993
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:33,870
responsibility because for all those 
fault.

1994
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,850
Well he did a number of landmark 
interviews in the,

1995
01:36:36,910 --> 01:36:38,920
I guess in the seventies or the early 
eighties.

1996
01:36:38,950 --> 01:36:43,120
You can see them on youtube where he 
sort of turned him into a celebrity.

1997
01:36:43,121 --> 01:36:43,860
I mean,
I guess the,

1998
01:36:43,910 --> 01:36:46,480
the,
the cases were big at the time,

1999
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:50,470
but then he,
Geraldo did some shows.

2000
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:55,471
I think Diane Sawyer might've done an 
interview and then they passed laws to 

2001
01:36:55,471 --> 01:36:59,341
say that you couldn't basically,
you couldn't interview Charles Manson 

2002
01:36:59,341 --> 01:36:59,341
anymore.

2003
01:36:59,341 --> 01:37:00,530
It's fascinating to see what Geraldo has
become.

2004
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:05,950
Did you know that Geraldo was like a 
counterculture figure at one time 

2005
01:37:05,950 --> 01:37:08,030
Geraldo was the guy who introduced the 
world to the Zapruder film.

2006
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:13,390
He had Dick Gregory on his television 
show and he showed the world as uproot 

2007
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:17,420
or film essentially establishing the 
idea that it was more than one person or

2008
01:37:17,421 --> 01:37:20,660
someone else other than Lee Harvey 
Oswald that killed Kennedy.

2009
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:24,740
Now he's on Fox News.
And what happened to Dick Gregory?

2010
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:27,170
Dick Gregory is still around.
He's,

2011
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,540
you know,
he's not really a comedian anymore.

2012
01:37:29,541 --> 01:37:34,541
I think he does some shows,
but he's more of an activist and he's a 

2013
01:37:34,541 --> 01:37:35,240
very,
very old now.

2014
01:37:35,241 --> 01:37:40,241
But I saw something recently with Dick 
Gregory sitting down with Paul Mooney 

2015
01:37:40,241 --> 01:37:40,241
who is a,
um,

2016
01:37:40,241 --> 01:37:44,590
a great old comedian from Los Angeles 
who was a writer for Richard Pryor and 

2017
01:37:44,691 --> 01:37:49,691
just a great comedian.
And the two of them were sitting around 

2018
01:37:49,691 --> 01:37:50,090
talking about racism and culture.

2019
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:53,190
Some of his jokes back in the day were 
pretty good.

2020
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:55,410
Very good.
Dick Gregory was very good,

2021
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:55,980
but he was

2022
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,410
also not just a comedian,
you know,

2023
01:37:58,411 --> 01:38:03,411
he was an activist.
He was the guy who somehow or another 

2024
01:38:03,411 --> 01:38:05,961
got ahold of the Zapruder film.
The zapruder film was made obviously in 

2025
01:38:05,961 --> 01:38:08,850
1963 when Kennedy was assassinated,
but it was put on.

2026
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,520
It was bought by time life magazine,
I believe,

2027
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:15,360
by whoever owns life magazine or time at
the time.

2028
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:19,800
And they just put it on shelf for,
for years.

2029
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,370
And 19 seventies is when Geraldo had it 
on a show.

2030
01:38:23,670 --> 01:38:27,390
So before that it had never been ed 
never.

2031
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:30,990
They just made a TV show about it.
I think about the router family.

2032
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:32,310
Yeah.
I think.

2033
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:35,870
Look at this,
look at the way they're dressed.

2034
01:38:35,890 --> 01:38:38,410
Right.
Straight out that if you 75.

2035
01:38:38,411 --> 01:38:40,330
So think about that.
Eight years later,

2036
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:44,860
a crazy little queasy then don't watch 
this film.

2037
01:38:44,890 --> 01:38:48,160
Just put on the uh,
the late night movie,

2038
01:38:48,270 --> 01:38:51,850
uh,
because this is a very heavy.

2039
01:38:51,851 --> 01:38:55,150
It's the film shot by the Dallas dress 
manufacturer.

2040
01:38:55,240 --> 01:39:00,240
70 five Zapruder and it's the execution 
of President Kennedy Way.

2041
01:39:01,210 --> 01:39:06,210
Geraldo has a mustache.
What we're seeing as we show this film 

2042
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:09,450
bruter film.
Okay.

2043
01:39:09,451 --> 01:39:12,240
So the cars are coming along now into 
dealey plaza.

2044
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:17,390
Yes.
These are the lead motorcycles in the 

2045
01:39:17,390 --> 01:39:17,390
motorcade.
All right.

2046
01:39:17,390 --> 01:39:19,530
Now with the president and Mrs Kennedy 
is also governor connally right now.

2047
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:24,560
Before he goes behind the sign,
the president is waving to the crowd 

2048
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:24,900
when it comes out from behind the sign,
he is shot.

2049
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:26,340
Then governor connally,
his shot.

2050
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:28,200
He's already been hit.
He's already been hit.

2051
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:32,350
And now at the bottom of the screen,
the head shot,

2052
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:37,290
that's the shot that blew off his head.
It's the most horrifying thing I've ever

2053
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:42,291
seen in the movies.
Now the Warren Commission said that all 

2054
01:39:42,291 --> 01:39:43,020
of the shots were fired from behind by 
Lee Harvey Oswald alone,

2055
01:39:43,021 --> 01:39:48,021
assassin firing at the president.
And then she could see clearly the head 

2056
01:39:48,021 --> 01:39:52,881
is thrown violently backwards,
can completely consistent with the shot 

2057
01:39:52,881 --> 01:39:53,100
from the front.
Right now,

2058
01:39:53,101 --> 01:39:58,101
this is an extreme blob of just the 
president from the film coming out 

2059
01:39:58,891 --> 01:40:03,891
behind the sign.
He shot his head from the sit here in 

2060
01:40:03,891 --> 01:40:06,290
the front from the front.
Now Jackie doesn't realize what's 

2061
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:06,960
happened yet.
She goes to his aid

2062
01:40:07,690 --> 01:40:08,260
and now

2063
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:14,430
he's said again,
the violent backward motion.

2064
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:20,000
I've never seen that before with really 
never seen this uprooted from a,

2065
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:22,980
just like the bits they showed in jfk,
you know,

2066
01:40:22,981 --> 01:40:24,580
the Oliver Stone Film.
Uh,

2067
01:40:24,850 --> 01:40:26,490
I'd never,
I'd never seen.

2068
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,340
I don't think they showed that bit.
I don't know.

2069
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,360
I mean,
it's,

2070
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,010
it's pretty common.
It's,

2071
01:40:32,170 --> 01:40:33,190
it's available.
I mean,

2072
01:40:33,210 --> 01:40:35,790
they've broken it down.
It's been enhanced.

2073
01:40:35,791 --> 01:40:38,450
There's a variety that you believe in.
The,

2074
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:39,660
uh,
there were two gunman.

2075
01:40:39,870 --> 01:40:41,220
I think there was probably more than 
two.

2076
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:42,300
Garmin.
Yeah,

2077
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:44,190
I think,
but I don't think.

2078
01:40:44,230 --> 01:40:47,120
I don't think it's an either or was one 
of the Woody Harrelson's dad.

2079
01:40:47,150 --> 01:40:48,780
It very well could have been.
Yeah.

2080
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,010
Yeah.
Isn't that fascinating?

2081
01:40:50,240 --> 01:40:55,240
Well,
I don't think it was an either or 

2082
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:55,240
because everybody wants to say that he 
was either

2083
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,640
Lee Harvey Oswald or it was other 
people.

2084
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:00,550
It could have been Lee Harvey Oswald and
other people,

2085
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:05,580
and that's.
I don't understand why people have to 

2086
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:07,831
have everything black and white and 
everyone's Lee Harvey Oswald acted 

2087
01:41:07,831 --> 01:41:07,831
alone.
Like,

2088
01:41:07,831 --> 01:41:08,670
why do you think that?
Why do you think that?

2089
01:41:08,671 --> 01:41:10,720
Like why would anybody think that he 
acted alone?

2090
01:41:10,721 --> 01:41:13,870
If you look at all the injuries that 
Kennedy was Bonnie,

2091
01:41:13,930 --> 01:41:15,520
first of all,
the shot in the neck.

2092
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:18,280
It's an entry wound in Bethesda,
Maryland.

2093
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:21,490
They called it a tracheotomy,
but in Dallas,

2094
01:41:21,491 --> 01:41:26,491
fort worth when he was first 
administered by taking care of my 

2095
01:41:26,491 --> 01:41:26,710
doctors,
they said it was an entry wound.

2096
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:32,100
They changed what the wound in his neck 
was in order to fit with the established

2097
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:35,110
narrative of Lee Harvey Oswald being the
lone shooter.

2098
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:38,410
That's one reason to think that there 
was more than one person.

2099
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:43,830
The other reason to think there was more
than one person was the single bullet 

2100
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:46,261
theory,
and I've heard a lot of people say that 

2101
01:41:46,261 --> 01:41:46,261
the single bullet theory could have 
happened.

2102
01:41:46,261 --> 01:41:50,490
That bullets can act very weird when 
they go through and they absolutely 

2103
01:41:50,490 --> 01:41:53,560
can't.
People have shot people and bullets shot

2104
01:41:53,561 --> 01:41:58,561
someone from the front and the bullet 
has ricocheted inside their head and 

2105
01:41:58,561 --> 01:41:58,930
come out there.
I and landed in front.

2106
01:41:58,990 --> 01:42:03,990
I mean that has happened,
but let's take very strange past when 

2107
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:05,830
they ricochet off bones.
That's not what's weird about the bullet

2108
01:42:05,831 --> 01:42:10,831
passing through to people.
What's weird about the bullet passing 

2109
01:42:10,831 --> 01:42:13,891
through to people is first of all,
why did they think that one bullet did 

2110
01:42:13,891 --> 01:42:15,730
that and the reason for that is because 
a bullet hit,

2111
01:42:15,731 --> 01:42:20,731
the underpass ricocheted off a curb 
stone and hurt some person that was 

2112
01:42:20,731 --> 01:42:24,931
standing in the underpass.
So they had to attribute one of the 

2113
01:42:24,931 --> 01:42:25,090
shots.
One of the three shots to that bullet,

2114
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:30,420
they knew that Kennedy and connally had 
both been hit and then they knew that 

2115
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:31,420
there was a headshot,
so those are three bullets,

2116
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:36,540
one boat that hit the curb stone,
the other boat that passed through two 

2117
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:36,540
bodies,
and then the headshot.

2118
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:40,470
That's the reason why they had to make 
the entry wound of the neck a 

2119
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:44,071
tracheotomy and that's the reason why 
they had to say that one bullet had 

2120
01:42:44,071 --> 01:42:45,250
caused these wounds on two different 
people.

2121
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:49,120
They found the bullet on the Gurney in 
Connolly's hospital,

2122
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:51,040
Gurney when he was administered in the 
hospital.

2123
01:42:51,070 --> 01:42:56,070
Oh look,
we found a bullet in pristine condition 

2124
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:56,800
if you've ever shot a bullet,
and that bullets hit bone.

2125
01:42:57,070 --> 01:43:02,070
When bullets hit bone,
they distort the idea that that bullet 

2126
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:05,701
came out like that.
After going through two people's bodies 

2127
01:43:05,701 --> 01:43:06,400
and hitting bone.
It's ridiculous.

2128
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:11,460
It doesn't make any sense.
That's the reason why I think that more 

2129
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:14,521
than one person was involved and that's 
the reason why there's a book called 

2130
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:17,410
best evidence by a guy named David 
Lifton who goes into great detail.

2131
01:43:17,411 --> 01:43:22,411
He was a.
He was a bookkeeper and an accountant 

2132
01:43:22,411 --> 01:43:22,560
and uh,
he,

2133
01:43:22,650 --> 01:43:27,650
he had some assignment revolving 
involving the Warren Commission and he 

2134
01:43:27,650 --> 01:43:32,371
was such a meticulous guy that he 
actually read the entire Warren 

2135
01:43:32,371 --> 01:43:33,940
Commission,
which is some insane number of pages,

2136
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:39,180
but he read it and he wrote a book 
called best evidence all about all the 

2137
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:43,111
contradictions in the Warren Commission 
report and why he thought that the 

2138
01:43:43,111 --> 01:43:45,530
entire thing was established to make a,
a,

2139
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:49,690
a predetermined conclusion and to 
establish that with the American public.

2140
01:43:49,690 --> 01:43:52,970
And he thought it was all horse shit.
So I don't think so.

2141
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:54,770
I think more than one person was 
involved,

2142
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:56,990
but it could have been Lee Harvey Oswald
to.

2143
01:43:57,140 --> 01:44:02,140
That's what people don't understand.
Why people have to have either Lee 

2144
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:06,430
Harvey Oswald killed them or there was 
other people like it has to be there 

2145
01:44:06,430 --> 01:44:06,430
alone.
Assassin or other people.

2146
01:44:06,430 --> 01:44:10,811
I think the Harvey Oswald clearly was a 
fucked up guy who had some sort of a 

2147
01:44:10,881 --> 01:44:13,510
connection to the government.
He went to Russia,

2148
01:44:13,530 --> 01:44:16,880
lived in Russia,
and then came back to the United States,

2149
01:44:16,881 --> 01:44:21,500
got a passport until he was living in 
Russia and then was readmitted back into

2150
01:44:21,501 --> 01:44:24,440
the United States and had some dubious 
connections to the,

2151
01:44:24,441 --> 01:44:25,200
uh,
to,

2152
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:27,070
to the,
to the world of,

2153
01:44:27,071 --> 01:44:27,980
of,
of government.

2154
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:32,360
It was a very strange,
strange story that in this day and age,

2155
01:44:32,361 --> 01:44:33,890
you know,
all these years later,

2156
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:36,340
we're most likely never going to get the
full.

2157
01:44:36,860 --> 01:44:39,080
How many impacts do you see in that 
video?

2158
01:44:39,080 --> 01:44:40,140
It's hard to say.
You know,

2159
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:43,490
when Kennedy is holding his body like 
this,

2160
01:44:43,970 --> 01:44:45,830
most likely he's.
He had been hit,

2161
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:47,570
but they're saying that it was from the 
front.

2162
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,000
How do you know it was from the front?
It was from the,

2163
01:44:50,010 --> 01:44:52,130
behind the sign.
He could've been hit from the back.

2164
01:44:52,131 --> 01:44:53,560
It's hard to tell what happened.
Me,

2165
01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:58,630
he's going like this.
You're assuming that that's because he 

2166
01:44:58,630 --> 01:44:58,630
was hit,
but it might not have been.

2167
01:44:58,630 --> 01:45:00,590
I mean,
he might've dropped his fucking pen.

2168
01:45:00,620 --> 01:45:01,580
I mean,
he might've been like,

2169
01:45:01,581 --> 01:45:03,560
where's my shit?
And then got hit in the head.

2170
01:45:03,561 --> 01:45:05,150
I don't know.
I don't know.

2171
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:09,500
It's very difficult to tell from that 
video how many times he's been hit,

2172
01:45:10,190 --> 01:45:15,190
but the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald 
acted alone seems the least likely of 

2173
01:45:16,401 --> 01:45:21,401
those of the scenarios,
and then the photos of the Howard hunt 

2174
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:26,590
who was arrested allegedly along with a 
bunch of people that were quote Unquote 

2175
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:32,740
Hobos,
that they ended up arrested behind the 

2176
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:33,410
behind the grassy knoll,
but then they were all released.

2177
01:45:33,650 --> 01:45:35,360
Their hobos were,
they were dressed normal,

2178
01:45:35,390 --> 01:45:36,050
their address,
like,

2179
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:37,070
you know,
regular people.

2180
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:38,950
And then you know,
Woody Harrelson,

2181
01:45:38,951 --> 01:45:43,951
his dad who was a known murderer who 
supposedly has some sort of a connection

2182
01:45:44,871 --> 01:45:45,990
to it.
I don't know.

2183
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:46,910
You know,
I don't know,

2184
01:45:46,911 --> 01:45:51,911
but you know,
there's a guy who wanted to get rid of 

2185
01:45:51,911 --> 01:45:51,911
the Federal Reserve.
There was a guy who wanted to get rid of

2186
01:45:51,911 --> 01:45:54,230
the CIA.
He wanted to pull out of Vietnam.

2187
01:45:54,290 --> 01:45:59,290
I mean,
there's a lot of shit that Kennedy 

2188
01:45:59,290 --> 01:45:59,290
wanted.
He wanted to put us.

2189
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:03,190
He put us out of Vietnam.
He wanted to disrupt the military 

2190
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:07,301
industrial complex.
He wanted to do a lot of things that 

2191
01:46:07,301 --> 01:46:07,301
were very unpopular.

2192
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:12,650
I mean,
in a way you could pose the question is 

2193
01:46:12,650 --> 01:46:14,900
not why would he have been assassinated,
but why aren't more president's 

2194
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:15,670
assassinated?
We'll look at a guy like Obama who,

2195
01:46:15,690 --> 01:46:20,690
it's amazing to me that given the level 
of vitriol that's directed at him from 

2196
01:46:21,271 --> 01:46:22,190
quarters,
you know,

2197
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:27,200
in the far right that someone.
But I think every day there are threats 

2198
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,970
and probably some of them are credible 
threats against him.

2199
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:30,810
Sure.

2200
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:36,070
I'm sure that CIA or the rather the 
secret service does a great job of 

2201
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:36,800
stopping a lot of assassination 
attempts.

2202
01:46:37,070 --> 01:46:38,750
I mean,
if we lived in a time like,

2203
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:40,610
you know,
during the Lincoln administration,

2204
01:46:40,611 --> 01:46:42,560
whether there's.
Everything was very just,

2205
01:46:42,561 --> 01:46:47,561
you know,
they just didn't have the type of 

2206
01:46:47,561 --> 01:46:48,821
security that they have today.
They didn't have this sort of 

2207
01:46:48,821 --> 01:46:48,821
technology.
The ability to track people,

2208
01:46:48,821 --> 01:46:50,340
the ability to keep an eye on 
questionable

2209
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:50,790
folks

2210
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:51,440
did.
Uh,

2211
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:55,790
did you follow one of the guys they 
questioned in connection with threats to

2212
01:46:55,791 --> 01:46:59,420
the president was Ted Nugent,
did you know that question with?

2213
01:46:59,690 --> 01:47:02,660
He was actually for statements that he'd
made about Obama.

2214
01:47:02,661 --> 01:47:05,690
He got a,
he got a visit from the secret service.

2215
01:47:05,770 --> 01:47:10,770
Yeah.
He said that he would wind up in jail 

2216
01:47:10,770 --> 01:47:10,840
if,
if Obama was elected again,

2217
01:47:10,970 --> 01:47:12,190
you know,
that he would wind up in jail.

2218
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:17,200
Well,
and that was construed as a threat to 

2219
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:17,710
them because I made a program about.
Here's another guy.

2220
01:47:17,770 --> 01:47:21,670
I did it when I started out working in 
TV with Michael Moore.

2221
01:47:22,370 --> 01:47:27,370
Uh,
he gave me my break on tv and I worked 

2222
01:47:27,370 --> 01:47:29,830
on a show called TV nation and one of 
the early segments was with Ted nugent.

2223
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:32,440
I've always had a sort of fascination 
with the far right.

2224
01:47:32,530 --> 01:47:34,270
Yeah.
He's a very fascinating guy.

2225
01:47:34,271 --> 01:47:39,271
And the FARC row on the far right 
because there's been so much bizarre 

2226
01:47:39,271 --> 01:47:43,321
shit in his past.
He had adopted some 17 year old girl or 

2227
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:50,100
became a legal custody.
Took legal custody of her so we could 

2228
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:52,891
have sex with her.
Is that rights as parents allowed it or 

2229
01:47:52,891 --> 01:47:52,891
her parents maybe or 11?
Yeah.

2230
01:47:52,891 --> 01:47:56,130
It said in a recent New York Times story
that he had admitted to having,

2231
01:47:56,330 --> 01:47:58,980
um,
I guess unlawful,

2232
01:47:58,981 --> 01:48:02,650
a relationship.
Sexual relations with underage girls.

2233
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:03,570
Underage girl.
Okay.

2234
01:48:03,620 --> 01:48:05,000
Goals.
Does that ring a bell?

2235
01:48:05,030 --> 01:48:08,140
There was something that Courtney love 
said that she gave him a blowjob and she

2236
01:48:08,141 --> 01:48:10,090
was 12.
Really am.

2237
01:48:10,170 --> 01:48:12,780
Yeah.
Apparently allegedly A.

2238
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:15,010
Yeah.
He's a fascinating character.

2239
01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:17,710
You know,
he's a radical far right,

2240
01:48:17,740 --> 01:48:22,740
sort of a guy,
but what he said about Obama was clearly

2241
01:48:22,751 --> 01:48:25,690
a joke,
but you can't have jokes about Obama.

2242
01:48:25,691 --> 01:48:27,450
Like we had a guy on

2243
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:31,990
that was a joke as much as just A.
I'm a racist,

2244
01:48:31,991 --> 01:48:34,000
insult,
racist.

2245
01:48:34,210 --> 01:48:35,170
When he said,
well,

2246
01:48:35,171 --> 01:48:40,171
this was a different occasion.
This was when he called him a subhuman 

2247
01:48:40,171 --> 01:48:40,171
Mongrel.

2248
01:48:40,171 --> 01:48:40,590
Oh,
okay.

2249
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:45,680
Yeah.
Well that's not what we're talking 

2250
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:45,680
about.
I don't think that was the reason why he

2251
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:46,580
got up with the visit.
Yeah.

2252
01:48:46,581 --> 01:48:48,300
I'm sorry,
I switched the subject.

2253
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:52,020
It was more recently in the news because
of this comment.

2254
01:48:52,110 --> 01:48:57,110
Yeah.
The visit was before the reelection 

2255
01:48:57,110 --> 01:48:57,130
instead of Obama got in office again.
He would wind up being arrested.

2256
01:48:57,320 --> 01:49:02,320
That was,
I'm sure that was a CIA visited him and 

2257
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:02,330
I think he was just talking shit,
you know,

2258
01:49:02,331 --> 01:49:05,430
I think he just talks a lot.
He does an incredible amount of media.

2259
01:49:05,431 --> 01:49:07,930
I'm pretty fascinated by that guy.
He said,

2260
01:49:08,730 --> 01:49:09,480
when I was with him,

2261
01:49:09,550 --> 01:49:13,820
she said that I said something about the
Oklahoma City bombing.

2262
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:17,540
I said,
why is your flag at half mast?

2263
01:49:17,541 --> 01:49:19,190
He said,
because of the Oklahoma City bombing.

2264
01:49:19,850 --> 01:49:21,230
It was at the time when I,
I,

2265
01:49:21,530 --> 01:49:26,530
uh,
it had just come out that Terry Nichols 

2266
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:26,530
had,
had some relationship with,

2267
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:28,120
um,
uh,

2268
01:49:28,140 --> 01:49:30,410
the Timothy Mcveigh.
And,

2269
01:49:30,411 --> 01:49:31,160
um,
I said,

2270
01:49:31,161 --> 01:49:36,161
well,
it seems as though the suspects that 

2271
01:49:36,161 --> 01:49:38,231
they have in custody,
it was pretrial have the same sort of 

2272
01:49:38,231 --> 01:49:38,231
profile as you,
ted,

2273
01:49:38,231 --> 01:49:38,240
they're,
they're,

2274
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:43,250
they're pro gun rights members of the 
Michigan militia who you say you 

2275
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:44,840
support.
Which was kind of a cheeky question.

2276
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:45,570
Like,
I,

2277
01:49:45,590 --> 01:49:47,930
I,
if I was asking you

2278
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,810
now,
I'd asked it in a different way,

2279
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:52,680
but he,
he kind of went nuts and,

2280
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:56,920
and,
and started shouting abuse at me.

2281
01:49:57,660 --> 01:49:58,900
He said,
um,

2282
01:49:59,150 --> 01:50:00,370
he,
he became logarithmic.

2283
01:50:00,490 --> 01:50:02,860
Like he became incapable as he was so 
angry.

2284
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:06,270
He didn't hit me or he just read it.
You see that this is what,

2285
01:50:06,330 --> 01:50:11,330
this is what the media does and why did 
I mention you could kiss my ass.

2286
01:50:12,130 --> 01:50:17,130
Like he said something like Ted nugent 
impression by the way you even touch 

2287
01:50:17,130 --> 01:50:17,130
the,
took the tone row,

2288
01:50:17,130 --> 01:50:17,620
he said,
and then he said,

2289
01:50:17,621 --> 01:50:18,670
um,
I said,

2290
01:50:18,671 --> 01:50:19,990
what do you think about Janet Reno?
He said,

2291
01:50:19,991 --> 01:50:22,930
she's worse than Hitler,
and I was like,

2292
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:27,460
worse than Hitler,
like even if you hate Janet Reno,

2293
01:50:27,790 --> 01:50:31,510
she's not rounding people up and sending
them to their death in,

2294
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:31,850
you know,
in,

2295
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:34,210
in the millions.
And then,

2296
01:50:34,270 --> 01:50:39,270
and then he had a mony said,
well no one's worse than Hitler I 

2297
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:39,270
suppose.

2298
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:43,560
And he kinda climbed down from it.
I think there's a thing that he does 

2299
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:46,801
where he just talks a lot and I think 
when you talk a lot you just need to 

2300
01:50:46,801 --> 01:50:47,620
keep talking.
He's also very,

2301
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:52,000
he talks a lot and he's very angry.
He's just very keyed up sometimes,

2302
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:53,830
but he's watching them,
a lighting guy,

2303
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:55,930
like he's actually quite and he can be 
quite.

2304
01:50:55,931 --> 01:50:59,050
I went on a little hunting excursion 
with them as part of the show as well.

2305
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:01,450
And he's capable of being kind of a 
mellow,

2306
01:51:01,451 --> 01:51:03,310
interesting dude as well.
Yes.

2307
01:51:03,311 --> 01:51:04,930
Yes.
And that's what I was going to say.

2308
01:51:04,931 --> 01:51:06,190
Like you watch them,
I was hunting show.

2309
01:51:06,191 --> 01:51:09,790
He seems very happy,
like I hunt and I've watched his hunting

2310
01:51:09,791 --> 01:51:14,791
show many times and it's,
his hunting in quotes is very odd too.

2311
01:51:15,580 --> 01:51:18,820
And this leads us to another subject 
that I wanted to cover with you.

2312
01:51:19,070 --> 01:51:20,500
Um,
he,

2313
01:51:20,530 --> 01:51:23,140
he hunts in his yard,
right?

2314
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:28,200
He's got a compound of 300 acres and in 
Texas and he's got one in Michigan as 

2315
01:51:31,451 --> 01:51:33,140
well.
And you know,

2316
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:36,910
he leaves out food and weight and a tree
and shoots these animals.

2317
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:38,520
It's,
it's a.

2318
01:51:38,830 --> 01:51:43,830
So it would be caught,
it would be considered canned hunting 

2319
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:43,830
there 100 percent.
Yes.

2320
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:46,780
But he's using a bow and Arrow,
which to me,

2321
01:51:46,781 --> 01:51:51,781
mate,
I've got more time for bow and Arrow 

2322
01:51:51,781 --> 01:51:54,451
hunters in the sense that it's so much 
more difficult unless you're leaving 

2323
01:51:54,451 --> 01:51:58,771
food out and the animals are eating food
10 feet away from you and you're hiding 

2324
01:51:58,771 --> 01:51:59,770
in a tree.
And that helps.

2325
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:05,040
It helps a lot.
It's a very controversial method of 

2326
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:06,400
hunting and there's two types of people 
in.

2327
01:52:06,401 --> 01:52:11,401
When it comes to the hunting community,
there's people that are fair chase 

2328
01:52:11,401 --> 01:52:13,030
hunters and people that believe in high 
fence operations and sometimes they're,

2329
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:14,050
they're interchangeable.

2330
01:52:14,050 --> 01:52:16,650
Sometimes people support both.
Um,

2331
01:52:17,110 --> 01:52:18,860
and I,
I would.

2332
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:24,090
This is the way I feel about it.
I think that it's a great way of 

2333
01:52:24,090 --> 01:52:26,881
acquiring meet.
That's probably way more ethical than 

2334
01:52:26,881 --> 01:52:26,881
being a farmer.
You know,

2335
01:52:26,881 --> 01:52:27,070
if you're going to look at it that way,
you're going to say,

2336
01:52:27,071 --> 01:52:28,570
well,
this is how I acquire my meat.

2337
01:52:28,571 --> 01:52:30,280
I leave food out for them and then I 
shoot them.

2338
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:34,010
Okay,
I see that and I agree with that.

2339
01:52:34,011 --> 01:52:36,820
It think it's better than farming in 
that sense,

2340
01:52:37,510 --> 01:52:40,900
but it's to call it hunting the same way
you would call hunting,

2341
01:52:40,901 --> 01:52:45,901
like climbing up to the Alps and looking
for a mountain goat that lives in the 

2342
01:52:45,901 --> 01:52:46,040
wild or

2343
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:51,250
going through the rockies and chasing 
down a moose,

2344
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:53,360
you know,
that lives in the wild.

2345
01:52:53,370 --> 01:52:56,900
It's a two completely different sort of 
endeavors.

2346
01:52:57,170 --> 01:53:02,170
When you've got these animals fenced in,
you have an account of how many are 

2347
01:53:02,170 --> 01:53:02,210
there?
There's 300 a year.

2348
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:04,160
I need to kill one of them.
You know,

2349
01:53:04,161 --> 01:53:08,570
and that's not really hunting and one of
your shows,

2350
01:53:08,571 --> 01:53:13,571
which I found very fascinating that I 
watched last night was about canned 

2351
01:53:13,571 --> 01:53:14,230
hunts and Africa.
Right.

2352
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:19,660
And that was really fascinating what a 
contradictory and complex subject 

2353
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:26,920
because for folks who don't know,
Africa was on the verge of a lot of the 

2354
01:53:27,921 --> 01:53:31,910
animals that are now being hunted.
We're on the verge of extinction now.

2355
01:53:31,911 --> 01:53:36,911
They have extremely high numbers all in 
these high fence operations and these 

2356
01:53:37,281 --> 01:53:42,200
people go over there and hunt them.
And that guy that you had that own,

2357
01:53:42,201 --> 01:53:47,201
that operation that got crazy with you 
and put his hand on the camera and hold 

2358
01:53:47,201 --> 01:53:48,640
it down was very emotional.

2359
01:53:48,910 --> 01:53:53,910
Where was the.
I was making the exact same point you 

2360
01:53:53,910 --> 01:53:54,560
just made and I think the phrase I said,
you know,

2361
01:53:54,810 --> 01:53:59,810
if you've got a fence up and the animal 
knows it's going to be fed and you just 

2362
01:53:59,851 --> 01:54:04,851
hide in your little a bunker until you 
know the wart hog or the lion shows up 

2363
01:54:05,011 --> 01:54:07,620
knowing that the foods out and then you 
take a puppet.

2364
01:54:07,950 --> 01:54:10,350
I said it's like it's like tennis 
without a net.

2365
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:12,930
Yes.
And that was what he took exception to.

2366
01:54:13,310 --> 01:54:15,740
You said it's very artificial.
Something very.

2367
01:54:15,741 --> 01:54:16,920
Any.
He agreed to it.

2368
01:54:16,921 --> 01:54:18,990
Yeah.
But then what was fascinating to me,

2369
01:54:19,170 --> 01:54:19,910
he was like,
had,

2370
01:54:19,970 --> 01:54:22,170
don't understand Africa.
Africa's fucked.

2371
01:54:22,210 --> 01:54:23,750
Yeah.
Africa is fucked.

2372
01:54:24,910 --> 01:54:28,440
I hate fucking elephants.
They don't eat the shitty push.

2373
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:30,320
They always eat the tall trees.

2374
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:37,340
And he goes on a rant about Africa is 
fucked because we eat everything and we 

2375
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:40,020
kill everything.
And he sort of A.

2376
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:41,510
I mean,
it's a great moment because he,

2377
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:43,500
he in,
in the act of asking,

2378
01:54:43,680 --> 01:54:45,730
I don't think the question was that 
cheeky was,

2379
01:54:45,731 --> 01:54:50,160
it was a fair question if he'd said 
similar things to me about,

2380
01:54:50,161 --> 01:54:50,450
you know,
it's not,

2381
01:54:50,610 --> 01:54:52,380
is it real hunting?
Not Hunting,

2382
01:54:52,500 --> 01:54:54,570
but some people don't want a big flash 
cards.

2383
01:54:54,571 --> 01:54:56,380
They wanted little shitty car,
you know,

2384
01:54:56,381 --> 01:54:58,590
that was his analogy.
And I said,

2385
01:54:58,591 --> 01:55:00,240
so when I say tends without net,
he would agree.

2386
01:55:00,270 --> 01:55:02,820
But he was,
he was kind of a little tweet.

2387
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:05,130
Um,
I think his point though,

2388
01:55:05,131 --> 01:55:10,131
and his point was well taken and it's 
set him up to go to deliver a very 

2389
01:55:10,131 --> 01:55:12,480
impassioned monologue on many of the 
problems that are very real.

2390
01:55:12,481 --> 01:55:13,260
You know,
in Africa.

2391
01:55:13,410 --> 01:55:14,400
Yeah,
most certainly.

2392
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:19,740
I also found it incredibly fascinating 
when you guys were feeding the lions 

2393
01:55:20,290 --> 01:55:25,290
because I saw both sides.
They're on one side I saw like this is 

2394
01:55:25,290 --> 01:55:30,181
so strange.
There's this in enclosed fenced in small

2395
01:55:30,221 --> 01:55:35,221
area where these lines are being bred 
and they're hurling these calves,

2396
01:55:35,560 --> 01:55:40,560
these dead calves over the top of the 
fence and these lions are eating these 

2397
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:45,211
calves.
And you were talking about how clean 

2398
01:55:45,211 --> 01:55:45,211
they.
And he's like,

2399
01:55:45,211 --> 01:55:45,420
yeah,
they don't fight,

2400
01:55:45,450 --> 01:55:46,920
they have food.
Here it is right here.

2401
01:55:47,390 --> 01:55:48,990
I mean,
but the other thing he,

2402
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:52,620
where he was saying it was like,
you think these things are your friend.

2403
01:55:52,830 --> 01:55:54,690
Like if I,
if I put you over there,

2404
01:55:54,691 --> 01:55:56,340
if you went through they would tear you 
apart.

2405
01:55:56,341 --> 01:55:59,910
Like instantly,
like play with your clouds.

2406
01:55:59,950 --> 01:56:01,410
Yeah.
And play with your clothes.

2407
01:56:01,411 --> 01:56:06,411
I was fucking dark reminders.
The top part of your skull and the 

2408
01:56:06,411 --> 01:56:10,720
roots.
They will eat everything and they will 

2409
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:11,280
play with your clothes.
Oh,

2410
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:14,100
oh,
that's so fucked up

2411
01:56:14,120 --> 01:56:16,850
because it's so true.
When you're close to them,

2412
01:56:17,120 --> 01:56:22,120
it's like,
just to get close to that fence like I 

2413
01:56:22,120 --> 01:56:22,220
probably 2015,
20 feet away.

2414
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:26,090
But just to get it was something in you 
that almost prevents you.

2415
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:26,690
You're,
you know,

2416
01:56:26,691 --> 01:56:27,980
you're safe.
Like there's a fence.

2417
01:56:27,981 --> 01:56:31,010
He's not going to not defensive,
but you just physically,

2418
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:36,580
there's something really embedded in the
psyche that tells you don't get any 

2419
01:56:36,580 --> 01:56:37,490
closer like lines when you're up close 
with them.

2420
01:56:37,491 --> 01:56:40,420
Then put that video back again a little 
bit earlier.

2421
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:41,780
When you see the,
uh,

2422
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:43,440
when you throw in the,
um,

2423
01:56:43,710 --> 01:56:48,210
the cabs over the fence and you get to 
see the looks in their eyes when they're

2424
01:56:48,211 --> 01:56:51,630
staring at you,
they're fucking so terrifying.

2425
01:56:52,080 --> 01:56:54,050
You don't need to put the volume on it 
just to show the,

2426
01:56:54,051 --> 01:56:54,900
uh,
the images of it.

2427
01:56:54,950 --> 01:56:59,520
It's so terrifying.
That such an unbelievable.

2428
01:56:59,521 --> 01:57:04,521
And it's very different than the zoo.
The zoo is a different experience and I 

2429
01:57:04,521 --> 01:57:07,950
don't know if it's because the animals 
get that food slid to them underneath.

2430
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:09,330
I mean,
it's a plate of food.

2431
01:57:09,331 --> 01:57:12,510
It's not an actual animal that they're 
tearing apart.

2432
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:13,390
I,
you know,

2433
01:57:13,391 --> 01:57:14,350
I don't know.
I think,

2434
01:57:14,710 --> 01:57:15,820
I don't know,
maybe they,

2435
01:57:15,821 --> 01:57:20,590
I think he kept his lines a bit hungrier
than the ones you find at the zoo.

2436
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:23,650
I think maybe the zoo's get handled.
So they used to.

2437
01:57:23,651 --> 01:57:26,530
Human contact is part of that as well 
and get handled.

2438
01:57:26,531 --> 01:57:27,600
Ever.
Zoos?

2439
01:57:27,640 --> 01:57:29,290
Yeah.
Well they can't,

2440
01:57:29,291 --> 01:57:32,200
you can't handle lions.
I'm mean you can,

2441
01:57:32,201 --> 01:57:33,730
if you train them.
I,

2442
01:57:33,731 --> 01:57:36,090
I did a story about,
um,

2443
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:39,300
I mean,
uh,

2444
01:57:39,430 --> 01:57:40,900
you know,
siegfried and Roy,

2445
01:57:40,930 --> 01:57:42,700
I mean,
illustrates both sides of the equation.

2446
01:57:42,701 --> 01:57:44,370
I did another story.
There was a tigers,

2447
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:45,130
right?
Targets,

2448
01:57:45,131 --> 01:57:50,131
but same thing face.
I think tigers are a little easier to 

2449
01:57:50,131 --> 01:57:50,131
train them.
Lions,

2450
01:57:50,131 --> 01:57:55,090
I don't know about that,
but I know that I did a story called 

2451
01:57:55,090 --> 01:57:56,680
America's most dangerous pets and it was
about people.

2452
01:57:57,610 --> 01:58:02,610
I don't know if this is true now,
but at the time it was true that there 

2453
01:58:02,610 --> 01:58:04,681
are more tigers in captivity in Texas 
than there are in the wild in India.

2454
01:58:07,120 --> 01:58:12,120
I mean,
there's thousands and thousands of 

2455
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:14,100
targets in America and um,
kept as pets in people's back yards and,

2456
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:19,250
and,
and what I heard again and again was 

2457
01:58:19,250 --> 01:58:19,250
like I will get into the cage and stroke
my tiger,

2458
01:58:19,410 --> 01:58:21,970
all my lion and cuddle it and that's 
fine,

2459
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:24,610
but I am not getting coast to my 
monkeys.

2460
01:58:25,390 --> 01:58:28,170
The big fear was if you have a,
uh,

2461
01:58:28,300 --> 01:58:31,360
especially chimpanzees,
like they are,

2462
01:58:32,050 --> 01:58:34,990
don't go near the chimpanzees will fuck 
you up.

2463
01:58:35,020 --> 01:58:40,020
They will rip your nose off,
rip your balls off and eat your face.

2464
01:58:40,570 --> 01:58:42,400
Yeah.
There's really

2465
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:47,790
creepy about chimpanzee attacks too.
Is there to aware there they're too 

2466
01:58:47,790 --> 01:58:51,721
intelligent.
Like they go after they can plan and 

2467
01:58:51,721 --> 01:58:55,501
they know that you at some level they 
know you are the one keeping them in 

2468
01:58:55,501 --> 01:58:58,981
there.
But also I think they're intelligent 

2469
01:58:58,981 --> 01:59:01,921
enough to become seriously neurotic and,
and dysfunctional from confinement.

2470
01:59:02,980 --> 01:59:03,740
Yes.
Yes.

2471
01:59:04,390 --> 01:59:09,390
Whereas a tiger I think can,
I don't say it's a good life for a 

2472
01:59:09,390 --> 01:59:12,541
tiger,
but a tiger doesn't necessarily become 

2473
01:59:12,541 --> 01:59:12,900
dysfunctional from being pent up,
but a,

2474
01:59:12,901 --> 01:59:17,901
um,
a chimpanzee and is like a person in 

2475
01:59:17,901 --> 01:59:19,000
need stimulation.
And not only that,

2476
01:59:19,001 --> 01:59:23,040
they also know to go cut the video,
they'll they also know to,

2477
01:59:23,070 --> 01:59:26,110
to go after your fingers that go off to 
your balls.

2478
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:29,320
Like they know what you want when you 
want to keep your fingers.

2479
01:59:29,321 --> 01:59:31,210
So they bite your fingers off.
Like there's,

2480
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:34,630
there's a certain intelligence to their 
attack that's very disturbing as opposed

2481
01:59:34,631 --> 01:59:36,250
to like a tiger that just wants to kill 
you.

2482
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:39,440
Tiger will bite your.
I read a thing about a chimpanzee attack

2483
01:59:39,441 --> 01:59:41,890
at a zoo.
Like before I went out to do the story,

2484
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:46,840
I was reading up on chimpanzee attacks 
because I knew for the story to work,

2485
01:59:46,841 --> 01:59:51,841
I'd probably at some point have to 
cuddle a chimpanzee or something like 

2486
01:59:51,841 --> 01:59:51,841
that.
No,

2487
01:59:51,841 --> 01:59:55,590
it was making me nervous.
Like it was making me more nervous than 

2488
01:59:55,590 --> 01:59:56,570
the idea of going into a prison cell or 
a jail cell where you know,

2489
01:59:56,580 --> 02:00:01,580
you know,
there's enough rationality on the part 

2490
02:00:01,580 --> 02:00:01,580
of the prisoner that he's not going to 
attack me and bite my balls.

2491
02:00:01,580 --> 02:00:02,950
I mean he's not gonna shift me.
He,

2492
02:00:02,951 --> 02:00:04,660
he doesn't.
There's nothing in it for him.

2493
02:00:05,050 --> 02:00:07,720
You know?
Why would a inmate attack a journalist?

2494
02:00:07,721 --> 02:00:10,630
It doesn't make any sense,
but the chimpanzee is not going to think

2495
02:00:10,631 --> 02:00:12,490
like that.
And I read an account of a,

2496
02:00:12,850 --> 02:00:15,310
of a,
of an attack at a pr at a zoo,

2497
02:00:15,311 --> 02:00:20,311
a chimpanzee,
and the news local news turned up and 

2498
02:00:20,311 --> 02:00:21,190
the chimpanzee ran over and bit the 
cameraman's balls off.

2499
02:00:21,970 --> 02:00:25,200
Fuck.
And so then with that filming on my,

2500
02:00:25,220 --> 02:00:28,300
I just don't want to get in the cage 
with a chimpanzee.

2501
02:00:28,301 --> 02:00:30,480
Was Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

2502
02:00:30,490 --> 02:00:35,490
No desire,
no desire and almost or fucking 

2503
02:00:35,490 --> 02:00:35,490
terrifying if they're a violent man,
you know,

2504
02:00:35,490 --> 02:00:36,480
really crazy.
I it,

2505
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:37,600
that was a small one.
I was like,

2506
02:00:37,601 --> 02:00:38,890
okay,
I'll cuddle this one.

2507
02:00:39,190 --> 02:00:42,580
We had a small one on news radio wants.
I'm a sitcom that I was on.

2508
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:44,760
Oh yeah.
I remember news radio and he was a,

2509
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,720
he was only two years old,
uh,

2510
02:00:46,721 --> 02:00:47,320
or,
excuse me,

2511
02:00:47,350 --> 02:00:49,630
less than two years old,
I believe he was a baby.

2512
02:00:49,631 --> 02:00:54,631
He was small.
He's got a little Zapper on him that 

2513
02:00:54,631 --> 02:00:54,670
they give him electric shocks if he,
if he gets out of line.

2514
02:00:55,120 --> 02:01:00,120
The one I had a hold of was a little 
smaller than that one and he climbed on 

2515
02:01:00,221 --> 02:01:03,640
my back and fucking slap me on the back.

2516
02:01:03,650 --> 02:01:06,370
Just so strong.
He's so strong.

2517
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:09,200
It was so small.
It was a small chimp,

2518
02:01:09,510 --> 02:01:11,470
a baby chimp,
but it was.

2519
02:01:12,180 --> 02:01:17,180
It's hard as a reference because we look
at a human that size and we look at a 

2520
02:01:18,791 --> 02:01:23,791
chimp that size and we're going,
how fucking strong could it be like a 

2521
02:01:23,791 --> 02:01:24,880
person,
like a full grown man on your back?

2522
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:29,940
It was a baby,
but it had the strength of a man like 

2523
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:31,450
the way it moved me around.
That would make sense because the cliche

2524
02:01:31,451 --> 02:01:33,070
and it may be true.
That gets passed around.

2525
02:01:33,071 --> 02:01:36,430
Is that a full grown chimp?
It has the strength of seven men.

2526
02:01:36,490 --> 02:01:38,710
A 500 pound man is what I've heard.
Really?

2527
02:01:38,711 --> 02:01:43,711
Yeah.
See that I would pay to see like a UFC 

2528
02:01:43,711 --> 02:01:43,850
guy.
It gets to full grown chimp will.

2529
02:01:43,851 --> 02:01:45,890
You would have to take the chimps main 
weapon away,

2530
02:01:45,891 --> 02:01:47,890
which is its mouth,
you know,

2531
02:01:48,130 --> 02:01:50,930
put a mouth guard on it or something 
that you would have to,

2532
02:01:51,290 --> 02:01:52,460
you know,
maybe men would,

2533
02:01:52,610 --> 02:01:54,770
would,
are they guys that would do that.

2534
02:01:55,100 --> 02:02:00,100
I'm sure there's an idiot out there that
would do almost anything that you came 

2535
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:02,801
with.
Those guys that you interviewed that 

2536
02:02:02,801 --> 02:02:04,871
were progressors,
that are beaten each other with a 

2537
02:02:04,871 --> 02:02:06,970
fucking barbwire.
I'm sure if you put a mask on one of 

2538
02:02:06,970 --> 02:02:06,970
those dummies,
they would,

2539
02:02:06,970 --> 02:02:07,850
uh,
they would get in there and scrap with a

2540
02:02:07,851 --> 02:02:10,510
chimpanzee.
What.

2541
02:02:10,620 --> 02:02:13,910
But my point that I wanted to get back 
to was the,

2542
02:02:13,911 --> 02:02:14,480
the,
the,

2543
02:02:14,481 --> 02:02:19,481
the complex contradictory aspect of 
those canned hunts and Africa.

2544
02:02:20,110 --> 02:02:25,110
You had a draw on a warthog you were 
thinking about shooting it and you're 

2545
02:02:25,251 --> 02:02:26,720
like,
I can't do this.

2546
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:28,010
Yeah.
It didn't make.

2547
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:29,210
It was,
didn't make any sense.

2548
02:02:29,211 --> 02:02:30,530
It wouldn't make any sense.
I mean,

2549
02:02:30,870 --> 02:02:31,760
I,
I,

2550
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:36,800
it was just the whole situation,
the idea that I'm going to take the life

2551
02:02:37,761 --> 02:02:42,761
of this animal just to indulge my own 
sense of either what I think I need for 

2552
02:02:44,211 --> 02:02:47,240
this program to work or my sense of 
like,

2553
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:52,280
oh,
I'm going to experience a experience 

2554
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:52,410
this to see what it feels like to take.
It didn't feel.

2555
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:55,820
I just didn't feel an urge to do it.
Like I could have forced myself if you'd

2556
02:02:55,821 --> 02:02:57,110
put a gun to my head and said,
do it.

2557
02:02:57,111 --> 02:03:02,111
I would have done it of course course.
Or if you were starving to death if I 

2558
02:03:02,111 --> 02:03:02,111
was starving,
but just to do it.

2559
02:03:02,111 --> 02:03:03,560
Oh,
I want to see what this feels like.

2560
02:03:03,650 --> 02:03:04,640
It didn't feel right.

2561
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:08,370
You had,
you captured some of the more disturbing

2562
02:03:08,371 --> 02:03:13,371
aspects of hunting on that show because 
those people were not doing it to 

2563
02:03:13,371 --> 02:03:16,590
acquire meat at all and you see they're 
trophy hunters.

2564
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:20,490
They're trophy hunters and they weren't 
doing it to acquire,

2565
02:03:20,491 --> 02:03:25,491
meet these people were doing it to to 
have this to kill things and the video 

2566
02:03:27,631 --> 02:03:32,631
of them being all joyful and happy when 
they all got together and compared notes

2567
02:03:34,291 --> 02:03:39,291
after their individual hunts,
like several individual hunting parties 

2568
02:03:39,291 --> 02:03:39,291
had went out,

2569
02:03:39,291 --> 02:03:43,190
came out like after the second day,
the first full day of hunting and then 

2570
02:03:43,190 --> 02:03:46,471
we do an inventory of that.
Got like three zippers to Kudu,

2571
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:52,320
a gazelle and it was an inventory of 
kind and and you can sort of pick them 

2572
02:03:52,811 --> 02:03:57,180
out like they're on a shopping list and 
they know it's like 5,000

2573
02:03:57,190 --> 02:04:01,920
for a Kudu and it's 3000 for a Zipper 
and it's $20,000

2574
02:04:01,921 --> 02:04:06,921
for a giraffe and $50,000
for a rhino and stuff I thought was 

2575
02:04:06,921 --> 02:04:10,411
endangered is you can actually I guess 
not endangered and you can pay enough.

2576
02:04:11,050 --> 02:04:12,520
I said,
I thought rhinos were endangered.

2577
02:04:13,090 --> 02:04:15,540
The guy who reinforced loop,
who,

2578
02:04:15,550 --> 02:04:17,550
who ran the place.
He said if you want one,

2579
02:04:17,560 --> 02:04:18,400
I can get you 20.

2580
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:20,760
Yeah.
How fucking crazy is that?

2581
02:04:20,890 --> 02:04:22,360
Well,
there were $100,000

2582
02:04:22,361 --> 02:04:23,200
American,
which,

2583
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:26,020
well,
that was what was going on in America.

2584
02:04:26,021 --> 02:04:31,021
There was a big issue recently all over 
the news where there was a safari club 

2585
02:04:31,021 --> 02:04:35,820
that had auction.
It was in Dallas and they'd auction off 

2586
02:04:35,820 --> 02:04:38,431
a hunt for an endangered rhino and the 
idea was that all this that they had 

2587
02:04:38,431 --> 02:04:43,131
auctioned off would go.
There was a controversy about it that's 

2588
02:04:43,131 --> 02:04:44,490
really nice and it was also 
controversial because they were going to

2589
02:04:44,491 --> 02:04:49,491
have to do something with that rhino 
because it was an old rhino and the old 

2590
02:04:49,491 --> 02:04:51,420
rhinos will kill the young males.
They don't breed anymore,

2591
02:04:51,510 --> 02:04:56,510
but they're still.
They're very aggressive and territorial 

2592
02:04:56,510 --> 02:04:57,570
and they'll destroy the breeding male 
population.

2593
02:04:57,571 --> 02:05:01,140
They'll actually kill some of them and 
so they had to remove them.

2594
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:05,550
They had to remove this rhino in order 
to keep the herd healthy.

2595
02:05:05,770 --> 02:05:10,770
Well,
this is the thing like if you want to 

2596
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:12,361
see the most grisly way more grizzly end
up studying than any kind of UFC a show 

2597
02:05:12,361 --> 02:05:17,221
is,
what's your nature program with the 

2598
02:05:17,221 --> 02:05:20,221
elephants getting lost in the mist and 
getting attacked by like the level of 

2599
02:05:20,221 --> 02:05:24,690
Gore.
It's like the like snuff films in a 

2600
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:24,690
sense.
Sure.

2601
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:29,160
And so,
and I think one thing that Ted nugent 

2602
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:31,650
used to say when I was filming with him 
was he objected to the disneyfication of

2603
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:34,270
our experience of the natural world.

2604
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:36,040
I think he's got an excellent point 
there.

2605
02:05:36,310 --> 02:05:36,840
I mean,
he,

2606
02:05:36,841 --> 02:05:37,980
he's got an excellent point.
I mean,

2607
02:05:38,140 --> 02:05:41,140
think about the animals that we,
we take this,

2608
02:05:41,170 --> 02:05:45,180
this weird approach with like polar 
bears or a,

2609
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:49,600
the grizzly bears like Yogi.
We turned them into our friends.

2610
02:05:49,830 --> 02:05:51,550
You know,
polar bears are the weirdest ones.

2611
02:05:51,551 --> 02:05:54,730
You know,
polar bears are like Klondike bars.

2612
02:05:54,731 --> 02:05:56,620
What would you do for a Klondike Bar?
Or they're,

2613
02:05:56,621 --> 02:05:58,780
you know,
they're fucking drinking coke.

2614
02:05:59,080 --> 02:06:04,080
It's like,
it's this weird thing that we do with 

2615
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:04,080
the anthropomorph Promar,
phising,

2616
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:05,890
these,
these really violent,

2617
02:06:05,891 --> 02:06:10,891
dangerous animals and some of the more 
violent and more dangerous animals are 

2618
02:06:10,891 --> 02:06:14,941
the ones that we,
we may come cuddly and cute and 

2619
02:06:14,941 --> 02:06:18,060
bizarrely twist their nature up and 
that's sometimes the only exposure that 

2620
02:06:19,931 --> 02:06:23,500
people have to these animals for a long 
time.

2621
02:06:23,620 --> 02:06:26,530
Like my children,
my children.

2622
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:31,610
Uh,
I have a five year old and a three year 

2623
02:06:31,610 --> 02:06:34,141
old that are just starting to understand
that the animals that they see in 

2624
02:06:34,141 --> 02:06:36,580
cartoons are not real animals and that 
real animals don't talk.

2625
02:06:36,610 --> 02:06:38,440
Real animals are very different.
I mean they,

2626
02:06:38,490 --> 02:06:40,930
they obviously see the five-year-old 
especially sees that.

2627
02:06:41,260 --> 02:06:46,260
But I'm starting to explain to her that 
if you ever see a bear like bears are 

2628
02:06:46,481 --> 02:06:48,700
not to be approached and they're not 
cuddly.

2629
02:06:48,701 --> 02:06:53,701
They're not your friends.
And there's a real big difference 

2630
02:06:53,701 --> 02:06:55,981
between a bear that's trained like a 
bear in a movie and a bear that you see 

2631
02:06:55,981 --> 02:06:58,180
in the wild.
And so then like while their dogs in the

2632
02:06:58,181 --> 02:07:01,180
wild will not necessarily.
Sometimes there are.

2633
02:07:01,181 --> 02:07:06,181
And if you see a wild dog,
they are dangerous as well because the 

2634
02:07:06,181 --> 02:07:09,301
only thing that's not dangerous about 
dogs is that they are pets and that we 

2635
02:07:09,301 --> 02:07:10,270
train them,
we get them used to people.

2636
02:07:10,271 --> 02:07:13,870
So there's this weird relationship with 
animals that I have to sort of relate to

2637
02:07:13,871 --> 02:07:16,210
my children.
Then in doing so,

2638
02:07:16,211 --> 02:07:21,211
I start to review this bizarre thing 
that we have this weird relationship 

2639
02:07:22,001 --> 02:07:23,590
that we have to certain animals.

2640
02:07:24,450 --> 02:07:25,200
Absolutely.
I mean,

2641
02:07:25,520 --> 02:07:30,520
I don't think we really know how we feel
about a lot of animals and if we gave 

2642
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:35,100
half as much thought to the conditions 
in industrial,

2643
02:07:35,110 --> 02:07:40,110
in factory farms in the way our chickens
and pigs are raised as we do to,

2644
02:07:42,590 --> 02:07:43,950
um,
you know,

2645
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:45,880
endangered species.
I mean,

2646
02:07:45,881 --> 02:07:50,881
I'm more concerned about that in a way,
like the conditions of how our food is 

2647
02:07:51,341 --> 02:07:52,740
created,
you know,

2648
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:57,750
that um,
that pigs get fed their own minced up 

2649
02:07:57,750 --> 02:07:58,270
piglets,
you know,

2650
02:07:58,271 --> 02:07:58,720
and,
and,

2651
02:07:59,440 --> 02:08:01,840
uh,
all kinds of hideous practices.

2652
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:03,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

2653
02:08:03,371 --> 02:08:03,880
It's,
uh,

2654
02:08:03,881 --> 02:08:07,630
it's very hideous.
There's a great deal of disgusting,

2655
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:09,970
um,
practices that,

2656
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:14,860
that are involved in agriculture and 
farming and taking care of livestock.

2657
02:08:14,861 --> 02:08:16,720
And mad cow disease,
which,

2658
02:08:16,750 --> 02:08:19,050
you know,
England had a huge issue with which,

2659
02:08:19,270 --> 02:08:22,060
because they were being fed their own 
their own offspring.

2660
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:23,800
Yeah.
And brain tissue.

2661
02:08:23,801 --> 02:08:28,801
When an animal eats brain tissue,
that's the same disease that cannibals 

2662
02:08:28,841 --> 02:08:31,330
developed.
Jacob fell disease,

2663
02:08:31,670 --> 02:08:34,270
which I think so,
yeah.

2664
02:08:34,370 --> 02:08:35,500
That's,
that is the way to say it.

2665
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:38,450
Um,
I mean that is exactly what it is.

2666
02:08:38,451 --> 02:08:43,451
It's you,
you have these animals that are eating 

2667
02:08:43,451 --> 02:08:46,051
brain tissue.
The same thing as humans that 

2668
02:08:46,051 --> 02:08:47,800
cannibalize your,
like it's fucked.

2669
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:50,320
It's fucking crazy.
It's really crazy.

2670
02:08:50,321 --> 02:08:51,790
It's a weird,
weird thing,

2671
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:52,630
you know,
that we,

2672
02:08:52,660 --> 02:08:57,660
we,
we de-humanize and we also allow 

2673
02:08:57,660 --> 02:09:01,591
ourselves to put money above humanity 
about above ethics and morality.

2674
02:09:02,051 --> 02:09:07,051
And when it comes to animals,
it's more profitable to stuff them into 

2675
02:09:07,051 --> 02:09:11,461
containers and where they can barely 
move and just feed them their own 

2676
02:09:11,461 --> 02:09:11,570
bodies,
you know,

2677
02:09:11,590 --> 02:09:15,100
and fatten them up and then sell them to
otherwise that body,

2678
02:09:15,130 --> 02:09:15,530
you know,
the,

2679
02:09:15,531 --> 02:09:20,531
the,
the dead babies or whatever the fuck 

2680
02:09:20,531 --> 02:09:21,760
they feed them goes to waste the parts 
that we don't use for hamburger.

2681
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:23,140
And what have you goes to waste.

2682
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:26,880
And did you know,
I mean probably everyone knows this,

2683
02:09:26,881 --> 02:09:27,900
but you know,
in the,

2684
02:09:27,901 --> 02:09:31,350
in the world of egg raising chickens for
eggs,

2685
02:09:31,740 --> 02:09:36,740
uh,
all a male hatchlings get mashed up 

2686
02:09:36,740 --> 02:09:38,330
within a couple of days of being born.
Yeah.

2687
02:09:39,150 --> 02:09:40,250
Did you know that?
And then,

2688
02:09:40,270 --> 02:09:42,960
so this is about,
I don't know what the figure was like 10

2689
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:46,130
million baby chicks every year I went 
straight into meat grinders.

2690
02:09:46,131 --> 02:09:46,360
Yeah,

2691
02:09:46,690 --> 02:09:48,520
it's fucking crazy.
It's crazy.

2692
02:09:48,880 --> 02:09:53,880
It's really weird and hard to deal with.
It's hard to wrap your head around the 

2693
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:56,881
fact that people can detach so much from
what they're doing to do something like 

2694
02:09:57,101 --> 02:09:58,410
that.
It's uh,

2695
02:09:58,420 --> 02:09:59,550
it's just,
uh,

2696
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:02,890
to,
to take a person who knows what's.

2697
02:10:03,140 --> 02:10:04,660
I mean we have,
if you,

2698
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:08,800
if you did that in front of someone who 
you cared about,

2699
02:10:09,380 --> 02:10:12,910
you valued their opinion and you know,
you started feeding these,

2700
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:17,960
these chickens a torn up chickens.
He started giving a cow,

2701
02:10:18,521 --> 02:10:21,790
a cow brains and cow meat,
you know,

2702
02:10:21,791 --> 02:10:22,220
and,
and,

2703
02:10:22,221 --> 02:10:24,760
and mashing them up and feeding them to 
each other.

2704
02:10:24,761 --> 02:10:26,890
Like someone will go,
what the fuck are you doing,

2705
02:10:26,891 --> 02:10:27,940
man?
Why are you doing that?

2706
02:10:28,390 --> 02:10:30,700
Cows don't eat cows like,
what are you doing,

2707
02:10:30,701 --> 02:10:31,150
man?
Ah,

2708
02:10:31,190 --> 02:10:32,730
make us more money.
Oh Man.

2709
02:10:32,731 --> 02:10:34,370
He really.
That's how you.

2710
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:39,400
That's how you're going to be.
You're going to maximize your bottom 

2711
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:42,311
line.
They're going to feed them cow brains 

2712
02:10:42,311 --> 02:10:44,770
and they see the cows all shaky and 
fucked up because their neurological 

2713
02:10:44,770 --> 02:10:46,400
system is rejecting this.
This notion there,

2714
02:10:46,401 --> 02:10:48,230
they're rejecting the this practice and 
they're,

2715
02:10:48,470 --> 02:10:53,470
you know,
the nature actually has a whole system 

2716
02:10:53,470 --> 02:10:55,781
set in place to,
to sort of discouraged cannibalism and 

2717
02:10:55,781 --> 02:11:00,700
that's really what it is mean.
You cannibalize in nature fucks your 

2718
02:11:00,700 --> 02:11:02,060
immune,
your nervous system.

2719
02:11:03,130 --> 02:11:03,800
It's crazy.

2720
02:11:03,880 --> 02:11:05,010
Did you read about.
Anyway,

2721
02:11:05,090 --> 02:11:07,030
what I wanted to ask you about news 
radio though,

2722
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:12,040
because you may not know this,
but when I started out in a trying to 

2723
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:12,280
break into TV,
my f,

2724
02:11:12,670 --> 02:11:17,670
my first objective before I had my own 
show was to write for news radio and 

2725
02:11:18,221 --> 02:11:21,160
actually wrote a spec script and sent it
to Paul Simms.

2726
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:23,080
Ha Ha,
that's no kidding.

2727
02:11:24,190 --> 02:11:29,190
That's amazing.
You've got a meeting on the back of the 

2728
02:11:29,190 --> 02:11:31,231
script and it was sunset gower lot.
Ah,

2729
02:11:31,290 --> 02:11:36,290
yeah.
You remember where we were taping that 

2730
02:11:36,290 --> 02:11:38,670
and um,
in the end I went off to do my own 

2731
02:11:38,670 --> 02:11:38,670
thing.
Um,

2732
02:11:38,670 --> 02:11:39,250
but,
uh,

2733
02:11:39,370 --> 02:11:44,370
I just thought it was funny,
like all that was my dream was to back 

2734
02:11:44,370 --> 02:11:44,370
in the Phil Hartman days.

2735
02:11:44,740 --> 02:11:45,910
Wow.
That's incredible,

2736
02:11:45,911 --> 02:11:47,500
man.
That's incredible.

2737
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:49,240
Do you keep up with those guys at all?

2738
02:11:50,100 --> 02:11:51,330
Occasionally,
or just,

2739
02:11:51,331 --> 02:11:52,270
uh,
just to see.

2740
02:11:52,280 --> 02:11:55,470
He was communicating with someone who 
worked on the crew last night.

2741
02:11:55,471 --> 02:11:57,000
We were emailing each other back and 
forth.

2742
02:11:57,030 --> 02:11:59,040
Do you know what Sims is up to?
I don't know.

2743
02:11:59,041 --> 02:12:00,960
I think he's working on boardwalk 
empire.

2744
02:12:00,961 --> 02:12:03,750
That's why I had her as a writer,
is writing on boardwalk empire.

2745
02:12:04,110 --> 02:12:06,090
He's such a fascinating guy.
He's brilliant,

2746
02:12:06,091 --> 02:12:08,970
brilliant guy.
But just curiosity.

2747
02:12:08,971 --> 02:12:10,650
He was a real eccentric.

2748
02:12:11,270 --> 02:12:16,270
He'd come off.
So He'd worked at spy where I'd worked 

2749
02:12:16,270 --> 02:12:18,950
the magazine and,
and people kept saying that I looked 

2750
02:12:18,950 --> 02:12:20,060
like him and I and I,
I fixated on it and I thought,

2751
02:12:20,061 --> 02:12:21,830
wow.
He and everyone said,

2752
02:12:21,860 --> 02:12:26,860
oh,
he was so funny and he didn't stay very 

2753
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:26,860
long,
but he was so talented and he went on to

2754
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:29,720
do letterman and then from letterman he 
went to Larry Sanders and uh,

2755
02:12:29,721 --> 02:12:32,840
Larry Sanders at that time was viewed as
sort of the pinnacle of kind of smart,

2756
02:12:32,841 --> 02:12:34,070
funny TV.
And I thought,

2757
02:12:34,071 --> 02:12:36,380
wow,
if I could get on Larry Sanders,

2758
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:41,440
that would be amazing as a writer.
And then he went and started his own 

2759
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:41,440
show,
which was news radio.

2760
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:43,490
And I thought so,
well maybe that'll be a smart,

2761
02:12:43,491 --> 02:12:45,860
funny show as well.
That's what I should do.

2762
02:12:45,861 --> 02:12:49,040
So I wrote a script to winter,
but I remember going along there and,

2763
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:51,350
and all the windows were blacked out 
with,

2764
02:12:51,380 --> 02:12:53,650
with a tin foil,
with aluminum exit.

2765
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:54,680
Come along for a meeting.
I said,

2766
02:12:54,681 --> 02:12:55,190
what time?
He said,

2767
02:12:55,490 --> 02:12:57,710
well normally I get in around six in the
evening.

2768
02:12:58,100 --> 02:12:58,700
I thought,
Whoa,

2769
02:12:58,850 --> 02:13:00,740
CCS time,
people go home,

2770
02:13:00,741 --> 02:13:05,741
isn't it?
So I went along and he was hanging out 

2771
02:13:05,741 --> 02:13:05,741
with a,
a,

2772
02:13:05,741 --> 02:13:05,741
like a,
there was a,

2773
02:13:05,741 --> 02:13:08,300
I'm a runner or pa or something called 
spider,

2774
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:10,940
spider,
spider.

2775
02:13:10,941 --> 02:13:12,410
And he's like,
what kind of music do you like?

2776
02:13:12,411 --> 02:13:13,910
And I'm like,
if this is this,

2777
02:13:13,911 --> 02:13:18,911
the interview,
like he's asking me what kind of music 

2778
02:13:18,911 --> 02:13:18,911
and then I just,
I thought it was just weird,

2779
02:13:18,911 --> 02:13:21,230
like there was.
So there was no sense of night or day.

2780
02:13:21,890 --> 02:13:24,280
No natural light windows all blocked 
out.

2781
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:29,300
He's hanging with spider.
I just thought this is kind of the 

2782
02:13:29,300 --> 02:13:29,300
spider.
I was getting kind of slight,

2783
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:31,410
very faint cult vibes.

2784
02:13:31,850 --> 02:13:33,970
I was like,
there's a little lag going on.

2785
02:13:33,971 --> 02:13:34,470
But in a good

2786
02:13:35,380 --> 02:13:37,310
they um,
they would work all night.

2787
02:13:37,370 --> 02:13:39,020
And those were his hours.
I.

2788
02:13:39,021 --> 02:13:44,021
Yeah.
Well he knew everyone had to fit in 

2789
02:13:44,021 --> 02:13:44,021
around that.
Yes.

2790
02:13:44,021 --> 02:13:44,030
If you had a family or something like 
that,

2791
02:13:44,031 --> 02:13:45,970
you were fucked because they would do a 
writing.

2792
02:13:45,980 --> 02:13:47,310
But that didn't affect you,
right?

2793
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:48,800
No,
it didn't affect us at all.

2794
02:13:48,980 --> 02:13:53,980
The actors.
Well there's sort of union rules for 

2795
02:13:53,980 --> 02:13:54,470
actors.
They couldn't make us start work at 2:00

2796
02:13:54,471 --> 02:13:56,670
in the morning feed to be like,
you were a writer.

2797
02:13:56,720 --> 02:13:57,590
Then you turn on.
He's like,

2798
02:13:57,591 --> 02:13:58,050
yeah,
the,

2799
02:13:58,070 --> 02:14:01,400
that we work from six in the evening 
till four in the morning.

2800
02:14:01,401 --> 02:14:02,830
And we,
uh,

2801
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:05,600
we like to hang out with spider and we 
basically,

2802
02:14:05,601 --> 02:14:09,140
we all play Yahtzee for a couple of 
hours and then we worked for half.

2803
02:14:09,170 --> 02:14:10,340
I mean,
it wasn't literally that,

2804
02:14:10,341 --> 02:14:11,510
but it was Kinda like,
oh my God,

2805
02:14:11,511 --> 02:14:16,511
it's like that episode of the twilight 
zone where the kid is in charge of the 

2806
02:14:16,511 --> 02:14:16,511
family

2807
02:14:16,511 --> 02:14:16,511
and they're all like,
oh,

2808
02:14:18,310 --> 02:14:19,030
well he had a method,

2809
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:20,930
his madness and the message of Bhutan 
this,

2810
02:14:20,970 --> 02:14:25,970
you're very talented.
But the method to his madness was that 

2811
02:14:25,970 --> 02:14:28,280
you get silly when you are a sleep 
deficit mode when you're really,

2812
02:14:28,810 --> 02:14:33,810
you're really late and tired.
And oftentimes that's when the most 

2813
02:14:33,810 --> 02:14:33,810
preposterous ideas are allowed to come.

2814
02:14:33,810 --> 02:14:36,240
That was his theory.
Well that was the practice.

2815
02:14:36,330 --> 02:14:37,610
I mean it really did work.
He didn't,

2816
02:14:37,611 --> 02:14:39,360
but it was that way.
In other words,

2817
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:42,540
did he articulate that or was that he 
oftenly articulated it.

2818
02:14:42,570 --> 02:14:43,380
Yeah.
So it was.

2819
02:14:43,381 --> 02:14:45,840
But it's Kinda like Vanna earhart saying
like,

2820
02:14:46,020 --> 02:14:48,990
after you stayed awake for 48 hours in,
peed your pants,

2821
02:14:48,991 --> 02:14:51,300
then you have an enlightenment 
experience.

2822
02:14:51,540 --> 02:14:52,350
Well,
sort of.

2823
02:14:52,470 --> 02:14:54,240
But maybe there's another way of doing 
it.

2824
02:14:54,270 --> 02:14:56,460
They were definitely,
in a lot of ways,

2825
02:14:56,461 --> 02:14:58,830
there were definitely lazy.
Can I tell you,

2826
02:14:58,831 --> 02:15:03,750
my theory is that like if you haven't 
made a creative breakthrough by 6:00

2827
02:15:03,780 --> 02:15:05,460
in the evening,
then hey,

2828
02:15:05,461 --> 02:15:10,461
why don't you go home and have a good 
night's sleep and try again the next 

2829
02:15:10,461 --> 02:15:10,461
morning?
Well,

2830
02:15:10,461 --> 02:15:12,990
I think they liked the idea of working 
under the

2831
02:15:13,070 --> 02:15:18,070
wire as well.
I think they would oftentimes deliver 

2832
02:15:18,070 --> 02:15:21,211
the script for the run through,
like we had to run through in the 

2833
02:15:21,211 --> 02:15:21,211
morning or a table read.
Um,

2834
02:15:21,211 --> 02:15:22,900
so if the table.
It was Monday morning,

2835
02:15:22,901 --> 02:15:25,530
Sunday night,
they would still be working.

2836
02:15:25,690 --> 02:15:27,580
If we had to be at the table read at 
9:00

2837
02:15:27,580 --> 02:15:29,260
AM,
they will be writing at 8:00

2838
02:15:29,260 --> 02:15:31,600
AM.
Like sometimes we would get,

2839
02:15:31,720 --> 02:15:33,500
we would,
we'd go to rehearse,

2840
02:15:33,501 --> 02:15:36,790
we'd have no table read and we would 
wind up rehearsing the first,

2841
02:15:36,850 --> 02:15:37,660
uh,
the first,

2842
02:15:37,710 --> 02:15:39,850
like five pages.
That's all they had.

2843
02:15:40,080 --> 02:15:41,770
I mean,
we wouldn't have a full script.

2844
02:15:42,010 --> 02:15:45,070
We'd have five pages.
And then while we were rehearsing,

2845
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:50,280
you know,
Josh Lee would come stumbling down 

2846
02:15:50,280 --> 02:15:50,280
barefoot.
His hair would be all fucked up,

2847
02:15:50,280 --> 02:15:51,190
be smoking a cigarette.
Uh,

2848
02:15:51,191 --> 02:15:52,120
here's,
um,

2849
02:15:52,210 --> 02:15:57,210
here's the next 20 pages and you know,
the next x amount of pages and we would 

2850
02:15:57,210 --> 02:15:59,050
go over that and then the next day they 
would.

2851
02:15:59,470 --> 02:16:02,140
But it always came together as a really 
solid

2852
02:16:02,820 --> 02:16:07,820
theory.
Like Michael Moore was a little like 

2853
02:16:07,820 --> 02:16:08,970
that too.
It was the feeling that unless your guts

2854
02:16:08,971 --> 02:16:10,500
are on the floor,
you know,

2855
02:16:10,740 --> 02:16:15,570
then there's a chance you might have 
been able to improve it with more work.

2856
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:20,600
Do you know what I mean?
Like stay late and worry and worry and 

2857
02:16:20,600 --> 02:16:23,450
worry and stay late and work on the 
weekends until you just despair and you 

2858
02:16:23,450 --> 02:16:25,590
just think I can't give anything more to
the process.

2859
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:27,210
Well,
everybody has their own method,

2860
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:29,130
you know,
as far as the creative process.

2861
02:16:29,170 --> 02:16:30,060
And I'm

2862
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:31,780
not saying that their method was the 
best,

2863
02:16:31,781 --> 02:16:36,350
but it was fun for them and part of what
the young family,

2864
02:16:36,460 --> 02:16:39,250
they're all single.
There's a few guys that were family guys

2865
02:16:39,251 --> 02:16:41,110
that had real issues and wound up 
leaving,

2866
02:16:41,170 --> 02:16:45,160
but they were,
they were having fun and that having fun

2867
02:16:45,161 --> 02:16:50,161
led them to be funnier.
And I think whether or not it was a 

2868
02:16:50,770 --> 02:16:53,140
consequence of their laziness,
that it was so good,

2869
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:55,690
or whether it was a,
there was a method to their madness.

2870
02:16:55,691 --> 02:17:00,691
I mean you would really have to take 
that up with Paul and he would have to 

2871
02:17:00,691 --> 02:17:01,240
really soul search to find the actual 
correct answer.

2872
02:17:01,600 --> 02:17:03,880
But it worked.
It really worked.

2873
02:17:03,881 --> 02:17:06,820
And it was an amazing cost as well.
Like it was you,

2874
02:17:06,850 --> 02:17:11,850
Stephen Root,
who I always thought was super back to 

2875
02:17:11,850 --> 02:17:11,850
very,
very awesome actor,

2876
02:17:11,910 --> 02:17:16,910
Dave Foley,
to one of the secret producers of that 

2877
02:17:16,910 --> 02:17:16,910
show.

2878
02:17:16,910 --> 02:17:20,820
I mean,
I've had dave on the podcast before and 

2879
02:17:20,820 --> 02:17:20,820
I'd love that guy to death.
He's so fucking talented.

2880
02:17:20,820 --> 02:17:24,820
And if you ever want to hear one of the 
worst divorce stories of all time,

2881
02:17:24,850 --> 02:17:29,850
listen to the podcast with him on and 
just what kind of a nightmare divorce 

2882
02:17:29,850 --> 02:17:31,090
can be ruined his life.
Wow.

2883
02:17:31,680 --> 02:17:36,680
I'm doing.
I'm researching a story at the moment 

2884
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:36,680
about divorce.
Oh God.

2885
02:17:36,680 --> 02:17:38,320
Listen to the podcast with Dave Foley 
because Canada has some wacky laws.

2886
02:17:38,380 --> 02:17:38,770
Oh,
well,

2887
02:17:38,771 --> 02:17:40,230
I want to do it in La.
That does it.

2888
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:42,010
Well.
He lives in La now,

2889
02:17:42,310 --> 02:17:44,350
but when he got divorced in Canada or 
here?

2890
02:17:44,380 --> 02:17:45,550
Yes,
Canada.

2891
02:17:45,750 --> 02:17:46,390
Really?
Yeah.

2892
02:17:46,391 --> 02:17:51,391
I was married in Canada and Canada has 
some crazy laws where the wife has 

2893
02:17:51,391 --> 02:17:53,320
access to the bank account for a full 
year,

2894
02:17:53,620 --> 02:17:57,220
a while you're getting divorced,
you're not allowed to get divorced until

2895
02:17:57,221 --> 02:18:02,221
you're separated for a year or at the 
time this was the and they also have 

2896
02:18:02,221 --> 02:18:06,691
like insane laws as far as like the 
amount of child support you're supposed 

2897
02:18:06,691 --> 02:18:06,691
to pay.

2898
02:18:06,691 --> 02:18:10,290
His child support was based on the 
highest income he had ever made in his 

2899
02:18:10,290 --> 02:18:10,290
life and unbelievably unrealistic.
Some.

2900
02:18:10,290 --> 02:18:12,640
It was the height of his career when he 
was on news radio,

2901
02:18:12,641 --> 02:18:17,641
so he's making an extraordinary amount 
of money and that that was what his 

2902
02:18:17,641 --> 02:18:19,660
child support was based on,
so he had to pay that for the 18 years.

2903
02:18:19,661 --> 02:18:24,661
His children were alive and it was all 
going to his wife and his wife was 

2904
02:18:24,661 --> 02:18:26,230
redecorating the fucking house and begin
to hate her.

2905
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:27,430
Oh yeah.
Oh God.

2906
02:18:27,431 --> 02:18:28,530
Yeah.
So don't you like that?

2907
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:32,230
I just love that whole dynamic is very 
strange.

2908
02:18:32,770 --> 02:18:34,630
Love someone.
You love them so much.

2909
02:18:34,631 --> 02:18:39,631
You're willing to sign a legal contract 
with them and then they become your 

2910
02:18:39,631 --> 02:18:42,841
sworn enemy,
and of course obviously I've dealt with 

2911
02:18:42,841 --> 02:18:43,720
that with Phil Hartman in his wife or 
his wife,

2912
02:18:43,721 --> 02:18:47,140
shot him in his sleep and then there was
still together though they had when they

2913
02:18:47,141 --> 02:18:52,141
were getting broken up,
but they were living together but 

2914
02:18:52,141 --> 02:18:52,141
separated.

2915
02:18:52,141 --> 02:18:52,360
They were living together,
but he was leaving.

2916
02:18:52,390 --> 02:18:53,320
He was breakup.
He,

2917
02:18:53,410 --> 02:18:57,070
they had gone through some.
They had broken up and you know,

2918
02:18:57,200 --> 02:19:02,200
he had,
he had a boat and slept in his boat for 

2919
02:19:02,200 --> 02:19:05,281
a while and then came back to her and 
wanted to keep the family together and 

2920
02:19:05,281 --> 02:19:06,850
was trying hard to kids.
Yes,

2921
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:07,760
yes.
Very.

2922
02:19:07,910 --> 02:19:09,230
So,
you know,

2923
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:14,520
when people just are committed in that 
sort of a situation where they have to 

2924
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:18,250
stay or if they do stay,
it's devastating to their lifestyle,

2925
02:19:18,251 --> 02:19:21,390
devastating to their emotional state.
You know,

2926
02:19:21,391 --> 02:19:26,391
it's,
it's very troubling and very scary when 

2927
02:19:26,391 --> 02:19:26,500
they started attacking each other as 
well.

2928
02:19:26,530 --> 02:19:28,070
When they know they go after each

2929
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:29,540
other to try to hurt that person.

2930
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:31,190
Did you get on with Andy Dick?

2931
02:19:31,660 --> 02:19:36,130
I got on occasionally with Andy.
We had a love hate sort of a situation.

2932
02:19:36,340 --> 02:19:38,710
He to this day maintains.
It was all my fault.

2933
02:19:38,830 --> 02:19:42,280
He was so angry.
You're always angry.

2934
02:19:42,530 --> 02:19:46,360
White Guy was pulling his dick out in 
front of me and jerking off my trailer.

2935
02:19:46,361 --> 02:19:48,790
When my girlfriend was in there,
he would show up,

2936
02:19:48,791 --> 02:19:51,490
so fucked up.
He couldn't read the script and he would

2937
02:19:51,491 --> 02:19:54,460
forget his kid and leave them on set,
but on the other hand,

2938
02:19:54,970 --> 02:19:56,790
incredibly talented.
Very funny,

2939
02:19:57,340 --> 02:20:00,880
funny.
I had more laughs like rehearsing scenes

2940
02:20:00,881 --> 02:20:04,600
with that guy and doing scenes in fact 
guy than anybody in my life.

2941
02:20:04,810 --> 02:20:07,690
He's an unbelievably talented guy.
Deep down inside.

2942
02:20:07,720 --> 02:20:10,180
He's a sweet guy,
but he's very troubled.

2943
02:20:10,210 --> 02:20:14,890
He doesn't even remember his childhood,
like he's missing like up until like,

2944
02:20:15,790 --> 02:20:18,100
like before,
like age seven or something like that.

2945
02:20:18,310 --> 02:20:21,220
He literally doesn't remember it.
He was adopted.

2946
02:20:21,220 --> 02:20:23,020
Locked it out.
Yes.

2947
02:20:23,320 --> 02:20:25,180
He's had some.
He had some hard times,

2948
02:20:25,420 --> 02:20:26,020
you know,
I mean,

2949
02:20:26,021 --> 02:20:30,160
you don't create a guy like Andy Dick 
because everything turns out perfect.

2950
02:20:30,270 --> 02:20:32,890
You know,
he's the product of a lot of angst and a

2951
02:20:32,891 --> 02:20:35,350
lot of issues and a lot of what have 
you.

2952
02:20:35,351 --> 02:20:37,280
But the,
you know,

2953
02:20:37,420 --> 02:20:40,240
looking at the glass half full,
he's a brilliant guy,

2954
02:20:40,270 --> 02:20:45,270
brilliant,
brilliant comedic actor and it disturbs 

2955
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:45,650
me when I see him go off and,
you know,

2956
02:20:45,670 --> 02:20:49,030
he was sober when he did my podcast,
we talked about it and you know,

2957
02:20:49,090 --> 02:20:54,090
but then six months later he was 
arrested for doing this and that and 

2958
02:20:54,090 --> 02:20:55,210
getting crazy and doing drugs and you 
know,

2959
02:20:55,211 --> 02:20:58,660
he's just a real,
constantly troubled guy for a variety of

2960
02:20:58,661 --> 02:21:00,820
reasons,
but at his best,

2961
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:03,730
one of the most brilliant comic actors 
ever.

2962
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:08,760
I think it was fucking hilarious.
So funny in that that show news radio 

2963
02:21:08,801 --> 02:21:12,160
just really figured out how to utilize 
him.

2964
02:21:12,370 --> 02:21:17,370
Very much so.
And we were very different people back 

2965
02:21:17,370 --> 02:21:17,370
there.
I was very different.

2966
02:21:17,370 --> 02:21:17,800
I was much younger,
stupider,

2967
02:21:17,801 --> 02:21:22,801
angry or version of who I am now.
And I wasn't very tolerant of people 

2968
02:21:22,801 --> 02:21:24,130
like Andy.
It's easier for me to snap at.

2969
02:21:24,131 --> 02:21:25,000
Um,
and you know,

2970
02:21:25,001 --> 02:21:25,430
I,
I,

2971
02:21:25,470 --> 02:21:29,350
I'm sure I would handle him much 
different now if we ever did,

2972
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:30,580
if we will,
you know,

2973
02:21:30,581 --> 02:21:33,550
if I was thrusted in that same situation
with my current personality.

2974
02:21:33,551 --> 02:21:36,340
But that said,
you know,

2975
02:21:36,430 --> 02:21:37,180
brilliant.
Brilliant.

2976
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:40,270
Is that show still on in syndication?
Does that still.

2977
02:21:40,350 --> 02:21:42,840
Oh,
you just don't get money from it.

2978
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:44,700
I'm not sure.
It's not much.

2979
02:21:44,701 --> 02:21:48,780
I'm sure it was one of those things,
the initial payment,

2980
02:21:48,781 --> 02:21:50,850
you get a chunk and then it gets less 
over time.

2981
02:21:51,030 --> 02:21:51,720
It's one of those things.

2982
02:21:51,850 --> 02:21:53,510
Um,
I reached out a little bit too,

2983
02:21:53,511 --> 02:21:58,511
Andy Dick last year because we were,
we were trying to make a bunch of shows 

2984
02:21:58,511 --> 02:22:00,130
that we'll all set in la since I was 
living here.

2985
02:22:00,131 --> 02:22:01,100
The idea was,
you know,

2986
02:22:01,101 --> 02:22:06,101
let's do sort of La stories and one of 
them was going to be standup comedians 

2987
02:22:06,350 --> 02:22:11,350
and,
and we were trying to find intriguing 

2988
02:22:11,350 --> 02:22:14,481
guys,
your guys who sort of represented 

2989
02:22:14,481 --> 02:22:15,130
something about.
I couldn't quite figure out what it was,

2990
02:22:15,131 --> 02:22:18,850
but I thought it was something to do 
with the pressure on someone who's who's

2991
02:22:18,851 --> 02:22:20,920
their own producer,
their own writer,

2992
02:22:20,930 --> 02:22:25,930
their own performer and whose,
whose performance is the performance of 

2993
02:22:25,930 --> 02:22:29,401
themselves or a version of themselves 
that and that that entailed a certain 

2994
02:22:29,401 --> 02:22:33,171
kind of vulnerability and a kind of high
stakes professional maneuver that you go

2995
02:22:33,241 --> 02:22:38,241
on stage and it's just you and a crowd 
of people and whether you might face 

2996
02:22:38,241 --> 02:22:43,221
heckling and whatnot.
So that was how I formulated it in my 

2997
02:22:43,221 --> 02:22:46,671
head and also that you might be 
cannibalizing your own life to some 

2998
02:22:46,671 --> 02:22:49,911
extent to a material and whether that 
imposed a certain set of strains and 

2999
02:22:51,271 --> 02:22:56,271
whether being funny itself came from 
some angst or something in your 

3000
02:22:56,271 --> 02:22:56,271
background.
Anyway,

3001
02:22:56,271 --> 02:23:00,981
so that was how I forgot,
but it was very hard for us to kind of 

3002
02:23:00,981 --> 02:23:01,800
find the right people.
So it's sort of.

3003
02:23:01,840 --> 02:23:05,730
We reached out to Andy and a few other 
people and he always said like,

3004
02:23:05,731 --> 02:23:06,590
I really want to film with you.

3005
02:23:06,820 --> 02:23:07,900
Oh yeah,
that's perfect.

3006
02:23:07,901 --> 02:23:09,640
I'd love to do something.
Light that out.

3007
02:23:09,940 --> 02:23:14,940
You can meet me after the show and then 
he'd never show up or we were just not 

3008
02:23:14,940 --> 02:23:18,691
the best example.
You would want to get a guy that's 

3009
02:23:18,691 --> 02:23:18,820
actually a writer.
It actually does write a lot and perform

3010
02:23:18,821 --> 02:23:23,821
a lot,
but he doesn't build burger would be 

3011
02:23:23,821 --> 02:23:24,280
good.
But Andy does his own material,

3012
02:23:24,281 --> 02:23:26,560
right?
Yeah,

3013
02:23:26,561 --> 02:23:28,000
I'm sure.
But you know,

3014
02:23:28,001 --> 02:23:29,850
you want to call it comedy,
right?

3015
02:23:29,890 --> 02:23:31,590
That was the thing like it wasn't.
Is it,

3016
02:23:31,690 --> 02:23:34,450
is it,
is it actually comedy?

3017
02:23:34,451 --> 02:23:36,400
That's the mean.
It's funny sometimes,

3018
02:23:36,401 --> 02:23:41,401
but it's also out there and kind of what
just sort of blurts well sometimes and 

3019
02:23:41,401 --> 02:23:43,360
sometimes he prepares things and you 
know,

3020
02:23:43,390 --> 02:23:45,190
I mean,
but I think he's a very,

3021
02:23:45,430 --> 02:23:47,290
what I'm trying to say without.
I'm not trying to dis him,

3022
02:23:47,291 --> 02:23:52,291
I'm just saying that his style,
if you were on it to find a standup 

3023
02:23:52,291 --> 02:23:55,740
comedian,
you wouldn't necessarily categorize him 

3024
02:23:55,740 --> 02:23:58,621
as a standup comedian.
You would categorize him as a performer 

3025
02:23:58,621 --> 02:23:58,621
who occasionally works in standup comedy
clubs.

3026
02:23:59,530 --> 02:24:01,960
So that's a good way of,
of looking at it.

3027
02:24:01,961 --> 02:24:03,970
And that may have been one of the.
But you know,

3028
02:24:04,280 --> 02:24:09,280
in the,
in our sort of a keenness to eagerness 

3029
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:13,651
to get intriguing people,
w we perhaps stretched the categories a 

3030
02:24:13,651 --> 02:24:16,510
bit in a way that wasn't helpful and 
that may have been a clue that it wasn't

3031
02:24:16,511 --> 02:24:21,511
quite the right story.
Or do you think there is a good 

3032
02:24:21,511 --> 02:24:22,450
documentary to be made?
It felt like when I was doing it,

3033
02:24:22,451 --> 02:24:24,670
it felt like the world was not.
Dis,

3034
02:24:24,730 --> 02:24:27,100
was too close to my own world in an odd 
way.

3035
02:24:27,380 --> 02:24:32,380
Um,
well there's certainly something to 

3036
02:24:32,380 --> 02:24:33,740
describing standup comedy mean it's sort
of kind of has been done in a way,

3037
02:24:34,460 --> 02:24:39,110
in some ways I guess has it.
I am comic.

3038
02:24:39,111 --> 02:24:44,111
I did,
I watched them all now they didn't get 

3039
02:24:44,111 --> 02:24:44,111
it.
I mean,

3040
02:24:44,111 --> 02:24:44,930
they're all,
they've all got their moments,

3041
02:24:44,931 --> 02:24:46,580
but it's almost like,
um,

3042
02:24:46,670 --> 02:24:48,920
what about Jerry Seinfeld's documented 
that best one?

3043
02:24:49,070 --> 02:24:50,300
Yeah,
that was a really good one.

3044
02:24:50,900 --> 02:24:54,890
He was really open about the creative 
process showed well,

3045
02:24:54,950 --> 02:24:58,940
I think one was kind of used there to 
make Jerry look a lot more likable.

3046
02:24:59,510 --> 02:25:04,510
I mean,
there's a reason why they chose Origami 

3047
02:25:04,510 --> 02:25:04,510
in the middle of like his struggle and 
angst.

3048
02:25:04,510 --> 02:25:05,200
You know,
one,

3049
02:25:05,210 --> 02:25:07,430
I know very little,
very little,

3050
02:25:07,650 --> 02:25:10,700
you know him from that and I've had a 
few,

3051
02:25:10,701 --> 02:25:12,950
hi,
how are you doing in real life?

3052
02:25:12,951 --> 02:25:15,980
But I almost felt like he was kind of 
thrust into that situation.

3053
02:25:16,640 --> 02:25:21,050
He seems like quite troubled in that 
documentary and it's almost like they're

3054
02:25:21,051 --> 02:25:22,880
putting them in there to make Jerry 
look,

3055
02:25:23,830 --> 02:25:25,360
you know,
like in comparison to,

3056
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:26,530
to Jerry,
you know,

3057
02:25:26,531 --> 02:25:29,280
he's fucking crazy and it makes Gerry,
Luke,

3058
02:25:29,281 --> 02:25:31,300
luke,
this really likable,

3059
02:25:31,360 --> 02:25:34,010
affable,
sort of together do right.

3060
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:36,400
Well not,
not that I don't think Jerry is,

3061
02:25:36,460 --> 02:25:39,430
but I think I just found it weird that 
they would choose that guy.

3062
02:25:39,790 --> 02:25:44,790
Like why would they choose that guy out 
of all the comedians in New York City 

3063
02:25:44,790 --> 02:25:48,300
who was like,
he liked a certain level of self 

3064
02:25:48,300 --> 02:25:48,300
knowledge.
Yes.

3065
02:25:48,300 --> 02:25:50,050
Which I think made him a spectacle.
Yes.

3066
02:25:50,051 --> 02:25:52,150
A spectacles and excellent way of 
putting it.

3067
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:53,230
Yeah.
He,

3068
02:25:53,231 --> 02:25:54,580
uh,
yeah,

3069
02:25:54,581 --> 02:25:58,110
he's fucked in that documentary least.
I don't know,

3070
02:25:58,280 --> 02:26:00,190
you know,
but it's just,

3071
02:26:00,700 --> 02:26:02,320
you know,
comedy is a tricky thing,

3072
02:26:02,321 --> 02:26:03,250
man.
You know,

3073
02:26:03,490 --> 02:26:06,940
it's um,
a very bizarre art form where you,

3074
02:26:07,870 --> 02:26:10,090
there's so many different types of 
comedy.

3075
02:26:10,090 --> 02:26:12,520
There's so many different styles of 
comedy,

3076
02:26:12,521 --> 02:26:17,521
there's so many different ways you can 
go about it and you're the only one who 

3077
02:26:17,521 --> 02:26:18,160
really knows your best way and you have 
to find it.

3078
02:26:18,161 --> 02:26:19,990
And the only way you find it,
it's in front of an audience,

3079
02:26:20,360 --> 02:26:23,920
one of the few art forms that you 
require other people's input.

3080
02:26:24,430 --> 02:26:27,940
You require them to be there while 
you're creating it.

3081
02:26:28,060 --> 02:26:32,530
You write on your own.
I write all my stuff on either I write,

3082
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:37,680
either I have an idea and I write down 
notes or actually physically sit in 

3083
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:41,491
front of the keyboard and I write long 
form and then cherry pick ideas out of 

3084
02:26:41,491 --> 02:26:43,520
those long forms and introduce it.
But they don't.

3085
02:26:43,570 --> 02:26:46,240
It doesn't really come alive unless you 
do it in front of an audience.

3086
02:26:46,270 --> 02:26:51,270
If I approached you,
I don't think we did because I'd 

3087
02:26:51,270 --> 02:26:51,730
remember,
but if I had approached you to be in the

3088
02:26:51,731 --> 02:26:52,600
documentary,
what,

3089
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:54,400
what would've been your thought process?

3090
02:26:54,730 --> 02:26:57,700
That it would probably be intrusive?
That didn't really.

3091
02:26:57,820 --> 02:27:02,820
I probably wouldn't be interested.
I would be the plus side of it wouldn't,

3092
02:27:04,410 --> 02:27:09,410
it would seem like I would have to pay 
attention to all this and there's 

3093
02:27:09,410 --> 02:27:13,741
something about observing something and 
filming something and recording 

3094
02:27:13,741 --> 02:27:15,580
something which changes the nature of 
the thing itself.

3095
02:27:16,030 --> 02:27:17,140
And I think that,
uh,

3096
02:27:17,170 --> 02:27:22,170
in standup comedy,
what's really important to me when I'm 

3097
02:27:22,170 --> 02:27:24,811
creating it especially is just getting 
it right is like working on it and 

3098
02:27:24,811 --> 02:27:29,461
getting it right.
I wouldn't want cameras there and 

3099
02:27:29,461 --> 02:27:31,240
observing the whole process of it.
Then I would have to think about that as

3100
02:27:31,241 --> 02:27:33,160
me.
And where do you write when you write?

3101
02:27:33,550 --> 02:27:35,320
I write at home.
So if it's on the road,

3102
02:27:36,310 --> 02:27:38,080
which I know it sounds like we're not 
going to,

3103
02:27:38,081 --> 02:27:40,390
but if I was saying like,
Joe,

3104
02:27:40,391 --> 02:27:41,920
where do you write this is your room?

3105
02:27:41,920 --> 02:27:45,040
Can we see a notebook,
a re read?

3106
02:27:45,190 --> 02:27:47,230
Can you read out some of the.
I wouldn't do that.

3107
02:27:47,620 --> 02:27:52,620
No,
I'm just sort of tell you about what my 

3108
02:27:52,620 --> 02:27:55,591
processes.
But I wouldn't want and I don't even 

3109
02:27:55,591 --> 02:27:59,371
like people like filming things at my 
shows and I'm working on shit because I 

3110
02:27:59,371 --> 02:28:00,670
don't want to getting on Youtube or 
whatever.

3111
02:28:00,671 --> 02:28:02,110
It's not done.
It's like,

3112
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:04,470
you know,
it's a sketch and then if,

3113
02:28:04,610 --> 02:28:08,770
if that gets on youtube and then someone
sees it like three months later and it's

3114
02:28:08,771 --> 02:28:11,350
better,
they still know where it's going.

3115
02:28:11,620 --> 02:28:14,440
Like part of comedy is you want new 
stuff.

3116
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:17,200
When you go to see a band,
you go to see the rolling stones.

3117
02:28:17,201 --> 02:28:19,030
Do you want to hear new rollingstone 
songs?

3118
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:21,400
Fuck No.
You want to hear the classics?

3119
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:24,860
You want to hear sympathy for the devil.
You want to hear satisfaction.

3120
02:28:24,861 --> 02:28:27,770
You want to hear the songs you already 
know that you can relate to.

3121
02:28:28,120 --> 02:28:31,190
Comedy is the exact opposite.
You want to always hear new stuff.

3122
02:28:31,460 --> 02:28:36,460
Like I have a standup comedy special 
that premiered on comedy central Friday 

3123
02:28:36,460 --> 02:28:38,750
night and one of the points that I've 
made in advertising,

3124
02:28:38,751 --> 02:28:42,830
all these current shows that I'm doing 
is it's all new material.

3125
02:28:42,860 --> 02:28:47,860
Like if you saw the thing from Saturday 
to Saturday night or Friday night that 

3126
02:28:47,860 --> 02:28:48,770
aired.
If you go see me live next week,

3127
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:50,330
you're not gonna see any of that 
material.

3128
02:28:50,331 --> 02:28:51,890
The materials done,
it's gone,

3129
02:28:52,010 --> 02:28:54,050
throw it away.
It's filmed,

3130
02:28:54,051 --> 02:28:59,051
it's out there and the Internet and the 
ether and comedy central and it's there 

3131
02:28:59,051 --> 02:29:00,920
forever.
But what I do on stage now,

3132
02:29:00,930 --> 02:29:01,850
Amanda,
new stuff.

3133
02:29:02,030 --> 02:29:07,030
So I don't,
I don't want my process to be a part of 

3134
02:29:07,030 --> 02:29:09,860
what's like record because it's not done
like get it,

3135
02:29:09,980 --> 02:29:14,980
you know,
and that's why we didn't do it in the 

3136
02:29:14,980 --> 02:29:15,410
end because I,
that's a very understandable reaction.

3137
02:29:15,510 --> 02:29:16,280
I don't know,
don't see,

3138
02:29:16,281 --> 02:29:21,281
we would have got that across the board,
but I think you could describe the 

3139
02:29:21,281 --> 02:29:21,620
process of.
I would describe it,

3140
02:29:21,621 --> 02:29:23,170
but it's boring.
That's not,

3141
02:29:23,330 --> 02:29:24,980
that's not a TV.
It's not something I could,

3142
02:29:25,010 --> 02:29:27,430
I could document and know.
And then.

3143
02:29:27,770 --> 02:29:31,520
So we figured it's too much work.
Like why?

3144
02:29:31,521 --> 02:29:33,740
Um,
it takes away from the finished product.

3145
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:38,760
Yeah.
I think when you know the whole process 

3146
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:38,760
behind it,
it's,

3147
02:29:38,760 --> 02:29:41,930
I mean,
for someone who's like a comedy nerd or 

3148
02:29:41,930 --> 02:29:42,260
a Dork or.
But I say that in all loving terms,

3149
02:29:42,261 --> 02:29:47,261
like there's comedy nerds that like come
to like dozens and dozens and dozens of 

3150
02:29:47,261 --> 02:29:50,390
shows every month and they'll,
they'll have seen me three or four times

3151
02:29:50,420 --> 02:29:53,600
in a period of three or four months.
I've had people come up to me and say,

3152
02:29:53,601 --> 02:29:58,601
I love watching the material grow.
I think it's amazing watching you add 

3153
02:29:58,601 --> 02:29:59,690
new bits to it or come up with new 
things.

3154
02:29:59,690 --> 02:30:04,690
And I'm always uncomfortable about that 
because then the last thing you want to 

3155
02:30:04,690 --> 02:30:08,591
do is see someone in the front row two 
nights in a row like that happens.

3156
02:30:08,780 --> 02:30:13,780
Like you'll see someone like you'll be 
in Portland for the weekend and you see 

3157
02:30:13,780 --> 02:30:15,710
a person in the front row Friday and 
then their Saturday to you like,

3158
02:30:15,711 --> 02:30:18,540
shit,
this guy knows all my fucking jokes that

3159
02:30:18,541 --> 02:30:23,541
you know they know all the set.
So you feel artificial when you're 

3160
02:30:23,541 --> 02:30:26,771
setting up the bits.
You would like people to see your bits 

3161
02:30:26,771 --> 02:30:30,110
when there is close to done as possible.
When there close to the finished form as

3162
02:30:30,111 --> 02:30:31,850
possible.
That way you're going to get.

3163
02:30:31,851 --> 02:30:35,360
They're going to get the best show.
You have the best economy of words,

3164
02:30:35,361 --> 02:30:37,730
you have the best manipulation of 
language,

3165
02:30:37,731 --> 02:30:41,270
the best setup segues,
all that stuff has been fleshed out.

3166
02:30:41,271 --> 02:30:44,300
It's been worked out on stage,
countless hours,

3167
02:30:44,450 --> 02:30:47,270
examining notes,
listening to recordings,

3168
02:30:47,271 --> 02:30:48,140
and then performing.

3169
02:30:48,260 --> 02:30:53,260
That's what you want.
You want people to get the show at its 

3170
02:30:53,260 --> 02:30:53,260
best,
you know,

3171
02:30:53,260 --> 02:30:57,810
and which is why when someone releases a
special like right after the release of 

3172
02:30:57,810 --> 02:31:01,481
special,
it's oftentimes not the best time to go 

3173
02:31:01,481 --> 02:31:03,431
see them because the material is like 
fucking scattered and they're trying to 

3174
02:31:03,431 --> 02:31:06,491
put it all together and then you see the
same person six months later and it's 

3175
02:31:06,491 --> 02:31:07,190
just fucking just boom,
boom,

3176
02:31:07,191 --> 02:31:08,540
boom.
It all comes together,

3177
02:31:09,190 --> 02:31:14,190
you know,
so it's a long sort of a brutal process 

3178
02:31:14,190 --> 02:31:14,430
but exciting,
you know,

3179
02:31:14,900 --> 02:31:18,950
it's challenging and you know,
and it's got a lot of downs to it,

3180
02:31:19,290 --> 02:31:21,360
but the ops are awesome when it's done

3181
02:31:23,890 --> 02:31:24,520
in a nutshell,

3182
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:27,780
I feel like we've made the documentary.
That was great.

3183
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:30,540
I want to talk to you about scientology.
Okay.

3184
02:31:30,690 --> 02:31:35,690
What is the,
the issue that you're having in trying 

3185
02:31:35,690 --> 02:31:39,141
to pursue this and what,
what exactly is the reaction to people 

3186
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:46,820
in the scientology community now?
Because it seems like the Internet has 

3187
02:31:46,820 --> 02:31:50,370
sort of exposed that religion in a way 
that it before it was always like,

3188
02:31:50,371 --> 02:31:52,350
what scientology me,
what is this?

3189
02:31:52,620 --> 02:31:57,620
But now the internet is sort of all the 
tom cruise recruitment videos have been 

3190
02:31:57,620 --> 02:32:01,401
released and all the craziness is out 
and the people like that have wrote 

3191
02:32:01,401 --> 02:32:03,510
going clear that book.
I'm reading that right now.

3192
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:05,820
I'm Lawrence Wright's book.
Uh,

3193
02:32:06,120 --> 02:32:11,120
the,
the whole religion would call it a 

3194
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:11,520
religion.
Where the fuck it is.

3195
02:32:11,521 --> 02:32:15,720
The whole movement seems to be in a very
state of flux right now.

3196
02:32:17,340 --> 02:32:19,860
Uh,
I think that's probably true at the same

3197
02:32:19,861 --> 02:32:20,790
time,
I think for the,

3198
02:32:20,910 --> 02:32:23,490
for,
for students of a,

3199
02:32:24,780 --> 02:32:27,930
I guess religious,
a oddity or,

3200
02:32:27,940 --> 02:32:28,750
or,
you know,

3201
02:32:28,830 --> 02:32:31,560
new religions or whatever,
whatever you want to call it,

3202
02:32:31,561 --> 02:32:36,561
you know,
it's known and it's out there in your 

3203
02:32:36,561 --> 02:32:36,561
reading Lawrence,
right?

3204
02:32:36,561 --> 02:32:36,561
I read that Lawrence.
Right.

3205
02:32:36,561 --> 02:32:37,390
But there's a vast,
you know,

3206
02:32:37,460 --> 02:32:42,460
there's a vast,
massive kind of main street people for 

3207
02:32:42,460 --> 02:32:44,631
whom they still all they know is,
it's that thing that Tom Cruise is 

3208
02:32:44,631 --> 02:32:44,631
involved in it,
it's kind of weird,

3209
02:32:44,631 --> 02:32:46,210
you know,
and they.

3210
02:32:46,310 --> 02:32:48,480
And so they don't know.
So I think there's a huge.

3211
02:32:48,500 --> 02:32:50,580
So I think step one for a lot of people 
are like,

3212
02:32:50,581 --> 02:32:51,420
what is it,
you know,

3213
02:32:51,430 --> 02:32:56,430
it's something to do with Ufo shows and 
Tom Cruise and John Travolta and maybe 

3214
02:32:56,430 --> 02:32:58,260
his sexuality,
but beyond that,

3215
02:32:58,261 --> 02:32:58,930
they don't know.
So,

3216
02:32:59,160 --> 02:33:03,420
so part of it is,
is trying to convey what it actually is.

3217
02:33:03,420 --> 02:33:06,360
I mean,
I've been studying in the area for,

3218
02:33:06,590 --> 02:33:09,000
you know,
like reading all the books for about 15,

3219
02:33:09,001 --> 02:33:14,001
20 years before Lawrence Wright's.
There was one by Janet reitman called 

3220
02:33:14,001 --> 02:33:18,111
inside scientology.
There's a whole laundry list of books 

3221
02:33:18,111 --> 02:33:20,571
about scientology.
I still don't quite get what it is to 

3222
02:33:20,571 --> 02:33:20,571
you.
Well,

3223
02:33:21,090 --> 02:33:23,100
I do in a sense,
what is it,

3224
02:33:23,160 --> 02:33:25,110
what's it called?
Unquestionably.

3225
02:33:25,140 --> 02:33:27,360
But they don't,
that's fine.

3226
02:33:27,570 --> 02:33:29,010
But it was created by a science fiction 
writer.

3227
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:29,730
Okay.
But say,

3228
02:33:29,760 --> 02:33:33,090
say that's true still,
like there's lots of cults out there.

3229
02:33:33,700 --> 02:33:34,890
Uh,
what,

3230
02:33:34,891 --> 02:33:35,340
what,
beyond that,

3231
02:33:35,341 --> 02:33:36,270
what is it,
what do they,

3232
02:33:36,420 --> 02:33:39,870
how do they practice,
how they practice?

3233
02:33:39,900 --> 02:33:41,580
Meaning what,
like what do they like?

3234
02:33:41,581 --> 02:33:44,160
We know with Catholics,
they go to church,

3235
02:33:44,370 --> 02:33:47,450
they kept confession,
they eat crackers and,

3236
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:49,600
and it's the,
the body of,

3237
02:33:49,850 --> 02:33:50,230
of,
of,

3238
02:33:50,231 --> 02:33:54,660
of Jesus Christ rise and um,
and,

3239
02:33:54,661 --> 02:33:56,400
and they believe in the pope and,
and you know,

3240
02:33:56,401 --> 02:34:00,450
we know roughly what their sacrament is 
and they read the Bible and they believe

3241
02:34:00,451 --> 02:34:01,760
in Jesus and,
and so and so.

3242
02:34:01,830 --> 02:34:03,930
So,
so what is it with scientology?

3243
02:34:04,400 --> 02:34:06,530
Um,
that's a good question.

3244
02:34:06,620 --> 02:34:08,180
Um,
I don't know,

3245
02:34:08,210 --> 02:34:10,920
like if they have ceremonies,
if they,

3246
02:34:10,990 --> 02:34:13,940
I think when you look at that Tom cruise
recruitment video,

3247
02:34:13,941 --> 02:34:16,280
which is fucking fantastic,
you know,

3248
02:34:16,281 --> 02:34:18,030
when he's standing there,
if you've

3249
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:19,480
seen the one where they give them a 
metal.

3250
02:34:19,620 --> 02:34:21,350
Yes,
which is fucking,

3251
02:34:21,370 --> 02:34:23,830
just so rich.
It's a giant metal,

3252
02:34:23,831 --> 02:34:26,410
many times larger than an Olympic gold 
medal.

3253
02:34:26,411 --> 02:34:27,490
Uh,
uh,

3254
02:34:27,550 --> 02:34:30,520
he's wearing this metal and he's 
standing there in front of a fucking.

3255
02:34:30,550 --> 02:34:32,370
It's called the freedom middle of valor.

3256
02:34:35,060 --> 02:34:36,020
Hm.

3257
02:34:38,450 --> 02:34:43,450
And um,
he's standing in front of all those 

3258
02:34:43,450 --> 02:34:43,790
people and he's such a charismatic 
person.

3259
02:34:43,820 --> 02:34:45,110
There it is right there.
Oh,

3260
02:34:45,111 --> 02:34:48,890
Jesus Louisa's.
We'll look at that fucking thing.

3261
02:34:49,460 --> 02:34:50,520
Come on.
Just the,

3262
02:34:51,320 --> 02:34:56,320
the lack of like understanding how you 
come across that would allow you to wear

3263
02:34:59,271 --> 02:35:04,271
that,
the lack of objectivity that it will 

3264
02:35:04,271 --> 02:35:04,271
allow you to put that on and,
and,

3265
02:35:04,271 --> 02:35:08,060
and be able to do this fingertips down 
thing on the,

3266
02:35:08,061 --> 02:35:09,740
uh,
on the desk.

3267
02:35:09,741 --> 02:35:14,741
Like you're making a very important 
point while you're wearing a fucking 

3268
02:35:14,741 --> 02:35:16,310
Frisbee,
a gold frisbee around your neck.

3269
02:35:17,840 --> 02:35:22,840
It's almost like he's trying to convince
himself by tricking all these people.

3270
02:35:23,930 --> 02:35:26,810
I think there's something to that.
There's something to,

3271
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:32,680
if you can get a thousand people to 
cheer at these words that you're saying 

3272
02:35:34,220 --> 02:35:37,460
and you know,
no matter how fucking crazy they are,

3273
02:35:37,640 --> 02:35:41,360
if you can get all these people to 
believe you and listen to you,

3274
02:35:41,361 --> 02:35:45,350
it sort of validates that maybe you're 
not fucked up because you're in with all

3275
02:35:45,351 --> 02:35:48,320
these other people that have agreed in 
fetuses and fucking,

3276
02:35:49,080 --> 02:35:54,080
you know,
all the other wacky shit that they 

3277
02:35:54,080 --> 02:35:56,711
believe.
There's something to that where he's 

3278
02:35:56,711 --> 02:36:00,221
putting on this massive performance,
not just for them but for himself as 

3279
02:36:00,221 --> 02:36:00,260
well.

3280
02:36:02,750 --> 02:36:04,000
I mean,
to me it,

3281
02:36:04,010 --> 02:36:05,780
it,
it's a bit like the Oscars,

3282
02:36:05,781 --> 02:36:08,030
like that's when I was watching the 
Oscars last night.

3283
02:36:08,031 --> 02:36:08,480
I was like,
wow,

3284
02:36:08,481 --> 02:36:10,670
it's like a scientology event,
you know,

3285
02:36:10,680 --> 02:36:12,050
it's that level of,
um,

3286
02:36:12,680 --> 02:36:13,770
I think that's,
that's the,

3287
02:36:13,950 --> 02:36:18,410
that's the kind of the,
the performance or the or the light.

3288
02:36:18,411 --> 02:36:20,180
That's the semiotics of it,
you know,

3289
02:36:20,181 --> 02:36:24,380
the signifier they're trying to send a 
message of grand,

3290
02:36:24,440 --> 02:36:26,920
big golden.
Yeah.

3291
02:36:27,200 --> 02:36:28,760
Important.
You know,

3292
02:36:28,790 --> 02:36:30,860
like both Oscars and the freedom,
you know,

3293
02:36:30,870 --> 02:36:35,870
he's wearing around his neck,
but like is it any more silly than 

3294
02:36:35,870 --> 02:36:35,870
having a little gold man?

3295
02:36:35,870 --> 02:36:40,280
No.
My friend Greg Fitzsimmons put posted 

3296
02:36:40,280 --> 02:36:40,380
something on twitter and I retweeted it.
He said,

3297
02:36:40,381 --> 02:36:45,381
I hope the Oscars get beamed to the 
troops so they could see all the people 

3298
02:36:45,381 --> 02:36:47,400
get rewarded for brave and courageous 
work.

3299
02:36:47,401 --> 02:36:52,401
This year was such a great tweet and 
especially if you know,

3300
02:36:54,211 --> 02:36:58,920
Greg is a brilliant comedian himself,
but it's such a great tweet because it's

3301
02:36:58,921 --> 02:37:03,921
so fucking right on.
It's so pompous and self rewarding and 

3302
02:37:04,771 --> 02:37:09,771
self aggrandizing and so ridiculous or 
wearing suits with fucking special ties 

3303
02:37:10,801 --> 02:37:14,170
and you know,
a formal attire and it's

3304
02:37:14,870 --> 02:37:15,950
it and,
and you know,

3305
02:37:15,951 --> 02:37:16,190
not

3306
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:19,980
to say they shouldn't be.
I mean but,

3307
02:37:20,530 --> 02:37:21,000
but,
but,

3308
02:37:21,010 --> 02:37:26,010
but my,
my point is though is that so like with 

3309
02:37:26,010 --> 02:37:26,390
Tom Cruise,
okay.

3310
02:37:26,391 --> 02:37:28,940
He's got his fingers down but in the 
end,

3311
02:37:29,390 --> 02:37:34,210
so why pick on,
on TC and scientology but,

3312
02:37:34,840 --> 02:37:38,360
but,
but we're letting the Oscars know.

3313
02:37:38,580 --> 02:37:43,580
We'll say that we'll give that a pass 
but we can't have guys wearing golden 

3314
02:37:43,580 --> 02:37:46,190
little golden ones around their neck 
that they have to be little men.

3315
02:37:46,220 --> 02:37:47,250
You know what I mean?
Oh sure.

3316
02:37:47,251 --> 02:37:49,370
Well,
and also why is it okay?

3317
02:37:49,530 --> 02:37:54,530
Why is it okay to pick on Tom Cruise?
But it's not okay to pick on Jewish 

3318
02:37:54,530 --> 02:37:57,270
people with curls and there bobbing up 
and down.

3319
02:37:57,271 --> 02:37:59,400
And that's their religion.
That's their,

3320
02:37:59,930 --> 02:38:04,930
their traditions.
This is just a tradition where it's not 

3321
02:38:04,930 --> 02:38:05,730
a real religion in our eyes.
We know the guy who wrote it.

3322
02:38:06,210 --> 02:38:07,230
Right.
Good point.

3323
02:38:07,231 --> 02:38:08,610
That's the thing that people have

3324
02:38:09,160 --> 02:38:14,160
part of I think,
and I think what I would try and do in 

3325
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:17,680
making a documentary about is to try and
see past a lot of the things that people

3326
02:38:17,681 --> 02:38:20,530
find weird or ludicrous about it,
you know,

3327
02:38:20,531 --> 02:38:21,940
which is,
you know,

3328
02:38:21,941 --> 02:38:26,941
the fact that they have big glitzy 
scientology events and get to the core 

3329
02:38:26,941 --> 02:38:27,190
of what it is.

3330
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:30,340
Well it is craziness is what it is,
is nothing.

3331
02:38:30,341 --> 02:38:35,341
You can't get to the core of it.
The core of it is established sort of 

3332
02:38:35,341 --> 02:38:39,960
pattern of thoughts that allow people 
who are not normal to feel normal,

3333
02:38:40,990 --> 02:38:44,470
allow people that are troubled,
allow people that are searching for some

3334
02:38:44,471 --> 02:38:46,660
sort of a structure.
TC is normal.

3335
02:38:46,780 --> 02:38:48,930
I do not think he's doing based on what.
Well,

3336
02:38:48,940 --> 02:38:51,190
based on the fact that he's so fucking 
famous.

3337
02:38:51,191 --> 02:38:54,370
It's impossible to be.
But he was in it before he was famous.

3338
02:38:54,610 --> 02:38:55,930
Yes.
And,

3339
02:38:56,050 --> 02:38:58,630
and it helps the company know about 
that.

3340
02:38:58,631 --> 02:39:01,360
I believe he got in at when he was still
running

3341
02:39:01,390 --> 02:39:05,200
pretty early on and I think,
I think jt got in it,

3342
02:39:05,340 --> 02:39:09,870
Shane in the Carter years maybe,
I don't know,

3343
02:39:09,960 --> 02:39:14,960
but very early.
There's also the ambiguous sexuality 

3344
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:15,360
aspect of it.
There's the,

3345
02:39:15,390 --> 02:39:20,390
the rumors of homosexuality that are 
attached to a famous male scientologists

3346
02:39:22,220 --> 02:39:24,270
that they shield them,
you know,

3347
02:39:24,271 --> 02:39:25,470
and especially the,
the,

3348
02:39:25,480 --> 02:39:30,480
the John Travolta thing.
Do you got to get out of here pretty 

3349
02:39:30,480 --> 02:39:30,570
soon where it's almost 3:00.
We're almost wrapped up anyway.

3350
02:39:31,070 --> 02:39:36,070
I think there's,
there's a lot of weirdness going on and 

3351
02:39:36,070 --> 02:39:39,471
there's also the people that have you 
talked to people that have done 

3352
02:39:39,471 --> 02:39:42,180
expositions on scientology and what they
say is that during the auditing process,

3353
02:39:42,420 --> 02:39:47,420
when they audit you,
meaning when you go over past life 

3354
02:39:47,420 --> 02:39:50,991
experiences that are quite troubling.
You repeat them over and over again 

3355
02:39:50,991 --> 02:39:54,081
until they lose their meaning.
Like the same thing as like if you say 

3356
02:39:54,081 --> 02:39:54,150
fuck around someone who never says fuck 
that,

3357
02:39:54,151 --> 02:39:56,880
like Oh say fuck around a priest or you 
know,

3358
02:39:56,881 --> 02:39:58,830
act like it's some horrible thing that 
you've done.

3359
02:39:58,980 --> 02:40:01,140
We say fuck around your friends.
You don't even,

3360
02:40:01,141 --> 02:40:02,970
it doesn't even register.
It's like,

3361
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:03,960
oh,
this fucking thing.

3362
02:40:03,961 --> 02:40:05,730
It's another word.
It just,

3363
02:40:05,870 --> 02:40:09,240
it has no power because it's so used so 
much,

3364
02:40:09,450 --> 02:40:14,100
and I think maybe that's a bad analogy,
but in a sense it works because what

3365
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:17,970
they're doing is repeating the stories 
over and over and over and over and over

3366
02:40:17,971 --> 02:40:19,950
again until they lose their meaning.
But in the process,

3367
02:40:19,951 --> 02:40:23,250
they're recording all this shit.
So they have all this dirt on you.

3368
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:28,460
They have all these crazy stories.
If you're going through the process 

3369
02:40:28,460 --> 02:40:31,880
earnestly,
you're telling them all the secrets of 

3370
02:40:31,880 --> 02:40:32,220
your life,
all the crazy gay orgies,

3371
02:40:32,221 --> 02:40:33,590
you'd been a part of all the,
the,

3372
02:40:33,620 --> 02:40:36,360
the,
the nutty fucking cocaine binges,

3373
02:40:36,361 --> 02:40:39,420
whatever the fuck you've done that 
you're ashamed of

3374
02:40:39,850 --> 02:40:41,160
and you think that,
that.

3375
02:40:41,190 --> 02:40:44,800
Does that get released?
The point you decide to leave?

3376
02:40:44,840 --> 02:40:45,370
You think

3377
02:40:45,670 --> 02:40:47,240
it's a good question.
I don't know.

3378
02:40:47,270 --> 02:40:47,960
Um,
I know

3379
02:40:48,100 --> 02:40:48,700
they,
they,

3380
02:40:48,701 --> 02:40:49,420
they,
uh,

3381
02:40:49,590 --> 02:40:51,640
uh,
they are adamant that,

3382
02:40:52,090 --> 02:40:57,090
that is held under a priest,
penitent bond of confidentiality.

3383
02:40:57,460 --> 02:40:59,580
Of course they are,
but I mean the,

3384
02:40:59,610 --> 02:41:01,840
no,
what's the mother of all rumors?

3385
02:41:02,410 --> 02:41:05,170
The greatest rumor of all time.
Yes,

3386
02:41:05,171 --> 02:41:06,610
thank you.
Richard Gere.

3387
02:41:06,730 --> 02:41:08,470
Do you know when that rumor was 
released?

3388
02:41:09,580 --> 02:41:09,740
Oh,

3389
02:41:09,940 --> 02:41:13,040
when Richard Gere left scientology.
I didn't know he was in scientology.

3390
02:41:13,130 --> 02:41:14,390
He dabbled.
Are you?

3391
02:41:14,540 --> 02:41:15,710
Are you,
are you serious?

3392
02:41:15,711 --> 02:41:18,110
Yes.
He dabbled in scientology and that,

3393
02:41:18,111 --> 02:41:23,111
that rumor was released when the Tom 
Cruise or the John Travolta massage 

3394
02:41:23,900 --> 02:41:28,900
therapy stories were released.
Allegedly that's when John Travolta was 

3395
02:41:30,891 --> 02:41:35,270
having issues with scientology.
So way to keep you under wraps.

3396
02:41:35,330 --> 02:41:38,000
This is the rumors,
obviously completely unsubstantiated.

3397
02:41:38,180 --> 02:41:43,020
I'm talking out of my ass 100 percent,
but that makes sense,

3398
02:41:43,021 --> 02:41:44,710
doesn't it?
I mean if you,

3399
02:41:44,740 --> 02:41:49,740
if you have a powerful organization that
gets a certain percentage of the amount 

3400
02:41:49,740 --> 02:41:52,710
of money that you make every year and 
they have a lot of crazy shit on you,

3401
02:41:53,070 --> 02:41:56,260
you'd like to go and get massages and 
talk these guys into Latin.

3402
02:41:56,340 --> 02:42:01,340
You fuck them.
I mean that would think that would be 

3403
02:42:01,340 --> 02:42:01,340
something that,
you know,

3404
02:42:01,340 --> 02:42:03,750
maybe if you were going to leave and 
take all that money away,

3405
02:42:03,780 --> 02:42:04,710
they might,
uh,

3406
02:42:04,740 --> 02:42:06,210
they might bring,
you know,

3407
02:42:06,290 --> 02:42:07,530
assuming they have an organization

3408
02:42:07,550 --> 02:42:10,730
it any damaging.
Um,

3409
02:42:12,310 --> 02:42:16,130
confidence is about Leah Remini as far 
as I know.

3410
02:42:16,320 --> 02:42:18,240
Well,
Leah Remini had that situation where she

3411
02:42:18,241 --> 02:42:20,660
was saying that the leader of 
scientology,

3412
02:42:20,661 --> 02:42:23,370
his wife was missing Shelly miscavige.
Yeah.

3413
02:42:23,371 --> 02:42:24,240
What's the story there?

3414
02:42:25,130 --> 02:42:26,930
Well,
a lear.

3415
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:28,700
Is it pronounced remedy?
Remedy.

3416
02:42:29,090 --> 02:42:32,030
She alleged that David Miscavige,
his wife,

3417
02:42:32,031 --> 02:42:36,860
who hasn't been publicly photographed 
allegedly for a number of years,

3418
02:42:37,160 --> 02:42:40,440
maybe even five or 10 years,
uh,

3419
02:42:40,910 --> 02:42:44,030
was being held captive or had been 
disappeared in some way.

3420
02:42:44,050 --> 02:42:46,000
And,
and that she'd had,

3421
02:42:46,040 --> 02:42:49,290
she'd been at Tom Cruise's wedding to,
um,

3422
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:53,210
who would it have been at that point?
Katie Holmes in Italy,

3423
02:42:53,211 --> 02:42:56,630
I think and said,
Here's David miscavige with shelly.

3424
02:42:56,631 --> 02:43:01,631
Why aren't you here with your wife?
And it became a scandal within 

3425
02:43:01,631 --> 02:43:06,101
scientology.
People felt it was disrespectful to the 

3426
02:43:06,101 --> 02:43:08,980
head Honcho David miscavige to be asking
where his wife was so that she got into 

3427
02:43:08,980 --> 02:43:09,920
trouble.
And then she left.

3428
02:43:09,921 --> 02:43:13,510
And then after she left,
initiated a police inquiries.

3429
02:43:13,511 --> 02:43:15,580
She made it.
She filed a missing persons report.

3430
02:43:16,060 --> 02:43:17,770
But then the police after a couple of 
days said,

3431
02:43:17,800 --> 02:43:18,880
no,
she's not missing.

3432
02:43:20,050 --> 02:43:25,050
So I guess she's not missing.
The fact is she must be in a retreat 

3433
02:43:25,781 --> 02:43:30,781
somewhere somewhere.
I think there's people who know know 

3434
02:43:30,781 --> 02:43:31,460
where she is,
like scientology watchers,

3435
02:43:31,461 --> 02:43:35,320
say there's a certain church 
headquarters up in the hills.

3436
02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:42,040
I can't read it somewhere in southern 
California and that's where she's 

3437
02:43:42,040 --> 02:43:42,040
living.
She,

3438
02:43:42,040 --> 02:43:45,841
maybe she just doesn't want to be 
published or maybe she just wants to 

3439
02:43:45,841 --> 02:43:45,841
live on her own.
Like without going public,

3440
02:43:45,841 --> 02:43:48,580
you know,
I think that's more likely than the idea

3441
02:43:48,581 --> 02:43:50,980
that she's being held against her will.

3442
02:43:51,250 --> 02:43:52,110
Yeah.
Um,

3443
02:43:52,510 --> 02:43:54,280
could be.
I don't know,

3444
02:43:54,281 --> 02:43:56,920
but I think this kind of goes back to 
the,

3445
02:43:56,930 --> 02:44:01,930
a Swami g's I what his name was that the
guy who was the supposed physicist who's

3446
02:44:04,030 --> 02:44:05,410
living with Swami Gee.
Yeah.

3447
02:44:05,830 --> 02:44:09,040
I think people love being a part of a 
group.

3448
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:11,560
Whether the group makes sense or doesn't
make sense.

3449
02:44:11,561 --> 02:44:16,561
I think people,
they find comfort in that and they also 

3450
02:44:16,561 --> 02:44:17,380
get addicted to being a part of a group.
And then when you're a part of something

3451
02:44:17,381 --> 02:44:22,381
as powerful scientology,
especially when you look at all the 

3452
02:44:22,381 --> 02:44:25,291
examples of people who are 
scientologists who are greatly 

3453
02:44:25,291 --> 02:44:27,841
successful.
My old neighbor was a scientologist and 

3454
02:44:27,841 --> 02:44:30,640
we had this really weird revelation when
it came out where he and I were talking,

3455
02:44:30,641 --> 02:44:35,641
he was talking about buying a piece of 
land in our neighborhood and said he 

3456
02:44:35,641 --> 02:44:39,580
couldn't buy it right now because his 
wife was going clear and I said,

3457
02:44:39,581 --> 02:44:40,750
uh,
what are you talking about?

3458
02:44:40,750 --> 02:44:41,500
Like,
what does that mean,

3459
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:43,090
you know?
And he said,

3460
02:44:43,120 --> 02:44:45,160
well,
we're scientologist and uh,

3461
02:44:45,190 --> 02:44:48,100
my wife is going to go clear and it cost
$50,000.

3462
02:44:48,850 --> 02:44:50,980
And I was like,
this is a guy who was a contractor.

3463
02:44:50,981 --> 02:44:52,180
He builds buildings,
you know,

3464
02:44:52,181 --> 02:44:53,530
he's not a wealthy man,
you know,

3465
02:44:53,710 --> 02:44:55,270
he does.
He does fairly well,

3466
02:44:55,510 --> 02:44:58,540
but I mean $50,000
is a giant chunk of his income.

3467
02:44:59,050 --> 02:45:04,050
And he was talking about how his wife is
going to be no longer affected by 

3468
02:45:04,151 --> 02:45:06,880
outside influence and they buy going 
clear.

3469
02:45:07,030 --> 02:45:12,030
It eliminates all the negative impact of
people talking shit about you or you 

3470
02:45:13,231 --> 02:45:14,950
know,
fucking traffic,

3471
02:45:14,951 --> 02:45:16,960
anything,
nothing was going to get in anymore.

3472
02:45:16,961 --> 02:45:21,961
She was clear of all that stuff that she
was going to be removed from.

3473
02:45:22,150 --> 02:45:23,500
And I was like,
are you clear?

3474
02:45:23,570 --> 02:45:28,570
It's like the reactive mind is removed 
so you can make decisions without any 

3475
02:45:30,290 --> 02:45:33,080
interference from your reactive mind.

3476
02:45:33,280 --> 02:45:34,630
Yeah.
What the fuck,

3477
02:45:35,300 --> 02:45:36,910
I guess.
Yeah.

3478
02:45:36,970 --> 02:45:38,260
I don't know.
I mean,

3479
02:45:38,380 --> 02:45:41,020
but this poor guy was going to spend 
$50,000

3480
02:45:41,021 --> 02:45:44,200
on this and he had this sort of glassy 
eyed thing about,

3481
02:45:44,201 --> 02:45:45,670
um,
this sort of last thing.

3482
02:45:46,450 --> 02:45:51,250
I think being a part of a group,
we have these ancestral instincts that I

3483
02:45:51,251 --> 02:45:54,580
think are passed down from the time 
where it was very important to be a part

3484
02:45:54,581 --> 02:45:59,581
of a tribe to stay alive if you're by 
yourself and the hunter and gatherer 

3485
02:45:59,581 --> 02:46:02,950
times is very difficult to get enough 
food to stay alive.

3486
02:46:03,130 --> 02:46:08,130
It was very hard and I think we have 
this bond with being a part of a group,

3487
02:46:08,530 --> 02:46:11,630
whether it's fucking Mac users,
man.

3488
02:46:11,870 --> 02:46:15,290
I mean people that love Mac,
they hate pc users.

3489
02:46:15,291 --> 02:46:18,170
People that hate that loved pc.
They hate Mac.

3490
02:46:18,210 --> 02:46:22,310
They get in these groups,
the Protestants versus the Catholics,

3491
02:46:22,610 --> 02:46:24,980
you know,
there's Chevy versus Ford.

3492
02:46:25,130 --> 02:46:29,270
People are weird that we have these 
weird desires to be a part of groups.

3493
02:46:29,480 --> 02:46:33,110
And I think someone like the Westboro 
Baptist Church,

3494
02:46:33,230 --> 02:46:37,220
or someone likes Swami g's disciples or 
someone like scientology,

3495
02:46:37,580 --> 02:46:42,580
part of the appeal of that is being in a
group and then when you have 

3496
02:46:42,580 --> 02:46:47,471
scientology,
I'm not too familiar with what 

3497
02:46:47,471 --> 02:46:47,471
scientology does do.
That's beneficial,

3498
02:46:47,471 --> 02:46:51,020
but you look at a guy like Tom Cruise,
sexual stuff aside,

3499
02:46:51,320 --> 02:46:54,470
he's talking about a tremendously 
successful person who looks great.

3500
02:46:54,650 --> 02:46:57,950
He's fucking 50 and he looks amazing.
I mean,

3501
02:46:57,951 --> 02:47:02,951
he's in great health.
He seems like really optimistic all the 

3502
02:47:02,951 --> 02:47:04,280
time and very,
very charismatic,

3503
02:47:04,490 --> 02:47:07,850
very appealing to be a part of a group 
that that guy is in.

3504
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:12,320
If he is benefiting from scientology and
from the principles of scientology,

3505
02:47:12,710 --> 02:47:15,560
surely it can't all be wrong.
Surely it can't all be bad.

3506
02:47:16,950 --> 02:47:20,180
Let's say Louis,
you're awesome,

3507
02:47:20,181 --> 02:47:22,610
man.
You got to get out of here and this is.

3508
02:47:22,640 --> 02:47:23,810
I think we're done anyway.
This is.

3509
02:47:23,811 --> 02:47:28,811
We're running a three hours in.
We turn into a Pumpkin is three hours 

3510
02:47:28,811 --> 02:47:28,811
the normal length?
Yes.

3511
02:47:28,811 --> 02:47:29,120
Oh my goodness.
Crazy,

3512
02:47:29,190 --> 02:47:30,080
right?
Yeah.

3513
02:47:30,090 --> 02:47:31,400
I don't know.
Get edited.

3514
02:47:31,460 --> 02:47:33,020
Nope.
Not only that,

3515
02:47:33,021 --> 02:47:34,940
it's live and people listened to the 
whole thing.

3516
02:47:34,941 --> 02:47:39,941
Sometimes.
Sometimes they listened to five minutes 

3517
02:47:39,941 --> 02:47:40,400
and then go fucking bullshit liberal 
nonsense park these people.

3518
02:47:40,820 --> 02:47:42,770
There's that too.
Thank you for having me on.

3519
02:47:42,771 --> 02:47:44,660
It was really fun.
I would love to do it again.

3520
02:47:44,661 --> 02:47:46,010
If you ever have anything that you're 
promoting,

3521
02:47:46,011 --> 02:47:48,440
please don't hesitate.
We have you in an,

3522
02:47:48,560 --> 02:47:50,040
you know,
one of the reasons I came with.

3523
02:47:50,200 --> 02:47:51,140
Well,
there were two reasons,

3524
02:47:51,141 --> 02:47:52,290
but,
uh,

3525
02:47:52,880 --> 02:47:54,950
hundreds of reasons,
but one was,

3526
02:47:54,951 --> 02:47:59,951
I was saying before I came on,
there was a couple of guys outside 

3527
02:47:59,951 --> 02:47:59,951
trader Joe's and they were,
they were like,

3528
02:47:59,951 --> 02:48:01,580
you've got your own cult.
They were brainwashed,

3529
02:48:01,610 --> 02:48:02,980
Mooney's,
uh,

3530
02:48:02,990 --> 02:48:05,820
advocating on your behalf saying,
I gotta go,

3531
02:48:06,590 --> 02:48:07,550
I love your stuff.
I said,

3532
02:48:07,551 --> 02:48:09,260
how have you seen it on Youtube?
I said,

3533
02:48:09,261 --> 02:48:12,260
how did you find out about Joe Rogan was
talking about it.

3534
02:48:12,650 --> 02:48:13,190
I said,
oh,

3535
02:48:13,191 --> 02:48:18,191
really?
You listen to the show Joe Rogan 

3536
02:48:18,191 --> 02:48:19,991
podcast.
I hear how it's so awesome you said 

3537
02:48:19,991 --> 02:48:19,991
there's so much information.
So I,

3538
02:48:19,991 --> 02:48:19,991
I,
um,

3539
02:48:20,180 --> 02:48:25,180
I was like,
well he's obviously got a lot of pull 

3540
02:48:25,180 --> 02:48:25,180
out there and um,
and,

3541
02:48:25,180 --> 02:48:29,090
and just more generally like it's just,
I love getting feedback from people 

3542
02:48:29,090 --> 02:48:31,931
who've seen me on youtube button,
so I'm trying to kind of put the word 

3543
02:48:31,931 --> 02:48:31,931
out that,
you know,

3544
02:48:31,931 --> 02:48:32,810
I think it's illegal actually.

3545
02:48:32,810 --> 02:48:34,160
I don't think people are supposed to 
have it up there,

3546
02:48:34,161 --> 02:48:35,360
but I've,
I'm okay with it.

3547
02:48:35,530 --> 02:48:37,430
Why is it illegal?
Because I think it's ABC.

3548
02:48:37,490 --> 02:48:40,040
Technically,
BBC also they get it though.

3549
02:48:40,980 --> 02:48:42,770
They'll be like,
that's the whole thing.

3550
02:48:42,771 --> 02:48:47,771
I don't think they could get it 
otherwise it on Netflix or only in the 

3551
02:48:47,771 --> 02:48:51,101
UK.
It's on Netflix and on different around 

3552
02:48:51,101 --> 02:48:53,441
the world on different channels,
but the BBC is trying to monetize it so 

3553
02:48:53,441 --> 02:48:57,131
they want to,
they want to retain rights and keep 

3554
02:48:57,131 --> 02:48:57,131
selling it.
But as far as I'm concerned,

3555
02:48:57,131 --> 02:49:01,601
it gets a lot of hits on Youtube,
but it's nice to go for you for people 

3556
02:49:01,601 --> 02:49:01,601
to see it.
Yeah.

3557
02:49:01,601 --> 02:49:03,230
I mean it puts no money in my pocket,
but I'm fine with it.

3558
02:49:03,360 --> 02:49:06,900
Well you've done some brilliant work,
really fascinating stuff.

3559
02:49:06,930 --> 02:49:11,930
I've enjoyed it.
I've gotten countless hours of 

3560
02:49:11,930 --> 02:49:11,930
entertainment out of your programming I 
think so.

3561
02:49:11,930 --> 02:49:13,950
I really appreciate having you on.
It was really enjoyable.

3562
02:49:14,310 --> 02:49:15,720
Thank you very much.
See you next.

3563
02:49:15,780 --> 02:49:17,160
What do you got coming up that people 
could say?

3564
02:49:17,210 --> 02:49:17,770
Is there anything that

3565
02:49:18,440 --> 02:49:23,440
three shows going out in Britain,
new ones going up the end of March and 

3566
02:49:23,440 --> 02:49:26,591
so they'll probably be put up quite soon
and it's the thing I was telling about 

3567
02:49:26,591 --> 02:49:27,530
La Stories.
There's the first one is about strain,

3568
02:49:27,550 --> 02:49:32,550
abandoned dogs and our attempts to 
rehabilitate them using a controversial 

3569
02:49:32,550 --> 02:49:33,810
dog therapy,
you know,

3570
02:49:33,811 --> 02:49:36,870
it's like turning criminal dogs and 
bringing them,

3571
02:49:36,871 --> 02:49:40,140
rescuing them,
bringing him into middle class homes and

3572
02:49:40,141 --> 02:49:45,141
then sometimes they attack the new 
owners and then thousands of them are 

3573
02:49:45,141 --> 02:49:48,891
killed every year in the shelters in La 
as a huge stray and neglected dog 

3574
02:49:48,891 --> 02:49:50,440
problem in La.
Second one is about the,

3575
02:49:50,490 --> 02:49:55,140
the hospitals where people are sort of 
under pressure to keep trying new,

3576
02:49:55,170 --> 02:50:00,170
like they're close to possibly dying,
but there's a new experimental therapy 

3577
02:50:00,170 --> 02:50:04,940
and they have the insurance to pay for 
it and it's this weird 21st century 

3578
02:50:04,940 --> 02:50:05,970
conundrum of when do I stop and say 
like,

3579
02:50:06,150 --> 02:50:07,590
I just want to have a peaceful death.

3580
02:50:08,050 --> 02:50:13,050
When am I allowed to say like,
I don't want to try any more chemo or 

3581
02:50:13,050 --> 02:50:13,050
these on BBC America?
Uh,

3582
02:50:13,050 --> 02:50:13,710
no,
they're on the UK,

3583
02:50:13,711 --> 02:50:18,711
BBC,
normal BBC and the third one is about 

3584
02:50:18,711 --> 02:50:21,471
sex offenders living down in south la,
especially around torrance who live in 

3585
02:50:21,471 --> 02:50:24,060
these hostels with a electronic 
bracelets,

3586
02:50:24,360 --> 02:50:29,360
heavily monitored lives and the whole,
the strangeness of having done something

3587
02:50:29,581 --> 02:50:30,580
so terrible,
you know,

3588
02:50:30,600 --> 02:50:34,350
they've abused their own children or 
some of them are rapists and so on.

3589
02:50:34,920 --> 02:50:36,540
And then they've done,
you know,

3590
02:50:36,570 --> 02:50:41,570
whatever.
We're 10 years in prison and they've 

3591
02:50:41,570 --> 02:50:41,910
come out and they're on parole.
And to what extent,

3592
02:50:42,090 --> 02:50:42,900
if any,
you know,

3593
02:50:43,020 --> 02:50:45,060
do we give people a second chance?
I give her.

3594
02:50:45,090 --> 02:50:46,200
They're out.
We're going to live.

3595
02:50:46,201 --> 02:50:48,420
We are living alongside them,
you know,

3596
02:50:48,421 --> 02:50:51,690
more or less with certain restrictions.
What do we,

3597
02:50:51,691 --> 02:50:53,050
how do we relate to those guys?

3598
02:50:53,180 --> 02:50:55,250
Well,
those are three fascinating subjects,

3599
02:50:55,251 --> 02:50:57,620
so I'm just saying that I can't wait to 
watch those shows.

3600
02:50:58,030 --> 02:51:00,010
Really big fan man.
Really appreciate you coming on.
