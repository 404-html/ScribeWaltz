00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,220
Hello Freak bitches,
fascinating about the liquid around them

2
00:00:05,221 --> 00:00:07,850
out anyway,
but I suppose people that are signed

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,030
totally,
she would say this is our religion and

4
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:10,451
uh,
you're,

5
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:12,250
you're taking the piss out of our
religion.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,170
It's an ideology that is also a very
positive one in the sense that it's

7
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:21,220
dedicated towards self improvement and
eliminating all these psychological

8
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,590
barriers that are holding you back and
in that way.

9
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,800
But people find a lot of benefit in
being a part of that religion.

10
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:29,200
And I think when they find a lot of
benefit in being a part of it,

11
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:31,570
then you know,
they could justify all the other

12
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:34,600
nonsense and just sort of ignore it.
Because what l Ron Hubbard,

13
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:37,600
according to the going clear book,
uh,

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,900
Lawrence Krauss book was trying to do
with self medicate would,

15
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:44,740
he had a lot of psychological issues
himself and he was trying to cure his

16
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:49,741
own issues and in using these methods to
cure his own religion or the zone,

17
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,890
his own issues,
he translated them into a religion.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,490
Like this is a big part of what
scientology initially was,

19
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,440
was his own attempts to self diagnose
and treat his own psychological

20
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:03,274
ailments.

21
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,470
A good idea really works really well and
there are so I suppose people that it's

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,050
working for.
I like a quote,

23
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,780
I heard that I'd like to be quick to see
where religious people are.

24
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:16,381
Right.
You know,

25
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:18,930
it's all really obvious where religious
people are wrong.

26
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:20,640
You know,
cause we sort of hear about it on the

27
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:22,950
news but like where religious people to
write,

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,270
you know,
sort of togetherness,

29
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,800
selfless nurse relationship with a
deepest self acceptance of death and the

30
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:32,460
possibility of transcendence of the
human primal self.

31
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:34,770
Those things are all really beautiful
ideas.

32
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:37,980
They've kind of lost their way in a
science as scientists,

33
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:40,650
you know that term scientism,
the idea that sort of science has got

34
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:43,380
into territories that science company
handled because we come to a judge

35
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:46,500
during full stop at certain points.
You know like what happened on the

36
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:48,390
Tuesday before the Big Bang,
you know,

37
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,470
materialism,
materialism,

38
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,790
individualism are hard things to
overcome.

39
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,020
If like if,
if people,

40
00:01:58,021 --> 00:02:00,330
if we are,
if we have as our dominant mindset,

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,550
I'm only going to believe shit that I
can prove.

42
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,000
Then you are just an individual and you
may as well just,

43
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,950
you know,
why not just spend your life fucking as

44
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:12,330
many people as you can and accumulating
as much material as you can because

45
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:14,370
nothing exists unless you can see it,
measure it,

46
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:15,870
way it,
contain it and fuck it.

47
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,480
You know,
if that is the dominant belief system,

48
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:21,090
which we sort of materialism,
consumerism,

49
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,090
capitalism,
I think all dovetail on that premise.

50
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,811
You know,
this is all,

51
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,090
it's real fucked.
You know,

52
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,220
that's how you can have that chronic
ecological disrespect is because,

53
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,870
oh,
it doesn't matter what happens after

54
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:34,760
you're dead.
They'll be like,

55
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:36,630
well,
what about my fucking children?

56
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,830
Even just on a practical level of God
live on this fucking pebble in infinite

57
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:41,610
space.

58
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,750
And they'd like,
but if you're just like,

59
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:44,490
well no,
we've not really thought about that.

60
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,500
And a sort of an inability to accept,
you know,

61
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,950
like certain,
and I know that you're sort of like a,

62
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,850
I don't wholesale by any dominant
theory,

63
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,880
but I think it's clear to me that,
do you know what I believe in on an

64
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:58,320
individual level and on a cultural
level,

65
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:00,190
if something is possible,
you should be trying to fucking do it.

66
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:02,380
So as soon as people realize,
hold on a minute,

67
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,070
that's having a negative impact or hey,
this is a bit of a way of using our

68
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,510
resources.
Now utilities,

69
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,150
as soon as you realize it,
you should be moving towards it.

70
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:13,540
They say wisdom is acting on knowledge.
Why don't you even recognize our fossil

71
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,010
fuels are running out?
Is that right?

72
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,320
Fucking it all.
We'd better start working on the basis

73
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:18,154
that we're fucked.

74
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,340
We better start looking at alternative
energy stores is where look at different

75
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:24,970
alliances.
You just say like knowing those things

76
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,980
and not doing them,
it makes me very,

77
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:31,690
very uneasy because it makes me think
who benefits from ignoring this stuff?

78
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,470
Who's running this show?
If he's having all of that,

79
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,070
you know,
if it's creating all this rage,

80
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,740
all this unease,
all this fear in your country and in my

81
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:43,630
country now times of great,
great disease and uncertainty for people

82
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:48,631
really looking for something and know
that these institutions are just saying,

83
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:49,571
just,
you know,

84
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:51,970
carry on.
There's no sort of alternative.

85
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:54,070
No one's going to let you know.
No one now is going to see himself as

86
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:57,190
part of a religious community in the
same way or a sort of one of the dead

87
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:00,610
ideologies of the last century,
and meanwhile we're in this sort of

88
00:04:00,611 --> 00:04:05,140
peculiar state of looming crisis that
feels kind of fucking mad.

89
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,860
Well,
we're definitely in a state of looming

90
00:04:06,861 --> 00:04:08,540
crisis,
but to unpack this whole thing,

91
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:12,560
you started off with this idea of what
happened the Tuesday before the Big Bang

92
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,300
and how science can't really answer
that.

93
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,530
Well,
they can't answer it yet.

94
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,530
I did that.
The problem is once they gather more

95
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:20,900
data,
it might be a hundred years now or a

96
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,560
thousand years from now.
They can say,

97
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,630
Oh,
well here we've done the calculations

98
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:27,350
and we understand now that it's an
infinite cycle of birth and death and

99
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,720
the universe is constantly expanding and
contracting.

100
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:31,370
And this is the process that we're a
part of.

101
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,490
It's infinite and it's never started it,
it's never ending.

102
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,870
And it goes on and on and on.

103
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,990
Often you'll probably bloody right mate.
I like that idea that you just espoused

104
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:44,540
is in 5,000 year old fucking documents
called the upanishads.

105
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,413
Yeah.
Those are like,

106
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,380
those ideas are there already.
So when we fucked off religion a hundred

107
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,400
years ago,
because it was causing too much,

108
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,810
you know,
our sake,

109
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,660
we got,
we kicked out of some of the items that

110
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,570
are only now just being discovered,
right.

111
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,760
These are just to be contemplated right
now and to be considered where a science

112
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:04,900
is trying to find definitive evidence
that they do or don't represent the

113
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:07,330
reality of our timeline.
And once they do,

114
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:10,060
then they'll be able to talk about it.
But right now what they're doing is

115
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:13,150
they're examining the evidence that the
big bang exists and what could have

116
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:14,050
possibly caused that.

117
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,170
Yeah.
That,

118
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,170
see what my difficulty is is that there
are,

119
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:26,170
that is when any ideology behaves
dogmatically and prohibitively like

120
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:29,700
previous like prevents further
exploration,

121
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,300
whatever would like what kind of,
what's an example of the nature of

122
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:36,720
consciousness?
No one knows why consciousness impacts

123
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,780
matter in the way it does in the sub
quantum world.

124
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,800
No,
we can't fucking,

125
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,690
we've come to a point he's like,
oh fuck.

126
00:05:42,691 --> 00:05:44,010
Like you know like if you would like
that,

127
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:48,490
that the famous double slit theory that
an observed particle behaves

128
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,730
differently,
like the end of the park on wave can

129
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,820
change it as the central nature
depending on where he's been obsessed

130
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,610
represented

131
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,010
though when it's been explained to me by
people actually understand it.

132
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,390
What it really is is that we're
measuring these particles and in the act

133
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:04,790
of measuring you're changing the
results.

134
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,800
Yeah.
Because you're using something to

135
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:07,530
measure it.

136
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,940
Yes,
yes.

137
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,920
Yeah.
But it gets represented as all this woo

138
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:13,150
woo craziness.

139
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,340
But what I think is interesting,
Joe,

140
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:21,370
is somewhere between this woowoo
craziness and that kind of a flat,

141
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:22,940
mundane,
low.

142
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,230
This is life.
You're born,

143
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,430
you die,
you eat food,

144
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:29,900
shit comes out your asshole territory.
Somewhere in there is a mystery that

145
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:34,340
they're behind your eyes buying Jimbo,
Jamie's eyes and my eyes.

146
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,770
There is a constant,
there is this consciousness,

147
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,410
there is this awareness.
There's this inexplicably experience

148
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:44,411
that you've add on dmt experiences that
I've had through yoga and through lsd.

149
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,400
That suggests to me that consciousness
itself is the dominant force.

150
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,780
Consciousness is not just one more
phenomena is the seat of all phenomena

151
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,920
and when people are saying,
oh,

152
00:06:54,921 --> 00:06:56,180
there's this thing,
that's God.

153
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,900
What they are saying is there is an
absolute consciousness and all is

154
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:03,230
contained within it.
All matter at some point has come from

155
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:04,850
consciousness.
These realms,

156
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:08,150
they're experienced,
true psychedelic or extreme extreme,

157
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:09,920
you know,
personal experiments like your cryogenic

158
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:14,810
things or your flotation tanks all
suggest a phenomenon beyond the

159
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:16,070
individual consciousness.

160
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,110
They something else there and the very
fact that it's in for the,

161
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:22,820
the consciousness,
even by the process of measuring,

162
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,090
even by the process of measuring is
influencing and impacting rally.

163
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:26,930
I don't think that,
you know,

164
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:28,790
I'm not taking that to the extreme so I
know what you mean.

165
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,980
Make some people go,
oh that means your mind can control

166
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:31,731
shit.
I'm going,

167
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:36,710
I think it means that it means that
reality is only reality when you look at

168
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:38,960
it.
That's when it's kind of getting towards

169
00:07:38,961 --> 00:07:42,590
a bloody good book that I reckon your
listeners will be banging into is called

170
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,640
buyer centuries in by a man called
Robert Lanza who he did the best

171
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:50,990
breakdown I've ever read of that double
slit experiment and a and of the,

172
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,501
the,
the,

173
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:52,160
the,
you know,

174
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,670
made me understand for the first time
that reality is happening within your

175
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:56,390
own consciousness.

176
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,700
It's not an external phenomena at all
that,

177
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:00,860
you know,
like Hebrew explained in very ways that

178
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:03,410
I could understand of like he went,
you know,

179
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,510
you sort of think,
thinks I'm totally mundane.

180
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:07,610
He went like,
you know the experience of going in your

181
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:09,290
kitchen in the night and turn in the
light on.

182
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:12,170
Is your kitchen fridge still there when
you go back downstairs?

183
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:13,190
He goes,
well,

184
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,820
I guess when you do go in your kitchen
in turn the light on,

185
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,290
he goes see a foa on parcels of photons
come down,

186
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,040
they'd interact with the optic nerve,
they re trends low,

187
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,070
they invert eating your consciousness.
You Go,

188
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,200
yeah.
So whatever it is,

189
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,150
it's in your kitchen.
When you're not looking at it,

190
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,470
it ain't the same as when you are
looking at is an interpretive reality.

191
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,410
And one of the ways that I've sort of
reduced this down for my own simple

192
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:36,770
understanding is this,
that if none of us had a sense of smell,

193
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:38,210
if you didn't,
I then Jamie didn't.

194
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,150
And then well how would the concept of
smell makes sense?

195
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:42,200
How would you go up?
There's paint,

196
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:44,840
there's bacon with,
none of us would have the instrument to

197
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,850
receive it.
So that whole thing would be off the

198
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:50,150
agenda.
So I think that there are streams of

199
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:53,690
energy streams of data for which we do
not have the instruments to receive.

200
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:57,720
So we totally it because we simply don't
have the instruments to receive it.

201
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,180
And I said once it in most startup,
as a matter of fact,

202
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:03,090
like yeah,
my cat doesn't know there's an internet.

203
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,450
The internet does not enter the realm of
my cats consciousness,

204
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:08,490
but the fucking internet is out there.
We're out here having with these fucking

205
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:11,910
experiences and like all those realms
that we're experiencing in these various

206
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:15,810
sort of psychedelic states or you know,
however they were achieved is an

207
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:17,340
indication to me there's another reality
now,

208
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,980
where does that become fucking relevant
to what we're talking about?

209
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,850
For me,
where it does,

210
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:25,230
he's one of the continual ideas that
keeps remerge reemerging to connect us

211
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,380
back to where we were with Joe Campbell
at the beginning is there is this

212
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:32,520
fucking sense of oneness and believing
ourselves to be individual and believing

213
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:37,080
that the dominant thing in our lives to
be material that fucks us up because

214
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:39,150
people will kill each other over that
material.

215
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,860
And once we sort of realized,
no,

216
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:43,230
we're,
the true thing about us is the

217
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:45,720
consciousness is the inner self.
That's the roofing.

218
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:47,190
They were all out here.
We're all in the game.

219
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:48,810
We're all going to do shit and we're all
gonna make mistakes.

220
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,960
But that's not have the material idea as
the dominant social idea cause that

221
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:56,460
everyone's agreed with that,
whether they're communist or capitalist

222
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:58,110
or fascist or whatever everyone's
saying.

223
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:00,000
Now the main thing is this shit this out
here.

224
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,460
And it's like that connects to those
primal drives.

225
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:04,500
Cause we know that if that's happening
in your sexual drive,

226
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,620
you can never have enough pussy.
If that gets into your status drive,

227
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:09,180
you can never have enough space and
power.

228
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,340
You know,
so like we're all going to still feel

229
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:13,680
those things.
I'm still going to be a 25 times a day,

230
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,710
but it'd be nice if the cultural
ambiance was,

231
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,010
oh don't worry Russell,
you'll be back to your normal self in a

232
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,670
minute of feeling that we're all one and
we're all connected,

233
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:23,221
not,
yeah.

234
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:27,300
Well of course I feel like that and
that's what frightens me about the

235
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:31,800
culture of our countries at the moment
is it's endorsing the worst aspects of

236
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:35,400
our nature.
It's a culturating the worst aspects of

237
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,350
our nature instead of the best aspects
of our nature.

238
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:40,080
And that for me then no fucking
difference between left and right in the

239
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:42,900
current political sphere because they're
all making the same argument.

240
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,660
They were all saying come and live out
here in the material world.

241
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,830
Yeah.
It seems to me that the material world

242
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:53,180
and this idea that we should be
accumulating possessions and status and

243
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:56,810
all these different things is universal.
It almost seems like it's a natural

244
00:10:56,811 --> 00:11:01,811
progression from ancient tribal
civilization life to this weird city

245
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:06,140
life to this integration of electronics
and our life in this symbiotic

246
00:11:06,141 --> 00:11:09,770
relationship that we have to computers
and the Internet and information itself.

247
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,590
It seems like this is one of the things
that drives,

248
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:15,770
that is this desire for material
possessions because when you have a

249
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:19,070
desire for material possessions and
ensures that you're going to continue to

250
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:21,860
innovate and come up with newer and
greater and better because you always

251
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:24,290
want to keep up with the Jones' is you
always want to have the newest tesla

252
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,740
cause it goes zero to 60 in two seconds
and you want to have the coolest fucking

253
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:30,440
house with the biggest TV and the
fastest internet and all those things

254
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:34,910
sort of compound this technological
innovation cycle that we're on.

255
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,440
So my thought has been for a long time
that what we are is some sort of

256
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:43,760
electronic caterpillar that's going to
give birth some artificial life and that

257
00:11:43,761 --> 00:11:46,940
all of our desire for material
possessions and status and all these

258
00:11:46,941 --> 00:11:51,941
different things is really just us
pushing for this electronic agenda and

259
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:56,830
that this innovation and the
construction of artificial intelligence

260
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:59,980
that's inevitable is eventually going to
be the next stage of life.

261
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:04,960
And that word like huddling ourselves up
in this sort of civilization cocoon and

262
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:07,330
that boom,
out of that cocoon is going to pop some

263
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:10,720
sort of a god being and that this is
what we're here for and this is what

264
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:14,440
we've been doing since we're a monkey's
flinging shit at each other and flipping

265
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:16,150
over cow patties,
looking for mushrooms,

266
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,680
that we are a part of a process and then
if you look at it objectively,

267
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,060
all these traps that you or I or Tom
Cruise or Jim breuer been caught up in

268
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:27,250
when whether it's traps of ego or
jealousy,

269
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:29,350
all these things sort of ensure
movement.

270
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,280
They insure movement and ensure
interactivity and that is going to

271
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:37,570
ensure innovation and progress and
competition and all those things that

272
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:38,560
even we look at it,
we go,

273
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:40,240
this is so pointless.
This is so foolish,

274
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,250
but yet it's so incredibly prevalent.
Not Glorifying it or saying it's

275
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:47,380
definitely the way to go,
but objectively,

276
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:49,720
if you weren't a human and you're
stepping outside of this thing,

277
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:51,070
looking at it from a distance,
you're like,

278
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:54,760
these fuckers are making something.
They might not even know they're making

279
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:54,960
something.

280
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,530
That's they're making concern just hand
out the same way that bees or ants may

281
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:02,100
not be aware of their hive consciousness
and that and the common drive.

282
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,720
But where I disagree with you Joe,
is that,

283
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,700
that you see the end point as being the
materialization of a superconsciousness

284
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,240
through technology.
I see the end point is being a

285
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:18,460
realization amongst us as a species.
Now I know that they're now,

286
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,470
it could be both and there is no,
you know,

287
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,490
there is no reason to,
uh,

288
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,100
you know,
we are just another fucking,

289
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:24,840
are we just another species on this
planet?

290
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,520
Oh,
we will know better than dogs and cows

291
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:27,450
and monkeys.
I don't,

292
00:13:27,451 --> 00:13:27,780
I,
I,

293
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,441
you know,
how can,

294
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,070
how certain we are,
if the path,

295
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:32,940
the very sun that heats us up has a
lifespan.

296
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,560
Yeah.
Where are their inventions as well?

297
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:35,700
The cats and the monkeys.
There's,

298
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:38,220
I'm fuck they invented being cute.
I mean,

299
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,250
they're the real darling in your lap.
You pet them.

300
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,200
They need to find contribution
contributing cause the dog for a walk.

301
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,210
You come up with good ideas,
whereas smelly.

302
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,460
That's fair.
That's fair enough.

303
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,580
I do love my dog bear,
but hold on.

304
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,540
Uh,
but my,

305
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,240
what was my,
what was my point there?

306
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,103
God

307
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,910
breaks.
What you're saying is we should pump the

308
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:01,740
brakes,
we should pump the brakes of this

309
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:04,740
possession and this,
this idea that we're trying to

310
00:14:04,741 --> 00:14:08,940
accomplish these great things by
accumulating things and status and it's

311
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:11,460
all bullshit and it's really about
consciousness more than anything.

312
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,570
In fact,
Bill Hicks I think already said it when

313
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:14,440
he said that,
you know,

314
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:16,180
that we,
we can be explicit,

315
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,290
we can explore space in a,
an hour together and peace.

316
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,390
Not that,
that idea that if we look to our common

317
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,220
drives,
it's like into that hancock all the

318
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:26,560
time.
I've heard him on your show saying like

319
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:26,891
that,
you know,

320
00:14:26,891 --> 00:14:30,430
that what really what's happening is a
bias towards a particular aspect of our

321
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:33,190
own consciousness.
The problem solving brain and like,

322
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:33,670
you know,
there's no,

323
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,130
that those drives are amazing,
but those jobs,

324
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:38,860
they're trying to get somewhere.
Technology is amazing.

325
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,371
We were like,
you know,

326
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:40,750
at the very fact that people bloody here
is,

327
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:43,150
I don't understand any of it.
It's fucking wonderful.

328
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:47,620
But the dominant idea behind it,
one of profit,

329
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,800
that dominating idea and like in a
profit in itself is not necessarily

330
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:53,300
negative,
but profit at all costs.

331
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,520
[inaudible] costs.
So like really,

332
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,830
I'm not saying we should as a species
fucking slow down and dressing felon

333
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,601
fucking,
you know,

334
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:00,770
like Graham and vegetables,
you know,

335
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,750
funny.
Now I want human beings to be glorious.

336
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:05,540
But what I'm saying is that our bias
towards this one particular I'm

337
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:09,770
materialistic idea is preventing us from
realizing that glory because part of our

338
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:10,790
consciousness has been ignored.
