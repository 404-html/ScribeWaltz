1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,833
Hello

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,590
bitches,
man,

3
00:00:03,591 --> 00:00:03,891
it,
it,

4
00:00:03,891 --> 00:00:04,724
it,
it,

5
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,123
you still have those yellow jerseys in 
your house and you have to give them 

6
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:08,344
back into.
No good.

7
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,193
Fuck them.
She put an instagram picture of them 

8
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:11,734
every day.

9
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,690
That was.
Yeah,

10
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:15,560
that.
Yeah,

11
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,510
I'm not going to put that picture up 
again.

12
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,950
That was a great picture though.
Oh,

13
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,420
you chilling on the couch at seven 
Yellow Jersey.

14
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,690
He's on your wall.
I got,

15
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,280
I got a note for that one.
Well,

16
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,020
you're going to get nuked no matter what
you do.

17
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:27,740
Look.
But,

18
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,600
but I,
I look,

19
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,060
I mean they're up.
They're up and uh,

20
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,790
and,
and I'm proud of him.

21
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,680
I really am.
And I'm proud of.

22
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,830
And that's the thing too,
is that as weird as it is,

23
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,664
and as strange as it is,
that there's just a line through those 

24
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,960
years as if they did not happen.
Man,

25
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,943
I,
I had,

26
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,810
I was paid to do a job,
right.

27
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,300
As messy as the job was,
whatever I was paid to do it.

28
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,750
And I did it.
Uh,

29
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,623
and I wanted to win.
I wanted to capture those memories for 

30
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:58,190
myself and for my teammates.
And you can't,

31
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,024
nobody can take those away from me.
I still hold those memories it to 

32
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:03,530
myself.
And um,

33
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,161
yeah,
it's,

34
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:06,080
it's,
it's had a complicated ending.

35
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:07,060
But,
um,

36
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,763
you know,
I still view those as victories and I 

37
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:11,180
still view those memories as good

38
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,640
carrying around the lie and being 
interrogated and questioned.

39
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:19,740
And it was that the hardest part about 
all of it.

40
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,120
You know,
I was,

41
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,310
I was only interrogated there are 
questioned with the press and,

42
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,140
and even,
um,

43
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,531
you know,
God,

44
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:31,400
if it would have been in this day and 
age with,

45
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,253
with,
with twitter and facebook and social 

46
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:37,390
media and it would've,
it would've been a thousand times worse.

47
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,253
I mean,
this was,

48
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,120
you know,
I mean,

49
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,980
this was in the late nineties.
I mean,

50
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:44,050
think about that.
That was a long time ago.

51
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:44,884
And so the level of scrutiny while it 
was high wasn't nearly as high as it 

52
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:50,440
would have been today.
Um,

53
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,560
but yeah,
I mean,

54
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:55,270
once you dig in,
you know,

55
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:56,410
with these,
with these guys,

56
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:57,310
you're,
you're stuck.

57
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,713
So

58
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,730
once you finally came clean,
I mean,

59
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:04,240
obviously there was a lot of blowback,
but was there also a relief?

60
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,920
Um,
not,

61
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,810
not immediately.
Not immediately.

62
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:11,071
I mean,
I,

63
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:11,980
I,
uh,

64
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,560
I get asked that a lot and I think 
people,

65
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,900
um,
people,

66
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,400
people expect me to say,
well,

67
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,420
you know,
it was just this,

68
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,940
it was just this huge relief off your 
shoulders when you,

69
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,250
when you talk to oprah or,
or whatever you did,

70
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:25,084
that,
that you can now move forward and live 

71
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,350
the life of an honest man and et Cetera,
et cetera.

72
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,530
But it's taken me.
Let me just sum it up.

73
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,550
I mean,
sitting here today,

74
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:34,384
having this conversation,
I would much prefer to have this 

75
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:40,360
conversation than the one where I would 
have lied to your fucking face 15 times,

76
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,570
10 years ago.
I'd much rather talk like this.

77
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:45,790
So that's,
that's a relief.

78
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,810
Um,
but,

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,750
but,
you know,

80
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,220
it's not like I walked out of sitting 
with Oprah and was like,

81
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,480
oh my God,
I feel amazing.

82
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,780
That was,
that wasn't asked weapon.

83
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,890
And uh,
so was it like there with Oprah?

84
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,530
She's asking,
she's drilling you,

85
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,050
asking you questions about that start.
She came out,

86
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,270
she came out hot,
yes or no,

87
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,940
yes or no,
yes or no other.

88
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,610
She did a good job.
She did a great job.

89
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:15,130
I thought she did a good job.
I thought it was very compelling.

90
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,993
Yep.
Because the way she structured the 

91
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,010
beginning part of the conversation.
Yeah.

92
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,190
Especially if you're going to do 
something like that on television.

93
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:22,930
You want to capture people and keep them
there.

94
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,520
You kind of have to approach it that 
way.

95
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,803
I thought she did a good job.
I don't know that it wasn't well 

96
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:32,650
received and I.
and in what way?

97
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,310
You mean people didn't like you 
afterwards in that way?

98
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,190
I think there's two things.
Number one,

99
00:03:39,191 --> 00:03:40,024
I,
I wasn't emotionally ready to do that 

100
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:42,430
interview.

101
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,040
I wasn't,
uh,

102
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,190
I wasn't in a place where I think that I
sit today where it's,

103
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,180
it,
it's,

104
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,133
it is a position of contrition and 
understanding the tremendous sense of 

105
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:58,960
betrayal that's out there.
Like my perception of that today is much

106
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:01,420
sharper than it was three years ago when
I sat with her,

107
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,810
the feds and other lawsuits forced my 
hand.

108
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,644
I had to sit there with that because I 
knew I was going to be sitting with her 

109
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:09,604
or with you or with Tom Brokaw or I was 
going to be sitting with a government 

110
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:16,600
lawyer being deposed,
being videoed and being leaked.

111
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,220
So I said,
well,

112
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:19,054
I'm going to go.
I'm going to find the place that I'd 

113
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:21,004
rather sit down and talk about this as 
opposed to a grainy video that the 

114
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,400
government leaks to the world and that's
your coming out party.

115
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,260
So I did that.

116
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,210
But the thing about Oprah is,
is aside from me just not being ready at

117
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:35,560
the time to do it,
you know,

118
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,233
people sensed that,
but most importantly for the diehard 

119
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:44,110
cycling fans and sports fans,
I didn't say enough.

120
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,760
You didn't name names,
you didn't.

121
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,910
You didn't call anybody out.
It wasn't detailed enough.

122
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,740
You're holding back.
You're protecting people.

123
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,603
That's what they said.
That's a very small percentage of the 

124
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:56,440
population for the majority of the 
population.

125
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,830
Those first five minutes was way too 
much information.

126
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,940
They were like,
what the fuck did I just hear?

127
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,760
Like blood bags,
Hipo,

128
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,910
testosterone transfusions,
cheating.

129
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,930
It was way too much.
So you had people that were at one camp,

130
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,480
a smaller camp said he didn't say 
anything.

131
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,230
He's holding back here.
The other campus,

132
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,860
like that's,
that's more than I needed to hear.

133
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,610
And so everybody was pissed.
Well,

134
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,690
I don't know why they would think it's 
too much.

135
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,411
I mean,
I don't know.

136
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:30,610
I don't understand that logic because it
is reality or a grandma in Duluth.

137
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,790
Right.
And,

138
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,653
and you and you support it.
The cancer survivor clause isn't real 

139
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,780
and you hear that.
I mean,

140
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:39,280
you're sitting there going,
uh,

141
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,680
I don't,
I don't like anything about this.

142
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,360
So the,
uh,

143
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,410
so I see because they were also 
supporting lives drawn.

144
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,660
Also supporting,
but the story,

145
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,370
how much of an effect did it have like 
almost immediately on your foundation or

146
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,223
a donor?
Because I was asked to leave the before 

147
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:59,450
that.
And so now I haven't been back.

148
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,160
So I,
I don't know and I'm not,

149
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,380
and I don't ask,
is it still around?

150
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,580
Yeah,
yeah,

151
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,700
but it must have taken a devastating,
I think so.

152
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:12,380
I mean it takes a hit in terms of 
obviously in terms of fundraising,

153
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,550
which directly leads to its,
you know,

154
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,393
its effectiveness in terms of helping 
create change for cancer survivors were 

155
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:21,334
all around the world.

staff layoffs.

I don't know.
