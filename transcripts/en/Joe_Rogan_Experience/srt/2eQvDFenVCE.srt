00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,440
The joe rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the fleshlight.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:04,951
Damn,

3
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:06,510
I forgot to tweet that I was doing this.

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,943
Should I tweet it?

5
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,610
Tweet it while I'm talking about it
while we're talking about the fleshlight.

6
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:11,881
What's this?

7
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:12,261
What we do?

8
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:15,600
We'll have an extended little conversation
about the flashlight while I tweak

9
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:15,811
this.

10
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:17,550
Here we go.

11
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,793
Jokes.

12
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,220
You have a butthole on here that that's
been used as a prop since we started

13
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:24,630
getting sponsored by the flashlight.

14
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,870
And so many comics fingers
are so dirty and nasty.

15
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,711
Now the Butthole,

16
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,020
it looks like a white really bad.

17
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:31,350
Yeah,

18
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,220
it does look like a dirty
butthole and it slept a weird,

19
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,600
like sort of like a really,

20
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,160
uh,

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,810
like not a black person,

22
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:42,450
but like a really dark islander.

23
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:42,990
Yeah.

24
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:43,970
When they have you ever see like,

25
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:44,580
like,

26
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,730
like girls from like the
Filipino Hawaiian girls asshole.

27
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,360
They have,

28
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,610
there's a certain darkness
to the vagina area.

29
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,420
Yeah.

30
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,260
What's that all about?

31
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:52,780
It's just,

32
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,100
you know,

33
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,420
just like some people's
butts are normal color,

34
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:56,400
some people just are purple.

35
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,570
But do you think there's some
evolutionary reason to have your,

36
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:00,840
uh,

37
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,410
your,

38
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,700
your butthole in your vagina?

39
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:03,460
Lips darker.

40
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:03,850
Yeah,

41
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,190
because there's not supposed to fuck it.

42
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,550
You know that there's a
dangerous bitches are better.

43
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:08,590
The dark,

44
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,540
the sweeter the juice.

45
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:09,871
Right,

46
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:10,320
right.

47
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,610
Isn't that what the theory behind that
shit is always fear of a white planet?

48
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,070
What the fuck are we talking about?

49
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:18,000
Go to Joe rogan.net.

50
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,470
Click on the link for the fleshlight and
you can get 15% off the number one sex

51
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:25,820
toy and they have like Zombie flashlights.

52
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,610
Now case you can fuck
a mouth of a vampire.

53
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:30,120
I think.

54
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,331
Oh No,

55
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:31,051
it's even worse now.

56
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:31,980
Now it looks like there's like,

57
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:34,800
it's been damaged in a car
accident and it's just like,

58
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,560
it looks like or feels like it's decaying.

59
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:37,980
Oh,

60
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,140
what the fuck is wrong with people?

61
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,040
Is that like a novelty thing?

62
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,390
I think is,

63
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:41,550
yeah,

64
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,750
the holidays and shit.

65
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:43,200
And you know,

66
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,580
there's a lot of horror fans.

67
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,301
Yeah.

68
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:45,930
Gas,

69
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,860
but to fuck it,

70
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,843
it's one thing.

71
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,430
Maybe it's a novelty one.

72
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,290
Maybe it's like a car that you don't
drive because it's a special edition

73
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,400
corvette or some shit.

74
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,770
So just put it in your garage
and hope it's an investment.

75
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,680
We're also brought to you by on it,

76
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,101
O,

77
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:00,900
n n I t.com.

78
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,400
Makers of Alpha brain.

79
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,840
Alpha brain is a cognitive,

80
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,580
some enhancing.

81
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,050
I always fuck this up.

82
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,000
It's just the pills are
supposed to make you smart.

83
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,400
And I see I don't have
anything planned out.

84
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,050
We never like sat down and said,

85
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:14,550
well this is what we'll
say about Alpha brain.

86
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,100
So I say,

87
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,271
oh,

88
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,790
it's a cognitive enhancing
something or another.

89
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,590
It's fucking real good
for making you fuck man.

90
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,690
Want to feel pretty clear when I'm on it.

91
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,500
But how ironic that when you
start talking about it this,

92
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:26,250
this,

93
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,290
for some reason this
subject makes people mad.

94
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,210
This bringing up this Alpha brain thing.

95
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,200
So I want to say this,

96
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,000
please don't buy it please.

97
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,271
I want,

98
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:33,961
this is what I want you to do.

99
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:37,320
I want you to try find what the
ingredients are and Alpha brain,

100
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,080
look it up online and
on a.com it's available.

101
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,250
Take the exact ingredients of some bulk
stuff that you can buy for much cheaper

102
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,860
than what we did when we put all this
together in like sort of a one-stops

103
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,080
shopping sort of a situation.

104
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,130
Go buy that stuff,

105
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,911
please,

106
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:53,100
please buy it and just try it.

107
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,800
And I know people have positive results.

108
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:56,910
I've talked to people with it.

109
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,900
Some people don't.

110
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:58,950
Some people,

111
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,300
and I don't know whether
that's a subjective thing,

112
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,740
I don't know whether or not they,

113
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:02,950
they,

114
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,560
they can't differentiate
between a good and a bad day,

115
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,090
whether it just doesn't work on them.

116
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:08,680
Where everybody's biologically different.

117
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,240
I mean some people can't eat peanuts.

118
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,620
One peanut no fucking die.

119
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,510
Everyone's system is different.

120
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,643
For me,

121
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,850
the shit works.

122
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,050
I'm not lying to you.

123
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,580
Please stop saying I am.

124
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,290
Stop sending me mean tweets.

125
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,160
It's annoying.

126
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,570
You don't have to buy it.

127
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:23,590
I'm not forcing you to.

128
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:27,190
But to tell me that I'm not
experiencing positive results from it.

129
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,280
And then all these other people that
are taking it in and talking to me about

130
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:31,330
all the great results.

131
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,170
Just to say that we're not selling,

132
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,490
saying,

133
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,210
telling the truth is just insulting and
it's stupid and it doesn't make sense.

134
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,210
You fuckhead you don't
know what I'm feeling.

135
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,910
And by the way,

136
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,480
it's not the placebo effect because
you could have fucking incredible vivid

137
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:48,490
dreams and their vivid dreams to me.

138
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:50,320
I don't remember ever
having dreams like this for,

139
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:51,280
I started taking this shit.

140
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,450
I don't even know if it's more vivid.

141
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:53,160
I think you just,

142
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,740
it like,

143
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,470
I remember it more like you
usually wake up and you forget it.

144
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,690
Now I can remember true.

145
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,040
I know.

146
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,210
Yeah.

147
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,620
How would I know if I don't remember him?

148
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:00,600
Whether or not there were vivid.

149
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,970
Yeah,

150
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,120
but that to me is like stats,

151
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,660
some fucking tangible proof,

152
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,140
man.

153
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,310
And even if it is a placebo,

154
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,210
I don't think it is.

155
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,140
But even if it was,

156
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,180
I liked placebos given give me to me,

157
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,231
giving me a trick me,

158
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,180
trick me with your pet rock trick me.

159
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,220
I'm in this for results.

160
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,910
If you can give me some shit that cures
cancer for some fucking crazy reason.

161
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,530
But meanwhile I was just a sugar pill.

162
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,483
Give it to me,

163
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,060
give it to me.

164
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,490
They should sell pills and placebo
in it and just call it placebo.

165
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,240
I'm not convinced that we have a
handle on how the human brain works.

166
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:28,661
By the way,

167
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,220
we're going to talk to
David Lipton about this.

168
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:32,860
He's going to actually come on the
podcast and talk to us about it,

169
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:33,491
uh,

170
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:34,570
about this subject.

171
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:35,151
So we're,

172
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:39,370
we're setting that up and he's a way
smarter than us on all these subjects.

173
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,730
The fucking Joe Rogan experience is
ready to drop on going old school.

174
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,100
It's just me and Brian today.

175
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,081
Oh,

176
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:47,914
robotics.

177
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,380
[inaudible]

178
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,090
Steve Jobs.

179
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,460
Feminine essence from beyond the grave.

180
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,353
That's what that is.

181
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,640
That's what it seems like.

182
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,040
We were just talking about the apple TV
the other day in New York Times today.

183
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,200
They have apple TV with Siri.

184
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,770
Uh,

185
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,730
2013.

186
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,170
They think it's going to be,

187
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:12,670
that's all rumor right now though,

188
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,060
right?

189
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,751
That's crazy though.

190
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:14,830
We were just talking about what,

191
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:15,963
two days ago?

192
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,451
Well,

193
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,410
didn't we read about it?

194
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,921
No,

195
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:18,341
I'm just,

196
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:18,441
I,

197
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:21,910
I is it just speculation did something
in his biography about he's figured out

198
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:23,380
the TV and then I just like,

199
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,280
Hey Siri,

200
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,160
TV seems like it would make it so,

201
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:26,621
so yeah.

202
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:28,210
So you read the whole biography already?

203
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:28,451
No,

204
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:28,601
no.

205
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:29,470
I'm still reading it right now.

206
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,910
It's a lot of people are angry with him.

207
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,030
A lot of people are saying because
the cup to the fleshlight in case you

208
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,040
wondered what was a gentleman
that's put that away,

209
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,933
put that away.

210
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,880
A lot of people like going,

211
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:40,191
God,

212
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:41,180
he's such a Douche bag.

213
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:43,580
Like he like he accomplished so much.

214
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:43,801
Yeah.

215
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:44,930
I had this brilliant vision.

216
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:45,201
Yeah.

217
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:47,150
He followed through and
create the greatest computers,

218
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:47,984
known demand.

219
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,420
But everybody just keeps
saying he's a douchebag.

220
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,290
Well,

221
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,000
you have to be true though.

222
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:55,520
I thought you didn't see this
is what really bothers me.

223
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:55,820
Right.

224
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,960
Because I always saw him.

225
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,710
I will.

226
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,000
This guy's fucking cool.

227
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,140
He's like a Buddhist.

228
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,910
He's obviously really intelligent.

229
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:03,290
He's so beloved.

230
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:03,770
I mean,

231
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,710
how is there ever been a more beloved CEO?

232
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,101
I mean,

233
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:08,570
that guy was a God damn rock star.

234
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:12,580
Steve Jobs would get out on that stage
and those geeks would freak the fuck out.

235
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,160
There was like,

236
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,090
he's here,

237
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,410
he's leading us.

238
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,410
It's like he was leading a movement.

239
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,980
It wasn't just like he's a
CEO of a technology company.

240
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,230
He was a part of this apple movement.

241
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:29,090
And also fueled by that sort of
underdog thing that everybody loves.

242
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,490
People love being an underdog man.

243
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,580
They love being in the
fucking unknown band,

244
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,061
you know?

245
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,600
Or knowing about the unknown band and
going to see them before they broke before

246
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:39,470
they go mainstream.

247
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,030
People love like small things against
the fucking oppressive Microsoft regime.

248
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,830
Fuck you windows.

249
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,551
I'll never,

250
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:47,750
why windows?

251
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,310
I'll fucking Mac till I die.

252
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,870
There's something weird about that.

253
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:55,160
And there's some Unix dorks that do that
right now and Linux dorks and you know,

254
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,380
so I think it was part of that,

255
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:58,790
that he would all of a sudden made this,

256
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,810
this little underdog successful and it
was blossoming in front of everybody's

257
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:03,230
eyes.

258
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,140
So you get to tell your friends,

259
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:04,580
oh yeah,

260
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,890
fucking Max are up 2% this week.

261
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,371
You know,

262
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:07,761
and like,

263
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,610
you know the number one stock and
the stock market and people would,

264
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:11,060
it would,

265
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,940
it was like really like you're
rooting for the fucking buffalo bills.

266
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:14,480
You know,

267
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,850
it might as well have been some
baseball team that you were,

268
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:17,684
you were on.

269
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,220
It wasn't just this operating system
thing and this guy was like a fucking hero

270
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:22,431
man.

271
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:23,150
It was like a heroin,

272
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,170
a sitcom or,

273
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:26,030
or a a TV show rather,

274
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:26,361
you know,

275
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:29,840
like he came along and all of a sudden
he's leading these people on this fucking

276
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,980
[inaudible] episode adventure where he
keeps bringing you cooler and Cooler

277
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,370
Shit,

278
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:34,731
you know,

279
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:35,031
and you,

280
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:35,301
you,

281
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:35,691
you know,

282
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:36,210
as long as you,

283
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,100
I'm a Mac person,

284
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:39,080
I'm down with Mac and
then everybody sort of,

285
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:39,531
you know,

286
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:43,370
you either became macro PC but if
you are Mac boy that's your guy.

287
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,063
You know,

288
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,170
like him being called an asshole
and hard to work with and stuff.

289
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,640
He probably had half to be,

290
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,630
he had a vision and no one else is
understanding what he's thinking,

291
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:57,860
but he has to make sure it goes through
to like what he's thinking in his head

292
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,630
on paper to a product.

293
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,580
And there's people probably
putting their 2 cents and like,

294
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:01,941
no,

295
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:02,810
we shouldn't do that.

296
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,060
And it probably was like he
was a controlling aspect,

297
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:05,894
but you know what?

298
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,400
Those all those people right now,

299
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,020
they all fucking get it.

300
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,263
You know,

301
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:13,730
like the iPhone probably was weird when
he first was trying to talk about it.

302
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,030
You know,

303
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:14,360
it's all,

304
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:14,631
it's like,

305
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:17,390
look at all the different people working
in all the various companies and just

306
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:18,081
think about this.

307
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,210
How much of yourself are you really,

308
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:23,510
truly willing to give further
your company's success?

309
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,520
How much of yourself do you and how much,

310
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,170
how intelligent are you truly?

311
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,250
How well read are you?

312
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,690
How introspective or you,

313
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:31,070
how objective are you?

314
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,230
Are you really honest
about your own ideas?

315
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,730
Are you immersed in your ego?

316
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,660
And if you don't have a
handle on all of those things,

317
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:40,760
if you don't like have answers
to all of those questions.

318
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,380
A guy like Steve jobs comes along and
he can do some shit that you can't do.

319
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,250
Okay.

320
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,390
Because that guy will,

321
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,400
he will work til he drops.

322
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,290
He's super fucking smart.

323
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,670
He's done LSD.

324
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:54,890
He said it was like most
important things of his life,

325
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,591
you know.

326
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:56,730
I mean he had some,

327
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,151
you know,

328
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:58,530
he had some flaws for sure,

329
00:08:58,531 --> 00:08:59,790
but he was also this,

330
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,163
you know,

331
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,150
it's really like a cliche,

332
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:03,511
you know,

333
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:05,130
the star that shines twice as bright,

334
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:06,180
lasts half as long.

335
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,500
But it really almost is.

336
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:07,830
I mean,

337
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,410
I can't say that he
caused his own disease.

338
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:10,681
Right.

339
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:15,090
But I can't think that it helps to work
like a fucking demon to wear like a man

340
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:20,091
possessed to live the company he worked
on the day he died in the hospital room,

341
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:22,890
he was finishing off a certain product,

342
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:25,590
which some are saying the iPhone
five some are saying to it,

343
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:28,650
the Apple TV and that he
did on the day he died.

344
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,480
That's so crazy.

345
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,430
I guess he just figured,

346
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:32,851
fuck it.

347
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:34,440
I'll just ride this bitch
right into the beach.

348
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,040
Yeah.

349
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,880
Amazing.

350
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,720
Amazing.

351
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,890
But what an impact.

352
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:41,460
You need to think about like the impact
that that guy had on all the different,

353
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:43,950
different human beings
who enjoyed his products,

354
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:44,701
us included.

355
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:44,881
You know,

356
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:46,110
we're both Mac Dorks,

357
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:46,981
you know,

358
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:48,240
I've considered pcs.

359
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:49,530
I fuck around with them a little bit.

360
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,341
They're beautiful too.

361
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:51,630
They have great operating system.

362
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:53,640
It's way better than the
old operating systems,

363
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,740
but God damn it.

364
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,850
If I don't know a million
people with viruses,

365
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,661
God damn,

366
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:57,781
if,

367
00:09:57,781 --> 00:09:59,460
I don't know everybody I talked to,

368
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:02,730
he's got some new thing where they went
to a porn site and now every time they

369
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:03,750
turn in their fucking computer,

370
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:04,620
they see dicks.

371
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,380
You know,

372
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:06,960
it's just,

373
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,171
I mean,

374
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,220
that happens all the time.

375
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:09,120
Get a bigger dick,

376
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:10,890
got a bigger Dick and get a bigger dick.

377
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,881
Like God damn it.

378
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:14,760
You fuck like Dylan infect you
with a big Dick Commercial?

379
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,941
Well,

380
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:15,960
it's kind of like your message board.

381
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:17,660
Anytime somebody gets pink or anything.

382
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,660
And I like putting the pink room.

383
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:19,740
If they're really bad,

384
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,500
used to change talktalk's cars,

385
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,450
which is the worst disease
Dick we could find on.

386
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,400
I actually asked people to stop
doing that because it got obsessive.

387
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,380
I don't want to call anybody out or what.

388
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,131
The one guy did it,

389
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,000
he admitted it was like,

390
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:33,430
that's me.

391
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,721
I'm like,

392
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:34,200
dude,

393
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,620
I'm gonna fucking cocktails.

394
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,480
Have you given out?

395
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,930
He'd give it out like hundreds
of them and it's so homophobic.

396
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,411
I used to,

397
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:41,310
but you know,

398
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,150
just to start gesture story,

399
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,300
I don't know if you're
going to post anymore,

400
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:49,410
but he was one that I gave a cocktail
or two and he was really a funny photo

401
00:10:49,411 --> 00:10:53,730
because the Dick was so small and what
I never told anybody is that every day I

402
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:55,080
made a little bit smaller,

403
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,160
a little bit smaller,

404
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,120
a little bit smarter.

405
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,950
I told there was no dick and no one ever,

406
00:10:58,951 --> 00:10:59,784
never noticed.

407
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,830
It takes the most ridiculous dedication.

408
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,960
Why did you do that?

409
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,160
I don't know because the days of this,

410
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,620
I think it was like probably seven days,

411
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:11,910
but it was,

412
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,193
he was,

413
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,780
he was so upset because I think it
was one of the first cocktail hours.

414
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:17,010
He was so upset that,

415
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,080
that he got such a horrible Dick.

416
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,330
Okay,

417
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,061
it's so small.

418
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:21,920
What the fuck dude?

419
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:25,080
And that is rude to make
people post with an Avatar,

420
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:25,710
someone's deck.

421
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,510
But some of those guys are dicks.

422
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:27,810
Right.

423
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,380
You know,

424
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,950
it's like there's no better way to
discourage douchey behavior than to punish

425
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:32,750
people for it.

426
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,280
And it's not like it's a real punishment.

427
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,250
So fucking message board.

428
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:36,120
You don't have to be there.

429
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,480
You know,

430
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,680
you don't want to be there
and I'll stop you there.

431
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,641
But for some people,

432
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:38,911
man,

433
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:41,370
you put him in that pink room and
they go fucking ballistic on you.

434
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,660
It's fascinating.

435
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,830
It's fascinating to watch.

436
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,691
I mean the,

437
00:11:44,691 --> 00:11:44,881
the,

438
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:49,881
the special ed room is really
a fascinating experiment
because it's like the

439
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:52,290
Stanford prison studies that they did,

440
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:52,651
you know,

441
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:56,960
when they like students like pretend
to be prison guards and then other

442
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,250
students,

443
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,280
they had to cut though short
because people get crazy.

444
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:00,450
Right.

445
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:00,640
You know,

446
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:00,970
they got,

447
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,120
they got nutty and they started behaving
as if it was like a real prison.

448
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:05,260
They've got like really creepy.

449
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,450
They had to like cut the experiments.

450
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:06,780
Sure.

451
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,400
And it wasn't very many days and it was
like seven days or something like that.

452
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:13,240
I'd have to re reread it over and over
again to really get a handle on it.

453
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:16,510
But the idea that you would tell
them that can only post in one form,

454
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,640
now all of a sudden it's like prison.

455
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,750
It's really weird.

456
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:21,520
It's like the fucking trapped in here.

457
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,473
Meanwhile,

458
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,230
you're on the Internet.

459
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:23,501
Every,

460
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:25,000
everyone on the board can read it,

461
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,080
they can read it.

462
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,250
It's just like what's been with what we
decided is we're going to have to forums

463
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,280
and one form is essentially uncensored
except for I don't all out autoplays or

464
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,740
you can't have autoplays,

465
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,920
you can't trick people.

466
00:12:37,921 --> 00:12:39,370
I can't Rick Roll people,

467
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:39,941
you know,

468
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:41,140
nothing stupid like that,

469
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:41,974
then we'll just ban you.

470
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,030
But other than that,

471
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,130
you can pretty much do whatever
the fuck you want unless you're,

472
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:45,401
you know,

473
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:49,060
if someone tunes in though and finds out
that you're a super content there and

474
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:49,391
then you're like,

475
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:50,890
what does this guy even to here for,

476
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:51,351
what's the point?

477
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:51,970
And then there'll be,

478
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,803
we'll just ban you.

479
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,400
But I find myself hanging out more in a
special ed room than the regular form.

480
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,240
Like I go only to the podcast foreign.

481
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,160
And then once in a while,

482
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:01,000
good at Special Ed.

483
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,530
Like I don't even go to the regular form.

484
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,410
I probably gone twice in the last year.

485
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:05,680
Um,

486
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,980
I just started going into the Special
Ed Forum recently and checking,

487
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:11,080
cause some guys actually
will post some cool shit.

488
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,280
They're just assholes.

489
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:12,721
You know,

490
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:13,720
they'll post some cool shit,

491
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:16,750
but then they'll get online
and call somebody a nigger
or call somebody a faggot

492
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:17,081
and you're like,

493
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:17,560
okay,

494
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,191
what the fuck?

495
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:19,024
Come on man,

496
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,290
what are you doing?

497
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,550
There's not a need for this.

498
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,390
This is stupid.

499
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,210
This is like,

500
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,010
you know,

501
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:26,170
especially when a lot
of times it's like no,

502
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,000
no point to escalating.

503
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,490
Like people would just
escalate for no reason.

504
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:30,921
You know?

505
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:31,780
And I wonder how he's,

506
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:35,350
if it's like the name shit talking one
on one because then we change it for a

507
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:35,980
little while.

508
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,580
We change it.

509
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,001
I did.

510
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:38,500
I changed it for a short period of time,

511
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,060
but I don't remember what I called it.

512
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,990
What theme are you on?

513
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,220
Are you on the blue or the black?

514
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,083
I like the blue.

515
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,460
Yeah,

516
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,141
I'm on the black.

517
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:47,020
I went back to the black and I think
in the black it used to be on a sign.

518
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:49,430
Is that shit talking one
on one and then that's it.

519
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,030
That was the art drawing.

520
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,770
I think it was like an old drive through
movie movie theater or something.

521
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,650
I can't remember for what people don't
know what the fuck we're talking about.

522
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:57,130
There's you,

523
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,030
when you click on the,

524
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:01,240
there's like a wink at the pot of money
somewhere in the message board that

525
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,330
allows you to choose from
different styles of message board.

526
00:14:04,331 --> 00:14:07,270
It's either black with white
font or blue with black font.

527
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:07,990
Right?

528
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,210
Like a really light blue that
a lot of people think is gay.

529
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,140
But I like it.

530
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,160
No I'm usually on that.

531
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,150
But I switched back to black.

532
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:16,300
I like it because it's
reminds me of sunny skies,

533
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:17,021
blue skies,

534
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:17,801
I like blue skies,

535
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:18,634
they make me happy.

536
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,370
So I look at that and
I like the way it is.

537
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,550
I think there's a direct correlation
between like looking at like certain dark

538
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:26,530
dark colors and having dark thoughts.

539
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,341
You know,

540
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:29,350
I think there is a
correlation between those two.

541
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,101
You know,

542
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:33,400
I think maybe the message board would
be less country if people just use the

543
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:33,880
blue.

544
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,331
Have you ever,

545
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,630
have you ever owned a house or an
apartment that just had like really bright

546
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:38,680
yellow walls?

547
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,790
I like like bright light,

548
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,570
like kitchen,

549
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,250
like bright yellow maybe.

550
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,180
It's so nice.

551
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,390
You always feel happy and
clean when you're in it.

552
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,140
Really?

553
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,950
Yeah.

554
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,730
Try it out.

555
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,090
Try it.

556
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,710
Find a room and just
paint it bright yellow.

557
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:51,501
You'll be surprised.

558
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:52,220
It's weird.

559
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,390
What the fuck is that all about?

560
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,040
It's just exactly what you're saying.

561
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,110
It's just one of those colors.

562
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:56,811
It makes you feel good.

563
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:57,110
Yeah.

564
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,180
The Sun obviously.

565
00:14:58,181 --> 00:14:58,300
Yeah.

566
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:58,530
Right.

567
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,530
And Blue Sky yellow the sun.

568
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:00,980
Yeah,

569
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,910
that totally makes sense.

570
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:02,091
You know?

571
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:04,850
That's what I mean when you talk about
people that live in places like Seattle

572
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:05,810
where it rains constantly.

573
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:06,830
What's the number one complaint?

574
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:07,521
They don't get sun.

575
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:10,490
They get depressed and that's why
so many of them commit suicide.

576
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,330
You know what I mean?

577
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,440
That's like a big issue,

578
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:12,741
man.

579
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:15,260
It's really a vitamin
D deficiency as well.

580
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,363
Apparently your brain,

581
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,670
your body makes vitamin D
while you're in the sun,

582
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:20,481
like while you're in the sun,

583
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:21,830
your body is producing a vitamin.

584
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:22,664
It's pretty interesting,

585
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,391
you know?

586
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,881
And uh,

587
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,670
that only happens in your body like that.

588
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,070
You know you could eat it and you
can supplement it in pill form,

589
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,990
but you only get it make your body only
makes it if you're in the sunlight that

590
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,380
it's really,

591
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,530
really kind of fucking interesting.

592
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,070
You need it,

593
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,550
you know,

594
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,750
it's like important to health.

595
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,220
Before I moved to California,

596
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:39,560
I lived in his house and every
room was a different color.

597
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,000
Like my office was dark,

598
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:43,520
Crimson Red and my kitchen
one is bright yellow,

599
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:45,260
exact etc. But it's weird.

600
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,890
Each room did have like a certain
feel to it when you were in it.

601
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,540
Like the bedroom was black Wallace,

602
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:53,270
which I thought was the worst idea
ever and that was just horrible.

603
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:54,771
Yeah,

604
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:57,410
it's horrible looking at the
comedy store and sleeping.

605
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,860
That's someone who wants to fuck in the
dark if you want to fucking dark walls.

606
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,910
Just darkness.

607
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,463
Yeah.

608
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,550
That's some golf sharing.

609
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,050
Some people want to fuck
with the lights out,

610
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,063
you know?

611
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,993
That's weird.

612
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,020
You know?

613
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,820
Have you ever be able to check
and she said turn the lights out?

614
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:14,781
No,

615
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:15,770
I kind of like it.

616
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:16,220
Damn.

617
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,180
I don't like it bright though.

618
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:17,741
I don't like it.

619
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:17,950
You know,

620
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,420
like it was just like
super bright gynecological.

621
00:16:20,421 --> 00:16:21,260
That's what I like it.

622
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,490
I like a like a showroom,

623
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:23,480
like a car showroom.

624
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:24,403
Oh Wow.

625
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:25,971
See,

626
00:16:25,971 --> 00:16:27,980
I think if I manscaped
war I wouldn't mind it,

627
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,420
but I feel like it's
going to kill the deal.

628
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,550
It probably will.

629
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,873
Probably will.

630
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,190
Did you see the photo of Steven Tyler?

631
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,350
Uh,

632
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,540
we,

633
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,390
we talked about like how I almost
slipped and killed myself in the bathtub.

634
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:45,260
He did it at a hotel room and he
slipped and fell and he said that,

635
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:45,451
you know,

636
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:46,284
it was just,

637
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,560
he,

638
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:46,821
you know,

639
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:49,650
he slipped nothing to it and he,

640
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,391
the photo of him,

641
00:16:50,391 --> 00:16:52,070
he like knocked teeth out.

642
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,600
He's got a black eye.

643
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,070
I don't know if you can
see this right here,

644
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,560
but it fucked him up,

645
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:58,230
man.

646
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,590
That's just from taking a bath
and accidentally slipping.

647
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,403
Whoa.

648
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,300
That is nuts.

649
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,430
That picture is fucking nuts,

650
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:08,264
man.

651
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,620
Holy Shit.

652
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:10,670
Wow.

653
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,720
Well he got jacked,

654
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,071
clumsy.

655
00:17:13,071 --> 00:17:13,640
Fuck.

656
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,411
Have you ever done it though?

657
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:17,750
It'd be just like slimy feed
or almost fallen backwards,

658
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:19,790
which is the most terrifying thing,

659
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,811
which is,

660
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:21,021
you know,

661
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:22,310
if you fall and hit the back of your head,

662
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:23,330
that's how people die.

663
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,890
If you're sloppy,

664
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:25,641
you're tired,

665
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:25,971
you know,

666
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:26,510
whatever,

667
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,240
you're not really 100% paying attention,

668
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,680
you know,

669
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,221
Shit.

670
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:31,500
You could,

671
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:31,860
you,

672
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,900
you can get slippery.

673
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,870
Bathtubs are fucking dangerous as shit.

674
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:36,230
I mean,

675
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,450
uh,

676
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,640
especially the old ones,

677
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,870
those cast iron ones.

678
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,471
You know,

679
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:41,720
if you have an old place
and you have a old tub,

680
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,390
those old tubs were fucking iron dude.

681
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,410
I mean,

682
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,370
it's like fallen.

683
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,380
Think about falling
backwards and hitting iron.

684
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,220
That's essentially

685
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,850
like getting hit in the head by the world.

686
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:54,961
You know,

687
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:55,591
that's what it's like.

688
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:59,190
The world came down on you and
hit you and that's what it's like.

689
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,551
It's like,

690
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,480
fuck man,

691
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:01,650
you get jacked.

692
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,140
That's like really dangerous.

693
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:06,690
If you ever watched those fights
where people get in street fights,

694
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,080
a lot of videos on youtube
and guys get knocked out.

695
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:12,480
And what's terrifying is
when they get knocked out,

696
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:13,710
they fall back in their head,

697
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:14,790
hits the concrete.

698
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:15,811
Whoa.

699
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:16,501
That's scary,

700
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:16,860
dude.

701
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,240
I've seen that happen in real life.

702
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,740
It is terrifying.

703
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,510
It's like a bowling ball
dropping on the guards.

704
00:18:21,511 --> 00:18:22,300
Terrified.

705
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,270
So dangerous to your head.

706
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,830
Just Bonk,

707
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,630
just skull.

708
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:30,810
And who knows what the fuck
is going on inside that skull?

709
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,700
How much bleeding there is,

710
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:34,200
how much swelling there is.

711
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,191
I mean your brain,

712
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:37,440
it's just jam packed.

713
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,350
That one dude's Jack from getting hit
in the head and they're saying that he's

714
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:42,480
at might have brain damage that the vet,

715
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:44,520
they got shot at the occupy Oakland.

716
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,320
You how fucked is that man?

717
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,950
Cops are targeting the
fucking people throwing these,

718
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:50,610
these uh,

719
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,250
tear gas canisters out on that explode.

720
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,260
Then flash grenades.

721
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,180
There's video of this
guy laying on the ground.

722
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,630
Injured people went up to try
to help him and they shoot them.

723
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:00,900
No,

724
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,081
no.

725
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:02,820
They throw the grenade at them.

726
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,471
Flash bomb.

727
00:19:04,471 --> 00:19:05,680
Athema tear gas bomb after,

728
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,150
you know,

729
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,340
they blow up and they,

730
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,711
you know,

731
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:10,740
if they hit you in the fucking
head while they're exploding,

732
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,030
like you can get jacked.

733
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,410
But it's just so sad to see these
cops are targeting these people.

734
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,280
It's like,

735
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,671
man,

736
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:21,780
what is this fucking Chicago in
the 60s what the fuck is this?

737
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:22,500
You know what I mean?

738
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,470
I can't believe that
these are our citizens,

739
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,190
that these cops are our friends
and our neighbors and our citizens.

740
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,980
These occupy people
aren't hurting anybody.

741
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:32,350
Man.

742
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,060
Your job is to serve and protect and
you don't need to protect anybody from

743
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:36,894
these people.

744
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,400
These people are nonviolent.

745
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:41,430
They're not hurting anybody
to serve and protect.

746
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,250
What part of that is throw a
fucking grenade at someone's head.

747
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,350
Especially some guy who did two tours,

748
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,340
a fucking duty,

749
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,050
two tours of duty overseas.

750
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:53,310
He comes back and he's in
critical condition from the
fellow citizen of fellow

751
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:57,660
American throwing a fucking Flashman
had out a guy who's paid by this

752
00:19:57,661 --> 00:19:59,280
motherfucker's tax dollars.

753
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,510
That's a sad,

754
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:01,440
sad statement,

755
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:02,010
man.

756
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:06,000
It's sad that people are jumping up
and down about this and the politicians

757
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:09,900
aren't fucking condemning this and that
people aren't all over the news saying,

758
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:13,440
this can never happen again and we need
to fucking sit down with these cops and

759
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:16,620
have a long conversation as to
what your fucking job entails.

760
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,290
Your job entails helping people out,

761
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:19,770
man,

762
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,850
that's what you're here for.

763
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,121
You,

764
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:25,920
our citizens that have extra power and
we give you that extra power so that you

765
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:27,120
make things nicer.

766
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,560
You're not making things nicer by throwing
flash grenades on fucking veterans.

767
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,420
That's not making anything nicer.

768
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,310
And that's the only reason to have cops.

769
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,430
The only reason I have comps is
to keep the Douche bags down,

770
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,910
to keep them away from the nice people
and then help the nice people in the nice

771
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:42,744
people in trouble.

772
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,530
That's it.

773
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,440
And when the nice people get angry
because the bags are fucking robbing them,

774
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,010
you don't throw grenades at them.

775
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,570
You're fucking cunts.

776
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,270
I can't believe it happened
in California also.

777
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,261
There's no joke,

778
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:53,530
bro.

779
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:53,590
Yeah,

780
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,330
but like New York City it perfect example,

781
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:56,890
the the governor or whatever said,

782
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:57,161
hey,

783
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:57,401
you know,

784
00:20:57,401 --> 00:21:00,970
get rid of all these protestors
in a certain area of New York.

785
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,170
And the cops were like,

786
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:02,381
no,

787
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:02,771
we're not.

788
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:04,000
They're not doing anything bad.

789
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,960
We're not doing this.

790
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:06,340
I don't think you ever been to Oakland.

791
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:06,821
Yeah,

792
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:07,031
I know.

793
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:07,511
But still,

794
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:08,470
it's no joke.

795
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,710
You need to go and hang out
in Oakland for a little while.

796
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:11,981
Oh,

797
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:13,060
next time I needed an abortion,

798
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:13,894
I'll go there.

799
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,720
Get abortions in La still.

800
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:19,090
I know want abortions
are illegal in the state.

801
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,190
Oakland was still have a voice.

802
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,740
Right?

803
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,730
You'll be able to go there.

804
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:23,321
Yeah,

805
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:25,470
but I so like in New York there,

806
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,001

807
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:26,700

when I'm driving a station wagon.

818
00:21:37,911 --> 00:21:38,744
And that's how white I am.

819
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,120

I Tom McCormick lives in Oakland now.

828
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:52,100
Oakland is the weirdest
combination of like gangsters.

829
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,020
Hi Mccormick lives.

830
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:53,340
Yup.

Yup.

832
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,970
Gangsters and hippies and like,

833
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,460
and and weed people.

834
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,080
They call it Oaksterdam.

835
00:21:59,370 --> 00:21:59,591
You know,

836
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:01,300
they have like Oaksterdam University,

837
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:05,890
like we don't even know the level of
medical weed that the state has reached.

838
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,720
The reason why all these
people are clamoring,

839
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,490
and apparently this was just released,

840
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:13,990
that it wasn't Obama's idea to go after
these medical marijuana dispensaries,

841
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:14,380
right.

842
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,200
It was the attorney general or
the whoever the fuck gets to was,

843
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:18,491
it was,

844
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:18,860
it was.

845
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,050
It was somebody in California,

846
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:21,850
one of the rare people in the Senate,

847
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,800
or we're talking,

848
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:24,670
we're talking so nuts.

849
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,300
I said,

850
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,500
I didn't even know the set it is.

851
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:27,520
I know what that means.

852
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:28,420
That's like some of them.

853
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,340
I found it on Twitter,

854
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:30,881
so I'll,

855
00:22:30,881 --> 00:22:32,350
I'll retweet it or something like that.

856
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,184
But what it is a,

857
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,540
what essentially they're saying is that
Obama is not respected enough by these

858
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:37,841
people,

859
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:39,100
for them to follow his lead.

860
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:44,460
What he said when he was in office was
that he wants to only attack or only go

861
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:48,220
after the people that are violating
both federal and state law.

862
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,060
Marijuana is illegal
across the board federally.

863
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,270
So as long as they were
following state law,

864
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,920
he would leave them alone.

865
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,990
And the state law,

866
00:22:59,050 --> 00:22:59,530
you know,

867
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,191
it's fucking,

868
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:03,250
it's pretty tricky because it's
really supposed to be nonprofit.

869
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,031
You know?

870
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:04,391
I don't,

871
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:07,660
I don't think you're supposed to be able
to make millions of dollars and a lot

872
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:12,220
of these guys are just fucking balling
and I support it 100% but I'm just

873
00:23:12,221 --> 00:23:13,030
stating the facts.

874
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:18,030
The real true facts is that we don't
even know the level of medical marijuana

875
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,440
that's hit like California.

876
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:22,870
Our area is really like on the outskirts.

877
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,330
The real hive of it is
in northern California.

878
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,540
The real hive of it is an Oakland where
they're having classes where they're

879
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,860
teaching people how to
fucking set grow ops up there.

880
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,320
Like people are signing up
for classes and it's like,

881
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,751
you know,

882
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:36,790
they'd given degrees on
how to fucking grow weed.

883
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,380
It's really fascinating shit.

884
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:39,520
They're taking it to the next level.

885
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:40,840
They're teaching people how to do it.

886
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:41,530
They have these big,

887
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,920
and so the government obviously
feels threatened by this,

888
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,381
this,

889
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:46,220
this along

890
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,530
with this whole occupy
Wall Street movement.

891
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:51,140
And Pete when when you
get hippies with money,

892
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,070
shit gets dangerous as fuck cause
you got to a place like Oaksterdam,

893
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:56,120
you place like it just,

894
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:58,040
let's say there was a place they're
going to open up in boulder,

895
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,140
I think it was like 30,000 square feet.

896
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,430
It was three stories.

897
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:02,330
I don't know if it ever opened,

898
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:04,160
but that was like the people,

899
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,090
people who are proven it,

900
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,360
people in boulder like fine bringing
in just not going to bother us.

901
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,590
And when they were doing that,

902
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:13,550
people are thinking how much money can
I place like this bring in millions of

903
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:13,551
dollars,

904
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:14,930
millions and millions and millions.

905
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,740
It could be incredible amounts of money
if you really stop and think about it.

906
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:22,190
If they have just radical
open commerce on marijuana,

907
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,140
how many people are going to
grow their own fucking shit?

908
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,040
Not me.

909
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,311
I'm not,

910
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:26,390
I don't have that kind of time.

911
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,631
Dude,

912
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,010
I can't be watering plants.

913
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,640
Okay.

914
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,301
I got kids,

915
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,021
I got shit to do.

916
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:30,854
I've got hobbies.

917
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:31,880
I don't want to water plants.

918
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:34,100
It might be interesting if I
decided to take it on as a hobby.

919
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:34,771
But if it,

920
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:37,490
if I could just go down the
street and buy weed at the store,

921
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:39,170
if I can go to seven 11 and buy some weed,

922
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,020
cause that's how it should,

923
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,853
it could be.

924
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,350
It really could be like that.

925
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,940
And when that happens,

926
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,960
those places,

927
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:48,680
those places that like those
medical marijuana places or whoever,

928
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:52,580
there's decides to open up like
a big flashy emporium of weed,

929
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,340
they can become very wealthy
and then they become,

930
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,170
they can become very powerful.

931
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,640
When someone becomes wealthy,

932
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,630
they become powerful.

933
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,640
And as they're seeing
people accumulate wealth,

934
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:04,700
they're trying to stop it and then not
trying to stop because they're protecting

935
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:05,450
anybody.

936
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,490
They're not protecting any civilians.

937
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:07,790
You know,

938
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,620
by stopping these people
from making money.

939
00:25:09,621 --> 00:25:11,510
If these people are making
money and paying taxes on it,

940
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,240
you should be happy they're
contributing to the economy.

941
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:14,811
This is good.

942
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:15,680
This is not bad.

943
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,910
We need to change the law.

944
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:18,200
You don't need to make it so it's legally,

945
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:19,880
it's either legal or it's not illegal.

946
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,320
It's legal to sell it to people.

947
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:22,670
It should be illegal to
make money off of it.

948
00:25:22,671 --> 00:25:24,680
You're telling me that marijuana
can't make money off of it,

949
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:25,940
even though it's legal as a drug.

950
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,680
But they can make money off of opium.

951
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:28,820
They can make money off of heroin,

952
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:32,630
they can make money off of cocaine and
fucking oxycontin's and nicotine and

953
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,260
alcohol.

954
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,250
They can make money off that,

955
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:35,330
but they can't make money off week.

956
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,291
Fuck you.

957
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:37,430
This is an injust law.

958
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,230
This is an injust law and it's nonsense.

959
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,690
And the reason why is because
they're scared of hippies with money,

960
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,270
hippies with money or dangerous as fuck.

961
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:44,481
Man.

962
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:45,590
If you've got a bunch of people,

963
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,150
idealists who really,

964
00:25:47,151 --> 00:25:52,100
truly want to change the world and all
of a sudden their richest fuck dude,

965
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,170
things can get slippery,

966
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:54,840
things can,

967
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,750
it's slippery when we people
join together and say,

968
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:01,970
you've got to recognize the weed dollar.

969
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,540
All right cause there's a stoner dollar
out there and it's you and it's me and

970
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:09,120
it's a lot of other fucking people and
we buy shit and we pay shit and we pay

971
00:26:09,121 --> 00:26:12,230
our taxes and we contribute to
society and we're not bad people.

972
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,000
And at a certain point in time,

973
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,010
you're going to have to
respect that stoner dollar.

974
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,761
Cause if you don't,

975
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:19,550
that Shit's going to come back and bite
you in the ass because there's too many

976
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:20,090
of us now.

977
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,460
There's too many of us and
now because of the Internet,

978
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:23,780
just like occupy Wall Street,

979
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:24,740
just like anonymous.

980
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,000
We're United,

981
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,350
we're all United.

982
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:29,480
Likeminded people are United now.

983
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:33,320
People who exchange ideas and evolve
their own ideas on the internet and share,

984
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,740
share a viewpoint with each
other and learn from each other.

985
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,970
We're United now.

986
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,260
This is a different time,

987
00:26:39,261 --> 00:26:39,441
man.

988
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:42,950
You can't just control people like you
used to be able to control people in the

989
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,820
60s and the 70s we couldn't
talk to each other.

990
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,790
We had a huddle in our fucking homes
at night listening to the radio,

991
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,980
hoping everything was going to be okay.

992
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,720
Well this isn't that day man.

993
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,350
These cops that are staging these fucking
fake shootings at schools so they can

994
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:56,760
check the kids for drugs.

995
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,331
You know,

996
00:26:57,331 --> 00:27:01,590
you're just horse for some pharmaceutical
company from some giant conglomerate

997
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,030
and the only reason you're doing that,

998
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:05,040
it's because the weed
dollar hasn't hit you yet.

999
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,780
Once the weed dollar hits you,

1000
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:07,980
you're going to shut the fuck up.

1001
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,530
You're going to have to shut the fuck
up because the weed people are going to

1002
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,050
help the cops that weed
people are going to promote,

1003
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:13,381
you know,

1004
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:13,581
a,

1005
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:16,230
a good relationship with
the police officers.

1006
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,940
They'll contribute just like,

1007
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:18,331
you know,

1008
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:18,960
these fucking,

1009
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,530
these giant banks are contributing to
occupy Wall Street down in Wall Street.

1010
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:25,980
These banks for four point $6 million
was donated to the New York police

1011
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:29,970
department so that they can fucking
like look out for all these assholes.

1012
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:30,211
These,

1013
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:32,820
these are rich fucking
money thieving cunts.

1014
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,841
Think about that,

1015
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:34,051
you know,

1016
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:34,501
wrap wrap,

1017
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:35,580
wrap your head around that.

1018
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,410
When the we dollars starts doing that,

1019
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:39,090
two things are gonna change.

1020
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,510
Everyone's going to have to look at it
that way and they're so terrified of

1021
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:42,751
that.

1022
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:43,500
That is a,

1023
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,840
that's something that really
could truly change the world.

1024
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,670
People who are trippers,

1025
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,000
who have money trippers who
have money and philanthropy,

1026
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,990
philanthropic ideas and the
ambition to follow through on them.

1027
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,600
And the pharmaceutical companies
are terrified of that shit.

1028
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,670
Politicians are terrified of that shit,

1029
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,350
whether they admit it or not,

1030
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,340
they're terrified of that shit on top of
the fact that you have to say you don't

1031
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:08,460
like drugs because everybody thinks about
the children and it's saying you like

1032
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:10,650
drugs is just too controversial
to many people are ignorant.

1033
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:11,484
They don't get it.

1034
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,470
So it's like saying you don't like tools.

1035
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:15,600
To me it's like I don't want tools.

1036
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,370
We're going to just leave
things the way they are.

1037
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,200
Yay.

1038
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,730
Do you think it's a certain age group
that's just going to die off though

1039
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:24,090
eventually and then it's going to be more
accepted and say like 10 to 20 years?

1040
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:24,924
You know why?

1041
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,040
Yes.

1042
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,611
And you know why?

1043
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:27,510
Because of this,

1044
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,700
because of things like this podcast,

1045
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,260
because of the Twitter,

1046
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,430
because of Facebook,

1047
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,413
because of,

1048
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,730
you know,

1049
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:38,730
Mark Marin's Blah or a podcast or a should
fears podcast to all the death squad

1050
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:39,350
pod,

1051
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,340
all that free talking people,

1052
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:45,930
people who are allowed because of this
sort of a format to express themselves in

1053
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:48,960
a way uncensored that millions
of people you can get.

1054
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,030
I mean you good or bad,

1055
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,390
you can make a youtube video like that
video of the lady sitting on the toilet

1056
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:55,380
there were watching the other day,

1057
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,461
terrible,

1058
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:58,800
but 38 million eyes have seen that man.

1059
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,360
38 million people have seen that.

1060
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:01,380
That's incredible.

1061
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,570
I mean that's amazing
that you can do that.

1062
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:03,721
Now.

1063
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:04,020
There was,

1064
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,680
there's never been a time in human history
where you could do anything that can

1065
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:12,120
almost immediately be recognizing and
seen by so many people through Twitter,

1066
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:12,781
through Facebook,

1067
00:29:12,781 --> 00:29:14,730
through blogs and podcasts.

1068
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,220
And this is the shit
that's changing the world,

1069
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:17,580
man.

1070
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,990
This is what's changing the world.

1071
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,790
Free Open communication.

1072
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:21,001
They,

1073
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:23,220
this is where the
government truly fucked up.

1074
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,690
It's not what drugs.

1075
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:28,290
Cause the problem with free
open communication is we go,

1076
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:29,160
why not drugs?

1077
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,460
If it was just drugs and we didn't
have free open communication and the,

1078
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,090
the reality is this is not much you can
do if you can't communicate with each

1079
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:36,301
other.

1080
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:37,620
It's hard to organize things.

1081
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,090
It's hard to get a movement going.

1082
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:39,690
It's hard.

1083
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,051
You know,

1084
00:29:40,051 --> 00:29:42,130
you have to have a person
who's a leader and that person

1085
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,880
gets arrested.

1086
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,760
You can never have the type of situation
right now the occupy Wall Street,

1087
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:47,890
this hive mind situation,

1088
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,240
this exists solely because of the
internet and it never existed before.

1089
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,590
This is where there's a total different
sort of revolution going on right now.

1090
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,370
And essentially what's happening is
we're setting the stage for the next

1091
00:30:00,371 --> 00:30:01,450
generation in a big,

1092
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:01,751
big,

1093
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:05,620
big way because the next generation is
not going to be these cops throwing flash

1094
00:30:05,621 --> 00:30:06,221
grenades anymore.

1095
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,970
It's going to be cops that have to
realize that to be a police officer,

1096
00:30:09,971 --> 00:30:10,391
you're just,

1097
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,070
another one of us were just,

1098
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,100
you're just one of us that we'd give a
weapon so that you protect people and

1099
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:18,310
when you stop doing nice things
and you start being a problem,

1100
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,600
you can't be a company more.

1101
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:20,170
It's not,

1102
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,430
there's no union thing.

1103
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:22,264
There's no,

1104
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,720
we got our rights and we go to fucking
labor thing and you go to sit down with a

1105
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:26,290
mediator.

1106
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:26,531
No,

1107
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:26,681
no,

1108
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:26,840
no,

1109
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,730
you can't do that.

1110
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,810
You can't be that.

1111
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,730
That's not what a police officer is.

1112
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,250
That's not a bank or can't steal from you.

1113
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:35,140
You can't charge 30% entrance.

1114
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:36,250
You fuck heads.

1115
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:39,940
You can't not have the money when the
shit hits the fan because you've invested

1116
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:42,310
it shittily you know there's these things.

1117
00:30:42,311 --> 00:30:45,910
Things cannot be variables and that is,

1118
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,610
the stage is being set right now.

1119
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,220
That's the stage is being
set in our generation.

1120
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:54,190
Our generation is setting the
stage for the next generation,

1121
00:30:54,191 --> 00:30:58,270
the generation that is going to grow up
and evolve from birth to death with the

1122
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:58,990
Internet.

1123
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,760
That's a different generation than us.

1124
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:01,691
You know,

1125
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:02,650
you and I are from the,

1126
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,790
we're we're dinosaurs,

1127
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:04,310
man.

1128
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,260
Where we were around when
answering machines where the,

1129
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,720
the shit you're going to be that there's
probably going to the next generation,

1130
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,270
the generation to come.

1131
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,120
It's probably going to get to the point
where it's something like there's going

1132
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:14,080
to be a cat as a president
or something like that.

1133
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:14,914
You know,

1134
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,820
like we nominated frisky over here and
he somehow one because why not frisky

1135
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:23,470
doesn't have any skeletons in his closet.

1136
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,280
Know first.

1137
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:24,710
He's never,

1138
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,000
you know,

1139
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,190
and he's just the face of a nation,

1140
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,491
you know,

1141
00:31:27,491 --> 00:31:28,640
he's not really doing any of that.

1142
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,100
Wouldn't work the fuck.

1143
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,600
Might as well have the face be cute.

1144
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,453
It could be Dora,

1145
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,990
Dora the explorer can be our president.

1146
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,950
You know,

1147
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:37,630
Dora the explorer or Sarah Pailin.

1148
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:38,860
Who would make the better choices?

1149
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,080
Dora at least would look
at the screen and go,

1150
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,790
what are you guys think?

1151
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,190
Yeah,

1152
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,530
we're going to send
drones in the Pakistan.

1153
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,360
We don't need to waste soldiers.

1154
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,410
We can shoot them from the air.

1155
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,390
That's how Dora the explorer
would be the president.

1156
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,140
Really?

1157
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,670
Sarah Palin's you to tell your pussy.

1158
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:56,980
I bet you she's had a bunch of kids.

1159
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:57,281
Man,

1160
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:59,290
that thing's probably a wreck Dora,

1161
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,850
but I bet she gives up the ass.

1162
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:02,411
Did you?

1163
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:03,220
I see that monks,

1164
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,900
I showed you the shots of Jack Daniels.

1165
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:05,740
A little cocaine in her.

1166
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,050
Which Lindsay Lohan Mugshot.

1167
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,710
Would you fuck?

1168
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,390
Yeah.

1169
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:12,280
Lindsay Lohan got arrested again
and her dad got arrested again.

1170
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,210
God Damn.

1171
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,260
If you had to pick one though,

1172
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,190
which one would it be?

1173
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:15,431
Oh,

1174
00:32:15,431 --> 00:32:16,000
fuck off him.

1175
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,510
I was drunk.

1176
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:16,691
I know.

1177
00:32:16,691 --> 00:32:17,230
No one.

1178
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,063
You have to choose one.

1179
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,740
I would probably go with the one,

1180
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,490
uh,

1181
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,690
second to the right.

1182
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,430
I would go with the far right.

1183
00:32:24,431 --> 00:32:25,300
The palest one.

1184
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:25,661
Oh,

1185
00:32:25,661 --> 00:32:26,710
the scary one.

1186
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,810
I think she looks hot and
ready to go in that picture.

1187
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,793
She looks,

1188
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,440
it's fascinating that that was
unsear that I tweeted about this.

1189
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:40,100
That was on CNN front fucking page news
about him getting arrested and I'm like,

1190
00:32:40,101 --> 00:32:40,640
really?

1191
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:40,821
If it's,

1192
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:41,660
is it on your front page,

1193
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:42,440
your website?

1194
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,020
Some guy who's a shitty dad got arrested.

1195
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,221
Michael Lohan,

1196
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:46,521
really?

1197
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:46,950
You Care,

1198
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,783
you care.

1199
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,830
You fucking really care.

1200
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,910
Why are you showing me this?

1201
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:53,930
You Dragon the dragon characters
into my plot that I don't need.

1202
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,180
You don't need them in my,

1203
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,053
my show.

1204
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:56,901
Yeah.

1205
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:59,690
And the only reason I like
about my life then I'm watching.

1206
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,360
Don't you think Lindsay Lohan would be
the perfect person to date to try to

1207
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:03,170
change?

1208
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:03,531
Really?

1209
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:03,790
No.

1210
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,510
It doesn't seem like I can change you.

1211
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:06,020
I can make,

1212
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,120
I can get you out of all of this.

1213
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:07,963
Can't change.

1214
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,620
You can't change your vigil.

1215
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:09,891
I mean,

1216
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:10,710
if you were on the same level,

1217
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,543
no.

1218
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,740
You'd have to be really,

1219
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,640
really rich man.

1220
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:17,100
How many people were as Rich's
Lindsey fucking Lohan Richie's doing.

1221
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:17,781
You're crazy.

1222
00:33:17,781 --> 00:33:18,080
Boy.

1223
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,591
Listen man,

1224
00:33:18,591 --> 00:33:20,180
they're offering her $1 million.

1225
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:22,830
Fleshlight is to make a mold
out of her box slash light off.

1226
00:33:22,831 --> 00:33:24,110
So now our boys.

1227
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,400
Yes,

1228
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,320
please.

1229
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,990
So we could have Lindsay Lohan on.

1230
00:33:27,991 --> 00:33:28,121
Yeah,

1231
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:28,840
we'll talk about it.

1232
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,080
She won't come on this podcast.

1233
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,370
She couldn't come here.

1234
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:33,320
We'd have to bring it to your
place to say I was a lesbian.

1235
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,380
This is Rebecca.

1236
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:34,851
Doesn't want that.

1237
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:35,750
Skank hang around here.

1238
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,833
But uh,

1239
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,160
I think she's still rich,

1240
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:40,401
man.

1241
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:41,234
I think she's,

1242
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,590
unless she's just been horribly mismanaged
court costs though that she's been

1243
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:46,490
going through so much.

1244
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:51,491
Coke came probably maybe her court
problems aren't like murder or shit.

1245
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,680
They're like really drains you financially
because you have to establish some

1246
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:55,514
sort of a case.

1247
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,900
It's for getting in trouble for shit.

1248
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,120
There's really not much court work.

1249
00:33:59,150 --> 00:33:59,540
I mean,

1250
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,330
not much legal work they can do
to try to squeeze her out of it.

1251
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,730
She's a fucking coke
ad and she gets drunk.

1252
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:05,541
She gets fucked up.

1253
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:05,751
She,

1254
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:06,020
she,

1255
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,220
she likes to party man.

1256
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,750
And we said this before,

1257
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,640
she's a 20 whatever the fuck she is.

1258
00:34:10,641 --> 00:34:12,440
25 2050 she's died.

1259
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:13,131
I think she should really,

1260
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:14,620
I think she's just find out how will it,

1261
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:15,340
is Lindsey alone?

1262
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,940
I would say she's 23 really 20 yeah.

1263
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:20,840
22 or 2125

1264
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,371
Michael Lohan,

1265
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:32,204
would you fuck,

1266
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,440
she's 25 she's 25 I'm right.

1267
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:40,550
So 25 and she looks like 25 in dog years.

1268
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,590
That's just age and hard.

1269
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,251
Whatever.

1270
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:43,820
I,

1271
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,653
she looks,

1272
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,530
she does look hot,

1273
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,670
but so does Jimmy Moore and she's
like 48 and I was shit lately.

1274
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,600
Let me show you a photo
being nice dark photos over.

1275
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,220
I don't want to see it.

1276
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,270
I don't want to see it all go away.

1277
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,253
What happened?

1278
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,010
How did she,

1279
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,500
how did she just lost
her grip on the magic?

1280
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,400
I don't know.

1281
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,980
She couldn't find the
little girl to sing too.

1282
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,040
I think it's like tangled
with the magic hair.

1283
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,321
I don't know.

1284
00:35:09,321 --> 00:35:10,550
I don't know what the rumor is.

1285
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,500
That was that there'd be more joke.

1286
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,480
What the rumor is?

1287
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:15,363
What?

1288
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,300
What'd you say?

1289
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:16,580
Never.

1290
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,370
Nothing.

1291
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,203
Alright.

1292
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,720
You've got a photo over
with she looks back.

1293
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,141
Hold on.

1294
00:35:21,141 --> 00:35:21,841
I'm looking at,

1295
00:35:21,841 --> 00:35:22,674
I'm trying to find it.

1296
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,060
Google to me more looking bad.

1297
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,490
Me More arms or arms.

1298
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,210
Yeah,

1299
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,590
I think we talked about it on a podcast.

1300
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:33,650
So already there's this horrible
photo that was at recently.

1301
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,543
Um,

1302
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,920
it's like when people were like
shitting on Megan Fox thumbs,

1303
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,110
they'll look luminar
thumbs up or thumbs like,

1304
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,070
bitch,

1305
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,240
what are you talking about?

1306
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:45,000
That's one of the hightest women that's
ever walked the face of the planet.

1307
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:45,621
And you're,

1308
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:46,860
you're looking at her thumbs.

1309
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,460
You could,

1310
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,390
she could chop those fucking thumbs off
machetes and replaced them with eagle

1311
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:54,660
cause it could be an
eagles talent on each hand.

1312
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:55,494
And I wouldn't mind,

1313
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,460
I feel a little weird.

1314
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:56,851
Here's what,

1315
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:59,100
grabbing my deck with an Eagle
Talon for a thumb though.

1316
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,113
I guess it's not odd.

1317
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,601
I found it,

1318
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:01,030
but it gets,

1319
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,441
it's not all.

1320
00:36:01,441 --> 00:36:03,060
It's actually that she has,

1321
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,880
she's anorexic looking like she like it.

1322
00:36:05,881 --> 00:36:09,510
You're starting to be able to
see like how creepy her arms are.

1323
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,000
Uh,

1324
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,760
there's another shot that her hand,

1325
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:12,923
I think it's

1326
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,930
this one dude.

1327
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:15,800
She's just fit.

1328
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,540
She's got muscle.

1329
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,663
That's the muscle.

1330
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,160
She's,

1331
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,120
she's very thin,

1332
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,410
but she's got muscle.

1333
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:21,981
She's probably,

1334
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:23,180
I don't like some fucking crazy,

1335
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,050
Ooh,

1336
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:24,890
that looks real skinny,

1337
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,800
but she's fucking 48 years old
or whatever the hell she is.

1338
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,713
Yeah,

1339
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,540
yeah.

1340
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,490
Well you do start their women's start
losing fat in their face and that's one of

1341
00:36:34,491 --> 00:36:35,570
the things that really bums them out.

1342
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:38,180
So they get fillers and it's
really kind of fucking creepy.

1343
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,070
Fillers are really dark,

1344
00:36:40,071 --> 00:36:40,550
man.

1345
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,410
It's really kind of a
weird thing when people do,

1346
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,970
they shove like,

1347
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:45,500
I don't know what it is,

1348
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:49,090
some stuff in your fucking mug and it,

1349
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,520
you know,

1350
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,070
like when you see women with like
really puffy cheeks and shit,

1351
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,950
but I think she still
looks hot as fuck man.

1352
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,420
I look at that picture right there and my,

1353
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,160
she's pretty hot dude.

1354
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,510
She just looks fit to me.

1355
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,190
She looks thin but fit.

1356
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,050
She's probably just on
a really healthy diet.

1357
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,181
Yeah.

1358
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:03,230
Yeah.

1359
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:03,440
You'd

1360
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,101
cut off their hair though.

1361
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:06,620
It's like Steve Jobs in that photo
where he's wearing a dress though,

1362
00:37:06,621 --> 00:37:08,660
kind of Steve jobs where he went,

1363
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:08,961
oh,

1364
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:09,950
she's not that thing.

1365
00:37:09,951 --> 00:37:10,820
You're crazy man.

1366
00:37:10,821 --> 00:37:11,654
She looks healthy,

1367
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,591
she looks healthy,

1368
00:37:12,591 --> 00:37:16,460
but she looks like a person is
probably fanatical about exercise.

1369
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,330
Yeah.

1370
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,040
Look man.

1371
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,670
Do you want to keep it
together at that age?

1372
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,710
I just worked out today
with Steve Maxwell.

1373
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:24,640
Steven Maxwell's is Kettlebell guy
that I'm friends with and he'll,

1374
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,920
he comes over like a few times a year and
puts me through these brutal workouts.

1375
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:28,590
Wow.

1376
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,000
And uh,

1377
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,271
yeah,

1378
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:30,170
he's an animal bro.

1379
00:37:30,171 --> 00:37:31,790
And he's 59 years old,

1380
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,860
50 fucking nine years old,

1381
00:37:33,861 --> 00:37:35,480
and he can do some shit that I can't do.

1382
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,760
He could do a bunch of
different exercises I can't do.

1383
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:42,230
He puts me through these wild fucking
yoga positions and it makes you do chin

1384
00:37:42,231 --> 00:37:43,040
ups where you,

1385
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,600
you will fully extend,

1386
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:48,740
pull your chin up all the way up and then
you hold it for five breaths and then

1387
00:37:48,741 --> 00:37:49,880
you go to your eyeballs,

1388
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:53,360
you hold it to him for five breaths and
then you go above your head and you hold

1389
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:56,900
it for five breaths and then you go
fully extended and then you pull yourself

1390
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:58,010
back up and start all over again.

1391
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,170
And it takes a long time.

1392
00:38:00,171 --> 00:38:02,450
It takes like 90 seconds
to do like three of them.

1393
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,520
And when you're doing this man,

1394
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:09,350
he does it like it's nothing
and he's fucking 59 years old.

1395
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,000
Fuck that.

1396
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,120
The dude's a stud.

1397
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:11,991
He,

1398
00:38:11,991 --> 00:38:12,500
he can,

1399
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,240
he can put it,

1400
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,150
it's amazing.

1401
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,590
Some people can fucking,

1402
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:16,701
they just keep it together.

1403
00:38:16,701 --> 00:38:18,590
But the only way you do it like that,

1404
00:38:18,591 --> 00:38:20,780
like he's a world renowned
fitness instructor.

1405
00:38:20,781 --> 00:38:21,640
He works out every day.

1406
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,341
He's teaching people,

1407
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,990
he's training every
fucking day of his life,

1408
00:38:23,991 --> 00:38:24,800
like literally.

1409
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,230
And he's training people how
to train everyday of his life.

1410
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,730
So he just maintains fitness,

1411
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,330
like to,

1412
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:32,630
to look like Demi Moore and
basically essentially 50 years old.

1413
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,090
Yet I guess they're saying that she lost
98 pounds up to 98 pounds of what she

1414
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:37,640
used to weigh.

1415
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,473
That's what they're saying.

1416
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,200
Oh,

1417
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,060
you making up a number?

1418
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:40,271
No,

1419
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:40,880
it's right here.

1420
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,560
This is reported to have
plummeted to around seven stone.

1421
00:38:44,561 --> 00:38:47,440
That's 98 pounds for all you
folks on this side of the pond.

1422
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,960
That doesn't mean she lost 98 pounds.

1423
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:50,920
That means she changed.

1424
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,541
As I said,

1425
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:53,374
plummeted.

1426
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,590
I just,

1427
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,770
this is a little baby going to help you.

1428
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:03,700
So good news.

1429
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:04,660
I have something to announce.

1430
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:04,840
A,

1431
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,970
you already know about it
already about dust squad.

1432
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,830
We are moving to the Pasadena Ice House.

1433
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,500
The studio.

1434
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:09,990
Yeah.

1435
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:14,350
So we're going to set up a professional
studio out there so that all the lie

1436
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,590
from the Ice House shows and
all the desk watches and uh,

1437
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:18,490
I talked to,

1438
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,340
we talked to was the fleshlight about
sponsoring the death squad show and the

1439
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:24,970
Ice House show.

1440
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:25,810
And if they don't,

1441
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,200
well somebody else will and just holler
at us on Twitter and we'll figure

1442
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:29,950
something out.

1443
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,610
Only legit companies don't get
crazy with your pipe dreams.

1444
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,340
Work it all out on your
own before you come to us.

1445
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,330
Cause Shit ain't cheap.

1446
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,280
But uh,

1447
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:38,920
if uh,

1448
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,120
we do set up that uh,

1449
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:40,600
set up,

1450
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:40,780
uh,

1451
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,171
the,

1452
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:41,860
um,

1453
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,310
the studio there at the podcast or the
podcast studio where they're at a ice

1454
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:45,461
house,

1455
00:39:45,461 --> 00:39:48,970
it'd be amazing because it's really like
right around the corner from the stage,

1456
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,900
from both stages and you
can just get offstage,

1457
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,720
run out,

1458
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,471
do a set,

1459
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:55,210
come back and do the podcast.

1460
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,410
And we did it one time and I thought
it was really fun and people liked it.

1461
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:00,244
It's a fun energy.

1462
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,390
Also there was a,

1463
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,121
I just,

1464
00:40:02,121 --> 00:40:05,620
I don't know if you saw that there was
like 20 minutes of extra footage that we

1465
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:06,041
recorded.

1466
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:09,790
Me and Brendan that later that night
that we were so wasted I didn't remember

1467
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,320
doing and I found it.

1468
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:11,801
I put it up.

1469
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:12,520
But you're in it too.

1470
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,220
And we talked to the guy that made
the Burke Chrysler tee shirts.

1471
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:15,540
Was that?

1472
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:15,931
Oh yeah,

1473
00:40:15,931 --> 00:40:16,171
yeah,

1474
00:40:16,171 --> 00:40:16,431
yeah,

1475
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:16,931
yeah,

1476
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:17,500
that's right.

1477
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:17,771
Yeah.

1478
00:40:17,771 --> 00:40:18,640
Towards the very end.

1479
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,370
And then some guy that said he was
going to verify me on Twitter anyways,

1480
00:40:21,371 --> 00:40:21,910
that's up on,

1481
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:22,780
I just put up the podcast.

1482
00:40:22,781 --> 00:40:22,901
Yeah.

1483
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:23,950
You need to verify them.

1484
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,150
Whoever you are are,

1485
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:25,660
boy,

1486
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,230
I don't think they do that anymore though.

1487
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:27,671
Really?

1488
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:27,811
Yeah.

1489
00:40:27,811 --> 00:40:29,590
I think they stopped that whole thing.

1490
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,700
Maybe you just want it to be your friend,

1491
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,050
so he pretended he could verify you.

1492
00:40:32,051 --> 00:40:33,160
It'd be a cool thing to say,

1493
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:33,311
Hey,

1494
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:34,270
I can verify your baby.

1495
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,230
Give me your number.

1496
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:35,770
Yeah,

1497
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,580
let me look it up,

1498
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,061
sweetie.

1499
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:37,650
What's up?

1500
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:38,660
Want to get verified.

1501
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,260
Hmm.

1502
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:39,780
That's a new,

1503
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,030
that's,

1504
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,863
I'm gonna try that.

1505
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,400
It's very important to be
verified on Twitter and you know,

1506
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,590
there's a lot of fake people.

1507
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,603
There's a lot of like,

1508
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,230
I don't think Chris
Rock's really on Twitter.

1509
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,293
It might be now.

1510
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,540
He wasn't for a long time though.

1511
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:49,871
Yeah,

1512
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:50,381
there's a lot of,

1513
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,370
I don't think Chappelle's on,

1514
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,450
no,

1515
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,050
I don't think so.

1516
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:53,883
I think that's fair.

1517
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:54,320
Yeah,

1518
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,153
I'm pretty sure.

1519
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,070
And I think the fake ones
got a lot of people on it.

1520
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,550
They think it's unfortunate,

1521
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,260
uh,

1522
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,300
tells on Twitter.

1523
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,640
But he only used it like nine times ever.

1524
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,220
But he started,

1525
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,990
he tweeted something about his new shows.

1526
00:41:07,991 --> 00:41:08,290
Good.

1527
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,420
What does a Dave's old porn on showtime.

1528
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,920
Do you know anything about that now?

1529
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,700
He an issue.

1530
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,570
I didn't even know you had a new show.

1531
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,041
Well,

1532
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:16,300
he's coming on next Tuesday,

1533
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,180
so he'll tell us what the fuck is up.

1534
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:19,991
And then,

1535
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:20,140
uh,

1536
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,700
Shane Smith from Vice TV.

1537
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:23,980
We're going to get him on
hopefully sometime next week.

1538
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,000
Right.

1539
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,200
But that guy,

1540
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:27,034
man,

1541
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,050
that's going to be the
nuttiest conversation ever.

1542
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,630
That guy has been everywhere.

1543
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,040
He seen some crazy and
he said he's got some

1544
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,900
nutty slave footage to show us.

1545
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,560
What?

1546
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:36,910
Yeah,

1547
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:37,450
yeah.

1548
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:37,860
I don't,

1549
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:38,110
I don't,

1550
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,350
I'll tell you exactly what he said.

1551
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,280
It sounds,

1552
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,660
it sounds pretty fucking nutty.

1553
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:42,980
Missed the slave.

1554
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:43,641
He's,

1555
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:44,474
um,

1556
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:45,471
you know,

1557
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:46,340
he's one of those dudes,

1558
00:41:46,341 --> 00:41:50,300
it's like he's out there and like the
darkest parts of the world like all the

1559
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:52,370
time filming it and bringing it back.

1560
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,140
Like they're like living on the
edge of the edge of the edge,

1561
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,093
you know,

1562
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:58,581
that's a,

1563
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:00,410
that's a crazy ass fucking show.

1564
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:02,930
And this guy is one of the craziest,

1565
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,250
he seems to embrace it.

1566
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:05,150
It's really interesting.

1567
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,260
You know why he's all,

1568
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,780
I mean when they were in Liberia
and they were running around,

1569
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:09,351
it was like,

1570
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:09,681
fuck,

1571
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:10,461
we almost got killed,

1572
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,294
but it could have been dead.

1573
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,010
They will like almost laughing about it.

1574
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,490
He said he's got some end slave
footage that will blow your mind.

1575
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:17,860
I'll bring you encase leads,

1576
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,100
but I'm not sure what that means.

1577
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,690
And Kay and Kay.

1578
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,700
Anybody,

1579
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,533
Bueller,

1580
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,320
Bueller,

1581
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,040
Kerrigan.

1582
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,873
I don't know what it means,

1583
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,590
but whatever slave footage,

1584
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:27,970
um,

1585
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:28,520
I want,

1586
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,320
I want to say that whatever,

1587
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:31,910
whatever fucking craziness he's got.

1588
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:32,691
He,

1589
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:32,880
they,

1590
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,850
they're in there.

1591
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,120
I told you about the Congo one,

1592
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:36,260
you gotta wash that Congo one.

1593
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:36,471
I don't know,

1594
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,880
I've only watched one episode of it,

1595
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:40,520
but just the one episode which leads
sort of just get things cooking.

1596
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:41,301
They're just,

1597
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:45,790
you look at the reality of that area and
you saw all my God like this is cool.

1598
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,530
This is Fuck Mad Max Mad Max.

1599
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,690
If they were living in
Mad Max and they saw this,

1600
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,231
they'd be like,

1601
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:51,560
dude,

1602
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,580
that's terrifying.

1603
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,320
Like Mad Max Times.

1604
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:57,350
It looks like like a break from the Congo.

1605
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,040
You'd be like,

1606
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,830
oh we have to do is fight for gasoline
and stay away from thunder dome and

1607
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:02,683
everything's cool.

1608
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:03,351
You know,

1609
00:43:03,351 --> 00:43:04,910
and you look at Liberia,

1610
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:09,140
you look at the Congo and you look in
all these places like these fucking dirt

1611
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:13,310
roads and like hot and people pile
into the street and just looks like,

1612
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:15,650
like you went back in time.

1613
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:16,760
It's like you like Yo,

1614
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:20,600
you went back in time to like
some dark age when people,

1615
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:25,580
people were still developing humanity
and developing culture and developing,

1616
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:26,271
you know,

1617
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:27,101
a community,

1618
00:43:27,101 --> 00:43:29,540
the sense of community and you
just shoved them all together.

1619
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:32,630
And gave them houses and
gave them clothes and cars.

1620
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:33,410
And it's just,

1621
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:34,161
it's almost like,

1622
00:43:34,161 --> 00:43:37,370
it's like you can't believe that
there's a part of the world that's that,

1623
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,300
that nuts.

1624
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,390
And when they were given
the figures about the Congo,

1625
00:43:40,391 --> 00:43:41,870
but how many people have
been murdered there?

1626
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,590
You just go,

1627
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,570
what box?

1628
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:46,100
It's like millions of people.

1629
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,240
Millions.

1630
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,200
And just think of the idea of
a million being a thousand,

1631
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,000
a thousand times.

1632
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:55,250
I think about there's multiple,

1633
00:43:55,251 --> 00:43:58,010
multiple millions and millions
of people have died in the Congo.

1634
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,000
And think about the,

1635
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,780
just the,

1636
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,060
the,

1637
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:00,350
the,

1638
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,680
the enormity of the mass of
all those bodies together.

1639
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,600
And you realize how crazy it is.

1640
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:09,320
These fucks went there and they went
there to film the fucking video.

1641
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,030
Oh my God.

1642
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:11,960
It's nuts,

1643
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:12,530
dude.

1644
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:16,130
Everyone's got guns and machine
guns and AK 47 and there,

1645
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,750
there's minors and they're fucking
putting people through slave labor to get

1646
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:21,710
them to pull out,

1647
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,221
you know,

1648
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:24,920
rocks and minerals that we're
gonna use to make cell phones.

1649
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:25,770
It's,

1650
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:28,880
the world is crazy as fuck right now.

1651
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:30,421
And it,

1652
00:44:30,421 --> 00:44:31,830
a lot of it is just we know,

1653
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,233
you know,

1654
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,750
a lot of it is just we know we're
constantly inundated by information.

1655
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:37,561
When I was a kid,

1656
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:40,860
if you wanted to find out about EDI mean
you gotta you got to do some searching.

1657
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:41,431
You know,

1658
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:43,380
you got to go to a library,

1659
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:44,580
you had to buy a book,

1660
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,170
you had to talk to a teacher.

1661
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:47,620
You know Mr. Johnson Q.

1662
00:44:47,621 --> 00:44:49,530
Explain to me how EDI mean rose to power.

1663
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,120
I was a long story could and he,

1664
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:51,601
you know,

1665
00:44:51,601 --> 00:44:51,691
you,

1666
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:51,950
you,

1667
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:55,770
you couldn't just get the
information but like Kadafi man,

1668
00:44:55,771 --> 00:44:58,380
we watched that guy's
last moments of life.

1669
00:44:59,010 --> 00:44:59,251
You know,

1670
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:03,900
think about the difference in the leap
of information between now and 2030 years

1671
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:04,141
ago.

1672
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:05,880
We watched Kadafi died.

1673
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:10,910
I watched a guy shove a stick up Qaddafi's
ass while he was covered in blood.

1674
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,680
I saw him with no blood on him.

1675
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:16,440
I heard gunshots and I see him
bleeding in the fucking head.

1676
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,150
Yeah.

1677
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,030
They pissed a whip.

1678
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:19,200
That dude that kicked him.

1679
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:20,370
You see him kicking him.

1680
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,570
We watched that.

1681
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:21,961
Yeah.

1682
00:45:21,961 --> 00:45:22,890
It's weird that the,

1683
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,990
it's weird that that
happened because they aren't,

1684
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:25,890
they fighting for,

1685
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:26,340
you know,

1686
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,570
like religious reasons,

1687
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:27,871
you know,

1688
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:28,704
like God,

1689
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,320
you know God and stuff
like that and they're,

1690
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,380
they're doing something that,

1691
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:31,771
you know,

1692
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:32,604
their guide,

1693
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,140
it's like against what they believe in.

1694
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,630
What you're trying to say is
that when they were doing it,

1695
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:37,050
they say,

1696
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:37,471
oh,

1697
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:38,190
ah,

1698
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,690
I know what they're singing.

1699
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,340
They're saying God is great.

1700
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:41,891
God is great.

1701
00:45:41,891 --> 00:45:42,541
You're cheering.

1702
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:44,130
God is very religious people,

1703
00:45:44,131 --> 00:45:47,760
but yet they're murdering
and torturing and it seems,

1704
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:48,690
yeah,

1705
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:49,380
so stupid.

1706
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:49,531
Well,

1707
00:45:49,531 --> 00:45:50,131
not only that,

1708
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:54,540
they were parading him around on a truck
and they were holding him down with

1709
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:58,470
shoes because shoes to them
or like really disrespectful.

1710
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:58,710
Oh,

1711
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:59,130
right.

1712
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,480
Throwing a shoe at the president.

1713
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:00,691
Yeah,

1714
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:01,524
I remember that.

1715
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,300
That was the one time where it illuminated
to me how much of it is just a job

1716
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:07,170
for George Bush.

1717
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,850
He's just a guy with a job.

1718
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,820
When that guy started throwing the shoes
at him and he had a little smile on his

1719
00:46:11,821 --> 00:46:12,121
face,

1720
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:12,690
he's like,

1721
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:13,590
Gee Whiz,

1722
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,840
finally I get a little fun on the job.

1723
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,280
Right.

1724
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,000
But he had a little fun on the job today.

1725
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,020
Normally my job is bullshit and to
people while Dick Cheney fucks the world,

1726
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,400
but today I got the ducks

1727
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:23,941
shoes,

1728
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:24,690
honey.

1729
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:25,321
It was fun.

1730
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:25,591
I was like,

1731
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:26,550
come on you little fella.

1732
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:27,780
You ain't got no fucking arm.

1733
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,920
Throw it.

1734
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,330
Throw no shoes.

1735
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,000
It's like he seemed human to me for like
a brief moment because to me Bush was

1736
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,020
always this moron.

1737
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:37,590
It like stood on a battleship with,

1738
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,001
you know,

1739
00:46:38,001 --> 00:46:40,820
mission accomplished in the background
when fucking nothing had been

1740
00:46:40,821 --> 00:46:41,381
accomplished.

1741
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,740
Like you're talking crazy.

1742
00:46:42,741 --> 00:46:45,050
What are you going to call it
first and then we win the war.

1743
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:46,340
The fuck are you talking about?

1744
00:46:46,341 --> 00:46:47,300
How's it mission accomplished?

1745
00:46:47,301 --> 00:46:50,150
Was 100,000 fucking troops
over there and you know,

1746
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,180
50,000 deadly war
machine circling the sky,

1747
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,410
dropping bombs on people.

1748
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:55,610
What the fuck are you talking about?

1749
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:56,660
What was your mission?

1750
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,710
Mission accomplished.

1751
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,450
We stolen lied.

1752
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,051
You know,

1753
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:01,610
if that's what their
mission accomplish was,

1754
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:02,480
we got over there,

1755
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:04,100
we got Halliburton contracts,

1756
00:47:04,101 --> 00:47:04,760
we did it,

1757
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,271
we did it,

1758
00:47:05,271 --> 00:47:05,691
we did it.

1759
00:47:05,691 --> 00:47:05,820
We,

1760
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,180
we sold the weapons of
mass destruction lie,

1761
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:08,841
Yay,

1762
00:47:08,841 --> 00:47:09,710
mission accomplished.

1763
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:10,820
Then it's mission accomplished.

1764
00:47:10,821 --> 00:47:12,050
So I always looked at him as being,

1765
00:47:12,051 --> 00:47:15,610
this is fucking new
world order mouthpiece,

1766
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:15,831
this,

1767
00:47:15,831 --> 00:47:16,041
you know,

1768
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,040
this evil person who is perpetrating
these things on the American people.

1769
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:21,920
And then I looked at him when that guy
was throwing a shoe at him and I was

1770
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:22,101
like,

1771
00:47:22,101 --> 00:47:23,030
he's just a guy,

1772
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:23,931
is the normal guy.

1773
00:47:23,931 --> 00:47:25,280
Just a guy who got duped.

1774
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,610
And the reason why he comes off dom
is because part of the reason why he's

1775
00:47:28,611 --> 00:47:31,150
weighed now than when he was the governor.

1776
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:32,290
If you go back and listen to,

1777
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:33,790
like George Bush had speeches,

1778
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
George Bush jr w when he was a young
man and he was campaigning for governor,

1779
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,480
he was quite eloquent.

1780
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,141
I mean,

1781
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:44,650
it's really a shocking
difference between that level of,

1782
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:45,010
of,

1783
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:49,240
of the ability to communicate that he
had back then and how he came across as,

1784
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:49,870
you know,

1785
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:52,570
maybe not the most
educated guy in the world,

1786
00:47:52,571 --> 00:47:52,871
you know,

1787
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:57,550
but at least he was focused and prepared
and he spoke very clearly and he seemed

1788
00:47:57,551 --> 00:47:58,384
very confident.

1789
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:00,970
Whereas you see him
like as a an older man,

1790
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:04,390
it's like he just barely fucking phoning
it in and that's what it was like.

1791
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,700
He was like Jack on
lost in the last season.

1792
00:48:06,701 --> 00:48:07,810
Who's phoning it in?

1793
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:13,170
He was just tired of the whole charade
and he was forced into that position and

1794
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:14,910
so that's why he said
stuff with the knife,

1795
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,210
no passion behind it.

1796
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:17,800
Like the evil doers,

1797
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,160
he would say like stupid shit because
he would get off script and he really

1798
00:48:21,161 --> 00:48:22,450
didn't have any passion for it,

1799
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:23,330
so he didn't have,

1800
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,300
it's not even that he was dumb.

1801
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:26,950
He said he never thought about it.

1802
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:27,310
He's like,

1803
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:31,570
he had to shut himself off of the reality
of what being the fucking president

1804
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:32,890
was because everybody,

1805
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:33,701
when they're a little boy,

1806
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:36,640
thinks that the reality of being the
president is all you get to be the fucking

1807
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:40,000
guy who fixes everything and be the next
Teddy Roosevelt would be the guy who

1808
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:41,140
turns America around.

1809
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:42,011
Meanwhile,

1810
00:48:42,011 --> 00:48:46,960
all you are is just strapping
a condom on this giant machine,

1811
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,320
this giant war machine as
it fucks America in the ass,

1812
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:51,340
and that's what you're doing.

1813
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:53,680
You're there to provide the condoms so
American doesn't know what the fuck is

1814
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:54,514
happening.

1815
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:54,881
You know,

1816
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:55,051
you're,

1817
00:48:55,051 --> 00:48:56,000
you're there to the,

1818
00:48:56,001 --> 00:48:57,220
to put the put on the show.

1819
00:48:57,221 --> 00:48:59,410
You're there to tell everybody
that everything is okay.

1820
00:48:59,411 --> 00:49:01,990
We have to insert this dick
in your ass to fight terror.

1821
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:02,531
Oh,

1822
00:49:02,531 --> 00:49:03,280
okay.

1823
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:03,581
You know,

1824
00:49:03,581 --> 00:49:04,300
it's like,

1825
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,021
that's what he was,

1826
00:49:05,021 --> 00:49:06,010
he was the mouthpiece,

1827
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:10,210
the mouthpiece for the monster and
that guy throwing the shoe at it just

1828
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:11,080
illuminated it.

1829
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,570
I saw him with a glimmer in his eye,

1830
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:18,340
like a young guy again and meanwhile
he's just a fucking 60 year old man,

1831
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:22,270
60 year old man who just got sucked
into the wrong fucking crowd.

1832
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:24,250
Never really was ambitious,

1833
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:25,720
never really cared that much.

1834
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:26,770
If you look at his past,

1835
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:28,000
he was like a lazy guy.

1836
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,900
So when all of a sudden
he's in a position,

1837
00:49:29,901 --> 00:49:30,061
boy,

1838
00:49:30,061 --> 00:49:32,080
he's going to be set for life financially.

1839
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:33,640
He's fucking president now.

1840
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,440
He's even in his second term,

1841
00:49:35,441 --> 00:49:37,300
like he just had no ambition.

1842
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:42,420
You're talking about a guy who choked
himself unconscious on a pretzel and fell

1843
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:43,780
and knocked himself out.

1844
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:44,600
You remember that Shit.

1845
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,130
You had like a black eye or that was a
story that totally seems like the most

1846
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:49,480
ridiculous story ever.

1847
00:49:49,481 --> 00:49:51,190
Maybe his dad beat the fuck out of them.

1848
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:54,070
Could you imagine if he was like doing
something wrong or he said something

1849
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:57,070
wrong and his dad put on leather
gloves and like beat him and fries.

1850
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,290
They'll put on like SAP gloves.

1851
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:02,410
Just beat his ass in front of
everybody to show him like,

1852
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:06,460
this is not how the new world order's
run and just fucking beat his ass,

1853
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:07,690
you know,

1854
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:08,420
just to let them know,

1855
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:08,940
motherfucker,

1856
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,571
we're crazy.

1857
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:09,790
All right,

1858
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,730
we're really the throat planes into
buildings or I will punch you right in the

1859
00:50:12,731 --> 00:50:13,570
fucking face.

1860
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,400
I wouldn't put it past on him.

1861
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,010
His Dad was the head of the fucking CIA.

1862
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:18,611
His Dad,

1863
00:50:18,611 --> 00:50:19,840
they always thought he was like a Wimp,

1864
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,300
you know,

1865
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,350
like there was like the big thing on,

1866
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:22,690
on the older Bush,

1867
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:23,141
you know,

1868
00:50:23,141 --> 00:50:23,500
I was like,

1869
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,000
oh well the wimp president.

1870
00:50:25,001 --> 00:50:25,391
And like,

1871
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:25,730
you know,

1872
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,110
they look,

1873
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:26,680
it was on a,

1874
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,950
like Newsweek.

1875
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,540
I was reading very recently.

1876
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:30,230
Um,

1877
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:35,090
he was on the cover of Newsweek and it
was talking about him being a wimp and it

1878
00:50:35,091 --> 00:50:37,820
was like a very controversial
thing because here's a guy who's,

1879
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:38,430
you know,

1880
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:41,510
I'm going to run the fucking biggest
nuclear power in the free world.

1881
00:50:41,511 --> 00:50:41,961
And they're saying,

1882
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:42,830
is he a wimp?

1883
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:43,461
Like,

1884
00:50:43,461 --> 00:50:44,294
wow,

1885
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,410
like that's a label,

1886
00:50:45,411 --> 00:50:45,681
man.

1887
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:47,540
You stick that and a magazine,

1888
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:49,100
a fucking magazine sticks that.

1889
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,240
But meanwhile,

1890
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,640
this guy was the head of the fucking CIA.

1891
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,860
You know what kind of Evil Shit you have
to do to be the head of the CIA to get

1892
00:50:57,861 --> 00:50:59,480
to the top of that monster.

1893
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,490
The CIA's a shadow government.

1894
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,480
We have a shadow government that
is allowed to murder people.

1895
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:08,660
They're allowed to go out of
the country and murder people.

1896
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:09,171
You know,

1897
00:51:09,171 --> 00:51:11,780
whether or not you call these people
terrorists or whether or not you can

1898
00:51:11,781 --> 00:51:13,820
connect them to illegal activity.

1899
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,980
The bottom line is the CIA,

1900
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:17,490
including American civilians.

1901
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:20,830
The CIA goes over there and
kill these motherfuckers and,

1902
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,790
and they don't do shit about it.

1903
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,440
Nobody does a fucking thing about it.

1904
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,030
The government doesn't prosecute him.

1905
00:51:26,031 --> 00:51:26,870
They don't go after him.

1906
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:27,650
For these,

1907
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,660
these drone attacks that they do.

1908
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,130
They do some crazy shit,

1909
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:31,610
man.

1910
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,080
And this guy was the head of that.

1911
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:38,060
He was the head so maybe he didn't have
to fucking lay the gloves to George

1912
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:38,630
Little Georgie.

1913
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:41,330
Skim a fucking stiff jab in the face.

1914
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:43,430
Bitch will fucking kill you.

1915
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,570
This is how it works.

1916
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:44,931
No,

1917
00:51:44,931 --> 00:51:46,970
you can't go back to own a baseball team,

1918
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:47,940
right?

1919
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,181
Yeah.

1920
00:51:48,181 --> 00:51:50,490
And he throws a pretzel down on
him and hits him in the face of,

1921
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:51,180
yes,

1922
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,440
you have to say that you choked on
his bitch or something like that.

1923
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,740
Like you have to make it seem
like they'd most like bitchy

1924
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,610
being they get a black car.

1925
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,610
Maybe he was trying to get
some head from a tranny.

1926
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,240
I found out that it was a training and
then the trainee beat his ass and he

1927
00:52:04,241 --> 00:52:05,950
couldn't say anything
cause he was a president.

1928
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:06,761
Training Lips,

1929
00:52:06,761 --> 00:52:07,594
carbs.

1930
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,553
It could be.

1931
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,250
Did you hear about the blacklist
bill that that they're,

1932
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:15,280
they're trying to pass a black list called
the blacklist bill and it pretty much

1933
00:52:15,281 --> 00:52:16,510
will make like Twitter,

1934
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,291
youtube,

1935
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:17,861
Facebook,

1936
00:52:17,861 --> 00:52:22,861
like those companies be 100% responsible
for the content so it could kill pretty

1937
00:52:23,051 --> 00:52:23,884
much killed Twitter,

1938
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:24,783
anything like that.

1939
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,390
Fucking con it would make it a felony to,

1940
00:52:28,391 --> 00:52:30,040
to stream unlicensed content,

1941
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:31,900
video game play throughs,

1942
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:34,090
like a karaoke songs,

1943
00:52:34,091 --> 00:52:35,260
music videos,

1944
00:52:35,261 --> 00:52:36,250
like all that shit.

1945
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:37,600
And I go make it a felony.

1946
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,110
So Jesus Christ.

1947
00:52:40,111 --> 00:52:40,944
Yeah.

1948
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,890
What the fuck.

1949
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:44,290
So it's pretty much
going to start censoring.

1950
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:45,480
The Internet's going to start it.

1951
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:49,180
Who is allowing people to
continue to come up with?

1952
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,880
Can we have a moratorium on new laws?

1953
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,360
Just like obviously shit is
spiraling out of control.

1954
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:59,470
There's a million new laws introduced
every year that upset people that we don't

1955
00:52:59,471 --> 00:53:02,020
have a chance to truly
reconcile and understand and,

1956
00:53:02,021 --> 00:53:02,181
and,

1957
00:53:02,181 --> 00:53:02,600
and,

1958
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:02,920
and,

1959
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:03,171
and,

1960
00:53:03,171 --> 00:53:05,200
and just talk about,

1961
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:05,531
you know,

1962
00:53:05,531 --> 00:53:06,520
just a dress.

1963
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,840
There's too many of them.

1964
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,220
There's new ones every day,

1965
00:53:09,221 --> 00:53:10,360
whether it's medical marijuana,

1966
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:13,660
they're trying to do this to try and do
that with vitamins and fucking make them

1967
00:53:13,661 --> 00:53:15,340
prescription only to try to do this,

1968
00:53:15,341 --> 00:53:16,031
to try and do that.

1969
00:53:16,031 --> 00:53:16,300
It's,

1970
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,060
it's a constant stream of bullshit.

1971
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,500
You fucking criminals and I hope,

1972
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,880
I hope that it doesn't
through Bhs stop free speech.

1973
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,730
They're trying to stop people
from doing what they're doing now,

1974
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,020
which is organizing.

1975
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,090
When do you think they are
going to start making a sensor?

1976
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:33,840
Podcasts.

1977
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,673
They can't.

1978
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:37,200
I think they're not because
there's too many of them.

1979
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:38,070
There's too many of them.

1980
00:53:38,071 --> 00:53:38,701
There's too much.

1981
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:39,690
It's too much going on.

1982
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,300
What does the sensor censorship for?

1983
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,690
If it's free and you actually
have to download it and it's,

1984
00:53:45,691 --> 00:53:46,200
you know,

1985
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,520
it's labeled mature,

1986
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:49,170
it seems to be fucking pretty simple.

1987
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,710
Unless you're going to start
censoring movies and censoring songs,

1988
00:53:52,711 --> 00:53:54,480
which you know they've tried,

1989
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,420
they've tried in the past
and it essentially they do
censor movies because if

1990
00:53:57,421 --> 00:53:58,530
you go above are,

1991
00:53:58,531 --> 00:54:00,330
you can't have any
sexual content and movie,

1992
00:54:00,331 --> 00:54:01,680
like real interaction.

1993
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,240
Do you remember Brown bunny?

1994
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,440
Do you remember that movie?

1995
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:05,010
No.

1996
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:07,140
It was a Vincent Gallo
movie and it was what?

1997
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:07,770
That,

1998
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,600
I forget that chicks chicks name.

1999
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:15,160
So there's a van g Chloe
Shalane going game anyway.

2000
00:54:15,161 --> 00:54:17,160
She sucks his cock for real man.

2001
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:17,610
Really?

2002
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:17,911
Yeah.

2003
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:19,170
That's part of the plot.

2004
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,550
Part of the plot was like,

2005
00:54:20,551 --> 00:54:22,200
it's just like this really hot scene.

2006
00:54:22,201 --> 00:54:22,621
And they said,

2007
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:22,741
well,

2008
00:54:22,741 --> 00:54:24,000
we're just going to really do it,

2009
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,350
so really act it out.

2010
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:26,460
So.

2011
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,870
So she no,

2012
00:54:27,871 --> 00:54:28,081
no.

2013
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:28,561
Chloe,

2014
00:54:28,561 --> 00:54:28,830
Chloe,

2015
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:29,580
Chloe.

2016
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:29,910
Yeah.

2017
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:30,930
You watched the scene,

2018
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,441
you'll just,

2019
00:54:31,441 --> 00:54:33,690
just Google seen from Brown bunny.

2020
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:34,680
Wow.

2021
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,030
And you know Vincent Gallo is standing
up and he pulls out his dick and Chloe's

2022
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:39,241
stuff.

2023
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:40,470
I can go there and eat.

2024
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,550
How did you say her name is?

2025
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:42,171
She,

2026
00:54:42,171 --> 00:54:45,780
she sucked his cock and the nuts
in her face and it's 100% legit.

2027
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:46,770
Wow.

2028
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:47,191
First of all,

2029
00:54:47,191 --> 00:54:48,390
his cock is not that impressive.

2030
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,560
Are they dating at the time?

2031
00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:50,394
I think they were.

2032
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,293
I think they were.

2033
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,273
That makes sense.

2034
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:55,770
Or that might've been just what they
put on the press release to make it seem

2035
00:54:55,771 --> 00:54:56,604
not so bad.

2036
00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:56,731
Well,

2037
00:54:56,731 --> 00:54:57,564
they are dating,

2038
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,160
you know?

2039
00:54:59,160 --> 00:54:59,730
Wow.

2040
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:00,563
Yeah.

2041
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:00,991
So,

2042
00:55:00,991 --> 00:55:01,321
I mean,

2043
00:55:01,321 --> 00:55:01,860
but,

2044
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,140
and everybody got mad at
them for that by the way.

2045
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:07,740
And he sort of blacklisted
because of that.

2046
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:08,580
Wow.

2047
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:08,731
Yeah.

2048
00:55:08,731 --> 00:55:10,710
He doesn't really work that much
and he's really a good actor,

2049
00:55:10,711 --> 00:55:11,261
but he's really,

2050
00:55:11,261 --> 00:55:12,570
he seems to be really crazy.

2051
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,420
He's like a real dark
weirdo sort of a character.

2052
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:16,061
And I remember he was,

2053
00:55:16,061 --> 00:55:19,620
he's been in like vodka ads and shit and
he's always the guy with like long sort

2054
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:22,720
of greasy hair and there's a bunch
of dirty heroin looking girls around.

2055
00:55:22,721 --> 00:55:23,820
I'm looking at suck dicks.

2056
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:24,870
Ever seen those pictures?

2057
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:25,830
Yeah.

2058
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,000
Well that's him and he's just,

2059
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:28,020
he's fucking,

2060
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,130
he's a weird guy.

2061
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,710
I mean to do that and think it's
okay to do that and I move it.

2062
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,570
I'm just going to pull
macaca you suck it for real.

2063
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:34,404
Okay.

2064
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:34,591
Yeah.

2065
00:55:34,591 --> 00:55:35,960
We're going to leave this in yo watts.

2066
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,590
You gotta leave in the cock sucking part.

2067
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,750
How can we can't just imply it,

2068
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:40,080
man.

2069
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,280
I mean,

2070
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,040
sexy enough,

2071
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,191
you know,

2072
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:42,590
just seeing her head and seeing though,

2073
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,100
you don't have to actually show your Dick.

2074
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:44,911
And I'm how long showed all,

2075
00:55:44,911 --> 00:55:45,240
man,

2076
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,073
that's what's really going on.

2077
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,173
I want to show what's happening.

2078
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:48,930
I want to show how to be realist,

2079
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,070
the realist of the real.

2080
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,140
But at one point in time,

2081
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:54,330
you know that was where people
thought it was going to go.

2082
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,370
When deep throat came out,

2083
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:01,640
people got in line like and went to that
on Bates deep throat came out and it

2084
00:56:01,861 --> 00:56:06,861
was like a real movie that
was a pornographic movie
and that had really not been

2085
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,770
fucking popular before that,

2086
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:11,401
you know,

2087
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:11,851
they're really,

2088
00:56:11,851 --> 00:56:15,510
I mean there was behind the green
curtain or door with Marilyn Chambers.

2089
00:56:15,511 --> 00:56:20,511
That was one that was like along similar
lines and there's like a picture from

2090
00:56:20,581 --> 00:56:25,581
that I saw online of Johnny Carson
waiting in line for deep throat.

2091
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:27,670
Apparently they were interviewing
him and he'll just like,

2092
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:32,410
it was like acceptable to go
and see this and go see this.

2093
00:56:32,411 --> 00:56:35,590
This movie where people actually
fucked because it was a movie they had.

2094
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:37,720
They didn't have porno movies like that.

2095
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,280
So because it was a movie,

2096
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:42,250
they trick people and all of a sudden
people were in this movie watching some

2097
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:42,511
checks,

2098
00:56:42,511 --> 00:56:43,390
sucks some decks.

2099
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,460
You know,

2100
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:46,000
it's kind of crazy when
you think about it.

2101
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:47,290
That wasn't that long ago.

2102
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:50,710
And you've got to wonder what if things,

2103
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:51,071
uh,

2104
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:51,491
you know,

2105
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,060
weren't,

2106
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:53,830
maybe they loosened up quicker.

2107
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:54,071
You know,

2108
00:56:54,071 --> 00:56:54,221
what,

2109
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:54,680
what if,

2110
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,590
if that was introduced today,

2111
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:01,800
what if we never had porn before and
we have this sort of crazy environment

2112
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:03,220
where we have right now.

2113
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:05,150
And then all of a sudden someone started,

2114
00:57:05,151 --> 00:57:06,910
it would be porn used
to be just like scenes,

2115
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:10,770
but then someone put together a real
good movie where people actually fucking

2116
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:11,140
it.

2117
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,150
And it was like the first
one ever done like man,

2118
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:17,170
and maybe it was an idea before its
time because you gotta think of Johnny

2119
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:18,910
fucking Carson who's like,

2120
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,271
you know,

2121
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:21,130
the weird head of the tonight show,

2122
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:21,581
you know,

2123
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:25,270
hit me as America Pie as you can get,

2124
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,980
as across the board,

2125
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:28,480
normal as you can get.

2126
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:31,150
And he's waiting in
line to see deep throat.

2127
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,180
Well you would have to
hide that pee wee Herman.

2128
00:57:34,181 --> 00:57:35,330
Just a few decades later,

2129
00:57:35,331 --> 00:57:37,240
it goes to jail for
beating off in a theater.

2130
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:37,860
You know,

2131
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,120
it's,

2132
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,380
and it's sought thought of
as being really ultra CD,

2133
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:41,861
like,

2134
00:57:41,861 --> 00:57:42,491
oh my God,

2135
00:57:42,491 --> 00:57:45,070
he went to a theater when they
were playing pornographic movies.

2136
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:47,200
This is just a few decades later,

2137
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:48,010
man.

2138
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:48,843
It's interesting.

2139
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:49,540
It could,

2140
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,800
I wonder what could have happened.

2141
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:53,680
I wonder if it's one of those things
where we just as zigged when we could have

2142
00:57:53,681 --> 00:57:54,514
zagged,

2143
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:55,240
you know,

2144
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,370
and maybe when that happened,

2145
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:58,443
you know,

2146
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,310
they could've started doing,

2147
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:00,580
like,

2148
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:02,230
there could have been like a normal genre.

2149
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,580
Like you'd go to see,

2150
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:04,270
you know,

2151
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:07,630
a fucking Jennifer Aniston
movie and it was an ex,

2152
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,490
Jennifer Aniston would get fucked.

2153
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:11,980
Gerard Butler would just
fucking dig in that.

2154
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,250
There'll be craziest shit
if you watch a real movie.

2155
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,520
Like that's stupid fucking movie
they had where one of them was,

2156
00:58:18,521 --> 00:58:18,790
uh,

2157
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,470
a convict or something.

2158
00:58:20,471 --> 00:58:21,640
They're handcuffed together.

2159
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,670
How much better would that movie be of
Jennifer Aniston was talking as deck,

2160
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:25,270
of course,

2161
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:26,530
be a way better moving.

2162
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:28,000
It'd be a way better movie.

2163
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:28,900
It would be fun.

2164
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:29,501
You know,

2165
00:58:29,501 --> 00:58:29,891
it'd be like,

2166
00:58:29,891 --> 00:58:30,191
damn,

2167
00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:31,270
that girl's got a great mouth.

2168
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,200
It'd be fun.

2169
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:36,130
You know that big Chin really aids when
she's blowing you because it gives you

2170
00:58:36,131 --> 00:58:38,710
like extra coverage of
your balls on her chin.

2171
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,420
It's like more chin to go around.

2172
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:42,160
That's how you would look at it.

2173
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,143
It'd be fun,

2174
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,400
but instead it didn't go that way.

2175
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:48,190
You can imagine if the porno stars
are the ones that made the big cash,

2176
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:49,870
that was like the real,

2177
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,670
those are real money and if you didn't,

2178
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:52,250
if you were,

2179
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,700
if you're a hot chick and
you're too scared to do porn,

2180
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:57,371
yeah,

2181
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:58,171
well you know,

2182
00:58:58,171 --> 00:58:59,620
and you'd be on a Sitcom I guess,

2183
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,120
which you couldn't do any movies.

2184
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,090
The real big money movies that
people want to watch people fuck.

2185
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:08,200
That could been really
easily been possible.

2186
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:10,930
If you look at how God damn
popular pornography is,

2187
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:15,931
it's really just a matter of a public
attitude about it because pornography is

2188
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:18,400
gigantic on the Internet.

2189
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:23,640
I mean they think something like 30 to
40 of all packages that are flying around

2190
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,270
being downloaded on the internet,

2191
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,160
have some sort of pornography on them.

2192
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:29,630
That's amazing.

2193
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:30,141
I mean,

2194
00:59:30,141 --> 00:59:30,501
that's a,

2195
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:32,120
just a staggering number.

2196
00:59:32,121 --> 00:59:35,280
When you think about the billions
of human beings on the Internet,

2197
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:35,400
I mean,

2198
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,250
how many billions or on
the internet worldwide,

2199
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,990
is it like four or something like that?

2200
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,660
There's like almost 7 billion people.

2201
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:44,720
Let's be conservative and say
it's 3 billion on the Internet.

2202
00:59:44,721 --> 00:59:46,550
You think that's conservative
or think that's like,

2203
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,010
let's go crazy and say 2 billion.

2204
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,110
Let's say it's only 2
billion people online.

2205
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:53,330
That's a lot of fucking people.

2206
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:58,510
2 billion people and 30 to 40% of it is
just dicks in pussies and sucking cock

2207
00:59:58,821 --> 00:59:59,690
and that's all it is.

2208
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,160
It's amazing.

2209
01:00:01,161 --> 01:00:03,830
Then when you stop and
think about the demand,

2210
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,180
the sheer demand,

2211
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,430
and yet when you look around,

2212
01:00:07,431 --> 01:00:09,950
you wouldn't know when
you go to the movies,

2213
01:00:09,951 --> 01:00:11,090
it's not represented.

2214
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:12,231
It's is not.

2215
01:00:12,231 --> 01:00:13,400
You go to the magazine store,

2216
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,420
it's not represented.

2217
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:14,961
Sure.

2218
01:00:14,961 --> 01:00:19,190
There's some like weird shit up at the
top that sealed off and plastic and

2219
01:00:19,191 --> 01:00:20,660
they're so fucking big,

2220
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,440
you know,

2221
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,390
subscription thing over the front cover.

2222
01:00:23,391 --> 01:00:27,260
So you can't even see what it's in there
until you open the plastic and yeah,

2223
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:28,550
it's a sort of represented,

2224
01:00:28,551 --> 01:00:30,290
but not 30 to 40%.

2225
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:31,161
Not even close.

2226
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:31,431
It's not.

2227
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:33,110
It's like 1% maybe of the,

2228
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,480
all the magazines at a Barnes and noble,

2229
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:36,111
you know,

2230
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:38,660
1% of them may be or pornographic.

2231
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:39,800
It's even in there.

2232
01:00:39,801 --> 01:00:41,540
They're never like hardcore either.

2233
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,820
It's just like they show
you like tits and shit.

2234
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:46,720
They show you like a little little
spread apart if you're lucky girls,

2235
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:47,570
peanut on somebody.

2236
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:48,190
No.

2237
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:53,140
That's why I can't understand why like
magazines like playboy or giving $1

2238
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,140
million to Lindsay Lohan when you
know how the Internet works nowadays.

2239
01:00:56,141 --> 01:00:56,891
If Lindsay Lohan,

2240
01:00:56,891 --> 01:00:58,330
there's a photo of her from playboy.

2241
01:00:58,570 --> 01:01:00,490
Everybody's going to have
it in like two seconds.

2242
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:00,911
Yeah.

2243
01:01:00,911 --> 01:01:02,290
They're counting on the rubes.

2244
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:05,650
The count on the people that just
can't get online quick enough.

2245
01:01:05,651 --> 01:01:07,450
They don't know anybody with the forum.

2246
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:08,573
The forum,

2247
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,790
I go on the forum and
then what do I do it?

2248
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:12,731
They don't know that.

2249
01:01:12,731 --> 01:01:13,511
They don't know what they're doing.

2250
01:01:13,511 --> 01:01:13,810
Man,

2251
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:15,130
they're just fucking knuckleheads.

2252
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,950
I feel bad for the board on vacation.

2253
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,400
Maybe.

2254
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,700
I feel bad for my mom cause she,

2255
01:01:19,701 --> 01:01:20,490
she recently,

2256
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:21,010
she,

2257
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,110
they still don't have
internet at her house,

2258
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:23,441
you know,

2259
01:01:23,441 --> 01:01:24,274
like Dsl.

2260
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:27,880
So she now got a hot spot phone,

2261
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:32,230
a smart phone that has a hot spot so
she can get on the Internet through her

2262
01:01:32,231 --> 01:01:33,040
phone,

2263
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:33,550
you know.

2264
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:33,910
Wow.

2265
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:34,700
So it's stupid.

2266
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,533
It's shit.

2267
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:37,540
It's not even a four g phone.

2268
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:39,680
She's a three g and a,

2269
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:40,630
so now she's,

2270
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:45,340
she's has fast I internet and we wouldn't
have had the internet or like a whole

2271
01:01:45,341 --> 01:01:45,760
life.

2272
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,380
And even when porn started coming up,

2273
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:49,750
it used to be like
really slow loading porn.

2274
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:50,240
So it's like,

2275
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:50,951
oh my God,

2276
01:01:50,951 --> 01:01:52,060
there's the bottom of balls.

2277
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,700
When we were talking about that in the
last podcast with that guy that got

2278
01:01:54,701 --> 01:01:56,830
caught who was doing
the gay porn and that,

2279
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,400
my friend actually had to sit in a room
with them and download the picture as a

2280
01:02:00,401 --> 01:02:01,360
picture is downloading.

2281
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:01,471
Yes.

2282
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,490
He's more of his head and then
he sees a dick in his mouth.

2283
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:03,970
Yeah.

2284
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:04,181
Well,

2285
01:02:04,181 --> 01:02:06,220
it's funny how that sequence,

2286
01:02:06,221 --> 01:02:06,821
we kind of,

2287
01:02:06,821 --> 01:02:07,390
you know,

2288
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:11,280
she now just go to a website by mistake
and it's like buttholes assholes calm

2289
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:12,170

2290
01:02:12,171 --> 01:02:12,770
Instantly.

2291
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,180
Yeah.

2292
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,000
She has no,

2293
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,231
no.

2294
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:14,841
And she had,

2295
01:02:14,841 --> 01:02:18,160
it doesn't have any kind of like warning
or training for the Internet as a

2296
01:02:18,161 --> 01:02:19,500
windows computer too doesn't she's.

2297
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:19,741
Yes.

2298
01:02:19,741 --> 01:02:20,040
And she's

2299
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,450
already installed everything.

2300
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:21,960
Putting,

2301
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,450
put her social security number

2302
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,960
signed up for Netflix three times somehow.

2303
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:29,040
Oh No,

2304
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,280
I told you about the time that
somebody hacked me on Twitter.

2305
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:33,720
They'll tell you about
that happens all the time,

2306
01:02:33,721 --> 01:02:33,901
man.

2307
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:35,610
I got it yesterday because
somebody sent me like a,

2308
01:02:35,611 --> 01:02:36,810
hey check out this photo of you.

2309
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:38,400
I can't believe you
have that in your mouth.

2310
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:38,821
And I'm like,

2311
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:39,061
what?

2312
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:42,630
And I click on it and then the website
turned to I Twitter but it looked exactly

2313
01:02:42,631 --> 01:02:43,890
like Twitter and had me log in.

2314
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:44,820
Of course I didn't it,

2315
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:45,540
I didn't do it.

2316
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:45,900
Well,

2317
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:46,261
yeah,

2318
01:02:46,261 --> 01:02:47,041
with me.

2319
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:49,920
I had to I to look at something,

2320
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:53,190
I think I had to click on
something and somehow or another,

2321
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:58,050
you know there's a lot of times when
you like install like quick vid are all

2322
01:02:58,051 --> 01:02:58,884
these little,

2323
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,370
little,

2324
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:00,000
you know,

2325
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
picked Vic and the little little fucking
websites and software that runs videos

2326
01:03:05,071 --> 01:03:05,820
and pictures.

2327
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:09,300
There's like some user agreements that
they're creepy like they're allowed to

2328
01:03:09,301 --> 01:03:11,430
like use your Twitter and tweet shit.

2329
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:13,530
Yeah Dude,

2330
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,850
this is fucking tweet.

2331
01:03:14,851 --> 01:03:15,601
It said on my,

2332
01:03:15,601 --> 01:03:20,550
on my Twitter I that I just entered a
contest for an iPad two and I looked at

2333
01:03:20,551 --> 01:03:21,331
that and someone said,

2334
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:23,220
what do you [inaudible] is this spam?

2335
01:03:23,221 --> 01:03:24,480
Like someone was saying it's spam,

2336
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:25,021
you know,

2337
01:03:25,021 --> 01:03:25,370
are you,

2338
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:25,560
are you,

2339
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:28,080
did you really enter the for
an iPad two and I want to what?

2340
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:29,520
So I go to my timeline.

2341
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:30,900
When I was busy,

2342
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:31,290
I wasn't,

2343
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:32,190
I wasn't online,

2344
01:03:32,191 --> 01:03:33,024
I wasn't doing shit.

2345
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,550
Somehow or another through my Twitter,

2346
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:38,820
they had tweeted that I had
signed up for a contest,

2347
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:40,830
which I never signed up
for a contest in the link.

2348
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:44,010
When you click the link
was this scam website,

2349
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:44,521
do you think?

2350
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:44,760
Uh,

2351
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,100
do you remember like doing
one of those where like,

2352
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:47,341
oh,

2353
01:03:47,341 --> 01:03:48,180
I got to login?

2354
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:48,811
No,

2355
01:03:48,811 --> 01:03:49,800
I did not log in.

2356
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,210
I don't know how the fuck they did it.

2357
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,230
I don't know what they did.

2358
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:52,600
That's weird.

2359
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,250
I did not.

2360
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:53,520
No,

2361
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,780
I did not log in and it was a new program
that I had somehow or another that

2362
01:03:57,781 --> 01:04:00,930
recently got on my Twitter and
on top of that they fought.

2363
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,500
I fought,

2364
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,920
was following them on Twitter
and I did not follow them.

2365
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:05,480
They,

2366
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,600
they followed,

2367
01:04:06,601 --> 01:04:07,830
they put that in my Twitter.

2368
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:10,530
They made me follow them
and they made a tweet.

2369
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,030
So I had to change my password,

2370
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:13,050
but I went to it.

2371
01:04:13,051 --> 01:04:16,590
I went to the website and the guy
had like 100,000 fucking hits.

2372
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:17,070
Wow.

2373
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,330
And would you report it?

2374
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:18,541
Yeah.

2375
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:18,900
Yeah,

2376
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:19,440
I did.

2377
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,710
He had 100,000 followers on his
as Twitter site and I was like,

2378
01:04:22,711 --> 01:04:23,221
this is incredible.

2379
01:04:23,221 --> 01:04:23,911
I've never heard of this guy.

2380
01:04:23,911 --> 01:04:25,710
He's got 100,000 fucking followers.

2381
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:26,790
And you know,

2382
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:27,060
I,

2383
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,070
I tweeted online,

2384
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,120
I'm not going to say the guy's name,

2385
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:30,851
I'm not going to say that.

2386
01:04:30,851 --> 01:04:30,991
The,

2387
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:32,640
I don't want to give them any publicity,

2388
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:33,150
you know,

2389
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:34,890
and I'm not going to be
to hate what he's doing.

2390
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:35,191
Okay.

2391
01:04:35,191 --> 01:04:38,970
What he's the owner is doing is just
selling traffic and trying to like,

2392
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:39,331
you know,

2393
01:04:39,331 --> 01:04:42,420
do scams and trying to get
people to his website with scams.

2394
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:45,810
He's not stealing any credit
card information as far
as I know he's doing stuff

2395
01:04:45,811 --> 01:04:46,320
that's like,

2396
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:46,561
right.

2397
01:04:46,561 --> 01:04:47,220
All your shit.

2398
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,570
Slightly sleazy.

2399
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:49,830
You know,

2400
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:50,663
I'm like tweets,

2401
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,060
if he had your login somehow
he probably could download it.

2402
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:55,350
All your private messages.

2403
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:56,280
Yeah.

2404
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,113
But there might be.

2405
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:57,631
It could be.

2406
01:04:57,631 --> 01:04:57,901
Yeah.

2407
01:04:57,901 --> 01:04:58,734
But there wasn't,

2408
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,580
but um,

2409
01:04:59,580 --> 01:04:59,741
the,

2410
01:04:59,741 --> 01:04:59,911
the,

2411
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:03,180
the point is that I don't think
what he's doing as a terrible thing,

2412
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:03,811
but it just,

2413
01:05:03,811 --> 01:05:04,644
it was creepy.

2414
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:08,280
It was creepy that all of a sudden some
guy like makes a tweet from my Twitter

2415
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,930
about some fucking contest.

2416
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:10,561
And then,

2417
01:05:10,561 --> 01:05:10,801
you know,

2418
01:05:10,801 --> 01:05:12,180
it turns out that I had met this dude,

2419
01:05:12,181 --> 01:05:16,230
he had been to like a bunch of you fcs
and they had pictures with me and he's

2420
01:05:16,231 --> 01:05:17,980
like made a little blog about
it and that's when it got

2421
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,300
really creepy cause you made it,

2422
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:21,250
this little blog about
it and then send me,

2423
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:24,060
sent a tweet about it
with my name in it in uh,

2424
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:25,720
the title of this blog.

2425
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,050
And I got the same tweet from no bullshit,

2426
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:32,260
maybe 50 or 60 other Twitter sites.

2427
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,670
So he has like all these fake Twitter
accounts and all of these accounts.

2428
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:37,540
When I would go to them,

2429
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:40,000
they would have all the exact same tweets.

2430
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:41,590
So he just has like,

2431
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:41,980
just,

2432
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:42,190
uh,

2433
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:47,190
just swarming the Internet was spam and
bullshit and then infecting your Twitter

2434
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,400
and then tweeting from your
Twitter and making you follow him.

2435
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,370
So out of the hundred thousand
people that were following him,

2436
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:54,791
you know,

2437
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:57,490
who knows how many of them
voluntarily signed up for it?

2438
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:01,600
Cause I know I fucking sure as fuck
didn't nobody uses my Twitter except me.

2439
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:01,881
I,

2440
01:06:01,881 --> 01:06:02,500
I don't,

2441
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,330
no one even has the password except me.

2442
01:06:04,331 --> 01:06:04,721
No one's,

2443
01:06:04,721 --> 01:06:07,060
I don't have an assistant
that does that Shit,

2444
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:07,690
you know?

2445
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:09,370
So when I know who I follow,

2446
01:06:09,371 --> 01:06:11,690
I wasn't following that guy and
he was the last one I followed.

2447
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,200
So it was like a recent thing and
I looked at it and I was like,

2448
01:06:14,201 --> 01:06:15,550
this is nuts man.

2449
01:06:15,551 --> 01:06:16,210
This is what,

2450
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,230
it's really nothing,

2451
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:17,531
you know,

2452
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:18,364
cause it's isn't,

2453
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:19,100
there's no point

2454
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:19,350
done.

2455
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:19,980
It shows that,

2456
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:22,820
that somehow he got into something
exerts you could be in your email,

2457
01:06:22,821 --> 01:06:23,480
you can be in your,

2458
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,690
which just shows the
vulnerability of at least Twitter.

2459
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:27,170
Right.

2460
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:27,561
You know,

2461
01:06:27,561 --> 01:06:28,071
and you know,

2462
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:30,950
of course people have done
that on Facebook and then
a bunch of other things and

2463
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,050
you know,

2464
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:32,480
it's,

2465
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,180
it's a common thing on the Internet
to misrepresent who you are.

2466
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:36,373
You know?

2467
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:37,211
I don't know.

2468
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:37,441
It's,

2469
01:06:37,441 --> 01:06:38,274
uh,

2470
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:39,051
it's just,

2471
01:06:39,051 --> 01:06:39,380
uh,

2472
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:41,660
when you have information online,

2473
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:42,350
you know,

2474
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:45,860
and then they're putting it on servers
and people are going to be able to get

2475
01:06:45,861 --> 01:06:45,981
it.

2476
01:06:45,981 --> 01:06:46,380
Man.

2477
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:46,700
It's just,

2478
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,840
they're just going to be able to get it.

2479
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:50,480
You have to assume that the ultimate,

2480
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:55,160
like the fight right now is everybody's
trying to keep everybody else from

2481
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,930
getting at their information,

2482
01:06:56,931 --> 01:06:58,190
getting out of their data,

2483
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:58,760
getting it.

2484
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,870
But the real truth is eventually
there's going to be no secrets.

2485
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,140
You're not going to be the w.

2486
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:08,180
The idea of privacy is
going to be out the window.

2487
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:10,130
It's not going to exist anymore.

2488
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:14,930
And essentially that's probably what's
going to be the doom of the financial

2489
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:15,764
system as well.

2490
01:07:15,950 --> 01:07:17,960
It'll be impossible to hold onto money.

2491
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:19,213
There'll be,

2492
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:20,840
it'll be impossible to,

2493
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,340
it won't make any sense.

2494
01:07:22,341 --> 01:07:24,270
Everyone's going to have to
access to everybody else's money.

2495
01:07:24,271 --> 01:07:24,471
You're just,

2496
01:07:24,471 --> 01:07:25,700
cause we don't steal from each other.

2497
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:25,940
Right.

2498
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:29,090
It's like the interconnectivity will
eventually reach some sort of a boiling

2499
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:30,470
point when if you look at what's,

2500
01:07:30,471 --> 01:07:32,600
what's what people are
capable of doing now,

2501
01:07:32,601 --> 01:07:34,850
it's stealing credit card
numbers and you know,

2502
01:07:34,851 --> 01:07:39,470
and and essentially getting at the ones
and Zeros that you'll use to get by and

2503
01:07:39,471 --> 01:07:43,310
those ones and Zeros are all
tallied and scored online.

2504
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:46,160
Eventually people are going to get to a
point where those don't mean anything.

2505
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:49,430
They're going to get into those things
and they're just gonna fuck the whole

2506
01:07:49,431 --> 01:07:52,010
system sideways and it
won't be worth anything.

2507
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:53,220
Yeah.

2508
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:56,400
Well I've had my credit card
stolen numbers stolen twice,

2509
01:07:56,401 --> 01:07:57,840
three times since I've lived in La.

2510
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:58,110
Yeah.

2511
01:07:58,110 --> 01:08:00,150
I've had it stolen
before to a gas station.

2512
01:08:00,151 --> 01:08:00,870
Gas Station.

2513
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:01,340
Yeah.

2514
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:02,370
And in waiters,

2515
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,990
waiters will have little readers.

2516
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,550
So when you pay for your bill,

2517
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,140
they'll come in and just
like scan your thing in.

2518
01:08:07,141 --> 01:08:09,150
They're in their apron and
then give it back to yeah.

2519
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:10,440
That was a weird feeling when I got it.

2520
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:10,811
Oh,

2521
01:08:10,811 --> 01:08:12,060
from my accountants.

2522
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:14,520
Are you buying $1,000 worth of chocolate?

2523
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:15,210
Yeah.

2524
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:16,640
That was like what they would,

2525
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:17,520
they were buying shit.

2526
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:18,530
I wish.

2527
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,300
Well they were buying
things that they could sell,

2528
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:21,380
like they're buying.

2529
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:21,950
Um,

2530
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:23,990
like the gift cards.

2531
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:24,321
Yeah.

2532
01:08:24,321 --> 01:08:24,770
And then,

2533
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:25,011
you know,

2534
01:08:25,011 --> 01:08:25,401
hey man,

2535
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:25,971
you want me to get a girl?

2536
01:08:25,971 --> 01:08:26,481
Feel good.

2537
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:27,920
I've got a hundred dollar gift card,

2538
01:08:27,921 --> 01:08:28,430
Bro.

2539
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:31,460
$20 notice I made him an urban character.

2540
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:31,730
Yeah.

2541
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:32,563
Why was that?

2542
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:33,250
I Dunno.

2543
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:34,250
I was going to go with Armenian,

2544
01:08:34,251 --> 01:08:35,300
but I wasn't confident with my,

2545
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:36,523
my,

2546
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:38,780
that sounds just so standard.

2547
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,520
So formulaic.

2548
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,840
I didn't want to go with that one.

2549
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:42,471
So,

2550
01:08:42,471 --> 01:08:42,770
um,

2551
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:43,040
uh,

2552
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:43,910
in Canada,

2553
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:44,451
Dave,

2554
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:44,900
um,

2555
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,760
this is our fucking big news.

2556
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:48,170
All the experts,

2557
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:51,890
a coalition of prominent BC police
officer's health professionals,

2558
01:08:51,891 --> 01:08:52,970
leaguer experts,

2559
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:57,590
academics and academics are calling for
the legalization and regulated sale of

2560
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:58,424
marijuana.

2561
01:08:58,490 --> 01:08:59,450
It's really kind of nuts,

2562
01:08:59,451 --> 01:09:00,284
man.

2563
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:01,580
Dude,

2564
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,240
come on man.

2565
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,170
A coalition.

2566
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:03,800
Listen to that.

2567
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,190
Of police officers off of the roof.

2568
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:08,723
That's

2569
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:10,913
why.

2570
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:11,600
Why do we,

2571
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,700
why is gay associated
with a list sometimes?

2572
01:09:13,701 --> 01:09:15,110
What does that cause
it's usually have Cox,

2573
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:16,123
Cox in her mouth.

2574
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:16,963
Is that what it is?

2575
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:18,453
Painful.

2576
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,990
But how come girls don't get sloppy
when they're sucking Dick all the time?

2577
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:21,843
They don't start Lisbon.

2578
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,600
If you'd imagine if that would like,

2579
01:09:23,601 --> 01:09:24,650
you found out that girls,

2580
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,680
like if you talked to
girls like y'alls girls,

2581
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:27,561
Lisbon like crazy.

2582
01:09:27,561 --> 01:09:29,060
She been sucking dicks all weekend.

2583
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:30,470
And when you suck decks,

2584
01:09:30,471 --> 01:09:32,030
like it feels good for the guy,

2585
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,110
but I'm going to lift.

2586
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:35,030
You're going to make me laugh baby.

2587
01:09:35,031 --> 01:09:35,781
It feels so good though.

2588
01:09:35,781 --> 01:09:36,171
I don't care.

2589
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:37,070
I don't care about that list.

2590
01:09:37,071 --> 01:09:37,490
It doesn't,

2591
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:38,990
it doesn't turn you off from nine lift.

2592
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,030
Has a lot of guys have fed,

2593
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,490
reminds them of all the of
the Dick fell off packed.

2594
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,090
Like if you have a bank of dicks you
can only suck a certain amount and then

2595
01:09:47,091 --> 01:09:51,410
your lips just give out and your tongue
gets all sloppy and you produce extra

2596
01:09:51,411 --> 01:09:55,040
saliva and it not only do you
list be spit on people dudes,

2597
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:55,671
it's still want their dick.

2598
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:55,940
Sorry,

2599
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:56,780
I don't care baby.

2600
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,780
I don't care because a new doctor
and he's going to glean your drain,

2601
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:00,920
your salivary glands.

2602
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,410
The bad news is you got to
drink water every 30 seconds,

2603
01:10:03,411 --> 01:10:07,340
but the good news is you won't this
pending and their teeth are all nicely

2604
01:10:07,341 --> 01:10:10,770
polished just for the front being
rubbed against somebody talks.

2605
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:11,210
Yeah,

2606
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:12,260
they don't even really a brush.

2607
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,170
It's Cox or and going and then
pushing that all the food.

2608
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:17,460
You know that's how the head
of the Dick has designed these,

2609
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,840
you know the head of the Dick is designed
to actually like the reason why your

2610
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:24,380
Dick is like pointing at the top and it
has like that little bulging area that

2611
01:10:24,381 --> 01:10:26,630
like goes in and then the shaft comes out.

2612
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:30,770
It's cause it's designed to push down
into the woman's vagina and squirt all the

2613
01:10:30,771 --> 01:10:33,380
sperm up and then pull the sperm out.

2614
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,150
That's what it's designed for.

2615
01:10:35,151 --> 01:10:35,601
If you like,

2616
01:10:35,601 --> 01:10:37,190
look at the way the head is,

2617
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:37,371
you know,

2618
01:10:37,371 --> 01:10:41,540
see the head is like sort of like a
helmet with the idea is that the way it's

2619
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:42,350
shaped,

2620
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:45,950
it would go in and whatever sperm was
in there would actually get pressed up

2621
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:50,630
against the Dick and forced up to the
top where it was stored on this lip and

2622
01:10:50,631 --> 01:10:53,210
then you would pull it out and
then you shoot your own in there.

2623
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:54,780
Like what?

2624
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:55,640
What does,

2625
01:10:55,770 --> 01:11:00,770
the whole idea of breeding is designed
under the idea that someone had already

2626
01:11:01,551 --> 01:11:02,384
fucked her first.

2627
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:03,290
For sure.

2628
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:07,580
The whole design of the Dick
is designed to just like,

2629
01:11:07,581 --> 01:11:08,570
we just get this,

2630
01:11:08,571 --> 01:11:09,380
get this out of the way.

2631
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:10,213
Someone's fucked her.

2632
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:10,910
Okay,

2633
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:12,650
you gotta get that juice out
and put your own in this,

2634
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:13,620
the only one going have kids.

2635
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,240
Fucking amazing.

2636
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,370
It's really amazing when you
stop and think about that.

2637
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:21,400
There was a theory for a while
but it was disproven where uh,

2638
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:21,780
they were,

2639
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:25,080
they were thinking that a certain
amount of sperm were attacks berm.

2640
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:26,070
I love this idea.

2641
01:11:26,071 --> 01:11:29,550
It was a great idea and I really wished
it was evidence for it cause I would

2642
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:30,630
have some material on it.

2643
01:11:30,830 --> 01:11:33,780
I could almost like ignore it
just to do a bid on it but fuck,

2644
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:34,290
I can't,

2645
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,123
it's not true.

2646
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:35,550
That,

2647
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:38,700
and what they were saying was that a
certain amount of sperm were actually

2648
01:11:38,701 --> 01:11:42,570
designed just to go in and
attack and kill other sperm.

2649
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:46,350
But it was like this one guy who had
this theory and apparently a lot of other

2650
01:11:46,351 --> 01:11:46,831
people are like,

2651
01:11:46,831 --> 01:11:47,940
where's the fucking evidence for it?

2652
01:11:47,941 --> 01:11:48,930
It's like this is nuts.

2653
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:51,270
This is like how do you,

2654
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:52,680
how do you,

2655
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:52,900
what?

2656
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,270
What are they killing each other with?

2657
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,200
They have bats,

2658
01:11:55,230 --> 01:11:56,063
you know,

2659
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:56,850
he's killer scrub.

2660
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:57,900
They just fucking cells.

2661
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,070
It just loads.

2662
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,030
You know what he talking about?

2663
01:12:00,031 --> 01:12:04,080
Loads that kill what bitch you
reading some science fiction.

2664
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:04,891
You know what?

2665
01:12:04,891 --> 01:12:05,630
I love the idea though.

2666
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:06,650
One of my favorite things to do.

2667
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:11,150
You ever take your ball skin and then
wrap it around your boss and your Dick and

2668
01:12:11,151 --> 01:12:12,890
make a little like backwards bowling ball.

2669
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:13,610
Have you ever done that?

2670
01:12:13,610 --> 01:12:14,900
One of my favorite things to do.

2671
01:12:14,901 --> 01:12:16,310
You said so if someone says,

2672
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:17,563
Hey Brian,

2673
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:17,991
no,

2674
01:12:17,991 --> 01:12:20,780
would you like to do ride a race car one?

2675
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:21,970
No.

2676
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:22,830
Like Dick Suck.

2677
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:26,180
It freaks them out because they can't
understand what's going on cause they

2678
01:12:26,181 --> 01:12:27,350
don't know balls that well.

2679
01:12:27,351 --> 01:12:29,150
And at that point
they'll probably be like,

2680
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:30,170
why am I here?

2681
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:35,000
What have I done to deserve this guy in
front of me pulling his ball skin over

2682
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:35,900
his belly button?

2683
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:36,980
And if you have a lot of hair,

2684
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:38,310
they can't find the scene.

2685
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,460
Amazing

2686
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:44,580
backwards bullying Paul.

2687
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,031
No,

2688
01:12:45,031 --> 01:12:45,900
I've never heard of that man.

2689
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:46,260
Do it.

2690
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:46,991
To go back to this,

2691
01:12:46,991 --> 01:12:47,281
um,

2692
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:48,870
this illegalized BC thing,

2693
01:12:48,871 --> 01:12:50,080
one of the reason why they're,

2694
01:12:50,081 --> 01:12:50,310
uh,

2695
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:54,240
thinking about legalizing marijuana is
the results from Portugal apparently.

2696
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:55,800
So Portugal,

2697
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:58,560
they decriminalized all drugs,

2698
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:00,810
drug use in 2001.

2699
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:05,250
And the theory was that
focusing on prevention and
treatment rather than jailing

2700
01:13:05,251 --> 01:13:07,800
users would be the most beneficial way.

2701
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:10,590
So Portugal try decriminalization and,

2702
01:13:10,591 --> 01:13:10,711
uh,

2703
01:13:10,711 --> 01:13:12,120
the use of possession of heroin,

2704
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:12,661
cocaine,

2705
01:13:12,661 --> 01:13:13,141
marijuana,

2706
01:13:13,141 --> 01:13:15,360
LSD and other illicit drugs.

2707
01:13:15,361 --> 01:13:16,620
All those were decriminalized.

2708
01:13:16,621 --> 01:13:20,610
And five years later they found that the
number of street drug overdoses dropped

2709
01:13:20,611 --> 01:13:22,680
from 400 to two 90 annually.

2710
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:27,950
And the new number of HIV cases
linked dropped from 1400 to about 400.

2711
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:31,110
So a thousand less HIV cases and you know,

2712
01:13:31,111 --> 01:13:32,310
110 less,

2713
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:32,800
um,

2714
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:33,180
uh,

2715
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,290
drug overdoses.

2716
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:35,490
I mean that's a lot man.

2717
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:36,061
You know,

2718
01:13:36,061 --> 01:13:38,700
and the dealings drugs is still illegal.

2719
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:39,810
You still can't deal it,

2720
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,790
but the users aren't jailed.

2721
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:45,540
Instead they're putting in front of a
panel that includes one lawyer or a judge

2722
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:47,370
and a health or a social services worker.

2723
01:13:47,371 --> 01:13:49,710
And the panel can recommend treatment and,

2724
01:13:49,711 --> 01:13:52,080
or a small fine or no sanction at all.

2725
01:13:52,081 --> 01:13:53,040
So it's based on,

2726
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:53,491
you know,

2727
01:13:53,491 --> 01:13:55,530
what kind of an impact
you're having on society.

2728
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:55,741
I mean,

2729
01:13:55,741 --> 01:13:55,830
you,

2730
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:55,890
uh,

2731
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:56,200
you,

2732
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:56,610
uh,

2733
01:13:56,610 --> 01:14:00,090
you do and drugs then breaking people's
windows you'd do and drugs and shitting

2734
01:14:00,091 --> 01:14:00,870
in the street.

2735
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:03,180
Well they might find you for shitting in
the street cause someone's got to clean

2736
01:14:03,181 --> 01:14:03,810
that up.

2737
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:05,280
But it's amazing that it's really,

2738
01:14:05,281 --> 01:14:05,521
it's,

2739
01:14:05,521 --> 01:14:10,260
it's shown that it's better to have these
things legal and decriminalize and not

2740
01:14:10,261 --> 01:14:11,500
lock up the users.

2741
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:13,560
So Canada is looking at
this and they're going,

2742
01:14:13,561 --> 01:14:15,070
why the fuck are we in?

2743
01:14:15,071 --> 01:14:15,671
The reason why,

2744
01:14:15,671 --> 01:14:17,440
the number one reason why is America,

2745
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:21,320
America wants candidate to keep their
fucking laws exactly the same way that

2746
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:22,330
constantly been pushing,

2747
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,260
putting pressure on them.

2748
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:24,400
It's just embarrassing.

2749
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:26,560
It's getting to the point where
it's embarrassing that marijuana,

2750
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:27,850
it's embarrassing.

2751
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:28,570
It is embarrassing.

2752
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:29,261
It's ridiculous.

2753
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:30,011
It's like no,

2754
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:31,840
no other end people.

2755
01:14:31,841 --> 01:14:33,000
So it's just drug.

2756
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:34,540
You know what he fucking drug him in.

2757
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:36,370
You need a drug that's not even it.

2758
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,860
Even if I never wanted to do marijuana
again for the rest of my life,

2759
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:43,180
I would still say that you telling me I
can't do it as the most ridiculous thing

2760
01:14:43,181 --> 01:14:44,110
I've ever heard in my life.

2761
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:47,530
It's like if you are living alone on an
island and there was only four people on

2762
01:14:47,531 --> 01:14:48,790
the island and one of them said,

2763
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:49,780
if you smoke weed,

2764
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:50,830
I'm going to lock in jail.

2765
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:51,940
The other three would be like,

2766
01:14:51,941 --> 01:14:53,410
what the fuck are you talking about?

2767
01:14:53,411 --> 01:14:53,621
Dude,

2768
01:14:53,621 --> 01:14:55,060
we've got other shit to worry about.

2769
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:58,870
Why do you care if I want to sit on the
island and get high once I do my chores?

2770
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:02,590
What do you give a fuck if I'm productive
members so well that that one person

2771
01:15:02,591 --> 01:15:06,670
at a four is just as ridiculous as
what we've got going on right now.

2772
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:09,880
What we've got going on right now is
some people and they're telling other

2773
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:12,190
people what they can and
can't do with their body.

2774
01:15:12,191 --> 01:15:13,540
It doesn't hurt a God damn thing.

2775
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,280
And that's stupid.

2776
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:17,770
And at least Canada's
figuring that out first.

2777
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:20,890
But they still deported
that Mark Emery Guy,

2778
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,061
the poor fucking guy,

2779
01:15:22,061 --> 01:15:25,810
man was living free in his own
country and he was selling seeds,

2780
01:15:25,811 --> 01:15:27,550
seeds to a goddamn plant.

2781
01:15:27,551 --> 01:15:28,420
That makes you silly.

2782
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:29,291
What are you going,

2783
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:29,831
you got to go pee?

2784
01:15:29,831 --> 01:15:30,760
I'm going to talk about myself.

2785
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:31,594
This is ridiculous.

2786
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:33,670
You fucking weak bladder bitch,

2787
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:34,860
by the way.

2788
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:35,140
Um,

2789
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:36,550
I will be playing the,

2790
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:36,850
uh,

2791
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:38,770
UFC drinking game this weekend,

2792
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:39,971
this weekend.

2793
01:15:39,971 --> 01:15:40,161
Uh,

2794
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:44,140
the UFC is in Vegas and it's
a Bj Penn versus Nick Diaz.

2795
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:45,573
Unfortunately,

2796
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,340
George St Pierre was
supposed to be fighting,

2797
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:50,230
was supposed to be fighting Carlos
condit and fucking amazing fight,

2798
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,880
but it was really looking forward to,

2799
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:52,791
it was the whole car.

2800
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:53,441
It was kind of crazy.

2801
01:15:53,441 --> 01:15:54,274
It started out,

2802
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:55,090
it was a,

2803
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:57,910
Nick Diaz was supposed to be fighting
George Saint Pierre and Nick Diaz kind of

2804
01:15:57,911 --> 01:16:01,120
flaked at a few press conferences and
then they pulled them out and said,

2805
01:16:01,121 --> 01:16:01,361
all right,

2806
01:16:01,361 --> 01:16:02,980
Carlos Khan is now fighting GSP.

2807
01:16:02,981 --> 01:16:03,641
And everybody was like,

2808
01:16:03,641 --> 01:16:04,474
what?

2809
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,650
And then they said,

2810
01:16:05,651 --> 01:16:06,071
Nick Diaz,

2811
01:16:06,071 --> 01:16:06,791
you still want to fight,

2812
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:08,440
you got to fucking do press all this shit.

2813
01:16:08,441 --> 01:16:08,741
And he's like,

2814
01:16:08,741 --> 01:16:09,041
okay,

2815
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:09,401
all right,

2816
01:16:09,401 --> 01:16:10,360
you're fighting Bj Penn.

2817
01:16:10,361 --> 01:16:10,841
And everybody's like,

2818
01:16:10,841 --> 01:16:11,770
Holy Shit.

2819
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:15,550
Cause actually that made it even
like that's pretty God damn exciting.

2820
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:18,460
It was supposed to be GSP versus um,

2821
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:18,840
uh,

2822
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,510
be GSP versus condit,

2823
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:21,640
which is an amazing fight.

2824
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:23,600
GSP versus Diaz Rather,

2825
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:24,610
which is an amazing fight.

2826
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:25,623
And he got,

2827
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:26,021
you know,

2828
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:28,360
condit versus GM versus Bj Penn,

2829
01:16:28,361 --> 01:16:29,620
which is another amazing fight.

2830
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,750
So they essentially just
swapped and it was eagle then.

2831
01:16:31,751 --> 01:16:33,820
Unfortunately it was even rather,

2832
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:37,390
but unfortunately GSP hurt
his knee and he fell out.

2833
01:16:37,391 --> 01:16:37,571
He,

2834
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:38,250
I think he had a,

2835
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:41,890
a strain or a strained MCL and uh,

2836
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:42,960
it's gonna be a couple of months.

2837
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:46,030
It has to do rehab on it
and shit and so really,

2838
01:16:46,031 --> 01:16:46,841
really big,

2839
01:16:46,841 --> 01:16:47,830
big disappointment.

2840
01:16:47,831 --> 01:16:50,560
But the rest of the card
is still fucking sick.

2841
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:51,581
There's a lot of,

2842
01:16:51,581 --> 01:16:53,020
a lot of good fights on this.

2843
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:55,870
Joey's coming down with me and um,

2844
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,330
Jamie Kilstein is coming up from New York.

2845
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:00,100
I was bringing his little
brother should be fun.

2846
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:01,060
I'm looking forward to it.

2847
01:17:01,061 --> 01:17:02,500
I haven't been to Vegas
in a long time either.

2848
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:03,230
It's been a while.

2849
01:17:03,230 --> 01:17:03,640
It's supposed to,

2850
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:06,400
to a Halloween party with that South Park.

2851
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:07,420
Uh Oh real.

2852
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:09,740
The people that work for south
park or throwing a party and

2853
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,170
I don't know what to go as it
cause everyone that goes there.

2854
01:17:12,171 --> 01:17:15,980
I went last year and the year
before and every time they go there,

2855
01:17:15,981 --> 01:17:16,220
they,

2856
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:17,420
everyone goes overboard.

2857
01:17:17,450 --> 01:17:19,880
Like everyone's like spending
months on their costumes.

2858
01:17:19,881 --> 01:17:22,370
You know you should be the
exploding desk squad cat,

2859
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:23,601
but yeah,

2860
01:17:23,601 --> 01:17:24,330
but what am I going?

2861
01:17:24,330 --> 01:17:28,080
Where am I going to get that and get a
cat outfit and some fucking fix that good

2862
01:17:28,081 --> 01:17:28,520
idea.

2863
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,360
Strap yourself together.

2864
01:17:29,361 --> 01:17:29,901
Get a watch.

2865
01:17:29,901 --> 01:17:31,190
Like a flavor flav clock.

2866
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:31,951
Oh,

2867
01:17:31,951 --> 01:17:32,571
that's a good idea.

2868
01:17:32,571 --> 01:17:33,201
We started with a thought,

2869
01:17:33,201 --> 01:17:34,530
don't go with a Hitler mustache.

2870
01:17:34,531 --> 01:17:35,950
She got to get rid of iTunes.

2871
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:37,040
Where you should take that off the,

2872
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:37,730
yeah,

2873
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:38,551
just take that off anyway.

2874
01:17:38,551 --> 01:17:39,384
It's stupid.

2875
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:39,711
Why?

2876
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,870
Given that stupid cat a Hitler,

2877
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:42,170
Hitler's chaplain.

2878
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:44,150
Chaplain.

2879
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:47,110
It's Hitler because Hitler is
after chaplain every everyone else.

2880
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:50,680
It's a mental test to see if you're a
Hitler chaplain and it just to see your

2881
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:51,200
personality.

2882
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,160
It's a personality test.

2883
01:17:52,161 --> 01:17:52,591
Have a little,

2884
01:17:52,591 --> 01:17:55,100
or it could be Michael Jordan
because he pulled it exactly.

2885
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:55,910
It's to Jordan,

2886
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:57,850
but that's a goofy move on Michael Jordan.

2887
01:17:57,870 --> 01:17:58,820
How big is his ego?

2888
01:17:59,130 --> 01:17:59,963
Yeah,

2889
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:01,573
Hitler mustache.

2890
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:03,410
I got the Kingsborough cat too,

2891
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:04,160
bro.

2892
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:06,260
I got the kick ass girl costume,

2893
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:07,061
but I think it's,

2894
01:18:07,061 --> 01:18:10,490
it's too tight because it's
a girl's extra large girl,

2895
01:18:10,491 --> 01:18:12,380
but that's only like a 32 waist,

2896
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,420
like gut hangs out of it.

2897
01:18:14,421 --> 01:18:14,810
It's hard.

2898
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:16,160
It's actually pretty funny looking.

2899
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:19,280
I don't know if I want to embarrass
myself because that's embarrassing.

2900
01:18:19,281 --> 01:18:23,030
You know when you have like a super tight
and you're dressed up as a girl at the

2901
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:23,570
same time,

2902
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:24,560
well you're supposed to be funny,

2903
01:18:24,561 --> 01:18:25,000
right?

2904
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,180
I guess you gotta be careful though.

2905
01:18:26,181 --> 01:18:26,540
You're going to,

2906
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:28,160
are you going to hang out with your girl?

2907
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:28,760
Yeah.

2908
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,140
You don't want to be too humiliating.

2909
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:30,740
Exactly.

2910
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:32,690
So the other thing is she's going
to go is when would be cool,

2911
01:18:32,691 --> 01:18:33,141
sexy,

2912
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:33,500
windy,

2913
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,330
sexy Wendy from the hamburger place.

2914
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:35,560
Yes.

2915
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:36,170
I'm going to be,

2916
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:36,920
I'm a Zombie.

2917
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:37,231
She goes,

2918
01:18:37,231 --> 01:18:37,650
he's dead.

2919
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:37,950
Okay.

2920
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:39,860
I was going to say she goes
a cow with a bullet hole.

2921
01:18:39,890 --> 01:18:40,420
Yeah.

2922
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:41,300
Can do that too.

2923
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:42,450
I was going to be Dave Thomas,

2924
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:43,460
but it's like decaying.

2925
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:45,230
He still has a little tie on and stuff,

2926
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:46,280
but you don't have to shave your beard.

2927
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:47,173
I know.

2928
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:48,440
It won't take two weeks,

2929
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:49,573
two weeks to go back.

2930
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:51,170
That's not a bad one.

2931
01:18:51,171 --> 01:18:53,210
If she got a theme thing going on,

2932
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:53,811
but then you know,

2933
01:18:53,811 --> 01:18:55,330
you've kind of be in the Beta to your,

2934
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:56,180
your chick's lead,

2935
01:18:56,380 --> 01:18:56,900
you know,

2936
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:57,950
you're following her lead.

2937
01:18:58,580 --> 01:18:58,761
You know,

2938
01:18:58,761 --> 01:18:59,900
maybe it could be a wolf that,

2939
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:03,020
that the big bad wolf that
catches Wendy in the woods.

2940
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:04,063
Or it could be Ronald,

2941
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:08,150
you'd be aware of wolf
catches her on the way home.

2942
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:11,180
Is there a bringing bonds back and
just give her the Dick in the bushes?

2943
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:11,590
Is there a tee?

2944
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:13,700
Somebody said that there's
a TV show from the 80s.

2945
01:19:13,701 --> 01:19:17,230
I was about werewolves that
Joe Rogan was a character in,

2946
01:19:17,231 --> 01:19:18,064
in the,

2947
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:19,570
the name Joe Rogan was a character.

2948
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:20,450
Yeah.

2949
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:21,190
Come on.

2950
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:21,680
Yeah.

2951
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:23,390
Probably some nonsense from Wikipedia.

2952
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:24,411
I didn't check.

2953
01:19:24,411 --> 01:19:25,880
So they had a god damn,

2954
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:26,121
uh,

2955
01:19:26,121 --> 01:19:26,901
some website.

2956
01:19:26,901 --> 01:19:29,810
I won't even give them the
dignity of naming the website.

2957
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:32,300
Had a list of a werewolf movies,

2958
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:33,860
the best werewolf movies ever.

2959
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:35,480
My God.

2960
01:19:35,481 --> 01:19:37,400
Is it a piece of shit list?

2961
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:38,361
First of all,

2962
01:19:38,361 --> 01:19:39,410
they had this,

2963
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:40,820
they didn't have the howling on,

2964
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,170
which is a goddamn Travis to,

2965
01:19:42,171 --> 01:19:44,330
you got to have the howling if
you're going to have werewolf movies.

2966
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:45,530
There's really only two.

2967
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,750
There's American Werewolf
in London and the howling,

2968
01:19:47,751 --> 01:19:48,770
those are the only two good ones.

2969
01:19:49,010 --> 01:19:51,110
American Werewolf in
London being far superior.

2970
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:53,450
That's the greatest werewolf
movie of all time for sure.

2971
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:55,670
But they have like ginger snaps,

2972
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:56,631
which I saw,

2973
01:19:56,631 --> 01:20:00,050
which was the werewolf was so bad.

2974
01:20:00,051 --> 01:20:03,860
It looked like someone drew a
scary face on a balloon werewolf.

2975
01:20:03,861 --> 01:20:08,240
A TV series for the 1987 to 1988 the
character's name was Alamo Joe Rogan.

2976
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:08,581
Oh,

2977
01:20:08,581 --> 01:20:09,660
that's hilarious.

2978
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:12,030
That is weird man.

2979
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,490
Wasn't Alamo Joe Rogan a
fucking baseball player.

2980
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,960
Wasn't that like a famous black baseball
player or there was like no rocket Joe

2981
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,970
Rogan or some point that Joe Rogan.

2982
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,770
Joe Rogan baseball player.

2983
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:24,510
Yeah.

2984
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:25,560
Famous black baseball player.

2985
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:27,960
But what it was is he had
like a nickname though.

2986
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:30,850
It was like hurricane something
or hold stick just right.

2987
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:31,230
Uh,

2988
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:31,801
Joe Rogan.

2989
01:20:31,801 --> 01:20:32,634
Baseball player.

2990
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:34,800
Joe Rogan.

2991
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:36,720
Baseball player.

2992
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:38,860
Yeah,

2993
01:20:38,860 --> 01:20:40,090
their asshole.

2994
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,880
Don't write that but cool.

2995
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:43,650
Don't worry about all the bullet.

2996
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,010
Yeah.

2997
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:44,880
Bullet Joe Rogan.

2998
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:46,380
He was in the Negro League.

2999
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:48,060
Isn't that crazy?

3000
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:49,180
See the resemblance.

3001
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:50,520
It's a lot like me.

3002
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:54,130
She just,

3003
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:55,560
we just had a failure.

3004
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:56,810
We have a mic,

3005
01:20:56,811 --> 01:20:59,470
arm failure and choked down.

3006
01:20:59,500 --> 01:20:59,790
Hey.

3007
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:00,623
Oh,

3008
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:01,763
where'd it go?

3009
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:03,960
It just gave up.

3010
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:09,000
We don't use the best components here
at the Joe Rogan experience podcast.

3011
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,920
Let me fit this spring back.

3012
01:21:10,921 --> 01:21:11,280
All right.

3013
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,270
Turn down your mic real quick.

3014
01:21:12,271 --> 01:21:13,200
So why do you do that?

3015
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:14,870
Uh,

3016
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:15,420
we owe,

3017
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:18,210
this is how I guess we can say it's
a death squad as a comedy show.

3018
01:21:18,211 --> 01:21:18,720
Uh,

3019
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,000
tomorrow at the Ice House
we have Duncan Trussell,

3020
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:21,221
uh,

3021
01:21:21,221 --> 01:21:22,860
is going to be there with little Hobo.

3022
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,560
Our Magical Stephen is
easy from the league.

3023
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:26,430
Uh,

3024
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:27,420
Kevin Christie,

3025
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,210
and it's same Tripoli's birthday tomorrow.

3026
01:21:29,211 --> 01:21:30,360
So we're having a huge party.

3027
01:21:30,361 --> 01:21:33,420
We're just going to get drunk and wasted
and Jason Tubo is going to drive us

3028
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:34,080
all.

3029
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:34,351
Uh,

3030
01:21:34,351 --> 01:21:35,850
so that's tomorrow at the Ice House.

3031
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:36,840
Eight and 10 o'clock.

3032
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:38,250
You got to icehouse website.

3033
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:39,061
You can buy tickets now.

3034
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:40,320
Last week it sold out.

3035
01:21:40,321 --> 01:21:43,270
We had Joe Rogan there and we're
also going to be recording a,

3036
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:43,660
another,

3037
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:44,580
a podcast there,

3038
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:45,001
uh,

3039
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:46,130
with Dunkin and,

3040
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:47,730
and so that's going to be interesting.

3041
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:48,750
Uh,

3042
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:50,490
Joe still fixing them?

3043
01:21:50,491 --> 01:21:51,324
Mike arm.

3044
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:52,860
I think we're back.

3045
01:21:52,861 --> 01:21:53,151
All right.

3046
01:21:53,151 --> 01:21:53,984
Sorry.

3047
01:21:54,570 --> 01:21:54,781
Yeah,

3048
01:21:54,781 --> 01:21:55,680
I got to get some better mind.

3049
01:21:55,681 --> 01:21:56,514
Go arms.

3050
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:57,141
I liked that.

3051
01:21:57,141 --> 01:21:57,830
I liked the old ones.

3052
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:58,710
We had better actually.

3053
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:00,090
I've been watching the guests use it.

3054
01:22:00,091 --> 01:22:01,080
It's not an arm,

3055
01:22:01,081 --> 01:22:02,850
it's just kind of like a pacing.

3056
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:03,703
That noise.

3057
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:04,040
Um,

3058
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:08,660
the best way is really to
have them stationary and you
just make the guy come up

3059
01:22:08,661 --> 01:22:09,320
to it.

3060
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,040
Yeah.

3061
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:10,873
You know,

3062
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:14,000
Corolla has it set up where he's got,

3063
01:22:14,001 --> 01:22:14,640
um,

3064
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,730
a straight arm and it's
screwed into the table.

3065
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:17,540
There's a straight arm.

3066
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:18,620
You can move it left or right,

3067
01:22:18,621 --> 01:22:19,290
but that's it.

3068
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:19,480
Right.

3069
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:20,301
That's really the best.

3070
01:22:20,301 --> 01:22:20,531
This,

3071
01:22:20,531 --> 01:22:21,740
this fucking thing is moving around.

3072
01:22:21,741 --> 01:22:22,580
Too much content on it.

3073
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:24,463
But it's back.

3074
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:28,560
But this seems so cool to
have this mechanical arm it
cause it seems like we're

3075
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:29,413
professionals.

3076
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:30,343
We're playing,

3077
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:31,273
we're playing radio,

3078
01:22:31,510 --> 01:22:32,050
radio.

3079
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:33,050
Well we're on the radio.

3080
01:22:33,051 --> 01:22:35,060
Legit now if you don't know,

3081
01:22:35,061 --> 01:22:36,650
we're on Sirius satellite radio.

3082
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:38,960
I don't know what channel it is.

3083
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:41,510
Opie and Anthony Channel used to be two
a two I think or something like that.

3084
01:22:41,511 --> 01:22:45,890
The buyer's opie and Anthony Channel
now it's really not the virus anymore.

3085
01:22:45,891 --> 01:22:47,090
They finally wised up.

3086
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:51,710
I mean ob open the Anthony's a fucking
huge radio station or a huge radio,

3087
01:22:51,711 --> 01:22:52,544
a shell.

3088
01:22:52,570 --> 01:22:56,150
And they had been calling it the
virus since the beginning for like,

3089
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,220
what has it been like eight
years or something crazy.

3090
01:22:58,221 --> 01:22:59,660
How long have you been on serious?

3091
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:00,703
Long time.

3092
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:01,311
I was serious.

3093
01:23:01,311 --> 01:23:02,690
What's sent me a free subscription.

3094
01:23:02,691 --> 01:23:04,190
At least they don't even give you shit.

3095
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:04,731
I don't give me that.

3096
01:23:04,731 --> 01:23:05,470
Don't care.

3097
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:05,860
Nothing.

3098
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:06,190
Nothing.

3099
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:07,210
You don't get a God damn thing.

3100
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:11,400
Did you hear them talk about Patrice
the other day on Opie and Anthony?

3101
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:12,550
I didn't hear it,

3102
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:13,900
but I heard about it through the Internet.

3103
01:23:14,570 --> 01:23:14,920
Uh,

3104
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,870
from the board as sad.

3105
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:17,171
Yeah.

3106
01:23:17,171 --> 01:23:19,030
Subvert or actually tweeted me about.

3107
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:19,390
I was like,

3108
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:20,223
wow.

3109
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:23,500
Then I went and looked
online and he had a stroke.

3110
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:24,453
You know,

3111
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:24,731
we,

3112
01:23:24,731 --> 01:23:26,290
we talk about it all the time,

3113
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,610
you know,

3114
01:23:27,610 --> 01:23:28,061
cause it's a,

3115
01:23:28,061 --> 01:23:30,610
it's a big thing in my head.

3116
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,880
You kind of take care
of your fucking shell.

3117
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:34,030
You've got to take care of your body.

3118
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:34,960
You have to,

3119
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:35,793
you gotta,

3120
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:36,161
you know,

3121
01:23:36,161 --> 01:23:37,450
you could fuck around a little bit,

3122
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:38,350
but God dammit,

3123
01:23:38,351 --> 01:23:40,960
overall you should really be kind of fit.

3124
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:42,850
You should do your best to be kind of fit.

3125
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:43,780
You'll have a better life.

3126
01:23:43,781 --> 01:23:44,411
You're really well.

3127
01:23:44,411 --> 01:23:45,340
If you eat healthy,

3128
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:46,480
take care of yourself,

3129
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,440
you'll have a better life.

3130
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:52,320
But Theresa is always a big guy and he
also had a lot of health problems too.

3131
01:23:52,321 --> 01:23:53,290
He had diabetes,

3132
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:55,150
which is just fucking,

3133
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:56,440
just a huge drag,

3134
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:57,251
you know?

3135
01:23:57,251 --> 01:23:57,970
And that,

3136
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:02,470
I don't know what contributes to a stroke
that could have easily contributed to

3137
01:24:02,471 --> 01:24:02,531
it.

3138
01:24:02,531 --> 01:24:04,480
And some people that are
real healthy get die,

3139
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:05,411
get strokes.

3140
01:24:05,411 --> 01:24:05,621
You know,

3141
01:24:05,621 --> 01:24:06,100
strokes.

3142
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:11,100
Father had a stroke when he was 67 he
smoked every day and I struck at 67 and

3143
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:14,110
then he had like a couple
heart attacks 10 years later.

3144
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:18,550
But the stroke made him be like eight
normal guy to being with a cane.

3145
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:19,061
He had to learn,

3146
01:24:19,061 --> 01:24:20,530
relearn how to walk again.

3147
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:24,790
I nanny ever since he had that
stroke was pretty miserable.

3148
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:27,220
That's all I remember him
being just bored and miserable.

3149
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,600
Well I would imagine,

3150
01:24:28,601 --> 01:24:28,841
you know,

3151
01:24:28,841 --> 01:24:30,520
your shell becomes a prison,

3152
01:24:30,521 --> 01:24:30,791
you know,

3153
01:24:30,791 --> 01:24:31,211
you can't,

3154
01:24:31,211 --> 01:24:32,800
you can't fucking get around.

3155
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:33,280
That's,

3156
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,420
that's a drag man.

3157
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:36,390
But there you are smoking,

3158
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:37,150
smoking,

3159
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:37,880
you know,

3160
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,990
you know I'm more concerned about
is my mom's been getting crazy.

3161
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:44,350
My mom gets moles removed all the
time cause they're cancerous moles.

3162
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:44,930
Oh God.

3163
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:46,090
And they found one the
other day and they're like,

3164
01:24:46,091 --> 01:24:47,110
this is really bad.

3165
01:24:47,111 --> 01:24:47,650
This is like,

3166
01:24:47,650 --> 01:24:49,360
we caught it early but this is like,

3167
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:53,920
this is cancerous and it's like near your
or spine or something weird like that.

3168
01:24:53,921 --> 01:24:54,754
And it's,

3169
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,140
and the crazy thing is,

3170
01:24:56,141 --> 01:24:56,411
it's like,

3171
01:24:56,411 --> 01:24:56,740
they're like,

3172
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:56,981
all right,

3173
01:24:56,981 --> 01:24:58,160
so we're gonna schedule you,

3174
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:58,421
you know,

3175
01:24:58,421 --> 01:24:59,980
December 14th to take it out.

3176
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:00,311
And I'm like,

3177
01:25:00,311 --> 01:25:00,791
wait a second,

3178
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:01,930
you just said it was cancer.

3179
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:03,310
Shouldn't you get that out?

3180
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:04,210
Like now?

3181
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:08,950
Like who cares if it's a slow
growing cancer immediately,

3182
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:11,590
especially because you know you
have cancer now you're freaking out.

3183
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,890
Who knows if that's going to
accelerate the growth of the thing.

3184
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:18,610
I think it's probably a
scheduling issue that probably,

3185
01:25:18,611 --> 01:25:19,080
you know,

3186
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,370
an insurance issue and a bunch
of other different things.

3187
01:25:21,371 --> 01:25:22,080
But yeah,

3188
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:22,421
a better,

3189
01:25:22,421 --> 01:25:23,171
she had a lot of money,

3190
01:25:23,171 --> 01:25:24,340
they'd probably get around immediately.

3191
01:25:24,730 --> 01:25:25,510
And my sister,

3192
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:27,520
it's just got some moles
removed for cancer and,

3193
01:25:27,521 --> 01:25:28,271
and now I'm like,

3194
01:25:28,271 --> 01:25:28,541
wait,

3195
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:30,190
I haven't been to the doctor ever.

3196
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:31,024
And I got,

3197
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:32,441
I shave.

3198
01:25:32,441 --> 01:25:32,861
I know.

3199
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:33,181
I just,

3200
01:25:33,181 --> 01:25:35,010
I you just go all the time.

3201
01:25:35,011 --> 01:25:35,320
I'm not,

3202
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,153
I hate doctors.

3203
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,260
I don't have a family doctor anymore.

3204
01:25:38,261 --> 01:25:39,110
Our family dentist,

3205
01:25:39,310 --> 01:25:43,150
I grew up with like the same doctor my
whole life and then I just moved away and

3206
01:25:43,151 --> 01:25:44,800
now I just go to like urgent cares,

3207
01:25:44,801 --> 01:25:45,011
you know,

3208
01:25:45,011 --> 01:25:47,920
I don't want to have a relationship
with a doctor and too old for that.

3209
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,660
Now when are you going back to Ohio again?

3210
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:50,440
Yeah,

3211
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:50,910
exactly.

3212
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:53,490
What is UFC coming here to hemo.

3213
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:54,611
You could,

3214
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:55,300
um,

3215
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:56,140
schedule it,

3216
01:25:56,170 --> 01:25:56,501
you know,

3217
01:25:56,501 --> 01:25:57,350
and the next time he done.

3218
01:25:57,470 --> 01:25:58,303
That's true.

3219
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:00,250
Since you liked the guy,

3220
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,660
as long as you're gonna to go here.

3221
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:02,141
And you know,

3222
01:26:02,141 --> 01:26:02,861
I noticed also,

3223
01:26:02,861 --> 01:26:04,760
I talked about this always
on Thompson as podcasts.

3224
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:05,280
We always talk,

3225
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,560
have a dental update every week.

3226
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:07,390
But I,

3227
01:26:07,390 --> 01:26:10,880
I noticed that dentists out here
also seem more like car car salesman.

3228
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:11,330
Like they,

3229
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:14,840
they're automatically trying to get you
to upgrade things when he'd go there.

3230
01:26:14,841 --> 01:26:16,920
Like the other day I went
to the dentist and they,

3231
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:17,754
they,

3232
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:19,910
they charged me for a fluoride treatment.

3233
01:26:19,911 --> 01:26:20,241
I'm like,

3234
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:21,440
I just wanted to cleaning.

3235
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,460
What's this fluoride treatment?

3236
01:26:22,461 --> 01:26:22,731
And she's like,

3237
01:26:22,731 --> 01:26:22,851
oh,

3238
01:26:22,851 --> 01:26:23,660
she didn't go through.

3239
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:24,840
That's extra.

3240
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:25,131
You know,

3241
01:26:25,131 --> 01:26:25,731
you can get it.

3242
01:26:25,731 --> 01:26:26,150
And I'm like,

3243
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:26,481
no,

3244
01:26:26,481 --> 01:26:28,610
she just gave it to me and
I didn't ask for a fluoride,

3245
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:30,670
but they were trying to
add things on like Monday,

3246
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:31,250
you know,

3247
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:31,940
like,

3248
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:32,091
like,

3249
01:26:32,091 --> 01:26:32,181
oh,

3250
01:26:32,181 --> 01:26:33,770
you got the extra warranty,

3251
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,360
tried to sell me on braces,

3252
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:36,283
braces,

3253
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:37,330
bitch.

3254
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:38,163
You know,

3255
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:40,250
my front seats are straight,

3256
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:40,730
but two,

3257
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:41,930
that would be fucking awesome.

3258
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:42,580
Can we get braces?

3259
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:44,450
Get the metal on my
front teeth are perfect,

3260
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,620
but my bottom teeth,

3261
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:47,450
there's some bunching up,

3262
01:26:48,190 --> 01:26:48,921
pretty bad ass.

3263
01:26:48,921 --> 01:26:51,590
But he said it to me and I looked at it a,

3264
01:26:51,591 --> 01:26:51,790
I'm,

3265
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:52,623
I go,

3266
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:53,600
I'm a man.

3267
01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:56,690
I don't give a fuck of
my teeth are a little,

3268
01:26:56,691 --> 01:26:57,780
can I chew through me?

3269
01:26:57,890 --> 01:26:58,070
Right.

3270
01:26:58,070 --> 01:26:58,370
Yeah,

3271
01:26:58,370 --> 01:26:59,203
they're good.

3272
01:26:59,240 --> 01:26:59,540
Well,

3273
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:01,070
it's not like they're all jacked.

3274
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,233
No,

3275
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:03,890
because they don't know.

3276
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:05,330
You don't want to be like
that old person with the wing.

3277
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:06,273
You don't feel,

3278
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:09,140
you don't get extra teeth coming
in and it gets spread out more.

3279
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:11,600
When a frank shamrock got braces,

3280
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:15,140
the former UFC champion
and he needed braces,

3281
01:27:15,141 --> 01:27:17,720
he had some weird dental thing going
on where you had like double teeth.

3282
01:27:17,750 --> 01:27:18,140
Right.

3283
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:20,740
You ever met people that have
like teeth that grow over teeth.

3284
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,540
They're like a lot of weird shit going on.

3285
01:27:22,541 --> 01:27:22,940
Right.

3286
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:23,291
So I don't,

3287
01:27:23,291 --> 01:27:24,350
I don't know what that's about,

3288
01:27:24,351 --> 01:27:25,630
but he needed braces,

3289
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:26,541
if that makes sense.

3290
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:29,690
Like I understand like you don't want
people to let go every time you smiled.

3291
01:27:29,691 --> 01:27:31,310
What the fuck is going on as well?

3292
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:32,481
You know there's certain,

3293
01:27:32,481 --> 01:27:32,691
you know,

3294
01:27:32,691 --> 01:27:36,020
you start tweaking about extra teeth
and shit starts fucking with your head.

3295
01:27:36,021 --> 01:27:36,231
You're like,

3296
01:27:36,231 --> 01:27:38,600
I don't want to get rid of some of
these goddamn teeth and fix my face.

3297
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:39,681
That makes sense.

3298
01:27:39,681 --> 01:27:43,100
But to just have a little bit of a
crooked tooth here and they're like,

3299
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:44,060
come on bitch,

3300
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:44,893
what are you worried about?

3301
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:47,780
I never understood why there's like you
see those older people or whatever that

3302
01:27:47,781 --> 01:27:50,630
has that one funky tooth that shoots out
of their mouth and they were just like,

3303
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,580
why don't you just at
least get that polled?

3304
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:53,670
You know you're,

3305
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:55,010
you're just holding onto like,

3306
01:27:55,011 --> 01:27:55,161
you know,

3307
01:27:55,161 --> 01:27:58,160
like bald people are holding onto that
and the last amount of hair and trying to

3308
01:27:58,161 --> 01:27:58,860
comb it over,

3309
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:00,950
move it around the circle with a fuck.

3310
01:28:00,951 --> 01:28:02,360
If you get that shit,

3311
01:28:02,361 --> 01:28:02,920
take it.

3312
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:04,580
There's right writer
took all his teeth out.

3313
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:05,570
Oh God.

3314
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:06,470
All of his teeth.

3315
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:07,971
He just drank.

3316
01:28:07,971 --> 01:28:08,810
I think I've talked about this before.

3317
01:28:08,830 --> 01:28:10,640
He always drinks like mountain dew.

3318
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:14,900
Like you drink like a 12 pack of mountain
dew a day and his teeth were so bad he

3319
01:28:14,901 --> 01:28:16,450
never went to the dentist
cause you're gonna you know,

3320
01:28:16,451 --> 01:28:17,930
whatever for whatever reason.

3321
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:18,621
And they were like,

3322
01:28:18,621 --> 01:28:18,801
dude,

3323
01:28:18,801 --> 01:28:19,730
all your teeth are fucked.

3324
01:28:19,731 --> 01:28:20,150
And he's like,

3325
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:20,360
ah,

3326
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:21,050
just pull them all.

3327
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:22,340
Oh my God.

3328
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:23,390
Pull them all.

3329
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:24,950
It would cause the food.

3330
01:28:24,951 --> 01:28:25,080
Well,

3331
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:27,430
he has fake teeth now like ventures,

3332
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:29,320
but you know it's like the,

3333
01:28:29,321 --> 01:28:31,790
the cost to fix it all was impossible.

3334
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:32,450
You know.

3335
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:33,350
Oh my God,

3336
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:35,390
like $20,000 something like Oh my God.

3337
01:28:35,391 --> 01:28:35,721
So,

3338
01:28:35,721 --> 01:28:38,810
so he has like basically
like the whole denture thing,

3339
01:28:38,811 --> 01:28:41,720
like a plastic gum and
you stick it on with glue.

3340
01:28:42,180 --> 01:28:44,100
Like they have like the Polident shit.

3341
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:45,700
You ever see those commercials were like,

3342
01:28:45,701 --> 01:28:45,900
look,

3343
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:50,050
your dentures can stay even under water
and they'd take a glass and they blew

3344
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:53,180
the fucking fake teeth to it
and they put it under water.

3345
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:56,690
Drink your water and not worried
about your two falling out.

3346
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:58,640
That's so dark man.

3347
01:28:58,760 --> 01:28:59,181
When you,

3348
01:28:59,181 --> 01:29:01,200
when you have your whole
mouth full of fake teeth,

3349
01:29:01,201 --> 01:29:01,800
that's dark.

3350
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,633
Yeah.

3351
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:03,720
I had a friend who had no teeth.

3352
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:04,960
My friend Mal Vernon,

3353
01:29:04,961 --> 01:29:05,280
Tommy,

3354
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,180
he had no fucking teeth for Vernon.

3355
01:29:07,210 --> 01:29:08,270
Tom Over at Tommy.

3356
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:08,401
Yeah.

3357
01:29:08,401 --> 01:29:10,430
He was a pool hustler
from white plains for,

3358
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:11,131
for Mount Vernon.

3359
01:29:11,131 --> 01:29:11,491
But you know,

3360
01:29:11,491 --> 01:29:14,210
he used to come by executive
billiards in white plains new year.

3361
01:29:14,211 --> 01:29:15,900
The a certain weird dog and the need,

3362
01:29:15,901 --> 01:29:17,100
you didn't them any teeth.

3363
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:20,760
He had no teeth when he wanted
a good little Philemon Yoan.

3364
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:22,890
And what I do is I put it in the blender,

3365
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:27,750
puts a Philemon yawn in the blender so
that he could just fucking buzz it down

3366
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:28,584
and then eat it.

3367
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:30,990
Sort of like how I make my
smoothie with Kale and shit.

3368
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,370
He would do that with steak.

3369
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:36,420
He would buzz up steak in a blender and
then eat them like this poor fuck he's

3370
01:29:36,421 --> 01:29:37,770
got no goddamn teeth.

3371
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:38,770
Yeah,

3372
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:39,120
it was,

3373
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:39,720
he had,

3374
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,690
I met some crazy fucking
people in my pool hall days,

3375
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:44,370
but he was one of the craziest,

3376
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,630
really nice guy.

3377
01:29:46,050 --> 01:29:47,100
Great Pool Player,

3378
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:50,010
but terrible organizer of his life.

3379
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:53,800
And what he did was he would
work for a taxi dispatch and a,

3380
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:55,860
he would work like ridiculous,

3381
01:29:55,861 --> 01:29:56,970
ridiculous hours,

3382
01:29:57,150 --> 01:30:00,120
get enough money together and
then go play pool with it.

3383
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:01,080
And gamble is money.

3384
01:30:01,081 --> 01:30:04,740
I mean he has a guy that was probably
only making a few hundred bucks a week.

3385
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:05,101
Right.

3386
01:30:05,101 --> 01:30:05,641
And he would,

3387
01:30:05,641 --> 01:30:06,120
you know,

3388
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:08,190
regularly come in and you know,

3389
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:12,510
gamble for a couple thousand bucks and
sometimes he would lose and when he would

3390
01:30:12,511 --> 01:30:13,080
lose,

3391
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:17,130
then he would go into debt with what's
called a Shylock and want a Shylock is,

3392
01:30:17,131 --> 01:30:17,550
is uh,

3393
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:18,900
essentially a gangster,

3394
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:19,290
a,

3395
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:23,070
a person who loans you money and
they learn you loan you cash when you

3396
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:28,080
ordinarily can't get alone and they do
it at a ridiculous rates of interest and

3397
01:30:28,081 --> 01:30:28,231
you know,

3398
01:30:28,231 --> 01:30:31,260
you have to play pay points
and he would fucking,

3399
01:30:31,590 --> 01:30:33,600
he would go into debt with these guys,

3400
01:30:33,690 --> 01:30:35,070
owe them like fucking,

3401
01:30:35,071 --> 01:30:35,311
you know,

3402
01:30:35,311 --> 01:30:36,180
20 grand,

3403
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:36,730
10 grand,

3404
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:37,650
whatever the fuck it is.

3405
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,000
And this poor guy would just disappear
for months and just work it off,

3406
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:46,380
just disappear and then go
right back into the hole again.

3407
01:30:46,381 --> 01:30:46,950
Same thing,

3408
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:48,320
come gum back and,

3409
01:30:48,321 --> 01:30:52,980
and get alone and [inaudible]
to get alone and play some,

3410
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,990
a lot of people talking a little shit,

3411
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:57,000
I'm going to come back and play some,

3412
01:30:57,180 --> 01:30:58,740
show him how to fucking do it.

3413
01:30:58,770 --> 01:30:58,951
You know,

3414
01:30:58,951 --> 01:31:02,160
they don't have good cue ball control
and he would like tell you why he was

3415
01:31:02,161 --> 01:31:03,470
going to win and control.

3416
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:04,321
You knew,

3417
01:31:04,321 --> 01:31:06,270
you knew the chances are that
he's probably going to lose.

3418
01:31:06,271 --> 01:31:08,610
It was going to be the same fucking
thing over and over again eventually.

3419
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:09,361
You know,

3420
01:31:09,361 --> 01:31:10,000
it's like you,

3421
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:10,231
you're,

3422
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:10,501
you're,

3423
01:31:10,501 --> 01:31:11,670
you're running,

3424
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:12,691
you're always,

3425
01:31:12,691 --> 01:31:13,860
always behind.

3426
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:14,201
You know,

3427
01:31:14,201 --> 01:31:16,020
the expression always
behind the eight ball.

3428
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:18,270
It just fucking can't quite catch a break.

3429
01:31:18,510 --> 01:31:20,760
And I watched this guy
and I learned a lot.

3430
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:21,360
You know,

3431
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:24,540
you learn a lot from people that are out
of control in their life about what's

3432
01:31:24,541 --> 01:31:25,141
possible.

3433
01:31:25,141 --> 01:31:26,910
Like the justifications,

3434
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:27,601
you know,

3435
01:31:27,601 --> 01:31:31,500
like when you see people addicted
to gambling or addicted to anything,

3436
01:31:31,870 --> 01:31:32,030
you know,

3437
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:32,341
you can,

3438
01:31:32,341 --> 01:31:36,480
you can watch people with their
control of life slips away.

3439
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:37,830
And it's fascinating to watch.

3440
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:38,664
You know,

3441
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:41,460
I never been around gamblers
until I started playing pool.

3442
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,860
Do you know anybody that's a gambler?

3443
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:48,060
I know card players and it's kind of sad
and depressing because it's all about

3444
01:31:48,061 --> 01:31:48,570
luck,

3445
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:49,021
you know?

3446
01:31:49,021 --> 01:31:52,750
And then sometimes they're like on top
of the game and then other times you,

3447
01:31:52,751 --> 01:31:54,570
you just see them like are suffering.

3448
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:56,720
Like they're fucking
selling shit and just,

3449
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:58,380
well it's certainly
not totally about luck,

3450
01:31:58,381 --> 01:31:59,480
but luck plays a in that.

3451
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:00,191
Yeah,

3452
01:32:00,191 --> 01:32:01,750
for the most part it plays a part.

3453
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:02,620
You definitely,

3454
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:04,180
when you have guys have equal skill,

3455
01:32:04,210 --> 01:32:04,631
then yeah,

3456
01:32:04,631 --> 01:32:06,840
luck certainly plays a part
when the game was at uno,

3457
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:07,683
so it was mostly water

3458
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:10,010
hooked on,

3459
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:10,770
you know,

3460
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:11,260
I'm like,

3461
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:11,980
what?

3462
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:16,780
Because Ari is a pretty successful at
poker and he does it through strategy and

3463
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:18,190
his intellect and his discipline.

3464
01:32:18,191 --> 01:32:18,391
He's,

3465
01:32:18,391 --> 01:32:19,330
he's a good poker player,

3466
01:32:19,331 --> 01:32:19,481
man.

3467
01:32:19,481 --> 01:32:20,300
He makes money.

3468
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:23,560
There was a lot of times where he's making
way more money playing poker than he

3469
01:32:23,561 --> 01:32:24,550
was doing comedy,

3470
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:27,610
but I think that shit's kinda dried up to,

3471
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:28,473
I think it's hard.

3472
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:32,200
The Internet apparently just
festered infested with bots.

3473
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:37,570
There was a guy who was a on one of
these a pool websites and he's a pretty

3474
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:42,850
pretty knowledgeable dude and he was
talking about how it's useless to play

3475
01:32:42,851 --> 01:32:45,970
poker on these websites
because they're all there.

3476
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:46,960
They're like,

3477
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:48,130
when you get on a website,

3478
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,770
you might be playing in
a room with five people,

3479
01:32:50,771 --> 01:32:53,130
but two of them might
be bots and that might,

3480
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:56,110
they might be bots set forward by the,

3481
01:32:56,140 --> 01:32:56,860
um,

3482
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:57,101
the,

3483
01:32:57,101 --> 01:32:59,560
the poker company and you can't beat them.

3484
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:00,551
And they're,

3485
01:33:00,551 --> 01:33:01,960
they're computer programs.

3486
01:33:01,961 --> 01:33:02,530
They're running,

3487
01:33:02,530 --> 01:33:03,190
it's cheating,

3488
01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:03,700
you're cheating.

3489
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:06,910
And they're essentially running up the
bents and making people bet more money

3490
01:33:06,911 --> 01:33:08,320
and Boston people.

3491
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:08,951
And it's like,

3492
01:33:08,951 --> 01:33:11,200
maybe it could just be you and some of
the guy who doesn't know how to play

3493
01:33:11,201 --> 01:33:12,910
poker and you could
make some fucking money,

3494
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:13,451
but no,

3495
01:33:13,451 --> 01:33:13,631
no,

3496
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:14,464
no,

3497
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:14,921
no.

3498
01:33:14,921 --> 01:33:17,980
It's you and some other guy who doesn't
know how to play poker and bots.

3499
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,070
You're not going to win fucking crazy man.

3500
01:33:21,071 --> 01:33:22,330
When you hear about shit like that.

3501
01:33:22,510 --> 01:33:23,171
And then those,

3502
01:33:23,171 --> 01:33:23,290
uh,

3503
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:24,580
which guys got busted recently,

3504
01:33:24,581 --> 01:33:25,660
they've gotten a lot of big,

3505
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:26,381
big trouble.

3506
01:33:26,381 --> 01:33:26,501
They,

3507
01:33:26,501 --> 01:33:26,951
oh Bruce.

3508
01:33:26,951 --> 01:33:27,501
Buffer money.

3509
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:28,470
And there was a bunch of your time.

3510
01:33:28,910 --> 01:33:29,890
We'll all start put,

3511
01:33:29,891 --> 01:33:30,190
what is it?

3512
01:33:30,190 --> 01:33:31,810
The one that's always on people's backs,

3513
01:33:31,811 --> 01:33:32,021
right?

3514
01:33:32,021 --> 01:33:32,950
And what the fuck is it called?

3515
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:34,090
Fuck what's which,

3516
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:37,900
which do search poker scandal.

3517
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:41,500
Full tilt,

3518
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:42,460
full tilt poker.

3519
01:33:42,550 --> 01:33:42,881
Yeah.

3520
01:33:42,881 --> 01:33:44,320
Apparently these guys just,

3521
01:33:44,321 --> 01:33:48,610
they had a bunch of money that they
kept their like in a bank and these

3522
01:33:48,611 --> 01:33:49,900
motherfuckers are spent it.

3523
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:52,180
They just,

3524
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:56,350
they ripped off online players
to the tune of 444 million bucks.

3525
01:33:58,720 --> 01:33:59,920
Holy Shit.

3526
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:01,450
That's amazing.

3527
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:02,980
And these guys,

3528
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:04,420
well there were poker players there.

3529
01:34:04,421 --> 01:34:05,320
This is who started it,

3530
01:34:05,410 --> 01:34:07,750
the Department of Justice
specifically named pros,

3531
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:12,960
Howard Lederer and Chris Ferguson who
were the founders of the site back in 2004

3532
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:14,520
in the scheme,

3533
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:14,681
uh,

3534
01:34:14,681 --> 01:34:18,700
the amount of poker pros who are involved
with full tilt is hard to ignore.

3535
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:20,890
So they don't know really how
many people were involved.

3536
01:34:20,891 --> 01:34:21,970
But these guys,

3537
01:34:21,971 --> 01:34:22,420
uh,

3538
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:22,740
they,

3539
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:26,110
they just made mad loot
stealing from people.

3540
01:34:26,590 --> 01:34:29,050
That's how the world of the Gambler,

3541
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,070
the pool player,

3542
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:31,660
poker player,

3543
01:34:31,661 --> 01:34:31,971
like the,

3544
01:34:31,971 --> 01:34:32,071
the,

3545
01:34:32,071 --> 01:34:33,910
the dice player people,

3546
01:34:33,911 --> 01:34:35,060
the world of the Gambler,

3547
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:40,200
w just to the cold war with CD people
to try to make this legitimate like what

3548
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:42,370
they're trying to do
now with all this crazy,

3549
01:34:42,371 --> 01:34:42,551
you know,

3550
01:34:42,551 --> 01:34:45,580
professional poker and shit that
didn't exist when I was in high school.

3551
01:34:45,850 --> 01:34:46,101
What,

3552
01:34:46,101 --> 01:34:46,780
what this is,

3553
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:48,090
is like they're doing,

3554
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:50,440
as they're cleaning up degenerates,

3555
01:34:50,590 --> 01:34:51,311
they're cleaning up,

3556
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:53,230
degenerates and presenting
them to the American public.

3557
01:34:53,231 --> 01:34:54,220
But these are degenerates.

3558
01:34:54,490 --> 01:34:55,130
Even if they're,

3559
01:34:55,130 --> 01:34:57,530
they're really rich and
successful and at it,

3560
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:58,790
at their core,

3561
01:34:58,940 --> 01:34:59,270
they're,

3562
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:01,130
most of them were degenerate gamblers.

3563
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:01,780
And those are,

3564
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:02,750
those people are crazy.

3565
01:35:02,751 --> 01:35:03,421
Those people did not.

3566
01:35:03,421 --> 01:35:03,801
He Shit,

3567
01:35:03,801 --> 01:35:04,340
man.

3568
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:06,950
There's a certain percentage of them
that are off their fucking rocker.

3569
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:10,190
That's why they've wound up
as professional gamblers.

3570
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:10,491
You know,

3571
01:35:10,491 --> 01:35:10,671
they're,

3572
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:14,790
they're junkies for adrenaline and
craziness and their impulse people and are

3573
01:35:14,791 --> 01:35:17,600
people that are willing to
take ridiculous chances.

3574
01:35:17,601 --> 01:35:17,841
You know,

3575
01:35:17,841 --> 01:35:18,080
there's,

3576
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,260
there's a lot of nuttiness to the
world of the professional gambler.

3577
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:22,310
I've never been a gambler.

3578
01:35:22,311 --> 01:35:23,720
I never had that in me at all.

3579
01:35:23,721 --> 01:35:24,170
I can't,

3580
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:25,340
I don't like making bets.

3581
01:35:25,341 --> 01:35:26,360
And once in a while in Vegas,

3582
01:35:26,361 --> 01:35:26,781
I'll do it.

3583
01:35:26,781 --> 01:35:27,180
Like I'll,

3584
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:27,500
I'll,

3585
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:27,921
I'll just,

3586
01:35:27,921 --> 01:35:28,754
cause I not,

3587
01:35:28,790 --> 01:35:31,670
I don't get to do that
ever unless I'm in Vegas.

3588
01:35:31,671 --> 01:35:32,900
So once in a while I would spend like,

3589
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:33,291
you know,

3590
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:34,490
like 100 bucks Max,

3591
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:34,791
you know,

3592
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:35,930
but not really.

3593
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:37,040
It's a scary,

3594
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,280
you never going to win.

3595
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:38,770
You mean what?

3596
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:40,100
You went a little bit here and there,

3597
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:41,980
but God damn you can lose a fuckload.

3598
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:42,440
Yeah,

3599
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:44,780
the pool players fuck themselves.

3600
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:45,740
When it came to gambling,

3601
01:35:46,190 --> 01:35:46,670
they uh,

3602
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:51,030
there was only one time that the
casino put a line on a pool tournament.

3603
01:35:51,031 --> 01:35:52,100
It was the US Open.

3604
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:52,851
And you know,

3605
01:35:52,851 --> 01:35:56,480
when a a casino puts a
line on a pool tournament,

3606
01:35:56,570 --> 01:35:57,020
uh,

3607
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:59,150
essentially they're saying
this guy's the favorite.

3608
01:35:59,151 --> 01:36:00,380
This guy's the big underdog.

3609
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:01,760
And the big underdog was like,

3610
01:36:01,761 --> 01:36:01,940
you know,

3611
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:05,660
40 to one or where the fuck it was
was Mike Lebron and Mike Bronze.

3612
01:36:05,661 --> 01:36:06,441
A good player.

3613
01:36:06,441 --> 01:36:09,620
But he's not like the best
players like Earl Strickland,

3614
01:36:09,621 --> 01:36:10,341
Johnny Archer,

3615
01:36:10,341 --> 01:36:10,641
those are,

3616
01:36:10,641 --> 01:36:13,850
those are the guys that everybody
assumed were probably Mike Segal.

3617
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:14,481
Those are the guys.

3618
01:36:14,481 --> 01:36:17,120
Everybody assumed we're going
to get to the top buddy hall.

3619
01:36:17,121 --> 01:36:18,260
Those are like the real names.

3620
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:18,621
Well,

3621
01:36:18,621 --> 01:36:20,570
they all dumped to this
Michael Lebron guy.

3622
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:21,613
They all went,

3623
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:22,870
they all went to the fucking,

3624
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:24,500
the gambling booth.

3625
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:27,950
They bet all their money
on Michael Lebron to win.

3626
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:29,000
And then everybody lost him.

3627
01:36:29,001 --> 01:36:29,191
Mike,

3628
01:36:29,191 --> 01:36:29,661
Lebron,

3629
01:36:29,661 --> 01:36:31,980
and they all went cleaned up and then the,

3630
01:36:31,990 --> 01:36:32,823
the casino was like,

3631
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:35,860
you mother fuckers like you,

3632
01:36:35,861 --> 01:36:36,694
you fucking,

3633
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:37,783
but,

3634
01:36:38,630 --> 01:36:39,380
and you know,

3635
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:40,213
what can they say?

3636
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:40,741
I mean you,

3637
01:36:40,741 --> 01:36:40,911
you,

3638
01:36:40,911 --> 01:36:43,670
you can't leave a cat in a room with
a mouse and expect him not to kill it.

3639
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:45,140
It's just the way it is.

3640
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:45,431
They're,

3641
01:36:45,431 --> 01:36:46,430
they're degenerates.

3642
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:49,550
The things you can help
it to them first place,

3643
01:36:49,700 --> 01:36:50,091
you know,

3644
01:36:50,091 --> 01:36:51,890
at a good pool tournament and Seton home.

3645
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,260
Back then it might've
been like seven grand.

3646
01:36:54,261 --> 01:36:54,960
It might've been like,

3647
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:57,020
if it was a big tournament and my us open,

3648
01:36:57,021 --> 01:36:58,580
it's like 40 or 50 back.

3649
01:36:58,630 --> 01:36:59,151
Who knows?

3650
01:36:59,151 --> 01:37:00,860
If it was 20 or 30 whatever it was,

3651
01:37:01,070 --> 01:37:02,690
$30,000 is a big score,

3652
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:06,020
but you're not short of winning.

3653
01:37:06,230 --> 01:37:06,980
If you're going up,

3654
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:08,060
you're playing a pool tournament.

3655
01:37:08,061 --> 01:37:09,560
It's a double elimination tournament.

3656
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:12,650
You lose once to Johnny Archer and
then another time to Earl Strickland.

3657
01:37:12,651 --> 01:37:13,310
You're out.

3658
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:15,410
You can do that or you
just put all your money.

3659
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:17,270
I'm like Lebron and everybody
gets together and say,

3660
01:37:17,271 --> 01:37:18,290
let's make a deal.

3661
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:19,310
I'm not going to button.

3662
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:22,430
I bet a dollar make 40 isn't
hard to fucking figure out folks.

3663
01:37:22,431 --> 01:37:23,264
It's pull our money.

3664
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:24,680
We've got 1000 bucks,

3665
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:26,540
we're going to make $42,000 right now.

3666
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:27,440
Split that shit up.

3667
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:27,740
No,

3668
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:28,011
no,

3669
01:37:28,011 --> 01:37:29,120
no drama whatsoever.

3670
01:37:29,121 --> 01:37:29,930
Let's do it.

3671
01:37:29,930 --> 01:37:32,210
And so they all got together
and everybody bet on this guy.

3672
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:35,330
And then the casinos never
gambled on pool again.

3673
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:35,740
They were like,

3674
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:35,910
well,

3675
01:37:35,910 --> 01:37:36,860
we're not stupid.

3676
01:37:37,220 --> 01:37:37,640
You know,

3677
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:38,750
it's not like you can't,

3678
01:37:38,751 --> 01:37:40,340
it's not like basketball.

3679
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:41,390
Whereas like you know,

3680
01:37:41,391 --> 01:37:42,620
there's a lot of money and winning.

3681
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:43,700
It's not like boxing.

3682
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:46,820
I don't know if there's any fighters
that are going to put money down on

3683
01:37:46,821 --> 01:37:48,320
themselves and then take a dive.

3684
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:51,590
Maybe they would if it was the end of
their career and they can be assured that

3685
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:52,610
they can make a lot of money.

3686
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:57,940
That was always a big speculation about
Marvin because Marvin Hagler lost his

3687
01:37:58,201 --> 01:37:59,640
last fight to sugar ray Leonard,

3688
01:37:59,641 --> 01:38:03,360
where he was a big favorite to win that
fight and it didn't look like the same.

3689
01:38:03,361 --> 01:38:04,111
Marvin Hagler.

3690
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:04,944
It didn't look like,

3691
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:06,720
like when he got sugary against the ropes,

3692
01:38:06,721 --> 01:38:08,210
didn't look like it was
really punishing them.

3693
01:38:08,211 --> 01:38:09,930
It didn't really look like
he was trying to stop him.

3694
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:13,800
It was almost like he knew that the fix
was in and he was a part of it because

3695
01:38:13,801 --> 01:38:14,850
after it was over,

3696
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:15,121
I mean,

3697
01:38:15,121 --> 01:38:15,630
and I'm just,

3698
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:15,841
look,

3699
01:38:15,841 --> 01:38:17,760
Marvin Hagler is one of the
greatest boxers of all time.

3700
01:38:17,761 --> 01:38:18,481
I'm not implying,

3701
01:38:18,481 --> 01:38:19,650
I'm just going with the urban legend.

3702
01:38:19,980 --> 01:38:21,060
After it was over,

3703
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:24,480
he leaves and goes to
Italy and makes movies.

3704
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:27,600
He becomes an Italian
movie star just leaves.

3705
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:30,180
So like if he made some
sort of a deal with the mob

3706
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:30,841
and they're like,

3707
01:38:30,841 --> 01:38:31,091
listen,

3708
01:38:31,091 --> 01:38:31,831
this is what I'm gonna do.

3709
01:38:31,831 --> 01:38:33,470
I'm going to bet a lot of
money on a sugar ray Leonard.

3710
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:34,061
You will knock,

3711
01:38:34,061 --> 01:38:35,760
knock 'em out and you leave them alone.

3712
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,280
The judges are in the bucket to
going to make a lot of money.

3713
01:38:38,281 --> 01:38:39,050
Come to Italy.

3714
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:39,960
[inaudible] star.

3715
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:43,380
Fuck this box saying you want
to be a movie star in Italy.

3716
01:38:43,381 --> 01:38:44,730
So they taught them Italian,

3717
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:45,990
flew him out to Italy.

3718
01:38:46,130 --> 01:38:47,700
He would give him a fucking movie star.

3719
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:48,670
It's that's those,

3720
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:49,280
the urban,

3721
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:50,280
that's the urban legend.

3722
01:38:50,730 --> 01:38:53,370
The reality is one of the
greatest boxers of all time.

3723
01:38:53,371 --> 01:38:54,204
Marvin Hagler,

3724
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:55,770
huge Marvin Hagler Fan.

3725
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:57,450
He was a monster man.

3726
01:38:57,451 --> 01:38:58,380
I remember when I was a kid,

3727
01:38:58,590 --> 01:38:59,101
I watched him,

3728
01:38:59,101 --> 01:39:02,700
he was training from a staff of ham show
and they had him on the news cause he

3729
01:39:02,701 --> 01:39:03,030
was,

3730
01:39:03,030 --> 01:39:03,450
he was,

3731
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:04,680
what he would do is on the Cape,

3732
01:39:04,681 --> 01:39:05,790
he would live on Cape Cod,

3733
01:39:05,791 --> 01:39:07,650
which is the ocean that
nobody went to in the winter.

3734
01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:09,090
God was fucking frigid,

3735
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:09,661
you know,

3736
01:39:09,661 --> 01:39:13,500
it's zero degrees and the waves would be
crashing and the wind would be whipping

3737
01:39:13,501 --> 01:39:15,120
in the fucking windshield factor was like,

3738
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:18,750
who knows how many fucking degrees below
zero and this motherfucker would be

3739
01:39:18,751 --> 01:39:20,940
running on the beach screaming war.

3740
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:24,600
You know Marvin Hagler like I remember
watching it on TV when I was a little kid

3741
01:39:24,601 --> 01:39:24,811
going,

3742
01:39:24,811 --> 01:39:25,920
Holy Shit,

3743
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:27,180
look at this guy.

3744
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:28,320
Like that was in my mind,

3745
01:39:28,321 --> 01:39:29,940
like that's what a fighter could be.

3746
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:30,540
Like.

3747
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:34,590
The scariest fighter would be a fighter
that's doing everything correctly.

3748
01:39:34,591 --> 01:39:36,240
100% focus,

3749
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:37,830
100% dedicated,

3750
01:39:37,831 --> 01:39:39,270
stays away from his wife,

3751
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,920
doesn't go anywhere near as kids,

3752
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:45,960
locks himself in a fucking house on the
beach and just works out every day and

3753
01:39:45,961 --> 01:39:48,760
runs on the beach and just wants
to kill you and can't wait.

3754
01:39:48,761 --> 01:39:52,290
And it's counting the days down for he
gets to punch you in the fucking face,

3755
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:53,573
you know?

3756
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:55,560
So I'm not saying that
Marvin Hagler took a dive,

3757
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:57,360
but I'm saying that that's the rumor.

3758
01:39:59,970 --> 01:40:01,410
This is going to be a fun UFC man.

3759
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:02,273
You gotta start,

3760
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:03,041
when's the next year?

3761
01:40:03,041 --> 01:40:03,751
I've said you're going to come to,

3762
01:40:03,751 --> 01:40:04,560
you want to come to San Jose?

3763
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:05,393
San Jose.

3764
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:07,590
We've got some shows there too.

3765
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:08,770
We're doing a,

3766
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:09,603
when is that?

3767
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:11,070
During the San Jose Improv.

3768
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:11,540
When is that?

3769
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:12,960
Do you know what number?

3770
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,073
Uh,

3771
01:40:14,670 --> 01:40:15,870
cause it on my little calendar,

3772
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,510
I guess November 18th,

3773
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:20,190
we're going to be at
the San Jose and Improv.

3774
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:22,860
It's a Joey Diaz is coming now.

3775
01:40:22,861 --> 01:40:24,810
We just found out that
Brian is coming as well.

3776
01:40:24,811 --> 01:40:25,840
I Dunno who else to come in.

3777
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,560
We might have one other comic con,

3778
01:40:27,561 --> 01:40:29,490
maybe Dunkin or whoever's around.

3779
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:29,941
And,

3780
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:30,774
uh,

3781
01:40:30,810 --> 01:40:31,560
then we got the,

3782
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:32,880
the two shows at the,

3783
01:40:32,881 --> 01:40:33,714
um,

3784
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:35,100
at the San Jose Improv that night.

3785
01:40:35,101 --> 01:40:36,480
And then the UFC is the
next night and it's a,

3786
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:37,081
it's a killer.

3787
01:40:37,081 --> 01:40:37,651
UFC too.

3788
01:40:37,651 --> 01:40:41,520
It's Vandelay Silva versus Conley
and Shogun versus Henderson.

3789
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:43,260
It's got a nice fucking nuts.

3790
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:44,280
That's a good one.

3791
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:44,581
God,

3792
01:40:44,581 --> 01:40:46,160
I hope nobody gets hurt
before that one comes.

3793
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,033
I get right.

3794
01:40:47,090 --> 01:40:48,090
It kind of sucks.

3795
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:49,230
That was sports crazy.

3796
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:49,590
You know,

3797
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:50,140
when you're,

3798
01:40:50,140 --> 01:40:53,710
when you got to practice kicking the
shit out of each other and punching each

3799
01:40:53,711 --> 01:40:55,540
other and need each other
in the face and Shit,

3800
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:56,230
man,

3801
01:40:56,230 --> 01:40:57,063
people get hurt.

3802
01:40:57,070 --> 01:40:57,341
You know,

3803
01:40:57,341 --> 01:40:58,510
you tweaked knees.

3804
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:58,871
Look,

3805
01:40:58,871 --> 01:40:59,681
even George Saint Pierre,

3806
01:40:59,681 --> 01:41:03,580
man George has never pulled
out with a knee injury before.

3807
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:03,940
I mean,

3808
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:05,770
I think he's hurt himself in the past.

3809
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,290
I can't remember him pulling out
a fight cell because he was hurt.

3810
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:09,550
Maybe I'm wrong.

3811
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:10,541
I know he,

3812
01:41:10,541 --> 01:41:10,810
uh,

3813
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:11,140
he,

3814
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:14,860
he has been injured like
after he fought Tiago Alvarez.

3815
01:41:14,861 --> 01:41:14,961
He,

3816
01:41:14,961 --> 01:41:18,340
he was laid up for a while because he
fucked as growing up in that fight.

3817
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:22,840
But I can't remember other injuries
where he had to pull out of a fight.

3818
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:23,770
I might be wrong though.

3819
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,000
So many guys do.

3820
01:41:25,001 --> 01:41:27,040
It's just no way around it man.

3821
01:41:27,041 --> 01:41:28,360
And I hate it.

3822
01:41:28,570 --> 01:41:30,490
But it's a smart thing to do.

3823
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:31,271
You got to pull out,

3824
01:41:31,271 --> 01:41:32,380
you can't fight injured,

3825
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:33,630
you know you fight injured,

3826
01:41:33,631 --> 01:41:34,361
you get fucked up,

3827
01:41:34,361 --> 01:41:37,270
you fight Carlos condit and
you only got one wing do.

3828
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,350
You might get jacked.

3829
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,180
That guy's a beast if you can barely,

3830
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,680
you know you can't move right.

3831
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:42,580
And if you get hurts,

3832
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:46,510
if it gets hurt more like during the
fight and you like try to dig in on it and

3833
01:41:46,511 --> 01:41:47,560
move a certain direction,

3834
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:50,410
maybe you can't move and you get hit with
a kick you would've never got hit with

3835
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,960
and then it's lights out and
then your whole career changes.

3836
01:41:52,961 --> 01:41:53,920
Your whole life changes.

3837
01:41:53,921 --> 01:41:57,400
Like at that level of
the game you can't do it.

3838
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:02,200
But I seen dudes fight hurt before Mike
[inaudible] was the biggest example.

3839
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:03,550
He's a real tough guy.

3840
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:05,260
And he came into the UFC once,

3841
01:42:05,261 --> 01:42:10,261
he fought a CBD Holloway and he came in
with his whole leg taped up like a cast.

3842
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:11,860
It was fucking nuts.

3843
01:42:11,861 --> 01:42:13,180
Like Soccer Raba style.

3844
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:15,850
Have you ever saw Sakuraba
back in the old pride days?

3845
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:17,500
Sakharova was amazing fighter,

3846
01:42:17,501 --> 01:42:19,900
but his knees were fucked up.

3847
01:42:20,170 --> 01:42:23,410
He just had been leg locked too
many times and kick too many times.

3848
01:42:23,411 --> 01:42:26,800
They were just badly damaged
so bad that he would get these,

3849
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:30,040
his legs taped up before
the fights and it was nuts.

3850
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:30,910
It was like a mummy.

3851
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:35,470
I mean it was like he was like from
halfway down to is the the to his calf all

3852
01:42:35,471 --> 01:42:38,350
the way up to like a foot above his knee.

3853
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:39,520
It was all taped up.

3854
01:42:39,521 --> 01:42:40,570
It was like crazy.

3855
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:43,600
But he had to do that and he
would like walk like an old man,

3856
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:44,081
you know,

3857
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:46,480
you had to do that and then you'd go
in and kick you with that same leg.

3858
01:42:46,710 --> 01:42:51,710
Fucking he like stabilize his own knees
with tape and raps because it was like

3859
01:42:52,481 --> 01:42:53,860
old loose and fucked up.

3860
01:42:53,890 --> 01:42:54,550
You know,

3861
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:56,320
it was really one of the
reasons why people loved him.

3862
01:42:56,321 --> 01:42:58,870
They knew he's all battered up and he
was still going there and go fucking

3863
01:42:58,871 --> 01:42:59,650
crazy.

3864
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:00,640
But it's really not smart.

3865
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:02,210
It's really not smart to fight injury,

3866
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:02,400
you know?

3867
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,233
And you're supposed to,

3868
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:03,940
if you like,

3869
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:05,410
you look at a guy like
George Saint Pierre,

3870
01:43:05,411 --> 01:43:07,120
he does everything perfectly.

3871
01:43:07,121 --> 01:43:10,570
It's very technical and he
wants to always be able to,

3872
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:11,141
you know,

3873
01:43:11,141 --> 01:43:13,330
avoid getting hit but hit the other guy.

3874
01:43:13,331 --> 01:43:16,000
He wants to always be able to
utilize the right strategy.

3875
01:43:16,001 --> 01:43:18,760
And if you got a fucked up wheel man,

3876
01:43:18,761 --> 01:43:20,240
if your knee is jack,

3877
01:43:20,241 --> 01:43:20,830
that's like,

3878
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:23,350
that's a good percent of his whole game.

3879
01:43:23,770 --> 01:43:27,430
So game is about exploding on people
and getting out of the way of people and

3880
01:43:27,431 --> 01:43:30,790
making sure people can't take them down
and making sure he can take them down

3881
01:43:30,791 --> 01:43:31,810
and then kicking them.

3882
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,090
You know,

3883
01:43:32,090 --> 01:43:32,230
there's,

3884
01:43:32,230 --> 01:43:35,290
that's his whole game kicking and
punching him and taking him down and like,

3885
01:43:35,291 --> 01:43:36,610
fuck you can't kick somebody.

3886
01:43:36,611 --> 01:43:37,000
You can't,

3887
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:38,110
you can't run out of the way.

3888
01:43:38,111 --> 01:43:38,680
You can't,

3889
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:39,220
you know?

3890
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:41,290
That's a terrifying thing
for a fighter to have.

3891
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:42,670
Only one need at works.

3892
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:44,830
What a fucking Dudee sport,

3893
01:43:44,831 --> 01:43:45,430
dude.

3894
01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:48,970
You take your body and you try to
blast someone else's body with it.

3895
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:50,930
No thanks.

3896
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:51,420
Yeah,

3897
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:52,253
it's crazy.

3898
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:54,440
You get exhausted,

3899
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:55,641
you know,

3900
01:43:55,641 --> 01:43:58,340
and everybody's just trying to figure
out the right way to do it and no one's

3901
01:43:58,341 --> 01:43:59,990
quite got it mastered yet.

3902
01:44:00,410 --> 01:44:03,800
They've only got it mastered against this
level and we're always looking at the

3903
01:44:03,801 --> 01:44:04,910
next level coming up.

3904
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:06,500
Like even though Anderson Silva is,

3905
01:44:06,501 --> 01:44:07,550
no doubt about it,

3906
01:44:07,551 --> 01:44:09,980
the greatest fighter that ever
walked the face of the earth,

3907
01:44:10,190 --> 01:44:11,690
there's nobody that's ever been better.

3908
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:14,090
No one has ever done the kind
of shit that that guy does.

3909
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:15,320
I'll give you look at his fight,

3910
01:44:15,321 --> 01:44:16,550
his last fight that he had.

3911
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:17,331
Man,

3912
01:44:17,331 --> 01:44:18,830
you should know Cami is a beast.

3913
01:44:18,831 --> 01:44:19,641
He's a tough,

3914
01:44:19,641 --> 01:44:20,810
tough fucking guy.

3915
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,360
No one's ever handled him
the way Anderson handled him.

3916
01:44:23,361 --> 01:44:27,380
Anderson is just on this complete
total different new level.

3917
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:29,960
But to some people coming up,

3918
01:44:29,961 --> 01:44:30,500
man,

3919
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:31,720
they're coming up and they're,

3920
01:44:31,721 --> 01:44:32,630
they're going to be better.

3921
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:34,370
There's the John Jones is of the world.

3922
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:34,971
You know,

3923
01:44:34,971 --> 01:44:36,010
you look at John Jones go,

3924
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:40,880
what's John Jones going to be like when
he's 30 John Johnson's like 23 years old

3925
01:44:40,881 --> 01:44:41,420
dude,

3926
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:46,420
and he's way better at 23 then he was
at 22 I met him at 22 he was good then.

3927
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:48,560
He's fucking way better now.

3928
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:50,190
What's going to be like
and he's 25 what's eating?

3929
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:51,740
Even like when he's 28 years old,

3930
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:55,340
he's going to be a fucking
comic book Superhero Dude.

3931
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:56,960
He's just going to be
doing shit to people.

3932
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,610
You can't even believe some young guy,

3933
01:44:58,790 --> 01:45:01,250
people that are coming up
that aren't that talented.

3934
01:45:01,310 --> 01:45:03,470
People that have physical flaws,

3935
01:45:03,471 --> 01:45:05,720
people that have flaws and their game,

3936
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,790
he's just going to run through them.

3937
01:45:07,970 --> 01:45:09,290
Just gonna run through them.

3938
01:45:09,730 --> 01:45:10,640
The question is,

3939
01:45:10,810 --> 01:45:11,790
when does the,

3940
01:45:11,791 --> 01:45:13,820
the two paths cross like the master,

3941
01:45:13,821 --> 01:45:14,750
like Anderson Silva,

3942
01:45:14,751 --> 01:45:19,460
who's a master at a certain few levels
of the game and then this young kid

3943
01:45:19,461 --> 01:45:22,400
coming up who slowly mastering everything,

3944
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:22,881
you know,

3945
01:45:22,881 --> 01:45:25,430
comes from this completely
different discipline of wrestling.

3946
01:45:25,670 --> 01:45:25,971
You know,

3947
01:45:25,971 --> 01:45:27,890
Anderson comes from
this Moitai discipline.

3948
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:28,341
His,

3949
01:45:28,341 --> 01:45:31,100
his discipline is all about kicking you
and punching and all of sudden there's

3950
01:45:31,101 --> 01:45:33,230
this wrestler who's kicking
and punching you and he's like,

3951
01:45:33,231 --> 01:45:33,830
what?

3952
01:45:33,830 --> 01:45:35,000
He can wrestle too.

3953
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:37,790
And he's developing this ridiculous
kicking and punching game.

3954
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:39,110
Fuck,

3955
01:45:39,170 --> 01:45:40,250
that's the next level.

3956
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:42,110
And then there's going
to be someone after him,

3957
01:45:42,111 --> 01:45:42,560
man.

3958
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:45,920
There's to be some guy who does everything
twice as fast as everybody else does

3959
01:45:45,921 --> 01:45:46,310
it.

3960
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:47,510
And he's coming up right now.

3961
01:45:47,511 --> 01:45:48,820
He's probably 10 years old right now.

3962
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:50,020
And what's holding the pads for him?

3963
01:45:50,021 --> 01:45:53,000
It was probably more fighters now in
training than there's ever been ever been

3964
01:45:53,001 --> 01:45:53,834
by far.

3965
01:45:53,990 --> 01:45:54,771
And it's,

3966
01:45:54,771 --> 01:45:56,060
the organizations are growing,

3967
01:45:56,150 --> 01:45:56,361
you know,

3968
01:45:56,361 --> 01:45:58,250
people always say that the UFC is a,

3969
01:45:58,251 --> 01:45:59,084
um,

3970
01:45:59,510 --> 01:46:00,081
is a,

3971
01:46:00,081 --> 01:46:00,950
a monopoly,

3972
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:01,461
you know,

3973
01:46:01,461 --> 01:46:01,790
and the,

3974
01:46:01,790 --> 01:46:02,010
they're,

3975
01:46:02,010 --> 01:46:06,710
they're actually even being
investigated by someone from federal,

3976
01:46:06,730 --> 01:46:06,991
federal,

3977
01:46:06,991 --> 01:46:07,491
cc,

3978
01:46:07,491 --> 01:46:08,324
federal trade,

3979
01:46:08,450 --> 01:46:10,340
FTC federal trade commission,

3980
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:13,250
and they're being investigated
as being a monopoly,

3981
01:46:13,251 --> 01:46:14,510
but it's not a monopoly.

3982
01:46:14,511 --> 01:46:15,860
They just do it better than anybody else.

3983
01:46:15,861 --> 01:46:16,820
It's like you can't,

3984
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:19,340
you can't say that Nascar is a monopoly,

3985
01:46:19,550 --> 01:46:21,320
but if you wanted to say,

3986
01:46:21,321 --> 01:46:21,501
hey,

3987
01:46:21,501 --> 01:46:23,240
let's start up our own fucking car league.

3988
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:25,430
You know we're going to just
race cars all across the country.

3989
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:26,270
What are you going to call it?

3990
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:27,290
The new car league.

3991
01:46:27,370 --> 01:46:27,830
Everybody like,

3992
01:46:27,830 --> 01:46:28,610
but it's not Nascar,

3993
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:28,910
right?

3994
01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:29,450
No.

3995
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:30,350
Well now it's not.

3996
01:46:30,351 --> 01:46:31,490
Nascar has a monopoly.

3997
01:46:31,620 --> 01:46:32,720
Just they're the best at it.

3998
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:34,550
You could start your own
car league if you want to.

3999
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:36,140
That's the same thing with the UFC.

4000
01:46:36,141 --> 01:46:37,340
The UFC is not a monopoly.

4001
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:37,941
You know,

4002
01:46:37,941 --> 01:46:40,610
they just have the best fighters right
now cause they have the most money and

4003
01:46:40,611 --> 01:46:41,510
the most popularity,

4004
01:46:41,810 --> 01:46:43,640
but they built this shit up man.

4005
01:46:43,641 --> 01:46:44,900
If you want to do it by yourself,

4006
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:47,960
do it by herself and Bella
tours doing it by themselves.

4007
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:49,470
There's a company called [inaudible].

4008
01:46:49,600 --> 01:46:50,433
They're fucking,

4009
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:51,750
they've got some good fighters,

4010
01:46:51,751 --> 01:46:52,290
man.

4011
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:54,000
They've got a good show.

4012
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:56,430
They got this Guy Jimmy Smith
who does the commentary.

4013
01:46:56,431 --> 01:46:57,630
He's really good at it.

4014
01:46:57,631 --> 01:46:59,070
He's a black belt in Jujitsu,

4015
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:00,840
knows what the fuck is going on.

4016
01:47:00,841 --> 01:47:02,520
He's gives excellent commentary there.

4017
01:47:02,521 --> 01:47:03,121
Color guys,

4018
01:47:03,121 --> 01:47:03,840
really good.

4019
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:04,860
They have a good show.

4020
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:08,610
They do a different format where they
have tournament's and they hold this

4021
01:47:08,611 --> 01:47:11,790
tournament and the tournament takes place
over several weeks or several months

4022
01:47:11,791 --> 01:47:12,270
rather.

4023
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:16,140
And then they pick a guy who wins a
tournament and he fights for the title and

4024
01:47:16,170 --> 01:47:16,500
you know,

4025
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,140
they do a fucking real good job man.

4026
01:47:18,141 --> 01:47:20,820
And they do a real good job with it
and they just got bought out by Viacom.

4027
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,670
So it's not that the UFC is a monopoly,

4028
01:47:23,671 --> 01:47:25,500
there's other people in the game.

4029
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:26,970
They just been in the game longer.

4030
01:47:26,971 --> 01:47:28,020
They spent more money,

4031
01:47:28,021 --> 01:47:29,370
they invested more time,

4032
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:30,353
they do it better.

4033
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:31,200
It's that simple.

4034
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:31,891
You know,

4035
01:47:31,891 --> 01:47:36,750
it's like there's a certain amount of
people that whenever you get to a certain

4036
01:47:36,751 --> 01:47:37,710
level of success,

4037
01:47:37,711 --> 01:47:38,400
they want to,

4038
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,860
they want to think that you did
something wrong to get there.

4039
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:42,660
But if it wasn't for the UFC,

4040
01:47:42,661 --> 01:47:43,050
man,

4041
01:47:43,050 --> 01:47:44,760
nobody would have invested
that kind of money.

4042
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:45,271
Eventually.

4043
01:47:45,271 --> 01:47:50,271
I think MMA would have slowly broken
through to the mainstream over the course

4044
01:47:50,431 --> 01:47:51,510
of who knows how many years.

4045
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:55,800
Or it could have wound up like soccer
where everybody thought it was going to

4046
01:47:55,801 --> 01:47:56,191
make it,

4047
01:47:56,191 --> 01:47:56,611
but it never,

4048
01:47:56,611 --> 01:47:57,960
did you remember?

4049
01:47:58,220 --> 01:47:58,410
Well,

4050
01:47:58,410 --> 01:47:59,670
soccer when we were kids,

4051
01:47:59,790 --> 01:48:00,840
they're pushing soccer.

4052
01:48:00,841 --> 01:48:02,880
Like soccer is eventually going
to be a big professional sport.

4053
01:48:02,881 --> 01:48:03,714
I remember that,

4054
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:04,750
but it never did.

4055
01:48:04,751 --> 01:48:06,690
It just never quite marketed it correctly.

4056
01:48:06,691 --> 01:48:07,830
It never quite got through.

4057
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:09,143
Yeah,

4058
01:48:09,670 --> 01:48:12,430
and same with hockey for Columbus.

4059
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:14,390
He's still pretty good
for Ohio at four I lived,

4060
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,020
they tried to push hockey a lot.

4061
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:16,390
Yeah,

4062
01:48:16,390 --> 01:48:17,430
it was pretty big for a while,

4063
01:48:17,431 --> 01:48:18,330
but now it's kind of like,

4064
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:19,230
I don't think it's,

4065
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:20,610
if someone smart,

4066
01:48:20,850 --> 01:48:21,720
if someone's got balls,

4067
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:22,583
listen to me right now.

4068
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:23,453
This is the thing.

4069
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:25,170
K One kickboxing.

4070
01:48:25,830 --> 01:48:29,130
Kickboxing is some of the most
exciting shit to watch in the world.

4071
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:33,300
If you watch the highest level kickboxers
God damn is that should exciting.

4072
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:35,640
It's so fucking fun to watch.

4073
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:36,840
They go at it,

4074
01:48:36,841 --> 01:48:37,021
man.

4075
01:48:37,021 --> 01:48:38,310
It's only three rounds.

4076
01:48:38,430 --> 01:48:40,080
Even title fights are like three rounds.

4077
01:48:40,081 --> 01:48:42,000
They fucking go to a war man.

4078
01:48:42,210 --> 01:48:42,810
And those,

4079
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:44,160
some of the fights are
five rounds I think.

4080
01:48:44,161 --> 01:48:45,900
But either way they,

4081
01:48:45,901 --> 01:48:46,170
they're,

4082
01:48:46,170 --> 01:48:48,600
they're fun and it's all striking,

4083
01:48:48,601 --> 01:48:51,300
which is what a lot of people like a
lot of people don't like the wrestling

4084
01:48:51,301 --> 01:48:52,530
aspect of MMA.

4085
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:55,620
I love it because I think it's the
most realistic sport in the world.

4086
01:48:55,621 --> 01:48:56,820
I mean it is real fighting.

4087
01:48:56,821 --> 01:49:00,390
It's a sport of real fighting
encompassing all the different techniques.

4088
01:49:00,391 --> 01:49:02,040
So to me it's more complicated.

4089
01:49:02,041 --> 01:49:03,210
It's more cerebral.

4090
01:49:03,211 --> 01:49:05,730
There's more strategy involved
because there's more variables.

4091
01:49:05,970 --> 01:49:06,181
I,

4092
01:49:06,181 --> 01:49:09,630
I'm always going to be a
huge fan of primarily of MMA.

4093
01:49:09,631 --> 01:49:11,460
If I had one thing to
watch it would be MMA,

4094
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:13,410
but I love fucking kickboxing too.

4095
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:14,461
I love watching it.

4096
01:49:14,461 --> 01:49:17,790
It's so much more exciting than regular
boxing and we know how boxing is still

4097
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:18,570
doing well.

4098
01:49:18,570 --> 01:49:20,520
People still want to
see a good boxing match.

4099
01:49:20,521 --> 01:49:20,940
You know,

4100
01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:22,380
if Manny Pacquiao was fighting,

4101
01:49:22,381 --> 01:49:24,990
people are still going to pack in
to see that guy light people up.

4102
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:25,891
But man,

4103
01:49:25,891 --> 01:49:27,690
if you watch some high level kickboxing,

4104
01:49:27,691 --> 01:49:30,510
boxing becomes boring
because they can't kick,

4105
01:49:30,511 --> 01:49:32,310
they're not doing all
this other crazy shit.

4106
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:32,911
You Watch.

4107
01:49:32,911 --> 01:49:34,290
Like I went to the um,

4108
01:49:34,510 --> 01:49:35,820
morning time professional league.

4109
01:49:35,821 --> 01:49:38,280
They had a show at long beach and I
went down and check that shit out.

4110
01:49:38,490 --> 01:49:39,241
God Damn,

4111
01:49:39,241 --> 01:49:39,811
it was fun,

4112
01:49:39,811 --> 01:49:40,051
Dude.

4113
01:49:40,051 --> 01:49:43,980
There was some of the best kickboxers
in the world and just I was in the front

4114
01:49:43,981 --> 01:49:45,600
row and watching these guys go at it,

4115
01:49:45,601 --> 01:49:46,040
man.

4116
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:48,100
Why Old Wild Shit?

4117
01:49:48,101 --> 01:49:49,630
Because they don't have to
worry about being taken down.

4118
01:49:49,660 --> 01:49:53,740
There's no takedowns so they're just
fucking t and off on each other.

4119
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:58,740
Mad Wild head kick knockouts and spinning
back fist knockouts and cotton people

4120
01:49:59,081 --> 01:49:59,711
with elbows.

4121
01:49:59,711 --> 01:50:00,431
It was nuts,

4122
01:50:00,431 --> 01:50:01,030
man.

4123
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:01,391
It's a,

4124
01:50:01,391 --> 01:50:02,860
it's a crazy sport.

4125
01:50:02,980 --> 01:50:04,600
I can't believe that.

4126
01:50:04,601 --> 01:50:07,840
It doesn't get the press that it deserves
because like maybe it's not as good as

4127
01:50:07,841 --> 01:50:08,590
MMA,

4128
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:12,280
but God damn if it ain't a close
second and it's not being promoted,

4129
01:50:12,370 --> 01:50:13,203
someone's,

4130
01:50:13,510 --> 01:50:15,970
someone's completely dropped the ball,

4131
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:16,310
you know,

4132
01:50:16,310 --> 01:50:19,300
they owe the people own k
one they owe a lot of money,

4133
01:50:19,301 --> 01:50:19,630
man.

4134
01:50:19,630 --> 01:50:20,860
They want to start fights,

4135
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:25,210
but they want to not have to pay all
the fighters that they owe money to and

4136
01:50:25,211 --> 01:50:25,331
they,

4137
01:50:25,331 --> 01:50:25,720
oh,

4138
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:29,290
just fucking untold millions of dollars
to fighters if they haven't paid.

4139
01:50:29,740 --> 01:50:32,200
So they're in a bad financial situation,

4140
01:50:32,201 --> 01:50:33,460
but it's because they're just,

4141
01:50:33,500 --> 01:50:35,380
they've didn't promote it correctly.

4142
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:37,000
If somebody liked the UFC,

4143
01:50:37,001 --> 01:50:37,571
came along,

4144
01:50:37,571 --> 01:50:39,850
if zoo for came along and picked up k one,

4145
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:40,951
they're not interested in it.

4146
01:50:40,951 --> 01:50:41,830
I've talked to them about it.

4147
01:50:42,130 --> 01:50:43,660
But if someone like that did,

4148
01:50:43,661 --> 01:50:46,270
if Mark Cuban did or someone
with balls and a lot of money,

4149
01:50:46,271 --> 01:50:47,140
who loves the sport?

4150
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:47,981
God Damn,

4151
01:50:47,981 --> 01:50:48,814
that's a gold mine.

4152
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:50,170
It's a Goddamn gold mine.

4153
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:51,461
Mark Cuban.

4154
01:50:51,461 --> 01:50:51,881
Go do it.

4155
01:50:51,881 --> 01:50:53,560
You already got Michael
Chavela working for you.

4156
01:50:53,710 --> 01:50:54,321
Michael Chevelle,

4157
01:50:54,321 --> 01:50:55,480
the Australian guy and my buddy.

4158
01:50:56,050 --> 01:50:56,860
You've toned out.

4159
01:50:56,860 --> 01:50:57,790
You've completely zoned out.

4160
01:50:57,791 --> 01:50:58,624
Which talking about finding,

4161
01:50:58,900 --> 01:50:59,321
what are you doing?

4162
01:50:59,321 --> 01:50:59,831
You're online.

4163
01:50:59,831 --> 01:51:00,790
You're checking your Facebook.

4164
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:01,081
No,

4165
01:51:01,081 --> 01:51:03,550
I was looking at trying to find
something on Monday to talk about,

4166
01:51:03,570 --> 01:51:04,170
but I can't find it.

4167
01:51:04,170 --> 01:51:05,003
What was it?

4168
01:51:05,220 --> 01:51:06,053
Uh,

4169
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:07,793
the,

4170
01:51:08,460 --> 01:51:09,293
I don't want to talk about it.

4171
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:10,590
You don't want it because
I want to find it.

4172
01:51:10,591 --> 01:51:12,300
If I talk about it cause
it's kind of pointless.

4173
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:13,651
Well,

4174
01:51:13,651 --> 01:51:15,450
why don't you help me
tell me and I'll help you.

4175
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:16,390
Oh,

4176
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:17,223
there's a,

4177
01:51:17,860 --> 01:51:18,970
something about the anonymous,

4178
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:19,180
uh,

4179
01:51:19,180 --> 01:51:23,620
it's a anonymous website
that I wanted to do show you,

4180
01:51:23,680 --> 01:51:24,040
but,

4181
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:26,280
and an anonymous website they have.

4182
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:26,560
Yeah.

4183
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:26,771
No,

4184
01:51:26,771 --> 01:51:27,880
I don't know if it's them or not.

4185
01:51:27,881 --> 01:51:29,140
I can't tell if it's real or not,

4186
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:30,730
but it's pointless not mine.

4187
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:34,150
So dare you Brian Up Darren.

4188
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:35,441
So,

4189
01:51:35,441 --> 01:51:35,830
um,

4190
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:36,431
this weekend,

4191
01:51:36,431 --> 01:51:37,180
Friday,

4192
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:37,781
today's Thursday,

4193
01:51:37,781 --> 01:51:41,160
tomorrow night you got to show at
the Ice House and when will the uh,

4194
01:51:41,170 --> 01:51:41,570
ice,

4195
01:51:41,570 --> 01:51:43,510
the ice house podcast studios confirmed,

4196
01:51:43,511 --> 01:51:43,790
right?

4197
01:51:43,790 --> 01:51:44,210
Yeah,

4198
01:51:44,210 --> 01:51:46,040
I live in the next week or two.

4199
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:50,720
So I'm leaving all deaf squad over
there and then we're still going to do a

4200
01:51:50,721 --> 01:51:53,060
podcast tomorrow though
with Duncan Trussell.

4201
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:53,840
Okay,

4202
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:54,350
beautiful.

4203
01:51:54,350 --> 01:51:54,620
Yeah.

4204
01:51:54,620 --> 01:51:55,460
And uh,

4205
01:51:55,490 --> 01:51:59,270
you're going to do a podcast from the ice
house and are you going to have it set

4206
01:51:59,271 --> 01:51:59,801
up with Mike?

4207
01:51:59,801 --> 01:52:00,980
So we're going to do it like old school,

4208
01:52:00,981 --> 01:52:03,870
like we did hold still and then
once we get the studio there,

4209
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:06,470
then we're probably going to make that
a whole like night at the ice house or

4210
01:52:06,471 --> 01:52:07,040
something like that.

4211
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:07,141
Well,

4212
01:52:07,141 --> 01:52:08,990
people were saying that
the last one was good,

4213
01:52:08,991 --> 01:52:10,910
but it felt like I was
pocket calling everybody.

4214
01:52:10,911 --> 01:52:11,810
Like that's what it was like.

4215
01:52:11,811 --> 01:52:14,560
It was like they're tuned into a
conversation that you can barely hear.

4216
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:17,960
You could hear everything else in the
background and people really liked the

4217
01:52:17,961 --> 01:52:21,170
fact that we were sitting there at a
desk right in front of the door to the

4218
01:52:21,171 --> 01:52:21,800
club.

4219
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:22,910
People were getting a kick out of that,

4220
01:52:22,911 --> 01:52:24,440
like as the show was going on,

4221
01:52:24,650 --> 01:52:26,630
like people who are podcast
fans like holy shit,

4222
01:52:26,631 --> 01:52:27,980
they're podcasting right there.

4223
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:29,540
And it was really kind of cool,

4224
01:52:29,570 --> 01:52:30,010
you know?

4225
01:52:30,010 --> 01:52:30,290
Yeah.

4226
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:31,970
If we had that area,

4227
01:52:32,150 --> 01:52:34,520
I would like to have eventually a,

4228
01:52:34,530 --> 01:52:39,230
an area set up where we could do it like
maybe before the shows and in between

4229
01:52:39,231 --> 01:52:42,380
shows and doing the back room and
the while the show's going on.

4230
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:44,060
We could do it right there,

4231
01:52:44,370 --> 01:52:45,140
do it right there,

4232
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:45,770
that table.

4233
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:46,010
But we

4234
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:50,690
would have to have it a little more
soundproof than it is just a wee bit,

4235
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:51,381
you know,

4236
01:52:51,381 --> 01:52:53,210
just like a curtain or
something like that.

4237
01:52:53,230 --> 01:52:55,010
It would be cool if people
knew we were right there.

4238
01:52:55,011 --> 01:52:55,580
But if,

4239
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:56,480
if you hear it,

4240
01:52:56,510 --> 01:52:56,761
it's,

4241
01:52:56,761 --> 01:52:58,220
it's all the talking and shit.

4242
01:52:58,221 --> 01:53:00,080
It's like a really bleeds
into the microphone.

4243
01:53:00,081 --> 01:53:01,250
It makes it hard to listen to.

4244
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:03,600
They were talking about eventually I,

4245
01:53:03,650 --> 01:53:07,490
there's another office that
depending on how all this goes,

4246
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:12,500
how they were thinking about building a
like a window so we could actually watch

4247
01:53:12,590 --> 01:53:17,590
who's on stage while we're podcasting
behind the audience and then we can have

4248
01:53:17,970 --> 01:53:20,780
like little inner if so we
can hear it would be amazing.

4249
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:23,450
And you know what else we can do that
I think we should probably fuck around

4250
01:53:23,451 --> 01:53:27,290
with a little bit is occasionally
have shows live on stage,

4251
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:28,370
have a podcast,

4252
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:30,650
live on stage a Jim Norton.

4253
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:30,920
Yeah,

4254
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:33,980
because it's a small room
because it's only 85 seats.

4255
01:53:33,981 --> 01:53:37,820
It's so intimate that it doesn't feel
like the conversation is completely out of

4256
01:53:37,821 --> 01:53:38,540
line.

4257
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:39,341
I just think that it,

4258
01:53:39,341 --> 01:53:42,230
exactly how it felt last time and
though even if there's like a couple of

4259
01:53:42,231 --> 01:53:43,220
strangers in the room,

4260
01:53:43,221 --> 01:53:45,050
we were kind of not being ourself.

4261
01:53:45,051 --> 01:53:46,940
We're kind of almost playing,

4262
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:47,910
playing it up.

4263
01:53:47,910 --> 01:53:49,000
I remember feeling that like,

4264
01:53:49,210 --> 01:53:49,450
like,

4265
01:53:49,450 --> 01:53:51,590
like it felt like we were
doing bits almost or at least,

4266
01:53:51,591 --> 01:53:51,880
you know,

4267
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:52,190
kind of,

4268
01:53:52,190 --> 01:53:52,640
yeah.

4269
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,830
Well Norton is such a great performer.

4270
01:53:54,860 --> 01:53:55,820
We know we did it with him,

4271
01:53:55,821 --> 01:53:58,370
was the perfect guy to do it with in
front of an audience cause he's just

4272
01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:02,090
immediately went into attack mode and
it was just killing like right off the

4273
01:54:02,091 --> 01:54:02,750
bat.

4274
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:03,320
And then,

4275
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:03,740
um,

4276
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:04,190
you know,

4277
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:07,640
I think it's settled in after a while
and it became intimate when I became

4278
01:54:07,641 --> 01:54:10,700
intimate also was when it was real
obvious that everybody in the show in the

4279
01:54:10,701 --> 01:54:12,050
audience was a podcast fan.

4280
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:14,870
And so that was fun for them to
be able to sit in and watch it.

4281
01:54:14,871 --> 01:54:16,040
And even though we only did it once,

4282
01:54:16,041 --> 01:54:18,140
I wouldn't be adverse to doing it again.

4283
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:21,740
And I also liked the idea that we could
hand out the microphone and we hung out,

4284
01:54:22,490 --> 01:54:25,220
pass out microphones to the crowd and
then the crowd would ask questions.

4285
01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:26,700
That was a fun thing that,

4286
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:30,410
that little kind of a more
relaxed question and answer
cause I kind of stopped

4287
01:54:30,411 --> 01:54:30,780
doing that.

4288
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:30,861
Uh,

4289
01:54:30,861 --> 01:54:31,970
rarely do that.

4290
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:32,270
Uh,

4291
01:54:32,270 --> 01:54:32,991
with an audience.

4292
01:54:32,991 --> 01:54:34,610
I think I did at one time last week.

4293
01:54:34,611 --> 01:54:34,920
And you're like,

4294
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:35,130
oh,

4295
01:54:35,130 --> 01:54:35,691
you do the Q and.

4296
01:54:35,691 --> 01:54:35,901
A.

4297
01:54:35,901 --> 01:54:36,440
You know,

4298
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:39,950
cause I haven't been really
doing it because it leads
to like a weird ending for

4299
01:54:39,951 --> 01:54:40,371
a show.

4300
01:54:40,371 --> 01:54:41,780
Like sometimes it's kind
of like you're going up,

4301
01:54:41,810 --> 01:54:45,470
this is like a great finale of an ending.

4302
01:54:45,471 --> 01:54:45,951
And then it's like,

4303
01:54:45,951 --> 01:54:46,281
all right,

4304
01:54:46,281 --> 01:54:48,850
now let's go backwards and
just kind of talk continental.

4305
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:49,310
Yeah.

4306
01:54:49,310 --> 01:54:49,821
It's Kinda weird.

4307
01:54:49,821 --> 01:54:50,390
It's weird.

4308
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:52,440
And then people would always
ask me questions that weren't,

4309
01:54:52,670 --> 01:54:57,120
that really didn't lead themselves into
being funny to me about Margaret Court

4310
01:54:57,250 --> 01:54:58,860
are know fighters.

4311
01:54:58,900 --> 01:54:59,300
Yeah.

4312
01:54:59,300 --> 01:54:59,840
It couldn't be,

4313
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:03,680
there was a random fighter thing
and then there was always like it.

4314
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:04,820
Occasionally people would,

4315
01:55:04,821 --> 01:55:05,780
well not occasionally,

4316
01:55:05,781 --> 01:55:07,640
every time people would
want to talk about drugs,

4317
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,930
somebody would always
yell a damn dude too,

4318
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:11,330
you know,

4319
01:55:11,330 --> 01:55:12,060
fucking to me.

4320
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:12,893
But mushrooms,

4321
01:55:13,500 --> 01:55:18,500
it's at a certain point in time you can
only explain psychedelic experiences so

4322
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:21,900
many times before you start
becoming a character of your shelf.

4323
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:22,860
You know,

4324
01:55:22,860 --> 01:55:23,091
you're like,

4325
01:55:23,091 --> 01:55:23,361
what am I,

4326
01:55:23,361 --> 01:55:24,680
how am I going to explain DMT?

4327
01:55:24,681 --> 01:55:25,640
The thousandth time?

4328
01:55:25,641 --> 01:55:25,971
I can't.

4329
01:55:25,971 --> 01:55:27,470
I'm going to give you
some and you to smoke it.

4330
01:55:27,471 --> 01:55:28,850
And that's the only
way it's going to work.

4331
01:55:28,851 --> 01:55:29,541
And I don't have any,

4332
01:55:29,541 --> 01:55:30,374
so good luck.

4333
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:32,383
It's like go.

4334
01:55:32,430 --> 01:55:32,730
You know,

4335
01:55:32,730 --> 01:55:33,563
you can't,

4336
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:36,560
people always say that
a man like on Twitter,

4337
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:38,890
please follow me and DMA.

4338
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:40,430
I need to talk to you about DMT.

4339
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:41,810
Guess what?

4340
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:42,620
No you don't.

4341
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:43,080
No you don't.

4342
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:43,461
No you don't.

4343
01:55:43,461 --> 01:55:44,160
You don't need to talk

4344
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:45,320
to me about some illegal drug.

4345
01:55:45,340 --> 01:55:46,500
I don't know you skippy.

4346
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:47,490
You could be anybody.

4347
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:48,960
It could be some fucking Weirdo.

4348
01:55:48,961 --> 01:55:49,681
You'd be a cop.

4349
01:55:49,681 --> 01:55:50,790
You can be crazy person.

4350
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:52,690
You don't need to talk to me about DMT,

4351
01:55:52,770 --> 01:55:54,330
right when it comes to legal.

4352
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:55,210
Yes,

4353
01:55:55,210 --> 01:55:55,921
it becomes league.

4354
01:55:55,921 --> 01:55:56,701
I'll talk to everybody.

4355
01:55:56,701 --> 01:55:56,881
I'll,

4356
01:55:56,881 --> 01:55:57,120
I'll,

4357
01:55:57,120 --> 01:55:58,860
I'll hold a seminar on
the fucking White House.

4358
01:55:58,861 --> 01:55:59,694
Front steps.

4359
01:55:59,910 --> 01:56:00,870
I'll tell people about it.

4360
01:56:01,070 --> 01:56:01,530
Yeah.

4361
01:56:01,530 --> 01:56:04,020
Tell you how to take three
deep hits until that time.

4362
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:05,430
I'm not saying shit.

4363
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:08,250
That's the next war.

4364
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:09,810
The war for consciousness.

4365
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:12,850
The warfare control of he should be legal.

4366
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:14,010
Um,

4367
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:14,581
I think,

4368
01:56:14,581 --> 01:56:16,080
and I've said this many times before,

4369
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:20,190
that we need schamens that if you're
going to have something like mushrooms,

4370
01:56:20,430 --> 01:56:22,020
if you're going to have
something like pay Payoti,

4371
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:23,800
what you need is a,

4372
01:56:23,801 --> 01:56:24,690
a very,

4373
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:25,583
uh,

4374
01:56:25,770 --> 01:56:26,790
rigorous,

4375
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:31,880
sort of a ritual and a path to follow
in order to have these experiences.

4376
01:56:32,970 --> 01:56:35,250
I don't think they should
just be open for recreation.

4377
01:56:35,490 --> 01:56:38,490
I think too many people doom and fuck
their head up and don't know what they're

4378
01:56:38,491 --> 01:56:40,470
doing and they can be so beneficial.

4379
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:42,060
And I'm not saying that
if you're a grown man,

4380
01:56:42,061 --> 01:56:42,660
you shouldn't.

4381
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:44,220
Once you have experienced in these realms,

4382
01:56:44,370 --> 01:56:46,950
you shouldn't be able to get together
with your friends and have a few mushrooms

4383
01:56:46,951 --> 01:56:48,600
and hang out and be silly and laugh.

4384
01:56:48,750 --> 01:56:50,340
I absolutely think you should be able to,

4385
01:56:50,341 --> 01:56:51,174
you should be able to,

4386
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:51,361
like,

4387
01:56:51,361 --> 01:56:53,520
there's a lot of people that are like
real serious about it and so you should

4388
01:56:53,521 --> 01:56:56,670
only do it for shamonic rituals
and never do it or for recreation.

4389
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:57,301
And I'm like,

4390
01:56:57,301 --> 01:56:57,990
why?

4391
01:56:57,990 --> 01:56:58,381
Why,

4392
01:56:58,381 --> 01:57:00,570
when it can be fun to
do it for recreation.

4393
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:00,901
They don't,

4394
01:57:00,901 --> 01:57:04,440
don't say you have to do it one way
or another or that it's disrespectful.

4395
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:05,041
Guess what?

4396
01:57:05,041 --> 01:57:08,310
The mushroom doesn't give a fuck
about your respect in this world.

4397
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:08,521
The,

4398
01:57:08,521 --> 01:57:08,681
the,

4399
01:57:08,681 --> 01:57:09,530
the mushroom is,

4400
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:09,731
is a,

4401
01:57:09,731 --> 01:57:11,250
is whatever it is,

4402
01:57:11,251 --> 01:57:12,450
whatever that experience is,

4403
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:15,270
it seems to be about
forgiveness and love and fun.

4404
01:57:15,510 --> 01:57:15,871
You know,

4405
01:57:15,871 --> 01:57:18,930
that's what it seems to be about reality
and truth and forgiveness and love and

4406
01:57:18,931 --> 01:57:19,340
fun.

4407
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:21,180
And I don't think it minds
if you use a casually,

4408
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:24,930
but I think we need to have
some sort of a setup where,

4409
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:25,440
uh,

4410
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:27,120
people are educated on it.

4411
01:57:27,330 --> 01:57:30,450
People like you don't just dive into
it not knowing what the fuck it is.

4412
01:57:30,600 --> 01:57:34,170
You W we could easily
have a service where,

4413
01:57:34,171 --> 01:57:34,411
you know,

4414
01:57:34,411 --> 01:57:35,280
if it was legal,

4415
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:39,560
you could set up these shamonic
places where someone could go and you,

4416
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:42,810
this is Tom and Tom's going to
guide you through the program.

4417
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:45,120
Today's going to be the
first day and today,

4418
01:57:45,121 --> 01:57:46,920
essentially what we're going
to do is we're gonna sit down,

4419
01:57:46,921 --> 01:57:48,060
we're going to watch a documentary.

4420
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:49,200
We're going to have a question to answer.

4421
01:57:49,350 --> 01:57:51,990
We're going to watch a documentary about
the history of use of mushrooms in the

4422
01:57:51,991 --> 01:57:52,440
world.

4423
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:55,920
And then you'll fucking see this
documentary on Gordon Wasson and all these

4424
01:57:55,921 --> 01:57:59,490
other people that took mushrooms and what
these tribes learned about it and how

4425
01:57:59,491 --> 01:58:00,630
this was suppressed by,

4426
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:01,210
you know,

4427
01:58:01,210 --> 01:58:03,600
the various fucking dictators and kings.

4428
01:58:03,620 --> 01:58:05,340
And it'll go through the history of it.

4429
01:58:05,490 --> 01:58:07,620
And then the next day you
go through the history of,

4430
01:58:07,621 --> 01:58:07,880
uh,

4431
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:08,430
you know,

4432
01:58:08,430 --> 01:58:10,110
other psychedelic drugs and you know,

4433
01:58:10,111 --> 01:58:13,110
what's the benefit of them and what's
the dangers of them and how does it

4434
01:58:13,111 --> 01:58:16,530
interact with your body and how
can we find out if you know you're,

4435
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:17,130
you're,

4436
01:58:17,130 --> 01:58:17,640
you know,

4437
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:19,080
especially vulnerable,

4438
01:58:19,410 --> 01:58:19,740
you know,

4439
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:23,340
and then slowly but surely you
introduce someone into those,

4440
01:58:23,341 --> 01:58:24,174
those realms.

4441
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:26,940
And I suggest starting
them off really lightly.

4442
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:29,310
I think that the first mushroom
experience you should have,

4443
01:58:29,311 --> 01:58:30,600
it should be fairly high.

4444
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:32,310
You should just just
get a little bit of it.

4445
01:58:32,311 --> 01:58:35,250
So you just kind of get a feel of it
and a little giggle and yourself system

4446
01:58:35,251 --> 01:58:36,240
where you don't feel scared,

4447
01:58:36,241 --> 01:58:37,021
you don't feel nervous,

4448
01:58:37,021 --> 01:58:37,351
you just go,

4449
01:58:37,351 --> 01:58:37,441
oh,

4450
01:58:37,441 --> 01:58:38,131
this is all right.

4451
01:58:38,131 --> 01:58:38,720
This is,

4452
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:40,140
this is this crazy experience.

4453
01:58:40,141 --> 01:58:40,960
This is just weird.

4454
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:41,261
Wow,

4455
01:58:41,261 --> 01:58:42,130
this is wild.

4456
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:45,490
What a weird way of looking at the world
I have now and then eventually slowly

4457
01:58:45,491 --> 01:58:49,670
but surely you should be introduced into
the deeper and deeper dimensions into

4458
01:58:49,680 --> 01:58:54,680
the ideas that there is no real solid
line between this world and the others.

4459
01:58:55,151 --> 01:58:57,040
It's just that this is
all that we can detect.

4460
01:58:57,070 --> 01:59:01,240
This is all that we have the equipment
to see and that what what mushrooms do,

4461
01:59:01,241 --> 01:59:05,680
any of these psychedelic drugs do is
chemically alter the way your frequency or

4462
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:09,430
the way your brain interacts with the
universe and allows you to see some shit

4463
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:11,140
that might just be there all the time.

4464
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:13,450
He just might not have
the ability to see it.

4465
01:59:14,470 --> 01:59:15,310
That's what I think.

4466
01:59:15,311 --> 01:59:17,110
I think all of it should be legal.

4467
01:59:17,290 --> 01:59:20,650
There's no way one person should be
keeping you from these experiences.

4468
01:59:20,830 --> 01:59:24,730
What should be illegal and especially
illegal to sell as anything that you think

4469
01:59:24,731 --> 01:59:28,300
to damage people or harm people or
cause addiction and that shit already is

4470
01:59:28,301 --> 01:59:28,930
legal.

4471
01:59:28,930 --> 01:59:31,180
That shit has already been sold
by pharmaceutical companies.

4472
01:59:31,181 --> 01:59:31,901
Things that are far,

4473
01:59:31,901 --> 01:59:32,171
far,

4474
01:59:32,171 --> 01:59:33,280
far more dangerous.

4475
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:33,731
You know,

4476
01:59:33,731 --> 01:59:36,130
even when you come into like
drugs that are dangerous,

4477
01:59:36,131 --> 01:59:36,964
like heroin,

4478
01:59:37,030 --> 01:59:39,700
you know what the fucking cure for heroin
is or what they give you and you're

4479
01:59:39,701 --> 01:59:40,271
hooked on heroin.

4480
01:59:40,271 --> 01:59:41,260
They give you methadone,

4481
01:59:41,261 --> 01:59:41,800
man,

4482
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:44,770
which in many people's eyes is
way worse than heroin itself.

4483
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:46,480
More addictive than heroin itself.

4484
01:59:46,481 --> 01:59:47,410
Hard to get off.

4485
01:59:47,411 --> 01:59:48,700
It's fucking dangerous shit.

4486
01:59:48,701 --> 01:59:49,600
It's all gross,

4487
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:50,261
you know?

4488
01:59:50,261 --> 01:59:54,130
So I think that stuff that's
bad for you as a society,

4489
01:59:54,131 --> 01:59:56,920
we should shun and that's
what smart people would do.

4490
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:58,630
That's what educated people would do.

4491
01:59:58,810 --> 02:00:03,250
What people that are in just this fucking
whirlwind of momentum and hysteria,

4492
02:00:03,251 --> 02:00:07,390
that's not based on anything
logical or rational or or realistic.

4493
02:00:08,470 --> 02:00:10,570
That's when the world is like that.

4494
02:00:10,571 --> 02:00:12,640
That's when you get drug
laws like we have right now.

4495
02:00:12,700 --> 02:00:15,670
Nutty ones don't make any
sense or not based on logic.

4496
02:00:15,671 --> 02:00:16,900
They're not based on knowledge.

4497
02:00:17,110 --> 02:00:20,800
They're based on some bullshit that was
taught in the 1930s there based on some

4498
02:00:21,070 --> 02:00:22,780
sweeping drug addicts,

4499
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:27,250
drug acts that which included things that
weren't even psychoactive in humans in

4500
02:00:27,251 --> 02:00:29,380
1970 so that's what I think.

4501
02:00:29,381 --> 02:00:30,610
We're fucking being oppressed.

4502
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:31,720
No question about it.

4503
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:35,710
We have a system that's old as fuck
and you're seeing it right now with his

4504
02:00:35,711 --> 02:00:36,540
craziest,

4505
02:00:36,540 --> 02:00:39,490
there's these demonstration and
the occupy Wall Street movement.

4506
02:00:39,491 --> 02:00:40,630
That's the financial system.

4507
02:00:40,631 --> 02:00:42,190
That system is old as fuck.

4508
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:45,010
We also have a legal
system that's old as fuck.

4509
02:00:45,190 --> 02:00:49,120
It's stupid and that gets ridiculous
and thinks that it's above the humans,

4510
02:00:49,121 --> 02:00:52,510
that it's supposed to be there to
help and aid and assist and instead of

4511
02:00:52,511 --> 02:00:53,980
assisting the humans that it's that,

4512
02:00:54,010 --> 02:00:54,731
that you know,

4513
02:00:54,731 --> 02:00:55,990
it's supposed to be there to protect.

4514
02:00:55,991 --> 02:01:00,310
Instead they act as a fucking bully unit
for big businesses that seek to push

4515
02:01:00,311 --> 02:01:02,350
things in one way or another
in order to make more money.

4516
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:02,720
W,

4517
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:07,720
w the whole thing is just filled with
clients across the board with the legal

4518
02:01:08,021 --> 02:01:08,441
system,

4519
02:01:08,441 --> 02:01:09,520
the financial system,

4520
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:13,030
and the fact that things
like marijuana and mushrooms,

4521
02:01:13,031 --> 02:01:17,740
things that probably aided in people's
perception and the evolution of people's

4522
02:01:17,741 --> 02:01:21,130
perception since there were
people from the very beginning.

4523
02:01:21,370 --> 02:01:24,910
I know for a fact that those things have
helped me and I know for a fact they've

4524
02:01:24,940 --> 02:01:29,050
helped you and everybody that we know
that's had psychedelic experiences has

4525
02:01:29,051 --> 02:01:30,010
been helped by them.

4526
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:30,820
You know,

4527
02:01:30,820 --> 02:01:32,350
we know people that have had bad ones.

4528
02:01:32,351 --> 02:01:33,910
We know people that have bet scary ones,

4529
02:01:34,210 --> 02:01:36,520
but when you sit down with them and say,

4530
02:01:36,521 --> 02:01:37,510
what did you learn?

4531
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:38,680
What did you get out of that?

4532
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:41,300
They almost all say humility.

4533
02:01:41,450 --> 02:01:44,060
They almost all say a
feeling of connectedness.

4534
02:01:44,150 --> 02:01:44,990
Member Ari.

4535
02:01:44,991 --> 02:01:49,550
Ari was like an angry dude for a while
until Ari started tripping and when Ari

4536
02:01:49,551 --> 02:01:50,240
started tripping,

4537
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:50,421
dude,

4538
02:01:50,421 --> 02:01:52,610
he started doing mushrooms
like fairly regularly.

4539
02:01:52,611 --> 02:01:56,150
Every few months or so are
you became a way nicer guy,

4540
02:01:56,210 --> 02:02:00,350
a way more aware of the fact that
he should be a nice guy there.

4541
02:02:00,351 --> 02:02:00,861
Therefore,

4542
02:02:00,861 --> 02:02:01,694
you man,

4543
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:07,460
this message brought to you by mushrooms
and the marijuana shrunk to things that

4544
02:02:07,461 --> 02:02:09,150
are illegal to things early on.

4545
02:02:09,151 --> 02:02:10,550
This fucking wacky world.

4546
02:02:10,551 --> 02:02:11,900
We live in Brian Reichel.

4547
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:16,460
We know it's not illegal
podcasts pitches next week.

4548
02:02:16,461 --> 02:02:18,050
Joe Diaz on Monday,

4549
02:02:18,290 --> 02:02:20,780
supposedly David Tail on Tuesday.

4550
02:02:21,050 --> 02:02:24,620
I got to Holler at Homie and we got to
work this out and we're going to try to

4551
02:02:24,621 --> 02:02:26,050
get Shane from uh,

4552
02:02:26,170 --> 02:02:26,961
vice TV,

4553
02:02:26,961 --> 02:02:30,740
which should be absolutely
fucking spectacular.

4554
02:02:31,130 --> 02:02:31,963
And um,

4555
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:34,490
Friday which is tomorrow
night at the Ice House.

4556
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:35,473
Gimme the lineup.

4557
02:02:36,030 --> 02:02:36,530
Uh,

4558
02:02:36,530 --> 02:02:38,720
we got Duncan Trussell,

4559
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:41,210
our magical Steve run is easy.

4560
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:42,530
Kevin Christie,

4561
02:02:42,531 --> 02:02:43,430
Sam Tripoli.

4562
02:02:43,431 --> 02:02:48,431
It's his birthday too and Jason
Tebow and it's $15 on sale right now.

4563
02:02:48,771 --> 02:02:49,760
Last week sold out.

4564
02:02:49,761 --> 02:02:50,390
It's,

4565
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:50,811
you can't,

4566
02:02:50,811 --> 02:02:51,644
I mean usually that,

4567
02:02:51,650 --> 02:02:53,440
that would be just one of those guys too.

4568
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:54,560
Those guys are headliners.

4569
02:02:54,810 --> 02:02:56,870
That would be like a $30 show usually.

4570
02:02:56,871 --> 02:02:57,210
So

4571
02:02:57,210 --> 02:02:57,421
yeah,

4572
02:02:57,421 --> 02:02:58,160
that's a great shot.

4573
02:02:58,160 --> 02:02:59,760
It's a great show with
a bunch of great guys.

4574
02:02:59,790 --> 02:03:04,350
And if you never seen Tripoli or nursing
Dunkin or any of those guys that's top

4575
02:03:04,351 --> 02:03:04,740
notch,

4576
02:03:04,740 --> 02:03:06,690
stand up in La and it's
only like 15 bucks,

4577
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:08,130
15 bucks,

4578
02:03:08,130 --> 02:03:09,990
and they're going to be
doing podcasts there.

4579
02:03:09,991 --> 02:03:12,420
So if you fucking get in on that,

4580
02:03:12,421 --> 02:03:13,470
they might let you go.

4581
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:14,333
Hi Mom.

4582
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:15,373
I'm going to say no,

4583
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:16,533
no

4584
02:03:18,160 --> 02:03:20,490
that have people come in and we
won't tell them where the studio is.

4585
02:03:20,491 --> 02:03:21,090
That's the thing.

4586
02:03:21,090 --> 02:03:23,550
Eventually the studio
will have to be in glass,

4587
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:24,370
so it'd be going to put,

4588
02:03:24,370 --> 02:03:25,450
put their boogers on it and shit,

4589
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:28,980
but just get some really
thick glass like plexiglass,

4590
02:03:29,010 --> 02:03:30,060
some bulletproof shit.

4591
02:03:30,650 --> 02:03:32,400
So we could do it right in
front of people like the zoo.

4592
02:03:32,450 --> 02:03:33,120
Yeah,

4593
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:33,811
that'd be awesome.

4594
02:03:33,811 --> 02:03:36,930
That'd be awesome to have it
like right set up there were,

4595
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:37,591
how about that,

4596
02:03:37,591 --> 02:03:39,150
you know that little door to the,

4597
02:03:39,151 --> 02:03:41,070
to the ice house when you
go into that small room.

4598
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:45,240
How about if that wall was just all
plexiglass and you right where the ticket

4599
02:03:45,241 --> 02:03:46,320
booth is right next to it.

4600
02:03:46,410 --> 02:03:48,290
We had like microphone
setup and we did it like,

4601
02:03:48,300 --> 02:03:49,920
so you could see right
when you're on stage.

4602
02:03:50,030 --> 02:03:50,600
Yeah.

4603
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:51,080
And we have the,

4604
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:53,810
there's a little change machines where
you usually get the zoo where you could

4605
02:03:53,811 --> 02:03:54,501
feed the animals,

4606
02:03:54,501 --> 02:03:56,750
but it'd be like skittles and
stuff and they can give us candy.

4607
02:03:57,550 --> 02:03:58,220
Hmm.

4608
02:03:58,220 --> 02:03:59,810
Maybe they give you
candy if you get laughs,

4609
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:00,650
right.

4610
02:04:00,650 --> 02:04:01,470
Maybe if,

4611
02:04:01,470 --> 02:04:02,303
if you see a little,

4612
02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:03,390
yeah.

4613
02:04:03,390 --> 02:04:04,223
Like

4614
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:05,160
it has to like the,

4615
02:04:05,161 --> 02:04:09,480
the decibel level of the laughter has to
reach a certain level and then a green

4616
02:04:09,481 --> 02:04:13,470
light goes off in a little skittle and
goes into a tray or joint or joint.

4617
02:04:14,710 --> 02:04:17,610
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the fleshlight.

4618
02:04:17,611 --> 02:04:18,930
Thank you to the fleshlight.

4619
02:04:18,931 --> 02:04:19,471
Once again,

4620
02:04:19,471 --> 02:04:22,530
we've been in business with
those guys for a long time now.

4621
02:04:22,531 --> 02:04:24,870
It's been a very fun and uh,

4622
02:04:24,930 --> 02:04:25,770
it's funny.

4623
02:04:25,830 --> 02:04:30,830
It makes me take things less seriously
because what are you looking for it?

4624
02:04:31,370 --> 02:04:32,550
I'm just finding it because,

4625
02:04:32,551 --> 02:04:32,850
um,

4626
02:04:32,850 --> 02:04:32,971
oh,

4627
02:04:32,971 --> 02:04:35,640
the blue one because I don't know,

4628
02:04:35,641 --> 02:04:35,851
man.

4629
02:04:35,851 --> 02:04:40,851
There's something ridiculous
being sponsored by a rubber
pussy and I think it's

4630
02:04:41,161 --> 02:04:44,310
good for us to be taken less seriously,

4631
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:45,173
which is why you're here.

4632
02:04:45,300 --> 02:04:45,691
And,

4633
02:04:45,691 --> 02:04:45,931
uh,

4634
02:04:45,931 --> 02:04:46,764
anyway,

4635
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:48,820
what I really,

4636
02:04:48,970 --> 02:04:51,270
Shane Smith contact me.

4637
02:04:51,330 --> 02:04:52,320
We're going to make this happen.

4638
02:04:52,770 --> 02:04:55,320
I'm so excited about that
either next week or soon.

4639
02:04:55,620 --> 02:04:56,453
And um,

4640
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:56,851
all right.

4641
02:04:56,851 --> 02:04:57,670
That's it.

4642
02:04:57,670 --> 02:04:59,270
You fucking freaks.

4643
02:05:00,080 --> 02:05:01,310
Thanks to the flashlight.

4644

Get your 15% off.

4649
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:06,920
Somebody says,

4650
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:08,990
I shouldn't say enter in
cause enter means to put in,

4651
02:05:09,290 --> 02:05:10,550
but fuck you.

4652
02:05:10,850 --> 02:05:13,940
How about that grammar people swat bag.

4653
02:05:14,610 --> 02:05:15,443
Uh,

4654
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:17,300
I say that with all the love in the world.

4655
02:05:17,660 --> 02:05:18,021
Also,

4656
02:05:18,021 --> 02:05:21,500
we're sponsored by on
it on it.com o n n I t,

4657
02:05:21,530 --> 02:05:26,260
makers of Alpha brain and also
this new stuff called new mood.

4658
02:05:26,300 --> 02:05:29,060
It's five HTP and some other groovy
shit that makes you feel better.

4659
02:05:29,420 --> 02:05:31,160
And also we have a shroom tech,

4660
02:05:31,161 --> 02:05:34,430
which is an athletic supplement for elite
athletes based on the courthouse steps

4661
02:05:34,431 --> 02:05:36,380
mushroom that I have been using lately.

4662
02:05:36,381 --> 02:05:37,850
And I find fucking excellent.

4663
02:05:38,210 --> 02:05:39,680
It's all good shit.

4664
02:05:39,710 --> 02:05:41,150
You freaks.

4665
02:05:41,480 --> 02:05:42,470
Thanks for everything.

4666
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:44,870
Thanks for making this
podcast so successful.

4667
02:05:44,871 --> 02:05:46,130
Thanks for being cool as fuck.

4668
02:05:46,131 --> 02:05:49,400
Thanks for every time I go out
of comedy clubs and theaters.

4669
02:05:49,401 --> 02:05:52,580
I hear from wait staff all the time that
you guys are the coolest motherfuckers

4670
02:05:52,581 --> 02:05:53,540
they ever get to wait on.

4671
02:05:53,940 --> 02:05:54,260
Um,

4672
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:54,460
I,

4673
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:54,910
I,

4674
02:05:54,910 --> 02:05:55,910
I this no bullshit.

4675
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:56,793
We all here,

4676
02:05:57,140 --> 02:05:59,170
they were saying that at the
meeting I had at the Ice House,

4677
02:05:59,171 --> 02:06:02,740
how you guys are your fans all
drink and tip and that it's huge.

4678
02:06:02,770 --> 02:06:03,850
They're nice people.

4679
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:04,520
You know,

4680
02:06:04,520 --> 02:06:05,980
I think you put that out there,

4681
02:06:05,981 --> 02:06:06,580
man.

4682
02:06:06,580 --> 02:06:08,740
You put that out there and
people gravitate towards it.

4683
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:10,540
And I think this podcast,

4684
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:10,901
you know,

4685
02:06:10,901 --> 02:06:14,210
reinforces that and we
need people to think,

4686
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:16,630
to hear that you're supposed to
think a certain way that it's,

4687
02:06:16,710 --> 02:06:17,740
it's a good way to think.

4688
02:06:17,860 --> 02:06:18,071
You know,

4689
02:06:18,071 --> 02:06:20,410
I heard that thing you did with
Siri where you ask Siri that,

4690
02:06:20,411 --> 02:06:21,730
what is the meaning of life?

4691
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:23,620
Did you see the Brody Stevens thing?

4692
02:06:23,621 --> 02:06:23,831
Yeah.

4693
02:06:23,831 --> 02:06:24,760
That was beautiful.

4694
02:06:24,850 --> 02:06:25,091
You know,

4695
02:06:25,091 --> 02:06:28,060
it's crazy in every told you
a really good series said,

4696
02:06:28,061 --> 02:06:29,350
be nice to people.

4697
02:06:30,070 --> 02:06:32,340
Go for walks and what's good.

4698
02:06:32,930 --> 02:06:34,570
What was crazy is your fellow man,

4699
02:06:34,600 --> 02:06:35,800
Brody was just like,

4700
02:06:35,801 --> 02:06:36,760
right before that happened.

4701
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:37,211
Brody goes,

4702
02:06:37,211 --> 02:06:37,481
Brian,

4703
02:06:37,481 --> 02:06:37,991
do you walk?

4704
02:06:37,991 --> 02:06:38,201
I'm like,

4705
02:06:38,201 --> 02:06:38,560
no.

4706
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:38,951
And he goes,

4707
02:06:38,951 --> 02:06:39,850
you need to go on walks.

4708
02:06:39,851 --> 02:06:40,840
You need to read books.

4709
02:06:40,850 --> 02:06:41,591
He had a book.

4710
02:06:41,591 --> 02:06:41,801
He's like,

4711
02:06:41,801 --> 02:06:42,611
I'm reading the secrets.

4712
02:06:42,611 --> 02:06:43,860
I just make sure you read this.

4713
02:06:43,990 --> 02:06:44,291
And he's like,

4714
02:06:44,291 --> 02:06:45,370
don't eat fat foods.

4715
02:06:45,371 --> 02:06:47,140
Like he was giving me this
whole lecture and I'm like,

4716
02:06:47,141 --> 02:06:49,000
let's see what series it has to
say about the meaning of life.

4717
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:49,480
And I played,

4718
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:51,190
it was exactly what Brody said.

4719
02:06:51,191 --> 02:06:52,810
It gave me shivers like in the video,

4720
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:54,370
like you can watch the video on Vimeo.

4721
02:06:54,490 --> 02:06:57,190
I have like goosebumps and
we're all freaking the fuck out.

4722
02:06:57,220 --> 02:07:01,570
Maybe Brody Stevens now these on heavy
meds is tapping into the true meaning of

4723
02:07:01,571 --> 02:07:02,404
the universe.

4724
02:07:02,650 --> 02:07:04,030
Maybe he's got the answers.

4725
02:07:04,480 --> 02:07:06,040
Do we need to have Brody
Stevens on this podcast?

4726
02:07:06,041 --> 02:07:06,200
Yeah,

4727
02:07:06,200 --> 02:07:07,330
we need to go on his podcast.

4728
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:08,160
How about that?

4729
02:07:08,160 --> 02:07:09,100
But that squad studious,

4730
02:07:09,101 --> 02:07:09,960
I will come to death squads,

4731
02:07:09,961 --> 02:07:13,300
studios in Pasadena and tomorrow night
get your tickets because it will sell

4732
02:07:13,301 --> 02:07:13,511
out.

4733
02:07:13,511 --> 02:07:15,340
There's only 85 seats in this place.

4734
02:07:15,341 --> 02:07:16,174
Two shows,

4735
02:07:16,210 --> 02:07:17,530
eight and 10 30 is that what it does?

4736
02:07:17,590 --> 02:07:18,423
Uh,

4737
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:19,271
eight and 10,

4738
02:07:19,271 --> 02:07:20,040
I think

4739
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:20,790
eight and 10.

4740
02:07:20,790 --> 02:07:22,320
And we'll see you guys on Monday.

4741
02:07:22,321 --> 02:07:23,700
And as always,

4742
02:07:24,330 --> 02:07:25,350
we love you bitches,

4743
02:07:25,620 --> 02:07:25,891
you know,

4744
02:07:25,891 --> 02:07:26,280
we loved it.
