00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,220
Hello Freak bitches.
Look how big this Paris like,

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,370
wait,
wait to see this video.

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:07,170
You're going to shit your pants.
So it goes.

4
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:08,250
Go fullscreen,
Jamie.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,910
It's not going full screen.
Here you go.

6
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,070
You're going to shit your pants to 
Swedish man.

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,963
So this guy,
he sees it in the woods and he starts 

8
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,170
running up to him.
Whereas the volume buddy,

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,130
it's all wintery wise.
No sound.

10
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,620
It was definitely sound.
We got to hear the sound because the guy

11
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:27,420
screams at it.
Hold on.

12
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:29,700
We got to figure out how it worked.
Holy Shit.

13
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:32,250
I never saw.
I never even thought that would work.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,860
What's up?
What's definitely got sound?

15
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:40,620
So let's figure it out because you got 
to hear it because the guy goes,

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,240
well look,
I'll put his arms out to the side.

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,150
Look at the size of it.
It's running at him,

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,650
like running at him and he was able to 
scare it.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,890
He,
he reels back like he's scared.

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,940
Well he went for it,
you know,

21
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:57,020
look,
look bad.

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,290
I was like,
Oh shit,

23
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,363
look it up.
Look how big he is and look how much 

24
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:04,470
bigger that thing.
It's like four times,

25
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:06,630
five times bigger than him.
Oh my God.

26
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,390
Oh my God.
That makes me freak out.

27
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,130
If he had turned and Ronnie would have 
been eating.

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,690
Oh yeah,
for sure.

29
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,853
I mean,
the thing ran at him like it was dinner 

30
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:17,370
time.
I was that close to a bear.

31
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,970
Where in Alaska and Denali.
Jesus.

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,210
A grizzly.

33
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,090
Yup.
What the big ass grizzly.

34
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,163
We woke up in the morning and uh,
we were in back country for a couple of 

35
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:31,720
weeks just hiking and walking around and
um,

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,353
we got,
we woke up and we were making her 

37
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:39,840
breakfast and we look up on a ridge and 
there's this big ass bear.

38
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:41,580
This is September,
so it's like late,

39
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:42,414
you know,
it's like they were getting ready to 

40
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:48,171
hibernate and he's walking down the 
ridge and as we're packing up and uh,

41
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,963
you know,
up the Ridge is actually where we were 

42
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:53,430
cleaning our dishes and doing all this 
stuff.

43
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:54,264
And now we're back at camp.
We're breaking down to hike out and we 

44
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,600
see this thing go walking down.
Just dumb asses.

45
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:02,730
We're so lucky we didn't get eaten.
The Guy,

46
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,720
the,
uh,

47
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,553
we pack up and we just start walking in 
the same direction that the bear was 

48
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:09,060
going.

49
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,260
We were like,
he's not going to be going.

50
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,160
He,
he probably,

51
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:13,920
he's beaten us there.
So we're walking through these,

52
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,970
these reads,
these bamboo kind of little reads,

53
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,750
but there were only like six feet high 
and there's like eight of us,

54
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,793
maybe six of us and we're walking with 
our packs on and you just hear and you 

55
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:35,241
see the reeds separating slowly though,
like it's not coming fast.

56
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,340
Just like,
what the hell?

57
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,170
That's probably the bear.
We see that it's the bear and you know,

58
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:44,004
you're supposed to do with that guy did 
put your arms up or at least freeze and 

59
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:49,800
don't see everyone in the group took 
off.

60
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,890
That's the one thing I ran all my frozen
in the pose.

61
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,183
Me and my one friend,
like you're not supposed to do the we 

62
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,723
run at,
we're in and they take off with their 

63
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,010
backpacks,
but the bear,

64
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:06,844
thankfully just by a stroke of luck,
this thing was so fat and tired and the 

65
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:14,110
end of September he just wanted to go 
down low,

66
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,480
gets some more berries and take a 
snooze.

67
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,650
Was not interested in us at all.
He was just so lucky.

68
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:21,484
So lucky.
But I swear to God it was for me to the 

69
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,430
end of this table.
Yeah.

70
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,490
Well when they're,
when they're gathering berries,

71
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,353
that's when your safest.
They get in their head that that's what 

72
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:31,660
they want to eat and they eat a lot of 
bearings.

73
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,430
He did not.
He was not interested to fuck all that.

74
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,070
So close animals.

75
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,750
I mean I love the the there.
I think it's cool,

76
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,400
but God dammit,
they scare the shit out of me.

77
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,303
It was a video of these guys.
They're hanging out by this river and 

78
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:52,480
they have like a little lawn chair and 
this bear is enormous.

79
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:55,540
Crazy bear just walks up and sits down 
next to them.

80
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,400
Have you seen that one Jamie?
Close encounter with grit.

81
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,240
Grizzly bear casually walks up to people
and they just had to talk to them.

82
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:04,781
They're like,
hey man,

83
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:06,670
get the fuck out of here.
And the bar just gets up and leaves.

84
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,470
But I mean,
he's like a school bus.

85
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,830
It's like a minivan.
I always describe it like a minivan.

86
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,400
Did you find one?
Yeah.

87
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

88
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,921
This is it.
This is it.

89
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,120
Look at this.
Look at this.

90
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,840
Wow.
Look at the size of this.

91
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,300
Just sat next to his chair.

92
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,600
He just pulls up to his chair.
A beautiful animal.

93
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,730
They'll look at that thing.
Oh my.

94
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:29,260
There's the gorgeous dead do.
If that's you,

95
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,783
you can't do shit.
Can't do shit because you don't want to 

96
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:35,480
provoke it.
No,

97
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,500
no.
You definitely don't want to back up.

98
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,390
That thing is just chasing salmon right 
now.

99
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,710
Yeah.
You don't want to yell at it.

100
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,053
Yeah.
As long as you don't hit it doesn't 

101
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:45,090
think you're a threat.
They're really dumb,

102
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,470
right?
In their mind.

103
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,520
Yeah.
I'm not dumb.

104
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,540
Like.
No.

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,950
I mean like,
like dumb.

106
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:51,630
Like if they were a person they'd be 
retarded.

107
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,913
Right?

108
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,390
They're bold,
they're simple.

109
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,440
They're predators.
You know,

110
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:01,110
they get in their head like what they 
want to do.

111
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,890
Oh my God,
he's just sitting down.

112
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,740
This is awesome.
Just decided,

113
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:08,280
chill.
What a clear shot look at is,

114
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,470
look at his claws.
One Swipe.

115
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,673
I mean your faces off.
The guys filming this is 10 feet away 

116
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:17,194
from him.
He's right there and the eventually 

117
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:20,621
talks to him.
He was like,

118
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,454
Hey,
get out of here.

119
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,550
Like the bear looks at him like we 
really got close.

120
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:30,394
It is the bear.
Looks like a little annoyed for a 

121
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:34,090
second.
Do the thing.

122
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:36,880
Just wandered towards him.
Seriously.

123
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,860
Oh my God.

124
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,320
They're everywhere.
Oh my God.

125
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,990
Oh my God.
Now I don't even feel bad for that guy.

126
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:45,420
Back that up.
Like why should they go to the river?

127
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,763
This case,
sitting with a lawn chair by the river 

128
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,340
while one,
two.

129
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:51,480
Let's see.
Three,

130
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:52,620
four,
five,

131
00:05:52,621 --> 00:05:55,110
six.
And that one said,

132
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,680
oh my God.
Oh God,

133
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:01,340
there's a dozen baird's a dozen.
Massive grizzly bears.

134
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,760
Oh my God.
I'm so scared.

135
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,100
I got this more.
Look at those other two.

136
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:07,941
One,
two,

137
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:08,481
three,
four,

138
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:09,051
five,
six,

139
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:09,591
seven,
eight,

140
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:10,221
nine,
10,

141
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:11,510
11.
Oh my God.

142
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:14,600
How funny if you pull back and the guy 
with the camera is a bear.

143
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

144
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:22,430
That's amazing.
Oh my God.

145
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,590
They're the coolest animal.
My favorite animal.

146
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,090
Do you God damn cool until they're 
eating you?

147
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:27,680
Yeah,
and that's so cool.

148
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,573
Now.
