1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,470
Good morning everybody.
It's morning,

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,810
it's like a real job.
This is like a regular,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,000
like a regular job.
Uh,

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,180
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is brought to you.

5
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:14,800
Buy naturebox.
Naturebox is a,

6
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:19,801
a way that you can get delicious healthy
snacks delivered to your home or your 

7
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:22,500
office.
I haven't delivered to my house,

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,920
but uh,
they're the official snack of the Joe 

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:27,920
Rogan experience.
Now official.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,380
Really yummy stuff and you can get it as
good for you as you like.

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,370
Meaning,
you know,

12
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:34,880
you could order pretzels or if you want 
to,

13
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:37,380
you can go gluten free.
Low Sugar.

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,670
They have zero trans fats,
zero high fructose corn syrup,

15
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:44,010
nothing artificial.
And they're great.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,450
They taste delicious.
There's,

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,180
there's the ones that you guys will 
never see this show.

18
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,740
Raja cashews.
They're not getting in here.

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,170
They never make it.
They get to my house.

20
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,140
I opened the box,
I pop it open.

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,080
I said,
where the cashews give me them bitches.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,060
I never,
I'm never bringing them in here.

23
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:05,160
I just tell you right now Jamie,
never get any of them.

24
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:08,220
Sriracha cashews.
Unless they send like a triple order.

25
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,800
They're too good,
they're my favorite new snack,

26
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,140
but naturebox has free shipping anywhere
in the US and it's just an awesome.

27
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:19,440
I'll alternative to vending machines.
Snacks.

28
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:24,441
If you're at work and you're looking for
snacks all the time and you hit that 

29
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:27,120
vending machine and you're like,
what can I eat here?

30
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:29,010
That doesn't make me feel like a piece 
of shit.

31
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,180
Usually the answer is nothing.
You know,

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,200
maybe might go with potato chips over 
candy bars are fucking cookies or 

33
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:38,730
something stupid.
But you could,

34
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,310
uh,
you could eat fairly clean.

35
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,380
Um,
I mean,

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,420
you could,
you could get really clean where you 

37
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,521
could have like a,
they have these spicy pistachios that 

38
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:49,521
are delicious.

39
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:52,050
Or like I said,
you can go with pretzels,

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,260
but I recommend the Sriracha cashews.
Oh,

41
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,140
they're so good.
They're so good.

42
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:59,070
Dude.
Trust me,

43
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,340
it would be your favorite thing if I 
ever bought them in.

44
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,330
They'd never make it an end here,
son.

45
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,410
Um,
but naturebox,

46
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,040
uh,
just allows you to eat,

47
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,100
eat healthy and have it delivered to you
and cut out all the nonsense of that 

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,140
terrible feeling that you get when you 
eat crappy food.

49
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:22,270
And just get angry at yourself.
Um,

50
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,320
but they have a south Pacific plantain 
chips are another one.

51
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,330
Fantastic.
That never make it in here.

52
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,770
They just get devoured.
But go to naturebox.com/Rogan

And like I said,
they're the official snack food of the 

57
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:51,270
Joe Rogan experience.
Would you say enjoy it and enjoy it?

58
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,700

00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,340
we're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com.

61
00:02:56,341 --> 00:03:01,341
That is o n n I,
t on it is a human optimization website.

62
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,580
We sell you the tools that you can use 
to optimize your health,

63
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:07,960
your life,
your fitness.

64
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,700
We sell things like strength and 
conditioning equipment like kettle bells

65
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:16,390
and battle ropes and mace balls and 
these,

66
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:18,730
all these things that we use for steel,
maces,

67
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:23,731
all these things that we use for 
strength and conditioning workouts as 

68
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:26,320
well as healthy foods like hemp force 
protein powder.

69
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,280
I'm earth grown nutrients,
which is an excellent supplement to your

70
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,100
average diet.
The average healthy diet.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Most folks,
the reality is you don't quite get 

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,601
enough nutrients.
You don't quite get enough healthy 

73
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:47,460
protein,
don't quite get enough good foods and 

74
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,130
you're in your diet.
Most of us are too busy.

75
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:49,210
Most of us have jobs.

76
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,250
Most of us work well.
There's,

77
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,280
there's certain ways that you can add to
your diet where you can give yourself 

78
00:03:56,621 --> 00:04:01,621
the building blocks,
give yourself the tools that just the 

79
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:05,770
healthy nutrients that your body needs,
like earth grown nutrients in earth.

80
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:10,981
Grown nutrients is an awesome new 
supplements that we have that's a 

81
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:14,221
combination of a bunch of different 
things and antioxidant Brent blend that 

82
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:17,080
is all food based based on things like 
Peruvian purple,

83
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:18,940
corn,
ice fruit,

84
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,810
grape skin to a ton of different 
ingredients.

85
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:27,040
And it has a jaw dropping,
75,000

86
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,060
ORAC score.
The ORAC score is the antioxidant score.

87
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,820
Um,
all of that is explained on,

88
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,160
on it far better than I'll be able to 
explain it to you.

89
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,330
It also has a power green blend with 
Spirulina,

90
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,880
Alfalfa,
oat grass,

91
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,990
Kale,
barley,

92
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,250
wheat grass,
all these different things.

93
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,600
You can add it to a smoothie,
you can add it to just a glass of water 

94
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,681
and drink it,
and what it does is it gives you a 

95
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:55,681
little cushioning.

96
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:59,400
It gives you just sort of a nice 
supplement to cover the distance between

97
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,240
what most folks eat and what really your
body actually needs and deserves and 

98
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,880
what on it is designed for and what 
were.

99
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,510
What our goals are is to give you 
everything that you need to optimize 

100
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:22,170
your health and your fitness and just to
sort of bridge the gap between what the 

101
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:28,441
average person takes in their life and 
that he has in their body and what you 

102
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:33,691
really could actually use and need.
And when it comes to the strength and 

103
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:37,081
conditioning equipment,
we just buy the best shit we can 

104
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:39,130
possibly find.
Whether it's ab wheels or medicine balls

105
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:44,131
or kettle bells.
We try to find the highest quality 

106
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:47,941
stuff.
We try to find the stuff that we find 

107
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:50,641
that is the most beneficial for strength
and fitness and then we sell it to you 

108
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,720
at the most reasonable way.
Rates that we can.

109
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:58,140
If you use the Codeword Rogan,
you will save 10 percent off any and 

110
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,170
supplements yet on it.
That's o n n I t and use the codeword 

111
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:02,680
Rogan.
Alright,

112
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,330
Randall Carlson is here.
It's early in the morning.

113
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,940
Why fuck around Jamie.
Cue The music,

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
the Joe Rogan experience podcast by 
night trying to get the old brain fired 

115
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:24,930
up in the am.
It's very unusual that.

116
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,710
Well,
I usually get up around this last

117
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,690
time.
So do a podcast around this time.

118
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,540
Randall Carlson,
ladies and gentlemen,

119
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,560
uh,
I first met Randall quite a few years 

120
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:36,560
back in Atlanta.
He,

121
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,771
any,
it blew my brain open with a bunch of 

122
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:43,510
crazy talk about asteroids and just all 
kinds of crazy shit.

123
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:48,511
Sacred geometry.
And you're a very interesting cat and 

124
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:48,511
you,
uh,

125
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,380
you got a lot of cool stuff to talk 
about.

126
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:50,880
So,
uh,

127
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:53,110
I'm glad we finally got you here on the 
podcast.

128
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:58,111
You were a much requested guest on my 
online forum so folks know about you.

129
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,180
They know about your work and your ear.
Oh,

130
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,380
all these years of,
of uh,

131
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,140
and on anonymity.
And now I'm suddenly A.

132
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,920
I don't know if I'm ready for this job.
I think you're ready,

133
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:12,280
dude.
I,

134
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,530
I feel it from you.
It's,

135
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:14,950
this is your time to shine.
All right.

136
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:16,900
Joe,
Carmen from you.

137
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,000
That's all it just altered requires.

138
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,060
Well,
we had a great conversation when we 

139
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,471
first met and we did.
Ever since then I've been trying to 

140
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:25,990
figure out a way to,
to repeat it online.

141
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,500
There's videos of us actually having 
parts of the conversation,

142
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:32,230
but it's,
there's music in the background.

143
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:35,290
We're at the comedy club and uh,
yeah.

144
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:35,890
So,
uh,

145
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,290
um,
you,

146
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,620
you,
you first,

147
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,660
uh,
I don't remember what we first started 

148
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,511
talking about,
but you blew my mind when you started 

149
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:45,630
talking to me about the Holocene crater 
and um,

150
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,850
that this pretty distinct evidence that 
there's been more than one events on 

151
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,710
this earth besides the one that 
everybody knows about the 65 million 

152
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,371
year ago,
one with a big chunk of rock hit the 

153
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:06,811
Yucatan and killed the dinosaurs,
but there's been a series of those and 

154
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:10,750
that these things may very well be 
responsible for a lot of the cataclysmic

155
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,870
stories that are in epic of Gilgamesh.

156
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,900
The Noah's Ark Story,
all these different fables and tales of 

157
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,400
ancient traditions may be based on these
cataclysmic disasters and now since 

158
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:29,221
we've spoken science has started to 
validate a lot of your theories and 

159
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:34,111
ideas even more substantially the 
discovery of this nuclear glass that 

160
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:37,720
they find all throughout Europe and 
Asia.

161
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,750
Tell me about all this stuff.
Well,

162
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,610
did you catch the thing about a month 
ago?

163
00:08:42,611 --> 00:08:44,620
Um,
I think it was in the New York Times.

164
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:49,030
Most of the major newspapers are a group
of former NASA astronauts and scientists

165
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,060
came out,
said we were new evidence was showing 

166
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,770
it.
We're probably somewhere between three 

167
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:56,770
and 10 times more likely to encounter

168
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:00,780
things than anybody had previously been 
estimating even five to 10 years ago.

169
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,820
It was a pretty major article in most of
the mainstream media.

170
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,810
You mean by encounter things by getting 
hit by something?

171
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:10,650
Yes,
of course.

172
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,860
You remember what happened on February 
15th of 2013,

173
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:15,780
right?
What happened on February 15th?

174
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,810
Was that very Russian?
Yeah.

175
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,060
In.
What was really interesting about that 

176
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,101
is because everybody was at least people
who are interested in this sort of 

177
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:28,461
thing.
We're kind of looking to the sky anyway 

178
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:30,261
because this was the closest I'm pass of
a of an asteroid.

179
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,700
I'm coming within 17,000
miles of the earth at the same time.

180
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:40,701
This object totally out of the blue came
in and exploded over Chelyabinsk 

181
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:45,440
Siberia.
So it was very interesting and 

182
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,200
coincidentally,
if there are such things as coincidences

183
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:51,530
that here when we're expecting this very
close fly by of an asteroid,

184
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:56,640
a near Earth asteroid coming actually 
within our geosynchronous satellites,

185
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,670
within the orbit of those satellites at 
the same time that this object is coming

186
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,960
within 17,000
miles of the earth,

187
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:09,050
suddenly unexpectedly,
here comes the second object and 

188
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,960
explodes with the force of about a,
uh,

189
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,880
I believe it was about a 50 kilo ton 
nuclear weapon.

190
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,990
And of course it had exploded.
I'm quite high about 20,

191
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,510
I believe,
about 18 to 20 miles in the atmosphere.

192
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,710
And so it didn't kill anybody.
However,

193
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,120
the thing to bear in mind is if that 
object had been just a little bit bigger

194
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,390
or it had been a little bit dancer or 
the angle of approach had been a little 

195
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,141
steeper.
Instead of 1600 injuries are probably 

196
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:41,580
could have been 1600 or more casualties 
at that point.

197
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:44,400
I think the world would have really sat 
up and taken notice.

198
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,630
But,
um,

199
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,080
it was basically just a warning shot.
It seems to me that our knowledge of 

200
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,690
asteroids and meteor impacts and things 
of that nature,

201
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,280
these are our actual experience on it is
based on this short window that we call 

202
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:03,720
human history,
which is for the earth,

203
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,900
such a brief,
tiny blink of an eye.

204
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,760
It is,
although I like to point out there that,

205
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,150
you know,
when you say human history,

206
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:13,480
we're talking,
you know,

207
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,300
4,500
to 5,000

208
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:15,810
years ago.

209
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,370
Generally,
I think most historians of,

210
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:25,371
of ancient history will usually say that
the emergence of cuneiform writing in 

211
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:31,350
the Middle East marks the beginning of 
official recorded history.

212
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,920
But you've got to bear in mind,
we,

213
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:39,921
modern humans have been around a lot 
longer than that right now as far as the

214
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:43,530
hard evidence goes to switch,
which is what I like to refer to.

215
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,170
Um,
which means skeletal remains,

216
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:49,950
skeletal remains of humans.
That as far as we know,

217
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:53,040
are basically no different than than 
modern humans.

218
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,290
If you put flesh on him and dressed him 
up in modern clothes and they walked 

219
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:02,011
down the street,
you wouldn't think they were anything 

220
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:04,141
unusual.
Modern skeletal skeletal remains with 

221
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,770
modern humans are now dating between 
$150,

222
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:07,390
180,000
years.

223
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,080
So when you think about that,
compared to what we actually have our 

224
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,410
have our record of history or record of 
history is one 20th,

225
00:12:16,411 --> 00:12:21,411
one slash 25th one 30th of the actual 
time that we humans have been here now.

226
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,840
Now it could be that modern humans have 
actually been here much longer than than

227
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:26,980
180,000
years.

228
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:31,981
We have no way of knowing at what point 
we moderns first appeared on this 

229
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:34,660
planet.
But when you think of 180,000

230
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:37,450
years compared to let's say in round 
numbers,

231
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:38,530
5,000
years,

232
00:12:38,531 --> 00:12:41,410
it means that there's a lot of the human
story missing.

233
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:47,250
And the thing that's always intrigued me
is that given the assumption that they 

234
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,850
would have had the same intelligence as 
us,

235
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:54,910
the same,
they've got the same brain case size,

236
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:59,911
the same cranial capacity.
So one would assume that with brains as 

237
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:01,860
big as our modern brains,
they were able to think they had four,

238
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:05,590
thought they were able to plan ahead,
presumably have a,

239
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:07,060
uh,
you know,

240
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:12,061
have some kind of a tradition that could
be passed on from generation to 

241
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:15,451
generation and accumulated learning.
But what we see is that there's 

242
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:20,620
basically no record to speak of,
of what people were doing culturally.

243
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,310
Um,
and,

244
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:27,390
and that has led a lot of scientists to 
assume that for all those tens of 

245
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:31,630
thousands of years and hundreds and 
hundreds of generations,

246
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,200
that people were essentially living 
nothing more than a subsistence,

247
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,470
a kind of a hunter gatherer existence.
Right?

248
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,040
But what they haven't taken into account
is the extremity of some of the global 

249
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:48,490
changes that have occurred in,
in the interval that we humans have been

250
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:53,491
here.
And as we go through our discussion 

251
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:56,341
today and it will pull up some images,
I think you'll begin to get an idea of 

252
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,710
how extreme and how sweeping some of 
these changes have been and why in the 

253
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:04,750
aftermath of those changes,
we wouldn't,

254
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:09,250
shouldn't expect to find a whole lot of 
hard cultural evidence.

255
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:15,150
Because what you'll hopefully begin to 
appreciate is that we're some of these 

256
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:20,130
events of the scale and magnitude that 
have happened probably a dozen or more 

257
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,590
times in the 150 or 200,000
years that we've been here.

258
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:28,950
Were those events to occur today.
Ten thousand years from now I'm 

259
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,420
archeologists would be sifting through 
the,

260
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,200
through the rubble looking for any kind 
of evidence that we had ever been here.

261
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,650
And that's the thing we have to get into
our consciousness,

262
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,610
you know.
And well I guess if there's any,

263
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:45,611
any implication of the work that I've 
been doing is that we certainly can't 

264
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:50,041
take our president position for granted.
It seems very difficult for us to put 

265
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:57,191
into perspective numbers like 10,000
or a hundred thousand or a million.

266
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:02,650
We know that the universe has been 
around allegedly for 14 billion,

267
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:08,590
so the earth is four point 6 billion.
Those numbers are so weird to us.

268
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,260
They don't register.
They're just like,

269
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:16,130
I know 4 billion is more than 400,000,
but both of them are alien.

270
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,270
You know what I mean?
It's like,

271
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,770
I don't think we could really wrap our 
head around the idea that 10,000

272
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:26,771
years is such an incredible length of 
time that if you left a car out for 

273
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:29,720
10,000
years within,

274
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,690
you know,
three or 4,000,

275
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,730
it would be absorbed completely by the 
Earth Joe within three or four 

276
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:36,730
centuries.

277
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,310
Really?
Oh yeah.

278
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,210
I mean,
if you look at,

279
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,360
I mean steel body cars I remember very 
well as a kid,

280
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:46,340
not far from where we lived.
There was a auto junk auto graveyard and

281
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:51,341
um,
all the teenagers around there who were 

282
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:52,130
racing cars back in the fifties and 
crashing them up and everything,

283
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:57,131
they seem to end up there.
And as a kid I used to like to go and 

284
00:15:57,131 --> 00:15:57,830
kind of hang around there and play in 
some of the old cars,

285
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,640
but they were already after sitting out 
there for 10 years,

286
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,310
I mean already well underway to,
to rusting away.

287
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:07,880
I mean,
once that process of oxidation begins to

288
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,270
take place,
it accelerates not far from where I live

289
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:16,271
in Atlanta.
There was an old iron bridge that had 

290
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:20,030
been built around the 18 nineties and 
it's no longer there,

291
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,490
but by the,
by the 19 eighties,

292
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,380
it had almost rusted to nothing.

293
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,930
And within a century it almost rusted to
nothing.

294
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,780
Yeah,
metal does not last long.

295
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,710
When exposed to the elements.
There was an interesting series of shows

296
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,380
a few years ago.
Um,

297
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,070
I think it was,
it had to do with the idea of if,

298
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:43,090
what if humans just suddenly depart?
What if we took humans out of the 

299
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,960
equation?
What would happen to all of the 

300
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,881
infrastructure left behind just under 
normal kind of gradual listic change 

301
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:51,920
that we're used to within the last few 
centuries.

302
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,950
The upshot of it was the 10,000
years from now,

303
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,460
it's pretty much gone.
You know,

304
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,930
I mean if you look at the,
the,

305
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,980
the great buildings that make up all the
metropolis metropolitan areas now of the

306
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:10,121
world,
most of them are steel frame structures 

307
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:13,960
and they're clothed in a skin that,
that will keep the elements out maybe 

308
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:17,000
for a half a century.
But without maintenance,

309
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:17,510
I mean,
you know,

310
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:18,210
that the,
that,

311
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,490
the Golden Gate Bridge up in San 
Francisco is constantly ongoing,

312
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:27,170
undergoing maintenance because if you 
stopped maintaining it immediately,

313
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:32,171
it starts decaying immediately.
It starts rusting and interesting.

314
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,970
If you think about,
if we suddenly,

315
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,210
if humans left the planet 10,000
years from now,

316
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,950
some,
some,

317
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:42,620
uh,
interstellar anthropologists arrive,

318
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,010
what would they see that would indicate 
that we had been here?

319
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:48,650
What do you think would still be left 
after 10,000

320
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,040
years?
There's actually two things that

321
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,040
they named in this particular program.
I bet you can guess one of them out 

322
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,530
rushmore.
Mount Rushmore.

323
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:56,460
Good,
good guests.

324
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:57,390
Yes.
That's one of them.

325
00:17:57,391 --> 00:18:00,870
And of course the great pyramid with the
other one and that's it.

326
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,940
You know,
everything else has gone.

327
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,960
Wow.
Now,

328
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,320
when you,
when you now begin to factor in,

329
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,380
the thing that I've been basically 
working with is the idea that we have 

330
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,150
these intermittent,
I call them nonlinearities.

331
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,430
A discontinuity is within the normal 
orderly progression of things.

332
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,320
The catastrophes,
if you will,

333
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,480
superimpose a few of those in the 
process and basically 5,000,

334
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,830
10,000
years from now,

335
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,130
you're not going to find much to show 
that we had been here.

336
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,540
That's incredible.
And when you see structures like a go,

337
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:41,541
Beckley tapping,
which is within the last couple of 

338
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:41,541
decades,
been on earth in,

339
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:46,400
in Turkey,
which has really thrown a giant monkey 

340
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,080
wrench into the timeline of the hunter 
gatherer,

341
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:50,420
a transition into the modern 
agricultural,

342
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,480
a city.

343
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:56,970
We were in a weird state because people 
are starting to dig up these things and 

344
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:57,480
go.
Beckley.

345
00:18:57,481 --> 00:19:02,481
Tempe was a completely unknown structure
until this one farmer or hurt or had 

346
00:19:03,211 --> 00:19:04,730
found a stone.
And,

347
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,740
uh,
started to unearthing it and then 

348
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,121
realized it was these huge stone pillars
of an unknown civilization carved with 

349
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,030
three dimensional shapes of these 
animals.

350
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:17,520
Some of them weren't,
aren't even native to the area.

351
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:22,521
So it's incredibly confusing and 
purposely covered up 14 to 12 to 14,000

352
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:30,411
years ago,
which means that who knows how long it 

353
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:33,861
was there before it could have been 
several thousand years old when they 

354
00:19:33,861 --> 00:19:37,371
decided to cover it up,
but it was purposely filled in and 

355
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:40,410
enormous area purposely filled in 
somewhere around 12,000

356
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:45,411
years ago.
Could it have been purposely covered up 

357
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:48,261
in order to protect it and preserve it 
could be right that we were hoping or 

358
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:50,280
they were hoping rather than someone 
like us would come along,

359
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,050
not us,
like definitely not me.

360
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:57,410
Maybe you know,
someone would come along and uncover it 

361
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:57,630
and then go,
Whoa,

362
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:58,240
what's,
uh,

363
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,260
what's this all about?
Like maybe they knew that there were 

364
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,700
going to be moments in time where these 
things happen,

365
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:10,701
these impacts these asteroidal impacts 
and that there needed to be some sort 

366
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:13,950
of,
a way of keeping track or some sort of a

367
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:18,951
way of preserving well that that would 
probably be one way of preserving it for

368
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:24,111
sure.
And the other thing would be just like 

369
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:24,111
you mentioned the two things,
Mount Rushmore,

370
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:25,110
integrate pyramid,
of course,

371
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:30,111
are both built of stone,
which is obviously much more durable 

372
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:34,110
than steel or you know,
the fabricated materials that we're,

373
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,900
we're making today.
Even plastics,

374
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,570
plastics are gonna Degrade over a few 
millennium.

375
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,170
But if you want to preserve something 
for Malania,

376
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,320
make it out of stone and making 
monumental.

377
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,010
Um,
and you know,

378
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,980
we're looking at at something like,
you just made an interesting point about

379
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,750
it.
Could we,

380
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,550
how much previous to,
to the,

381
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,820
to the burial edit actually been there.
And you know,

382
00:20:57,821 --> 00:21:01,630
it's difficult to dates don't.
The way you would dates known is,

383
00:21:01,631 --> 00:21:03,400
you know,
you can use various,

384
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:04,890
um,
oh,

385
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,550
cosmic magenic ways where when you 
expose stone to atmosphere,

386
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,700
it's going to accumulate cosmic rays 
which caused changes within the stone 

387
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,620
that can actually be measured.
But if it's buried,

388
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:21,520
it's not going to be subject to cosmic 
rays so that you can't date it that way.

389
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,020
Which you would probably have to do is 
date.

390
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,650
Find some organic material within the 
soil matrix or matrix of material around

391
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:32,410
it and date that material,
but even there,

392
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:37,411
see that's not going to tell.
That's only going to give you a minimum 

393
00:21:37,411 --> 00:21:37,411
date,
so in other words,

394
00:21:37,411 --> 00:21:41,640
the structure's there for who knows how 
long they decided to bury it and they 

395
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,331
bring in the material and bury it,
and if some organic material is in that 

396
00:21:45,331 --> 00:21:49,081
soil,
it's not necessarily going to be 

397
00:21:49,081 --> 00:21:49,960
indicative of the age of the stone 
structure itself.

398
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,960
It's going to be indicative of the time 
at which it was buried and how did they 

399
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:58,030
determine that it was buried at 12,000
years ago.

400
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:03,031
Was it the uniformity of the depth of.
I would assume now I haven't made a 

401
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:07,861
study of Go Beckley tappy yet.
I'm hoping that when I get a chance to 

402
00:22:07,861 --> 00:22:11,041
hang out with Graham Hancock,
I'm going to get filled in on all the 

403
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:14,401
details of that.
I don't know specifically about that 

404
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,830
other monuments.
I do suspect that,

405
00:22:17,831 --> 00:22:20,830
you know,
name Pedang is probably very old.

406
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,990
Seen Indonesia,
a lot of the monumental stone work that 

407
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,330
we find like a bailed back where you 
have these monstrous,

408
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:34,060
a megaliths probably go back to 
pleistocene times.

409
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:39,061
And when I say Pleistocene,
I'm talking about the period from like 

410
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:42,810
10,000
years back about two and a half million 

411
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,211
years ago.
The time during which there has been 

412
00:22:45,211 --> 00:22:47,050
this succession of glacial ages and 
Interglacial Ages.

413
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,020
Um,
and you know,

414
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,790
you mentioned the term policy,
we've talked about that.

415
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:55,150
Holocene is essentially the modern 
geological epoch.

416
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,480
We've been in this Holocene epoch for 
generally they say 10,000

417
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:05,881
years in rough numbers,
although it's becoming much more 

418
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:08,971
precisely dated now.
You'll find a lot of references in the 

419
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:12,421
scientific literature that says,
gives the date 11 point six or 11,600

420
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:15,550
years as being the onset of the 
Holocene.

421
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:20,200
Which is an interesting date for me 
because I don't know if you've ever read

422
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:23,770
plato in his accounts of Atlantis.
There's two of his dialogues,

423
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,800
courteous and tomatoes in which he 
describes Atlantis and he gives the 

424
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,960
dating and near a,
at least on three separate occasions.

425
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,210
And he always places that you know,
there's this whole success,

426
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,240
the whole lineage of the story goes back
to Solon,

427
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:43,450
who was a historical character,
unauthenticated historical character who

428
00:23:43,451 --> 00:23:48,451
lived at about 600 BC and he was a law 
giver and poet in Athens and due to 

429
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:54,461
political pressures and stuff,
he went into a 10 year exile and during 

430
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:57,270
that 10 year exile he went to Egypt and 
it was there that he presumably would've

431
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:01,730
heard the tale of Atlantis from elderly 
Egyptian priests.

432
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,750
And he was told and came back and then 
told the story to his grandson who told 

433
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:13,601
it again to,
to several individuals before it 

434
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:16,580
actually got to socrates and Plato who 
presumably wrote it down.

435
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,090
But what it's interesting is that in in 
Plato's account,

436
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:25,091
he,
he gives the dating for the demise of 

437
00:24:25,091 --> 00:24:27,641
Atlantis as 9,000
years prior to solange exile to Egypt.

438
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,330
Well,
given that,

439
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:31,970
that took place and give or take a 
decade or two,

440
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,550
600 BC,
we go back,

441
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:36,230
that's 2,600
years ago.

442
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,480
Okay.
Add that to the 9,000

443
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:40,280
years.
And we've got 11,600

444
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:43,220
years ago now,
according to Plato's account,

445
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,640
he says that it was shortly after this 
great war between the Atlantic eons and 

446
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:53,930
to produce Athenians,
that there was this tremendous cataclysm

447
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:59,230
and Atlanta sunk beneath the waves.
So he's giving that date at 11,600

448
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:05,561
years ago.
We now know from the scientific record 

449
00:25:05,561 --> 00:25:06,680
that at 11,000,
600 years ago,

450
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,720
there was a major climate transition and
there was a catastrophic warming spike 

451
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,810
that was associated with a,
a mega scale meltdown event of the great

452
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:19,970
ice sheets that were covering North 
America.

453
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:25,420
It was this event at 11,600,
essentially jerked the planet out of the

454
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:31,180
depths of this ice agent.
It had been in for thousands and 

455
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,481
thousands of years with that melting.
You had a rapid rise of sea level.

456
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,880
Um,
so it's very interesting that the date 

457
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,780
that he gives is precisely now the date 
that,

458
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,240
um,
that the scientists are giving for this 

459
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,580
transition from what's called the 
younger dryas.

460
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,750
I think Graham has mentioned that,
um,

461
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,890
in,
in some of your interviews with him that

462
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:00,940
the younger dryas,
which was this climate spasm that ended 

463
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,631
the last ice age.
So if we look at the chronology of 

464
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:06,350
events around 26,000
years ago,

465
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:11,860
we were in the later phases of a what 
appears to have been an interglacial 

466
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,840
period,
not too much different from what we're 

467
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,200
in now around 26,000
years ago.

468
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:23,350
The climate rapidly degenerated and 
these massive glaciers had expanded,

469
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,760
um,
during this,

470
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:27,700
what they call the final phase or,
or,

471
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,390
or,
um,

472
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:33,430
the late Wisconsin,
they refer to it because initially they 

473
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,880
were looking for this evidence into 
state of Wisconsin.

474
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,150
So they,
they named the,

475
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,600
this last final phase,
the late Wisconsin.

476
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,060
So around 26,000
years ago,

477
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:44,250
we see the,
the launching of this final phase of the

478
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:48,750
ice age.
The late Wisconsin then at around 13,000

479
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:50,640
years ago is the dates are now giving 
it.

480
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,120
There was this enormous spasm of warming
and this seemed to be associated with 

481
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,110
rapid melting and the first real rapid 
sea level rise.

482
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:06,290
Okay.
What happened is after a very short 

483
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,051
interval of time,
the climate snap back into the full 

484
00:27:09,051 --> 00:27:12,450
depths of glacial cold.
Now what had happened was if you go back

485
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:14,010
18,000
years ago,

486
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,610
this was the coldest part of the ice 
age.

487
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:20,310
I mean,
this was bitterly cold period of time.

488
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,990
Um,
where I live in,

489
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:29,020
in Georgia was the forests that grew 
there were like the forest you find in 

490
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:33,321
Canada now you had Tundra up in Northern
Kentucky and Southern Idaho Tundra in 

491
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:35,940
southern southern Ohio.

492
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,570
Excuse me.
Um,

493
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,860
so it was a really,
really different climate.

494
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:46,100
And once you got to northern Ohio and 
the northern United States where New 

495
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,160
York City is,
Chicago,

496
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:49,170
the Great Lakes,
the Dakotas,

497
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,360
all of that was under this massive ice 
sheet.

498
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:55,620
Thousands of feet thick.
When you go up into Canada over Canada,

499
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,710
the ice was up to two miles thick.
I mean,

500
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:03,730
think about that two miles thick of ice.
And it reached from the Atlantic to the 

501
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:08,810
Pacific Ocean and from the northern 
United States as far south as the 45th 

502
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,960
parallel all the way up to the Arctic 
circle.

503
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,710
Now that is a drastically different 
world,

504
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:19,220
bare in mind too,
that with that much ice piled up on the 

505
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,810
surface of the land,
sea levels which contribute to dewater,

506
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,870
that formed that ice had to go down and 
it's now well documented that sea levels

507
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,810
during the depth of the ice were at 
least 400 feet lower than now,

508
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,810
which,
which means that the continental shelves

509
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:36,390
of the planet,
we're basically exposed now,

510
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,700
um,
where I live in Georgia.

511
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,440
If you go out and stand right now on the
beach,

512
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:45,441
like a Cumberland Island,
which is beautiful wilderness preserve 

513
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:48,030
your stand there on the beach.
If you were suddenly transported back to

514
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:53,031
the depths of the ice age,
you'd be in the middle of a boreal 

515
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,371
forest,
meaning a northern forest with spruce 

516
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:55,371
trees,
large trees,

517
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:58,881
alder trees to kind of trees.
You find now in the northern United 

518
00:28:58,881 --> 00:28:58,881
States,
Canada,

519
00:28:58,881 --> 00:29:01,230
that area and the beach wouldn't have 
been anywhere,

520
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,690
anywhere close.
It would have been another 50,

521
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:07,320
7,500
miles further to the east because as the

522
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:08,820
sea level drops,
what happens?

523
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,080
It recedes,
right?

524
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:15,210
And so when this final phase of the ice 
age came on,

525
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,310
sea levels begin to drop,
and so what it did was it exposed all of

526
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:25,311
the shallow marine ecologies that,
that redeemed all of the continents to 

527
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,460
the atmosphere,
and basically would have caused enormous

528
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:30,810
ecological havoc.

529
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,710
Well then within a millennia or so,
the forests had,

530
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,770
had expanded and had now grown out.
So now off the eastern seaboard of the 

531
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,770
United States,
they constantly will find the remains of

532
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,990
tree stumps and forests that had been 
growing.

533
00:29:46,991 --> 00:29:48,310
They're 14,
15,

534
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:49,690
16,000
years ago.

535
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,200
Now the ice begins to melt.
Sea level begins to rise.

536
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,680
Now it's important to realize that if we
look at the way modern civilization has 

537
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,500
evolved,
what do we see is,

538
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:01,000
where did the first city show up?
Don't,

539
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,270
aren't they mostly trading cities that 
show up up there?

540
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:09,271
Port cities,
they show up along the confluence of 

541
00:30:09,271 --> 00:30:12,871
rivers.
They show up where rivers meet the 

542
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:12,871
oceans,
they show up on the,

543
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:13,180
on the coastlines.
Okay?

544
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:15,820
So if you had major cities during the 
ice age,

545
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,690
as Graham has pointed out,
there are now 400 feet underwater.

546
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Wow.
So you begin to appreciate when you 

547
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,140
begin to really look at the history of 
our planet,

548
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:30,730
what you realize is that it's just 
almost unimaginably dynamic.

549
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,660
This an alteration from a,
from an interglacial to a glacial age is

550
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:40,661
an extreme process.
And so I guess the upshot of it is,

551
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:43,390
is that you know,
when,

552
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:47,080
when we look now at the climate record 
that we have in hand now,

553
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,740
which has been pretty much reconstructed
with a fair amount of accuracy back to 

554
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
about 400,000
years.

555
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:58,060
And these are primarily based on ice 
cores extracted from Greenland,

556
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,630
extracted from Antarctica,
extracted from mountain glaciers,

557
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:05,490
and and most mostly mostly Antarctic 
agreement.

558
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,690
No,
when you pull out that ice core,

559
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,790
it's layered.
You think,

560
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,920
think,
think of cutting down a tree and looking

561
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:16,921
at the annual layers where you can 
actually count the number of layers in 

562
00:31:16,921 --> 00:31:19,480
a,
in a cross section of a tree log,

563
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:20,770
and you'll know how old it is.
Right?

564
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,150
Well,
it's very similar in a,

565
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,600
in a nice court,
you've got layers and layers because 

566
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:28,600
each year they're snow.

567
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,800
That falls,
it gets compressed into Fern,

568
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:31,000
F,
r a n,

569
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:36,001
which is the transitional phase between 
snow and glacial ice and it eventually 

570
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:41,071
gets compressed into glacial ice and 
when you look at a cross section of the 

571
00:31:41,071 --> 00:31:41,290
ice core,
you'll see these find layers in there,

572
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,420
right?
So they can go back and they can look at

573
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:48,421
these layers.
They can count the layers and there's a 

574
00:31:48,421 --> 00:31:49,900
lot of things going on in these layers.
Oxygen isotopes are are critical one for

575
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:54,930
for ascertaining climate changes because
oxygen isotopes are a function of 

576
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:58,720
temperature and we have a graph here.
We'll pull up in a minute.

577
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,750
We can actually look at that,
but what we see is that the climate has 

578
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,840
constantly oscillated back and forth and
when we look at the Holocene,

579
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:12,870
going back 10,000
years and then we take that 

580
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,310
comparatively and we go back 250 to 
400,000

581
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:20,311
years,
we can now begin to reconstruct these 

582
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:21,820
intervals of glacial periods.

583
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,940
Interglacial.
And here's the thing that should be 

584
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,911
sobering to,
to everybody on the planet today as we 

585
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:30,940
think about climate change and all of 
this.

586
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:35,941
Because obviously it's constantly in the
news and all the longest interglacial 

587
00:32:36,161 --> 00:32:40,700
period now on record for at least last 
quarter million years.

588
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:45,730
The longest one,
the longest unbroken period of 

589
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,090
interglacial warmth is the Holocene.
The one we're in now,

590
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,920
we've already exceeded by several 
millennia,

591
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,060
the longest previous period of 
interglacial warmth.

592
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:00,890
I don't hear them talking about that.
I don't hear Al Gore talking about that.

593
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,850
I don't hear anybody talking about that 
in mainstream media,

594
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:08,240
but it's hard scientific fact.
Yeah.

595
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:13,241
We would be shitting our pants way more 
if it was a global cooling than if it 

596
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,740
was a global warming,
and let me tell her under.

597
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,900
We're going to pull up another graph 
will pull up a graph in a minute which 

598
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,310
shows you that even within the last 
couple of thousand years,

599
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,690
periods of global cooling have not been 
pleasant times.

600
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:31,910
Periods of global warming is when we see
human population expanding.

601
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:36,560
When we see cultural advancement,
when we see lifespans increasing,

602
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,920
when we see infant mortality,
decreasing periods of global cooling are

603
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:45,080
when we see populations going into 
decline.

604
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,210
When we see lifespans diminishing,
you know,

605
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:55,130
we had a period of global cooling that 
began between 5:36

606
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:57,100
and 5:40
a d.

607
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,560
It was this period of global cooling 
that launched what we know of the dark 

608
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,550
ages,
and this has now been well documented by

609
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:11,560
dendrochronologist.
Mike Bailey is one of the leaders of 

610
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,581
this who's been looking at the climate 
changes of the last couple thousand 

611
00:34:15,581 --> 00:34:19,250
years as preserved in the tree ring 
record between 5:36

612
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:21,160
and about 5:44
a d.

613
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:27,100
We find that forest growth in the 
northern hemisphere almost came to a 

614
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,520
stop and one of the consequences of that
was this,

615
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,050
it was associated with a global cooling 
and for multiple years running,

616
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,080
there were agricultural collapses were 
because of the cold and damp that came 

617
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,780
on with this.

618
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,120
Um,
you know,

619
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:48,130
the,
the historical record is interesting 

620
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:48,350
because you read some of these accounts 
that were preserved from that period.

621
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:52,040
They talk about weeks at a time where 
they couldn't see the sun.

622
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:57,220
They talk about when it did show up,
it was just a feeble imitation of 

623
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,440
itself.
They talk about,

624
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,960
you know,
years with no summer basically,

625
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:05,590
so what you had was succession of crop 
failures that lead to people becoming 

626
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:11,381
malnourished once they become 
malnourished or immune systems became 

627
00:35:11,381 --> 00:35:15,731
weakened and in 5:40
to add about six years after this well 

628
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:20,990
documented transition occurred.
We had the onset of the justinian plague

629
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:26,260
which wiped out a third of the 
population of Europe and it took 300 

630
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,370
years to recover from that.
And it didn't.

631
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,400
We didn't recover from it until the 
climate shifted again and we went into 

632
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,571
what's known as the medieval warm period
and the medieval warm period was the 

633
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:41,640
time when the scandinavians were farming
on the west coast of Greenland,

634
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,700
where now it's perennially frozen and 
for about the next couple of hundred 

635
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:51,801
years,
the climate was according to some 

636
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:54,090
researchers and some scientists as much 
as two degrees warmer than now.

637
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,370
And do you think it had to have been 
warmer if,

638
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,850
if they were farming in greenland where 
it is now?

639
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:05,570
Frozen ground?
It had to have been warmer and one of 

640
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,830
the things that happened with was with 
this warming,

641
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:13,220
you had an expansion of the growing 
season and you also had the latitude 

642
00:36:14,671 --> 00:36:18,390
belt at which viable farming or 
agriculture could be.

643
00:36:18,391 --> 00:36:21,630
Practice shifted three to 400 miles 
north of where it had been,

644
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:27,020
which meant that for the first time,
England actually had a flourishing wine 

645
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,921
industry which didn't exist previously 
and it has only existed until recent 

646
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:36,411
times because of genetically modified 
crops is now allowing them to grow 

647
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:40,650
grapes where they haven't been able to 
grow wine grapes until we go back to the

648
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:45,651
medieval warm period.
So what happened was now there was a lot

649
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:47,430
of food for people to eat,
right?

650
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,080
People got healthier.

651
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:52,590
A human population began to increase,
right?

652
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,960
We begin to accumulate wealth.
We begin to,

653
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:00,020
to carry on commerce and trade.
After this 300 years of dark ages were 

654
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,870
learning receded into the,
into the monasteries.

655
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,040
And life was very unpleasant,
very short,

656
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:09,600
very brutal,
very unpleasant.

657
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,420
Now we had this warming period,
okay?

658
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,780
With the growth,
the expansion of agriculture and the 

659
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:17,890
abundant food supply.
And the,

660
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:22,970
um,
prolific harvest people were getting 

661
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:22,970
strong,
healthy again,

662
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,090
a statute and it's been well documented 
that during this two or 300 years of the

663
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:32,091
medieval warming period,
human stature actually increased by 

664
00:37:32,091 --> 00:37:33,300
inches.
Average human size,

665
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:34,560
okay.
Um,

666
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,880
by 1150,
this accumulated wealth that had ensued 

667
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:43,830
from the,
the,

668
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:44,430
the,
the,

669
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:49,290
the benign climate of the medieval warm 
period is what allowed the,

670
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:54,291
um,
the Great Cathedral building era to 

671
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:57,651
ensue which began between 1130 and 1150 
add and what we see as eco magnificent 

672
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,160
cathedrals.

673
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,160
If you've been to Europe and visited any
of the Kathy put that on your to do 

674
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,031
list,
get there and look at some of these 

675
00:38:08,031 --> 00:38:10,581
extraordinary works of art that were 
built during the high gothic or high 

676
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:13,230
middle ages between,
like I said,

677
00:38:13,231 --> 00:38:18,150
about 1150 and the early 13 hundreds.
They built 80,

678
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:22,380
about 80 of these gigantic magnificent 
cathedrals that,

679
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,440
that required the organizing of,
of thousands of highly,

680
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:34,320
highly skilled craftsman armies of 
workers and craftsman.

681
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,990
You had stone masons and carpenters and 
glaziers and astronomers and GM 

682
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:43,480
attritions and,
and all of these people brought together

683
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:48,481
to create these incredible cathedrals,
and it was made possible by the fact 

684
00:38:48,481 --> 00:38:52,411
that European society had become 
relatively wealthy and this wealth was 

685
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,280
brought on by this global warmth.
Right now what we see,

686
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,440
go ahead to the,
to the beginning,

687
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,320
to the end of this magnificent gothic 
building.

688
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,700
Boom.
And,

689
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:07,701
and by the way,
there's about 500 smaller abby's that 

690
00:39:07,701 --> 00:39:12,421
were constructed during this interval.
This was a very prolific time for a 

691
00:39:12,421 --> 00:39:16,171
number of reasons.
This was the time that you had the 

692
00:39:16,171 --> 00:39:16,171
templar knights forming.
You've probably heard of that.

693
00:39:16,171 --> 00:39:17,290
The tempur nights,
I'm sure.

694
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Um,
you had schools of Kabbalah being 

695
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,160
founded in Spain and,
and you had the rise of Catheter Ism.

696
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,520
You had the troubadours,
you had these amazing spiritual things 

697
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:31,680
going on.
Um,

698
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,910
amazing.
Culturally.

699
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:37,090
It was a very extraordinary time.
Those high Middle Ages.

700
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:42,690
Well,
a lot of those gothic cathedrals were 

701
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,061
never finished.
And what we see is that some of them 

702
00:39:45,061 --> 00:39:45,061
have the appearance.
You know,

703
00:39:45,061 --> 00:39:48,300
I'm a builder by profession and you know
it's,

704
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:53,370
it's,
I've looked at some of these in a what 

705
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,450
it's very much like as they're going 
along building and then all of a sudden 

706
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:59,131
one day nobody shows up to work and 
there are still tools laying around or 

707
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:03,271
still materials that are often a pile 
that we're waiting to be incorporated 

708
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:03,790
into the structure.

709
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:09,420
And what happened was that the climate 
began to cool again between 13,

710
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:15,661
15 and 1320 precisely.
When we see the end of this tremendous 

711
00:40:15,661 --> 00:40:20,281
gothic building boom is when the climate
began to cool and it's cool for the next

712
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,520
several decades.
And what we then see as a repeat of what

713
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,740
happened between 5:36
and 5:42

714
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:31,741
had agricultural collapses.
Crops rotting in the fields.

715
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,670
People going hungry between,
I think it was around between 13,

716
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:40,450
14 and 1345.
The onset of the black plague.

717
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:46,110
And once again the population of Europe 
was decimated and it took 150 years 

718
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:52,650
basically to recover from that.
And what we see is that what what what 

719
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:56,940
was happening is the planet with 
shifting into what's called the little 

720
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:56,940
ice age,
where you probably heard that term,

721
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:57,850
the little ice age,
right?

722
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,410
There was two phases to the little ice 
age and the first phase began,

723
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,790
like I said,
around 13,

724
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:08,791
20,
lasted about 150 years and there was a 

725
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:11,731
break and it was during that break,
that warm period that basically the 

726
00:41:11,731 --> 00:41:14,560
renaissance kicked in and we began to 
really move forward.

727
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:19,890
The second phase of the little ice age 
came in during the 16 hundreds and it 

728
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,450
was actually even colder than the first 
phase.

729
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:26,800
And worldwide glaciers expanded to the 
largest.

730
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:29,620
They had been in 10,000
to 12,000

731
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:34,621
years since the end of the big ice age 
throughout the whole Holocene glaciers 

732
00:41:34,621 --> 00:41:36,350
had been smaller.
Now during the big eye,

733
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,440
the little ice age,
they grew and they grew to the biggest 

734
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,960
that they've been in 10,000
years.

735
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:47,350
It's important to have that context of 
understanding when we talked about 

736
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:50,630
glacier recession because the glaciers 
begin to recede around the middle of the

737
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:55,631
19th century worldwide,
as the little ice age began to wane and 

738
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:59,150
global warmth,
warmth begin to return to the planet.

739
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:03,350
This happened in the mid 18 hundreds,
around 18,

740
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:04,850
40 to 18,
60.

741
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,220
We see the little ice age coming to an 
end,

742
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,880
and at that point,
the glaciers worldwide began to recede.

743
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,880
They begin to contract.
They've been pretty much contracting 

744
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,780
uniformly since then,
so when we're talking about glacier 

745
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:24,311
recession,
it's important to understand that the 

746
00:42:24,311 --> 00:42:26,030
glacier recession really began a century
and a half ago or more,

747
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:31,540
and his basically considered continued 
more or less uniformly since then with 

748
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:37,301
no real change with the advent of of 
human a fossil fuel to the atmosphere,

749
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,800
a human carbon dioxide which began 
really in earnest during the Second 

750
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,470
World War is when when we begin to add 
significant amounts of carbon dioxide to

751
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:53,471
the atmosphere,
it's important to realize that the 

752
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:56,540
glaciers had been receiving almost a 
full century before that point.

753
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:02,340
So when you see all this,
a modern hysteria about global warming 

754
00:43:02,591 --> 00:43:06,260
and the human created global warming 
that we,

755
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,280
we keep hearing about in the news and 
that our influence on the atmosphere.

756
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:13,900
Does it drive you crazy?
I mean,

757
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:18,901
do you think it's silly?
It obviously human beings are 

758
00:43:18,901 --> 00:43:18,901
contributing to the carbon footprint,
right?

759
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:19,680
Obviously.
Yeah.

760
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:24,710
Obviously.
And obviously that has an effect on 

761
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:24,710
global warming.

762
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:24,710
Yes,
yes.

763
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,840
But you've got to bear in mind at carbon
dioxide is only one variable in a very 

764
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,720
complex equation,
right?

765
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:36,050
There are many factors influencing 
climate of which carbon dioxide is only 

766
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:40,881
one.
My problem with so much of the stuff 

767
00:43:40,881 --> 00:43:43,971
that's coming out in mainstream media,
which is coming through the 

768
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:44,070
intergovernmental panel on climate 
change,

769
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:49,610
is simply that when,
when they were instituted back in early 

770
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:54,770
nineties by the United Nations,
the United Nations Framework Convention 

771
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:58,101
on climate change basically gave them a 
mandate which is demonstrate that humans

772
00:43:58,231 --> 00:44:00,480
are causing climate change,
right?

773
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,840
So they focused exclusively on carbon 
dioxide,

774
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,540
but there's all kinds of other things 
going on.

775
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:11,541
For example,
cosmic rays are constantly bombarding 

776
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:11,541
the earth,
right?

777
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:16,670
Cosmic rays produce clouds.
The more of the cosmic rays penetrate 

778
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:23,541
the atmosphere,
the more a low altitude cloud cover 

779
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:27,411
there is.
Low altitude clouds reflect heat back 

780
00:44:27,411 --> 00:44:31,671
into space.
Now the amount of cosmic rays are 

781
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:31,671
penetrating the atmosphere.

782
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:34,350
A function of a couple of things.
You've got the helio sphere,

783
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,450
which is the whole,
essentially the,

784
00:44:37,451 --> 00:44:37,950
the,
the,

785
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:42,951
the energy envelope of the sun,
which encompasses the whole solar 

786
00:44:42,951 --> 00:44:45,420
system.
The Sun actually is fairly variable.

787
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:50,650
Um,
and what that means is that when the 

788
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,980
solar wind is an in more intense phase,
like when,

789
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,040
when the sun spots,
for example,

790
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:58,850
are very active,
the solar wind is,

791
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:03,910
is much stronger.
What that does is it serves as a buffer 

792
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,670
that prevents cosmic rays from 
penetrating the atmosphere of the earth 

793
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,040
as,
as strongly as they did previously.

794
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,280
Also,
the geomagnetic field of the earth acts 

795
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,730
as a buffer.
So here's two things that are completely

796
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:22,920
not included in the scenarios of the 
ECC,

797
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:26,970
but probably have a very profound effect
on global climate.

798
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:29,820
Um,
the earth's geomagnetic field is,

799
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:34,821
you probably know that the geomagnetic 
field has periodically throughout earth 

800
00:45:34,821 --> 00:45:35,940
history disappeared completely.

801
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:41,270
Sometimes it's it's disappeared and come
back with reverse polarity will let 

802
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:45,591
geomagnetic field acts as a buffer,
which helps to reduce the amount of 

803
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:51,030
cosmic rays penetrating the atmosphere.
How's it disappeared completely?

804
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:57,170
I don't know,
and I don't know if really anybody 

805
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,430
knows.
I haven't kept up with all of the most 

806
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,430
recent research.
What's the geomagnetism,

807
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:03,621
but you know when you've got you hold a 
little compass in your hand and it 

808
00:46:03,621 --> 00:46:03,621
points to north,
right?

809
00:46:03,621 --> 00:46:04,350
Right.
Okay.

810
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,370
That's the Jew magnetic field that's 
being measured by the compass.

811
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,560
It's moving,
it's fluctuating,

812
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:14,550
and for whatever reason throughout the 
the history of the earth,

813
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:19,140
it has completely disappeared at some 
points and his reverse polarity.

814
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:24,410
It's.
It was the reversing of the polarity of 

815
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:27,591
the magnetic field that helped prove,
prove the reality of continental drift 

816
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,600
because as the mid Atlantic Ridge 
separates and and and a lava flows out,

817
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,040
it crystallizes and locked into the 
crystal and structure of the of the lava

818
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:45,410
is the direction of the magnetic field 
and the polarity of the magnetic field 

819
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:45,960
is imprinted in there.

820
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,410
If you look at the research going back 
to the 19 fifties,

821
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:55,100
they realized that you had stripes 
effect effectively as you moved away 

822
00:46:55,171 --> 00:47:00,171
from Tomato Atlantic Ridge as the,
as the lava flow it out and 

823
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:03,480
crystallized,
locked in the magnetic field.

824
00:47:03,481 --> 00:47:08,481
They looked at it and they could see 
that there were times when it had 

825
00:47:08,481 --> 00:47:11,781
completely reversed itself.
And so this was like very powerful 

826
00:47:11,781 --> 00:47:14,550
evidence that the,
that the theory of continental drift was

827
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:15,200
right,
that,

828
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,990
that the Atlantic Ocean had been 
spreading.

829
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:21,600
And getting back to this whole Atlantis 
thing,

830
00:47:21,601 --> 00:47:24,160
which is interesting to me is because 
when you look at,

831
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,130
at um,
replay those account,

832
00:47:26,131 --> 00:47:30,050
he describes Atlantis as being a west of
the pillars of herrick lease,

833
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,990
which of course is the Straits of 
Gibraltar,

834
00:47:31,991 --> 00:47:33,310
the mouth of the Mediterranean.

835
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,280
He describes how if you go,
you come to some islands,

836
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:44,310
then you come to some more islands and 
that was the island complex of Atlantis 

837
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:47,170
and beyond.
That was another whole continent.

838
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:48,910
He describes that,
right?

839
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,010
If you look in the middle of the 
Atlantic Ocean,

840
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:56,011
you've got the [inaudible] plateau,
which is now a couple of thousand feet 

841
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:01,500
under the sea.
The aes or islands are the tops of 

842
00:48:01,841 --> 00:48:06,841
mountains that,
that emerged from the surface of the 

843
00:48:06,841 --> 00:48:06,841
ocean,
right?

844
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,240
And they sit right on the Atlantic,
uh,

845
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,700
the mid Atlantic Ridge,
now,

846
00:48:12,701 --> 00:48:16,700
the mid Atlantic Ridge,
some of the thinnest crust on,

847
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,010
on the planet,
right?

848
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:23,580
And if it's like a giant suture or a 
giant crack that runs up halfway around 

849
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,940
the planet,
well,

850
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:30,570
when you have an ice age and you start 
piling ice up onto like the North 

851
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:35,100
American continent,
what happens is the weight of that ice 

852
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,520
begins to crush the crust of the earth 
down into the mantle.

853
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,730
It's called isoss to see which is a 
vertical movement.

854
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,520
You know,
continental drift is horizontal.

855
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:50,580
I saw stussy is vertical now it's just 
like right now you're sitting on that 

856
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,150
soft chair,
right?

857
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:55,420
And your ass is creating a depression in
the cushion of the chair,

858
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:57,820
right?
That's isostatic depression.

859
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:02,850
You didn't realize that.
Did you know that your ass is creating 

860
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:03,670
isostatic depression?
Right?

861
00:49:03,671 --> 00:49:08,671
And when you get up and you walk away,
then you will have isostatic 

862
00:49:08,671 --> 00:49:12,390
compensation.
You'll have isostatic rebound because 

863
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:13,540
the cushion will now rise because the 
weight has been removed.

864
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,960
It's the same thing with the ice mass on
the continent.

865
00:49:16,961 --> 00:49:21,790
The ice mass was hundreds of billions of
trillions of tons of ice.

866
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:26,400
It pressed the center of the North 
American continent or,

867
00:49:26,401 --> 00:49:31,390
or the center of at least Canada down 
perhaps as much as several thousand feet

868
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:35,200
into the mantle.
With the removal of that ice,

869
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,440
the land begins to rebound.
Hudson Bay is the depression leftover 

870
00:49:40,601 --> 00:49:43,870
from the thickest part of the ice right 
now.

871
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,080
Our photographs,
we could probably even pull some up here

872
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:52,081
in a minute.
There are photographs taken where you 

873
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:54,841
can see the elevated shoreline 
surrounding Hudson Bay because it's 

874
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:55,690
still rising,
right?

875
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,790
What's interesting too is if you look at
the,

876
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:59,430
the,
uh,

877
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,440
the distance between these shorelines,
you'll see that early on there was a 

878
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,900
greater distance because the land was 
rising faster.

879
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:13,320
As the millennia have have gone on,
the distance separating each shoreline 

880
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,881
has diminished.
But now you have to think that all of 

881
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:19,330
that weight is being transferred back 
into the ocean basins.

882
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,290
A lot of it was dumped directly into the
Atlantic Ocean,

883
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:26,410
either via,
like the St Lawrence River up there,

884
00:50:26,411 --> 00:50:28,610
the Hudson River,
up in the New York area,

885
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:31,850
or via the Mississippi River into the 
Gulf of Mexico.

886
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,900
Now you've got all this water dumping 
back into the ocean.

887
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:40,901
Like I said,
ocean levels are coming up hundreds of 

888
00:50:40,901 --> 00:50:40,901
feet,
right?

889
00:50:40,901 --> 00:50:44,260
So now you're adding all of this weight 
to the ocean basin and now you've got 

890
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:49,151
the mid Atlantic Ridge,
which is some of the thinnest crust on 

891
00:50:49,151 --> 00:50:49,151
the earth.

892
00:50:49,151 --> 00:50:49,400
Right?
This is what it's doing.

893
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,310
It's like a hinge line.
Right?

894
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:57,290
So now you picture during a glacial age,
when the weight is taken out,

895
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:59,350
it does.
This lifts up,

896
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,560
lifts up,
listening,

897
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:01,700
not watching.
Yeah.

898
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,390
When the ice melts,
the water goes in,

899
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:07,670
sea level rises,
it subsides.

900
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:12,970
Right now you look at the [inaudible] 
plateau is a chunk of the African plate 

901
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:18,850
that got left over when the continent's 
separated around 70 to 80 million years 

902
00:51:19,311 --> 00:51:20,300
ago.
Right.

903
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,250
If you've seen the maps into the showing
how you can fit the continents together.

904
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:27,740
Yeah,
if you fit these back together,

905
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:30,410
if you,
if you reverse continental drift,

906
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,920
go back about 70 or 80 million years and
it's all fits together like a piece of 

907
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,980
the puzzle,
but when it's separated,

908
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:42,100
a piece of the of the African plate got 
left behind and this is what is the 

909
00:51:42,321 --> 00:51:45,060
[inaudible] plateau and it sits right 
there,

910
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:45,520
a stride.

911
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:49,010
The Atlantic Ridge,
it's maybe a little bit smaller than the

912
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,980
than Iceland,
which is considered to be an island,

913
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:55,190
but a pretty good sized island right 
now.

914
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:00,940
If you're doing this and you have as 
much as two or 3000 feet or maybe more 

915
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:03,050
of this vertical movement,
right,

916
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,440
and you added that to 400 feet of sea 
level rise.

917
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:07,850
Now you can,
I think,

918
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:12,851
begin to get a scientific rationale for 
how you may have had a large island in 

919
00:52:12,851 --> 00:52:15,320
the Middle Atlantic back during the ice 
age.

920
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:21,070
Also,
additional evidence has suggested that 

921
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:23,500
the Gulf stream,
which now basically brings a subtropical

922
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:27,170
warmth up to northwestern Europe.
I mean,

923
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:29,210
if you were to terminate the Gulf 
stream,

924
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,420
England would,
would have some pretty,

925
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:33,410
pretty,
um,

926
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,320
malignant times.
So in northwestern Europe,

927
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:39,620
because the warmth is being brought up 
by that Gulf stream,

928
00:52:39,621 --> 00:52:41,910
right?
Well,

929
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,380
during the ice age,
the Gulf stream diverted to the south at

930
00:52:45,381 --> 00:52:50,381
about 45 to 46 degrees,
which was hundreds of miles further 

931
00:52:50,381 --> 00:52:50,990
south and it now goes.

932
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:54,760
So essentially if you look at the 
[inaudible] plateau,

933
00:52:55,070 --> 00:53:00,070
a big chunk of that,
a source plateau would have been above 

934
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:03,250
sea level during the ice age.
And that Gulf stream with its warmth 

935
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,640
would have just basically embraced it.
See?

936
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:10,120
So if you suddenly,
joe found yourself transported 

937
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,121
mysteriously back to the ice age,
that's probably where you might want to 

938
00:53:13,121 --> 00:53:13,980
go is the [inaudible] plateau.
It might've been,

939
00:53:13,981 --> 00:53:18,981
uh,
one of the most benign places on earth 

940
00:53:18,981 --> 00:53:21,131
to live during the ice age.
And if there was a place where 

941
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:24,671
civilization could evolve,
that would be a very logical place for 

942
00:53:24,671 --> 00:53:28,481
it to occur.
There's nothing really pseudoscientific 

943
00:53:28,481 --> 00:53:31,910
now about assuming that there could've 
been some type of historic reality 

944
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,770
behind these stories of Atlantis.
Of course,

945
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:39,890
the problem is as the wound will factor 
that has gotten so grafted onto these 

946
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:40,620
stories,
but you know,

947
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:44,510
crystals and aliens and flying ships and
you.

948
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,080
I mean we don't know,
but you know,

949
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:51,150
we don't have any hard evidence,
but the hard evidence does suggest that 

950
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:54,140
there could have been some very benign 
habitable islands,

951
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:57,470
large islands in the mid Atlantic during
the ice age.

952
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:01,310
Wow.
So that's intense.

953
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,290
That's so incredible.
It's so.

954
00:54:03,291 --> 00:54:03,810
It's,
it's,

955
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:08,870
it's so crazy to think how,
how much things have changed while human

956
00:54:09,021 --> 00:54:12,830
beings have been here.
The idea that during go Beckley tappy,

957
00:54:12,831 --> 00:54:14,300
which is 12,000
years ago,

958
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:19,040
that North America was covered with ice 
and they.

959
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:24,070
This was when these people in Turkey had
created this incredible structure.

960
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:29,680
So when you see this,
the modern hysteria about global 

961
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,211
warming,
which is really essentially been like a 

962
00:54:34,211 --> 00:54:34,211
wrestling match between the left and the
right,

963
00:54:34,211 --> 00:54:38,530
it's this weird thing where the right 
wants to support like burning coal and 

964
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:43,151
they don't want to diminish the economy 
by putting all these environmental 

965
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:47,690
regulations on natural resources.
And then the left,

966
00:54:47,691 --> 00:54:50,960
which is screaming at the top of their 
lungs that the sky is falling,

967
00:54:50,961 --> 00:54:53,450
the oceans are going to rise and people 
are going to drown.

968
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:58,900
W when you,
when you know so much about what has 

969
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,351
happened over the course of the earth,
when you've studied this for a great 

970
00:55:02,351 --> 00:55:05,240
deal of time like you have,
what is your take on all this stuff?

971
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,810
Well,
I guess my intake is,

972
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:10,060
is,
is fairly simple.

973
00:55:10,061 --> 00:55:11,500
I,
I tend to think that,

974
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:13,470
you know,
if you know,

975
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:14,900
if you're looking at the,
the,

976
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,340
the whole process of if you look at the 
carbon cycle,

977
00:55:18,341 --> 00:55:19,110
for example,
what,

978
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:24,250
what you see there is interesting.
We can talk to this to this as much as 

979
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:27,190
possible so we can have his little 
variation in the tone as possible.

980
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,610
Thank you.
Um,

981
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:31,240
you know,
putting this into context,

982
00:55:31,241 --> 00:55:36,241
we have to say,
right now we're approaching 400 parts 

983
00:55:36,241 --> 00:55:39,601
per million of the ambient amount of Co.
Two in the atmosphere.

984
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:42,850
AT the beginning of the industrial 
revolution,

985
00:55:42,851 --> 00:55:46,330
it was about 100 parts per million less.
It's,

986
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:51,930
you could say basically that over the 
last century we have increased the 

987
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:53,650
amount of co two measurable co two into 
the atmosphere,

988
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:55,090
assuming that it's all from us.
Now,

989
00:55:55,091 --> 00:55:55,580
I meAn there,
there,

990
00:55:55,590 --> 00:56:00,590
there's questions about that too,
because if there are other factors 

991
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:01,580
inducing global warming such as changes 
in,

992
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:06,620
in solar irradiance,
the amount of installation penetrating 

993
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,751
the atmosphere and so on,
it means that the oceans are warming as 

994
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:09,751
a result of that.

995
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:14,610
Okay.
Oceans are a gigantic carbon dioxide 

996
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:15,190
sink.
When they're warm,

997
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:18,700
they exude carbon dioxide when they're 
cold,

998
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:19,900
they absorb it,
right?

999
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:25,600
So if you have a natural warming,
it's gonna expel some carbon dioxide.

1000
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:31,020
So it's not even clear necessarily that 
that 100 parts per million is totally 

1001
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,960
the result of fossil fuel burning.
But for the sake of argument,

1002
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:38,500
let's say that it is okay,
100 parts per million,

1003
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:43,530
that's minuscule trace of this very 
important constituents of our 

1004
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:49,201
atmosphere.
You know that carbon dioxide is what 

1005
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:49,201
fuels photosynthesis,
right?

1006
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:54,420
And if you start reducing the amount of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and 

1007
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:58,111
you'd start,
once you start dropping below 200 parts 

1008
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,111
per million and you get down to about 
1:50

1009
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:02,470
to 100 photosynthesis plant,
photosynthesis starts shutting down.

1010
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:08,160
I mean it's kinda like the amount of co 
two in the atmosphere right now is at 

1011
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:08,560
the very bottom of the scale.

1012
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:13,980
You know,
if we look at history going back when 

1013
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:14,620
you mentioned the cretaceous tertiary,
when the dinosaurs ruled,

1014
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:20,730
there have been many times more the 
amount of ceo to up to well in excess of

1015
00:57:22,181 --> 00:57:27,181
a thousand parts per million.
Several thousand parts per million in 

1016
00:57:27,181 --> 00:57:31,111
the atmosphere.
But if we have increased the amount of 

1017
00:57:31,111 --> 00:57:33,760
co two by 100 parts per million in 100 
years,

1018
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:38,590
it means we've for every million 
molecules of air up there,

1019
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:43,660
we add one molecule of co two every year
or two.

1020
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:46,330
Maybe try to make it a little bit more 
comprehensible.

1021
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:52,770
If for every hundred thousand molecules 
of air up there every 10 years we had 

1022
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:57,350
one molecule of co two.
I.

1023
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,240
I'm not convinced that that's going to 
lead to global catastrophe.

1024
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,500
I mean,
think of it this way,

1025
00:58:02,501 --> 00:58:07,501
you've got a huge tank with a hundred 
thousand fish in it every 10 years 

1026
00:58:07,501 --> 00:58:08,200
you're throwing one more fish.

1027
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:11,530
Are you even going to notice that?
You know,

1028
00:58:11,531 --> 00:58:14,560
I think that what's happened is that ceo
to,

1029
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:19,561
like I said,
is one variable in a very complex 

1030
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:20,710
equation,
but all of the other variables as far as

1031
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:23,890
the,
the government funded research ngos have

1032
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:29,160
been excluded from the debate.
And what dismays me is that we're told 

1033
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:33,490
that all scientists agree on this.
No,

1034
00:58:33,491 --> 00:58:38,491
all scientists don't agree.
When you have though a major government 

1035
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:43,330
funded program like climate change 
research,

1036
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,390
which is funded to the tune of about 
$2,000,000,000

1037
00:58:46,391 --> 00:58:51,391
per year,
you're going to have a large vested 

1038
00:58:51,391 --> 00:58:53,260
interest in basically.
I mean,

1039
00:58:53,261 --> 00:58:57,400
if these guys came out and said nascio 
two is really not a big deal,

1040
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:01,490
it's perhaps fueling plant growth.
Um,

1041
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:04,280
and this is an interesting aside,
you know,

1042
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,440
if you look at the,
um,

1043
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:10,830
the projections of forest in inventory 
back in the fifties and sixties based 

1044
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:15,451
upon deforestation is a result of timber
as a result of agriculture.

1045
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:18,950
The projections that at how quickly,
um,

1046
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:24,020
forest inventories we're going to,
if you look at those projections back in

1047
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:29,021
the fifties and sixties and then you 
realize that in the ensuing period of 

1048
00:59:29,021 --> 00:59:31,730
time,
we've now got exhaustive,

1049
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:36,790
highly accurate satellite surveys that 
can actually count the number of 

1050
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:40,931
hectares of forests.
what's interesting is in the nineties 

1051
00:59:40,931 --> 00:59:44,981
when they really started looking at this
date of just how much forest there was 

1052
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:49,661
compared to what the projections were,
there was like 25 to 40 percent more 

1053
00:59:49,661 --> 00:59:52,280
forests worldwide than anybody had 
predicted.

1054
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,100
What fueled this prolific forest growth?
Well,

1055
00:59:58,101 --> 01:00:03,101
it's very likely that at least part of 
it was because of the slight increase in

1056
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:07,430
ceo to Israel resolved as a result of 
our fossil fuel burning.

1057
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:11,710
Now we,
we put in every year we burn about a,

1058
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:15,440
in introducing into the atmosphere about
6 billion tons of co two.

1059
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:21,310
Well there's about 750 or 760 billion 
tons of co two in the atmosphere 

1060
01:00:23,181 --> 01:00:28,181
naturally.
And at least a third of that is cycling 

1061
01:00:28,181 --> 01:00:30,440
through from the atmosphere into the 
biosphere,

1062
01:00:30,441 --> 01:00:35,441
into the oceans and so on.
So our contribution isn't really that 

1063
01:00:35,901 --> 01:00:38,650
significant,
but another part of the.

1064
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:43,651
The argument is that,
and this has been admitted right in the 

1065
01:00:43,651 --> 01:00:47,770
ipc reports,
is that based on the amount of fossil 

1066
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:51,341
fuel that we're burning,
there should be twice as much co two 

1067
01:00:51,341 --> 01:00:52,370
into the atmosphere in the atmosphere as
we're now measuring.

1068
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:58,210
So what they have been talking about for
about 15 years now is where's the 

1069
01:00:58,611 --> 01:00:59,450
missing carbon?

1070
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:02,540
What's this missing?
Carbon sink will probably.

1071
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:07,541
Some of it's going into the ocean,
but most likely a lot of it is going 

1072
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:09,500
into fueling plant growth and forest 
growth worldwide.

1073
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:14,830
And there's a lot of studies that are 
beginning to come out now that shows 

1074
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:18,251
that perhaps some of the desert areas of
the planet rather than expanding are 

1075
01:01:19,731 --> 01:01:21,920
actually contracting.
So,

1076
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:26,090
you kNow,
at thIs point there's a lot of things we

1077
01:01:26,091 --> 01:01:29,390
still have to learn when it comes down 
to understanding the climate.

1078
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:31,580
We're in the infancy.
You,

1079
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:36,840
you can't talk to a single climatologist
and come up with one single coherent 

1080
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:42,370
answer or agreement on what has actually
provoked the planet to go into a full 

1081
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:45,800
ice age or what has caused it to come 
out of an ice age if you don't have,

1082
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:50,830
if you don't know that.
We still have a hell of a lot to learn 

1083
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:54,401
about how the climate works,
so I get really frustrated when I hear 

1084
01:01:54,401 --> 01:01:58,541
this claim that the debate is over.
The debate is over because the debate 

1085
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:02,390
hasn't really even begun yet.
You say we need to really look at all of

1086
01:02:02,391 --> 01:02:04,580
these other factors as well.
I mean,

1087
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,220
when you look at at at wind currents and
ocean currents,

1088
01:02:07,221 --> 01:02:08,420
you have the,
the el nino,

1089
01:02:08,421 --> 01:02:10,140
southern oscillation.
You have the,

1090
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,650
the,
the indian ocean dipole,

1091
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,960
you have the pacific decadal 
oscillation.

1092
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:18,350
All of these things have a very profound
influence on the climate,

1093
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,160
but they're essentially being

1094
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:25,190
ignored within the.
Within the government funded science to 

1095
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:30,111
a large extent and you have a lot of 
scientists who have objected to some of 

1096
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:35,760
the claims of certainty made by the ipc 
see scientists,

1097
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:39,480
and for the most part the left likes to 
demonize them.

1098
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:40,860
This is people like,
oh,

1099
01:02:40,861 --> 01:02:45,861
I think probably the the leading demon 
of climate deniers is fred singer 

1100
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:50,460
because he wants was given an a,
a $10,000

1101
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:54,210
unsolicited donation from exxon years 
and years ago,

1102
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:58,690
but you've got guys like Roy Spencer and
craig ensure would id,

1103
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:03,420
so when robert balling and Timothy Ball 
and and and the list goes on and on.

1104
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:06,690
These are distinguished climate 
scientists that have devoted their lives

1105
01:03:06,691 --> 01:03:10,170
to understanding climate science,
who say,

1106
01:03:10,171 --> 01:03:15,171
well,
there's a lot of flaws in the 

1107
01:03:15,171 --> 01:03:16,680
methodology of the ipc,
but by saying that now they have entered

1108
01:03:16,681 --> 01:03:17,120
the,
the,

1109
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:21,890
the spawn of hell according to the left.
Now in.

1110
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:23,280
You're right.
See what happened.

1111
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:26,970
It's turned into a political football.
It's an idler ideological debate.

1112
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,640
It's an ideological debate,
a political debate,

1113
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:34,400
and it's just too bad that the science 
of the thing has had to suffering.

1114
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:35,940
The consequence.
It is,

1115
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:38,580
it is fascinating because even hearing 
you say this,

1116
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:39,370
I'm,
I'm,

1117
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:44,490
I'm thinking like it starts popping 
triggers like I'm not the type of person

1118
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:49,821
that worries too much about being 
labeled because I've been labeled a 

1119
01:03:49,821 --> 01:03:50,490
million times already as an idiot.
It doesn't.

1120
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:55,870
It doesn't bother me to start 
contemplating the possibilities of 

1121
01:03:56,221 --> 01:04:01,221
controversial ideas,
but when I'm listening to you saying 

1122
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:04,521
this,
all I'm hearing is the knee jerk 

1123
01:04:04,521 --> 01:04:06,000
reaction of climate denier climate to 
always a climate denier.

1124
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:11,001
This guy's a climate denier and seeing 
these fucking things that we've grown to

1125
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:15,990
be accustomed to on television where you
have a guy on the left who has one point

1126
01:04:15,991 --> 01:04:20,991
of view and a guy on the right who says 
something wacky and then everybody 

1127
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,250
fights about it and then the youtube 
clips.

1128
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:28,260
You look at the comments and it's filled
with this guy's a faggot and that guy's 

1129
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:29,340
effect.
This guy eat shit.

1130
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:34,341
I hope your house goes under water.
You fucking climate denier and when I'm 

1131
01:04:34,341 --> 01:04:38,601
listening to you and you mean this 
podcast has been over an hour already 

1132
01:04:38,601 --> 01:04:43,460
and it's incredibly complex.
We have barely scratched the surface and

1133
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:48,720
you're never going to hear anything like
this on any television show because most

1134
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:53,580
people feel that the general public does
not have the attention span to absorb.

1135
01:04:53,581 --> 01:04:58,581
All of this information is really 
complex explanation of the known 

1136
01:04:59,491 --> 01:05:02,250
science,
of the changing of the atmosphere of the

1137
01:05:02,251 --> 01:05:07,251
earth.
So when people start talking about 

1138
01:05:07,251 --> 01:05:10,290
climate denying and you know what,
what is going on with climate change,

1139
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:15,120
what they're really doing is 
establishing their position on what side

1140
01:05:15,121 --> 01:05:20,121
I am the side of.
I'm a person who believes in science and

1141
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:25,921
education,
but how much of this have you actually 

1142
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:25,921
explored?

1143
01:05:25,921 --> 01:05:26,920
How much of it as anybody actually 
looked at?

1144
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:32,070
Well,
I'm a person who supports industry and 

1145
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:34,591
I'm a person who believes the United 
States needs to recover from our 

1146
01:05:34,591 --> 01:05:37,900
economic disaster and we got a frack,
a few wells,

1147
01:05:37,901 --> 01:05:38,860
you know,
so be it.

1148
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:44,040
You know,
there's these two very distinct and 

1149
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,550
oftentimes shallow ideological 
perspectives.

1150
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:50,700
And when I say shallow,
shallow from the point of the general 

1151
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,690
public person like me who's not a 
scientist observing it.

1152
01:05:52,691 --> 01:05:56,800
And just picking aside with very little 
information really,

1153
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,360
and you talked to,
I would like to grab,

1154
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:03,390
grab the average person,
the average leftie and the average kid 

1155
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:04,120
that thinks that they're,
you know,

1156
01:06:04,121 --> 01:06:09,121
they have an opinion on global change.
And just just do me a favor and just 

1157
01:06:09,121 --> 01:06:10,480
write down what you know,
just write down.

1158
01:06:10,481 --> 01:06:13,360
I don't want you looking online.
Do you have an opinion?

1159
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,430
Write down what you know you wouldn't.

1160
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:16,690
You know,
dog shit.

1161
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:20,590
most people know dog shit.
It's true.

1162
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:21,400
It's true.
Joe,

1163
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:26,490
it's so fascinating.
It's so fascinating to me because it 

1164
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:27,520
becomes another one of those things.
Ideology is.

1165
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,190
I mean,
I don't remember who said it,

1166
01:06:30,191 --> 01:06:32,740
but it's,
it's the enemy of free thinking.

1167
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:38,390
You get in these ideological clusters 
and then anything outside of this thing,

1168
01:06:40,031 --> 01:06:45,031
these predetermined patterns of behavior
that you have to subscribe to anything 

1169
01:06:45,031 --> 01:06:47,630
becomes forbidden.
It becomes you.

1170
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:52,660
You can't even entertain it.
You can't even approach the idea or you 

1171
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,640
see it with everything you see with 
atheism.

1172
01:06:54,641 --> 01:06:58,330
You see it with,
you see it with any isms,

1173
01:06:58,331 --> 01:07:01,270
with feminism,
with the men's rights.

1174
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:04,660
You see it with people who subscribe to 
the right people,

1175
01:07:04,661 --> 01:07:09,661
subscribed to the left,
any variables that don't fit into their 

1176
01:07:09,661 --> 01:07:10,930
equation that they've already subscribed
to,

1177
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:16,140
they don't want to be labeled as that 
other side and anytime they don't want 

1178
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:20,311
to be labeled that they start ignoring 
any evidence or any ideas that don't fit

1179
01:07:20,501 --> 01:07:23,470
within this really rigid description.

1180
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:25,090
That's exactly right.
I mean,

1181
01:07:25,091 --> 01:07:28,060
that is,
you hit the nail on the head job weird.

1182
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:32,230
Exactly right.
People get locked into these ideological

1183
01:07:32,231 --> 01:07:37,231
paradigms and then from that point on,
basically their perspective is modified 

1184
01:07:37,231 --> 01:07:39,970
more by emotion and rationality is more 
by,

1185
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:45,020
you know,
their feelings rather than real 

1186
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:45,020
information.
And,

1187
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,000
and it's too bad.
I mean,

1188
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:51,420
I don't know what to blame it on.
Maybe the fact that the government runs 

1189
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:51,420
all the schools,
I don't know,

1190
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,770
you know,
the government monopolizes the education

1191
01:07:53,771 --> 01:07:58,771
system,
so they're not teaching people critical 

1192
01:07:58,771 --> 01:08:01,171
thinking skills.
They're not teaching people how to 

1193
01:08:01,171 --> 01:08:02,440
actually become,
how to be scientifically literate,

1194
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:04,120
um,
which is really sad.

1195
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,740
Um,
but you know,

1196
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:07,450
it's like,
you know,

1197
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:11,050
you keep hearing the term climate change
denier,

1198
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,610
right?
Well,

1199
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:16,010
there's no such thing,
I don't think you're going to find a

1200
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:21,010
single climate scientist of any 
persuasion that denies that the climate 

1201
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:25,670
is changing and you got to realize that 
the terminology has shifted.

1202
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:31,330
It was global warming originally when,
when James Hansen gave his testimony 

1203
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:34,680
before congress in the summer of 1988,
um,

1204
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:40,000
you know,
and proposed these potential tipping 

1205
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,750
points and catastrophic outcomes of our 
burning of fossil fueled.

1206
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:48,430
We've gOne from there to the united 
nations getting involved in the united 

1207
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:52,661
nations,
setting up the whole the epcc and 

1208
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:55,601
channeling all of this funding to it.
And I think the consequences is that,

1209
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:58,790
you know,
when you say again,

1210
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:04,930
excuse me,
we went from global warming to climate 

1211
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:07,721
change.
Why dO they not really used global 

1212
01:09:07,721 --> 01:09:11,591
warming is a term anymore is mainly 
because for 15 years the average global 

1213
01:09:12,051 --> 01:09:15,140
temperature is flatlined.
And this is based upon,

1214
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:20,290
you know,
the most accurate like satellite 

1215
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:21,620
surveys.
The ipc generally focuses only on ground

1216
01:09:21,621 --> 01:09:24,290
based sensors which are subjected to,
uh,

1217
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,140
perhaps some considerable bias because 
you know,

1218
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:32,500
you picture a ground based sensors,
most of them are sitting at airports 

1219
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,900
when these things were being put in post
world war ii,

1220
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:37,490
the bulk of them,
forties and fifties into the sixties.

1221
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,490
Many of these airports were rural.
They were,

1222
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:42,350
you know,
adjacent to small towns.

1223
01:09:42,351 --> 01:09:44,660
They were surrounded by fields and 
farms.

1224
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:49,930
For us,
what's happened is the urban area has 

1225
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:49,950
encroached,
you know,

1226
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,730
every when you,
when you create streets,

1227
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:55,850
pavement buildings,
all of this absorbs heat,

1228
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:56,930
right?
And,

1229
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:02,040
and no one has really done an exhaustive
study of the potential bias.

1230
01:10:02,991 --> 01:10:05,690
It's introduced into the ground based 
sensors.

1231
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:10,990
That part,
at least part of the warming of these 

1232
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:12,440
ground based sensors may have nothing to
do with carbon dioxide at all.

1233
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:17,470
It may just have to do with the fact 
that they're sitting next to a huge 

1234
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:17,470
parking lot.
You see,

1235
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:19,670
and I mean you knoW yourself,
if you walk out,

1236
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:24,760
you know if you're walking in a field 
and then you walk onto an asphalt 

1237
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:25,670
parking lot immediately,
it's,

1238
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:26,900
it's much,
much hotter.

1239
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:29,770
You see Anthony Watts,
who is another one of the,

1240
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:34,940
the,
the dissenters that who's demonized is 

1241
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:38,831
the only one who has really attempted to
exhaustedly document the accuracy of the

1242
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:45,971
ground based sensors and what he's come 
up with is that perhaps as much as 30 to

1243
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:50,390
50 percent of the perceived warming of 
the last century,

1244
01:10:50,391 --> 01:10:53,900
which is about eight tenths of a degree 
centigrade,

1245
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:57,320
is probably as a result of that bias.

1246
01:10:57,330 --> 01:11:02,330
It's been introduced by what's called 
the urban heat island effect and all of 

1247
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:07,091
the major city.
La has a urban heat island mitigation 

1248
01:11:07,091 --> 01:11:09,830
program underway.
All of the major metropolitan cities are

1249
01:11:09,831 --> 01:11:14,831
now trying to mitigate the effects of 
this heat because of all of the samantha

1250
01:11:16,681 --> 01:11:20,160
in the buildings and the pavement in the
parking lots.

1251
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:24,090
They're always hotter than the 
surrounding rural areas.

1252
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,150
So the question has been legitimately 
raised.

1253
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:29,730
How much of a bias has been introduced 
into the,

1254
01:11:30,130 --> 01:11:32,700
um,
into the ground based sensors?

1255
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:35,040
Well,
when we turn to the balloon sensors,

1256
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:40,220
the radio sonne balloon sensors into 
satellite sensor is basically what 

1257
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:44,541
they're showing is that the average 
global temperature has been flat for 15 

1258
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:45,510
years.
Well,

1259
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,900
because of that and,
and many of the,

1260
01:11:47,901 --> 01:11:49,510
the key,
uh,

1261
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:54,150
scientists like phil jones of the ipc 
has basically publicly admitted,

1262
01:11:54,151 --> 01:11:54,540
yeah,
the,

1263
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:58,440
when you look at the average temperature
from that perspective,

1264
01:11:58,441 --> 01:11:59,810
it hasn't warmed in 15.

1265
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:02,970
Now there are regional pockets of,
of warming,

1266
01:12:02,971 --> 01:12:07,971
and you know,
records being sacked all the time 

1267
01:12:07,971 --> 01:12:10,740
because local conditions will affect 
change enormously.

1268
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:14,030
Just like I was talking about the urban 
heat island effect is,

1269
01:12:14,031 --> 01:12:19,031
is a local or regional condition,
but because of the fact that the climate

1270
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:24,780
hasn't warmed statistically 
significantly in 15 years,

1271
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:29,100
now we don't talk about global warming.
We talked about climate change,

1272
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,920
but those two terms are not 
interchangeable.

1273
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:37,400
Global warming.
It's a very specific model of climate 

1274
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,581
change,
which is that you've got this 15 micron 

1275
01:12:40,581 --> 01:12:43,641
wavelength of co two in the atmosphere 
that's trapping infrared radiation 

1276
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:48,480
emanating from the earth.
Right,

1277
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:53,980
okay.
But if you're talking about climate 

1278
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:53,980
change,
now suddenly you know our,

1279
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:58,230
our umbrella goes much,
much huge and it now encompasses all of 

1280
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:02,361
these other things that I was talking 
about and and to question the consensus 

1281
01:13:03,151 --> 01:13:08,151
idea,
to consent to question that ceo two is 

1282
01:13:08,151 --> 01:13:11,121
the primary or sole driver of climate is
not to be a climate change denier.

1283
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,170
See,
because no,

1284
01:13:13,171 --> 01:13:18,171
I would challenge anybody even uses that
term will show me an example of any 

1285
01:13:18,171 --> 01:13:22,581
climate scientist,
no matter where they fall in the 

1286
01:13:22,581 --> 01:13:23,580
argument that is denying that the 
climate is changing.

1287
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:29,570
I mean anybody who has studied the 
climate all knows that it has changed 

1288
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:33,470
dramatically in dynamically on any scale
you can look at whether it's the decadal

1289
01:13:33,811 --> 01:13:36,780
scale as centennial or millennial or 
beyond.

1290
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:39,120
it changes on every level and that's the
thing.

1291
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:43,830
We have to recognize that if we stop 
burning fossil fuels tomorrow,

1292
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:46,260
we didn't drive another car.
We didn't.

1293
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:49,380
We shut down all the coal plants.
I'm going to tell you this.

1294
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:51,960
The climate would not stop changing.

1295
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:59,450
When you see a story like here's one,
it's in the news about a us senator 

1296
01:14:00,121 --> 01:14:05,121
marco rubio's denial of manmade climate 
change should play well with his tea 

1297
01:14:06,031 --> 01:14:11,031
party base who support he'll need if he 
indeed runs for president in 2:16,

1298
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:17,490
but in taking this position,
florida's junior republican senator 

1299
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:21,151
ignores the vast majority of the world's
climate scientists who say human 

1300
01:14:21,151 --> 01:14:24,310
activity is contributing to climate 
change and rising sea levels.

1301
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:25,220
Human

1302
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:27,860
activity is contributing to climate 
change.

1303
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:33,100
No doubt.
There's no doubt that human activity 

1304
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:33,100
contributes to climate change.
Human activity,

1305
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:37,900
again,
is one variable in a very complex 

1306
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,781
equation.
I wish mark marco rubio would keep his 

1307
01:14:40,781 --> 01:14:44,090
mouth shut until he goes and spends 
about six months or a year.

1308
01:14:44,091 --> 01:14:49,091
Really doing the homework because then 
you could talk a little bit more 

1309
01:14:49,091 --> 01:14:49,250
intelligently about it.

1310
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,690
That is the problem,
right?

1311
01:14:50,691 --> 01:14:53,150
It really does take that long.
It does.

1312
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:54,950
Like he.
I know you have.

1313
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:57,530
What did I meet you at six,
seven years ago?

1314
01:14:57,531 --> 01:14:58,410
Something like that.
Yeah,

1315
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:03,460
and you had already spent decades 
observing the effects of climate change 

1316
01:15:05,511 --> 01:15:09,680
and of asteroidal impacts and the 
history of these things.

1317
01:15:09,681 --> 01:15:14,681
I mean the amount of time just absorbing
the information so you could rattle it 

1318
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:15,860
off like this in a podcast.
I mean,

1319
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:19,820
what the fuck got you into this?
How did you get down this rabbit hole?

1320
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:24,620
Well,
this is an odd rabbit hole,

1321
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:26,150
right?
Rabbit hole.

1322
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:28,700
It's a fascinating rabbit hole.
I'm so thankful.

1323
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:32,300
Not only that you've gone down,
but that you're willing to exchange this

1324
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:35,960
information with us or imparted on us 
because it's.

1325
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:41,540
It's a very different perspective 
because I know you're not a right wing 

1326
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:41,540
lunatic.
You are very science based guy,

1327
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:46,510
but you're.
You're looking at this and the way 

1328
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:49,061
you're explaining it is incredibly 
rational and incredibly frustrating to 

1329
01:15:49,061 --> 01:15:52,080
me that there's not that many people 
that are,

1330
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:54,950
that are,
that are saying this well.

1331
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:56,000
The upside

1332
01:15:56,030 --> 01:16:01,030
I think of the whole global warming 
issue or the climate change issue is 

1333
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:02,420
this,
that if you know,

1334
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:07,990
the thing is,
is I made the point that even if we 

1335
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:09,230
stopped all fossil fuel consumption 
tomorrow,

1336
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:12,680
the climate is still going to change and
it's going to change dramatically.

1337
01:16:12,681 --> 01:16:17,681
It's going to change sometimes even 
catastrophic when we need to do from 

1338
01:16:17,681 --> 01:16:22,391
here on out is basically think about 
strategies of adaptability if as a 

1339
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:28,001
result of this whole issue,
even even though I think it's misplaced 

1340
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:32,590
based mis misapplied,
if part of that comes out of this is 

1341
01:16:34,161 --> 01:16:36,740
that we begin to develop strategies of 
adaptability.

1342
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,800
That would be a good thing if however we
focused so exclusively on carbon dioxide

1343
01:16:42,591 --> 01:16:46,160
to the exclusion of everything else.
That could be a bad thing.

1344
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:52,090
Um,
because the climate is going to change 

1345
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:52,090
no matter what we do or where we go with
it,

1346
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:52,940
the climate is going to.

1347
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:56,390
So you can put up solar power panels 
until the cows come home.

1348
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:01,720
The houses that are on the beach in 
malibu are still going to be underwater 

1349
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:01,720
in 100 years.
Well,

1350
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:05,920
not necessarily.
Not necessarily so buy real estate in 

1351
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:05,920
malibu.
Well,

1352
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,910
see,
the thing is,

1353
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:10,190
if you look at the.
I mentioned earlier

1354
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:14,300
that there was a break in the,
in the little ice age of about 150 years

1355
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:16,580
that that basically led to the 
renaissance.

1356
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:18,050
Right?
Well,

1357
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:21,710
we've been in a,
in a receSsion of the little ice age,

1358
01:17:21,711 --> 01:17:26,711
a an interruption of the little ice age 
for about 150 years and right now you 

1359
01:17:27,531 --> 01:17:28,100
know,
and again,

1360
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:33,101
the ipc,
one of the things that frustrates me is 

1361
01:17:33,101 --> 01:17:35,351
that they basically excludes solar 
physicists and solar scientists who are 

1362
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:36,380
essentially saying that insulation 
levels,

1363
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:41,440
insulation,
the amount of solar energy penetrating 

1364
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,780
the atmosphere is one of the lowest 
levels in thousands of years.

1365
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:49,190
and I mean there are solar physicists 
that are saying,

1366
01:17:49,191 --> 01:17:54,191
you know what,
we could be at the beginning of another 

1367
01:17:54,191 --> 01:17:56,561
phase of the little ice age.
Now if our ceo to it's helping new 

1368
01:17:57,201 --> 01:18:01,700
ameliorates somewhat returned the little
ice age,

1369
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:04,970
that would be a good thing.
So muscle cars or green,

1370
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,160
that's what I'm getting out of this.

1371
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:10,100
Coal and muscle cars are good for the 
forest.

1372
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:11,330
Well,
the property,

1373
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:15,110
the problem with coal is not so much the
ceo to is to me,

1374
01:18:15,111 --> 01:18:17,390
it's just the particulate matter.
You know,

1375
01:18:17,420 --> 01:18:19,580
that's a different question altogether.
The pollution,

1376
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,500
the pollution,
which is horrific.

1377
01:18:21,501 --> 01:18:26,501
In China,
when they had these coal plants and you 

1378
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:26,501
see these people that are essentially 
walking,

1379
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:27,470
it looks like they're in the middle of a
forest fire.

1380
01:18:27,471 --> 01:18:29,800
They're walking down the street and it's
just dark everywhere.

1381
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,030
That's a different issue,
you know,

1382
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:33,010
and,
and,

1383
01:18:33,011 --> 01:18:38,011
and I'm,
I consider myself a conservationist in 

1384
01:18:38,011 --> 01:18:40,991
the respect that we basically need 
examples of an,

1385
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:47,600
a pristine nature because ultimately 
nature is the most powerful teacher and 

1386
01:18:49,161 --> 01:18:54,161
we need examples.
We need places where nature's just left 

1387
01:18:54,161 --> 01:18:54,980
alone to do its thing without 
interference of human beings.

1388
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:59,450
We need clean air.
Nobody has the right to dump shit in the

1389
01:18:59,451 --> 01:19:01,070
air that other people have to breathe.

1390
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:04,820
Nobody has the right to dump shit in the
water that other people have to drink.

1391
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:07,970
To me,
those are different questions and really

1392
01:19:07,971 --> 01:19:12,971
where are the more of our focus should 
be rather than these abstractions.

1393
01:19:13,670 --> 01:19:17,090
I have found the course.
I've gotten some flack over the last few

1394
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:19,340
years by saying some of the things I've 
been saying here.

1395
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:24,400
You know,
that I've had people stand up and 

1396
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:24,400
accused me,
oh,

1397
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:24,530
you're just saying we can just do 
anything we want.

1398
01:19:24,531 --> 01:19:28,190
We can just destroy the earth,
which of course is not the case,

1399
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:30,440
and not saying that at all,
not saying that at all.

1400
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:35,460
And,
and when we began to look at the bigger 

1401
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:37,511
context of this thing and we begin to 
understand that the extraordinary 

1402
01:19:37,511 --> 01:19:38,240
changes that this planet has been 
through,

1403
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:41,570
um,
and even to some of the lesser things in

1404
01:19:41,571 --> 01:19:42,670
recent years,
mt.

1405
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:47,780
St helen's,
you remember when that erupted in 1980 

1406
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,850
tens of thousands of acres were turned 
into a lunar landscape,

1407
01:19:50,270 --> 01:19:50,630
right?

1408
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:56,230
Well,
if you read the accounts of the 

1409
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:56,230
scientists,
the biologists,

1410
01:19:56,230 --> 01:20:01,000
zoologists,
the ecologists that had been studying 

1411
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,100
what happened to that decimated 
landscape and the aftermath,

1412
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:08,370
what you find out is they're surprised,
almost shock.

1413
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:13,400
It helped quickly nature recovered from 
that and how quickly,

1414
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,620
you know,
colonizer plants moved in,

1415
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:19,050
uh,
and was followed by a whole,

1416
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:23,640
the whole succession,
ecological succession of reclaiming that

1417
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:25,170
land.
If you look at the,

1418
01:20:25,310 --> 01:20:30,310
the exxon valdez disaster up in Alaska,
in Alaska,

1419
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:36,950
and that was over the short term,
devastating to the local ecology.

1420
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,540
And yet,
what's interesting again,

1421
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:44,840
um,
there've been several books written by 

1422
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,611
some of the lead scientists involved in 
that talking about how remarkably quick 

1423
01:20:46,891 --> 01:20:50,730
nature begin to reclaim and recover from
it.

1424
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:56,000
And here's some irony where the 
government forced exxon to go in and do 

1425
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,570
it's cleanup is actually suffered more 
than the areas that were just left alone

1426
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:02,280
for nature to reclaim.

1427
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:04,830
That's fascinating.
So the chemicals that they used in order

1428
01:21:04,831 --> 01:21:09,831
to break up,
that was the issue with the gulf as 

1429
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:09,831
well,
right?

1430
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:13,410
With those dispersants that they were 
spraying over the area,

1431
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:16,500
they probably should've just left the 
gulf alone because,

1432
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:20,760
you know,
when you have a submarine earthquakes,

1433
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:25,710
they can expel huge amounts of 
hydrocarbons into the ocean.

1434
01:21:25,711 --> 01:21:30,711
Nature has been dealing with massive 
expulsions of hydrocarbon into the 

1435
01:21:31,651 --> 01:21:35,640
oceans and into the marine ecology for,
for millions and millions of years.

1436
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:37,290
Um,
you know,

1437
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:42,291
it was bad.
But I think what we'll see is that the 

1438
01:21:42,291 --> 01:21:46,380
recovery time has been consumed faster 
than most people believed possible.

1439
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:47,880
you see,
I think what's,

1440
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:52,230
what's really going to turn out in the 
end looking at all this,

1441
01:21:52,231 --> 01:21:57,231
is that nature is robust.
And when we begin to look at the number 

1442
01:21:57,231 --> 01:21:59,640
of times that nature has been disrupted 
by,

1443
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:01,740
we've been talking about asteroids and 
comets,

1444
01:22:01,741 --> 01:22:04,980
and here's,
here's a perspective for you,

1445
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:08,010
you know,
at the peak of the cold war,

1446
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:13,850
when us and the soviet union were 
eyeball to eyeball with our nuclear 

1447
01:22:13,891 --> 01:22:16,650
weapons on,
on high alert,

1448
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,710
and we had,
we had 10,000

1449
01:22:19,711 --> 01:22:21,780
weapons on our side.
They had 10,000

1450
01:22:21,781 --> 01:22:26,781
weapons on their side.
The total nuclear arsenal at the times 

1451
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:30,270
had about 18,000
megatons of,

1452
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:35,130
of energy capable of being delivered.
18,000

1453
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:39,270
megatons.
Now that means 18 million tons of tnt.

1454
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:44,280
The bomb that destroyed hiroshima was 
about 10,000

1455
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:49,340
tons of tnt.
So 100 times a hundred hiroshima bombs 

1456
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:54,680
would be one mega ton.
Right now there was aBout say 15 to 

1457
01:22:55,231 --> 01:23:00,231
18,000
megatons total in the arsenal of the 

1458
01:23:00,231 --> 01:23:04,371
superpowers during the height of the 
cold war had we unleashed an all out 

1459
01:23:04,371 --> 01:23:05,920
nuclear war and

1460
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:11,100
fired every warhead that we had in our 
arsenals at each other 15,000

1461
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:13,630
warheads,
you know,

1462
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:14,580
I mean,
yeah,

1463
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,790
20,000
warheads,

1464
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:17,470
15,000
megatons.

1465
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:20,080
It would have been an environmental 
disaster,

1466
01:23:20,081 --> 01:23:24,280
unprecedented in history.
You remember the scenarios about nuclear

1467
01:23:24,281 --> 01:23:24,970
winter,
right?

1468
01:23:24,971 --> 01:23:29,971
Because of all of the fires and the suit
and the particulate matter thrown into 

1469
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:33,310
the atmosphere.
It could literally bring on a a mini ice

1470
01:23:33,311 --> 01:23:34,150
age,
right?

1471
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:38,560
And and probably cause without even the 
radiation caused,

1472
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:41,860
major collapse of the human population.
Right?

1473
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,230
Get this number in your head.
15,000

1474
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:46,000
megatons.
Okay.

1475
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:49,600
Now even a small asteroid impact or 
let's say,

1476
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:53,590
let's say the,
the asteroid impact that that struck the

1477
01:23:53,591 --> 01:23:58,591
yucatan.
There's a simple formula that you can 

1478
01:23:58,591 --> 01:24:01,541
use when you look at the crater size.
you take the size of the crater and 

1479
01:24:02,261 --> 01:24:07,261
raise it expressed in kilometers.
Raise it to the power of three point 

1480
01:24:07,261 --> 01:24:11,521
four and multiply the result by two 
point four and what it's going to give 

1481
01:24:11,521 --> 01:24:14,680
you as the energy yield in megatons of 
that object striking.

1482
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:19,870
If I put in 180 kilometers into this 
calculator here,

1483
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:23,560
which is the diameter of the yucatan 
crater,

1484
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:26,980
and I raise it to the three point four 
power,

1485
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:30,040
and then I multiply that by the two 
point four power,

1486
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:33,400
I get the,
the megaton yield.

1487
01:24:33,690 --> 01:24:38,400
All right,
that number comes up to be three,

1488
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:42,250
one,
111 million megatons.

1489
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:48,120
I divide that by $15,000.
And basically what we have there is 

1490
01:24:49,211 --> 01:24:54,211
about equivalent to the entire nuclear 
arsenal of the superpowers 8,000

1491
01:24:56,351 --> 01:24:58,990
times,
over 8,000

1492
01:24:58,991 --> 01:24:59,680
times over.
Now,

1493
01:24:59,681 --> 01:25:03,490
what kind of an environmental 
consequence would there be to that?

1494
01:25:03,491 --> 01:25:07,300
Well,
we saw that global firestorms,

1495
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:08,520
you know,
that this,

1496
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:13,590
uh,
the studies of the amount of suit at 

1497
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:15,541
that boundary layer shows that the 
amount of biomass that went up in 

1498
01:25:15,931 --> 01:25:20,931
firestorms,
that the kt boundary was about 

1499
01:25:20,931 --> 01:25:22,330
equivalent to every plant on earth today
going up in fire,

1500
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:28,110
right?
You had tsunamis that we're perhaps a 

1501
01:25:28,110 --> 01:25:28,110
thousand feet in height.

1502
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:33,160
You had global earthquakes probably 
measured 10 to 11 on the richter scale.

1503
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:34,570
And you know how the richter scale 
works.

1504
01:25:34,571 --> 01:25:37,660
It's logarithmic.
So that an eight point,

1505
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:42,720
oh,
earthquake is 10 times more powerful 

1506
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:42,720
than a seven point.
Oh,

1507
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:42,970
nine point.
Oh,

1508
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,950
is 10 times more powerful than an eight 
point?

1509
01:25:44,951 --> 01:25:46,180
Oh,
an 11 point.

1510
01:25:46,181 --> 01:25:48,250
Oh,
earthquake is going to be unimaginable.

1511
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:50,890
The whole framework of the globe would 
have shaken.

1512
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:55,780
You probably would have massive failures
on every fault line on the planet.

1513
01:25:56,230 --> 01:26:01,230
Now,
the kt event was the middle of the five 

1514
01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:01,600
great extinction events.
Right?

1515
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:04,100
There was ordovician,
silurian.

1516
01:26:04,101 --> 01:26:06,620
There was the permian triassic.
There was a couple more.

1517
01:26:08,030 --> 01:26:13,030
Two of them were more extreme than that.
Now even even much smaller than that.

1518
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,600
Right.
You know,

1519
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:18,280
w when they talk about a tipping point,
you know,

1520
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:23,240
are we talking about a tipping point 
that could trigger a climate change,

1521
01:26:23,241 --> 01:26:27,830
a disastrous catastrophic climate change
is being a few parts per million,

1522
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:32,860
more of co two or as a tipping point,
really a mile wide asteroid slamming 

1523
01:26:34,311 --> 01:26:36,920
into the earth at 100 times the speed of
a rifle bullet.

1524
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,440
That could be a tipping point,
my friend,

1525
01:26:39,730 --> 01:26:44,730
and that has happened thousands of times
and hundreds of times since we humans 

1526
01:26:44,841 --> 01:26:47,720
have been here hundreds of times,
hundreds of hundreds of times,

1527
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:50,360
and one was the most recent one.
That was the holocene crater.

1528
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:52,200
Well,
probably it's,

1529
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:57,220
there's evidence emerging now that the 
collapse of the late bronze age 

1530
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:58,040
civilization is around 4,200
years ago,

1531
01:26:58,041 --> 01:27:00,470
may have been precipitated by a series 
of impacts.

1532
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:05,680
There's evidence emerging that the 
climate downturn that occurred between 

1533
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:06,140
5:36
and 5:48

1534
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:11,200
that I talked about earlier may have 
been triggered by a series of multiple 

1535
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:15,971
impacts.
one that looks like it occurred off the 

1536
01:27:15,971 --> 01:27:18,641
coast of Norway and another one that 
looks like it occurred off the coast of 

1537
01:27:18,641 --> 01:27:21,680
New Zealand.
Like tandem impacts right around 5:36

1538
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:22,950
and,
and,

1539
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:28,040
and we're basically faced with the idea 
now that literally impacts from things 

1540
01:27:28,881 --> 01:27:33,881
from space maybe hundreds of times more 
likely than anybody was even imagining a

1541
01:27:35,361 --> 01:27:36,260
generation ago.

1542
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:41,920
So we're essentiallY this civilization 
that is banking on the knowledge that 

1543
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,720
we've accumulated over a very small 
amount of time.

1544
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:49,040
And as we're uncovering more and more 
evidence,

1545
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:52,490
more and more information,
we're starting to realize our ignorance.

1546
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:56,330
We're starting to realize how little we 
know about our own history,

1547
01:27:56,331 --> 01:28:01,331
the history of this particular species 
and how it's interacted in this crazy 

1548
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:06,340
volatile environment of earth.
And how many times we've been hit by 

1549
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:06,340
rock.

1550
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:07,390
Yeah.
And see,

1551
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:08,830
you know,
a hundred years ago,

1552
01:28:08,831 --> 01:28:13,831
the assumption was what are these,
these images of these craters are 

1553
01:28:13,831 --> 01:28:13,990
impacts.
Oh yeah,

1554
01:28:14,050 --> 01:28:16,120
that's,
that's actually 10 years old.

1555
01:28:16,121 --> 01:28:18,790
But it shows now all the identified 
impact.

1556
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:22,100
And this is 10 years old.
So since then some new ones have.

1557
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:23,490
Oh,
does the dozens more.

1558
01:28:23,491 --> 01:28:28,491
Yeah.
And since then has been discovery of 

1559
01:28:28,491 --> 01:28:31,131
this nuclear glass that they've found 
all over europe and all over asia,

1560
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:36,980
I think.
Are you referring to the possibly the 

1561
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:38,430
thing that graham was talking about the,
the 13,000

1562
01:28:38,431 --> 01:28:38,880
years a year ago

1563
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,020
of event,
I think.

1564
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:45,350
I think that's what it is.
What I'm referring to is there was a 

1565
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:48,171
mainstream report about all these,
these pieces of this very similar 

1566
01:28:49,501 --> 01:28:54,501
material to what they find at nuclear 
blasts and that it was all over the 

1567
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:57,240
place at when they did the core samples 
around 12,000

1568
01:28:57,241 --> 01:29:02,241
years ago.
Then that's exactly what graham stark 

1569
01:29:02,241 --> 01:29:05,370
and and yes,
the evidence is getting stronger and 

1570
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:08,151
stronger each year that there have.
There may have been a multiple impact 

1571
01:29:08,151 --> 01:29:12,411
event.
The terminated the ice age and this is 

1572
01:29:12,411 --> 01:29:15,950
still a very controversial idea because 
the gradualists just don't want to go 

1573
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:20,691
there and this is probably what killed 
off mass extinction of the woolly 

1574
01:29:20,691 --> 01:29:24,831
mammoth mass extinction of the saber 
tooth tiger and a series of animals that

1575
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:27,900
they really have not figured out why.
like there's,

1576
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:32,930
there's been all sorts of theories about
why the woolly mammoth went extinct and 

1577
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:33,690
some of them are ridiculous like that.

1578
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,310
people did it,
you know.

1579
01:29:35,311 --> 01:29:37,590
I'm glad to hear you say that.
That's ridiculous idea.

1580
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:38,370
Well,
it's ridiculous.

1581
01:29:38,371 --> 01:29:40,920
When you think about what kind of people
were around 12,000

1582
01:29:40,921 --> 01:29:45,921
years ago and what kind of weapons they 
had and what a fucking mammoth looks 

1583
01:29:45,921 --> 01:29:45,921
like,
like jesus christ,

1584
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:48,660
how many of them more and the other 
thing that's ridiculous about,

1585
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:51,360
obviously when I say ridiculous,
I am ridiculous.

1586
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:53,250
I shouldn't even be making that 
statement.

1587
01:29:53,251 --> 01:29:54,840
I don't.
I've done very little research,

1588
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:58,980
but the research that I've read and the 
people that have questioned it,

1589
01:29:58,981 --> 01:30:03,981
have talked about the mass graves where 
they've found these animals that have 

1590
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:09,321
died instantaneously,
thousands of them and not consumed 

1591
01:30:09,321 --> 01:30:11,430
either.
They don't show signs of predation or of

1592
01:30:11,431 --> 01:30:13,060
butchering.
They're there.

1593
01:30:13,390 --> 01:30:16,350
They've died in full form.
Full body.

1594
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,480
Yes.
And the massive,

1595
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:20,010
massive,
massive graveyards.

1596
01:30:20,011 --> 01:30:21,090
And,
and you know,

1597
01:30:21,091 --> 01:30:25,110
for centuries a pristine mammoth tusk,
ivory,

1598
01:30:25,111 --> 01:30:29,960
who've been hauled out of the permafrost
of siberia in train load lots.

1599
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:35,420
You know,
and this has gone into the global ivory 

1600
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:35,700
market literally for three or 400 years.
Um,

1601
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:41,390
some estimates are that there may have 
been as many as four to 10 million 

1602
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:45,050
woolly mammoths worldwide.
Most people don't realize it right here 

1603
01:30:45,050 --> 01:30:48,681
in north America.
There were three species of provo city 

1604
01:30:48,681 --> 01:30:49,260
and are three species of elephants 
during the ice age.

1605
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:53,070
Africa has one species.
Indian India has another species.

1606
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:56,190
We had three species here during the 
time will go.

1607
01:30:56,191 --> 01:30:57,410
Beckley.
Tappy was being built.

1608
01:30:57,411 --> 01:31:01,030
Yes.
During the time elephants in ai.

1609
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:04,350
Elephant,
here's another perspective.

1610
01:31:04,351 --> 01:31:05,910
Is that one that they found.
What is that?

1611
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:08,760
This is the bArest safka mammoth that 
was found in 19.

1612
01:31:08,761 --> 01:31:10,530
Oh,
one quick frozen.

1613
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:12,990
Uh,
yeah,

1614
01:31:12,991 --> 01:31:14,880
with flesh.
Now,

1615
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:20,300
at the time this photograph was taken,
a wolves had eaten the flesh off of the 

1616
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:21,270
skull.
That's why it's,

1617
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:22,420
it's,
um,

1618
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,800
it's bare.
But what you see there immediately.

1619
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:27,180
Dirty wolves.
Yeah.

1620
01:31:27,570 --> 01:31:30,480
Eating some million year old meat,
gusting assholes.

1621
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,280
Probably $13,000.
Zero.

1622
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:37,770
So that's a little.
Not quite as bad as stills gusting,

1623
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:40,950
but you can see the,
the,

1624
01:31:40,951 --> 01:31:45,951
uh,
the mammas left for liam just in front 

1625
01:31:45,951 --> 01:31:45,951
of his face there.
You see how it's,

1626
01:31:45,951 --> 01:31:50,580
and if,
and if jamie toggles back and forth 

1627
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:51,090
between this image and the next one 
you'd be able to see.

1628
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,340
Um,
yeah.

1629
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:55,680
This was how the woolly mammoth was 
found.

1630
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:59,040
And so they took photos of it when it 
was found like this,

1631
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:00,070
and then they left it alone

1632
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,950
and the wolves came and got it.
This is not,

1633
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:05,740
this is a reconstruction,
I believe in the leningrad museum.

1634
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:11,010
So what they did was they took the 
remains of the woolly mammoth and then 

1635
01:32:11,010 --> 01:32:13,891
taxidermists came in and reconstructed.
But this shows the position in which he 

1636
01:32:13,891 --> 01:32:16,090
was found sitting on his haunches like 
that.

1637
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:21,570
And um,
at the time that the woolly mammoth met 

1638
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:25,921
his demise,
he was eating flowering plants right 

1639
01:32:25,921 --> 01:32:26,200
now.
It's important to keep that in mind.

1640
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:31,410
His stomach was full of about two dozen 
different varieties of plants and sedges

1641
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:36,460
and things that he had been munching on 
up in siberia at the time that he,

1642
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:40,240
that he met his death number of 
interesting things.

1643
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:44,470
The contents of his stomach could not 
purified right now.

1644
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,800
That's mysterious.
The fact that his,

1645
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:50,080
his flesh was still edible,
at least by wolves.

1646
01:32:50,110 --> 01:32:51,550
You know,
the stories about,

1647
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:56,940
you know,
the scientist eating mammoth burgers is 

1648
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:56,940
probably made up.

1649
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:58,780
But the wolves definitely were able to 
eat the flesh.

1650
01:32:58,781 --> 01:33:01,480
Right?
It was described as still being marbled,

1651
01:33:01,481 --> 01:33:04,990
almost as if it had just been frozen,
you know,

1652
01:33:04,991 --> 01:33:09,991
a week ago,
but since the time that the woolly 

1653
01:33:09,991 --> 01:33:10,180
mammoth died,
it had its whole carcass.

1654
01:33:10,181 --> 01:33:15,181
Now this was a six ton woolly mammoth,
so he had been frozen for how many 

1655
01:33:15,181 --> 01:33:20,041
thousands and thousands of years and so 
thoroughly frozen that the contents of 

1656
01:33:22,361 --> 01:33:26,350
the stomach putrefying now a woolly 
mammoth of six tons,

1657
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:29,410
has a lot of internal heat,
right?

1658
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:32,650
Clarence birdseye,
the,

1659
01:33:32,651 --> 01:33:37,651
the,
the founder of birdseye foods and the 

1660
01:33:37,651 --> 01:33:40,950
inventor of the fast freezing of foods 
for preservation got involved in 

1661
01:33:42,220 --> 01:33:45,940
examining and in speculating about this 
woolly mammoth,

1662
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:51,360
his conclusion basically that did 
something like this in order to prevent 

1663
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:52,840
the contents of the stomach from 
putrefying,

1664
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:58,230
the entire carcass of the woolly mammoth
would've had to been frozen through and 

1665
01:33:58,230 --> 01:33:59,470
through in 10 hours or less.

1666
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:05,640
Now,
bear in mind that this woolly mammoth 

1667
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:07,231
was eating flowering plants right now,
how cold would it have to be to freeze a

1668
01:34:09,161 --> 01:34:12,040
six ton woolly mammoth in 10 hours or 
less?

1669
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:15,970
His estimate was probably somewhere 
around 150 degrees below zero.

1670
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:22,260
So from flowering plants to a 150 
degrees below zero in 10 hours in 10 

1671
01:34:24,971 --> 01:34:26,360
hours.
How,

1672
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:28,210
what,
what causes something like that?

1673
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:30,790
Well,
there's been some speculation.

1674
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,090
Um,
w,

1675
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:37,610
the speculation that I found most 
interesting was possibly volcanic gases 

1676
01:34:38,650 --> 01:34:41,410
that had been ejected up into the 
stratosphere,

1677
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:47,250
approached absolute zero.
And because of the cold fell back to 

1678
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:52,071
her,
I think you could get the same effect 

1679
01:34:52,071 --> 01:34:53,710
perhaps with a gas is released from a 
disintegrating common nucleus.

1680
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:56,890
It's still a mystery.
I,

1681
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,960
anything that anybody says at this point
is purely speculative.

1682
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:05,350
However,
it's clear that whatever this mammoth 

1683
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:07,871
underwent was disastrous in the extreme 
you saw I'm sitting there on his 

1684
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:08,990
haunches right.

1685
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:14,170
Both of his hip bones were broken,
which means that he was slammed back 

1686
01:35:14,170 --> 01:35:17,831
onto his haunches very violently.
He was also found with an erect penis,

1687
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:23,980
which means that he died by suffocation,
which meant that he was entombed 

1688
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:29,330
virtually instantly by the material that
later became the permafrost.

1689
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:34,900
We were talking about the little ice age
earlier and I was talking about how the 

1690
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:35,660
little ice age ended around 1850.
well,

1691
01:35:35,661 --> 01:35:40,661
this guy was found about 19 oh,
one after the climate in siberia had 

1692
01:35:40,661 --> 01:35:43,900
been warming somewhat see,
and what happened was a part of a clip,

1693
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:46,730
a cliff that had been next to the barest
safka river,

1694
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:52,120
the [inaudible] river had shifted its 
channel and eroded some of the cliff 

1695
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:55,250
face back and then one year,
one warm spring,

1696
01:35:55,490 --> 01:36:00,490
there was a collapse of the cliff face 
that exposed this mammoth to the 

1697
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:05,920
atmosphere and at that point is when the
wolves came in and began to devour the 

1698
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:07,190
flesh on the on the skull.
See,

1699
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:12,640
so clearly this morley mammoth is an 
example of or indicative of some type of

1700
01:36:13,971 --> 01:36:18,971
a catastrophe,
whether it was a global catastrophe or 

1701
01:36:18,971 --> 01:36:18,971
local catastrophe.
Nobody knows,

1702
01:36:18,971 --> 01:36:22,520
but clearly it was catastrophic,
but that woolly mammoth.

1703
01:36:22,521 --> 01:36:27,521
There's only one of dozens of examples 
of flash frozen late pleistocene mammals

1704
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:31,550
that that died under similar 
circumstances

1705
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:36,650
and these large graveyards of mass 
extinctions of thousands and thousands 

1706
01:36:37,831 --> 01:36:40,080
of animals.
What are the best examples of them?

1707
01:36:40,081 --> 01:36:42,540
Because I know that I've seen some of 
them online,

1708
01:36:42,541 --> 01:36:44,670
but I can't pull them up like I'm sure 
you can

1709
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:47,670
got some right here.
If I can get my laptop there,

1710
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:50,550
pull jamie,
pull up,

1711
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:53,070
look towards the bottom of the list 
list.

1712
01:36:53,071 --> 01:36:57,120
You'll see place to seeing the lost 
world of the pleistocene.

1713
01:36:58,170 --> 01:37:01,370
You see that pdf?
No,

1714
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,030
it's a.
It's a powerpoint.

1715
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:06,210
It's in that list of the powerpoints 
that I gave you.

1716
01:37:06,211 --> 01:37:06,790
I have some photos.

1717
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:09,120
You're freaking me out.
I just want to tell you right now.

1718
01:37:09,121 --> 01:37:11,640
You're freaking me out.
I get freaked out.

1719
01:37:11,641 --> 01:37:14,640
Pretty easy,
but she freaking me out.

1720
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:20,770
I actually frozen mammoth.
I have to confess that one of my 

1721
01:37:20,770 --> 01:37:22,080
objectives in coming here was to try to 
freak you out.

1722
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:23,100
Well,
you did it.

1723
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:25,110
Congratulations.
You're successful.

1724
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:29,370
Um,
I've been terrified of yellowstone for,

1725
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:31,830
for years now.
I've watched some late night.

1726
01:37:31,831 --> 01:37:34,200
Documentary was a huge mistake.
It was one of those things.

1727
01:37:34,201 --> 01:37:39,201
I was about to go to bed and I was just 
flipping through the channels and they 

1728
01:37:39,201 --> 01:37:41,010
were going over this thing about a 
called dara volcano in yellowstone.

1729
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:42,980
And I was like,
what the fuck's it called dara?

1730
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:48,200
And then they started talking about what
it was it something like 600 kilometers 

1731
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:51,030
wide or something crazy like that.
Which is something like 300 miles,

1732
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:56,510
and they were saying that they didn't 
even discover it until they started 

1733
01:37:56,510 --> 01:37:56,520
satellite imagery

1734
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:59,220
of a of earth,
and then they realized that,

1735
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:04,280
oh,
this was a giant volcano that was so 

1736
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:07,761
violent in its eruption that it blew the
mountain off of it and it became this 

1737
01:38:07,761 --> 01:38:11,010
massive crater and that it happens every
six to 800,000

1738
01:38:11,011 --> 01:38:16,011
years ago.
That the last time it happened was 

1739
01:38:16,011 --> 01:38:16,011
600,000
years ago.

1740
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:18,540
So hopefully keeping our fingers 
crossed.

1741
01:38:18,541 --> 01:38:20,850
We got another 100,000
years if we're lucky.

1742
01:38:20,910 --> 01:38:21,990
Yeah,
but see,

1743
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:27,090
that's another aspect of this component 
of the dynamic history of planet earth.

1744
01:38:27,091 --> 01:38:29,730
These,
these gigantic volcanic eruptions.

1745
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:35,600
There's been some interesting work 
linking asteroid impacts with giant 

1746
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:35,880
volcanic eruptions as well,
and it would.

1747
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:41,510
It would make sense that that,
that the energy injected into the earth 

1748
01:38:42,121 --> 01:38:45,630
by a major impact could trigger volcanic
eruptions.

1749
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:51,500
We know that during the great meltdown 
event of 11 to 13,000

1750
01:38:52,111 --> 01:38:55,560
years ago,
that there were enormous,

1751
01:38:55,561 --> 01:38:59,040
massive volcanic eruptions and mount st 
helens,

1752
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:00,760
for example,
was,

1753
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:04,650
was massively erupting at that time.

1754
01:39:04,650 --> 01:39:07,530
And I have photographed.
I have some photographs right here,

1755
01:39:07,531 --> 01:39:09,480
I don't know how much time we have to 
look at some of this,

1756
01:39:09,481 --> 01:39:14,481
but where I have gone out and found 
thick layers of white volcanic ash from 

1757
01:39:15,871 --> 01:39:20,871
mount st helens sandwiched in between 
these flood layers and and it.

1758
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:26,130
It shows that it undoubtedly had to have
been a response to the fact that you had

1759
01:39:26,131 --> 01:39:31,131
this enormous mass transfer of weight 
that we were talking about earlier from 

1760
01:39:31,131 --> 01:39:35,550
the continents back to the ocean and 
when we go through maybe it's time to go

1761
01:39:35,551 --> 01:39:37,650
through a few of these images that I 
brought.

1762
01:39:37,690 --> 01:39:41,700
You can begin to see some of the 
consequences of this melting.

1763
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:45,030
You'll begin to appreciate that.
Yeah,

1764
01:39:45,031 --> 01:39:50,031
there were these just enormous mass 
transfers of weight unloading in certain

1765
01:39:50,281 --> 01:39:51,990
areas,
loading and other areas.

1766
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:57,350
This would clearly have a profound 
effect on the subterranean stability and

1767
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:03,200
could easily lead to major eruptions and
there was a spasm of major volcanic 

1768
01:40:04,411 --> 01:40:09,150
eruptions globally at the time of the 
transition out of the ice age,

1769
01:40:09,151 --> 01:40:13,590
which would only have added to the havoc
of that transition and why,

1770
01:40:14,190 --> 01:40:19,190
you Know,
half of the great species of megafauna 

1771
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:19,190
disappeared.

1772
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:21,240
A megafaun is basically defined as an 
any,

1773
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:26,330
any animal in this case,
mostly mammals over 44 kilograms and 

1774
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:28,590
body weight,
which is about a hundred pounds.

1775
01:40:28,830 --> 01:40:30,330
Right?
So that would include us.

1776
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:35,600
And if you started thinking about all of
the animals globally worldwide that are 

1777
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:39,951
more than 100 pounds,
depending on how you divide up the 

1778
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:40,530
species,
there might be 100 to 2,130

1779
01:40:40,531 --> 01:40:45,531
different species.
And I'm talking about the lions and 

1780
01:40:45,531 --> 01:40:48,801
tigers and bears and elephants and 
rhinos and hippos and moose and caribou 

1781
01:40:48,801 --> 01:40:50,220
and dr.
Right down the line.

1782
01:40:50,221 --> 01:40:51,930
Right.
okay.

1783
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:55,030
Let's go back to the ice age.
The extinction,

1784
01:40:55,031 --> 01:41:00,031
the loss of species at the end of the 
last ice age was about equivalent in 

1785
01:41:00,031 --> 01:41:04,801
number.
The loss of species of mega mammals was 

1786
01:41:04,801 --> 01:41:08,101
about equivalent in number two,
the number of species of mega mammals 

1787
01:41:08,101 --> 01:41:10,540
that still exist,
so in other words,

1788
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:15,660
these events that terminated the ice age
basically decimated half of the species 

1789
01:41:17,381 --> 01:41:19,240
of of mega mammals on earth.

1790
01:41:19,570 --> 01:41:23,590
Half of the species disappeared.
So if you were going to try to affect an

1791
01:41:23,591 --> 01:41:26,500
equivalent mass extinction of species 
today,

1792
01:41:27,070 --> 01:41:29,800
you basically have to eliminate every 
animal on earth,

1793
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:34,830
over 100 pounds in body weight in order 
to get the equivalent of that mass 

1794
01:41:35,081 --> 01:41:37,960
extinction episode of 12,000,
13,000

1795
01:41:37,961 --> 01:41:39,400
years ago.
That's insane.

1796
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:41,770
It's insane,
but it's absolutely the truth.

1797
01:41:41,870 --> 01:41:46,870
I.
What is the official like or mainstream 

1798
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:49,240
explanation for this?
It doesn't exist.

1799
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:54,540
Okay.
You brought up the idea of of it's 

1800
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:57,211
called overkill,
which has been the dominant theory for 

1801
01:41:57,211 --> 01:41:59,500
for decades,
which is that human hunters exterminated

1802
01:41:59,501 --> 01:42:04,501
the wooly mammoth and in some vague way,
the extermination of the woolly mammoth 

1803
01:42:04,501 --> 01:42:09,031
being at the top of the food chain 
somehow had a ripple effect down through

1804
01:42:09,401 --> 01:42:14,401
the ranks of species and somehow perhaps
in an unaddressed way resulted in the 

1805
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,560
loss of all these other species.

1806
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:22,560
But theY just don't address that.
And the more you said that theory is 

1807
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:25,660
ridiculous and that's an understatement.
I mean you're talking about,

1808
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:31,140
you know,
perhaps bands of few hundred or maybe 

1809
01:42:31,140 --> 01:42:33,100
even a thousand individuals,
migrant bands,

1810
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:36,780
human hunters coming in and somehow 
able.

1811
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:42,100
So you've got to bear in mind that the 
estimates of human population during 

1812
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:45,271
this time globally is less than the 
estimates of the population of woolly 

1813
01:42:45,271 --> 01:42:49,651
mammoth.
But somehow our ancestors were able to 

1814
01:42:49,651 --> 01:42:54,361
wipe out 4 million to 10 million woolly 
mammoths so fast that they couldn't even

1815
01:42:54,521 --> 01:42:57,520
reproduce.
So there was only like 10 million people

1816
01:42:57,521 --> 01:42:59,680
back then.
That's well see,

1817
01:42:59,681 --> 01:43:03,610
that's based upon more or less the 
conventional interpretation.

1818
01:43:04,150 --> 01:43:09,150
Now of course,
what we've been talking about implies 

1819
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:12,570
opens the door to their possibility of 
there being a lot more people and then 

1820
01:43:12,570 --> 01:43:15,010
mass extinction also including a massive
amount of human beings as well.

1821
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:20,260
And,
and there is some interesting evidence 

1822
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:22,561
emerging now that there perhaps was a 
population collapse between what is 

1823
01:43:22,561 --> 01:43:23,920
called the clovis culture and the folsom
culture.

1824
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:29,460
The clovis culture appears in north 
America to be what is believed to have 

1825
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:33,271
been the earliest culture and the,
there's a site in New Mexico that was 

1826
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:38,620
the first discovery of the,
the association of human artifacts,

1827
01:43:38,621 --> 01:43:43,621
meaning spear points and arrowheads and 
things like that along with extinct 

1828
01:43:43,621 --> 01:43:44,190
mammals.
Right.

1829
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:45,430
This is clovis,
New Mexico.

1830
01:43:45,431 --> 01:43:49,120
It's a very interesting site.
I visited there about six or seven years

1831
01:43:49,121 --> 01:43:50,090
ago,
uh,

1832
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:53,630
in order because I was looking for this 
so called black matte layer,

1833
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:57,700
which has now been documented at dozens 
of clovis sites around north America.

1834
01:43:57,701 --> 01:44:01,130
And the black mat layer is this unique 
layer,

1835
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:02,050
uh,
that,

1836
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:07,090
that essentially separates the 
pleistocene from the holocene and it's 

1837
01:44:07,281 --> 01:44:12,281
full of soot.
It's full of a radium nano diamonds,

1838
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:17,710
microsphere olds and all of these 
signature things that are indicative of 

1839
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:18,920
some kind of a cosmic event.

1840
01:44:18,980 --> 01:44:22,160
Is this an image indicative of that?
Is that what this is that.

1841
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:23,690
yeah,
that's kind of a blurry image,

1842
01:44:23,691 --> 01:44:27,380
but right there you can see it up here 
too.

1843
01:44:27,381 --> 01:44:29,290
So you can face the microphone.
Yeah.

1844
01:44:29,390 --> 01:44:32,870
The white strip in the middle shows the 
black mat layer.

1845
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:34,980
That's exactly it.
Um,

1846
01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:39,440
and what you see below it are the bones 
of extinct mammals.

1847
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,870
And what you see a couple of thousand 
years later,

1848
01:44:41,871 --> 01:44:46,871
his bones of extent,
mammals and nowhere above that black 

1849
01:44:46,871 --> 01:44:51,821
matte layer.
Do you find the bones of the extinct 

1850
01:44:51,821 --> 01:44:51,821
mammals?
What is extent?

1851
01:44:51,821 --> 01:44:53,180
It means dead.
That snow still.

1852
01:44:53,181 --> 01:44:54,440
It's still exist.
Okay.

1853
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:56,290
You know,
uh,

1854
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:59,060
bears are extend.
I see.

1855
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:01,610
You know,
that's the only mammoths are extinct.

1856
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:07,010
So there's a very distinct line that can
be attributed to some sort of an event.

1857
01:45:07,220 --> 01:45:12,220
Yes,
some sort of innovate something before 

1858
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:12,220
that.
They're all alive,

1859
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:12,220
something.

1860
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:13,100
After that,
they're all dead.

1861
01:45:13,101 --> 01:45:18,101
They're all dead.
And a massive amount of the larger 

1862
01:45:18,101 --> 01:45:19,480
mammals gone,
wiped off the face of the planet,

1863
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:24,520
wiped off the face of the planet.
North America lost about 75 percent of 

1864
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,810
its species of mega man.
holy shit.

1865
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:28,710
Three quarters.
Yeah,

1866
01:45:28,720 --> 01:45:29,660
there we go.
There we go.

1867
01:45:29,661 --> 01:45:34,661
There's some of them.
I learned that thing below that thing 

1868
01:45:34,661 --> 01:45:34,661
below.
What is that fucking thing?

1869
01:45:34,730 --> 01:45:37,880
That giant ground sloth.
That fuCking thing is thE mega theOry.

1870
01:45:37,881 --> 01:45:38,850
I'm american.
I'm,

1871
01:45:38,851 --> 01:45:41,780
it's the giant ground sloths.
It was the size of an elephant.

1872
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:46,840
oh my god,
these are the glyptodonts these are all 

1873
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:47,900
10,000
years ago.

1874
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:51,470
Not this guide is a dinosaur's obviously
did norris.

1875
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:56,530
Maximus is the giant moa.
This guy threw him in here for rock is 

1876
01:45:56,530 --> 01:45:57,460
because he's just such an awesome 
preacher.

1877
01:45:57,470 --> 01:45:58,400
The terror bird,
right?

1878
01:45:58,401 --> 01:46:00,090
It's the terror bird.
Yeah.

1879
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:01,760
Scroll back up,
stop scrolling.

1880
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,410
Jimmy,
look at that fucking bird.

1881
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:06,640
That's a seven foot tall.
Bigger than that with eight.

1882
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:07,910
Nine foot tall.
Yeah.

1883
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,120
A bird that doesn't fly.
So essentially a murderous ostrich.

1884
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:14,090
And this was the top of the food chain 
during the miocene.

1885
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:14,990
Really?
Yeah.

1886
01:46:14,991 --> 01:46:16,140
This was it.
This was the,

1887
01:46:16,190 --> 01:46:16,660
the,
the,

1888
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,210
the baddest ass predator on the planet 
for awhile.

1889
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:25,240
Really more so than a saber tooth tiger.
These guys existed before the saber 

1890
01:46:25,581 --> 01:46:27,020
tooth tiger.
Wow.

1891
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:29,810
But they succumbed to one of these 
global events.

1892
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:35,200
You got to bear in mind that if you take
a census of all the species that ever 

1893
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:38,891
existed compared to the species,
now it's conservative to say that 99 

1894
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:46,061
point nine,
nine percent of all species have become 

1895
01:46:46,061 --> 01:46:46,061
extinct.
Wow.

1896
01:46:46,061 --> 01:46:47,120
And in the ones that,
uh,

1897
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:52,380
and,
and of course most of those had went 

1898
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:52,380
extinct without any help from humans at 
all.

1899
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:54,150
Stops growing.
What does that fucking thing?

1900
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:57,930
That's the last materium siberia come.
Jesus christ,

1901
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:03,210
you begin to appreciate.
It's like a bowl that fucked a rhino.

1902
01:47:04,060 --> 01:47:05,810
It's like that.

1903
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:10,710
Wow.
That's insane how big that is.

1904
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:12,270
Oh,
it was huge.

1905
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:17,460
I mean it was elephant sized,
basically a woolly rhinoceros the size 

1906
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:17,730
of an elephant.
And this is sila donta,

1907
01:47:17,731 --> 01:47:22,731
which is the classic willy right now.
So there've been quite a few species of 

1908
01:47:22,731 --> 01:47:24,600
these guys found that were flash frozen.
And this is 12,000

1909
01:47:24,601 --> 01:47:25,980
years ago.
This thing existed.

1910
01:47:26,170 --> 01:47:27,570
Wooly rhinoceros.
Yes.

1911
01:47:27,800 --> 01:47:30,210
And we're in north America.
Jesus christ.

1912
01:47:30,211 --> 01:47:32,580
That's incredible.
And what is,

1913
01:47:32,730 --> 01:47:36,210
what's the mainstream explanation for 
these things going away?

1914
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:39,450
Good luck on trying to find one.
I have looked.

1915
01:47:39,451 --> 01:47:42,150
There iS none.
There is nothing.

1916
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:44,220
They don't.
There's nothing.

1917
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:49,550
So is this something that they just 
haven't formed any theories about or 

1918
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:54,321
they don't try to or it's been ignored 
because there's not enough information.

1919
01:47:54,421 --> 01:47:55,800
It's been ignored.
And here's why.

1920
01:47:57,780 --> 01:48:00,960
At the dawn of earth science,
geological science,

1921
01:48:00,961 --> 01:48:03,990
and early,
early 19th century to a man,

1922
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:06,630
every one of the founding fathers of 
geology,

1923
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:11,780
whether it was william buckland or qva 
or sir James Hall or or rodney merchants

1924
01:48:13,191 --> 01:48:15,420
and adam sedgwick,
you could go right down the line.

1925
01:48:15,450 --> 01:48:17,900
All of these guys from 18,
20 up to about 18,

1926
01:48:17,930 --> 01:48:21,420
60,
every one of them was task surfaced to a

1927
01:48:21,421 --> 01:48:26,421
man.
Everyone because these were guys 

1928
01:48:26,421 --> 01:48:29,120
basically who had not been indoctrinated
into any particular interpretation of 

1929
01:48:29,120 --> 01:48:33,981
world history.
They went out and they looked at 

1930
01:48:33,981 --> 01:48:34,050
evidence in the landscape.
In their conclusion was,

1931
01:48:34,150 --> 01:48:39,150
you know,
something really catastrophic has 

1932
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:41,301
happened.
And then what happened was you had 

1933
01:48:41,301 --> 01:48:45,471
charles lyle play fair and hot,
james hot and these three guys came 

1934
01:48:45,471 --> 01:48:50,211
along and basically establish the 
doctrine of uniformitarianism is.

1935
01:48:50,491 --> 01:48:52,950
It's called a mouthful,
right?

1936
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:55,770
And basically the idea of 
uniformitarianism was this,

1937
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:01,000
is that we look at modern processes to 
explain ancient process.

1938
01:49:01,030 --> 01:49:04,980
So if we see a river eroding,
it's bank moving sediment,

1939
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:10,130
creating a sandbar with that.
If we see like during the early 19th 

1940
01:49:10,130 --> 01:49:14,751
century,
we were in the last phase of the little 

1941
01:49:14,751 --> 01:49:15,360
ice age,
so glaciers were receding and these guys

1942
01:49:15,361 --> 01:49:19,260
could essentially go up there and look 
on a year to year basis and see what was

1943
01:49:19,261 --> 01:49:21,270
happening as the glaciers were receding.
Right?

1944
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:26,750
So Basically what they then did was 
extrapolated from modern processes to 

1945
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:28,830
try to explain all the ancient 
processes.

1946
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:31,620
This is the doctrine of 
uniformitarianism.

1947
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:36,830
Okay.
It's a very powerful model for 

1948
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:39,321
understanding ancient change.
However it became ensconced as dogma so 

1949
01:49:40,501 --> 01:49:43,980
that by the turn of the century as we 
come right up to the,

1950
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:48,460
to the threshold of the 20th century,
it was now considered

1951
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:53,520
unscientific to try to explain anything 
in the past that we couldn't see 

1952
01:49:53,891 --> 01:49:55,900
happening today.
Right?

1953
01:49:56,410 --> 01:50:00,550
So as we go into the 20th century,
this gradual,

1954
01:50:00,551 --> 01:50:05,551
as dogma became ensconced in academia,
in every geologist,

1955
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:10,740
from about 1900 up to about 1980 was 
thoroughly indoctrinated into this idea 

1956
01:50:13,031 --> 01:50:18,031
of the gradualism that all of the earth 
change that we see going on on the 

1957
01:50:18,031 --> 01:50:19,600
planet today has occurred.
One grain of sand,

1958
01:50:20,110 --> 01:50:25,110
one drop of water at a time.
And it was considered to be very 

1959
01:50:25,110 --> 01:50:29,070
unscientific to begin to evoke things 
because initially some of the founding 

1960
01:50:30,761 --> 01:50:33,710
fathers of geology were a lot of them.
Interestingly,

1961
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:38,720
we were theologians who oftentimes a 
number of like adam sedgwick is a good 

1962
01:50:38,771 --> 01:50:41,180
example of somebody who is a,
a traveling theologian,

1963
01:50:41,181 --> 01:50:42,640
a traveling minister,
right?

1964
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:48,090
He was traveling around england and he 
was seeing things like the team's river 

1965
01:50:48,090 --> 01:50:51,781
valley,
and he was seeing that the tims flowed 

1966
01:50:51,781 --> 01:50:54,781
in this gigantic channel that was 
completely outsized relative to the 

1967
01:50:54,781 --> 01:50:55,960
river that was flowing in it.

1968
01:50:56,320 --> 01:51:00,490
And he says,
that must've been a huge flood wall.

1969
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:01,870
He was a theologian,
right?

1970
01:51:01,871 --> 01:51:03,120
So he said,
no,

1971
01:51:03,250 --> 01:51:04,480
his flood.
Right.

1972
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:06,550
Well,
as it turns out,

1973
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:12,510
there are enormous jus morphic effects 
of gigantic floods all over the planet.

1974
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,170
Right.
We know that now,

1975
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:20,800
right?
In the 18 hundreds,

1976
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:24,550
they assumed that if you saw effects of 
gigantic floods,

1977
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:27,250
it had to have been noah's flood.
Well,

1978
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:31,870
at the same time that you had geological
gradualism on the ascent,

1979
01:51:32,350 --> 01:51:35,600
jeal a biological gradualism came along 
in the form of,

1980
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:40,620
of darwinism.
And the two sort of complimented each 

1981
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:40,620
other in,
in,

1982
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:41,530
in mutually supported each other.
Well,

1983
01:51:41,830 --> 01:51:44,170
if we've got infinite time,
you know,

1984
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:49,260
millions and millions of years of 
gradual geological change now that 

1985
01:51:49,511 --> 01:51:53,230
allows us millions and millions of years
for gradual biological change.

1986
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:56,410
And these two paradigms were mutually 
reinforcing.

1987
01:51:56,830 --> 01:52:01,420
So now we come to the 20th century and 
for the first three quarters of the 20th

1988
01:52:01,421 --> 01:52:06,421
century,
that was the dogma that was 

1989
01:52:06,421 --> 01:52:08,260
indoctrinated into the minds of every 
earth scientists.

1990
01:52:08,500 --> 01:52:13,500
Right?
And to vary from that was to be pseudo 

1991
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:16,131
scientific and you're trying to revert 
back to biblical fundamentalism if you 

1992
01:52:16,131 --> 01:52:18,700
start talking about giant floods,
right?

1993
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:20,290
Well,
what happened was,

1994
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:23,230
and it was left to people like emmanuel 
volokhonsky.

1995
01:52:23,410 --> 01:52:28,410
It was not a neuroscientist.
He was a psychoanalyst and he wrote 

1996
01:52:28,410 --> 01:52:31,351
several books in the mid 19 fifties 
where he had gathered together in one 

1997
01:52:31,351 --> 01:52:35,851
place all of this anomalous evidence 
from the earth history that did not fit 

1998
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:38,500
the uniformitarian paradigm.
Now,

1999
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:43,320
his books were popular successes,
but mainstream science just slammed him,

2000
01:52:43,570 --> 01:52:45,680
slammed him and said,
this guy's a nutcase.

2001
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:47,000
Right?
well,

2002
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:52,120
he did make some serious missteps in 
trying to explain this anomalous 

2003
01:52:52,120 --> 01:52:56,980
geological evidence for catastrophe and 
it was those missteps that they were 

2004
01:52:56,980 --> 01:52:58,130
able to focus on to try to discredit 
him.

2005
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:03,580
However,
the amassing of evidence for 

2006
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:03,580
catastrophes in earth history has held 
the,

2007
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:03,760
the,
the,

2008
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:08,750
the test of time and and what we see as 
1980 was a pivotal year.

2009
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:13,870
That was a year that three separate 
teams published evidence showing that 

2010
01:53:16,041 --> 01:53:21,041
the cretaceous tertiary boundary,
the dinosaur boundary was profoundly 

2011
01:53:21,041 --> 01:53:24,851
catastrophic,
and that opened the door to begin a 

2012
01:53:24,851 --> 01:53:26,600
reconsideration of earth history.
Now,

2013
01:53:26,630 --> 01:53:30,680
at the same time,
with the advent of the space program,

2014
01:53:30,990 --> 01:53:35,990
we are beginning to realize that near 
earth space is not a completely empty 

2015
01:53:36,501 --> 01:53:41,501
place.
It's actually densely populated by all 

2016
01:53:41,501 --> 01:53:41,501
kinds of things.
See,

2017
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:45,980
prior to the apollo moon program,
it was believed that most of the craters

2018
01:53:45,981 --> 01:53:47,750
on the moon,
if not all of the craters on the moon,

2019
01:53:47,751 --> 01:53:52,751
where volcanic right post apollo.
The realization was that no,

2020
01:53:53,211 --> 01:53:57,050
they're not volcanic.
There impacts of things from space c.

2021
01:53:57,380 --> 01:54:02,380
Now you're looking at the surface of the
moon and I think I'm the last image on 

2022
01:54:02,380 --> 01:54:06,740
the joe rogan images.
There is going to be a picture of the 

2023
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:10,301
moon and you'll see that it's littered 
littered thousands and thousands and 

2024
01:54:10,431 --> 01:54:11,210
thousands of craig

2025
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:16,280
and because it doesn't have an 
atmosphere because it doesn't have 

2026
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:16,350
plants,
we can actually see we can't explain.

2027
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:17,100
It's happened

2028
01:54:17,190 --> 01:54:22,190
and the point joe is this.
If we were unable to strip away the 

2029
01:54:22,190 --> 01:54:24,480
biosphere,
the thick layers of sedimentary rocks,

2030
01:54:24,510 --> 01:54:27,510
the oceans,
the earth would look like the moon.

2031
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:30,860
God damn it would look like fucking 
moon.

2032
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:35,920
So it's simply a matter of time and 
perspective that we really,

2033
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:39,560
well thank thankfully these people like 
you that are paying attention tests,

2034
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:44,920
but we with the amount of time that 
people have been videotaping things and 

2035
01:54:46,131 --> 01:54:49,580
writing books,
this tiny little window that just hasn't

2036
01:54:49,581 --> 01:54:54,581
been enough time to really get a real 
account of how often this takes place 

2037
01:54:54,581 --> 01:54:56,570
because that,
that amount of time,

2038
01:54:56,571 --> 01:54:59,690
although it's a grand amount of time 
compared to our lives,

2039
01:55:00,170 --> 01:55:03,140
the life of an individual for the life 
of the planet,

2040
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:05,570
it's nothing.
It's a perspective issue,

2041
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:06,530
the perspective.
Yeah,

2042
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:08,270
exactly.
Exactly.

2043
01:55:08,980 --> 01:55:13,980
And,
and this is one reason why I'm an 

2044
01:55:13,980 --> 01:55:16,331
advocate for moving forward and 
essentially becoming a cosmic 

2045
01:55:16,761 --> 01:55:18,650
civilization.
You see,

2046
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:22,910
I came of age during the heyday of the 
mercury and gemini,

2047
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:25,750
gemini and apollo programs,
and you know,

2048
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:27,530
that was the one thing when I looked 
back and I go,

2049
01:55:27,531 --> 01:55:28,070
well,
what?

2050
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:33,130
One of the last times that I was really 
proud of my country was when we put 

2051
01:55:33,130 --> 01:55:33,680
those men on the moon.
You know,

2052
01:55:33,710 --> 01:55:35,960
when we planted our aMerican flag on the
moon,

2053
01:55:36,290 --> 01:55:39,410
and I really believe back in 1969,
1970,

2054
01:55:39,411 --> 01:55:42,800
that we were america's destiny was to 
move the human

2055
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:48,150
into this grander cosmic environment.
And then of course,

2056
01:55:48,210 --> 01:55:53,210
you know,
the Vietnam war came along and other 

2057
01:55:53,210 --> 01:55:55,281
priorities and money got shifted in the 
nixon administration shifted huge 

2058
01:55:55,281 --> 01:55:56,610
amounts of money away from the space 
program.

2059
01:55:56,940 --> 01:56:01,940
The timetable that was set out that we 
were going to have a permanent lunar 

2060
01:56:01,940 --> 01:56:05,931
base by the end of the seventies,
first manned mission to mars before the 

2061
01:56:05,931 --> 01:56:10,280
eighties was over,
perhaps a independently self-supporting 

2062
01:56:10,280 --> 01:56:14,240
colonies in space by the year 2000.
Remember I was a junior in high school 

2063
01:56:15,151 --> 01:56:18,840
when a kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey 
came out.

2064
01:56:18,841 --> 01:56:19,890
Have you ever seen it?
Sure.

2065
01:56:20,070 --> 01:56:21,870
Yeah.
Nineteen,

2066
01:56:21,871 --> 01:56:23,640
68.
Nobody had any.

2067
01:56:24,030 --> 01:56:27,030
It was no stretch of the imagination to 
assumed that by 2001.

2068
01:56:27,031 --> 01:56:32,031
Yeah,
there were going to be orbiting hotels 

2069
01:56:32,031 --> 01:56:32,031
in space.
RIght.

2070
01:56:32,031 --> 01:56:34,350
That could have happened,
but we lost our vision.

2071
01:56:34,351 --> 01:56:38,660
We lost our will and we just got 
sidetracked.

2072
01:56:38,710 --> 01:56:40,710
You know,
I'm remembering the seventies talking to

2073
01:56:40,711 --> 01:56:43,260
people about the potential of colonizing
space,

2074
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:48,320
using the materials and resources found 
in space and that the knee jerk response

2075
01:56:50,101 --> 01:56:51,540
I always got was,
well,

2076
01:56:51,930 --> 01:56:53,790
we've got too many problems here on 
earth.

2077
01:56:53,820 --> 01:56:56,970
We got to solve those problems first.
Well,

2078
01:56:57,420 --> 01:56:58,920
my response to that was,
well,

2079
01:56:58,921 --> 01:57:02,610
good luck because you're basically 
talking about altering human nature,

2080
01:57:02,970 --> 01:57:07,970
right?
And it's going to take something more 

2081
01:57:07,970 --> 01:57:08,190
than just some policy to alter human 
nature.

2082
01:57:08,460 --> 01:57:13,410
What it's going to take is some serious 
a consciousness excursions,

2083
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:17,100
uh,
perhaps people going into space.

2084
01:57:17,190 --> 01:57:19,620
You know,
here we had these astronauts.

2085
01:57:19,621 --> 01:57:24,621
I met edgar mitchell years ago.
He's a a mace and he came to my lodge 

2086
01:57:24,621 --> 01:57:24,900
years ago,
edgar mitchell,

2087
01:57:25,470 --> 01:57:30,470
who was one of the astronauts.
He was one of the many astronauts that 

2088
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:31,600
went into space and like as in free 
mason as in freemasons,

2089
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:33,360
everybody freaks out and you say 
freemasons,

2090
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:36,510
illuminati,
black helicopter nonsense,

2091
01:57:36,511 --> 01:57:41,511
and we should have a whole session just 
to deal with that ridiculous nonsense 

2092
01:57:41,511 --> 01:57:43,290
next time you freaked me out about that.
Okay.

2093
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:46,580
So edgar mitchell,
when you met him,

2094
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:47,940
was he talking about aliens?

2095
01:57:47,980 --> 01:57:48,540
No,
no,

2096
01:57:48,550 --> 01:57:49,520
no,
no.

2097
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:52,140
He was talking about going into space 
and seeing god.

2098
01:57:52,410 --> 01:57:54,120
Whoa.
Crazier than aliens.

2099
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:55,470
Yeah.
Crazier than the aliens.

2100
01:57:55,471 --> 01:57:57,720
Has god made aliens?
Perhaps.

2101
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:01,020
So he saw god in the sense that he got a
sense.

2102
01:58:01,350 --> 01:58:05,130
It means without even saying god,
he got a sense of the,

2103
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:06,090
the,
the,

2104
01:58:06,270 --> 01:58:09,760
the grandness grand universe.
yes.

2105
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:11,160
And,
and yes.

2106
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:12,450
And,
and you know,

2107
01:58:12,451 --> 01:58:17,451
the potential role of humans in that.
Have you ever been to the keck 

2108
01:58:17,451 --> 01:58:17,610
observatory in Hawaii?
No,

2109
01:58:17,611 --> 01:58:20,040
I haven't.
The keck observatory in Hawaii is a very

2110
01:58:20,041 --> 01:58:25,041
unique place because it's on the big 
island of Hawaii and it's very high up 

2111
01:58:25,041 --> 01:58:25,950
in an altitude.
And when you get up there,

2112
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:29,130
you actually drive through the clouds.
I took my family,

2113
01:58:29,131 --> 01:58:32,110
there are several years ago and uh,
we were bummed out when I was like,

2114
01:58:32,111 --> 01:58:33,210
god.
So clowning,

2115
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:38,480
we're not gonna be able to see anything.
But then you pop through the clouds as 

2116
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:41,691
you continue to drive.
And the view is magnificent and in is

2117
01:58:42,220 --> 01:58:45,640
to this day,
one of the most intense experiences,

2118
01:58:45,970 --> 01:58:48,700
consciousness expanding experiences I've
ever had.

2119
01:58:48,701 --> 01:58:50,620
I believe it without drugs.
I mean,

2120
01:58:50,621 --> 01:58:53,860
it was like a psychedelic experience.
It really was because the,

2121
01:58:53,870 --> 01:58:56,200
the amount of.
That's the keck observatory.

2122
01:58:56,500 --> 01:58:59,680
See how it's above the clouds when you.
That's a daytime shot.

2123
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:01,540
See jamie,
see if he could pull up at nighttime,

2124
01:59:01,570 --> 01:59:05,950
nighttime shot because they set the 
camera aperture to capture the.

2125
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:08,130
I didn't,
I had a regular camera I couldn't have.

2126
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:11,590
I couldn't really capture the,
the actual stars themselves.

2127
01:59:11,860 --> 01:59:14,290
But you see the milky way,
like,

2128
01:59:14,350 --> 01:59:16,270
not like that.
It's way more intense than that.

2129
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:19,810
You see the milky way in its full form.
You see?

2130
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:21,010
All right.
Yeah.

2131
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,340
And there's so many stars.
It's,

2132
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:25,190
it's so shocking.
You,

2133
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:29,380
you're immediately forced to accept the 
reality that we're in space,

2134
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:34,560
whereas it's so easy to deny when all 
you see is the moon and a couple of 

2135
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:34,560
little dots,
like whatever,

2136
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:35,110
man,
I'm in hollywood,

2137
01:59:35,111 --> 01:59:36,730
I got to go to work and you drive and 
you get.

2138
01:59:37,060 --> 01:59:38,480
That's what it's like.
Yeah.

2139
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:39,610
And it's.
So,

2140
01:59:39,820 --> 01:59:40,360
it's,
it's,

2141
01:59:40,710 --> 01:59:43,690
that's just a photograph and that's,
you know,

2142
01:59:43,691 --> 01:59:46,840
obviously there's some doctor and going 
on because I don't know what those lines

2143
01:59:46,841 --> 01:59:50,470
are,
but it's insane how intense it is.

2144
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:52,910
It's insane and it's,
it's,

2145
01:59:53,130 --> 01:59:56,170
it's right above you.
It's right above us all the time.

2146
01:59:56,380 --> 01:59:58,540
That's what I love about the high desert
plateaus.

2147
01:59:58,870 --> 02:00:03,870
You've got this dry atmosphere and it's 
like literally you can almost reach out 

2148
02:00:03,870 --> 02:00:04,780
and touch the stars.
You know what you're talking about.

2149
02:00:05,110 --> 02:00:10,110
You've never been to la before.
This is your first trip to la because 

2150
02:00:10,110 --> 02:00:13,381
when you're in California,
you just go to the mojave and stare at 

2151
02:00:13,381 --> 02:00:16,030
space space and I stare at the rocks,
the rocks below my feet and the stars 

2152
02:00:16,361 --> 02:00:17,290
over my head.
Yeah.

2153
02:00:17,410 --> 02:00:20,950
How dId you get involved in the 
exploration of all this stuff?

2154
02:00:21,730 --> 02:00:22,420
Well,
you know,

2155
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:25,600
I guess I better,
it's time to come out of the closet,

2156
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:29,380
like I did a little too many drugs back 
in the sixties.

2157
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:31,090
Uh,
I think he did the right amount.

2158
02:00:31,110 --> 02:00:32,610
Yeah,
I think you're being hard on yourself.

2159
02:00:32,620 --> 02:00:34,570
Actually.
Actually,

2160
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:39,770
I'm in 1969,
so of course I wish I was raised in 

2161
02:00:39,770 --> 02:00:44,131
rural Minnesota and where we grew up,
we lived on the shores of a puddle of 

2162
02:00:44,131 --> 02:00:46,480
meltwater puddle leftover from the 
receding of the glaciers.

2163
02:00:46,490 --> 02:00:47,800
yeah,
call it a puddle.

2164
02:00:47,801 --> 02:00:48,970
It's,
I call it a puddle.

2165
02:00:48,971 --> 02:00:50,950
It was three quarters of a mile long.
It was just,

2166
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:51,700
you know,
Minnesota,

2167
02:00:51,701 --> 02:00:53,740
Wisconsin has got what,
25,000

2168
02:00:53,741 --> 02:00:58,741
lakes and every one of them is leftover 
meltwater puddles from the recession of 

2169
02:00:58,741 --> 02:01:03,031
the glacier,
so I can still remember being like six 

2170
02:01:03,031 --> 02:01:03,031
or seven years old.
And my dad telling me,

2171
02:01:03,031 --> 02:01:03,940
you know,
once upon a time,

2172
02:01:03,941 --> 02:01:07,150
this was thousands of feet under the ice
and that's how this.

2173
02:01:07,151 --> 02:01:10,120
We had land on the edge of this lake.
And um,

2174
02:01:10,640 --> 02:01:15,640
as a kid I used to sit in my backyard 
and fish for sunfish and crappies and 

2175
02:01:16,421 --> 02:01:21,421
bulkheads.
That's what I don't understand that 

2176
02:01:21,421 --> 02:01:21,421
interrupt for just one second.
How the fuck does that happen?

2177
02:01:21,421 --> 02:01:22,630
Were 10,000
years ago.

2178
02:01:22,631 --> 02:01:25,210
It's a glacier.
Ten thousand years later.

2179
02:01:25,300 --> 02:01:28,300
There's fish in there.
Where the fuck are the fish coming from?

2180
02:01:29,020 --> 02:01:30,460
I don't know,
but they were there.

2181
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:32,680
But how?
Where's the large mouth bass come from?

2182
02:01:32,830 --> 02:01:37,830
What's the.
All this with the lake trout and the 

2183
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:37,830
great lakes.
Where the fuck did they come from?

2184
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:39,860
If if 10,000
years ago.

2185
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:40,130
That

2186
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:41,090
was frozen.
Solid.

2187
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:42,080
Frozen.
Solid.

2188
02:01:42,140 --> 02:01:46,970
Where the fuck the lake trout come from?
I'll have to get to work on that joe,

2189
02:01:47,070 --> 02:01:49,250
because I don't know the answer.
I need to know man.

2190
02:01:49,251 --> 02:01:51,050
I'm freaking out.
How about northern pike?

2191
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:54,170
I mean northern pike.
You go to saskatchewan.

2192
02:01:54,190 --> 02:01:59,190
People fly in from all over the world to
go fishing up there because they have 

2193
02:01:59,190 --> 02:02:01,610
this massive population of beautiful 
northern pike.

2194
02:02:01,611 --> 02:02:04,220
These big that was frozen.
Yes.

2195
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:08,480
Saskatchewan was a mile of ice.
What the fuck man?

2196
02:02:08,570 --> 02:02:11,180
I'm freaking out.
That doesn't even make sense.

2197
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:13,340
Yeah.
So you saw this.

2198
02:02:13,370 --> 02:02:18,370
So you were a kid.
I was a kid growing up with that 

2199
02:02:18,370 --> 02:02:18,370
landscape,
so I got fascinated by it,

2200
02:02:18,370 --> 02:02:22,991
but in 1969 I went to a rock on outdoor 
rock concert that was at an airport 

2201
02:02:24,171 --> 02:02:26,810
called eden prairie.
that's in the.

2202
02:02:26,811 --> 02:02:29,750
I'm just outside of the twin cities,
minneapolis,

2203
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:34,250
and it's on a series of bluffs that 
overlooks the Minnesota river valley.

2204
02:02:34,490 --> 02:02:35,360
Right.
I'm,

2205
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:40,510
of course I'm stoned out of my gourd and
I was taking a break from the music and 

2206
02:02:42,040 --> 02:02:45,440
the ladies and everything and I went 
over and was standing on this bluff,

2207
02:02:45,730 --> 02:02:47,390
andy and jamie,
if you would pull up.

2208
02:02:47,391 --> 02:02:50,270
I think it's near the end of the 
pictures I brought for joe.

2209
02:02:50,271 --> 02:02:55,271
I have a beautiful example of scale 
invariance and this is going to be 

2210
02:02:55,271 --> 02:02:56,870
similar to what I saw.
And,

2211
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:59,000
and when you see it,
um,

2212
02:02:59,870 --> 02:03:02,900
that's,
that's like the 25 images that's labeled

2213
02:03:02,901 --> 02:03:06,500
for joe picture though.
It'll be towards the end.

2214
02:03:06,501 --> 02:03:10,730
It's a picture of the snake river.
Find it.

2215
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:12,680
wow.
The snake river.

2216
02:03:12,681 --> 02:03:17,681
Wait till you see this joe.
now this is an example of scale 

2217
02:03:17,681 --> 02:03:17,681
invariance.
Now what that means is that,

2218
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:18,810
you know,
yeah.

2219
02:03:18,830 --> 02:03:20,780
Here we go.
now look at this,

2220
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:25,810
what you see here,
where can folks that are just listening 

2221
02:03:25,810 --> 02:03:26,730
to this go and see these images is a 
there.

2222
02:03:26,810 --> 02:03:28,440
Are they on your website?
Uh,

2223
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:31,100
I think this one is on my website.
Yeah.

2224
02:03:31,101 --> 02:03:36,101
I think this one's on the snake river.
You see the snake river scale and 

2225
02:03:36,101 --> 02:03:37,970
variance,
meaning that the river at the bottom,

2226
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:43,000
obviously you see the lines all around 
it where it indicates that there was a 

2227
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:43,850
much,
much larger body of water.

2228
02:03:43,851 --> 02:03:45,110
One point much better.
This,

2229
02:03:45,650 --> 02:03:49,550
the modern snake river is about 50,000
cubic feet per second,

2230
02:03:49,970 --> 02:03:54,970
right at the end of the last ice age,
the river here was about 30 to 40 

2231
02:03:56,090 --> 02:04:01,090
million cubic feet per second.
So wAs that because of the melting 

2232
02:04:01,090 --> 02:04:04,121
glaciers,
the force of this particular was not 

2233
02:04:04,121 --> 02:04:08,081
directly fed by the melting glaciers.
It was the result of the catastrophic 

2234
02:04:08,081 --> 02:04:12,461
overflow of lake bonneville,
which was the result of massive,

2235
02:04:12,770 --> 02:04:17,770
prolonged torrential rainfall that just 
drowned all the deserts of the southern,

2236
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:21,800
of the western and southwestern United 
States.

2237
02:04:22,310 --> 02:04:25,910
And there was an overflow,
a spillway out of the lake,

2238
02:04:25,911 --> 02:04:30,911
bonneville basin in northern Utah,
and it's spilled over into the snake 

2239
02:04:30,911 --> 02:04:35,891
river plain of Idaho.
Thirty to 40 million cubic feet per 

2240
02:04:35,891 --> 02:04:37,830
second.
Cut this channel.

2241
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:43,280
Now you'll notice that the modern snake 
river occupies a small channel within 

2242
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:46,701
the big channel that scale invariance 
I'm the big river,

2243
02:04:47,930 --> 02:04:52,930
would have been about equivalent to six 
to 700 of the modern snake rivers.

2244
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:58,040
And what you're seeing here is an 
example of scale invariance say that the

2245
02:04:58,060 --> 02:05:01,350
little is superimposed upon this big 
sea.

2246
02:05:01,650 --> 02:05:06,650
Now in 1969,
I was standing on a bluff overlooking 

2247
02:05:06,650 --> 02:05:09,090
the Minnesota river valley,
similar to this,

2248
02:05:09,240 --> 02:05:14,240
right,
looking down at the little Minnesota 

2249
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:15,630
ribbon of the Minnesota river and seeing
it in this huge channel.

2250
02:05:16,580 --> 02:05:21,360
And I had an aha moment.
I had an aha moment and I realized I saw

2251
02:05:21,361 --> 02:05:26,361
then that this channel that this bluff I
was standing on had once been the bank 

2252
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:33,080
of a gigantic river,
thousands of times bigger than the 

2253
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:33,080
modern Minnesota river.

2254
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:38,030
But I didn't know it rationally in the 
sense that it took me another 10 or 15 

2255
02:05:38,221 --> 02:05:41,850
years of study and research before I 
could go back and say,

2256
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:44,820
yeah,
what my initial instinct,

2257
02:05:45,150 --> 02:05:50,150
looking out and seeing this matching set
of bluffs for five miles on the other 

2258
02:05:50,150 --> 02:05:54,981
side and seeing this small version of it
into modern river that I was right.

2259
02:05:56,310 --> 02:05:58,380
That I remember one time in the 
eighties,

2260
02:05:58,381 --> 02:06:03,381
I was giving a talk on that and I.
There was a geologist in the audience 

2261
02:06:03,381 --> 02:06:04,950
and he got up and he goes,
no,

2262
02:06:04,990 --> 02:06:05,270
no,
no,

2263
02:06:05,271 --> 02:06:05,600
no,
no,

2264
02:06:05,601 --> 02:06:05,970
no,
no.

2265
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:07,920
That big channel that was millions of 
years,

2266
02:06:07,921 --> 02:06:10,050
millions of years.
It took for that channel to form.

2267
02:06:10,051 --> 02:06:11,250
And I said,
no,

2268
02:06:11,251 --> 02:06:15,300
I don't think so.
And what happened was,

2269
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:17,400
is by him challenging me,
it really,

2270
02:06:17,401 --> 02:06:17,880
you know,
I said,

2271
02:06:17,881 --> 02:06:18,750
okay,
you know,

2272
02:06:18,751 --> 02:06:19,480
like an,
an,

2273
02:06:20,010 --> 02:06:22,140
an mma fighter getting challenged,
says,

2274
02:06:22,141 --> 02:06:23,340
okay,
I'm going to take you on,

2275
02:06:23,341 --> 02:06:28,341
you know,
I rose to the occasion and I spent 

2276
02:06:28,341 --> 02:06:32,090
literally years doing research on 
glacial geomorphology on paleo 

2277
02:06:32,731 --> 02:06:34,080
hydrology.
And of course,

2278
02:06:34,081 --> 02:06:35,490
at the end of the thing I knew that I 
was.

2279
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:37,980
My instincts were absolutely correct 
that yes,

2280
02:06:37,981 --> 02:06:41,250
now there is solid scientific,
documentable,

2281
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:46,340
verifiable evidence that this whole 
channel of the Minnesota river valley 

2282
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:51,170
was filled,
brim full with water at the end of the 

2283
02:06:51,170 --> 02:06:51,170
lesson,

2284
02:06:51,170 --> 02:06:52,080
so when he was saying it was millions of
years,

2285
02:06:52,090 --> 02:06:57,090
he's saying that same exact channel of 
water had never varied and that it had 

2286
02:06:57,271 --> 02:07:01,200
just cut through over millions and 
millions of years very slowly,

2287
02:07:01,620 --> 02:07:06,620
but does that sort of.
That doesn't seem rational because of 

2288
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:06,620
the width.
No,

2289
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:06,870
it doesn't.
You'd have to.

2290
02:07:06,910 --> 02:07:08,910
It doesn't.
It doesn't make.

2291
02:07:08,940 --> 02:07:12,240
So this goes along with what you were 
talking about earlier,

2292
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:17,480
that the idea that the ideas of science 
with that everything had taken place 

2293
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:20,130
much like evolution on a very gradual 
pace.

2294
02:07:20,190 --> 02:07:23,130
Exactly.
Is this the grand canyon as well?

2295
02:07:23,910 --> 02:07:24,650
No,
I would.

2296
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:26,280
Here's what I would saY about the grand 
canyon.

2297
02:07:27,390 --> 02:07:29,940
I think that the grand canyon is 
presently.

2298
02:07:29,941 --> 02:07:34,941
we can observe it,
that we can observe the Colorado rIver 

2299
02:07:34,941 --> 02:07:34,980
eroding the grand canyon.
However,

2300
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:39,550
I think that the erosion of the grand 
canyon is not uniform.

2301
02:07:39,580 --> 02:07:44,580
It's episodic or which means that the 
grand canyon has probably been there 

2302
02:07:45,131 --> 02:07:48,340
between two and 5 million years because 
for one thing,

2303
02:07:48,370 --> 02:07:52,750
the grand canyon wouldn't start eroding 
until the Colorado plateau had lifted up

2304
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:58,200
and 10 to 12 million years ago,
the rim rock of collar of the Colorado 

2305
02:07:58,200 --> 02:08:02,401
plateau is limestone,
which implies a shallow marine 

2306
02:08:02,401 --> 02:08:06,750
environment.
Right now when it's down at marine at 

2307
02:08:06,750 --> 02:08:08,050
sea level,
it's not going to road.

2308
02:08:08,590 --> 02:08:13,590
It's not until the whole plateau lifts 
up between five and 10 million years ago

2309
02:08:13,990 --> 02:08:18,990
that the downCutting can start.
So my takE On the grand canyon would be 

2310
02:08:20,561 --> 02:08:22,960
that.
What happens is is we have.

2311
02:08:23,680 --> 02:08:25,300
You have to understand this now.
This is,

2312
02:08:25,301 --> 02:08:29,170
this is I think now is the,
is the merging emerging paradigm.

2313
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:34,620
There are two modes of change.
The gradualist mode that we've seen 

2314
02:08:34,620 --> 02:08:38,850
dominating through know the last few 
hundred years at least sInce the advent 

2315
02:08:38,850 --> 02:08:42,961
of modern science and then the,
if you want to call it the catastrophic 

2316
02:08:42,961 --> 02:08:44,650
mode,
where is much change.

2317
02:08:44,650 --> 02:08:49,650
It's compressed into a few years or 
months or sometimes even days or weeks 

2318
02:08:50,110 --> 02:08:52,930
as normally would take thousands and 
thousands of years.

2319
02:08:53,590 --> 02:08:58,590
When I look at the grand canyon,
what I'm seeing there is episodes of 

2320
02:08:58,590 --> 02:09:02,581
catastrophic erosion,
probably stretching back over two and a 

2321
02:09:02,581 --> 02:09:06,211
half million years.
Remember I said the pleistocene was 

2322
02:09:06,211 --> 02:09:09,121
about two and a half million years.
What characterizes the pleistocene from 

2323
02:09:09,191 --> 02:09:14,191
the previous plyo scene is this 
alternating succession of glacial and 

2324
02:09:14,191 --> 02:09:18,781
interglacial ages.
This swinging back and forth between 

2325
02:09:18,781 --> 02:09:21,721
these two extremes,
those episodes of transition appear to 

2326
02:09:21,721 --> 02:09:26,611
be profoundly catastrophic and they are 
associated with things like massive 

2327
02:09:27,461 --> 02:09:29,530
storms,
massive rainfalls,

2328
02:09:29,531 --> 02:09:34,450
rising and falling of sea levels on a 
extreme a basis,

2329
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:40,200
and I think it's that that has created 
the grand canyon predominantly.

2330
02:09:41,141 --> 02:09:42,550
In fact,
the inner channel.

2331
02:09:42,551 --> 02:09:44,680
I know if you've ever seen grand canyon.
Yeah.

2332
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:49,830
Okay.
There's an inner gorge I could guess at 

2333
02:09:49,830 --> 02:09:50,530
that inner gorgeous,
probably less than 100,000

2334
02:09:50,531 --> 02:09:53,740
years old and uh,
probably a lot of it was cut 13,000

2335
02:09:53,741 --> 02:09:54,810
years ago.
Wow.

2336
02:09:55,260 --> 02:09:58,720
And so that's when the pleistocene ended
somewhere around 10,000

2337
02:09:58,750 --> 02:10:00,910
years ago.
Ten to 13,000

2338
02:10:00,911 --> 02:10:02,200
years ago.
Wow.

2339
02:10:02,230 --> 02:10:03,070
Yeah.
That's a,

2340
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:06,190
that's not a real fixture is it seems 
like an artist's rendition.

2341
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:09,730
Yeah.
I have pictures somewhere in there where

2342
02:10:09,731 --> 02:10:12,200
you still get a sense.
Yeah.

2343
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:13,450
Now the,
the,

2344
02:10:13,510 --> 02:10:18,510
the,
the accumulation of the sedimentary 

2345
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:18,510
rocks.
Yeah.

2346
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:20,650
Took hundreds of millions of years,
but that's one process.

2347
02:10:20,710 --> 02:10:23,950
The downcutting,
the erosion of the canyon is a different

2348
02:10:23,951 --> 02:10:25,510
process.
So again,

2349
02:10:25,511 --> 02:10:30,511
it comes to a matter of perspective that
we're almost incapable of.

2350
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:32,440
Let me,
I think,

2351
02:10:32,530 --> 02:10:34,340
you know,
academically

2352
02:10:34,670 --> 02:10:39,670
and you could sort of explain how all 
this takes place and explain what's 

2353
02:10:41,271 --> 02:10:46,271
happening,
but in our minds are our perspective of 

2354
02:10:46,271 --> 02:10:47,480
living a hundred years.
Looking back,

2355
02:10:47,481 --> 02:10:49,500
it's very difficult to go back 20 years 
ago.

2356
02:10:49,540 --> 02:10:50,780
Oh,
I remember when that happened.

2357
02:10:50,781 --> 02:10:51,590
Wow.
Barely.

2358
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:54,890
But this is,
that ain't shit compared to the earth,

2359
02:10:55,030 --> 02:11:00,030
the earth,
the earth is just constantly changing 

2360
02:11:00,030 --> 02:11:03,031
and our knowledge of human history,
we have this sort of static view and 

2361
02:11:03,031 --> 02:11:06,380
occasionally we have that meteor that 
flew over Russia recently and blew up in

2362
02:11:06,381 --> 02:11:07,850
the sky and everybody's like,
whoa,

2363
02:11:07,851 --> 02:11:08,760
what's,
uh,

2364
02:11:08,780 --> 02:11:10,910
what's that?
And then it stops.

2365
02:11:10,930 --> 02:11:13,150
Then nothing go back to work,
go back to work,

2366
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:14,680
go back to sleep.
Yeah.

2367
02:11:14,740 --> 02:11:16,520
And that thing that blew up over Russia,
that was,

2368
02:11:16,670 --> 02:11:21,670
that was a spec and there was nothing.
And then those turn goose which blew up 

2369
02:11:21,670 --> 02:11:22,520
in the early 19 hundreds.

2370
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:23,060
Nineteen.
Oh,

2371
02:11:23,061 --> 02:11:24,590
eight.
June 30th,

2372
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:25,490
19.
Oh eight.

2373
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:30,520
Which just flat and thousands and 
thousands of acres.

2374
02:11:30,590 --> 02:11:31,520
Oh,
well,

2375
02:11:31,521 --> 02:11:36,521
let's see.
It was 800 square miles and 640 acres 

2376
02:11:36,521 --> 02:11:40,931
per square mile.
So it flat and a half a million acres,

2377
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:47,000
a million acres.
And that was the energy of that was 

2378
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,020
about equivalent to a 15 megaton bomb 
pull up.

2379
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:50,750
There's an image of tongue goes.
Yeah,

2380
02:11:50,850 --> 02:11:54,650
just all the trees completely flattened.
Completely flat.

2381
02:11:54,810 --> 02:11:57,290
A few look at that.
Gangster tree is still standing there.

2382
02:11:57,291 --> 02:11:58,670
Hasn't happened.
I know.

2383
02:11:58,671 --> 02:12:01,580
It's just like every now and then just 
one bad motherfucker tree.

2384
02:12:01,800 --> 02:12:03,290
That's how people stay alive,
right?

2385
02:12:03,560 --> 02:12:07,970
Because just like everybody else died or
most things died and most of the species

2386
02:12:07,971 --> 02:12:12,971
died.
a few people figured out a way to make 

2387
02:12:12,971 --> 02:12:12,971
it.
And then they decided to have babies.

2388
02:12:13,310 --> 02:12:15,930
What a bunch of crazy fucked.
Could you imagine?

2389
02:12:15,931 --> 02:12:17,180
A giant asteroid hits.

2390
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:22,180
Kills everybody.
Rotten people and woolly mammoths all 

2391
02:12:22,180 --> 02:12:25,030
over the place and you're still horny,
still horny,

2392
02:12:25,311 --> 02:12:30,311
and you make a baby like wow,
and you raise it and that baby makes 

2393
02:12:30,311 --> 02:12:31,910
more bikes.
What does it say in the book of genesis?

2394
02:12:32,420 --> 02:12:35,480
Be fruitful and multiply.
Now get this the word,

2395
02:12:35,570 --> 02:12:39,440
replenish the earth,
replenish the earth and subdue it.

2396
02:12:39,441 --> 02:12:44,441
I think clearly that's a clear hint that
saying this is not the primordial 

2397
02:12:45,171 --> 02:12:48,290
creation.
It's a subsequent creation to something.

2398
02:12:48,400 --> 02:12:52,610
A previous order of things.
Why you used the word replenish.

2399
02:12:53,150 --> 02:12:58,150
Be fruitful and multiply.
It would make sense if if the human 

2400
02:12:58,150 --> 02:13:01,121
population crashes in the wake of a 
global catastrophe and we're down 

2401
02:13:01,121 --> 02:13:05,480
hovering at the threshold of viability 
where you know,

2402
02:13:05,900 --> 02:13:10,900
we could become extinct if just anything
else happens and we want to.

2403
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:13,010
We want to preserve our species while 
the.

2404
02:13:13,011 --> 02:13:16,250
Probably the thing we need to be doing 
is having a lots of sex.

2405
02:13:16,650 --> 02:13:18,200
Hm.
That's what I'm talking about.

2406
02:13:18,260 --> 02:13:19,900
Yeah,
I know.

2407
02:13:20,030 --> 02:13:24,860
I mean we need to do a lots of screwing 
and we need to screw and make scientists

2408
02:13:24,861 --> 02:13:26,780
to figure out how to get us off this 
rock.

2409
02:13:26,890 --> 02:13:27,800
Yeah.
Well,

2410
02:13:27,860 --> 02:13:29,840
see,
be fruitful and multiply.

2411
02:13:29,900 --> 02:13:31,950
It makes patient replenish the earth

2412
02:13:32,340 --> 02:13:34,530
and subdue it.
What the hell is that?

2413
02:13:34,590 --> 02:13:36,480
Is this a subdue it?
Subdue it.

2414
02:13:36,510 --> 02:13:40,620
That's in genesis in genesis.
What the hell are they talking about?

2415
02:13:40,621 --> 02:13:42,210
They're choke the earth.
Well,

2416
02:13:42,211 --> 02:13:44,340
I see.
That's the way it's been interpreted.

2417
02:13:44,341 --> 02:13:46,950
I think it's being interpreted to say,
look,

2418
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:50,880
you guys are the only rational species 
down there.

2419
02:13:51,180 --> 02:13:53,280
You've got these big brains,
you know,

2420
02:13:53,281 --> 02:13:55,360
you gotta be born before,
you know,

2421
02:13:55,540 --> 02:14:00,540
it takes you years and years to actually
get where you can survive on your own 

2422
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:01,850
because you've got these big fucking 
brain.

2423
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:05,670
See?
So we're kind of like nature's answer to

2424
02:14:05,671 --> 02:14:07,320
all of this.
You know,

2425
02:14:07,860 --> 02:14:12,860
only one species right now has the 
ability to intercede and prevent the 

2426
02:14:14,161 --> 02:14:16,890
next global catastrophe.
And that's us.

2427
02:14:17,370 --> 02:14:20,370
Do we rise to that challenge or do we 
say,

2428
02:14:20,371 --> 02:14:22,200
well,
we're going to let nature run its course

2429
02:14:22,201 --> 02:14:25,110
and if 50 percent of the species 
disappear,

2430
02:14:25,140 --> 02:14:26,760
civilization is over.

2431
02:14:27,060 --> 02:14:29,670
We go back to the stone age struggling 
for existence.

2432
02:14:29,671 --> 02:14:30,600
Well,
so be it.

2433
02:14:30,601 --> 02:14:33,330
That's what's in the cards or do we say,
you know what?

2434
02:14:33,870 --> 02:14:38,100
We could be in one generation be 
harvesting to resources of asteroids,

2435
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:42,480
which we could be if we had the will 
innovation and the thing is,

2436
02:14:42,870 --> 02:14:45,990
is that the most dangerous asteroids 
that are out there,

2437
02:14:45,991 --> 02:14:49,380
it's the closer they get to the earth,
the more accessible they are.

2438
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:54,800
And,
and you see we already could be 

2439
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:56,811
harvesting the resources of astra.
I meAn asteroids are loaded with 

2440
02:14:56,811 --> 02:14:58,200
precious metals and ors and 
hydrocarbons.

2441
02:14:58,201 --> 02:15:03,201
there's virtually nothing that we are 
now mining from the earth that we 

2442
02:15:03,201 --> 02:15:04,290
couldn't mind from asteroids.
Wow.

2443
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:06,900
What does that suggest to you?
Well,

2444
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:08,520
and,
and think about this,

2445
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:11,640
if,
if I like to kind of imagine a scenario,

2446
02:15:11,641 --> 02:15:16,641
suppose we had discovered,
remember shoemaker levy nine?

2447
02:15:17,310 --> 02:15:18,570
Yes.
Okay.

2448
02:15:18,630 --> 02:15:23,630
Discovered in march of 1996,
within about eight weeks of 

2449
02:15:23,630 --> 02:15:28,341
observations,
the astronomers were able to predict 

2450
02:15:28,341 --> 02:15:31,580
that these fragmented pieces,
we're going to orbit the sun and 

2451
02:15:31,580 --> 02:15:34,810
comeback and be crossing the orbit of 
jupiter at exactly the time to jupiter 

2452
02:15:34,810 --> 02:15:35,190
was there,
right?

2453
02:15:35,640 --> 02:15:37,440
There was going to be a t bone 
collision.

2454
02:15:37,441 --> 02:15:42,441
It was like two vehicles coming to the 
intersection at the same time and they 

2455
02:15:42,441 --> 02:15:43,350
were able to predict that right down to 
the,

2456
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:48,440
almost to the minute to the hemisphere,
what if we discovered that there's an 

2457
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:53,121
asteroid orbiting the sun out there 
that's got our number on it and it was 

2458
02:15:53,121 --> 02:15:56,421
going to strike the earth and three 
years or 10 years or 20 years or 

2459
02:15:56,421 --> 02:15:57,420
whatever.
What would be our response to it?

2460
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:01,230
What will we do?
I think globally it would be,

2461
02:16:01,380 --> 02:16:04,380
there would have to be some sort of a 
collective x effort.

2462
02:16:04,770 --> 02:16:07,830
Yeah.
The scientists from China and Russia and

2463
02:16:07,890 --> 02:16:12,890
all these different various countries 
that have a vast technological 

2464
02:16:12,890 --> 02:16:15,720
capabilities would probably get together
and have some sort of an agreement.

2465
02:16:16,140 --> 02:16:18,980
I would think that that would have to 
happen and it would fact,

2466
02:16:19,170 --> 02:16:24,170
it would probably make our petty human 
conflicts pale into insignificance if we

2467
02:16:25,951 --> 02:16:30,951
were faced with the demise of 
civilization or even possibly our 

2468
02:16:30,951 --> 02:16:35,641
species,
but suppose we discovered it and it's 

2469
02:16:35,641 --> 02:16:40,231
coming in a couple of years and there's 
no time to respond.

2470
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:42,220
What could we do?
Well,

2471
02:16:42,730 --> 02:16:45,760
perhaps if we had a loNg enough lead 
time,

2472
02:16:46,270 --> 02:16:51,270
we could actually deflect.
All we need to do is is is an asteroid 

2473
02:16:51,270 --> 02:16:55,151
that's on a collision course with the 
aerosol it has to do is be nudged a 

2474
02:16:55,151 --> 02:16:57,520
little bit in a direct hit,
can be a wide miss.

2475
02:16:57,640 --> 02:17:02,640
See,
that's all we would have to do is just 

2476
02:17:02,640 --> 02:17:04,201
nudge it a little and there's various 
potential technologies whereby we could 

2477
02:17:04,201 --> 02:17:08,161
do that,
but what if we didn't have enough lead 

2478
02:17:08,161 --> 02:17:08,161
time and we knew that,
that it was going to slam into the earth

2479
02:17:08,161 --> 02:17:12,600
and for a thousand years gonna be havoc.

2480
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:14,710
What would we do?
Well,

2481
02:17:14,711 --> 02:17:19,711
perhaps we could go build a base on the 
moon or build a a something in space 

2482
02:17:19,711 --> 02:17:24,310
that would allow humans to survive at 
least until the dust settled enough that

2483
02:17:24,311 --> 02:17:27,460
we could return and begin to replenish 
the earth.

2484
02:17:27,461 --> 02:17:32,461
you know what a bummer it would be if 
you had a base on the moon and everyone 

2485
02:17:32,461 --> 02:17:32,461
was living there and you wash the earth 
below up.

2486
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:35,080
Total bummer,
but it would be even bigger.

2487
02:17:35,081 --> 02:17:38,080
Bummer if you didn't have it and you 
were sitting on the earth.

2488
02:17:38,410 --> 02:17:39,820
Knowing that that's it,
man,

2489
02:17:39,821 --> 02:17:40,720
that's all she wrote.

2490
02:17:42,100 --> 02:17:47,100
How many different times do you think 
that this has happened while human 

2491
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:48,950
beings are alive and how the,
the,

2492
02:17:48,990 --> 02:17:53,990
the great speculation has always been 
when they see the pyramids or when they 

2493
02:17:53,990 --> 02:17:57,931
see any incredible structures that we 
really haven't totally explained how 

2494
02:17:58,091 --> 02:18:03,091
they built what like bow back in Lebanon
is what,

2495
02:18:03,700 --> 02:18:08,700
how advanced were they?
How advanced were they before the shit 

2496
02:18:08,741 --> 02:18:09,370
hit the fan?

2497
02:18:09,890 --> 02:18:12,760
Well,
it seems to me then in order to,

2498
02:18:12,980 --> 02:18:14,810
you know,
you gotta go,

2499
02:18:15,140 --> 02:18:20,140
why would primitive cultures move rocks 
that weighed 200 to a thousand tons?

2500
02:18:23,930 --> 02:18:26,540
Apparently with impunity,
they were doing it all over the planet,

2501
02:18:26,690 --> 02:18:29,120
right?
W why would,

2502
02:18:29,150 --> 02:18:30,950
why would somebody be motivated?
I mean,

2503
02:18:30,951 --> 02:18:31,670
you know,
like again,

2504
02:18:31,671 --> 02:18:34,770
I'm a builder so I know how much work it
takes to move even a,

2505
02:18:35,250 --> 02:18:36,470
you know,
without a crane,

2506
02:18:36,471 --> 02:18:38,620
without modern technology to move,
uh,

2507
02:18:38,710 --> 02:18:39,150
uh,
uh,

2508
02:18:39,370 --> 02:18:42,290
a beam into place that weighs a ton.
Right?

2509
02:18:42,830 --> 02:18:43,340
Well,
you know,

2510
02:18:43,341 --> 02:18:46,820
we've got stones in some of these 
ancient temples that way.

2511
02:18:46,970 --> 02:18:50,240
Hundreds of tons and again,
all over the world.

2512
02:18:50,990 --> 02:18:55,990
It seems to me difficult to imagine that
they didn't have some kind of a 

2513
02:18:55,990 --> 02:19:00,881
technology that we've forgot what that 
technology is.

2514
02:19:00,980 --> 02:19:02,800
I couldn't say,
um,

2515
02:19:03,620 --> 02:19:08,420
but it would sure seem to me that there 
would be no motive for moving,

2516
02:19:09,080 --> 02:19:11,030
you know,
500 tons stones,

2517
02:19:11,180 --> 02:19:14,360
unless you had some convenient way of 
doing it or

2518
02:19:14,650 --> 02:19:19,650
if not a convenient way of doing it.
just explain how an inconvenient way 

2519
02:19:21,370 --> 02:19:26,370
they could have done it.
When you get something like the 

2520
02:19:26,370 --> 02:19:27,710
acropolis or the parthenon that's on the
acropolis,

2521
02:19:27,711 --> 02:19:28,270
right?
Isn't that,

2522
02:19:28,271 --> 02:19:33,271
what is the part?
The acropolis is the stone and the 

2523
02:19:33,271 --> 02:19:34,900
parthenon is what's on the hill complex 
on it,

2524
02:19:34,940 --> 02:19:37,700
but the parthenon is one of those 
impulse.

2525
02:19:37,730 --> 02:19:41,450
The acropolis is a manmade construction 
that has massive,

2526
02:19:41,480 --> 02:19:44,240
massive stones that they just don't 
explain.

2527
02:19:44,410 --> 02:19:45,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

2528
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:46,010
I mean,
they're there.

2529
02:19:46,011 --> 02:19:49,280
They're in there.
They're in cusco in south America.

2530
02:19:50,430 --> 02:19:53,170
They're in Egypt.
Yeah.

2531
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:58,240
There it is.
The ball back one is actually probably 

2532
02:19:58,240 --> 02:19:58,240
even more impressive.
Chamie.

2533
02:19:58,240 --> 02:19:59,390
See if he could pull that up and stones 
have a ball.

2534
02:19:59,420 --> 02:20:01,910
How do you spell it?
B double a l,

2535
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:02,750
b,
e,

2536
02:20:02,780 --> 02:20:07,780
k and there there's these stones are 
just unbelievably big.

2537
02:20:08,640 --> 02:20:13,640
Yeah,
and no explanation for how they moved 

2538
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:17,551
them,
cut them and them got them into place 

2539
02:20:17,551 --> 02:20:17,870
and what year it was all done,
right.

2540
02:20:18,410 --> 02:20:22,400
That's one vision of it or a picture of 
it,

2541
02:20:22,401 --> 02:20:27,401
but if you search for others is actually
a closeup of the actual stones 

2542
02:20:27,801 --> 02:20:32,801
themselves and they show people standing
next to the stone so you get a 

2543
02:20:32,801 --> 02:20:33,530
perspective of it.
Much,

2544
02:20:33,950 --> 02:20:36,440
much taller than a human being.
In fact,

2545
02:20:36,510 --> 02:20:41,510
I think 10 or 11 feet tall and some 
places like there's one rock just like 

2546
02:20:43,310 --> 02:20:46,160
fuck that.
But some of the stones,

2547
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:47,270
the.
That's not a good one,

2548
02:20:47,271 --> 02:20:52,271
jamie.
There's some where you can see the 

2549
02:20:52,271 --> 02:20:52,330
massive amount of,
uh,

2550
02:20:52,340 --> 02:20:57,340
of,
of stone that was in each individual 

2551
02:20:57,340 --> 02:20:59,711
one.
Some of them are literally building 

2552
02:20:59,711 --> 02:21:00,700
sized and it's just an individual stone 
and yeah,

2553
02:21:00,780 --> 02:21:03,230
there's one like,
what the fuck man,

2554
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:06,710
what the fuck is that?
That is so big.

2555
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:10,400
They moved that.
They cut that query.

2556
02:21:10,401 --> 02:21:11,880
Didn't move it.
Yeah.

2557
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:14,150
I mean,
I don't know how many people they had to

2558
02:21:14,151 --> 02:21:17,840
do that,
but boy that doesn't seem like something

2559
02:21:17,841 --> 02:21:22,310
that a society which is really concerned
with feeding itself is a is going to get

2560
02:21:22,311 --> 02:21:24,790
done what?

2561
02:21:25,730 --> 02:21:28,820
So when you see like the constructions 
of the great pyramids,

2562
02:21:28,821 --> 02:21:33,821
which is one of the great wonders of the
world and to this day they're always 

2563
02:21:33,821 --> 02:21:34,550
trying to come up with ways that they 
did it,

2564
02:21:34,551 --> 02:21:38,210
but the sheer size and to put it into 
perspective,

2565
02:21:38,270 --> 02:21:41,030
if you cut and I think the number is 10 
stones,

2566
02:21:41,031 --> 02:21:43,990
that debt is $6 million,
300,000

2567
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:49,120
plus stones in the great pyramid of giza
and if you cut and placed 10 a day,

2568
02:21:50,360 --> 02:21:54,320
it would take you 664 years.
Yeah.

2569
02:21:54,360 --> 02:21:55,630
I,
you know.

2570
02:21:56,480 --> 02:22:01,480
Yeah.
Having seen the great pyramid and many 

2571
02:22:01,480 --> 02:22:03,320
of the temples in Egypt,
I'm convinced that they had to have some

2572
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:08,030
means that we've forgotten about for 
transporting these stones.

2573
02:22:08,470 --> 02:22:13,470
You know,
they may have used fairly primitive 

2574
02:22:13,470 --> 02:22:16,930
methods to quarry the stones,
but when it comes to transporting the 

2575
02:22:17,481 --> 02:22:19,220
stones,
you know,

2576
02:22:19,221 --> 02:22:24,221
I mean,
we could imagine that they're putting 

2577
02:22:24,221 --> 02:22:24,770
them on rollers and dragging them over 
hill and dale,

2578
02:22:24,771 --> 02:22:29,771
but again,
you got to go really all over the whole 

2579
02:22:29,771 --> 02:22:29,771
planet.

2580
02:22:30,970 --> 02:22:32,670
It just,
it's one of those things,

2581
02:22:32,671 --> 02:22:35,220
it's like the demise of the frozen 
woolly mammoths.

2582
02:22:35,221 --> 02:22:37,800
There's just no real explanation.
And,

2583
02:22:37,820 --> 02:22:42,820
and we can invoke explanations that are 
basically designed to avoid the 

2584
02:22:43,201 --> 02:22:48,201
implications of admitting that there may
have been advanced knowledge,

2585
02:22:48,631 --> 02:22:52,860
scientific knowledge in prehistory,
and that somehow or another,

2586
02:22:52,861 --> 02:22:55,590
that knowledge was lost,
whether it was because of the burning of

2587
02:22:55,591 --> 02:23:00,591
the library of alexandria or whether it 
was just a cataclysmic event that wiped 

2588
02:23:01,651 --> 02:23:06,651
out a massive amount of the population.
And what was remaining was buildings 

2589
02:23:06,651 --> 02:23:08,670
like that.
Those things survived.

2590
02:23:08,730 --> 02:23:13,730
And then people tried to recreate them.
People eventually figured out some of 

2591
02:23:14,581 --> 02:23:17,400
the techniques and made similar 
structures,

2592
02:23:17,730 --> 02:23:21,410
but not over a period of a thousand 
years or two years,

2593
02:23:21,420 --> 02:23:23,580
but maybe 20,
30,000

2594
02:23:23,581 --> 02:23:28,581
years.
That's always been the work of graham 

2595
02:23:28,581 --> 02:23:28,581
hancock,
the,

2596
02:23:28,581 --> 02:23:28,581
the,
uh,

2597
02:23:28,581 --> 02:23:33,261
the ideas they bounced around and uh,
I remember there was that charlton 

2598
02:23:33,261 --> 02:23:37,911
heston narrated a documentary on the 
sphinx where they had gone into great 

2599
02:23:38,401 --> 02:23:41,250
detail about the erosion and they 
brought him the geologists,

2600
02:23:41,251 --> 02:23:43,110
robert schoch from boston university.

2601
02:23:43,110 --> 02:23:45,960
I know robert,
I want to get him on the podcast too.

2602
02:23:45,961 --> 02:23:50,961
He's a fascinating cat and he concluded 
that the temple,

2603
02:23:51,310 --> 02:23:56,310
the sphinx,
the enclosure where it was cut out of 

2604
02:23:56,310 --> 02:23:57,480
shows thousands of years of erosion by 
rainfall,

2605
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:02,840
which there wasn't rainfall in the nile 
valley before 9,000

2606
02:24:03,871 --> 02:24:07,620
years ago.
So it predates the pyramid construction,

2607
02:24:07,621 --> 02:24:09,300
the average or the,
uh,

2608
02:24:09,301 --> 02:24:12,630
the conventional dating of the pyramid.
There it is right there.

2609
02:24:12,640 --> 02:24:16,140
There's some explanations.
It predates the,

2610
02:24:16,670 --> 02:24:20,370
what the conventional date of the 
pyramid is by more than 5,000

2611
02:24:20,371 --> 02:24:21,510
years.
Oh,

2612
02:24:21,511 --> 02:24:26,511
I'm convinced.
And I've had conversations with robert 

2613
02:24:26,511 --> 02:24:28,650
where he will basically say he's got one
number for public consumption,

2614
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:32,430
but he's perfectly willing to admit that
perhaps this makes is much,

2615
02:24:32,431 --> 02:24:33,860
much older than that.
And I,

2616
02:24:34,500 --> 02:24:36,660
what's the dark number?
What's the crazy number?

2617
02:24:36,900 --> 02:24:41,900
Oh,
I think that the crazy number is tens of

2618
02:24:42,150 --> 02:24:43,170
thousands of years if you pull up.

2619
02:24:43,230 --> 02:24:48,230
It's not that crazy though.
Now it was kind of crazy when that 

2620
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:50,220
charlton heston documentary,
the documentary was around,

2621
02:24:50,430 --> 02:24:55,430
but now that they found go beckley 
tapping and they know that 14,000,

2622
02:24:55,981 --> 02:24:56,880
12,000
years ago,

2623
02:24:56,881 --> 02:25:01,881
whatever it was,
they were absolutely building these 

2624
02:25:01,881 --> 02:25:04,050
enormous,
immense structures that would be what,

2625
02:25:04,080 --> 02:25:06,090
8,000
years,

2626
02:25:06,091 --> 02:25:08,510
70,000
years earlier than the pyramids.

2627
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:11,160
Not that.
Not that big a deal.

2628
02:25:11,430 --> 02:25:12,710
Not that big of a deal.
They,

2629
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:17,720
they,
the conventional dating of the great 

2630
02:25:17,720 --> 02:25:17,880
pyramid of giza is 2,500
bc,

2631
02:25:18,030 --> 02:25:23,030
which may be correct,
but it still doesn't mean that the 

2632
02:25:23,030 --> 02:25:24,640
sphinx wasn't way older than me.
Way older than that.

2633
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:25,930
Exactly.
And you know,

2634
02:25:26,050 --> 02:25:30,940
I'm convinced having seen it firsthand 
that that erosion is water induced.

2635
02:25:30,970 --> 02:25:34,900
I've looked at a lot of erosioN over the
years and you know,

2636
02:25:34,901 --> 02:25:39,220
it's got the classic parabolic profile 
that you would expect if you started out

2637
02:25:39,221 --> 02:25:40,540
with an initially square.

2638
02:25:40,960 --> 02:25:45,960
I'm jamie,
open up the powerpoint show entitled a 

2639
02:25:45,960 --> 02:25:47,980
cataclysmic,
most global super flood,

2640
02:25:48,310 --> 02:25:50,980
cataclysmic global superstar.
That's my new band.

2641
02:25:52,230 --> 02:25:55,010
It's going to be my new band.
Go for me.

2642
02:25:55,180 --> 02:26:00,180
Cataclysmic.
Cataclysmic was the greek term for the 

2643
02:26:00,180 --> 02:26:00,820
destruction of the world by water.
Oh wow.

2644
02:26:00,950 --> 02:26:03,820
From where we get our term cataclysm.
Whoa.

2645
02:26:04,090 --> 02:26:05,740
And their term.
See,

2646
02:26:05,741 --> 02:26:10,741
you know,
the greeks believed that they were 

2647
02:26:10,741 --> 02:26:10,810
alternating destructions of the world by
water and fire,

2648
02:26:11,050 --> 02:26:15,670
right?
Eq per paralysis was the term greek term

2649
02:26:15,671 --> 02:26:17,590
for the destruction of the world by 
fire.

2650
02:26:18,100 --> 02:26:19,440
Wow.
And um,

2651
02:26:19,660 --> 02:26:24,660
cataclysmic of,
of water on this stuff is so 

2652
02:26:24,660 --> 02:26:29,131
unbelievably fascinating because there's
no way that you can attribute all of 

2653
02:26:30,371 --> 02:26:32,110
this stuff.
I mean,

2654
02:26:32,111 --> 02:26:35,470
these,
all of these ancient structures,

2655
02:26:35,590 --> 02:26:40,060
there's no way you can attribute it to 
what we know about their culture.

2656
02:26:40,330 --> 02:26:43,120
We don't know enough.
There's just not enough evidence.

2657
02:26:43,120 --> 02:26:47,830
There's not enough.
We don't know enough about ancient Egypt

2658
02:26:47,831 --> 02:26:52,831
or you know,
or their construction methods are so 

2659
02:26:52,831 --> 02:26:53,560
much.
There's so much thinking,

2660
02:26:54,610 --> 02:26:57,850
so much guesswork,
so much.

2661
02:26:58,270 --> 02:27:03,270
You know,
when you look at these giant structures 

2662
02:27:03,270 --> 02:27:03,270
and you wonder,
like,

2663
02:27:03,270 --> 02:27:03,490
what,
what were they doing?

2664
02:27:03,491 --> 02:27:05,470
How did they do this?
Who are they like?

2665
02:27:05,950 --> 02:27:08,150
It's so fascinating.
I would just,

2666
02:27:08,590 --> 02:27:12,640
I would love to be able to go back in 
time inside a giant bulletproof bubble.

2667
02:27:12,730 --> 02:27:15,610
I know.
Just hover over ancient Egypt.

2668
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:17,920
That was going on back then.
I know.

2669
02:27:17,950 --> 02:27:22,930
When did you guys know jamie go?
You've got a global super fluid.

2670
02:27:22,931 --> 02:27:27,931
What is this image?
Go to slide 58 slash 58.

2671
02:27:29,050 --> 02:27:31,480
The infamous slide 58.

2672
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:36,090
Hanger 18.
Slide 58 hours.

2673
02:27:36,091 --> 02:27:37,330
There it is.
Wow.

2674
02:27:37,331 --> 02:27:38,800
That's beautiful.
Okay,

2675
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:43,480
that's amazing.
Now what you can see there is you got to

2676
02:27:43,481 --> 02:27:45,430
get it into the microphone.
Get on the microphone there.

2677
02:27:45,460 --> 02:27:47,280
The valley temple up there.
Oh yeah.

2678
02:27:47,281 --> 02:27:52,281
Okay.
The valley temple with stones quarried 

2679
02:27:52,281 --> 02:27:56,010
from the ditch around the sphinx and 
you've got to remember what the sphinx 

2680
02:27:56,410 --> 02:27:59,170
is that originally it was a yard day,
which is a,

2681
02:27:59,260 --> 02:28:04,260
which is a limestone outcrop that sticks
above the surrounding landscape that 

2682
02:28:04,260 --> 02:28:07,000
yardang was the head of the sphinx.
Everything else was below.

2683
02:28:07,420 --> 02:28:09,010
Now go to the next slide,
jamie.

2684
02:28:10,990 --> 02:28:15,990
Okay.
There yoU can really see the ditch 

2685
02:28:15,990 --> 02:28:15,990
surrounding the sphinx and the layers 
forming.

2686
02:28:15,990 --> 02:28:19,510
The sphinx body correspond to the layers
into surrounding ditch.

2687
02:28:19,900 --> 02:28:22,250
Now wanting to me notice the scaffolding

2688
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:24,140
next to the sphinx.
They're there.

2689
02:28:24,210 --> 02:28:29,210
They're there,
they're undertaking these campaigns of 

2690
02:28:29,210 --> 02:28:29,210
rests,
quote unquote,

2691
02:28:29,210 --> 02:28:33,071
restoration grows,
but what they're actually doing is 

2692
02:28:33,071 --> 02:28:33,920
they're covering up the real message of 
the sphinx.

2693
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,950
Know why are they doing that?
Why are they bothering to try to rebuild

2694
02:28:36,951 --> 02:28:39,950
the thing?
Know it's so stupid like,

2695
02:28:39,951 --> 02:28:41,450
wait,
you're not rebuilding it.

2696
02:28:41,451 --> 02:28:43,130
You're building new shit.
Yeah,

2697
02:28:43,140 --> 02:28:46,120
you're just rephrasing it with,
with new stones.

2698
02:28:46,121 --> 02:28:51,121
So gross,
but at least nobody is messing with the 

2699
02:28:51,121 --> 02:28:54,911
quarry walls where you can see the water
erosion so effectively displayed.

2700
02:28:56,210 --> 02:28:58,340
Go to the next slide,
jamie.

2701
02:28:59,360 --> 02:29:02,380
Now what we see here is an abandoned 
quarry.

2702
02:29:03,620 --> 02:29:08,330
It's hard to tell the scale here because
that opening is like 40 feet high,

2703
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:12,470
but if you look at,
you see the striations in the rock wall.

2704
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:15,770
Okay?
This is where they quarried the blocks,

2705
02:29:15,890 --> 02:29:17,450
right?
And remove the blocks.

2706
02:29:17,480 --> 02:29:19,070
Go to the next slide,
jamie.

2707
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:25,630
Okay.
This kind of shows the methodology that 

2708
02:29:25,630 --> 02:29:25,630
they use.
They,

2709
02:29:25,630 --> 02:29:26,000
they would create these separation 
trenches.

2710
02:29:26,030 --> 02:29:31,030
They would usually go by the,
the natural bed bedding layers of the 

2711
02:29:31,491 --> 02:29:36,491
rock.
Go to the next slide and you'll see 

2712
02:29:36,491 --> 02:29:40,181
here,
here's the presumed process where 

2713
02:29:40,181 --> 02:29:43,780
they're cutting a separation tranche and
there's a block about to be quarried 

2714
02:29:44,031 --> 02:29:49,031
there.
And then you can see there would have a 

2715
02:29:49,031 --> 02:29:49,031
stack of four blocks there.
And these blocks are enormous.

2716
02:29:49,031 --> 02:29:49,790
Several tons.
Oh yeah.

2717
02:29:49,791 --> 02:29:51,320
That,
that block there would be,

2718
02:29:51,550 --> 02:29:56,270
it looks like it's probably about four 
by eight by probably 10.

2719
02:29:56,390 --> 02:30:01,390
So like 320 cubic feet at 160 per.
So,

2720
02:30:02,970 --> 02:30:04,220
uh,
or 180.

2721
02:30:04,221 --> 02:30:09,040
So you're looking at about 57,000
pounds divided by 2000.

2722
02:30:09,620 --> 02:30:10,420
So yeah,
about two.

2723
02:30:11,640 --> 02:30:12,830
Yeah,
about 30 tons.

2724
02:30:12,880 --> 02:30:15,440
She's got 30 tons for that rock right 
there.

2725
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:17,030
Now go to the next slide.

2726
02:30:17,480 --> 02:30:19,220
Thirty tons.
Okay.

2727
02:30:19,221 --> 02:30:24,221
Now the reason I'm showing you this is 
because this is the process they would 

2728
02:30:24,221 --> 02:30:25,640
have used to quarry the blocks away from
the,

2729
02:30:26,780 --> 02:30:30,800
the surrounding the sphinx and exposed a
quarry wall.

2730
02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:36,100
Well,
at the time that quarry wall was 

2731
02:30:36,100 --> 02:30:38,351
exposed,
it would have been essentially a flat 

2732
02:30:38,351 --> 02:30:40,100
surface with this slightly stepped 
profile like we saw in the photograph.

2733
02:30:40,130 --> 02:30:42,440
Right now,
go to the next slide,

2734
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:48,760
right?
So there's now would be a cross section 

2735
02:30:48,760 --> 02:30:49,010
with all of the blocks removed.
Okay,

2736
02:30:49,011 --> 02:30:54,011
go to the next slide.
And what we have here is stone pick 

2737
02:30:54,051 --> 02:30:59,051
marks in a limestone quarry from 
pharmacy times about 1200 bc.

2738
02:31:00,351 --> 02:31:01,760
So about 3,200
years ago.

2739
02:31:01,761 --> 02:31:06,761
So here's a limestone face of a quarry 
that's been exposed for 3000,

2740
02:31:06,831 --> 02:31:10,900
200 years and it seems like they used to
some sort of a chisel to get that out.

2741
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:13,220
Exactly.
The pick marks are still visible.

2742
02:31:13,250 --> 02:31:15,350
Go to the next slide.
Okay.

2743
02:31:15,351 --> 02:31:19,590
Here's stone pick marks in a quarry from
nearly new kingdom circa 15.

2744
02:31:19,591 --> 02:31:20,640
So 3,500

2745
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:25,640
years ago you can actually determine the
type of tool that they used to quarry 

2746
02:31:27,031 --> 02:31:29,220
the rocks.
The picks are the chisels.

2747
02:31:29,550 --> 02:31:32,430
Go to the next one based on the market 
are based on tomorrow.

2748
02:31:32,490 --> 02:31:37,490
Yeah.
And here you see that the chisel marks 

2749
02:31:37,490 --> 02:31:38,100
made or pick marks made by stone picks 
in an old kingdom.

2750
02:31:38,101 --> 02:31:40,890
Limestone quarry,
2000 years bc.

2751
02:31:40,891 --> 02:31:45,891
So here's a 4,000
year old quarry that's been sitting 

2752
02:31:45,891 --> 02:31:48,561
exposed to the desert elements and the 
pick marks are still visible on the 

2753
02:31:48,561 --> 02:31:50,370
face.
Now go to the next slide.

2754
02:31:51,150 --> 02:31:56,150
Now here's the spanx.
Go to the next slide and look at that 

2755
02:31:56,150 --> 02:31:56,930
quarry wall.
Yeah,

2756
02:31:57,010 --> 02:31:58,470
that's crazy.
It's crazy.

2757
02:31:58,890 --> 02:31:59,720
Yeah.
Now,

2758
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:03,870
supposedly this quarry wall is only a 
few centuries older than net.

2759
02:32:03,871 --> 02:32:08,871
Last picture.
We just saw where we could see the pic 

2760
02:32:08,871 --> 02:32:08,871
marks.
Does that make sense?

2761
02:32:08,871 --> 02:32:13,430
Well,
the only way it would make sense as if 

2762
02:32:13,430 --> 02:32:13,430
there was a vastly different type of 
stone.

2763
02:32:13,430 --> 02:32:14,070
Well,
it's not though.

2764
02:32:14,071 --> 02:32:15,730
It's the same.
It's a.

2765
02:32:15,750 --> 02:32:20,750
Well indurated limestone.
Robert can tell you all about the 

2766
02:32:20,750 --> 02:32:20,910
composition of that stone,
but the.

2767
02:32:20,911 --> 02:32:23,080
The composition does vary though.
Oh yeah,

2768
02:32:23,090 --> 02:32:23,950
correct.
Like some.

2769
02:32:23,951 --> 02:32:25,800
Some of it's more dense than others and 
that's.

2770
02:32:25,860 --> 02:32:30,860
you can see the changes and you can see 
that that indented layer about halfway 

2771
02:32:31,351 --> 02:32:33,180
up,
it's going to be a softer limestone.

2772
02:32:33,510 --> 02:32:36,630
Absolutely.
It certainly looks to the layman and I'm

2773
02:32:36,631 --> 02:32:41,631
clearly a layman,
but it certainly looks like like water 

2774
02:32:41,631 --> 02:32:41,631
fishers,
like,

2775
02:32:41,631 --> 02:32:43,650
oh,
fishers that are driven rainfall.

2776
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:46,320
Even to the trained eye,
it looks like water,

2777
02:32:46,350 --> 02:32:51,350
but some legit egyptologists and even 
legit geologists have tried to attribute

2778
02:32:52,531 --> 02:32:56,970
this to a wind and sand.
Well,

2779
02:32:57,300 --> 02:33:02,300
again,
you know robert has shown pictures of 

2780
02:33:02,300 --> 02:33:04,380
the comparison of wind erosion or water 
erosion and they don't look the same,

2781
02:33:04,470 --> 02:33:07,920
so the only reason to attribute this to 
wind and sand,

2782
02:33:07,980 --> 02:33:12,980
it's not based on the scientific 
evidence of what it looks like when 

2783
02:33:12,980 --> 02:33:12,980
there's water erosion.

2784
02:33:12,980 --> 02:33:17,720
It's to confirm or to conform with the 
known or established timeline of 

2785
02:33:17,720 --> 02:33:18,990
construction.
Yes,

2786
02:33:18,991 --> 02:33:23,991
and that's why I showed you those 
examples of other core like that old 

2787
02:33:23,991 --> 02:33:25,920
kingdom quarry that's almost the same 
age as this,

2788
02:33:25,950 --> 02:33:30,150
so it's actually really not scientific 
to try to attribute it to wind and sand.

2789
02:33:30,180 --> 02:33:35,180
It's just your.
What you're doing is confirming to 

2790
02:33:35,180 --> 02:33:35,180
confirmation bias.
You have,

2791
02:33:35,180 --> 02:33:39,260
you have an idea in your head and you're
trying to to make this really odd 

2792
02:33:40,801 --> 02:33:45,801
erosion fit into that,
but that doesn't look like wind and 

2793
02:33:45,801 --> 02:33:47,520
sand.
Go to the next in lik joey,

2794
02:33:48,560 --> 02:33:51,600
jamie,
I'll jam band.

2795
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:56,220
So there's the depth of the,
of the,

2796
02:33:56,640 --> 02:34:01,640
of the ditch.
It's about 22 feet and eric show shows 

2797
02:34:01,640 --> 02:34:01,830
each of the layers.
Like if you look at layer of Lebanon,

2798
02:34:01,831 --> 02:34:06,831
that's going to be a softer limestone.
it's eroded deeper right now.

2799
02:34:07,351 --> 02:34:12,351
Go to the next slide and you'll see what
I've done is superimposed what the 

2800
02:34:12,351 --> 02:34:16,701
original profile would have looked like 
and there's been an enormous amount of 

2801
02:34:16,701 --> 02:34:21,351
rock limestone rock removed and we know 
the profile would have looked like that 

2802
02:34:21,351 --> 02:34:25,591
because the stones that were quarried 
are what make up the sphinx and valley 

2803
02:34:25,591 --> 02:34:25,591
temples.

2804
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:30,680
The no's have been eroded as well,
but unfortunately they've covered that 

2805
02:34:30,680 --> 02:34:32,440
up with this reconstruction.
Most likely,

2806
02:34:32,470 --> 02:34:35,500
most likely,
and I think robert would confirm this,

2807
02:34:35,530 --> 02:34:40,530
that the limestone blocks at formed 
those temples were sheathed in hard 

2808
02:34:40,530 --> 02:34:43,420
granted.
Whereas this quarry wall was not.

2809
02:34:43,450 --> 02:34:47,020
It was exposed and then there's also the
issue of the sphinx head itself,

2810
02:34:47,021 --> 02:34:50,160
which seems to have been altered in 
this.

2811
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:54,190
This is a timeline thing that folks may 
or may not know,

2812
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:57,880
but there's been.
The Egypt changed quite a bit,

2813
02:34:57,910 --> 02:35:02,910
mean Egypt.
Ancient Egypt was around for thousands 

2814
02:35:02,910 --> 02:35:05,341
and thousands of years and at some point
they were conquered by the nubians and 

2815
02:35:05,341 --> 02:35:09,610
the more african,
what we think of as traditional african 

2816
02:35:09,610 --> 02:35:09,910
feet.
Obviously Egypt as part of africa,

2817
02:35:09,911 --> 02:35:14,911
but the more traditional looking african
faces is what you see in the current 

2818
02:35:14,951 --> 02:35:19,780
face in the temple this face.
So probably whaT had happened is a later

2819
02:35:19,781 --> 02:35:21,250
date pharaoh said,
you know what?

2820
02:35:21,250 --> 02:35:23,830
Fuck this line.
I want my face up there.

2821
02:35:24,100 --> 02:35:29,100
So they put the face of this probably 
catherine [inaudible] and I think both 

2822
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:32,590
John Anthony West and robert schoch 
would concur with.

2823
02:35:32,620 --> 02:35:35,560
That's why there's so little erosion on 
that face.

2824
02:35:36,050 --> 02:35:41,050
That face is only a few thousand years 
old and why it would be 

2825
02:35:41,050 --> 02:35:41,080
disproportionately small compared to the
rest of the body.

2826
02:35:41,710 --> 02:35:43,410
So fascinating.
I've just.

2827
02:35:43,630 --> 02:35:48,630
I would give so much to know what they 
knew then if any point in time to go 

2828
02:35:48,971 --> 02:35:51,430
back in human history and just to be 
able to observe.

2829
02:35:51,610 --> 02:35:55,120
That would be the time that the just the
middle of Egypt.

2830
02:35:55,121 --> 02:35:58,720
I would love to see what it looked like 
before they raided it and took off.

2831
02:35:58,721 --> 02:36:03,721
For folks that don't know,
it was covered in smooth limestone and 

2832
02:36:03,721 --> 02:36:06,070
they cut it all up to build cairo.
They rated it.

2833
02:36:06,220 --> 02:36:11,220
Yeah.
There was an earthquake that flattened 

2834
02:36:11,220 --> 02:36:13,561
cairo and you know they had attempted to
penetrate the great pyramid prior to 

2835
02:36:13,561 --> 02:36:16,570
that without success,
but apparently the earthquake,

2836
02:36:16,571 --> 02:36:21,571
which I think happened,
I think it happened in the twelfth 

2837
02:36:21,571 --> 02:36:24,361
century,
loosened a few rocks from near the top 

2838
02:36:24,361 --> 02:36:28,561
of the pyramid that allowed them to get 
some levers in there and begin to pry 

2839
02:36:28,561 --> 02:36:28,561
them loose.

2840
02:36:28,561 --> 02:36:32,910
So I've read a bunch of fucking assholes
talk about vandalism that get this,

2841
02:36:33,730 --> 02:36:35,770
whether this is true or not,
we have no way of knowing,

2842
02:36:35,771 --> 02:36:40,771
but there are many,
many arabic accounts and accounts of 

2843
02:36:40,771 --> 02:36:44,790
early travelers and pretty much they all
unanimously declare that the entire 

2844
02:36:45,581 --> 02:36:50,581
outside of the pyramid was inscribed.
Now think about that.

2845
02:36:51,100 --> 02:36:53,440
What in the hell would that have been 
telling?

2846
02:36:53,441 --> 02:36:57,220
What kind of message was that that was 
being sent to the future?

2847
02:36:57,610 --> 02:36:59,260
That must've been amazing.
Yeah.

2848
02:36:59,261 --> 02:37:00,160
I get.
I get my.

2849
02:37:00,910 --> 02:37:04,910
My hair stands up on my legs.
Just thinking about inscribed.

2850
02:37:05,410 --> 02:37:07,030
Yeah.
Hey listen,

2851
02:37:07,330 --> 02:37:12,330
there's rocks in space and occasionally 
they land and when they do you're 

2852
02:37:12,330 --> 02:37:13,870
fucked.
Build one of these.

2853
02:37:14,140 --> 02:37:16,010
get inside,
wait for

2854
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:21,010
further instruction.
It's amazing that there.

2855
02:37:21,260 --> 02:37:23,270
I mean,
if that thing existed,

2856
02:37:23,271 --> 02:37:28,271
if you've robert schoch has corrected,
nothing existed before the holocene 

2857
02:37:28,611 --> 02:37:33,611
events.
Those are the only types of structures 

2858
02:37:33,611 --> 02:37:34,820
that would still be here.
Yeah,

2859
02:37:35,430 --> 02:37:36,230
exactly.
Fuck,

2860
02:37:36,231 --> 02:37:39,590
did people make it through there?
I wonder what the number was.

2861
02:37:39,710 --> 02:37:41,690
Well,
I'm going to adam and eve story.

2862
02:37:41,720 --> 02:37:43,130
Here's my theory on it.
You know,

2863
02:37:44,060 --> 02:37:49,060
all over the world we have traditions 
about cactus catastrophes and cataclysms

2864
02:37:49,791 --> 02:37:54,791
and giant floods all over the world.
They've come down to us and there's a 

2865
02:37:54,921 --> 02:37:59,921
lot of deviation,
but there's also a lot of similarity in 

2866
02:37:59,921 --> 02:38:02,860
them.
The idea that a small group had some 

2867
02:38:02,860 --> 02:38:02,860
kind of foreign knowledge,
you know,

2868
02:38:02,860 --> 02:38:06,940
whether it was knowing the bible or do 
kalien in the greek myths or wooten,

2869
02:38:06,950 --> 02:38:10,670
a pitch to him into samarian myths,
or is this a thrusts or man knew.

2870
02:38:10,671 --> 02:38:11,550
I mean the,
the,

2871
02:38:11,580 --> 02:38:16,580
the culture heroes that survived these 
great cataclysmic floods are into dozens

2872
02:38:17,720 --> 02:38:17,720
and dozens.

2873
02:38:17,720 --> 02:38:22,720
Right?
American indians had prolific traditions

2874
02:38:23,691 --> 02:38:26,690
about giant floods when,
when george,

2875
02:38:26,691 --> 02:38:28,880
caitlin,
the famous indian artist,

2876
02:38:29,060 --> 02:38:34,060
spent decades of his life going around 
living with various indian tribes like 

2877
02:38:34,250 --> 02:38:37,190
40 years painting and in writing about 
him,

2878
02:38:37,760 --> 02:38:39,710
very interesting quote in one of his 
books,

2879
02:38:39,711 --> 02:38:44,711
he says that they're widely divergent 
with traditions and language and customs

2880
02:38:45,381 --> 02:38:49,700
and so on,
but have a hundred and 20 tribes that he

2881
02:38:49,701 --> 02:38:54,701
visited.
They all had one thing in common that 

2882
02:38:54,701 --> 02:38:57,980
they were descended from survivors of 
some gigantic cataclysmic event.

2883
02:38:59,570 --> 02:39:01,970
That's american indian.
Do you find it in north America?

2884
02:39:01,971 --> 02:39:06,140
You find it in south America.
You find it in the polynesian islands.

2885
02:39:06,141 --> 02:39:08,960
You find it in Australia,
Japan.

2886
02:39:09,110 --> 02:39:11,120
I mean,
it's around the entire planet.

2887
02:39:11,540 --> 02:39:16,540
This idea,
and now modern science is confirming 

2888
02:39:16,540 --> 02:39:20,330
what we assumed was merely some kind of 
superstitious nonsense.

2889
02:39:20,331 --> 02:39:21,220
Have,
you know,

2890
02:39:21,660 --> 02:39:24,080
pre scientific illiterate,
barbarians.

2891
02:39:24,260 --> 02:39:29,260
And we're realizing that those myths and
those stories and epic tales that have 

2892
02:39:29,260 --> 02:39:32,891
been handed down for centuries and 
centuries actually contained hard 

2893
02:39:32,891 --> 02:39:34,760
scientific truth from surviving 
eyewitnesses.

2894
02:39:35,090 --> 02:39:37,340
Well,
if these craters actually do exist,

2895
02:39:37,341 --> 02:39:40,790
and they do right,
craters undeniable.

2896
02:39:40,791 --> 02:39:43,430
The nuclear glass throughout asia and 
europe,

2897
02:39:43,431 --> 02:39:46,910
undeniable human beings were alive then.
Yes,

2898
02:39:47,090 --> 02:39:49,910
and if human beings were alive,
then they got fucked up.

2899
02:39:50,360 --> 02:39:51,640
There's no doubt about it.
Yeah,

2900
02:39:52,370 --> 02:39:52,920
they did.
They,

2901
02:39:52,970 --> 02:39:53,410
they,
they,

2902
02:39:53,420 --> 02:39:56,330
they would have suffered enormously and 
just like,

2903
02:39:56,331 --> 02:39:57,410
you know,
if,

2904
02:39:58,070 --> 02:40:03,070
if you know,
if three quarters of the species of 

2905
02:40:03,070 --> 02:40:05,231
animals in north America when extinct,
do you think that the 25 percent 

2906
02:40:05,231 --> 02:40:06,320
surviving came through completely 
unscathed?

2907
02:40:06,770 --> 02:40:09,350
No.
It simply means that there's a threshold

2908
02:40:09,590 --> 02:40:13,040
above which species is viable.
It can survive.

2909
02:40:13,080 --> 02:40:15,930
There's there and below,
which you know,

2910
02:40:15,931 --> 02:40:19,740
there may have been survivors,
but there just weren't enough of them.

2911
02:40:19,740 --> 02:40:24,740
They were too widely scattered,
serious habitat loss which would have 

2912
02:40:24,740 --> 02:40:26,520
diminished food supply in a just died 
out,

2913
02:40:26,880 --> 02:40:31,880
but either directly or indirectly as a 
result of these catastrophic 

2914
02:40:31,880 --> 02:40:34,140
environmental changes that accompanied 
the ending of the ice age.

2915
02:40:34,350 --> 02:40:39,350
Humans had to have been affected by this
and all of the myths and the stories 

2916
02:40:40,770 --> 02:40:43,590
would totally concur with that idea.
You know,

2917
02:40:43,591 --> 02:40:44,080
that,
that,

2918
02:40:44,081 --> 02:40:47,520
that there were humans and,
and they're all consistent with this one

2919
02:40:47,521 --> 02:40:49,390
detail,
that there were some humans that had for

2920
02:40:49,391 --> 02:40:54,391
knowledge and so they built arcs to 
kalea and built an ark just like noah 

2921
02:40:54,391 --> 02:40:54,391
did,
wooten,

2922
02:40:54,391 --> 02:40:57,630
dipesh to built an ark.
Zissel sutras built an ark man,

2923
02:40:57,660 --> 02:41:01,320
new built an ark.
Where are these stories coming from?

2924
02:41:01,480 --> 02:41:06,480
You know,
are they just completely conjured up 

2925
02:41:06,480 --> 02:41:08,481
independently of one another and that 
detail is just thrown in or is there 

2926
02:41:08,481 --> 02:41:12,000
some kind of a reality behind this that 
there were people who had for knowledge?

2927
02:41:12,210 --> 02:41:17,210
Well,
if there were people that had foreign 

2928
02:41:17,210 --> 02:41:19,730
success to suggest to me that there were
two groups of survivors,

2929
02:41:20,310 --> 02:41:25,310
those who survived because they 
intentionally planned to survive.

2930
02:41:25,440 --> 02:41:29,250
They had for knowledge.
They took steps to secure their survival

2931
02:41:29,490 --> 02:41:31,740
in freemasonry there.
So the account of,

2932
02:41:31,741 --> 02:41:34,680
um,
of lamech or the account of enoch,

2933
02:41:34,681 --> 02:41:37,200
there's variances on it.
But enoch,

2934
02:41:37,230 --> 02:41:38,670
the story of enoch in,
in,

2935
02:41:38,730 --> 02:41:41,610
in masonic tradition says that enoch 
had,

2936
02:41:41,611 --> 02:41:42,720
you know,
he was in the,

2937
02:41:42,840 --> 02:41:47,760
into the patriarchs before noah had this
for knowledge,

2938
02:41:47,761 --> 02:41:50,520
that the world was going to be destroyed
either by fire or flood.

2939
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:55,230
So he created this underground vault.
It was deep underground,

2940
02:41:55,231 --> 02:42:00,231
and it was cool.
It was preserved within nine layers of 

2941
02:42:00,231 --> 02:42:03,621
stone.
It was nine layered vault and you only 

2942
02:42:03,621 --> 02:42:06,400
in unless you had the key to accessing 
to,

2943
02:42:06,480 --> 02:42:11,480
to how to access this vault,
which was now like a time capsule that 

2944
02:42:11,480 --> 02:42:15,561
preserved the science and the knowledge 
and the wisdom of the [inaudible] world 

2945
02:42:16,081 --> 02:42:17,160
or pre flood world.

2946
02:42:18,270 --> 02:42:21,090
He then set up two pillars,
pillar of brass,

2947
02:42:21,091 --> 02:42:26,091
and a pillar of marble.
The pillar of brass designed to 

2948
02:42:26,091 --> 02:42:27,660
withstand the effects of the cataclysm.
The lottery destruction.

2949
02:42:27,930 --> 02:42:30,300
The pillar of marble,
if I'm remembering it right,

2950
02:42:30,301 --> 02:42:32,700
was to withstand the,
the,

2951
02:42:32,760 --> 02:42:34,770
uh,
the destruction by fire.

2952
02:42:35,220 --> 02:42:40,220
So there were these two pillars that 
basically informed any survivors that 

2953
02:42:40,220 --> 02:42:44,541
there was this nine chambered 
underground fault that contained the 

2954
02:42:44,541 --> 02:42:47,100
secrets of the previous world age that 
has what's coming to a pass.

2955
02:42:47,550 --> 02:42:50,490
And that's an intrinsic part of masonic 
tradition.

2956
02:42:50,491 --> 02:42:55,491
In fact,
the whole masonic symbolism is based 

2957
02:42:55,491 --> 02:42:55,530
around that idea.
And um,

2958
02:42:56,220 --> 02:42:59,790
and it has parallels throughout other 
traditions as well.

2959
02:43:00,090 --> 02:43:01,980
Well,
what I'm getting at here is if,

2960
02:43:02,340 --> 02:43:07,340
if there was some people who had for 
knowledge of it and took steps to 

2961
02:43:07,340 --> 02:43:11,451
survive,
they were the ones who preserved the 

2962
02:43:11,451 --> 02:43:12,290
knowledge of the pre,
the,

2963
02:43:12,310 --> 02:43:14,920
the previous,
the antediluvian world order,

2964
02:43:16,240 --> 02:43:18,700
the other survivors just survive by the 
luck of the draw.

2965
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,070
Like that tree standing there,
right?

2966
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:23,560
They just happened to be in the right 
place at the right time.

2967
02:43:23,561 --> 02:43:28,561
They survived,
but now they are going to be the ones 

2968
02:43:28,561 --> 02:43:31,090
who are going to be wholly preoccupied 
simply with the task of surviving,

2969
02:43:31,120 --> 02:43:36,120
finding enough food to eat and shelter.
Because clearly the planetarium 

2970
02:43:36,931 --> 02:43:39,310
environment was going through all kinds 
of changes.

2971
02:43:39,880 --> 02:43:44,710
Whereas the other group had taken actual
steps to survive and preserve knowledge.

2972
02:43:44,980 --> 02:43:49,980
Now,
when we look at the beginning of 

2973
02:43:49,980 --> 02:43:49,980
recorded history,
4,000

2974
02:43:49,980 --> 02:43:53,371
to 5,000
years ago were basically halfway back 

2975
02:43:53,371 --> 02:43:53,371
through the holocene.
Right,

2976
02:43:53,650 --> 02:43:57,280
okay.
Let's for purposes of conjecture,

2977
02:43:57,281 --> 02:44:00,910
assumed that the end of the holocene 
human population crashed,

2978
02:44:01,960 --> 02:44:02,860
right?
Well,

2979
02:44:02,861 --> 02:44:04,930
if you want to build a pyramid or a 
great temple,

2980
02:44:04,960 --> 02:44:07,090
you've got to have a labor force,
right?

2981
02:44:07,750 --> 02:44:12,750
Well,
if you've got scattered bands of 

2982
02:44:12,750 --> 02:44:12,820
survivors,
you basically aren't going to be able to

2983
02:44:12,821 --> 02:44:13,690
accomplish that.

2984
02:44:14,290 --> 02:44:19,290
Now,
let's assume that you've got two groups 

2985
02:44:19,290 --> 02:44:21,331
of humanity,
one that's sitting there with all of 

2986
02:44:21,331 --> 02:44:23,431
this knowledge at their disposal,
just like imagine if our modern society 

2987
02:44:23,431 --> 02:44:26,440
was wiped off the face of the earth,
but somebody somewhere in some deep cave

2988
02:44:26,441 --> 02:44:31,441
underground was able to preserve our 
knowledge of physics and chemistry and 

2989
02:44:31,441 --> 02:44:34,000
and the various sciences.
Well,

2990
02:44:34,150 --> 02:44:39,150
obviously in order to run this computer 
that we're running here to do this 

2991
02:44:39,150 --> 02:44:41,110
broadcast requires an intact huge,
intact infrastructure.

2992
02:44:41,111 --> 02:44:42,120
Right?
Well,

2993
02:44:42,130 --> 02:44:44,400
we could know how to build a computer.
We could know how to do,

2994
02:44:44,470 --> 02:44:47,530
how to broadcast,
but if we don't have the infrastructure,

2995
02:44:47,560 --> 02:44:49,480
we're just sitting on information,
right?

2996
02:44:50,320 --> 02:44:55,320
Well,
let's assume that you have a group that 

2997
02:44:55,320 --> 02:44:55,320
survived,
right?

2998
02:44:55,320 --> 02:44:59,341
And they've got,
they're the custodians of this body of 

2999
02:44:59,341 --> 02:45:01,180
knowledge right now.
It takes 3000,

3000
02:45:01,181 --> 02:45:02,530
4,000,
5,000

3001
02:45:02,531 --> 02:45:06,970
years for the human population to 
reconstitute itself and now you've got a

3002
02:45:06,971 --> 02:45:11,971
labor force and let's suppose that 
there's gonna be another cataclysm 

3003
02:45:11,971 --> 02:45:12,520
impending,
you know,

3004
02:45:12,970 --> 02:45:15,530
such as the one that perhaps caused the,
the,

3005
02:45:15,540 --> 02:45:16,690
the noah's flood,
which,

3006
02:45:17,020 --> 02:45:19,510
you know,
there's evidence now that around 5,000

3007
02:45:19,511 --> 02:45:22,780
years ago there was an asteroid impact 
into the indian ocean,

3008
02:45:23,470 --> 02:45:23,830
right?

3009
02:45:24,250 --> 02:45:27,170
That plunge through two miles of ocean 
water and blasted a,

3010
02:45:27,450 --> 02:45:30,970
a 12 mile wide hole on the floor of the 
indian ocean.

3011
02:45:31,060 --> 02:45:33,370
And what year was this?
This would have been about 5,000

3012
02:45:33,371 --> 02:45:38,371
years ago now.
How much of an impact would that have 

3013
02:45:38,371 --> 02:45:38,371
had?
Oh,

3014
02:45:38,371 --> 02:45:40,000
it would have created tsunamis.
Well,

3015
02:45:40,420 --> 02:45:44,800
I'm on the island of Madagascar and the 
southern island of Madagascar,

3016
02:45:44,801 --> 02:45:49,801
and it should be in this,
in this program that we've got open 

3017
02:45:49,801 --> 02:45:49,870
right here.
Jamie.

3018
02:45:49,930 --> 02:45:54,930
Um,
if you go to slide number,

3019
02:45:56,420 --> 02:45:58,430
yeah,
go to slide number 111.

3020
02:46:01,520 --> 02:46:06,520
It's so ironic that today our focus is 
closer and closer to the cloud and 

3021
02:46:09,621 --> 02:46:10,040
closer

3022
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:13,850
to chips to solid state,
hard drives,

3023
02:46:13,851 --> 02:46:16,430
all these different things that are just
not going to last,

3024
02:46:16,460 --> 02:46:17,900
right?
No paper.

3025
02:46:17,901 --> 02:46:18,980
No,
but no one's carbon.

3026
02:46:18,981 --> 02:46:20,630
Anything in stone,
you know,

3027
02:46:21,090 --> 02:46:24,500
the knowledge that we have is like how 
much of what,

3028
02:46:24,530 --> 02:46:28,980
what everybody has his own hard drives.
I mean how much of what everybody has is

3029
02:46:28,981 --> 02:46:32,330
in the cloud on a server somewhere.
Yeah.

3030
02:46:32,880 --> 02:46:37,880
And who the fuck is going to be able to 
figure out how to read that shit a 

3031
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:37,880
thousand years from now.
Yeah.

3032
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:38,630
Just anything happened to us.

3033
02:46:39,110 --> 02:46:41,450
We're trying to figure out how to read 
egyptian hieroglyphs.

3034
02:46:42,220 --> 02:46:42,770
Okay.
Look at.

3035
02:46:42,860 --> 02:46:47,750
Look at slide number 111.
Now wish I had my pointer here.

3036
02:46:48,320 --> 02:46:50,720
Go to the next slide so you can see we.
Okay.

3037
02:46:50,990 --> 02:46:51,920
Right there.
You see,

3038
02:46:52,070 --> 02:46:55,070
you see those weekly things like dragon 
scales?

3039
02:46:55,130 --> 02:46:58,520
Yeah.
What that is is it's water,

3040
02:46:59,090 --> 02:47:04,090
ocean water that washed on land and 
washed up and you see it kind of comes 

3041
02:47:04,251 --> 02:47:07,640
to a point and then it washed back out.
This is,

3042
02:47:07,670 --> 02:47:12,670
this is a tsunami deposit and those few 
features that you're looking at,

3043
02:47:12,681 --> 02:47:15,740
the kind of look like this there,
she called chevron's right?

3044
02:47:16,520 --> 02:47:18,860
That's what happens when the water 
washes in,

3045
02:47:18,980 --> 02:47:22,930
makes deposits of giant ripples and then
washes back.

3046
02:47:23,100 --> 02:47:25,610
What kind of timeframe are you talking 
about when this happens?

3047
02:47:25,670 --> 02:47:30,670
How long statistics do the oh hours.
So that all happened in hours.

3048
02:47:31,400 --> 02:47:33,590
In hours.
And you could still see it today.

3049
02:47:33,740 --> 02:47:35,000
Oh yeah.
Go to the next slide.

3050
02:47:35,001 --> 02:47:37,880
Jamey.
We're getting a closer up look here.

3051
02:47:37,881 --> 02:47:40,670
Now you see how,
see how they're shaped.

3052
02:47:40,671 --> 02:47:44,630
Almost like that's the chevron,
like a sergeant stripe almost,

3053
02:47:44,650 --> 02:47:45,500
right?
Okay.

3054
02:47:45,501 --> 02:47:48,080
Go to the next slide.
Okay.

3055
02:47:48,081 --> 02:47:53,020
Here's a cross section of one of those v
shaped hills at 600 feet in height.

3056
02:47:53,280 --> 02:47:56,010
Wow,
that's incredible.

3057
02:47:56,040 --> 02:47:58,080
Now what?
So what you're seeing in the back.

3058
02:47:58,081 --> 02:47:59,160
That up.
One more jamie.

3059
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:04,290
So those images right there.
What we're seeing there,

3060
02:48:04,320 --> 02:48:08,520
it looks like the effects of a river or 
water or something.

3061
02:48:08,530 --> 02:48:09,300
It is water.
Yeah.

3062
02:48:09,360 --> 02:48:12,000
But then when you go back,
you see it from the ground.

3063
02:48:12,420 --> 02:48:13,860
It looks like hills.
Yeah.

3064
02:48:13,861 --> 02:48:17,700
Six hundred feet high.
So you're talking about a massive amount

3065
02:48:17,701 --> 02:48:18,120
of water.

3066
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:22,680
We're talking about a tsunami whose 
minimum run up height is the height,

3067
02:48:22,681 --> 02:48:25,860
the thickness of these hills,
600 feet minimum,

3068
02:48:25,861 --> 02:48:30,861
minimum minimum,
and that's of course massive amount of 

3069
02:48:30,861 --> 02:48:32,430
weight and devastation.
And this was all 5,000

3070
02:48:32,431 --> 02:48:33,160
years ago.
Yeah.

3071
02:48:33,210 --> 02:48:34,410
Go to the next slide,
jamie.

3072
02:48:35,760 --> 02:48:36,960
Uh,

3073
02:48:37,210 --> 02:48:38,050
keep.
Yeah.

3074
02:48:38,060 --> 02:48:43,060
There's Madagascar location of the 
chevrons on the southern edge of 

3075
02:48:43,060 --> 02:48:43,940
Madagascar.
Let's see.

3076
02:48:43,941 --> 02:48:45,470
Go to slides up

3077
02:48:46,910 --> 02:48:47,300
and

3078
02:48:47,990 --> 02:48:52,990
over on the other side at the same age.
If we look at the southwestern coast of 

3079
02:48:53,151 --> 02:48:54,800
Australia,
I think the next slide,

3080
02:48:54,801 --> 02:48:56,990
we'll get a closer in view.
There we go.

3081
02:48:56,991 --> 02:48:58,950
You see that?
Splurge.

3082
02:48:59,330 --> 02:49:04,330
That's,
that's the technical scientific term 

3083
02:49:04,330 --> 02:49:05,330
isn't really blueedge.
No,

3084
02:49:05,331 --> 02:49:07,950
I just made that.
You bet.

3085
02:49:07,951 --> 02:49:08,040
You

3086
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:13,040
see,
you see the stuff that's been washed 

3087
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:13,040
over.
You can see it.

3088
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:13,040
It's very clear there.
Okay.

3089
02:49:13,800 --> 02:49:18,800
That's the other side of the ocean.
So the other side of the ocean directly 

3090
02:49:18,800 --> 02:49:21,210
opposite of where this thing impacted.
Yeah.

3091
02:49:21,240 --> 02:49:24,780
Go to the next massive impact in the 
middle.

3092
02:49:25,440 --> 02:49:27,030
Yeah.
Ancient crash.

3093
02:49:27,210 --> 02:49:27,800
Epic.
Wait,

3094
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:31,470
let's go back to that slide where from 
the word says ancient crash,

3095
02:49:31,471 --> 02:49:33,720
epic wave.
Next slide.

3096
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:35,820
Keep going right there.
Right there.

3097
02:49:36,810 --> 02:49:38,210
Can we read that?
Yeah.

3098
02:49:38,230 --> 02:49:43,230
The southern end of Madagascar lie for 
enormous wedge shaped deposits called 

3099
02:49:43,230 --> 02:49:45,210
chevrons that are composed of material 
from the ocean floor.

3100
02:49:45,211 --> 02:49:50,211
Each covers twice the area of manhattan 
with sediment as deep as the chrysler 

3101
02:49:50,211 --> 02:49:54,861
building is high on close inspection.
The chevron deposits contained deep 

3102
02:49:54,861 --> 02:49:59,301
ocean microfossils that are fused with 
medley of metals typically form by 

3103
02:50:01,051 --> 02:50:03,330
cosmic impacts.
Wow.

3104
02:50:03,360 --> 02:50:04,950
Holy shit.
Yeah,

3105
02:50:05,580 --> 02:50:06,960
yeah.
Holy shit.

3106
02:50:07,590 --> 02:50:10,590
And so that,
if that happened 4,000,

3107
02:50:10,591 --> 02:50:12,430
800 years ago,
um,

3108
02:50:12,650 --> 02:50:17,650
what,
what kind of an impact would that have 

3109
02:50:17,650 --> 02:50:17,650
had on human civilization?

3110
02:50:17,650 --> 02:50:19,140
Oh,
well it pretty much would have wiped out

3111
02:50:19,141 --> 02:50:22,200
anything adjacent to the indian ocean.
Anything close to it.

3112
02:50:22,410 --> 02:50:24,420
But what about on the other side of the 
planet?

3113
02:50:24,480 --> 02:50:29,480
I mean,
there would have to be some massive 

3114
02:50:29,480 --> 02:50:29,480
effects.
Oh,

3115
02:50:29,480 --> 02:50:29,480
there would be.
Most likely.

3116
02:50:29,480 --> 02:50:32,400
What we would see on the other side of 
the planet is extreme weather events,

3117
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:35,310
hurricanes,
torrential rain falls,

3118
02:50:35,340 --> 02:50:40,340
things like that.
Winter kill a huge amount of people 

3119
02:50:40,340 --> 02:50:40,970
worldwide could kill a human,
a huge amount of people worldwide.

3120
02:50:40,980 --> 02:50:42,320
Yes.
Wow.

3121
02:50:42,490 --> 02:50:44,820
And so that is probably the most recent 
one.

3122
02:50:44,850 --> 02:50:49,850
That's probably the most recent and no 
record of it because people really 

3123
02:50:49,850 --> 02:50:54,561
didn't have any records.
I think the record of it is probably 

3124
02:50:54,561 --> 02:50:56,490
when we see these stories like noah's 
flood and the rest.

3125
02:50:56,520 --> 02:51:00,000
So that's probably about this one.
So it's not even about the holocene one.

3126
02:51:00,001 --> 02:51:03,060
It's about one 5,000
years after the house in one.

3127
02:51:03,090 --> 02:51:04,740
Yes.
See,

3128
02:51:04,741 --> 02:51:09,741
that's what we're beginning to realize 
now is that these events have happened 

3129
02:51:09,741 --> 02:51:11,880
with a much greater degree of frequency 
than anybody hit imagined.

3130
02:51:12,930 --> 02:51:14,340
well,
congratulations.

3131
02:51:14,341 --> 02:51:16,890
You freaked me the fuck out.
I just want to say,

3132
02:51:16,891 --> 02:51:19,050
you know,
you had an objective and you pull it off

3133
02:51:19,680 --> 02:51:24,300
of five stars a plus freakout.
Wow.

3134
02:51:24,510 --> 02:51:26,730
This is a.
This has been an intense three hours.

3135
02:51:26,731 --> 02:51:28,380
It just flew by three hours.
Yeah,

3136
02:51:28,381 --> 02:51:29,850
we just did three hours.
Wow.

3137
02:51:29,880 --> 02:51:31,110
It's over.
Yeah.

3138
02:51:31,170 --> 02:51:32,180
That amazing.
Yeah.

3139
02:51:32,290 --> 02:51:37,290
We got to do this again.
I bet you could talk for another 16 

3140
02:51:37,290 --> 02:51:37,290
hours.
Yeah,

3141
02:51:37,290 --> 02:51:37,890
I mean we've barely scratched the 
surface here.

3142
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:38,760
Oh,
please,

3143
02:51:38,761 --> 02:51:40,980
let's do it again.
Let's take a couple months off,

3144
02:51:41,010 --> 02:51:42,930
regroup and come back in again.
Oh,

3145
02:51:42,940 --> 02:51:45,210
I'd love to do some more.
Thank you very much for doing this.

3146
02:51:45,211 --> 02:51:46,750
I really,
really appreciate it.

3147
02:51:46,751 --> 02:51:49,350
It is incredibly enjoyable,
incredibly enlightening for me.

3148
02:51:49,351 --> 02:51:50,940
I really,
really appreciate it.

3149
02:51:50,941 --> 02:51:55,941
I knew it was going to be like this.
Just the brief conversation that we had 

3150
02:51:55,941 --> 02:51:55,941
a chance to have in atlanta,
you know,

3151
02:51:55,941 --> 02:52:00,860
many years ago.
I've been looking forward to talking to 

3152
02:52:00,860 --> 02:52:00,860
you again.
Thank you very much for doing this.

3153
02:52:00,860 --> 02:52:01,500
Oh,
it's been awesome.

3154
02:52:01,501 --> 02:52:02,710
I really,
really have enjoyed it.

3155
02:52:02,711 --> 02:52:05,800
If people want to research more your 
work,

3156
02:52:05,801 --> 02:52:06,130
read

3157
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:08,020
more of your stuff,
where can they go?

3158
02:52:08,021 --> 02:52:09,400
Where can they,
what can they find?

3159
02:52:09,430 --> 02:52:13,090
Go to sacred geometry,
international.com

3160
02:52:13,150 --> 02:52:18,150
and there are links there.
I've got another website that linked 

3161
02:52:18,150 --> 02:52:19,870
from there,
so like in sacred geometry,

3162
02:52:19,871 --> 02:52:21,880
international idea with a bunch of 
different stuff.

3163
02:52:21,910 --> 02:52:25,300
Not directly connected necessarily with 
what we're talking about here,

3164
02:52:25,720 --> 02:52:29,800
but there'll be links to another website
that I've got where I'm really exploring

3165
02:52:29,801 --> 02:52:33,640
like the catastrophic stuff or I've got 
lots of images of,

3166
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:35,290
of things.
Um,

3167
02:52:36,310 --> 02:52:41,310
yeah.
cause I've done lots and lots of field 

3168
02:52:41,310 --> 02:52:43,710
exploration.
They have thousands of images of just 

3169
02:52:43,710 --> 02:52:46,540
awesome stuff.
Does it sacred geometry have anything to

3170
02:52:46,541 --> 02:52:49,270
do with this stuff or is that a totally 
different sacred geometry?

3171
02:52:49,480 --> 02:52:53,830
Put it this way as we've inherited this 
corpus of ancient knowledge,

3172
02:52:53,860 --> 02:52:58,860
sacred geometry is one of the keys for 
deciphering these ancient traditions 

3173
02:52:58,871 --> 02:53:03,871
because all of these ancient temple 
structures which are the textbooks in 

3174
02:53:03,871 --> 02:53:06,700
stone,
if you will have several components in,

3175
02:53:06,730 --> 02:53:11,730
in common astronomical and geometrical 
being the two predominant.

3176
02:53:12,220 --> 02:53:17,220
And if you understand the geometry,
you realize the geometry is like a 

3177
02:53:17,220 --> 02:53:20,341
universal code by where whereby you can 
preserve certain types of information 

3178
02:53:21,250 --> 02:53:26,250
because geometry is universal.
It doesn't matter what your spoken 

3179
02:53:26,250 --> 02:53:27,400
language is,
the principles of geometry are what they

3180
02:53:27,401 --> 02:53:28,630
are,
you know,

3181
02:53:28,631 --> 02:53:33,631
the relationship of a,
of a radius to a circle is the same and 

3182
02:53:33,631 --> 02:53:34,870
it doesn't matter what culture you come 
from.

3183
02:53:35,020 --> 02:53:40,020
You see,
and so geometry is a critical means of 

3184
02:53:40,020 --> 02:53:43,060
decipher the,
the knoWledge that and I think that the,

3185
02:53:43,230 --> 02:53:48,230
that the predominant way of preserving 
ancient knowledge is in the temple 

3186
02:53:48,230 --> 02:53:52,381
structures and they have to be looked at
as textbooks in stone and once we begin 

3187
02:53:52,381 --> 02:53:53,830
to realize that,
then we can go.

3188
02:53:54,190 --> 02:53:59,190
It's like when you go to Egypt,
it's not just the hieroglyphs that's a 

3189
02:53:59,190 --> 02:54:02,191
part of it,
but it's also the geometry and the 

3190
02:54:02,191 --> 02:54:04,180
astronomy that's encoded there and we 
can see the same astronomy at work,

3191
02:54:04,181 --> 02:54:09,181
whether we're looking in Egypt,
whether in geometry or whether we're 

3192
02:54:09,181 --> 02:54:11,140
looking at megalithic structures in 
ancient england or whether we're looking

3193
02:54:11,141 --> 02:54:11,790
at,
um,

3194
02:54:12,100 --> 02:54:17,100
mega a monumental earthworks up in the 
Ohio valley or we're looking at this,

3195
02:54:17,770 --> 02:54:19,780
the mind you've been to teach an eatsa.

3196
02:54:20,020 --> 02:54:21,190
Right,
okay.

3197
02:54:21,460 --> 02:54:26,460
That whole complex there is laid out 
according to principles of sacred 

3198
02:54:26,460 --> 02:54:29,851
geometry and astronomy and it's exactly 
the same principles underlying that is 

3199
02:54:31,361 --> 02:54:33,820
we find in Egypt.
That will be our next conversation.

3200
02:54:33,850 --> 02:54:35,560
I'll be a great.
I can't wait.

3201
02:54:35,561 --> 02:54:36,940
I can't wait.
Thank you so much.

3202
02:54:36,941 --> 02:54:38,860
Really appreciate it.
Randall carlson,

uh,
international.

3206
02:54:50,080 --> 02:54:53,230
So yeah.
