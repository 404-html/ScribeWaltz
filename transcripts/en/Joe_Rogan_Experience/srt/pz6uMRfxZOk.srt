1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,930
And we already live.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,500
Yeah.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:04,951
Damn.

4
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:07,650
Watch me tweet and talk at the same time.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,710
You know there's a lot of
guitar players that can do that.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,420
Tweet and guitar.

7
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:12,901
Yeah,

8
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:14,730
they can sing and talk at the same time.

9
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:15,031
Me,

10
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:19,580
I can't even type and talk at the same
time and I don't have to keep any kind of

11
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,140
spelled experience wrong.

12
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,650
Do you sing and talk at the same time?

13
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:24,120
It seems like sing,

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,000
sing and play guitar at the same time.

15
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,590
But they'll also play guitar and like
could he keep playing the song and then

16
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:33,510
talk to you about some something?

17
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,091
You know what I mean?

18
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:34,860
Like,

19
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,551
like I know man,

20
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:38,850
when you get down they need to make up
left and they're still playing the exact,

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,110
you know,

22
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:40,590
some of their,

23
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,670
their brain can,

24
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,900
can do both at the same time.

25
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:43,711
It's like drummers,

26
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,544
I don't get that.

27
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,620
Like a drummer has like
one beat on one leg,

28
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:47,700
one beat on the other leg.

29
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,640
How God damn impressive.

30
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,450
His diocese,

31
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,320
kid Max is a fucking beast.

32
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,840
Really?

33
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,210
Oh my God,

34
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,050
Dude.

35
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,760
We had Max Silverstein.

36
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:04,110
He came on the show with dice and we
played a video of it and I had seen him do

37
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:06,900
it live when we went to
dicer show cause he does,

38
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,300
he does like the,

39
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,950
his band does a song
before dice comes out.

40
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,470
So I knew that the kid
could play the drums,

41
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:18,471
but there's a video of him at the comedy
lab next to the Improv and who show was

42
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:21,330
it on a,

43
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,313
I don't know,

44
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,813
whatever it was,

45
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,320
the fucking kids and sane.

46
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:25,771
I mean,

47
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:27,570
he's not just good at the drums.

48
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:28,830
He's sick.

49
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,800
I mean he's,

50
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:29,930
he's,

51
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,410
it looks like a fucking professional.

52
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:31,830
Really?

53
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,190
Oh,

54
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,300
it's amazing man.

55
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,340
The hand eye coordination is ridiculous.

56
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:35,911
I mean,

57
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:39,300
he fucking goes off on
this solo and he nails it.

58
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:40,230
He nails it perfect.

59
00:01:40,231 --> 00:01:41,064
And it's one of those,

60
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,120
one of those moments,

61
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:42,451
you're like,

62
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:44,460
that kid's a bad mother fucker.

63
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,240
That kid could be a bad
motherfucker at anything he wants.

64
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,580
He wants his fucking dad
did a great job raising him,

65
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,090
man.

66
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,450
That,

67
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,580
that kid loves his father.

68
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,331
You know,

69
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:02,130
that is a beautiful thing to
watch Dyson as kid for real.

70
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:04,230
He loves his fucking kids,

71
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:05,064
man.

72
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,770
And they love him and
they're all empowered.

73
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:09,720
Like his son is super confident,

74
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:12,420
young and strong and smart and you know,

75
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:12,630
he's,

76
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,670
he's fucking got a real shot,

77
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,570
a real shot,

78
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,410
you know,

79
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,850
without anybody's help.

80
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,900
Just from talent,

81
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,861
just from the,

82
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:20,540
you know,

83
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,050
the,

84
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,040
the ability to play drums like that.

85
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,060
You can do that.

86
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,910
I really believe you could
apply that shit to anything.

87
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,250
And if you go to a on it
and use the coupon code,

88
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:30,680
Rogan it yourself.

89
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:32,310
So Alpha brain,

90
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,030
and they learned to
function on my level son.

91
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,660
So seamless people will make
fun of me for this Alpha brain.

92
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:44,661
But you can all go fuck yourself if you
take it and you don't see any results.

93
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,060
I think there's something wrong with your
brain needed to go to a doctor and you

94
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:53,061
could find out or you need to
get that from I Tommy buns.

95
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,550
He just held up his
arms and shut his wrong.

96
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,600
She's throwing phones
around this rappels apples.

97
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:59,440
It's really a fucking
guns around this room.

98
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,000
Ah,

99
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,181
no.

100
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:00,530
So for,

101
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:00,970
for Real,

102
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,810
what is Alpha brain?

103
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,170
It's really the,

104
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:03,841
it's all bad.

105
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:05,080
It's best explained on,

106
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,140
on at.com cause it was written
by sober people first of all.

107
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,960
And second of all,

108
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,130
people who understand science other
than my level of understanding,

109
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:17,290
which is repeating shit that
other people understand,

110
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,940
but I don't ever really understand.

111
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:19,900
He believes in evolution.

112
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,253
Um,

113
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,780
well I think there is certainly a lot
of evidence for natural selection and

114
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:30,781
adaptation and that it's most
likely the way things have evolved,

115
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:32,320
but there's some holes in it.

116
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,190
There's some holes.

117
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,461
Yeah,

118
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:34,170
we'll talk about it.

119
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,740
Kind of a question for talking about this.

120
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,583
The middle of a commercial.

121
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,270
Hey Man.

122
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,280
Well I thought this way,

123
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:38,980
this ship roles here,

124
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,910
I want to thank God it's Icom for
supporting us while we got hacked recently

125
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:43,330
folks.

126
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:43,900
And uh,

127
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,500
we uh,

128
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,450
had to like severely upgrade our,

129
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,030
uh,

130
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,863
her um,

131
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,873
uh,

132
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,170
technical system,

133
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:53,160
whoever it is that the
website interfaces with.

134
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,790
Uh,

135
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,623
I learned something new

136
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,090
passwords.

137
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,620
If you use like a regular word as
a password and it may be a number,

138
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,010
you know,

139
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,731
that's okay.

140
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:04,680
But the hardest thing
that would take like,

141
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:09,710
I forget like 32 years for a computer
to hack is if you just take three random

142
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:11,010
words and put them together,

143
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,840
like Taco fart handicap
or something like that.

144
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:16,860
Yeah.

145
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,690
And that way the computer will never just
the odds that we'll get to that point,

146
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:22,524
it was like 32.

147
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,231
Well yeah,

148
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:26,110
but then they'll just have a new computer
search engine and now they were like,

149
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:26,291
yeah,

150
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,160
what bitch?

151
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,450
And they'll nail it quick or we just
got the capital and lowercase thing.

152
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,480
I don't think that matters like zero.

153
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:35,830
Most things aren't case sensitive.

154
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,460
Yeah.

155
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,293
But uh,

156
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,300
either way on it.com spelled o and n I
t and if you go there and today is the

157
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:43,481
11th,

158
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,560
September 11th.

159
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,341
And uh,

160
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:46,960
if you go there for one more day,

161
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:47,651
use the code,

162
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:50,590
got your back and you get
18% off of everything.

163
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,280
That includes kettle bells and battle
ropes because normally the coupon,

164
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,950
a coupon code of Rogan only
works for the supplements.

165
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:02,350
It doesn't work for the kettle
bells in the battle ropes.

166
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,070
The reason being is that we sell
those literally as cheapest as humanly

167
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:06,904
possible,

168
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,380
but because of this fuck up,

169
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,120
because the fact that everybody feels
terrible that this website got hacked.

170
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,040
The,

171
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,430
we don't know whether or not anybody's a
credit card information got compromised

172
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:18,791
so far.

173
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:22,930
No one has a reported any what
they call substantiated fraud,

174
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:23,764
I think they call it,

175
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,940
but uh,

176
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,631
whatever it is,

177
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,970
some scumbags figured out a
way to get into our system.

178
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,173
It's just,

179
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,740
I don't understand the way they do it.

180
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,670
I completely talking like I'm
explaining French to you though.

181
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:39,190
I don't speak French so I
could never really comment.

182
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,810
But as far as I know,

183
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:42,970
I mean it's really,

184
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,030
I think for a lot of these guys it's fun
to see how they can sneak into systems

185
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:49,900
even if the not stealing anything.

186
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,340
I think script kids that are just really
bright and they figured out how to

187
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:55,480
sneak into your system.

188
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,770
It's all against the hunt man.

189
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,230
They're like trying to see how far they
can get it and then you have to some

190
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:00,550
hacker.

191
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,300
Is she the other day?

192
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:01,810
What'd you do?

193
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,740
I'll talk poll.

194
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,141
Let me,

195
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:03,351
yeah,

196
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,310
let me just get through with this.

197
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,630
So because of that,

198
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,240
because everybody's very bummed
out about that and that you're,

199
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:08,570
uh,

200
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,080
you know,

201
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,900
the credit card information has been
compromised and if you go to [inaudible]

202
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:13,730
dot com forward slash breach,

203
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,110
it'll explain all that.

204
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,760
It's just an unfortunate aspect
of doing business on the Internet.

205
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,270
We apologize and nobody,

206
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,110
uh,

207
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,820
nobody foresaw it this way.

208
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,210
Uh,

209
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,760
we've beefed up the security considerably,

210
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,500
so hopefully it won't happen again.

211
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,221
Whoever hacked this,

212
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:28,911
please don't do that.

213
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:29,744
Thanks.

214
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,650
You don't have to do that.

215
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:31,484
That's mean,

216
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,630
I know you can do it.

217
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,051
Okay.

218
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:34,070
We know you can do it.

219
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,510
Please don't do it.

220
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,870
I don't want anybody to get caught and
go to jail for something stupid like

221
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:39,231
that.

222
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:39,801
And you know,

223
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:41,240
and if that's how you're
making your money,

224
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,910
how dare you go get a
fucking respectable job.

225
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,601
You son of a bitch,

226
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,250
you're stealing numbers from offline.

227
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,421
You can't do that.

228
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:48,570
I'm a big fan of you guys.

229
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,423
Whoever you are,

230
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,180
I want to give a shout
out Favell shout outs.

231
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:53,030
So anonymous.

232
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:53,781
Well,

233
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:57,380
sec shout out right out to
the hackers of the world.

234
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:57,951
Yeah,

235
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:58,251
man,

236
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:58,680
look that,

237
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:58,941
you know,

238
00:06:58,941 --> 00:06:59,900
there's a certain,

239
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,880
there's a certain amount of morals that
are on the Internet when it comes to how

240
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:06,170
things get done as well.

241
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,411
You know,

242
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:06,711
there's,

243
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:07,340
there's a,

244
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,510
there's a moral attitude at the Internet
and then I think more mirror society

245
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,441
than it does.

246
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:13,010
Uh,

247
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,920
the shit that you see on television,

248
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,460
the shade that you see in the news,

249
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,881
you know,

250
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,740
there's a link when anything goes down.

251
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,270
The difference between like,

252
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:20,881
Dan,

253
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:22,220
we shouldn't do this in a commercial.

254
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,710
Joe Joe rogan.net.

255
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,603
That's my website.

256
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,120
Go to [inaudible] dot
com use the other phone.

257
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,511
You know,

258
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:30,470
that's not for today though.

259
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,720
Do not sponsor us to that.

260
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,573
That

261
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,610
it's only a part time
thing with the thing.

262
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,590
We're just trying it out.

263
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,710
Seeing how it works is the phone.

264
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:44,150
It's phenomenal though that Samsung
Galaxy s three is fucking is to shit.

265
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,600
It's really sweet.

266
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:46,160
It's sexy.

267
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,993
It's amazing.

268
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:47,900
It's really great.

269
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,430
It's got a little for
you every now and then.

270
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:50,540
A little hiccup here and there,

271
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,020
but it's really special.

272
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:52,850
I needed to phone.

273
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,900
It's a special phone.

274
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,770
What's the queefs about?

275
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:55,650
It wasn't it?

276
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:57,040
And it just seems like I'm,

277
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,860
I think they're,

278
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,860
the iPhone is a really well
designed phone man tomorrow.

279
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,640
The way it is it tomorrow
the light comes out,

280
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,770
the way the,

281
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,603
the,

282
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,550
the touch screen first of all is
better than anything on the planet.

283
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,720
They're the best touchscreen.

284
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,240
The quality of it feels
better than anything.

285
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,990
Like when you'd have the case on an iPhone
and you just feel that knowing glass,

286
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,000
it's like the sexiest
piece of equipment ever.

287
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,730
But you got to walk around
with a condom on it because,

288
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,460
you know,

289
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,740
it's so breakable.

290
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,430
But,

291
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,890
but it's still super duper fucking sexy.

292
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:28,630
I mean,

293
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,750
hold on to that thing.

294
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:33,890
I mean feel that that's
a genius piece of device.

295
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:34,963
And so it's,

296
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,940
that phone is to always a little
better than everything I've tried.

297
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,350
The way it interfaces,

298
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,280
just cleaner,

299
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:41,810
smarter makes more sense,

300
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,130
easier to find shit.

301
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,090
It's just better.

302
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,230
It's like our Tiffany jewelry,

303
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:48,790
my phone really started taking
a shit the most today really.

304
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:53,791
And it's totally because it comes out
to my apple sending out electronic.

305
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,450
The Joe Rogan experience is brought
to you by on a.com going Oh,

309
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,090
That's it.

310

We're not brought to you by anyone else.

311
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:05,460

312
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,294
and pick up some,

313
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,130
some funky sexy cat shirts.

314
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,390
It has been proven that you are 20% more
likely to get your penis touch if you

315
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:12,981
weren't a desk.

316
00:09:12,981 --> 00:09:17,981
What captured 20% 43% with alcohol.

317
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:19,111
You add a desk,

318
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:20,340
squad shirt and alcohol,

319
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:21,480
and someone's going to touch your penis.

320
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:22,770
And this is a blind study.

321
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,101
Yeah,

322
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:25,500
it's like three out of five times
someone's touching your penis.

323
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:25,850
Okay.

324
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,370
All right.

325
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,210
I feel good for you.

326
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:28,470
I feel like the odds are strong.

327
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,940
Thompson Gore is here.

328
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:30,930

Tommy buns in the fucking house.

Ladies and gentlemen.

335
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,050
It's Tommy like it's
good to have you buddy.

336
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,670
We were about to,

337
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:54,120
uh,

338
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,780
just talk nonsense and go through
commercial and Tommy buns hits me with,

339
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,430
do you believe in evolution?

340
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,290
Thrown heavy handed question.

341
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,380
That's so fucking right hand
bombed the open the round.

342
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,910
Well it's just funny to me cause I was
watching this thing about and this guy

343
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,480
was like,

344
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,480
this guy I can believe in evolution
should be taught in the classrooms and it

345
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:20,000
was like a political ad like that.

346
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,850
Like that that appeals to somebody.

347
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:24,271
They're like,

348
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:24,600
yeah,

349
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,470
fuck that guy.

350
00:10:25,471 --> 00:10:28,740
He thinks evolution be fucking asshole.

351
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,371
You're like,

352
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:29,760
really?

353
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,540
There's that.

354
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,540
There's actually enough
people that believe like I,

355
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:40,260
I'm not a science expert so I
don't want anyone to think like,

356
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:40,760
wait a minute,

357
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,210
you're about to,

358
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,290
you're not a science expert.

359
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:43,551
I know.

360
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:44,384
I mean I know.

361
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,600
What price point do you become an expert
because if you were just you and you

362
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:51,670
lived in the 14 hundreds
you'd be a fucking science x.

363
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,590
You're probably right.

364
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:53,131
They'd be like,

365
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:56,130
electricity is God's way
of showing you his anger.

366
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:56,611
You're like,

367
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:57,001
well no,

368
00:10:57,001 --> 00:11:00,930
actually it's just some shit that's
formed by from the lives of the atmosphere

369
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,850
and my president.

370
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,740
You'd be a fucking scientist.

371
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,010
You could explain so much
shit to these people.

372
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,970
Well actually I would just know it
and not know how to explain it though.

373
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,823
Would just be like,

374
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,290
no,

375
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:12,550
no,

376
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,300
you drive,

377
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,610
you drive round.

378
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:14,971
And they'd be like,

379
00:11:14,971 --> 00:11:15,451
how have you known?

380
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:15,721
I'd be like,

381
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:16,554
just cousins scene.

382
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,250
You would,

383
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,070
you would work with those people for a
couple of days and you'd be so annoyed.

384
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:20,281
You're like,

385
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:20,611
listen,

386
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:21,390
you have to listen to me.

387
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,890
I'm your new king and I'm going to
show you how to build an airplane.

388
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,100
They'd be like an airplane.

389
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:27,030
What the fuck you talking about?

390
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:27,560
Get some,

391
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,820
get someone I'm going to show you you
need this has gotta be straight like that.

392
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,700
Think like a bird.

393
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:36,420
But then with the tail up in the air
air draft from above and below you go to

394
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:36,631
go.

395
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:38,190
Where did you get this idea from?

396
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,211
I Dunno man.

397
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:40,860
They just come to me to just come to me.

398
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:44,940
You draw like bows and arrows for like
Davinci was like from the future and went

399
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:45,600
to the past.

400
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,490
I think the Davinci too many ideas.

401
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,450
You know what people love to say
when there's a guy like Davinci,

402
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,130
they go and I wanted to sit,

403
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,710
just say it just of instinct.

404
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,510
It's probably had like
Asperger's or something.

405
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,760
They always want to say
something like that.

406
00:11:57,761 --> 00:11:58,391
Like that.

407
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:03,130
There's no way you could be close off
with that guy that brilliant and not be

408
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:03,730
fucked up.

409
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,170
Like I'm not willing to believe it,

410
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,310
you know?

411
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,143
I don't think that,

412
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,470
I mean keeping like,

413
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,130
I almost agree that like I don't think
you could go to Davinci and be like,

414
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,360
how do you like your eggs man?

415
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:13,781
And He'd be like,

416
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:14,120
you know,

417
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,200
actually like I think he would be
talking about all kinds of weird shit.

418
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,560
Like thinking about what you would look
like if you cleaved you in half and

419
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:20,870
pulled,

420
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,140
you could draw those two sides.

421
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:25,030
You want to donate your body
like today and you're like,

422
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:25,390
no.

423
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,110
And I dead yet.

424
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,430
Did you ever see that exhibit,

425
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:30,940
that bodyworks exhibit where
they take human bio together?

426
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:31,301
Yeah,

427
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:31,780
that's right.

428
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,391
It's crazy.

429
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:33,940
It is creepy as fuck dude.

430
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,130
And they were stopping us
from taking pictures over.

431
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,200
They told us to put our phones away.

432
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,870
I had to take camera and
pictures on the sneak tip.

433
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:41,921
Yeah.

434
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:42,221
We're like,

435
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:42,401
no,

436
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:43,470
flash a horse.

437
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,291
Remember the horse,

438
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,530
they had this like real horse.

439
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,383
It had been like,

440
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:46,980
well,

441
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,200
what was fucked up was
that if you did this,

442
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,310
if you haven't seen it,

443
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:51,880
folks,

444
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,540
the body works exhibit is a in the exhibit
where they take a bunch of death dead

445
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,890
bodies and through some new method of uh,

446
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,090
somehow or another coating them with
plastic and then fusing plastic into the

447
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:04,810
muscles.

448
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,130
It doesn't change the appearance,

449
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:08,860
but it completely stops
them from decaying.

450
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,130
So it's really creepy.

451
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,520
They give you the different acts years.

452
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,120
Yeah,

453
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,110
so they give you like a portion.

454
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,370
Yeah.

455
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:21,370
That's what's really fucked up is the
clinical aspect of the dissection of the

456
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:25,490
bodies on display was a little disturbing
because it was almost like butcher

457
00:13:25,491 --> 00:13:26,230
ask.

458
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,390
It's like if this was a guy's basement,

459
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,420
you would want him locked up forever.

460
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:31,991
Okay.

461
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:35,950
This guy would be one of the most horrific
serial killers and twisted fox ever.

462
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,370
Ever.

463
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,920
Even if it was a grave
robber and he did this,

464
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,260
you would want this
motherfucker locked up forever,

465
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,240
but you can do it and somehow
because you've involved plastic,

466
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,720
which means that it's been like
government sanctioned or something.

467
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,160
Now you can just display these dead
bodies and people can come and pay.

468
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:54,820
Like how,

469
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,140
where did you get these bodies?

470
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:56,680
Exactly.

471
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,070
And all you need.

472
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,850
It's not even like under heavy scrutiny
of some of them had like bullet wounds

473
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:01,684
or something.

474
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,520
Does that exhibit even still around?

475
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:04,540
It's got a smell by now.

476
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,740
The one that I saw,

477
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,910
I saw it in Vegas.

478
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,540
Um,

479
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,111
it was at,

480
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:08,830
I think it was luck.

481
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,300
Sore.

482
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,133
Yeah.

483
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:11,741
Yeah.

484
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:12,574
And um,

485
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,670
and too much sadness for one day at the
end they said that all the bodies in

486
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,870
that exhibit were from China.

487
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:20,770
Yeah.

488
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,970
Wow.

489
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,960
Yeah.

490
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,793
Oh my God.

491
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,520
Yeah.

492
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,260
That's scary because when you're,

493
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:30,910
when you're from a country that has been
known to do some really horrific things

494
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,380
to like prisoners and Shit,

495
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,310
pretty questionable track record
when it comes to human rights.

496
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:36,531
Well,

497
00:14:36,531 --> 00:14:39,250
there doesn't seem to be that
there's that many of them in China.

498
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:40,180
And so it's,

499
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:40,571
I mean,

500
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:40,760
uh,

501
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,110
or rather that there's too many of them
in China and there's so many people that

502
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,530
in some areas the overpopulation,

503
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:50,800
it's gotten to a point where they've
sort of devalued life and a lot of,

504
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:51,711
I mean,

505
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:55,480
when you start hearing
the stories about them,

506
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:55,760
you know,

507
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,650
forcing them to only have one child.

508
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:02,240
And so this terrible stories
of families drowning,

509
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:02,510
uh,

510
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,650
Chinese girls,

511
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,260
it's really horrific because
they want a boy fucking crazy.

512
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,080
And you know,

513
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,210
if that's propaganda though.

514
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,630
So I really honestly shouldn't be,

515
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,780
well outside of like,

516
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,250
outside of the major cities,

517
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,340
there's a lot of like extra
like out in the countryside,

518
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,950
which is hundreds of millions of people,

519
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,480
there's extreme poverty,

520
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:24,770
there's extreme literacy.

521
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,041
There's,

522
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:25,400
you know,

523
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,920
there's not any healthcare or anything.

524
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:31,820
It's just the hundreds of millions of
people outside of the major cities.

525
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:32,840
When you,

526
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,340
I mean that kind of poor,

527
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:35,930
I mean we have the,

528
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,630
we just haven't figured that out yet.

529
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,090
I don't,

530
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:39,340
I don't,

531
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,740
I don't think most Americans are
really like put that into their head.

532
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,150
Like that level,

533
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,970
the level of poverty that
exists in other countries.

534
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:47,840
We have extreme poverty,

535
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:48,170
but it's,

536
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:48,650
you know,

537
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,140
there's,

538
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,050
it's not like really what you see.

539
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:51,831
Yeah.

540
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:53,750
In third we have horrific poverty,

541
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,780
but even just existing in a welfare
state is way better than a giant chunk of

542
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:00,200
the world has access to.

543
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:00,950
You know,

544
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,010
if you think about like what,

545
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,840
what it would be like if you just had a
shit roll the dice and you wound up in

546
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:06,674
Nigeria.

547
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,100
Yeah.

548
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:12,100
You're a baby in Nigeria and it's just
flies and mosquitoes and malaria is,

549
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:15,500
and a dude's got a Hyena
on a chain and you're like,

550
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:17,090
what the fuck would you,

551
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,840
most of Africa is fucking crazy.

552
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,140
Really wild,

553
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:22,280
crazy place man.

554
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,270
I just got back from there.

555
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,051
Did you really?

556
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:25,100
Just in South Africa.

557
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:25,941
Oh that's right.

558
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,200
You were doing gigs out there.

559
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:27,560
Yeah,

560
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,240
it was awesome.

561
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,120
It was so cool.

562
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,350
People were so nice.

563
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,390
Crowds were fucking awesome.

564
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,390
And then I met other Africans that
were in South Africa and I learned like

565
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,810
that's the destination.

566
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,870
Like if you live in Botswana,

567
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,860
Mozambique,

568
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,753
Namibia,

569
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,040
you go like I want to go to South Africa.

570
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:46,490
That's the,

571
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,970
that is the crown jewel of it.

572
00:16:48,971 --> 00:16:50,990
Cause that's the most
developed like by far,

573
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,650
by far,

574
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,550
by far.

575
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,600
And like when I was in,

576
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:54,290
uh,

577
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,890
I was in the casino walking through
it with this comic who is from,

578
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,610
I think he was from a former,

579
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,091
what is he from?

580
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:03,380
He's from Nigeria or somewhere,

581
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:03,920
I don't know.

582
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,491
Mozambique,

583
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,324
I think.

584
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,163
And I was like,

585
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:06,770
uh,

586
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,670
so what's like,

587
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,540
you know your country?

588
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,201
Like he was like,

589
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:10,034
man,

590
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,401
he's like,

591
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:10,550
you,

592
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,840
you know how you picture Africa?

593
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,501
And I was like,

594
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:12,621
yeah.

595
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:12,980
He's like,

596
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,820
that's what it's like.

597
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,170
Like it's fucking open terrain
and animals and tribal shit.

598
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:18,921
And he goes,

599
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:19,850
this shit right here.

600
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,713
The casino,

601
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,800
the only thing like this in my
country is like where the king lives.

602
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,843
What if that too,

603
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,350
there's no shit like this at all.

604
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,660
That's going to be so weird to have one
city that's like on top of the ball and

605
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:33,381
everything else.

606
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:34,240
It's just as bad.

607
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,410
Barely keeping it to air.

608
00:17:36,411 --> 00:17:38,420
They're barely keeping it together.

609
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,320
Yeah,

610
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:39,651
it was.

611
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:40,040
Um,

612
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,550
but it was,

613
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:40,901
it was a,

614
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:41,990
it was an awesome experience.

615
00:17:41,991 --> 00:17:43,640
People were the crowds,

616
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:44,960
like so good,

617
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,010
very like mixed crowds and
just juiced for the shows.

618
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,853
I mean,

619
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,060
I would say out of 15 black
coat jokes go fucking killed.

620
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,360
They understand American black humor.

621
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,253
Totally.

622
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:58,890
They got it.

623
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,581
They totally get it.

624
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:00,100
And they got it.

625
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,781
They got everything.

626
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:01,650
You got everything man.

627
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,250
Wow.

628
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,083
Um,

629
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,650
did you find,

630
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,100
did you find them to be like,

631
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,640
um,

632
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,700
into like harsh material or they just,

633
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,563
it was interesting.

634
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,160
All the,

635
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,250
the local guys,

636
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,240
we saw a bunch of some South African
comics and a lot of them are,

637
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,680
have very political material and
because it's a very politically charged

638
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,460
atmosphere,

639
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:20,701
you know,

640
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:21,421
you think about that,

641
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:26,421
like they got democracy in
94 so it's Kinda like us,

642
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:27,871
you know,

643
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:28,950
you just fast forward like,

644
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:29,340
you know,

645
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,730
like the 60s and seventies really
politically charged in America.

646
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:33,000
Right.

647
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,833
And then right.

648
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,530
And then,

649
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,363
you know,

650
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,181
there's just like,

651
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:36,930
it's fresh.

652
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,280
So that's what everybody talks about.

653
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,680
They talk about politics
and things going on,

654
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,420
but it's like South African politics.

655
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,170
And then we go in and we'll
talk about the mundane,

656
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,130
like just silly,

657
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,630
like observational shit.

658
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,580
And some of the local guys were saying
that like that's so unusual for them.

659
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,230
Like to that somebody would just talk
about some like small observation they

660
00:18:58,231 --> 00:19:02,700
made because it's all about making an
impact with like your observation about

661
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:06,090
what's really going on in the
world or in the country right now.

662
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,370
You know,

663
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,680
so everybody's a preacher.

664
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:08,761
I mean there's a lot.

665
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:09,271
He said that,

666
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:09,430
look,

667
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,263
you can go to like a,

668
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:10,831
you can do it,

669
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:12,420
go to a standup show in South Africa,

670
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,540
that's all locals and they'll
all hit on political shit.

671
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,370
He said that's not uncommon at all.

672
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,293
That's interesting.

673
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,320
Is it funny?

674
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,250
Did you find it funny?

675
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,001
There's this guy,

676
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:26,001
David cow is a South African comic
and he was fucking tremendous.

677
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:26,821
Yeah.

678
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:28,020
I didn't even know what like,

679
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,891
he was like,

680
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:33,000
you know when somebody really good and
you don't necessarily get the reference

681
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,350
but you laugh anyways.

682
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,340
Like you don't even,

683
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:35,821
you're like,

684
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:36,341
you don't know,

685
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,530
like I don't even know what that was.

686
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,831
Right,

687
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:38,041
right,

688
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:38,240
right.

689
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,550
You still laugh just cause he's
just timing and it's funny.

690
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,970
It was like that fucking
devastated the place.

691
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,600
Wow.

692
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:45,990
Yeah.

693
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,280
I mean he was so,

694
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,690
but he was all like,

695
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:51,450
it was all about south,

696
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,250
like current shit in South Africa.

697
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,731
Wow.

698
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:54,331
And it was like,

699
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:58,530
it was wonder if that would translate
like if he did the u s I think he,

700
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,251
I don't think it would,

701
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:00,180
I don't think the act would,

702
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:05,190
but I think he's good enough where he
would just need to just figure it out.

703
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,640
That was something that never
happened with the Boston guys.

704
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,530
There was a bunch of guys from Boston
that Boston like no other place does like

705
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:14,550
local material.

706
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,350
Like my first 20 minutes was all local
material because you knew it would work.

707
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,890
It was like almost like it was first of
all there was a lot of really funny shit

708
00:20:22,891 --> 00:20:27,420
about Boston and people from
Boston love laughing about Boston.

709
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,140
Yeah.

710
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,140
So that like everybody that
was like really strong had
such a Boston centric act

711
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:35,460
like Steve Sweeney in Boston.

712
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,630
I'll put him up there with the greatest
standup performances of all time.

713
00:20:39,631 --> 00:20:40,464
I'm telling you,

714
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:43,170
Steve Sweeney in Boston in the 80s,

715
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,960
you to lay them down,

716
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:47,470
do just boom,

717
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:52,471
like he was Boland strikes crushing with
this Boston material and he's just such

718
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:54,430
a funny guy.

719
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,780
He just such a funny guy
and he had been through the,

720
00:20:56,781 --> 00:20:58,820
like the hard Boston club scene,

721
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,950
you know,

722
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,740
over a decade before I ever saw him.

723
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,611
You know what I mean?

724
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:04,180
He's just,

725
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,850
he was just a bad motherfucker.

726
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,250
Yeah.

727
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,120
And that guy,

728
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:07,840
you know,

729
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,850
when he would go to California,

730
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,350
he would lose like a big chunk of his
act because he couldn't talk about that

731
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:15,000
shit anymore.

732
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,480
It was so frustrating to me.

733
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:16,990
It was like,

734
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,291
man,

735
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,970
you could do that about anything.

736
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,610
If you could hit that level of comedy,

737
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,200
he could do that with anything.

738
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,710
Yeah.

739
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,530
That's the thing

740
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,301
that we all,

741
00:21:25,301 --> 00:21:26,440
everybody thought this by the way.

742
00:21:26,441 --> 00:21:26,741
We'd all,

743
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:27,574
cause I was there,

744
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,720
Christina was on the show
to a finesse Mitchell,

745
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,643
Ian Bagg,

746
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,220
uh,

747
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,030
Mitch Fatel,

748
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,400
Brian Haner and we all
watched David and we're like,

749
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,320
he just goes to states why?

750
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:39,310
And fucking like,

751
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:39,791
you know,

752
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:42,310
he needed to work like
kind of week after week.

753
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:42,940
Right.

754
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,730
And just if he did that
for just a few months,

755
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,130
he would put together
a stellar fucking act.

756
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:48,530
I'm sure.

757
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:48,711
Well,

758
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:49,431
I think now,

759
00:21:49,431 --> 00:21:50,810
especially because of the Internet,

760
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,500
the guys that are coming up over the
next 10 years has a lot of good guys.

761
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:54,770
Yeah.

762
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,430
And I think that a lot of these
good young up and coming stands up,

763
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,290
the standups have had a chance to see
so many good acts online so that even if

764
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:03,651
in their,

765
00:22:03,651 --> 00:22:06,380
in their area and their
area is not so good.

766
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:06,951
You know,

767
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:07,750
like there's all,

768
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,080
I'm Roman mentioning names,

769
00:22:09,081 --> 00:22:10,670
but there's some places
you'll go and like,

770
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,140
oh he's the funniest local guy.

771
00:22:12,141 --> 00:22:15,020
You should have him open for you and
you have the guy open for you and he's

772
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:16,430
fucking deaf.

773
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,020
Just nonsense and just bad
hacky tricks and you're like,

774
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,700
oh cow.

775
00:22:22,701 --> 00:22:25,250
Riced but if you're in that community,

776
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:26,750
all you really need a stage time.

777
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,300
If you've got like access to,

778
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:29,791
you know,

779
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:30,690
you can watch the,

780
00:22:30,691 --> 00:22:32,000
the Kinison archives,

781
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:33,410
he could see bill Hicks stuff.

782
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,490
She could see Stan hope.

783
00:22:34,491 --> 00:22:35,600
You can see David Tell,

784
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:36,561
he could see Norton,

785
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:38,240
you could see all these
different comics online.

786
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,700
You could sort of get
at what do you enjoy,

787
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,520
what do you enjoy?

788
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,560
I know you don't enjoy it,

789
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,290
what that guy's doing.

790
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,030
So instead of thinking about like the
hacky stuff that's in your neighborhood,

791
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,680
you have access to all this stuff.

792
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,810
Whereas like in this,

793
00:22:50,811 --> 00:22:52,250
the 80s when I started out,

794
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,490
there was no access to that other
than like cds and cassettes.

795
00:22:55,491 --> 00:22:57,590
It wasn't as immediate and it was more,

796
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,640
it was way more difficult to
sort of create a scene or to,

797
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:01,961
you know,

798
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:02,360
to,

799
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,880
to get good without like
a good scene around you.

800
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,180
Yeah.

801
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,660
Yeah.

802
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,140
You know,

803
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,501
I think,

804
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:11,501
cause I always feel like I'm only as good
as the guys that I see around me on a

805
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,790
regular basis and the guys that
I performed with other basis.

806
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,161
Yeah.

807
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,710
So if you were stuck somewhere where
you don't see a lot of good shit,

808
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,210
it definitely would affect your game.

809
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:20,600
Yeah.

810
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,430
Because like when I see
someone really good,

811
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:24,920
like when someone's stand
hopes in town or when a,

812
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,470
I see ds go up and kill or you know,

813
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:28,304
a towel or some,

814
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:28,611
you know,

815
00:23:28,611 --> 00:23:31,040
someone I really respect
and I see their act,

816
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,200
I get so charged up,

817
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:33,580
uh,

818
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,750
it gives me energy to make things.

819
00:23:35,751 --> 00:23:36,190
Yeah,

820
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:36,980
it definitely is.

821
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,251
Yeah.

822
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:37,520
That,

823
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,510
that little juice,

824
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,110
that little,

825
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:43,640
the little squirt of just
some push to get you forward.

826
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,720
You know,

827
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,400
that's so important for nothing.

828
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:49,370
Like seeing great staying at when you
were standing up and you see somebody

829
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,250
great at the show you're
at and you're like,

830
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:52,950
fuck,

831
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,610
I'm not a fan of

832
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,540
watching stand up.

833
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,560
Like I like when I'm at the comedy clubs,

834
00:23:56,561 --> 00:23:57,920
I tried not to watch anybody.

835
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,060
I don't watch a lot of standup,

836
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,020
but I do like if the,

837
00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:04,830
if I know there's somebody
either I want to see,

838
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,491
you know,

839
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:07,340
or somebody I know and I'm like,

840
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,590
oh,

841
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,510
like a friend of mine
or somebody who's like,

842
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:09,661
you know,

843
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:10,830
this person's really good.

844
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,290
I don't sit through a whole
shows but I'll watch that person.

845
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,550
And sometimes it is like,

846
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,091
man,

847
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:16,310
that's fucking so exciting.

848
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,460
You get pumped up about it.

849
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:17,850
You're like,

850
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,720
that's awesome.

851
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,831
You get like,

852
00:24:19,831 --> 00:24:20,310
um,

853
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,480
like it makes you want to work.

854
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,900
I could watch Joey Diaz do a
thousand sets in a row probably.

855
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,640
Well yeah there's definitely
certain people but like if I'm like,

856
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:27,881
you know,

857
00:24:27,881 --> 00:24:29,320
at the Improv or whatever,

858
00:24:29,321 --> 00:24:31,930
the ice house and there's like
all these comics going up,

859
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,590
I would not,

860
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,440
I don't like sitting there watching
them cause it seems like to me it just,

861
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:35,980
it,

862
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:39,460
I'm too scared of going there and then
having that like something in the back of

863
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:42,400
my head from somebody else or
it seems like that's really,

864
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,440
I get it.

865
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,860
I get anxiety when I,

866
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,780
when I sit around I'm just watching like,

867
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:48,510
uh,

868
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,910
just comic after comic home,

869
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:51,230
not get anxiety.

870
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,123
I get like,

871
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:52,281
man,

872
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:53,270
I can't sit here right now.

873
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,050
Like,

874
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:54,883
I just get like,

875
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,340
I'm like,

876
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:55,641
I got,

877
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:56,360
I got to get up,

878
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,961
I got to,

879
00:24:56,961 --> 00:25:01,700
I can't sit through this if I think it's
like if I sit and that's like a minute

880
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:02,300
in and I'm like,

881
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:02,600
ah,

882
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,650
this is not going to be,

883
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,520
this is not good.

884
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,350
I have to get up and leave.

885
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,600
You can't watch do it.

886
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,870
So you can watch like Louis
C K for fucking hours,

887
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:14,090
but you can't watch a bunch of like,

888
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,680
can't I want to say any names?

889
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:18,620
But there's a certain
group of people that,

890
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:18,921
you know,

891
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:19,191
you've,

892
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:21,800
you've seen them do standup and
you never going to understand it,

893
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,160
but yet there's still bumping around
and you might like be in the back of the

894
00:25:25,161 --> 00:25:26,970
room one day and they're on stage and you,

895
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,690
you almost have a heart
attack bucking up and out.

896
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,553
You got to get out of the room.

897
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,850
They'll in fact you,

898
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:32,601
I think,

899
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:32,900
yeah,

900
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,320
they will.

901
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,441
Well,

902
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:34,670
do you know this real thought behind?

903
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:36,050
That sounds crazy,

904
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:36,770
but it's,

905
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,603
um,

906
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,240
there's a schizophrenia,

907
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:45,070
something happens to schizophrenia and I
believe it's called Alef Renea and it's

908
00:25:45,071 --> 00:25:45,390
a,

909
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:45,830
um,

910
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,830
a very rare situation where people will
go to visit crazy people and become

911
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:55,070
crazy while they visited them.

912
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:55,730
Really?

913
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,420
Yeah.

914
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,470
And um,

915
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,430
they don't know.

916
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,240
They don't know exactly what it is
and they think it might be for mono,

917
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:03,823
it might be,

918
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:04,843
um,

919
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,300
might be something in the way
you interact with this person.

920
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:12,980
But it has happened before where people
have gone in to visit people who are

921
00:26:12,981 --> 00:26:14,930
fucking crazy and they,

922
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,100
all of a sudden people were like,

923
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:18,890
we're going to have to keep
an eye on you and then boom.

924
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,490
So it's just like almost by like
the association with that person.

925
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,220
But it could be that they were
just always crazy as fuck.

926
00:26:25,221 --> 00:26:26,054
Nobody without,

927
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,350
or you're with them.

928
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:28,310
It's almost like when you,

929
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:31,150
what's it called when you like
Stockholm Syndrome where you start to,

930
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,280
you start,

931
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,950
I think that's what guys
with your kid matters.

932
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,340
Yeah.

933
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,600
But I mean like it's like you,

934
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,280
there's a certain exposure to that person
that starts to affect your like on a

935
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:41,000
deeper level.

936
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,670
I don't know enough about how
affect each other to really,

937
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,133
when I was in college,

938
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,590
I was in psych one o one our teacher
one day we were talking about,

939
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:49,891
you know,

940
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:53,280
you're going through all the basics and
then he gets to schizophrenia and he was

941
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:53,700
like,

942
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:53,941
okay,

943
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:55,410
he writes it on the board and he's like,

944
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:59,310
schizophrenia is the worst thing
that could ever happen to you.

945
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,330
And then this kid in his class and our
class raised his hand and he's like,

946
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:03,650
Yup.

947
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,200
And he's like,

948
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,130
I have schizophrenia.

949
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,170
I don't think it's the worst
thing that could ever happen.

950
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,430
And we were all like,

951
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:08,761
oh,

952
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:10,350
you're just pissed off
the schizophrenia guy.

953
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,910
And then he's like,

954
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:12,744
well,

955
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,930
what I meant was there are different
stages of schizophrenia and that the worst

956
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:20,850
one is the worst thing
that could happen to you.

957
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,050
Which one do you have?

958
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,651
Like do you have?

959
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:23,190
And he's like,

960
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,371
ah,

961
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:25,320
I have like a less like,

962
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:25,980
you know,

963
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,770
severe.

964
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,210
And he was like,

965
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:27,720
Oh yeah,

966
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,553
that's not what I meant.

967
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,720
But Nice.

968
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,580
It'd be really bad if I to back pedal.

969
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,520
I'm trying to find the name of this,

970
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:35,180
uh,

971
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,380
this thing that,

972
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,281
that we're,

973
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:37,521
we're,

974
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:38,540
it's happened before,

975
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,570
so the rare case of people
who've visited schizophrenia,

976
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,041
but I can't,

977
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:43,910
I can't seem to find,

978
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:44,570
so I might,

979
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,780
I might be talking a little bit of Shit
because I'm just repeating some things

980
00:27:47,781 --> 00:27:49,700
that I think it was,

981
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,040
I think it was Terence Mckenna,

982
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,180
it turns from Canada lecturer.

983
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:53,871
But,

984
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:54,704
um,

985
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,390
the idea was that I'm,

986
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,690
one of the things that they think about
some people when they start to lose

987
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:01,250
their mind is that,

988
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,020
um,

989
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,320
it,

990
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,650
it becomes a,

991
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,690
a pheromonal problem when they're giving
off this weird smell to people like

992
00:28:08,691 --> 00:28:08,970
this,

993
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:09,211
uh,

994
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:10,044
this,

995
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:10,851
this,

996
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:11,600
um,

997
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,081
what does,

998
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:12,201
uh,

999
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:12,561
you know,

1000
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:14,720
how would you describe a fair
amount of hormonal smell,

1001
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:15,554
I guess?

1002
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,820
And people treat them.

1003
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:17,421
We're there.

1004
00:28:17,421 --> 00:28:17,861
It's a fence.

1005
00:28:17,861 --> 00:28:18,111
Offensive.

1006
00:28:18,111 --> 00:28:20,750
People treat them odd
and they start thinking,

1007
00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:21,740
why am I on,

1008
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:22,580
am I crazy?

1009
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,211
And that,

1010
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:27,370
that tipping point is like really
not that hard to do on some people.

1011
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:27,890
Really.

1012
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:28,041
Yeah.

1013
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,170
Because if you think about
how you interact with people,

1014
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:35,090
I'm sure you've had times in your life
where you've been a is socially awkward

1015
00:28:35,091 --> 00:28:36,470
or you felt like real weird.

1016
00:28:36,471 --> 00:28:38,810
It felt like real vulnerable
little special when you were young.

1017
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:39,860
Brian,

1018
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:40,251
barely.

1019
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:44,360
You barely feel get one correct
sentence yesterday with Kat von d.

1020
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,680
Come on that I looked over.

1021
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:46,930
He came in his pants three times.

1022
00:28:46,931 --> 00:28:47,764
It's like,

1023
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,700
how are you doing today so far?

1024
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,750
I keep on thinking about it.

1025
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:52,610
Beautiful.

1026
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,300
I met with me,

1027
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,060
I saw a picture of you
hugging her was just like,

1028
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,380
you're just in bliss.

1029
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,520
He look like,

1030
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,081
he was like,

1031
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:01,340
I'm actually touching her.

1032
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,050
I liked girls that think like that.

1033
00:29:03,051 --> 00:29:05,090
Like the energy thing she said about,

1034
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:05,924
you know,

1035
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,010
I love girls that think like that.

1036
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:11,300
That's a very nice person and
she's incredibly artistic.

1037
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,570
She's a bad ass bitch so many fast.

1038
00:29:13,571 --> 00:29:14,630
She was really nice too,

1039
00:29:14,631 --> 00:29:14,991
man.

1040
00:29:14,991 --> 00:29:15,741
She's really nice,

1041
00:29:15,741 --> 00:29:16,760
like legit Nice,

1042
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:17,720
like not a bullshit.

1043
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,050
Nice.

1044
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,010
Just a nice person.

1045
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:19,850
Yeah.

1046
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,940
It's nice when you see someone
that's trying to do that,

1047
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:23,990
that's trying to do the right thing.

1048
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,400
Yeah.

1049
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,370
It was rather bro.

1050
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,763
Where did you get that from?

1051
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,880
From Kevin d from watching how she talks.

1052
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,773
I think so.

1053
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,150
Well,

1054
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,190
we're trying to hit you.

1055
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:33,040
Don't you don't think Kat von D is Hot?

1056
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:33,801
Are you saying something?

1057
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:34,910
Like I said,

1058
00:29:34,911 --> 00:29:37,380
I watched her show look.

1059
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,390
Yo Man,

1060
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,860
sounds like to me.

1061
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,371
Do it again,

1062
00:29:42,371 --> 00:29:43,300
but look me in the eyes.

1063
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,510
Red Ban is that are um,

1064
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,920
impression for everybody.

1065
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,100
Like what?

1066
00:29:49,101 --> 00:29:50,290
Spiderman sound like

1067
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,230
sticky in my head.

1068
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:53,891
That's it.

1069
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:54,401
It's sucky.

1070
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:55,081
Impression do.

1071
00:29:55,081 --> 00:29:55,780
That's terrible.

1072
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,190
That was fucking spot on.

1073
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:57,800
Really?

1074
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,633
Yeah.

1075
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,583
Deeper crashing.

1076
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,011
No,

1077
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,210
I'm a big fan of Kat von D.

1078
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,770
I watched every episode of that show.

1079
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,610
Really?

1080
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:16,210
Absolutely.

1081
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,920
I see Eddie Bravo episode.

1082
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,000
Probably missed that one,

1083
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,170
but the other ones I caught.

1084
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,251
Why it's me,

1085
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:22,084
man.

1086
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,940
What's it must be the ringtone.

1087
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,750
Fucking a t and t commercial.

1088
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:28,600
You gave me shit about mine
too because I have on that.

1089
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,561
I have the same thing.

1090
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,930
Why I don't change turn.

1091
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,370
I just want to know if someone's calling.

1092
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,091
Okay.

1093
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:34,871
That's all I want to know,

1094
00:30:34,871 --> 00:30:35,440
Brian.

1095
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,550
I don't really give a fuck what it,

1096
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:37,150
Sandy,

1097
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:37,983
I love you.

1098
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,310
Hello Brian.

1099
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:40,840
Hey stop him.

1100
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:41,770
He's taking your girl.

1101
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,121
That's not cool.

1102
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:44,680
You said Kat von d I love you.

1103
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,630
That's so not cool.

1104
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,193
You,

1105
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,970
you don't understand what it was
like for Little Bri yesterday.

1106
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,820
Really horrible.

1107
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,750
You want to hear my new ringtone is a cat?

1108
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:56,663
Yes.

1109
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,470
Okay.

1110
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,303
Stop that.

1111
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,860
He's terrible man.

1112
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:07,861
You really need to find out what happened
to you that froze you in 12 did you

1113
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:09,540
spend some time with schizophrenia?

1114
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,390
Like yesterday?

1115
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,410
There was some strange moment when
you were 12 and you just stuck their

1116
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,740
emotional life in that ring tone.

1117
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,220
How do you even know if it's your phone?

1118
00:31:18,221 --> 00:31:18,791
If it's ringing?

1119
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:19,660
I don't give a fuck.

1120
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,320
Just check.

1121
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,980
How about that?

1122
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,940
How about I don't give a fuck,

1123
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:22,540
right?

1124
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,010
You should sell ringtones man,

1125
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,360
cause I was going through the ringtones
store and that the top 10 ones are so

1126
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:28,990
dumb.

1127
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,511
Like snakes.

1128
00:31:29,511 --> 00:31:31,870
Unicorn was the best one
and I was just really stone.

1129
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,950
But there's like one that's just like a
black eye going yo man into your phone.

1130
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:38,801
That's what I want.

1131
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:41,790
I want a white guy doing
a bad black guy to,

1132
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,390
if you were in like a really black
area and you hear the phone go right,

1133
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,450
no phone,

1134
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,283
motherfucker

1135
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,520
pick up y'all phone bed.

1136
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:54,130
You don't think my impression
of a blackboard turn right.

1137
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,130
Just think it was over.

1138
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:56,921
It was okay.

1139
00:31:56,921 --> 00:31:58,180
It was a little racist

1140
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,823
kids

1141
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:04,570
lately.

1142
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,560
I only said that.

1143
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,690
I only said that because it
was the funniest thing to say.

1144
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,220
Okay.

1145
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:08,500
Um,

1146
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,570
I don't think you're racist by
any stretch of the imagination,

1147
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:11,350
but I did.

1148
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,520
I put on myself,

1149
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:15,460
I put what some people thought
was a racist tweet the other day.

1150
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,331
I wrote a,

1151
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:17,071
I saw a black,

1152
00:32:17,071 --> 00:32:19,900
I would admit Romney
bumper sticker on his car.

1153
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,090
I go to the mines were right.

1154
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,410
This fucking thing is over.

1155
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:23,890
Yeah.

1156
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:24,161
Like that.

1157
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:24,911
That's ridiculous.

1158
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:26,470
Is Black and white racist piece of shit.

1159
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,570
And all of a sudden people were
saying on a racist piece of shit.

1160
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,620
How is that racist?

1161
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,760
Uh,

1162
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,630
I don't know.

1163
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,080
I don't know enough about Mitt Romney to
know if there was a joke in there about

1164
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:37,060
him in black people or what.

1165
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,070
My question is what black guys are
relating to Mitt Romney or here?

1166
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,670
I mean that's going to
get you some more tweets.

1167
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,870
I need to look.

1168
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,280
I wish there was another alternative
because I'm not really happy with either

1169
00:32:49,281 --> 00:32:49,971
one of these guys.

1170
00:32:49,971 --> 00:32:50,391
This is,

1171
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:51,500
it seems silly to me.

1172
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,840
I mean,

1173
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,340
uh,

1174
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,540
I feel like socially Obama's way better,

1175
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,640
the way he communicates his battery,

1176
00:32:58,641 --> 00:32:59,840
he's way smarter.

1177
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:01,250
He's way more moderate,

1178
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,640
more way more reasonable.

1179
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,150
They're hanging out with way
more impressive fuck Yad.

1180
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:10,151
Where the Obama [inaudible]
out is that seems like fuck,

1181
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:13,370
look at all the shit that got
passed while Obama was in office.

1182
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,560
I don't know how much of
that had to do with them.

1183
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,580
It's so hard to believe that a young guy
just a few years older than me would be

1184
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:26,050
so willing to give in to this ridiculous
idea that given the government more

1185
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:28,970
power over the people is
necessary to keep us safe.

1186
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,280
Cause I think that's
just total horse shit.

1187
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:36,460
I just think they want to lock it down
and they're slowly eroding our rights and

1188
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:39,290
they're doing it in a
very unconstitutional way.

1189
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,060
And that's not the way to do your job.

1190
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:43,280
Your job is to do it within
a constitutional way.

1191
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,230
And if you,

1192
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,431
you,

1193
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:48,020
if you can't keep us safe
in a constitutional way,

1194
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:49,790
it means you suck at your fucking job.

1195
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:50,900
You need to get better at that.

1196
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:55,310
But we don't need to do is look at
everybody's fucking email and listen to

1197
00:33:55,311 --> 00:33:59,630
everybody's voicemail messages and
track everybody's movement through GPS.

1198
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:01,010
And you don't need to do all that.

1199
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,330
This is crazy because who decides
who has access to that information?

1200
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:06,230
Who Decides?

1201
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:06,841
You know,

1202
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:07,050
he,

1203
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,820
the people could harass you because you
have different political beliefs than

1204
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:11,571
them or you,

1205
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:11,721
the,

1206
00:34:11,721 --> 00:34:11,961
your,

1207
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:12,231
you know,

1208
00:34:12,231 --> 00:34:14,200
interrupting their campaign that,

1209
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,601
you know,

1210
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:15,140
this,

1211
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,750
there's a lot of different things that
someone could do if they have influence,

1212
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:19,820
if they have enough power over you by,

1213
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,020
uh,

1214
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,850
by being able to,

1215
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,220
to,

1216
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,770
to track your whereabouts
and listening to their all,

1217
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:24,770
all your phone calls.

1218
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,240
That shit is ridiculous.

1219
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:28,280
And the fact that that's
happening in America,

1220
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:28,730
man,

1221
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,910
that's what we always used to make
fun of the Soviet Union about that,

1222
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:32,091
you know,

1223
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:32,450
everything.

1224
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:33,890
Everybody was being a spy.

1225
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:34,880
And spied on.

1226
00:34:34,881 --> 00:34:37,550
And we never thought that
shit was going on over here.

1227
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,480
And then meanwhile the government just
opens up the floodgates and it's all of

1228
00:34:41,481 --> 00:34:44,300
us and now it's so gross.

1229
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,400
And that didn't you retweet that somebody,

1230
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:47,570
I didn't even know about this.

1231
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:48,920
And it amazes me that the,

1232
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,370
that this happens and
nobody knows that they,

1233
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:57,740
they audited the Fed and that they
find out that like the bailout,

1234
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,640
um,

1235
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,473
amounts,

1236
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,400
we're not even close.

1237
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,790
It was trillions of dollars
in secret Bayley's bail outs.

1238
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,890
And then certain companies
were getting trillions,

1239
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:07,581
not brilliant.

1240
00:35:07,581 --> 00:35:11,120
Not even like what we were told
they were getting like with say,

1241
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:11,870
50 billion,

1242
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,201
you're like,

1243
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:12,801
Jesus,

1244
00:35:12,801 --> 00:35:14,010
you've got 50 billion now.

1245
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,160
They got like one point $3 trillion.

1246
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:16,451
Yeah,

1247
00:35:16,451 --> 00:35:17,300
it's insane.

1248
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,350
And that was like,

1249
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:18,651
uh,

1250
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:19,010
the,

1251
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,240
like it was in the news,

1252
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:21,770
but like I feel like nobody really,

1253
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:22,161
they were like,

1254
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:22,890
oh yeah,

1255
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:23,600
so what happened?

1256
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,261
I don't get it,

1257
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:24,610
man.

1258
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:24,960
I don't,

1259
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,320
I don't understand how any of it flies.

1260
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:27,801
It's the,

1261
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:28,100
I mean,

1262
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,810
the whole idea that you get that,

1263
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,681
first of all,

1264
00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:33,260
the whole idea that the only way to fix
all this shit has to take more money

1265
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:35,270
from office fucking preserve.

1266
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,160
That is so bonkers.

1267
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,060
That's the stupidest idea ever.

1268
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:41,100
It's like you're telling
me that you just have to,

1269
00:35:41,101 --> 00:35:41,970
no matter what,

1270
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,520
keep these defense budgets
the way they are now.

1271
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:46,380
That's what they're saying
essentially is saying,

1272
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:46,561
look,

1273
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:46,740
look,

1274
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,180
we're not going to shrink that.

1275
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:50,270
So let's just concentrate on who it along.

1276
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,900
Why can some things off and some other,

1277
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:53,420
it's this giant chunk.

1278
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,240
Our money's being thrown at
this ridiculous situation,

1279
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:58,980
this horrific situation rather.

1280
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,540
And now I can't fix that.

1281
00:36:00,541 --> 00:36:01,700
That is just what it is.

1282
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:01,891
You know?

1283
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:03,390
We'll cut that a little bit.

1284
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,640
We're going to cut that a little bit.

1285
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,420
We got no money for
pizza in school though.

1286
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:07,350
You know,

1287
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:07,650
it's,

1288
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:07,981
it's,

1289
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:08,220
uh,

1290
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:08,881
the idea that,

1291
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:09,080
you know,

1292
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,950
when you're gonna need a
little bit more from everybody,

1293
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:11,191
like,

1294
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:11,371
no,

1295
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:11,910
you don't.

1296
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:15,960
You need to stop spending money on shit
that we don't want you to spend money

1297
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:16,231
on.

1298
00:36:16,231 --> 00:36:16,891
What the fuck?

1299
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:17,850
Where's the money going?

1300
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:18,571
And nobody.

1301
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:20,010
The thing is like not only defense,

1302
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:24,030
but nobody is ever really
willing to make confessions.

1303
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:28,200
Nobody wants to give up whatever their
cause is or whatever their committee,

1304
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:29,034
they sit on,

1305
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,510
just go somewhere else.

1306
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,600
So you end up finding a group of people
that are all agreeing to not make any,

1307
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,830
any deals like no,

1308
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,970
just take from somebody else,

1309
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:39,804
just not us.

1310
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,550
And it goes around the circle
and then you'd go like,

1311
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:41,791
all right,

1312
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:42,300
that was fun.

1313
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,910
Fucking nobody made
any concessions at all.

1314
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,551
First of all,

1315
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:50,250
the only way we're gonna fix this whole
world problem as we're going to have to

1316
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:51,510
be able to read each other's minds.

1317
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,430
People are just too full of shit.

1318
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:58,580
Language is just one step on an ever
ending or never ending rather process of,

1319
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:02,850
of getting closer and closer
to each other languages,

1320
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,330
uh,

1321
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,080
the ability to do it and expression and
you say what you s you comes out of your

1322
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:07,321
mouth.

1323
00:37:07,321 --> 00:37:08,220
I know what you're saying.

1324
00:37:08,221 --> 00:37:08,850
I know who you are.

1325
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,391
You talk,

1326
00:37:09,391 --> 00:37:10,224
I know who you are.

1327
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,670
We're going to be able to get past that.

1328
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,200
That's what the next step is.

1329
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:16,380
The next step is we're going to be able
to read each other's minds and until

1330
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:19,470
then we're going to have a really hard
time with this fucking thing because

1331
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:23,880
people were full of shit and people
misinterpret people's words and people are

1332
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:28,410
touchy and people don't know why they're
really mad and you know there's a lot

1333
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:32,190
of the problems with what normal
human communication and part of it is,

1334
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,610
I can only gauge your
intent like guesswork.

1335
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,890
I can only gauge your intent by how you,

1336
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,880
how you respond,

1337
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:39,714
guesswork and,

1338
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,170
and,

1339
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,190
and then you put it into the computer
that is your brain and try to figure out

1340
00:37:44,191 --> 00:37:47,250
if this person is good for my life
as personally bad for my life,

1341
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,031
is this person,

1342
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:48,661
my friend,

1343
00:37:48,661 --> 00:37:49,980
and they're looking out for me.

1344
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,130
Eventually we're going to
just read each other's minds.

1345
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,410
That's all going to be bullshit.

1346
00:37:54,411 --> 00:37:57,660
And you're going to know who's
a consequent consequently
know the cons to going

1347
00:37:57,661 --> 00:37:58,440
to have to straighten up.

1348
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,450
It's going to be like a beautiful moment.

1349
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,140
Yeah.

1350
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,250
But you're also gonna know,

1351
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,000
you know,

1352
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,380
all the creepy shit about
people we're getting,

1353
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:10,350
we're going to definitely get past the
idea that the only way I can communicate

1354
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:11,970
is through some noise,

1355
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,790
some mouth noise and some text
messages looking at somebody you think,

1356
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,281
well,

1357
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:17,010
look at the interface of text messaging.

1358
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,311
I mean,

1359
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:19,090
look at how that's already got your,

1360
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,850
you've already got this
new way to communicate with
people that are nowhere near

1361
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:24,120
you.

1362
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,480
Yeah.

1363
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:24,720
You know,

1364
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,041
so you're,

1365
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:27,300
you're getting a little
bit of their information,

1366
00:38:27,301 --> 00:38:28,500
a little bit of their personality,

1367
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:29,580
a little bit of their mind,

1368
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,130
this little text that's
coming in on your phone.

1369
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:32,760
Yeah.

1370
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,220
Well eventually that's gonna it's
gonna Morph into the next thing.

1371
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,510
Whatever the fuck it is.

1372
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,260
It's going to be people that let you
ride along where you could tap into their

1373
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:43,540
consciousness and you could
walk around with them and shit.

1374
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,330
Yeah.

1375
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:44,621
I don't,

1376
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:46,990
I don't see that being outside
of the realm of possibility.

1377
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:52,320
I think that's totally possible that you
could eventually get to a point where a

1378
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:57,160
person interfaces with some sort
of an internet connection in,

1379
00:38:57,650 --> 00:38:58,020
um,

1380
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,781
it may be some,

1381
00:38:58,781 --> 00:38:59,530
some sort of,

1382
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:02,440
something that you would wear on your
head that stimulates various parts of the

1383
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:06,820
brain with electrical impulses or
something that can trigger certain

1384
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:07,450
experiences.

1385
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,040
If they figured out how
to really wire that,

1386
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,830
maybe they'll actually have to fucking
drill some holes in your head and Shit

1387
00:39:11,831 --> 00:39:15,190
and put little little conductors
that you have to screw shit into.

1388
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:18,010
But people would totally do it if
you could actually work that out.

1389
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,900
Probably ride along with each other.

1390
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,740
Yeah.

1391
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:20,981
Look,

1392
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:21,611
you could go,

1393
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:22,330
uh,

1394
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,940
you were a real fence
if you're a real freak,

1395
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,110
you know,

1396
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,760
like those dudes like
watching their wives,

1397
00:39:27,761 --> 00:39:29,050
fuck fuck other guys,

1398
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:33,140
they get like be their wife while she
gets fucked by this giant black guy.

1399
00:39:33,141 --> 00:39:33,580
Yeah,

1400
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,413
he's gotta be bad.

1401
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,990
Cause that's the scariest big guys one.

1402
00:39:37,991 --> 00:39:39,590
But big black eyes.

1403
00:39:39,591 --> 00:39:42,670
The scariest or that's
maybe like what is thing?

1404
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,710
It was not like cuckold,

1405
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:46,990
is that what they call them guys and
like watching other guys to fuck their

1406
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:47,890
wives in front of them.

1407
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:48,903
That's,

1408
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,863
that's interesting.

1409
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,793
That's to me,

1410
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,750
that's the real quick and that's
the exciting point for them.

1411
00:39:54,751 --> 00:39:55,420
They're like,

1412
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,160
this guy's about to drill my wife,

1413
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,300
this is fucking awesome.

1414
00:39:58,301 --> 00:39:59,470
That's so crazy.

1415
00:39:59,471 --> 00:39:59,990
Yeah.

1416
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:00,320
Yep.

1417
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,970
And they want,

1418
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,770
they want her to get fucking hammered.

1419
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,590
But how can that end in
anything other than murder,

1420
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:06,424
suicide,

1421
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,483
Kenneth?

1422
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,051
I don't know.

1423
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:09,880
But I was just thinking
you could never switch it.

1424
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:11,920
You can never fuck a girl
in front of your wife.

1425
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:13,930
And she's just sitting
there brushing her hair.

1426
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:14,450
Really.

1427
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:14,800
You know,

1428
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,401
slow.

1429
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:17,350
And I don't think so unless she was crazy.

1430
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:18,431
But it's,

1431
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:21,610
but it's not normal that a guy
would sit there and get off on that.

1432
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:22,210
No,

1433
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:23,043
it's not normal at all.

1434
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,280
Some guys are just real freaks.

1435
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:26,680
Yeah.

1436
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,520
But there's everything,

1437
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,200
you know,

1438
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,571
I mean,

1439
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:29,350
shit,

1440
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,220
that's well put.

1441
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:31,000
There's everything.

1442
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,800
That really is what the answer is.

1443
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,370
And we didn't really know that
as much when we were kids.

1444
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,820
That's why you were subject
to get a costed by like,

1445
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:40,240
uh,

1446
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,410
some predator.

1447
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:41,680
Yeah,

1448
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,600
because you never knew any predators.

1449
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,260
So we didn't,

1450
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,960
we didn't have access to
nearly as much information.

1451
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:50,760
The Internet really exposes fuck yeah.

1452
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:54,640
Every kid knows about pedos
now we got a pedo bear,

1453
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:55,721
you know,

1454
00:40:55,721 --> 00:40:58,990
I mean pedos weren't something
that everybody talked
about when I was a kid was

1455
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,670
it was like you keep away from that man,

1456
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:01,810
he's a bad man.

1457
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:02,201
And He'd be like,

1458
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:02,321
Oh,

1459
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:03,154
who's the bad guy?

1460
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,970
Bad Guy over there.

1461
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:06,780
Why is he back by the partner
wise that nobody understood what,

1462
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,190
how kids know now you have the files,

1463
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,450
how many kinks there are.

1464
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:11,200
Like there's all these,

1465
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,230
you go on line sub categories
of shit and you're like,

1466
00:41:14,231 --> 00:41:14,921
that's a thing.

1467
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:15,310
Really?

1468
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:15,580
Yeah.

1469
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,301
Oh my God,

1470
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:18,940
there's exposed and instead
we're like adults now.

1471
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:22,270
But you realize that like if you
look back on like fifth grade,

1472
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:22,870
you,

1473
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:26,080
he's aware that 10 year olds are online.

1474
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,790
All these,

1475
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,623
oh there's this shit.

1476
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,920
There was always specialty things.

1477
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:30,970
There was always like,

1478
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:31,511
like,

1479
00:41:31,511 --> 00:41:33,070
but it was hard to find them.

1480
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,630
Like if you were going to
be in a weird freak shit.

1481
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,020
Yeah.

1482
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,800
Like some dudes are in the feet.

1483
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,390
Yeah.

1484
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:38,810
And they were,

1485
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,970
they were actual feet magazines.

1486
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,450
Yeah.

1487
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:41,940
Nice.

1488
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,210
We,

1489
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:45,320
I found a feet Porno
magazine with my friends.

1490
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,460
I have it in the woods.

1491
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:46,701
Oh,

1492
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:47,534
okay.

1493
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,640
We were wandering through the woods
and we found a pile of magazines,

1494
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:53,750
like in a plastic bag.

1495
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,640
If you found them in the woods,

1496
00:41:55,641 --> 00:41:58,370
there were almost 60% of
the time they were porn.

1497
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:58,671
Right.

1498
00:41:58,671 --> 00:41:58,911
Right.

1499
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:01,220
If you found a dude who went
to read magazines in the woods,

1500
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,850
it was a lot of people that would go
and they would just go beat off in the

1501
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:05,301
woods,

1502
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:05,601
man.

1503
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:05,961
Great.

1504
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:06,510
I love that.

1505
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:11,510
And dudes that go to read magazines and
they left their stash back there so we

1506
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:12,680
will go find their stash.

1507
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,130
And so it was me and
my two friends and uh,

1508
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:16,521
as,

1509
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:17,060
uh,

1510
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,310
they were opening the,

1511
00:42:18,311 --> 00:42:18,921
the pages,

1512
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:19,280
my front,

1513
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:19,760
there were two,

1514
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,940
one dues from Argentina.

1515
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,160
They'll do was from Cuba.

1516
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,640
Yeah.

1517
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,030
And we're,

1518
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:27,530
we're in Florida and we're peeling back
these pages and this kid stops and he

1519
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:28,364
goes,

1520
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:28,761
man,

1521
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:30,980
I think this shit is just dicks and feet.

1522
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:37,340
Okay.

1523
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,290
Ah,

1524
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,460
that's the quote of the day ladies.

1525
00:42:41,461 --> 00:42:42,294
And,

1526
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:47,330
and it was one of the first times I had
ever saw anybody like so clearly say

1527
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,140
what the fuck when they
don't really want an answer.

1528
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:52,460
Right.

1529
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,460
You know that,

1530
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,630
you know when you say like,

1531
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,800
what the fuck?

1532
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,130
Yeah.

1533
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:56,731
And you don't really,

1534
00:42:56,731 --> 00:42:56,940
yeah.

1535
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,541
It was just like,

1536
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:58,890
what the fuck?

1537
00:42:58,891 --> 00:42:59,880
Like he knew,

1538
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:00,750
I didn't know.

1539
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,630
I knew he didn't know we were 11 or we're
looking at like dude's jerking off on,

1540
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:06,643
yeah,

1541
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,490
I guess a whole thing.

1542
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,750
I've been wanting that to be a thing.

1543
00:43:09,751 --> 00:43:10,650
I didn't know it was,

1544
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,590
I found the creepiest new
fetish I'll yesterday,

1545
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,910
it's called belly punching.

1546
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:20,310
Just guys and girls punching a other
girls in the belly really hard.

1547
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:20,581
Really?

1548
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:21,630
And they get off on it.

1549
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,093
I don't want to watch that.

1550
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:25,800
And the videos are just really disturbing.

1551
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:26,460
I,

1552
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,293
it's from Brazil.

1553
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,820
You don't get that off.

1554
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:29,850
Please shut that off.

1555
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,470
That stuff bugs me.

1556
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,431
I don't get off on it,

1557
00:43:32,431 --> 00:43:33,960
but I've seen it and it was like,

1558
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:36,690
it was so extreme that I
was like in tears laughing.

1559
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,221
What was it?

1560
00:43:37,221 --> 00:43:38,100
The ball kicking.

1561
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:38,920
Oh Jeez.

1562
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,450
But so I saw one,

1563
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:40,711
I was like,

1564
00:43:40,711 --> 00:43:40,801
oh,

1565
00:43:40,801 --> 00:43:42,930
that's clearly that guy has a cup on,

1566
00:43:42,931 --> 00:43:43,261
you know,

1567
00:43:43,261 --> 00:43:46,350
like you can tell this one was genuine.

1568
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,680
She was like,

1569
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,890
she was kicking like 50 yard field.

1570
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:52,620
It's like lining up and taking off.

1571
00:43:52,621 --> 00:43:53,100
And he was like,

1572
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:53,933
ah,

1573
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,400
his legs were shaking and then she's like,

1574
00:43:56,401 --> 00:43:56,701
yes,

1575
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:57,151
suffer,

1576
00:43:57,151 --> 00:43:58,440
suffer and like fucking dude.

1577
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:58,861
Fuck.

1578
00:43:58,861 --> 00:43:59,431
Is that about,

1579
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:00,091
I don't know man.

1580
00:44:00,091 --> 00:44:02,910
But somebody like somebody who's
not watching that like to lap,

1581
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,773
they're watching that.

1582
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,570
That is the most erotic arousing thing.

1583
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,720
I got kicked once so hard in a tournament.

1584
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,590
I've been kicked many times when I get
kicked once in a tournament where my cops

1585
00:44:13,591 --> 00:44:16,560
slammed into my balls and it,

1586
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,630
it Wa I was fucked up.

1587
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:18,871
My,

1588
00:44:18,871 --> 00:44:20,520
my ball swole up,

1589
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:25,550
they were purple and they swole up like
it's swollen up like twice the size of

1590
00:44:26,011 --> 00:44:26,820
normal.

1591
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,810
What I don't understand,

1592
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,880
I don't understand how the
guy can physically take it.

1593
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:30,451
Which I didn't do.

1594
00:44:30,451 --> 00:44:30,900
I have what?

1595
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,890
Do have any photos?

1596
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:33,530
I would have taken a
photo of the batch of it.

1597
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:37,980
I was only like 16 or 17 they physically
tell like cause like that obviously a

1598
00:44:37,981 --> 00:44:40,350
fee where you like ha like
oh it was fucked up man.

1599
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:42,510
I been kicking the balls
and it's like I can't even,

1600
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:45,960
I wouldn't be able to like if there was
a second kick I would just shit myself.

1601
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,700
I got a boner on the way home though,

1602
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:48,540
so I was happy.

1603
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,010
I was happy that it still worked.

1604
00:44:50,011 --> 00:44:52,980
It was almost like my body was letting
me know my way because that was when I

1605
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:53,610
was like,

1606
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,330
when I was like 16 or 17 I want to get
those random boners I could be walking

1607
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:59,900
and it was just kid a complete
hard on like out of nowhere.

1608
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,710
What the fuck is this doing here?

1609
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:02,660
It's cool too.

1610
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,493
You didn't know.

1611
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,090
It's like given a blind person that gun.

1612
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,493
Like what is,

1613
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,473
what is this a trigger?

1614
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,420
I don't know what you're
doing and when you're,

1615
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:15,630
when you're a 17 year old kid
just walking around with a boner.

1616
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,660
I would crank out so many fucking always
horny and like that that chamber is

1617
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:26,330
fucking reloaded immediate immediately.

1618
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:31,440
And what's really fucked up is that
that is probably like one of the biggest

1619
00:45:31,441 --> 00:45:36,441
shifts as a human being that your
life makes from no sex at all.

1620
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:38,400
To boom.

1621
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:41,490
Having a girlfriend when you
were in your teenage years,

1622
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:42,930
which are confusing.

1623
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:44,070
It's fuck yeah.

1624
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:48,540
I mean your teenage years are on mass and
in that you were having relationships.

1625
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:52,050
You're making it out with people and
young penises going into girl's vagina.

1626
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:53,760
It's the best you've
ever felt in your life.

1627
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,580
And she's on the pill so
you can squirt it in her,

1628
00:45:58,410 --> 00:45:58,691
I guess.

1629
00:45:58,691 --> 00:45:59,491
So confused.

1630
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:00,690
He gets so baffled.

1631
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,130
You're so fucking twisted.

1632
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,500
Just so absorbed in that person.

1633
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,660
And that's why you see
so many people that age,

1634
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:10,230
like throw everything else away for
that relationship because they can't.

1635
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:12,120
It's all so addict behavior.

1636
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:12,480
Yeah.

1637
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,860
We've all been guilty of it.

1638
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,140
Sure.

1639
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,150
Addict behaviors.

1640
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:16,770
Not just physical addiction.

1641
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,990
It's just like squirly thinking,

1642
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,040
you know,

1643
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,930
no addict behavior.

1644
00:46:21,931 --> 00:46:23,010
It's like some,

1645
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,040
there's a lot of like different activities
that shouldn't really exist for our

1646
00:46:28,801 --> 00:46:29,850
shitty minds,

1647
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:35,150
but they do exist and people can't
help because of the fact that they have

1648
00:46:35,611 --> 00:46:36,930
access to casinos.

1649
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:42,110
There's certain people that cannot fucking
hell bet they're drawn in there and

1650
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,381
gamble.

1651
00:46:43,381 --> 00:46:44,214
They want to,

1652
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,200
that's what they live for.

1653
00:46:46,201 --> 00:46:46,830
It's it's,

1654
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:47,850
I've seen it.

1655
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:49,200
It's craziness.

1656
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,320
And they'll go on these programs now.

1657
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:52,440
I'm not gambling anymore.

1658
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:53,340
I'm not doing this anymore.

1659
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:53,851
I'm done.

1660
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:54,601
Then next thing you know,

1661
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:55,720
and I'm just going to try it a little,

1662
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,610
I could handle it now.

1663
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:57,690
It's all about management.

1664
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:58,531
Boom,

1665
00:46:58,531 --> 00:46:59,640
back in the slide.

1666
00:46:59,641 --> 00:47:00,900
Crazy in debt.

1667
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:02,790
Never get,

1668
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:03,420
and it's not,

1669
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,200
it's just no,

1670
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,130
just no drugs.

1671
00:47:05,131 --> 00:47:06,030
There's no dealer,

1672
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,610
there's no no poisoning.

1673
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:13,530
There's just fucking do this weird idea
that you need to fucking pull that lever

1674
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:14,530
and see those lemons.

1675
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,230
You so glad I don't have that.

1676
00:47:18,231 --> 00:47:18,600
Oh,

1677
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,580
and then they take that
money and go right back in.

1678
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,910
Was fucking horrified.

1679
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:26,100
It was a guy named White Plains Charlie
when I was a kid and I used to play pool

1680
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:27,240
at executive billiards.

1681
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:32,290
He was the first guy that ever met
was an absolute 100% gambling junkie.

1682
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,710
This guy didn't do a goddamn thing for a,

1683
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,280
and he lived off of handouts
and games who hustled pool.

1684
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,430
He slept in like homeless
shelters and the,

1685
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:42,790
you know,

1686
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:45,070
in different people's houses and you know,

1687
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,450
had apartments in like real,

1688
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:49,990
real squirrely situations and he would
just come down the pool hall and go to

1689
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:52,360
the race track and
that's all this guy did.

1690
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:53,590
That's all this guy did.

1691
00:47:53,591 --> 00:47:54,760
He was always in action.

1692
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:59,470
He was always an action component and it
was so sad guy cause he was in his like

1693
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:01,360
seventies you know.

1694
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:02,260
And he was like,

1695
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:02,831
you know,

1696
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:04,360
just a really tiny,

1697
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:08,800
tiny man and people would yell at 'em
and they'd fucking treat him like shit

1698
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:12,880
cause he was always broke and he would
yell at them and he would always loses

1699
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:13,743
money.

1700
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:17,010
Those guys almost had those motherfuckers.

1701
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,720
I'm supposed to have seven,

1702
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:19,650
seven a fight and you know,

1703
00:48:19,651 --> 00:48:22,380
we'd have some number of
problem that went wrong on.

1704
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:22,940
Of course,

1705
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,830
I know that would have paid two thousand
two thousand can you believe that?

1706
00:48:26,831 --> 00:48:27,400
Shit.

1707
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,670
I can't tell you how many conversations
I had with White Plains Charlie.

1708
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:31,031
Well,

1709
00:48:31,031 --> 00:48:31,960
he would come in there and go,

1710
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:32,201
Joe,

1711
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,130
you ain't going to believe this.

1712
00:48:33,131 --> 00:48:34,540
That got me out the track again.

1713
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,620
I'm down and I was,

1714
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,150
I was like at the time,

1715
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,730
maybe 22 to 23 years old,

1716
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,600
so the whole thing to me was
just completely baffling.

1717
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:43,061
I was like,

1718
00:48:43,061 --> 00:48:43,661
wow,

1719
00:48:43,661 --> 00:48:46,210
this guy's out of his
fucking head for sure.

1720
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:47,230
This is crazy.

1721
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:48,940
He just can't stop gambling.

1722
00:48:48,941 --> 00:48:50,200
I've never seen anything like it.

1723
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:50,651
I know it could.

1724
00:48:50,651 --> 00:48:52,750
Poker guy like that who just can't stop.

1725
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:56,080
They can't stop and sweaty hands.

1726
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:56,450
I,

1727
00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:01,450
I was completely addicted to play in
that quake game a hundred percent 100% I

1728
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:02,110
loved it.

1729
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:02,621
Loved it,

1730
00:49:02,621 --> 00:49:03,011
loved it.

1731
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:04,150
Dubbed the hours and hours a day.

1732
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,720
If you were talking and I'm listening to
you talk and you're boring the shit out

1733
00:49:07,721 --> 00:49:08,470
of me and be like,

1734
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:11,890
why am I spending time doing this when
I can be playing quake and my time would

1735
00:49:11,891 --> 00:49:13,420
be awesome as always,

1736
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:16,300
really I would not want to talk to people.

1737
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:19,750
I would want it to sit in front of the
computer with the headphones on because

1738
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:22,090
you could hear like who's
walking on the right hand side.

1739
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:25,180
Really like footsteps on the
right or footsteps on the left.

1740
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,081
You have to,

1741
00:49:26,081 --> 00:49:28,810
you have to creep because if you
walk you don't make any noise.

1742
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,890
But if you want to jump,

1743
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:31,060
if you want to strafe jump.

1744
00:49:31,061 --> 00:49:31,990
If you want to run,

1745
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:32,920
you make noise.

1746
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:33,700
Yeah,

1747
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,900
and I would get addicted dude.

1748
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,520
Wander down hallways,

1749
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:38,520
rocket launcher and people in the heads.

1750
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:39,251
It's fun.

1751
00:49:39,251 --> 00:49:40,060
It's fun.

1752
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,880
I've been lost in video games
before to addict behavior.

1753
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,950
The real problem is it doesn't make you
ultimately feel like you got anything

1754
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:48,580
done.

1755
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:52,570
Like if I put the same amount of effort
into making podcasts or the same amount

1756
00:49:52,571 --> 00:49:54,460
of effort into like doing stand up,

1757
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,500
I feel like I got something done,

1758
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:57,933
you know?

1759
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:03,270
But if you're just out there fucking
throwing squares with numbers around,

1760
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:06,491
what are you doing?

1761
00:50:06,491 --> 00:50:06,881
What are you doing?

1762
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:07,481
You playing cards?

1763
00:50:07,481 --> 00:50:08,041
What are you doing?

1764
00:50:08,041 --> 00:50:09,220
Just nothing actually happening.

1765
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,361
He playing quake.

1766
00:50:10,361 --> 00:50:10,790
I fucked him.

1767
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,820
Killed everybody that
nothing really happened.

1768
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:13,210
No.

1769
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:13,481
Okay.

1770
00:50:13,481 --> 00:50:14,050
You just got,

1771
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,190
you just got jolted,

1772
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:18,550
nothing was really created an eight hours.

1773
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:21,370
You basically gave all your time,

1774
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:21,940
you know,

1775
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:22,710
to this uh,

1776
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:26,560
this artificial experience and you know
you've got an adrenaline rush out of it.

1777
00:50:26,561 --> 00:50:27,530
It was a lot of fun.

1778
00:50:27,531 --> 00:50:28,400
It was great but,

1779
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,530
but ultimately nothing was created.

1780
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,630
Whereas like if you took that same
amount of time and you decided to,

1781
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,910
I'm going to draw a picture,

1782
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,110
I'm going to paint something,

1783
00:50:36,111 --> 00:50:40,130
I'm going to write a song like an actual
physical thing manifests itself that

1784
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:44,960
people can enjoy or
fucking rocket launches.

1785
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,990
Lightening Bolt guns and
shit gunning people down.

1786
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:48,970
Hey low.

1787
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,300
You don't get anything out of that.

1788
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,670
It's weird that your
game halo you used to be.

1789
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,180
I tried to,

1790
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,170
I step away.

1791
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:58,970
I literally forced myself not to get on
game systems that much anymore cause I

1792
00:50:58,971 --> 00:50:59,510
would,

1793
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:04,510
I would do that and I would do a
Madden and NCAA most to be awesome.

1794
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:06,403
The mad

1795
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:09,530
cause I liked college ball a lot.

1796
00:51:09,531 --> 00:51:10,280
I would play,

1797
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,690
you could create a player,

1798
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,090
you start your team
and then play a season.

1799
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:15,080
Did you make white guys?

1800
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:16,130
When I would make,

1801
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:21,220
I would make fucking Tom run at 43 44
it would give them ridiculous power.

1802
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,181
Absolutely.

1803
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:26,390
I'd be like Vikings three
two 30 just fucking yoked.

1804
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:26,871
Yeah,

1805
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:27,411
absolutely.

1806
00:51:27,411 --> 00:51:28,100
Just Vikings,

1807
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,670
Vikings,

1808
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,370
army of Brock Lesnar's the full,

1809
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:32,750
I would say I would play,

1810
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,120
I would do the spring thing,

1811
00:51:34,121 --> 00:51:39,121
spring ball and then play fucking 12
games season that the conference game and

1812
00:51:39,981 --> 00:51:41,300
the in the bowl game.

1813
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:45,800
And then recruit players for that cause
you can recruit and recruit them for the

1814
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,700
next year and fucking,

1815
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:47,510
I'd played,

1816
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,020
you know,

1817
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,860
14 games in a row and I'm like holding
on for the next season to start.

1818
00:51:51,861 --> 00:51:53,270
And this is like in one city.

1819
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,210
Wow.

1820
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:54,381
Yeah.

1821
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:54,700
It's,

1822
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,790
it's hours and hours.

1823
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:57,560
It's not good man.

1824
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,690
Well that's the same thing with poker too,

1825
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:00,050
right?

1826
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:00,231
I mean,

1827
00:52:00,231 --> 00:52:01,430
when people start playing poker,

1828
00:52:01,431 --> 00:52:02,390
don't they disappear?

1829
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:03,291
Absolutely.

1830
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:03,800
And the guys that,

1831
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,850
the guy that I know that,

1832
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:05,360
that,

1833
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,171
that does it the most,

1834
00:52:06,171 --> 00:52:08,510
like not only did you disappear
and doing all that behavior,

1835
00:52:08,511 --> 00:52:11,030
but he's also fucking
losing his livelihood.

1836
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:11,390
You know,

1837
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:14,510
like Shit fucking down 500 today.

1838
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,083
So art,

1839
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:17,900
it's hard to make a living playing poker.

1840
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,610
You mean you gotta be super good?

1841
00:52:19,611 --> 00:52:22,800
You mean all props to those Daniel and
the Granola type characters that have

1842
00:52:22,801 --> 00:52:23,150
been noon,

1843
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:25,820
Phil Ivey and all these guys
that you like to hear about?

1844
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,440
I don't play it.

1845
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:27,950
Um,

1846
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:29,270
I don't like cards.

1847
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,950
It's not that I don't like cards,

1848
00:52:30,951 --> 00:52:31,281
it's just,

1849
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:35,000
it's not something that I'm interested
in doing because when I was a a kid and I

1850
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:35,960
would play pool,

1851
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,480
the card games would always
interrupt the pool action.

1852
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:38,931
Oh really?

1853
00:52:38,931 --> 00:52:40,460
And everybody would like Jesus Christ.

1854
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,530
Is this a card place or a pool hall?

1855
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,930
Like guys that what you
would normally get bets with?

1856
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,410
They wanted to go gamble because
that's all pool halls were about.

1857
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:50,110
All pool halls were about what?

1858
00:52:50,111 --> 00:52:52,860
It's like hobby people who were into a,

1859
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:55,250
just knocking balls around with
their friends who never got good.

1860
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:57,590
And then either tournament
players are gamblers.

1861
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,280
And so the tournament players are usually
both porn meant players and gamblers.

1862
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:06,260
So there's always gambling unless of
asshole came around with a deck of cards

1863
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,990
because you can't,

1864
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:08,420
you don't,

1865
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,950
you can miss when you're playing pool,

1866
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:10,520
you know,

1867
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,121
you can mess,

1868
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:14,450
you can hit play on a Gaffey table
where the pockets are weird and this guy

1869
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:15,920
might know the table about it than you do.

1870
00:53:15,921 --> 00:53:17,660
So he knows what spots to avoid.

1871
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,540
But with poker you can't eat,

1872
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:21,380
does no missing.

1873
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:21,681
You just,

1874
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:22,550
you're really gambling,

1875
00:53:22,551 --> 00:53:23,271
you're just gambling.

1876
00:53:23,271 --> 00:53:23,481
You know,

1877
00:53:23,481 --> 00:53:23,661
you're,

1878
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:25,950
you're using your intelligence
but also gambling.

1879
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:27,060
I don't get poked in the,

1880
00:53:27,061 --> 00:53:27,990
I'm of the mind for it,

1881
00:53:27,991 --> 00:53:28,260
man.

1882
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:28,950
I'm really powerful.

1883
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:29,431
CTO,

1884
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:30,180
coconut water.

1885
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:30,960
Thank you very much.

1886
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,830
I'm not into it man.

1887
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:32,251
Let me see.

1888
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:34,980
Emanated by numbers
and I'm intimidated by,

1889
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:36,093
um,

1890
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,980
just like the game itself never been,

1891
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,240
was like an awesome game.

1892
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,500
It seems like a,

1893
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,600
a real absorbing game though.

1894
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:43,680
It seems like a very,

1895
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,230
like you have to really be a,

1896
00:53:45,231 --> 00:53:49,350
a bad motherfucker to understand the
in and outs of poker and to have like,

1897
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,160
you know,

1898
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,810
years and years of intuition.

1899
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,010
I mean those are special dudes.

1900
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,260
They,

1901
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,140
they obviously have special mines.

1902
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:56,243
Just for me,

1903
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:56,990
my,

1904
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:57,390
my,

1905
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:00,390
I was always so absorbed with
things that required execution,

1906
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:03,480
physical execution as well as like mental.

1907
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:07,680
And that's why I liked quake cause it was
like this hand eye coordination thing.

1908
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,720
That was what I was
getting my rocks off on.

1909
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:11,610
And that's the same thing with pool.

1910
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:15,000
So to me it's like it was always a
physical thing as well as a mental thing.

1911
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,380
I felt like the real,

1912
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:17,970
the real thrills to me,

1913
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,190
well when I can combine
the two things together,

1914
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,610
when I could combine a physical
experience and a mental experience.

1915
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:25,290
That's why I liked Jujitsu.

1916
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,120
That's why I like playing pool.

1917
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:29,130
So the card thing was lacking.

1918
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:30,000
The physical part,

1919
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:31,170
there's no execution.

1920
00:54:31,171 --> 00:54:32,340
I didn't have to execute.

1921
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,121
So that was,

1922
00:54:33,121 --> 00:54:34,500
it was like way less exciting.

1923
00:54:34,501 --> 00:54:34,920
I was like,

1924
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,800
you can't compare the difference between
when you're watching a guy gambling and

1925
00:54:38,801 --> 00:54:43,801
his gambling for $10,000 a set of nine
ball and every fucking pocket he's

1926
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:49,730
putting his hands on his shirt and blow
it on his hands and put talcum powder on

1927
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:52,080
and he's sweating and he's
trying to keep it together.

1928
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:57,230
You're trying to like really gently
control how ball spins and collides with

1929
00:54:58,441 --> 00:54:59,940
another ball and you know,

1930
00:54:59,941 --> 00:55:04,020
make sure that you hit it just enough
so that lands perfectly for the next one

1931
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,580
all while you're gambling,

1932
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:06,211
you know?

1933
00:55:06,211 --> 00:55:06,920
I mean that's what,

1934
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,730
what's exciting when you're just
sitting there with cards and you,

1935
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,300
you know what card to pick stupid.

1936
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,480
Just pick the fucking card.

1937
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,980
It's like you win or you don't when it's
like it's not the same loss you guys

1938
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:18,690
shoots your nuts in and the game of pool,

1939
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,530
I'll give you a plan.

1940
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:21,600
10 year plan to race to 10 and he breaks.

1941
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:23,220
It runs out 10 games on you,

1942
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:23,851
you lose.

1943
00:55:23,851 --> 00:55:26,400
You don't even get a chance to
play like that can't happen.

1944
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,241
That has happened.

1945
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:28,380
It really not to me,

1946
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,900
but it has happened in
the past 10 in a row.

1947
00:55:30,901 --> 00:55:31,360
Just run.

1948
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,850
The things happen more than once.

1949
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:35,610
There was a one guy who
did it for $1 million.

1950
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:36,810
Cool.

1951
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:37,111
Yeah.

1952
00:55:37,111 --> 00:55:41,430
They had an insurance policy
to a c who could a run.

1953
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,900
If you could run 10 racks in a row,

1954
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:44,820
which has never been done
in the competition before,

1955
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,350
you could win $1 million.

1956
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:48,540
They'd only been done
like a couple of times.

1957
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:53,280
Like Johnny Archer ran 10 and out on
Francisco Bustamonte there were gambling.

1958
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:57,840
And that was like a legendary
story because Francisco
Bustamante doubled the bet

1959
00:55:57,841 --> 00:55:59,820
after Johnny Archer ran 10 and out on him.

1960
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:00,181
And he was like,

1961
00:56:00,181 --> 00:56:01,470
this guy can't keep this shit up.

1962
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,721
Doubled the bat.

1963
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:03,690
And then in the next game,

1964
00:56:03,691 --> 00:56:04,524
which is really nuts.

1965
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:07,140
And then the other one was
this Earl Strickland guy who,

1966
00:56:07,141 --> 00:56:07,460
uh,

1967
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:11,460
they had this 10 rack thing where
they were insured for 1 million bucks,

1968
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,670
but the insurance company didn't want
to pay because they couldn't believe it.

1969
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:16,650
It had been done.

1970
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:18,360
They couldn't believe like they,

1971
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,040
they found the statistics.

1972
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:21,000
No one had ever broken,

1973
00:56:21,001 --> 00:56:23,160
run out 10 racks ever in any,

1974
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:23,770
you know,

1975
00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:24,461
modern nine,

1976
00:56:24,461 --> 00:56:26,440
that ball tournament that
they could have on record.

1977
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:27,161
So they said,

1978
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:27,461
listen,

1979
00:56:27,461 --> 00:56:30,790
I don't think it's much of
a gamble bet $1 million.

1980
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:31,451
If someone does it,

1981
00:56:31,451 --> 00:56:34,570
they win $1 million or else trickling
did it the first fucking tournament they

1982
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:35,404
had.

1983
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:36,790
I think it was the first,

1984
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:40,390
it was either first this
second he broken ran 10 racks,

1985
00:56:40,391 --> 00:56:43,680
like a demon fired in
combinations on the nine ball.

1986
00:56:43,681 --> 00:56:45,040
I mean it was ridiculous shit.

1987
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:46,240
It was like movie shit.

1988
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:46,841
I am,

1989
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:47,651
they denied him.

1990
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:51,140
I think he wound up settling but
he never got like the full million.

1991
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:52,000
I'm really,

1992
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,340
I think he only got like a quarter
million bucks or something like that.

1993
00:56:54,341 --> 00:56:55,720
I hope I'm wrong,

1994
00:56:55,990 --> 00:57:00,340
but he's like one of the greatest
players of all time and uh,

1995
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,061
and you know,

1996
00:57:01,061 --> 00:57:02,080
and he gambles too.

1997
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,850
He does like those action challenges.

1998
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,460
There's a action report
matches where they uh,

1999
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:07,300
they have um,

2000
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:07,841
uh,

2001
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,850
online del La have like just two
guys playing for like 25,000 bucks.

2002
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:13,630
I'm like put up the
money and then they'll,

2003
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:15,520
they'll have like a gambling contest.

2004
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:16,361
You ever played a,

2005
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:17,200
what's the other one called?

2006
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:18,401
Sneaker?

2007
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:18,910
Sneaker?

2008
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:19,361
No,

2009
00:57:19,361 --> 00:57:22,120
I've never played that
same principle but smaller.

2010
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,020
Well,

2011
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:23,321
um,

2012
00:57:23,321 --> 00:57:25,030
it requires uh,

2013
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:27,550
some incredible fundamentals.

2014
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:27,791
You,

2015
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:32,791
there's more room for error in a game
pool then there is and snuck her first of

2016
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:35,240
all because the nine ball,

2017
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:36,760
like the chosen gambling game,

2018
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:37,390
nine balls,

2019
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,800
the balls are all wild.

2020
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,340
So what that means is if you miss the one
ball in the corner pocket but it spins

2021
00:57:42,341 --> 00:57:43,630
around and lands on the side,

2022
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,561
it's still counts.

2023
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:44,920
You just,

2024
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:45,611
you keep going.

2025
00:57:45,611 --> 00:57:46,250
When snuck her,

2026
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,320
I don't think that would ever count.

2027
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,870
I think sneakers like very precise,

2028
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:50,441
you know,

2029
00:57:50,441 --> 00:57:51,100
I think,

2030
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:51,461
you know,

2031
00:57:51,461 --> 00:57:52,930
and you have to move balls.

2032
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:56,350
I don't really totally
completely understand it and
the tables fucking huge and

2033
00:57:56,351 --> 00:58:00,190
the balls are tiny and the pockets are
tiny as shit and there's certain ways we

2034
00:58:00,191 --> 00:58:00,551
shoot it.

2035
00:58:00,551 --> 00:58:02,140
It doesn't accept the ball the same way.

2036
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:03,610
It doesn't pull a table.

2037
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:07,090
Like I don't think you can cut a ball
down the rail the way you can on a,

2038
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:07,391
on a,

2039
00:58:07,391 --> 00:58:08,480
on a regular pool table.

2040
00:58:08,481 --> 00:58:08,840
So it's,

2041
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,091
it's,

2042
00:58:09,091 --> 00:58:11,110
it's a little bit of a
different sort of a game.

2043
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,290
But snooker players
notoriously are good at pool.

2044
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:14,921
They,

2045
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:15,220
uh,

2046
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:19,530
like some like the top world snuck
players like these English guys and killed

2047
00:58:19,531 --> 00:58:20,261
Steve Davis.

2048
00:58:20,261 --> 00:58:20,561
Yeah.

2049
00:58:20,561 --> 00:58:21,040
They,

2050
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:21,581
these uh,

2051
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:24,760
these guys are awesome
snugger players like world,

2052
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:25,480
you know,

2053
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,510
world champions and they come over and
a pool and then eventually they start

2054
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,240
Rodney O'sullivan and eventually
I start fucking up the Americans.

2055
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:31,681
Really?

2056
00:58:31,681 --> 00:58:32,410
It takes time.

2057
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:32,740
Yeah.

2058
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,491
Well the Americans,

2059
00:58:33,491 --> 00:58:34,324
there's um,

2060
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,130
this is like a few high level guys,

2061
00:58:36,131 --> 00:58:36,890
but um,

2062
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:39,520
the European guys have such a strong team.

2063
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,060
Man.

2064
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:42,180
It's like there's so many guys like the,

2065
00:58:42,181 --> 00:58:44,290
the Americans might have like
the best guys of all time.

2066
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:45,040
Like Johnny Archer,

2067
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,270
one of the best guys of all time,

2068
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,370
Earl's trickling when the
best guys of all time.

2069
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,610
Shane van Boning one of the best guys of
all time and one of the best guys right

2070
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:51,880
now.

2071
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,050
But Europe is like,

2072
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,450
there's so many fucking
players that are killers.

2073
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,100
Rear Sump,

2074
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:57,970
many pool is huge over there.

2075
00:58:57,971 --> 00:58:58,510
Man.

2076
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,640
It's weird how many good guys in Asia,

2077
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:01,720
they say an Asia,

2078
00:59:01,721 --> 00:59:02,740
like there's parts of Asia.

2079
00:59:02,741 --> 00:59:04,570
We're pool is fucking enormous.

2080
00:59:04,571 --> 00:59:05,800
The Philippines especially,

2081
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,240
it's enormous.

2082
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:08,021
Like you'd go there.

2083
00:59:08,021 --> 00:59:08,930
It's like one of their most,

2084
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:11,680
they're like number one,

2085
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,833
um,

2086
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:14,920
behind soccer I think.

2087
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,590
I think at soccer they're the
Philippines in the soccer.

2088
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:19,020
Does that make sense?

2089
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:19,750
Or is it baseball?

2090
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:20,110
What am I,

2091
00:59:20,110 --> 00:59:20,943
am I knickers?

2092
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,793
Maybe.

2093
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,330
I know we're just making shit up.

2094
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:24,360
Bace no.

2095
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:24,471
Well,

2096
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:24,891
I mean,

2097
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:25,940
I slip and slide.

2098
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:30,410
I'm amazed by how sports
like culturally like evolve.

2099
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:35,530
Well also how certain places like so love
a sport and do not give up fuck about

2100
00:59:38,271 --> 00:59:39,104
another sport.

2101
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,020
Like cricket would be a
great example of like,

2102
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:43,490
it's big and some of the islands,

2103
00:59:43,491 --> 00:59:45,920
it's huge in India.

2104
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:46,880
Pakistan,

2105
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:47,720
um,

2106
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,553
Australia,

2107
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:49,760
I mean,

2108
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,593
that shit is like,

2109
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:51,680
is it a gambling game?

2110
00:59:51,681 --> 00:59:52,550
Is that why it's big?

2111
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,960
I don't know if it's a gambling game,

2112
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:55,250
but like you watch it and I'm like,

2113
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:56,210
I don't what the fuck's going on?

2114
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,180
And clearly nobody in this country
who's not from one of those countries,

2115
00:59:59,210 --> 00:59:59,851
like nobody gets,

2116
00:59:59,851 --> 01:00:00,950
I don't know the rules.

2117
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:01,760
It's,

2118
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,170
I think it's difficult to follow.

2119
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:04,780
Like you see the number,

2120
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:05,120
you're like,

2121
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:05,331
what?

2122
01:00:05,331 --> 01:00:07,010
And it's like a five day game,

2123
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:07,791
you know,

2124
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:10,220
you don't understand why
they're selling pass.

2125
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:12,190
I never do cocaine.

2126
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:12,801
I just,

2127
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:13,634
I can't get into it.

2128
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,541
But you know,

2129
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:15,374
same thing.

2130
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:16,130
Billiards,

2131
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:16,963
soccer,

2132
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:17,751
football,

2133
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:20,330
like those are very regional specific.

2134
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:23,630
Well I think you get into a game
and then once you get into it,

2135
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:26,480
you understand the skill behind
it and then that's what you,

2136
01:00:26,481 --> 01:00:27,180
you know,

2137
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:27,450
look,

2138
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:28,970
it's so weird.

2139
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:31,880
And people were willing to
fall into things so odd.

2140
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:35,030
Just look at the way
baseball uniforms look like.

2141
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:36,560
What the fuck are you dressing?

2142
01:00:36,561 --> 01:00:39,770
Like why do you have to translate
that for this stupid game?

2143
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:42,020
You're dressing like you
live in a different century.

2144
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:44,480
What kind of stupid button
up shirt or you Wang,

2145
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,400
what the fuck is with your socks?

2146
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,280
What the fuck is with your tight pants?

2147
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:52,400
If you were just a regular dude walking
around with those pants and then street,

2148
01:00:52,401 --> 01:00:54,080
I'd say get the fuck away from my kids.

2149
01:00:54,081 --> 01:00:54,590
Yeah,

2150
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:56,810
but because you're
playing some silly game,

2151
01:00:56,811 --> 01:00:57,840
you have to dress like a,

2152
01:00:57,841 --> 01:00:58,850
a pilgrim.

2153
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:00,180
This is ridiculous.

2154
01:01:00,181 --> 01:01:02,060
This game's retarded beyond belief.

2155
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:03,890
I know it needs to be revamped.

2156
01:01:03,891 --> 01:01:06,290
It's like one step away
from a pirates fucking out.

2157
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:08,510
It's ridiculous and
it's a ridiculous game.

2158
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,920
It's just fucking boring as shit.

2159
01:01:09,921 --> 01:01:10,790
It takes too long.

2160
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:11,690
I can't do it.

2161
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,681
I've never had to do it.

2162
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:13,220
I liked it.

2163
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,770
I like playing it when I was a
kid and when you like playing it,

2164
01:01:15,771 --> 01:01:18,310
you understand what the
skills involved and you know,

2165
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:22,460
hitting a 94 mile an hour fast ball or
fucking really skilled but catching a

2166
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:24,740
ball that's like over the
fucking top of the wall.

2167
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:26,390
But who cares?

2168
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:27,763
Yeah,

2169
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:28,610
I don't,

2170
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:29,443
I don't like baseball.

2171
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,030
I like football by far.

2172
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,560
My favorites like woman's softball.

2173
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,850
Sports are awesome.

2174
01:01:34,851 --> 01:01:35,481
I'll tell you what,

2175
01:01:35,481 --> 01:01:35,930
man,

2176
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:37,790
anything that's hard is awesome.

2177
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,330
Anything where you get into it and
you try to express yourself and,

2178
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:43,230
and you know and show your,

2179
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:46,790
your ability to concentrate and focus
through a ball or through whatever the

2180
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:48,650
fuck it is that you're doing in any sport.

2181
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:49,850
I love watching it.

2182
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,260
I love watching competition.

2183
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,220
I love watching.

2184
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:53,930
I love watching people,

2185
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:56,510
but pay off like a hard work paying off.

2186
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,673
That's like,

2187
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:58,161
to me,

2188
01:01:58,161 --> 01:01:59,510
I want to see that shit all the time.

2189
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:00,350
Even tennis,

2190
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:02,090
I don't give a fuck about tennis,

2191
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:03,530
but I watched some tennis the other day.

2192
01:02:03,531 --> 01:02:04,364
I just watched it.

2193
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:04,851
I was like,

2194
01:02:04,851 --> 01:02:05,091
whoa.

2195
01:02:05,091 --> 01:02:06,560
That guy's really trying to hit that ball.

2196
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:07,311
And he's really trying to get,

2197
01:02:07,311 --> 01:02:07,521
oh,

2198
01:02:07,521 --> 01:02:08,660
he's real close and pressed.

2199
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:11,270
I don't really give a fuck what's
going on because it's not my thing.

2200
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:13,790
But if I was a tennis head
instead of a pool head,

2201
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:14,990
it's the same thing.

2202
01:02:14,991 --> 01:02:15,510
It is.

2203
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:19,980
It's easily gotten hooked on
tennis or baseball or golf.

2204
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:21,540
This is a fucking era.

2205
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:23,280
A golden era for tennis too.

2206
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:25,450
Isn't bad motherfuckers playing really?

2207
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:26,041
Fuck.

2208
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:26,281
Yeah.

2209
01:02:26,281 --> 01:02:26,700
I mean,

2210
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:27,421
who's that guy?

2211
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:30,360
The guy that beat Serena and um,

2212
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:31,620
the other one was,

2213
01:02:31,621 --> 01:02:32,060
what are the other,

2214
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,570
the other William's name?

2215
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,350
Viness.

2216
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:34,980
Yeah.

2217
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:37,080
Being a sensory and he beat them both.

2218
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:37,521
Really?

2219
01:02:37,521 --> 01:02:37,631
Yeah,

2220
01:02:37,631 --> 01:02:38,100
man.

2221
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:38,850
After he played,

2222
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:39,631
he played golf,

2223
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:40,500
drank beer,

2224
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:41,161
and then,

2225
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:41,370
uh,

2226
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:41,910
played,

2227
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:42,181
uh,

2228
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:42,930
one,

2229
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,160
one seven to one,

2230
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:44,431
or whatever.

2231
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:45,264
The fuck this really,

2232
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:45,600
yeah.

2233
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:46,440
Beat them both.

2234
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:46,840
Yeah.

2235
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,510
I don't know.

2236
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:48,343
I'll do that.

2237
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:49,520
I'll do it.

2238
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,353
I'll pull it up.

2239
01:02:50,930 --> 01:02:52,380
It's a famous case.

2240
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,880
Federer is,

2241
01:02:53,881 --> 01:02:54,714
you know,

2242
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:55,650
like,

2243
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:56,400
just amazed.

2244
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:57,510
Like he'd be looking at his,

2245
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,380
he's like one of the
all time best right now,

2246
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:00,450
right by far.

2247
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:01,343
Yeah.

2248
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:01,771
He's,

2249
01:03:01,771 --> 01:03:02,340
um,

2250
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:02,880
he's like,

2251
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,790
they could put him up there with
Mcenroe and as proud of those guys,

2252
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:08,850
he devastated and crabs dominates people.

2253
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:09,561
That's amazing.

2254
01:03:09,561 --> 01:03:12,750
And he's been doing it
consistently now for just years.

2255
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:15,030
Men and the dog is also up there.

2256
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:15,751
And uh,

2257
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:16,261
what's his name?

2258
01:03:16,261 --> 01:03:17,094
Just retired,

2259
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:17,340
uh,

2260
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,780
Roddick and everybody was like,

2261
01:03:18,781 --> 01:03:22,260
if his peer class wasn't so good,

2262
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:23,640
he would be,

2263
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:26,130
he would have won so many more titles,

2264
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:29,040
but he's just happens to be around,

2265
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:29,973
uh,

2266
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,140
uh,

2267
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,960
in this era of like so many,

2268
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,110
just absolutely dominant tennis players.

2269
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:37,531
Yeah.

2270
01:03:37,531 --> 01:03:38,970
I don't follow it enough,

2271
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,790
but I would assume that that's just
the case with everything right now.

2272
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:42,031
Right.

2273
01:03:42,031 --> 01:03:42,301
I mean,

2274
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:42,890
like some of,

2275
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:44,480
in the case of basketball towns,

2276
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:47,880
like here's an example of one where
it's not like the heavyweight boxing

2277
01:03:47,881 --> 01:03:48,630
division.

2278
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:50,700
So people say this is just the,

2279
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,460
an era where it's not as,

2280
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,950
as competitive and as big.

2281
01:03:55,951 --> 01:03:58,560
There's not as many big exciting fighters.

2282
01:03:58,830 --> 01:03:59,340
So,

2283
01:03:59,340 --> 01:03:59,760
you know,

2284
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,560
we don't talk about right now
as being the most exciting time.

2285
01:04:04,561 --> 01:04:05,160
And I mean,

2286
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:05,371
you know,

2287
01:04:05,371 --> 01:04:06,870
boxing in general has taken a dip,

2288
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:10,860
but like people have always been drawn
to the heavyweight division in boxing.

2289
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:11,401
You know,

2290
01:04:11,401 --> 01:04:12,210
it's the most,

2291
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:13,043
it's the one that,

2292
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,310
that people always like big,

2293
01:04:14,311 --> 01:04:14,581
you know,

2294
01:04:14,581 --> 01:04:16,800
so the heavyweight boxers right now,

2295
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:17,520
you know,

2296
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,300
I guess you could,

2297
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,140
the Klitschkos,

2298
01:04:19,141 --> 01:04:20,610
the Klitschkos can pretty much own it.

2299
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:20,791
I mean,

2300
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:22,440
part of that you could argue that hey,

2301
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:23,640
they're not American.

2302
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:26,760
So Americans get excited about
American heavyweights basically.

2303
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,530
And those guys have been dominant.

2304
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,364
They're not American,

2305
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:30,630
but you know,

2306
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:35,660
the division pretty much has a lot of
journeymen and they go up and they give it

2307
01:04:35,821 --> 01:04:36,270
a shot.

2308
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:38,490
And sometimes the belt switches hands,

2309
01:04:38,491 --> 01:04:41,610
but it's pretty much the Klitschkos to,

2310
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:42,391
to run through.

2311
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:43,890
And people don't talk about this.

2312
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:44,310
I was like,

2313
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:44,761
wow,

2314
01:04:44,761 --> 01:04:45,990
this era right now,

2315
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,010
you know,

2316
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:47,880
heavyweight boxers,

2317
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:48,873
not a great area.

2318
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:49,670
It's not a great area.

2319
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:53,490
I know it's not a like a Holyfield
or Lennox Lewis and there's,

2320
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:54,150
and there's,

2321
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:55,950
and then like another guy would pop up.

2322
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:56,521
But you know,

2323
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:57,810
beau would pop in and you'd be like,

2324
01:04:57,811 --> 01:04:58,231
Oh shit,

2325
01:04:58,231 --> 01:04:58,891
who's this guy?

2326
01:04:58,891 --> 01:04:59,730
And it's weird,

2327
01:04:59,731 --> 01:05:01,290
the two white guys are running shit.

2328
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,920
Ronnie White Russian dudes
who are doctors this,

2329
01:05:04,921 --> 01:05:05,190
uh,

2330
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:05,830
running shit.

2331
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:06,181
They tell you,

2332
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:06,721
I went to this,

2333
01:05:06,721 --> 01:05:09,210
I went to this boxing gym in,

2334
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:09,520
uh,

2335
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:09,730
uh,

2336
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:13,620
in Glendale and it was a guy there who
was like trained a bunch of them and he

2337
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:16,590
said basically like those
guys they train like,

2338
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:17,050
all right,

2339
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:17,920
a thousand right?

2340
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:19,410
Crosses like,

2341
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:19,631
yeah,

2342
01:05:19,631 --> 01:05:20,950
they're willing to do some shit.

2343
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,460
Then like if someone comes in not
knowing that to start that shit over.

2344
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:29,640
And so like technically every punch
is always exactly like executed,

2345
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,110
like never off.

2346
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:32,771
You'd watch them.

2347
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:33,371
It's just like,

2348
01:05:33,371 --> 01:05:34,840
it's perfect execution,

2349
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:37,630
but it's not exciting before
anybody has a chance to get good.

2350
01:05:37,631 --> 01:05:38,464
They nip them,

2351
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:42,730
go get them quick before he gets sit
as a guy becomes he remotely and the

2352
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:44,560
contention and the guy,

2353
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,450
the trainer guy was like,

2354
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:46,990
he's,

2355
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:47,681
he's foreign.

2356
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:48,910
So he has this heavy accent.

2357
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:50,530
And he's like telling me about like,

2358
01:05:50,531 --> 01:05:51,340
different,

2359
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:51,611
he's like,

2360
01:05:51,611 --> 01:05:51,731
no.

2361
01:05:51,731 --> 01:05:53,410
Have you ever fight with a Mexican?

2362
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:54,130
You know,

2363
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:54,791
they're like dogs.

2364
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:55,540
They just go into a fight,

2365
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:55,721
fight,

2366
01:05:55,721 --> 01:05:55,901
fight,

2367
01:05:55,901 --> 01:05:56,250
fight.

2368
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:56,610
I'm like,

2369
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:57,443
okay.

2370
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,031
I was like,

2371
01:05:58,031 --> 01:05:59,250
do you tell everybody that?

2372
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:00,340
He's like,

2373
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:00,990
fuck dude,

2374
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:02,680
it's such that foreign mindset.

2375
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:03,501
This is no,

2376
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:04,334
this is just how it is.

2377
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,290
Just racism was,

2378
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,353
and just like,

2379
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:06,821
he's like,

2380
01:06:06,821 --> 01:06:06,981
Dad,

2381
01:06:06,981 --> 01:06:07,331
he's like,

2382
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:09,580
you gotta take a Mexican doubt
cause they'll never stop fighting.

2383
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:10,790
And I'm like crying.

2384
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,833
And then he was like,

2385
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:12,740
the blacks,

2386
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:13,660
oh please,

2387
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:14,540
just great.

2388
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:14,810
You know,

2389
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:15,643
like,

2390
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:18,900
like fighting black house.

2391
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:19,090
No,

2392
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:19,451
he was like,

2393
01:06:19,451 --> 01:06:20,160
they're just the,

2394
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:20,411
you know,

2395
01:06:20,411 --> 01:06:20,591
like,

2396
01:06:20,591 --> 01:06:21,400
he's like a,

2397
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,260
he was talking about Floyd
and he was just like,

2398
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:24,080
you know,

2399
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:24,913
um,

2400
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,253
technically,

2401
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:27,460
um,

2402
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:31,120
just had fantastic puncher
like Floyd Mayweather,

2403
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:31,990
just everything perfect.

2404
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:32,770
Perfect.

2405
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:36,250
But on top of that has out of control,

2406
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:38,950
reflexes skills and providing skills.

2407
01:06:38,951 --> 01:06:41,200
And he fence trained perfectly.

2408
01:06:41,201 --> 01:06:41,441
I mean,

2409
01:06:41,441 --> 01:06:43,570
his brother Roger,

2410
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:44,493
you know,

2411
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:46,060
Roger,

2412
01:06:46,060 --> 01:06:46,571
Roger May,

2413
01:06:46,571 --> 01:06:48,870
whether it was a fantastic boxer,

2414
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,830
his dad was a good box.

2415
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:52,210
Talk about Victoria teas.

2416
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:55,180
That was the best sound bite ever from 24,

2417
01:06:55,181 --> 01:06:55,840
seven.

2418
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,220
That thing was so ridiculous,

2419
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:57,850
that fight,

2420
01:06:57,850 --> 01:06:59,140
that fight was so ridiculous.

2421
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:00,580
He sucker punch that dude.

2422
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:02,410
Guys look at the referee and he's like,

2423
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:02,651
bitch,

2424
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:04,360
we still fight and correct.

2425
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:06,850
Blam weird of Ortiz though,

2426
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:07,860
too silly.

2427
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:08,681
So,

2428
01:07:08,681 --> 01:07:10,840
and then he kind of gave it up,

2429
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:12,340
but then like we talked about,

2430
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:12,510
um,

2431
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:13,230
what's his name?

2432
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:13,450
Uh,

2433
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,860
I liked the way Victoria t's fights on,

2434
01:07:14,861 --> 01:07:15,011
man,

2435
01:07:15,011 --> 01:07:15,641
that guy's crazy.

2436
01:07:15,641 --> 01:07:15,851
Yeah,

2437
01:07:15,851 --> 01:07:16,520
he's a tough guy.

2438
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,230
Just messed up.

2439
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:18,310
He just made an error.

2440
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:20,591
What's the Filipino?

2441
01:07:20,591 --> 01:07:21,670
I can't even think right now.

2442
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:23,013
Uh,

2443
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:23,710
you know,

2444
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:26,490
so who's the many backyard pack?

2445
01:07:26,491 --> 01:07:27,070
Yeah.

2446
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:27,490
Um,

2447
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:27,880
I would like,

2448
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,230
you call it the Filipino,

2449
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:29,950
uh,

2450
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:31,450
one of the greatest boxers in the history.

2451
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:34,600
Maybe the greatest accomplishment,

2452
01:07:34,601 --> 01:07:35,081
but he,

2453
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:35,780
you know,

2454
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:37,390
like he leaves the ground like,

2455
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:38,360
Oh yes.

2456
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,060
Rose's legs and his punches.

2457
01:07:40,061 --> 01:07:41,380
Fucking powerful.

2458
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:42,010
Ooh,

2459
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:42,850
he hits so hard.

2460
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:44,500
A lot of his power comes from his legs.

2461
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,030
He's a powerful dude.

2462
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:46,771
Manny packer.

2463
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:48,940
I was a fucking murderous puncher.

2464
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:49,381
He,

2465
01:07:49,381 --> 01:07:49,751
he,

2466
01:07:49,751 --> 01:07:50,381
when he fought,

2467
01:07:50,381 --> 01:07:51,190
um,

2468
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:52,090
what the fuck's his name?

2469
01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:53,020
Um,

2470
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:54,880

2471
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,220

2472
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:57,701
Yeah.

2473
01:07:57,701 --> 01:07:58,534
Antonio,

2474
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,930
the guy who was disgraced for
use plaster and his knuckles.

2475
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:02,440
Yeah.

2476
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:02,830
Yeah.

2477
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:03,071
Boy,

2478
01:08:03,071 --> 01:08:04,120
he paid that price.

2479
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:04,870
Karmic Karmically,

2480
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:09,540
he paid that price man cause Paki I'll
beat his fucking eyes and he beat his eye

2481
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:12,880
so bad they had to replace the Lens
in his eye with an artificial lens.

2482
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:13,750
Oh my God.

2483
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:14,300
Yeah.

2484
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:14,970
Have fight again.

2485
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:15,360
Yup,

2486
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:15,650
man.

2487
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:16,191
Fuck yeah,

2488
01:08:16,191 --> 01:08:16,700
he did.

2489
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,061
Yeah,

2490
01:08:17,061 --> 01:08:18,080
he got back in there.

2491
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:19,550
Jesus Christ.

2492
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,360
We got back in there and fought Miguel
Cotto and Miguel Cotto was one of the

2493
01:08:23,361 --> 01:08:27,950
guys who he beat or they suspected they
did something to his gloves because he's

2494
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:28,970
fucked a dude up.

2495
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:32,720
Like murderously fucked him up and he
never really did that with anybody.

2496
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:35,420
Like he was just knocking
motherfuckers out cold.

2497
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:36,560
Cadeau no.

2498
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:40,060
Now Margarita before they found the
plaster in his gloves because he did it to

2499
01:08:40,061 --> 01:08:40,521
Cota though,

2500
01:08:40,521 --> 01:08:40,890
right?

2501
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:41,350
Yeah,

2502
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:42,183
he did.

2503
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:43,250
He did the first time,

2504
01:08:43,251 --> 01:08:44,720
but the second time Codo stopped him.

2505
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:46,431
But it was a,

2506
01:08:46,431 --> 01:08:48,620
I think it was like a cut or
some shit that stopped him,

2507
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:50,390
but Margarito uh,

2508
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:50,961
couldn't,

2509
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:53,330
couldn't really hit as hard after
they caught him with the plaster.

2510
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:57,860
That was scary shit to think that
a guy was like making his career.

2511
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:00,260
He put rocks in his gloves put up.

2512
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:01,850
I mean dickhead.

2513
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:02,773
Yeah,

2514
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:04,910
he's not,

2515
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:06,230
he's totally cheating.

2516
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:07,190
Yeah.

2517
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:12,190
And getting away with it and giving you
like definitely fucking more aggravated

2518
01:09:13,071 --> 01:09:14,690
brain damage than you would be getting.

2519
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:15,290
You know what I mean?

2520
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:17,630
He's hitting you with
fucking casts and your faith.

2521
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:18,530
Yeah.

2522
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:21,230
Like that's really shaking
up the inside of your head.

2523
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:23,120
There was a fight during the,

2524
01:09:23,121 --> 01:09:27,710
I think it was the 80s
where a guy had pulled,

2525
01:09:27,711 --> 01:09:28,191
Panama,

2526
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:31,520
Lewis had pulled the stuffing out
of a guy's and I remember that.

2527
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:32,630
And it was this kid,

2528
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:36,110
I believe the kid's name was Louie Resto,

2529
01:09:36,111 --> 01:09:36,890
the boxer.

2530
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:38,960
And then the other one was Billy Collins.

2531
01:09:38,961 --> 01:09:39,651
I think it was,

2532
01:09:39,651 --> 01:09:40,071
I forget,

2533
01:09:40,071 --> 01:09:41,570
I forget what the guy's name was,

2534
01:09:41,870 --> 01:09:44,770
but the poor kid had like
ended his career and the the,

2535
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:46,670
cause he just got bare knuckle the dice.

2536
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:46,890
Yeah.

2537
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:48,770
Well he crashed into a tree.

2538
01:09:48,771 --> 01:09:50,150
They think he committed suicide.

2539
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:51,260
And the guy,

2540
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,210
Panama Red was,

2541
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:53,660
uh,

2542
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:54,950
Panama Lewis Lewis was,

2543
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:55,370
uh,

2544
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:55,730
was,

2545
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:58,460
was suspended like years.

2546
01:09:58,820 --> 01:09:59,653
The fighter,

2547
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:01,070
I don't think he ever fought again.

2548
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:06,340
And he denied any wrongdoing
until a few years ago.

2549
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,260
And he,

2550
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:09,890
he gave it up on camera.

2551
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:10,911
Really?

2552
01:10:10,911 --> 01:10:11,480
Yeah.

2553
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:11,780
Yeah.

2554
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:12,613
The boxer,

2555
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:16,130
which fight about the fight
that you're talking about.

2556
01:10:16,131 --> 01:10:17,840
What they found that right away though.

2557
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:18,840
But the box,

2558
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,400
the guy that was guilty
of like the guy who,

2559
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:22,670
who Panama was training.

2560
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:22,941
Yeah.

2561
01:10:22,941 --> 01:10:24,230
I believe it was Louie Resto.

2562
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:24,750
He,

2563
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:25,850
he denied it and was like,

2564
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:26,420
I didn't,

2565
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:27,400
he didn't know that.

2566
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:29,220
He didn't know exactly
like it was an accident.

2567
01:10:29,221 --> 01:10:31,580
And so that's silly and you would
fail the first punch you through.

2568
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:33,590
His family always had his back.

2569
01:10:33,591 --> 01:10:34,310
Like they were like,

2570
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:34,790
you know,

2571
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:35,241
it wasn't,

2572
01:10:35,241 --> 01:10:35,961
it wasn't on him.

2573
01:10:35,961 --> 01:10:38,570
And then on camera with his family there,

2574
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:38,991
he was like,

2575
01:10:38,991 --> 01:10:39,201
no,

2576
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:40,034
I know what I did.

2577
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:40,540
Oh,

2578
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,020
they're just devastated.

2579
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:42,710
Yeah.

2580
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:43,461
That's a terrible,

2581
01:10:43,461 --> 01:10:43,911
terrible,

2582
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:45,080
terrible thing to live with,

2583
01:10:45,081 --> 01:10:45,351
man.

2584
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:46,430
That's not just cheating.

2585
01:10:46,431 --> 01:10:46,970
That's like,

2586
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:47,390
ugh.

2587
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:48,590
That's horrific man.

2588
01:10:48,591 --> 01:10:49,401
You basically,

2589
01:10:49,401 --> 01:10:49,850
you know,

2590
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:50,840
you ruined the guys life.

2591
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:51,170
Yeah,

2592
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:51,430
you did.

2593
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:52,340
It ruined the guys life.

2594
01:10:52,341 --> 01:10:56,120
A guy who was really good at competing
under a set of rules and you just fucking

2595
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:58,610
totally hijacked the whole thing on TV.

2596
01:10:58,611 --> 01:11:00,800
You stupid fuck on TV.

2597
01:11:00,801 --> 01:11:01,850
Beat a guy up with no,

2598
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:03,050
no padding and your gloves.

2599
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:06,530
So you just bare knuckle
cranes and you cheated.

2600
01:11:06,531 --> 01:11:07,720
You cheat and asshole.

2601
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:12,880
Isn't it crazy that you still get all
these guys every single year in every

2602
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,130
sport that

2603
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,900
all still cheat.

2604
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:17,293
And you know the

2605
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:17,930
big slate,

2606
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:18,481
they took some,

2607
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:19,410
I forget some,

2608
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,880
somebody metal was,

2609
01:11:20,881 --> 01:11:21,210
you know,

2610
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:23,160
one guy had marijuana in his system.

2611
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:23,970
Oh really?

2612
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:24,331
Yeah.

2613
01:11:24,331 --> 01:11:26,640
The motherfucker had
weighed in the system.

2614
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:26,910
Yeah.

2615
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:28,530
Some ski or some Shit.

2616
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:28,880
Ah,

2617
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:29,371
that's not,

2618
01:11:29,371 --> 01:11:29,670
well,

2619
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:30,151
let's get your eye.

2620
01:11:30,151 --> 01:11:33,560
Can See someone who got kicked
off the team for weed was a judo.

2621
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:34,403
There was a judo guy,

2622
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:35,341
was a judo guy,

2623
01:11:35,341 --> 01:11:37,720
got kicked off [inaudible] shit.

2624
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:38,491
You're like,

2625
01:11:38,491 --> 01:11:39,690
how are you still like,

2626
01:11:39,691 --> 01:11:40,141

2628
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:41,790
man.

2629
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:45,510
There's a lot of different
shit that people are doing
that they've got away with

2630
01:11:45,511 --> 01:11:46,111
in the past,

2631
01:11:46,111 --> 01:11:46,501
I think.

2632
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:50,560
And they're slowly starting to clamp
down on that thing and fucking Armstrong.

2633
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:50,790
Well,

2634
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:51,710
this isn't,

2635
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:52,231
well,

2636
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:57,231
the crazy thing about Armstrong
is he's only done by this one.

2637
01:11:57,391 --> 01:12:01,730
Like it's an American thing
that's gone after night.

2638
01:12:01,731 --> 01:12:04,260
It states anti-doping and it was fucking,

2639
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,290
but that has nothing to do
with the Tour de France.

2640
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,020
So when they say that he doesn't have the,

2641
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:10,291
uh,

2642
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:11,760
the eight toward the France,

2643
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:13,140
notice how I say France?

2644
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:13,810
Yes.

2645
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:14,790
Sophisticated.

2646
01:12:14,791 --> 01:12:19,791
I've been to the airport in Patti
Sharp Balto what they're saying that

2647
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:22,470
jurisdiction they do.

2648
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,240
I thought so because I mean,

2649
01:12:24,241 --> 01:12:25,320
everything that I saw was,

2650
01:12:25,321 --> 01:12:30,270
he was stripped of his title is I heard
that he was stripped by these people,

2651
01:12:30,271 --> 01:12:31,470
that they don't recognize it,

2652
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:34,560
but I don't know if he's
necessarily stripped by the,

2653
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:34,920
the,

2654
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:39,180
whoever the fuck puts on the Tour de
France definitely did what they said he

2655
01:12:39,181 --> 01:12:39,420
did.

2656
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:41,830
You think so look up guns.

2657
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:43,660
Hundred percent.

2658
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:46,930
I do not believe in these witch hunts for,

2659
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,050
for like people that are essentially,

2660
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:50,890
uh,

2661
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:54,160
like heroes and super like nobody accuses,

2662
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:54,700
um,

2663
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:55,120
you know,

2664
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,950
Michael Jordan of having done this.

2665
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:57,461
Nobody.

2666
01:12:57,461 --> 01:12:58,600
A clique accuses,

2667
01:12:58,890 --> 01:12:59,410
um,

2668
01:12:59,410 --> 01:12:59,861
you know,

2669
01:12:59,861 --> 01:13:01,600
Joe Montana of having done this.

2670
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,460
They do it because it's there.

2671
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,680
His teammates have all come,

2672
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:06,970
come clean about it.

2673
01:13:06,971 --> 01:13:07,481
They've also,

2674
01:13:07,481 --> 01:13:08,530
we all did this shit,

2675
01:13:08,770 --> 01:13:09,311
everybody.

2676
01:13:09,311 --> 01:13:11,110
And then when you
finally have your chance,

2677
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,690
you finally have your chance to be like,

2678
01:13:13,691 --> 01:13:14,291
this is the last.

2679
01:13:14,291 --> 01:13:14,591
He's like,

2680
01:13:14,591 --> 01:13:15,310
you know what?

2681
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:16,330
Enough's enough.

2682
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:17,110
Really,

2683
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:17,980
enough's enough.

2684
01:13:18,190 --> 01:13:19,000
That's the,

2685
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,590
I'm just tired of fighting this fight.

2686
01:13:20,591 --> 01:13:20,741
Well,

2687
01:13:20,741 --> 01:13:21,910
you have a chance now.

2688
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,001
This is your fine.

2689
01:13:23,001 --> 01:13:23,351
This is the,

2690
01:13:23,351 --> 01:13:25,220
like the final lap of the,

2691
01:13:25,221 --> 01:13:26,054
of the race.

2692
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:27,370
This is when you go,

2693
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:28,211
I'm just,

2694
01:13:28,211 --> 01:13:29,890
you know what man?

2695
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:30,933
At some point,

2696
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,770
well he's been in his defense,

2697
01:13:32,771 --> 01:13:34,530
he's been defending it for years.

2698
01:13:34,531 --> 01:13:37,120
But you give up and let
them take your name.

2699
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:37,960
And while you're doing,

2700
01:13:37,961 --> 01:13:39,280
know that he has passed,

2701
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:40,750
and I'm just playing
devil's advocate here,

2702
01:13:40,751 --> 01:13:43,490
but do you know that
he's past like 500 drugs?

2703
01:13:43,491 --> 01:13:43,870
Yes,

2704
01:13:43,870 --> 01:13:44,430
I do.

2705
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:45,040
I do.

2706
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:45,873
But why?

2707
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:48,520
Why is there a witch hunt
to get somebody like that?

2708
01:13:48,521 --> 01:13:48,940
I don't,

2709
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:49,300
I don't,

2710
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,133
I don't lose,

2711
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:50,980
this is what,

2712
01:13:51,070 --> 01:13:51,940
what gets me,

2713
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,190
you ever see a dude is like
killed his wife and he's on the,

2714
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:57,700
he's on the news and
they're a accusing him of,

2715
01:13:57,701 --> 01:13:58,534
uh,

2716
01:13:58,750 --> 01:13:59,021
of,

2717
01:13:59,021 --> 01:13:59,291
you know,

2718
01:13:59,291 --> 01:13:59,480
like,

2719
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,101
why'd you do it?

2720
01:14:00,101 --> 01:14:00,730
Why'd you do it?

2721
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:01,900
And it was like I didn't,

2722
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:02,823
didn't do anything.

2723
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:03,311
And you're like,

2724
01:14:03,311 --> 01:14:06,280
that is not how you would react if your
wife was killed and they were dragging

2725
01:14:06,281 --> 01:14:07,840
you off and you were innocent.

2726
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,490
You would be freaking the fuck out.

2727
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,900
Like what?

2728
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:12,340
You lost your loved one.

2729
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:13,930
You're a crazy person.

2730
01:14:13,931 --> 01:14:15,910
You're a crazy person that
they caught doing something.

2731
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:16,840
Yeah.

2732
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,500
Um,

2733
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,220
so,

2734
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:22,630
but like you think that they
would go after him though if he,

2735
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:24,790
if there wasn't any
evidence to support that.

2736
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:26,441
I don't know.

2737
01:14:26,441 --> 01:14:26,681
Like,

2738
01:14:26,681 --> 01:14:27,514
like how,

2739
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:27,700
no,

2740
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:28,211
I'm saying like,

2741
01:14:28,211 --> 01:14:29,560
do you like for Lance,

2742
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:30,430
right?

2743
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:32,170
I mean I don't know what they can do.

2744
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:34,510
I mean I think once he's
passed the drug test,

2745
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:36,900
he passed like 500 fucking drug test.

2746
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:38,891
But here's the thing,

2747
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:39,820
where's the evidence?

2748
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:40,601
What do you have?

2749
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:43,660
Do you have any of his blood and you can
run it through a machine and find some

2750
01:14:43,661 --> 01:14:45,010
shit that we didn't find before.

2751
01:14:45,011 --> 01:14:47,410
Is that if you don't have
that then what are you doing?

2752
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:48,430
I think they do have a,

2753
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:49,960
have they do have that.

2754
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:50,690
That would be no,

2755
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:52,210
they would have said they had that.

2756
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,590
If they do have that,

2757
01:14:53,591 --> 01:14:55,090
they would have put that shit on the news.

2758
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,230
They would tell you what it is.

2759
01:14:56,231 --> 01:14:57,580
It's not something that
you can keep a secret.

2760
01:14:57,581 --> 01:14:58,510
They have some sample,

2761
01:14:58,511 --> 01:15:02,110
cause some sample was referenced with
some sample reference because he tested

2762
01:15:02,111 --> 01:15:03,400
positive for EPO.

2763
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:04,031
Was it that,

2764
01:15:04,031 --> 01:15:06,300
I feel like you got tested
positive or something,

2765
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:08,170
but whatever the fuck it is,

2766
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:08,771
you would,

2767
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:13,420
you should have either got him back then
or you need to let it go and realize

2768
01:15:13,421 --> 01:15:16,430
that now with your new super
sophisticated methods of,

2769
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:17,423
of testing,

2770
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,300
he might not pass those tests before.

2771
01:15:19,301 --> 01:15:21,910
But guess what he did
let's fucking move on.

2772
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:22,330
Yeah.

2773
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:22,541
Well,

2774
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:22,871
you know,

2775
01:15:22,871 --> 01:15:23,860
leave the guy alone.

2776
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:24,050
I mean,

2777
01:15:24,050 --> 01:15:27,370
you're going to ruin his life because
he did exactly what everybody else did.

2778
01:15:27,371 --> 01:15:28,690
He just was better at it.

2779
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:30,130
Cause that's what happened.

2780
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:30,311
So,

2781
01:15:30,311 --> 01:15:32,200
but around you gotta be,

2782
01:15:32,201 --> 01:15:34,700
you have to assume that
he's a real motherfucker.

2783
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:35,590
But here's my question.

2784
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:36,520
Why did they,

2785
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:39,160
why does he have to tell
anybody that he was,

2786
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:40,690
if they were all doping?

2787
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,350
Okay.

2788
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:43,030
And that's what we're
assuming that's the case.

2789
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:45,310
We're assuming that everyone
at the top of the list,

2790
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:45,791
and by the way,

2791
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,180
a lot of the doping does not
necessarily even have to be unhealthy.

2792
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:51,070
Like the blood transfusions.

2793
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:52,030
That's not unhealthy.

2794
01:15:52,031 --> 01:15:53,470
Blood doping is not unhealthy.

2795
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,970
It just is an unknown,

2796
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:58,180
an inordinate amount
of blood in your body.

2797
01:15:58,210 --> 01:16:01,570
You have a much more easy
way of producing oxygen.

2798
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,471
You A,

2799
01:16:02,471 --> 01:16:03,880
you can process oxygen better.

2800
01:16:03,881 --> 01:16:06,670
That's why being dehydrated
it's so bad for your cardio.

2801
01:16:07,010 --> 01:16:08,890
It's like one of the most
important things for,

2802
01:16:08,891 --> 01:16:09,490
you know,

2803
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:10,840
outdoor exercise.

2804
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,131
Well that was,

2805
01:16:12,131 --> 01:16:12,964
um,

2806
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:13,721
I think,

2807
01:16:13,721 --> 01:16:13,931
uh,

2808
01:16:13,931 --> 01:16:16,150
that was a fuck.

2809
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:16,690
How would it,

2810
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:17,800
how would they describe it?

2811
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:20,741
It's,

2812
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:21,574
um,

2813
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:22,600
I,

2814
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:27,190
I just don't think any of them can
achieve the highest level without doing at

2815
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:27,910
least some of that.

2816
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:29,290
If it's not blood doping,

2817
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,300
if it's not taken EPO,

2818
01:16:31,301 --> 01:16:32,680
if it's not taking,

2819
01:16:32,681 --> 01:16:33,011
you know,

2820
01:16:33,011 --> 01:16:37,360
some fucking routes that boost your
testosterone that are illegal today but

2821
01:16:37,361 --> 01:16:39,040
won't be legal in six months from now.

2822
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:40,240
When they find out about it,

2823
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:41,950
there's a,

2824
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:46,180
it seems like if everybody is doing
it at the very top of the list,

2825
01:16:46,181 --> 01:16:48,400
if the all those guys
on his team got busted,

2826
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:51,400
I can only make sense
that he could do it too.

2827
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:53,320
I just think that for me,

2828
01:16:53,321 --> 01:16:54,490
the assumption that I make,

2829
01:16:54,491 --> 01:16:58,870
and I again I realized that I'm not
privy to any of the like evidence or

2830
01:16:58,871 --> 01:16:59,680
information,

2831
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:02,800
but the assumption that I make is
if all these guys say he did it,

2832
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:05,650
that he worked with all
his former teammates.

2833
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:07,270
Do they just associates?

2834
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:09,740
Everybody says that and then the,

2835
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:10,131
the,

2836
01:17:10,131 --> 01:17:11,150
the doping organism.

2837
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,210
Our agency is so adamant
about pursuing it.

2838
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:15,110
Like what?

2839
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:15,920
Why?

2840
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,050
Why would you do this if
there's nothing there,

2841
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:21,710
why are you trying to get the like
Pete generally that doesn't happen.

2842
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:24,980
People don't go after
somebody just because,

2843
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:29,420
do you think that's because
like prosecutors sorta get
a wild hair across their

2844
01:17:29,421 --> 01:17:29,750
ass.

2845
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:29,991
They're like,

2846
01:17:29,991 --> 01:17:32,270
we're going to go get this guy and
then it becomes like a competition.

2847
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:33,104
They could be it.

2848
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,340
That's definitely possible.

2849
01:17:34,341 --> 01:17:34,761
And they get,

2850
01:17:34,761 --> 01:17:35,031
they get,

2851
01:17:35,031 --> 01:17:35,480
you know,

2852
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:35,900
they,

2853
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:40,280
that that obviously happened like in
that Duke Lacrosse case where the,

2854
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:40,731
the,

2855
01:17:40,731 --> 01:17:40,941
uh,

2856
01:17:40,941 --> 01:17:42,320
the prosecutor there was like,

2857
01:17:42,321 --> 01:17:44,120
he made a fucking show of it.

2858
01:17:44,121 --> 01:17:47,750
Like we're going to before
even like reviewing a what,

2859
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:52,370
like the information and the evidence
and then he paid a huge price because he

2860
01:17:52,371 --> 01:17:56,750
was boasting and trashing them before
they even got in a courtroom and ended up

2861
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:58,760
fucking losing his license to practice.

2862
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:00,050
But I think part of that,

2863
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:01,790
what he did before was from that charge,

2864
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:03,080
he got of like,

2865
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:04,070
I'm going to put these,

2866
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:06,380
these rich entitled kids,

2867
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,220
uh,

2868
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,270
fucking in their place,

2869
01:18:08,271 --> 01:18:09,320
watch this right now.

2870
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:11,030
And then it came back to bite them.

2871
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:11,481
So yeah,

2872
01:18:11,481 --> 01:18:14,540
I think there is partly for some of
that people going after the big name,

2873
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:15,500
but I just don't see,

2874
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:20,000
I don't see them trying to
do this to him for no reason.

2875
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:20,810
I just don't see,

2876
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:21,650
I agree with you,

2877
01:18:21,651 --> 01:18:25,520
but I don't know what the reasons are if
I felt like if the guy passed that many

2878
01:18:25,521 --> 01:18:26,360
drug tests.

2879
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:26,850
Yeah.

2880
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:29,660
I mean if and if everybody
was doing what he was doing,

2881
01:18:29,661 --> 01:18:30,560
if that's what they're saying,

2882
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:31,760
what's he just,

2883
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:36,320
was he just better in spite of the
doping was everybody was doping.

2884
01:18:36,321 --> 01:18:37,400
If he's the best,

2885
01:18:37,401 --> 01:18:37,850
he's the,

2886
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:39,700
he's a super talented actor.

2887
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:41,570
Clearly he's unbelievably disciplined.

2888
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:43,550
So if you're telling me they all doped.

2889
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:44,060
Yeah.

2890
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:44,521
Is that,

2891
01:18:44,521 --> 01:18:46,190
isn't that not a level playing field?

2892
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,750
It's like the baseball argument.

2893
01:18:47,751 --> 01:18:50,690
They're saying this is like
the asterick whatever era.

2894
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:51,040
Yeah,

2895
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:55,040
because like at first it was like a few
guys and then a few more and then you're

2896
01:18:55,041 --> 01:18:55,221
like,

2897
01:18:55,221 --> 01:18:56,000
hold on,

2898
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,290
did everybody just juice for like this
five or 10 year period and it's looking

2899
01:19:00,291 --> 01:19:03,770
like a huge percentage where
it's not even news anymore.

2900
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:04,130
Right.

2901
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:05,480
When you find out that like all the,

2902
01:19:05,481 --> 01:19:05,961
all the big,

2903
01:19:05,961 --> 01:19:07,280
all the big superstars did it,

2904
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:08,143
you know,

2905
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:08,710
all of them.

2906
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:09,170
It's crazy.

2907
01:19:09,170 --> 01:19:11,510
All the home run records
were broken in that era.

2908
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:15,440
When you look at Mark McGuire now and
we hear him talk about it and you hear

2909
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:15,670
him,

2910
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:18,980
you know he just like broke down
when he was describing what he did.

2911
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:22,040
He look at the best is
when you see like a,

2912
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:23,090
when he was like an Oakland,

2913
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:26,330
a bash brothers era and
you see him and he's like,

2914
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:26,540
you know,

2915
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:30,470
he's like six [inaudible] four and he
looks like a fucking pencil to that.

2916
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:31,580
Did a TV show with him.

2917
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:32,180
Did you really?

2918
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:35,690
He was an on an episode of Hardball
Faculty of These Really Skinny Man.

2919
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:37,053
He was young.

2920
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,870
This is the pre HGH days.

2921
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,020
He turned into a Gore Raila.

2922
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:43,070
He just went crazy with that working out.

2923
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:43,380
But,

2924
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:44,750
but look at the dividends man.

2925
01:19:44,751 --> 01:19:48,350
All of a sudden he's just
playing over rising balls.

2926
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,930
But bonds too.

2927
01:19:50,931 --> 01:19:53,030
When you see [inaudible] Aiko higher.

2928
01:19:53,031 --> 01:19:56,330
It's uniform and is a giant shit.

2929
01:19:56,331 --> 01:19:57,620
It's fucking big.

2930
01:19:57,630 --> 01:19:58,520
Conseco was,

2931
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:58,701
yeah,

2932
01:19:58,701 --> 01:19:59,810
he's a monster suit.

2933
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:00,710
I was walking,

2934
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:04,970
I was working rather in the
Boston athletic club and I
was 19 and Conseco was in

2935
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:08,100
town and he needed somewhere to work out
and they must have been staying close

2936
01:20:08,101 --> 01:20:09,290
to the Boston athletic clubs.

2937
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,940
They came down and worked out and
that guy walked through the door.

2938
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:12,400
I was like,

2939
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,030
Jesus Christ,

2940
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:17,730
like on TV with their
silly 1860s outfits on.

2941
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,500
They don't look that big.

2942
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:20,820
But when that guy walked in the,

2943
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:21,091
I'm like,

2944
01:20:21,091 --> 01:20:22,620
he's like 300 pounds.

2945
01:20:22,621 --> 01:20:24,450
He's fucking huge.

2946
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,670
I mean he might not have
been 300 but he was like,

2947
01:20:26,671 --> 01:20:29,010
well over two 50 he was enormous.

2948
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:30,010
The,

2949
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:32,140
I remember the first time when I was like,

2950
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:37,170
holy shit at the size of
some like fucking humans was,

2951
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:41,950
I was in high school and I played in
high school football like two hours north

2952
01:20:41,951 --> 01:20:42,784
of Miami.

2953
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:48,030
I went with a friend of mine on like a
recruiting trip with his trip down to the

2954
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:52,420
University of Miami and we're standing
on the field and the players were run out

2955
01:20:52,421 --> 01:20:55,660
of the tunnel and I'm looking
at dudes in their chest,

2956
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:58,030
like I'm standing there looking
at the numbers and I'm like,

2957
01:20:58,330 --> 01:20:59,530
holy fuck,

2958
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,270
I could never play.

2959
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:02,530
It's guys like this,

2960
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:05,200
like dudes that were like six six,

2961
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:07,030
three 30 and I was like,

2962
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,150
these are fucking animals running around,

2963
01:21:10,151 --> 01:21:10,410
man.

2964
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:13,410
Did people like that
exist a hundred years ago?

2965
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:14,550
I don't think so.

2966
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:18,360
The one of the reasons why I think they
might have like every now and then there

2967
01:21:18,361 --> 01:21:19,320
was a guy that was the,

2968
01:21:19,321 --> 01:21:20,490
the heavyweight champion.

2969
01:21:20,491 --> 01:21:24,330
His name was Primo Carnera and
it was all like legit giant.

2970
01:21:24,331 --> 01:21:26,520
He was fucking enormous.

2971
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:29,880
But like the best guys me see how
big Primo coordinator narrow was.

2972
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:32,940
I think he was the biggest
heavyweight champion ever.

2973
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:36,180
I think up until like at
least like modern times.

2974
01:21:36,181 --> 01:21:40,950
Cause I think there was some fucking
giant Russian dude recently that was even

2975
01:21:40,951 --> 01:21:41,784
bigger than that.

2976
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:43,831
But,

2977
01:21:43,831 --> 01:21:44,460
uh,

2978
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:48,180
I think this guy lived in like the,

2979
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:51,390
the fifties I believe it was.

2980
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:52,253
Yeah,

2981
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:55,620
he lived until 1967

2982
01:21:57,310 --> 01:22:00,580
so he was a seven foot one.

2983
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:01,563
Oh my God.

2984
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:03,693
Oh my God.

2985
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:04,271
Oh No,

2986
01:22:04,271 --> 01:22:04,511
no,

2987
01:22:04,511 --> 01:22:04,721
no,

2988
01:22:04,721 --> 01:22:04,931
no,

2989
01:22:04,931 --> 01:22:05,111
no.

2990
01:22:05,111 --> 01:22:05,770
Okay.

2991
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:06,320
Now this guy,

2992
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,510
six foot seven,

2993
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:10,660
the Russian guy that I was
talking about is seven foot one.

2994
01:22:12,770 --> 01:22:14,300
His name is Nikolai value of,

2995
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:15,680
he's seven foot one.

2996
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:17,150
Holy Shit.

2997
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:20,240
So these guys were giants back then,

2998
01:22:20,241 --> 01:22:23,210
but Carnera was only a six foot seven.

2999
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:25,080
That's still a big motherfucker.

3000
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:25,760
Yeah,

3001
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:26,593
Jesus.

3002
01:22:27,170 --> 01:22:27,411
Yeah.

3003
01:22:27,411 --> 01:22:29,780
Up until that time he was the
tallest heavyweight in history.

3004
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:34,490
And I think today like what are
the Klitschkos they're like six,

3005
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:35,160
six,

3006
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:35,910
yeah,

3007
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,360
same size and dude's,

3008
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:37,731
yeah,

3009
01:22:37,731 --> 01:22:38,570
they like the same size.

3010
01:22:38,571 --> 01:22:39,680
So this is Primo Carnera,

3011
01:22:39,681 --> 01:22:43,340
but back then he was like a like a freak.

3012
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:44,323
Yeah,

3013
01:22:45,770 --> 01:22:46,161
I did.

3014
01:22:46,161 --> 01:22:46,994
Um,

3015
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:47,540
what was it?

3016
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:48,210
I did a,

3017
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:49,130
this fundraiser,

3018
01:22:49,180 --> 01:22:50,770
he was 275 pounds.

3019
01:22:50,771 --> 01:22:51,530
This guy was

3020
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:52,460
naturally and he,

3021
01:22:52,461 --> 01:22:52,821
and he,

3022
01:22:52,821 --> 01:22:53,570
uh,

3023
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:53,841
that,

3024
01:22:53,841 --> 01:22:54,561
that was like,

3025
01:22:54,561 --> 01:22:55,394
by the way,

3026
01:22:55,940 --> 01:22:59,720
the biggest size of any athlete?

3027
01:22:59,830 --> 01:23:00,200
Yeah.

3028
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,180
Through like the like in the 80s,

3029
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:06,070
like I remember that
like Lineman in the were

3030
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:11,070
two 75 to 80 and in every team would have
like a 300 pounder and you'd be like,

3031
01:23:11,711 --> 01:23:12,520
Holy Shit,

3032
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:16,390
they got a 300 pound on the
team and now the entire line,

3033
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,620
what the fuck is that?

3034
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,090
Is that human growth hormone?

3035
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:19,961
What is that?

3036
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:21,670
Is that steroids in the beef?

3037
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:22,950
It sounds,

3038
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:23,771
is that what that is?

3039
01:23:23,771 --> 01:23:24,670
It's standard now.

3040
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,560
Everyone's is three 2130.

3041
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,480
What's happening is
it's selective growing.

3042
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:30,143
What is it?

3043
01:23:30,490 --> 01:23:31,323
Cellphones.

3044
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:31,931
Is it,

3045
01:23:31,931 --> 01:23:35,680
this is the first couple of generations
we were really understood nutrition and

3046
01:23:35,681 --> 01:23:38,320
made sure the kids have vitamins
growing up and they grew to their full

3047
01:23:38,321 --> 01:23:38,861
potential.

3048
01:23:38,861 --> 01:23:39,431
Is that what it is?

3049
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:40,264
Part of it is that,

3050
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:41,470
I bet that has to do a lot with it,

3051
01:23:41,471 --> 01:23:41,671
right?

3052
01:23:41,671 --> 01:23:41,800
Yeah.

3053
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:42,760
I think that is part of it.

3054
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:43,300
Yeah.

3055
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,430
And also put,

3056
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,230
now you have this thing
where it's like you're,

3057
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:50,440
they are con like there's
more education on just,

3058
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:51,370
you know,

3059
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:53,140
like for instance in sports everybody has,

3060
01:23:53,141 --> 01:23:54,310
like you can be like,

3061
01:23:54,311 --> 01:23:54,491
Hey,

3062
01:23:54,491 --> 01:23:57,820
I want to be this weight
and you're going to program,

3063
01:23:58,030 --> 01:24:02,200
you need fucking 300 grams of protein
a day and you need 5,000 calories.

3064
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:02,570
Yeah.

3065
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:05,500
You need to do this type of workout
and you're going to fucking swell up.

3066
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:06,070
You know,

3067
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:10,300
you can actually set that
goal and somebody can tell
you pretty much manufacture

3068
01:24:10,301 --> 01:24:10,421
it.

3069
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:12,130
Like in knowing their,

3070
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,090
their science,

3071
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:14,260
this is what you need to do too.

3072
01:24:14,261 --> 01:24:16,420
If you want to obtain that
so you can execute that,

3073
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:17,230
you know,

3074
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:18,440
but back then they'd just be like,

3075
01:24:18,441 --> 01:24:18,731
oh fuck.

3076
01:24:18,731 --> 01:24:19,420
And I don't know.

3077
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:19,811
Yeah,

3078
01:24:19,811 --> 01:24:20,660
there's definitely that.

3079
01:24:20,661 --> 01:24:23,500
Like you definitely put on
more size now than ever before.

3080
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:24,430
But what,

3081
01:24:24,430 --> 01:24:29,200
what I'm saying is that the actual
number of giant humans has increased.

3082
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,590
It's not just like the
ability to put muscle on,

3083
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,810
it's like the size of people is just,

3084
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:39,700
it's more common to see these Primo
Carnera guys in athletics today,

3085
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:43,360
these six foot seven just
naturally gigantic human beings.

3086
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:44,500
Like that's,

3087
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:45,760
that's more common today.

3088
01:24:45,790 --> 01:24:46,450
It just is.

3089
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:47,500
So what the fuck is that?

3090
01:24:47,501 --> 01:24:48,520
Why is it more common?

3091
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:53,040
Why is there two Klitschkos there's
two giant six foot six guys or box and

3092
01:24:53,041 --> 01:24:55,120
everybody up these two
giant Russian dudes,

3093
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:55,801
you know,

3094
01:24:55,801 --> 01:24:58,020
and just think about how many
of those guys exist today?

3095
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:58,511
How many,

3096
01:24:58,511 --> 01:25:00,340
how many giant human beings are out there?

3097
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:01,171
There's a dude,

3098
01:25:01,171 --> 01:25:01,660
um,

3099
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,530
who fights in the UFC?

3100
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:03,071
Stephan drew,

3101
01:25:03,071 --> 01:25:04,600
if he's fucking seven feet tall,

3102
01:25:04,601 --> 01:25:05,434
man.

3103
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:06,670
Kids seven feet.

3104
01:25:06,690 --> 01:25:06,870
Yeah.

3105
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:07,061
Yeah.

3106
01:25:07,061 --> 01:25:08,170
I don't even think he's 25,

3107
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,220
seven feet tall.

3108
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:12,550
Can you know the world is not designed
for you and your seven feet two man,

3109
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:13,241
he's giant.

3110
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:15,550
Semi shelties and other
one's seven feet tall.

3111
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:19,210
Giant kickboxers Jesus Christ.

3112
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:20,020
Where the,

3113
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:23,290
you know this and I guarantee you
have kids that are coming up today,

3114
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:25,660
the kids that are growing
up and they're going to be,

3115
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:26,553
you know,

3116
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:31,690
coming to fruition or a coming to a full
height rather a within the next decade

3117
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:33,160
they're going to be even more giant.

3118
01:25:33,190 --> 01:25:37,440
It's like people are going to get bigger
and bigger and bigger till we like

3119
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:38,560
start morphing,

3120
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:39,171
you know,

3121
01:25:39,171 --> 01:25:40,420
and we start super giant.

3122
01:25:40,421 --> 01:25:41,254
We're going to be giants.

3123
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:42,490
There's no doubt about it man.

3124
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:47,730
As soon as they figure out a way
to engineer the body selectively,

3125
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:52,270
we're going to figure out
what's the optimum size you
can be and people are just

3126
01:25:52,271 --> 01:25:57,271
going to grow to that size that like a
hundred years ago there was not a fucking

3127
01:25:57,521 --> 01:25:58,450
bunch of six,

3128
01:25:58,451 --> 01:25:58,811
six,

3129
01:25:58,811 --> 01:25:59,680
300 pounds people.

3130
01:25:59,730 --> 01:26:02,950
Do you know how much the average
soldier weighed in the civil war?

3131
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:03,800
How much?

3132
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,360
125 pounds.

3133
01:26:05,430 --> 01:26:06,263
Yeah.

3134
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:09,020
They were tiny little dudes.

3135
01:26:09,021 --> 01:26:10,280
Tommy as a fifth grader.

3136
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:10,611
Yeah.

3137
01:26:10,611 --> 01:26:14,120
That is not the same type of human being
that we have today because people were

3138
01:26:14,121 --> 01:26:15,110
malnourished.

3139
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:19,730
Everybody's catching fucking
diseases is shit all over everything.

3140
01:26:19,731 --> 01:26:20,630
Babies are dying.

3141
01:26:20,631 --> 01:26:21,770
Nobody knows how to wash their hands.

3142
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:21,961
Right.

3143
01:26:21,961 --> 01:26:22,820
And it's a mess.

3144
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:24,411
That was a mess.

3145
01:26:24,411 --> 01:26:25,850
Those are tiny ass little people.

3146
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:29,000
Those people lived in the 18
hundreds or a tiny ass little people.

3147
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:29,140
Yeah,

3148
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:31,520
we just have Gargantuan
and they're getting bigger.

3149
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:31,950
These,

3150
01:26:31,950 --> 01:26:33,680
these Shaquille O'Neal dudes.

3151
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,680
I did a fear factor which
Kilo Neil and I have,

3152
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:38,210
I stand deck height,

3153
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:40,053
fuel deal.

3154
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:40,611
He's a,

3155
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:42,230
he's a grown man.

3156
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:43,190
I'm a grown man.

3157
01:26:43,191 --> 01:26:44,780
His Dick is in my face.

3158
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:47,600
I mean he's just so different than me.

3159
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:49,200
It's just such a great quote.

3160
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:51,410
I'm standing next to him.

3161
01:26:51,411 --> 01:26:51,630
We,

3162
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:52,700
and we do a countdown.

3163
01:26:52,701 --> 01:26:54,470
It's hilarious because it's me,

3164
01:26:54,471 --> 01:26:54,831
you know,

3165
01:26:54,831 --> 01:26:55,501
I was like shot,

3166
01:26:55,501 --> 01:26:56,400
count them down and he goes

3167
01:26:58,270 --> 01:26:59,103
Whoa,

3168
01:26:59,340 --> 01:27:01,850
Oh and you know the people
go and do their stone.

3169
01:27:01,851 --> 01:27:03,890
It was really cool
cause he liked the show.

3170
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:06,360
So it was fun like having
him coast with me for a day,

3171
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:07,940
but it's just so ridiculous.

3172
01:27:07,941 --> 01:27:10,340
I'm like a little child
standing next to this giant.

3173
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:11,900
I have super nice guy though.

3174
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:14,450
Jonathan Ogden offensive tackle,

3175
01:27:14,451 --> 01:27:18,500
six eight like three 40
played at and his hand.

3176
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:19,753
He just like,

3177
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:21,380
he just held to have my little fingers.

3178
01:27:21,381 --> 01:27:25,290
It was like nice to meet you and like and
like just squeezed a couple of fingers

3179
01:27:25,291 --> 01:27:28,190
and I realized my hand
couldn't even like get around,

3180
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:33,520
like even simulate a handshake and he
also had a conversation with somebody,

3181
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:36,020
like as I was talking to him,

3182
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:37,310
like down here,

3183
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:37,701
I was like,

3184
01:27:37,701 --> 01:27:37,891
yeah,

3185
01:27:37,891 --> 01:27:38,631
so it's cool to me.

3186
01:27:38,631 --> 01:27:39,081
He was like,

3187
01:27:39,081 --> 01:27:39,621
yeah man,

3188
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:40,190
so this other,

3189
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:40,821
at the end I was like,

3190
01:27:40,821 --> 01:27:41,240
I'm down.

3191
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:41,571
I'm like,

3192
01:27:41,571 --> 01:27:41,930
Damn.

3193
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:42,171
I was like,

3194
01:27:42,171 --> 01:27:42,770
hey man,

3195
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:43,401
like a kid.

3196
01:27:43,401 --> 01:27:46,340
Like when your kid walks up to you and
they're talking to and you're talking to

3197
01:27:46,341 --> 01:27:47,560
another adult and you're right,

3198
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:49,730
just hold on and you're talking
to the adult and they're like,

3199
01:27:49,731 --> 01:27:50,660
but daddy and you're like,

3200
01:27:50,661 --> 01:27:52,550
just hold on and you just talk over them.

3201
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,410
He did that to me like I was a child.

3202
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:57,050
I just looked up at him and I was like,

3203
01:27:57,051 --> 01:27:57,884
it was nice to meet you.

3204
01:27:58,770 --> 01:27:59,870
You're like pat at the top.

3205
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:00,700
Go ahead.

3206
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:01,150
Yeah,

3207
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:01,983
it was dope.

3208
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,130
It was not like a human though.

3209
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:06,170
It was like a fucking superhuman.

3210
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:06,831
Yeah.

3211
01:28:06,831 --> 01:28:07,401
It's amazing.

3212
01:28:07,401 --> 01:28:08,300
The variance,

3213
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:08,571
you know,

3214
01:28:08,571 --> 01:28:08,931
how much,

3215
01:28:08,931 --> 01:28:10,110
how much people vary in,

3216
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:13,130
in the height and size like that.

3217
01:28:13,131 --> 01:28:14,810
But yet we're still in the same species.

3218
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:15,490
Yeah.

3219
01:28:15,490 --> 01:28:17,090
But a guy should kill Neil.

3220
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:17,451
It's like,

3221
01:28:17,451 --> 01:28:19,340
it's such an extreme version of it.

3222
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:20,990
Fucking huge.

3223
01:28:21,010 --> 01:28:21,920
It's friendly guy though.

3224
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:22,401
Super,

3225
01:28:22,401 --> 01:28:23,240
Super Nice Guy.

3226
01:28:23,241 --> 01:28:23,810
Yeah.

3227
01:28:23,810 --> 01:28:26,600
Mike Goldberg did a whole season
of shack versus with them.

3228
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:27,051
Oh yeah.

3229
01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:28,160
He did a bunch of cool shit.

3230
01:28:28,161 --> 01:28:29,570
Like that was gold box.

3231
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:30,920
Oscar de la Hoya.

3232
01:28:30,921 --> 01:28:31,431
And you know,

3233
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:32,630
it was kind of funny.

3234
01:28:32,631 --> 01:28:33,800
He did a bunch of different things.

3235
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:34,531
I am a,

3236
01:28:34,531 --> 01:28:35,000
you know,

3237
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,560
do you know the other comic Bruce Bruce?

3238
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:37,443
Do you know him?

3239
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:38,343
He's a big dude.

3240
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:39,710
Big enormous guy.

3241
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:40,371
Not that tall,

3242
01:28:40,371 --> 01:28:42,160
but write like 300 plus pounds.

3243
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:45,110
I sat next to him on a flight.

3244
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:46,430
Did I tell you this already know?

3245
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:47,293
And uh,

3246
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,370
I'd never met him before
and I recognized him,

3247
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:50,870
so I was like,

3248
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:51,891
hey man,

3249
01:28:51,891 --> 01:28:52,131
like,

3250
01:28:52,131 --> 01:28:52,964
you know,

3251
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:53,390
uh,

3252
01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:54,021
I'm a comic.

3253
01:28:54,021 --> 01:28:54,440
And he was like,

3254
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:54,651
oh yeah,

3255
01:28:54,651 --> 01:28:56,690
he's super fucking Nice.

3256
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:00,060
And he's just this big giant looking.

3257
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:02,220
Can I ask where this story goes?

3258
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:02,730
Where?

3259
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:03,660
Sleep apnea?

3260
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:04,440
No.

3261
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:04,890
Okay.

3262
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:05,290
No,

3263
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:06,123
it's

3264
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:08,593
uh,

3265
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:09,350
uh,

3266
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:09,630
you know,

3267
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:10,890
10 minutes into the flight,

3268
01:29:10,891 --> 01:29:11,880
got braids and shit.

3269
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:12,421
So we get,

3270
01:29:12,421 --> 01:29:13,800
we get delayed and first of all,

3271
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:15,000
we're flying la,

3272
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:15,810
Atlanta,

3273
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:16,500
and then I'm going to,

3274
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,660
I'm going on to Lauderdale.

3275
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:19,610
He's staying at,

3276
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,281
he lives in Atlanta,

3277
01:29:20,281 --> 01:29:21,030
I guess.

3278
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:23,190
So everybody that comes on the plane,

3279
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:24,180
uh,

3280
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:26,340
who's black says something
to him and I'm like,

3281
01:29:26,940 --> 01:29:27,751
do you like,

3282
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:28,584
do you know these people?

3283
01:29:28,630 --> 01:29:29,040
He was like,

3284
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:29,730
aw man,

3285
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:30,563
these people just,

3286
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:31,740
they just fans.

3287
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:32,131
And I was like,

3288
01:29:32,131 --> 01:29:32,340
read,

3289
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:35,880
like everybody on the plane has stopped
and they tell us there's a delay,

3290
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:37,530
you can get off the plane if you want.

3291
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:40,560
And some girl walks by and she's like,

3292
01:29:40,561 --> 01:29:41,300
do you need something?

3293
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:41,820
And he's like,

3294
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:42,031
ah,

3295
01:29:42,031 --> 01:29:42,510
I'd love sweet,

3296
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:43,740
like a candy bar.

3297
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:44,911
And then she's like,

3298
01:29:44,911 --> 01:29:45,450
okay.

3299
01:29:45,450 --> 01:29:45,810
And I'm like,

3300
01:29:45,810 --> 01:29:46,230
who's that?

3301
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:46,650
He's like,

3302
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:47,320
I dunno.

3303
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:47,600
It's like,

3304
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,870
that leads just buying you candy man.

3305
01:29:49,130 --> 01:29:49,561
And he's like,

3306
01:29:49,561 --> 01:29:50,160
yeah,

3307
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:50,820
pretty much.

3308
01:29:50,820 --> 01:29:51,630
I was like,

3309
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:51,960
okay,

3310
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,480
whoa and sweet.

3311
01:29:53,610 --> 01:29:54,180
Like,

3312
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:55,500
I can't tell you how sweet of guy he is.

3313
01:29:55,501 --> 01:29:56,040
So we're,

3314
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,500
we get to let the girl comes back,

3315
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:58,170
gives them candy.

3316
01:29:58,170 --> 01:29:59,003
I'm like,

3317
01:29:59,190 --> 01:29:59,760
I love you.

3318
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:00,091
And he's like,

3319
01:30:00,091 --> 01:30:00,361
I left.

3320
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:01,194
Thank you sweetie.

3321
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:01,801
He,

3322
01:30:01,801 --> 01:30:02,640
she goes back,

3323
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:03,901
we take off,

3324
01:30:03,901 --> 01:30:06,330
we started talking comedy and he's like,

3325
01:30:06,331 --> 01:30:08,180
I'm doing this tour with a,

3326
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:08,750
you know,

3327
01:30:08,750 --> 01:30:11,220
I'm torn with this person and
doing shows with these people.

3328
01:30:11,221 --> 01:30:12,090
And I'm asking him like,

3329
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:12,210
Oh,

3330
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:13,320
what do you think of so and so?

3331
01:30:13,590 --> 01:30:16,740
And we're talking back and forth
about people and he's like,

3332
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:17,900
I'm doing this show right now where I'm,

3333
01:30:17,901 --> 01:30:18,140
uh,

3334
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:18,310
you know,

3335
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:19,730
doing some theaters with Mike Epps.

3336
01:30:19,731 --> 01:30:23,010
I'm opening like for him
at these massive theaters.

3337
01:30:23,011 --> 01:30:23,371
And I was like,

3338
01:30:23,371 --> 01:30:25,230
Mike Epps is a funny fucking dude.

3339
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:25,771
Like,

3340
01:30:25,771 --> 01:30:28,470
just a naturally funny guy because
we're just like talking shit.

3341
01:30:28,910 --> 01:30:29,381
Oh yeah,

3342
01:30:29,381 --> 01:30:29,521
yeah.

3343
01:30:29,521 --> 01:30:29,761
It was like,

3344
01:30:29,761 --> 01:30:30,330
you know,

3345
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:32,070
that guy just turned
to any situation funny.

3346
01:30:32,071 --> 01:30:32,311
He's like,

3347
01:30:32,311 --> 01:30:33,060
yeah,

3348
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:33,361
but,

3349
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:34,080
uh,

3350
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,060
ain't no mother fucker
funnier than Andy Griffith.

3351
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:36,961
And I was like,

3352
01:30:36,961 --> 01:30:37,410
what?

3353
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:37,591
Like,

3354
01:30:37,591 --> 01:30:38,424
what'd you just say?

3355
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:39,210
And he's like,

3356
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:39,990
Andy Griffith.

3357
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:40,440
I was like,

3358
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,790
are you not Eddie Griffin?

3359
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:42,340
Right.

3360
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:43,173
Are we talking about Andy?

3361
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:44,660
The whistle shit.

3362
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:46,013
Yeah.

3363
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:46,830
He's like,

3364
01:30:46,830 --> 01:30:47,670
aw man.

3365
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:48,120
And I'm like,

3366
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,050
are you serious right now?

3367
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:49,681
And he's like,

3368
01:30:49,681 --> 01:30:51,120
you've been to Andy Griffith Museum.

3369
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:51,720
I'm like,

3370
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,920
what kind of questions that man?

3371
01:30:52,921 --> 01:30:53,754
Like

3372
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:57,750
what kind of questions?

3373
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:58,470
And he's like,

3374
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:59,303
aw man,

3375
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:00,420
they got the,

3376
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:01,060
like the,

3377
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:02,400
the car from the,

3378
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:02,941
from the show,

3379
01:31:02,941 --> 01:31:03,600
you can,

3380
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:04,590
you could sit in the car.

3381
01:31:04,591 --> 01:31:05,610
They have like a set,

3382
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,050
but like with the kitchen,

3383
01:31:07,051 --> 01:31:07,861
they used to show the kitchen,

3384
01:31:07,861 --> 01:31:08,380
you can go there.

3385
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,260
You get all the Andy
Griffith show you ever want.

3386
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:11,093
I'm like,

3387
01:31:11,830 --> 01:31:13,230
are we in the real world right now?

3388
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:14,970
And he loves any good man.

3389
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:15,241
He,

3390
01:31:15,241 --> 01:31:15,750
I was like,

3391
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:18,540
I don't think I like anything as
much as you like Andy Griffith.

3392
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:18,721
He's like,

3393
01:31:18,721 --> 01:31:19,590
I love Andy Griffith.

3394
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:20,821
And I was like,

3395
01:31:20,821 --> 01:31:21,654
clearly.

3396
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:22,710
And he knew,

3397
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:23,730
he was like,

3398
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:24,220
uh,

3399
01:31:24,220 --> 01:31:24,450
you know,

3400
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:25,740
and I'm not exaggerating.

3401
01:31:25,741 --> 01:31:26,310
He was like,

3402
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:26,491
you know,

3403
01:31:26,491 --> 01:31:27,324
there was two,

3404
01:31:27,390 --> 01:31:27,960
uh,

3405
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:30,120
black act as that ever appeared
on the Andy Griffith show.

3406
01:31:30,121 --> 01:31:30,954
And I was like,

3407
01:31:31,050 --> 01:31:31,411
wow.

3408
01:31:31,411 --> 01:31:32,010
He's like,

3409
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:35,190
one was a February 8th,

3410
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:35,340
1963.

3411
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:36,780
Why the role of Tony?

3412
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:37,830
Are you saying the right data?

3413
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:38,940
You just know I'm making up the date,

3414
01:31:39,010 --> 01:31:41,070
but he knew the day lets
these people not all right.

3415
01:31:41,071 --> 01:31:43,050
He knew the day we're going
to heat this up on Google.

3416
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:46,280
He knew the exact date and he knew the
role and the episode and then he was

3417
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:46,421
like,

3418
01:31:46,421 --> 01:31:49,980
and the other one was April 19th,

3419
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:50,813
1968 and that was when,

3420
01:31:50,910 --> 01:31:52,230
remember when they couldn't find the mail.

3421
01:31:52,231 --> 01:31:52,501
I'm like,

3422
01:31:52,501 --> 01:31:52,740
no,

3423
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:53,890
I have not seen these episodes.

3424
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:54,990
Fuck member.

3425
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,680
When they couldn't find my mail.

3426
01:31:57,310 --> 01:31:57,810
I was like,

3427
01:31:57,810 --> 01:31:59,070
I swear to God and I was like,

3428
01:31:59,230 --> 01:31:59,921
Holy Shit.

3429
01:31:59,921 --> 01:32:00,460
Andy Griffith

3430
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:01,330
is a shit man.

3431
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:01,840
I was like,

3432
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:02,651
Andy Griffith,

3433
01:32:02,651 --> 01:32:04,720
real Andy Griffin is a shotgun.

3434
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:06,250
Love Andy Griffith man.

3435
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:07,030
Wow.

3436
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:07,700
Wow.

3437
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:12,240
This is a lot of people that had like
p that pay homage to the classics like

3438
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:17,270
this dudes who are really get into
like old movies and shows and,

3439
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:21,370
and I've met like super fans of
some things that you don't expect.

3440
01:32:21,371 --> 01:32:24,400
But that for me was so adolescent field.

3441
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:26,170
I saw Carol Burnett the other day.

3442
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,250
You did Dan.

3443
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:28,383
She looked good.

3444
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:29,943
She looked good.

3445
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:30,760
I'm telling you man.

3446
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:31,031
I mean,

3447
01:32:31,031 --> 01:32:34,600
I think the lady is in her late seventies.

3448
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:36,070
She looked very healthy,

3449
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:36,830
smiling,

3450
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:38,140
laughing and talking to people.

3451
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:38,741
She,

3452
01:32:38,741 --> 01:32:39,340
um,

3453
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:40,180
that show was great.

3454
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:40,610
Yeah,

3455
01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:41,443
it was a great show.

3456
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:42,071
Well,

3457
01:32:42,071 --> 01:32:42,581
it's interesting.

3458
01:32:42,581 --> 01:32:42,770
We were,

3459
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:43,930
we were talking about this the other day,

3460
01:32:43,931 --> 01:32:48,931
like there was like a big wave of a
woman run shows back in there in the day

3461
01:32:49,571 --> 01:32:50,740
with a woman was a star.

3462
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:52,480
There was Laverne and Shirley,

3463
01:32:52,481 --> 01:32:53,950
there was Mary Tyler Moore.

3464
01:32:53,951 --> 01:32:54,820
There was road.

3465
01:32:54,821 --> 01:32:55,090
Uh,

3466
01:32:55,090 --> 01:32:57,220
there was a mod,

3467
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:58,930
remember mod and know,

3468
01:32:59,380 --> 01:33:03,690
and then there's mod and
then asthma on bad on nod.

3469
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:05,410
And I remember that there was a,

3470
01:33:05,411 --> 01:33:08,020
there was a show that was
like a big popular show.

3471
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:09,040
And then there was,

3472
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:09,460
um,

3473
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:13,240
the older lady who used to
be a model ran the news room.

3474
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:14,290
The fuck was that?

3475
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:14,951
Oh yeah,

3476
01:33:14,951 --> 01:33:15,161
yeah,

3477
01:33:15,161 --> 01:33:15,540
yeah.

3478
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:16,570
Orange,

3479
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:16,600
Brown,

3480
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,231
Murphy Brown.

3481
01:33:17,231 --> 01:33:19,240
That boring gas hypnotic.

3482
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:23,020
What did they do to get people to
watch that show for all those years?

3483
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:24,790
What kind of long time?

3484
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:25,624
Hypnotism

3485
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:28,543
five.

3486
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:28,991
Yeah,

3487
01:33:28,991 --> 01:33:30,130
there was a gang of them,

3488
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:31,021
but I mean that the,

3489
01:33:31,021 --> 01:33:32,380
the era of,

3490
01:33:32,381 --> 01:33:32,860
um,

3491
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:34,090
Carol Burnett was like,

3492
01:33:34,091 --> 01:33:34,420
there was a,

3493
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:35,680
like Lucille Ball,

3494
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:36,820
there was a bunch of them,

3495
01:33:36,821 --> 01:33:37,810
there was a bunch of them,

3496
01:33:37,811 --> 01:33:40,840
like really strong women
comedian presences.

3497
01:33:41,290 --> 01:33:43,360
It's like Dan has changed quite a bit now.

3498
01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:45,940
Like the role that women have on these,

3499
01:33:45,941 --> 01:33:46,210
like,

3500
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:46,481
you know,

3501
01:33:46,481 --> 01:33:49,570
you have like girls like
Chelsea who have their own show,

3502
01:33:50,070 --> 01:33:51,490
but it's like her personality.

3503
01:33:51,491 --> 01:33:52,001
It's not like,

3504
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:52,270
uh,

3505
01:33:52,270 --> 01:33:54,820
like her being the head of a sitcom.

3506
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:55,781
And then there's,

3507
01:33:55,781 --> 01:34:00,781
I'm Whitney Whitney who had a show that
people didn't respond to that well,

3508
01:34:01,001 --> 01:34:01,691
but then people said,

3509
01:34:01,691 --> 01:34:01,811
well,

3510
01:34:01,811 --> 01:34:03,760
it's going to be tweaked and
they're gonna figure it out.

3511
01:34:03,761 --> 01:34:04,320
But she,

3512
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,730
but genuinely people seem to like her.

3513
01:34:06,731 --> 01:34:08,530
She just has to find
like the right vehicle.

3514
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:08,940
Right,

3515
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:09,370
right.

3516
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:11,140
But how many of them are there these days?

3517
01:34:11,141 --> 01:34:11,501
It's not,

3518
01:34:11,501 --> 01:34:12,610
it's not like it used to be.

3519
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:13,240
Yeah.

3520
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:13,831
Especially what,

3521
01:34:13,831 --> 01:34:14,141
well,

3522
01:34:14,141 --> 01:34:15,520
also where they need to,

3523
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:15,761
you know,

3524
01:34:15,761 --> 01:34:16,720
where they're getting their shot.

3525
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:17,321
You know what I mean?

3526
01:34:17,321 --> 01:34:17,620
Like,

3527
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:18,370
you know,

3528
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:19,540
like how many,

3529
01:34:19,810 --> 01:34:23,680
how many people are getting the
opportunity to have their show,

3530
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:24,220
you know,

3531
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:24,461
because the,

3532
01:34:24,461 --> 01:34:25,300
because the talent,

3533
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:26,110
there's still talent.

3534
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:27,400
Just a bunch of talent out there.

3535
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:28,263
Like you know,

3536
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:30,400
there's definitely talented comics,

3537
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,580
female male comics out there and,

3538
01:34:32,590 --> 01:34:34,630
but they have to get a
shot to get there show.

3539
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:38,830
That seemed to be like that was an
overdrive in that era that you're talking

3540
01:34:38,831 --> 01:34:40,720
about if you were a women.

3541
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:41,261
Yeah.

3542
01:34:41,261 --> 01:34:41,681
Women.

3543
01:34:41,681 --> 01:34:43,270
But also I think just comics too.

3544
01:34:43,290 --> 01:34:44,123
Like there was,

3545
01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:47,050
there was an era of pushing
the comic to get the show.

3546
01:34:47,051 --> 01:34:48,960
And here's the thing
that's funny that you,

3547
01:34:49,170 --> 01:34:49,830
when you like why,

3548
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:51,210
how come not that many stand up,

3549
01:34:51,211 --> 01:34:52,480
let's say have a show right now.

3550
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:53,080
Right,

3551
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:53,291
right.

3552
01:34:53,291 --> 01:34:53,750
Like how many more?

3553
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:55,780
It's like bait and extension of the comic.

3554
01:34:56,170 --> 01:35:01,170
You'd look back on that era and all of
those shows were hits like the standup

3555
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:03,260
where the comic was elite.

3556
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:04,310
A lot of those were hits,

3557
01:35:04,311 --> 01:35:04,491
man.

3558
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:04,730
Yeah.

3559
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:05,990
There was a few bombs though.

3560
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:06,360
I was,

3561
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:07,670
I was there for a view.

3562
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:08,151
Yeah.

3563
01:35:08,151 --> 01:35:09,320
But there's a watched a few,

3564
01:35:09,321 --> 01:35:11,480
I was a part of a few that was for,

3565
01:35:11,490 --> 01:35:12,710
I had my own Sitcom.

3566
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:13,210
Uh,

3567
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:15,080
you did a pilot for NBC once.

3568
01:35:15,081 --> 01:35:15,231
Yeah.

3569
01:35:15,231 --> 01:35:15,891
It was called,

3570
01:35:15,891 --> 01:35:16,370
um,

3571
01:35:16,370 --> 01:35:17,360
overseas.

3572
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:20,060
I don't even think it ever Erin anywhere.

3573
01:35:20,061 --> 01:35:20,990
Even as a pilot.

3574
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:21,821
You shot the pilot though.

3575
01:35:21,821 --> 01:35:22,130
Yeah,

3576
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:23,900
it was super expensive pilot.

3577
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:25,550
But the,

3578
01:35:25,551 --> 01:35:26,030
um,

3579
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:28,280
the thing about like those,

3580
01:35:28,281 --> 01:35:28,610
uh,

3581
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:33,200
development deals I tried to do at
standups is that they would just throw a

3582
01:35:33,201 --> 01:35:36,620
bunch of money at a comic
and then get a bunch of like,

3583
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:37,491
you know,

3584
01:35:37,491 --> 01:35:41,600
writers and supposedly had some success
on other shows and throw as much shit

3585
01:35:41,601 --> 01:35:43,940
against the wall and see
how much of it sticks.

3586
01:35:43,941 --> 01:35:44,540
Yeah.

3587
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:44,871
You know,

3588
01:35:44,871 --> 01:35:47,750
and I think that it's,

3589
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:53,600
it's real hard for you to take the one
thing that you're fucking awesome at,

3590
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:54,500
which is stand up.

3591
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:56,330
The one thing that you
really quick and complete,

3592
01:35:56,331 --> 01:35:57,230
express yourself.

3593
01:35:57,231 --> 01:35:58,550
You're uncensored,

3594
01:35:58,551 --> 01:35:59,060
you're,

3595
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:00,140
you're producing it,

3596
01:36:00,141 --> 01:36:00,974
you're directing it.

3597
01:36:00,980 --> 01:36:02,250
Nobody's interfering with your,

3598
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:04,310
your vision of how the
joke should play out.

3599
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:09,230
And there's a big difference between
that and being on a set comp set and that

3600
01:36:09,260 --> 01:36:10,850
that difference is

3601
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:13,130
it.

3602
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:13,491
There's a,

3603
01:36:13,491 --> 01:36:15,470
it's really fun being on a good Sitcom.

3604
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:17,510
It's terrible being on a bad sitcom.

3605
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:18,493
It's terrible.

3606
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,260
And it's not as,

3607
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:25,460
Mo is not as much fun and it's
not as rewarding as doing standup.

3608
01:36:25,461 --> 01:36:26,294
It's just not,

3609
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:26,691
you know,

3610
01:36:26,691 --> 01:36:28,660
for me at least it's like a,

3611
01:36:28,710 --> 01:36:30,650
it's fun doing like a cool sitcoms.

3612
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:34,130
But if I had a choice between watching
like the best sitcom ever or watching

3613
01:36:34,131 --> 01:36:35,600
Richard Pryor do stand up,

3614
01:36:35,601 --> 01:36:36,650
I want to watch Richard Pryor.

3615
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:37,730
That's the best stuff.

3616
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:38,930
The best stuff is stand up.

3617
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:40,010
So it's like you,

3618
01:36:40,011 --> 01:36:43,160
you do shit that's not as good as the
best stuff and it's just because they're

3619
01:36:43,161 --> 01:36:43,940
paying you to do it.

3620
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:45,890
That was how I was feeling about it.

3621
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:49,640
And the thing that you don't really love
to do and that they're paying you to

3622
01:36:49,641 --> 01:36:49,791
do,

3623
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:54,110
it takes all day and then you don't have
as much energy or time leftover for the

3624
01:36:54,111 --> 01:36:55,250
thing that you do love to do.

3625
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:56,183
And I can see that.

3626
01:36:56,660 --> 01:36:59,300
So the only reason why you should do
it is to get exposure for your standup.

3627
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,020
Yeah.

3628
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:00,741
Which I hear it like,

3629
01:37:00,741 --> 01:37:04,100
I mean some of the comics that
really alike doing comedy,

3630
01:37:04,101 --> 01:37:04,934
doing standup,

3631
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,010
that's generally what you hear them say.

3632
01:37:07,011 --> 01:37:09,290
It was like it's just going to
drive more people to see my show.

3633
01:37:09,410 --> 01:37:09,800
Yeah.

3634
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:10,633
That's how it should be.

3635
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:11,391
That's how it should be,

3636
01:37:11,391 --> 01:37:11,720
man.

3637
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:12,553
That's how it should be.

3638
01:37:12,980 --> 01:37:13,551
It's a,

3639
01:37:13,551 --> 01:37:14,820
the art of standup comedy,

3640
01:37:14,821 --> 01:37:18,320
he didn't get any respect for
awhile in the 80s I think as a,

3641
01:37:18,321 --> 01:37:20,780
as an end destination
because everybody was like,

3642
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:21,650
you gotta get a Sitcom,

3643
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:22,460
you gotta get a Sitcom.

3644
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:23,830
That's what Jerry Seinfeld did.

3645
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:27,110
This guy did the pilot in
terms of like your career,

3646
01:37:27,111 --> 01:37:29,360
like I did it in the
middle of news radio alarm.

3647
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:29,781
It'll all,

3648
01:37:29,781 --> 01:37:30,740
I was doing news radio.

3649
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:31,041
Yeah.

3650
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:32,180
Cause it was the same producer.

3651
01:37:32,770 --> 01:37:36,080
So seed that and that's shelf
spoiled his shit out of me man.

3652
01:37:36,081 --> 01:37:38,030
Because they were so good.

3653
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:41,120
The writers were so good
and they were crazy.

3654
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:41,370
They would,

3655
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:42,230
they were so nuts.

3656
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:44,270
They wouldn't even start a script
till like two o'clock in the morning.

3657
01:37:44,271 --> 01:37:45,104
Sometimes,

3658
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:45,441
and they would,

3659
01:37:45,441 --> 01:37:49,100
she would show up and it would
be like tape day or a rather,

3660
01:37:49,101 --> 01:37:49,530
um,

3661
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:53,550
a rehearsal day and we would get like
the first 30 pages and they're like,

3662
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:56,220
or the first five pages
or whatever it was,

3663
01:37:56,221 --> 01:37:56,490
they're like,

3664
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:57,660
we're going to give you the rest later.

3665
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:01,680
And then a scene two would come down
at noon and they would shuffle down

3666
01:38:01,681 --> 01:38:03,210
barefoot and slap it down.

3667
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:04,660
They'd go back and they would,

3668
01:38:04,661 --> 01:38:08,550
they would get to this state of sleep
deprivation and come up with this really

3669
01:38:08,551 --> 01:38:09,480
silly shit.

3670
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:14,250
And I suspect it was because nobody had
informed them about the benefits of we'd

3671
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:15,503
really,

3672
01:38:16,110 --> 01:38:17,610
I think if those guys were stoners,

3673
01:38:17,620 --> 01:38:19,860
they weren't stoners and those
are the guys were stoners.

3674
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:23,010
What they did sober was brilliant.

3675
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:23,610
You know,

3676
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:24,061
if they,

3677
01:38:24,061 --> 01:38:25,170
if those guys were high,

3678
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:28,320
they could have come up with the most
silly and ridiculous show in the history

3679
01:38:28,321 --> 01:38:28,980
of the universe.

3680
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:30,320
How many seasons was that Sean,

3681
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:31,200
for five seasons.

3682
01:38:31,230 --> 01:38:31,650
Five.

3683
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:32,160
Yeah.

3684
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:32,691
That was a longer,

3685
01:38:32,691 --> 01:38:36,270
even now it was just too
short of a syndication,

3686
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:37,980
like the normal syndication length.

3687
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:38,311
Oh,

3688
01:38:38,311 --> 01:38:39,220
Mitt isn't syndicated.

3689
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:39,331
Oh,

3690
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:39,720
it isn't,

3691
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:40,380
but it's to,

3692
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:40,560
to,

3693
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:41,311
to episode short,

3694
01:38:41,311 --> 01:38:43,420
we only did 98 instead of a hundred.

3695
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:45,930
And you're supposed to have a
hundred so that they could sell it.

3696
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:46,800
Yeah.

3697
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,840
But it didn't become popular
until after it was canceled.

3698
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:49,650
Really?

3699
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:49,790
Yeah.

3700
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:53,130
Became popular when it would air
on TV during like regular TV time,

3701
01:38:53,131 --> 01:38:55,950
like seven o'clock and eight o'clock and
late night and shit like that when it

3702
01:38:55,951 --> 01:38:57,750
was syndicated and then people will like,

3703
01:38:57,770 --> 01:38:58,980
this show's kind of fucking funny.

3704
01:38:59,030 --> 01:38:59,680
Yeah.

3705
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:01,350
It's just gotten monkeyed
around back then,

3706
01:39:01,351 --> 01:39:01,620
man.

3707
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:03,570
Back in the day when
when news radio was out,

3708
01:39:03,571 --> 01:39:06,930
nobody knew where the fuck you where
if they moved you from like Monday to

3709
01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:06,960
Wednesday,

3710
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:07,860
you're done kid.

3711
01:39:08,370 --> 01:39:09,203
Nobody knows.

3712
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:09,841
The other thing,

3713
01:39:09,841 --> 01:39:11,400
like more to your point about the,

3714
01:39:11,401 --> 01:39:11,521
uh,

3715
01:39:11,521 --> 01:39:11,791
you know,

3716
01:39:11,791 --> 01:39:14,580
when you're just in charge
of your standup shows,

3717
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:15,121
man,

3718
01:39:15,121 --> 01:39:18,960
you're talking about so many
people are giving their input.

3719
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:19,511
You know,

3720
01:39:19,511 --> 01:39:21,870
like the executive producers,

3721
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:22,430
writers,

3722
01:39:22,430 --> 01:39:23,910
like so many people,

3723
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:24,990
we should really do this.

3724
01:39:24,991 --> 01:39:26,010
We should really lose that.

3725
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:27,121
Well,

3726
01:39:27,121 --> 01:39:28,950
I don't like it when
you come out that way.

3727
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:29,521
I don't,

3728
01:39:29,521 --> 01:39:30,091
I don't like it.

3729
01:39:30,091 --> 01:39:30,924
When you do that,

3730
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:31,950
I don't like it when you,

3731
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:33,750
Oh stop please.

3732
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:35,280
I don't care.

3733
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:39,300
We can only do this one way and the only
way I'm going to get advice as is from

3734
01:39:39,301 --> 01:39:40,080
funny people.

3735
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:42,030
I can't get advice for someone
who's a business person.

3736
01:39:42,031 --> 01:39:42,720
It's like,

3737
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,920
I just kind of tell you that.

3738
01:39:43,921 --> 01:39:46,200
I think that approaching it this way,

3739
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:47,820
when they give you a comedy note,

3740
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:48,713
that's just like,

3741
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:52,170
I had a conversation with a guy and he's
talking about podcasting because you

3742
01:39:52,171 --> 01:39:55,800
guys have really nailed down
your brand and I'm like,

3743
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:57,540
oh that's gross language.

3744
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,830
You're grouse.

3745
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:00,390
Yeah,

3746
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:02,340
that's the last thing we've done.

3747
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:05,220
Nailed down our brand.

3748
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:07,321
He's like,

3749
01:40:07,321 --> 01:40:07,920
you know,

3750
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:08,161
I go,

3751
01:40:08,161 --> 01:40:09,120
what do you mean by then?

3752
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:09,571
It's like,

3753
01:40:09,571 --> 01:40:10,404
well you know,

3754
01:40:11,190 --> 01:40:12,330
people know what kind of,

3755
01:40:12,360 --> 01:40:13,860
you know what you're putting out there.

3756
01:40:13,861 --> 01:40:14,191
It's like,

3757
01:40:14,191 --> 01:40:16,530
you know you've really like well defined,

3758
01:40:16,531 --> 01:40:16,841
your,

3759
01:40:16,841 --> 01:40:17,674
your brand.

3760
01:40:20,350 --> 01:40:21,183
My brand.

3761
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:22,133
What is that?

3762
01:40:22,470 --> 01:40:22,770
Yeah.

3763
01:40:22,770 --> 01:40:24,450
Fuck you talking about the edge.

3764
01:40:24,660 --> 01:40:26,010
It's like show Biz talk.

3765
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:26,851
Well,

3766
01:40:26,851 --> 01:40:27,661
we're trying to,

3767
01:40:27,661 --> 01:40:28,860
right now we're,

3768
01:40:28,861 --> 01:40:30,660
we're working on is development deal,

3769
01:40:30,661 --> 01:40:32,190
but we just don't want
to sign with anyone.

3770
01:40:32,680 --> 01:40:35,010
We really want to work
on developing its brand.

3771
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:36,433
Yeah.

3772
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:37,180
Brand.

3773
01:40:37,180 --> 01:40:37,530
Are you,

3774
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,850
are you a bottle of ketchup?

3775
01:40:38,851 --> 01:40:39,684
You fuck.

3776
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,400
Define what do you need a brand?

3777
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:43,260
Sorry is silly bitch.

3778
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:45,320
If you're that defined you,

3779
01:40:45,321 --> 01:40:46,470
then you become immobile.

3780
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:49,930
You become locked into an
emo Phillips type character.

3781
01:40:49,931 --> 01:40:50,764
Oh yeah.

3782
01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:52,560
Imagine going Cmo
Phillips and he drives to,

3783
01:40:52,561 --> 01:40:53,950
tries to do stand up and be like,

3784
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,311
hey,

3785
01:40:54,311 --> 01:40:54,551
hey,

3786
01:40:54,551 --> 01:40:55,450
fuck head.

3787
01:40:56,110 --> 01:40:58,270
Why aren't you acting
like you're poised it up,

3788
01:40:58,350 --> 01:40:59,100
man.

3789
01:40:59,100 --> 01:40:59,611
We ended up,

3790
01:40:59,611 --> 01:41:00,670
we ended up shithead.

3791
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:01,931
What's this?

3792
01:41:01,931 --> 01:41:03,940
You just standing there
telling me about butter.

3793
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:04,833
Okay.

3794
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,450
Get a move on with I came to see your,

3795
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:09,010
your fucking funky act.

3796
01:41:09,190 --> 01:41:10,023
I love it man.

3797
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:10,241
Well,

3798
01:41:10,241 --> 01:41:11,110
if you're not going to do it,

3799
01:41:11,111 --> 01:41:12,190
where's Judy Tenuta?

3800
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:14,920
I want to see your weird shit.

3801
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:15,521
Yeah.

3802
01:41:15,521 --> 01:41:16,241
I'm here to see your,

3803
01:41:16,241 --> 01:41:17,560
your whole dirt.

3804
01:41:17,561 --> 01:41:18,660
You ever know.

3805
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:22,240
How do you go from doing that to
try to do just regular standup?

3806
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:26,230
I only give him shit because I know he
tells his opening acts not to swear.

3807
01:41:26,590 --> 01:41:27,423
Oh really?

3808
01:41:27,550 --> 01:41:27,841
Yeah.

3809
01:41:27,841 --> 01:41:30,190
Well I've heard from [inaudible].

3810
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:31,900
I don't know exactly.

3811
01:41:31,901 --> 01:41:32,800
I wasn't really there.

3812
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:35,760
They could have been a bunch
of bitter twats but uh,

3813
01:41:36,270 --> 01:41:37,600
I don't remember who it was.

3814
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:40,330
They said they got harassed
for being too dirty,

3815
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:41,403
opening for him.

3816
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:42,320
Man,

3817
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,153
that sucks.

3818
01:41:43,330 --> 01:41:44,350
I might've been half rotten.

3819
01:41:44,570 --> 01:41:46,210
I kinda wish I remember who it was,

3820
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:47,501
what happened to have her,

3821
01:41:47,501 --> 01:41:49,000
I've had it going to
get them back in here,

3822
01:41:49,001 --> 01:41:49,210
man.

3823
01:41:49,210 --> 01:41:51,610
I've had it said passive
aggressive love half Ron for it.

3824
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:51,791
I mean,

3825
01:41:51,791 --> 01:41:52,091
you know,

3826
01:41:52,091 --> 01:41:54,820
opening for somebody like say
fuck a Lotta and you're like,

3827
01:41:54,850 --> 01:41:55,181
Oh,

3828
01:41:55,181 --> 01:41:55,511
do I?

3829
01:41:55,511 --> 01:41:56,050
And they're like,

3830
01:41:56,050 --> 01:41:56,291
oh no,

3831
01:41:56,291 --> 01:41:56,471
no,

3832
01:41:56,471 --> 01:41:56,651
no,

3833
01:41:56,651 --> 01:41:57,221
that's not a thing.

3834
01:41:57,221 --> 01:41:57,660
And you're like,

3835
01:41:57,660 --> 01:42:01,890
you just made it a thing because
you just hinted as a thing in um,

3836
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:07,000
in Boston they used to like always decide
like headliners would decide who had

3837
01:42:07,001 --> 01:42:08,410
oh porn and they would,

3838
01:42:08,510 --> 01:42:08,811
you know,

3839
01:42:08,811 --> 01:42:09,591
there get him Outta here.

3840
01:42:09,591 --> 01:42:10,770
He breaks the fuck meter.

3841
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:11,201
It was like,

3842
01:42:11,201 --> 01:42:12,160
that was like the big thing.

3843
01:42:12,161 --> 01:42:15,850
They didn't want to go on
and after anybody dirty
because if you wanted to have

3844
01:42:15,851 --> 01:42:18,640
any sort of shock value
to your comedy whatsoever,

3845
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:21,370
but that just means your comedies on that.

3846
01:42:21,371 --> 01:42:21,720
Good.

3847
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:22,150
Yeah,

3848
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:23,150
that's how I always fell.

3849
01:42:23,151 --> 01:42:25,600
Sure the bass guys can
go on after Andy Body.

3850
01:42:25,601 --> 01:42:26,410
It doesn't matter.

3851
01:42:26,410 --> 01:42:27,140
I seen,

3852
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:27,640
yeah,

3853
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:28,473
it's just,

3854
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:30,730
especially when people know who they are.

3855
01:42:30,731 --> 01:42:35,500
Like I got a chance to see Hedberg a
bunch of times and I saw Hedberg in front

3856
01:42:35,501 --> 01:42:39,580
of people who are fans and I got to see
a Hedberg in front of people who had no

3857
01:42:39,581 --> 01:42:40,510
idea who he was.

3858
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:41,860
And it was a big difference.
