1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,560
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,190
Do you,

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,570
do you smoke pot with strangers?

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:04,170
No.

5
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:04,650
No.

6
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:05,400
Me Neither.

7
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:05,910
No,

8
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,210
I don't.

9
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,080
If I don't know he might.

10
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:07,330
It's,

11
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,580
it's too much risk.

12
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,570
Sorry.

13
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,530
I tell people I don't,

14
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,000
I quit smoking it really,

15
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,500
and I usually don't.

16
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,640
I have to really know where the
source of the weeders from before.

17
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,320
Before I'll accept it.

18
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,660
Then I'll give it friends of mine,

19
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:22,230
you know,

20
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,310
this is where I got this shit.

21
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:23,500
Yeah,

22
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,410
that's exactly what I do.

23
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,710
I'm like,

24
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,620
it's just certain people that
I get high with that I know.

25
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:28,981
But I mean,

26
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:29,880
it's unfortunate,

27
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:30,690
but I've had,

28
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,010
I know one guy that definitely came
up to me that was a cop in Cleveland.

29
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:35,910
I'm positive.

30
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,440
I just knew something was going on,

31
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,100
you know?

32
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,080
He's asking me where I could get DMT.

33
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:40,710
Oh,

34
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,610
and the way he was asked,

35
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:42,720
he said we had a crew cut.

36
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,830
I looked like a trend.

37
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,310
They did MMA and I'm looking
at this dude and I'm like,

38
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,203
you want what?

39
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,820
Strange guy that looks like a cop
asked me where to get illegal drugs.

40
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,380
I went when talking about,

41
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,200
I once had two cops work
their ass off for me.

42
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,233
It was funny,

43
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,250
I had a nightclub in Canada.

44
00:00:59,480 --> 00:00:59,810
Yeah,

45
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,060
we're teaching men.

46
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,150
And then I had to diet clubs in,

47
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:06,210
in one cut closed down and saw
it and they sold the building.

48
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:07,110
So then I moved,

49
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,340
I had a back room,

50
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:08,611
you know,

51
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:10,200
so I was fixing up a back room,

52
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,680
did take over the other club and next
thing you know I got to a man and a girl

53
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,740
with headbands,

54
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,650
they come up stairs and they're like,

55
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,480
they're not hippies by no means.

56
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:29,481
The headbands looked like a costume look
like they're going trick or treating it

57
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,181
like a,

58
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:31,830
this is how they dress swimming.

59
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:32,941
So he said,

60
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:33,381
so,

61
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:34,470
so what's going on up here?

62
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,281
And I said,

63
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:35,371
well,

64
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:36,540
I'm just putting the club together.

65
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:36,850
He says,

66
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,683
I need some help.

67
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:38,671
I said,

68
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:39,120
yeah,

69
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,020
actually I do.

70
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,981
And so,

71
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:41,670
okay,

72
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,190
so they're,

73
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,021
they're in there helping,

74
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:43,430
you know,

75
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,820
what were you thinking at this time?

76
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,190
I'm looking at him thinking,

77
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,591
wow,

78
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:47,350
I could use the help.

79
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,183
Who knows,

80
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,050
I'm not going to pay him anything.

81
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,540
You know,

82
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,670
maybe let them in the club leader pre,

83
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:53,881
you know,

84
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:57,960
so they're moving tables and
washing floors and so weird.

85
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,100
They just show up and start with work.

86
00:01:59,101 --> 00:01:59,341
Yeah,

87
00:01:59,341 --> 00:01:59,701
yeah,

88
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:00,001
yeah.

89
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:01,920
And they were working
and good workers too.

90
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,083
You know,

91
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,210
the more I look at him and I said,

92
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,053
these aren't hippies,

93
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,010
hippies will hide behind
a wall to see if the,

94
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,620
or they're working whole camera to here,

95
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,570
you know.

96
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,120
So.

97
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,260
So they worked and then
we had a little break,

98
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:16,561
you know,

99
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:17,790
and we're sitting around talking.

100
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,953
So I said,

101
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,461
where are you from?

102
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:20,741
Oh,

103
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:22,280
they're from Saskatchewan.

104
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,700
You have been here out here long.

105
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:23,851
Oh,

106
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,684
a couple of days.

107
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:25,891
So,

108
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:26,724
um,

109
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,601
so,

110
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:28,260
um,

111
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,521
it'd be up.

112
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:29,354
We've got high.

113
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,011
Oh yeah,

114
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:30,420
yeah,

115
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:30,661
yeah.

116
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:32,190
Get high on the time as well.

117
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,813
Ever done acid?

118
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,231
They said,

119
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:34,530
yeah.

120
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,100
Oh yeah.

121
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,791
I love acid.

122
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:36,330
Yeah.

123
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:36,520
Nice.

124
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:36,631
Well,

125
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:38,070
tell me about your first acid trip.

126
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,301
The guy goes,

127
00:02:39,301 --> 00:02:40,200
I don't remember.

128
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,550
He said,

129
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,971
I said,

130
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:45,570
just a minute,

131
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,520
I gotta go to the bathroom
and I went to the bathroom.

132
00:02:47,521 --> 00:02:48,510
I did a little dance.

133
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:49,590
Their carbs,

134
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,410
they're carbs through fucking cops.

135
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,360
That's hilarious.

136
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,151
I went back,

137
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:54,390
I said,

138
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,223
well let's get to work.

139
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,520
We got a lot of work to do here.

140
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,350
So you just put them to work.

141
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,100
So he scrubbed the floor,

142
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:00,431
man,

143
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,264
I had him,

144
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,060
there's head bedrooms
soaking wet with sweat man,

145
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,490
their work their ass off.

146
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,120
And then I got on the phone
and phoned everybody knew,

147
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,360
cause we used to say the door lady
used to sell weed right at the door.

148
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:17,990
Right.

149
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,330
That that does kind of club.

150
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,440
It was so,

151
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,830
so then the club filled up and
they stayed the whole time.

152
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,300
They didn't go home
and change or anything.

153
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:28,270
You've got their little headbands
or why or did they change?

154
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:28,451
No,

155
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:29,380
I think they did change.

156
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,213
They went home,

157
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,241
they okay,

158
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:32,140
we'll see you back later.

159
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,180
And then he came sat together
and they look like recruits.

160
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,730
We looked like recruits.

161
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:37,750
I mean they were so,

162
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,261
so,

163
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:39,250
so out of place.

164
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,760
And I told everybody is everybody
would walk by and like they were on on

165
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:43,594
display.

166
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,020
They just walk by and look at the
cubs they were looking at at and walk.

167
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,970
But it was so,

168
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:50,230
everybody kept an eye on them.

169
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,210
And if you wanted to smoke weed,

170
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,630
just made sure he knew
where the cops were.

171
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,110
Yeah.

172
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,321
Yeah.

173
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:53,860
Well,

174
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,281
first of all,

175
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:55,031
you don't do anything.

176
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:55,300
You know,

177
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,851
they're cops,

178
00:03:55,851 --> 00:03:55,990
so,

179
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,350
right.

180
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,460
So no one does anything.

181
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,510
So no one did anything.

182
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,030
[inaudible] Claire and the Lady,

183
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:01,530
you know,

184
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,300
all of a sudden that was
the cleanest club in town.

185
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,120
So now at the end,

186
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,830
did you ever let them know that
you knew they were calling?

187
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,270
No,

188
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,600
no,

189
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:09,781
no,

190
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:09,931
no,

191
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:10,140
no,

192
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,610
no,

193
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:10,871
no,

194
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:11,080
no.

195
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,761
Don't give that up.

196
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:12,280
I just went,

197
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,150
how'd you end the night?

198
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:13,541
Well,

199
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,320
they just left.

200
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,860
They just left.

201
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,800
They couldn't make a connection
and they knew they got spotted.

202
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,210
Yeah.

203
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,030
You know,

204
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,863
I'm cool.

205
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,831
You look cool.

206
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:22,030
But there's a lot of people that he,

207
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,000
a fucking car.

208
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,973
Okay.

209
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,981
Freaks and Geeks.

210
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:57,731
Lovers and children.

211
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:58,540
What's going on,

212
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,170
Ladies and gentlemen?
