00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,700

00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:02,983

00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:03,853

00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:04,851

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,370
So you want to play this on?

8
00:00:09,371 --> 00:00:12,460
I'm chanting like

9
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:12,970

11
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:13,551
No,

12
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:14,630
you don't have to clean up questions.

13
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:15,860
If you want to make the folks cry,

14
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,570
maybe we'll have a little yin and Yang.

15
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,290
A high and low whenever you want.

16
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,360
I'm going to put some Yang.

17
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,930
Can I make a request?

18
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,240
We may not be able to fulfill it,

19
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:27,320

21
00:00:27,921 --> 00:00:28,754
Not Possible.

22
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,380
Um,

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,261
Here we go.

34
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:41,094
Here we go.

35
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,080
I'm going to try something.

36
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,490
That's one of the cool things about music.

37
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,990
You guys can take requests,

38
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,730

39
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,840
Wouldn't play this in a while.

40
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,070
I really try not to mess it.

41
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,210
Let's just Thunderpussy that.

42
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,510
That kind of requests is great.

43
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,723
Maybe you just play

44
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:58,590

45
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,040
Okay.

46
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,700
What can we do it in GI?

47
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:00,920
Yeah.

48
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,753

Oh shit.

We got through that one.

75
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,111
Yeah,

76
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:50,100
that was great.

77
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,020
I love that fucking song.

78
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,621
That was bad.

79
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:54,270
A house.

80
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,103
Holy Shit.

81
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,880
