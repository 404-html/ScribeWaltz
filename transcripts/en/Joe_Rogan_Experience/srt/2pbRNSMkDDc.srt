1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:01,660
Okay.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,493
Dave Smith,
president of the Kanye West Fan club is 

3
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:07,900
here.
Comic Dave Smith on twitter,

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,030
tweeting pictures of your Dick.
He loves them.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,220
I love Kanye and Dick Pics.
I'm glad we got that APP was Hirsi Dude,

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,710
thanks for doing this because I loved 
you on Ari's podcast man.

7
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:19,390
You were fucking awesome on it.
It was really cool.

8
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:22,000
It was very,
it was a welcome surprise,

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:22,941
you know,
not that already.

10
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:26,140
He's a podcast is not always awesome.
It's always awesome.

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,951
But it was like,
damn,

12
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:27,784
this dude needs a lot of political shit.
And you knew about the Hillary Clinton 

13
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:37,170
thing with the a rape trial that she was
involved in defending the guy looks.

14
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:41,980
Paul explain it because it's,
it's a fucked up story and I want to get

15
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:42,520
it wrong.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,410
Okay,
so Hilary Clinton,

17
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,870
this is way back when she was a criminal
defense attorney.

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,280
She got a a child rapist off and a real 
bad one.

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,380
It wasn't one of those good child 
rapists.

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,293
It was a real way.
But it was like jared bang and 15 year 

21
00:00:57,871 --> 00:01:00,690
olds who was making sandwiches,
you know,

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,790
gives you a picture pickles,
you suck his dick.

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,270
But even like,
you know,

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,113
you heard like the,
the way Michael Jackson was accused of 

25
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:09,840
raping,
boy,

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,790
that was like the nicest way you could 
rape a kid.

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,000
It was like take him to an amusement 
park.

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,463
Yeah.
Talk and I show him the Lama and the 

29
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:19,500
Monkey.
All right.

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,150
Child rape is bad.
Let me start with that.

31
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:22,530
Horrible.
The worst thing ever.

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,580
Kanye,
Dick Pics.

33
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:25,190
Good,
bad.

34
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,300
Just want to be clear on where I stand.

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,400
Uh,
but so sheet,

36
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:30,510
so this guy,
uh,

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,553
um,
basically raped a 12 year old girl and 

38
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:39,441
really brutal the details of the story 
and she defended the guy and there's a,

39
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:44,190
there's tape of her in an interview 
talking about this years later now.

40
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:45,360
It's still,
it's back in the day.

41
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:47,640
It's when Hillary Clinton's doing like a
southern accent.

42
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,610
There's been like six different Hillary 
Clinton's that have existed.

43
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,160
This was the southern wife of Bill 
Clinton.

44
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:53,994
Hillary when she was,
when he was the mayor or governor of 

45
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:59,400
Arkansas.
So was that early eighties?

46
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,840
Yeah,
somewhere around that,

47
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,160
around that time period.
I'm not sure.

48
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:04,110
I'm not sure precisely where the tape is
from.

49
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,050
Um,
but she is,

50
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,280
I mean it's,
it's,

51
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,140
there's,
there's a lot of videos I could point to

52
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:10,921
online that's,
I think,

53
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,350
strong evidence that Hillary Clinton is 
a sociopath.

54
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,270
Um,
I'm personally convinced of that.

55
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,880
Now I'm not a professional and I can't 
diagnose her,

56
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,790
but this video is really up to,
I mean,

57
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:21,624
she's laughing about the details of the 
rape case and how she got the guy off 

58
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,240
and she laughs about how funny it is 
when,

59
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:31,074
when she basically admits that she knew 
the guy was guilty because she's going 

60
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:34,921
like,
oh,

61
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:38,730
we convinced the jury it was a big 
miscarriage of justice and she's,

62
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,610
she says that he took a polygraph and,
and passed it.

63
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,030
And then she says that forever destroyed
my belief in polygraphs.

64
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,270
So she's basically saying,
I know this guy raped this,

65
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,510
this little girl.
But we were able to get them off and she

66
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:55,380
laughs about having the,
the bloody underwear as the big piece of

67
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:56,131
evidence.
I mean,

68
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:57,630
it's really,
really intense.

69
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,100
Intense,
awful shit.

70
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,980
And what's really

71
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,160
crazy about it is that in this world of 
like,

72
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:03,994
you know,
rape culture and Social Justice Warrior 

73
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:10,630
liberal outrage there is just deafening 
silence when it comes to the Clintons.

74
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,620
Do you think it's a lack of information?
Because most people don't go looking for

75
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:16,570
this stuff for stuff like what you're 
talking about.

76
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,150
Most people have to find it on Fox News 
and go,

77
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,860
what?
Outrageous.

78
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,963
They don't go looking for it.
Cause there's a lot you'd have to look 

79
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:24,604
through.
I mean you'd have to go through all the 

80
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,254
Whitewater stuff,
you'd have to go through all that Vince 

81
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:29,130
foster stuff.
You'd have to try to find,

82
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,470
and there's a lot of like weird stuff 
about them in their past that you'd have

83
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:34,290
to sort through.
How much of this is legit,

84
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,550
how much has it,
most people aren't going to do that.

85
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,830
And so it's,
it's not being discussed and you'll have

86
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:40,710
to filter out like that just nonsense.

87
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,553
Cause that's,
that's the problem with where we're at 

88
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:44,530
now is that the truth is out in the 
Internet,

89
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:47,170
but it's sandwiched in between a whole 
bunch of nonsense.

90
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,120
And so you've got to like get that out 
of the way.

91
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,700
And the conspiracy theorists would say 
that nonsense is there on purpose.

92
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:52,991
Yes,
that's right.

93
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:55,050
Because everybody,
every conspiracy theorist,

94
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,280
as it turns out,
when I read more conspiracy theorist,

95
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:58,114
it turns out they were just working for 
the conspiracy and they're against like 

96
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:01,564
Alex Jones.
They all think now is working to tryst 

97
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,470
me.
Alison is my friend.

98
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,140
He's just crazy.
There's no CIA involved there.

99
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,403
Well,
that's a fun thing when you get into 

100
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,890
stuff that people think is a conspiracy 
and then you're like,

101
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,331
oh no,
no,

102
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:16,810
no.
It's just a crazy guy.

103
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,703
Well,
I've heard conspiracies that involve me 

104
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,800
and so when I hear that I go,
oh,

105
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:21,471
I see how you,
I've,

106
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:23,830
I've read some shit about me being a CIA
agent.

107
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:24,551
Like,
yeah,

108
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:25,384
what a circuitous route I took.
I went from kickboxing to standup 

109
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,190
comedy.
All the while,

110
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:33,520
secretly undercover for the CIA are 
going to plant them in news radio.

111
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:35,890
And before you know it,
he'll be leading public opinion.

112
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,280
Dude,
here's how even funnier one I have Eddie

113
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,960
Bravo thinks that it's perhaps possible 
perhaps that Laurel Canyon was all about

114
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:44,794
a CIA psyops and Jim Morrison and all 
these music music musical in the middle 

115
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:53,140
of saying musicians musical,
powerful La Pot,

116
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,700
that they were all a part of some CIA 
plan to,

117
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,380
uh,
to like the institute,

118
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:01,750
the drug movement.
Like I don't even understand the plan,

119
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,410
but the idea is that all these 
influential people came out of the,

120
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:06,244
this Laurel Canyon area and Jim 
Morrison's dad was in the CIA and light 

121
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:12,940
take is like Jesus Christ.
Do you know how much fucking,

122
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,080
how busy CIA dads are?
They're never around for their kid.

123
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,600
Of course,
the kid grows up to be Jim Morrison.

124
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,810
It's not that like the dad was there 
influencing him with a fucking hypnosis,

125
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,223
one of those watches.
You are going to be the voice of a 

126
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:29,550
generation,
right?

127
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,420
It's not no one engineer or something 
like that.

128
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,070
All things being equal,
it's best to look at the,

129
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,390
the most simple answer.
Right,

130
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,100
but outcomes razor.
Right,

131
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,900
exactly.
Uh,

132
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,733
I do think like,
I feel like with a lot of those 

133
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:44,770
conspiracy theorists like my take on it 
is like you,

134
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,650
you have like the government who,
it's almost like if the government was a

135
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:49,000
person,
you could be like,

136
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:49,834
okay,
we've got them on murdering these 50 

137
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:51,874
people and we have it cold hard.
They clearly did it and then you're 

138
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:54,761
like,
yeah,

139
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:57,620
but I heard a rumor that they also 
murdered another people.

140
00:05:57,621 --> 00:05:58,010
I'm like,

141
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,080
can we just focus on what we know?
They do it right.

142
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,940
Like we're slaughtering people in the 
Middle East.

143
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:02,774
We don't need a makeup.
All this other nonsense just to make it 

144
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,950
more sellable.
Well,

145
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:10,190
it's this,
this idea that we're being controlled.

146
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,110
That's the one that's the,
that's the overlying theme I guess,

147
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,090
or the over.
It's,

148
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,943
it's,
if you look at like all of the 

149
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:20,654
conspiracies,
whether their chem trails or whether 

150
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:25,490
it's all about like engineering,
like global warming.

151
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:28,220
It's like Geo Engineering.
There's all this,

152
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,113
it's all about engineering friends.
It's all about people that are worried 

153
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,720
about eugenics.
They want,

154
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,990
like Alex Jones says they want to kill 
five.

155
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,400
They want to leave 500 million people 
worldwide or something like that,

156
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,050
like this fucking number.
I was like,

157
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:42,591
Whoa,
Whoa,

158
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:43,221
Whoa,
whoa.

159
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:46,130
I think going to be a mortal like did 
they know what the fuck they're doing?

160
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:46,910
Like you,
you really,

161
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,230
you really think that this is a plan.

162
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,770
Kill everyone except half a million.
Look,

163
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:55,070
I do think there's some really shady 
plans that are up there at the top.

164
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,350
I think what they get wrong sometimes is
they think that,

165
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,184
um,
that everything that's happening was 

166
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,044
actually controlled from the top.
I think there's plans that people in it 

167
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,163
like to build a bear group is real.
That exists and I think they do want to 

168
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:10,610
control the world,
but I think more often than not,

169
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,970
they have like 10 things they want to 
do.

170
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,010
Some of them work out,
some of them don't.

171
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,993
Then they roll with the punches on that.
Then they try to change things from 

172
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:20,024
there.
It's not as perfect as like everything 

173
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,130
they did worked out perfectly and was,
but you know,

174
00:07:25,131 --> 00:07:27,260
it's a little easier.
It's more,

175
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,790
it's more of a fun story.
If they're just an ultimate control,

176
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,240
well then the have that number,
the 500 million number,

177
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,650
like why is,
how do you know that number?

178
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,110
It's specific.
This is what I heard.

179
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:40,970
500 million.
Oh Wow.

180
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,833
Wonder if I'd make the cut,
but it still thinking about all the 

181
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,160
billions of people and it could.
500 million's not that much.

182
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:46,994
If you think about 7 billion,
but they're probably going to come off 

183
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,163
Indians and Oliver's,
you start to think whether you could 

184
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:52,184
make the cut and my top 500 million,
if they're going to leave 500 million 

185
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:57,470
people and the planet,
this room,

186
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:58,850
there's some wiggle room.
They're like,

187
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,860
okay,
you're going to need like 60 comedians.

188
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,180
Did you want to get in though?
I mean,

189
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,860
what are they going to do with all those
bodies?

190
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,560
What are I going to do at six and a half
billion of bodies?

191
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:09,320
How bad is the earth going to smell for 
like a month?

192
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,521
Right?
Yeah.

193
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:12,380
That's a good point too.
It's a very good point.

194
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:13,460
I have these guys thought this through.

195
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,200
I don't think there's hot the wall and 
not only that,

196
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:17,830
but what did you kill the wrong people?
What if the people that you kill,

197
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,200
we're going to figure out a way to cure 
cancer or get us to Mars or you don't.

198
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,940
You just can't.
But that's why that whole,

199
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,803
that's why believing,
which is a much more common belief out 

200
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,250
of the conspiracy thing,
but believing that populations a problem

201
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,870
is,
is crazy because like you said,

202
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:31,630
you never know when that you know,
they,

203
00:08:31,631 --> 00:08:33,770
they'll like uh,
environmentalist.

204
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:34,461
There'll be like,
well,

205
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:37,460
if we have too many people and there's 
two big carbon footprint,

206
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,031
if you're like,
yeah,

207
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:41,690
except until we have the one person who 
figures out how to save all of us.

208
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,710
Right.
And then that got,

209
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:44,720
you know,
you need a bunch of people to get that.

210
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:47,070
You don't get that in a village with log
cabins.

211
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,913
That's right.
They don't figure out how to fix the 

212
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,394
world.
They just don't heed millions of people 

213
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:53,390
that need to live in cities.
Food needs to be delivered to them.

214
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:55,830
They need to be safe and then they can 
up with ideas.

215
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:59,400
This thing is a game of numbers.
You to have mad,

216
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:01,260
mad numbers man.
We got to throw a lot.

217
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,353
Oh,
I did want to address what you asked 

218
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:04,440
before.
La Pod is powerful.

219
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,410
Powerful what you said before when 
you're talking about this stuff with the

220
00:09:07,411 --> 00:09:09,390
Clinton uh,
tape and you said,

221
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:10,220
why,
uh,

222
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,710
why is it that people are,
they need to find the information.

223
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,300
I think there is some of that,
right?

224
00:09:15,301 --> 00:09:18,510
Because say if they made this a story on
the news,

225
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,210
like if every day they were playing,
they had,

226
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,253
it's amazing the power that media has to
choose what story we're going to make 

227
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,750
the story and what story will maybe get 
mentioned here and then fallen,

228
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,300
you know,
Fade into obscurity so they could,

229
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,700
the media could make that a story that 
everyone has to deal with.

230
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:40,510
But I've found there's a lot of denial.
Like when I talk to liberals or,

231
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:44,550
or Hillary supporters and I'll bring 
that stuff up and there's a lot of like,

232
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,740
yeah,
well whatever.

233
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,480
Exactly.
Well whatever.

234
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:49,314
But the same people who are like,
we live in a rape culture and we'll go 

235
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,720
after like tosh for making a joke in bad
taste.

236
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,873
And then you're like,
well here's this woman laughing about 

237
00:09:57,751 --> 00:09:58,584
getting a child rapist off.
Forget some abstract contributing to 

238
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:04,080
rape culture,
contributing to rape culture,

239
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:04,914
getting a rapist who would've gone to 
jail back out into the streets and 

240
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:08,454
they'll,
so it's like,

241
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,293
to me a mix of the media doesn't do 
their job and then people are also kind 

242
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:15,360
of in denial.
Well people are intensely tribal,

243
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,090
intensely tribal and their support for 
brands,

244
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,850
you know,
forget about political parties,

245
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,760
political parties,
oftentimes the most tribal,

246
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I mean I follow people that all they do 
is mock liberals online and then I fall.

247
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,773
Other people we're,
all they do is mock conservatives and 

248
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,410
God they're so similar or the same 
fucking people.

249
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,820
There's atheism and then there's these 
people that are super religious.

250
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,550
There's all this God Christian stuff on 
the right.

251
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,310
And then on the left it's like atheism 
is their God.

252
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,930
And I don't mean it in there,
God is like,

253
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,040
it's,
it's an actual religion.

254
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:50,874
Their fault.
I mean you almost kind of have to be in 

255
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:54,114
that group to be on that side.
It's this weird thing that's going on 

256
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,110
where you've got people that are 
subscribing to atheism.

257
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,090
Nothing wrong with atheism.
It's not what I'm saying.

258
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,103
I'm just saying God is,
it's so universal on the left that it 

259
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:10,560
seems to me to be a trait that you 
attribute with this tribe.

260
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,660
Like almost like you have to accept this
trait.

261
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,490
Right?
And then I think,

262
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,593
and I guess that's maybe a criticism I 
have of a like Sam Harris and that's 

263
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,703
about,
I know you had him on your show 

264
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:20,784
recently,
but I think a lot of those guys who got 

265
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:22,884
themselves in this camp of we're the 
atheists or the ones committed to 

266
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:27,690
rational thought and religion is 
terrible.

267
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,060
And now if the,
they'll look at things like,

268
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:30,660
uh,
the,

269
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,490
the wars in the Middle East and it just 
seems like,

270
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,353
to me it seems like they have a tendency
to always try to blame the religiously 

271
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:37,434
motivated violence because I think 
they've kind of got themselves on like 

272
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,600
team anti-religion.
We're on team atheist,

273
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,620
so the Muslims have to be worse than the
American military because they're,

274
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:47,454
the religious ones were like 
sophisticated and advanced and 

275
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,753
everything about the,
the u s military is built on like 

276
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:54,280
science and reason and thought.

277
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,263
And the,
these are crazy Muslims who are just 

278
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,780
maniacs.
So we have to blame them.

279
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,900
Even though if you look at the numbers 
of dead,

280
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,430
it's pretty staggeringly one side,
like we're murdering them.

281
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,370
Not only that,
we're also in where they live.

282
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,770
So that has to be taken into account.
When we had to get there,

283
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:13,120
we had to go there.
I understand,

284
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,020
but let's just look at the actual facts 
cause it's not cassie judge.

285
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:18,220
Let's look at the facts.
We are where they live.

286
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,620
Um,
we don't speak their language.

287
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,200
We come in and mass and we kill a fuck 
load.

288
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,034
More people than they do.
And the a good percentage of the people 

289
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,870
that are in the military.
Christian,

290
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,120
yes,
very decent size.

291
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,050
Uh,
a very,

292
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,933
a very big percentage.
And then a very big percentage of like 

293
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:38,510
the hardcore supporters,
the people like who are really hardcore,

294
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:41,200
the evangelical base that voted for 
George W.

295
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,380
Bush.

296
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,213
A big part of that support is this goofy
religious belief that we need to be pro 

297
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:47,824
Israel because the Jews need to be in 
Israel and that's what then Jesus can 

298
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:54,730
come back for us and if some Muslims got
to get slaughtered in the process,

299
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,970
well this is how it's supposed to go,
so we got to protect that.

300
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,310
There's a lot of that weird shit on our 
side as well.

301
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,620
A lot of weird old southern money that 
goes into that.

302
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,573
Yeah,
there's a great vice piece on those 

303
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:07,600
people.
There's a great vice piece where they,

304
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:08,890
I forget,
you know,

305
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,170
vice has someone in those online shows 
that are awesome.

306
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:12,004
It's hard to know which one it was,
but they went with these people to 

307
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:16,744
Israel,
these crazy evangelicals who are going 

308
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:20,260
back to the motherland and it's like 
they were like,

309
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:22,300
well,
this is where Jesus is going to camp.

310
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,403
You know,
this is where we're going to set up his 

311
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:27,340
fire here and he'll pull his trailer in 
right here like they had,

312
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,203
it was almost like that and his head,
like he was setting up to Budweiser's 

313
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,760
one from me,
one for Jesus when he gets here.

314
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,710
Weird,
weird.

315
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,730
But you if you're on the right,
like even Gavin McInnes who I love,

316
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,690
I love Gavin Love Gavin.
Gavin's a bright,

317
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:46,750
bright guy,
but he's also a Catholic and he became a

318
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:48,820
Catholic like late in life.
So I'm like,

319
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:50,410
what are you doing?
Like what do you,

320
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:51,244
what is this like you,
it's almost like you have to be a part 

321
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:57,070
of something that's religious to get in 
on the right side.

322
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,270
Like a Glenn Beck became a Mormon when 
he was like 50 like,

323
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:02,410
hey dude,
come on.

324
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:03,244
Did you even read it?
Did you read any of the history about 

325
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:08,260
Joseph Smith being 14 when he made all 
this shit up?

326
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,633
Magic seer stone that he had to use to 
read the golden tablets that contained 

327
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:16,000
the loss work of Jesus that only he 
could read with this rock.

328
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,403
I'm torn between whether I hate 
mormonism for that or I love them for 

329
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:20,410
that.
I'm like,

330
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,610
Hey,
if we're going to bullshit,

331
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,470
let's just go bullshit.
Like,

332
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:24,250
yeah,
Jesus,

333
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,810
he lives in Kansas.
I don't know.

334
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,580
He was friends with my grandpa.
Why not?

335
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,443
Well,
the American Indians were actually from 

336
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:30,970
Israel.
That was another one of his,

337
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,700
that this guy spent a ton of money.
Um,

338
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,563
you know,
we were talking with when Sam was here 

339
00:14:35,771 --> 00:14:36,604
the other day,
we were talking about how 15 years ago 

340
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:40,690
it was like billions of dollars to get 
your genome map.

341
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,170
Now it's like a couple thousand bucks.
And we were talking about how crazy that

342
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:46,120
is.
Like what would an insane leap,

343
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,940
well,
a few years back,

344
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,170
one of the,
before it became that cheap,

345
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,240
some dudes spent a fuck ton of money.

346
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,380
It was a mormon to try to prove that the
Morman scriptures were in fact correct.

347
00:14:57,381 --> 00:14:58,214
And the American Indians did come.
But we learned from that actually it's 

348
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:04,010
actually want up being good for science 
because these guys spent so much money,

349
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,210
we realized,
no,

350
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,163
they actually came from Siberia.
So reinforces the idea of them crossing 

351
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:09,584
the landmass,
the bering strait and coming into 

352
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,140
America from Asia.
So they are Siberian like it's,

353
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:15,970
it's,
it's interesting like the,

354
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,470
the,
the merge or the,

355
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:19,304
um,
the movement and migration of people 

356
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:23,960
from Asia to North America and down into
Mexico.

357
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:27,290
And if it's really fucking cool when you
find out that it's not that long ago,

358
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,940
well,
a few thousand years,

359
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,410
you know,
at the most 20,

360
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,960
you know,
whatever it was like during the ice age.

361
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,010
It's not that long ago,
man.

362
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:34,791
It's,
it's crazy.

363
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:35,624
A history is a weird thing like that.
Like even when we talk about thing and 

364
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,510
you know,
you'd be like World War II,

365
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:40,040
World War Two was like that long ago.

366
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,380
Like your grandfather was there and like
that's,

367
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:43,910
that's,
that's just happened.

368
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,630
Just happened historically.
You have Vietnam and how about Vietnam?

369
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,673
There's one that this conspiracy 
theories can really grab a hold of the 

370
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:51,951
Gulf of Tonkin.
Well,

371
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:52,490
yeah,
like Wah.

372
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,323
That's,
but that's my point when before it's 

373
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:54,734
like,
why are we even wasting our time with 

374
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:55,964
anything else?
Right.

375
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,850
Let's grab that one and hold on to that 
one.

376
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,520
That was bullshit.
We know that was bullshit.

377
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,670
Tens of thousands of Americans died in 
that war,

378
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:06,940
let alone how many Vietnamese we just 
slot.

379
00:16:06,941 --> 00:16:07,774
It was just like mass slaughter that 
people made billions off of that was 

380
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,950
bullshit.
Bullshit.

381
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,780
Bullshit.
You don't need anymore.

382
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,760
We flag attack.
Yeah.

383
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,550
Look it up folks.
I mean if you're listening to this going

384
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:20,384
what you sitting on your porch and 
Georgia with your lemonade hating black 

385
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:27,440
people just go online and it's fun.
I get it.

386
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,380
He doesn't want to sit on their porch 
with lemonade and hate black people.

387
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,340
I know.
I do.

388
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,970
If you,
if you really do read that story,

389
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:36,290
it's horrific.
And then you realize,

390
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,340
oh well this was deception was the rule 
of the land at that time.

391
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,680
This was when they had the operation 
northwoods,

392
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,900
um,
thing that had been passed.

393
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:47,330
And if you haven't seen that document,
that's crazy.

394
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,583
They,
this was signed by the Joint Chiefs of 

395
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:50,534
staff and then vetoed by Kennedy where 
they were going to attack American 

396
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:55,220
civilians.
They were going to bomb,

397
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,233
they were going to bomb Guantanamo Bay,
they were going to arm Cuban friendlies 

398
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,820
and they were going to give them weapons
to attack Guantanamo Bay.

399
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,300
They were going to blow a drone jetliner
out of the sky,

400
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,440
blame it on Castro and wind up killing a
ton of people.

401
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,470
And they were doing it all just to get 
support of this idea of attacking Cuba.

402
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,390
So they were going to pretend that all 
these people died,

403
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,121
you know,
and,

404
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:18,920
and just,
you know,

405
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,731
we're going to add,
I don't know,

406
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:22,500
how could they take off in a plane that 
then,

407
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,770
I'm not sure where the drone technology 
was that,

408
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:26,060
but this was the plan.
I mean it was,

409
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:28,520
it was a plan that I think Kennedy 
himself had to,

410
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,550
had to veto but not sign off on it or 
whatever.

411
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,660
Um,
and you know,

412
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:35,150
they took care of him quickly,
allegedly.

413
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,160
That's the other conspiracy,
right?

414
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,773
Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone,
seems to me to be even a dumber 

415
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,623
conspiracy.
Then there was a bunch of people 

416
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:43,454
involved killing that guy.
Couldn't agree with you more on that 

417
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:45,701
one.
But it's,

418
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:46,534
it's just the,
the north would think it's just a 

419
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:49,260
fascinating,
you know,

420
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:49,980
glimpse into

421
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,710
the mindset of the people who are,
who are on the inside,

422
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:56,190
who really do view the world as,
as pawns on a chess board.

423
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,360
And if,
you know,

424
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,243
uh,
if a lie is what it took to get the 

425
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:03,930
geopolitical result that they wanted and
some Americans had to die or whatever,

426
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,490
that's not a big deal.
And,

427
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,710
and I think people should be aware of 
that.

428
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,160
Like anyone,
a lot of times,

429
00:18:09,161 --> 00:18:11,340
like you were talking about getting in 
the team mentality,

430
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,350
people kind of have this team mentality 
and they're like,

431
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:14,184
well,
they don't,

432
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,143
you know,
if someone's willing to just slaughter 

433
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:19,110
people in a third world country to make 
their buddies rich,

434
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,960
I'd be careful with them around your 
kids too.

435
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,840
You know,
like they're,

436
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,440
they're probably looking at everybody 
like their pawns on a board,

437
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:26,820
not just those guys.
Yeah,

438
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:31,110
I think people learn really quickly how 
to disassociate.

439
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,273
They learn how to not think about that.
Especially when you're using like drone 

440
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:35,694
technology and stuff.
You're flying a robot and shooting 

441
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:40,830
missiles out of a robot.
And you're watching it all on a screen.

442
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,010
How easy is it to distance yourself from
that if you're the person,

443
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:47,100
not even he's pushing the button,
but who gave the order to give the,

444
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:48,360
okay.
You know,

445
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,194
and when I talked to Ed,
Mike Baker on here was a former CIA 

446
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,254
operative.
I had been on a few Fox News shows with 

447
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:54,114
him.
He told me all that stuff is done by 

448
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:56,700
lawyers.
They all decided like,

449
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:58,150
can we do this?
Can we do this?

450
00:18:58,151 --> 00:18:58,984
And the lawyer sit down,
they hash it out and they give him the 

451
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:01,440
green light or the red light.
I'm like,

452
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:05,880
Whoa,
that is fucking dark when you're leaving

453
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:06,714
military matters.
And whether or not you attack with a 

454
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:09,534
flying robot to lawyers,
arguably the most heartless creatures 

455
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,570
I've ever created in our capitalist 
society.

456
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,890
Well that's that.
And by the way,

457
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:19,600
that's who's running government.
It's all lawyers do it.

458
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,473
Hillary Clinton is,
was that Obama is what Michelle Obama 

459
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:23,070
is.
But Bill Clinton was,

460
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:24,090
I mean,
that's what they all are.

461
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:26,490
They're all lawyers,
great lawyers.

462
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,200
There's awesome people out there that 
are lawyers.

463
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,063
That's not what I'm saying.
But even if you're an awesome person 

464
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:33,240
that's a lawyer,
you fucking know some psychos.

465
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:34,074
Let me tell you,
the awesome person who was a lawyer is 

466
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:36,180
the most adamant,
like,

467
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:38,760
do not put lawyers in charge.
Do your job.

468
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,421
Do you not?
That's like,

469
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:40,231
look,
I'm a comedian.

470
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:41,064
But if you were like,
should comedians being charged or it'd 

471
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:43,140
be like Jesus,
no,

472
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,330
we won't.
We won't make it through this podcast.

473
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,070
Yeah.
They shouldn't be in charge of anything.

474
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,420
Even comedy.
We shouldn't be in charge.

475
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,540
Yeah,
exactly right.

476
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,190
Cause then you get like these salt 
rooms,

477
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,540
they get mad at you if you talk loud.

478
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,180
But like when people are in charge of 
anything they fuck.

479
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,310
Oh yeah.
But uh,

480
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,450
you were talking about the drone wars.
Um,

481
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,750
there's,
this guy is brilliant historian,

482
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,440
Tom Woods.
I don't know if you've heard of him,

483
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,560
but he's got a great podcast.
He's incredible.

484
00:20:07,561 --> 00:20:11,760
This guy like I to me,
like maybe like the smartest libertarian

485
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,440
voice out there.
What's his podcast called?

486
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,630
It's called the Tom Woods show.
Oh yeah.

487
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,590
You should,
you would love him.

488
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,230
I think he would be great on you.
I didn't know he had a podcast.

489
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,810
He's got a podcast.
He's just a brilliant historian.

490
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:25,080
He nails all this stuff,
but he uses this analogy and I love it.

491
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,090
Uh,
he just goes through,

492
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:29,700
imagine we,
we used the drone campaign,

493
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,250
like imagine we,
we fought crime that way.

494
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:32,941
So,
you know,

495
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,500
imagine there'd be like,
someone was like a,

496
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,010
so we've got,
um,

497
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:41,330
to suspected criminals at a wedding in,
in,

498
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,800
you know,
California somewhere.

499
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,743
And I go,
so the plan is we're going to bomb the 

500
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:47,214
wedding.

501
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,280
Everybody just be like,
oh,

502
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,650
that's not okay.
You can't do that because there's,

503
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,250
there's innocent human life there.
But literally we,

504
00:20:57,251 --> 00:20:59,800
that's just how we conduct the war in 
the Middle East.

505
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,733
Yeah.
But they don't,

506
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,090
it's sort of disingenuous because they 
don't know it's a wedding.

507
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,050
They just see a group of people gathered
and then they know that the dickheads in

508
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:10,840
there and they want to blow them up.
And then it turns out to be a wedding.

509
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:12,460
And we were like,
Oh shit.

510
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,893
Okay.
So still the analogy say that's how we 

511
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,621
fought crime.
Here we go.

512
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:21,160
But we just followed the metadata on 
your cell phones and wherever you happen

513
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:23,170
to be,
we're going to blow that place up.

514
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,243
Yeah.
That's what's important to point out 

515
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,014
too,
is that they're shooting at phones and 

516
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,890
then they don't even have a visual id on
the person.

517
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,140
They,
they find where the phone is.

518
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,093
They do the find my iphone feature with 
the eye in the sky and then they launch 

519
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,370
aptly named Hellfire missile at it.
That's dark too,

520
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,250
that they have cool nicknames for their 
missiles.

521
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,830
Hell fire.
Oh Dude.

522
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,700
They do all this shit.
Well,

523
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:50,200
although like you're saying like the 
operation names,

524
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,030
operation kick ass,
I said,

525
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,480
Jesus Christ,
it's just fucking 18 year olds blast and

526
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:02,500
ACDC rolling through some time in town.
It's like Jesus.

527
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,343
Well have you ever seen those pieces 
that they've done on those kids that 

528
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:08,590
were,
were involved in operating those tanks?

529
00:22:08,591 --> 00:22:10,690
It would listen to metal.
I mean that's,

530
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,703
that's bizarre too.
You're letting these kids get jacked up 

531
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:17,080
on metal and who knows what else you let
them have.

532
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,580
They probably let them have 
amphetamines.

533
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:22,120
They definitely let them have steroids.
They give steroids to soldiers.

534
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,880
That's,
that's common shit man.

535
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,530
There's a reason they prefer an 18 year 
old to a 30 year old.

536
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:27,843
There's a reason they prefer someone who
is still just as good fighting shape or 

537
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:30,610
whatever,
you know,

538
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:33,120
essentially.
But then when you're 18 you're,

539
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:35,680
you're in a different place,
your levels are at a different place and

540
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:38,050
your,
your willingness to follow orders,

541
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,910
I think as a mother is in a different 
place.

542
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,540
We're all essentially like,
you know,

543
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,940
older people being wiser if they've had 
enough experiences.

544
00:22:45,941 --> 00:22:46,774
But we're all gathering experiences,
gathering experiences and then 

545
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,520
calculating,
trying to figure out,

546
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:51,430
okay,
why did that go wrong?

547
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,710
Well what does that,
oh here's that fucking thing again.

548
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,810
Oh here's this thought,
let's see how it goes.

549
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,893
And that's why as people get older,
they get less and less tolerant of 

550
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:01,270
certain things because they see these 
things over and over and over again.

551
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,660
And they recognize these patterns.
You get more confident in your assertion

552
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:07,420
of that pattern cause you're like,
I've seen this bullshit six times now.

553
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,270
I know.
And it works that way with politics too.

554
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,113
Like,
that's the common expression about 

555
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:12,400
radicals in college.
You know,

556
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:13,234
a,
show me a young man who's not a liberal 

557
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:15,454
and I'll show you a man without a heart.
Show me an old man is on a conservative 

558
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,510
and I'll show you a man without a brain,
right?

559
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,640
Because after to why you go,
ah,

560
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,530
I see.
You know,

561
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:25,420
and it's not black and white when it 
comes to that issue,

562
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:28,900
but when you're,
you're dealing with something that,

563
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,530
you know,
a human being that gathers up this data.

564
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,870
When you were 18,
what do you got?

565
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,870
A couple of fucking birthday parties.
You remember the first time you get your

566
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:39,710
Dick sucked was only six months ago.
Like,

567
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,050
what do you remember?
What do you,

568
00:23:41,051 --> 00:23:42,550
what do you have to base on?
What do you,

569
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:43,570
what do you know?
Movies.

570
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,010
You watch a lot of movies.
That's probably what they're basing

571
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,843
it on.
What they think their life's going to 

572
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,130
be.
Some fucking Tom Hanks movie,

573
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,830
they'll come back and cry to their kids 
when they're younger,

574
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,330
when they're older,
rather about the,

575
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,164
you know,
I served in the war of serving my 

576
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:56,330
country.
Did my country proud.

577
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,580
Now you're,
you might go home with no legs.

578
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:01,400
Like you're in a crazy situation where 
you're killing people.

579
00:24:01,401 --> 00:24:02,234
You don't know because someone you don't
know told you you're supposed to kill 

580
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:06,620
people you don't know.
And a lot of them figure it out.

581
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,483
It's just they figured out when they see
that real shit that you're talking 

582
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:09,861
about.
Cause you know,

583
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:11,480
there is also,
that's another thing that's very,

584
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:13,320
very downplayed.
But uh,

585
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,183
that should have been maybe the biggest 
story in at least one of the biggest 

586
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:17,864
stories in the last 10 years is that Ron
Paul in 2000 in the 2008 run and in the 

587
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,640
2012 Ryan both runs,
he got more money,

588
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,900
more donations from active duty military
people than all of the other candidates.

589
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,853
He got more than the,
all the Republican candidates combined 

590
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:37,250
in 2012 and he got he outraised uh,
Barack Obama both times.

591
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:40,490
So it's like there's actually a lot of 
people in this military,

592
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,383
in the military who see through this 
bullshit and we're very happy to have 

593
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:45,404
like the only,
I mean Ron Paul to me is like the only 

594
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,543
politician on a presidential level in 
recent memory who has been 

595
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,693
unapologetically antiwar and not just 
not just like this hasn't worked like 

596
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:58,970
this is bullshit racket,
and we started it.

597
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

598
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:03,560
When you get that many active military 
on your side,

599
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:04,730
you really have to really think,
well,

600
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:06,500
these are the people that are dealing 
with this issue.

601
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,230
It's a part of their life.
It affects their families,

602
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:10,730
it affects their friends,
their loved ones,

603
00:25:10,731 --> 00:25:11,564
all the people they serve with.
The whole thing is it's so hard to 

604
00:25:15,411 --> 00:25:19,520
believe that they've been able to keep 
this going for so long and this war with

605
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:23,060
no end,
this war against terrorism is one of the

606
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:27,050
most devious things because whether or 
not terrorism exists,

607
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:27,770
it certainly does.

608
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,570
Whether or not we have to combat 
terrorism,

609
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:30,404
we certainly do.
Whether or not we have to take measures 

610
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:35,090
to ensure the safety of the people.
We definitely do 100%,

611
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,953
but there's something really suspicious 
about an unnamed enemy or an unseen and 

612
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:43,880
Miller and an enemy.
That's just terrorism.

613
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,743
It's like a,
it's like herpes just floating through 

614
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,010
all these parts of the world.
Like you don't even have a,

615
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,893
we don't,
it's not even a country with a leader 

616
00:25:50,811 --> 00:25:52,940
anymore.
Like now it's just terrorism.

617
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,800
Well,
it works out pretty great if you're like

618
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:56,890
a weapons company that's making more 
money than ever,

619
00:25:56,891 --> 00:25:57,724
or if you,
if you want it to keep this military 

620
00:25:58,851 --> 00:25:59,571
budget,
you know,

621
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:00,530
I mean,
uh,

622
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,161
the,
you know,

623
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:04,700
people were,
I liberals were all outraged over George

624
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,790
W Bush's military budgets and Obama 
greatly expanded those.

625
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,230
And uh,
so yeah,

626
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:10,064
if you're making tons of money off it,
it works out great to have kind of this 

627
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,210
vague concept that we're fighting a war 
against.

628
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:14,910
[inaudible].

629
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,430
I,
I do think terrorism,

630
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,130
obviously,
like you said,

631
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,860
exists.
I think terrorism,

632
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:21,230
as Pat Buchanan said,
is the price of empire.

633
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,333
And it kind of always has been,
and this is what we're going to be 

634
00:26:24,561 --> 00:26:27,170
dealing with as long as we want to have 
an empire in the Middle East.

635
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,340
Right.
But now it's not,

636
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,203
it's not like a one particular enemy.
It's this vague threat of attacks by 

637
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,173
irrational people.
And then you see them scattered 

638
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:37,784
throughout the world and other places 
where they don't have the kind of 

639
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:40,140
security that we do.
Right.

640
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,010
So it reinforces idea or idea that the 
TSA is,

641
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,470
and you've got to get through that line 
and you gotta be nice to these people.

642
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:49,220
And though they failed on like 95%.
Did you see that test?

643
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,230
They felt 95% of the like fake knives 
and bombs.

644
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:53,580
These are all getting it and they're 
just,

645
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,260
they're just feeling up old people.

646
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,910
Yeah.
They felt me up the other day.

647
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,990
Did they need to check my dick happened 
to me at the back of his hand.

648
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:02,610
He had to go up to both sides of my 
Dick.

649
00:27:02,611 --> 00:27:04,150
Did it give you the nice ex ex,
uh,

650
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,850
explanation about how he's going to do 
it?

651
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:07,370
And so we're going to feel what the back
of our hand,

652
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,810
the guy who did it to me,
and like I said earlier,

653
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:11,370
I'm no conspiracy theorist,
but when they're like,

654
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,580
you've been randomly selected for 
additional screening and inside,

655
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:15,900
I'm like,
what was that last podcast?

656
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,010
Huh?
I hit something.

657
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:20,850
Is that what you know,
may stuff which,

658
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,850
you know what he said to me?
She goes,

659
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,043
no,
that would be,

660
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,750
that would be more uncomfortable.
But he said before he did it,

661
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,970
I don't know if the guy said it to you,
but he goes up if you want,

662
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,800
we can bring into a private room for 
this.

663
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,053
Yeah,
they did say that.

664
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,600
It was like two,
we're going to do this right here.

665
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,800
Right now in a private room.
You Go,

666
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,263
yeah,
you're going to play George Michael's 

667
00:27:40,671 --> 00:27:42,460
music.
Yeah.

668
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,470
It's um,
I don't know.

669
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:45,410
I mean,
but it's so convenient that they need to

670
00:27:45,411 --> 00:27:47,640
kind of security that the NSA was trying
to get,

671
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,340
or they're the kind of,
um,

672
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:51,683
not security,
but I'm the kind of invasion of privacy 

673
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:56,850
that the NSA was doing with monitoring 
your metadata,

674
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,953
the ability to check all your emails and
the fact that what snowden exposed was 

675
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,114
kind of everybody's worst fear about all
this stuff was that one day we're going 

676
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:06,174
to get to a point where they're 
recording everything and you're always 

677
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:13,200
going to be scared to speak your mind in
the private and public with your friends

678
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,700
because you think they could always 
here.

679
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:18,900
And if there's certain key things that 
you say that upset them while they could

680
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:19,500
just target you.

681
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,350
Like they were talking about people in 
the NSA,

682
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:26,280
we're actively targeting their exes 
email accounts.

683
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,730
Oh yeah.
And reading their exes emails.

684
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,220
What does this,
this is just,

685
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,850
of course it's going to happen.
It's human beings.

686
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,670
A buddy,
a friend of mine worked at a bank and he

687
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:38,310
told me how they had a big problem with 
people like checking on celebrities,

688
00:28:38,311 --> 00:28:39,870
accounts,
checking on other people,

689
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:41,450
other friends of theirs accounts.
It's,

690
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:44,100
it's human nature.
I think personally,

691
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:44,934
I think the biggest thing that snowden 
exposed more so than any particular 

692
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:52,290
program was that he exposed that that 
guy clapper said,

693
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,153
you know,
the clapper was I think just six months 

694
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:55,644
a year before snowden released those 
files through Glenn Greenwald at the 

695
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:00,330
Guardian.
He,

696
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:01,980
he,
before a congressional hearing goes,

697
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:02,814
there is no bulk mass data collection.
And that's what's amazing about what 

698
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:08,010
Snowden,
you know,

699
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:08,844
showed you that they will just 
understand that they will lie through 

700
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:14,700
their fucking teeth to you.
Like they're liars,

701
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,430
they're not like misguided or they don't
know what's happening.

702
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:18,090
It's,
it's,

703
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:18,923
you know,
they're telling you what they think you 

704
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:22,230
need to know so they can get away with 
their bullshit.

705
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,673
And that to me is,
is a very important thing for people to 

706
00:29:26,101 --> 00:29:26,851
realize.
Well,

707
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:27,684
that's the,
the real insidious problem with the US 

708
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:32,400
versus them idea is that they're just 
people too.

709
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:33,443
So you've people that are operating 
these mass surveillance programs on 

710
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,020
other people.
There's nothing like,

711
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,100
there's nothing essentially noble about

712
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,600
them.
They haven't passed any tasks.

713
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:44,434
They haven't shown themselves to be some
people that are devoid of jealousy and 

714
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:49,174
pettiness and clear thought always.
And they're just the smartest people we 

715
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:53,434
know.
So we give them this position cause 

716
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:55,990
there's so they're like the knights of 
the watch,

717
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:56,921
you know?
Right.

718
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:58,830
You just go otherwise overlords.
Sorry.

719
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,980
We'll watch us.
They will walk.

720
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:02,890
They protect us.
I was arguing with a,

721
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:04,380
what's his name or who you bro brought 
up?

722
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,131
Baker.
Uh,

723
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:05,964
I was on a panel with him on,
on a Fox News show and we were talking 

724
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,514
about,
it was the apple when apple versus FBI 

725
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,480
thing,
which I guess is still going on.

726
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,553
But uh,
so I was kind of siding with apple and 

727
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:18,640
he was siding with the FBI.
I remember bigger said to me,

728
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,331
he goes,
he was like,

729
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:20,230
Dave,
what are you worried?

730
00:30:20,231 --> 00:30:21,064
Are you worried they're going to be 
checking your emails or checking your 

731
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:23,980
phone?

732
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,360
You know,
like that kind of attitude.

733
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,673
How was like the FBI was spying on civil
rights leaders being run by a cross 

734
00:30:31,231 --> 00:30:35,200
dressing maniac like yeah,
I don't trust these people are going to,

735
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,410
I don't trust those people anymore than 
I trust any group of people.

736
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,333
You have.
The fact that they think that that 

737
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:40,894
organization has been cleaned up like 
how much j Edgar Hoover and what they 

738
00:30:45,191 --> 00:30:47,770
did during the bullets.
It's coming out now more.

739
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,633
It's really interesting the stories that
are coming out now about how the war on 

740
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:51,694
drugs was a big part of their plan to 
try to break down the civil rights 

741
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:56,434
movement and break down these anti war 
protesters because this one thing they 

742
00:30:59,201 --> 00:31:00,910
shared in common,
they were all doing drugs.

743
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,781
So he said,
okay,

744
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:05,170
this will just have a fucking crazy war 
on drugs and we just go in and get these

745
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:06,410
people,
they're going to be smoking pile,

746
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:09,040
which is arrest the shit out of them and
just break up everything.

747
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,390
And they really did.
And it was,

748
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,970
it's brilliant in terms of like 
strategy,

749
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,050
if you're going to go after your 
enemies.

750
00:31:14,051 --> 00:31:15,280
I mean it's,
it's a great way to do it.

751
00:31:15,281 --> 00:31:20,240
But we're still suffering the 
consequences of Nixon's actions from Jad

752
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,400
or hoovers guidance.
I mean that that was all,

753
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,030
that's the whole pile that that was 
operating under.

754
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,380
Yeah.
And then you get this whole,

755
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:27,214
like it spawns this whole system of mass
incarceration and private prisons and 

756
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,700
this whole nightmare or hoover was 
awesome though.

757
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,803
You got to love with the bad ass.
Who's wearing a dress like cross 

758
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,630
dressing,
banging dude's keeping secrets.

759
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,770
Not only doing that today when it's cool
he was doing this at a time when like if

760
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:46,570
it came out,
people would be just,

761
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,404
I mean you're ruined.
Well that was how he kept it all under 

762
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:50,680
wraps.
He,

763
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,280
the reason that guy was so into getting 
into other people's Shit,

764
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,740
just cause he had so much shit to 
expose.

765
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,150
He's like,
well I can't let this get out.

766
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,103
I gotta be proactive.
I just got to gather up data on 

767
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:02,770
everybody.
Fuck Elvis.

768
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:04,430
Fuck Jimmy page.
Yeah.

769
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,313
But I just went after everybody.
I also think that there's something 

770
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:10,030
inherently,
like if you're in the cross dressing,

771
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:10,864
banging dudes scene,
you're going to meet other people with 

772
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:15,010
dirt too.
That's like,

773
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,300
you know the other guy who you're,
you're like,

774
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:16,631
hey,
look,

775
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:18,160
we both know where in that scene 
together,

776
00:32:18,161 --> 00:32:20,110
so you keep your mouth shut.
That's true too.

777
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:20,944
But I was like,
that's one of those things where people 

778
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:23,160
always say that,
uh,

779
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,180
if you,
uh,

780
00:32:24,181 --> 00:32:25,014
are with a partner and that partner,
all of a sudden it starts getting like 

781
00:32:26,891 --> 00:32:28,480
crazy,
irrationally jealous.

782
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,310
It's probably because they're doing 
something sneaky.

783
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:31,210
Yeah.
You know,

784
00:32:31,211 --> 00:32:34,170
and what he was doing was sort of that 
he was jagger,

785
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,720
hoover was a fucking maniac,
and he was in charge of the FBI.

786
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:39,340
I mean,
he was just a bonafide,

787
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,520
insane person.

788
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,380
But,
but like you said,

789
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:44,120
it's like who's to say they're cleaned 
up?

790
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,073
I think we always have this,
this like idea that we get comfortable 

791
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:49,700
with the fucked up shit in the past.
So we were like,

792
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,780
oh,
this was so fucked up.

793
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,600
But now it's not like that.
But you know,

794
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:53,434
we,
we love to look back at slavery or look 

795
00:32:54,861 --> 00:32:56,850
back at Jim Crow or look back at 
something,

796
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,550
oh,
what were these people thinking?

797
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,300
But if you look at,
I mean mass incarceration for nonviolent

798
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:03,134
crimes or mass slaughter in the Middle 
East or any of this stuff that these 

799
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:07,490
people believe me,
if,

800
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,360
if all the details of what's going on 
came out in 20 years,

801
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,400
we're going to have the same attitude in
20 years and be like,

802
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:14,234
man,
I'm fucked.

803
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,370
I'm fucked up.
Shit going on in 2016.

804
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,593
Well you know what's interesting to me,
there's even tribalism in the 

805
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:20,534
government,
like the CIA and the FBI can't get 

806
00:33:23,091 --> 00:33:24,200
along,
which is how,

807
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:25,250
um,
what's his name?

808
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,083
General.
I'm the guy who got busted for cheating 

809
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:29,300
on his wife.
Patraeus so trays,

810
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,970
that's how betrays got caught.
The at the FBI was spying,

811
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,950
was gone after the CIA.
So not only that,

812
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:36,530
but it's craziness.
Dianne Feinstein,

813
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,140
who is the head of the Senate 
intelligence committee.

814
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,040
Okay.
So they're,

815
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,903
they're tasked with overseeing the CIA.
She came out and said that the CIA is 

816
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,064
spying on them.
Like I don't know exactly how they 

817
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:49,910
figured it out,
but she came out and said,

818
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,040
so the CIA was spying.
But yeah,

819
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:52,874
this doesn't get big story on like a big
story on the new CIA spying and the 

820
00:33:56,361 --> 00:34:01,340
people who oversee the CIS supposedly,
we have no clue.

821
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,710
Rand Paul came out and said something 
along the lines of,

822
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:04,544
he was like,
we don't even know who's running this 

823
00:34:05,631 --> 00:34:09,080
thing when it comes to government.
So I think the thing that Libertarians,

824
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:10,820
Rand Paul said that,
yeah,

825
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:13,580
he said this like a year and a half ago 
when he was still doing well.

826
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,120
He actually should know.
That's why that's a scary thing.

827
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,820
Like he actually should,
he's probably talking to me,

828
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,180
but there's also this weird thing where 
like,

829
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,033
I don't know exactly how it works,
but there's this weird thing where like 

830
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:24,254
they'll tell you stuff but then you 
can't talk about it to anyone if it's 

831
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:29,660
like classified.
So a lot,

832
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:30,494
there's actually congressmen who don't 
want the classified information because 

833
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:36,260
they want to be able to say whatever 
they want to be able to say.

834
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,670
It's a,
it's a whole cluster fuck.

835
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,700
But I think this is one of the things 
that Libertarians,

836
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,773
uh,
at least the type of libertarian that I 

837
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:45,590
am,
like that school of thought,

838
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,670
it really tries to emphasize,
just don't look at government as if it's

839
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:53,000
a different entity from humanity.
We're all people,

840
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,581
right.
So it's like,

841
00:34:53,581 --> 00:34:55,430
like you were saying before,
like the CIA and the FBI,

842
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:56,570
they're not one monolith.

843
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,420
It's different power sources,
different groups of people.

844
00:34:59,421 --> 00:35:00,254
And Yeah,
of course they all are incentivized the 

845
00:35:02,211 --> 00:35:04,250
way people are.
And they're a corporation,

846
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:05,084
like any other business where there's a 
bunch of people that are backstabbing 

847
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:08,900
each other trying to get to the top of 
the ladder.

848
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:09,743
Yup.
So they're fucking each other over 

849
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:12,490
inside the tribe.
Yup.

850
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,550
There's a lot of that going on.
It's fucking weird world man.

851
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,650
When you hear someone like Ran Paul 
saying,

852
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:22,400
we don't know who's running this thing.
That's the government,

853
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,710
the whole government of the United 
States,

854
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:25,544
he's talking about,
he's talking about the strings behind 

855
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:29,150
the strings and we don't know who's 
running it.

856
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,141
Well,
I mean,

857
00:35:30,141 --> 00:35:31,220
you see this,
this,

858
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,520
it's very interesting when you hear like
a,

859
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,780
like Hillary Clinton,
it came out in one of these,

860
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:36,614
uh,
in one of her last batch of emails that 

861
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,903
that got like released it,
it was like her and her team were 

862
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:42,684
bragging about how she had convinced 
Obama to go ahead with regime change in 

863
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:47,830
Libya.

864
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,800
Oh,
that's right.

865
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,660
And then gates comes out and writes his 
book and he's like,

866
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:52,890
look,
I was against it.

867
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,780
Hillary was for,
so it's,

868
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:55,614
it's just this fucking like,
you convinced the guy and now this 

869
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:02,220
country is fucked.
Well,

870
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:03,270
she and all.
Yeah.

871
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:04,104
And well also did you,
I'm sure you saw the time where she was 

872
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:10,380
being interviewed and she was laughing 
about Kadafi Diane.

873
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:12,600
We came,
we saw he died when I said,

874
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,443
there's,
there's video evidence of her being a 

875
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:15,600
sociopath.
I don't understand.

876
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,000
It's not cut off.
He didn't just die right before that.

877
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:19,950
It's not just that you're talking about 
a human being who died.

878
00:36:19,951 --> 00:36:20,784
Okay.
Kadafi died the way that dictators fear 

879
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,463
you die.
His people got a hold of him and beat 

880
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:30,780
him and sodomized him to death.
He got like,

881
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,330
I mean,
it's about as disturbing as it could be.

882
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,673
What?

883
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,863
Again,
back to her laughing about getting the 

884
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:37,434
child rapist off.
She then a few days later she's just 

885
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:43,260
cackling it up.
There's a video of a guy stabbing him in

886
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:44,310
the ass hole.
I mean,

887
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:45,660
it's insane.
You've seen that,

888
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,494
right?
He takes that knife and he shoves it in 

889
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:49,090
his ass.
Yeah.

890
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:52,860
While they're talking to them and Kadafi
so fucked up.

891
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:53,694
He doesn't even know what's happened.
He's like in a state of shock or some 

892
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:58,290
shit.
There's a knife in his ass.

893
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,980
All these people have a hold of them.
They're all yelling alla walk bar.

894
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,150
Yeah,
it's,

895
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,620
that's,
that's a bad way to go.

896
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,483
It's a crazy way to go.
I wonder if that guy with the knife in 

897
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:09,420
his ass,
I wonder if that will be like,

898
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:11,680
you know that he would,
Jima statue.

899
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:13,883
They plant the flag.
They'll make a statue of the one guy 

900
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,390
with a knife up Qaddafi's ass.

901
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,770
It's like over your fireplace in his 
neighborhood.

902
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,450
That will be like,
you know,

903
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,190
that'll be his monument.
I mean,

904
00:37:26,191 --> 00:37:27,840
it's uncle,
he stopped because after you in the ass,

905
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,730
there's a video on youtube,
show it Mama,

906
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,460
and she puts it on the big screen.
Everybody watches it.

907
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:35,300
Yay.
It's closing your ears.

908
00:37:35,301 --> 00:37:36,134
Bomb bombs going off the background.
Cause Libby's even more fucked up now 

909
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:39,714
than it was then.
That regime change was terrible for the 

910
00:37:41,611 --> 00:37:42,421
people who live there.
Oh,

911
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:43,201
it's not even,
you know,

912
00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:45,440
I think we lose sight of it sometimes 
when you,

913
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,560
you'd be like,
you know,

914
00:37:46,561 --> 00:37:48,270
it's like,
oh well they're always fucked up.

915
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:49,720
So it's a little bit more fucked up.
But,

916
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,693
but Libya was by regional standards,
one of the better places to be in the 

917
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,090
Middle East and it is now.
I mean,

918
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:58,800
uh,
a failed state.

919
00:37:58,801 --> 00:37:59,571
It's,
I mean,

920
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:02,120
it's just run by thugs and terrorist 
organisms,

921
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,060
organizations.

922
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,893
It's,
it's a nightmare.

923
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,441
Yeah.
It's a,

924
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:07,850
it's a breeding ground for isis now.
Isis is all over the place there now.

925
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,623
She's weird.
She's weird because she gets all these 

926
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:15,690
free passes because she's a woman.
It's very strange because that's,

927
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:18,360
that's a a giant part of why people want
to support her.

928
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,320
It's almost like,
you know,

929
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:21,240
we got one of ours in,
you know,

930
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:24,500
we're going to get one of ours in.
Like my wife wants a vote for it because

931
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,650
she's a woman.
I go,

932
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:27,510
if you have paid attention to what a 
country is,

933
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,460
have you really read,
allegedly I should say Clinton toxic and

934
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,293
things.
I'm sorry,

935
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,600
I don't mean it.
I'm saying all this for humor.

936
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,973
She's,
I mean she's not the woman you want to 

937
00:38:41,561 --> 00:38:42,790
sound what you're looking for.
You,

938
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:43,624
she's not a scholar.
Well it's not a wise woman who's got 

939
00:38:45,881 --> 00:38:46,714
some really kind words to say she's a 
lifelong career politician and like you 

940
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:50,831
said,
and that always,

941
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:52,560
I mean if you talk to any Hillary 
supporters,

942
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,210
it is only sometimes it's not the first 
thing they say.

943
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,250
But if you give like give me three 
reasons why you want Hillary Clinton and

944
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,040
one of them has to do with her being a 
woman.

945
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:00,874
Yeah.
I think it'd be great to see a woman do 

946
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:03,910
it for change.
And by the way,

947
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:06,220
that's what she runs on.
She runs on women's issues.

948
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,780
She plays that card all the time.
I mean,

949
00:39:07,781 --> 00:39:09,400
she said like when Donald Trump called 
her on that,

950
00:39:09,401 --> 00:39:10,234
she was like,
if I'm a kid is a playing the woman's 

951
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:15,290
card deal me.
And that's her cadence by the way,

952
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,260
it's always this not as knowing you,
you need to be a little more noise.

953
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,190
Just not the pitch.
I don't have the pitch down.

954
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:26,770
She's she substitute having no charisma 
with just volume,

955
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,031
but she's like,
I can just,

956
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:30,650
if I go louder,
maybe that's charismatic wishes.

957
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,563
She doesn't just have no charisma.
She's oddly transparent in her 

958
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:37,270
creepiness.

959
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,103
Like when she's doing these debates and 
Bernie Sanders is calling her out on 

960
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:41,314
taking all that money from the banks and
how she does his speeches for quarter 

961
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:46,030
million dollars and he liked to read the
transcripts.

962
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:48,070
She just sitting there and while he's 
doing that,

963
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:53,200
just like this weird,
like the seething angry over here.

964
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,820
She's smiling on the outside,
but you know,

965
00:39:54,821 --> 00:39:56,660
deep down she could fucking kill you 
like it.

966
00:39:56,661 --> 00:40:00,640
And she's going over her preparation 
because they prepped her for this.

967
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:01,660
So you know,
it come,

968
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,503
it comes out in this weird sort of 
robotic I kido move where she's trying 

969
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:07,564
to push it to the side.
Like it's a fucking thug and a Steven 

970
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,490
Seagal movie.
It's weird man.

971
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,353
She doesn't really answer it in a way.
It's the only thing that I find a 

972
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:19,330
positive about Hillary Clinton is that 
you can constantly,

973
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,193
you can see through her and you can 
point to that shit and other people and 

974
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:24,070
go but see how she's full of Shit.

975
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:27,130
But how about for the woman card thing?
Just the fact that uh,

976
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:31,690
she's been taking like tens of millions 
of dollars from the Saudi government,

977
00:40:31,691 --> 00:40:34,810
something like $100 million from Muslim 
dictatorships.

978
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,380
How can you run on the women's issue?
It's like being a Jew,

979
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,740
running on Jewish issues and you do 
business with the Nazis.

980
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,830
So this,
this money and does what with it?

981
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,960
Well,
they take it for the Clinton Foundation,

982
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,093
which is like her and bill and Chelsea's
foundation and they do all these 

983
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:51,454
projects and it's all kind of in the 
name of charity in the name of 

984
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:54,994
philanthropy.
But it's pretty clearly like you get 

985
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,953
like the Saudis aren't giving tens of 
millions of dollars to the Clinton 

986
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,900
Foundation cause they all of a sudden 
decided to be really good people.

987
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,003
They're doing it because they know the 
Clintons wield a lot of influence and 

988
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:08,704
this is their way of giving them money.
And the Clintons can use that as 

989
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:15,100
leverage to justify their association 
with them.

990
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,340
Cause look all the good it does good 
stuff.

991
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:19,174
But in the meantime they can also do all
these projects and lots of different 

992
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:22,570
companies can make money off these 
projects.

993
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,643
And then they get in and we have this 
creepy business relationship with Saudi 

994
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:31,540
Arabia who is the worst of the worst.
Like all the shit that we,

995
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,500
you know,
I love a,

996
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:35,420
I love when the war machine,
whenever there's a war they want,

997
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,493
they get real humanitarian.
All of a sudden like when Obama wanted 

998
00:41:39,021 --> 00:41:42,710
to go back in a serious back into Iraq 
or when he wants to go into Syria,

999
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:43,191
it's like,
oh,

1000
00:41:43,191 --> 00:41:45,050
these people are getting gassed or you 
know,

1001
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,590
there's a,
there's a few hundred years.

1002
00:41:46,591 --> 00:41:48,920
Eddie is up on the top of a mountain and
they could die.

1003
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,933
But when,
when Saudi Arabia is slaughtering their 

1004
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:51,800
own people,
when,

1005
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,960
when Saddam was gassing people and we 
liked him,

1006
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:55,250
that was fine.
It's only when,

1007
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,940
when you're on the wrong side of 
whatever business deal we are,

1008
00:41:57,941 --> 00:41:59,990
we have going on.
All of a sudden they're like,

1009
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:00,824
but think of the people.
All of a sudden John Mccain cares about 

1010
00:42:03,231 --> 00:42:04,064
Muslim people.

1011
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,970
He's playing poker and it's phone.
Wait,

1012
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:08,863
hold on.
This john for a moment and talk about 

1013
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:12,530
the people.
It's a little suspicious.

1014
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:13,933
Well it's less suspicious now I guess 
then it was in the 1960s and in the 

1015
00:42:18,681 --> 00:42:22,250
1950s probably before that was even more
fuckery going on.

1016
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:26,510
But it seems like it's more and more 
difficult to pull off the really obvious

1017
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,373
operation northwoods type shit.
Like there the transparency that we are 

1018
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:31,814
enjoying today even though there's still
a lot of questions like what Jeb Bush 

1019
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:36,240
was or would um,
uh,

1020
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,093
ran.
Paul was saying like we really have no 

1021
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:40,070
idea who's running the whole thing at 
the very top.

1022
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,113
It seems like that's going to be exposed
to eventually it's all going to get 

1023
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:44,054
chipped away because information just 
travels weight quicker now than it ever 

1024
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:48,830
did before and it's just too hard to 
hide shit.

1025
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,520
You know?

1026
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,370
It's like that's it.
That force is on their side too though.

1027
00:42:52,371 --> 00:42:53,204
Like we have that force of like 
information can spread but they also 

1028
00:42:55,221 --> 00:43:00,221
have the Predator drones.
Like there was no way a president in the

1029
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:04,970
50s or whatever could have just had the 
option to say bomb Yemen,

1030
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:05,804
Syria,
Libya and Pakistan and all these 

1031
00:43:09,381 --> 00:43:12,260
different countries without sending 
troops there are having bases nearby.

1032
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:13,910
So you know,
we have advantages.

1033
00:43:13,911 --> 00:43:14,890
They have advantages.
Yeah.

1034
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,793
But it's taught.
What I was going to get at is that 

1035
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,820
what's interesting is what we're seeing 
now from the,

1036
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:23,000
like the NSA gathering data on everybody
saying we needed to PK,

1037
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:24,560
but he's safe.
It's almost,

1038
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:26,750
it almost mirrors like with j Edgar 
Hoover was doing,

1039
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:31,130
cause j edgar hoover had all that dirt 
on him and so to hide it,

1040
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:33,050
he just went after everybody else.
Keep everybody quiet.

1041
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,103
Everybody scared.

1042
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:38,390
That mean you could make that same 
comparison to this strategy.

1043
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,920
The NSA is employable.
Look,

1044
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,890
we'll just fucking monitor everything 
and then if,

1045
00:43:43,891 --> 00:43:44,724
if I say,
oh this dave guys been talking to a lot 

1046
00:43:46,851 --> 00:43:48,680
of shit,
let's check his emails and it's going to

1047
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:51,110
go back.
Oh look at all this.

1048
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,510
I was joking and I just want to say 
already I was joking,

1049
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,853
but you know what I'm saying.
I mean that's an insidious sort of 

1050
00:43:57,111 --> 00:43:59,060
device that they can use to keep you 
quiet.

1051
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,080
Well.
How about the fact that it,

1052
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,490
you know,
in 20 years,

1053
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,353
right,
if there's some leader who's coming up 

1054
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,120
who,
who is a would be,

1055
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:07,520
you know,
some type of great leader,

1056
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:11,870
they're going to have grown up just 
entirely in the Internet age where the,

1057
00:44:11,871 --> 00:44:14,060
if you have all of their metadata 
history,

1058
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,390
you have everything on that person and 
then they can literally just go like,

1059
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:21,610
we want to ruin that guy and everybody's
got something that could be a,

1060
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,950
an issue you could insert into a 
campaign should ruin them or you know,

1061
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,300
if you don't,
you're boring.

1062
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,500
Yeah,
yeah,

1063
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,393
that's right.
And then I don't want you president 

1064
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:29,744
anyway.
If they can't ruin you by checking your 

1065
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,030
that I don't even want

1066
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,210
you,
that's a great way to put it.

1067
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,360
If you can't be ruined,
I don't want you to be my leader.

1068
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,920
Are you?
You fucking Weirdo.

1069
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,990
You pious Weirdo from birth.
Yeah.

1070
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:41,430
It's like you've just been clean,
like going like,

1071
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:44,040
well Ha,
I'll get power Sunday as long as I don't

1072
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:46,920
fuck up and all that.
Oh she looks pretty but stay hungry.

1073
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:51,240
We taught him while he was in his crib.
Keep your cards close to your tests,

1074
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:52,074
Donnie.
But that's like the thing where they 

1075
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,250
said isn't about George Washington 
because they tried to make him out to be

1076
00:44:56,251 --> 00:44:57,090
such a great word.
They're like,

1077
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,220
his father was like,
did you cut down that cherry tree?

1078
00:44:59,221 --> 00:44:59,941
And he was like,
father,

1079
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:00,774
I can't tell a lie.
Like what type of fucking creep was 

1080
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:03,414
George Washington?
Or maybe had her like a really open 

1081
00:45:04,831 --> 00:45:07,260
relationship with his dad or just a dad 
who loved him.

1082
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,480
Stand out really cool and he knew,
hey man,

1083
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:11,550
somebody chop the tree down.
You've got blisters in your hand.

1084
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:12,450
The fuck's going on,
Bro.

1085
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:13,763
I mean,
there's just really compelling evidence 

1086
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,400
or maybe yet never fucking happened.
You know?

1087
00:45:17,401 --> 00:45:19,770
That's the other maybe more likely.
Yeah.

1088
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:20,843
Yeah.
I mean all these stories that you get 

1089
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:24,870
from the 16 hundreds like,
come on,

1090
00:45:24,871 --> 00:45:26,400
man,
those are barely people.

1091
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,700
Those were monkeys with clothes on it.
They barely know how to write.

1092
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,593
And,
and historians like to tell it as if 

1093
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:34,710
they know for a fact what happens.
Rather than just being like,

1094
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:35,723
Hey,
here's a nice guests at what maybe 

1095
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,591
happened.
They'll be like,

1096
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:38,424
he thought about going left,
but then he went right and it was kind 

1097
00:45:40,841 --> 00:45:41,674
of like,
alright,

1098
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:43,183
yeah.
I've always wondered if one day they'll 

1099
00:45:44,881 --> 00:45:49,881
be able to create a computer that's so 
powerful that it will be able to somehow

1100
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:51,354
through some unseen technology,
take account of everything that's in 

1101
00:45:54,631 --> 00:45:57,690
place as it is right now in the world.

1102
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,793
Then monitor for a certain amount of 
time and then go backwards and try to 

1103
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:04,171
figure out,
well,

1104
00:46:04,171 --> 00:46:05,004
all of these things got into place 
because of these events and these 

1105
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:10,470
motions and be able to recreate it 
digitally.

1106
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,393
It sounds ridiculous right now,
but if we can get to a place where they 

1107
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:17,520
can literally do an account of 
everything that's happened,

1108
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:18,863
everything,
every pebble that's on this earth and 

1109
00:46:21,511 --> 00:46:22,470
go,
you know what?

1110
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:23,423
We can extrapolate.
We can take all this data and follow it 

1111
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:31,020
for a short amount of time and then 
within the 99% accuracy,

1112
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,610
go back in time and recreate events.
I can,

1113
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:35,663
that sounds so stupid and ridiculous,
but that might be like almost a method 

1114
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,110
of a virtual time travel.
Like just super calculation.

1115
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,750
You just take into account all the 
things that we do,

1116
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:48,120
know all the pieces that are in place 
right now.

1117
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:48,983
Everything that's there,
all the people that are there and then 

1118
00:46:50,581 --> 00:46:53,520
figure out how they got their account 
for all factors.

1119
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,650
Account for everything.
I'm massive,

1120
00:46:55,651 --> 00:46:56,484
super calculations.
Impossible for the human mind to even 

1121
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:02,610
conceive of.
And then boom,

1122
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:03,444
they have a digital recreation of George
Washington fucking his sister and lying 

1123
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,390
about the cherry tree.
It was full of shit like to black people

1124
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:11,280
on fire.
Whoa.

1125
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,250
George Washington was a piece of shit.
Oh,

1126
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,900
allegedly.
I don't mean that for allegedly,

1127
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,210
you know what I'm saying?
Alleged cones,

1128
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,010
allegedly a piece of shit being 
credible.

1129
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:20,873
I mean if they could literally get to a 
position where they could do a 

1130
00:47:22,681 --> 00:47:26,670
calculation that's so complete that they
could feed it into some sort of,

1131
00:47:26,671 --> 00:47:28,710
uh,
you know,

1132
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,913
someday created virtual reality machine 
that will give you like a version of 

1133
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:35,314
that.
You can go back and watch the asteroid 

1134
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:37,870
that killed the dinosaurs.

1135
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,040
If humans can manage to not like destroy
ourselves or we don't have some asteroid

1136
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:42,874
reset or something like that,
we're going to do magical shit like 

1137
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:45,161
that.
I'm sure.

1138
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:45,730
I mean,
we're on,

1139
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,000
we're already doing magic compared to 
what we could do a hundred years ago.

1140
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:49,863
So I mean we're gonna it's the thing is 
you can never predict what it would be 

1141
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,353
exactly.
Like you can never stand back and you 

1142
00:47:56,131 --> 00:47:56,964
know,
you can't stand back in the year like 

1143
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:58,743
1850 and going to be like,
it'll be metal machines running on 

1144
00:48:01,121 --> 00:48:02,500
dinosaur juice.
You know,

1145
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:04,750
like you just wouldn't know.
But uh,

1146
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,400
we'll be doing some magical shit.
Well,

1147
00:48:06,401 --> 00:48:07,234
Sam Harris was talking about it and it 
was four Rican me out because he was 

1148
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:14,530
talking about the power that computers 
are going to have once they,

1149
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,690
once artificial intelligence become 
sentient,

1150
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:17,823
the power that they're going to have to 
improve upon themselves and how quickly 

1151
00:48:20,921 --> 00:48:21,754
that's going to take place,
where thousands of years of progress 

1152
00:48:23,711 --> 00:48:24,850
it's going to take place in a week.

1153
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:25,931
And you're like,
wait,

1154
00:48:25,931 --> 00:48:26,291
wait,
wait,

1155
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,124
wait,
what?

1156
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,200
And then it's just from there.
Each,

1157
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:32,350
each time the improve,
it improves exponentially.

1158
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,050
Thousands more years,
maybe in an hour,

1159
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,270
thousands more years in a couple of 
seconds.

1160
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:38,523
It's just going to get to some insane 
place where he's saying they're 

1161
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:44,200
reasonably certain that one day we'll 
have a machine.

1162
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,400
It's like an Adam machine that you could
shoot out into the universe and given an

1163
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:49,234
amount of time extracting all the 
building materials and needs from the 

1164
00:48:52,121 --> 00:48:53,500
sky,
it will make a planet.

1165
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:57,070
It'll make a planet and inhabit that 
planet with intelligent life.

1166
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,190
And then we can go there and it'd be 
like Miami in the sky.

1167
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,570
We'll go there.
There'll be,

1168
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:04,330
I mean,
literally you could create anything.

1169
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,330
You might already be living in it.
How we all got here,

1170
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,240
even want to Elon Musk's more recents 
talks.

1171
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:12,430
He talked about that.
But a lot of people had been saying that

1172
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:13,090
for a long time.

1173
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:13,923
But it's,
it's potentially possible that one day 

1174
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:20,270
we're going to have an artificial 
reality that's into indecipherable or,

1175
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,320
uh,
or you can't tell the difference between

1176
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,170
what is fake and what is real.
You will not be able to stay in.

1177
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:26,990
Wish it,
it will,

1178
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:29,920
it will be so good that it will be just 
like life.

1179
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:30,843
So if that's the case,
how do you know that you're not already 

1180
00:49:32,441 --> 00:49:33,274
in it?
Right.

1181
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:34,390
You don't,
you know,

1182
00:49:34,391 --> 00:49:35,320
and it's,
it's all,

1183
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,573
it's all Mumbo jumbo right now.
Unless you think that it could've 

1184
00:49:39,191 --> 00:49:41,200
already happened,
then it's not Mumbo jumbo.

1185
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:42,310
And if Harris has,
right,

1186
00:49:42,311 --> 00:49:45,190
the real problem with that,
and this is not even his ideas,

1187
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:48,430
this is all these people that are really
at the forefront of all this technology.

1188
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:49,930
We're going to be,
we're not,

1189
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,810
we're not going to be,
but something is going to be a god.

1190
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,273
I mean,
it literally is going to be able to 

1191
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,170
create worlds.
Yeah.

1192
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:57,183
It's potentially possible that one day 
they're going to have something that 

1193
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:04,270
could create a universe.
Yeah.

1194
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:04,751
I mean,
look,

1195
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,584
I think there's a,
there's an argument that that's how we 

1196
00:50:07,951 --> 00:50:10,870
were created.
I mean we're here like we are here.

1197
00:50:10,871 --> 00:50:13,420
We do exist.
And truthfully in the reductionist,

1198
00:50:13,421 --> 00:50:16,870
atheist scientific way of looking at it,
there's no good reason for that.

1199
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:18,550
But you of course there is.
See,

1200
00:50:18,551 --> 00:50:22,390
I don't buy that because the universe is
filled with magical shit.

1201
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,730
Like why wouldn't people be here?
Like,

1202
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:26,290
well look at,
look at supernovas.

1203
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,810
Look at black holes absorbing galaxies.
Look at,

1204
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,540
let me look at solar storms.
Look at flares.

1205
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:35,400
Look at this fucking ball of fire that's
in the sky.

1206
00:50:35,401 --> 00:50:38,990
That's a million times bigger than us.
Why is it so weird that people exist?

1207
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,970
The whole thing is fucking madness.

1208
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,410
Well that's,
well that's I guess,

1209
00:50:42,411 --> 00:50:43,131
yeah,
I agree with you.

1210
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:45,260
I'm just saying the whole thing is 
magical already.

1211
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,910
So what's the,
what's,

1212
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,610
you know,
it's humans more magic.

1213
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,310
We're not any more magic than everything
that's already out there.

1214
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:55,400
How about the Big Bang?
The whole thing is based on magic.

1215
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,360
Yeah.
He'll,

1216
00:50:56,361 --> 00:50:57,194
the whole university of something being 
created from nothing smaller than the 

1217
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:05,120
head of the pin and for whatever reason 
instantaneously explodes to sh to create

1218
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:08,030
all the mass,
both seen and unseen.

1219
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,280
That's in the galaxy,
including dark matter.

1220
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,233
You get through a conversation with this
point where we show we almost should 

1221
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:15,950
just come back to just being religious,
like let's just follow the fucking book.

1222
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,813
That's what I'm saying like mormonism 
where it's so dumb that it's kind of 

1223
00:51:19,461 --> 00:51:21,380
comforting that you might be beating 
everyone.

1224
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:23,230
Yeah.
That all these other people like joining

1225
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,073
on this dumb shit and you all agree and 
you call each other elders and you're 

1226
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:29,240
only 12 there's something about just 
belief though,

1227
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,820
like like belief might be beating 
skepticism of just,

1228
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,380
just the way,
I mean I know they do these things where

1229
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:37,214
they measure how your brain acts when 
those people are like speaking in 

1230
00:51:38,961 --> 00:51:41,140
tongues and stuff and you go to some 
weird place.

1231
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:41,973
Then just convincing yourself to be 
certain of what this existence is might 

1232
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:48,680
just put you on a whole different level.
It's like,

1233
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:49,543
oh,
it doesn't even matter what you're 

1234
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:51,860
believing and you're just,
as long as you're believing right.

1235
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:53,960
Well,
it exists in a really practical form and

1236
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:54,990
fighting and no,
you're,

1237
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,180
you're a big MMA.
For him.

1238
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:59,090
It exists in a really practical form and
fighting because,

1239
00:51:59,300 --> 00:51:59,901
you know,
when I,

1240
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:02,510
um,
when I was coaching young people back,

1241
00:52:02,511 --> 00:52:03,291
uh,
during the,

1242
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:05,000
uh,
taekwondo competing days,

1243
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:05,913
um,
I coached a lot of young people and I 

1244
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,840
brought a lot of people to tournaments 
and stuff like that,

1245
00:52:08,841 --> 00:52:09,674
a lot of students.
And one of the things that I've found 

1246
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:15,650
was that smarter people had a harder 
time with competing,

1247
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:16,520
like,
uh,

1248
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,130
like a lot of like the really smart 
people that I talked to.

1249
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:21,830
And then I would try to talk to them 
about it.

1250
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:25,340
And what I realized is they're more 
aware of the variables,

1251
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:26,323
right?
They're more aware of what could go 

1252
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:28,004
wrong and that would create anxiety.
And it was very difficult to get people 

1253
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:31,191
to just like,
okay,

1254
00:52:31,191 --> 00:52:34,100
you have to stay on the path of what 
you're trying to do.

1255
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:35,870
You can't look off to the side of the 
road.

1256
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,990
The fact that this cliff goes a thousand
feet down to the bottom of the canyon,

1257
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,180
you can't look at that.
You've got to look on the road,

1258
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:43,460
just the road.
And for a lot of smart people,

1259
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:44,061
they were like,
fuck,

1260
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:45,770
what if I get hit?
What happens if you get hit?

1261
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:46,604
Like,
oh well you're fucked if you get kicked 

1262
00:52:47,361 --> 00:52:48,620
in the face.
Yeah,

1263
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:50,900
don't get you in the face.
Keep your hands up.

1264
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:52,680
You got to move.
And um,

1265
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:56,870
dumb people were like convinced that 
they were going to be fine and I would,

1266
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,370
I was always fascinated by that.

1267
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,590
I was like,
this is weird because what's interesting

1268
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:01,424
is when the dumb people lost,
it was way more difficult for them to 

1269
00:53:04,671 --> 00:53:05,504
rebound.
Whereas the smart people lost and they 

1270
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:07,461
go,
all right,

1271
00:53:07,461 --> 00:53:08,294
well I saw that common.
Now I have to decide whether or not I 

1272
00:53:09,951 --> 00:53:12,740
still want to compete interests.
Is this the risk I still want to take?

1273
00:53:12,741 --> 00:53:14,840
Now I'm aware of the consequences.
I knew it was coming,

1274
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,320
so what technically went wrong and how 
am I physically?

1275
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,840
And you would see people that were 
intelligent,

1276
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:21,674
rebound and they would figure out a way 
to overcome the challenge or try to at 

1277
00:53:24,231 --> 00:53:25,064
least.
Whereas lot of smart people or a lot of 

1278
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:29,580
dumb people rather were devastated by 
losses because it's almost like you took

1279
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,550
away that simple belief of theirs.
Now they have to,

1280
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:33,750
you know,
this one guy,

1281
00:53:33,751 --> 00:53:36,180
I remember he was talking about how he 
was such a good person.

1282
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,260
I can't believe this.
You know,

1283
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:38,970
I,
I followed the Lord's word.

1284
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:40,590
I'm a good person.
Why God do this to me?

1285
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:42,300
I was like,
oh no.

1286
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,700
Now he's questioning his very existence.
Yeah,

1287
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:47,640
that's rough.
That's a weird thing to see someone have

1288
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,470
that.
Cause there's a,

1289
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:51,720
there's an amazing like confidence that 
you have to have a,

1290
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:52,720
or like,
uh,

1291
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,350
at least you have to get yourself to 
that place.

1292
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:56,520
And it took like,
you know,

1293
00:53:56,550 --> 00:53:57,720
compete in mma,
like you said,

1294
00:53:57,721 --> 00:54:00,810
without looking at the side of the road.
And when you see that broken,

1295
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,591
I mean,
when I saw that,

1296
00:54:01,591 --> 00:54:03,810
uh,
that Ellen interview with Rhonda Rousey,

1297
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:05,730
Yeah.
That was so crazy to me.

1298
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:06,653
That really made me go like,
maybe she shouldn't fight for a little 

1299
00:54:08,491 --> 00:54:09,390
while.
Like,

1300
00:54:09,391 --> 00:54:10,224
I don't know if I like,
she needs some more time off because 

1301
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,620
this,
she went from being the like,

1302
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:14,930
I'm going to kill everyone.

1303
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:16,950
No one has a right to beat me.
Don't be a b,

1304
00:54:16,951 --> 00:54:19,950
nothing bitch.
And being that chick to being like a,

1305
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,053
I wanted to kill myself.
I've got to just have Travis Brown's 

1306
00:54:22,501 --> 00:54:23,490
babies.
And I was like,

1307
00:54:23,491 --> 00:54:24,324
Whoa,
she's gone from being this like 

1308
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:27,803
untouchable.
I mean not even like she was like the 

1309
00:54:30,451 --> 00:54:32,520
best female fighter.
It was like don't even,

1310
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:36,720
she's wrecking chicks in a second and 
then to seeing her kind of broken.

1311
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:37,643
Well,
what's interesting is these themed play 

1312
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:43,170
themselves out over and over again.
And the traps are all there,

1313
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,153
but everybody keeps going for the candy 
and they keep getting caught in the 

1314
00:54:46,771 --> 00:54:47,604
traps.
The traps of Hollywood are always there 

1315
00:54:49,711 --> 00:54:52,800
for any superstar athlete,
especially fighters.

1316
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:53,634
And you know,
we've seen it all throughout history 

1317
00:54:54,781 --> 00:54:55,614
with Tommy Morrison gets in the rocky 
movie and all of a sudden everybody's 

1318
00:54:58,321 --> 00:55:00,570
looking at him like Tommy Marson is 
going to be the white hub.

1319
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,660
And then Ray Mercer beats the living 
fuck out of them.

1320
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:04,643
And you just saw like fear and 
overwhelming anxiety attack him cause 

1321
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:11,460
he's in this movie and he's on the red 
carpet and everybody's saying,

1322
00:55:11,461 --> 00:55:12,690
you going to be the champ one day,
honey.

1323
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:13,680
I was like,
Oh fuck.

1324
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,560
And then it becomes this whole thing.
He's hanging with Sylvester stallone.

1325
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:19,350
They're probably doing blow and banging 
hookers allegedly,

1326
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,550
allegedly.
But you know what I mean?

1327
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:21,384
It's like it becomes this Hollywood trap
and Rhonda was a Jew and still is a 

1328
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:27,600
giant superstar,
right?

1329
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:31,860
She's this undefeated women's fighter.
She's crushing all the competition.

1330
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,670
She looks like a destroyer and then the 
fucking traps this,

1331
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:38,220
all these movies start coming out,
all this,

1332
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:41,280
all these deals start getting made.
Books start getting written.

1333
00:55:41,490 --> 00:55:42,323
All these television shows and all this 
stuff and all the traps and all those 

1334
00:55:44,851 --> 00:55:47,100
traps,
they keep you focus.

1335
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,000
They take steal little bits of your 
focus,

1336
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:51,270
like I'm good enough to get by without 
all that focus.

1337
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,433
But there's no way,
because there's another person like you 

1338
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:54,984
out there,
there's a lot of people like you out 

1339
00:55:56,581 --> 00:55:57,414
there and they don't have those traps.
And if they don't have those traps are 

1340
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:01,890
going to have more attention that's 
being paid right away.

1341
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,980
They had an advantage because they have 
their full focused on this.

1342
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:08,020
And there's also something dangerous to 
someone like Rhonda Rousey.

1343
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:09,750
But by the way,
obviously it's just incredible.

1344
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:10,584
I mean,
she's the reason why women's mma is a 

1345
00:56:12,211 --> 00:56:14,130
huge thing.
Uh,

1346
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:15,443
but I think there's something dangerous 
about being such an amazing grappler 

1347
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:23,040
getting a couple of knockouts and all of
a sudden feeling this kind of like,

1348
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:23,531
oh yeah,
you know,

1349
00:56:23,531 --> 00:56:26,560
she got the knee to a mcmahon and stops 
it with one knee.

1350
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:28,000
And then what was the other chick who 
she,

1351
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:31,030
she hit the overhand who face planted 
Alexis Davis.

1352
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:31,893
Yeah.
And so now it's kind of going in there 

1353
00:56:33,191 --> 00:56:35,200
and even going in there with like a 
world class,

1354
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:38,870
a boxer like a Holly Holm,
she kind of goes in there with,

1355
00:56:38,871 --> 00:56:39,191
they're like,
well,

1356
00:56:39,191 --> 00:56:42,340
I can knock people out too.
And I think that's a dangerous,

1357
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:42,911
you know,
all,

1358
00:56:42,911 --> 00:56:44,290
you know what is a dangerous 
combination?

1359
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,153
It's like being a blue belt and he 
choked out a bunch of white belts and 

1360
00:56:47,111 --> 00:56:47,944
you think you're the shit and then all 
of a sudden you're rolling with Damien 

1361
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:52,220
Maia and he wraps you up like a 
Christmas present.

1362
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:53,860
Beats the fuck out of you and chokes 
you.

1363
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,890
Unconscious easy.
You know?

1364
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,820
I mean,
there's levels of everything.

1365
00:56:57,821 --> 00:57:02,650
And to deny those levels because anybody
who looked at her fights would see like,

1366
00:57:02,651 --> 00:57:04,780
okay,
you have this Rhonda Rousey.

1367
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:08,230
This fierce competitor was one of the 
best judo,

1368
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:09,910
um,
examples of Judah.

1369
00:57:09,911 --> 00:57:10,744
We've ever seen an MMA.
I mean her judo spectacular reason why 

1370
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:15,430
she was a medalist in the Olympics.
I mean,

1371
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:18,430
she's a sensational competitor.
Her grappling is outstanding.

1372
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:20,890
Her arm bar technique is amongst the 
best in the world,

1373
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,760
but she's knocking out these girls 
there.

1374
00:57:23,761 --> 00:57:24,594
There's no,
they're nowhere near Worldclass as far 

1375
00:57:27,731 --> 00:57:29,530
as like kickboxing and striking is 
concerned.

1376
00:57:29,531 --> 00:57:30,364
Right.
Holly Holm is 100% worldclass she is an 

1377
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:36,910
18 time world boxing champion.
I mean she's a kickboxing champion.

1378
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,170
She was in,
uh,

1379
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,153
an MMA competitor for a couple of years 
before she got into the UFC where she 

1380
00:57:43,451 --> 00:57:46,240
was having these ridiculous head kick 
chaos.

1381
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:47,350
Yeah.
She's a beast.

1382
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:51,340
And for her to think that she's going to
treat this woman,

1383
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:52,323
this Holly Holm woman,
the same way she was able to bully like 

1384
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:57,010
Batchko Heyah and I say billy,
not in a negative way.

1385
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,980
I mean just,
just attacker and go after Batchko Hey,

1386
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,833
I was,
she slow and awkward and not that 

1387
00:58:03,761 --> 00:58:07,180
athletic.
Holly Holm bounces around that cage like

1388
00:58:07,181 --> 00:58:08,680
a fucking kangaroo.
Yeah.

1389
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:11,270
She does all these back flips and shit.
She's spectacular.

1390
00:58:11,271 --> 00:58:12,104
The athletic and the idea that you're 
going to have the same approach they 

1391
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:15,820
used on Batchko go,
hey,

1392
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:17,140
uh,
with someone like Holly Holm,

1393
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,003
that's just madness.
And that's something that happens when 

1394
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:22,420
people get so absorbed with this idea 
that they're special.

1395
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,340
So absorbed with this idea that,
you know,

1396
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:27,760
when you're on top,
you think you are the fucking person.

1397
00:58:27,761 --> 00:58:29,020
You're the woman,
you're the man,

1398
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:31,240
you're the shit.
No one's going to fuck with you.

1399
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:32,074
I'm just wandering through this bitch.
And then you get cracked and then you 

1400
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:35,321
realize,
oh,

1401
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:38,650
this game doesn't give a fuck.
This game doesn't give a fuck about your

1402
00:58:38,651 --> 00:58:39,484
charisma.
It doesn't give a fuck about the vegas 

1403
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:41,710
odds.

1404
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:42,543
It doesn't give a fuck about how much 
money you made or how many times you've 

1405
00:58:45,341 --> 00:58:49,660
been on entourage or amazing.
It's an amazing thing about mma.

1406
00:58:49,661 --> 00:58:52,420
It's why I have so much respect for 
everybody who competes.

1407
00:58:52,421 --> 00:58:56,470
But it's like no one can escape this 
game's wrath.

1408
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,150
No,
I mean,

1409
00:58:57,150 --> 00:59:00,160
j like John Jones still has a lot of his
career to go and he does.

1410
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:03,160
He has one loss on his record,
but it was not dominant you when,

1411
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,630
uh,
but you know,

1412
00:59:04,631 --> 00:59:05,464
you see these guys,
like you see Anderson Silva and he's 

1413
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:09,010
just like,
he's a Ninja.

1414
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:10,570
He's untouchable.
He's the greatest fighter ever.

1415
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:13,990
And then you see him like crying on the 
ground with a shattered,

1416
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:14,980
not shattered,
but whatever.

1417
00:59:14,981 --> 00:59:17,260
When he broke his shin.
Well,

1418
00:59:17,261 --> 00:59:20,470
how about when he cried in the ground 
after he won against Nick Diaz?

1419
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,870
He fell to the ground

1420
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,240
fighter ever.
By the way,

1421
00:59:23,241 --> 00:59:24,770
Nick Dsi is just,
it's pretty awesome.

1422
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,633
I mean,
the Diaz brothers are just the greatest 

1423
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,130
fighters of all time.
They certainly are.

1424
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:29,450
Um,
yeah.

1425
00:59:29,451 --> 00:59:30,350
But yeah,
well,

1426
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:33,740
from going full circle then when he 
comes back and wins in the octagon.

1427
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:34,221
But I mean,
it's,

1428
00:59:34,221 --> 00:59:35,780
it's,
it's an incredible thing.

1429
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:36,770
It makes you look,
I mean,

1430
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:39,260
when watching Chuck Liddell,
who I just,

1431
00:59:39,261 --> 00:59:40,370
you know,
at a certain point you were like,

1432
00:59:40,371 --> 00:59:42,650
that guy's just unbeatable.
He's like Superman.

1433
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,260
And then to see him getting knocked out 
and kind of his chin,

1434
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,380
you know,
slowly start to go,

1435
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:47,881
yeah,
it's,

1436
00:59:47,881 --> 00:59:49,210
it's,
it's like this,

1437
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,430
this game just came,
doesn't give a fuck,

1438
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:54,290
doesn't give a fuck about your opinions.
Doesn't give a fuck about what you think

1439
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:58,100
when knuckles hit Chin's legs go limp.
And that's just how it goes.

1440
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,140
And we saw that in the rockhold bisping 
fight.

1441
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,363
You know,
rockhold had this look about him that 

1442
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,870
almost like he was bored,
that he was just like,

1443
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:06,950
I'm going to go.
I mean,

1444
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:09,800
part of that I'm sure as gamesmanship,
he's trying to get inside bisping's head

1445
01:00:09,801 --> 01:00:10,634
that he's so much better than him,
that he doesn't even have to like be 

1446
01:00:12,921 --> 01:00:17,270
serious and be concerned.
And then bisbing clips him with his left

1447
01:00:17,271 --> 01:00:19,520
hook over the shoulder where he's barely
seen it.

1448
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:21,890
You called it,
it was a greg,

1449
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:22,724
is that what you said?
Like a few beats before that we were 

1450
01:00:24,111 --> 01:00:24,944
like,
Luke rockhold is keeping his chin right 

1451
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,340
up in the air and he's kind of like a 
little lacks of days ago.

1452
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,151
Yeah,
I remember you,

1453
01:00:29,151 --> 01:00:29,931
uh,
in the,

1454
01:00:29,931 --> 01:00:30,764
um,
in the Hennen Barao dillashaw fight the 

1455
01:00:33,411 --> 01:00:35,210
first one,
which is like a huge upset,

1456
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,630
no one saw that coming.
Uh,

1457
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,990
and I remember you,
you sang as it was,

1458
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:39,831
you're like,
man,

1459
01:00:39,831 --> 01:00:41,540
until the show is really light on his 
feet.

1460
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:42,653
I was really relaxed.
Like sometimes you could just see a 

1461
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:47,420
little thing in the way they're moving.
They like.

1462
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:48,710
Hmm.
That's kind of interesting.

1463
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:49,663
Yeah.
I was telling you before we started 

1464
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:52,880
recording my,
my buddy hilarious comedian,

1465
01:00:52,881 --> 01:00:54,410
one of my best friends,
Lewis j Gomez,

1466
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,040
he does a radio show with Michael 
bisbing.

1467
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,610
Right.
And you've had a big Jay.

1468
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:01,290
I'm going to show the three of us do a 
podcast,

1469
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,410
a legion of skanks you you got to have 
Lewis on.

1470
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:04,610
You'll fucking,
I would love to.

1471
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,350
He's like Jay.
Yeah,

1472
01:01:06,351 --> 01:01:08,180
Jay Jay is a,
I've got a special coming out,

1473
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,460
which is going to be just incredible.
What's it on?

1474
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,830
A comedy central hour.
Oh,

1475
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,890
cool.
I'll coming out on,

1476
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:15,830
I believe it's,
I want to say June 17th,

1477
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:20,090
but I might like one of those days,
it's called a live at webster hall.

1478
01:01:20,091 --> 01:01:22,550
It's going to be a fucking incredible 
special look for that.

1479
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:23,383
Jay Z,
like one of the funniest comedians on 

1480
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:25,610
the planet.
Very funny.

1481
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:29,270
Louis J.
Gomez is just one of the funniest people

1482
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:30,950
I've ever met in my life.
He's a great comedian.

1483
01:01:30,951 --> 01:01:32,750
He's like bigger than a standup 
comedian.

1484
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,940
He's like the Bert Kreischer of the east
coast.

1485
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:37,760
He's just a hilarious person.
Uh,

1486
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:40,100
but so he's doing a show with,
with Michael Bisman,

1487
01:01:40,101 --> 01:01:40,934
they do a show called the countdown on 
Sirius Radio and he started doing the 

1488
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:44,324
show.
I mean this is before bisbing has the 

1489
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:45,944
Anderson Silva fight and it did almost 
seem kind of like bisping was a great 

1490
01:01:49,161 --> 01:01:51,680
fight or a big name,
but seemed like he was kind of,

1491
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:53,390
you know,
going towards the end of his career.

1492
01:01:53,391 --> 01:01:54,224
Like he had a couple injuries,
had the eye thing and you're kind of 

1493
01:01:56,271 --> 01:01:57,020
like,
oh he was,

1494
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:58,640
he was a contender.
Well explain the,

1495
01:01:58,641 --> 01:02:00,440
I think cause the I think is pretty bad.
Yeah.

1496
01:02:00,441 --> 01:02:04,640
You probably know better than he has a 
detached retina and his oil in his eye,

1497
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:05,803
they had to inject oil into where his,
I sit so that his retina won't tear 

1498
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:13,700
again.
So he has one eye that looks almost like

1499
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:17,210
cross side and it's kind of black like 
is like he's on ecstasy.

1500
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:20,310
Like one pupils dilated.
It's very weird

1501
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:21,383
and he doesn't give a fuck.
He's got that one I fucked up and he 

1502
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:25,884
doesn't give a shit.
He's still going in there and settling 

1503
01:02:27,771 --> 01:02:29,730
in.
That guy's born for this,

1504
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:30,564
this,
this motherfucker went out and fought 

1505
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:36,960
Anderson Silva won one of the gutsiest 
performances I've ever seen him.

1506
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:37,980
I mean he,
the,

1507
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:40,890
the first two rounds that he beat 
Anderson were just incredible.

1508
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:45,450
And then the fact that he got almost put
out in the third round and came back and

1509
01:02:45,451 --> 01:02:46,284
won the fourth round and it was a fucked
up thing because he was trying to say 

1510
01:02:48,871 --> 01:02:51,980
that his mouthpiece was out and he tried
to circle to,

1511
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:53,810
I don't know who the referee was.
Herb.

1512
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:54,733
Yeah.
And he's like,

1513
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:56,143
but herb's like,
look,

1514
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,190
it doesn't matter like you got to,
I'm not stopping it.

1515
01:02:58,191 --> 01:02:59,024
You don't,
you can't call when to stop the action 

1516
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,313
because you could say that the 
mouthpieces out or you could just spit 

1517
01:03:03,271 --> 01:03:04,670
your mouthpiece that whenever someone,
you know,

1518
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,370
like landed a big show,
people do time and people do do that.

1519
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,810
But you know,
herb was like,

1520
01:03:09,811 --> 01:03:12,390
look,
you can't say to me that your mouthpiece

1521
01:03:12,391 --> 01:03:13,740
out,
I know your mouth pieces out,

1522
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,780
but you got to keep fighting.
Then boom,

1523
01:03:15,781 --> 01:03:16,614
Anderson lands a flying knee on the jot 
and then Anderson walks away with his 

1524
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,480
hands up.
It's so crazy as if he won.

1525
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:23,610
So crazy.
Herb didn't call the fight yet.

1526
01:03:23,611 --> 01:03:24,444
So then the bell rings.
So then bisping has to get up and 

1527
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:29,130
recover in a minute from getting 
chaotic.

1528
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:30,023
It was madness.
He got a little bit of extra time 

1529
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:34,950
because Anderson Silva celebrate it.
Yes.

1530
01:03:34,951 --> 01:03:37,050
So I think he got like an extra 30 
seconds or so.

1531
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,550
But I mean,
but then right.

1532
01:03:38,551 --> 01:03:39,450
So,
and by the way to,

1533
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:41,330
that's got to fuck Anderson up to cause 
Anderson's,

1534
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,160
now I've got this like adrenaline dump 
and then you saw on his face,

1535
01:03:44,161 --> 01:03:44,820
he's like,
what?

1536
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,160
No,
we're back to fighting it.

1537
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:48,600
But bisping man,
that fourth round,

1538
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:51,810
he just bit down on his mouthpiece and 
walked him down.

1539
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:53,070
Yeah,
I mean it was incredible.

1540
01:03:53,071 --> 01:03:53,904
Crazy.
And then after that being the greatest 

1541
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:58,500
ever to come and you get on a,
on an injury,

1542
01:03:58,620 --> 01:03:59,453
right?
You get a title shot with 10 days' 

1543
01:04:00,931 --> 01:04:02,880
notice.
He fights the greatest ever.

1544
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:06,450
I mean arguably Anderson's on the 
downslide but definitely,

1545
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,400
let's not say arguably,
I mean losing twice to Weidman.

1546
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:14,100
He just didn't look the same when he 
fought Nick Diaz suspended for steroids,

1547
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:15,900
comes back and,
and you know,

1548
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,970
but he's still Anderson Silva.
So that victory,

1549
01:04:18,971 --> 01:04:19,804
he gets that victor over the greatest of
all time and then first round knockout 

1550
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:23,550
over Luke rockhold you know,
it's fucked up.

1551
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,384
I was,
I was literally considering saying that 

1552
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:26,694
Luke rockhold looks overconfident and 
when you're overconfident you can get 

1553
01:04:29,071 --> 01:04:30,270
knocked out.
And I'm like,

1554
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:31,104
I don't want to be a deck.

1555
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,240
And then boom,
he gets knocked out.

1556
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:36,080
But you did make the comment about him 
holding a,

1557
01:04:36,090 --> 01:04:36,923
about him not having his head right 
there on the center line of sort of 

1558
01:04:39,121 --> 01:04:39,954
relaxed.
It was super relaxed with his chin 

1559
01:04:40,891 --> 01:04:41,724
straight up.
He was pulling out of things with his 

1560
01:04:42,571 --> 01:04:45,300
chin straight up.
It's almost like there was no danger.

1561
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,150
And that was one of the things that he 
was saying that,

1562
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,650
you know,
he was in no danger.

1563
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:52,980
And it was also one of the same things 
that Uriah Faber was saying.

1564
01:04:53,010 --> 01:04:54,720
Like the difference between me and 
cruises.

1565
01:04:54,721 --> 01:04:56,670
I can hurt him,
I can take him out.

1566
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,770
And then when you see your riot got 
caught,

1567
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:59,783
I think it was a second round,
I got dropped and you realize he's in 

1568
01:05:01,381 --> 01:05:03,810
deep trouble.
Like you realize holy Shit,

1569
01:05:03,811 --> 01:05:07,000
like I can get knocked out too.
And all those guys in,

1570
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:07,461
you know,
it's,

1571
01:05:07,461 --> 01:05:08,294
it's uh,
it's funny when you get it like Michael 

1572
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:10,703
Bisping was guy who the knock on him I 
guess was that he didn't have knockout 

1573
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:13,374
power or whatever.

1574
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:16,830
You're talking about like a a 200,
I mean fighting at two.

1575
01:05:16,831 --> 01:05:18,640
Oh,
I got it cuts down probably,

1576
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:19,600
I'm sorry,
one 85.

1577
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:23,050
So probably someone,
someone who weighs close to 200 pounds.

1578
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:26,560
It's a 200 pound guy who specializes in,
in striking.

1579
01:05:26,561 --> 01:05:27,394
Yeah.
And he can fucking knock you out of 

1580
01:05:28,481 --> 01:05:30,520
course.
And he proved it.

1581
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:32,980
He doesn't,
he doesn't fight like a,

1582
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:36,310
like a brawler like he fights like a 
technician.

1583
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:37,870
Yeah.
And when you fight like a technician,

1584
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:42,640
you don't swing wild crazy ass punches 
with everything on them with your,

1585
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,830
you know,
vandelay Silva style,

1586
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,560
you know,
you try to find openings and that's what

1587
01:05:47,561 --> 01:05:49,210
he did.
He found the opening with that left hook

1588
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,460
was really sneaky.
He had missed it before.

1589
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:52,443
He was like stepping in and throwing the
left took over the shoulder and kind of 

1590
01:05:55,481 --> 01:05:59,050
like stepping into the punch.
And boy when he caught luke,

1591
01:05:59,051 --> 01:05:59,884
he caught him at the end of the chin,
which really like fucking spins your 

1592
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:03,070
head.

1593
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:03,903
All the torque is perfectly placed and 
then you caught him with another 

1594
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:08,380
brilliant one right afterwards.
It's followed up.

1595
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:09,430
Yeah man.
Dude.

1596
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:12,610
And you know he's had like all sorts of 
fucking crazy injuries.

1597
01:06:12,611 --> 01:06:14,440
Back injuries,
neck injuries,

1598
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:16,270
his fucking arm thing.
Yeah,

1599
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,580
he's just tough man.
He just keeps going.

1600
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:21,460
It just keeps going.
She had no question about that.

1601
01:06:21,461 --> 01:06:22,294
That dude's as tough as they come in.
I know I'm never fixed him just because 

1602
01:06:25,121 --> 01:06:25,954
he's one of those guys who's like been 
around forever and always kind of been 

1603
01:06:27,731 --> 01:06:29,820
knocking at the door.
So it's nice to see him.

1604
01:06:29,821 --> 01:06:32,200
You know,
get his moment well was crazy to see.

1605
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:34,000
Well you see like there's knockout 
power,

1606
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:34,834
right?
And then there's like Dan Henderson 

1607
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,870
Kinda knock out power that it's just 
like,

1608
01:06:37,871 --> 01:06:42,760
Geez fucking cry.
Like Dan Henderson feels like this table

1609
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,310
when you put your arm on him and he's 
not flexing.

1610
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,800
He's like the,
like Ryan Parsons,

1611
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:50,200
who's a buddy of mine who was his 
manager for a long time,

1612
01:06:50,201 --> 01:06:53,260
said that he would do massage on him and
he would be exhausted.

1613
01:06:53,261 --> 01:06:55,810
He's like,
he's would the guys made out of wood.

1614
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,700
So like when you look at them,
you look at me go,

1615
01:06:57,701 --> 01:06:59,110
well it looks like a,
you know,

1616
01:06:59,111 --> 01:07:02,020
strong athletic guy.
But if you felt him,

1617
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:03,640
you realize where all this power comes 
from.

1618
01:07:03,641 --> 01:07:05,440
He's like,
he's built different,

1619
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:07,960
there's something going on with him.
And he does.

1620
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:10,200
When you were saying people who don't 
put everything into one punch,

1621
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,690
he puts everything into it.
I mean,

1622
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:16,030
it's like coming at Ya and it's so weird
the way he moves to,

1623
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:18,700
he moves in a weird way because he's 
very stiff.

1624
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:23,350
He's not fluid like John Jones or like 
Anderson is very fluid in his movements.

1625
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:28,090
Dan is like very stiff,
but when he uncorked those bombs on you,

1626
01:07:28,091 --> 01:07:33,010
they just detonate and you're just like,
what the fuck hit me like hector lumbar.

1627
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:36,040
It's never been knocked out to see 
hector lumbar getting knocked out by,

1628
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,660
well,
he got head kicked.

1629
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:38,553
He's probably stunned by that head kick 
and then he got blasted with that back 

1630
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,730
elbow.
He was out cold.

1631
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:43,863
He was out cold when he hit the ground 
and then Henderson blast them again but 

1632
01:07:47,141 --> 01:07:48,220
like,
Whoa,

1633
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:48,871
I,
I saw it.

1634
01:07:48,871 --> 01:07:50,200
I was like,
who the fuck hits?

1635
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:53,240
Like this guy is like,
it's almost like you want him to hit you

1636
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:57,570
just so he could feel it a bit harder.
Is that the normal what it,

1637
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:00,400
what the fuck are you doing?
I want to start by like standing next to

1638
01:08:00,401 --> 01:08:02,620
a guy who he hits like hit him real 
close to me.

1639
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:03,454
I want to feel it.
His Kale of bisping UFC 100 was one of 

1640
01:08:06,371 --> 01:08:09,490
the most brutal one punch shots and the 
history of combat sports.

1641
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:12,940
It was just boom,
bisping's dead stiff,

1642
01:08:12,941 --> 01:08:13,774
and then Henderson's airborne long 
before the referee can get to them and 

1643
01:08:17,091 --> 01:08:19,970
just slams him in the face on the way 
down.

1644
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:20,803
And then from there out,
one of his logos was the silhouette of 

1645
01:08:24,921 --> 01:08:27,530
him flying through the air and knocking 
out bisbing.

1646
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:28,563
So imagine being best bang.
Not only do you have to deal with the 

1647
01:08:30,321 --> 01:08:33,170
fact this guy fucking knocked you out in
spectacular fashion,

1648
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:34,004
but his logo is flying through the air,
hitting you after you're already 

1649
01:08:40,101 --> 01:08:41,420
unconscious.
I would,

1650
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,370
I would just say,
hang on.

1651
01:08:43,371 --> 01:08:44,204
In a few years,
you'll be champ and you'll have a show 

1652
01:08:46,371 --> 01:08:48,530
with Louis J.
Gomez and everything will be good.

1653
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,410
What year was UFC?
200 it's a wild man.

1654
01:08:51,411 --> 01:08:53,050
That was brock lesnar.
I want one.

1655
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,350
Yeah,
100 yeah.

1656
01:08:54,351 --> 01:08:55,190
100 was like,

1657
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:59,660
was it 2012 no,
earlier than that,

1658
01:08:59,661 --> 01:09:01,010
probably.
What year was that,

1659
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:01,873
Jamie?

1660
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:05,520
I just pulled something up.
It wasn't ufc one 14 popped up.

1661
01:09:05,521 --> 01:09:06,870
It wasn't definitely,
wasn't that right?

1662
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,640
It was UFC 100 yeah.
Let me see.

1663
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:10,350
Yeah,

1664
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:11,183
it was the biggest paper view of all 
time was brock Lesnar's rematch with 

1665
01:09:13,981 --> 01:09:18,981
Frank Mir and GSP photo tiago album 2009
2009 it was that long ago.

1666
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:23,380
Whoa.
That's nuts.

1667
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:25,740
Yeah,
that was fucking weird.

1668
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:28,080
It's been a long fucking longer than I 
would've thought.

1669
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,040
Yeah,
definitely.

1670
01:09:29,041 --> 01:09:30,780
I guess it is like a hundred UFC is 
later.

1671
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:31,830
Yeah.
Wow.

1672
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:34,920
So seven years later he wins the title 
crazy.

1673
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:39,180
You're a look.
There's going to be the same card on the

1674
01:09:39,181 --> 01:09:40,450
same card.
Right?

1675
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:40,831
You good?
Look,

1676
01:09:40,831 --> 01:09:43,410
there's gonna be some ups and downs.
Your retina is going to get all types of

1677
01:09:43,411 --> 01:09:44,244
fucked up,
but you will be champion one day and no 

1678
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:46,974
one takes that away from him ever.
Could you imagine if him and Henderson 

1679
01:09:49,861 --> 01:09:52,020
had a rematch for the title?

1680
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,270
Good Lord.
Can that be made?

1681
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:56,493
I wonder if that could be made ethically
because if you look at all the other 

1682
01:09:59,141 --> 01:10:00,790
contenders,
all the people waiting in line,

1683
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:03,790
Chris White,
Jacques Perrey,

1684
01:10:03,791 --> 01:10:05,350
Vittorio,
there's just too many.

1685
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:06,820
Yeah,
there's too many,

1686
01:10:06,821 --> 01:10:08,200
but two,
boy,

1687
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:09,483
it's hard.
It's a hard sell because v toward just 

1688
01:10:11,771 --> 01:10:13,420
knocked out Henderson in the first 
round,

1689
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:16,420
you know it's handled.
Yeah.

1690
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:17,254
It's just man,
vito knocked out bisping in Brazil and 

1691
01:10:20,091 --> 01:10:25,091
you're knocked out rockhold but he just 
got smashed by Jacques Perrey.

1692
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,313
Everything in the middleweight division 
is just completely up in the air and 

1693
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:29,800
it's all,
it's all turned up to that.

1694
01:10:29,801 --> 01:10:31,810
So weird in MMA will happen.
Like you're kind of like,

1695
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:32,823
oh okay,
I think I know where everything's 

1696
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,433
sounds.
And then one thing changes and you're 

1697
01:10:35,521 --> 01:10:35,950
like,
oh,

1698
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:36,783
I don't know anything.
I guess you never know anything because 

1699
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:42,520
you're only looking at the guys that are
in the UFC right now and there's a whole

1700
01:10:42,521 --> 01:10:43,354
fucking series of murders that are out 
there that are just getting ready to 

1701
01:10:46,301 --> 01:10:47,110
enter.

1702
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:47,943
And there's young kids that are like 20 
that are just coming into their own and 

1703
01:10:50,381 --> 01:10:52,830
in four years they might be the best 
fighter in the world.

1704
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,980
Yeah,
there's so many of,

1705
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:54,883
so it's like,
could the cody garb brands that are 

1706
01:10:56,321 --> 01:10:57,310
emerging,
you know,

1707
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:00,640
they emerge then with one fight against 
Almeda you'd go,

1708
01:11:00,641 --> 01:11:03,460
oh Jesus,
this kid is fucking killer.

1709
01:11:03,461 --> 01:11:07,210
And the 135 pound division and one of 
the top contenders now instantly.

1710
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,250
Yeah,
with one standout performance,

1711
01:11:09,251 --> 01:11:10,280
you know,
and there's just good,

1712
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:12,370
there'll be more divisions.
Like you were kind of talking about that

1713
01:11:12,371 --> 01:11:13,440
when we were at the store the other 
night.

1714
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:15,630
Like you want to see more divisions and 
Emma,

1715
01:11:15,631 --> 01:11:17,460
there'll be more divisions,
more fighters I think.

1716
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:18,390
Right?
I hope so.

1717
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:19,403
I hope so.
There hasn't been enough progress in 

1718
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:21,264
that.
I really think that this should be a 

1719
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:23,700
weight class every 10 pounds.

1720
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,860
I really do.
I think there's a lot of,

1721
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,650
there's a lot of opportunities for not 
just more champions,

1722
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:29,484
which I think is better for the sport,
but guys to be able to fight in their 

1723
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:33,960
actual weight class would be 
competitive.

1724
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,230
There's some gaps like 85 to two oh five
man,

1725
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:38,640
there's a,
that's a big gap.

1726
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,430
That is a giant gap,
a 20 pound gap.

1727
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,380
And you know,
most guys,

1728
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:44,850
they're probably going to be in the 
middle.

1729
01:11:44,851 --> 01:11:49,851
So if you had an 85 and 95 and a two o 
five that's where it should be.

1730
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:50,881
You know?
That's,

1731
01:11:50,881 --> 01:11:52,770
I think that's,
that's how boxing does.

1732
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:53,604
And also I think it gives you much more 
opportunity for you guys to fight 

1733
01:11:58,261 --> 01:12:00,420
champion versus champion,
you know,

1734
01:12:00,421 --> 01:12:03,720
and to move up or move down like fairly 
easily.

1735
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:04,703
I got,
they got an 85 can move down to 75 ways 

1736
01:12:07,111 --> 01:12:10,890
or than an 85 could go up to two oh five
and they could go back and forth and you

1737
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:14,760
could have some like really awesome a 
title unification bouts or you know,

1738
01:12:14,761 --> 01:12:16,260
champion versus champion bounce.

1739
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:16,951
Right.
Yeah.

1740
01:12:16,951 --> 01:12:18,000
No,
I think I agree with that.

1741
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:18,811
And I like,
I mean,

1742
01:12:18,811 --> 01:12:20,940
I liked seeing the people,
I like seeing the weight class.

1743
01:12:20,941 --> 01:12:22,740
I love Khan are moving up to fight nate.
I mean,

1744
01:12:22,741 --> 01:12:24,360
although I guess you don't need more 
weight classes.

1745
01:12:24,361 --> 01:12:27,030
You went up to one 70 yeah.
That wasn't even a move up.

1746
01:12:27,031 --> 01:12:28,980
That was just like it let's not cut.
Yeah.

1747
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:31,680
Yeah.
Well it wasn't move up and tell me,

1748
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:33,660
am I crazy about this?
But why I,

1749
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,240
I've wondered this a lot and I've never 
really gotten a good answer on it,

1750
01:12:36,241 --> 01:12:38,790
but why do we have the weight cuts?
Like,

1751
01:12:38,791 --> 01:12:39,624
why don't we just weigh in an hour 
before the event because you want to be 

1752
01:12:42,201 --> 01:12:43,740
hundred yourself before that,
fine,

1753
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:46,110
but this dangerous guys are still going 
to cut weight.

1754
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,033
That's how guys die.
Guys die from being dehydrated and 

1755
01:12:49,831 --> 01:12:50,664
getting hit in the head.

1756
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:52,860
I mean you can definitely die from just 
getting hit in the head,

1757
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:54,390
but isn't it?
Wouldn't it add,

1758
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:55,343
and maybe this is just stupid,
but wouldn't it regulate itself because 

1759
01:12:57,781 --> 01:12:58,614
it's like if the APP,
if the Wayans an hour before the fights 

1760
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:01,433
and you're going to dehydrate yourself,
you're going to get fucked up in the 

1761
01:13:03,691 --> 01:13:04,524
fight.
Like you're not going to have time to 

1762
01:13:05,401 --> 01:13:06,234
replenish yourself,
but why do this whole thing where we're 

1763
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:11,550
weighing in and out 24 hours before guys
are dehydrating themselves,

1764
01:13:11,551 --> 01:13:13,520
then refuel it.
Why not just fight the way connor,

1765
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:15,540
nate fought to very good point and be 
hydrated.

1766
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,673
It's a very good point.
Another point could be to outlaw weight 

1767
01:13:19,831 --> 01:13:20,664
cutting entirely and to check people all
throughout camp and to make match ups 

1768
01:13:24,271 --> 01:13:26,090
based on size.
Like look at,

1769
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,300
look at two guys.
You know,

1770
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:28,830
you say,
what do you walk around that?

1771
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,450
What do you walk around that?
Okay,

1772
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:32,250
you guys will be fighting at that 
weight,

1773
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,500
you know,
or whatever the weight is when you're in

1774
01:13:34,501 --> 01:13:35,370
best shape.
You know,

1775
01:13:35,371 --> 01:13:38,100
if you get down to one 75 when you're in
your best shape,

1776
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,260
you,
you tell us what that number is,

1777
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:42,510
tell us what that number is.
We'll match you up accordingly.

1778
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:46,410
And we're going to chess people's 
hydration levels all throughout camp.

1779
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:48,040
We're going to show up just like you 
sought it,

1780
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:50,870
does and test you for drugs.
We're going to make you get on a scale.

1781
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,713
I'm going to test your hydration levels.
And when you're at a a reasonably 

1782
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:56,580
hydrated level where it's healthy,
that's your weight,

1783
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,800
that's what you weigh now.
So if you want to lose weight,

1784
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:01,530
you better lose weight by,
you better do some extra running and you

1785
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:04,530
better drop some body fat,
but you're not going to be dehydrated.

1786
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,041
Yeah,
I mean,

1787
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:07,050
seeing as how we can,
we can figure all that stuff out.

1788
01:14:07,051 --> 01:14:08,700
It just seems like there'd be an easier 
answer.

1789
01:14:08,701 --> 01:14:09,211
Now,
of course.

1790
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:10,980
Obviously there's,
there's the commissions in the way,

1791
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:11,823
which I don't,
I don't believe in any government 

1792
01:14:13,061 --> 01:14:13,894
regulations,
so I don't think they should be there 

1793
01:14:14,501 --> 01:14:16,660
for any commission has done a fantastic 
job.

1794
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:18,670
California Commission Commissions,
no joke.

1795
01:14:18,671 --> 01:14:20,380
This guy,
Andy foster who runs it,

1796
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:25,570
I think he runs a great organization and
what he did was the opposite approach.

1797
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,570
He let them weigh in from 10:00
AM to 2:00

1798
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:30,100
PM he gave him an open window.
He said,

1799
01:14:30,101 --> 01:14:31,120
look,
we're going to be open.

1800
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:32,680
Just come down to wait.
We don't want,

1801
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:36,010
this is what he didn't want.
He doesn't want guys dehydrated standing

1802
01:14:36,011 --> 01:14:38,650
around,
weakening themselves for that one moment

1803
01:14:38,651 --> 01:14:41,500
where they have to stand on on the scale
in front of a camera.

1804
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:43,870
He's like,
this is all an artificially orchestrated

1805
01:14:43,871 --> 01:14:44,621
event.
He's like,

1806
01:14:44,621 --> 01:14:46,210
how about this?
We'll have them,

1807
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:47,163
they'll come in,
we'll have athletic commission officers 

1808
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:52,150
ready on standby all morning for these 
guys to weigh in.

1809
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:53,650
They come in,
they weigh in.

1810
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:56,350
Then once we record it,
make sure they're cool,

1811
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:59,110
they can rehydrate and they have many,
many more hours to rehydrate.

1812
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:02,080
So guys,
we're rehydrating six hours earlier.

1813
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:03,093
Most of the guys showed up at 10:00
AM they made weight and then they had 

1814
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:06,874
way more time.
So when you saw people stand on the 

1815
01:15:08,111 --> 01:15:10,510
scale,
I was saying official weight,

1816
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:13,000
when I was announcing it,
they had weighed in at 10 o'clock in the

1817
01:15:13,001 --> 01:15:15,100
morning.
So it was already four in the afternoon.

1818
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:18,550
These guys were hydrated and thick.
No one looks sick.

1819
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:21,490
So at least visually,
no one looked like,

1820
01:15:21,491 --> 01:15:22,324
like conor mcgregor looked when he 
fought Chad Mendez when they weighed in 

1821
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:25,510
and he looked like a dead man.

1822
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,440
Dead man cheeks were all sucked in.
It looks horrible.

1823
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:30,221
I mean,
look,

1824
01:15:30,221 --> 01:15:31,660
you did good in the fight.
Yeah.

1825
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,040
But uh,
he really did.

1826
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:35,590
He cuts a lot to get to one 45.
He's a big boy.

1827
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,320
He's a big boy.
He's way bigger than,

1828
01:15:38,321 --> 01:15:40,690
um,
like Jose Aldo and Josie all was cutting

1829
01:15:40,691 --> 01:15:42,070
a lot at one point in his career.
I,

1830
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:43,030
by the way,
I've never,

1831
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:46,000
and I'm a hardcore fan,
I've never enjoyed the fight more than I

1832
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:47,650
enjoyed nate Diaz,
conor mcgregor.

1833
01:15:47,651 --> 01:15:49,240
I was turning over lots of my mind so 
much.

1834
01:15:49,241 --> 01:15:50,130
At the end of the fight.
I mean,

1835
01:15:50,131 --> 01:15:52,010
I'm like a huge Diaz Fan.
Yeah.

1836
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:53,650
And that was just incredible.
I mean,

1837
01:15:53,651 --> 01:15:54,930
I'm 10 days notice.
Yup.

1838
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:58,210
Well that whole um,
two card or that to fight,

1839
01:15:58,340 --> 01:15:59,170
um,
event,

1840
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:01,120
the two fights,
the final fights,

1841
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,133
the Holly Holm you should take was one 
of the most exciting endings to any 

1842
01:16:04,061 --> 01:16:04,894
fight ever.

1843
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:05,763
When Misha took holly down in the fifth 
round a fight when she was losing it 

1844
01:16:08,171 --> 01:16:10,720
took her back and choked her.
That's insane.

1845
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:13,060
I read an article today where someone 
was saying that it was,

1846
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:15,370
that me should loss virtually every 
second.

1847
01:16:15,371 --> 01:16:17,980
It was from a guy I respect a writer and
she wanted the second,

1848
01:16:17,981 --> 01:16:18,920
I was like,
what are you talking about?

1849
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:21,040
The second round she took her down and 
pounded her.

1850
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:22,480
I think they did they give her a 10,
eight,

1851
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,640
yes.
It didn't just get,

1852
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,360
and they should,
she dominated.

1853
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:26,283
So I read this article,
this is espn writer wrote it and I was 

1854
01:16:27,821 --> 01:16:28,780
like,
wait a minute man.

1855
01:16:28,781 --> 01:16:29,860
Come on.
You can't say that like,

1856
01:16:29,861 --> 01:16:31,200
why are you saying that?
Like that's,

1857
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:32,960
that's silly hyperbole.
Right.

1858
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:34,660
It doesn't even make any sense.
Um,

1859
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:40,150
and me show it was threatening in the 
third and fourth after that holly was on

1860
01:16:40,151 --> 01:16:40,530
her bike.

1861
01:16:40,530 --> 01:16:41,650
She was like,
fuck this.

1862
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:42,783
Like she was fighting perfect and super 
cautious with no chances and barely 

1863
01:16:46,181 --> 01:16:47,220
winning those rounds,
you know,

1864
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,270
just winning them but barely winning.
It wasn't nothing,

1865
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:51,130
nothing big happened and definitely no 
threat.

1866
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:54,730
So that victory when Miesha tate choked 
out,

1867
01:16:54,731 --> 01:16:55,564
holly and Holly's punching in the air,
like how fucking dramatic is that going 

1868
01:16:58,271 --> 01:17:00,910
out cold punching in the air while she's
going out.

1869
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:01,983
And then nate beating up connor and that
second round after he gets fucked up in 

1870
01:17:05,351 --> 01:17:06,184
the first round,
beating him up in the second round and 

1871
01:17:07,931 --> 01:17:09,410
then choking him.
Yeah,

1872
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:11,410
insane.
Probably what two,

1873
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:13,670
two of the most exciting finishes to any
fight ever.

1874
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:14,563
And the,
and the corner thing was just insane 

1875
01:17:16,281 --> 01:17:18,330
because he was on a tear that was like,
you know,

1876
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:21,590
one of the biggest tears and MMA history
and uh,

1877
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:22,820
to watch it go down like that.

1878
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:23,653
Especially like you said,
like he was winning the fight and then 

1879
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:28,310
nate turns it around and it was almost 
like on a drop of a dime,

1880
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:29,300
like nay,
nay,

1881
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:32,600
like came to life in that second round 
and starts talking shit.

1882
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:34,620
So it was really fun in a home for the 
job.

1883
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:36,950
Yeah,
you hit him with that big one too and it

1884
01:17:36,951 --> 01:17:37,784
was like,
oh,

1885
01:17:38,250 --> 01:17:40,610
has a snake,
like one to two.

1886
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:44,180
He like whap and then he liked slithers 
around.

1887
01:17:44,181 --> 01:17:46,670
You can't find them with the counter.
He's really good.

1888
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:47,533
And there's no one worse than a nate or 
Nick Diaz to get hurt by in a fight 

1889
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:53,990
because once they hurt you,
they just like,

1890
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:54,853
they push a pace and then when you get 
hurt they like pick it up and pick it 

1891
01:17:57,441 --> 01:17:58,251
up.
And then all of a sudden,

1892
01:17:58,251 --> 01:17:59,084
I mean before you know it,
conner's hit like 25 fucking times on 

1893
01:18:01,821 --> 01:18:03,410
the feet and he's shooting for a take 
down.

1894
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:04,303
Those guys are always doing triathlons.
So even though nate is like you're 

1895
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,430
taking that fight in 11 days notice and 
he wasn't in shape,

1896
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,250
he's still in way better shape than most
people.

1897
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:16,100
So like him going five rounds is not 
unfeasible.

1898
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:16,963
It's not,
it's not outside of the realm of 

1899
01:18:17,841 --> 01:18:19,670
imagination.
He's in shape.

1900
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:20,593
He's just not the kind of shape that 
he's going to be when they have a 

1901
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:26,120
rematch.
And that becomes a real fucking problem.

1902
01:18:26,121 --> 01:18:28,420
Cause I think he's going to beat him up 
again with nate sad.

1903
01:18:28,421 --> 01:18:29,480
He's like goes,
he goes,

1904
01:18:29,481 --> 01:18:30,380
I,
if I had a camp,

1905
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:31,910
we wouldn't have fucking touch me.
He goes,

1906
01:18:31,911 --> 01:18:35,360
my plan was to go out slow in the first 
round and he came out fast enough in the

1907
01:18:35,361 --> 01:18:37,400
first round.
So I got tagged a couple times.

1908
01:18:37,401 --> 01:18:38,630
But that's so cool.
That's cool.

1909
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,040
Stick to the plan,
stick to the plan.

1910
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:41,293
And then the second round it starts 
loosening up and opening up and conor 

1911
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:44,240
was just dead.
Yeah.

1912
01:18:44,241 --> 01:18:46,070
Well I heard,
I mean people are talking to nate about,

1913
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:47,330
cause you know,
going into that fight,

1914
01:18:47,331 --> 01:18:49,520
like Connor's power was what a lot of 
people were talking about.

1915
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:49,731
Like,
you know,

1916
01:18:49,731 --> 01:18:53,280
we put one punch on Josie Aldos Chin and
he's out and he's talking,

1917
01:18:53,310 --> 01:18:54,650
he's like,
they can't handle my power.

1918
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:56,030
I don't do courses as well.
But uh,

1919
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:57,263
but uh,
and nate was saying in one of the post 

1920
01:18:58,791 --> 01:18:59,624
fight interviews where it was like,
I'm spoiling with Andre Ward and Joe 

1921
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:03,613
Schilling and like heavyweight boxers.
I'm doing rounds with heavyweight 

1922
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:05,804
boxers.
There's nothing you're going to hit him 

1923
01:19:07,851 --> 01:19:11,220
with that he hasn't seen or kind of 
dealt with when he's,

1924
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:12,110
I mean,
you know,

1925
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:14,240
like talking like Andre Ward and Joe 
Schilling,

1926
01:19:14,241 --> 01:19:14,540
like,
yeah,

1927
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:16,550
decent strike.
You're saying literally the best,

1928
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:17,413
the best,
the best inboxing and the best of the 

1929
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:19,933
kickboxing.

1930
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:20,773
Well,
Joe Schilling cuts wait to kickbox at 

1931
01:19:22,641 --> 01:19:27,410
185 pounds and knocks dude's dead dead 
with one punch.

1932
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:31,550
So that guy is sparring with nate on a 
regular basis.

1933
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:35,690
Andre Ward,
who is one of the best fucking boxers on

1934
01:19:35,691 --> 01:19:39,350
the planet earth.
One of the slickest said that nate gives

1935
01:19:39,351 --> 01:19:40,820
as good as it gets when they split.
Yeah,

1936
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:42,500
yeah,
that's crazy.

1937
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,000
And I think Joe Schilling,
I might be getting it,

1938
01:19:44,001 --> 01:19:44,834
but I think Joe Schilling said he's 
never hurt either one of them in a 

1939
01:19:46,461 --> 01:19:47,294
sparring session.
I think he said that on a fighter and 

1940
01:19:49,131 --> 01:19:49,690
the kid,
ah,

1941
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:51,620
I believe it man.
Tough fucking dudes,

1942
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,210
man.
Tough fucking dudes.

1943
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:54,223
But what's fascinating to me is that he 
wanted to jump right back in there and 

1944
01:19:58,341 --> 01:20:00,530
do it again.
And that nate wanted to,

1945
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:03,110
or that I'm connor wanted to just run it
back and I was like,

1946
01:20:03,111 --> 01:20:04,850
wow,
that's interesting.

1947
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:08,460
It seems weird that he gets to do that.
Not so much that he wants to,

1948
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:10,200
but it just seems weird that they were 
like,

1949
01:20:10,201 --> 01:20:11,034
uh,
like even when Dana White was talking 

1950
01:20:11,551 --> 01:20:12,540
about in his like,
look man,

1951
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,550
we tried to convince them to go down to 
one 45.

1952
01:20:14,551 --> 01:20:15,640
And he was like,
nate's the y'all.

1953
01:20:15,641 --> 01:20:16,021
I was like,
wait,

1954
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:18,930
he's the matchmaker now.
He just gets to go let them.

1955
01:20:18,931 --> 01:20:20,670
If you want,
if you want to make a ton of money,

1956
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:21,181
right?
Man,

1957
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:24,420
I believe in the market and that guy's,
that guy's what people want to see.

1958
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:26,580
He can do what he can do.
Whatever he wants to do,

1959
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:27,643
it's going to get a big pay day off it.
But it's not just that the emperor has 

1960
01:20:30,061 --> 01:20:32,100
been stripped down.
Okay.

1961
01:20:32,101 --> 01:20:34,650
So now he's exposed.
So now someone's beating them.

1962
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:37,410
So here's the thing,
what do you do now?

1963
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:39,030
You want to make money?
Okay.

1964
01:20:39,031 --> 01:20:41,370
Cause if you want to make money,
you make the biggest fight you can right

1965
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:44,970
now while he's been exposed.
And the biggest fight for sure,

1966
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,110
he said,
when I say expose,

1967
01:20:46,111 --> 01:20:48,320
I don't mean he's not talented.
I mean exposed,

1968
01:20:48,321 --> 01:20:52,290
meaning he's a human and he can lose.
And that happens with every fighter they

1969
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:53,430
lose.
And once they lose,

1970
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:55,170
people go,
oh,

1971
01:20:55,171 --> 01:20:57,030
you can be beat.
You know,

1972
01:20:57,031 --> 01:20:57,864
we saw it with Anderson Silva.
You saw it with Mike Tyson when after 

1973
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:02,760
Mike Tyson fight buster Douglas,
who was a different world.

1974
01:21:03,270 --> 01:21:04,440
Everybody was like,
oh,

1975
01:21:04,441 --> 01:21:06,810
he's human.
So I say exposed,

1976
01:21:06,811 --> 01:21:09,570
not in a disrespectful way,
but got exposed.

1977
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,433
He lost.
He got choked out and got beaten up on 

1978
01:21:11,281 --> 01:21:13,080
the ground and then he got choked out 
quick.

1979
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,273
So this is not an invulnerable,
perfect fighter who's unbelievably 

1980
01:21:17,491 --> 01:21:18,610
durable,
right?

1981
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:20,700
Who can take punishment like no man.

1982
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:21,623
There's a lot of those guys in the UFC,
there's champions like that in the UFC 

1983
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:26,640
that are like Robbie lawler,
unbelievably durable.

1984
01:21:26,790 --> 01:21:30,270
You can't put him away.
It's fucking hard to put that guy away.

1985
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:33,120
We're not talking about that.
We're talking about a guy got dinged up,

1986
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:35,330
shot for a Shitty,
wide open take down,

1987
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:36,293
take him down and got demolished on the 
ground and got choked unconscious 

1988
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:40,530
quickly afterwards.
So,

1989
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:41,803
all right.
What do you do?

1990
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:46,530
Could that happen with dos Anjos fuck.
Yad could dosantos could do that too.

1991
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:47,520
It's possible.
I mean,

1992
01:21:47,521 --> 01:21:48,930
condom might knock 'em out.
You never know.

1993
01:21:48,931 --> 01:21:49,764
Conner does have that punch,
but you got to put him in against nate 

1994
01:21:53,161 --> 01:21:54,720
again because that's the big money 
rematch.

1995
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:55,583
And if,
if this guy turns out to be a guy who's 

1996
01:21:58,171 --> 01:22:01,500
going to win some and lose some and the 
beginning of his career,

1997
01:22:01,501 --> 01:22:04,740
this unbeatable wild Celtic warrior 
character.

1998
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:06,960
Oh that's all gone.
But he's champ.

1999
01:22:06,961 --> 01:22:09,330
He's still got a belt at one 45 yeah,
I'm so,

2000
01:22:09,331 --> 01:22:12,390
it's almost kind of like a weird 
position for now.

2001
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:13,890
But I mean,
here's my question.

2002
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,620
When I say for now,
can you really keep banking that weight?

2003
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:17,730
That's what I'm saying.
Well,

2004
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:18,573
I've wondered about that too.
I've heard some people have argued with 

2005
01:22:20,401 --> 01:22:21,001
me saying like,
no,

2006
01:22:21,001 --> 01:22:22,380
he can make the weight.
Cause he was,

2007
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,510
he was what it was.
He one 69 against.

2008
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:27,270
So they're saying he basically,
that's what he starts at and he can just

2009
01:22:27,271 --> 01:22:28,980
cut down from there.
That's a lot.

2010
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:31,200
But look what he looked like at the,
at the way in.

2011
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:33,030
So maybe you can,
I mean he kind of,

2012
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,910
he definitely can do it.
It's physically possible.

2013
01:22:35,911 --> 01:22:39,300
I was so looking forward to the press 
conference though,

2014
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,860
just because I can't,
you know,

2015
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:45,240
you've got this guy in connor who's like
the ultimate shit talker and then you've

2016
01:22:45,241 --> 01:22:47,160
got nate who,
I mean the first,

2017
01:22:47,161 --> 01:22:49,350
the dynamic of the first press 
conference was amazing.

2018
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:52,290
It was amazing.
And at that moment when he was just like

2019
01:22:52,291 --> 01:22:55,260
kind of talking circles around nate and 
they just broke and he goes,

2020
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:57,750
how about this?
Fuck you fuck your belt.

2021
01:22:57,751 --> 01:23:00,360
Fuck this press conference.
Like they just went to gangster on them.

2022
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:01,613
But now like how can con I was so 
interested like how can he show up and 

2023
01:23:05,651 --> 01:23:06,930
talk shit like that.
Yeah.

2024
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:10,330
When nate's got the perfect rebuttal 
that anything he has to say,

2025
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:11,223
okay John,
10 days [inaudible] st all kinds of 

2026
01:23:12,311 --> 01:23:14,620
crazy stuff.
Like the first eight minutes were easy,

2027
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:17,590
eh?
Yeah.

2028
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:19,740
But here's the difference between the 
first day I,

2029
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:22,330
her last three minutes,
the last three were a lot worse.

2030
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:23,620
Yeah,
they were awful.

2031
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:25,390
Like you got fucked up,
man.

2032
01:23:25,391 --> 01:23:26,224
Do you got to just accept that?
But that's part of his thing is that he 

2033
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:34,040
has to like look at things in the most 
positive light possible.

2034
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:35,440
And Man,
I don't know.

2035
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:38,200
Um,
I think stylistically it's a troublesome

2036
01:23:38,201 --> 01:23:39,034
fight for him because nate is a very 
clever boxer and his ground game is a 

2037
01:23:42,161 --> 01:23:44,710
world away from where connor is right 
now.

2038
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:48,610
And I've seen nate role with guys.
He's a fucking legit,

2039
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:52,900
very high level Brazilian Jiu Jitsu 
black belt under a very respected camp.

2040
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,930
His cardio was outstanding,
his boxing's nasty.

2041
01:23:55,931 --> 01:23:58,330
So where's Connor's shining?
The only way I think,

2042
01:23:58,331 --> 01:23:59,170
I mean,
I guess there's like,

2043
01:23:59,171 --> 01:23:59,840
you know,
it's,

2044
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,800
it's really hard to like fight a diaz 
brother and beat them.

2045
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:06,250
You usually when people beat them,
it's kind of like they really stick to a

2046
01:24:06,251 --> 01:24:07,084
strategy.
You got to kind of take them down and 

2047
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,350
avoid submissions or like leg kick and 
circle.

2048
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:14,650
I hope on Joe's beat him up in that way.
But you know what,

2049
01:24:14,651 --> 01:24:16,690
there's also different show up.
Well,

2050
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:17,620
there's also,
you know,

2051
01:24:17,621 --> 01:24:18,610
different camps.

2052
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:19,870
You know,
you're coming in,

2053
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:22,120
who knows what kind of fucking injuries 
you're dealing with.

2054
01:24:22,121 --> 01:24:25,300
You know,
you see a guy like nate come in and look

2055
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,970
really kind of lackadaisical against,
um,

2056
01:24:28,410 --> 01:24:29,243
Hoffeld dos Anjos den.
You see him come back and look shredded 

2057
01:24:32,171 --> 01:24:34,060
against Michael Johnson and looks 
sensational.

2058
01:24:34,061 --> 01:24:34,894
So you go,
okay,

2059
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:37,180
that's what he's capable of when he's on
and focus,

2060
01:24:37,181 --> 01:24:38,830
you gotta be ready for that guy.
And I think that,

2061
01:24:38,831 --> 01:24:39,970
yeah,
that's the best he's ever looked at.

2062
01:24:39,971 --> 01:24:41,330
You and Michael Johnson fight.
Yeah.

2063
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:44,140
You can't think that the guy who lost 
dos Anjos is showing up.

2064
01:24:44,410 --> 01:24:45,243
You got to think of the guy that came 
out and swarmed cowboy in the first 

2065
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:48,520
round is coming.
Like,

2066
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:52,600
that guy's a clever fucking boxer.
So where does connor shine?

2067
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,370
Knock out power?
That's where he shines.

2068
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:58,140
Like connor can dead dudes,
but he couldn't do it.

2069
01:24:58,340 --> 01:24:59,530
Yeah,
they're tough to hit.

2070
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,930
They have great head movement and Green 
Chins and they there,

2071
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,160
they roll with punches.
Well,

2072
01:25:03,161 --> 01:25:06,340
the only guy to ever stopped nate was 
Josh Thompson and Josh did.

2073
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:09,370
It was a brutal head kick.
And Josh Thompson to this day,

2074
01:25:09,371 --> 01:25:11,620
I say it's one of the most underrated 
guys.

2075
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:14,020
He just,
he did the stars,

2076
01:25:14,021 --> 01:25:14,854
did not align for him,
but he could have easily been a UFC 

2077
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:17,224
champion.
He was champion a strikeforce and with 

2078
01:25:19,391 --> 01:25:21,280
Gilbert and him and Gilbert went back 
and forth,

2079
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:23,650
you know,
Josh Thompson's worldclass fighters.

2080
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:25,960
So when Josh Thompson head kicked him,
you know,

2081
01:25:25,961 --> 01:25:28,810
it's like Josh to do that to anybody in 
that division and then it catches you.

2082
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:30,310
You know,
you're fucked.

2083
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:33,290
He sees the older now and he's just,
you know,

2084
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:35,230
I think he's a guy that like,
like I said,

2085
01:25:35,231 --> 01:25:39,370
the stars didn't like perfectly aligned,
but like skill wise and technique wise,

2086
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:43,480
he's a fucking world class fighter.
So when he knocked out nate Diaz,

2087
01:25:43,481 --> 01:25:47,680
it's not necessarily an indication that 
nate diaz has done because just,

2088
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:49,450
you know,
that's how good Josh Thompson is.

2089
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:50,680
Yeah.
And at the time,

2090
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:52,690
and then,
so nate rebounds from that.

2091
01:25:52,691 --> 01:25:55,050
And I think people,
you look at like the losses,

2092
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:57,640
like the Dos Anjos fight,
and you look at that,

2093
01:25:57,641 --> 01:25:59,680
the Josh Thomson fight,
and you go,

2094
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:01,030
well,
how good is he?

2095
01:26:01,031 --> 01:26:02,110
You know,
I could beat that guy.

2096
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:04,190
But then you look at the Michael Johnson
finding

2097
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:06,770
go,
Ooh that that guy is fucking dangerous.

2098
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:08,750
Jim Miller.
Serone exactly.

2099
01:26:08,751 --> 01:26:10,910
Lot of these fights where he just 
unbelievable.

2100
01:26:11,410 --> 01:26:13,160
Uh,
and I think uh,

2101
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:14,543
it's,
it's one of those things were styles 

2102
01:26:15,321 --> 01:26:16,154
make fights and you know,
kind of really gotten people's heads by 

2103
01:26:17,661 --> 01:26:19,340
talking shit.
And I felt like going in,

2104
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:20,174
I was like,
I don't think you're going to get in 

2105
01:26:20,331 --> 01:26:22,730
nate's head by talking shit.
He's not that guy.

2106
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:23,923
How about this?
My crew will fuck up your whole crew 

2107
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:27,830
gangster thing you could say,
by the way,

2108
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:30,200
that's the most gangster thing cause 
he's literally just going,

2109
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:33,890
we'll fucking jump you like we're not 
playing around here.

2110
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:36,050
And all those guys,
even the guys who seem like kind of Nice

2111
01:26:36,051 --> 01:26:37,850
guys in his team,
like jake shields,

2112
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:38,953
you feel like he'll fucking jump.
You guys are fuck area and it'll kick 

2113
01:26:41,781 --> 01:26:42,614
your ass.

2114
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:45,250
What?
That's some breaking news.

2115
01:26:45,251 --> 01:26:46,990
That's it.
Since we've been going live.

2116
01:26:46,991 --> 01:26:51,991
The first one is this UFC lifts ban and 
reporter Ariel Helwani.

2117
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:56,800
Oh the second one is a little less 
exciting.

2118
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:57,791
Wait a minute,
hold on.

2119
01:26:57,791 --> 01:26:58,624
Go back to that.
It says reported that wrestler Brock 

2120
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,710
Lesnar's didn't talks for attorney UFC 
200 preempting a UFC announcement.

2121
01:27:05,711 --> 01:27:08,140
Officials issued a life band against 
him.

2122
01:27:08,141 --> 01:27:10,420
The organization reverse a decision 
Monday.

2123
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:12,653
That's kind of cool because that means 
that like public support made them lift 

2124
01:27:16,901 --> 01:27:17,734
that,
but it also must mean that they worked 

2125
01:27:19,871 --> 01:27:20,704
out whatever the fuck it was.
See this is what they were saying and 

2126
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:26,170
this is,
this is what I'm hearing.

2127
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:27,070
Okay.
Let me just,

2128
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:28,990
I don't,
I haven't talked to Ariel,

2129
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,090
but let me just give you the UFC 
perspective.

2130
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:33,850
The UFC perspective was that there was a
mole.

2131
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,073
They believe that someone was giving 
Ariel information and that information 

2132
01:27:38,651 --> 01:27:42,040
he was using to scoop the UFC official 
promotions.

2133
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,260
So the UFC,
which is a private company,

2134
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:46,570
you know,
they don't have to have,

2135
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:48,900
if you don't have to let people in to 
your,

2136
01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:49,883
your business,
your private companies to come and 

2137
01:27:51,161 --> 01:27:51,994
report.
And so they felt like he was somehow or 

2138
01:27:53,981 --> 01:27:56,460
another getting ahold of this inside 
information,

2139
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:57,303
releasing it and making them look bad.
Now I get the UFC is perspective that 

2140
01:28:01,931 --> 01:28:06,070
they would want to know who the fuck is 
leaking this secret information and that

2141
01:28:06,071 --> 01:28:06,904
they don't,
they don't want this guy taking that 

2142
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:10,960
information and then putting it live.
Now,

2143
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:13,570
from what I understand,
the conversation with him was,

2144
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,333
don't do this because if you do this,
there's only a handful of people that 

2145
01:28:17,861 --> 01:28:18,694
know this information.
So we're going to fire everybody or 

2146
01:28:21,041 --> 01:28:23,380
we're going to fire a bunch of people 
and you're gonna ruin people's lives.

2147
01:28:23,890 --> 01:28:24,910
This is what I was told.

2148
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:27,820
It was a conversation they had with him 
after that conversation.

2149
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:31,630
He leaked the brock lesnar stuff so 
that,

2150
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:34,930
I don't know if that's true.
I would have to talk to Arielle.

2151
01:28:34,931 --> 01:28:37,480
You'd have to get his opinion.
You'd have to get the UFC as opinion.

2152
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:38,583
You'd have to get the two of them 
together to debate whether or not which 

2153
01:28:41,411 --> 01:28:42,244
story was true.
But this is the side that you're not 

2154
01:28:44,651 --> 01:28:45,484
hearing.
So all you're hearing is the UFC banned 

2155
01:28:46,961 --> 01:28:50,350
him for life and everybody was upset.
So I like Ariel.

2156
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:53,230
I think errol is a very good reporter.
I think he's a very bright guy.

2157
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:56,170
I'm good friends with his uncle Gad sad,
who's a,

2158
01:28:56,171 --> 01:28:57,490
a full disclosure.
Awesome.

2159
01:28:58,270 --> 01:28:59,260
Uh,
just a brilliant,

2160
01:28:59,261 --> 01:29:03,150
brilliant professor in Montreal.
I love that guy.

2161
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:06,720
So I like Ariel and I,
the whole thing was bumming me out.

2162
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:07,740
I was looking at my twitter feed.

2163
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:08,880
I was like,
oh fucking.

2164
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:12,660
But th there's certain things like this.
You got to kind of let the dust settle.

2165
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,000
So the dust settled,
they lifted the ban.

2166
01:29:15,210 --> 01:29:16,043
I'm very happy with that.
But you gotta be careful when it comes 

2167
01:29:19,471 --> 01:29:20,304
to see.
Here's the thing about this leaking 

2168
01:29:21,721 --> 01:29:22,554
information.
People say it was just doing his job 

2169
01:29:23,611 --> 01:29:24,780
reporting.
I get that.

2170
01:29:24,781 --> 01:29:25,614
I understand that.
But you have to realize this isn't like 

2171
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:30,890
news that is not going to get out.
That's going to affect people's health.

2172
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:31,733
We're trying to make an announcement.
This is a private company that is 

2173
01:29:34,771 --> 01:29:37,320
spending millions of dollars to promote 
these events.

2174
01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:41,820
So all you're doing is just like getting
it on you.

2175
01:29:42,260 --> 01:29:47,260
You're taking the gun right out that 
door and to the right hand side,

2176
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:49,310
all you're doing,
if you're,

2177
01:29:49,311 --> 01:29:50,144
if you're scooping it,
is you're shining the attention on 

2178
01:29:52,231 --> 01:29:55,490
yourself.
What I'd like Ariel for is not him shine

2179
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:56,550
the attention on himself.

2180
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:57,503
What I like aerial fours.
I think he's a very bright guy and I 

2181
01:29:59,521 --> 01:30:00,354
think he's very insightful when it comes
to fights and strategies and things 

2182
01:30:02,971 --> 01:30:03,804
along those lines,
so I don't think it's important that he 

2183
01:30:06,631 --> 01:30:07,464
break the news before the UFC does and I
think if the UFC doesn't want him to do 

2184
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:12,114
that because this is private information
in a private company and they're trying 

2185
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:17,370
to control the press release,
I don't buy that.

2186
01:30:17,371 --> 01:30:20,610
That's necessarily like under the guise 
of journalism.

2187
01:30:20,611 --> 01:30:21,444
I think it's like there's some,
there's some fuckery with that because 

2188
01:30:24,151 --> 01:30:26,040
we're not talking about like,
oh he,

2189
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:31,220
he found out about some horrible thing 
that happened that someone's covering up

2190
01:30:31,711 --> 01:30:32,544
or he found out about corruption in 
government or he found out about a 

2191
01:30:35,431 --> 01:30:37,380
person got shot by the police.
This isn't,

2192
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:40,140
this is not like that kind of news.
This is,

2193
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,490
they're going to release it.

2194
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:42,593
It's going to,
you're just trying to do it before they 

2195
01:30:43,711 --> 01:30:47,250
do it and you're finding it.
If it's true that there's a mole,

2196
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:51,420
you're finding it out through some sort 
of a sneaky method that these people all

2197
01:30:51,421 --> 01:30:54,570
sign nondisclosure agreements and 
they're all not supposed to release that

2198
01:30:54,571 --> 01:30:58,200
information because the UFC wanted to 
make that big cool announcement.

2199
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:02,670
Now when that big cool announcement 
happened at UFC one 99 I was working all

2200
01:31:02,671 --> 01:31:04,320
day.
I was doing commentary all day,

2201
01:31:04,321 --> 01:31:07,800
so I didn't go online and I wasn't 
reading any of the MMA sites,

2202
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:09,930
so I didn't know that Ariel had already 
scooped it.

2203
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,080
So when I saw that Promo and I saw brock
Lesnar,

2204
01:31:13,081 --> 01:31:14,340
can you see me?
Oh,

2205
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:16,080
I was like,
what does that mean?

2206
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:17,460
Was this real?
Like what?

2207
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,353
Like that was a real reaction by me.
I had no fucking idea whatsoever that 

2208
01:31:23,821 --> 01:31:26,970
brock lesnar was going to be at UFC 200 
I didn't either.

2209
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:28,500
No one around me knew what was 
happening.

2210
01:31:28,501 --> 01:31:31,920
We didn't see the promo right in here.
That's what the UFC wanted.

2211
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:32,783
They wanted that and they felt like him 
releasing that early ruin that for the 

2212
01:31:37,081 --> 01:31:40,590
people that read his article and I see 
their point of view,

2213
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:44,190
I see their perspective and I also see 
their perspective as a private company.

2214
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:45,173
Now people are saying that he's just 
doing his job and it's just journalism 

2215
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:48,240
folks.
This,

2216
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,133
this is not hidden information.
This is not stuff that wasn't going to 

2217
01:31:52,501 --> 01:31:56,220
come out for sure in a couple of hours.
He knew it was,

2218
01:31:56,221 --> 01:31:57,054
everybody knew it was.
So this is a very tricky thing and it's 

2219
01:31:59,411 --> 01:32:00,244
also,
he had apparently scooped nate diaz 

2220
01:32:02,410 --> 01:32:05,320
versus conor Mcgregor.
He had done that and that was when,

2221
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:06,393
this is again what I'm hearing.
When they had a talk with them they'll 

2222
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:09,760
like,
look,

2223
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:10,593
if you fucking do this,
you're going to ruin people's lives 

2224
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:13,113
because you're going to get people fired
because we're going to find out who the 

2225
01:32:14,591 --> 01:32:15,370
fuck did this.

2226
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:18,970
There's only a small handful of people.
It's not coming from brock side.

2227
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,460
It's coming somehow or another from 
inside the organization.

2228
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:23,310
So yeah,
I don't got no,

2229
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:25,180
I got no problem with the UFC doing it.
Cause,

2230
01:32:25,181 --> 01:32:26,890
I mean if everything we're saying,
you know,

2231
01:32:26,891 --> 01:32:28,270
cause obviously I don't know all the 
information,

2232
01:32:28,271 --> 01:32:29,410
but look,
it's your company,

2233
01:32:29,411 --> 01:32:30,760
it's your information.
Yes,

2234
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:33,430
you have a right to tell your employees,
don't give this out.

2235
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:37,060
And if there's evidence that one of them
is what I'm gonna fire that guy.

2236
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:37,810
Yeah.
And this is,

2237
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:39,520
this is the most important part of it 
folks.

2238
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:42,310
This is not a free speech thing is not a
freedom of the press thing.

2239
01:32:42,311 --> 01:32:46,510
Cause we're not saying that he somehow 
or another scoop,

2240
01:32:46,511 --> 01:32:50,000
some inside information that we'd have 
never gotten out is his,

2241
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:53,380
is not some secret stuff.
She has the right to say it.

2242
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:53,750
Yeah.
No,

2243
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:55,950
you shouldn't be thrown in jail.
Um,

2244
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:58,660
I don't have a kit for anyone being 
thrown in the towel,

2245
01:32:58,690 --> 01:33:01,860
but I'm saying what I'm saying is it's 
not like he unveiled,

2246
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:05,650
he uncovered some inside shit like 
Watergate.

2247
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:07,810
This was something that they were going 
to have release.

2248
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:12,960
They had a plan and he got word of that 
and jump the gun and put it out there.

2249
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:16,450
And he said he had multiple sources and 
all this different jazz.

2250
01:33:16,451 --> 01:33:17,284
But look,
it doesn't help anybody to release it 

2251
01:33:20,021 --> 01:33:20,854
early except Ariel,
she's saying it's not like he found out 

2252
01:33:22,361 --> 01:33:25,180
about some scandal going on and he was 
showing to the public,

2253
01:33:25,181 --> 01:33:27,190
that's what we like.
We want to drop this in an act.

2254
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:28,103
And by the way,
I didn't read his thing and I loved 

2255
01:33:30,341 --> 01:33:32,980
finding that news out live at the event.
It was amazing.

2256
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:34,270
Well,
and I look,

2257
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:35,710
I don't give a fuck.

2258
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:36,700
Okay.
I don't,

2259
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:38,710
I mean I think it's Kinda cool that they
had that,

2260
01:33:38,711 --> 01:33:39,544
but it doesn't bother me at all that the
information got out a few hours earlier 

2261
01:33:43,121 --> 01:33:45,190
would I've had the same reaction.
No,

2262
01:33:45,310 --> 01:33:49,840
but if I saw it in written word,
I was still at a very similar reaction.

2263
01:33:49,841 --> 01:33:50,674
Like what the fuck?
I wouldn't have had the same reaction 

2264
01:33:52,181 --> 01:33:53,860
when I saw the promo,
but come on,

2265
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:56,140
man,
I'm not into cheesy promos anyway.

2266
01:33:56,141 --> 01:33:58,220
I don't give a fuck.
I want to see matchups.

2267
01:33:58,270 --> 01:34:00,460
I don't give a shit.
Give everybody the information.

2268
01:34:00,461 --> 01:34:01,960
The moment it happens.
I don't give a fuck.

2269
01:34:01,961 --> 01:34:03,580
I don't like announcements,
all of that.

2270
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:06,280
I don't.
But that said,

2271
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:07,323
I completely understand the UFC,
his opinion or the UFC position where 

2272
01:34:10,751 --> 01:34:12,460
they have this company and you know,
people go,

2273
01:34:12,461 --> 01:34:13,540
Oh,
you're a company man,

2274
01:34:13,541 --> 01:34:14,980
you're fucking sticking up for the 
company.

2275
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:17,800
No,
just think about this for a second.

2276
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:23,190
You have a promotional campaign that 
you've created.

2277
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:28,060
You've spent more than a million dollars
promoting this UFC 200 commercial.

2278
01:34:28,061 --> 01:34:28,894
They have this whole thing and then they
tag brock Lesnar in the end and they 

2279
01:34:30,821 --> 01:34:31,960
think,
oh my God,

2280
01:34:31,961 --> 01:34:33,970
this is the fucking cherry on top of the
Sundae.

2281
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:35,013
This is going to be it.
And then someone jumps the gun and you 

2282
01:34:36,971 --> 01:34:39,370
find out that it's someone inside your 
company,

2283
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:40,263
allegedly that's leaking information.
This reporter and he's getting this 

2284
01:34:43,151 --> 01:34:43,984
information out and always doing is 
essentially scooping it and putting the 

2285
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:50,590
onus and the putting the light on 
himself.

2286
01:34:50,950 --> 01:34:51,783
No,
I think you have every right to want to 

2287
01:34:52,601 --> 01:34:53,590
fire that person.
Yeah.

2288
01:34:53,650 --> 01:34:55,210
And also every right till it's a bad 
area.

2289
01:34:55,211 --> 01:34:56,910
And I love area I think is a great 
reporter.

2290
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:58,370
I,
you know like watching his stuff.

2291
01:34:58,371 --> 01:35:00,380
I liked the MMA hour long.
Again,

2292
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,433
maybe that information that I got from 
the UFC is also incorrect and maybe 

2293
01:35:05,061 --> 01:35:07,640
that's why his ban has been lifted.

2294
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:12,530
But look,
no one wants a guy like Ariel Helwani to

2295
01:35:12,531 --> 01:35:15,170
not have a Gig.
And I think him getting banned.

2296
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,990
Honestly,
if you're an Ariel Helwani fan,

2297
01:35:17,991 --> 01:35:21,650
you should be jumping up and down for 
two reasons why you should be happy that

2298
01:35:21,651 --> 01:35:25,700
he got banned because then it makes them
like a martyr and then happy that he got

2299
01:35:25,701 --> 01:35:30,110
reinstated because now he's a hero.
So I'm an Ariel Helwani Fan,

2300
01:35:30,111 --> 01:35:32,750
so I'm happy.
I'm obviously a UFC fan,

2301
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:35,450
so I'm happy.
I'm glad they worked it out.

2302
01:35:35,451 --> 01:35:38,330
And everybody talk and get to watch a,
we get to watch brock lesnar fight.

2303
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:41,480
Exactly.
But it's these everybody that's freaking

2304
01:35:41,481 --> 01:35:44,960
out that he's only doing his job.
That's not necessarily true folks.

2305
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:46,013
It's,
it's a little bit more complicated than 

2306
01:35:47,061 --> 01:35:49,670
that because it's not like that 
information wasn't already coming out.

2307
01:35:50,090 --> 01:35:52,580
And if you have information that you 
know is going to come out,

2308
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:53,060
right.

2309
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:56,780
A fucking story about what that 
information means.

2310
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,850
Cause that's what I want at Ariel 
Helwani.

2311
01:35:59,000 --> 01:35:59,833
I think Eric [inaudible],
he's a really smart guy and he's really 

2312
01:36:01,941 --> 01:36:02,774
insightful and he's a true mma fan and 
he's a guy that is going to give you 

2313
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:07,094
some really good insight and some very,
very well articulated thoughts that I 

2314
01:36:13,041 --> 01:36:14,810
enjoy.
So I'm happy,

2315
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:16,610
I'm happy he's back,
I'm happy.

2316
01:36:16,611 --> 01:36:19,700
But that is the perspective that when I 
found out about it,

2317
01:36:19,701 --> 01:36:20,534
I had to ask.
I called and I had this conversation 

2318
01:36:23,090 --> 01:36:26,810
with people that I deeply trust and this
was the version that I was handed.

2319
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:28,370
So now everybody knows and it's so 
groovy.

2320
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:31,940
So the conspiracy theories can say he's 
working with the UFC.

2321
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:34,520
I'm a puppet.
But I mean look,

2322
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:35,893
obviously I love the UFC and obviously 
Dana white is a very good friend of 

2323
01:36:39,171 --> 01:36:41,390
mine,
so you're not going to hear me criticize

2324
01:36:41,391 --> 01:36:41,570
them.

2325
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:42,510
You know what I mean?
If I,

2326
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:45,860
if I disagree with them,
you're like,

2327
01:36:45,861 --> 01:36:47,860
he's my friend.
So it makes sense.

2328
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:48,703
That's how human interactions work.
He's like a friend and by the end he's 

2329
01:36:50,601 --> 01:36:52,370
created an amazing company.
He's the,

2330
01:36:52,371 --> 01:36:53,204
he's the reason why this sport is out 
there and you guys have worked together 

2331
01:36:55,191 --> 01:36:57,020
for.
So even if you had a falling out and you

2332
01:36:57,021 --> 01:36:58,150
were like,
I don't want to work there anymore,

2333
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:58,993
why would you go publicly?
He would never hear that from me and I 

2334
01:37:01,011 --> 01:37:02,360
would never work for anybody else 
either.

2335
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,250
I both said like if you leave the UFC or
you're like,

2336
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:05,440
what are you going to do?
He worked for bell tour.

2337
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:06,620
I'm like,
I'm not working for anybody.

2338
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:08,900
If I don't work for the UFC,
I am never doing this again.

2339
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:09,913
Yeah,
I couldn't see you commentating for 

2340
01:37:11,331 --> 01:37:13,670
another MMA blocking the chance.

2341
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:15,890
No chance,
no chance.

2342
01:37:15,891 --> 01:37:17,750
It's not even on the table.
It's not going to happen.

2343
01:37:17,870 --> 01:37:18,703
I would just won't do it anymore.
I mean I would be happy to just go back 

2344
01:37:21,621 --> 01:37:22,940
to doing stand up.
Um,

2345
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:25,790
I like being a fan and honestly,
my favorite thing to do,

2346
01:37:25,791 --> 01:37:27,050
I don't,
I love calling fights.

2347
01:37:27,051 --> 01:37:30,020
Don't get me wrong.
It's an amazing job of how to for a long

2348
01:37:30,021 --> 01:37:33,230
time.
But fight companions are even more fun,

2349
01:37:33,360 --> 01:37:34,193
right?
Like companion podcast when it's Eddie 

2350
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:38,360
Bravo and shop and Callan and was 
hanging out and watch,

2351
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:39,223
oh my God.
And we drank and eat food and talk shit 

2352
01:37:42,021 --> 01:37:43,400
and have a fights.
Boring.

2353
01:37:43,401 --> 01:37:45,620
Someone tells us a story about,
you know,

2354
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:48,080
getting laid or shitting their pants and
traffic or,

2355
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:49,640
I mean,
it's hilarious.

2356
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:53,480
The most fun.
It's the best because we get,

2357
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:54,743
look,
the best seat in the house is kind of 

2358
01:37:57,001 --> 01:37:58,470
their live where I sit.

2359
01:37:58,530 --> 01:38:00,300
So I do kind of have the best seat in 
the house.

2360
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:01,493
But honestly watching it on TV might be 
the best seat in the house because you 

2361
01:38:05,701 --> 01:38:08,180
don't get the obstruction of the cage.
I've been,

2362
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:09,990
well look,
I don't like the UFC is,

2363
01:38:09,991 --> 01:38:10,824
I've been to,
I don't have like the great fucking 

2364
01:38:12,001 --> 01:38:13,040
seats either.
I've sat and just,

2365
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:15,620
and I've caught myself sitting there 
where you're watching now buddy.

2366
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:18,940
Ooh,
life is changing you up.

2367
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:19,880
Uh,
but I,

2368
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:20,713
I've been sit there where I'm looking,
I'm catching myself just watching the 

2369
01:38:22,081 --> 01:38:24,090
screen of course.
Big screen a lot and you're kind of,

2370
01:38:24,091 --> 01:38:25,530
you are aware of that or you're just 
like,

2371
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:28,020
I'm really not even watching this live.
Half the time,

2372
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:29,700
you know they start fighting over here 
and you're like,

2373
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:30,534
I have now the octagon is blocking man.
You don't get the commentary unless you 

2374
01:38:33,661 --> 01:38:35,490
have one of those ear piece things that 
they sell.

2375
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:37,500
So like sometimes something's going on 
and you're like,

2376
01:38:37,501 --> 01:38:38,670
what is happening?
Why is the doctor,

2377
01:38:38,671 --> 01:38:39,960
and they're like,
what's going on?

2378
01:38:39,961 --> 01:38:41,910
Why is he sitting on the stool?
Why is he on the ground?

2379
01:38:41,911 --> 01:38:42,744
Like what the fuck is going on?
And it'll take you like 10 minutes of 

2380
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:45,294
frustration to try to decipher.
And then like bruce buffer has to 

2381
01:38:48,121 --> 01:38:51,720
announce it due to an injury.
But speaking of that,

2382
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:54,540
you get to see the bruce buffer three 60
every time,

2383
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:57,380
which he doesn't do a three 60 it was a 
one 81,

2384
01:38:57,390 --> 01:39:01,890
three 60 and that's at UFC 200 which 
ladies and gentlemen begs the question,

2385
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:06,980
should we convince Bruce buffer to do 
something else?

2386
01:39:06,991 --> 01:39:07,824
Seven uh,
seven 20 do we convince them to do a 

2387
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:13,080
seven 20?
You heard it right here,

2388
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:15,660
but he's getting up there in age.
I don't want him to blow out an acl.

2389
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,650
He blew,
blew his acl out doing the jump.

2390
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:24,830
You know he does that thing where he 
like he blew his acl doing acl out doing

2391
01:39:26,431 --> 01:39:28,560
which in that which fight?
I don't remember.

2392
01:39:28,561 --> 01:39:32,480
He probably tell me if I asked him.
He he might not even my,

2393
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:33,333
I'm sure he remembers,
but here we could watch the three 60 by 

2394
01:39:35,251 --> 01:39:39,090
the way,
this three 60 is 100% my idea,

2395
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:40,253
I talked him into it.
There's any even a video of me talking 

2396
01:39:42,841 --> 01:39:43,674
him into the three 60 and I'm like,
cause he only did the one 80 and he did 

2397
01:39:46,951 --> 01:39:47,784
the wine 80 because he accidentally,
it was pointing towards the wrong side 

2398
01:39:51,181 --> 01:39:55,980
once and he realized that there's 
another one dude,

2399
01:39:57,660 --> 01:40:00,300
hold up,
bring this to the beginning,

2400
01:40:00,450 --> 01:40:03,630
bring it to the beginning and then crank
it up real loud so we can hear it.

2401
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:05,430
You'd do it.
Bring it from the beginning.

2402
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,550
Put it in the beginning.
Britain in the beginning.

2403
01:40:09,150 --> 01:40:12,990
There you go.
My main goal this weekend besides having

2404
01:40:12,991 --> 01:40:14,640
fun and getting to see some awesome 
fights.

2405
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:16,770
It's talking Bruce Buffer.

2406
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:22,030
It's the buffer three 63 60 we planted 
the seed in his head,

2407
01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:28,550
shit,
it was about a year ago.

2408
01:40:28,551 --> 01:40:32,870
Talked to him about possibly going from 
a one 82 or three 60 could he do it?

2409
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,890
But that crazy mother fucker went home 
and actually practiced it.

2410
01:40:36,190 --> 01:40:37,023
[inaudible] work on them at the 
[inaudible] for three 60 brought to you 

2411
01:40:51,021 --> 01:40:55,780
by the power of marijuana.
So this is the UFC.

2412
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:01,780
What proof?
UFC 100 today's that day,

2413
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:02,763
will we see the buffer?
Three is still stands that I will know 

2414
01:41:05,981 --> 01:41:08,710
at that exact millisecond of the moment 
I decided to do it.

2415
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:10,630
Do I want to do it?
Yes I do.

2416
01:41:10,631 --> 01:41:12,340
But let's see how the energy feels 
unless say,

2417
01:41:12,341 --> 01:41:14,590
oh,
I feel and let's see how the show goes.

2418
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:16,160
If I can do it,
I'll pull it off.

2419
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:17,183
Like fucking take it.
Joey Diaz is sitting there right behind 

2420
01:41:26,241 --> 01:41:28,940
me while it happened.
I forgot that until he was right there.

2421
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:36,073
Oh,
this is the biggest ever UFC pay per 

2422
01:41:41,141 --> 01:41:41,974
view.
And that's me with a video camera on 

2423
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:45,033
Mike Goldberg hoping that he's going to 
do the one 83 60 while look how lean 

2424
01:41:53,201 --> 01:41:58,201
frank Mir looked at the time.
We look great now get ready for this.

2425
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:23,800
Like he's going to do it.
He's going to do it.

2426
01:42:24,150 --> 01:42:25,330
I was like,
he's not going to do it.

2427
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:46,073
That's,

2428
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:03,300
I was so happy.
So there's Red Band Diaz and Ari fear.

2429
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:05,920
Wow.
Everybody looks so young.

2430
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:07,720
Wow.
It's crazy.

2431
01:43:07,721 --> 01:43:10,600
That was seven years ago.
That doesn't seem like seven years ago.

2432
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:11,583
Somehow already had an older haircut at 
the time while he was gone for the 

2433
01:43:14,291 --> 01:43:15,124
mustache.
Look at the time and he had a lot of 

2434
01:43:16,601 --> 01:43:18,730
craziness going on.
Wow.

2435
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:21,670
That's a long ass time ago.
That's crazy.

2436
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,310
Who?
Who is it?

2437
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,810
Who has that up?
Does that red bands page?

2438
01:43:29,710 --> 01:43:30,790
Wow.
I should put it on my channel.

2439
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:35,970
So we have to figure out a way to make a
seven 20 plausible to spend.

2440
01:43:37,541 --> 01:43:38,374
He needs a hover board or something.
So the other breaking news you just 

2441
01:43:41,561 --> 01:43:43,720
handed me,
is it Kimbo slice died,

2442
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:46,353
died.
I think he was admitted to the hospital 

2443
01:43:48,341 --> 01:43:52,280
with a heart condition today or maybe 
Thursday the other day.

2444
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,113
And News is breaking just as we were 
coming on when people are trying to get 

2445
01:43:55,221 --> 01:43:59,080
confirmation on that,
if he actually passed and tweeted it,

2446
01:43:59,410 --> 01:44:02,200
oh the American top team tweeted that he
died.

2447
01:44:02,201 --> 01:44:04,480
He must have really died.
Wow.

2448
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:07,000
He was a good guy,
man.

2449
01:44:07,090 --> 01:44:09,250
I met that dude a couple of times.
Very nice guy.

2450
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:13,210
Fuck man.
Crazy story.

2451
01:44:13,211 --> 01:44:16,630
He had man just fuck Internet street 
fights into the UFC.

2452
01:44:16,890 --> 01:44:19,870
Well first into the CBS thing.
It was a good boxer.

2453
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:22,130
You know,
he's a good boxer in the early days of a

2454
01:44:22,190 --> 01:44:23,800
mma,
you know,

2455
01:44:24,040 --> 01:44:27,650
he go back and watch like Kimbo slice 
Kayo and lead x c just to lead,

2456
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:28,553
see fucked up and trying to put all 
their eggs in one basket and have this 

2457
01:44:31,721 --> 01:44:35,200
guy who was this internet sensation be 
their figurehead.

2458
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:40,320
I mean it made sense like financially,
but the people in the know like me,

2459
01:44:40,810 --> 01:44:41,740
I was like,
listen,

2460
01:44:41,741 --> 01:44:43,990
if he fights someone good,
he's going to get fucked up.

2461
01:44:43,991 --> 01:44:46,600
Like I see all these holes in what he 
does.

2462
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:50,680
And it was frustrating as a hardcore fan
because it was still at a point like the

2463
01:44:50,681 --> 01:44:52,450
UFC is much,
much bigger now.

2464
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:54,850
I remember when they got that fight on 
uh,

2465
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:58,660
on CBS,
like mma had never been on a big network

2466
01:44:58,661 --> 01:44:59,494
like that before.
So it was very frustrating that the 

2467
01:45:01,601 --> 01:45:05,440
biggest network was putting it out as if
this guy was the best guy in mma.

2468
01:45:05,441 --> 01:45:06,274
And you know,
us like hardcore fans like me and my 

2469
01:45:07,961 --> 01:45:08,794
friends would be around bitching.
Like Randy Guitar would take them down 

2470
01:45:10,091 --> 01:45:13,630
in a second.
But he was fun to watch.

2471
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:17,200
Well people forget that elite Xc sorta 
had the scoop on the UFC.

2472
01:45:17,470 --> 01:45:18,303
They had the scoop on getting on 
broadcast television and they had 

2473
01:45:20,861 --> 01:45:23,170
millions of people watching those 
fights.

2474
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:26,140
Didn't UFC like why aren't they in talks
with HBO?

2475
01:45:26,170 --> 01:45:27,003
And then it like fell apart and then 
elite xc ended up getting the deal with 

2476
01:45:29,621 --> 01:45:30,454
showtime or whatever was one of the 
problems hbo wanted to replace me and 

2477
01:45:35,111 --> 01:45:37,660
Goldberg and put in their own 
commentators.

2478
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:42,160
They wanted to do their own version of 
the broadcast because they probably felt

2479
01:45:42,161 --> 01:45:45,610
like us as you have seen,
employees would be biased.

2480
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:49,120
And the UFC was like,
that's not gonna happen.

2481
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:50,410
Like first of all,
who are you going to get?

2482
01:45:50,500 --> 01:45:51,333
Like how many people are out there?
Especially at the time that even do 

2483
01:45:53,861 --> 01:45:56,590
commentary.
This is a small handful of people in the

2484
01:45:56,591 --> 01:46:00,760
world that are qualified to do mma 
commentary at a top level.

2485
01:46:00,790 --> 01:46:02,510
It was a big problem.
Big,

2486
01:46:02,620 --> 01:46:03,453
big problem with other organizations.
We've been made them almost unwatchable 

2487
01:46:05,711 --> 01:46:07,930
because the announcing would just be so 
terrible.

2488
01:46:08,050 --> 01:46:08,883
I mean like nowadays I feel like there 
was a while where I thought you and 

2489
01:46:10,841 --> 01:46:11,674
Goldberg,
we're like the only team who can do mma 

2490
01:46:13,391 --> 01:46:15,520
without me just wanting to mute it.
Um,

2491
01:46:15,550 --> 01:46:16,383
but I actually like now they've got the 
alternate teams have gotten fairly 

2492
01:46:18,491 --> 01:46:19,000
strong.

2493
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,820
Like Brian stands.
Really good price hands.

2494
01:46:20,830 --> 01:46:21,521
Excellent.
Dan.

2495
01:46:21,521 --> 01:46:22,960
Hardee's excellent and hard.
He's really good.

2496
01:46:22,961 --> 01:46:23,794
Yeah,
there's a lot of people that can do my 

2497
01:46:24,521 --> 01:46:28,000
job now.
But back then there was a small handful.

2498
01:46:28,001 --> 01:46:28,581
And by the way,
the,

2499
01:46:28,581 --> 01:46:29,850
the,
a lot of people that can do my,

2500
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:32,170
other than Jimmy Smith who's really 
good,

2501
01:46:32,530 --> 01:46:33,161
who,
uh,

2502
01:46:33,161 --> 01:46:35,680
works for Beltour,
Jimmy Smits excellent.

2503
01:46:35,681 --> 01:46:37,090
He's,
he's as good as me.

2504
01:46:37,091 --> 01:46:38,830
Easy.
He's as good as anybody.

2505
01:46:38,831 --> 01:46:39,431
He's,
he's,

2506
01:46:39,431 --> 01:46:41,290
he's fantastic.
He knows his shit.

2507
01:46:41,530 --> 01:46:43,480
He's a real fan.
He's a smart guy.

2508
01:46:43,481 --> 01:46:44,970
He's,
he's easy to listen to.

2509
01:46:44,971 --> 01:46:46,000
He calls things.
Right.

2510
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:48,580
I'm a big Jimmy Smith Fan.
But um,

2511
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:51,990
other than outside of the UFC,
who do you got outside?

2512
01:46:51,991 --> 01:46:52,824
The UFC does not,
not really much unless there's some 

2513
01:46:54,211 --> 01:46:56,610
unknown gods I don't know of,
which is definitely possible.

2514
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,860
But there's,
in the UFC,

2515
01:46:58,861 --> 01:47:00,330
there's several guys now,
you know,

2516
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:02,310
you got Kenny Florian,
you got Brian Stand,

2517
01:47:02,311 --> 01:47:04,830
you've got Dan Hardee,
there's plenty of people can do it now,

2518
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:06,870
but they worked for the UFC.

2519
01:47:06,870 --> 01:47:09,390
So someone like hbo wanted to have their
own team.

2520
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:10,703
You can't just get sports guys.
You just can't do that because they're 

2521
01:47:13,081 --> 01:47:13,914
not going to understand what the fuck's 
going on when the fight goes to the 

2522
01:47:15,001 --> 01:47:17,460
ground and they're going to miss things.
And it's going to be sloppy.

2523
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:18,953
You can't have that.
You'd have to have someone who 

2524
01:47:19,771 --> 01:47:21,590
understands and you have to have someone
who can talk.

2525
01:47:21,610 --> 01:47:22,443
Like when you watch old school a mma,
it's one of the craziest things about 

2526
01:47:25,031 --> 01:47:28,110
better that it's being announced by 
people who don't understand the sport.

2527
01:47:28,111 --> 01:47:29,910
So you literally hear them saying things
like,

2528
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:31,590
why is he typing?
Yeah.

2529
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:32,581
Yeah,
you get,

2530
01:47:32,581 --> 01:47:34,660
you definitely get a lot of that.
And we'll usually get a lot of that from

2531
01:47:34,661 --> 01:47:36,510
a judges,
which is really crazy.

2532
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:37,613
I have a friend of mine is a friend of 
mine who's a judge and in the middle of 

2533
01:47:40,271 --> 01:47:41,220
a fight,
this woman,

2534
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:42,113
uh,
who was also a judge looked over them 

2535
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:44,401
and go,
she goes,

2536
01:47:44,401 --> 01:47:47,730
what is he doing that someone had 
someone in a Kamora and she's like,

2537
01:47:47,731 --> 01:47:48,300
what is he doing?

2538
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:49,133
What's going on over there?
Like she's a professional judge at the 

2539
01:47:51,451 --> 01:47:53,330
highest level in the UFC.
And she had no,

2540
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:55,860
and this was four years ago,
five years ago.

2541
01:47:56,610 --> 01:47:58,050
So yeah,
but this is what I'm against.

2542
01:47:58,051 --> 01:47:59,820
All those commissions.
Well,

2543
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:03,300
yes and no.
You definitely need commissions cause if

2544
01:48:03,301 --> 01:48:05,760
you don't have commissions and you don't
have medical staff on team,

2545
01:48:05,970 --> 01:48:08,800
you don't have like strict standards as 
far as you know,

2546
01:48:08,810 --> 01:48:09,643
you have to have some government it 
especially with something like combat 

2547
01:48:12,151 --> 01:48:14,640
sports because there's too many fly by 
the seat of your pants.

2548
01:48:14,641 --> 01:48:16,650
Organizations that don't do medical 
screenings,

2549
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:18,760
people could die.
I mean they test.

2550
01:48:18,860 --> 01:48:21,660
You have to have like uh,
certainly the companies would have to be

2551
01:48:21,661 --> 01:48:23,670
held responsible for that stuff.
Yeah.

2552
01:48:23,671 --> 01:48:25,610
But you can't just leave it up to the 
companies.

2553
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:26,453
We can,
the athletes that suffer if there's no 

2554
01:48:27,331 --> 01:48:28,860
medical coverage,
the right there,

2555
01:48:28,861 --> 01:48:29,694
you can't have an event like an mma 
event where you putting your literally 

2556
01:48:32,911 --> 01:48:33,744
your health and your life in the hands 
of these people that are supposed to 

2557
01:48:36,481 --> 01:48:37,314
have all their ducks in a row so they 
can run this event and measure whether 

2558
01:48:41,101 --> 01:48:43,560
or not you even get paid is in question 
Si.

2559
01:48:43,770 --> 01:48:46,470
Because these guys don't have any power.
The fighters,

2560
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:47,270
you know,
there's,

2561
01:48:47,270 --> 01:48:48,240
there's,
they don't have enough influence,

2562
01:48:48,241 --> 01:48:51,150
especially on a small local level,
small shows.

2563
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:54,870
So I'm a big fan of how California does 
it.

2564
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:56,730
Like I said,
I'm a big fan of that Andy Foster guy.

2565
01:48:56,731 --> 01:48:57,610
I think he's,
he's fucking,

2566
01:48:57,710 --> 01:49:00,720
he's as good as it gets when it comes to
heads of athletic commissions.

2567
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:01,583
But I think that you have to have a bond
where you have the money to pay the 

2568
01:49:05,431 --> 01:49:06,264
fighters before he can put on an event.
And that should be mandatory because 

2569
01:49:08,641 --> 01:49:09,750
you've done,
have you ever done shows?

2570
01:49:09,751 --> 01:49:10,860
We haven't gotten paid.
Yeah,

2571
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:12,990
I have.
It's fucking horrible,

2572
01:49:12,991 --> 01:49:13,351
man.
It's,

2573
01:49:13,351 --> 01:49:16,320
that's not frustrating.
Especially when you know that you,

2574
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:18,930
there was an audience there and they 
laughed.

2575
01:49:18,931 --> 01:49:20,550
So Pete,
there's money exchanged,

2576
01:49:20,551 --> 01:49:21,740
but where's my money?
Oh please.

2577
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:22,583
You don't have it.
You don't even have a show if you don't 

2578
01:49:23,941 --> 01:49:24,720
have the show.

2579
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:25,553
Part of the show I had,
I had one where I had to fly myself out 

2580
01:49:27,181 --> 01:49:28,014
to it.
I didn't get paid and like there were 

2581
01:49:28,681 --> 01:49:30,240
people there.
The club was the ohs.

2582
01:49:30,330 --> 01:49:31,440
Brutal.
It was brutal.

2583
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:32,730
Did you ever get paid?
No.

2584
01:49:32,790 --> 01:49:33,391
Never.
Never.

2585
01:49:33,391 --> 01:49:35,820
To this day there's a Gig Mianna man.
Big J.

2586
01:49:35,850 --> 01:49:36,550
No,
some.

2587
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:38,430
We're both on the GIG together.
Both of us didn't get paid.

2588
01:49:38,431 --> 01:49:39,990
I was opening for him.
This is years ago.

2589
01:49:40,690 --> 01:49:41,523
I both like I was opening for him,
but believe me it probably hurt me more 

2590
01:49:44,221 --> 01:49:45,054
of the money.
Uh,

2591
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:45,893
I mean,
uh,

2592
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:47,213
made it on money,
but at the moment I was like fucking 

2593
01:49:48,611 --> 01:49:50,120
broke.
Um,

2594
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:51,573
but I will say then you also deal with a
lot of other shit when you get these 

2595
01:49:53,711 --> 01:49:56,860
government regulatory bodies like with 
the Vegas.

2596
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:58,650
Was it the Vegas Commission that had 
Nick Diaz?

2597
01:49:58,670 --> 01:50:00,910
Of course,
which I mean has there ever,

2598
01:50:01,270 --> 01:50:02,103
if you,
the guy moved up a weight class and 

2599
01:50:05,111 --> 01:50:05,944
thought the greatest of all time at that
weight class who tested positive for 

2600
01:50:09,881 --> 01:50:10,714
steroids and they found that he was,
had trace amounts of thc in the system 

2601
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:18,850
and he passed a couple of tests,
right?

2602
01:50:18,910 --> 01:50:21,670
He pass the most stringent tests 
available.

2603
01:50:21,671 --> 01:50:25,690
You pass to Wada test to world 
anti-doping agency tests.

2604
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:26,853
There were blood tests,
there are much more particular and then 

2605
01:50:29,621 --> 01:50:33,340
he failed a urine test that the Nevada 
state athletic commission.

2606
01:50:33,640 --> 01:50:37,630
But he says it's bullshit and like the 
Wata people say it's bullshit.

2607
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:38,500
The water.
People were like,

2608
01:50:38,501 --> 01:50:42,010
look like there's no fee.
And then they wouldn't test sample b.

2609
01:50:42,250 --> 01:50:43,083
There was like some,
some issues with testing of sample B or 

2610
01:50:45,641 --> 01:50:48,250
allowing the tests of sample b and they 
banned,

2611
01:50:48,251 --> 01:50:49,084
they tried to ban him for five years.
I gave out the Nevada state athletic 

2612
01:50:50,981 --> 01:50:51,880
commission,
his phone number,

2613
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:54,040
I put it on twitter,
it's on everybody calm.

2614
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:56,380
They were fucking best there are pissed 
off.

2615
01:50:56,381 --> 01:50:57,730
I was like,
fuck you.

2616
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,920
What would they were like petitions 
online and stuff like that.

2617
01:50:59,921 --> 01:51:02,930
People would be fired and then they 
should be locked in jail.

2618
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:03,833
Yeah,
the amount of incompetence and you have 

2619
01:51:05,351 --> 01:51:06,184
to have to think that you're going to 
take away a guy's athletic career for 

2620
01:51:08,321 --> 01:51:09,154
trace amounts of marijuana and the 
system and not examine the to Wada test 

2621
01:51:13,571 --> 01:51:15,160
that showed that he was clean.
Oh,

2622
01:51:15,161 --> 01:51:17,380
it's just so disgusting.
And this guy,

2623
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:18,600
this guy who,
you know,

2624
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:21,850
Nick Diaz was like,
came from nothing and like made a career

2625
01:51:21,851 --> 01:51:22,090
of it.
Was,

2626
01:51:22,090 --> 01:51:23,920
was like doing something positive with 
his life.

2627
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:25,930
Ruined him.
It's just pot.

2628
01:51:26,020 --> 01:51:27,670
He fought a guy on steroids.
Yes,

2629
01:51:27,730 --> 01:51:28,563
exactly.
And it's just the greatest ever on 

2630
01:51:30,761 --> 01:51:31,780
roids.
Yeah,

2631
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:33,130
you should just,
you should,

2632
01:51:33,190 --> 01:51:34,023
you should say,
I'm so sorry that we let a guy on 

2633
01:51:36,311 --> 01:51:38,680
steroids fight against you.
Here's some more pot.

2634
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:40,090
Exactly.
He's don't sue us.

2635
01:51:40,810 --> 01:51:42,730
Exactly.
I mean,

2636
01:51:42,820 --> 01:51:43,653
the idea that you can just go in there 
and run an organization like that and 

2637
01:51:49,361 --> 01:51:53,410
tell those people that are fighting that
their futures fuck like what they did to

2638
01:51:53,411 --> 01:51:55,540
vandelay Silva is arguably even more 
disgusting.

2639
01:51:56,230 --> 01:51:58,360
Vandelay Silva ran away from a drug 
test.

2640
01:51:58,420 --> 01:52:00,310
Okay.
Not Good.

2641
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:02,740
Definitely shouldn't do that.
But they banned him for life.

2642
01:52:03,190 --> 01:52:04,780
He's never tested positive.
Ever.

2643
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:07,540
Ever abandoned for life gets,
it's insane.

2644
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:10,210
That's beyond fuck debts.
Tyranny.

2645
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,051
Well,
it's this guy,

2646
01:52:11,051 --> 01:52:11,920
uh,
this the guy,

2647
01:52:11,921 --> 01:52:14,390
the cops killed in Baltimore,
that Guy Freddie Gray.

2648
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:17,980
Like essentially what he did was he ran,
they didn't have anything on him.

2649
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:21,370
They weren't there to arrest him.
He saw cops and ran.

2650
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:23,950
And it's like a weird dynamic where 
you're like running,

2651
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:27,400
it may be a little suspicious,
but it's not itself a crime.

2652
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:28,263
Right,
right.

2653
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:31,000
Like how can there be such a hard 
punishment for running?

2654
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:32,860
Yeah.
You're just,

2655
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:36,040
I mean it just seems strange,
which was a woman.

2656
01:52:36,041 --> 01:52:38,830
The Guy ran away and they shot him then 
through a Taser on the ground.

2657
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:40,900
That was no different line.
That was in North Carolina.

2658
01:52:40,901 --> 01:52:42,500
And I think there was a little bit more 
maybe,

2659
01:52:42,570 --> 01:52:44,740
maybe you're right.
Maybe it was one of those,

2660
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:46,660
I was wanting to go to South Carolina

2661
01:52:46,710 --> 01:52:49,340
because I'm from the north,
we to say,

2662
01:52:49,341 --> 01:52:51,770
oh South Carolina ones that are all 
fucked up.

2663
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:53,540
The North Carolina,
North Carolina would never,

2664
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:54,990
never,
but then it,

2665
01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:56,083
it did turn out that he was like,
he had the cops Taser or something like 

2666
01:52:58,341 --> 01:52:58,911
that.
Right.

2667
01:52:58,911 --> 01:52:59,744
And that and that one,
all the cop through the Taser on the 

2668
01:53:00,831 --> 01:53:02,200
ground.
Is that what it was?

2669
01:53:02,201 --> 01:53:03,034
I don't remember the story exactly.
There's a video of the cop chucking the 

2670
01:53:05,481 --> 01:53:07,730
Taser on the ground after he shot him.
Like,

2671
01:53:07,770 --> 01:53:09,770
cause if set up caught him,
he had a weapon,

2672
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:10,940
you know?
Yeah.

2673
01:53:10,941 --> 01:53:12,980
Like what,
a lot of shady shit.

2674
01:53:13,040 --> 01:53:16,220
There's something about that balance too
of where like if you,

2675
01:53:16,490 --> 01:53:19,340
if a cop is,
it is,

2676
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:20,203
you know,
if a cop grabs your arm and you yank it 

2677
01:53:21,561 --> 01:53:22,520
away,
so you're like,

2678
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:24,670
assault resisting arrest Jerry,
you're,

2679
01:53:24,710 --> 01:53:28,760
you're fucked now.
But the cops can like beat a dude with a

2680
01:53:28,761 --> 01:53:30,830
nightstick half to death and then 
they're like,

2681
01:53:30,831 --> 01:53:31,664
well,
we thought he might've been going for 

2682
01:53:32,391 --> 01:53:33,010
someone's gun.

2683
01:53:33,010 --> 01:53:34,130
Yeah,
yeah.

2684
01:53:34,131 --> 01:53:35,310
It's dark man.
It's,

2685
01:53:35,311 --> 01:53:36,144
it's,
and also cops just like everything else 

2686
01:53:37,551 --> 01:53:40,370
we're talking about in government,
they're people and they vary and there's

2687
01:53:40,371 --> 01:53:41,810
going to be people that are awesome 
cops.

2688
01:53:42,180 --> 01:53:45,440
And I personally think that it's one of 
the most difficult jobs a person can do.

2689
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:46,333
And psychologically the,
the idea of going to work every day 

2690
01:53:49,191 --> 01:53:50,024
where all the people you deal with are 
going to be lying to you and up to 

2691
01:53:52,431 --> 01:53:54,530
something and hate you.
Well,

2692
01:53:54,531 --> 01:53:55,940
did you,
did you follow it all?

2693
01:53:55,941 --> 01:53:56,780
What happened?
Um,

2694
01:53:56,900 --> 01:53:58,690
was like a,
I guess a year and a half ago now in,

2695
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:03,320
in New York where the NYP D had like a,
essentially a quasi shutdown.

2696
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:04,450
Yes.
I mean it's,

2697
01:54:04,451 --> 01:54:05,284
it's,
and I think what you're saying is 

2698
01:54:06,291 --> 01:54:07,011
absolutely true.
I mean,

2699
01:54:07,011 --> 01:54:08,600
I think it's an incredibly difficult 
job.

2700
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:09,463
And,
and a lot of that is because of the 

2701
01:54:10,311 --> 01:54:12,320
rules we have,
which are kind of crazy.

2702
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:16,100
I mean,
the idea of having to police drug use.

2703
01:54:16,470 --> 01:54:17,303
Yeah.
It's a very difficult position to put 

2704
01:54:18,681 --> 01:54:20,410
someone in because the,
I mean,

2705
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:21,253
obviously first and foremost,
it's a horrible thing to do to throw 

2706
01:54:23,271 --> 01:54:25,430
someone in a cage for putting something 
into their body.

2707
01:54:25,730 --> 01:54:27,980
But it's a very weird thing when there's
no complaintant.

2708
01:54:28,190 --> 01:54:31,490
It's two people who are making a 
voluntary transaction and now you got to

2709
01:54:31,491 --> 01:54:32,324
go in like Swat raid and find them at,
this guy's giving a bag of something to 

2710
01:54:35,391 --> 01:54:36,740
another person.
Go get them.

2711
01:54:36,741 --> 01:54:38,510
But,
so for people who don't know,

2712
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:41,270
there was after that,
Eric Gardner Guy,

2713
01:54:41,271 --> 01:54:44,610
uh,
got choked out and choked to death in a,

2714
01:54:45,130 --> 01:54:46,370
I don't know how you'd put it,
but he got,

2715
01:54:46,371 --> 01:54:47,330
he got choked to death.
I'm sorry,

2716
01:54:47,331 --> 01:54:48,680
I shouldn't say that.
We had like a heart attack.

2717
01:54:48,920 --> 01:54:50,750
He had a heart attack while getting 
tackled down.

2718
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,380
A legendary selling loosies loose 
cigarettes.

2719
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:55,460
Uh,
nothing.

2720
01:54:55,550 --> 01:54:58,980
So there were a bunch of protests and 
then a couple,

2721
01:54:59,040 --> 01:55:01,430
uh,
two cops got shot in Brooklyn,

2722
01:55:01,830 --> 01:55:02,900
uh,
by some maniac.

2723
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:03,773
Yeah,
I think it was [inaudible] and he drove 

2724
01:55:05,121 --> 01:55:05,954
up,
he tweeted he was going to do it and 

2725
01:55:07,011 --> 01:55:09,440
then drove up and shot two cops who 
never saw it coming.

2726
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:12,400
It's poor guys got killed on the job.
Um,

2727
01:55:12,500 --> 01:55:13,333
and then as a result of that,
they had like an official unofficial 

2728
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:22,430
what they called an Nyp d slow down.
And I'm one of the,

2729
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:25,160
it was a spokesman for the police union,
he said,

2730
01:55:25,161 --> 01:55:27,410
and I believe it was the New York Post,
he said,

2731
01:55:27,850 --> 01:55:29,300
uh,
as a result of the shooting,

2732
01:55:29,330 --> 01:55:32,660
the cops will only be making arrests 
when absolutely necessary.

2733
01:55:33,350 --> 01:55:34,370
Well,
that's what he said,

2734
01:55:34,371 --> 01:55:35,204
which was weird.
Like shouldn't they always be doing 

2735
01:55:36,711 --> 01:55:38,240
that?
But anyway,

2736
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:40,100
so they,
but uh,

2737
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:42,920
arrest went down like 80%,
uh,

2738
01:55:43,110 --> 01:55:46,380
or at least it was maybe like 60% and 66
cents we have here.

2739
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:49,860
And then it was like nonviolent tickets 
and bullshit arrest.

2740
01:55:49,950 --> 01:55:50,783
We're down like 90%.
Like they were just basically not doing 

2741
01:55:52,801 --> 01:55:53,634
that anymore.
And there was this beautiful like month 

2742
01:55:55,141 --> 01:56:00,141
and a half long period where the NYP d 
just wasn't doing what they do.

2743
01:56:01,201 --> 01:56:02,034
They weren't over policing everybody and
then they started cracking the whip to 

2744
01:56:04,981 --> 01:56:05,814
get them to go back to do it because 
evidently a lot of money is raised by 

2745
01:56:08,581 --> 01:56:09,560
these,
you know,

2746
01:56:09,561 --> 01:56:12,270
that's the issue.
Glorified revenue collectors.

2747
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:13,373
There's a lot of revenue that gets 
gathered up in kind of fucking devious 

2748
01:56:16,351 --> 01:56:17,184
ways.
Like I've always been disgusted by 

2749
01:56:19,111 --> 01:56:19,944
parking tickets.
Like why the city owns the fucking spot 

2750
01:56:24,931 --> 01:56:25,764
where you can leave a car and you have 
to give them money to leave a car and 

2751
01:56:29,071 --> 01:56:32,070
that's how they gather up millions of 
dollars and they become addicted to that

2752
01:56:32,071 --> 01:56:33,750
gathering of the millions of dollars.
Right.

2753
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:34,950
That's fucking crazy.

2754
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:36,270
You can't do that,
man.

2755
01:56:36,271 --> 01:56:37,140
You can't.
You can't.

2756
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:39,070
Oh,
it's a horrible way to fund a system.

2757
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:40,501
Imagine,
by the way,

2758
01:56:40,501 --> 01:56:43,020
just being that guy,
you just being the guy who's going out,

2759
01:56:43,021 --> 01:56:45,570
just giving tickets.
Like you just go around ruining people's

2760
01:56:45,571 --> 01:56:47,510
Day,
like all day long line.

2761
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:48,533
My friend Brian used to do that.
That must be a fucking weird bad for 

2762
01:56:51,301 --> 01:56:53,160
your brain.
I'd imagine it has to be.

2763
01:56:53,370 --> 01:56:54,420
I mean,
I imagine some of these people,

2764
01:56:54,421 --> 01:56:55,680
men who are like literally,
you know,

2765
01:56:55,681 --> 01:56:57,000
working,
uh,

2766
01:56:57,030 --> 01:56:57,863
like you know,
lower class jobs and have families to 

2767
01:57:00,631 --> 01:57:01,464
pay for and you're just going to go hand
them a fucking hundred dollar ticket 

2768
01:57:05,461 --> 01:57:08,280
because the meter expired by two 
minutes.

2769
01:57:08,281 --> 01:57:09,114
He didn't give us enough money and it's 
just changing as laundry or something 

2770
01:57:11,641 --> 01:57:13,800
and you know,
let it go for a few minutes.

2771
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:16,090
Yeah,
I mean I get the idea that you,

2772
01:57:16,091 --> 01:57:18,480
you shouldn't have cars that are 
blocking the street.

2773
01:57:18,510 --> 01:57:19,343
You should definitely give people 
tickets if they're doing something that 

2774
01:57:20,851 --> 01:57:24,510
has trucks at or tow them.
But to just leave a car on the street,

2775
01:57:24,511 --> 01:57:25,980
you have to pay money.
Yeah.

2776
01:57:26,530 --> 01:57:27,061
I mean,
look,

2777
01:57:27,061 --> 01:57:28,830
I have,
I have a problem with the way government

2778
01:57:28,831 --> 01:57:31,070
raises almost all revenue.
I mean I just,

2779
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:32,033
I reject the whole system of,
of like taxation at the threat of 

2780
01:57:36,121 --> 01:57:36,954
violence.
I think it's like primitive and 

2781
01:57:37,771 --> 01:57:38,970
barbaric.
And when,

2782
01:57:38,971 --> 01:57:42,120
when human beings look back on that it's
going to be the way we look back at like

2783
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:46,770
slavery or arranged marriage or whatever
it is that the idea that the way we fund

2784
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:48,840
our organization,
you know,

2785
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:49,713
like,
like let's say there are these services 

2786
01:57:50,671 --> 01:57:53,400
that are necessary.
So the way we fund that as we go,

2787
01:57:53,570 --> 01:57:55,200
uh,
you have to pay a portion of your income

2788
01:57:55,230 --> 01:57:56,820
or we'll fucking throw you in jail.

2789
01:57:57,030 --> 01:57:58,650
Yeah,
we'll put you in a cage,

2790
01:57:58,710 --> 01:58:01,410
block you in a cage like an animal.
They're just like,

2791
01:58:01,470 --> 01:58:02,590
that's the biggest thing.
Um,

2792
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:03,593
when I'm arguing that with people about 
like libertarianism versus other ways 

2793
01:58:06,631 --> 01:58:09,210
that we should organize society as my 
biggest thing that I just,

2794
01:58:09,211 --> 01:58:11,340
I,
I harp on is just a like,

2795
01:58:11,341 --> 01:58:13,590
okay,
who should we throw in a cage?

2796
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:17,510
Who was it morally acceptable to throw 
into a cage forcefully?

2797
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:20,280
Like send men with guns to get them and 
throw them into a cage.

2798
01:58:20,281 --> 01:58:23,310
Like I'll grant you a murderer,
a rapist,

2799
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:25,500
someone who assault somebody.
Okay.

2800
01:58:25,530 --> 01:58:27,610
Yeah.
Maybe we go into like theft,

2801
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:30,360
things like that.
Cause cause that is a violation of,

2802
01:58:30,361 --> 01:58:32,360
you know,
you own yourself and then you own your,

2803
01:58:32,361 --> 01:58:34,170
your possession.
So that's a violation.

2804
01:58:34,171 --> 01:58:37,260
But are you,
are you really okay if someone's like,

2805
01:58:37,380 --> 01:58:39,150
oh I don't want to fund that program.

2806
01:58:39,810 --> 01:58:40,643
I won't like I won't my money and to 
fund the war cause I don't believe in 

2807
01:58:43,361 --> 01:58:45,370
the war.
So now we can throw that guy in a cage.

2808
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:46,241
Yeah.
Or I don't want to,

2809
01:58:46,241 --> 01:58:47,190
I don't want to fund them.
Look,

2810
01:58:47,230 --> 01:58:48,063
even if you have a really noble charity,
why should you be able to threaten 

2811
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:53,740
violence against someone to get them to 
fund it?

2812
01:58:53,770 --> 01:58:55,150
Well,
that's where I like Gary Johnson,

2813
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:58,000
Gary Johnson steps in and says we don't 
need the irs.

2814
01:58:58,360 --> 01:58:59,410
It's like,
let's listen.

2815
01:58:59,650 --> 01:59:02,320
We don't need,
that's not how we have to make money,

2816
01:59:02,321 --> 01:59:04,620
which put taxes on consumption.
I,

2817
01:59:04,740 --> 01:59:05,573
I like Gary Johnson.
I wish he would be a little more Ron 

2818
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:09,260
Paul.
But uh,

2819
01:59:09,260 --> 01:59:10,093
he's away.
I just feel like Gary Johnson has this 

2820
01:59:13,031 --> 01:59:18,031
way of selling the libertarianism as 
this kind of like,

2821
01:59:19,390 --> 01:59:20,290
well,
you know,

2822
01:59:20,291 --> 01:59:23,380
it's more practical if we do it the 
libertarian way.

2823
01:59:23,600 --> 01:59:24,040
Huh.

2824
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:26,830
Whereas I like when he's asked about the
wars,

2825
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:29,800
he'll say,
he'll say things like,

2826
01:59:29,801 --> 01:59:30,640
um,
he goes,

2827
01:59:30,641 --> 01:59:31,474
well,
I think if you look on average these 

2828
01:59:33,251 --> 01:59:36,310
military interventions of hurt more than
they have helped.

2829
01:59:36,820 --> 01:59:39,410
That is exactly how we sound.
That's a really good impression.

2830
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:40,900
Yeah,
I watched a lot of them.

2831
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:42,113
Well,
so my only,

2832
01:59:42,130 --> 01:59:44,290
by the way,
that's not necessarily incorrect.

2833
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:45,333
It's just like who,
who would talk about mass murder that 

2834
01:59:48,461 --> 01:59:49,294
way and it's like,
it's like talking about slavery and 

2835
01:59:51,671 --> 01:59:52,081
you're like,
well,

2836
01:59:52,081 --> 01:59:52,914
I just think overall this is an 
inefficient way to get cotton Jesus 

2837
01:59:58,031 --> 01:59:58,900
dude.
Like and your,

2838
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:00,393
your head abolitionist really,
you're supposed to represent the 

2839
02:00:02,861 --> 02:00:04,400
abolitionist movement,
right?

2840
02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:06,580
With that,
that attitude.

2841
02:00:06,700 --> 02:00:09,640
So he's like a moderate radical.
Yeah,

2842
02:00:09,641 --> 02:00:11,950
he's just a pragmatist man.
He's just like this.

2843
02:00:11,951 --> 02:00:14,140
This makes more sense,
which is just fine.

2844
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:15,610
But I don't really want to sell.

2845
02:00:15,610 --> 02:00:16,443
Libertarianism is like,
I think we're fiscally conservative and 

2846
02:00:19,481 --> 02:00:21,730
socially liberal.
He's like a,

2847
02:00:21,790 --> 02:00:24,700
he's a bridge because he was a lifelong 
Republican.

2848
02:00:24,760 --> 02:00:25,593
Like he's a good bridge to getting 
people to consider an alternative party 

2849
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:31,510
and maybe one of the only ones it's 
currently available.

2850
02:00:31,570 --> 02:00:34,990
See I believe in a little bit more like 
a case for radicalism.

2851
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:36,310
I think that,
um,

2852
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:41,020
so Ron Paul,
when he was in the 2007,

2853
02:00:41,021 --> 02:00:44,530
2008 debates,
she got a whole lot of people interested

2854
02:00:44,531 --> 02:00:47,740
in libertarianism and he didn't do it by
being like a bridge to like,

2855
02:00:47,890 --> 02:00:49,750
before I tell you,
you know,

2856
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:50,643
slavery is horribly immoral.
Let me first convince you it's 

2857
02:00:52,661 --> 02:00:55,420
inefficient and ineffective.
And then he went right to like,

2858
02:00:55,660 --> 02:00:57,190
this is wrong,
this is wrong.

2859
02:00:57,191 --> 02:00:59,230
We're killing people in countries around
the world.

2860
02:00:59,231 --> 02:01:00,064
Like this is morally horrible.
And he got a movement going when he was 

2861
02:01:02,741 --> 02:01:03,550
in those debates.

2862
02:01:03,550 --> 02:01:04,383
You know,
Gary Johnson was in one of the major 

2863
02:01:05,201 --> 02:01:06,034
debates in 2012.
Do you remember anything from his 

2864
02:01:08,771 --> 02:01:10,840
performance because nobody ever does?
No.

2865
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:13,840
Nobody ever does because he'll go in 
there and say things like,

2866
02:01:14,140 --> 02:01:14,973
in New Mexico,
I was able to balance the budget was 

2867
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:19,270
earning 7% and you're like,
ah,

2868
02:01:20,050 --> 02:01:20,883
you have the greatest,
the greatest political philosophy ever 

2869
02:01:23,381 --> 02:01:27,700
devised by man behind you libertarians.
You have the answer to all this shit.

2870
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:30,220
You're the abolitionists in slavery 
times.

2871
02:01:30,730 --> 02:01:34,870
And so you really feel libertarianism is
the answer to everything?

2872
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:35,941
Well,
no,

2873
02:01:35,941 --> 02:01:36,774
no,
no.

2874
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:37,653
It's not in the same way that abolition 
isn't the answer to everything during 

2875
02:01:40,431 --> 02:01:45,170
slavery.
It's the first moral step to then we can

2876
02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:46,423
live in.
What about libertarianism is so 

2877
02:01:47,721 --> 02:01:49,520
attractive to you?
Uh,

2878
02:01:49,521 --> 02:01:50,270
I mean,
I just,

2879
02:01:50,270 --> 02:01:51,103
the,
I think it's philosophically sound and 

2880
02:01:53,031 --> 02:01:55,220
it's,
it's basically just a,

2881
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:56,773
to me it's,
it's a humble understanding of what 

2882
02:01:59,121 --> 02:02:00,080
existence is.

2883
02:02:00,290 --> 02:02:01,123
That we don't really know what this is.
Man's kind of born into the world naked 

2884
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:08,360
and we're here with nature and we're all
trying to figure it out and that morally

2885
02:02:08,361 --> 02:02:09,194
speaking,
we should all own our own lives and 

2886
02:02:11,151 --> 02:02:11,984
therefore own your own body and that,
and basically it all centers around 

2887
02:02:14,481 --> 02:02:16,670
property rights and the nonaggression 
principle,

2888
02:02:16,820 --> 02:02:17,653
which is just the idea that you should 
never initiate violence against the 

2889
02:02:19,551 --> 02:02:20,384
nonviolent person.
And then you just draw conclusions from 

2890
02:02:23,151 --> 02:02:23,871
that.
Well,

2891
02:02:23,871 --> 02:02:26,060
those are all really standard,
um,

2892
02:02:26,390 --> 02:02:29,120
points in libertarianism to get brought 
up all the time.

2893
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:30,133
But why is it that libertarianism,
even though it's so attractive to like 

2894
02:02:32,751 --> 02:02:34,160
young,
intelligent guys like you,

2895
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:35,293
why is it that that has never caught 
hold in a mainstream way as an 

2896
02:02:38,331 --> 02:02:41,690
alternative third party?
Because it really the,

2897
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:42,583
you've had like,
people like that run his independence 

2898
02:02:45,131 --> 02:02:47,180
that get a little bit of momentum,
but it's always,

2899
02:02:47,300 --> 02:02:48,410
people always look at it like,
well,

2900
02:02:48,411 --> 02:02:49,610
that's never going to work out.

2901
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:51,150
He's never really going to get there.
You,

2902
02:02:51,151 --> 02:02:52,040
you,
you know,

2903
02:02:52,041 --> 02:02:54,410
vote for Hillary because she has a 
chance.

2904
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:55,430
You know what I mean?
You get those.

2905
02:02:55,630 --> 02:02:57,680
Yeah.
Well I think there's a game and there's,

2906
02:02:57,740 --> 02:02:58,670
you know,
it's,

2907
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:00,380
it's,
um,

2908
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:01,633
there's like the government is a power 
center and it's in their interest to 

2909
02:03:05,271 --> 02:03:09,290
continue having power.
And I think usually most people are much

2910
02:03:09,291 --> 02:03:11,000
more,
if they get close to that power,

2911
02:03:11,210 --> 02:03:12,043
they're much more incentivized to try to
expand it and try to keep it than to at 

2912
02:03:15,801 --> 02:03:16,521
any point,
say you guys,

2913
02:03:16,521 --> 02:03:18,740
you know,
it'd be a lot more moral if we,

2914
02:03:18,741 --> 02:03:19,820
uh,
we didn't have this.

2915
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:20,751
And you know,
I mean,

2916
02:03:20,751 --> 02:03:22,670
it's like,
why did slavery persist for so long?

2917
02:03:22,671 --> 02:03:23,504
Because you know it's a,
it's a good way to get cotton without 

2918
02:03:24,861 --> 02:03:25,940
having to work.
Yeah.

2919
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:27,693
Yeah.
I mean people are getting rich off this 

2920
02:03:28,791 --> 02:03:30,930
thing and they certainly are,
but I do.

2921
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:31,833
I will.
I wonder how much time it has left like 

2922
02:03:33,570 --> 02:03:34,403
this.
This,

2923
02:03:34,760 --> 02:03:38,630
it seems like it's a reoccurring,
reoccurring theme that comes up over and

2924
02:03:38,631 --> 02:03:39,464
over again when people talk about the 
problems that we have with a running 

2925
02:03:41,661 --> 02:03:43,280
society,
we were currently doing it.

2926
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:45,950
He said this two party system is just so
preposterous.

2927
02:03:46,310 --> 02:03:50,270
It's so ridiculous to say that you have 
these two groups and they're both funded

2928
02:03:50,271 --> 02:03:51,104
by the same people,
the competing against each other 

2929
02:03:52,431 --> 02:03:54,650
allegedly,
but yet nothing changes.

2930
02:03:54,980 --> 02:03:57,470
And that this is the system and this is 
the only way to do it.

2931
02:03:57,471 --> 02:03:58,160
Like,
well,

2932
02:03:58,160 --> 02:03:58,993
how can we count?
We've got a hundred different systems 

2933
02:04:01,641 --> 02:04:04,700
and ideas and what does this grand old 
party,

2934
02:04:05,240 --> 02:04:09,530
what's the idea of there being a leader 
for 320 million people?

2935
02:04:09,531 --> 02:04:11,140
I mean,
none of it makes any sense at all.

2936
02:04:11,141 --> 02:04:14,780
Just be in an elephant she wants.
It's all still so weird how there's this

2937
02:04:14,781 --> 02:04:15,614
big,
like this big show about how much they 

2938
02:04:17,451 --> 02:04:18,284
hate each other,
but then they just come together over 

2939
02:04:19,971 --> 02:04:23,090
the most important issues feel betrayed.

2940
02:04:23,090 --> 02:04:25,640
When I see like Clinton laughing it up 
with Bush,

2941
02:04:26,010 --> 02:04:26,843
I'm like,
what the fuck are you guys laughing 

2942
02:04:27,981 --> 02:04:28,814
about?
How many people died when you were in 

2943
02:04:29,631 --> 02:04:30,464
office?
Right.

2944
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:32,810
And how the media is angle on it will 
and you know,

2945
02:04:32,811 --> 02:04:35,390
it'd be msnbc or Fox News who was 
supposedly hate each other.

2946
02:04:35,391 --> 02:04:37,070
But when you see all the presidents 
together,

2947
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:38,400
they're all kind of celebrating it.
They're like,

2948
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:41,100
it's nice that we could all come 
together and have this,

2949
02:04:41,101 --> 02:04:42,120
this toast.
Like what?

2950
02:04:42,450 --> 02:04:43,283
What is this?
I thought it was so you're all full of 

2951
02:04:44,821 --> 02:04:47,550
Shit and how is it that you know you 
have these things were so,

2952
02:04:47,551 --> 02:04:50,760
so the Republicans hate Obama.
Obama hates the Republicans.

2953
02:04:50,761 --> 02:04:51,594
They both think the other ones,
the reason why the country's falling 

2954
02:04:53,191 --> 02:04:54,480
apart.
But then when like,

2955
02:04:54,481 --> 02:04:55,314
you know,
something like the NDA bill where he 

2956
02:04:56,641 --> 02:04:57,474
says he can arrest American citizens 
with no charges and hold them 

2957
02:04:59,791 --> 02:05:01,800
indefinitely,
we all just get together and sign that,

2958
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:03,180
you know,
that's fine.

2959
02:05:03,540 --> 02:05:05,580
And the media,
it's not even like that big of a deal.

2960
02:05:06,270 --> 02:05:08,960
Like they just passed a law that said 
they can arrest you with that.

2961
02:05:09,030 --> 02:05:11,040
Like we just over the whole idea that 
you have rights,

2962
02:05:11,041 --> 02:05:13,230
we just overthrew that in one in one 
bill.

2963
02:05:13,350 --> 02:05:14,520
And uh,
but you know,

2964
02:05:14,580 --> 02:05:15,413
that'll get like a mention here that you
have to understand that that won't be 

2965
02:05:17,881 --> 02:05:19,380
used.
Don't worry about it.

2966
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:21,330
That's all for terrorist.
That's my favorite.

2967
02:05:21,331 --> 02:05:22,164
Obama actually,
he put in a signing statement when he 

2968
02:05:24,391 --> 02:05:26,220
signed it into law,
he said,

2969
02:05:26,221 --> 02:05:27,890
and I guess this was to like appease 
the,

2970
02:05:28,060 --> 02:05:30,630
the liberal activists who may be,
would be a little upset with him,

2971
02:05:30,631 --> 02:05:31,464
but he said,
my administration has no plans of 

2972
02:05:35,070 --> 02:05:38,250
detaining American citizens,
but we want to let you know that we read

2973
02:05:38,251 --> 02:05:40,110
your emails.
Fuck with us.

2974
02:05:40,111 --> 02:05:41,520
We'll see you in a hard,
yeah.

2975
02:05:42,470 --> 02:05:43,303
So who's okay with that?
Which is frustrating for everybody that 

2976
02:05:47,401 --> 02:05:51,480
nothing changes in that this two party 
system was in place when we were kids.

2977
02:05:51,500 --> 02:05:52,333
It's,
it's in place now and it's quite 

2978
02:05:53,701 --> 02:05:56,910
possibly it will be in place 50 years 
from now when we were dead.

2979
02:05:57,030 --> 02:05:59,490
I don't know.
I do think something is changing in this

2980
02:05:59,491 --> 02:06:03,120
election cycle and I don't,
I don't know that it's purely a positive

2981
02:06:03,121 --> 02:06:05,940
force but there's definitely something 
going on.

2982
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:07,013
I mean if you look at what's what's 
going on with trump and I'm no fan but 

2983
02:06:10,231 --> 02:06:11,820
it is a,
it is a moment.

2984
02:06:12,020 --> 02:06:12,853
Yeah.
Trump is having a real moment and he is 

2985
02:06:14,941 --> 02:06:15,774
kind of tearing down this matrix and a 
and and Bernie also had an interesting 

2986
02:06:20,731 --> 02:06:21,390
moment.
It's,

2987
02:06:21,390 --> 02:06:22,223
it's very interesting that they always,
the powers that be kind of decide who 

2988
02:06:25,801 --> 02:06:26,634
these people are going to be and it does
seem like this year people are really 

2989
02:06:29,221 --> 02:06:31,890
rejecting that on a very grassroots 
level.

2990
02:06:31,890 --> 02:06:32,221
Like,
no,

2991
02:06:32,221 --> 02:06:33,054
we don't buy this bullshit.
I wonder how much longer they can keep 

2992
02:06:35,371 --> 02:06:37,770
it up.
Well there's no real candidates.

2993
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:40,590
That's the problem.
I said you're dealing with scrubs.

2994
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:41,633
It's like this minor league ball team 
that wants to play in the superbowl 

2995
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:47,160
because there's some sort of a strike 
amongst really good players.

2996
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:49,470
It really seems like that.
I mean come on man,

2997
02:06:49,620 --> 02:06:53,730
you're telling me that Donald Trump is 
the best we can do or Hillary Clinton.

2998
02:06:55,060 --> 02:06:56,430
I mean,
how many of you just as Comedians,

2999
02:06:56,431 --> 02:07:01,431
like how many like charismatic,
just interesting people like do you know

3000
02:07:02,590 --> 02:07:03,423
show you do,
it's so many different like really 

3001
02:07:04,951 --> 02:07:06,450
smart,
interesting people.

3002
02:07:06,550 --> 02:07:09,380
You sit there like you're telling me we 
can't find one who won.

3003
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:10,253
But I think like you said before,
the real problem is that a good person 

3004
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:15,960
or any type of honest person would right
away go,

3005
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:18,160
no,
I can't rule 320 million people.

3006
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:19,253
Not only that,
you would never get to that position 

3007
02:07:21,630 --> 02:07:22,463
because you would be compromised every 
step of the way and then you'd become 

3008
02:07:25,740 --> 02:07:27,270
what they are.
The only,

3009
02:07:27,330 --> 02:07:28,163
I mean it's a really rig game and it's 
rigged through lobbyists and special 

3010
02:07:31,591 --> 02:07:34,170
interest groups and money and campaign 
funds.

3011
02:07:34,410 --> 02:07:38,410
By the time you get to that position 
unless you're a Bernie Sanders or Donald

3012
02:07:38,410 --> 02:07:39,243
Trump.
And that's what makes it interesting 

3013
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:44,530
because they're the only two people that
represents two completely new paradigms.

3014
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:49,360
You have Bernie who is this weird 
socialist type character,

3015
02:07:49,361 --> 02:07:50,194
democratic socialist character.
And then you have trump who's like the 

3016
02:07:52,661 --> 02:07:53,494
ultimate capitalist.
And both people represent entirely new 

3017
02:07:56,441 --> 02:07:57,274
groups because Donald Trump is 
essentially at least partially self 

3018
02:07:59,771 --> 02:08:01,270
funded.
And you know,

3019
02:08:01,271 --> 02:08:02,710
now he's trying to get money and 
there's,

3020
02:08:02,740 --> 02:08:04,670
well he's already the nominee though.
I mean he's,

3021
02:08:04,671 --> 02:08:05,800
he's cemented.
So it's a,

3022
02:08:05,801 --> 02:08:07,990
it's an interesting position where it's 
going to get some support.

3023
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:09,400
Yes.
But so far,

3024
02:08:09,670 --> 02:08:10,503
basically trump and sanders both found a
way to do it without taking corporate 

3025
02:08:13,841 --> 02:08:14,674
money.
Trump found a way to speak over the 

3026
02:08:15,911 --> 02:08:20,000
media and get the media to keep him in 
there 24 hour news cycle and Apulia this

3027
02:08:20,001 --> 02:08:21,400
shit out of everybody.
But they're both,

3028
02:08:21,430 --> 02:08:22,750
I mean,
I got to say they're not,

3029
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:24,033
I don't look at,
while they're personalities are very 

3030
02:08:25,511 --> 02:08:26,344
different.
I don't know if anything about their 

3031
02:08:26,801 --> 02:08:27,634
policy,
the policies are actually like 

3032
02:08:28,661 --> 02:08:29,494
diametrically opposed.
I think they're both kind of populists 

3033
02:08:31,181 --> 02:08:32,014
in a lot of ways.
Like Bernie Sanders has more of a re as 

3034
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:34,853
more of an ideology,
like this is my philosophy on what 

3035
02:08:36,761 --> 02:08:38,650
government should do.
And trump's just kinda like,

3036
02:08:38,870 --> 02:08:40,150
well,
well let's let it rip.

3037
02:08:40,570 --> 02:08:43,270
But they're both kind of like,
let me tell you what you want to hear to

3038
02:08:43,271 --> 02:08:44,290
the crowd.
Well,

3039
02:08:44,590 --> 02:08:45,423
trump is a carnival barker and you know,
he talks about that in the art of the 

3040
02:08:47,921 --> 02:08:48,340
deal.

3041
02:08:48,340 --> 02:08:49,173
I mean,
his,

3042
02:08:49,210 --> 02:08:50,043
his whole style of campaigning is,
is all mapped out in his books where he 

3043
02:08:55,031 --> 02:08:55,864
talks about this larger than life 
persona that he's created in order to 

3044
02:08:58,961 --> 02:09:02,080
make himself a public figure in order to
make himself more wealthy,

3045
02:09:02,081 --> 02:09:04,570
more popular,
and more able to get things done.

3046
02:09:04,780 --> 02:09:06,700
I mean,
this is like a strategy,

3047
02:09:07,090 --> 02:09:09,040
this,
this whole thing that he's doing like,

3048
02:09:09,041 --> 02:09:09,874
and I called them,
we're going to make that wall 10 feet 

3049
02:09:11,381 --> 02:09:12,214
higher.
Like that's all like Carnival Barker 

3050
02:09:14,290 --> 02:09:16,030
Shit.
But it's amazing that he,

3051
02:09:16,690 --> 02:09:17,523
he's stepped into the game of politics 
and almost ripped it open from the 

3052
02:09:21,581 --> 02:09:23,560
inside where he's like,
I'm just talking like a dude.

3053
02:09:23,740 --> 02:09:24,790
Yeah,
I'm not even doing it.

3054
02:09:24,910 --> 02:09:27,130
And I don't know how Hilary Clinton's 
going to handle this guy.

3055
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:29,620
Well how about when he was talking about
how big his Dick is?

3056
02:09:30,370 --> 02:09:34,270
Well he to be fair,
he just said there's no problem.

3057
02:09:34,300 --> 02:09:35,380
No look,
it's amazing.

3058
02:09:35,410 --> 02:09:36,243
He was insinuating there's someone was 
insinuate entity had small hands way a 

3059
02:09:38,411 --> 02:09:39,244
small penis.
And I just said I want to let you know 

3060
02:09:40,151 --> 02:09:42,610
there's no problems there.
He made a,

3061
02:09:42,700 --> 02:09:44,580
I have a big Dick.
So here's what happens.

3062
02:09:44,581 --> 02:09:45,430
Right?
This guy,

3063
02:09:45,431 --> 02:09:47,290
this was like I think a couple of 
decades ago.

3064
02:09:47,310 --> 02:09:48,143
Okay.
There's this guy who worked for vanity 

3065
02:09:49,001 --> 02:09:49,834
fair and he wrote something about trump 
having small hands and trump sent him a 

3066
02:09:55,601 --> 02:10:00,220
picture like head shots of his hands and
a note being like,

3067
02:10:00,250 --> 02:10:01,083
I don't have small hands.
Like he actually responded to them and 

3068
02:10:03,131 --> 02:10:03,964
this was out there.
Like I heard some people talk about 

3069
02:10:04,961 --> 02:10:05,794
this.
So Marco Rubio knew if he went at his 

3070
02:10:08,561 --> 02:10:13,270
hands just to makes sense.
Cause his hands aren't small.

3071
02:10:13,271 --> 02:10:14,104
No,
but for whatever reason he said 

3072
02:10:15,791 --> 02:10:16,480
something.
He goes,

3073
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:17,313
he,
Marco Rubio said he's got small hands 

3074
02:10:18,281 --> 02:10:19,114
and you know what they say about guys 
with small hands and this is the maniac 

3075
02:10:21,281 --> 02:10:22,210
that is Donald Trump.

3076
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:25,990
She couldn't not bring that up.
So the next debate he goes,

3077
02:10:25,991 --> 02:10:26,800
uh,
he goes,

3078
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:28,000
and by the way,
she said,

3079
02:10:28,001 --> 02:10:29,950
I have small hands.
I look at these hands.

3080
02:10:30,040 --> 02:10:31,300
That pretty good.
Am I right?

3081
02:10:32,260 --> 02:10:34,340
And just so you know,
he couldn't stop.

3082
02:10:34,341 --> 02:10:35,870
There she goes.
And just so you know,

3083
02:10:36,260 --> 02:10:38,510
he implied that because of these small 
hands,

3084
02:10:38,511 --> 02:10:41,990
that means something else is small and I
promise you there's no problem there.

3085
02:10:42,650 --> 02:10:43,700
Yeah,
it was very bizarre.

3086
02:10:43,701 --> 02:10:44,710
I mean,
strange.

3087
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:48,350
His fingers are relatively short.
They're not great,

3088
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:49,573
but it's does nothing weird.
Like where you'd have to comment about 

3089
02:10:52,071 --> 02:10:53,660
it.
They're not presidential hands.

3090
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:54,880
I'll say that.
What's the price?

3091
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:58,250
Abe Lincoln probably has some long ass 
crazy.

3092
02:10:58,660 --> 02:10:59,810
I mean,
I just,

3093
02:10:59,811 --> 02:11:00,700
uh,
it's a,

3094
02:11:00,701 --> 02:11:01,534
it's a weird thing to criticize though,
because you're talking about something 

3095
02:11:04,221 --> 02:11:05,054
that someone can't change.
It's like making fun of someone's ears 

3096
02:11:07,611 --> 02:11:08,660
when they're running for president.

3097
02:11:08,660 --> 02:11:09,440
Like,
hey man,

3098
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:11,300
those are,
but it's very strange.

3099
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:11,960
It's,
it's uh,

3100
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:15,350
but it is a tell to Donald Trump that he
can't not address it.

3101
02:11:15,590 --> 02:11:17,480
Like if you,
if you put that out there,

3102
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:20,240
he's got a comeback,
but it worked.

3103
02:11:20,241 --> 02:11:22,160
The problem is his comeback was 
effective.

3104
02:11:22,190 --> 02:11:23,930
Yeah.
So then he wins.

3105
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:26,300
So Marco Rubio,
Marco Rubio,

3106
02:11:26,301 --> 02:11:29,000
who's just this weird Mama's boy looking
putts,

3107
02:11:29,480 --> 02:11:30,313
like,
like he's just isn't how many charisma 

3108
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:35,510
when he would like be jabbing back and 
forth with trump.

3109
02:11:35,511 --> 02:11:35,871
Like,
dude,

3110
02:11:35,871 --> 02:11:38,030
you're an amateur.
Like he's going to chew you up.

3111
02:11:38,300 --> 02:11:41,570
He's used to being criticized.
He's used to being arrogant.

3112
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:43,440
He's used to shutting people down.
Yeah.

3113
02:11:43,660 --> 02:11:46,790
Well that's again,
that's another one of my issues with,

3114
02:11:46,850 --> 02:11:49,010
with Gary Johnson is that I just feel 
like,

3115
02:11:49,011 --> 02:11:49,491
man,
if the,

3116
02:11:49,491 --> 02:11:51,950
if the LP wants to do something,
if the libertarian,

3117
02:11:51,980 --> 02:11:52,730
you know,
if they want to,

3118
02:11:52,730 --> 02:11:53,563
they want to have a moment here and 
you're telling me the hope is if we can 

3119
02:11:55,881 --> 02:11:56,714
get to 15% in the polls,
then we get into a debate and I have to 

3120
02:11:59,301 --> 02:12:00,134
overlook the fact that this guy was 
already in a debate that nobody 

3121
02:12:01,941 --> 02:12:03,590
remembers because he didn't do anything 
in that.

3122
02:12:03,770 --> 02:12:05,270
And now he's got to go debate.
Trump,

3123
02:12:05,970 --> 02:12:09,290
trump,
I you got to send someone who's got some

3124
02:12:09,291 --> 02:12:10,124
type of,
well he's going to be in the debates 

3125
02:12:11,571 --> 02:12:12,200
though,
right?

3126
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:12,871
Gary Johnson?
No,

3127
02:12:12,871 --> 02:12:16,400
he's got to get 15% he's got to pull 
that and he's got to get into the polls.

3128
02:12:16,401 --> 02:12:20,570
Then he's got to get 15% in the polls.
It's a whole fucking fight and they also

3129
02:12:20,571 --> 02:12:21,404
have to choose which polls,
but I don't think they find him 

3130
02:12:23,151 --> 02:12:23,984
threatening.
It might actually be smart for them to 

3131
02:12:25,401 --> 02:12:28,490
allow him to expose,
I mean I think both sides would probably

3132
02:12:28,491 --> 02:12:29,324
think that he would expose something 
that the other side has and both sides 

3133
02:12:32,361 --> 02:12:33,194
would probably be under the impression 
there an opportunity to capitalize on 

3134
02:12:35,421 --> 02:12:35,721
it.
Well,

3135
02:12:35,721 --> 02:12:40,370
I think the left side,
because he's a lifelong Republican,

3136
02:12:40,790 --> 02:12:43,310
sees him is more likely to peel away 
votes from trump.

3137
02:12:43,470 --> 02:12:46,810
So in a weird way I think they want him 
in there because they want to,

3138
02:12:46,850 --> 02:12:48,140
they want to hand it to Hillary.

3139
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:50,630
He might be able to take advantage of 
some of that,

3140
02:12:50,631 --> 02:12:51,470
but I,
I don't know.

3141
02:12:51,560 --> 02:12:52,393
I think they,
even though this is a whole different 

3142
02:12:54,081 --> 02:12:55,610
year,
they really like the,

3143
02:12:55,920 --> 02:12:58,280
the control on the two party system.
You know,

3144
02:12:58,281 --> 02:12:59,190
the last time,
uh,

3145
02:12:59,610 --> 02:13:00,443
a third party really made any noise was,
was Ross Perot and they changed all the 

3146
02:13:03,951 --> 02:13:06,950
rules after that guy got out of there to
mention like presidential debates.

3147
02:13:06,951 --> 02:13:08,370
That's right.
It used to be like the,

3148
02:13:08,371 --> 02:13:09,204
uh,
women in the League of women voters or 

3149
02:13:10,431 --> 02:13:11,241
whatever.
It used to run it.

3150
02:13:11,241 --> 02:13:13,310
And then that now that just the 
Democrats and Republicans,

3151
02:13:13,311 --> 02:13:13,821
right.
Like they were like,

3152
02:13:13,821 --> 02:13:15,650
let's never let that happen again.
Yeah.

3153
02:13:15,651 --> 02:13:18,020
They fucked up.
They let that a crazy old billionaire by

3154
02:13:18,021 --> 02:13:19,460
time on TV.
Remember that?

3155
02:13:19,740 --> 02:13:21,620
Yup.
You're being hoodwinked.

3156
02:13:22,350 --> 02:13:23,183
I'll show you how know you don't want 
some crazy old Texas billionaire on 

3157
02:13:27,141 --> 02:13:29,780
television in the 1980s or whenever the 
fuck it was.

3158
02:13:30,260 --> 02:13:31,093
It's,
um,

3159
02:13:31,200 --> 02:13:32,033
it's just,
it's one of those things to me where I 

3160
02:13:33,811 --> 02:13:36,220
don't see how it's going to change.
I look at,

3161
02:13:36,221 --> 02:13:36,691
I go,
boy,

3162
02:13:36,691 --> 02:13:37,524
they can just keep running this fucking 
game for another four years and another 

3163
02:13:39,721 --> 02:13:43,050
four years and it'll keep going.
And then we'll be like 70 going,

3164
02:13:43,051 --> 02:13:44,340
what the fuck?
Man?

3165
02:13:44,341 --> 02:13:46,200
Still think so.
I think that's it.

3166
02:13:46,290 --> 02:13:49,870
I think we're,
we're on the verge of,

3167
02:13:49,970 --> 02:13:52,530
of the collapse.
And I don't know exactly where it verges

3168
02:13:52,531 --> 02:13:53,550
like,
I dunno,

3169
02:13:53,580 --> 02:13:56,010
you know,
how much longer president trump might do

3170
02:13:56,011 --> 02:13:56,850
it.
Maybe.

3171
02:13:57,060 --> 02:13:58,260
Maybe.
But if you,

3172
02:13:58,410 --> 02:14:01,320
I think if you look at a few kind of 
like fundamentals,

3173
02:14:01,770 --> 02:14:03,930
we're in the process of an empire 
fallen.

3174
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:05,670
Yeah.
Like the far,

3175
02:14:05,820 --> 02:14:09,390
far too expanded militarily,
drowning in debt.

3176
02:14:09,590 --> 02:14:10,770
And if you really look at the dead,
I mean,

3177
02:14:10,771 --> 02:14:11,604
it's not just the 19 trillion.
There's like over a hundred trillion in 

3178
02:14:13,651 --> 02:14:14,820
unfunded liabilities.

3179
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:15,653
Like all these Medicare and social 
security and all these programs there 

3180
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:19,830
are,
they're all going to blow up.

3181
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:21,030
Uh,
we've,

3182
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:22,060
we've also got,
you know,

3183
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:22,933
just trillions and trillions of dollars 
that are extended being held at these 

3184
02:14:25,651 --> 02:14:28,500
big banks that there's all these 
factors.

3185
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:30,680
And also look at the moral kind of like,
uh,

3186
02:14:30,890 --> 02:14:33,870
the cultural decay kind of going on that
trump,

3187
02:14:33,871 --> 02:14:38,730
I think kind of embodies.
I think there's a lot of indicators that

3188
02:14:38,731 --> 02:14:40,860
were in the,
in the crash process.

3189
02:14:40,980 --> 02:14:44,520
He embodies the cultural decay in,
in that one sense.

3190
02:14:44,521 --> 02:14:45,354
Then on the other sense,
you've got the co two cultural decay by 

3191
02:14:47,011 --> 02:14:47,844
social justice warriors and paper super 
over sensitive who Ralph Nader's 

3192
02:14:50,791 --> 02:14:52,620
rallying against.
Now Ralph Nay,

3193
02:14:52,650 --> 02:14:53,483
but I pulled this up on twitter today,
a Ralph Nader was saying that the men 

3194
02:14:57,451 --> 02:15:01,500
today are over sensitive because they 
never had to deal with the draft.

3195
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:02,841
He's like,
you're,

3196
02:15:02,841 --> 02:15:03,674
you're,
you guys are complaining about nothing 

3197
02:15:04,681 --> 02:15:06,090
like this is nonsense.

3198
02:15:06,090 --> 02:15:07,920
Good for Ralph Nader.
Them look at this,

3199
02:15:08,130 --> 02:15:08,963
this Ralph Nader on trigger warnings.
Young men are far too sensitive because 

3200
02:15:11,911 --> 02:15:14,820
they've never been in a draft and that 
fucking hilarious.

3201
02:15:14,821 --> 02:15:15,654
They're talking about trigger warnings,
but trigger trigger warnings make me 

3202
02:15:18,661 --> 02:15:21,120
want to fucking hit somebody.
It really does.

3203
02:15:22,190 --> 02:15:24,750
It's insanity.
It makes me so,

3204
02:15:24,751 --> 02:15:28,290
it's so fucking stupid that you're 
supposed to protect people from true.

3205
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:29,153
First of all that is not even have 
trigger works triggers work by like 

3206
02:15:32,101 --> 02:15:32,934
being in a place where something bad 
happened to you or hearing a sound or 

3207
02:15:35,941 --> 02:15:36,774
seeing a thing.
It's not bringing up the act of like if 

3208
02:15:38,761 --> 02:15:40,190
someone says you know,
Murder,

3209
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:42,150
oh my dad was murdered,
it's a trigger warning.

3210
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:43,880
Why didn't you warn me?
The trigger,

3211
02:15:43,881 --> 02:15:45,330
it hit me.
Like that's how,

3212
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:47,310
but that's the whole world's going to 
trigger you then.

3213
02:15:47,550 --> 02:15:50,220
Then every fucking piece of media,
every movie,

3214
02:15:50,221 --> 02:15:54,080
every television show has the potential 
for being a trigger warning is really,

3215
02:15:54,100 --> 02:15:55,260
and like,
it's not as if like,

3216
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:56,113
uh,
I just hate people and I don't care if 

3217
02:15:58,531 --> 02:16:00,240
you're triggered and you know,
deal with your past.

3218
02:16:00,240 --> 02:16:01,073
Like I think we have a big epidemic of 
soldiers coming back suffering from 

3219
02:16:04,141 --> 02:16:04,974
PTSD.
I'd like to not send them towards so we 

3220
02:16:06,511 --> 02:16:08,910
don't have to deal with this,
but the idea that we should,

3221
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:12,600
we should change.
We should like nerf foam the world.

3222
02:16:12,710 --> 02:16:14,430
Yeah.
In case your triggered.

3223
02:16:14,640 --> 02:16:19,640
So a college now can't explore anything 
they want to because what if someone had

3224
02:16:19,861 --> 02:16:20,694
something violent in their past happen 
and then it seems to be a very 

3225
02:16:22,771 --> 02:16:24,600
convenient thing where,
you know,

3226
02:16:24,601 --> 02:16:28,140
like the feminists or the social justice
warriors are like policing rape jokes in

3227
02:16:28,141 --> 02:16:30,040
the comedy community,
but they don't ever seem to

3228
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:32,890
be policing like a war joke or a,
you know,

3229
02:16:32,891 --> 02:16:35,380
it's like they don't seem to care about 
men being triggered.

3230
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:37,750
And uh,
like you were saying,

3231
02:16:37,751 --> 02:16:38,584
it's mostly just infantiles bullshit.
It's just these privileged kids on 

3232
02:16:41,711 --> 02:16:42,544
college campuses who are like want to 
shut down a conservative speaker from 

3233
02:16:45,911 --> 02:16:47,740
talking.
It's a civilian sanity.

3234
02:16:47,790 --> 02:16:48,370
Yeah,
it's,

3235
02:16:48,370 --> 02:16:50,440
it's,
it's so fucking,

3236
02:16:51,290 --> 02:16:55,810
the way they're doing is rabid.
It's like there's so frothy at the mouth

3237
02:16:55,811 --> 02:17:00,730
and so like taken away with the idea 
that they're doing some incredible right

3238
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:01,833
and this has to be done and there's this
justice must prevail and transgender 

3239
02:17:05,651 --> 02:17:07,690
people should be able to use the women's
room without,

3240
02:17:08,070 --> 02:17:08,903
you know,
any questioning whatsoever about where 

3241
02:17:10,271 --> 02:17:11,104
they stand.
Like there's some weirdness going on 

3242
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:16,960
today that is like what we were talking 
about when people are young,

3243
02:17:16,961 --> 02:17:19,990
when you could send them to war.
Then when you send these young people to

3244
02:17:19,991 --> 02:17:22,720
war that they don't,
they don't really have enough data yet.

3245
02:17:23,170 --> 02:17:24,790
Well,
there's a lot of that going on with as a

3246
02:17:24,791 --> 02:17:25,624
social war and these people don't have a
lot of data either and they're just 

3247
02:17:28,871 --> 02:17:32,170
furious and foaming at the mouth and 
when all is said and done,

3248
02:17:32,171 --> 02:17:35,560
the dust settles when they're older,
they're probably not even going to be on

3249
02:17:35,561 --> 02:17:37,560
that team anymore.
You know,

3250
02:17:37,561 --> 02:17:38,394
you're,
you're probably going to wise up and 

3251
02:17:39,101 --> 02:17:39,934
realize how fucking goofy those people 
you're hanging around with are who are 

3252
02:17:42,191 --> 02:17:44,530
getting mad at white people for wearing 
dreadlocks.

3253
02:17:44,770 --> 02:17:46,300
Oh,
my social appropriation.

3254
02:17:46,301 --> 02:17:47,740
Cultural appropriation.
It's like,

3255
02:17:47,741 --> 02:17:50,380
listen,
we all hate white people in dreadlocks,

3256
02:17:50,530 --> 02:17:51,363
but you've actually made me someone I 
hate more than white people in 

3257
02:17:53,381 --> 02:17:55,510
dreadlocks.
That's how much you fucked up.

3258
02:17:55,540 --> 02:17:56,373
Not only that,
you don't even know where dreadlocks 

3259
02:17:57,971 --> 02:17:59,320
came from.
First of all,

3260
02:17:59,530 --> 02:18:01,690
why do people have had dreadlocks 
throughout history?

3261
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:02,553
That's what you,
when you were comparing the kind of 

3262
02:18:03,521 --> 02:18:05,980
cultural decay from the trump supporters
and the social justice warriors.

3263
02:18:05,980 --> 02:18:09,280
I do see a lot of it just rooted in like
Anti Intellectual Ism.

3264
02:18:09,310 --> 02:18:10,001
I mean,
there's just like,

3265
02:18:10,001 --> 02:18:10,990
no,
it doesn't matter.

3266
02:18:10,991 --> 02:18:12,500
You don't need to know anything you 
need.

3267
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:14,560
I mean they'll,
they will shut down.

3268
02:18:14,740 --> 02:18:16,690
Uh,
Christina Hoff summers speech.

3269
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:18,580
Yes.
But I think she's amazing.

3270
02:18:18,581 --> 02:18:20,920
I saw you did a great podcast with her.
Uh,

3271
02:18:20,950 --> 02:18:21,581
but the,
I mean,

3272
02:18:21,581 --> 02:18:23,020
she is,
she's a feminist.

3273
02:18:23,021 --> 02:18:26,320
She's a liberal,
a liberal feminist who's just going,

3274
02:18:26,410 --> 02:18:27,041
oh,
by the way,

3275
02:18:27,041 --> 02:18:28,950
your data is a little off.
Yes.

3276
02:18:29,770 --> 02:18:31,480
Rape apologist.
Exactly.

3277
02:18:31,510 --> 02:18:36,510
She just talks about the facts and she,
she calls herself a factual feminist.

3278
02:18:36,580 --> 02:18:39,050
That's her statement.
And there's,

3279
02:18:39,110 --> 02:18:44,110
there's something wrong with telling 
people they have things wrong to them.

3280
02:18:44,650 --> 02:18:45,483
I mean,
this is how crazy the left has gotten 

3281
02:18:47,170 --> 02:18:48,180
because you're,
you're what,

3282
02:18:48,190 --> 02:18:50,980
you're,
you're 20 and you figured everything out

3283
02:18:51,160 --> 02:18:52,480
evidently.
Well,

3284
02:18:52,481 --> 02:18:53,314
it's just noise.
There's a lot of noise and sometimes in 

3285
02:18:55,211 --> 02:18:57,550
those noises or some important points on
both sides.

3286
02:18:57,610 --> 02:18:59,980
But boy,
there's a whole lot of noise too.

3287
02:19:00,190 --> 02:19:00,851
And it's,
it's,

3288
02:19:00,851 --> 02:19:01,684
it's a lot of arguing,
a lot of yelling gets done that not a 

3289
02:19:05,021 --> 02:19:08,320
lot of progress gets made.
Just people digging their heels and they

3290
02:19:08,321 --> 02:19:10,210
take aside and they draw a line in the 
sand.

3291
02:19:10,211 --> 02:19:11,044
And if you've got the people on the 
right and the people on the left and 

3292
02:19:13,640 --> 02:19:14,680
oof.
Yeah,

3293
02:19:14,681 --> 02:19:18,130
like you said at the beginning of it 
becomes a big like team I identity thing

3294
02:19:18,131 --> 02:19:18,964
and then you're like,
then it's just justifying the position 

3295
02:19:20,741 --> 02:19:22,840
you're already in.
So you're just looking for kind of,

3296
02:19:22,841 --> 02:19:23,674
you know,
confirmation bias like my team's right 

3297
02:19:24,851 --> 02:19:25,780
or my teams.
Right.

3298
02:19:25,781 --> 02:19:29,030
And Yeah.
And is everybody so God damn sensitive,

3299
02:19:29,390 --> 02:19:34,130
like the gender Pronoun thing is so 
fucking bananas.

3300
02:19:34,460 --> 02:19:37,700
Like you should know that if you're a 
dude and you look like a woman,

3301
02:19:37,970 --> 02:19:38,803
okay.
That people are going to get that wrong 

3302
02:19:39,951 --> 02:19:40,784
on occasion.

3303
02:19:41,030 --> 02:19:41,661
Like,
okay,

3304
02:19:41,661 --> 02:19:42,261
what,
what,

3305
02:19:42,261 --> 02:19:43,430
what do you look like?
Okay.

3306
02:19:43,550 --> 02:19:45,680
Do you look like Catherine Zeta Jones in
a bikini?

3307
02:19:45,770 --> 02:19:46,251
Well,
if you do,

3308
02:19:46,251 --> 02:19:48,800
people are going to say her and if they 
say her,

3309
02:19:48,801 --> 02:19:50,060
that's not a bad thing.
Oh,

3310
02:19:50,061 --> 02:19:51,980
you're assuming my gender.
You know,

3311
02:19:51,981 --> 02:19:52,814
there's people out there that they think
that you should name your dog gender 

3312
02:19:55,581 --> 02:19:58,250
neutral names cause your dog can't 
decide.

3313
02:19:58,400 --> 02:19:59,233
Like this is a real debate amongst 
feminists and social justice warriors 

3314
02:20:01,971 --> 02:20:02,804
who have animals,
whether or not they should impose their 

3315
02:20:05,450 --> 02:20:07,550
stereotypes that they have on human 
beings,

3316
02:20:07,551 --> 02:20:08,384
on their dogs and cats.
But there's some look and it's just 

3317
02:20:10,941 --> 02:20:11,774
insanity.
But I feel like there's something like 

3318
02:20:13,461 --> 02:20:16,670
on these college campuses that's almost 
like that's housing,

3319
02:20:16,671 --> 02:20:20,240
that they're letting them develop these 
ridiculous ideas.

3320
02:20:20,420 --> 02:20:21,680
And I'll tell you,
I think part of it,

3321
02:20:21,710 --> 02:20:22,543
I really blame the college professors 
for a lot of this because I think these 

3322
02:20:24,561 --> 02:20:25,394
are also people who have,
a lot of them have lived in college 

3323
02:20:27,471 --> 02:20:28,304
their entire lives.

3324
02:20:28,460 --> 02:20:29,293
There are people who go to college and 
then just stay in college and they get 

3325
02:20:31,221 --> 02:20:32,030
post,
you know,

3326
02:20:32,030 --> 02:20:32,863
graduate degrees and then they teach and
they're kind of letting this happen and 

3327
02:20:36,441 --> 02:20:37,490
no one's going like,
okay,

3328
02:20:37,491 --> 02:20:39,050
shut up.
That's not a real issue.

3329
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:39,970
Right.
Look,

3330
02:20:39,980 --> 02:20:40,940
I'm,
I'm all for like,

3331
02:20:41,510 --> 02:20:43,130
I'm a completely return.
You should be able to,

3332
02:20:43,250 --> 02:20:44,083
if you,
if you have a doctor who's willing to 

3333
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:48,560
perform a surgery on you and you want to
identify as her instead of him,

3334
02:20:48,770 --> 02:20:50,390
I'll call you her.
Cause who cares?

3335
02:20:50,420 --> 02:20:52,220
I'm not going to call you zee.
No,

3336
02:20:52,280 --> 02:20:55,160
that's fucking ridiculous.
But you also can't,

3337
02:20:55,190 --> 02:20:56,900
even if I'm willing to call you 
something,

3338
02:20:56,930 --> 02:20:57,763
you can't make it a huge issue with not 
everybody is willing to call you that 

3339
02:21:01,140 --> 02:21:03,770
like this isn't,
let me see or is here.

3340
02:21:03,950 --> 02:21:06,120
Have you seen here her that's,
yeah,

3341
02:21:07,390 --> 02:21:09,050
there's like 18 of those now yet.

3342
02:21:09,060 --> 02:21:13,700
Like Lgbtq is not even close to all the 
letters that are on that thing anymore.

3343
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:17,210
Well how about in New York?
They're going to find businesses if they

3344
02:21:17,211 --> 02:21:18,044
intentionally mis-gender you so you can 
get sued and fine for like a quarter 

3345
02:21:23,270 --> 02:21:24,710
million dollars have you don't call 
someone Z.

3346
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:25,760
Yeah.
See and this is where,

3347
02:21:25,790 --> 02:21:28,460
this is where it becomes like a real 
fucking problem is it's like,

3348
02:21:28,461 --> 02:21:28,971
okay,
you know what?

3349
02:21:28,971 --> 02:21:29,804
You guys can have your little fun and 
games and your safe space on college 

3350
02:21:31,701 --> 02:21:32,720
campus,
all you want to.

3351
02:21:32,810 --> 02:21:33,643
But now you start bringing in the 
forceful arm of government to actually 

3352
02:21:35,991 --> 02:21:39,680
go fuck over a business owner who's 
trying to provide jobs and you know,

3353
02:21:39,681 --> 02:21:40,514
feed his kids.
But even it becomes a problem even in 

3354
02:21:43,041 --> 02:21:43,874
colleges because what if you don't 
subscribe to those ideologies and you 

3355
02:21:46,471 --> 02:21:49,760
gotta go to school with these monkeys 
and they're all running around insisting

3356
02:21:49,761 --> 02:21:51,410
there their pronoun a,
Z,

3357
02:21:51,411 --> 02:21:53,210
h e.
And if you don't say it,

3358
02:21:53,211 --> 02:21:55,370
you're a shit Lord.
Like whoa.

3359
02:21:55,430 --> 02:21:55,701
Yeah.
Well,

3360
02:21:55,701 --> 02:21:57,320
it's also real scared of the fact that 
if you've ever,

3361
02:21:57,321 --> 02:21:58,560
you know,
had a drunken hookup,

3362
02:21:58,580 --> 02:22:00,560
you're a rapist,
which is by the way,

3363
02:22:00,620 --> 02:22:01,453
only the man only demand of course.
And that's what happened at Occidental 

3364
02:22:04,491 --> 02:22:05,211
here.
And,

3365
02:22:05,211 --> 02:22:06,044
um,
when we talked about on the podcast 

3366
02:22:07,641 --> 02:22:08,474
with,
um,

3367
02:22:09,350 --> 02:22:10,880
professor renegade history

3368
02:22:10,910 --> 02:22:12,430
three

3369
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:14,120
fattiest Russell,
daddy's Russell,

3370
02:22:14,130 --> 02:22:16,190
who's brilliant,
brilliant guy.

3371
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:17,083
And,
um,

3372
02:22:17,150 --> 02:22:17,983
we were talking about how incredible it 
is that they find a way to justify to 

3373
02:22:21,621 --> 02:22:24,890
people hooking up with text messages 
where the girl saying,

3374
02:22:24,891 --> 02:22:26,370
come over,
bring condoms.

3375
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:27,593
They have sex and the guy is the one who
is a rapist because they were both 

3376
02:22:30,211 --> 02:22:31,320
drunk.
That's insane.

3377
02:22:31,321 --> 02:22:32,154
The guy got kicked out of school and 
he's still in the middle of lawsuit 

3378
02:22:33,621 --> 02:22:34,190
lawsuits.
It's,

3379
02:22:34,190 --> 02:22:35,280
it's,
it's insane.

3380
02:22:35,281 --> 02:22:36,114
But it's also like a fascinating glimpse
into how you see things because it's 

3381
02:22:39,331 --> 02:22:42,300
weird how you,
it's almost like these guys come back to

3382
02:22:42,301 --> 02:22:46,410
be the caricature of what the 1950s 
chauvinist was supposed to be.

3383
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:49,230
Assuming that women are these fragile,
delicate creatures.

3384
02:22:49,231 --> 02:22:51,340
Exactly.
Handle the same thing a man can.

3385
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:53,310
It's like you're really being the sexist
here.

3386
02:22:53,400 --> 02:22:55,500
Exactly.
Like all those guys.

3387
02:22:55,501 --> 02:22:56,670
Um,
who,

3388
02:22:56,760 --> 02:22:57,593
who would like I remember was a big 
thing on your show when Jamie Kilstein 

3389
02:23:00,091 --> 02:23:02,880
was on about the Tosh,
a rape joke.

3390
02:23:02,881 --> 02:23:04,510
But I always want,
I wonder what I,

3391
02:23:04,530 --> 02:23:06,060
and I've argued with a few people like 
that,

3392
02:23:06,330 --> 02:23:08,220
who I do now,
by the way,

3393
02:23:08,221 --> 02:23:10,470
I'm not throwing this out in the stupid 
way that it's thrown out when they go.

3394
02:23:10,470 --> 02:23:12,390
More men are raped and women are raped.
That's not,

3395
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:14,820
but why is it seeing as that,
that is a fact,

3396
02:23:14,821 --> 02:23:16,860
prison included and stuff like that.
Why is that?

3397
02:23:16,861 --> 02:23:17,694
Every time you think of this scenario 
where someone's triggered from a rape 

3398
02:23:20,791 --> 02:23:22,890
joke,
it's always a woman you always like,

3399
02:23:22,891 --> 02:23:23,724
what if there's a woman in the crowd 
who's been triggered and what if this 

3400
02:23:24,961 --> 02:23:27,180
like it's never a concern that it could 
be a man.

3401
02:23:27,870 --> 02:23:32,400
It's cause we were tribal and we break 
off into male versus female teams.

3402
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:35,160
If the males are the rapists on both 
accounts,

3403
02:23:35,340 --> 02:23:37,350
men are raping the women and they're 
raping the man.

3404
02:23:37,351 --> 02:23:38,181
See,
I told you man,

3405
02:23:38,181 --> 02:23:39,420
her shit,
the raping each other,

3406
02:23:39,421 --> 02:23:40,254
right?
But no one seems to feel for that rape 

3407
02:23:41,671 --> 02:23:44,520
victim because of men because they're on
the wrong team.

3408
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:46,290
I'll dude,
you're on a shitlord team.

3409
02:23:46,410 --> 02:23:47,770
Kurt made this up point.

3410
02:23:47,770 --> 02:23:51,310
Did you ever see the law and order 
episode when they did tell you now?

3411
02:23:51,360 --> 02:23:53,880
No,
but do you ever seen any Milan order?

3412
02:23:54,950 --> 02:23:57,090
They did the one on standup comics and 
rape jokes.

3413
02:23:57,110 --> 02:23:58,050
No,
dude,

3414
02:23:58,290 --> 02:23:59,123
it's no they did.
It's the worst thing that's ever been 

3415
02:24:00,631 --> 02:24:01,710
made.
Oh Dude.

3416
02:24:01,711 --> 02:24:02,544
It's not even like,
you can't even believe how bad it is 

3417
02:24:05,640 --> 02:24:07,080
until you see it.
It's like this,

3418
02:24:07,081 --> 02:24:08,100
this,
this guy.

3419
02:24:08,101 --> 02:24:10,110
Makes a rape joke at him not at a comedy
club.

3420
02:24:10,111 --> 02:24:10,944
And of course it chills because that's 
what happens when you tell a woman in 

3421
02:24:12,991 --> 02:24:14,430
the crowd.
You hope she gets raped.

3422
02:24:14,650 --> 02:24:16,830
Everyone just laughs at the top of the 
anyway,

3423
02:24:17,100 --> 02:24:17,933
and then,
uh,

3424
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:18,953
and then by the end,
then she gets raped after that because 

3425
02:24:20,941 --> 02:24:21,774
he made the rape joke.
It leads to rape and then I'll do you 

3426
02:24:23,341 --> 02:24:25,620
one better at the end.
He's actually the rapist,

3427
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:26,820
the guy telling the rape joke.

3428
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:29,130
It turns out to be the way it was,
like the most ridiculous,

3429
02:24:29,400 --> 02:24:33,330
irresponsible thing ever at a Kurt,
Kurt medsker made this point.

3430
02:24:33,331 --> 02:24:35,340
I just think it's so fucking funny,
but he goes,

3431
02:24:35,490 --> 02:24:38,430
don't think threatened men with rape on 
every episode of that show.

3432
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:40,350
Like every episode,
they're like,

3433
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:43,650
you better start talking and then like,
you don't do very good in prison.

3434
02:24:43,651 --> 02:24:44,461
And you're like,
well,

3435
02:24:44,461 --> 02:24:45,294
really?
You're not going to just go clean that 

3436
02:24:45,901 --> 02:24:47,360
up.
You're gonna threaten me with it.

3437
02:24:47,610 --> 02:24:49,800
But you're going to use that as a 
negotiation tactic.

3438
02:24:50,700 --> 02:24:51,860
That's so fun.
What's,

3439
02:24:51,861 --> 02:24:54,600
it's just shitty show.
Those shows were all shit.

3440
02:24:54,990 --> 02:24:55,823
Every one of those crime shows.
What the fuck is it about America where 

3441
02:24:58,861 --> 02:25:02,160
we want to watch hospital shows and 
police shows.

3442
02:25:02,490 --> 02:25:03,323
That's all we want to watch.
We want to watch people that are in 

3443
02:25:05,131 --> 02:25:09,030
trouble is trying to hide from the law 
or someone that's worried that mom's not

3444
02:25:09,031 --> 02:25:11,200
gonna make it and they're holding our 
hand on.

3445
02:25:11,201 --> 02:25:14,340
The doctors work in fiercely and the 
young handsome doctor,

3446
02:25:14,490 --> 02:25:16,690
he leaves after 16 hours and he's 
sweating.

3447
02:25:16,691 --> 02:25:17,524
He takes his hand and then another guy 
comes in with a gunshot wound and back 

3448
02:25:19,571 --> 02:25:20,910
to work.
Wow.

3449
02:25:20,911 --> 02:25:24,190
So noble cut to commercials for fucking

3450
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:25,113
tie deodorant and whatever.
Something about poo and fucking Toyota 

3451
02:25:29,021 --> 02:25:33,240
trucks and nobody goes to sleep.
She'd wake up in the morning,

3452
02:25:33,260 --> 02:25:34,093
I'm tying to consume.
We are a weird fucking people over the 

3453
02:25:36,161 --> 02:25:36,994
weirdest thing where the weirdest thing,
it's because collectively you have to 

3454
02:25:39,701 --> 02:25:42,710
look at us as what we are as a giant 
super organism.

3455
02:25:42,850 --> 02:25:43,683
Like what are we waiting on?
We would look at it ourselves inside of 

3456
02:25:46,001 --> 02:25:46,834
our culture and our belief systems and 
our actions and what gets done and the 

3457
02:25:50,351 --> 02:25:53,080
pollution in the environment,
but overall,

3458
02:25:53,081 --> 02:25:56,530
what is the species doing when you're 
looking at it as an outsider,

3459
02:25:56,590 --> 02:25:58,720
if you were completely removed from 
culture,

3460
02:25:58,870 --> 02:26:01,960
completely removed from tradition and 
communication.

3461
02:26:01,961 --> 02:26:06,490
He just looked at us as like some weird 
organism like what is it trying to do?

3462
02:26:06,790 --> 02:26:09,430
What's just making better stuff all the 
time?

3463
02:26:09,520 --> 02:26:10,353
That's all it's doing and all this other
stuff that it does is just to distract 

3464
02:26:13,431 --> 02:26:15,280
it while it's making better stuff.

3465
02:26:15,460 --> 02:26:16,293
All these little chicken dances and 
peacock feathers and all the fucking 

3466
02:26:19,780 --> 02:26:22,540
weird noises it mags and virtue 
signaling.

3467
02:26:22,850 --> 02:26:23,683
I have a mattress and I'm carrying it 
around to my rapist is brought to 

3468
02:26:26,111 --> 02:26:29,070
justice.
All that madness and all the arguing and

3469
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:31,540
all the craziness is going on.
It's just a distraction.

3470
02:26:31,541 --> 02:26:33,460
While it's making better and faster 
computers,

3471
02:26:33,740 --> 02:26:34,990
that's all it is.
It's,

3472
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:35,833
it's creating an artificial life form.
It's going to do it under this guise of 

3473
02:26:40,270 --> 02:26:43,600
of of Christianity and Islam and all 
these different things.

3474
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:44,800
He's like,
oh no.

3475
02:26:44,801 --> 02:26:46,210
Well,
you know as long as the way,

3476
02:26:46,240 --> 02:26:49,480
oh no Christians way.
Meanwhile these a robot,

3477
02:26:49,690 --> 02:26:50,523
a robot overlord that the switch is 
about to get turned on and you're 

3478
02:26:54,341 --> 02:26:55,600
fucked.
You're all fucked.

3479
02:26:55,690 --> 02:26:57,050
But it's almost like you out.
It's,

3480
02:26:57,060 --> 02:27:00,250
it's the evolutionary game of numbers we
were saying before.

3481
02:27:00,251 --> 02:27:03,670
So you need it.
Throw all these people out to get a tiny

3482
02:27:03,671 --> 02:27:04,504
percentage that will be geniuses that 
we'll keep this thing moving and then 

3483
02:27:06,551 --> 02:27:08,440
you need,
the rest of us are basically just waste.

3484
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:08,831
It's like,
yeah,

3485
02:27:08,831 --> 02:27:11,470
you're just jerking off and watching 
some dumb reality show.

3486
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:14,380
But if you keep fucking keep fucking,
eventually a genius will pop at who will

3487
02:27:14,381 --> 02:27:17,080
move this thing forward a little bit and
a little bit.

3488
02:27:17,450 --> 02:27:18,283
And then the robot,
we're essentially like a giant hive of 

3489
02:27:20,501 --> 02:27:21,334
worker ants with potential options.
Like he really can write Harry Potter 

3490
02:27:25,391 --> 02:27:27,280
and break away from the rest of the 
worker ants.

3491
02:27:27,460 --> 02:27:28,293
You really can't have a kid.
It's a fucking matching genius cause he 

3492
02:27:30,131 --> 02:27:31,690
dropped him on his head when he was a 
baby.

3493
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,540
They don't want to tell anybody why this
kid is so fucking good at math.

3494
02:27:36,010 --> 02:27:36,843
There's a lot of that going on man.
And those little fuckers grew up to be 

3495
02:27:39,311 --> 02:27:40,144
like some Ilan musk character that 
starts making electric cars in the 

3496
02:27:42,761 --> 02:27:45,160
hyperloop that gets you to San Francisco
in three minutes.

3497
02:27:45,440 --> 02:27:46,273
There is some weird shit happening and 
it's all happened in like exponentially 

3498
02:27:49,421 --> 02:27:50,254
all around us all the time adding up 
while we're worried about trigger 

3499
02:27:53,801 --> 02:27:54,634
warnings and whether or not trainees can
use the fucking men's room or the 

3500
02:27:58,151 --> 02:28:00,820
women's room and like that whole 
particularly,

3501
02:28:00,821 --> 02:28:01,654
I mean that's angry,
that whole culture on the left of 

3502
02:28:04,031 --> 02:28:04,900
whatever you want to call it.

3503
02:28:04,900 --> 02:28:07,990
Like the social justice warrior that 
people call it the regressive left.

3504
02:28:07,991 --> 02:28:09,610
I like that term a lot.
I like that term,

3505
02:28:10,090 --> 02:28:13,270
but it really is just insanity.
I was watching,

3506
02:28:13,271 --> 02:28:14,860
uh,
recently the,

3507
02:28:14,861 --> 02:28:16,110
um,
did you ever see the uh,

3508
02:28:16,150 --> 02:28:19,370
the 30 for 30 on the Duke Lacrosse?
Yes.

3509
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:22,130
I mean it's first

3510
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:23,720
of that,
that accusation,

3511
02:28:23,750 --> 02:28:24,583
it's not like there was a,
it was a gray area or like they had sex 

3512
02:28:27,411 --> 02:28:29,990
and she was a little drunk or they had 
like nothing happened.

3513
02:28:30,020 --> 02:28:30,853
They didn't have sex.
This crazy person who's in jail for 

3514
02:28:32,601 --> 02:28:36,860
murder now made something up and it's 
interesting to watch it and like looking

3515
02:28:36,861 --> 02:28:38,570
back,
you know that what happens,

3516
02:28:38,571 --> 02:28:39,404
you know she made it up and seeing the,
the social justice warriors protest to 

3517
02:28:42,831 --> 02:28:46,790
these guys and the White Knights,
the dudes who are hanging out right next

3518
02:28:46,791 --> 02:28:47,624
to the feminist chick going,
these lacrosse guys are out of control 

3519
02:28:50,241 --> 02:28:51,530
and they should go to jail.
And you're like,

3520
02:28:51,531 --> 02:28:53,240
dude,
nothing fucking happened.

3521
02:28:53,270 --> 02:28:56,480
How about Nancy grace as you guys never 
even took any heat for that?

3522
02:28:56,870 --> 02:29:00,950
She was on TV calling for their arrest 
on TV,

3523
02:29:00,951 --> 02:29:01,784
accusing them of this in front of 
millions and millions of people and 

3524
02:29:03,591 --> 02:29:06,650
somehow or another she didn't get sued 
somehow or another,

3525
02:29:06,651 --> 02:29:07,550
she didn't get brought to jail.

3526
02:29:07,590 --> 02:29:09,850
They should have pulled her fucking show
off the air.

3527
02:29:09,851 --> 02:29:10,341
You should.
I mean,

3528
02:29:10,341 --> 02:29:11,810
what?
What does it take to get fired?

3529
02:29:11,960 --> 02:29:14,690
It takes being a man.
She was a man doing the exact same thing

3530
02:29:14,691 --> 02:29:16,760
about a woman doing something horrible.
Oh,

3531
02:29:16,761 --> 02:29:17,580
I bet you're right.
Yeah.

3532
02:29:17,580 --> 02:29:20,840
He was a team of women and that did 
something tear that were alleged to have

3533
02:29:20,841 --> 02:29:21,674
done something terrible.
And she was ranting and he was ranting 

3534
02:29:23,871 --> 02:29:27,020
and raving about these women being 
brought to justice and brought to jail.

3535
02:29:27,021 --> 02:29:27,854
And it turns out it was,
there was no crime being committed at 

3536
02:29:29,451 --> 02:29:30,980
all.
You'd have to apologize.

3537
02:29:30,981 --> 02:29:32,480
You would,
she didn't even have to apologize.

3538
02:29:32,481 --> 02:29:35,480
She didn't do shit.
I can't remember who the other reporter,

3539
02:29:35,730 --> 02:29:36,563
um,
you remember at the end of the 

3540
02:29:37,341 --> 02:29:39,260
documentary,
this is the one who apologizes,

3541
02:29:39,560 --> 02:29:40,970
but she actually,
she goes like,

3542
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:41,600
she,
um,

3543
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:42,141
she's like,
look,

3544
02:29:42,141 --> 02:29:44,120
I,
she apologized and she wrote a thing,

3545
02:29:44,121 --> 02:29:45,140
like an apology to them.

3546
02:29:45,410 --> 02:29:47,410
Oh No.
Then they cut back to the,

3547
02:29:47,560 --> 02:29:50,180
the articles that she was writing at the
time.

3548
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:51,950
And it's like this insane.
She's like,

3549
02:29:52,010 --> 02:29:52,843
these boys all know what happened and 
they know they're guilty and they need 

3550
02:29:55,701 --> 02:29:56,730
to be punished for this,
blah,

3551
02:29:56,731 --> 02:29:59,030
blah.
And then she's even in acknowledging it,

3552
02:29:59,180 --> 02:29:59,931
she goes,
well,

3553
02:29:59,931 --> 02:30:00,764
you know,
I do think the fact that I was sexually 

3554
02:30:02,721 --> 02:30:05,690
assaulted in college probably did come 
into play.

3555
02:30:05,691 --> 02:30:08,870
And how core fucking snow.
Well,

3556
02:30:08,871 --> 02:30:10,910
guess what,
now you can't be a journalist.

3557
02:30:10,911 --> 02:30:12,350
And then not only that,
I don't know what to tell you.

3558
02:30:12,700 --> 02:30:13,533
What really happened in college.
Do we know or are you calling sexual 

3559
02:30:16,491 --> 02:30:18,710
assault,
getting drunk and getting fucked because

3560
02:30:18,711 --> 02:30:21,230
that might have happened to cause that's
really acceptable to say today.

3561
02:30:21,290 --> 02:30:23,150
Yeah,
and that's disturbing as fuck man.

3562
02:30:23,180 --> 02:30:24,440
And look,
even if you were,

3563
02:30:24,470 --> 02:30:26,540
even if she was completely,
you know,

3564
02:30:26,541 --> 02:30:30,710
in like legitimately sexually assaulted,
not any of these bullshit gray areas,

3565
02:30:30,711 --> 02:30:32,210
like it was an actual sexual assault.

3566
02:30:32,480 --> 02:30:35,900
The idea that you would you like you're 
covering a sexual assault case.

3567
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:38,060
Okay.
And you were sexually assaulted before,

3568
02:30:38,120 --> 02:30:41,630
so right away what an honest journalist 
would do would be recused yourself.

3569
02:30:41,660 --> 02:30:42,493
You would go,
I can't really do this because I'm too 

3570
02:30:43,971 --> 02:30:46,670
emotionally invested in something that 
happened in my life.

3571
02:30:46,850 --> 02:30:49,040
But now to not do that,
you're covering this,

3572
02:30:49,100 --> 02:30:51,140
something that happened to you that you 
would have to be aware of.

3573
02:30:51,141 --> 02:30:54,080
I've got to make sure I don't let that 
creep into my professionalism.

3574
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:56,660
But you're using that to try to,
you know,

3575
02:30:56,720 --> 02:30:57,553
justify go after these guys.
And then after it's been proven that it 

3576
02:31:02,241 --> 02:31:03,530
was incorrect.
Well she did.

3577
02:31:03,531 --> 02:31:04,364
To her credit,
she did apologize once it was proven to 

3578
02:31:05,661 --> 02:31:06,620
be incorrect,
but still,

3579
02:31:06,621 --> 02:31:07,610
like you said,
that's not enough.

3580
02:31:07,611 --> 02:31:10,400
But didn't you say that in in the 
apology and the apology,

3581
02:31:10,401 --> 02:31:12,290
she was saying how she had been sexually
assaulted.

3582
02:31:12,710 --> 02:31:14,660
She was kind of using that as a,
as an excuse.

3583
02:31:15,050 --> 02:31:17,240
You can't do that.
It doesn't mean it doesn't mean anything

3584
02:31:17,241 --> 02:31:18,710
to these guys cause they didn't do 
anything.

3585
02:31:18,740 --> 02:31:19,860
So they're totally innocent.

3586
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:22,410
Those are someone's babies,
someone's babies,

3587
02:31:22,411 --> 02:31:25,560
young boys who grew up to be young men 
and they didn't do shit.

3588
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:30,120
And you are writing stories saying that 
they know what they did.

3589
02:31:30,121 --> 02:31:32,190
It's like if you were a therapist and 
you were,

3590
02:31:32,191 --> 02:31:33,024
you were seeing like some 16 year old 
kid and you told them to cut off all 

3591
02:31:35,101 --> 02:31:35,934
ties with their parents and then it 
turned out their parents were like 

3592
02:31:37,891 --> 02:31:39,510
really wonderful people and you're like,
you know,

3593
02:31:39,511 --> 02:31:41,670
part of it might've been that my parents
were really bad.

3594
02:31:41,790 --> 02:31:43,650
So I told them,
they're like,

3595
02:31:43,651 --> 02:31:45,960
well then you can't be a shrink anymore.
I don't know what to tell you,

3596
02:31:45,961 --> 02:31:47,880
but you're bad at your job.
Yeah.

3597
02:31:47,910 --> 02:31:49,530
Well that's cult tactics,
right?

3598
02:31:49,590 --> 02:31:52,650
There's one of the big things they do is
tell you to get away from your parents,

3599
02:31:52,980 --> 02:31:55,080
get away from your family.
That's a big one.

3600
02:31:55,140 --> 02:31:55,973
Which to be fair,
a lot of people's families probably 

3601
02:31:56,821 --> 02:31:57,990
suck,
so it's really easy.

3602
02:31:58,020 --> 02:31:59,010
Yeah,
it's easy.

3603
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:00,930
If you,
if you saw most of the people who end up

3604
02:32:00,931 --> 02:32:01,764
in cults,
I bet their families did really suck 

3605
02:32:03,721 --> 02:32:04,980
too.
They're lucky.

3606
02:32:05,040 --> 02:32:08,070
A lot of those people that are in calls,
they're lucky.

3607
02:32:08,071 --> 02:32:10,110
They're not sucking Dick for 
cheeseburger somewhere.

3608
02:32:10,111 --> 02:32:12,460
A lot of them are just morons like,
yes,

3609
02:32:12,690 --> 02:32:13,523
look,
there's a frequency that some people 

3610
02:32:14,731 --> 02:32:15,564
operate on.
It's really easy to fucking hijack 

3611
02:32:17,950 --> 02:32:18,783
their,
there's a lot of people out there that 

3612
02:32:19,411 --> 02:32:21,810
are just dumb and you're not going to 
fix that.

3613
02:32:21,811 --> 02:32:22,644
They're doll doll minded folk that 
really could be easily influenced and 

3614
02:32:26,161 --> 02:32:26,994
that's why democracy is such a fuck 
system to begin with because it's just 

3615
02:32:29,651 --> 02:32:30,484
play.
It's all everyone who's playing to that 

3616
02:32:31,801 --> 02:32:34,380
who can whip those people up and get on 
their frequency,

3617
02:32:34,590 --> 02:32:37,830
and then there's smart people that can 
be manipulated,

3618
02:32:37,950 --> 02:32:40,920
they can maybe manipulated once they 
attach themselves to an ideology.

3619
02:32:41,160 --> 02:32:41,993
Like we were talking about,
like people on the left that are 

3620
02:32:43,201 --> 02:32:44,940
avoiding all the craziness about 
Hillary.

3621
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:47,490
Like you had a quote that I really liked
that's on your twitter.

3622
02:32:47,910 --> 02:32:48,743
You know that if like Hillary was a man 
that had done the all the same things 

3623
02:32:52,501 --> 02:32:53,760
that she like,
what is the quote?

3624
02:32:53,761 --> 02:32:55,320
What does it your exact,
I see.

3625
02:32:55,321 --> 02:32:56,154
Like I said,
if hillary was a male republican with 

3626
02:32:58,801 --> 02:32:59,634
the exact same voting record,
all of her supporters would hate her 

3627
02:33:02,341 --> 02:33:03,390
with a passion.
Yeah,

3628
02:33:03,570 --> 02:33:04,980
it's true.
And it's 100% sure.

3629
02:33:04,981 --> 02:33:06,690
100% true.
I mean,

3630
02:33:06,691 --> 02:33:09,120
it's not,
this is not controversial in any way,

3631
02:33:09,360 --> 02:33:11,130
shape or form.
Hillary is is,

3632
02:33:11,131 --> 02:33:13,380
you know,
I mean in the stuff I was saying before,

3633
02:33:13,381 --> 02:33:15,960
but she's,
she's like courting the left.

3634
02:33:16,170 --> 02:33:19,020
She's courting people who are supposed 
to be liberals and you'll go,

3635
02:33:19,140 --> 02:33:22,320
she's supported every single war of my 
lifetime,

3636
02:33:22,770 --> 02:33:23,790
every single war.

3637
02:33:24,090 --> 02:33:25,800
Well,
nothing that they can get past that.

3638
02:33:25,830 --> 02:33:30,830
She didn't support gay marriage up until
2013 even their pet issues.

3639
02:33:31,250 --> 02:33:31,890
Yeah,
it's,

3640
02:33:31,890 --> 02:33:34,230
she's,
she's a weird one man.

3641
02:33:34,231 --> 02:33:36,120
She's a really,
really weird one.

3642
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:38,640
That fucking Libya thing.
We came,

3643
02:33:38,641 --> 02:33:42,560
we saw,
he died like,

3644
02:33:42,900 --> 02:33:45,510
that's okay.
Like are you kidding me?

3645
02:33:45,540 --> 02:33:46,800
What you remember when,
uh,

3646
02:33:46,870 --> 02:33:47,703
the fucking Vermont Guy Screamed?
I know we're going to go all the way 

3647
02:33:51,960 --> 02:33:55,190
Howard Dean and that one yell did men 
it,

3648
02:33:55,210 --> 02:33:56,550
that's it.
They saw it and they're like,

3649
02:33:56,551 --> 02:33:58,210
fuck this guy.
We,

3650
02:33:58,420 --> 02:34:00,990
we came,
we saw he died.

3651
02:34:01,030 --> 02:34:03,210
Ha ha ha.
Like that doesn't,

3652
02:34:03,240 --> 02:34:05,250
you don't think that lady is fucking 
crazy.

3653
02:34:06,330 --> 02:34:07,820
You don't think that lady's fucking 
cars.

3654
02:34:07,840 --> 02:34:09,060
I mean,
you're down for her.

3655
02:34:09,480 --> 02:34:12,600
That's,
that is a completely an ideology thing.

3656
02:34:12,800 --> 02:34:14,880
[inaudible] she's,
she's on your team.

3657
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:16,830
You're going to,
you're going to go along with it.

3658
02:34:16,831 --> 02:34:18,460
Just,
it's a religion just like you're,

3659
02:34:18,880 --> 02:34:22,300
you're subscribing to some predetermined
thing.

3660
02:34:22,480 --> 02:34:23,470
It says,
it's just,

3661
02:34:23,860 --> 02:34:25,900
it's weird for me to see,
first of all,

3662
02:34:25,901 --> 02:34:27,940
it's weird that she wants to be 
president.

3663
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:29,680
Like,
aren't you old?

3664
02:34:29,980 --> 02:34:32,290
Like you're an old lady.
How much energy do you have?

3665
02:34:32,291 --> 02:34:34,750
Got a ton of money.
You just had your first grandkid,

3666
02:34:34,751 --> 02:34:37,210
you got like perspective,
like what are you trying to do?

3667
02:34:37,211 --> 02:34:39,310
He's trying to make history as a woman.
Is that what it is?

3668
02:34:39,590 --> 02:34:40,423
I mean,
do you want to just like get back at 

3669
02:34:41,141 --> 02:34:44,750
your husband for getting his Dick Sucked
and in 1991 or whatever the fuck it was?

3670
02:34:44,800 --> 02:34:45,251
Yeah.
I mean,

3671
02:34:45,251 --> 02:34:46,750
I don't even think it's that.
I think it's,

3672
02:34:46,751 --> 02:34:47,561
it's,
I mean,

3673
02:34:47,561 --> 02:34:48,760
who knows who I,
you know,

3674
02:34:48,780 --> 02:34:49,613
I'm not in their head,
but I think these people are like power 

3675
02:34:52,841 --> 02:34:56,320
brokers that just want more and more of 
it and it's a real,

3676
02:34:56,430 --> 02:35:01,430
it is probably a thrill unlike anything 
we could imagine to have that much power

3677
02:35:03,940 --> 02:35:05,710
and they've,
they've tasted a little bit of that,

3678
02:35:05,740 --> 02:35:06,340
you know?

3679
02:35:06,340 --> 02:35:06,881
Yeah.
Just,

3680
02:35:06,881 --> 02:35:11,440
it seems to me that she's like so old,
but she would just want to chill,

3681
02:35:12,010 --> 02:35:14,260
you know?
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

3682
02:35:14,320 --> 02:35:16,030
She's,
she's an old lady.

3683
02:35:16,330 --> 02:35:18,070
Like she doesn't have good health.
I,

3684
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:19,510
that was the other thing that concerned 
with,

3685
02:35:19,540 --> 02:35:20,870
she had some health issues,
right?

3686
02:35:20,890 --> 02:35:22,750
I think she had like concussions or 
something.

3687
02:35:22,870 --> 02:35:23,780
Yeah,
there was,

3688
02:35:23,870 --> 02:35:25,990
it was hit in the head.
I forget what it was,

3689
02:35:25,991 --> 02:35:26,824
but it was when beat the fuck out of our
imagine that turns out the bill just 

3690
02:35:29,471 --> 02:35:31,990
wailed on her and she wants to keep it 
quiet.

3691
02:35:32,290 --> 02:35:35,710
Bill fucking Kot he had kicked her.
He's been accused of violence.

3692
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:36,633
Wow.
She has suffered from fainting spells 

3693
02:35:37,661 --> 02:35:41,320
since at least 2005 and that year she 
passed out,

3694
02:35:41,321 --> 02:35:42,154
presumably sober while giving a speech 
in 2012 she passed out yet again and 

3695
02:35:45,311 --> 02:35:47,770
suffered a concussion.
Holy Fuck.

3696
02:35:47,800 --> 02:35:50,620
Presumably sober is something that if 
they ever have to say it,

3697
02:35:50,621 --> 02:35:51,454
it's just not good.

3698
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:53,980
You got issues.
We're always presumably sober.

3699
02:35:54,570 --> 02:35:56,460
I'm not usually pursuing me,
but all right.

3700
02:35:56,470 --> 02:35:57,303
You know,
but this idea that she fell asleep and 

3701
02:36:00,101 --> 02:36:00,934
hit and hit her fucking head,
like when people fall and hit their 

3702
02:36:03,971 --> 02:36:04,804
head,
it's one of the worst things about 

3703
02:36:05,770 --> 02:36:07,900
getting knocked out is not getting 
punched in the head.

3704
02:36:08,170 --> 02:36:10,510
It's you falling down and getting hit in
the head with the earth,

3705
02:36:11,250 --> 02:36:13,480
like their,
their heads bounce off the ground.

3706
02:36:13,481 --> 02:36:15,550
That's like a big issue in street fights
and stuff.

3707
02:36:15,551 --> 02:36:17,020
When you watch someone get sucker 
punched,

3708
02:36:17,420 --> 02:36:20,020
they fall down and their head gets 
bounced off the curb.

3709
02:36:20,050 --> 02:36:22,240
And I think people who have like 
epilepsy and things like that,

3710
02:36:22,241 --> 02:36:23,074
like that's the big fear.
What happens is that that you end up 

3711
02:36:24,701 --> 02:36:28,900
cracking your head on the ground.
It's not just the seizure seizures.

3712
02:36:29,140 --> 02:36:30,790
Um,
yeah,

3713
02:36:30,880 --> 02:36:32,920
there's,
there's something,

3714
02:36:33,010 --> 02:36:35,260
I don't know,
Hillary Clinton said recently,

3715
02:36:35,510 --> 02:36:38,200
and this would probably be one of the 
tactics she tries to use against trump,

3716
02:36:38,201 --> 02:36:39,570
but she said something along the gut.

3717
02:36:39,570 --> 02:36:40,001
She goes,
you know,

3718
02:36:40,001 --> 02:36:40,834
I just,
I don't know if he's the type of guy we 

3719
02:36:42,311 --> 02:36:44,650
would want having control of the nuclear
codes.

3720
02:36:45,190 --> 02:36:46,023
And it's just like an interesting thing 
to look at what your like how crazy is 

3721
02:36:48,821 --> 02:36:51,640
it that any one person has control of 
those nuclear codes?

3722
02:36:51,641 --> 02:36:56,020
Like we're just counting on one person 
to not snap,

3723
02:36:56,170 --> 02:36:58,360
to not kill the whole world.
Yeah.

3724
02:36:58,361 --> 02:37:00,220
Hopefully you don't ever just like,
I've had enough.

3725
02:37:00,280 --> 02:37:02,350
I'm fucking right.
Well,

3726
02:37:02,351 --> 02:37:04,690
we know that people kill themselves.
Right?

3727
02:37:05,290 --> 02:37:06,123
That alone should just disqualified 
human beings from having that kind of 

3728
02:37:09,761 --> 02:37:10,594
power.
Are Human beings capable of killing 

3729
02:37:11,861 --> 02:37:12,694
people?
Yes.

3730
02:37:12,790 --> 02:37:13,930
For no reason.
Yes.

3731
02:37:14,170 --> 02:37:15,320
Randomly.
Yes.

3732
02:37:15,600 --> 02:37:16,433
Um,
what about killing themselves all the 

3733
02:37:17,211 --> 02:37:18,230
time?
How often?

3734
02:37:18,260 --> 02:37:19,490
Every day.
How many people?

3735
02:37:19,520 --> 02:37:20,690
A lot.
Oh,

3736
02:37:20,760 --> 02:37:24,800
well we can't have people run it.
So let's have a person who's,

3737
02:37:24,801 --> 02:37:27,170
uh,
a politician who's in the highest stress

3738
02:37:27,171 --> 02:37:27,470
job.

3739
02:37:27,470 --> 02:37:28,303
Imagine about,
let's have them just have control of 

3740
02:37:30,111 --> 02:37:31,280
those codes.
Unfortunately,

3741
02:37:31,281 --> 02:37:32,114
that is the green light for the robot 
overlords to take over because we can't 

3742
02:37:35,331 --> 02:37:36,350
trust people.
Will,

3743
02:37:36,351 --> 02:37:39,680
the robots are just going to be way more
sober about this.

3744
02:37:39,710 --> 02:37:40,543
They're going to make rational decisions
based on logic and mathematics and 

3745
02:37:44,390 --> 02:37:45,223
possibilities and probabilities and the 
understanding of human race that we 

3746
02:37:48,171 --> 02:37:50,240
really can't comprehend because we're 
just monkeys.

3747
02:37:50,320 --> 02:37:53,270
Is this when you brains,
you bring me into your giver society.

3748
02:37:54,380 --> 02:37:56,270
Now I'm gonna bring you to one of those 
landmark meetings.

3749
02:37:56,840 --> 02:37:58,700
It was landmark forum meetings.
Yeah.

3750
02:37:59,010 --> 02:38:01,510
Um,
I think that it's this entirely,

3751
02:38:01,720 --> 02:38:02,553
uh,
it's entirely possible that ai is going 

3752
02:38:05,331 --> 02:38:07,460
to be how we dictate government in the 
future.

3753
02:38:07,910 --> 02:38:08,743
Yeah.
Allen Iverson is going to rule out on 

3754
02:38:10,161 --> 02:38:13,880
the varsity basketball as well,
but they used to call them Ai.

3755
02:38:13,970 --> 02:38:15,240
Don't joke.
Uh,

3756
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:17,510
but yeah,
it is.

3757
02:38:17,590 --> 02:38:20,210
It does seem like that'd be an 
interesting tipping point.

3758
02:38:20,211 --> 02:38:21,044
I do feel like I'm more on the side of 
technology than on the side of being 

3759
02:38:23,931 --> 02:38:25,220
afraid of it.
Oh yeah,

3760
02:38:25,221 --> 02:38:26,054
me too.
I just feel like it's going to be more 

3761
02:38:26,691 --> 02:38:27,221
of a,
it's,

3762
02:38:27,221 --> 02:38:28,054
it's humans will be guiding it at least 
to a certain point and I think it's 

3763
02:38:32,961 --> 02:38:37,961
gonna make life a lot better.
I think we are some weird CNN enemy type

3764
02:38:38,361 --> 02:38:39,194
character,
some weird fucking primitive life form 

3765
02:38:42,110 --> 02:38:45,110
that has really kind of outdated and 
it's not going to,

3766
02:38:45,410 --> 02:38:46,243
we're not going to make it.
You think we're going to have to 

3767
02:38:47,930 --> 02:38:50,060
combine.
We're gonna symbiotic.

3768
02:38:50,180 --> 02:38:51,013
We're going to become symbiotic.
We're going to definitely have computer 

3769
02:38:53,541 --> 02:38:55,100
chips in.
Our brain will start off with.

3770
02:38:55,101 --> 02:38:58,100
You'll be able to store your memories 
and sharing with your grandchildren.

3771
02:38:58,101 --> 02:38:58,934
All we have to do is install this chip 
and then next thing you know we'll be 

3772
02:39:01,360 --> 02:39:06,050
get increase your vision with this 
retina implant and we can double your Iq

3773
02:39:06,051 --> 02:39:06,830
in three weeks.

3774
02:39:06,830 --> 02:39:08,720
Oh fucking sign me up.
But it's hard to say no,

3775
02:39:08,721 --> 02:39:09,554
no.
Well I know that your joints are 

3776
02:39:10,371 --> 02:39:11,660
bothering you,
Mr.

3777
02:39:11,660 --> 02:39:12,493
Wilson.
Let's replace your hips with artificial 

3778
02:39:13,221 --> 02:39:14,000
hips.
Oh,

3779
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:15,080
okay,
let's do it.

3780
02:39:15,110 --> 02:39:15,943
Okay,
now you've got artificial hips and 

3781
02:39:16,701 --> 02:39:17,534
you're like,
you know what?

3782
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:22,730
We found a new way to replicate the 
spine without any of the pain and issues

3783
02:39:23,060 --> 02:39:23,893
and uh,
we're just going to replace it all with 

3784
02:39:24,741 --> 02:39:26,330
Titanium and Oh,
okay,

3785
02:39:26,331 --> 02:39:28,160
well I'm in.
And then next thing you know,

3786
02:39:28,161 --> 02:39:28,731
your,
your,

3787
02:39:28,731 --> 02:39:30,050
your bones getting brittle,
sir,

3788
02:39:30,051 --> 02:39:30,980
you're getting old.
Well,

3789
02:39:30,981 --> 02:39:35,540
fortunately we figured out a brain 
transplant with a bio identical body.

3790
02:39:35,541 --> 02:39:36,374
We're going to take your brain and only 
be outside of your current body for 

3791
02:39:38,511 --> 02:39:40,160
three minutes.
Whoa,

3792
02:39:40,161 --> 02:39:41,090
hold on.
Okay,

3793
02:39:41,091 --> 02:39:42,650
what am I now?
Because I'm now,

3794
02:39:42,651 --> 02:39:43,484
I'm a brain inside a new body.
I don't want to do that surgery the 

3795
02:39:45,771 --> 02:39:47,270
first year they come out with it.

3796
02:39:47,300 --> 02:39:49,840
I want to wait like a few years,
let them work the kinks out.

3797
02:39:49,850 --> 02:39:52,220
No problem with that is those people 
that got,

3798
02:39:52,221 --> 02:39:53,054
at first we'll take over,
there'll be reading each other's minds 

3799
02:39:54,981 --> 02:39:55,814
and flying and breathing under water and
you just want to have a chance to 

3800
02:39:57,861 --> 02:39:58,850
compete.
Good.

3801
02:39:58,880 --> 02:40:00,350
Did,
they're going to gather up all the money

3802
02:40:00,351 --> 02:40:01,184
and the resources.
They're going to have all the hookers 

3803
02:40:02,540 --> 02:40:04,850
and then they don't even need hookers 
because they can get there.

3804
02:40:04,851 --> 02:40:05,684
I was going to say,
take an orgasm just by pressing their 

3805
02:40:06,891 --> 02:40:11,630
temple Jews in their pants for that.
That'll be a big turning point,

3806
02:40:11,631 --> 02:40:12,464
man.
If they can ever create a thing where 

3807
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:15,900
like our sexual desires are taken care 
of.

3808
02:40:16,020 --> 02:40:16,890
Oh yeah.
We don't need,

3809
02:40:16,980 --> 02:40:17,640
I mean,
yeah,

3810
02:40:17,640 --> 02:40:18,990
that's,
that'll be an interesting,

3811
02:40:18,991 --> 02:40:21,330
uh,
just fundamental change in humanity when

3812
02:40:21,331 --> 02:40:23,880
people get addicted to that and that's 
going to be a virtual reality thing,

3813
02:40:23,881 --> 02:40:24,714
but then it will be hollow because 
they're going to get addicted to it and 

3814
02:40:26,821 --> 02:40:28,200
they're not going to be any 
consequences.

3815
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:30,780
Like one of the things about sexual 
conquest,

3816
02:40:31,260 --> 02:40:35,100
I think it's one of the same things with
all sorts of uncertainty.

3817
02:40:35,220 --> 02:40:36,053
You never know how it's gonna turn out.
And so there's risk involved and it's 

3818
02:40:38,431 --> 02:40:41,880
scary and people get addicted to this 
risk.

3819
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:44,580
And even the risk of rejection,
I mean it's not like really scary,

3820
02:40:44,581 --> 02:40:46,950
like anything could go wrong,
but there's a game going on.

3821
02:40:46,951 --> 02:40:48,450
Like,
can I get these people to love me?

3822
02:40:48,660 --> 02:40:49,860
Like how do I get these people to want 
me?

3823
02:40:50,100 --> 02:40:50,933
Oh,
I got to have the right chains on the 

3824
02:40:52,411 --> 02:40:54,750
right car and show up at the right 
place.

3825
02:40:55,110 --> 02:40:55,943
And you know,
you need to get the right spot where 

3826
02:40:57,880 --> 02:40:58,713
there's a table service and you know,
I have to have a bunch of people that 

3827
02:41:01,261 --> 02:41:03,480
are famous around me so that I looked 
like a pimp.

3828
02:41:03,990 --> 02:41:04,823
You know what I mean?
Like there's the whole identity thing 

3829
02:41:06,121 --> 02:41:09,230
and then it validates your identity to 
get that check doesn't always work.

3830
02:41:09,230 --> 02:41:10,063
Some girls come up and like this mother 
fucker think he something and she walks 

3831
02:41:13,081 --> 02:41:15,060
off like that bitch.
She doesn't even know who I am,

3832
02:41:15,270 --> 02:41:15,681
you know?
And they,

3833
02:41:15,681 --> 02:41:18,660
they're trying to like figure out a way 
to become special.

3834
02:41:18,661 --> 02:41:20,910
Well if everybody just has to,
you know,

3835
02:41:20,911 --> 02:41:21,744
just download the fuck program and all 
of a sudden you're in an orgy with a 

3836
02:41:26,100 --> 02:41:27,510
hundred thousand tens all lining up to 
blow you.

3837
02:41:27,750 --> 02:41:31,140
Like where's the fun in that real,
but that's why the human,

3838
02:41:31,170 --> 02:41:33,060
the human experience works in strange 
ways.

3839
02:41:33,061 --> 02:41:34,770
So maybe then that's what we'll be 
attracted to.

3840
02:41:34,771 --> 02:41:35,251
Like,
you know,

3841
02:41:35,251 --> 02:41:37,650
people will want to go back toward kind 
of the thrill of the hunt.

3842
02:41:37,651 --> 02:41:38,820
He's like,
oh that's easy.

3843
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:42,360
I think it'll be more like a video game 
where video games are no fun.

3844
02:41:42,361 --> 02:41:44,160
If you get to play on God mode,
you know,

3845
02:41:44,161 --> 02:41:46,380
you play a video game on God mode,
he can't get shot.

3846
02:41:46,380 --> 02:41:48,450
You run around blowing everything away.
You when it's,

3847
02:41:48,451 --> 02:41:49,980
there's no thrill.
They're so easy.

3848
02:41:49,981 --> 02:41:51,890
It's no consequences.
The Allen,

3849
02:41:51,950 --> 02:41:53,160
uh,
Helena,

3850
02:41:53,190 --> 02:41:54,480
what's his name?
Alan Watts.

3851
02:41:55,060 --> 02:41:55,893
You ever hear that guy?
He's like a hippie short philosopher 

3852
02:41:57,190 --> 02:41:58,023
guys.
But he was saying like the idea of like 

3853
02:41:59,580 --> 02:42:01,950
that's why basically this dream that is 
life.

3854
02:42:01,951 --> 02:42:05,100
That's why it's like this.
Oh cause we were like all powerful.

3855
02:42:05,250 --> 02:42:07,380
But then we got to a point where that's 
no fun anymore.

3856
02:42:07,680 --> 02:42:09,510
So you want to like have life.
Yeah.

3857
02:42:09,511 --> 02:42:11,550
What was his quote?
He was talking about it game.

3858
02:42:11,690 --> 02:42:12,523
He was saying if you were going to 
construct a game about human 

3859
02:42:14,911 --> 02:42:16,800
civilization,
that's exactly what you can,

3860
02:42:16,830 --> 02:42:18,870
you would construct,
you would construct the game.

3861
02:42:18,871 --> 02:42:19,704
That's like what we're doing right now 
and this is exactly how a divine being 

3862
02:42:23,851 --> 02:42:25,110
would play.
Well he,

3863
02:42:25,140 --> 02:42:25,973
well the one I heard him,
he was like saying like almost like 

3864
02:42:27,330 --> 02:42:30,060
imagine like you've already lived 
through all those God mode games.

3865
02:42:30,060 --> 02:42:32,070
You've got bored of that.
That's why you're here.

3866
02:42:32,410 --> 02:42:32,881
Cause you're like,
yeah,

3867
02:42:32,881 --> 02:42:34,650
God mode is not that fun anymore.
Let's say,

3868
02:42:34,651 --> 02:42:35,484
you know,
try something that's a little bit of a 

3869
02:42:35,911 --> 02:42:36,910
challenge.
Yeah.

3870
02:42:37,020 --> 02:42:37,680
And this is,
you know,

3871
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:38,513
the level of challenge that you wanted.
Well it's an interesting philosophy and 

3872
02:42:41,421 --> 02:42:44,010
it's an interesting perspective but lots
of this shit,

3873
02:42:44,040 --> 02:42:46,590
you know like obviously we don't know 
exactly where this is going to go.

3874
02:42:46,591 --> 02:42:47,424
And you're,
you're talking like a little bit out 

3875
02:42:48,241 --> 02:42:49,860
there.
Not that this has even that far away.

3876
02:42:49,861 --> 02:42:53,730
I mean if you look at like a Nokia phone
was compared to where you know,

3877
02:42:53,731 --> 02:42:55,200
these things are,
I mean it's a,

3878
02:42:55,201 --> 02:42:58,110
it's a big difference.
It's not that far off into the future.

3879
02:42:58,111 --> 02:43:00,810
But even just little things like I 
personally,

3880
02:43:00,811 --> 02:43:01,644
I get really fascinated by what the 
implications towards government and how 

3881
02:43:03,871 --> 02:43:05,190
we organize society.

3882
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:06,113
So when something,
I mean we can just three d print guns 

3883
02:43:09,540 --> 02:43:10,373
and everybody can three d print a,
I mean we don't really need a fight 

3884
02:43:13,091 --> 02:43:15,670
about the second amendment anymore cause
you've got it.

3885
02:43:15,700 --> 02:43:17,950
Everyone's going to have a gun if they 
want to have a gun.

3886
02:43:18,130 --> 02:43:18,963
And I feel like there will be a lot of 
these types of things that just kind of 

3887
02:43:21,281 --> 02:43:22,114
know a fi a lot of government,
whether or not it's like it doesn't 

3888
02:43:25,151 --> 02:43:27,460
matter because people can just go over 
here and do it.

3889
02:43:27,461 --> 02:43:28,294
So we don't even need to have this 
debate which to meet should be the way 

3890
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:32,530
lots of things are settled.
Like,

3891
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:36,280
I mean who cares about debating over gay
marriage or something like that.

3892
02:43:36,281 --> 02:43:38,230
Like people associate,
however they want to associate.

3893
02:43:38,680 --> 02:43:39,513
That's one of those non issues that's an
issue to people that are actually are 

3894
02:43:42,851 --> 02:43:43,684
gay that want to get married,
but the reason why it gets bounced 

3895
02:43:45,251 --> 02:43:46,084
around,
I feel like it's like a beach ball at a 

3896
02:43:46,871 --> 02:43:47,704
concert.

3897
02:43:47,740 --> 02:43:48,573
They just chuck it out there.
Whenever there's like something really 

3898
02:43:51,161 --> 02:43:54,820
serious that people want to talk about,
they throw that around as if it's like,

3899
02:43:54,880 --> 02:43:56,440
oh,
this needs to be addressed as well.

3900
02:43:56,790 --> 02:43:59,920
Then it becomes a distraction and I 
think you're 100% right.

3901
02:43:59,921 --> 02:44:00,754
I think it gets used as a distraction.
I think it's also something where 

3902
02:44:03,190 --> 02:44:04,023
government,
it's search itself somewhere and then 

3903
02:44:06,040 --> 02:44:09,130
there's going to be a debate over it.
Whereas if government wasn't there,

3904
02:44:09,140 --> 02:44:11,020
we just wouldn't need to have any of 
this.

3905
02:44:11,021 --> 02:44:11,854
I mean,
why does it feel the same way about the 

3906
02:44:12,551 --> 02:44:13,990
women's bathroom thing?
Yes.

3907
02:44:14,260 --> 02:44:15,100
Yeah.
It just seems like,

3908
02:44:15,101 --> 02:44:15,934
come on man,
how many transgender people are really 

3909
02:44:17,591 --> 02:44:19,050
using these bathrooms?
Right?

3910
02:44:19,110 --> 02:44:19,943
Is this a giant issue and how has this 
issue been handed handled up until now 

3911
02:44:23,830 --> 02:44:24,663
and how has this issue being treated 
with more importance than so many real 

3912
02:44:27,941 --> 02:44:28,390
issues?

3913
02:44:28,390 --> 02:44:30,220
So one of the ones that I heard that was
brought up,

3914
02:44:30,221 --> 02:44:33,880
which is so bizarre,
is a man who was born a man,

3915
02:44:33,881 --> 02:44:36,220
he has a beard,
he does not take hormones,

3916
02:44:36,221 --> 02:44:38,380
but he identifies as a woman.
He wants to use the women's room.

3917
02:44:39,010 --> 02:44:41,770
He wants you to call him her and he has 
a beard.

3918
02:44:43,300 --> 02:44:44,560
Yeah,
I met a guy like that.

3919
02:44:45,680 --> 02:44:46,513
Fall Asleep.
You're not allowed to because when it 

3920
02:44:48,131 --> 02:44:50,500
comes to gender,
you can't be preposterous.

3921
02:44:50,610 --> 02:44:51,443
You,
if you think you're a fox and you want 

3922
02:44:52,741 --> 02:44:54,490
to wear a Fox hat,
I'm allowed to mock you.

3923
02:44:54,670 --> 02:44:57,400
But if you're a 50 year old dude with a 
beard and you have lipstick on,

3924
02:44:57,401 --> 02:44:59,800
you want to be called Z,
you're not allowed to say anything.

3925
02:45:00,250 --> 02:45:02,200
Now we're talking about gender,
completely healthy,

3926
02:45:02,201 --> 02:45:03,034
normal guy.
You fuck you and fuck everybody who 

3927
02:45:05,621 --> 02:45:06,454
thinks like that.
You guys are a bunch of little nonsense 

3928
02:45:08,441 --> 02:45:09,160
babies.

3929
02:45:09,160 --> 02:45:09,993
Yup.
And you're ruining the way people 

3930
02:45:11,291 --> 02:45:12,124
communicate.
What do we have left as comedians if a 

3931
02:45:14,111 --> 02:45:16,090
guy in a dress isn't funny.
Exactly.

3932
02:45:16,091 --> 02:45:17,200
I mean come on.
Yeah,

3933
02:45:17,201 --> 02:45:19,330
exactly.
That's a really important point.

3934
02:45:19,530 --> 02:45:20,860
Well,
my point is that,

3935
02:45:21,160 --> 02:45:21,993
you know what my,
I was furious when this Caitlyn Jenner 

3936
02:45:24,581 --> 02:45:25,480
thing was going on.
When you,

3937
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:28,480
you were supposed to say that she looks 
good.

3938
02:45:28,720 --> 02:45:30,310
Like no one was allowed to go.
Whoa,

3939
02:45:30,340 --> 02:45:31,360
Whoa,
whoa.

3940
02:45:31,690 --> 02:45:32,890
What the fuck?
Wait,

3941
02:45:32,891 --> 02:45:35,020
hold on.
Surgeries good now.

3942
02:45:35,260 --> 02:45:37,510
Like it's good to get your jaw shave 
down.

3943
02:45:37,540 --> 02:45:40,270
Everybody should celebrate that and say 
you look really good.

3944
02:45:40,510 --> 02:45:40,811
Like,
no,

3945
02:45:40,811 --> 02:45:41,644
she doesn't look good.
60 year old dudes and dresses almost 

3946
02:45:44,321 --> 02:45:45,940
never look really good.
Yeah.

3947
02:45:45,941 --> 02:45:47,550
Like even if,
if she was like,

3948
02:45:48,140 --> 02:45:52,030
if it was a chick at that age,
I probably wouldn't be talking about how

3949
02:45:52,031 --> 02:45:55,810
good she looks,
but you're telling me a dude in a dress,

3950
02:45:55,811 --> 02:45:56,644
those a dick.

3951
02:45:56,650 --> 02:45:58,480
Right.
But like had some stuff done to his face

3952
02:45:58,481 --> 02:46:00,110
and I have to pretend that's a hot chick
man.

3953
02:46:00,111 --> 02:46:01,720
Right.
Frozen face,

3954
02:46:01,840 --> 02:46:02,673
Weird Chin thing going on where they 
shaved his chin down or her chin down 

3955
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:07,870
and then gets a boob job.
Let me tell you something.

3956
02:46:07,871 --> 02:46:10,400
If you're a 60 year old and you get a 
boob job,

3957
02:46:10,520 --> 02:46:12,320
someone needs a fucking hug.
You okay?

3958
02:46:12,321 --> 02:46:13,730
Yes.
Relax.

3959
02:46:13,970 --> 02:46:17,060
If what if Hillary Clinton got a boob 
job and she just was like,

3960
02:46:17,061 --> 02:46:17,894
I want to show Donald Trump.
These babies are here to run the 

3961
02:46:20,661 --> 02:46:21,620
country.
Like,

3962
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:22,701
whoa.
I mean,

3963
02:46:22,701 --> 02:46:23,534
this is the,
this is literally what we're talking 

3964
02:46:24,411 --> 02:46:26,000
about.
I would like her billary Clinton is,

3965
02:46:26,380 --> 02:46:28,160
she's at a commensurate age,
right?

3966
02:46:28,400 --> 02:46:29,233
How old is she?
64 she's 70 she's close to 70 maybe 60 

3967
02:46:33,651 --> 02:46:34,484
how old is Bruce Jenner?
He's like 63 or [inaudible] 64 there in 

3968
02:46:37,881 --> 02:46:39,060
the fucking ballpark.
Yep.

3969
02:46:39,210 --> 02:46:41,780
There were in the ballpark.
So if Hillary all of a sudden got a boob

3970
02:46:41,781 --> 02:46:42,501
job,
everybody be like,

3971
02:46:42,501 --> 02:46:43,334
what the fuck is wrong with her?
But he gets a boob job and because it's 

3972
02:46:45,891 --> 02:46:46,724
about gender,
we're all supposed to just ignore the 

3973
02:46:48,771 --> 02:46:53,771
fact that he's got a frozen face.
That's the chins been cut with a fucking

3974
02:46:53,811 --> 02:46:56,990
grinder to resemble a female face.
Like what?

3975
02:46:57,200 --> 02:46:58,400
All things are Po,
what?

3976
02:46:58,520 --> 02:47:01,330
I don't think she's 68 then the same.
Yeah.

3977
02:47:01,340 --> 02:47:05,290
Same Dyke out Jesus Christ.
They're exactly that.

3978
02:47:05,291 --> 02:47:07,580
They could take out dairy.
He is good.

3979
02:47:07,610 --> 02:47:08,443
He's got a dick.
It'll scare the shit out of her as a 

3980
02:47:10,191 --> 02:47:11,024
dyke session.
You don't want him to show up that you 

3981
02:47:13,410 --> 02:47:14,490
shit Lord.
He's a shit.

3982
02:47:14,491 --> 02:47:15,420
Lord will.
Uh,

3983
02:47:15,530 --> 02:47:17,510
but look,
there is something also like the,

3984
02:47:17,511 --> 02:47:17,981
I,
I don't,

3985
02:47:17,981 --> 02:47:20,120
I'm not like a psychoanalyst.
I mean I don't know,

3986
02:47:20,121 --> 02:47:20,954
but are we just going to just because of
like this political pressure throw out 

3987
02:47:24,291 --> 02:47:28,940
the possibility that it,
it seems to say that maybe you have some

3988
02:47:28,941 --> 02:47:31,940
issues that you want to self mutilate 
yourself like this.

3989
02:47:31,940 --> 02:47:35,630
I mean like this is healthy behavior.
Whatever happened to loving yourself.

3990
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,480
Whatever's happened in loving yourself 
as who you are.

3991
02:47:38,780 --> 02:47:41,330
Like why,
why did that get distorted?

3992
02:47:41,630 --> 02:47:42,463
Like well,
how come surgery now is the viable 

3993
02:47:44,871 --> 02:47:45,704
alternative?
How come injecting a non in dodges 

3994
02:47:49,160 --> 02:47:50,870
hormones,
exogenous hormones,

3995
02:47:50,871 --> 02:47:53,630
female hormones into a male body?
How come you,

3996
02:47:53,631 --> 02:47:55,670
how come you have to say that that's a 
girl?

3997
02:47:55,671 --> 02:47:58,100
Why is gender such an important point to
you?

3998
02:47:58,130 --> 02:47:58,963
Like what,
what is it about this that's so 

3999
02:48:01,131 --> 02:48:01,964
important to you and to,
and to deny that gender and sex or are 

4000
02:48:07,361 --> 02:48:10,880
like biologically relevant,
you know,

4001
02:48:10,881 --> 02:48:14,840
categories that it's not just something 
randomly assigned at birth,

4002
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:15,381
right?
I mean,

4003
02:48:15,381 --> 02:48:17,750
okay.
For one that of 100,000

4004
02:48:17,751 --> 02:48:18,590
babies,
maybe it's,

4005
02:48:18,591 --> 02:48:19,424
it's something that's assigned at birth.
I know people always bring up that 

4006
02:48:20,781 --> 02:48:23,420
example where some babies aren't the 
number is,

4007
02:48:23,421 --> 02:48:24,790
but there's,
there's,

4008
02:48:24,890 --> 02:48:25,723
there's gotta be a lot of people where 
they feel like they're trapped in the 

4009
02:48:29,031 --> 02:48:30,440
body that they don't want to be in.

4010
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:31,760
And that's cool.
If you want to,

4011
02:48:31,761 --> 02:48:33,800
you want to,
I'm cool with sex changes.

4012
02:48:33,801 --> 02:48:35,000
I'm cool with everything.
I'm not,

4013
02:48:35,210 --> 02:48:37,160
I'm not trying to restrict people's 
behavior,

4014
02:48:37,430 --> 02:48:38,263
but there's something really weird,
I guess it's like an overreaction to 

4015
02:48:41,601 --> 02:48:42,434
people.
I think in a way it's probably a good 

4016
02:48:43,461 --> 02:48:45,260
thing.
So people trying to be more sensitive,

4017
02:48:45,440 --> 02:48:47,870
trying to be more open minded,
trying to be more accepting.

4018
02:48:47,871 --> 02:48:48,704
And that'll probably balance out.
Like we go way out to the left and then 

4019
02:48:52,071 --> 02:48:54,650
we'll come back more to the middle and 
everything will kind of balance it out.

4020
02:48:54,651 --> 02:48:55,484
And you'll see the difference between 
people that are people that are just 

4021
02:48:58,641 --> 02:48:59,474
like happier being a woman and then 
people that are out of their fucking 

4022
02:49:02,271 --> 02:49:03,104
mind.
Like there was a radio lab show about a 

4023
02:49:04,761 --> 02:49:07,590
guy who goes back and forth like he's a 
woman then he's a man,

4024
02:49:07,591 --> 02:49:08,424
he's a woman,
he's a man.

4025
02:49:08,430 --> 02:49:09,570
I just switched.
He's like,

4026
02:49:09,571 --> 02:49:12,480
I just switched over now I'm gail.
Like he becomes a woman.

4027
02:49:12,640 --> 02:49:13,141
Like,
wait,

4028
02:49:13,141 --> 02:49:13,974
you're just a woman now.
Like you were just a man now who am I 

4029
02:49:15,751 --> 02:49:17,220
talking to you now?
Now Mike,

4030
02:49:17,340 --> 02:49:19,320
Mike's back,
something's got it.

4031
02:49:20,020 --> 02:49:23,070
I see you're a fucking crazy person.
Look,

4032
02:49:23,071 --> 02:49:26,130
if that's not weird is anything weird?
Come on land,

4033
02:49:26,190 --> 02:49:28,230
but you don't.
But then people go well with his crazy,

4034
02:49:28,560 --> 02:49:29,393
you know what's crazy?
I agree with what you were saying that 

4035
02:49:30,541 --> 02:49:31,470
there is,
there is almost,

4036
02:49:31,471 --> 02:49:34,020
I feel like the general,
like there's a large group of people who

4037
02:49:34,021 --> 02:49:36,780
are just trying to kind of not be dicks.
Like you were saying like,

4038
02:49:36,781 --> 02:49:37,614
oh,
we're just trying to not be dicks to 

4039
02:49:38,101 --> 02:49:38,934
people so there'll be good.
But I feel like the people leading the 

4040
02:49:40,441 --> 02:49:45,441
charge are like trying to kind of wag 
their finger at someone.

4041
02:49:45,810 --> 02:49:46,860
Like they're trying to go like,
no,

4042
02:49:46,861 --> 02:49:48,530
see you're not tolerant.
I'm tolerant.

4043
02:49:48,531 --> 02:49:50,330
It's like you're not,
it's a virtue signaling.

4044
02:49:50,490 --> 02:49:53,100
That's what Michael Shermer calls it.
He's like,

4045
02:49:53,130 --> 02:49:57,480
you're trying to show yourself as to be 
more virtuous than the other people.

4046
02:49:57,630 --> 02:49:58,463
So you attack them for having a lack of 
a strong stance and these things that 

4047
02:50:02,461 --> 02:50:05,780
you have a strong stance in and so,
and even when he's strong stances,

4048
02:50:05,790 --> 02:50:08,970
like really debatable like this,
this whole subject,

4049
02:50:09,270 --> 02:50:10,103
you know,
and I'd love the fact that these guys 

4050
02:50:11,131 --> 02:50:13,080
kept getting busted after they pass 
these laws,

4051
02:50:13,260 --> 02:50:14,093
allowing men,
transgender women to use the women's 

4052
02:50:16,171 --> 02:50:18,390
room.
These creepy men were calling themselves

4053
02:50:18,391 --> 02:50:19,224
transgender and going into the,
well this is exactly what you knew was 

4054
02:50:20,971 --> 02:50:23,340
going to happen.
You knew it was going to happen.

4055
02:50:23,341 --> 02:50:24,450
Right?
Like,

4056
02:50:24,510 --> 02:50:27,330
look,
if you really want people to use a third

4057
02:50:27,331 --> 02:50:29,040
bathroom,
here's what you do.

4058
02:50:29,070 --> 02:50:30,960
Get the people that support that to fund
it,

4059
02:50:31,290 --> 02:50:33,120
get it,
get them to fund it across the board.

4060
02:50:33,121 --> 02:50:34,830
Everybody else fuck off.
Like,

4061
02:50:34,831 --> 02:50:36,480
how many people are we talking about 
here,

4062
02:50:36,481 --> 02:50:38,160
man,
that we need a third bathroom.

4063
02:50:38,161 --> 02:50:39,250
But that's,
that's why I,

4064
02:50:39,251 --> 02:50:40,084
I,
I hate the whole system of taxation and 

4065
02:50:41,431 --> 02:50:42,264
government and all this shit cause right
there that that can be applied to so 

4066
02:50:44,431 --> 02:50:45,500
many different things.
Right?

4067
02:50:45,520 --> 02:50:48,210
Like even if it's something like planned
parenthood or something like that,

4068
02:50:48,211 --> 02:50:49,040
like I'm,
I'm,

4069
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:50,460
uh,
you know,

4070
02:50:50,461 --> 02:50:51,294
I think it's a very complicated issue,
but I'd probably lean on the pro choice 

4071
02:50:52,861 --> 02:50:54,250
side.
Uh,

4072
02:50:54,330 --> 02:50:55,163
but it's like what you're going to force
someone who believes abortion is murder 

4073
02:50:59,610 --> 02:51:03,870
to fund a place that commits what they 
see as murder.

4074
02:51:04,050 --> 02:51:06,660
Why don't you liberals just get together
and fund it yourself?

4075
02:51:06,661 --> 02:51:07,494
Like why do you have to force all these 
other people to fund something that you 

4076
02:51:10,951 --> 02:51:13,550
deem to be a value that they don't 
write?

4077
02:51:13,560 --> 02:51:14,393
For sure.
That's debatable whether or not taxes 

4078
02:51:15,890 --> 02:51:17,720
should fund something like that.
Yeah,

4079
02:51:17,730 --> 02:51:18,563
I mean,
I don't even,

4080
02:51:18,630 --> 02:51:19,231
truthfully,
I mean,

4081
02:51:19,231 --> 02:51:20,850
I don't think it's the bit,
I think it shouldn't,

4082
02:51:20,851 --> 02:51:21,990
I think they shouldn't.
I agree.

4083
02:51:22,020 --> 02:51:24,060
No one should also things to fit if you 
believe in it.

4084
02:51:24,061 --> 02:51:24,894
Like you said,
you should fund it and it should be 

4085
02:51:26,101 --> 02:51:27,780
something that the community funds.
Sure.

4086
02:51:28,110 --> 02:51:28,651
I mean,
look,

4087
02:51:28,651 --> 02:51:29,484
as far as it was,
planned parenthood doesn't just provide 

4088
02:51:30,961 --> 02:51:33,390
abortions.
They also provide gynecological care.

4089
02:51:33,391 --> 02:51:35,370
They provide birth control.
There's like,

4090
02:51:35,371 --> 02:51:38,370
this is some really important parts of 
that,

4091
02:51:38,460 --> 02:51:41,460
but it just gets a lump.
They should have like abortions are us.

4092
02:51:41,790 --> 02:51:43,410
And then just like,
let's straight away,

4093
02:51:43,411 --> 02:51:46,230
there's no birth control here.
Our birth control is a vacuum.

4094
02:51:46,290 --> 02:51:47,610
That's it.
That's all we have,

4095
02:51:47,730 --> 02:51:48,450
isn't that,
that was,

4096
02:51:48,450 --> 02:51:50,890
you know,
I mean that's probably a,

4097
02:51:50,920 --> 02:51:52,290
that that would clear up this.

4098
02:51:52,290 --> 02:51:53,160
And then you'd say,
well,

4099
02:51:53,161 --> 02:51:55,500
maybe planned parenthood would be a 
different entity.

4100
02:51:55,680 --> 02:51:57,600
It'd be birth control,
things along those lines.

4101
02:51:57,601 --> 02:51:58,434
Well that as a responsible society,
it might be a good idea to invest a 

4102
02:52:01,531 --> 02:52:03,930
certain amount of money.
Reproductive healthcare like that.

4103
02:52:04,410 --> 02:52:05,243
That sounds smart.
And this is another thing that a 

4104
02:52:06,160 --> 02:52:07,630
technology might,
you know,

4105
02:52:07,690 --> 02:52:08,770
solve real quick.
I mean,

4106
02:52:08,771 --> 02:52:11,830
once we can kind of create womb light 
conditions outside the womb,

4107
02:52:11,831 --> 02:52:15,400
it might greatly cut down on the norm,
the number of abortions that are needed.

4108
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:16,353
Yeah.
That's where I'm gonna be real weird 

4109
02:52:17,470 --> 02:52:18,303
now.
That's going to be real weird when they 

4110
02:52:19,540 --> 02:52:23,560
decide that the the body,
like women can be far more productive if

4111
02:52:23,561 --> 02:52:26,760
their baby is born outside of the body.
Yeah.

4112
02:52:26,761 --> 02:52:28,690
But they'll always be like a natural 
movement.

4113
02:52:29,350 --> 02:52:30,183
Of course.
They'll always be like people who are 

4114
02:52:30,701 --> 02:52:31,090
like,
well no,

4115
02:52:31,090 --> 02:52:31,271
no,
no,

4116
02:52:31,271 --> 02:52:32,104
I don't want to do it that way.

4117
02:52:32,110 --> 02:52:34,640
Just even now there's people who have 
natural child and stuff,

4118
02:52:34,710 --> 02:52:36,880
you know?
It's like people like raw wood,

4119
02:52:36,881 --> 02:52:39,070
like this table and they're like 
handcrafted drinks.

4120
02:52:39,100 --> 02:52:39,933
They like,
like that word Mike drinkers were 

4121
02:52:41,141 --> 02:52:42,450
handcrafted.
Yeah.

4122
02:52:42,550 --> 02:52:46,840
I'm going to have a handcrafted hotdog 
and even just even just enjoying nature,

4123
02:52:47,110 --> 02:52:47,943
you know what I mean?
Like the fact that we'd like to go out 

4124
02:52:48,930 --> 02:52:49,763
into nature,
like we're so far removed with all this 

4125
02:52:51,131 --> 02:52:52,300
technology,
but we still want to like,

4126
02:52:52,420 --> 02:52:53,253
well I want to like I want to sit in the
place where I would have died from an 

4127
02:52:55,841 --> 02:52:58,360
infection at 12 I don't want to like 
live there,

4128
02:52:58,361 --> 02:53:00,550
but I want to like sit there for a 
little and then go inside.

4129
02:53:00,580 --> 02:53:03,040
I want to lay motionless where the 
predators used to Rome.

4130
02:53:06,510 --> 02:53:09,970
It is fucking really weird that we call 
it the outdoors.

4131
02:53:10,450 --> 02:53:12,010
Like I liked the outdoors.
No,

4132
02:53:12,011 --> 02:53:14,830
you mean the earth.
You like the actual earth.

4133
02:53:14,980 --> 02:53:15,813
We're just,
we're so fucking into being in these 

4134
02:53:20,770 --> 02:53:24,400
structures that that's our standard 
place to be.

4135
02:53:24,710 --> 02:53:27,580
The outdoors is rare.
I liked the great outdoors.

4136
02:53:27,820 --> 02:53:29,980
Like what do you,
what the fuck are you talking about?

4137
02:53:30,310 --> 02:53:31,390
How can you,
like,

4138
02:53:31,420 --> 02:53:35,110
we're defining ourselves by the inside 
of this structure primarily.

4139
02:53:35,230 --> 02:53:36,370
This is,
it's all afterwards,

4140
02:53:36,371 --> 02:53:37,990
man.
We're all on this fucking,

4141
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:39,150
I love that.
Uh,

4142
02:53:39,150 --> 02:53:39,983
that bit you were doing the other night.
I don't want to like give out if it's 

4143
02:53:41,561 --> 02:53:42,394
new stuff you're working on,
but there's a thing about just like 

4144
02:53:43,211 --> 02:53:45,360
paranoia of pot being good.
Oh yeah.

4145
02:53:45,520 --> 02:53:46,690
Yeah.
We should,

4146
02:53:46,691 --> 02:53:47,800
I hope be paranoid.
I mean,

4147
02:53:47,840 --> 02:53:49,410
yeah.
Yeah.

4148
02:53:49,470 --> 02:53:50,080
Well,
there's,

4149
02:53:50,080 --> 02:53:50,913
there's some,
there's some reality to our life on a 

4150
02:53:53,801 --> 02:53:54,634
spinning ball that is regularly ignored,
but really fucking crazy when you stop 

4151
02:54:01,571 --> 02:54:02,404
and think about this,
the reality that we're in a convertible 

4152
02:54:05,280 --> 02:54:09,130
spaceship and you know,
we don't talk about that,

4153
02:54:09,250 --> 02:54:11,230
but we talk about all sorts of goofy 
shit.

4154
02:54:11,340 --> 02:54:12,173
We're,
we're literally spinning a thousand 

4155
02:54:13,960 --> 02:54:16,840
miles an hour in a circle hurling 
through infinity.

4156
02:54:16,900 --> 02:54:18,970
And the more we find out,
the weirder it gets,

4157
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:20,290
the weirder,
the more,

4158
02:54:20,350 --> 02:54:21,183
you know,
we think we know something and we're 

4159
02:54:22,211 --> 02:54:22,601
like,
okay,

4160
02:54:22,601 --> 02:54:24,460
this is what a black hole is.
And then we figure something out.

4161
02:54:24,461 --> 02:54:24,851
We go,
okay,

4162
02:54:24,851 --> 02:54:27,820
it's nothing like that.
It's a no,

4163
02:54:27,880 --> 02:54:28,713
and people get mad at Neil degrasse 
Tyson because he won't say he's an 

4164
02:54:30,341 --> 02:54:31,174
atheist.
I think that's another hilarious aspect 

4165
02:54:33,101 --> 02:54:36,920
of atheism is how tribal atheism is.
I'm been watching these,

4166
02:54:36,921 --> 02:54:37,754
his forum where these people are fucking
hurling the most disgusting and evil 

4167
02:54:42,131 --> 02:54:42,964
insults at Neil degrasse Tyson,
simply because he won't say he's an 

4168
02:54:46,571 --> 02:54:48,040
atheist.
He's open minded.

4169
02:54:48,310 --> 02:54:49,990
And in Neil's like a scientist,
you know,

4170
02:54:49,991 --> 02:54:50,824
he's like,
look,

4171
02:54:50,860 --> 02:54:52,780
you know,
I'm not a religious person,

4172
02:54:52,781 --> 02:54:55,840
but I'm not going to say there's no god.
Well,

4173
02:54:55,841 --> 02:54:56,230
why not?

4174
02:54:56,230 --> 02:54:57,063
Why wouldn't need not?
There's no fucking evidence that there 

4175
02:54:58,161 --> 02:54:58,991
is no god.
Well,

4176
02:54:58,991 --> 02:55:00,400
there's no evidence that there is a god.
Yeah.

4177
02:55:00,490 --> 02:55:01,323
That's what an agnostic is.
That's why I like identifying as 

4178
02:55:02,930 --> 02:55:03,591
agnostic.
Yeah,

4179
02:55:03,591 --> 02:55:06,020
because there's like this atheist as 
almost like built up.

4180
02:55:06,320 --> 02:55:07,700
They,
they're almost,

4181
02:55:07,750 --> 02:55:10,460
it's like so dogmatic and religious in 
their beliefs.

4182
02:55:10,461 --> 02:55:12,650
Like you have to believe in this.
There is nothing,

4183
02:55:13,190 --> 02:55:15,350
nothing happens after daddy would admit 
that there's nothing.

4184
02:55:15,351 --> 02:55:16,184
Dave admitting that there's nothing.
It's like maybe I don't know nothing to 

4185
02:55:19,640 --> 02:55:22,880
do mushrooms and tell me there's nothing
and that same,

4186
02:55:22,910 --> 02:55:26,300
that same person will completely agree 
with you when they're on mushrooms.

4187
02:55:26,310 --> 02:55:27,680
Then maybe when they were off they'll go
like,

4188
02:55:27,710 --> 02:55:28,660
eh,
it was just a month.

4189
02:55:28,730 --> 02:55:31,010
Ego will come back.
It's a whole explanation.

4190
02:55:31,011 --> 02:55:34,100
The visual Cortex is being affected by 
five,

4191
02:55:34,101 --> 02:55:34,940
four,
four,

4192
02:55:35,290 --> 02:55:38,040
four o'clock and I'm a field trip to 
mean.

4193
02:55:38,120 --> 02:55:39,830
Yeah.
Someone I remember arguing with him like

4194
02:55:39,831 --> 02:55:42,110
a hardcore atheist about this and they 
were like,

4195
02:55:42,130 --> 02:55:42,700
hey,
really dude,

4196
02:55:42,700 --> 02:55:44,630
that shit that goes on when you're on 
mushrooms,

4197
02:55:44,631 --> 02:55:46,280
it's just a chemical reaction.
You're like,

4198
02:55:46,281 --> 02:55:47,000
yes,
it is.

4199
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,100
So is every experience you've ever had 
in your life?

4200
02:55:49,120 --> 02:55:50,720
Yeah.
It's just the chemical reaction.

4201
02:55:50,940 --> 02:55:55,250
Your life is a chemical reaction,
so without the proper chemicals you,

4202
02:55:55,251 --> 02:55:58,070
your brain goes crazy.
You had hallucinations.

4203
02:55:58,340 --> 02:55:59,151
It's was like,
yeah,

4204
02:55:59,151 --> 02:56:01,970
you get depressed,
you get suicidal or you get euphoric.

4205
02:56:02,310 --> 02:56:04,190
What do you think?
MM MTMA is.

4206
02:56:04,191 --> 02:56:05,024
It's a chemical reaction,
but it's one that your brain already 

4207
02:56:07,281 --> 02:56:08,840
has.
It's already in there.

4208
02:56:08,960 --> 02:56:10,100
That's why it works.
Yup,

4209
02:56:10,670 --> 02:56:12,560
that's right.
And you're finding a way to kind of a,

4210
02:56:12,600 --> 02:56:17,510
to trigger to use their words to trigger
that reaction that just gets you into,

4211
02:56:17,630 --> 02:56:18,463
it's weird.
It gets you into something that you 

4212
02:56:19,101 --> 02:56:19,934
already knew.

4213
02:56:20,040 --> 02:56:22,310
It's not even like new information.
It's just like,

4214
02:56:22,311 --> 02:56:25,550
it's something you already knew that you
worked very hard to forget.

4215
02:56:26,920 --> 02:56:29,120
We're so weird.
People are so weird,

4216
02:56:29,390 --> 02:56:30,223
but it's cool.
It's cool that it's weird because like 

4217
02:56:31,940 --> 02:56:36,940
Allen Watson sang it makes it all fun.
It makes us game entirely exciting.

4218
02:56:37,670 --> 02:56:40,490
I'm fucking super pumped that this 
relations full of bullshit,

4219
02:56:41,420 --> 02:56:43,370
that this election and this,
this,

4220
02:56:43,400 --> 02:56:45,860
this way we're interacting with each 
other as all chaos.

4221
02:56:46,130 --> 02:56:46,910
Oh,
I like it.

4222
02:56:46,910 --> 02:56:47,743
I enjoy it.
I would find it info like w like if you 

4223
02:56:49,851 --> 02:56:51,680
look at trump and Bernie sanders,
like I don't,

4224
02:56:51,681 --> 02:56:53,150
I don't love either of them.
I've,

4225
02:56:53,151 --> 02:56:53,984
I've problems with everyone.
I think Hillary's the worst of the 

4226
02:56:55,221 --> 02:56:56,960
worst,
but I have problems with all of them.

4227
02:56:57,440 --> 02:56:58,273
But it's so,
it would be so much more depressing to 

4228
02:57:00,831 --> 02:57:05,831
me if just like Hillary and Jeb Bush had
just waltzed to the nomination.

4229
02:57:06,860 --> 02:57:07,693
It's like,
like if the general sentiment of the 

4230
02:57:08,601 --> 02:57:09,950
public was like,
we're happy,

4231
02:57:09,980 --> 02:57:12,770
we're cool with the establishment.
I love that people are,

4232
02:57:12,771 --> 02:57:15,740
are like had had it.
And I think it's a sign of the times.

4233
02:57:16,010 --> 02:57:18,020
And I think the Internet is also a big 
part of that.

4234
02:57:18,050 --> 02:57:18,883
I think people are just so much better 
informed than at any other time in the 

4235
02:57:21,801 --> 02:57:22,401
past.
Oh,

4236
02:57:22,401 --> 02:57:23,600
well for,
for us,

4237
02:57:23,601 --> 02:57:25,700
I mean for the,
for the libertarian movement,

4238
02:57:26,300 --> 02:57:29,360
like that's,
we wouldn't exist without the Internet.

4239
02:57:29,390 --> 02:57:33,920
So you clearly identify with a movement 
like Libertarians.

4240
02:57:33,921 --> 02:57:34,754
Is there anything about being a 
libertarian that you don't like were 

4241
02:57:36,441 --> 02:57:39,380
libertarians or into other libertarians?
Um,

4242
02:57:40,040 --> 02:57:40,880
sure.
I mean,

4243
02:57:40,881 --> 02:57:42,050
there's like,
there's,

4244
02:57:42,051 --> 02:57:42,884
there's personal things about different 
groups and then there's some groups of 

4245
02:57:44,931 --> 02:57:46,160
Libertarians that,
uh,

4246
02:57:46,520 --> 02:57:50,030
I genuinely don't identify with it all.
Like there's some,

4247
02:57:50,060 --> 02:57:50,893
some kind of like Republicans who will 
just kind of call themselves 

4248
02:57:53,480 --> 02:57:56,600
libertarians but are okay with like 
fighting wars and stuff like that.

4249
02:57:56,601 --> 02:57:58,210
So I don't like that.
Um,

4250
02:57:59,030 --> 02:58:02,130
libertarians can be kind of a weird 
group if you get

4251
02:58:02,130 --> 02:58:04,170
together and we'll just weird to be in a
group.

4252
02:58:04,320 --> 02:58:05,640
I mean,
our subgroups weird,

4253
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:07,170
but that's why I don't,
you know,

4254
02:58:07,200 --> 02:58:10,860
I wouldn't be comfortable almost 
identifying with any other group to meet

4255
02:58:10,980 --> 02:58:14,580
the libertarianism or volunteerism is 
really just a,

4256
02:58:14,910 --> 02:58:17,460
it's like accepting of a principle that 
is,

4257
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:18,420
like I said before,
like you,

4258
02:58:18,421 --> 02:58:19,290
you,
you shouldn't,

4259
02:58:19,320 --> 02:58:20,153
uh,
initiate violence against peaceful 

4260
02:58:22,021 --> 02:58:23,220
people.
So I just,

4261
02:58:23,221 --> 02:58:24,054
I,
I'm okay with accepting that as like a 

4262
02:58:25,351 --> 02:58:26,184
fundamental truth to me.
It's more online with being like an 

4263
02:58:28,141 --> 02:58:30,090
abolitionist during slavery times.
It's just like,

4264
02:58:30,210 --> 02:58:32,720
we shouldn't have slavery.
What you do with yourself.

4265
02:58:32,760 --> 02:58:33,593
I don't know.
I'm not going to jump into a team of 

4266
02:58:34,471 --> 02:58:36,000
what job you should have.
Right,

4267
02:58:36,001 --> 02:58:37,470
but you shouldn't be forced to pick 
cotton.

4268
02:58:37,800 --> 02:58:38,251
Yeah,
no,

4269
02:58:38,251 --> 02:58:39,084
I mean,
and they're all the political 

4270
02:58:39,691 --> 02:58:42,440
ideologies,
all the political distinctions.

4271
02:58:42,450 --> 02:58:44,520
That's the one that makes the most sense
to me.

4272
02:58:45,090 --> 02:58:46,990
I don't call myself a libertarian.
I'm just sorry.

4273
02:58:47,010 --> 02:58:47,843
I feel like the whole,
the whole idea of representative 

4274
02:58:50,251 --> 02:58:51,084
government is so fucking goofy.
I just think that any political party 

4275
02:58:54,091 --> 02:58:56,690
that doesn't address that is,
it's like we're,

4276
02:58:56,691 --> 02:58:57,524
we're spinning our wheels.
If we're really allowing this whole 

4277
02:59:00,091 --> 02:59:03,450
stupid thing to go on the way it's gone 
on for so long,

4278
02:59:03,570 --> 02:59:06,360
it was created back when it was really 
impossible to communicate with people,

4279
02:59:06,540 --> 02:59:10,500
so you had to have a representative.
Like now it's really easy to communicate

4280
02:59:10,501 --> 02:59:11,334
with people,
but we have the same system of 

4281
02:59:12,811 --> 02:59:15,780
government that we had back when people 
used to write with feathers.

4282
02:59:15,840 --> 02:59:17,670
Right.
It's fucking stupid.

4283
02:59:17,760 --> 02:59:19,320
The idea of having a ruler,
it's,

4284
02:59:19,360 --> 02:59:21,090
it's insane.
It's so dumb.

4285
02:59:21,420 --> 02:59:24,780
And our robot overlords,
they're going to fix it.

4286
02:59:24,810 --> 02:59:26,190
They will.
They will liberate us.

4287
02:59:26,220 --> 02:59:27,300
They will.
They will rise.

4288
02:59:27,360 --> 02:59:27,900
They will fix it.

4289
02:59:27,900 --> 02:59:29,540
I'm really hoping they're libertarian.
Jamie,

4290
02:59:29,590 --> 02:59:30,423
don't we wrap this up?
You were trying to show me something 

4291
02:59:31,261 --> 02:59:32,094
else.
Is there something else that was going 

4292
02:59:32,401 --> 02:59:33,300
on?
There's no other story.

4293
02:59:33,330 --> 02:59:35,340
Just the Kimbo slice thing didn't.
Yeah.

4294
02:59:35,410 --> 02:59:37,050
All right dave,
this was fun.

4295
02:59:37,080 --> 02:59:38,700
I really enjoy this,
this more often.

4296
02:59:38,701 --> 02:59:39,534
When you,
when you back in town and when can 

4297
02:59:40,261 --> 02:59:42,690
people come see your standup and where 
can they find out about you?

4298
02:59:42,840 --> 02:59:44,790
Uh,
well you follow me on twitter at comic.

4299
02:59:44,791 --> 02:59:45,624

4300
02:59:47,821 --> 02:59:48,654

4301
02:59:49,711 --> 02:59:50,544
stuff and libertarianism.
