1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,171
My day,

2
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:06,150
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day about
what the fuck are you talking about?

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,680
[inaudible] today you were dropping some
knowledge on me about some gem where

4
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:14,430
they're fighting the fucking
movie with a black dudes.

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,890
What's that movie that
the kid came on here?

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:17,850
Billy Corbin did.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,781
Oh,

8
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:19,470
dog fight.

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:19,741
Yeah.

10
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:21,210
And then when we told
them about dog fighting,

11
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:24,060
then you're talking about some gem and
you said you'd save it for the podcast.

12
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,470
This is what I was telling you.

13
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:30,060
Like do you know what happened with
Conor Mcgregor and Nate Diaz with the

14
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:30,380
bottles?

15
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,590
They threw water bottles,

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,270
plastic water bottles.

17
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:35,143
They got well,

18
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,960
well some of them might have
thrown a monster energy.

19
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:41,961
Can someone throw a cam said if it can
hit you or someone you care about that

20
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:44,040
would suck the water bottles.

21
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,350
Like come on anyway,

22
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,410
they got fined $150,000 and it should
definitely shouldn't fucking throw water

23
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,120
bottles.

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,953
Right.

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,580
So part of me is like,

26
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:59,160
well if they could
discourage throw water balls,

27
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:00,090
that shit stupid.

28
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,481
Right.

29
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:00,990
But,

30
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,880
but did the altercation,

31
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,810
the altercations,

32
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:05,130
probably good for business.

33
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,210
The altercation.

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,350
I mean I get excited.

35
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,010
I see Nate Diaz and Conor McGregor
screaming at each other cry ain't no fuck

36
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:11,844
you.

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,141
No fuck you.

38
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:13,974
Fuck you.

39
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,540
I can get crazy with each other.

40
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,740
It makes you excited.

41
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:18,690
And I think that
generates paper view buys.

42
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:19,790
I don't think Conor stupid.

43
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,120
I don't think Nate stupid.

44
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,640
I think they're smart and I think they
know what they're doing when it comes to

45
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:24,474
that kind of stuff.

46
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,310
So that's a part of the show.

47
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,940
I mean did he really think he was going
to hit him with that water bottle?

48
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,620
You know fucking Nate Diaz.

49
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:32,760
It's hard to hit him with a punch.

50
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,570
How the fuck are you going to hit him
with a water bottle that's coming from 300

51
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:36,990
feet away?

52
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,010
He's not going to see that.

53
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,470
He's not going to move out of
the way of that water bottle.

54
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,701
You know?

55
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:46,701
I mean what they decide to get upset
about and what they don't decide to get

56
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:49,800
upset about is what's weird
about athletic commissions.

57
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,500
Yeah.

58
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,980
Like one of the things they were talking
about whether or not they were going to

59
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:57,870
test Nate for his vape pen
cause he had a CBD vape pen,

60
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,311
which is CBD,

61
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,144
not even,

62
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,410
not even psychoactive.

63
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:02,370
It doesn't make you high,

64
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,140
but it does alleviate some inflammation
and it provides people that have like,

65
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:07,980
you know,

66
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,400
back pain or something like that or
especially after a long fight provides you

67
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:12,390
with a little relief.

68
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,260
But what's crazy is the only reason
why they would want you to not do it,

69
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:20,850
obviously it's not performance enhancing.

70
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:22,140
You're not performing anymore.

71
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,280
The performance is over.

72
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,070
So are they protecting you from yourself?

73
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,090
Like what are they doing?

74
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,830
They don't want you to do
it because you're flaunting
the fact that you're doing

75
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:32,750
it in front of everybody.

76
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:37,590
Like they piss him after the CBD just
after he was smoking that I think he had

77
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,640
already done his post fight fighting.

78
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,270
I think you do that before
you do the press conference.

79
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:43,020
I think.

80
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,853
I don't know though.

81
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,693
It's a good question.

82
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,110
I'm not entirely sure.

83
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:48,810
And they might do it different way
differently in different places,

84
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,840
but either way you're
not concerned about him.

85
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:52,471
Like what do you,

86
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:52,770
what?

87
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,050
What's the issue like what is the issue?

88
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,480
It's just,

89
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,250
it looks bad.

90
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,780
Does it look bad that he's dead?

91
00:02:57,781 --> 00:02:58,680
Vapors coming out?

92
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,740
He's of dragons,

93
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,270
the CBD oil business.

94
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:02,200
We're not the roof then.

95
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,500
I'm sure it did and it
should and it should.

96
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,490
The roof and wait and wait
till it becomes illegal.

97
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,533
We're a month away.

98
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,800
When it becomes legal,

99
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,030
then it's really going to go nuts.

100
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,260
It's going to be good for everybody.

101
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,693
But anyway,

102
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,190
so they get fucking
pissed at them for that.

103
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,051
But the,

104
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:16,400
the,

105
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,233
the Connor,

106
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,970
the fine was so high.

107
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:21,640
I'm like $150,000 wow.

108
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,780
Oh he said he made 40 million next time
shut your mouth and they won't fucking

109
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:26,140
know.

110
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,710
That's true.

111
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,543
100 you know,

112
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,870
even the other kid made two,

113
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:29,560
three mil,

114
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,780
half of that after taxes,

115
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,330
1.5 on 50 don't really put a
dent in your fucking thing.

116
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,340
Next time you won't throw fucking bottles.

117
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,040
That is,

118
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,120
you got west state bowling.

119
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,730
Unless they both went to Dan and say,

120
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,573
listen,

121
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,150
this jacked up the things.

122
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:44,730
So I went to see him wanting to SAP UFC,

123
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,590
pick up the tab,

124
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,490
but then with 300 because
it came out of your fucking,

125
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:50,500
and for the paper views and something,

126
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:52,390
there's always one 50 is not that bad.

127
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,770
They walked away with a ton of loot.

128
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,731
It's a good point.

129
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:56,740
There's gotta be some
type of repercussion.

130
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,470
One 50 and they can
fight again in November.

131
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,220
Right.

132
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,790
Listen,

133
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,460
I got to court without a
license 10 15 years ago in la.

134
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,230
First time ever.

135
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,730
It was talking on the phone
and I got pulled over,

136
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:07,001
got goes,

137
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:07,834
where's your license?

138
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,920
It didn't work that day.

139
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,600
I went down to La County.

140
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,220
I stood in front of a judge,

141
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:13,054
my bipap,

142
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,860
the guy looked at me straight
in the face and she goes,

143
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:19,180
you could pay 200 and come back with your
license or give me fun 50 and I don't

144
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:20,014
want to see you again.

145
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,993
What do you think I did?

146
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,590
I gave him 200 and game five I gave him
five 50 and in time I got my license.

147
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,710
Not with a gun to my head.

148
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,783
Yeah.

149
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,960
Sometimes you pay a little extra
gonna let you fight Melvin Butler.

150
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,390
Now you earn next time and now you can
make up that one 50 you're earning at

151
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:40,430
least they're not suspend
it for fucking a year.

152
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,071
Yeah,

153
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:41,760
that's true.

154
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,060
Here's,

155
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,893
here's my thought,

156
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,420
but I don't think 150 is bad.

157
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:46,800
If you got a good charity for it,

158
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,420
the of the charity.

159
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:48,611
Yeah.

160
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:51,720
Instead of going to an athletic
department and what I mean,

161
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:51,931
yeah,

162
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:53,080
I'm sure he has a nice apartment.

163
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,780
His apartment somewhere be a girl's soccer
team or something like that for that

164
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,100
day.

165
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,850
That that's like a good thing.

166
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,390
Right.

167
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:03,120
But 300,000 into their pocket
is what pisses you off.

168
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:03,450
Wow.

169
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,450
See what they decide to get mad at and
what they don't decide to get mad at.

170
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,780
Because this is the thing that I found.

171
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,341
Do you know,

172
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:13,500
did you watch when Floyd
Mayweather was doing,

173
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:15,150
I believe it was for showtime.

174
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,690
They were doing one of those behind
the scenes things at his gym and um,

175
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,570
he has what he calls doghouse fights.

176
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,020
And I just,

177
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,110
let me just say that this kind of thing
has been going on in Jim's forever,

178
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:31,700
right?

179
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,700
They've always had gym wars
and people have even set up,

180
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,710
and this was a thing that I'm pretty sure
it became illegal in California fairly

181
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:41,371
recently,

182
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:42,750
within the last decade,

183
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,040
they stopped allowing people to have
what they call smokers and what a smoker

184
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:47,221
is.

185
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,810
They have organized fights.

186
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:49,770
Um,

187
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,280
but there's not really like
a lot of medical on hand.

188
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,210
They're only gets paid,

189
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,440
nobody gets paid.

190
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,000
But it gives people experience.

191
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,590
They used to have a lot of them and Moy,

192
00:05:59,591 --> 00:06:00,140
Tai,

193
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,190
like I used to go to them,

194
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:01,910
they were cool.

195
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,070
They would set up like these
little plastic lawn chairs,

196
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:05,630
you'd pay a small amount of money,

197
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:05,900
you know,

198
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,490
like 30 bucks or something like that.

199
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,770
And you'd go and you watch
all these amateur fights.

200
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:12,770
And a lot of times kids are pretty
fucking talented and it's fun to watch.

201
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,620
But so they've always had
organized chimp fights.

202
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,270
So essentially what Floyd
Mayweather did was have his own,

203
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,330
like in house Jim fights,

204
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:24,380
like amateur fights.

205
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:28,070
Like they didn't even disguise the
fact that it was a competition.

206
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:29,600
Like they weren't trying to,

207
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:30,434
uh,

208
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,120
they weren't trying to spar.

209
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,280
Like these guys are having fights

210
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,510
and he was talking about
how it's to the death.

211
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,710
It's really crazy.

212
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,490
And he has these guys,

213
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,640
one guy gets beat up and he's Huck Haseem
rock bonds brother or son seen Brock

214
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,401
months son.

215
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:53,234
I believe.

216
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,860
You see if you could save,

217
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,070
you can Google who the gentleman was
saying it was his brother but I was just

218
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,510
his brother.

219
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,470
Maybe it's his brother.

220
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,090
That makes more sense cause how seem
Rockmont is not that old to have a kid

221
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,700
that's that you know,

222
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:11,060
like that developed because he looks
like he's like in his twenties maybe.

223
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:11,510
Yes.

224
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,841
Anyway,

225
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:16,841
point being so this English guy beats up
Haseem Brock bonds one brother and then

226
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,300
the mom comes back with the bigger
brother and the English guy fights him too

227
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,110
all in the same day and they're fighting
like these 30 minute rounds just gets

228
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,133
crazy

229
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,391
cause you're a winner.

230
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:36,110
And the Lewis,

231
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,430
they put it on TV.

232
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:37,911
Yeah.

233
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:38,670
I mean dude,

234
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,351
there's definitely,

235
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:40,184
what are the losers?

236
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:41,523
I'm sorry,

237
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,351
the question was,

238
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:43,160
is that Jesus?

239
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,371
No,

240
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:44,240
I don't think there is.

241
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:44,451
I mean,

242
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:45,111
there might be,

243
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:45,351
I mean,

244
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:48,080
Floyd might reward them
or something like that,

245
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,120
but I mean it's,

246
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,350
it's crazy shit and I mean,

247
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:51,891
in one way,

248
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:52,191
yeah,

249
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:53,120
this'll develop,

250
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:54,200
develop character.

251
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,560
And I don't have a problem with people
doing whatever they decide to do.

252
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,400
If somebody wants a fight,

253
00:07:58,401 --> 00:07:59,330
a 30 minute fight,

254
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,820
I don't have a problem with that.

255
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,610
You should be able to
do it if you want to.

256
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,220
They've been doing this and
she's just love Chicago.

257
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,510
But the thing is in Boston,

258
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:09,560
when you do a brown belt,

259
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:09,951
yeah.

260
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:11,150
They way your buddy shoot that.

261
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:11,870
But,

262
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,360
um,

263
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,750
but the thing is I'm not
a promoter in Las Vegas.

264
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,020
Right.

265
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,831
That's a big difference.

266
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:16,700
It's a big difference.

267
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:19,760
And I'm not a professional
fighter on television.

268
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,550
I'm not,

269
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:21,891
so I'm,

270
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:22,221
you know,

271
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:22,461
I'm not,

272
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,400
and I'm not necessarily saying there's
anything wrong with what he did because

273
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,350
it is a part of gym culture.

274
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,600
It is a part of what's made champions.

275
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,000
I mean this kind of stuff,

276
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,391
these,

277
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:33,021
this heat,

278
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:38,021
these heated battles is this uncomfortable
reality that elite fighters like

279
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:42,500
Floyd Mayweather face
like to be that good,

280
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:44,180
you have to be that real.

281
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,630
And for a guy like him to show
like these kind of crazy 30 minute,

282
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:53,240
no time limit fights in
the gym and put it on TV,

283
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,800
it's pretty wild is in,

284
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,210
and I see both sides of it.

285
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,950
I totally see Floyd made
with the side of it.

286
00:08:58,951 --> 00:08:59,371
Look at him,

287
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,330
he feeds off that.

288
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,530
But guess what?

289
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:06,531
That mentality is why that motherfucker
was 49 and [inaudible] right?

290
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,910
That mother is arguably
the best box forever.

291
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:10,470
Who,

292
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,470
who got hurt less than Floyd Mayweather
who box people's face off that everybody

293
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:18,000
thought it was going to kill him
better than Floyd Mayweather.

294
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,120
Remember when he fought my Donna and
he found him the first time and um,

295
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,341
my,

296
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:26,520
Donna caught him in one of the exchanges
like right before the bell rang.

297
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:26,881
We were like,

298
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:27,714
whoa.

299
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,520
And then they fought again the second
time and he just put a clinic on my,

300
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:34,260
Donna just put a clinic on them.

301
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,350
It's like all of a sudden my Donald
was finding a totally different guy.

302
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,530
Like Floyd had figured out my Donna's
style or decided not to fuck around this

303
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:43,800
fight and decided,

304
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,221
you know,

305
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:45,540
to really take him seriously.

306
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,330
I'm really focused on him
and he just beat his ass.

307
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,890
He different things.

308
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,190
A lot of ways you don't agree
with a lot of this shit.

309
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,360
He does and you know,

310
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,800
but uh,

311
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,083
listen man,

312
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,950
his motion games off the charts,

313
00:09:58,951 --> 00:09:59,790
off the charts,

314
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,160
he's self promotion games
the greatest of all time.

315
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,390
He's my me more money.

316
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,310
He's made me laugh at night sometimes.

317
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,530
I've watched this show
and he's made me laugh.

318
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,860
And it that show you watch because
you don't really like the dude.

319
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:11,520
Yeah,

320
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,180
but you want,

321
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,661
I mean he,

322
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:13,494
you know,

323
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,940
I bet I would love him.

324
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,900
I Bet I would love it.

325
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,441
I would love him.

326
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:17,274
He's a psycho.

327
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,870
He wants to fight like three times.

328
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:19,141
I'm like,

329
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:21,180
you know what the proof was
in the motherfucking pudding.

330
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:21,991
Exactly.

331
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:22,530
That's it.

332
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,460
Exactly is in the pudding.

333
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:24,990
Let them do whatever the fuck he wants.

334
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,670
You don't,

335
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,110
you don't get a guy like that
unless he's a guy like that.

336
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:29,570
You don't get that 49 you know,

337
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,110
unless he's that kind of dude,

338
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,190
but I think he handles it as good as
any fucking human being that could be in

339
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:35,761
that position,

340
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:36,540
handles it.

341
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,020
It's a crazy position to be in to be a
young guy and be worth that much money.

342
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,760
And you'll know your nicknames.

343
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:42,061
Money.

344
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:42,894
Mayweather.

345
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,853
I mean

346
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,570
what the fuck names himself
money me and he's hilarious.

347
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,530
I ain't got nothing wrong with you
if you talk shit and back at yeah,

348
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:53,940
they need more exactly where I live.

349
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:54,990
You know what I'm reading right now.

350
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,640
A buddy of mine gave it to me,

351
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:58,440
Hollywood Henderson to
you old enough for that.

352
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,170
Hollywood Henderson was a Dallas Cowboy.

353
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:02,460
That was the real deal.

354
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,111
You understand me?

355
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:05,280
They don't even make them like that.

356
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:07,050
No one showed up rookie day.

357
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,970
I'll give you the article with three.

358
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:09,930
It's acid,

359
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,520
a gram of blow right here,

360
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:13,530
the thousand oaks and then the off season.

361
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:17,260
He would rent the hotel and hang out
with prior at the company store while he

362
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,740
would have the son was the
lab would point sisters.

363
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,060
This was before Rick James and before
they played the Denver Broncos in this

364
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:24,361
claim,

365
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:25,170
the fame,

366
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,170
he went on national TV and took a can
of orange crush with the Denver Broncos,

367
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:33,870
drank soda and he fucking crushed it
with the juice in it with one hand,

368
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,560
whoa.

369
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,393
And the Super Bowl,

370
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,600
he intercepted in score,

371
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:39,900
there's a line back and then he's
just fucking blew up the ball with big

372
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:40,734
fucking,

373
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,340
you know,

374
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,121
he talks shit.

375
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:42,520
People,

376
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,353
hey,

377
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,563
hey.

378
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,790
He talks shit on Game Day.

379
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,520
He showed up.

380
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,170
Then they threw him out because he put
fucking two fingers up during the game

381
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:54,580
and the owner of the cowboys
saw him at that time.

382
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,781
What's two fingers?

383
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,090
He can't do two fingers illusion on TV,

384
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,500
on national TV and Hollywood Henderson.

385
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,630
The camera came over and instead
of watching he advertised a towel.

386
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:05,911
He goes,

387
00:12:05,911 --> 00:12:06,160
Yo,

388
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,270
if you need these tiles,

389
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,140
and they were like the receivers company.

390
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,500
The next day Tom Landry
Find Hollywood have this.

391
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,030
Ah,

392
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,420
and after that it was all over.

393
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,740
He was smoking a fucking crack and
bazookas but he won the lottery in Texas.

394
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,550
They won the lottery,

395
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,910
became a born again Christian.

396
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,870
Oh my goodness.

397
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,190
Ah,

398
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,520
oh was my motherfucker dog.

399
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,413
Wow.

400
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,430
Well that's a fun story.

401
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,260
That's fine.

402
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,610
Yeah.

403
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:38,861
I mean,

404
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:42,940
I just want to be clear about all that
stuff that I was saying about the Floyd

405
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,390
Mayweather thing.

406
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,260
I just think that

407
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,410
athletic commissions,

408
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:47,981
you know,

409
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:51,220
like when they find people and when
they get mad at people for stuff,

410
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,860
it's like sometimes they,

411
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,230
they do it in a very heavy handed way,

412
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,090
and I think it's kind of obscene.

413
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,423
Like

414
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,100
[inaudible]

415
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:08,670
okay.
