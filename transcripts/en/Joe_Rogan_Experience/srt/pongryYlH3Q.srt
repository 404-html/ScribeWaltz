1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:08,160
Okay. Poor people on Twitter. I made them
wait for like five minutes with a lie.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,060
I said we were ready to go, but it really,
I was being optimistic. Brian Catlin,

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,770
I understand that you understand,

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,160
do you understand the pressure that
we're under this episode sponsored by

5
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:21,660
Squarespace. Squarespace is a website
that allows you to build your own, uh,

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,350
personal or business
website yourself easily. Um,

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,360
they have over 20 bad ass designs.
You can get a Giddy at 24,

8
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:34,320
seven support from super fast email
support that there like there if you,

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,720
you can't figure it out how to do it,
but it's really easy to do.

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,630
You're going to get it. I can get
it. Brian's done a million of them.

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,630
They have it set up so it looks
great on Ipad, android, iPhone,

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,610
everything.
I'm not even a tech guy and I use it.

13
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:51,430
It works because they sponsored my, yeah,
it's so, it's so easy to use. It's, it's,

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,860
it's like one of the coolest websites
ever as far as like a functional websites

15
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:59,040
for creating websites,
including um,

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,520
putting together a store and you can
put together an online store and like 10

17
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,670
clicks. It's, it's, it's stupid
easy. I don't know if it's 10 clicks,

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,340
don't hold me to that, but
you could figure it out. I'm
using it to set up my, or

19
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,340
they're so confident about it that they
let you try it before you even buy it.

20
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,480
So he can try their,

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,580
their website creating process and you
don't even have to enter a credit card.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,550
And then if you decide to use it, you
say, you know what I'm going to use?

23
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:26,820
This is going to be my website now.
Then you enter in your credit card,

24
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,860
you use the code Joe and the number eight
for the month of August and you'll get

25
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,310
a 10% is it September yet?
Shit, it is September.

26
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:39,750
It did become some stuff
like God, September 1st you
guys mess around day, dude,

27
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:43,380
it's September 2nd.
That's the second day to day,

28
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:45,510
but it's Labor Day so you
don't have to do shit. Yay.

29
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,750
That's you sound like an
awesome dude to run a house too.

30
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,630
Anyway. Uh, let's just go
with Joe nine then. Fuck it.

31
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,860
But either one of them work Joey or Joe
Nine. Either one will get you 10% off.

32
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,230
I think it's just for
their sake monitoring.

33
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,240
When you decided when my commercial
sucked at a certain point. Dot.

34
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,170
If two people that have to be like,
you know, you know he sent it in it in.

35
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,840
I know he has. I know he really
doesn't give a fuck about Squarespace.

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,540
He said it too many times.
It can't mean anything anymore.

37
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,730
But one of the things we try to do on
the shows, anything that we advertise,

38
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,190
we try to make sure it's legit.
Squarespace.

39
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,690
Squarespace seems very legit as far as
the responses we've gotten from people

40
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:31,620
that have tried it,
it's been overwhelmingly
positive. So I'm willing to,

41
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,783
I'm willing to back it.

42
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,180
I think it's a good product and it looked
pretty bad ass and Brian County uses

43
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:40,170
it as I do and Brian red bands made
like a hundred websites with it. Okay.

44
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,830
And we're also brought to you.
You is that still up?

45
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,280
Squirt Burt still up fears legs.
It's still up.

46
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,220
I'll get off and there's legs.
They sell anything at arch feels legs.

47
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,200
He should just be plastic.
Homer Simpson miles. That's it.

48
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,010
Deep inside joke.
We're also brought to

49
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,720
you by legal zoom. Legal Zoom is a website
that allows you to create your own, uh,

50
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,500
I shouldn't say create your own legal
documents, but fill out legal documents.

51
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,090
Things like an LLC you can do for $99.
That's what it starts at.

52
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,580
You can incorporate or form an LLC without
going to a lawyer and paying a lot of

53
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:21,670
money. He could do it naked. That's
what I've been trying to promote.

54
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,730
People masturbating while
using legal zoom. I mean,

55
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:28,030
I really want you to proofread, so go over
your stuff. Make sure he got it right,

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,550
but as you can,

57
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,060
if I could prove that more people use
legal zoom from my website because of them

58
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:37,420
being naked, take pictures. It's the
government's looking at you, man.

59
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,580
They're looking at you right to
that camera. That's what I hear.

60
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,400
That little camera right there. And I
was everywhere. I just turn them on.

61
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,420
I had a porn lawyer, this guy had
on my podcast say that, uh, he,

62
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,750
he wouldn't do any of those chat rooms
or anything because those cameras are

63
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:53,950
working at somebodies recording.
I'm sure at this point the, the,

64
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:57,950
the ship has sailed. Yeah. It's ship
has sailed. You know, if you're,

65
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,720
if you're beaten off, someone's got
a video of it, there's no doubt.

66
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,070
So, um, that's all going to come out in
the wash. But the reality is if you, um,

67
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,760
if you want to save money and get
some shit done, like writing a will,

68
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,900
it's very easy to do.

69
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,370
Legal Zoom can also connect you with
an independent attorney if you panic.

70
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,070
Like if you get in the middle of that
Shit and you're filling out forms or like

71
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,860
I'm going to go to jail,
he may have be me too. Um,

72
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,580
um, yeah. It's funny how we have blind
spots to that stuff. Big Law, legal stuff,

73
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:35,530
financial stuff. Why we have massive
add my friend, massive add can't.

74
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,480
There's certain things you can talk
about me and just start talking about

75
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:39,720
options and swaps.
I'm like Greek.

76
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,580
It sounds like great walking away
from you right now. I taught the crazy

77
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,910
swaps like wife swaps.
Wild that that too,

78
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:52,730
but that makes me panic and dude willing
to swap wives. You don't want that one.

79
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,590
I know what I'm saying.
He's given us taller.

80
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,550
Do you think that like
when you get older though,

81
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,420
that's actually just something you do?
Sure.

82
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,060
Like when you were like 60 70 like you
just start swapping wives when we've

83
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,210
discussed this before. When you're 60 or
70 go walk down the beach, go fishing.

84
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,720
Your time is over. Nobody wants to
fuck you. Even if they do, fuck you.

85
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:14,890
It's going to be a disaster.

86
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,710
You know they're going to look at
you while you're fucking them and go.

87
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:21,730
All marks the hardest I've ever
laughed and my life was watching.

88
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:26,731
You do stand up on what it's like for
those girls to have sex with with you.

89
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:30,850
Half of it was like they're lucky.
They're lucky, lucky, lucky.

90
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,800
Please don't paraphrase.
It says zero to do with legal.

91
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:39,940
zoom.com has a great fit. Have you done
that recently? No, I can't do it anymore.

92
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:44,320
It's over. I don't feel that way anymore.
Anyway. Legal Zoom is not a law form.

93
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,790
They provide self help service
at your specific discretion.

94
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,470
What direction? You said La Forum
Forum Forum. It's not a forum.

95
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,350
It's a forum or a form or a a
legal zoom is not a law firm.

96
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,920
It's a weird word from it means so many
different things like a group of people

97
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:05,440
and like a nice ass.
Why?

98
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,670
It's also not something you could really
describe what man as as a straight man

99
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,050
you can't be like,
you know it's from from guy.

100
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,410
What's kind of bond a
things like a firm look,

101
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,080
you know a guy can give you a firm look.
Yeah,

102
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,600
firm handshake do with touching. So
that's the thing. Like he can't be like,

103
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:27,260
he's very firm. Right? But isn't it
weird? We also use law firm for that.

104
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,520
It's we're, we're like, why did we run out
of fucking words for Shit? I don't know.

105
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,060
He say he's from on the
price is very flat price.

106
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,640
Why English is like one of the most
difficult languages to learn actually.

107
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,150
Apparently it is.
Yeah.

108
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,950
That's what keeps us stupid
and preoccupied trying to
figure out our language.

109
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,750
Anyway, go to legal zoom.com use a
codeword Rogan. Save yourself some money.

110
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,530
It's a an excellent service. I highly
recommend it. There's a lot of shit.

111
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:53,780
Uncle creepy is going to try to do his,
it's Ian Mccall.

112
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,470
UFC fighters going to try and do is
divorce through illegal zoom. Really?

113
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,380
I hope he's getting a sponsor for that.
They don't see,

114
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:02,330
it's not a law firm though,
so I don't know.

115
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,760
I mean they could probably
like give it to them for free.

116
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:08,750
I think that's the issue is like
they can't do it for him. Yeah. Yeah.

117
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:13,700
He's going to have to do himself. Not
me. I came gave away your whole house.

118
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,440
I marked 100% not 50% yeah, dude,

119
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,900
it's legal and some of the,
I've,

120
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:23,810
I've read some legal things before
and it's like, oh no wonder why.

121
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,150
There's debates on
interpretations of some things.

122
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,000
The other thing that I think about is
like if you ever sign a tax return or you

123
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:33,740
buy a house or something or, or a car.
I just signed, I'm not reading anything.

124
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:38,440
I'm literally like, what? Okay, sign here.
Just sign this release. I know. Yeah,

125
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,530
it's sweet. It's sweet. It says
you're a sweetie or sweets.

126
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,950
Who would be nice to each
other anyway, legal, zoom.com
code name, Rogan. God. Tim,

127
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:47,540
he's a taking a lot longer
than I wanted them to.

128
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,910
I was trying to get through a quick
today, a g, g plus Mu. Anyway,

129
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:57,440
this episode is also brought to
by a on it.com o. N. N. I. T.

130
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,470
We have the newest kettle bells in
and our primal kettle bell series.

131
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:01,610
It's a rang a Tang.

132
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,620
It's a 1.5 pooed Aubrey promises.

133
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:10,240
We're going to put the weights. Any
stupid things? Yeah. What is it? Food?

134
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,590
Is it a [inaudible]?

135
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,730
So rush should method of a measurement
and old school method like stone for,

136
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,870
you know, for English. English stone
is, what is it? 13 pounds, 14 pounds.

137
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:26,450
Pooed I think one Puente is 35 pounds.
So two pood is 70.

138
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,340
And what would that make? One and a half
pooed it's 54. Is that what it is? Yeah,

139
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,040
but that's not an orangutan.
That's a chimp and I, and
I'm on a mountain gorilla.

140
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,970
No, no. There's a chimp,
a mountain gorilla,

141
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:38,550
an orangutan [inaudible]
tanks in the middle. That's,

142
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,010
that's just simply incorrect.
Just a wide face champion.

143
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,380
No, it's, if you had, if it
had color to it, it would
look like, so I'm going to say

144
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,970
they're all evenly balanced.

145
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:55,980
This is one of the most important
things about when decided to create

146
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,300
these things. The guy who
did them, I mean, I kind of
need to find out who it is,

147
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:04,780
who the actual artist is and credit
him because he's fucking amazing. Um,

148
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,120
I'm going to text RB
while the show's going.

149
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,500
Those are almost things you could have
like, you know, greeting your guests,

150
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,470
you know, on either side of
the door. Yeah. Yeah. Their
artwork, door weights there,

151
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,770
or artwork as much as they are.
That's why I wanted,

152
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,450
if I had to rob a house when I
saw those on the front porch,

153
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:25,470
I might choose another house
having a pit bull.

154
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:28,020
Maybe it's insecurity thing.
I can't just work out with weights.

155
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:32,230
I have to work out with weights that look
like gorillas. I want to scare bitch.

156
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,870
We sell uh,
all kinds of different shit.

157
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,310
I'm trying to write to a all
brewed right now. Who's the artist,

158
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,720
Bro?
Right now people are listening.

159
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,530
Go edit the shit out, bitch. Sorry,
I should have edited that out.

160
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,920
But uh, I had a text and a,
I'm not that good at texting.

161
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,980
I'm not that good at texting. I'm,
I'm a little annoyed and big, thick,

162
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:06,630
blonde thumbs. That's also a little
annoyed that after all these years, um,

163
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,610
my phone is trying to pretend
that I didn't say fucking yeah,

164
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,350
I know and I have to go back. I didn't
say duck going, you fucking change.

165
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,600
I wrote Af, you know, I wrote
out. Right. Why did they do that?

166
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,160
Because more people would,
we,

167
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,170
it can't assume that you're going to make
a swear because then what if it makes

168
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:27,400
that assumption and it makes a swear when
you meant to write, ducking, playing,

169
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,080
like you know, you were ducking, you
got fucking between dock. Whoa. Yeah.

170
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:35,320
It has to go with doc. Yeah.
That's a big difference.

171
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,380
Like you were ducking or you were
fucking like, did you see me? Why not?

172
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,470
One, you don't give a fuck face other you
get divorced or yeah. Or people panic.

173
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:48,120
Like was high.
She's a fuck.

174
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,980
Yeah. Anyway. Um, battle
ropes, kettlebells,

175
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,730
medicine balls,
all kinds of different shit.

176
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,590
That's all designed for
total human optimization.

177
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,010
That's the idea behind a lifting weights
with a w or things that would give you

178
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:07,930
functional strength.
It's very difficult stuff.

179
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:12,931
So I always recommend people start
out light and get some instruction.

180
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,060
If you can go to a professional
trainer or someone who's RKC certified,

181
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:21,550
preferably someone who really knows how
to do kettlebells and spend whenever

182
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:24,580
they charged, you know, like whatever
a session is and just like videotape.

183
00:11:24,581 --> 00:11:27,430
It is plenty of videos out there
that are really good as well.

184
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:30,110
We sell a couple of them
on on it. Uh, the um,

185
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,960
Keith Weber videos are excellent
extreme kettlebell cardio DVDs.

186
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:38,020
Just absolutely fantastic stuff.
And um,

187
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,310
but I think it's really important if
you've never lifted any weights before to

188
00:11:42,311 --> 00:11:44,830
have someone show you how to do
it correctly, start out light,

189
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,570
use good form and will, you'll get
real benefits for a health and fitness.

190
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,730
It's a,
it's great for functional strength.

191
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,830
Even if you're just talking
about like things around

192
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,800
plus it makes you look sexy as fuck. Can
I? Oh, thank you. [inaudible] for days.

193
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:03,330
I call him Joe shoulders
for days, Rogan. Um,

194
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,680
we also sell a bunch of different
vitamins and supplements.

195
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:10,030
Use a codename Rogan and you'll save
10% off any and all supplements.

196
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,580
I just did that.
I just changed that.

197
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:14,620
Pooed and the whole time
you were saying that,

198
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,870
I said that's how we need to fix
that. Easy. He probably hasn't,

199
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,020
you need to get website authors.

200
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,630
Can I take those kettle bells with me
when I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina.

201
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,930
Did there you son of a bear.
Good Nights.

202
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:35,020
Hi Charlie Goodnight's old school
comedy club right there. I'm excited.

203
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:39,000
That place has been around
for a long time. I loved that
place. The green room is,

204
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,970
you're in the way of all the waitresses.
No Green Room.

205
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,140
Like when you try to,

206
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,630
you have to like stand in this like little
box area that's near the waitresses.

207
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,410
So he's like, oh, excuse me,
sorry. And they're all like,

208
00:12:50,411 --> 00:12:54,550
we need 706 we need five over here.
Great Place.

209
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,090
Old School place tempered 12th,
13th 14th. Yeah. I love doc joint.

210
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,240
That's like a real one
of the last old school,

211
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,980
real comedy clubs in this country. I,
every time I could do it a club like that.

212
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:08,890
And I see they have an old school
club in Atlanta. There's another one,

213
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,940
xannies and Nash. There's another place
called [inaudible] in Santa San Jose.

214
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:16,360
I can't remember the name of it.
Um, ah, I wish I could remember it,

215
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,260
but it's the same thing.
Tiny place and all school.

216
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:25,060
I mean the woodcreeks. Yeah,
just, yeah, this, that's just
like Charlie goodnight's.

217
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,340
That's a great, great like
institution of a club. You know,

218
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,380
you're a skeptic.
I wonder if you took a,

219
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,690
the wood from an old comedy clubs had
been laughed. There was just, it did the,

220
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,850
absorbed all the waves of
laughter through the years.

221
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,840
What that would be different than say
the woods asked us actual on the actual

222
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,970
pod, Cuban music, which just get
to start. I should already start.

223
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,750
Let's go teaser question,
teaser question.

224
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,810
I dragged everything from on and on.

225
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,530
Experience.
Joe Rogan podcast.

226
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,850
Hello. My friends were talking
to, um, the Great Brian Cowen,

227
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,190
who'll be a Charlie goodnight's
this weekend in North Carolina.

228
00:14:09,191 --> 00:14:12,580
If you're listening to this live
or within the next couple of days.

229
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,730
And then we're also talking to the
Midwest. Midwest is a guy who, uh,

230
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,840
came onto my podcast or on my
television show rather than the Scifi,

231
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,210
uh, Joe Rogan questions, everything
where we, uh, wanted to discuss a,

232
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:27,190
a bunch of issues.

233
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,400
And then I found out that he has a website
that is devoted entirely to debunking

234
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:34,600
things.
I had known about your website before.

235
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:39,250
Contrail science as it contrasts
science.org or.com.com.

236
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,860
I read that. Write this down. Contrail
contrail science and it's very, uh,

237
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,430
it's very detailed and very easy.

238
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,060
The way it explains what
certain are misconstruing

239
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,240
for being poisonous spray that's coming
out of planes and what's actually an

240
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,640
effect of jet airplanes flying
through clouds and that explanation.

241
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:08,750
I remember reading that going,
oh, that totally makes sense.

242
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,490
Like I get it.

243
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,410
They're seeing it come out of the plane
and they think that this has never

244
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:19,880
happened before or that this is a, this
is a new thing. This is geoengineering.

245
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,220
They're spraying over ahead.
They're not telling us about it.

246
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:27,050
And the [inaudible] want to think that
it's a geoengineering that's like the big

247
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,490
one,
that they're geoengineering.

248
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,480
That's the main explanation that people

249
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,750
and what's geoengineering,
here's what's fucked,

250
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,620
what's fucked as they are, try
to cool the planet. I mean,

251
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:39,120
it's not that they're doing it on purpose,

252
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,690
but we are doing it by flying
and making those clouds.

253
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,210
It is geoengineering eyes.

254
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,820
And one of the things that I really
enjoy about what you're doing is that you

255
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:52,821
have a very specific sort of mandate and
the idea is to expose these silly ideas

256
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,810
so that you can concentrate on real ones.
You know?

257
00:15:57,811 --> 00:16:00,960
And when you were talking
about chem trails,

258
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,430
one of the things that really struck
me was that was that how much time and

259
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:10,431
effort is spent on things that can be
debunked and how they really just distract

260
00:16:11,581 --> 00:16:16,581
from things like the NSA tapping into
all your emails and being able to monitor

261
00:16:16,651 --> 00:16:18,770
anyone's phone if those
are like real issues.

262
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,280
Yeah. Like, and the people who are
into chem trails and things like that,

263
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,230
a lot of them are very
energetic people who yes,

264
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,230
they spend a lot of time doing this stuff
and they could be spending that time

265
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:30,340
on a,
on real issues.

266
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,430
Yeah.
And it's not that this is the big one,

267
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,760
it's not that no one has ever
experimented on the public before.

268
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,840
The fucking for sure they have.
We know about the Tuskegee experiment,

269
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,901
we know that they,

270
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,640
they sprayed that shit out of the
top of buildings in Saint Louis.

271
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,490
We know that they've experimented
with things that probably weren't the

272
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:50,050
healthiest for the population.

273
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,910
But when you start calling
everything you see in the clouds,

274
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,500
a conspiracy and everything,

275
00:16:56,501 --> 00:17:00,580
you see when a jet engine passes through
it without like really looking into the

276
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:05,470
possible details of it like that, it gets,
it gets to be almost like a religion.

277
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:05,800
It is.

278
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,330
Yeah. It is. Yeah. I think that that's,
you know, people, they have that same,

279
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,210
that faith basically, that, uh,

280
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,870
you know what they believe is correct and
they didn't actually need the evidence

281
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,440
to back that up. So if you're asked
them, you know, where's the evidence?

282
00:17:20,441 --> 00:17:24,430
They say it's obvious, and they just
say, look up at the sky. Uh, they, they,

283
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,280
you know, it's like people who
have religious experiences, they,

284
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,390
they pray to God and God tells
them that they are right. Uh,

285
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,960
people in the chem trail community,

286
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,800
a lot of people in the country
and community have this, this,

287
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:39,600
this religious sense of
being very, um, very, um,

288
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,850
sure about their ideas.

289
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:47,180
And they have basically gone
beyond evidence. Now the,

290
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,340
in the post evidence stage, a lot of
them about how, you know, the, the,

291
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,570
the time for proving chem trails
he's passed because, you know, we,

292
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,600
we know it's happening,
it's obvious.

293
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,950
So it's very difficult to
deal with those people to,

294
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,510
to talk to them because they don't
want to listen to the evidence that are

295
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,850
moving onto the next day.

296
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,210
Aren't you describing a fanatic
in a sense? I mean, well,

297
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,320
they are fanatical in their belief,
but the idea that there's no,

298
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,240
I can no longer be challenged. The, the,

299
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,330
the debate has been settled and now it's
just a question of whether you, you,

300
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,510
you are a convert or you are an enemy.
I mean, that's kind of the idea.

301
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,020
Yeah.
So for those type of people,

302
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:26,690
I tried to frame the discussion
a bit differently. Uh,

303
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,290
you need to ask them like what would be
the next stage and you're not going to

304
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,140
start shooting down planes or even
though some people do actually to to just

305
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,150
talk about shooting downplay.

306
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,280
And so I've got a whole long thread
on the forum of people who, you know,

307
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,070
say things like,
let's shoot him down.

308
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:44,270
There's people who actually do go out
with laser pointers and point them at the

309
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:45,370
planes that are chem trails.

310
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,020
Here's my problem with it all and this
is what really freaked me out. What,

311
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,240
where is,
where's their tipping point?

312
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,430
Like how far do you look into it before
you willing to resort to violence?

313
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,450
Like how much evidence are they
getting that that's what's happening?

314
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,830
There's a weird disconnect going on
here because if you were looking at the

315
00:19:06,831 --> 00:19:10,220
whole thing and if you looked at the
explanations and you looked at the

316
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:15,221
explanations where they're clearly
stating in mainstream news that there's,

317
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,950
there's artificial clouds
that are created by jets.

318
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,820
It's a part of the 2002
article on cnn.com.

319
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,370
And it's about after nine 11,

320
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:29,810
they measured the skies and they found
that the artificial clouds that are

321
00:19:29,811 --> 00:19:34,340
created by jets flying around all the
time that they actually were cooling the

322
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:39,230
planet, the planet got hotter like
a measurably hotter without that

323
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,560
during the day. It actually, uh,
well it, it's when that happened,

324
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:47,130
it to warmed up during the day and
killed down during the night. Uh, the,

325
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,780
the jets don't actually really do one
thing very much. They do in the day they,

326
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:56,460
uh, the, the controls or block the sun
and at night they block the heat leaving,

327
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:56,871
right?

328
00:19:56,871 --> 00:20:00,960
So the net result is a very slight
warming because there's more of an effect

329
00:20:00,961 --> 00:20:05,280
from the trapping of the thing at night.
So during the nine 11 shutdown, uh,

330
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,330
what was seen was there was, uh, an
increase in the range of temperatures.

331
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,580
So my, my point was that it is still
is a fascinating point of discussion.

332
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,360
Even if it's not chemicals
being sprayed from the sky,

333
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,760
even if it is this, not, excuse me,

334
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,440
even if it is not this
nefarious government scheme
to control the weather. Yeah,

335
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,490
it is still fascinating and because we're,

336
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:30,870
we're having an effect on the
environment by, by flying around period.

337
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,880
So in a sense the,

338
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:37,970
the idea behind chem trails like the
chem trail theorists and conspiracists,

339
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,670
the, what they're doing
is you're, you're, you're,

340
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,850
you have a real problem and you're
focusing on a fake ineffective problem and

341
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:51,070
the fake ineffective problem being
that they're spraying as to poison us,

342
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:55,660
they're causing more Johns
what an incredibly ineffective
program that would be.

343
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,480
Do you know how much money
the government is spending?

344
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,390
How would you even organize that in the
government as if you could keep that a

345
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:04,210
secret as if the US government could
keep something like that secret anyway.

346
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:09,160
I mean just stop and think about how
crazy it is that you would think that

347
00:21:09,161 --> 00:21:14,161
something which does such a shit
job is still going on as a program.

348
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:16,960
We're pretty goddamn healthy.
People are living longer than ever.

349
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,780
The cure cancers that used to
kill you just a few years ago.

350
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,600
It's like if you're taking care of
your body and you're eating healthy,

351
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:25,540
if you can afford to do that,
you can live pretty good right now.

352
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,090
Yeah, and that's one of the things
like with fluoride in the water,

353
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:30,040
people say Florida is
it's poisoning people,

354
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,640
but you know the water's being fluoridated
for for decades and there really

355
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:37,050
hasn't been any, any noticeable
differences in health of people.

356
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,320
That is Laurie and fluoride,

357
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:43,320
but there also hasn't been any evidence
to indicate that fluoride is good for,

358
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,020
for dental hygiene or anything.

359
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:49,370
It's a bit of a gps thing to like it
should be poured into the water period.

360
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:53,930
Right? If it's not aiding in, in
taking away anything dangerous

361
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,070
science. The fact that Florida
actually does retard tooth decay,

362
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,700
but I do not know if that's true
because the reason I say that is because

363
00:22:01,701 --> 00:22:04,730
they've done a lot of comparisons
between, the reason, first of all,

364
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:06,770
I think it was even
discovered was wasn't it?

365
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:10,370
There was a couple of towns in Colorado
where kids were just not getting

366
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,840
cavities. Well, what was going on?

367
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:15,410
They found that there were
a natural fluoride deposits
in there in the water and

368
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:17,710
it may have been, I think it
was Colorado. And then, uh,

369
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,120
then they started doing
things and scientist said yes.

370
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:25,121
In fact a fluoride ref makes it more
and more unlikely that you'll get tooth

371
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:30,500
decay and then they compared fluoride
this country with the countries overseas

372
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:33,910
that did not far dies. They're fluff
fluorinate or whatever the word is there,

373
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:36,430
their water. And there was
a market difference in, in

374
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,120
it is the science is real, that it
does actually prevents it. But it's,

375
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,910
it's kind of a more of a
broader demographic thing.

376
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:47,470
Like for the total population, does it
actually have a, a worthwhile effect?

377
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,240
Cause most people brush
their teeth nowadays with
fluoride toothpaste. Yeah. Uh,

378
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,460
and back in the olden days,
that wasn't a common thing,

379
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:57,040
especially with poor people.
And so the floor reduction programs,

380
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,940
but kind of aims more
at the poor people who,

381
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,890
who had poor dental hygiene and you know,

382
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,300
the middle classes and upper middle class,

383
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:06,100
it's people who had money and taught the
kids how to brush their teeth properly.

384
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,500
They didn't really benefit
from fluoridation at all.

385
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,920
And nowadays it's a lot more common
for people to be brushing their teeth.

386
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:14,820
So there's even less of a reason to do it.
But there still is the,

387
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,680
there's still a segments of the
population who don't have very good dental

388
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:20,500
hygiene who probably would benefit
from fluoridation, but you know,

389
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,940
it's like math.
And

390
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,860
so is it a necessary component for,

391
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:28,870
for dental hygiene or is it just that
hygiene is a necessary component.

392
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:32,320
And then if you were having a
person who's doing it today,

393
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,950
over the last x amount of years,
toothpaste has been fluoridated.

394
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,560
What s what sample study do you have
of people that are not using fluoride?

395
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,560
Uh, you know, as forward
it to the Amish, the Amish.

396
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,100
I may maybe like,

397
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,650
I'm, I have that Tom's of Maine,
I've had that stuff before.

398
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:51,530
It doesn't have Florida and it's pretty
good toothpaste, just because it kind of,

399
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:55,100
it kind of weirds me out that fluoride
is dangerous. I mean, you can't,

400
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,630
you can't have it enlarged psalms.

401
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:59,660
And obviously you could say that about
salt or a lot of other things as well.

402
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,990
But Florida doesn't seem to be like a
natural thing that we should consume.

403
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,880
I mean, is, is there, it
is a natural occurring, uh,

404
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,420
can be in the water.
All water,

405
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:15,650
like a natural spring water. It's
a mineral, isn't it? Or is it a,

406
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,250
yeah, something like that. So it comes
from that. If you die from fluoride,

407
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,960
you're pretty big pussy
though. What was the, uh,

408
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:26,390
the knock, the conspiracy theorists?
Maybe you can help us on this.

409
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,370
The conspiracy theory about it was a, that
it was created by the Nazis that they,

410
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:34,970
uh, it was a part of the
mind control effort to keep
people stupid. They, Florida,

411
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,040
Florida, the water, I mean,
the Internet was vetted on,

412
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,300
I have a lot of those people were
probably at apple were and et cetera.

413
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,000
We're doing, we're drinking
far. I like, I can't hear you.

414
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:47,720
Gotta you gotta look at the, yeah.
What's happened? How's it worked out?

415
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:50,660
People stupid it nowadays you might. Yeah.
A lot of people ask you to be noticed,

416
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:53,700
but yeah, Iq is and how
stupid. That's a terrible

417
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,140
thing.
I was thinking,

418
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:00,020
we don't realize how stupid people are
until you're running the stupid people,

419
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,690
because if you're a smart person,
he traveled in smart circles,

420
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:06,770
you can get really delusional if you live
in a nice town where people have their

421
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:10,370
shit together and you're,
you know, interacting with
pretty intelligent people.

422
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:14,000
You could forget that. Essentially this
parts of the world, parts of our country,

423
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:16,970
even that looked like an episode of
the walking dead. Yeah. You know,

424
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:17,830
and that's it.

425
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,800
I didn't even think of it as stupid
when I travel as much as you know,

426
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,920
we both travel a lot. I actually am
always amazed at how apathetic people are,

427
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,190
just how they just are not interested
in anything that they can't eat or touch

428
00:25:30,681 --> 00:25:32,300
or feel. There's no, there's no,

429
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,620
it doesn't always seem to be a lot
of imagination out there. Yeah.

430
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,620
There's a weirdness to this world that
we're living in right now where people

431
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,620
are looking to be distracted
more so than ever.

432
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,880
Partly partly because you can
distract yourself very effective. Yep,

433
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,791
that's true too.

434
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:50,570
But there's not that much of a push to
get the fuck away from it. You know?

435
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:53,840
I think that like,
it sounds crazy,

436
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:58,841
but I think that like if there's not some
sort of a push to get away from stupid

437
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,460
silly thinking,

438
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,850
it's really difficult to find
the motivation to take a,

439
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,890
I think human beings have always
done that when they had to write.

440
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,320
Think about how many inventions came out
of war out of the necessity of trying

441
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:15,320
to beat the other side. So you're not
specking said Dortch, et cetera. I mean,

442
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,110
a lot of, a lot of invent,
and correct me if I'm wrong,

443
00:26:18,111 --> 00:26:23,111
but a lot of technological advances were
a direct result of having to come up

444
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:25,970
with a solution to a problem or you know,

445
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,250
a very immediate problem in
the space program as well.

446
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,750
Basically came out of the Cold War.

447
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,430
It was this because we had this big
enemies that we had to fight. Two,

448
00:26:32,431 --> 00:26:35,330
you can pull this resources
into, you know, going to the
moon and stuff like that,

449
00:26:35,331 --> 00:26:38,640
which was completely unnecessary
thing. Um, but you know,

450
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,680
guests conflict is a big driving
force. Safety, safety and pleasure.

451
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,100
This is an interesting cavity.
Rates

452
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,480
declined in several cities that stopped
war. I'd flow water fluoridation,

453
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,250
new studies report contradicting
American dental association predictions

454
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:57,500
according to the fluoride action network,
by the way, who the who are the floor,

455
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,640
that's where the speed,

456
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:06,040
you're dedicating all your time to flora
obscure jobs as if this is a few fairly

457
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:11,760
serious people who don't
like the fluoridation thing.
Like actual scientists.

458
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,540
Yeah. Oh yes. That's the case behind
it. It's not this totally French thing,

459
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,580
but it becomes fringe when you get
into things like know the government is

460
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,360
adding it secretly.
So to brainwash people.

461
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,950
Or the other one that I've heard is that
the government added it because there

462
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:29,190
was some sort of a deal that they had
made with the producers of fluoride.

463
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,250
He's like less than say you're going
to dump this and I want to hear,

464
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,220
you're gonna pay us every year.
So you got to kick back,

465
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,320
you're going to kick back. Your kids are
going to kick back. But it's ridiculous.

466
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,180
It's a ridiculous theory.

467
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:41,670
But it sounds like got something
the government would do.

468
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,050
We're trying to get rid of toxic waste
and the only thing that could think of to

469
00:27:46,051 --> 00:27:49,290
do was to put it in the water supply.
Yeah. I mean, who gets rid of toxic waste?

470
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:50,580
But I didn't get to the water supply.

471
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,070
I think the company that makes toxic
wigs are in league with Satan. And uh,

472
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,480
so as the government that
allow this to happen,

473
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,860
they don't care that they're washing
their own bodies with this water and all

474
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,990
the elites, if they're spring water
shipped in from the center of the earth,

475
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,830
comes sterilized by the lava.
It's super delicious.

476
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,100
And once you vote Republican for 10
years in a row, they come to your house.

477
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,590
We'll give you the good water.

478
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,080
Got to Switzerland and they have
their blood to look clean. Yes.

479
00:28:17,081 --> 00:28:20,070
She got to go to Switzerland machines.
We'll see.

480
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:22,800
Do they do do some interesting
procedures overseas?

481
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,080
Do you know anything about
like those blood splinting,

482
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,200
spinning procedures are doing [inaudible]?

483
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,850
Isn't that platelet rich sort of
like that, but I guess it's not,

484
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,290
it's there's something more to it.

485
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,970
It's just not just platelet rich plasma
treatment, but there's added elements.

486
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,010
I have no idea.
I don't understand it,

487
00:28:38,011 --> 00:28:41,310
but all these athletes are having these
incredible results going over there.

488
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:45,360
Like Dana White, he cured his maneuvers
disease with one shot. He's really, yeah,

489
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:50,430
apparently a lot of diseases are based
on inflammation and what this stuff

490
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:51,330
essentially is.

491
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,360
What it creates is this super anti
inflammation agent that's made out of your

492
00:28:57,241 --> 00:29:00,690
own blood and I don't
understand the process at all,

493
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:05,810
but apparently during the
Bush administration it was
really difficult to do stem

494
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:08,160
cell research.
Difficult to,

495
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,160
difficult to get funding
for a lot of things.

496
00:29:11,161 --> 00:29:13,110
And if anything that involves stem cells,

497
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:18,140
even if it's like a tiny
fraction of a bunch of cells,

498
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:20,100
you know, like a hundred
cells or something like that.

499
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:22,890
Something so small you'd have to
look at under a microscope to see it.

500
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,930
So because of that,

501
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:28,920
I think Europe was allowed to experiment
with a lot of like really interesting

502
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:32,760
different methods for using
stem cells and, and different,

503
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,980
different treatments of using the
stuff that's made out of your own body,

504
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,070
like taking your blood and turning
it into Madison. It's really

505
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,903
kind of crazy.

506
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,390
The idea that inflammation is like the
cause of suddenly there was an article

507
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:48,580
recently in New York Times about
a guy with a physician who said,

508
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,850
why are we not telling people about
the benefits of low grid aspirin,

509
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:56,830
81 milligrams or something like that,
which apparently has a very, very,

510
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:01,810
uh, um, measurable results
in, in stopping things like,

511
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,100
uh, or at least retarding, uh,
things like colon cancer, even, uh,

512
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:10,780
all kinds of diseases because it,
it brings inflammation down in the body.

513
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,490
And uh, you know, just just look
right at Aspen. Listen Dude,

514
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:20,170
I'm reading Argo article right now
on wake up world.com, and it says,

515
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:25,230
prove to anyone that fluoride is bad
for you and dumbing society down.

516
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,310
Hmm.

517
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:30,640
Did you imagine if we found out that
our leaders were really pouring stuff in

518
00:30:30,641 --> 00:30:32,620
the water to try to make everybody dumb,

519
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,620
but let's say that we're the delusion
of ones and that these folks were all

520
00:30:35,621 --> 00:30:37,870
right and that is the elites.

521
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:42,670
They are not getting fluoride water and
they're just doing it to dumb people

522
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:44,950
down. That's the most extreme
of the theories, right? Yeah.

523
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:48,520
I guess just done at a local level though.
It's not even like a national thing.

524
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,440
The elites get a cut back.

525
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,710
When people use words like
the elite or the government,

526
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,920
the government's always changing and
there's so much infighting in the

527
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,290
government. A lot of times people
try to stab each other in the back.

528
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:03,060
It'd be hard to kind of get a one small
groups. The shelter, they also, yeah,

529
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:08,020
they also need funding. I
found the fluoride action
network, by the way, Joe. Nice.

530
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,680
Those guys look really happy.

531
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,010
That's one thing I always say when I
see a gay guys to get the Tilex so it

532
00:31:15,011 --> 00:31:19,120
happened like so happy. They look happy.
They're not conflicted at all. You know,

533
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:23,980
gay. They don't, they don't have
an issue of you being a woman.

534
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,740
They also get to hang with another dude.
How do you understand so well,

535
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,820
why is this guy in this guy? No,
he's too high. He's too tall. Look,

536
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:32,290
he's peeing on his jacket off.

537
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:36,260
He's using his butt cheeks to hold his
balls and bliss. If I had to guess weird,

538
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,490
if I had to go, I say fun. This, this, uh,

539
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,960
and then the second theory is that
there's some sort of a cover up going on

540
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:50,230
because they sell this, they have a
deal to sell this fluoride to the,

541
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,490
to the water people and the water people
put it in and this is kickback sort of

542
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:57,100
a deal. I've heard that
theory to, can you read that?

543
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,700
It's such a small amount of money in the
global scheme of things like poisoning

544
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:03,700
the, until I population just
to make like $1 billion.

545
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:08,470
Maybe he has one of those giant twisty
mustaches like Tait Fletcher is rocking

546
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:12,780
these days and he's really
just like a surfer dude.

547
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:17,270
Todd has the most glorious mustache. The
world has ever known. Fantastic things.

548
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,370
Everybody should have a mustache. Fuck
that guy. Should I love that too. Shit.

549
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,540
Toughest Shit.
Sweet and smart and and and very smart.

550
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:29,470
But he's a sweetie too. He's a really
nice guy. He's just a sandwich.

551
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,200
Maybe if he had fluoride in his water,
anything a little more calm.

552
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:38,590
I was going to say drinking too much
fucking spring water. That's what happens.

553
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,190
Peter though.
If you can put salt

554
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,230
Peter on the water and it actually
kills boners prison. Really?

555
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,360
This isn't that what they used to
give priests? There was, I don't know.

556
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:52,340
They said they gave her and I know they
use it and I, from my own understanding,

557
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,890
I guess I use it in prison.
The priest take that stuff the way,

558
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:58,430
like when you know a kidnappers trying
to drug a woman and she figures out a way

559
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:01,940
to put it under a tongue and a movie
and spit the medication away. Defiantly.

560
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,830
Yeah. That's how the priests take that.
Saul, Peter, I saw Peter Tapping. Yeah.

561
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,330
Who the fuck is going to take something
that kills your boners and people would

562
00:33:11,331 --> 00:33:15,230
theoretically, but when push came
to shove, they would go, wait, what?

563
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,500
What does it do? You know, you'd go, yeah,
I don't even want my sexuality anymore.

564
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:20,960
I'm done. I give up and then, okay,

565
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:24,570
well we're going to give you a pill that
kills it permanently. Forever. I got it.

566
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,960
I'll get to that pill. And
you go, wait, what happens?

567
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,960
I just sit on the couch all day.

568
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,540
What else is there to do?
My boner is what drives me everywhere.

569
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,390
Um, did you see any of, uh,
the, uh, Joe Rogan questions?

570
00:33:41,391 --> 00:33:46,070
Everything on, um, human
optimization on a transcendence?

571
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,880
No, that's the one I mentioned.
That's literally the best
one in my opinion. My, my,

572
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:55,850
my favorite one to do because, uh,
it was on a very controversial topic.

573
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:01,040
The idea of taking a human
mind and breaking it down
to ones and Zeros and then

574
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:04,490
downloading it into something
that we create. Singularity. Yeah.

575
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:08,210
Whether it is computer or whether it's
an artificial body that you know has an

576
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:12,350
artificial brain and like literally
like a bolt to the back of your head and

577
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:12,950
your,

578
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:17,950
your Usb to Usb in your brain and all
sudden Brian Callen exists in a super body

579
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,290
because you're running around jumping
over buildings and you're not even made

580
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:24,920
out of tissue anymore.
You made out of carbon fiber and then

581
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,160
I'll finally have the athleticism.

582
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:32,750
I think everyone's going to be at some
point in time, but that is the big, uh,

583
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:37,930
the big theory is how much of this is
science fiction or the big discussion

584
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:42,980
rather is how much of this is science
fiction because the idea of being able to

585
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:46,590
add escape, escape your biologic 100%
right? Yeah. And to be able to, to,

586
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:49,760
to get the mind and somehow know,

587
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,880
transport the consciousness
into something else.

588
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,850
Maybe there's no one has
ever shown. Yeah, we,

589
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,570
no one's ever shown that we can even
isolate where consciousness comes from.

590
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,613
We know that,
you know,

591
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,800
we believe it's created by the
brain because of a bunch of factors.

592
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:08,810
But the brain could be just like a really
sophisticated instrument for tuning in

593
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,450
the consciousness of your entire body.
Well,

594
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:14,610
or the way that these
mathematicians are now calling, uh,

595
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,380
the idea that our brain may
very well be a hologram. Uh,

596
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,920
what we see as a mathematical
hologram of some kind.

597
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,420
This guy had on my podcast as an author,
went and talked to all these big time,

598
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,430
uh, mathematicians at MIT because he was
trying to work on this book. And they,

599
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,920
they were like, well, I mean, the latest
theory if you really want to hear it,

600
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:38,100
is that this is one big
hologram and you're, you were

601
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,820
actually,

602
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,260
there's a another dimension to our
minds that we haven't thought about yet.

603
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,520
I was like, what are you talking about?
What are you even saying? But it was,

604
00:35:47,521 --> 00:35:49,750
you know,
this is all these guys done numbers too.

605
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:52,990
That's what's really fucked about those
theoretical quantum physicists guys.

606
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,820
They'll show you like in numbers.
Well,

607
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,740
they said that that this
is where they started with,

608
00:35:56,741 --> 00:36:01,550
they said if you were to
take all the space away from
what's what you're made of,

609
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:04,460
say you're made of atoms and
it's mostly space and energy.

610
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,850
If you were to take the space away from
that, from every human being in every,

611
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:09,530
every piece of material,

612
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:13,430
you could fit every human being
that's ever lived in side of baseball.

613
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,130
And then they started going,
well, if that's the case,

614
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:19,220
then there's gotta be a mathematical
explanation for this theoretically,

615
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,850
which would mean that this is some kind
of a Hologram, et Cetera, et cetera.

616
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,770
Leave it up to these mathematicians.
You know,

617
00:36:24,771 --> 00:36:27,740
you're just got to the point when you
start getting that high math stuff,

618
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,460
it doesn't weigh more
fascinating, right? It's like the,

619
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,900
it's a mathematical model of how

620
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,911
universe might work,

621
00:36:33,911 --> 00:36:36,240
but it doesn't tell you anything
about reality cause there's nothing,

622
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:39,010
any of that you can test it just saying
behind the curtain there might be this,

623
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,010
but there's no way of looking behind the
curtain. Right. There's this like with,

624
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:43,090
you know,
stupid strength theory.

625
00:36:43,091 --> 00:36:46,150
You can't really test it yet because
it's based on these like tiny little

626
00:36:46,151 --> 00:36:50,080
dimensions in the, in, in underneath
atoms and things like that.

627
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:53,050
So it's kind of like a
little bit meaningless. Sure.

628
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,490
Although wouldn't you say,
and I've heard that there,

629
00:36:55,491 --> 00:37:00,040
there have been mathematical equations
that were thought up 150 years ago by

630
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:03,790
random mathematicians and it really
had no bearing on the physical world.

631
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,520
A hundred years later,
130 years later. Oh look,

632
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:10,300
I'm measuring the distance between quarks
and how they relate to such and such.

633
00:37:10,301 --> 00:37:13,030
And in fact this equation is
incredibly applicable. Yeah.

634
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,410
Some types of math, like people
thought there was no use for it at all.

635
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:17,700
Like you mentioned to me numbers,

636
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,120
the square root of minus
one is an imaginary number.
It's not a real number. Uh,

637
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,050
uh, they, they didn't have
any use back in the day.

638
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:26,160
They're just Newtonian mechanics.

639
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,250
But now quantum mechanics uses
imaginary numbers in the math.

640
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,850
That's what blows my mind is the fact
that, fuck, did you just say that?

641
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,230
And that's what blows my mind because
in math,

642
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,190
oh my God, I'm so stupid yet
there yet they're practical.

643
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:44,490
Yet they haven't applied
practical application to,

644
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,490
to reality now because these,
these quantum scientists, the,

645
00:37:48,491 --> 00:37:50,730
when they're dealing on the quantum level,
it actually,

646
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,600
it's actually relevant and that's what
fascinates me is somebody thinks up an

647
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:58,080
incredible mathematical equation a
hundred years ago for no reason and Lo and

648
00:37:58,081 --> 00:37:58,914
behold,

649
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,450
he thought it up and we're using it today
because it reflects the physical world.

650
00:38:02,451 --> 00:38:07,451
Just been a whole history of mathematics
that most people are completely

651
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:09,980
ignorant to me. Absolutely. I,

652
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,030
but I have read articles where people
who are mathematical geniuses were

653
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,940
describing like breakthroughs and Mac
mathematics and they look at it like,

654
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,470
see people look at baseball.

655
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,980
They look at it like people look like
the great sports heroes of the past.

656
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:24,420
Like great mathematicians.

657
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,230
It's like there's like this
weird sort of comradery,

658
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,240
this a culture of these super people
that are just concentrating on numbers.

659
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,980
So fucking freaky

660
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,520
thing.

661
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,800
They're in their own little world because
they've got this language that only

662
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:42,040
they can talk. They talk to other
mathematicians about things.

663
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:42,970
So you're talking about like,

664
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,360
I was on the bus once a back in England
and there's two guys behind me and they

665
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:50,560
were talking about 24 dimensional sphere
packing. And it started out, they said,

666
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,480
well,
24 dimensional spear packing.

667
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,940
And then after that I couldn't
understand a single word that they said.

668
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,500
It was just this complete gobbledygook

669
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,420
good.
There's a great,

670
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,120
NPR did an amazing documentary on this
mathematician who's name escapes me.

671
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,750
He was, they were just honoring him, all
these mathematicians around the world.

672
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:11,110
And they talked to this
famous mathematician and he
said, oh, he was a saint.

673
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,320
And a guy goes, what? He goes, he was a
saint, there's no other way to put it.

674
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:15,970
And he said, what do
you mean? He said, his,

675
00:39:15,971 --> 00:39:20,380
his influence on all of us was so profound
because what he would do was he would

676
00:39:20,381 --> 00:39:23,530
find out that there was a mathematician
somewhere in the world working on a very

677
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:26,770
complicated problem. And he would
show up at their door and say,

678
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,680
he would show up at the
door and say, uh, hello, uh,

679
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:33,190
my name is such and such and I'm here
to lend you my brain in any way I can.

680
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:36,940
And he would help the guy.
And I know it's so brilliant though.

681
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,570
Image of you in middle jerking off and
that guy and knocking on the door wants

682
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:44,650
to play with numbers. What the fuck are
you buddy? I don't even know each other.

683
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,060
Get outta here. Get outta here.
Where you crazy mass kill.

684
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,440
He would come up with weird ideas that
he'd see a hawk flying overhead and he'd

685
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:50,920
say,

686
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,420
and he'd calculate the amount of the
globe that the Hawk was able to see at any

687
00:39:55,421 --> 00:39:56,850
given time or,

688
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:02,320
or when or if or if it flew for 60
minutes and he would come up with these

689
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:05,770
incredible answers where you go,
that's actually kind of it.

690
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,630
What's really fascinating is how
little attention we put to that,

691
00:40:09,631 --> 00:40:14,631
but yet what a huge impact it has on
the reality of our world as opposed to

692
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,300
celebrities having babies.
Oh Em Gee,

693
00:40:18,301 --> 00:40:22,920
Alec Baldwin freaked out on that.
Photog can you believe that? No,

694
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,130
I can't believe it.
A Guy,

695
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:26,910
he's got a temper and there's a bunch of
dudes standing in front of him when he

696
00:40:26,911 --> 00:40:30,750
was with his baby taking pictures.
Yeah. I wonder why he went crazy. Yeah.

697
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,950
I wonder why he went after them.

698
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:36,510
That's not nearly as bizarre
as the whole picture.

699
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,710
Look at this world of mathematics that
allows this person to make this camera

700
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:45,060
look at this super genius had figured
out how to get this chip and break this

701
00:40:45,061 --> 00:40:48,390
computer down to this tiny little
sensor and figuring out how to,

702
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:52,050
and it's all digital and you fucking
can use your finger to flip through the

703
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:56,370
images and it's this huge thing.
It just captures everything crystal clear.

704
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:03,450
That's, that's Matt. That's craziness.
Hot Chick, isn't it in a way,

705
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,440
but,
but the,

706
00:41:04,441 --> 00:41:08,610
the main impact of it is this massive
distraction of celebrity gossip.

707
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,490
Okay, cool. Shit.

708
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:13,090
Because that's immediate and visceral
that anyone can relate to it.

709
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:17,940
I know, but it's weird how people can
relate to a metric to track shiny. Yeah.

710
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:20,610
But it's, it's, it's amazing how all,

711
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:24,920
I mean if you looked at like our
pie chart of what what we, uh,

712
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,380
pay attention to in the
world and showed math,

713
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,850
it would be so small.
It was this little tiny slip out of us.

714
00:41:32,851 --> 00:41:34,610
Think about sex and food

715
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:39,440
and music. Your music sucks. Fucking
Twitter assholes on Twitter. You know,

716
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,760
again, isn't Twitter the
mechanism by which you do it?

717
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,960
It's an algorithm probably who wasn't
the algorithm. This is all man.

718
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,280
It's all benefit for sure.

719
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:48,870
And it's with the Internet would be
impossible if it wasn't for the matter.

720
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,620
The lack of math kind of underlies a lot
of the conspiracy theories out of that

721
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:52,370
because people don't,

722
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:56,330
they have this stopping point that they
can't get beyond because at some point

723
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:58,490
you've got to do a little
bit of math to check your,

724
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,920
your science or your theory or
whatever it is, right? Like with light,

725
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,360
the chem trail thing like Giddy,

726
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,220
you get this angles and geometry and
stuff like that, but people, you know,

727
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,910
they stopped because they can't do that.

728
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,740
And with other things like
we'll trade center collapsed.

729
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:14,060
There's and things like that.
There's a bit of math to do there,

730
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:19,330
but the vast majority of people can never
get past that mental barrier of having

731
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:21,104
to do a bit of math.

732
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,930
Yeah, well the math of how many people
would have to be in on it is a big one.

733
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,720
I mean you're not talking about like
people always like to use the Manhattan

734
00:42:28,721 --> 00:42:32,740
project as a good example of people being
able to keep a secret for a long time,

735
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,590
but boy is that a different
sort of situation,

736
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,860
boys at a different time in the world?
Yeah,

737
00:42:38,861 --> 00:42:41,140
wartime before social internet,

738
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:46,000
before a social networking programs that
we enjoy today that allow you to know

739
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:49,410
that Tommy Morrison died today and let
you get immediately, instantly that ride.

740
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,170
It's going to say it's very hard to get
information to people that, oh, it comes,

741
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:54,340
it comes so rapid right now.
It's just,

742
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,010
it's hard to believe that they would
be able to keep that a secret. That's,

743
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,920
that's one thing and then
it's hard to see the benefit.

744
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:03,160
Like what's what's actually being
done here? People being what,

745
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:06,280
who's actually getting hurt because
of this? Like how many more diseases?

746
00:43:06,281 --> 00:43:09,280
And we really looked at the numbers.
What is, what does the MPO, oh, actually,

747
00:43:09,281 --> 00:43:11,100
we're healthier now than ever before.
So what,

748
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,290
what are we actually looking at here?
What are we, we're looking at here.

749
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,124
It's like this,

750
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:20,310
this very blinder edge look
of the world where you're,

751
00:43:21,251 --> 00:43:26,251
you're just choosing to focus on one
aspect of something that you're seeing and

752
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:31,270
consumes our lives as well. The picture
spreads into everything. Yeah. It's a,

753
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,910
it's almost a philosophy.
It's, uh, there's,

754
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:39,390
there's a philosophy to skepticism and
there's a philosophy to cynicism and I

755
00:43:39,431 --> 00:43:42,940
think they're different things. And I
think a lot of people look at skeptics,

756
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:45,520
skepticism and cynicism as being equal.

757
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,910
And I don't think they're eating a little,

758
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,600
I have a bit of a problem with,
like, I used the word debunker. Uh,

759
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,930
rather than skeptic. A skeptic kind
of just implies all you're little,

760
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:56,630
you don't believe in stuff,
but debunkers an active thing.

761
00:43:56,631 --> 00:43:59,360
You're actually going out there and
trying to do something about it.

762
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,650
But people think that debunk has I just
automatically disbelieving everything

763
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,960
which work, which is not what
not work. Debugging is about.

764
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:08,810
It's about finding things that
are wrong and then exposing them,

765
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:10,220
not starting out.
Assuming yes.

766
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:11,280
Isn't that,

767
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,280
isn't that the scientific method isn't
skepticism and doubt what is always the

768
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:19,170
scientist is always got to
prove. Yeah, absolutely.

769
00:44:19,171 --> 00:44:22,270
I always keep doubt in his mind. Right?
So you have to be skeptical as a,

770
00:44:22,271 --> 00:44:24,430
as a scientist think
the anti science people,

771
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:28,210
they think that science is a dogma
that's fixed. Whereas completely opposite

772
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,070
sciences is constantly changing and
constantly correcting it or all is doing

773
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:36,040
basically it's finding the things
that still are not known in science.

774
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,320
And what I really like about what you,

775
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,840
the way you do it is you're not making
any enemies while you're doing it.

776
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,250
You know, you're, you're being nice about
it. You're being very calm about it.

777
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,070
When you were in the face of
incredible stupidity when uh,

778
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:52,400
when we did our show and that guy was
creating his is fucking cloud machine was

779
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:55,330
goofy fake harp thing.
That wasn't even really hard.

780
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:59,070
It was like he is attaching an electricity
to this box and sending a current

781
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:03,480
through it and he had artificial like
those MREs for those a bonsai things that

782
00:45:03,481 --> 00:45:05,970
you see at the mall. There's always
looked out but you never buy one.

783
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,990
You know those bonsai trees always look
sweet like Mac bonds actually in my

784
00:45:10,991 --> 00:45:15,120
office, but shit, they make
noise to Gurgle, Gurgle,

785
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:19,710
shyness saw the original bonds I the
ones that have four or 500 years old.

786
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:20,280
I was a kid,

787
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,000
I never forgot that I went to mainland
China and they're tiny and they're four

788
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:27,190
or 500 yards yard.
Oh there are my God hear them.

789
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:32,610
They had some that were 700 year old
trees that were still tiny and they were

790
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,090
exactly like a 700 a hundred year
old oak or something and they were,

791
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,140
I couldn't get over it. I was probably,
how old was I? I was 15 years old.

792
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:43,890
I couldn't stop staring at, so they're
just constantly manicuring yeah,

793
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,620
there's that.
There are people who pass their gender,

794
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,130
their skill to generation after
generation and they raised these,

795
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,980
these trees and they're bonsai trees.
And Wow,

796
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,910
that's amazing. That's another
thing, man. It's like we,

797
00:45:57,911 --> 00:46:02,790
we have it in our heads so much that
this is the way culture is like America,

798
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:03,391
like this is it.

799
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:08,391
Like this is like one possibility that
a pattern can get started and then it

800
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:09,870
follows.
It becomes a tradition.

801
00:46:09,871 --> 00:46:12,000
Then it becomes your culture and
then it becomes the way you behave.

802
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:16,560
And they're radically different. I
mean boys like girls, girls like boys,

803
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:18,540
sometimes girls like girls,
sometimes boys like boys.

804
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:23,500
Other than that it's all bets are off.
People they have their,

805
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:27,090
their writing is fucking incredibly alien
that driving on the wrong side of the

806
00:46:27,091 --> 00:46:29,310
street.
They have all sorts of things.

807
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,710
The you except as like being like
normal to you. They're like, like,

808
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,740
like they white,
they wipe their ass with their left hand.

809
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:40,740
Like you can't touch a dude's
left hand. Right. The Guy I had,

810
00:46:40,741 --> 00:46:44,250
the guy I had on just,
I'm about to have my podcast Josh for,

811
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,570
I just did an interview with him and he
has been living in the Congo with hunter

812
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:50,910
gatherers, the original, the final,

813
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:55,530
probably one of the last very last people
and the deep Congo forest with pygmies.

814
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,790
They're all pygmies.
They come up,

815
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,480
toss guy comes up to his shoulders and
he had Justin wren on the podcast, who's,

816
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:01,314
you know who he is,

817
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,590
he's on the ultimate fighter and now he's
dedicated his entire life to help him

818
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:07,750
pygmies. He goes back and
forth there and makes films.

819
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,650
It makes me wonder if Josh knows
and Josh Board, but I bet they do.

820
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:13,620
I'll just pick me, help her dudes and
asked him. I asked him, what's this scary,

821
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,431
but he was just talking about it.

822
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,730
He was talking about progress and he
said the one thing we don't die of his

823
00:47:16,731 --> 00:47:19,970
stupid diseases, thank God for
vaccines and antibiotics and stuff and,

824
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,080
and there's a lot of
death. Uh, but he said,

825
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:26,400
but then he was talking about how for
the most part they smoke I shit load of

826
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:31,020
weed by the way. Ah, yeah.
And the pygmies always high,

827
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:33,790
always hot and they spent a lot of time,
they actually,

828
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,230
there's a lot of food around
so they're prime murmur.

829
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,260
Merrily carnivores that eat some
roots and they different nuts. But um,

830
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:45,010
but there's enough food around and they
have a lot of time to hang out and said,

831
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:45,490
what are they doing?

832
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:48,100
It's just a lot of times they'll just
watch their kids run around and play.

833
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:53,050
I was like, I said, what's
the most dangerous animal?
Like a, you know, snakes.

834
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:55,630
He goes, no, no, not snakes.
You don't have to worry about
it. It's just elephants.

835
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,820
I was like, what do you mean?
He goes, elephants in the,

836
00:47:57,821 --> 00:48:02,270
and you always sneak up on
them by accident and they
just come at you and God,

837
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:06,310
that's must be so
terrifying and intelligent.

838
00:48:06,311 --> 00:48:09,430
Giant animal that's to
there. This, Justin Wren,

839
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,070
when the first time of these kids
had ever seen a white guy before,

840
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:17,020
and Justin's a big giant white
guy with really light skin. Wow.

841
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,780
They're freaking out. Justin has red hair,
right? It's like reddish brown brown.

842
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,760
Good on you. Justin wren.
Good on you. He's a little
ginger. Oh, he's a great guy.

843
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:26,730
He's a real sweetheart.
And uh,

844
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,640
he said that this really gave his life
a lot of meeting and he just feels

845
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,640
completely dedicated to these people.
Know that those kids, they're so sweet.

846
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,660
They're, well, he just exploded the way
you explained it was very pure, you know,

847
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:40,750
that he wouldn't, when he went over there
and he started helping these people,

848
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:44,860
like he had this massive sense of
helping, you know, that he could help,

849
00:48:44,861 --> 00:48:47,260
that he could accomplish something,
that he could really make an impact.

850
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:51,110
I asked Josh, I said, you know, you see
a lot of death and that people die and,

851
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,770
and one of the things that,
one of the things that modern,

852
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:58,270
I think society has given us is we
have to bury our children a lot less

853
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:02,590
frequently than we did. Just 50 years
ago. Thank God. And I said, one,

854
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:03,880
when someone,
you know,

855
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,990
people who are on such an intimate
terms with life and death with a lot of

856
00:49:07,991 --> 00:49:11,260
people die all the time. Uh, how do they
deal with death? And he looked at me,

857
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:12,700
he said, people are just people, man.

858
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,580
And they take death just
as heavily as any of us do,

859
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:19,420
regardless of how frequent it happens.
It's always, you know, a soul crusher.

860
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,660
I'm sure that we had this
tendency to believe, well,

861
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:26,890
you've been around it a lot and they just
accept the fact that that's a part of

862
00:49:26,891 --> 00:49:27,860
reality.
But the,

863
00:49:27,861 --> 00:49:32,470
the impact of it father losing their
son or mother losing or whatever, it's,

864
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,660
it's incredibly painful.
It's always going to be,

865
00:49:34,661 --> 00:49:38,140
it's one of the main motivating factors
that people have to succeed and to

866
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,600
shelter themselves correctly and to
keep food on the table. You know,

867
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,590
you're never going to avoid that.
It's pulling America.

868
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,410
There'll be sheltered from, from death, I
think. Yeah, absolutely. It was spoiled.

869
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:52,230
One theory about the waterways, the
FEMA coffins, uh, which is great liners.

870
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,140
There's big piles of grave
liners in the field somewhere.

871
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,710
People say that the coffins,
that FEMA has been stockpiling a,

872
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:00,250
but they're really just like these plastic
things that they put it up of grapes.

873
00:50:00,251 --> 00:50:02,650
But you know, cause people
aren't familiar with, you know,

874
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,090
they don't go to very many
funerals because again,

875
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,770
very few people die over the course of
your life until you get to be older.

876
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,440
All the young people I had,

877
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,790
they don't recognize these things cause
they don't know anything about the

878
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:16,270
burial process. So they think, oh it
must be like FEMA slot behind coffins.

879
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,800
Yeah.
And they'd probably listen to Alex Jones.

880
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:22,730
That wasn't Alex Jones thing.

881
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:27,650
Camps coffins lined up.
You're telling me West,

882
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,370
I have been to the FEMA camps.
That was good.

883
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:34,280
There's 10,000 body holds out there.
Boy,

884
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,400
I want to hear him hitting on a girl,
Joe Rogan.

885
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:41,130
Joe Rogan is one of the most
underrated impressionist show.

886
00:50:41,131 --> 00:50:44,870
If it's Alex Jones or Joey's the is and
Mike Tyson. You do a great Mike Tyson.

887
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,630
I haven't done that one a long time.
You do a very good Mike Tyson.

888
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:52,780
You do a great Arnold. Thank
you very much. You're sweetie.
But I am um, what, uh,

889
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:53,770
what owes the,

890
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,770
we sort of got a little bit sidetracked
with a Brian's awesome story of pygmies.

891
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,990
Sorry. It's pretty bad out. Don't
sorry. It was pretty bad ass.

892
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,950
But what I was getting to
was that, um, you, you don't,

893
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,460
you don't make any enemies
when trying to see it,

894
00:51:09,461 --> 00:51:13,170
but you can't help it sometimes because
people will take just the fact that you

895
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:15,950
are explaining where they
were wrong. Right. As being,

896
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:19,520
you telling them they asked stupid. Yes.
But I would tell them they're stupid.

897
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:21,950
That's my point.
It's like you do so much better job.

898
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,210
Just so much better for this job than
me because as a comedian that was,

899
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:29,690
it's a real problem with like even
doing this Joe Rogan questions,

900
00:51:29,691 --> 00:51:31,280
anything show or everything show,

901
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,740
because there was certain point
in times where as a comedian,

902
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:35,390
I couldn't just have you
stand in front of me.

903
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:39,620
Tell me you've seen something completely
retarded with no emotion attached to it.

904
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:44,450
You know, I just like, Oh really? Oh you
did. Oh did ya fucking wasting my time.

905
00:51:44,451 --> 00:51:48,020
Especially asshole. I look,
I try to be really nice.

906
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,780
As much as I can get a lot better,

907
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,680
I got a lot better cause he used
to be when you were younger,

908
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:56,170
Joe would just be like, what? That's
stupid. I'm not talking to anymore.

909
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:57,380
I knew there's,

910
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,130
there's things that can happen in this
life that can really hold you up and one

911
00:52:01,131 --> 00:52:01,491
of them,

912
00:52:01,491 --> 00:52:05,810
one of the things that can complicate
and fuck your life up to no end is when

913
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:09,830
you make the mistake of allowing really
stupid people into your life because

914
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:12,260
really stupid people that not
thinking about themselves,

915
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,460
they're not thinking about you.
They're just thinking about filling holes,

916
00:52:16,461 --> 00:52:19,880
whether it's emotional holes or
psychologicals and they're not.

917
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:21,380
They're not really even there for you.

918
00:52:21,381 --> 00:52:23,600
I wish you had learned
that they're everywhere.

919
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:28,180
They're like poisonous plants that look
like the real thing. It's like if, if you,

920
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,460
you like it, there was a certain smell
that salary gave off and if you ate it,

921
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,340
it just breaks your Dick,
gives you diarrhea,

922
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:38,000
it gives you headaches or six months. You
would avoid that. Like the play. Well,

923
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:41,990
but that is the case with relationships.
It's the case with friendships.

924
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:44,640
It's the cast case with
relationships and at,

925
00:52:44,641 --> 00:52:47,720
when I was young I felt like
I was fighting up river.

926
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:50,060
I felt like those motherfuckers,

927
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:54,200
these weak dummies that will get in your
life and make up stories and lie or be

928
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:57,800
mean to you or shit on you or say
things about you behind your back,

929
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:00,780
they're your enemy.
So it comes to that go through.

930
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:05,540
Cause I still learned that and I never
did nobody. Yeah, I just figured that out.

931
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:06,890
Well it wasn't entirely right.

932
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,250
I she's like create a lot of enemies
that didn't need to be my enemies.

933
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:14,900
There was a much more levelheaded
way of looking at it. But that took,

934
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:18,410
for me at least it took some,
I had a,

935
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,180
I had to develop that
understanding on my own.

936
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,480
I had a developed understanding or
like when to do it, when to not,

937
00:53:23,481 --> 00:53:25,860
when to be kind to people and when to like

938
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:29,340
try to genuinely let someone know
that you can't listen to this anymore.

939
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,860
You know, like, listen, I just,
I'm sure you're a nice guy,

940
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:34,920
but here this is my take on this and
this is why I don't like discussing these

941
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:39,810
things. Whereas if I was 23 I would have
been like, dude, please shut the fuck up.

942
00:53:39,811 --> 00:53:42,300
You're killing my brain.
You fucking dummy.

943
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,750
Don't you didn't see the
Shit I had to do that.

944
00:53:45,751 --> 00:53:49,350
A couple of people will
fucking beat you down.

945
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,180
They will beat you down with stupidity.

946
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:55,560
They will climb inside your head and
just say a bunch of stupid shit out you.

947
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,830
And if you allow,
if you venture into that world,

948
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,240
you're going to be hanging around with
problems to solve where you get nowhere.

949
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,880
You're life is not going to be
like figuring out your life.

950
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:09,780
Your life is going to be dealing with
whatever emotional bullshit these morons

951
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:11,430
in your life have dragged into it.

952
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:15,120
And instead of like supporting each
other and helping each other and evolving

953
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:15,930
together,

954
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:19,620
you're in this constant weird stream
of conflict with the person that you're

955
00:54:19,621 --> 00:54:22,410
friends with. Ab think he's mad at me,
man. I don't know what the fuck I did,

956
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:24,180
but you know he's got a
bug up his ass lately.

957
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:27,300
Like you know those types of people
and they start conflicts and then hey,

958
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:30,350
Bobby thinks you're mad at him. I mean
I don't know where you want to do that.

959
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,590
What is all that? What is, where's that
coming from? This is a pro. You get,

960
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,520
you let that shit into your life,
you got problems and people date that too.

961
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,630
Exactly.
In relationships where they,

962
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:43,380
where they're having text wars for
three hours. It's really simple.

963
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:47,880
Don't be a cunt. Don't be a
[inaudible] zone. Yeah, don't be a con.

964
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:51,270
And we could all be nice to each other,
but as soon as you allow continuous,

965
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:55,620
and this motherfucker was, he had a whole
cunt farm. He had a hole cut, a hole,

966
00:54:55,621 --> 00:54:59,460
cut produce section and he was just,
he had all of these constant,

967
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:02,280
he was growing in his life
all over the place. The point,

968
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:05,160
we'd be constantly late for things
because he would always have like 15

969
00:55:05,161 --> 00:55:08,580
different obligations at some asshole
that he was hanging out with. Dude, dude,

970
00:55:08,581 --> 00:55:11,400
I really need you to have for me,
brother. I really need you there for me.

971
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:13,180
This is my thing. You know? Oh,

972
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:15,980
this is my first time in acting class
where I'm standing up, but I'm doing like,

973
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:20,220
and you would go to these idiots think
you would go to all those things and then

974
00:55:20,221 --> 00:55:23,250
you would come to me afterwards. He was
like, you got to clean your life outside.

975
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,540
You got to clean your life out.

976
00:55:24,541 --> 00:55:27,480
You hanging around with way too
many crazy assholes. Exhausting.

977
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:30,660
That was the best compliment you ever gave
me. He said you never needed anything.

978
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,150
Right. I think that's why you
hung out with me a lot, right?

979
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:35,250
Cause I just didn't need
anything from you. Oh,

980
00:55:35,251 --> 00:55:39,360
you look one of my most Leeton
least needy friends I've ever met.

981
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:42,030
Nothing. You need nothing.
When I'm first met,

982
00:55:42,031 --> 00:55:45,630
you didn't even have a fucking door knob.
I didn't have a door knob.

983
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:48,420
He was living in Venice in a fucking
apartment. I go upstairs. Uh,

984
00:55:48,421 --> 00:55:51,630
this is his place. I pushed the door
open. I'm looking down. There's no,

985
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:54,210
there's no knob.
It's a whole.

986
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:57,900
You could look down on your knees and
look right into his apart. I father,

987
00:55:57,901 --> 00:56:01,580
I said that to me. My father saw the car
was driving. That goes, hey, he goes up,

988
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:05,070
I can afford to buy you a nicer car you
want me to do. I'll do it right now.

989
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:05,970
I was like, man, I'm all right.

990
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:10,970
Now what I recognize when I met you was
this guy who is like almost like you're

991
00:56:11,311 --> 00:56:15,330
trying to save people from
the thing that you would be.

992
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:20,340
You would least like you're to find
yourself in that sort of a position.

993
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,980
I think that's good. You were,
you were looking at them.

994
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:27,760
If they were you and you didn't feel
entirely secure growing up and you felt

995
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:30,960
like as a good person that you are,
you would just cha cha,

996
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,290
try to help these guys out. He's
a good guy, just got a bath.

997
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,320
He's got a crazy idea
project for me yesterday.

998
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,670
The idea of how and
bring them in otherwise,

999
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,460
but the beautiful thing about you do this,
first of all,

1000
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:44,320
we never argued about these things.

1001
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:46,150
Like when you had a crazy
person in your life,

1002
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:50,980
you were more than willing to listen
you you like we disagreed about a few of

1003
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:55,981
them but you never got like shitty about
it and I think you're a really logical

1004
00:56:56,921 --> 00:56:57,260
thinking.

1005
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:01,960
You always have been and so like you
looking back on all your behavior so

1006
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:05,200
fascinating because you're looking
at it like a science project.

1007
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:08,830
Like oh this is why I was doing this
here and this is why it was a silly goose

1008
00:57:08,831 --> 00:57:10,570
right there and right.

1009
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:15,780
The amount of time I wasted just just
buying two parrots and having two dogs and

1010
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:20,740
moving a complete lunatic into my house.
You know, I just, I would like, let's see,

1011
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,330
well let's see.
Everything's going well.

1012
00:57:22,331 --> 00:57:25,270
Let me see how I can complicate
the shit out of this.

1013
00:57:25,271 --> 00:57:29,400
Maybe I can buy a chimp while I'm at it.
You know, it just, you do, you do a lot.

1014
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,440
It's a lot of, it's just self
sabotage in a way. It is,

1015
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:34,630
but that the logical
thinking that you have it,

1016
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:37,900
what's fascinating about it and how it
applies to debunking things and you've

1017
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:42,440
always been really good at that or really
a energetic about it, you know, um,

1018
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,640
is that when you have like this way of
thinking that you sort of cultivated over

1019
00:57:50,321 --> 00:57:53,560
a lifetime of watching people
fuck up left and right around you.

1020
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:56,800
You can sometimes see other people's
problems better than you can even see in

1021
00:57:56,801 --> 00:58:00,700
your own. And so you see that and he'd
go, oh, no, no, no, no, no, that's this.

1022
00:58:00,701 --> 00:58:03,550
You're looking at this like, it's like,
well, what you really want to be do?

1023
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:08,350
It's like turn inward and figure out
why the fuck you're doing the weird shit

1024
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:09,880
that you're doing and your
life in the first place.

1025
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:14,290
And once you started doing that,
your life completely turned around.

1026
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:18,280
You got rid of all the cuckoo heads in
your life and then your career started

1027
00:58:18,281 --> 00:58:20,320
taking off and then you realize,
oh,

1028
00:58:20,321 --> 00:58:24,610
I was distracting myself and that was
holding me back. Wow. I didn't know.

1029
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,240
What I find most fascinating
about that when it, when you,

1030
00:58:28,241 --> 00:58:33,241
when you apply that to like debunking
is that there's no god damn guidebook to

1031
00:58:34,931 --> 00:58:35,764
living life.

1032
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:39,940
And when you're going through life and
you're trying to figure the whole thing

1033
00:58:39,941 --> 00:58:44,941
out and trying to be a good person and
trying to follow the laws and succeed and

1034
00:58:45,881 --> 00:58:49,960
get ahead, nobody really can
tell you how the fuck to do it.

1035
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,320
And a lot of times people feel like
there's forces holding them down.

1036
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,230
There's a lot of times people feel like,
man, if I was just in with that crowd,

1037
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:59,450
then I would know if I was just with the
hell. It's all nepotism, it's all the,

1038
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,340
it's,

1039
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:05,230
it's a crazy scary system that
we're filtering our bodies through.

1040
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,460
That's what it really is.

1041
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:11,700
And so there's a lot of perceived shit
out there that's really internal shit and

1042
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:14,800
that's one of the issues.

1043
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:19,720
It's causing people to look at whatever
it is that they want to believe is real.

1044
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,100
Whatever crazy area,

1045
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:27,101
51 conspiracy theory they want to pull
all their time into like why are you

1046
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:28,730
really doing that?

1047
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:33,830
Is it really because the evidence is
overwhelming or is there a psychological

1048
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:34,940
issue at stake here?

1049
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:38,570
Is there something going on that
you're trying to not think about?

1050
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,670
Is that what's causing you?
And you know what,

1051
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:45,070
most of them admit it's the great demise.
Most of them are met.

1052
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,980
It's a midlife crisis thing. They were
honest about it. Really. A big foot guys.

1053
00:59:48,981 --> 00:59:51,310
And I went out, went,
cause it gives me space,

1054
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,900
part of this small community of believers.
Well,

1055
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:57,860
the big foot guys were super
cool and really nice guys.

1056
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:00,920
And one of the things the guy said, they
were really fun. Like they weren't dumb.

1057
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:01,910
They're just really fun,

1058
01:00:01,911 --> 01:00:04,910
interesting guys who believe in Sasquatch
and they're like going and looking for

1059
01:00:04,911 --> 01:00:08,640
him. But the guy was like, even
if it's not real or camping. Yeah.

1060
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:13,600
And it was any hint joy man. He
enjoyed it. He was a cool guy. Yeah.

1061
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,660
And Randy talked about
modern art, uh, enthusiasts.

1062
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:21,770
So they'd come and see Rauschenberg,
like a, a broom in a, in a bucket.

1063
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,350
And he'd sell it for
$200,000 and she said,

1064
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:25,970
they're not here for
art than I even heard.

1065
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:29,780
They are here to be part of a very small
elite group of people that actually can

1066
01:00:29,781 --> 01:00:34,750
quote unquote appreciate such as
such sort of obscure expression.

1067
01:00:34,751 --> 01:00:34,860
Yeah.

1068
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:38,640
I think there's a big difference though
between like big foot and say Cantrell's

1069
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,300
in nine 11. Because if you're,
if you're wrong about bigfoot,

1070
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:45,260
there's no no big deal. You just like,
you know, weren't right but big foot.

1071
01:00:45,261 --> 01:00:47,510
But if you're wrong about
nine 11 or chem trails,

1072
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:49,370
then your entire world
view comes crashing down.

1073
01:00:49,371 --> 01:00:54,371
So I think people are much more invested
mentally in things like the most

1074
01:00:54,441 --> 01:00:57,970
serious conspiracy theories and the
origin, the supernatural and things.

1075
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:02,350
Yeah, I do believe your
ride being invested mentally
is a great way to put it.

1076
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,120
It works. This works both ways as
well. Like debunkers and skeptics.

1077
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:10,560
Some of them get kind of obsessed with a,
with deep on King and people start out,

1078
01:01:10,561 --> 01:01:14,520
like as young people, young
people debunking, they uh, uh,

1079
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,470
they just knock things down one at a time.

1080
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:19,470
They see something that's wrong and
they're not stupid or like, you know, Oh,

1081
01:01:19,471 --> 01:01:21,000
let me explain that.
And they're not really,

1082
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,310
they're not really being very productive.

1083
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:27,330
And that's something I thought about a
lot as as I've been doing it for more and

1084
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:29,340
more years, is you couldn't figure
it out. You know, what's the,

1085
01:01:29,341 --> 01:01:31,110
what's the long term goal here?

1086
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:34,680
Just like telling one guy that
he's wrong and explain to one guy,

1087
01:01:34,681 --> 01:01:35,910
he's not really very useful,

1088
01:01:35,911 --> 01:01:39,840
but if you couldn't look at what you're
actually doing and try to improve the

1089
01:01:39,841 --> 01:01:44,841
way you're communicating with with these
people and try to reach a broader set

1090
01:01:45,781 --> 01:01:48,240
of people than just doing it as a sport,

1091
01:01:48,241 --> 01:01:50,970
which is kind of what a lot
of people who are skeptics do,

1092
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,990
they do it because they enjoy it.
They get this,

1093
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,530
this visceral thing like, yeah, this
year from proving, proving people wrong,

1094
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:01,180
that creates a competition sort of feel.
Yeah.

1095
01:02:01,181 --> 01:02:04,590
And it creates a lot of animosity and
that's what I was really crediting with

1096
01:02:04,591 --> 01:02:06,690
you,
that you do a great job of avoiding that.

1097
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:10,260
You just talked to them like
extremely rationally. I mean,

1098
01:02:10,261 --> 01:02:13,560
the guy that we were talking about that
did this harp experiment seemed like a

1099
01:02:13,561 --> 01:02:17,880
nice guy. Yeah, he did. This is, this is
how easy, it seemed like a very nice guy.

1100
01:02:17,881 --> 01:02:19,980
I really enjoyed his company.
It not, I'm not a bad guy

1101
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,970
at all. And he's obviously a
smart guy too. Um, but his friend,

1102
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,400
when I go into his office,
I walk in the door,

1103
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,200
they have a picture of this Indian guy,

1104
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:31,770
he's got a white beard and he's got
white paint on his face and he's, uh,

1105
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:36,870
he's kind of a, a portly fellow, like a
and a, I go, who's that guy? And he goes,

1106
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:37,231
well,

1107
01:02:37,231 --> 01:02:42,000
10 years ago he underwent an incredible
transmogrification or some shit like

1108
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:46,620
that of his body,
and now he no longer needs water or food.

1109
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:51,840
And I go, oh, he didn't rent the Tarion.
Yeah, exactly. And I just go, no,

1110
01:02:51,841 --> 01:02:56,790
he didn't. And he goes, no,
you really have to meet up. I
go, no, I don't. No, I don't.

1111
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:59,970
I can't. But that's where, that's
where everything shuts down.

1112
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:03,600
Like I have to go stop.
There's never been a person,

1113
01:03:03,601 --> 01:03:06,060
they've even proven to be
able to survive a week.

1114
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:11,310
Do you know that without a week with
no water and no food, you're gone,

1115
01:03:11,311 --> 01:03:16,260
son. You can't live active. Figured
that out. Like you're not magic, right?

1116
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:20,070
You fucking fat shit
white paint on your face,

1117
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:24,900
that outrageous. You think the
burden of proof would be on them?

1118
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:28,360
I mean that you can't just say that to
me. He said you have to meet him. The I'm,

1119
01:03:28,361 --> 01:03:31,670
I'm denying meeting him because
I'm a government chill and a,

1120
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,520
that's the whole reason why we can't
prove to the world on Joe Rogan questions.

1121
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:38,160
Everything that there are real
breadth of Tarion's. Right?

1122
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:41,310
You get the fuck out of here. God
Damn it. It's like there's not,

1123
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:44,990
there's not elves to what I
would like it to be Elvis.

1124
01:03:44,991 --> 01:03:47,340
It's like I watched this
guy reading is great.

1125
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:49,250
You had a loved it and there's that.

1126
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:53,370
We're at this cafe and this beautiful
girl is there and there's this guy,

1127
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:54,360
this middle aged guy,

1128
01:03:54,361 --> 01:03:58,760
and he's reading her palm and clearly
he is her healer or whatever. Oh yeah.

1129
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:02,250
And I just said I was with
two other people and I go,
that guy's, that guy's, oh,

1130
01:04:02,251 --> 01:04:05,010
you want to see a scam artist right
there, right there. There's a scam artist.

1131
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:07,260
Right. They're trying to get laid
by reading her palm, and he was,

1132
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:09,410
he was obviously a professional like,
you know, I could tell him about,

1133
01:04:09,411 --> 01:04:11,550
he was talking, she was asking him
questions. What does that mean?

1134
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:15,450
How do you know he's a scumbag?
I go, because he's a liar.

1135
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:17,400
That's why he's making a living that way.

1136
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:22,340
Well, you can just tell, you know, if you
ever got your palm read, it's nonsense.

1137
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:24,940
Yeah. Yeah. They just start talking
about your lifeline and you,

1138
01:04:24,941 --> 01:04:28,940
what you went to here onto one of those
places. It's open like 24 hours a day.

1139
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:32,240
It's just like the lady lives there and
then you just ring the doorbell and she

1140
01:04:32,241 --> 01:04:35,770
wakes up and it's so depressing. I went
there once drunk with a friend. Oh,

1141
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:36,560
like God.

1142
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,500
I felt like I just woke up somebody
at their house and now they're just,

1143
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:43,340
I have to talk to him. I went to one in
New York. I was on my way to an audition.

1144
01:04:43,341 --> 01:04:48,260
I had some time. I really didn't like
acting back then anyway, and a saw,

1145
01:04:48,261 --> 01:04:53,210
I went to this a Tarot card
reader ladies place and uh,

1146
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:56,480
she was wrong about everything.
I mean, could not be wrong.

1147
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:59,960
I don't even bother debunking stuff like
that, I think. But it was beautiful.

1148
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:00,480
It was.

1149
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,890
It was because I never knew my grandmother
was like always fancied herself a

1150
01:05:03,891 --> 01:05:08,330
psychic. My, Oh yeah. My
grandmother is completely crazy.

1151
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,860
Like Sylvia Brown makes $700 for,
for 20 minute consultation.

1152
01:05:12,861 --> 01:05:15,380
And my grandmother had a monkey
is a big scam. She had a monkey.

1153
01:05:15,381 --> 01:05:18,160
She rarely got a monkey. Yeah.
Monkey's was cheeky. Monkey bite

1154
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,590
everybody. Okay. She was the only
way to get hold on to this monkey.

1155
01:05:20,591 --> 01:05:23,830
That's so crazy. My grandmother was,
she lived in a haunted house. Right.

1156
01:05:23,831 --> 01:05:26,440
It was a haunted house because there was
a dude, they were renting a room too,

1157
01:05:26,441 --> 01:05:29,560
and the guy died and then he
just kept showing up, you know,

1158
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,210
even after he was dead. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

1159
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:35,470
Weird House in North Ninth
Street that they live,

1160
01:05:35,471 --> 01:05:38,500
that they bought during the Italian
period when all the immigrants were coming

1161
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:39,430
over.
So they got it.

1162
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:42,970
Like when my grandfather was working
for the factories are making the atomic

1163
01:05:42,971 --> 01:05:46,210
bomb parts. Everybody was just talk about
that, you know, grandpa makes it part.

1164
01:05:46,211 --> 01:05:50,390
They using in the atomic bomb. I thought,
wow, my grandpa's making the bomb.

1165
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:54,970
That's how fucking crazy people
were back then. But uh, this house,

1166
01:05:54,971 --> 01:05:55,690
this neighborhood,

1167
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:58,690
while they were living there constantly
changed and got worse and worse and

1168
01:05:58,691 --> 01:06:01,960
worse. They did blockbusting they
move people in and said, hey listen,

1169
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:03,640
black people are moving in.
You better sell now.

1170
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,300
And they would sell up giant chunks of
real estate at a fraction of what they're

1171
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:10,660
worth. Just through the scare
tactics. And my grandfather was like,

1172
01:06:10,661 --> 01:06:13,510
I like black people. I'm
not going anywhere. And he
stayed. And because of that,

1173
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:13,990
their,
their,

1174
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:17,140
their whole neighborhood like completely
changed and became really scary and

1175
01:06:17,141 --> 01:06:20,590
dangerous like North Ninth Street right
now where they leveled their house.

1176
01:06:20,591 --> 01:06:21,700
They died a few years back,

1177
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,610
but it was a really bad neighborhood
by the time they were gone.

1178
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:28,420
I'm like really bad. So, you know,
a lot of people were seeing shit.

1179
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:32,560
What's that sound like?
Fucking Christ on edge all the time.

1180
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:35,740
My grandmother already was crazy and
she already had a monkey, you know,

1181
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:38,170
and if you are over that house,
and I lived there for a while.

1182
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:41,180
When I first came to New York, I
didn't have any money. And uh, I,

1183
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:46,210
when I got signed by my manager, I had
to leave my apartment, uh, travel, uh,

1184
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:47,560
by car all the way to New York.

1185
01:06:47,561 --> 01:06:50,710
And I didn't have enough money to save
up for an apartment because I was only

1186
01:06:50,711 --> 01:06:52,430
making like a couple hundred bucks a week.
Right.

1187
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,490
Like doing gigs when I
first moved to New York.

1188
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:58,300
So I stayed with my grandfather in this
terrible neighborhood in North Ninth

1189
01:06:58,301 --> 01:07:01,450
Street in Jersey, in Newark.
And while I was there,

1190
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:04,300
you'd hear sirens in the middle of
the night. The next door neighbor,

1191
01:07:04,301 --> 01:07:08,280
they broke down his house with a battering
ram cause he was selling crack. Yeah.

1192
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:13,150
The week, week or two weeks before I
got there. This was all like fenced off.

1193
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:16,060
There's yellow tape and shit.
It was like, it was crazy.

1194
01:07:16,061 --> 01:07:17,950
That was his next door neighbor.
It was,

1195
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:20,620
and he knew that that kid
that became the drug dealer,

1196
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,900
he knew that kid from
the time he was a baby.

1197
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:28,230
So he got to like experience this
generational to becoming this,

1198
01:07:29,321 --> 01:07:33,590
you know, 20 year old drug dealer with
an Audi parked in his, uh, you know,

1199
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:38,160
like a little driveway area in, in
Newark, unbelieving it talent. But it was,

1200
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:38,861
it was crazy,

1201
01:07:38,861 --> 01:07:42,520
but you would feel like it was haunted
cause it was just so dangerous.

1202
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:45,640
It was crackling. So everybody was
always like, this house is haunted.

1203
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:48,400
And my grandmother was like, I knew
that was gonna happen. She always,

1204
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:52,090
any other way the, it looks like
I told Ted, scary old house.

1205
01:07:52,091 --> 01:07:56,580
Kids will think it's haunted. And then
you just say natural thing doing this, um,

1206
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:58,000
this show,
the Joe Rogan questions,

1207
01:07:58,001 --> 01:08:01,660
everything show I got to meet this guy
bandit check who's a mentalist. Did you,

1208
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,450
do you know what guys? Yeah.
Holy Shit. Is this guy good?

1209
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,710
What do you mean mentalist? He, well, he
tells you right away I'm bullshitting you.

1210
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:10,240
Okay.
This is all tricks,

1211
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:14,440
but I'm going to show you how I tricked
scientists and believing that I actually

1212
01:08:14,441 --> 01:08:17,480
had psychic for four years and he did,
I mean,

1213
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:20,750
he's a master mentalist who puts
on shows like he entertains,

1214
01:08:20,751 --> 01:08:23,570
like sort of like Penn and
teller type style. Yeah. So dude,

1215
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:27,620
I had a dollar bill in my pocket. I
pulled the dollar bill out. This is,

1216
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:31,220
we took coins, put them
over his eyes. Okay.

1217
01:08:31,221 --> 01:08:35,480
And then duct tape over the coins and
I'm holding the dollar bill here and he's

1218
01:08:35,481 --> 01:08:37,880
reading the serial number,
the dollar bill that came from my pocket.

1219
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:41,720
I know where the dollar bill came from
because it was an afterthought to put it

1220
01:08:41,721 --> 01:08:42,554
in my pocket.

1221
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:46,490
I grabbed my keys and there was like a
five and a one sitting next to my keys.

1222
01:08:46,491 --> 01:08:47,750
I go,
I'll let me get that too.

1223
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:51,920
And then I just stuffed it in my pocket
and left the house. And so when he said,

1224
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,420
can you pull a bill out of your pocket?
I knew the,

1225
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:57,200
it was a rare moment
where I knew the exact,

1226
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,920
like the history of that
dollar bill for the day.

1227
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:04,300
I knew he didn't get ahold of it.
No one had placed it in my pocket.

1228
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:06,650
Maybe he sleight of hand in your pocket.

1229
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:09,490
You don't think I'd be able to feel a
man's hands that close to my bedtime.

1230
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:13,580
Like a leopard, bro. You can't just
touch me like that and touched me there.

1231
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:16,880
I watched a to what it was waging a
hunting show me just say this right now,

1232
01:09:16,881 --> 01:09:20,540
when you talk about leopard swimming
and a deer got hit by an Arrow and deers

1233
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:23,660
are so fucking fast as the
Arrow is going through its body,

1234
01:09:23,661 --> 01:09:28,370
it turned to get away and so it wound
up shooting through the top of its body.

1235
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:29,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

1236
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:33,860
And these shows it in the video how it
happened and he's like sometimes like

1237
01:09:33,861 --> 01:09:37,490
deers, defy science. Unreal
man. It's a magic bullet.

1238
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:41,200
But you read the serial
number on the dollar.

1239
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,860
You were the serial number
on my fucking dollar bill.

1240
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:45,020
I have no idea how he
did it. He, he would,

1241
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:49,940
he did a bunch of different things like
twisting a fork, but it's all tricks.

1242
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:54,170
He tells you. He's like, I am not magic.
I don't have psychic powers. He goes,

1243
01:09:54,171 --> 01:09:55,790
I'm just really good at tricking you.

1244
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:58,500
Yeah. Well the good thing was
when he did that, the scientists,

1245
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:02,520
he actually went into this
scientific study with another
guy, uh, for about Metta,

1246
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:06,060
several, several months. And there was
these scientists who are trying to,

1247
01:10:06,061 --> 01:10:10,800
there was studying ESP and they did
all these tests on these two guys,

1248
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:14,640
but the two guys were actually the
magicians that were bantered checking this

1249
01:10:14,641 --> 01:10:18,260
other guy. And so they were basically
fooling the scientists, the scientists,

1250
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:21,540
and you don't like writing these
papers about these like amazing guys.

1251
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:23,720
And they did all these,
these tests like where they would,

1252
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,950
they would seal things up.
So there was no way that a,

1253
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:28,920
the check could actually get inside it,

1254
01:10:28,921 --> 01:10:31,740
but he would figure out a way of getting
inside the thing and like bending the

1255
01:10:31,741 --> 01:10:34,140
wire then putting it back. So no one
could tell because he's a magician.

1256
01:10:34,141 --> 01:10:36,480
He knows like I have to
get dodgy stuff like that.

1257
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:38,340
And he completely fill
them for several months.

1258
01:10:38,341 --> 01:10:41,610
And they were writing all these things
in these academic journals about how that

1259
01:10:41,611 --> 01:10:44,310
actually discovered ESP and
how they'd been replicating it.

1260
01:10:44,311 --> 01:10:48,470
But it was all this thing set up by, uh,
by James Randy who was, uh, you know,

1261
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:53,400
he's really an old time skeptic. Go who
debunked a Uri gala and people like that.

1262
01:10:53,570 --> 01:10:56,190
I know that guy. Yeah.
Yeah. We'll go with a beard.

1263
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:59,930
Yeah. He's a fascinating cat. And um,

1264
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:04,960
the whole skeptic versus psychic movement
or a debate is a very interesting one

1265
01:11:05,061 --> 01:11:09,740
as well. I did, um, an episode we
went to the Rhine Institute and we,

1266
01:11:09,741 --> 01:11:14,460
you know, did all the uh, you know the
Rhine Institute for Psychic Studies,

1267
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,660
something when it is,
it's a,

1268
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:20,670
it's a really interesting setup where
they have all these ancient methods that

1269
01:11:20,671 --> 01:11:23,910
they used to use to try to figure out
whether or not someone had psychic powers.

1270
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:27,480
The ability to pick which color
light is going to turn on next,

1271
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:32,480
the ability I failed all of them failed
everything have zero psychic power,

1272
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,130
fucking zero.

1273
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:39,840
But then there was a scene where I had
to go into this dark room and try to

1274
01:11:39,841 --> 01:11:44,010
generate energy and a, I
was like, okay, like what?

1275
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,600
Like there's this or there's a guy named,

1276
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:49,500
I think his name was ed and Ed
knew how to get it up to a million,

1277
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:51,450
which is higher than a CI masters.

1278
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:55,770
Like they had all this and all this
crazy talk about your body being able to

1279
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:00,450
generate light. So mine is very
hot. My reading is very high.

1280
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:03,480
But I take into consideration what
I was doing afterwards and I'm like,

1281
01:12:03,481 --> 01:12:07,010
I was wearing a battery pack.
Like, how has that, that's not it.

1282
01:12:07,011 --> 01:12:10,520
That's like the least scientific
way of measuring light.

1283
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:12,480
I mean I have a fucking
thing that has a light in it.

1284
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:15,990
Even if you can cover the light with
a piece of tape, which they did.

1285
01:12:15,991 --> 01:12:20,070
And even if you put the light under a
shirt, if I'm fucking stretching around,

1286
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:22,710
what are the odds of some light
peeking out there and sell equipment?

1287
01:12:22,711 --> 01:12:23,540
What kind of sites?

1288
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:26,600
Yeah,
it could actually prove this stuff.

1289
01:12:26,601 --> 01:12:29,960
They would be winning Nobel prizes cause
it's like completely changed science.

1290
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:33,290
And then they claim that they have this
proof and there's evidence that they can

1291
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:37,700
do detecting like ESPN stuff.
But when the push comes to shove,

1292
01:12:38,300 --> 01:12:38,940
they actually come.

1293
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:42,510
I, you know what, man, I've
never seen anyone who can do it,

1294
01:12:42,511 --> 01:12:47,511
but I can't believe that I know the
extent of the capabilities of all human

1295
01:12:48,271 --> 01:12:52,560
beings. There's people that have
some really bizarre intuitive skills.

1296
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:56,670
There's people that uh,
no danger better than other people

1297
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,940
check doing this stuff.
He's a

1298
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:03,140
guy, by the way, he grew up in
a very, very dangerous time.

1299
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:07,850
He grew up in South Africa. He was raising
his kids, his brothers and sisters,

1300
01:13:07,851 --> 01:13:12,590
I believe by himself. I don't know
if I keep grew up like a street kid.

1301
01:13:12,591 --> 01:13:15,950
Right. And that's, that's
experienced human beings are really,

1302
01:13:15,951 --> 01:13:17,390
really good at pattern recognition.

1303
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:20,420
So they did lots of studies
with the Swat Team Guy,

1304
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:24,590
a veteran swat team guy and then they
took a rookie cop and and the veterans,

1305
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:26,890
they have a guy just
walking up to a school,

1306
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:31,550
a up to a school with a bomb pack to his
body and behaving in a certain way and

1307
01:13:31,551 --> 01:13:32,420
when they'd simulate it,

1308
01:13:32,421 --> 01:13:35,540
the Swat team guys shoot him way earlier
cause the Swat team guy was able to

1309
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:39,140
pick up immediately something was wrong
with this guy. He wasn't a regular guy,

1310
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:40,490
was a twitch in his arm or whatever.

1311
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:44,180
And he recognize patterns over years
and that's what he was good at.

1312
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:45,410
So human beings get,

1313
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:49,180
Ken can develop what would be a peer to
be psychic powers because they pick up

1314
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:52,610
out and recognition and pick
up on signals way beforehand.

1315
01:13:52,611 --> 01:13:56,030
Like guy who trains grizzly bears or
lions. He was telling me, he said,

1316
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,150
I don't get bit because the
lion of the grizzly bear,

1317
01:13:59,151 --> 01:14:00,200
if he's in an irritable mood,

1318
01:14:00,201 --> 01:14:05,180
is going to tell me three minutes
beforehand when he's going to attack and

1319
01:14:05,181 --> 01:14:07,040
people that don't know animals,
the ones that get attacked,

1320
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:09,140
he said when a grizzly bears
having a hard time with you,

1321
01:14:09,141 --> 01:14:12,250
he'll start clicking his jaw.
The minute he, his jaw training

1322
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:15,880
sessions over baby that it's done.
And lions are the same way.

1323
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:19,860
They start giving you signals
way, way before, and they're
subtle signals, but you,

1324
01:14:19,861 --> 01:14:21,970
if you don't know how to read them,
you're in big trouble.

1325
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:25,320
If you do know how to read them, step off
so you're not a horse whisperer bitch.

1326
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:29,280
It seems like the reading the
mind like mine reading of the bed,

1327
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:33,830
it's just the very well
boasting in Beth psychology.

1328
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:38,110
Cesar Milan guy,
that guy kicks dogs.

1329
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,570
We've ever seen him kicked dogs.
Yeah, like this with the nines.

1330
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:43,090
Not that I'm thinking there's
anything wrong with kicking some dogs,

1331
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:49,480
but he checks him hard dude. But I'm
saying is he's very good at training dogs.

1332
01:14:49,481 --> 01:14:51,130
And I'm not saying that
what he does is wrong.

1333
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:55,870
What I'm saying is he ain't psychic.
He's not whisper nice fucking dogs right

1334
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:00,790
now. He does. He tells people all the
time, cause you got to keep to yourself.

1335
01:15:00,791 --> 01:15:03,160
He said, yes, I'm here to train
you. I'm not hearing the dog's fine.

1336
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:06,070
Dog tries to bite people and
attacks don't reflection.

1337
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:08,230
It's actually you're the problem too.

1338
01:15:08,231 --> 01:15:10,420
Like when you talk to talking about
your friend who's like a sniper,

1339
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:11,380
I bet you had,

1340
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,770
there's sort of certain
pattern recognition to people
that are experiencing a

1341
01:15:14,771 --> 01:15:18,430
massive dump of adrenaline. I
go the the, the way they move,

1342
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:22,240
there's probably an erratic nature to
the movement of a person who's, you know,

1343
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:26,950
literally at death's door. That's, that's
gotta be an insanely intense experience.

1344
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:30,430
And I bet if you've seen
that from a person and you're
like, oh Jesus, you know,

1345
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:35,431
you see like a guy who was high on the
adrenaline of about being about to do

1346
01:15:35,471 --> 01:15:36,304
something.
Yeah.

1347
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:39,370
I mean if you're looking at a guy was a
suicide bomber or something along those

1348
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:42,730
lines, like could you
imagine what that the sweat,

1349
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:46,030
they train the TSA to look
for those signs. Oh yeah,

1350
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:48,730
and it's really better to look
then those fucking cracks.

1351
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:53,860
He's cracked scientists and detective
crack commandos. Those, those people.

1352
01:15:53,861 --> 01:15:58,570
A Johnny on the spot at the TSA job. If
you've seen this line attack video. Yes.

1353
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:02,350
Yeah. Have you put it on if you want.
I think it's pretty fucked up, right?

1354
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:02,820
I've seen it.

1355
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:05,330
Mall. Yeah. They fuck this guy up

1356
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,020
and look at the girl holds the ground.

1357
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:13,850
The girl is the only thing I saved
this ditch. That guy got fucked up.

1358
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:19,130
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

1359
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:24,420
They're squirting them with a hose
and pointing him with sticks. Yeah,

1360
01:16:24,421 --> 01:16:29,060
you have to. I know, but the
fuck else did they have to man,

1361
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:33,270
that's their gig. Bitch. You're fired.

1362
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,450
Hindsight. The fight to
the, you know what, man,

1363
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:40,380
I don't believe that line should be held
in captivity. I agree with you on that.

1364
01:16:40,381 --> 01:16:43,020
I certainly don't believe that they should
be held in captivity and forced to do

1365
01:16:43,021 --> 01:16:46,680
tricks.
I think that's utter total bullshit.

1366
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:49,620
Stupidity,
insanity.

1367
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:55,200
I think if you want to keep them in
large preserves where they can roam free,

1368
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:58,880
that's one thing, but guess
what? Feed them animals.

1369
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:02,480
If you're going to have them
somewhere in any form of, Oh shit.

1370
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:10,540
That is terrifying. Man. Really has.

1371
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:16,280
Yeah. Now they'd liked doing that. Now
they found out fun. That can be, yeah,

1372
01:17:16,281 --> 01:17:19,820
that's right. Your food. Oh my God.

1373
01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:23,900
Lions going be pushed so far, man.
Look at that too. Gfe fucked up.

1374
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:25,970
Oh my God.

1375
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:32,410
This is such an insane place to be
poking a stick at fucking lions.

1376
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:34,550
Oh,
he got jacked again.

1377
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:42,110
Oh my God.
What a nightmare must be for those people.

1378
01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:45,050
You got to get out. Boy. That shit girl.

1379
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:49,160
She's pulling her brown and the
lines aren't fucking with her man.

1380
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:52,430
He must be the bad guy. Yeah.
These guys must be dicks

1381
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:58,200
cannot have that case. That's total
speculation and very rude of me to,

1382
01:17:58,201 --> 01:18:02,180
I should say guys getting attacked by
animals. I'm adding insult to injury.

1383
01:18:02,930 --> 01:18:07,100
Why we wouldn't him up. I Dunno. I'm
just being silly. I don't mean anything.

1384
01:18:07,101 --> 01:18:08,330
I'm saying trying to be entertaining,

1385
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:12,140
but it's kind of like that movie zookeeper
that you were in jail when that one

1386
01:18:12,141 --> 01:18:15,410
guy was being mean to the gorilla. I
remember. Yeah. That's sort of the Cliche,

1387
01:18:15,411 --> 01:18:15,960
right?

1388
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,600
Sort of like the evil stepmother. Right.
You know that the, the zookeepers,

1389
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:20,840
we're always Dick's to the animals.

1390
01:18:20,841 --> 01:18:25,140
There's always ones who keep a
realism like animals. You as, sorry.

1391
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:28,580
Yeah. This span of check cat, um,

1392
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:33,020
he blew my mind and really changed the
way I look at a lot of what I thought was

1393
01:18:33,021 --> 01:18:36,740
like psychic stuff and I really,
really set into my head.

1394
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:41,950
I still leave open the door for things
that I don't have the abilities that I

1395
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:43,550
don't possess.
I don't know.

1396
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:47,310
I don't know if we've completely
explored the boundaries of,

1397
01:18:47,311 --> 01:18:48,440
of human possibility.

1398
01:18:48,441 --> 01:18:52,400
And I also don't know if what is possible
today is going to be with the possible

1399
01:18:52,401 --> 01:18:54,050
five years from now or 10 years from now.

1400
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:59,150
I think that if human beings got to
this point through adaptation, through,

1401
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:03,450
you know, natural advantage, we got to
all the things that we possess. You know,

1402
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:06,380
the ability to see,
touch and feel and hear and smell.

1403
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:11,330
Why would I assume that there wouldn't
be some sort of new thing that comes

1404
01:19:11,331 --> 01:19:16,040
after that? I think if he does come,
he's going to be meditation. Yes.

1405
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:17,330
It's not going to be from evolution.

1406
01:19:17,331 --> 01:19:21,050
It's going to be good because actually
modifying our bodies to gate implant.

1407
01:19:21,051 --> 01:19:23,120
We'll give you telepathy.
It could be, you know,

1408
01:19:23,121 --> 01:19:26,030
there was an article that I tweeted,
yes,

1409
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:28,430
there was an article I tweeted
about Google that was like, you,

1410
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:29,870
you're going to be able
to have an implant.

1411
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:33,560
There are ultimate goal of the Google
glass is to be able to have an implant and

1412
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:36,740
when you have a thought in your mind
stated that is their stated goal.

1413
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:39,770
That's right. That's right. Yeah.

1414
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:42,200
People are evolving themselves.

1415
01:19:42,201 --> 01:19:44,630
It's like normally pollution has
stopped for humans. Right, but let me,

1416
01:19:44,631 --> 01:19:46,160
let me take it from a different angle.

1417
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:50,600
Isn't that also natural evolution and
natural evolution by a human being

1418
01:19:50,601 --> 01:19:54,800
augmenting his body with artificial
technology is still a part of the actual

1419
01:19:54,801 --> 01:19:59,480
evolution of the species is just figured
out how to bypass the normal slow steps

1420
01:19:59,481 --> 01:20:01,520
of the biological genetic evolution.

1421
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:04,100
It's an eight some shit
with the imagination,

1422
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:08,310
the imagination that lives
inside the biological entity
news, its own limitation.

1423
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,050
I think it's an inevitable consequence
of like intelligent species are solving

1424
01:20:13,051 --> 01:20:13,781
but it's,

1425
01:20:13,781 --> 01:20:18,210
it's completely different but then again
it's still is another path that was

1426
01:20:18,211 --> 01:20:22,230
taken by nature the same way a be
making a beehive got to happen.

1427
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:23,710
It's sort of like a natural

1428
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:25,661
want to tweak.

1429
01:20:25,661 --> 01:20:29,950
This gives an amazing talk about it on
ted.com about how when they invent an

1430
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:32,650
artificial eye that can see a mile away,

1431
01:20:32,651 --> 01:20:37,240
see during the night and
it's biocompatible and an
ear that does the same thing

1432
01:20:37,241 --> 01:20:39,100
and a Nano Bot the size
of red blood cells.

1433
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:42,970
You're going to use those things and
we are going to mesh with machines way

1434
01:20:42,971 --> 01:20:44,650
sooner than we will ever evolve.

1435
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:47,650
It's coming. Yeah, and I bet the
first thing is going to be dicks.

1436
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:50,800
It's going to be artificial. There's
no doubt you're going to be s you know,

1437
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,380
and I haven't been able to figure that
out yet to be able to figure it out.

1438
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:57,490
Erections, he'd been able to figure
out Rogaine keeping some of your hair.

1439
01:20:57,491 --> 01:20:58,900
There's a few things are still working on,

1440
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:02,320
but if soon as they could figure
out a way to actually grow dicks,

1441
01:21:02,350 --> 01:21:05,100
that's it because that's how you're
going to do that with their doing with

1442
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,210
breasts.
There's studies right now going,

1443
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:12,320
they're cloning how to manipulate tissue
so that the woman will grow natural

1444
01:21:12,641 --> 01:21:14,650
breasts with stem cells I think.
Yeah,

1445
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:17,350
well I don't know the
exact a process work guys,

1446
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:20,800
but they're going to try to figure
out, yeah, I guess I got it.

1447
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:24,920
Gross. Some tips to these guys, these
training transgenders. Yes. Good boy.

1448
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:28,650
Good cat are going to be have some great
titties, Sunni and maybe extra dicks.

1449
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:29,820
I think that also there

1450
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,180
we're going to be a full,
like complete x,

1451
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:37,290
y chromosome woman, like as much of
a full complete woman as you can get.

1452
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,050
Like they'll be able to
genetically engineer a vagina.

1453
01:21:40,051 --> 01:21:43,230
They won't have to be some sort of a
thing that you're making out of a penis.

1454
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:45,350
In the future. You're going to be, uh,

1455
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:48,420
like you might have still keep your
chromosomes. It might still be an x,

1456
01:21:48,421 --> 01:21:52,560
y chromosomes, but you will essentially
be 100% female in every way.

1457
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:57,140
So would you hit it like if, if she had
the best pussy, the best real issue,

1458
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,820
it'd be a real issue. Well, you
know, Progressive Society, right?

1459
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:03,360
I'd like you to admit that that
is a real woman, right? Asshole.

1460
01:22:03,361 --> 01:22:07,170
And they would say that asshole, she is
a real woman. If she became a real woman,

1461
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:10,290
would you hit it? She is a real
woman asshole. Yeah. Those,

1462
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:13,240
there is a thing genetically a man.
But you know, they're not the, the,

1463
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:17,820
the progressive opinion is that you're,
you shouldn't even have to divulge that.

1464
01:22:17,821 --> 01:22:21,570
You used to be a man. That's
your medical history, warrior

1465
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:24,660
princess. And I'm having him on my
podcast, her on my podcast, Kristin Beck,

1466
01:22:24,661 --> 01:22:28,540
who was Chris back who was a member
of seal team six Dev grew, uh,

1467
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:33,610
and a and fascinating book
because he was all she but,

1468
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,910
but when she was a, he, uh,

1469
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:40,920
always felt like a girl always and goes
into why he thinks that's the case.

1470
01:22:40,921 --> 01:22:42,480
Some of it had to do with
the way he was raised,

1471
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:46,320
but also it was just the way he felt.
AndG and literally as,

1472
01:22:46,321 --> 01:22:48,480
as when he was even a very small kid,

1473
01:22:48,481 --> 01:22:52,710
was always stealing his sister's clothes
and wearing them and just always felt

1474
01:22:52,711 --> 01:22:56,910
like woman joins the seal teams in seal
team six to push what he calls his inner

1475
01:22:56,911 --> 01:23:00,000
girl down.
Come back after training.

1476
01:23:00,001 --> 01:23:04,710
It would roar back in full like a TB back
for two months. He'd be on a sailboat,

1477
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:08,140
dress like a woman every single day.
And this is a elite commando,

1478
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:12,490
a decorated war hero. And by the way,
a war veteran by the, by the way. Yes.

1479
01:23:12,550 --> 01:23:17,410
And also had done 13 deployments and I
believe still works for the Department of

1480
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:21,210
Defense now that he's Kristin Beck. Can't
wait to get her on my podcast to talk.

1481
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:22,690
That was another extended plug.

1482
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:27,870
It was not [inaudible] she taught you
son of a bitch number one and two by the

1483
01:23:28,181 --> 01:23:32,500
way. Yeah, I ended plugged
us point Brian Talent show.

1484
01:23:32,501 --> 01:23:36,730
It's on the iTunes. That's right. But, but
the point is that it was when, when you,

1485
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:41,790
when you read this book and you realize
how strong the urge to be a woman was

1486
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:46,630
and then she went ahead and
got this whole operation,

1487
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:50,010
which is a major thing and by the way,

1488
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,220
and took so much flak for it. I,
you know, in a way, I mean it just,

1489
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:57,610
it was something, she just have
Jewish black jacket. What's that?

1490
01:23:57,820 --> 01:24:01,780
Perhaps you'd get her a flak jacket.
It was real protective from flack from,

1491
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:07,600
thank you. I'm going to open with that
this weekend. And Bria, that was a plug.

1492
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:10,210
See, that's how you do a plug.
That's good. I won't, I will.

1493
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:14,950
I will not be opening with that
when I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina.

1494
01:24:14,951 --> 01:24:16,210
And I would never,

1495
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,750
I would've never guessed to know
what goes on inside someone's body.

1496
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:23,770
If someone tells me they were born a
woman and they really are a man who the

1497
01:24:23,771 --> 01:24:24,604
fuck.

1498
01:24:24,610 --> 01:24:27,400
Let me ask you to tell them.
That's not the case.

1499
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:31,870
But here's my question to you is you
have to say this MMA fighter, uh, who,

1500
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:36,750
who is now has gotten this,
this sex change. But yeah,
I've talked to Matt, I kept

1501
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:41,750
so many times and I've also been in
like enraging Twitter discussions with

1502
01:24:42,571 --> 01:24:45,880
people. You know, I have
to go through the, my,

1503
01:24:45,881 --> 01:24:49,680
my feeling is I absolutely support
anyone who wants to be a transgender,

1504
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:53,610
but I think there is a real
issue with combat sports.

1505
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:58,970
I don't necessarily believe that there
has been enough studies done that show

1506
01:24:59,101 --> 01:25:03,030
that the male frame, it's not a
significant advantage to have the male,

1507
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,640
the mechanics of the different shape tips,

1508
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:09,630
there's far less likelihood
of ACL injuries for men
just be because of the shape

1509
01:25:09,631 --> 01:25:11,670
of the hips.
And these are small issues.

1510
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:15,060
A big one is reaction time
in measurable reaction time.

1511
01:25:15,061 --> 01:25:20,061
Men have shown a 10% 10% faster reaction
time almost across the board with the

1512
01:25:20,111 --> 01:25:22,380
lead athletes. Wow. 10% faster than women.

1513
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:26,040
That's a big issue with striking a
really big issue and even though they're

1514
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:29,790
swimming that can get to a skill
level that will overcompensate that.

1515
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:34,500
I think that alone seems to me,
unless you can replicate that somewhere,

1516
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,500
uh, healthfully for,
for women, like it was,

1517
01:25:37,501 --> 01:25:40,890
if there was something that women could
take that would bring their natural

1518
01:25:40,891 --> 01:25:44,370
reaction levels to where a man is that
I don't think it can ever be safe.

1519
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:48,920
I think if a guy's an elite guy and a
girls and elite girl and the guy has a one

1520
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:53,340
10th of a second quicker reaction time,
that's gigantic.

1521
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,570
So that alone, and this is not an a
transphobic argument to me because I'm,

1522
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:02,940
it's completely open minded as you can be.
I try very hard to look at things.

1523
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:06,800
Everybody's different point of view and
I have zero issue with anyone wanting to

1524
01:26:06,801 --> 01:26:10,640
change their gender. Zero. I
think I'll call you a woman.

1525
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,020
You know,

1526
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:16,700
my issue only lies in combat sports
cause I just don't think it's fair.

1527
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:19,910
And you know, there was an
argument in a good one in fact,

1528
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,730
that I've considered as well
that several people have said,

1529
01:26:22,731 --> 01:26:26,030
well what about women who are naturally
more aggressive or naturally have more

1530
01:26:26,031 --> 01:26:26,864
testosterone?

1531
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:31,370
Like Serena Williams who's a natural
one but a really big powerful athlete.

1532
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:33,560
It's a very good point because there's,

1533
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:36,290
there's women that are not going to be
able to compete with her physically if

1534
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:39,770
they have the same skills, you know,
the same level of technical proficiency.

1535
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:43,800
Pete, with her, the same argument
they were talking about where one,

1536
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:45,000
I think it was more as Korean.

1537
01:26:45,030 --> 01:26:48,510
Maurice Greene has an inordinate number
of amount of testosterone in this blood

1538
01:26:48,511 --> 01:26:50,790
naturally occurring,
whereas another sprinter does not.

1539
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:55,770
So then nature is unfair in that sense.
Certainly. I'm so, so now where's that?

1540
01:26:55,771 --> 01:26:59,460
So if he has 300 mil, whatever milligrams,
I don't know how to measure it,

1541
01:26:59,461 --> 01:27:03,720
but say 300 parts per million and the
other guy has a hundred parts per million,

1542
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:08,480
what would it be acceptable for
him then to take hormone test

1543
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:09,981
question?
Yeah,

1544
01:27:09,981 --> 01:27:12,990
it's a good question and that's a
question that's actually recently been

1545
01:27:12,991 --> 01:27:15,420
proposed by MMA fighters that are saying,
well listen,

1546
01:27:15,690 --> 01:27:18,000
if these people are on
testosterone replacement therapy,

1547
01:27:18,001 --> 01:27:19,440
everybody should be allowed to be on it.

1548
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:23,370
As long as your levels are
the same like your your,

1549
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:26,850
because these people are taking t
the look. If they have an issue,

1550
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:28,740
they're taking testosterone.

1551
01:27:28,741 --> 01:27:33,390
It's jacking them up to a very high level
that very few people maintain at their

1552
01:27:33,391 --> 01:27:35,640
age limit,
but that's the acceptable limit.

1553
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,110
That's not very scientific to me because
I feel like there's always going to be

1554
01:27:40,111 --> 01:27:41,960
people that have a natural
level that's very high,

1555
01:27:41,961 --> 01:27:46,200
that gets beaten down during training
and it's not going to care the same way

1556
01:27:46,201 --> 01:27:49,110
and the person that's using
indogenous chemicals, so that's,

1557
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:50,790
there's an issue with that.

1558
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:53,820
There's an issue that I think is
not been fully completely resolved.

1559
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:57,540
That's why sanctioning is by a state,
by state basis, a case by case basis.

1560
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:02,010
It's not like testosterone replacement
therapy is not like uniformly accepted

1561
01:28:02,011 --> 01:28:05,100
across the board. In fact, in
some places like a fighter's,

1562
01:28:05,101 --> 01:28:08,050
if I had to go and fight
like a in Winnipeg, um,

1563
01:28:08,051 --> 01:28:11,610
I'm pretty sure Rashad Evans who was
on it had to get, or not Rashad Evans,

1564
01:28:11,611 --> 01:28:12,060
excuse me,

1565
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:16,260
Dan Henderson who was on it had to get
off of it because they wouldn't allow him

1566
01:28:16,261 --> 01:28:20,670
to take testosterone replacement and and
finding Canada now so that the UFC has

1567
01:28:20,671 --> 01:28:23,280
a limit to what your testosterone,
the UFC,

1568
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:28,560
it's the state with UFC is just to promote
her. We are not the athletic bodies,

1569
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:32,430
so the Nevada state athletic commission,
they look at things that way,

1570
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:36,270
but I think like scientifically we have
to agree that it's a real issue as far

1571
01:28:36,271 --> 01:28:38,870
as a performance enhancer.
It's very significant. It's,

1572
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:40,380
it gives you a significant advantage.

1573
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:45,360
And then also you have to realize what's
next when they do have these nanobots

1574
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:50,040
nanobots I like I said that it's like,
when you say Afghanistan cost,

1575
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:56,280
there's no new boats when they do have
these things and you're taking a mic and

1576
01:28:56,281 --> 01:28:58,800
just so he could hold your breath at
the bottom of a pool and make a youtube

1577
01:28:58,801 --> 01:29:00,830
video for five hours,
you know,

1578
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:03,310
that's what they're gonna be able to do
according to Ray Kurzweil. Yeah. Yeah.

1579
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:06,010
Well, well, who would,
who wouldn't take that?

1580
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:10,290
What are you crazy about the Olympics
too and when you got to swim or who

1581
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:15,030
doesn't have to lift his head and
he showers for it? We shattered at,

1582
01:29:15,031 --> 01:29:19,590
but I think that in the
idea of keeping sport pure,

1583
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:21,630
you can't hold back to evolution.

1584
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,980
And there's an evolution
that we don't want to accept.

1585
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,170
It's a symbiotic evolution of humans
and technology to create the new human.

1586
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,840
You know, it's, it's fucking
happening whether you like it or not.

1587
01:29:30,841 --> 01:29:34,680
Samsung has a new watch now that
tells you how fast your heart rate is,

1588
01:29:34,681 --> 01:29:35,400
all the shit that's going on.

1589
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:39,240
How many calories you burn hill each
day syncs up to your smart phone. Yeah.

1590
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:42,810
How long before that things just embedded
in your skin, you know, how long,

1591
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,980
how long before they, they'd take your
ear, your shitty designed ear. Oh,

1592
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:47,814
you got an earache.

1593
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:50,920
How about we replace it with this carbon
fiber thing that can hear on the moon?

1594
01:29:51,690 --> 01:29:55,170
It's calming. It's calming. And
if if you say no, you're stupid,

1595
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,960
you just as stupid as someone who
doesn't get their bone bone fixed,

1596
01:29:57,961 --> 01:30:00,510
when it breaks, it's going to come with
its own challenges, that's for sure. Oh,

1597
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:01,141
absolutely.

1598
01:30:01,141 --> 01:30:03,720
Just like everything else we've ever
done in life has come with challenges.

1599
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:05,570
I think the big thing is when we, uh, we,

1600
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:10,750
we get aging addressed by these doctors
and people start living like a hundred

1601
01:30:10,751 --> 01:30:11,650
to 200 years.

1602
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:14,580
Yes. That'd be a big problem.
And that's not far away

1603
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:19,140
than 50 year old man has
already been born. Uh,

1604
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:21,750
first hundred days a are
likely person. Yeah. It's,

1605
01:30:21,751 --> 01:30:24,360
to me it's absolutely and
completely fascinating.

1606
01:30:24,361 --> 01:30:29,140
This incredible time of change and this
incredible time of possibility. The,

1607
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:32,520
the openings are just so much greater
now than they've ever been before.

1608
01:30:32,521 --> 01:30:34,050
As far as the possibility for change,

1609
01:30:34,270 --> 01:30:39,270
a giant waves of change that will make
the world almost impossible to comprehend

1610
01:30:40,051 --> 01:30:42,690
to us right now as it's freakish,

1611
01:30:42,691 --> 01:30:45,540
as the Internet is for us today.

1612
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:50,690
I think what's going to be next in the
next four or 500 years is going to blow

1613
01:30:50,881 --> 01:30:54,930
all this away. If we manage to stay alive,
we managed to not blow ourselves up.

1614
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,950
I think they're going to
resolve so many issues.

1615
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:03,230
Environmental issues, social
issues, the the, the, the,

1616
01:31:03,231 --> 01:31:07,170
the structure of society, the,
the, the way we distribute money,

1617
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:10,710
all these things are there.
An echo of a shitty,

1618
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:15,740
ignorant time and we're stuck with a lot
of really crummy fucking infrastructure

1619
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:20,930
and a really crummy system of doing things
and a really crummy representation of

1620
01:31:21,361 --> 01:31:23,790
the humans that are living on this planet.

1621
01:31:23,970 --> 01:31:26,130
As far as the distribution of resources,

1622
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:28,980
the acclamation of accumulation of wealth,

1623
01:31:29,190 --> 01:31:32,220
I think we're going to figure all that
out in the future. It may be three,

1624
01:31:32,221 --> 01:31:36,090
four generations from now, but when
we figure out all our social shit,

1625
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:40,140
if we figure out that at the same time
they figured out a way to actually use

1626
01:31:40,141 --> 01:31:44,370
pollution for energy,
keep the world clean with technology.

1627
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:47,680
That's something that people don't look
at as a possibility that a technology

1628
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:49,180
though, he's going to go
ahead of the social change,

1629
01:31:49,181 --> 01:31:50,470
so you're going to get
this new technology,

1630
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:53,050
but you're going to have the same old
social structures that you had before and

1631
01:31:53,051 --> 01:31:54,550
that's going to create this huge complex.

1632
01:31:54,551 --> 01:31:56,950
Where are you going to have this kind of
a technological elite to be still going

1633
01:31:56,951 --> 01:32:00,100
to have these masses of people
who are just in the old ways?

1634
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:02,290
It could be,
but I don't think it has to be.

1635
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:07,770
I think there's a very distinct feeling
that I get from Oh from communicating

1636
01:32:08,081 --> 01:32:11,500
with people over the last
few years that people,

1637
01:32:11,501 --> 01:32:16,210
more people are paying more attention
to the way the world is run than ever

1638
01:32:16,211 --> 01:32:19,030
before. More people are getting
more sensitive about inequality.

1639
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:21,220
Then I feel like I felt in a long time,

1640
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:25,000
Steven Pinker's book said that in the
two thousands less people were killed

1641
01:32:25,001 --> 01:32:27,040
violently than at any time in our history.

1642
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:30,670
So there and another guy wrote a book
called the rational optimist to be read

1643
01:32:30,671 --> 01:32:34,870
that in a very good book. Matt Ridley, I
think his name and to um, same idea, just,

1644
01:32:34,871 --> 01:32:38,860
just where we're headed there is there
is progress that the way you're talking

1645
01:32:38,861 --> 01:32:40,930
about more sort of,
uh,

1646
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:46,050
I guess transparency and people not as
ignorant people at least having more

1647
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:47,230
access to information.
Yeah.

1648
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:51,100
I don't think there's any evidence that
points that people are going to continue

1649
01:32:51,101 --> 01:32:55,270
to remain ignorant in the face of so
much access to information that we have

1650
01:32:55,271 --> 01:32:58,750
today. I mean, it's just the, this
is a completely different world.

1651
01:32:58,751 --> 01:33:03,100
The kids that are born in the last three
or four years are growing up in a world

1652
01:33:03,130 --> 01:33:05,440
that we couldn't even fucking imagine.

1653
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:10,240
My little kid knows how to go on to
iTunes and order more points for the game

1654
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:15,190
that she likes. She's five. I was
thinking of how to go to Itunes,

1655
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:19,480
add in this mommy, what's your password?
Dik Dik dik dik dik she's fucking five.

1656
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,760
You know, when you try to follow
the thread, if you were to,

1657
01:33:21,761 --> 01:33:23,260
if you were to say in seven generations,

1658
01:33:23,261 --> 01:33:26,660
it feels like we're being pushed to
move beyond our basic biology. Yes.

1659
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:28,330
That's what it feels like.
And so,

1660
01:33:28,331 --> 01:33:33,331
so if you were to able to download
information into one's brain or even

1661
01:33:33,731 --> 01:33:34,261
reversed,

1662
01:33:34,261 --> 01:33:37,600
download the information in your brain
into something as we were talking about,

1663
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:42,100
um, then the question
becomes to what end is that?

1664
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:45,340
I've been trying to follow that thread.
Why, what, what goes on? Say we are,

1665
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:49,360
cause you, if you could tap into a
neural net, have virtual experiences,

1666
01:33:49,361 --> 01:33:51,540
what it is to be someone else, uh, and,

1667
01:33:51,541 --> 01:33:55,900
and we just get nudged closer and closer
together in this sort of one sort of

1668
01:33:55,901 --> 01:33:59,290
mind, if you will. Which I
think is not far fetched.

1669
01:33:59,291 --> 01:34:01,570
I mean it's kind of where
we're headed now is editable.

1670
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:06,070
I can do standup now and you
know, uh, California in New York,

1671
01:34:06,071 --> 01:34:08,900
it's kind of the same audience. It
used to be very, very different. We're,

1672
01:34:08,901 --> 01:34:09,780
we're starting to,
you know,

1673
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:12,760
you can go do stand up and
you just go selfish with that.

1674
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:14,710
I did talking about the unification.

1675
01:34:14,711 --> 01:34:18,640
All tire stand up dude and you're
talking to audiences to Raleigh,

1676
01:34:18,641 --> 01:34:22,210
North Carolina. No son of
a bitch. No, but are you,

1677
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,990
but I wonder then what do you
think is the end result though?

1678
01:34:25,991 --> 01:34:28,120
What do you think is where to,
where are we going with that?

1679
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:32,580
The theory is like the singularity is
that all of humanity and it'll technology

1680
01:34:32,581 --> 01:34:33,940
with combined into this one thing,

1681
01:34:34,530 --> 01:34:38,320
but I think it's going to be a remarkable
set of circumstances that would have

1682
01:34:38,321 --> 01:34:41,080
to happen for that to come about.
I think it's inevitable.

1683
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:43,810
I think that remarkable set of
circumstances is inevitable.

1684
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:47,320
We're not going to stop if it takes
five years or 500 years, I don't know.

1685
01:34:47,321 --> 01:34:48,490
I don't know how long it's going to tank,

1686
01:34:48,491 --> 01:34:52,780
but if innovation continues
to move forward in the same
exponential exponential

1687
01:34:52,781 --> 01:34:56,080
rate of progression that it's shown
below the plummet. He said, well,

1688
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:58,100
I don't like that.
It's just that that's

1689
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:58,933
one.

1690
01:34:58,970 --> 01:35:03,130
The other ones that are way bigger are
the natural ones like the hundreds of

1691
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:08,060
thousands of near Earth objects that could
be fucking zooming at us 45,000 miles

1692
01:35:08,061 --> 01:35:11,540
an hour from behind the sun and those
things are going to slam into us. Again,

1693
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:16,300
it's happened before. It was a lot of
recent information that shows that uh,

1694
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:21,200
more than 10,000 years ago there was a
a series of major impacts all throughout

1695
01:35:21,201 --> 01:35:21,800
the world.

1696
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:26,240
They found volcanic glass all throughout
Asia and Europe that indicates meteor

1697
01:35:26,241 --> 01:35:28,850
showers.
They got that Clovis comment that they've,

1698
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:33,410
they've now confirmed hit that
somewhere around 12,500 years ago.

1699
01:35:33,620 --> 01:35:37,990
These are like not that big a
gap between us in that, yeah,

1700
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:39,170
that's not that long ago,

1701
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:43,550
12,000 years ago there was like some
extinction events like North America was

1702
01:35:43,551 --> 01:35:48,070
wiped out. Like that's happened and it's
just some shit that comes out of the sky

1703
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:49,760
climate change. They're just, yes,

1704
01:35:49,770 --> 01:35:52,980
that's going to be a slow death of
civilization if slow death of Miami.

1705
01:35:53,010 --> 01:35:57,360
That's for function. As a skeptic, are
you, I'm a believer in global warming.

1706
01:35:57,420 --> 01:35:58,650
You hear a lot of people saying,
well,

1707
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,890
the science behind is
really solid that there is,

1708
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:06,210
there has been warming over the last a
hundred years and man is behind it. Uh,

1709
01:36:06,211 --> 01:36:08,130
so the question is like, you
know, what do you do about it?

1710
01:36:08,410 --> 01:36:10,320
Yeah, that gets obscured with the, um,

1711
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:13,780
the argument that it's a natural
cycle because that's true.

1712
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,700
There is a natural cycle of heating,

1713
01:36:15,701 --> 01:36:19,600
cooling and there have been times before
people like the ice age when you know,

1714
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:22,870
North America had a mile high sheet
of ice, a part of it, you know,

1715
01:36:22,871 --> 01:36:25,420
there was a big chunk of this country,
there was a glacier,

1716
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:31,290
but that maybe have changed without human
interaction or human intervention or

1717
01:36:31,301 --> 01:36:32,350
human causation.

1718
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:36,280
But that doesn't mean that this is like
the idea that just because the earth's

1719
01:36:36,281 --> 01:36:38,530
temperature fluctuates doesn't
mean that we don't influence it.

1720
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,390
Like it's pretty obvious we influence it.

1721
01:36:40,391 --> 01:36:44,680
You'd have to be crazy to fly above the
city and look at how many fucking planes

1722
01:36:44,860 --> 01:36:49,270
are criss crossing this guys and how
much smog is down there and you fly over

1723
01:36:49,271 --> 01:36:53,320
cities and see the pollution. To think
that's having no impact is just silly.

1724
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:54,390
Yeah.
It's just silly.

1725
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:56,830
And when it was saying that
about the science being solid it,

1726
01:36:56,860 --> 01:37:00,260
so maybe think of what I said earlier
about the chem trail. People that they,

1727
01:37:00,270 --> 01:37:02,580
they, they have a similar kind of
point of view about chem trails.

1728
01:37:02,581 --> 01:37:04,110
They think the science is solid,

1729
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:08,160
but we think the science is
solid on global climate change.

1730
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:09,960
And that perception of what I'm saying,

1731
01:37:09,961 --> 01:37:13,380
it's going to be the exactly the same
as my perception of as that of them

1732
01:37:13,890 --> 01:37:18,000
the science of what is, you
know, what they're pointing
to. Some of it is so nutty.

1733
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:20,220
And one of the ones that I argued with,

1734
01:37:20,221 --> 01:37:23,700
this guy created the documentary was
straight off of your site and we went to

1735
01:37:23,701 --> 01:37:28,260
nick site and make, has this, um,
thing on his site where it shows,

1736
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:32,430
um, the study that this gentleman
was quoting and his documentary,

1737
01:37:32,431 --> 01:37:35,100
it shows the results of the soil sample.
Well,

1738
01:37:35,101 --> 01:37:39,720
the sludge sample that he was saying
was a water sample. And so, um,

1739
01:37:39,721 --> 01:37:43,410
while I'm going over this information
with him and he's assuring me of the

1740
01:37:43,411 --> 01:37:47,610
veracity of these tests, and I know what
this guy told me that this is water,

1741
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:52,080
but it says on the sample sludge.
And so we test,

1742
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:57,090
we test this stuff and we read the
results of the, and it says, you know,

1743
01:37:57,091 --> 01:37:59,550
x amount of aluminum
and x amount of barrels.

1744
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:04,520
It basically has the same composition
as what a lot of dirt has. Like you've,

1745
01:38:04,521 --> 01:38:07,440
you scooped up some dirt, you're
going to find a lot of aluminum in it.

1746
01:38:07,441 --> 01:38:10,310
It's like a really natural occurring 7%.

1747
01:38:10,470 --> 01:38:14,820
It's an amazing amount cause it's like
savvy were eliminating. Wow. Yeah.

1748
01:38:14,821 --> 01:38:17,850
It's one of the most common minerals.
So I say to this guy like,

1749
01:38:17,851 --> 01:38:19,260
do you understand that
you're saying that your,

1750
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:23,010
your dirt tested positive for being dirt.
That's what this says.

1751
01:38:23,011 --> 01:38:26,340
Like that's crazy. But that is the
best piece of evidence at Chem.

1752
01:38:26,341 --> 01:38:29,790
Trails are real, you know, so everyone's
saying like the high levels of aluminum,

1753
01:38:29,791 --> 01:38:33,630
high levels of Barium, Lou
aluminum is everywhere. Okay.

1754
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:35,040
It's fucking everywhere.

1755
01:38:35,041 --> 01:38:37,770
And if you knew that we wouldn't
be having this discussion.

1756
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:41,700
If you knew that aluminum was in
dirt all over the fucking world,

1757
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:43,980
you wouldn't be worried about
people spraying it from the sky.

1758
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:48,090
Why would they do that? It's everywhere.
It's everywhere. And if it was in the sky,

1759
01:38:48,091 --> 01:38:49,560
and this is what really got me annoyed,

1760
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:54,920
talked to many people that believe that
those clouds are aluminum and you know

1761
01:38:56,161 --> 01:38:57,990
something else like floating in the air.

1762
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,870
But if you talk to anybody
who's actually seen aluminum,

1763
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:02,820
it wouldn't look anything
like a fucking cloud.

1764
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:05,520
It wouldn't look like a cloud
and it wouldn't stay in the air,

1765
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:10,110
wouldn't just float there. It's got
weight to it. It's not mist like, well,

1766
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:14,820
you're looking at is actual clouds. It's
not like, like when they sky, right,

1767
01:39:14,970 --> 01:39:15,840
that's smoke.

1768
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:21,090
But even that doesn't last
dissipates when they fly over in a,

1769
01:39:21,091 --> 01:39:22,460
in a, you know, and you see like a,

1770
01:39:22,461 --> 01:39:26,100
a big fat heavy contrail that
that's a fucking cloud man.

1771
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:28,710
That's not aluminum.
That's a cloud.

1772
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:31,070
Yeah. And it's not even really
coming out of the back of the plane.

1773
01:39:31,071 --> 01:39:34,130
The plane is just triggering it.
It's making a cloud for and by just

1774
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:39,120
just the spray, not a little condensed.
Haven't documented on my website info.

1775
01:39:39,130 --> 01:39:43,450
[inaudible] dot com we've got
high high resolution photographs.

1776
01:39:43,451 --> 01:39:44,284
Brian Callan,

1777
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:48,610
they're spraying your children
with Boron and lithium.

1778
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:52,990
What's your stance on tower seven?
Uh, where do you want to know?

1779
01:39:53,170 --> 01:39:55,630
Because that's one of the things
that drives me the most crazy.

1780
01:39:55,631 --> 01:39:58,880
I just how much it's like, please stop,
you know, uh, do you, do you think,

1781
01:39:58,930 --> 01:39:59,331
wait a minute,

1782
01:39:59,331 --> 01:40:02,230
it drives you the most crazy that people
talk about it as a conspiracy? Yeah.

1783
01:40:02,710 --> 01:40:03,850
Why is it driving me crazy?

1784
01:40:03,940 --> 01:40:08,710
Because it's just like people thinking
that it was exploded to eighth.

1785
01:40:08,770 --> 01:40:12,940
Do you believe? I think it just caught
fire and the collapse. Yeah. Now I,

1786
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:17,680
the heat that it says it made, there's
some people saying that it was, you know,

1787
01:40:17,770 --> 01:40:20,800
there's a huge amount of, uh, different
things that people might bring up.

1788
01:40:20,870 --> 01:40:22,750
A nine 11.
And it's one of the big problems with,

1789
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:25,960
with deep on King is that there's just
an endless stream of things that people

1790
01:40:25,961 --> 01:40:27,670
will bring it up. They'll say,
hey, what about the hotspots?

1791
01:40:27,671 --> 01:40:30,940
What about the free for, what about
the little bits of fire? What about,

1792
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:35,140
what about the squibble explosions on
the side of the building and you can go

1793
01:40:35,141 --> 01:40:38,500
through each one of them and you can
address each one individually and explain

1794
01:40:38,501 --> 01:40:39,430
what's actually going on.

1795
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:42,190
Let me tell you how I approached it. I
looked at it, the first thing I said,

1796
01:40:42,220 --> 01:40:44,620
oh my God, they detonated
that thing for sure. I said,

1797
01:40:44,621 --> 01:40:48,050
the way I looked to me like
the thing exploded, um,

1798
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:51,190
or rather a collapsed into its foundation.

1799
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:54,100
I'd never seen a building do that before.
It a hole on the side of it

1800
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,410
where it had been hit by the,
uh, the towers that were falling.

1801
01:40:56,620 --> 01:40:59,140
And even though there's this
big chunk missing from one side,

1802
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:02,920
it fell uniformly kinked in the mental
and felt like the controlled demolition.

1803
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:05,020
And so I was looking at it,
I was like, you know what,

1804
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:06,700
that looks like a fucking
controlled demolition.

1805
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:11,880
And then I realized that I'm stupid and
I'm not an engineer at all and I don't

1806
01:41:13,061 --> 01:41:17,290
know the tolerances of fire
and metal and the metal,

1807
01:41:17,291 --> 01:41:21,160
the concrete. And I'm looking at this
and yeah, it did fall free, fall speed.

1808
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:24,300
But maybe that's what fucking
happens when you get this car.

1809
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:24,821
And people were like,

1810
01:41:24,821 --> 01:41:27,010
well there's never been a building that
sort of burned to the ground and felt

1811
01:41:27,011 --> 01:41:28,990
like that in clubs.
That's true.

1812
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:32,710
But there's also never been a bridge
like that giant bridge in Minnesota that

1813
01:41:32,711 --> 01:41:34,750
just collapsed and those
people were driving over it.

1814
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:39,490
Remember that it was a big fucking
tragedy, man. It bridges collapsed.

1815
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:41,230
Sometimes people,

1816
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:45,580
they design shit and then when they
put it together it's sucks, you know?

1817
01:41:45,581 --> 01:41:50,350
And sometimes you have these giant fires
that exposes the fact that your design

1818
01:41:50,351 --> 01:41:51,850
sucks.
Well genuine.

1819
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:55,120
They have to change building codes
afterwards because of the, the,

1820
01:41:55,210 --> 01:41:58,300
the reason the building seven collapse
they think is that what they had these

1821
01:41:58,301 --> 01:42:01,810
very long spans of the floor and went in
wasn't secured as well as the other end.

1822
01:42:01,811 --> 01:42:04,960
So it pushed one end off and
that fell and that kind of

1823
01:42:05,140 --> 01:42:08,770
go pull it up, pull it up Brian, just
let's look, look at it in real time.

1824
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:11,530
Cause it's,
it is incredible how fast it falls.

1825
01:42:11,531 --> 01:42:15,040
It literally falls free fall speed.
It's like the whole thing,

1826
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:18,550
kids out uniformly and it
just collapses into its base.

1827
01:42:18,790 --> 01:42:21,430
He is very misleading because a lot of
the times people show you this video of

1828
01:42:21,431 --> 01:42:24,970
the building collapsing in the show from
afterward the penthouse falls where the

1829
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:27,960
penthouse is falling in
world trade centuries.

1830
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:31,890
It's showing the interior of
the building is collapsing. Hmm.

1831
01:42:32,020 --> 01:42:34,210
And when you actually see the
building itself collapsing,

1832
01:42:34,211 --> 01:42:37,630
there's pretty much nothing left of
the outside of the outside the inside.

1833
01:42:37,631 --> 01:42:40,000
It's either it's either collapse or it's
in the process of collapsing and you've

1834
01:42:40,001 --> 01:42:41,920
got this very strong skin outside.

1835
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:45,970
That's the other thing about building
seven the interior set up on this big

1836
01:42:45,971 --> 01:42:47,070
screen in a second.

1837
01:42:47,071 --> 01:42:52,071
The idea of jet fuel burning so hot that
it melts metal nonsense though cause it

1838
01:42:52,271 --> 01:42:55,270
doesn't burn hot enough to melt it.
It Burns hot enough to weaken it.

1839
01:42:55,470 --> 01:42:58,380
Let's watch it here. Let's watch
this sucker go down. Ready?

1840
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:02,530
That's like several
seconds into the collapse.

1841
01:43:02,790 --> 01:43:05,250
I'm going to tell you something.
If I was Larry Silverstein,

1842
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:10,020
I would sue the fuck out of whoever
built me that shitty building.

1843
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:15,180
God Damn. Because if that isn't
some grand conspiracy, the CIA,

1844
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:20,100
the DEA, they have their documents in
that building along with major banks.

1845
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,690
Isn't that a part of the conspiracy side?
But is that true? That is true, right?

1846
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:26,820
Yeah. They had some documents
in there and they lost the sun.

1847
01:43:26,821 --> 01:43:30,750
Just stuff them sons of bitches are in
awesome. I shop on a computer. No, no, no,

1848
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:33,090
no backup. They don't do backup.
They write things down on paper.

1849
01:43:33,091 --> 01:43:35,700
It was all in that building.
Alluded that shit up.

1850
01:43:36,270 --> 01:43:39,130
They blew that shit up to
protect the evidence. Um,

1851
01:43:39,210 --> 01:43:43,410
and I'm not saying that Alex is wrong
again cause I am stupid, but uh,

1852
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:47,100
I would be fucking pissed off if I made
that building and it fell apart like

1853
01:43:47,101 --> 01:43:49,380
that. God Damn, I be
expected that to happen.

1854
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:52,010
The building was, wants to coat
that was like, they just didn't

1855
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:53,540
know that that type of
thing was going to happen.

1856
01:43:53,630 --> 01:43:57,740
The idea that they could have giant
diesel fucking tanks in the basement is

1857
01:43:57,741 --> 01:44:00,410
running everything. They had
giant diesel tanks. Yeah.

1858
01:44:00,730 --> 01:44:04,940
Like that's part of what started this
massive and inferno destroyed. It didn't,

1859
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:07,310
that's more horse shit now
he had the diesel tanks,

1860
01:44:07,311 --> 01:44:09,040
they actually recovered a
whole bunch of that data lines.

1861
01:44:10,050 --> 01:44:11,330
So they had diesel tanks.

1862
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:14,830
The whole building's on fire and a
diesel tanks didn't catch on fire.

1863
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:17,060
The whole building wasn't on fire.

1864
01:44:17,090 --> 01:44:19,050
It was like several floors in
several sections I've ever.

1865
01:44:19,051 --> 01:44:20,970
But like the sections with the diesel,
what?

1866
01:44:20,971 --> 01:44:25,910
They were isolated and they didn't burn.
They didn't contribute. Hold on a second.

1867
01:44:26,030 --> 01:44:28,970
So you're saying that whole thing
wasn't on fire. If it wasn't on fire,

1868
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:31,880
how the fuck did this happen then? Lots
of it was only two. How many floors?

1869
01:44:31,890 --> 01:44:35,570
Major floors. I believe right now I
know there was like two, two floors.

1870
01:44:35,571 --> 01:44:39,720
That dad the big collapse a, I can't
remember who they were, but uh huh.

1871
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:42,920
And he was 17 and 18. How many
floors were on fire here? Uh,

1872
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:45,230
well most of the floors are on player.
On the south side.

1873
01:44:45,231 --> 01:44:46,670
If you look at the south
side of the building,

1874
01:44:46,671 --> 01:44:48,260
the entire thing is engulfed in smoke.
Yeah.

1875
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:52,160
Besides always cooler. Why is that?
Everywhere you go. Everywhere you go.

1876
01:44:52,161 --> 01:44:54,600
Back on the south side of Chicago,

1877
01:44:56,630 --> 01:45:00,560
I just read Lawrence Wright's Pulitzer
Prize winning book called the um,

1878
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:04,230
there looming tower and he
takes five exhaustive years to,

1879
01:45:04,231 --> 01:45:08,460
to study the origins
of nine 11 and this Mo,

1880
01:45:08,490 --> 01:45:12,510
this sort of Islamic
fundamentalist movement in half
and started in Saudi Arabia

1881
01:45:12,511 --> 01:45:17,130
and moved to the sedan and
move to Afghanistan. I mean
if you really, I always say

1882
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:22,740
read the book.
That's totally different side is on fire.

1883
01:45:22,770 --> 01:45:27,240
That book was designed by the government.
It is a DC information campaign.

1884
01:45:27,241 --> 01:45:30,690
It's been proven on info wars.com
yeah, look at that. That's like,

1885
01:45:30,720 --> 01:45:33,420
I just have to take the Alex Jones point
of view of, I'm sure he has documents.

1886
01:45:33,421 --> 01:45:35,790
He's my Frankie. Oh did he
thought smoke? There's one entire,

1887
01:45:35,791 --> 01:45:37,420
call them in the middle of the faith.

1888
01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:41,970
Feel comfortable with that being enough
to bring that fucking building down.

1889
01:45:42,030 --> 01:45:43,050
I'm be honest with you,

1890
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:45,240
but what he's saying is that
it pretty much did a collapse,

1891
01:45:45,241 --> 01:45:49,830
like one of the floors fucked like fell
down. I understand the whole concept,

1892
01:45:49,831 --> 01:45:54,330
but I don't blast buyer though. I
don't buy it. I think the DEA, the NSA,

1893
01:45:54,331 --> 01:45:58,850
they place thermite. That's a lot of
people in the building. I'm Laura.

1894
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:03,810
I'm just being honest. I really, I look
at that and I, the way it collapsed, it's

1895
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:07,630
just like God, it, I think it would
need to be really, really, really,

1896
01:46:07,631 --> 01:46:10,960
really fucked up. But the thing is
that the explanation of why collapse,

1897
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,370
it's just a bit too complicated,

1898
01:46:12,430 --> 01:46:15,940
but why is it too complicated to all
those architects and engineers for nine 11

1899
01:46:15,941 --> 01:46:18,980
truth or those guys, all crazy
heads that just kind of the, uh,

1900
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:23,500
the fringe bottom of the
barrel of the architects and
engineers, oh, how dare you,

1901
01:46:23,501 --> 01:46:27,580
how dare you discredit them? Ad Hominem
attacks on these fine gentlemen.

1902
01:46:27,710 --> 01:46:29,920
She owed us. A whole bunch of them
are very good at what they do,

1903
01:46:30,010 --> 01:46:34,390
but they're not generally experts in
structural engineering of large buildings

1904
01:46:34,391 --> 01:46:37,510
and their reactions to fire because
when that building was built,

1905
01:46:37,511 --> 01:46:41,110
the people who were engineers at that
time thought that it was perfectly safe

1906
01:46:41,111 --> 01:46:42,190
and they thought if there was a fire,

1907
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:44,860
it wasn't going to collapse because
they didn't factor in this one thing.

1908
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:48,700
You know, I look at it and it looks like
a controlled demolition to me, but again,

1909
01:46:48,820 --> 01:46:50,010
I'm saying it is.
What I'm

1910
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:50,760
saying is,

1911
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:53,730
remember the story I told you about Ted
Nugent shooting the deer and the side

1912
01:46:53,731 --> 01:46:55,200
and the Arrow comes out of the top of it.

1913
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:59,770
Weird Shit fucking happened sometimes
and you get some asshole bid.

1914
01:46:59,771 --> 01:47:04,140
You a shitty ass building. This
building, man, this building sucks.

1915
01:47:04,141 --> 01:47:08,110
A fat one dude and it's got a little
bitty firing it. It just collapses.

1916
01:47:08,111 --> 01:47:12,750
Or really a little bitty fired off
to bring it down. A giant building.

1917
01:47:14,170 --> 01:47:19,140
Yeah,
or the CIA or had documents.

1918
01:47:19,170 --> 01:47:23,490
What about the thermite? Can you
disprove the thermodynamic West? Oh,

1919
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,270
you can't disprove,
hey,

1920
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:28,770
stop trying to skirt around my questions
with your new world order. Flim flam

1921
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:33,810
do you disprove thermite while those,
you know, it really built bummed me out.

1922
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:37,170
There was a photo that someone had
sent me, uh, like look at this dude.

1923
01:47:37,171 --> 01:47:41,940
This is proof that there had to be some
sort of thermite involve in the cutting

1924
01:47:41,941 --> 01:47:46,650
of the steel at the base of the building
fact and this guy turned out to be,

1925
01:47:46,651 --> 01:47:51,570
he's a, he's an author of questionable
literature. It's just, no,

1926
01:47:51,571 --> 01:47:53,820
I think it's all of this stuff
is fucking cuckoo head shit.

1927
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,450
Cause I looked at it and I found
out that no, that's not what it is.

1928
01:47:57,451 --> 01:47:58,950
They actually put that stuff on.

1929
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:02,310
They actually cut those things at
the end when they were doing cleanup.

1930
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:07,170
That's from a torch. They sliced
it down with a torch. What was,

1931
01:48:07,171 --> 01:48:09,530
well I'm sorry,
what people were sending these,

1932
01:48:09,531 --> 01:48:13,770
these emails when these mass
emails showing these cuts
that had been made during

1933
01:48:13,771 --> 01:48:15,660
cleanup, when you know, the, the, the,

1934
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:19,560
the towers fell down devastating,

1935
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:22,440
destructive,
huge impact.

1936
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:26,580
They had to clean up all the debris and
they had a cut a lot of it up and the

1937
01:48:26,581 --> 01:48:30,030
photos of the, the stuff cut up.
People were sending it around.

1938
01:48:30,031 --> 01:48:31,200
It's proof of thermite.

1939
01:48:31,410 --> 01:48:35,340
They use thermite look at it sliced at
an angle could not have been possibly

1940
01:48:35,341 --> 01:48:38,460
created by the explosion of the building.
That's a fire right there.

1941
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:41,190
That's a big ass fire. Yeah. But
how many floors is that though?

1942
01:48:41,191 --> 01:48:44,010
Is that enough to bring down my building?
I'll fucking sue you bitch.

1943
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:48,050
That was my building based on
the north side of the talent.

1944
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:49,030
So you can see these lists.

1945
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:52,280
Embraceable fires cause all the fires
started when light the World Trade Center

1946
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:56,370
to you like oh one I understand
and I understand it for the record,

1947
01:48:56,371 --> 01:48:58,500
I just want to let everybody know and
when I say that it looks like a controlled

1948
01:48:58,501 --> 01:48:59,190
demolition.

1949
01:48:59,190 --> 01:49:02,430
I'm definitely not saying that it is
or not saying it does look like it does

1950
01:49:02,431 --> 01:49:03,120
look like.

1951
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:08,120
And I'm not saying that I have any right
to debate the structural merits of this

1952
01:49:08,161 --> 01:49:09,870
building. I've, I have no nothing.

1953
01:49:09,900 --> 01:49:13,050
I'm completely retarded when it comes
to that and my dad's an architect.

1954
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:13,771
Oh is he?
Yeah.

1955
01:49:13,771 --> 01:49:17,250
I mean I guess I could call him up and
ask him some questions about point about

1956
01:49:17,251 --> 01:49:20,970
the fact that you have a lot of so called
experts on that truth commission thing

1957
01:49:20,971 --> 01:49:22,180
or did that people the truth,

1958
01:49:22,181 --> 01:49:26,400
there's a bottom of the barrel
arbitrary or or their expertise isn't,

1959
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:29,850
isn't huge structures and how they would,

1960
01:49:29,910 --> 01:49:34,140
how they respond to fire and
and impact. I mean, yeah,

1961
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:39,030
that's a specific shitty contractors who
fuck you over and make you a building

1962
01:49:39,031 --> 01:49:42,940
that when you let a couple of floors on
fire just fucking falls apart. Couple of,

1963
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:47,980
a couple of, I did see huge planes. I was
into those buildings. No other one. That's

1964
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,710
tower seven. I know. Silly Bitch.
Yeah. That's the big argument.

1965
01:49:50,830 --> 01:49:52,870
Tower stuff is only building,
never felt like it's the work right here.

1966
01:49:52,871 --> 01:49:55,810
There I used to work right if a couple
of blocks away. It's really sad.

1967
01:49:55,811 --> 01:50:00,160
There's a lot of people that live in that
area too that stayed after the impact

1968
01:50:00,161 --> 01:50:04,360
and they were inhaling chemicals,
toxic chemicals on a daily basis.

1969
01:50:04,361 --> 01:50:08,670
Like Donna Summers, man. Donna
Summers died of lung cancer. Yes.

1970
01:50:08,930 --> 01:50:12,700
And she lived in that area. Wow. Yeah,
she lived right near the, um, the,

1971
01:50:12,701 --> 01:50:17,260
the towers and she died of lung cancer.
She didn't even smoke. Yeah. It happened.

1972
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:19,570
It happened to a lot of people.
It's not a small thing.

1973
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:22,150
I mean that the impact
of that thing is firemen,

1974
01:50:23,530 --> 01:50:27,400
cops to turn them to workers,
all first, first responders.

1975
01:50:27,450 --> 01:50:30,670
A lot of those guys got really,
really, really sick. Yeah.

1976
01:50:30,671 --> 01:50:33,310
That's something that doesn't get taken
into consideration when you talk about

1977
01:50:33,311 --> 01:50:35,260
the death toll of those things.

1978
01:50:35,530 --> 01:50:40,530
But that is a really worthy thing to think
about as opposed to the idea that the

1979
01:50:43,331 --> 01:50:46,900
government engineered it and
there was this conspiracy,

1980
01:50:46,901 --> 01:50:48,730
these guys didn't even know how to fly.

1981
01:50:48,731 --> 01:50:53,590
And some of the high that hit the
hitchhikers hijackers are still alive.

1982
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:56,830
They're in Saudi Arabia. Like,
man, I don't know. I don't know.

1983
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:59,220
I Dunno. What has happened
has been, I mean, like I said,

1984
01:50:59,221 --> 01:51:02,240
there's been so much good
journalism. I mean, Oh,

1985
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:06,850
good investigative and
exhaustive journalism that, that,

1986
01:51:07,610 --> 01:51:10,700
that will tell you the story.
So many different stories though.

1987
01:51:10,701 --> 01:51:12,500
That's part of the problem is complicated,

1988
01:51:12,610 --> 01:51:16,160
but people don't have the time cause
these complicated stories. Here's what I,

1989
01:51:16,430 --> 01:51:19,790
here's one point that I bring up. Whenever
people talk about conspiracy theories,

1990
01:51:20,030 --> 01:51:24,300
I say, do you believe in nine 11?
And when they say they do, and I say,

1991
01:51:24,301 --> 01:51:27,770
well then you believe in conspiracy
theories because people conspired.

1992
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:31,850
They pulled that off and they did it and
it was a real conspiracy and that shit

1993
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:33,910
is real and it does happen.
Absolutely.

1994
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:37,820
Just like a lot of other conspiracies
that happened throughout time that were

1995
01:51:37,821 --> 01:51:40,820
absolutely proven to be real events.
There's a lot of them.

1996
01:51:40,821 --> 01:51:42,020
There's not just one or two.

1997
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:44,750
They, they, they, you know,

1998
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:48,590
from all the evidence that I've
read and that seems credible,

1999
01:51:48,591 --> 01:51:53,591
that a group of dedicated fanatics under
the banner of fundamentalist Islam got

2000
01:51:54,891 --> 01:51:58,730
together, got financed and pulled
off this pretty amazing feat,

2001
01:51:59,150 --> 01:52:00,620
which was very different.

2002
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:04,570
See, I wouldn't say that I believe
that entirely. Um, without,

2003
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:09,600
without any pause because I don't
know anything about flying a plane.

2004
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:10,960
Okay.

2005
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:14,920
I don't know anything about being able
to do the maneuvers that those people

2006
01:52:14,921 --> 01:52:15,550
have done,

2007
01:52:15,550 --> 01:52:20,200
but I've seen these specials where they
break down whether or not a plane would

2008
01:52:20,201 --> 01:52:23,710
actually be able to hit the Pentagon
like it did and take the path that it did

2009
01:52:23,830 --> 01:52:28,180
and then the people can't reproduce
that in the simulator and that they have

2010
01:52:28,181 --> 01:52:32,740
been able to control planes by
the use of a drone technology.

2011
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:36,370
They've been able to do that
since the 1960s in fact,

2012
01:52:36,371 --> 01:52:38,290
that was part of the northwest document.

2013
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:43,030
Part of the northwest document was
exploding a fake a plane and pretending it

2014
01:52:43,031 --> 01:52:46,100
was filled with people.
But we're going to take a drone and fly

2015
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:48,890
it up and blow it up. So this
was a commercial airline? Yeah,

2016
01:52:48,891 --> 01:52:49,550
but it doesn't matter.

2017
01:52:49,550 --> 01:52:52,310
It's still a plane and we know
that you can control the plane.

2018
01:52:52,460 --> 01:52:53,350
We could control it.

2019
01:52:53,351 --> 01:52:58,351
Jet With drone technology as far back as
the 1960s so whether or not that was a

2020
01:53:00,081 --> 01:53:03,230
part of what got me,
maybe these guys took over the,

2021
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:06,260
they had to take over the cockpit
to allow that to take place. Like,

2022
01:53:06,261 --> 01:53:10,340
we don't know they're dead, but the,
the maneuvers that those jets did,

2023
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:14,630
it could have easily been something like
someone had hijacked and hacked into

2024
01:53:14,631 --> 01:53:18,800
the system and figured out how to turn
that diegetic to a drone. Not Difficult.

2025
01:53:18,801 --> 01:53:22,650
I talked a lot of pilots. I'm the one
that went into the Pentagon. Yeah. Really.

2026
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:25,220
We'll talk about it being this light, you
know, death spiral that they had to do.

2027
01:53:25,221 --> 01:53:26,120
But if you look at it on the map,

2028
01:53:26,121 --> 01:53:29,870
it's really just a very slow
descending three 60 loop.

2029
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:31,430
But it at an incredible speed,

2030
01:53:31,431 --> 01:53:34,280
right by a guy who wasn't experienced
pilot and had no experience flying those

2031
01:53:34,281 --> 01:53:36,540
kinds of jets.
The speed that the planes fly out,

2032
01:53:36,541 --> 01:53:38,900
he didn't actually make any difference
to the maneuvering cause it's, it's all,

2033
01:53:38,901 --> 01:53:43,160
it's all relative razor
outcomes, razor two things. One,
you're certainly right. Um,

2034
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:46,730
the more likely scenario is that they
pulled off these incredible and Hoover's.

2035
01:53:46,731 --> 01:53:49,040
He's incredible banks
into the more likely,

2036
01:53:49,530 --> 01:53:51,800
well for these people that didn't
know how to fly. For a guy like me,

2037
01:53:51,801 --> 01:53:54,290
it's what I did that they went to school
for it, they went to school. And we all,

2038
01:53:54,291 --> 01:53:57,650
we have, we have, we have FBI, uh, one
of the biggest things you have to be,

2039
01:53:57,651 --> 01:54:00,620
I never shared that information with
the CIA for a whole bunch of reasons,

2040
01:54:00,621 --> 01:54:03,820
mainly because they in some ways
weren't even allowed to, uh,

2041
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:05,860
because there's always been
a firewall between FBI,

2042
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:08,690
between spying on domestic and,
and,

2043
01:54:08,691 --> 01:54:11,270
and an end and an international
and there's actually laws involved.

2044
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:15,560
But one of the things that we know for
sure is that these people in the CIA knew

2045
01:54:15,561 --> 01:54:18,020
that. I mean the FBI knew this
and we have documents about this.

2046
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:21,410
We knew these people were studying.
We were at,

2047
01:54:21,411 --> 01:54:24,680
we're at flight simulation schools,
we know that.

2048
01:54:24,710 --> 01:54:27,200
So they have the commercial licenses.

2049
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:30,620
The guy flew into the Pentagon has a
committal listen, very hard to get right.

2050
01:54:30,670 --> 01:54:32,800
And my point thing, you just
get from like, you know,

2051
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:35,750
flying Microsoft flight simulator for a
few hours or something that you have to

2052
01:54:35,751 --> 01:54:40,320
do hours and hours and hours of practice.
I totally, I totally understand. And uh,

2053
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:42,080
like I said,
most likely that's what happened.

2054
01:54:42,290 --> 01:54:45,890
But then I also leave open the possibility
that they had an insurance policy and

2055
01:54:45,891 --> 01:54:49,100
they didn't allow these guys to decide
whether or not they wanted to fly right

2056
01:54:49,101 --> 01:54:51,770
into a fucking building and smash into it.
I don't know.

2057
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:53,810
That's not what comes razor.
Oh No, you're, no it's not.

2058
01:54:54,210 --> 01:54:57,180
I said that was the first part.
The first I agree with you.

2059
01:54:57,740 --> 01:55:00,770
That's what I'm saying. I don't have
a, I don't have a dog in this race.

2060
01:55:01,010 --> 01:55:04,490
What I'm saying is that I do know that
there was some sort of technology that

2061
01:55:04,491 --> 01:55:09,260
allowed them to use drone technology to
control jets as recent as far back as

2062
01:55:09,261 --> 01:55:12,530
1960s not saying that
that's what happened,

2063
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:18,010
but saying that what you saw
could be replicated with drones.

2064
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,680
I think the technology is there.

2065
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:23,040
Any amateur pilot could probably
have pulled off what they were doing.

2066
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:25,370
It really wasn't that hard.
It's not that hard.

2067
01:55:25,371 --> 01:55:28,530
Certainly to fly into the buildings wasn't
that hard and my father and my father

2068
01:55:28,531 --> 01:55:31,610
was a pilot for 20 years and he said,
that's very easy.

2069
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:34,710
It's steering a plane is pretty much
easier though. It's during a call.

2070
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,170
You just really easy to,
well,

2071
01:55:36,171 --> 01:55:39,100
why don't they release the videos for
the Pentagon being hit by the players?

2072
01:55:39,110 --> 01:55:41,630
A question. Why is that? By the way,

2073
01:55:41,631 --> 01:55:44,160
why don't we have video of those
planes flying into the Pentagon?

2074
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:47,420
We do have that one from
the uh, the parking garage
where you can stay for a few,

2075
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:51,090
a few frames. There's a, yeah, it comes
in, it looks more like a missile to me.

2076
01:55:51,091 --> 01:55:55,220
Ms. West, I would just, uh,
I don't see any reason why
they would be like, you know,

2077
01:55:55,221 --> 01:55:58,310
that many video cameras pointing
at that parking lot of this.

2078
01:55:58,380 --> 01:56:00,810
Well that's not the case though.
There are, there are videos.

2079
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:04,650
There's certainly our videos or video
cameras and video cameras were there.

2080
01:56:04,651 --> 01:56:06,000
Their videos were taken.
Right.

2081
01:56:06,330 --> 01:56:10,050
It was like they had shown that there
had been more than one video of this.

2082
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:15,170
This was the only one that they apparently
pointing within inside sort of where

2083
01:56:15,391 --> 01:56:16,220
we're at,

2084
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:19,250
cameras,
cameras pointing out looking for plaintiff

2085
01:56:19,310 --> 01:56:22,060
is coming in. I thought there was
more than one. I thought that,

2086
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:24,490
I'm pretty sure as it got to say this,
yeah.

2087
01:56:24,491 --> 01:56:25,760
I have something like something like that,

2088
01:56:25,761 --> 01:56:28,160
like a gas station or something nearby
where they had a video of it and they

2089
01:56:28,161 --> 01:56:30,920
gave it to the FBI and
the FBI just took it.

2090
01:56:31,190 --> 01:56:36,140
But you know the other thing is like
why, why put it out there? I mean if you,

2091
01:56:36,170 --> 01:56:38,380
if you were the FBI,
let's say, or the see it,

2092
01:56:38,381 --> 01:56:39,920
where the fuck is in charge with this,
right?

2093
01:56:40,250 --> 01:56:42,650
You're going door to door and finding
out who's good security cam videos.

2094
01:56:42,830 --> 01:56:44,480
Would you want those videos
to go on the Internet?

2095
01:56:44,481 --> 01:56:48,670
We've already got these giant towers,
it fells or video or this video.

2096
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:52,010
Would you just sweep the thing up
that shows the hit of the Pentagon?

2097
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:54,710
Cause you know how many times they're
going to show that they're gonna hit show

2098
01:56:54,711 --> 01:56:59,510
the main point or building getting
hit by a jet. Oh La, la La.

2099
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:03,500
All their videos is going to start with
that. The jet hitting the Pentagon.

2100
01:57:03,501 --> 01:57:07,730
We've coming back for you. Boom.
You know, that's an iconic building.

2101
01:57:08,060 --> 01:57:11,810
And like if you did have a video of it
blowing up, I guess they didn't have it.

2102
01:57:12,070 --> 01:57:15,890
I supposedly, it didn't record anything.
Yeah, that's what I would say too.

2103
01:57:15,950 --> 01:57:17,620
It's kind of,
I mean my day or released it.

2104
01:57:17,930 --> 01:57:21,470
I was always surprised that they never
really brought up bin Laden's body back.

2105
01:57:21,471 --> 01:57:23,720
I know they didn't want to have
a shrine for people to come to,

2106
01:57:23,721 --> 01:57:28,240
so they don't buy that. I don't buy that
one. I don't buy the been loved one.

2107
01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:31,250
I think that dude had been dead for
a long time. I think they probably,

2108
01:57:31,251 --> 01:57:34,180
Jackson guy will look like him and said,
let's just take that frozen

2109
01:57:34,230 --> 01:57:38,210
bid lawn sickle out and toss it in
the other. She had been on sick say,

2110
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:42,270
we got this bitch. Obama was like, listen,
I'm going to, I'm going to work with you.

2111
01:57:42,271 --> 01:57:44,520
You're going to work with me.
You're going to get me in the office.

2112
01:57:44,521 --> 01:57:48,120
I'm going to look like a
hero. This is what I need. I
need that bin. Ladin sickle,

2113
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:52,940
they had that break glass in case of
publicity. They had that with a bin.

2114
01:57:52,950 --> 01:57:54,390
Ladin sickle.
Just sit in there.

2115
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:58,810
Wait for a moment. I met a guy who was
on the raid. I met a seal team six.

2116
01:57:58,980 --> 01:58:01,110
Yeah, I bet he'd say, I told you this
while he's fucking you in the ass.

2117
01:58:01,260 --> 01:58:04,080
And then I'm gonna tell you something.
I kicked that door open.

2118
01:58:04,081 --> 01:58:08,270
I'm going to come grab my
boss, man. I killed him.

2119
01:58:08,860 --> 01:58:11,650
I feel in the story. Turns out your
boy wasn't even a seal ticks mailer.

2120
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:12,690
It's just so crazy.

2121
01:58:12,691 --> 01:58:17,380
Gay Guy Looks so fuck actors just like
still hold after is down to my store.

2122
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:21,900
I took it up the ass for my country.
I did it for Pat Tillman.

2123
01:58:21,901 --> 01:58:22,860
He needs to know the truth.

2124
01:58:26,690 --> 01:58:31,290
Ah. So that's the big one
that people will bring up.

2125
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:33,350
Back to the conspiracy
theory is the tower setup.

2126
01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:35,660
Yeah. I like, I like to bring
that up because people like,

2127
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:39,500
did you know the three buildings fell on
nine 11 and they make out like this big

2128
01:58:39,501 --> 01:58:42,550
thing that's been covered up. It's
covered up. It's totally wrong.

2129
01:58:43,150 --> 01:58:44,350
It's not even on the Internet.
Oh wait,

2130
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:47,530
I think it's best if you actually talking
with the nine 11 truth or I want to go

2131
01:58:47,531 --> 01:58:50,710
straight to building seven and talk about
that. Oh, go right from the get go. Yeah.

2132
01:58:50,711 --> 01:58:54,040
Cause that's the thing that they think
is the real biggest bit of evidence.

2133
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:56,370
Well it certainly looks like a
controlled demolition. Like you'd met.

2134
01:58:56,550 --> 01:58:58,890
I can't ever see headlines
of conspiracy theory.

2135
01:58:58,891 --> 01:59:03,600
Midwest admits nine 11 it looks like
a controlled demolition. That is it.

2136
01:59:03,630 --> 01:59:04,470
I mean they could use that

2137
01:59:04,670 --> 01:59:06,440
quote. That is what, that is a quote.

2138
01:59:06,470 --> 01:59:10,450
It does look like controlling the militia
Dutch, a demolition expert and they're

2139
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:14,660
saying, oh yeah, that looks
like a controlled demolition.

2140
01:59:14,661 --> 01:59:16,280
Then he goes into like
how they might've done it,

2141
01:59:16,670 --> 01:59:19,520
but the thing they don't show is that
like 10 minutes earlier he's looking at

2142
01:59:19,521 --> 01:59:20,450
the towers falling and said,

2143
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:23,480
oh there's no way that could have been a
controlled demolition. Oh really? Yeah.

2144
01:59:23,730 --> 01:59:28,420
Really good guy. Same interview.
Oh, and they didn't do shit.

2145
01:59:29,590 --> 01:59:32,240
That's very Michael Morton. Yeah.
You can't do that right now.

2146
01:59:32,241 --> 01:59:35,250
You've got to show both sides and you're
just selling entertainment. You know,

2147
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:38,900
I don't mind that. But you gotta
let me know. You know, like have a,

2148
01:59:38,901 --> 01:59:41,200
like a disclaimer. I say, listen,
there's some arguments against this,

2149
01:59:41,201 --> 01:59:43,880
but fuck them. It's not,
they're moving. Right.

2150
01:59:45,190 --> 01:59:48,280
That's then don't call it a documentary
then it's a movie, not a documentary.

2151
01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:49,330
I would do that and then would have,

2152
01:59:49,331 --> 01:59:53,020
I would play the whole movie and then I
would use the trailer and the truck at

2153
01:59:53,021 --> 01:59:55,810
the end, the trailers,
all me getting owned.

2154
01:59:57,180 --> 01:59:58,720
I get tricked you.
I did.

2155
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:03,250
I gave a movie where I pretend that I had
a point when I uncovered some secrets,

2156
02:00:03,251 --> 02:00:03,731
but it really,

2157
02:00:03,731 --> 02:00:07,570
I left out all the arguments against my
stupid theories and at the end of it,

2158
02:00:07,571 --> 02:00:09,850
I just got owned and I didn't
play that until the very end.

2159
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:15,930
I'd watch it. Um, do people
get mad at you? Yeah.

2160
02:00:16,270 --> 02:00:18,840
People think that you're a government
agent. Yeah. I've, I've had, uh,

2161
02:00:18,970 --> 02:00:22,000
more than one person tell me to look
out Midwest of government agent.

2162
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:24,870
Are you a government agent?
Maybe I look like I could see that.

2163
02:00:24,950 --> 02:00:27,910
She can't say that because now that's
first of all, why didn't he just say no?

2164
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:31,330
Ask me. Brian Count asked me Joe
Rogan and you a government agent.

2165
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:35,370
No de mic. Yes, I am. No, I'm not.

2166
02:00:35,550 --> 02:00:37,770
But I think you're so
fucking contradictory.

2167
02:00:38,190 --> 02:00:39,680
I believe you less and less every morning.

2168
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:44,040
I think he's actually like a useful or
useful exercise for people to assume that

2169
02:00:44,041 --> 02:00:47,970
I am a government agent.
Well that makes what?

2170
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,940
What have I said that's wrong.
That's cool.

2171
02:00:51,210 --> 02:00:53,760
We are both actually in
the Illuminati by the way.

2172
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:57,600
You're in the and iTunes and she
didn't tell me, why won't you tell me,

2173
02:00:57,750 --> 02:00:59,860
what did they give you? Oh cool. Vodka.

2174
02:01:00,280 --> 02:01:03,400
Is there a conspiracy theory or is
there something for both of you?

2175
02:01:03,401 --> 02:01:04,930
Cause I know you've been
doing this show now,

2176
02:01:05,230 --> 02:01:08,710
is there something that kind of that you
had trouble explaining where you just

2177
02:01:08,711 --> 02:01:11,830
kind of went, well that is
pretty amazing. You know,

2178
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:16,860
nothing that springs to mind but
that there are like, you know,

2179
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:18,050
real conspiracies out of that.

2180
02:01:18,630 --> 02:01:23,220
That's his point is what I like
about Mick is that he is skeptical,

2181
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:27,330
but he also is realistic about
what has and hasn't taken place.

2182
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:31,260
It's not like you're trying to
debunk everything that could,

2183
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:34,800
that's a conspiracy and that becomes
a problem because of that word.

2184
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:37,840
That word conspiracy is a weird word.
Like,

2185
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:40,010
even though there are
people can inspire to

2186
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:42,770
do things, you know, even though you know,

2187
02:01:42,890 --> 02:01:46,820
did Oswaldo kill JFK?
I don't know.

2188
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:48,350
I don't know if Oswald killed JFK,

2189
02:01:48,351 --> 02:01:53,351
but I know that there was someone who
conspired to kill JFK and got away with

2190
02:01:54,021 --> 02:01:57,170
it. I know there was a lot of,
a lot of things that happened.

2191
02:01:57,350 --> 02:02:00,860
There's a lot of people involved.
You know, whether it was the whoever,

2192
02:02:00,861 --> 02:02:05,540
the Cubans or whoever hired Oswald or
whether it was other people that were in

2193
02:02:05,541 --> 02:02:08,240
the grassy knoll,
which is still a distinct possibility,

2194
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:12,720
still a distinct possibility. There's
just not enough evidence. And the,

2195
02:02:12,730 --> 02:02:16,970
the fuckery involved in the JFK
assassination, is it an all time high?

2196
02:02:17,150 --> 02:02:22,150
Just the fact that they concluded that
a third bullet or that this bullet had,

2197
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:23,041
they had,

2198
02:02:23,041 --> 02:02:27,380
they had found a chipped
kerbstone underneath the
overpass and because of that

2199
02:02:27,381 --> 02:02:29,840
they had to attribute all these
different wounds to one bullet.

2200
02:02:29,930 --> 02:02:32,000
That's where the magic
bullet theory came from.

2201
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:35,690
A much more realistic possibilities
that he was hit by more than one bullet.

2202
02:02:35,691 --> 02:02:37,940
Sure. Much more real
estate. Not only that,

2203
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:42,920
much more realistic to think that they
really did hire this mob guy to fucking

2204
02:02:42,921 --> 02:02:47,240
sneak pass all these cops and shoot Oswald
before he could talk, which they did.

2205
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:49,970
They sound like this mob guy was
this guy who is like, you know,

2206
02:02:49,971 --> 02:02:54,350
I'm fucking pro America and this fucking
cock suckers dot going to kill my

2207
02:02:54,351 --> 02:02:56,750
president, and he ran up on
them and with the cops there,

2208
02:02:56,760 --> 02:03:01,580
no one is life is on the line, please. I
think that guy got talked into it. They,

2209
02:03:01,581 --> 02:03:04,040
oh, he owed money. He owed something.

2210
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:06,590
When you look at the Jack Ruby story,

2211
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:11,210
that's a guy who was a crook whose whole
life involved in organized crime his

2212
02:03:11,211 --> 02:03:12,080
whole life.

2213
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:17,170
Complete degenerate scum bag club owner
deep in bed with the mom probably had a

2214
02:03:18,801 --> 02:03:22,650
gambling problem, please.
There's a constant,

2215
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:24,920
there's a conspiracy there.
There's no doubt about it.

2216
02:03:25,310 --> 02:03:26,240
The magic bullet thing though,

2217
02:03:26,241 --> 02:03:29,140
I think that's one of the things that
has become accepted in the conspiracy

2218
02:03:29,150 --> 02:03:30,470
culture as being just,

2219
02:03:30,620 --> 02:03:34,100
it's an article of faith that it was
impossible for the magic bullet to,

2220
02:03:34,101 --> 02:03:34,431
it happened.

2221
02:03:34,431 --> 02:03:37,250
It's also an article of faith that it
was possible when you consider the fact

2222
02:03:37,251 --> 02:03:41,360
that it showed up on the
Gurney on Connolly's Gurney
in the hospital. Oh look,

2223
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:45,110
they found the bullet in almost
pristine condition. Well,

2224
02:03:45,180 --> 02:03:48,410
we're totally trustworthy type people,
so by it please.

2225
02:03:48,411 --> 02:03:51,150
But the magic bullet has been
replicated a couple of times with,

2226
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:53,720
I haven't seen that
really? Where's that? Yeah.

2227
02:03:53,721 --> 02:03:56,070
I think it was a discovery channel
thing or, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2228
02:03:56,120 --> 02:03:57,950
They didn't replicate it.
I know what you're talking about.

2229
02:03:57,980 --> 02:04:00,980
They only replicated it when it
didn't hit bone. They did replicated,

2230
02:04:01,010 --> 02:04:04,720
but when it hit bone, every time they hit
bone, it became contorted in the store.

2231
02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:06,200
They did it through Gel.

2232
02:04:06,201 --> 02:04:09,020
They did it through a bunch of different
things that mimic human tissue.

2233
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:11,210
It's very difficult to
exactly what happened,

2234
02:04:11,211 --> 02:04:13,700
but they got something that was close
enough that it seemed close. Ooh,

2235
02:04:13,730 --> 02:04:17,510
I disagree. I disagree on that one because
I've seen that special. I know exactly.

2236
02:04:17,511 --> 02:04:21,560
I know. The Guy who think and know the
guy who was involved in that. Was it?

2237
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:25,400
There wasn't a Jesse Ventura when he was
it, was it a mythbusters one? Yes. Todd,

2238
02:04:25,430 --> 02:04:30,290
the guy who produced my show, uh,
also, uh, did some work on mythbusters.

2239
02:04:30,440 --> 02:04:34,970
I have to ask him what, what the exact
specifics works. I'm pretty sure.

2240
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:38,310
Yeah. No, I mean, now I'm thinking
it's not even a mythbusters one,

2241
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:42,660
but do they had a jelly thing with like
bone in it and when it hit the bone and

2242
02:04:42,661 --> 02:04:45,450
would get fucked up more fucked
up than that bullet. I mean,

2243
02:04:45,451 --> 02:04:48,540
the bull was in pretty amazing shape.
It's even if it did,

2244
02:04:48,630 --> 02:04:50,310
let's say that obviously I wasn't there.

2245
02:04:50,370 --> 02:04:53,070
I don't know whether or not the magic
bullet really took the trajectory that

2246
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:57,600
it's being attributed to, but
let's say if it did, it's amazing.

2247
02:04:57,900 --> 02:04:59,400
It's amazing that the
bullet came out like that.

2248
02:04:59,460 --> 02:05:01,800
It doesn't mean that it's not possible,
but it's amazing.

2249
02:05:01,830 --> 02:05:04,350
It's amazing that it went through
two people caused all that damage,

2250
02:05:04,440 --> 02:05:08,550
left fragments inside their bodies that
they had to remove. Pretty incredible.

2251
02:05:08,610 --> 02:05:12,690
When you look at what it looks like,
so is it impossible? Of course.

2252
02:05:12,691 --> 02:05:13,950
I would never say that.
I don't know.

2253
02:05:13,980 --> 02:05:17,040
I didn't look the biggest thing as Jack
Ruby actually running a shooting. I,

2254
02:05:17,041 --> 02:05:19,200
there's no reason that that was,
that was very interesting to me.

2255
02:05:19,290 --> 02:05:22,570
It's fascinating. Fascinating
Oswald. So obviously he,

2256
02:05:22,750 --> 02:05:26,820
they wanted Oswald quiet jack when we
didn't do that because he felt bad for

2257
02:05:26,821 --> 02:05:27,654
Jackie.

2258
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:32,990
There's more than enough evidence to
indicate that there was more than one

2259
02:05:33,151 --> 02:05:37,860
person involved. It wasn't just just
him, just by the paper trail. I mean,

2260
02:05:37,861 --> 02:05:40,770
the fact that the guy, the guy,
he'd been to Cuba, Soviet Union,

2261
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:44,160
I mean he had a Russian wife and
brought her back with them. I mean,

2262
02:05:44,161 --> 02:05:47,160
this guy was like, uh, he was
involved in some really weird shit.

2263
02:05:47,550 --> 02:05:49,080
And just that alone,
like if,

2264
02:05:49,110 --> 02:05:52,110
if Oswald was the shooter
and it was just Oswald man,

2265
02:05:52,111 --> 02:05:53,910
there had to be a lot of
other people involved in this.

2266
02:05:53,911 --> 02:05:57,810
This is not something that he decided
to do on his own. One day I seen that.

2267
02:05:57,960 --> 02:06:01,590
I couldn't believe how steep
that trajectory was, but
he shot right down on it,

2268
02:06:01,890 --> 02:06:03,840
which I thought he was shot.
He didn't do it.

2269
02:06:04,830 --> 02:06:07,470
What do you think fucking shot that
guy for the grassy knoll overall?

2270
02:06:07,471 --> 02:06:08,670
Do you think he did it?

2271
02:06:09,370 --> 02:06:14,200
I would probably like, yeah. Or
on the side of him doing it. Uh,

2272
02:06:14,201 --> 02:06:15,760
I think there's lots of
unanswered questions. And again,

2273
02:06:15,910 --> 02:06:18,630
this is like hundreds and hundreds of
books being written and I'll promote

2274
02:06:18,710 --> 02:06:19,481
perspectives on it.

2275
02:06:19,481 --> 02:06:21,430
I don't think it's a question
we're ever really going to answer.

2276
02:06:21,900 --> 02:06:25,510
And it's a really hard one to debunk
because you can't do it satisfactorily.

2277
02:06:25,900 --> 02:06:27,580
Even things like the magic bullet,
it's really,

2278
02:06:27,581 --> 02:06:31,180
really hard to actually prove
that that would have happened.

2279
02:06:31,450 --> 02:06:34,570
You can prove that something like that
might have happened, but you know,

2280
02:06:34,571 --> 02:06:38,770
it's maybe kind of unlikely and it was
just a lucky shot and this thing's like a,

2281
02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:42,680
the back to the left thing, whether he
hit his head, goes back to the left. Uh,

2282
02:06:42,681 --> 02:06:47,440
and it's, you know, I, I've
had long debates about that
on, on the forum and, uh, uh,

2283
02:06:47,441 --> 02:06:51,400
it's just a very hard thing to convince
people that that might have been like,

2284
02:06:51,401 --> 02:06:55,930
you know, the bullet hitting from behind
and he's head goes back. Uh, because like,

2285
02:06:55,950 --> 02:06:56,111
you know,

2286
02:06:56,111 --> 02:06:59,590
bullets don't actually impart that much
velocity into people's heads when they

2287
02:06:59,591 --> 02:07:02,190
get shot in the head. But
people, you know, they have this,

2288
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:05,920
these articles of faith that because
he's had went back into the left,

2289
02:07:06,130 --> 02:07:09,370
then he must've been shot from the front.
So that must have been another gun man.

2290
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:10,820
Well, you know what, um,

2291
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:14,780
I actually kind of disagree that it
goes back into the left. Initially.

2292
02:07:14,840 --> 02:07:17,660
I think the initial spray
actually comes forward,

2293
02:07:17,930 --> 02:07:22,550
which is virtually impossible if you're
getting shot from the front. And uh,

2294
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:25,310
I think there is something that
other people need to consider.

2295
02:07:25,340 --> 02:07:27,140
I think he was shot
from all over the place.

2296
02:07:27,350 --> 02:07:30,500
I think the whole and the trake that
they made a tray, Cole and his neck,

2297
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:32,600
I think that has an impact wound.
I think it's been pretty,

2298
02:07:32,910 --> 02:07:35,000
it's been pretty well argued based.

2299
02:07:35,170 --> 02:07:40,170
The difference between the autopsy report
in I'm in Dallas and then the autopsy

2300
02:07:40,451 --> 02:07:41,410
report and Bethesda,

2301
02:07:41,411 --> 02:07:43,630
Maryland that they were looking
at two totally different things.

2302
02:07:43,631 --> 02:07:46,360
They were describing wounds in a
different way and there's been,

2303
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:50,860
it's been widely reported that they had
generals standing over the hospital bed

2304
02:07:50,890 --> 02:07:53,320
directing doctors on how
to report this stuff.

2305
02:07:53,500 --> 02:07:57,220
If that's true and if there really were
military people that are allowed inside

2306
02:07:57,221 --> 02:08:00,070
the operating room and the president's
body was brought in and they really did

2307
02:08:00,071 --> 02:08:01,750
define where the wounds came from,

2308
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:06,070
who knows what the motive would have
been in 1963 and a mad scramble when the

2309
02:08:06,071 --> 02:08:09,370
president's been myrtle. Who knows
how much shitty thinking is involved.

2310
02:08:09,460 --> 02:08:12,700
How much of is a personality conflict
between a general and a doctor doesn't

2311
02:08:12,701 --> 02:08:16,840
want him in the room. Who knows what
the fuck is going on? Who knows,

2312
02:08:17,020 --> 02:08:19,090
but if I was going to shoot the president,

2313
02:08:19,120 --> 02:08:22,000
I wouldn't kind of one guy to pull it off.
Why would you do that?

2314
02:08:22,001 --> 02:08:24,400
If you can get one Lee
Harvey Oswald Asshole,

2315
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:27,910
you can get five more dudes sitting to
grassy knoll and fucking peck this guy

2316
02:08:27,911 --> 02:08:31,390
off as he's driving towards you, you're
not going to just shoot, you're not gonna.

2317
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:35,890
If there's a grand conspiracy to kill the
president, which most likely there was.

2318
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:40,810
I just don't see Oswald being like,
I'm going to do this on my own.

2319
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:42,880
I don't need any help. No
assassin's. I've always in.

2320
02:08:42,881 --> 02:08:47,500
A lot of times it's been people who were
on the fringe of some kind of movement

2321
02:08:47,820 --> 02:08:52,180
or Gee, I think, sure. You know,
and, but they were generally
and essentially loners.

2322
02:08:52,181 --> 02:08:56,920
I think for the most part, you know, guys
who had always had trouble fitting in,

2323
02:08:56,950 --> 02:08:57,401
you know,

2324
02:08:57,401 --> 02:09:01,510
and we're trying to look to be significant
and we're loosely attached to several

2325
02:09:01,511 --> 02:09:03,760
different organizations
are at one organization,

2326
02:09:03,761 --> 02:09:05,710
whether it was at and
usually a general way.

2327
02:09:05,760 --> 02:09:08,920
How many of them have there been that
you can make such a rash generalization?

2328
02:09:08,921 --> 02:09:09,850
I'm thinking about boots.

2329
02:09:09,851 --> 02:09:14,830
Something about the Guy John
Tried to kill the guy who shot,

2330
02:09:14,831 --> 02:09:18,160
who shot the archduke Ferdinand and
his wife at the beginning of world war.

2331
02:09:18,430 --> 02:09:22,060
That sort of sparked world war one. I'm
thinking about the guy who assassinated,

2332
02:09:22,061 --> 02:09:26,270
uh, Lincoln. The, these guys were,
were one was a Serbian terror.

2333
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,650
Uh, how do we know that all
those weren't conspiracies to,

2334
02:09:29,790 --> 02:09:32,970
and then someone was behind
the scenes manipulating, well,

2335
02:09:32,971 --> 02:09:34,900
they're not manipulating
Bryan county back then.

2336
02:09:34,901 --> 02:09:39,180
You're part of a group that has a stated
mission and goal, which is what a,

2337
02:09:39,190 --> 02:09:42,690
I can't remember the guy's
name who killed, but look
at Sirhan Sirhan who shot,

2338
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:46,630
uh, you know, Bobby Kennedy, that
guy tried to assassinate the pope.

2339
02:09:47,170 --> 02:09:49,900
These people are generally,
you know, loners.

2340
02:09:49,930 --> 02:09:53,020
We did fear factor in that kitchen
is, yeah. Yeah. It's creepy.

2341
02:09:53,470 --> 02:09:54,520
Walked right through that bitch.

2342
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:57,520
So like how is this not like a
part of the history that's in la?

2343
02:09:57,521 --> 02:09:59,740
It's not even there anymore.
I'm pretty sure they tore it down.

2344
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:03,130
It was like a landmark. It was a
hotel and they were using it for, um,

2345
02:10:03,220 --> 02:10:04,170
for filming there.

2346
02:10:04,171 --> 02:10:07,330
Would people do like the horror
movies there and shit got shot there.

2347
02:10:07,331 --> 02:10:11,080
Actually you shot film there.
I mean Christ,

2348
02:10:11,110 --> 02:10:13,760
Brian [inaudible] guys know that yes,

2349
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:18,280
Jesus Christ aren't just talking about
assassins and basically named yourself

2350
02:10:19,570 --> 02:10:21,040
talking about what is our owner.

2351
02:10:21,041 --> 02:10:24,190
You are so embarrassed how
you go against the grain.

2352
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:29,200
You make impulsive decisions and shooting
the president. Ariane, I'm a contrarian.

2353
02:10:30,700 --> 02:10:34,010
I think at JFK that was one of those
conspiracy theories that you can never

2354
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:37,190
really deep on. I love that
you're willing to admit that it's,

2355
02:10:37,230 --> 02:10:40,400
it's like you know everything's so far
in the past the evidence has been gone

2356
02:10:40,401 --> 02:10:43,520
over with a fine tooth comb and there's
still all these like case closed.

2357
02:10:43,521 --> 02:10:45,770
I hate those guys on both sides.

2358
02:10:45,771 --> 02:10:48,620
You get people who will say it's
definitive one way or the other but then

2359
02:10:48,621 --> 02:10:53,621
there's just so much unknown about it
that you never going to be able to close

2360
02:10:53,991 --> 02:10:54,560
it.
But there are,

2361
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:57,710
there are conservation theories that
you can prove that aren't going on.

2362
02:10:57,711 --> 02:11:00,240
Like the chem trail thing.
And there are aspects of the,

2363
02:11:00,241 --> 02:11:04,160
the broader theories like,
like JFK and nine 11 that you can address.

2364
02:11:04,161 --> 02:11:06,020
You can address individual
points of evidence,

2365
02:11:06,021 --> 02:11:10,330
but I don't think you're ever really
going to be able to debunk nine 11.

2366
02:11:10,331 --> 02:11:13,170
It's just, it's going to go on
forever. Basically, people look at,

2367
02:11:13,190 --> 02:11:15,830
there's always going to be some people
who are going to think that there was an

2368
02:11:15,831 --> 02:11:16,400
inside job.

2369
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:20,300
Hitler burned the rash tag.
Nero burned Rome. Of course,
you know, all these things.

2370
02:11:20,301 --> 02:11:24,620
You're a student of history being an
disinformation agent from another country.

2371
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:29,480
It probably taught you about America and
our history of this great land for you.

2372
02:11:29,481 --> 02:11:33,710
Came over here. You
sound like man cow. No,

2373
02:11:34,550 --> 02:11:38,080
he's more Chicago. I did his, did
his, uh, cause he still right.

2374
02:11:38,100 --> 02:11:42,150
Well he's sort of like, he's paying,
putting on an act. He puts on an activity.

2375
02:11:42,190 --> 02:11:45,880
Like we had an argument, fake
argument about Carlos Man. See Ya.

2376
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:49,160
He was wearing his sunglasses at
seven in the morning. I was like,

2377
02:11:49,161 --> 02:11:51,880
this isn't gonna go well. How
he was running back, I dunno,

2378
02:11:52,010 --> 02:11:56,630
I wear sunglasses in studio
are problematic. Oh my God.

2379
02:11:57,230 --> 02:12:00,010
He was acting like a rock star.
Like he was doing something like writing,

2380
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:02,660
like flying a spaceship. I was
like, Bro, relax. You're just,

2381
02:12:02,980 --> 02:12:06,620
you're doing a radio show. I'm feeling
good about this. Look. Oh, there it is.

2382
02:12:06,621 --> 02:12:11,390
Ladies and gentlemen, put it on the back
of the famous man. This is how you know,

2383
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:16,670
this is how you know you're slipping
when you take pictures like this. Sorry,

2384
02:12:16,671 --> 02:12:17,900
Anthony Bourdain.
I love you.

2385
02:12:17,990 --> 02:12:21,470
That's when you know you're
slipping Anthony Bourdain's
picture the CNN pictures

2386
02:12:21,471 --> 02:12:24,710
like this. I love that guy. I know
he gets away with it. Oh he does?

2387
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:27,260
He gets a free pass on everything he
does. He's my boyfriend. He's awesome.

2388
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:30,320
I love that guy. Yeah, you do. You're
actually, you've got a man crush on board.

2389
02:12:30,321 --> 02:12:31,340
Dang.
He's a great guy.

2390
02:12:31,790 --> 02:12:35,330
He's one of the few people that I was
giddy about getting to eat dinner with.

2391
02:12:35,540 --> 02:12:37,810
I've had dinner with them
and drinks and got laid up,

2392
02:12:37,830 --> 02:12:40,700
got lit up in Montreal together.
Oh, he's beautiful person, man.

2393
02:12:40,940 --> 02:12:43,280
We talked to like fucking three o'clock
in the morning till they kicked us out

2394
02:12:43,281 --> 02:12:46,220
of the bar. No so much. He's
just a great guy. He's a great,

2395
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:49,550
interesting guy that sees the world and
didn't become famous till he was older

2396
02:12:49,551 --> 02:12:49,971
in life.

2397
02:12:49,971 --> 02:12:53,090
So He's very appreciative of it and
very balanced and he's all about like

2398
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:57,070
putting in the work is all about like
just living the life and just putting a

2399
02:12:57,071 --> 02:13:01,950
guy we shot. We did meet either with, it
was one of his camera. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2400
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:03,320
It was talking about it.
Boy,

2401
02:13:03,710 --> 02:13:07,100
if you want to have a fucking cushy Gig
as a cameraman, man, what a cool gig.

2402
02:13:07,101 --> 02:13:10,460
Rather Bordain and then meat eater.
Two totally different things.

2403
02:13:10,461 --> 02:13:13,490
One of them you're standing for
stars, hotels, the other one,

2404
02:13:13,610 --> 02:13:15,950
you're in a fucking bag of cloth.

2405
02:13:16,370 --> 02:13:21,230
It's 16,000 degrees below zero and you're
trying to kill a buffalo with a spear.

2406
02:13:22,910 --> 02:13:26,570
This show meat eaters. One of my, I,
I'd have to say it's my favorite show.

2407
02:13:26,720 --> 02:13:30,080
So show I look forward to the most,
especially after a Brian and I,

2408
02:13:30,090 --> 02:13:32,190
we went hunting on it with this guy.

2409
02:13:32,260 --> 02:13:33,420
He goes hunting because it's like,

2410
02:13:33,421 --> 02:13:37,590
does fair chase hunts goes
out in the middle of like,
you know, it goes to Alaska.

2411
02:13:37,830 --> 02:13:40,950
This week was Alaska was hunting bears
that were searching for blueberries in

2412
02:13:40,951 --> 02:13:45,270
the high altitude. Did you, did you
get, um, did you get your gear yet? Yes,

2413
02:13:45,570 --> 02:13:49,770
I haven't. I haven't. I've been slacking.
Shit, bitch. Ryan Kennedy, Carolyn again.

2414
02:13:49,830 --> 02:13:52,320
Ryan, Kelly, man. I got to
come Kai and I got to call you.

2415
02:13:53,510 --> 02:13:57,900
She sent me probably email them. Don't use
the podcast. You Fuck? I was, what other,

2416
02:13:57,901 --> 02:14:02,010
um, what other, um, conspiracies are
like big ones that you get asked to,

2417
02:14:02,030 --> 02:14:06,180
to debunk all the time. Uh, well, you
know, people bring up things like Ufo.

2418
02:14:06,330 --> 02:14:09,510
What about Elvis? Yeah.
Uh, oh, this is bullshit.

2419
02:14:10,300 --> 02:14:14,190
You alive and just decided enough was
enough. Man. Didn't want the life.

2420
02:14:14,670 --> 02:14:17,940
That's the Michael Hastings thing.
Ah, the Michael Hastings thing.

2421
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:21,510
And this is where you're going to
show what a, what a government shill.

2422
02:14:21,511 --> 02:14:22,344
You really are.

2423
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:27,720
You going to tell me the Michael
Hastings car wasn't rigged to explode and

2424
02:14:27,780 --> 02:14:29,280
flying to that tree at
a hundred miles an hour.

2425
02:14:29,570 --> 02:14:32,940
It looks exactly like he was just driving
like a crazy guy and he hit the tree.

2426
02:14:33,550 --> 02:14:34,383
I hit a bump in the,

2427
02:14:35,620 --> 02:14:40,620
maybe the government use their mind
control h everyone's looking for a drone.

2428
02:14:41,501 --> 02:14:42,340
It's not a drone.

2429
02:14:42,341 --> 02:14:45,130
They don't turn your car into a drone
that technology's not available yet,

2430
02:14:45,220 --> 02:14:47,590
but they can Manchurian candidate you,

2431
02:14:47,591 --> 02:14:50,920
they can get inside your mind and
convince you that for the greater good of

2432
02:14:50,921 --> 02:14:54,190
mankind and the cause that you're
involved in driving to a fucking tree.

2433
02:14:54,250 --> 02:14:57,450
They released show. I found the photos
when actually it would be we're filled.

2434
02:14:57,500 --> 02:14:59,770
I was went to the set
with you on fear factor.

2435
02:14:59,771 --> 02:15:03,970
The day that we went to that hotel
and I found the photos that I took. Oh

2436
02:15:04,060 --> 02:15:07,000
Wow. Where's torn down? Old
School old school stuff.

2437
02:15:07,150 --> 02:15:11,950
So he was a shot in that kitchen.
Yeah. Wow. That's creepy shit.

2438
02:15:11,980 --> 02:15:12,813
Yeah.

2439
02:15:12,870 --> 02:15:15,810
And the 17 different gunshots
rang out in three seconds.

2440
02:15:15,930 --> 02:15:20,520
You tell me how that's possible with one
shooter. Midwest. Go ahead. Your turn. Um,

2441
02:15:20,790 --> 02:15:25,770
I dunno sir. Hands. Her hand was
a Buddhist who killed a biggie.

2442
02:15:26,010 --> 02:15:26,970
He ate flowers

2443
02:15:28,620 --> 02:15:29,453
or Tupac.

2444
02:15:29,580 --> 02:15:31,980
Do you even follow those kinds of
things are not there. You don't debunk.

2445
02:15:31,981 --> 02:15:34,550
Begin to pop because they're black. Is
that what you're saying? So you're racist.

2446
02:15:35,220 --> 02:15:38,730
Wait a minute. You go all the way to
back my shaft. K before your time.

2447
02:15:39,030 --> 02:15:42,480
JFK is not before your time,
but big. He is. How dare you.

2448
02:15:44,220 --> 02:15:47,850
You fucked it. People don't
bring a biggie. You are
hanging out with white people.

2449
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:49,620
You're hanging out with
white people in Venice.

2450
02:15:49,621 --> 02:15:51,600
It's big with English accents
and go to art galleries.

2451
02:15:51,830 --> 02:15:55,080
You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.
There is the generally wine.

2452
02:15:55,980 --> 02:15:58,370
Well that's one of the things you said
on a show. That's what he, what do you,

2453
02:15:58,470 --> 02:16:01,380
what do you get? What do you find
when you look at for the Sasquatch?

2454
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:06,290
I'll tell you, we don't find black
people. No black people. There's not one.

2455
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:06,960
We were,

2456
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:09,810
me and Dunkin formed a group while we
were out squash and called unfuckable

2457
02:16:09,811 --> 02:16:14,810
white dudes and it was me and him
and those two dudes. And we were uh,

2458
02:16:14,850 --> 02:16:19,800
we were out there steady squash and that
was our band. He unfuckable white dudes.

2459
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:21,030
What about,
what about Ufo?

2460
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:24,760
Because that's actually another thing
he can't really deep on because a lot of

2461
02:16:24,770 --> 02:16:28,050
them are just identify flying objects
though that lights in the sky and he'd

2462
02:16:28,051 --> 02:16:32,140
done it. What to do we have any pictures?
Do we have any pictures that are really,

2463
02:16:32,141 --> 02:16:35,690
really convincing? All of them. Oh, we
don't pull shit. Listen, this guy's,

2464
02:16:35,691 --> 02:16:39,190
it's a shill. He's a shell. The
information, look at that drawing. Okay,

2465
02:16:39,191 --> 02:16:42,070
look at this statue that I have.
That's a real alien. Tell me.

2466
02:16:42,071 --> 02:16:44,440
If you look at that in your heart
and your soul, you know that,

2467
02:16:44,441 --> 02:16:47,140
that to be really alien. I think
there might be, it's an archetype.

2468
02:16:47,990 --> 02:16:52,210
There's almost let less Ufo pitchers
coming out now than they were back in the

2469
02:16:52,210 --> 02:16:55,210
late fifties and people are
scared to speak their mind
because of ridicule. Okay.

2470
02:16:55,211 --> 02:16:57,490
Because people like Kim,
what they've done is they've,

2471
02:16:57,510 --> 02:17:01,180
they've made it seem like you're a silly
person. Yeah. If you send in your photos,

2472
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:05,710
you're turning out mic while I'm, I'm
assuming this was show need some balance.

2473
02:17:06,130 --> 02:17:09,700
You're trying to create controversy and
conflict. Basically what I'm telling you,

2474
02:17:09,701 --> 02:17:13,300
Bryan, calendars and aliens
are real. Roswell happened.

2475
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:16,690
I am stopped trying to deny it.
I just need some proof. Sir.

2476
02:17:16,840 --> 02:17:21,160
There's no proof necessary. I know. You
need to know is that the, the sky is huge.

2477
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:22,530
That's true way.

2478
02:17:23,090 --> 02:17:25,840
That is something I never really think
about it just how vast the university is.

2479
02:17:25,870 --> 02:17:28,660
It's
someone's high.

2480
02:17:29,230 --> 02:17:31,150
I never really think about
how big the universe is

2481
02:17:34,840 --> 02:17:38,500
talking about this. Why does it,
why do they always look like that?

2482
02:17:39,450 --> 02:17:42,700
I do you know the story that comes from
the Fifties Duncan Trussell told me this

2483
02:17:42,701 --> 02:17:45,730
story. He said that when
you are being born, okay.

2484
02:17:45,731 --> 02:17:50,350
People assume that when you're being born
you have no memory of uh, your, your,

2485
02:17:50,351 --> 02:17:51,184
your childhood.

2486
02:17:51,430 --> 02:17:54,850
But why would we assume that just because
you don't have a context to put that

2487
02:17:54,851 --> 02:17:58,310
memory into just because the one of
the most traumatic moments of doubt,

2488
02:17:58,350 --> 02:18:02,470
young brains, life we'll be
getting yanked out of its warm,

2489
02:18:02,471 --> 02:18:06,220
incredible environment of love with
it's mommy and then taking it into some

2490
02:18:06,370 --> 02:18:11,370
bright clinical place where a man is
hovering over you with complete control.

2491
02:18:11,591 --> 02:18:12,790
You can't move your body.

2492
02:18:12,970 --> 02:18:16,900
You're being lifted up and carry
to this tray and dropped down.

2493
02:18:16,901 --> 02:18:21,070
You're looking down at this guy who's
got this white mask on these black eyes

2494
02:18:21,071 --> 02:18:24,730
and the archetype of this man's face when
your eyeballs have never even adjusted

2495
02:18:24,731 --> 02:18:28,420
to being able to see reality.
I mean, you're not looking,

2496
02:18:28,480 --> 02:18:32,950
you're not popping out of a fucking of
vagina filled with liquids and blood and

2497
02:18:32,951 --> 02:18:34,570
then seeing crystal clear,
right.

2498
02:18:34,660 --> 02:18:37,480
My eyes are blurry when I get
out of the fucking shower, right?

2499
02:18:37,600 --> 02:18:39,940
When you get out of the pool,
if you've been swimming a public pool,

2500
02:18:40,030 --> 02:18:40,900
your eyes turn rent.

2501
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:45,070
Do you imagine what your eyes must look
like being in gallons of vagina fluid

2502
02:18:45,220 --> 02:18:49,670
for nine months? Blind close, but
they open up there in the water.

2503
02:18:49,690 --> 02:18:51,420
There's a lot of shit going on.
You don't know.

2504
02:18:51,421 --> 02:18:52,690
You don't know if they're open to there.
I don't know.

2505
02:18:52,691 --> 02:18:57,130
Megan shutout blood and then the pressure
of that pussy squeezing on your head.

2506
02:18:57,280 --> 02:19:01,170
All of that's going to fuck up your
vision. It's supposed to be, if it's,

2507
02:19:01,780 --> 02:19:03,220
it's a pussy.
If you're going to have sex with it,

2508
02:19:03,940 --> 02:19:06,460
and if you didn't have sex with it,
she wouldn't have a baby.

2509
02:19:06,500 --> 02:19:08,840
You're coming out of it. It's a vagina.
Once you have sex with it, it's a to,

2510
02:19:09,010 --> 02:19:11,460
it's not bad that it's supposed to.
It's supposed to.

2511
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:14,590
It's not bad if it's your daughter,
it's a vagina,

2512
02:19:15,130 --> 02:19:17,740
and if it's your wife even have to
just set up baby. It's opposing.

2513
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:20,470
The baby came out of the pussy,
the baby staring at this alien,

2514
02:19:20,590 --> 02:19:23,950
and that that image is somehow shocked.
The image,

2515
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:25,690
the memory of the clinical experience,

2516
02:19:25,691 --> 02:19:28,280
and it really does kind
of make sense that these

2517
02:19:28,430 --> 02:19:32,180
ideas that people have of this
hypnotic regression bringing up this,

2518
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:36,350
this alien abduction experiences that
completely of squashed well, what is,

2519
02:19:36,380 --> 02:19:39,200
what would be a traumatic moment
that you really did squash?

2520
02:19:39,310 --> 02:19:43,490
How about your birth, your fucking
birth, getting shot in for the light.

2521
02:19:43,510 --> 02:19:45,750
It's impossible light that
you never could have imagined.

2522
02:19:45,751 --> 02:19:49,160
Then nine months you've been alive and
the x amount of time you've actually been

2523
02:19:49,161 --> 02:19:53,040
thinking about things a lot more aliens
wearing masks. If a, that was good.

2524
02:19:53,870 --> 02:19:55,820
I don't think there's a real image.

2525
02:19:57,610 --> 02:19:59,430
I think that's why the owl,

2526
02:19:59,510 --> 02:20:02,870
the eyes are dark and the rest of
the features are sort of nonexistent.

2527
02:20:03,320 --> 02:20:06,830
Or maybe it's just somebody who to the
flood, but that's just an artist's image.

2528
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:11,150
The actual, what the reoccurring
inch is actually the eyes,

2529
02:20:11,570 --> 02:20:11,931
the,

2530
02:20:11,931 --> 02:20:15,770
the variation in the face and other people
describe it being abducted by aliens.

2531
02:20:15,770 --> 02:20:17,330
They all described kind of a similar,

2532
02:20:17,331 --> 02:20:20,040
it's a very similar archetype
and the question is, is,

2533
02:20:20,041 --> 02:20:23,570
is that archetype because of
culture? Because like, you know,

2534
02:20:23,571 --> 02:20:25,050
like people see big foot,
right.

2535
02:20:25,051 --> 02:20:27,590
The idea is that that's what they're
looking for us because that's what

2536
02:20:27,591 --> 02:20:31,910
everybody's told them to go look for like
flying saucers. That's one where the,

2537
02:20:31,911 --> 02:20:35,900
uh, the guy who first
reported flying saucers was a
fighter pilot and he reported

2538
02:20:35,901 --> 02:20:40,901
these things skipping across the sky and
said that there were like saucers on a

2539
02:20:40,941 --> 02:20:43,350
lake,
like someone skipping a saucer and that,

2540
02:20:43,400 --> 02:20:47,930
but that he didn't mean even
saucer shaped. They were
actually a boomerang shape.

2541
02:20:47,931 --> 02:20:49,610
That what he was saying that he saw.

2542
02:20:49,630 --> 02:20:52,760
It sounds like he fell that everybody
after that started seeing saucers,

2543
02:20:53,240 --> 02:20:55,610
they started seeing actual discs.
Why?

2544
02:20:55,611 --> 02:20:59,150
Because that had been putting image
that had been put in their hands.

2545
02:20:59,870 --> 02:21:02,360
I was going to say, that's
interesting. You know,

2546
02:21:03,140 --> 02:21:07,430
he may have been totally sleep deprived
and completely hallucinating or on meth

2547
02:21:07,690 --> 02:21:10,300
or whatever. They were given pilots, man,

2548
02:21:10,430 --> 02:21:13,160
they were giving pilots
meth for a long time.

2549
02:21:13,490 --> 02:21:17,450
We went over on the show recently how
much math was involved in the kamikaze

2550
02:21:17,451 --> 02:21:21,470
pilots, how much math was involved in
the Nazis and I'm awake and it was,

2551
02:21:21,471 --> 02:21:23,600
people didn't even know
it was bad for you then.

2552
02:21:23,810 --> 02:21:26,840
Like there's people that
doctors are prescribing math at.

2553
02:21:26,850 --> 02:21:30,530
Doctors were taking a methamphetamine
in medical school. Yes.

2554
02:21:30,860 --> 02:21:33,590
So it's not outside the
realm of possibility.

2555
02:21:33,591 --> 02:21:36,380
This guy really did see
disks flying through the sky.

2556
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:39,260
It's also not outside the realm
of ability. Realm of possibility.

2557
02:21:39,261 --> 02:21:43,940
This guy was tripping his fucking balls
off on some government shit. No sleep.

2558
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:46,550
The earliest version
of pro vigil they had,

2559
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:50,570
they're pumping into this fucking
guy or pro vigil really works.

2560
02:21:50,990 --> 02:21:55,070
It is explained to me. Do you
know it's not a, it's not a,

2561
02:21:55,071 --> 02:21:59,260
it's not a central nervous
stimulant. Actually. It's
something else. It keeps it,

2562
02:21:59,310 --> 02:22:03,200
I can't explain it because like as I am
not an architect, I'm also not a doctor.

2563
02:22:03,310 --> 02:22:06,680
I would give you a fucked up
explanation of what it is. But, um,

2564
02:22:06,890 --> 02:22:10,960
there's some people that swear by it,
some Weirdos, you know, I had a doctor to,

2565
02:22:10,961 --> 02:22:12,920
to who was at sleep specialist.

2566
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:16,470
I sat next to him by coincidence
at dinner and he said it to,

2567
02:22:16,550 --> 02:22:19,700
he was explaining how it worked,
but he said it's not a stimulant away.

2568
02:22:19,730 --> 02:22:20,760
Caffeine would be a stimulant.

2569
02:22:20,810 --> 02:22:25,140
It just keeps you awake for 14 hours
and you can function highly on.

2570
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:26,070
What's really interesting

2571
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:29,070
is it was first created as a
performance enhancing drug,

2572
02:22:29,610 --> 02:22:30,990
mental performance enhancing drug.

2573
02:22:31,170 --> 02:22:33,900
But they couldn't market it that way
because the government's like, no,

2574
02:22:33,901 --> 02:22:37,560
you can't have a drug that just
makes your brain work better.

2575
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:40,920
Like you have to have a reason, you have
to be an ailment that you're treating.

2576
02:22:41,460 --> 02:22:44,310
And so they said, okay,
narcolepsy. Oh Wow.

2577
02:22:44,340 --> 02:22:48,530
And so then they started prescribing it
for narcolepsy or off brand or how would

2578
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:51,950
they say, what does it off, off
label, off label, off label use. So,

2579
02:22:51,951 --> 02:22:55,840
so we'll provigil kind of center
your mind. Well I'll tell him,

2580
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:59,040
let Brian describe it cause I gave one
to Brian was about to fucking fall asleep

2581
02:22:59,041 --> 02:23:01,830
once he had two hours sleep. And he was
driving to San Diego. He's like, dude,

2582
02:23:01,831 --> 02:23:04,920
I don't know how I'm going to do
it. I go take this. And I don't, I,

2583
02:23:04,921 --> 02:23:08,160
I'm very judicious with them.
I only take them when I need,

2584
02:23:08,190 --> 02:23:12,060
when I haven't had sleep,
when I need energy for a long
sustained period of time.

2585
02:23:12,061 --> 02:23:13,620
Like occasionally,
if I'm feeling entitled,

2586
02:23:13,670 --> 02:23:18,320
take a half a one before a UFC and it
doesn't give you any speediness to it.

2587
02:23:18,321 --> 02:23:21,150
It's not like drinking red bull. It's
not like you're anything, it just,

2588
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:25,140
it gives you like less dips in
your energy. It just turns you on.

2589
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:29,290
Like it's just like, that's not even
a like tiredness or, or just like,

2590
02:23:29,291 --> 02:23:33,480
like where I just need to lay down for a
bid or just like, eh, but it's all gone.

2591
02:23:33,510 --> 02:23:38,010
As Tim Ferriss said, he doesn't believe
in a biological free lunch and it's, it's,

2592
02:23:38,011 --> 02:23:42,210
it seems to have like a really positive
benefit, which also makes me think like,

2593
02:23:42,211 --> 02:23:45,480
well, okay, what, is there anything
bad going on here because of this?

2594
02:23:45,630 --> 02:23:49,650
Like just seems like seems like a
pretty abusive, well, yeah, absolutely.

2595
02:23:49,830 --> 02:23:51,650
That's very important.
But also I'm,

2596
02:23:51,660 --> 02:23:56,310
I don't take it very often and only
take a half of one. I never go all in.

2597
02:23:56,311 --> 02:23:59,250
I don't need it. I just think like a
little bit, just a little bit as good.

2598
02:23:59,251 --> 02:24:03,510
I don't want to feel like Ooh, like
an effect. But if you take a full one,

2599
02:24:03,511 --> 02:24:07,380
you'll feel like a blue, like a
little bit of a rush. And I know, um,

2600
02:24:07,590 --> 02:24:10,380
that it's a,
a big rumor among silica,

2601
02:24:10,410 --> 02:24:14,190
silicon valley startups that like all
these guys who just provigils out of their

2602
02:24:14,191 --> 02:24:17,910
mind and they have massive energy to
complete projects that work at 16 hours a

2603
02:24:17,911 --> 02:24:21,870
day and they're all just fucking pop
and provigil and there's no bodies,

2604
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:22,710
you know,

2605
02:24:22,710 --> 02:24:26,010
and people are really worried about so
much so that Tim Ferriss kept it from his

2606
02:24:26,011 --> 02:24:28,140
book. I go, why'd you
leave it on your book goes,

2607
02:24:28,141 --> 02:24:31,050
I don't want people just chewing
on it like candy. I was like, wow,

2608
02:24:31,080 --> 02:24:34,500
it's so effective that you were worried
about your own responsibility or

2609
02:24:34,501 --> 02:24:37,570
personal responsibility for intro
introducing it to people. Tim Ferriss,

2610
02:24:37,590 --> 02:24:39,000
a good guy. Yeah. Well,

2611
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:43,170
I've heard of the same with the
disastrous side effects for Adderall.

2612
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:46,740
And I have actually seen people that
I've been friends with have had problems

2613
02:24:46,741 --> 02:24:49,890
with Adderall. Adderall
is no joke. I was awful.

2614
02:24:50,050 --> 02:24:54,000
I mean if you split it down to like
little teeny pieces, it might be okay.

2615
02:24:54,001 --> 02:24:56,970
But like you take one Adderall pill,
you feel like you're on crack cocaine.

2616
02:24:56,971 --> 02:24:58,710
Like I feel like I get drips,

2617
02:24:58,830 --> 02:25:02,310
like I'm having flashback from doing
coke back cause it's that same feeling

2618
02:25:02,990 --> 02:25:06,000
tuning into that feeling. Wow. Yeah.

2619
02:25:06,001 --> 02:25:09,930
That Adderall thing though is a real issue
with folks. Okay, here's a conspiracy.

2620
02:25:10,020 --> 02:25:11,670
I'm with that.
What do you think about,

2621
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:15,030
do you think that the government
conspires with pharmaceutical companies to

2622
02:25:15,031 --> 02:25:17,400
prescribe certain amounts of drugs
so they can profit off of it?

2623
02:25:17,850 --> 02:25:21,000
I think that is certainly like a big
problem with leather regulation of drugs

2624
02:25:21,030 --> 02:25:24,010
like this, this big revolving door
of people in government and the

2625
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:29,010
regulatory agencies who basically worked
in industry and then they go work in

2626
02:25:29,231 --> 02:25:33,460
the government and then there's the same
people passing laws and regulations, uh,

2627
02:25:33,670 --> 02:25:34,460
forward.

2628
02:25:34,460 --> 02:25:36,140
See,
see what the financial industry,

2629
02:25:37,570 --> 02:25:41,510
that's the real conspiracy
or the EPA and Monsanto.

2630
02:25:41,810 --> 02:25:45,710
Did you ever see the, um,
um, there's a show on,

2631
02:25:46,760 --> 02:25:51,670
I want to say it's current,
but no, it's not. It's um, uh,

2632
02:25:51,710 --> 02:25:55,520
vanguard, the oxycontin express.
Have you ever seen that?
Uh, that the special, it's,

2633
02:25:55,521 --> 02:25:57,790
it's available online.
You could see it online and uh,

2634
02:25:57,830 --> 02:26:01,180
we've had the folks in that created it, I
forget what network they were on. Sorry.

2635
02:26:01,930 --> 02:26:03,990
Current was it current? Yeah. Um,

2636
02:26:04,190 --> 02:26:08,270
and they showed the oxycontin problem in
Florida and how easy it is to get pills

2637
02:26:08,271 --> 02:26:09,210
and how crazy it is.
They,

2638
02:26:09,330 --> 02:26:12,620
they didn't have a database where you can
go from one doctor to another and just

2639
02:26:12,621 --> 02:26:13,670
keep getting prescriptions.

2640
02:26:13,850 --> 02:26:17,180
They have these pain management
centers set up everywhere where you go.

2641
02:26:17,181 --> 02:26:18,590
Literally, they go, oh, my back hurts,

2642
02:26:18,591 --> 02:26:20,600
Dr. Write some shit down
in the same building.

2643
02:26:20,600 --> 02:26:25,190
They have a pharmacy that only sells pain
pills and these people just cranked to

2644
02:26:25,191 --> 02:26:28,790
the gills on Oxycontin's
all day. Well, there's no,

2645
02:26:28,820 --> 02:26:33,820
there's no question that
I think corporations will
sometimes if they want to get

2646
02:26:33,921 --> 02:26:34,461
something passed,

2647
02:26:34,461 --> 02:26:39,350
I mean the food industry will stack the
deck with its scientists that they put

2648
02:26:39,351 --> 02:26:43,340
on their payroll to suggest, for example,
that the foods that they're producing,

2649
02:26:43,550 --> 02:26:45,440
which are simple sugars and you know,

2650
02:26:45,441 --> 02:26:48,020
whether it's craft or something
and they want to sell soda,

2651
02:26:48,021 --> 02:26:50,450
they want to sell candy bars in school,

2652
02:26:50,630 --> 02:26:55,630
well they'll stack the deck and have
signed to say 25% of your diet as a child

2653
02:26:55,791 --> 02:26:59,630
can be simple sugars. We've, we don't
find anything unhealthy about that.

2654
02:27:00,110 --> 02:27:04,130
They've been very active about that.
If you read the China study,

2655
02:27:04,131 --> 02:27:07,460
t Colin Campbell, who's a scientist,
I mean he's a Vegan and stuff.

2656
02:27:07,461 --> 02:27:11,620
I don't agree with that. But like I
said, yeah, but he's, he's incredible.

2657
02:27:11,630 --> 02:27:13,540
Is incredible scientist who,

2658
02:27:13,570 --> 02:27:17,360
who would have the value of that book for
me was just Wah list reading about how

2659
02:27:17,361 --> 02:27:18,290
they stack the deck,

2660
02:27:18,291 --> 02:27:21,950
how they're very influential on the
kinds of scientists that set standards.

2661
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:22,710
This is like a,

2662
02:27:22,710 --> 02:27:25,340
it's kind of like a real conspiracy, but
it doesn't have to be like, you know,

2663
02:27:25,341 --> 02:27:27,980
a bunch of guys in a smoky room
like deciding to do these things.

2664
02:27:27,981 --> 02:27:29,780
It's just kind of a bunch of increments.
The,

2665
02:27:29,810 --> 02:27:31,850
they push things in one
direction or the other

2666
02:27:32,070 --> 02:27:36,340
and it's based on, you know, you can
look at it, the influence very clearly.

2667
02:27:36,341 --> 02:27:38,170
And it's like, where's the money
coming from? It's just Monday.

2668
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:41,520
I called you after I read the book and
I remember I just had to talk somebody.

2669
02:27:41,521 --> 02:27:43,170
I go,
I remember I called and I said,

2670
02:27:43,171 --> 02:27:45,210
I don't know how people
can make a living this way.

2671
02:27:45,211 --> 02:27:47,940
I can never pay my
mortgage behaving that way.

2672
02:27:47,970 --> 02:27:49,230
When you were talking to me about the,

2673
02:27:49,290 --> 02:27:53,600
you called me up and we were telling
me about the richest county, uh, the,

2674
02:27:53,630 --> 02:27:56,940
the county in Virginia. It's all
lobbyists. It's all lobbyists and lawyers.

2675
02:27:56,941 --> 02:28:01,380
I mean that the Washington has become an
economy of influence. So crazy. I mean,

2676
02:28:01,381 --> 02:28:05,700
by the way, I'm sorry to use
that expression, but that's
my trademark. Uh, don't,

2677
02:28:05,710 --> 02:28:10,590
don't, don't, don't trademark.
No trouble. But, but, but the,

2678
02:28:10,650 --> 02:28:15,540
when you work on Capitol Hill now and
you're a congressman and you're making 140

2679
02:28:15,541 --> 02:28:18,210
grand a year or whatever it is,
it is the,

2680
02:28:18,270 --> 02:28:21,120
that is the farm league for k street.

2681
02:28:21,230 --> 02:28:23,510
All the lobbying firms
are where you go now.

2682
02:28:23,511 --> 02:28:26,780
You use your influence after being
in government for six or eight years.

2683
02:28:27,020 --> 02:28:31,700
You now move to a lobbying firm just
down the way on k street and now you're

2684
02:28:31,701 --> 02:28:32,570
making five,
six,

2685
02:28:32,571 --> 02:28:37,571
$700,000 a year to use the influence
and the contacts that you have made as a

2686
02:28:37,821 --> 02:28:41,150
congressman to influence
government for the,

2687
02:28:41,180 --> 02:28:43,910
for the firm. You're working for it. Yeah.

2688
02:28:43,970 --> 02:28:46,400
I think that's the biggest problem in
America right now because I don't think

2689
02:28:46,401 --> 02:28:49,190
you can really address it at the other
problems until he takes care of that.

2690
02:28:49,330 --> 02:28:49,511
Well,

2691
02:28:49,511 --> 02:28:54,511
I have a friend working on a possible
option and the option instead of trying to

2692
02:28:56,381 --> 02:28:58,930
attack campaign finance
and its current form,

2693
02:28:58,931 --> 02:29:02,380
offer another option and that other
option being the internet and that the

2694
02:29:02,381 --> 02:29:02,831
Internet,

2695
02:29:02,831 --> 02:29:07,831
you could have people that were funded
by like crowdsource Kickstarter style and

2696
02:29:08,110 --> 02:29:13,110
have people that are promoting certain
ideas funded and that being like doing it

2697
02:29:13,151 --> 02:29:16,450
that way, you could have a, it's a
massive resource of human beings.

2698
02:29:16,451 --> 02:29:18,760
We're talking about 300
million human beings,

2699
02:29:18,970 --> 02:29:22,870
which you really will have access to for
the first time as opposed to if you're

2700
02:29:22,871 --> 02:29:26,560
trying to do it like in any other form.
Like when Ross Perot came around,

2701
02:29:26,590 --> 02:29:30,820
they decided to tighten the
game up completely because
he fucked up everything.

2702
02:29:31,060 --> 02:29:34,120
That's the reason why Clinton became
president in the first place because Ross

2703
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:38,170
Perot came around and threw a giant
monkey wrench in the whole Republican side

2704
02:29:38,171 --> 02:29:40,900
of things and they said,
we cannot let that happen again.

2705
02:29:40,900 --> 02:29:44,350
So the commission for presidential
debates is a privately funded institution

2706
02:29:44,530 --> 02:29:46,090
decided to change their standards.

2707
02:29:46,091 --> 02:29:50,410
So how many people have to like you
before you're allowed to be in the debate,

2708
02:29:50,580 --> 02:29:54,670
like you have to have a giant percentage
of the popular vote to be able to get

2709
02:29:54,671 --> 02:29:55,331
into the debate.
Well,

2710
02:29:55,331 --> 02:29:59,260
that's the rub is you can't get it and
so you can get into the debate so you

2711
02:29:59,261 --> 02:30:02,170
can't get it and you can't get
it. So go fuck yourself. Yeah.

2712
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:05,770
Well this idea would be another
option. Would that be you? Would the,

2713
02:30:05,771 --> 02:30:08,860
the people that are their hamstring
because they don't have enough money.

2714
02:30:09,070 --> 02:30:13,450
If someone was dedicating their time
to creating like a real network of

2715
02:30:13,451 --> 02:30:18,451
politicians who are sourced like entirely
by the public and accountable for all

2716
02:30:18,641 --> 02:30:21,190
the different things that they're saying
that they're going to represent once

2717
02:30:21,191 --> 02:30:22,990
they get in there.
The thing I worry about that

2718
02:30:23,260 --> 02:30:24,430
the thing,
I have a problem,

2719
02:30:24,490 --> 02:30:29,230
what worries me is that you're still then
having congressmen spending 40 50% of

2720
02:30:29,231 --> 02:30:34,231
their time raising funds and I would like
the government to set a or someone to

2721
02:30:35,081 --> 02:30:37,050
set a limit and,
and,

2722
02:30:37,060 --> 02:30:40,180
and Dole out money to
all candidates equally.

2723
02:30:40,860 --> 02:30:43,320
Oh, that's horse shit.
They're now worth equal.

2724
02:30:43,430 --> 02:30:45,990
Do you think that equal that come on man.

2725
02:30:46,150 --> 02:30:49,650
Do you think that or like think of all
the crack heads like Rick Santorum that

2726
02:30:49,651 --> 02:30:52,050
ran for president. I think that
motherfucker deserves equal money.

2727
02:30:52,660 --> 02:30:55,110
Well it was crazy.
He was the one to stop gay marriage.

2728
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:58,230
Crazy people that think that the
earth is less than 10,000 years old.

2729
02:30:58,650 --> 02:30:59,520
They get the money too.

2730
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:00,750
You get those people
getting involved when he,

2731
02:31:00,751 --> 02:31:04,860
because corporations like
will side with people who uh,

2732
02:31:04,990 --> 02:31:07,100
have their interests are how
often it might be Rick Santorum

2733
02:31:07,220 --> 02:31:08,053
maybe.

2734
02:31:08,060 --> 02:31:11,240
And maybe I'm hoping that the general
public will catch up to the idea that

2735
02:31:11,241 --> 02:31:12,710
that's a good idea. Yeah, you're right.

2736
02:31:12,711 --> 02:31:15,050
That's some prompts on
the Internet as a source.

2737
02:31:15,051 --> 02:31:18,950
Like that is to me another option outside
of the corporations that hasn't been

2738
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:22,410
addressed yet. We've got to change that.
I think that is the, the gap for me,

2739
02:31:22,411 --> 02:31:23,430
that is the biggest problem.

2740
02:31:23,431 --> 02:31:26,270
And that's one of the things that I
like when people ask me like, you know,

2741
02:31:26,280 --> 02:31:29,960
what are the real problems? I started out
with campaign finance reform. Yes, yes.

2742
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:34,620
That's huge. And then you know when
you have all this crazy spine going on,

2743
02:31:34,621 --> 02:31:39,330
but no real, I mean, what's
the real danger? What's
really going on? Where's the,

2744
02:31:39,350 --> 02:31:43,680
the massive amount of terrorism that
we're experiencing in our country on a

2745
02:31:43,681 --> 02:31:47,520
regular basis that we need to take
over people's People's privacy,

2746
02:31:47,670 --> 02:31:50,970
that we need to be able to fish through
everyone's email and get metadata on

2747
02:31:50,971 --> 02:31:51,960
every phone call you make.

2748
02:31:51,960 --> 02:31:54,420
Where's the fucking evidence that
there's any need for all this stuff?

2749
02:31:54,630 --> 02:31:57,090
I say there's very little,
and I say it's one of those things,

2750
02:31:57,091 --> 02:31:59,280
it's a natural progression.
When a girl blows you,

2751
02:31:59,370 --> 02:32:01,680
you want to stick it in her ass.
It's just what happens.

2752
02:32:01,770 --> 02:32:03,150
You want to see if you could do that too.

2753
02:32:03,300 --> 02:32:04,740
When a girl is willing
to have sex with you,

2754
02:32:04,741 --> 02:32:07,560
will she blow you when a girl
jerks you off? Can we now have sex?

2755
02:32:07,590 --> 02:32:11,880
It's just there's a normal thing. You
steal $5 at work, can I still 20 you know,

2756
02:32:11,900 --> 02:32:12,301
you,
you,

2757
02:32:12,301 --> 02:32:16,980
you figure out a way to do
things more to get things more.

2758
02:32:17,130 --> 02:32:21,270
And that applies to everything that human
beings do it history of government is

2759
02:32:21,271 --> 02:32:25,000
that that to get to gain more control
and if they've got the power to,

2760
02:32:25,001 --> 02:32:27,270
to look into people's
emails, they're like, well,

2761
02:32:27,271 --> 02:32:30,480
let's just get all everyone's email
that they ever do ever. It's that way.

2762
02:32:30,481 --> 02:32:34,250
We can always have them on any,
and it's, it's, it's against the,

2763
02:32:34,260 --> 02:32:37,110
everyone wants to say that, well, the
constitution should be a living document.

2764
02:32:37,111 --> 02:32:40,620
It should change with the times, you know,
there's, we have a nuclear bombs now.

2765
02:32:40,621 --> 02:32:42,390
There's a lot of real issues
that people need to deal with.

2766
02:32:42,391 --> 02:32:46,050
They didn't have to deal with when
the constitution was written, but yes,

2767
02:32:46,051 --> 02:32:47,280
but the constitution,

2768
02:32:47,281 --> 02:32:52,281
what's interesting about it is that it's
a skeleton form of a government that

2769
02:32:54,031 --> 02:32:57,660
people were trying to construct after.

2770
02:32:57,750 --> 02:33:02,750
The governance that they had seen had
failed miserably because they were all

2771
02:33:02,790 --> 02:33:04,890
right darkies they were dictating.
So it was more,

2772
02:33:04,891 --> 02:33:09,210
it was psychologically based as well.
It understood the nature of man.

2773
02:33:09,211 --> 02:33:10,380
That's right. And those, those,

2774
02:33:10,620 --> 02:33:14,400
those fail safes that were put in place
and when they were establishing the

2775
02:33:14,401 --> 02:33:16,800
early government, when they were
trying to separate church and state,

2776
02:33:16,940 --> 02:33:20,280
what they were trying to do was make
it so that you couldn't have cults of

2777
02:33:20,281 --> 02:33:24,030
people with influence that just
controlled vast parts of the world.

2778
02:33:24,190 --> 02:33:27,510
Exactly ended eventually happened just
like they thought it was going to.

2779
02:33:27,511 --> 02:33:28,344
So well,

2780
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:33,030
the constitution just in that
form should be respected.

2781
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:35,700
Even if you don't want to,
you know,

2782
02:33:35,701 --> 02:33:38,760
you don't want to limit it to what was
written in the constitution because now

2783
02:33:38,761 --> 02:33:40,890
we have wireless internet and
all this other crazy shit.

2784
02:33:41,100 --> 02:33:45,510
He's still have to think they, they
saw corruption coming. They were right.

2785
02:33:45,690 --> 02:33:47,560
Ben Franklin said that the legend goes,

2786
02:33:47,610 --> 02:33:50,670
he came out and after they've formulated
the constitution and they said,

2787
02:33:50,671 --> 02:33:52,910
what if the woman said, what
have you done? And he said, well,

2788
02:33:52,920 --> 02:33:56,210
we've created a republic madam,
if you can keep it, you know,

2789
02:33:57,260 --> 02:33:58,710
it was always precarious.
You know,

2790
02:33:59,010 --> 02:34:03,980
when you write about conspiracy theories
or breakdown conspiracy theories, um,

2791
02:34:04,020 --> 02:34:08,670
do you feel an obligation to also
expose people to shit that actually is

2792
02:34:08,671 --> 02:34:13,230
legitimate? That does need concern?
That I do to a small extent,

2793
02:34:13,231 --> 02:34:15,690
but the so many of the people
doing the uh, the, the, you know,

2794
02:34:15,691 --> 02:34:17,890
I can just kinda point them
to the other sites like

2795
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:20,260
campaign finance reform.
There's loads of things out there.

2796
02:34:20,261 --> 02:34:22,480
So I didn't really feel the need.
I think like,

2797
02:34:22,481 --> 02:34:25,900
because I'm doing a very
good job at debunking stuff,

2798
02:34:26,170 --> 02:34:29,020
that's where I focus my efforts.

2799
02:34:29,320 --> 02:34:31,210
Totally agree.
I think you're doing a great job,

2800
02:34:31,420 --> 02:34:36,370
but I also feel like you
take an exorbitant amount
of negative energy then like

2801
02:34:36,371 --> 02:34:40,840
I've seen these debates that you get
online with these people just on Twitter

2802
02:34:41,110 --> 02:34:43,840
when you jumped on Twitter,
I watch you for days.

2803
02:34:43,841 --> 02:34:47,560
I was coming in here to the office while
we were filming the show and I was like,

2804
02:34:47,561 --> 02:34:50,980
he is still going at it with these
motherfuckers and you never lost your

2805
02:34:50,981 --> 02:34:54,030
patients. You were all these people
are calling you a government shill.

2806
02:34:54,031 --> 02:34:56,980
They're asking you how much
you get paid by the government.

2807
02:34:57,130 --> 02:35:00,340
And he just kept throwing up like,
you know, this one asks a question,

2808
02:35:00,341 --> 02:35:02,740
he would give a scientific explanation,
throw up a link,

2809
02:35:02,980 --> 02:35:04,600
and then they would just be like,
ah,

2810
02:35:04,810 --> 02:35:09,040
fuck flappable got to
flappable British gentlemen.

2811
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:11,250
And that's something that people
like to use it against me. They said,

2812
02:35:11,251 --> 02:35:12,270
I'm too unflappable.

2813
02:35:12,380 --> 02:35:16,900
Oh, I must be a fermentation because
I'm not saying fuck you to everybody.

2814
02:35:16,910 --> 02:35:21,170
You can't win. It's really important that
we look at the truth, the real truth,

2815
02:35:21,171 --> 02:35:25,430
not the truth that you want to see, but
the actual real truth. And there's, uh,

2816
02:35:25,610 --> 02:35:29,660
there's a lot of complexities to this
life and there's complexities to the mind

2817
02:35:29,661 --> 02:35:32,090
that we perceive this very life with.
And that's a real issue.

2818
02:35:32,091 --> 02:35:35,000
There has to be managed
like the constitution was
trying to manage the idea of

2819
02:35:35,001 --> 02:35:38,570
the psychological nature of man in, in
a, in the form of making government.

2820
02:35:38,810 --> 02:35:40,440
You have to kind of manage your,

2821
02:35:40,510 --> 02:35:45,510
your own mind in terms of how certain
situations can be defended that don't

2822
02:35:46,041 --> 02:35:48,500
necessarily make sense.
You and I talk about this all the time.

2823
02:35:48,501 --> 02:35:51,870
I mean a lot of times you've got to
face up to when you're lying or lying to

2824
02:35:51,880 --> 02:35:55,040
even to yourself, you've got to
face up to kind of like, oh man.

2825
02:35:55,040 --> 02:35:58,760
I've been kind of telling myself a story
here and actually my good friend over

2826
02:35:58,761 --> 02:36:00,740
here has just told me that I
got to take a look at that.

2827
02:36:00,741 --> 02:36:02,800
That's what a real friend
does, right? When you go home,

2828
02:36:02,840 --> 02:36:05,120
that's something I'm not going
to actually reassess some.

2829
02:36:05,160 --> 02:36:08,940
You know I love Michael Schirmer's quote.
If you've read them,

2830
02:36:09,720 --> 02:36:13,400
I'm doing myself a great
disjustice injustice,

2831
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:17,810
but bring up Michael Shermer right now
because I'll be a rape apologist because

2832
02:36:17,811 --> 02:36:21,680
I don't know if you know about this. He
was accused of doing something improper,

2833
02:36:21,890 --> 02:36:25,100
improper meaning getting a girl
drunk and having sex with her.

2834
02:36:25,940 --> 02:36:28,820
Crazy that people are calling that a
lot of people are calling that rape man.

2835
02:36:28,821 --> 02:36:30,920
I ain't never done that.
I don't know if that happened.

2836
02:36:31,160 --> 02:36:32,960
I don't know what happened
getting her drunk.

2837
02:36:32,961 --> 02:36:37,340
So my point is that I just needed to
address that just to put it out there.

2838
02:36:37,550 --> 02:36:38,290
But the,

2839
02:36:38,290 --> 02:36:42,860
the quote that is that he has is that
lots of people that are very smart believe

2840
02:36:42,861 --> 02:36:46,430
dump things because they can explain
them and they can argue them very well.

2841
02:36:46,580 --> 02:36:49,100
And so they think they're doing
well and winning in the argument.

2842
02:36:49,101 --> 02:36:50,960
So that may be their point.
Makes Sense.

2843
02:36:51,290 --> 02:36:55,080
But it really becomes like a sort
of circular ego argument. Sounds,

2844
02:36:55,110 --> 02:36:57,620
sounds good. They've got a good
sounding occupant to be, you know,

2845
02:36:57,650 --> 02:37:02,430
you talked to like Michael Murphy
and uh, he, he's very eloquent.

2846
02:37:02,580 --> 02:37:06,810
Yes. It used to be, it's a bit less
eloquent now. It's, but he, he, you know,

2847
02:37:06,840 --> 02:37:09,430
he's very convincing.
He's very personable person and you know,

2848
02:37:09,431 --> 02:37:11,340
you can easily get sucked
into things like that.

2849
02:37:11,341 --> 02:37:15,180
And then you start repeating the same
arguments yourself and you're convincing

2850
02:37:15,620 --> 02:37:18,170
because if you are an eloquent person,
you're eloquent to yourself.

2851
02:37:18,840 --> 02:37:23,640
Well, it's also in being a smart person
and most of us are at least somewhat

2852
02:37:23,641 --> 02:37:25,800
competitive.
We want to be right.

2853
02:37:26,010 --> 02:37:28,830
And it's what you were talking about
earlier about certain skeptics being

2854
02:37:28,831 --> 02:37:33,270
aggressive and they use
skepticism as a game. W Ciao.

2855
02:37:33,300 --> 02:37:34,800
Tallying up a social score.

2856
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,130
Yeah. It becomes a debate, uh,

2857
02:37:37,131 --> 02:37:40,670
in the old fashioned sense of a debate
where it's like one person has to argue

2858
02:37:40,671 --> 02:37:40,851
this,

2859
02:37:40,851 --> 02:37:44,450
the other person argues the opposite
thing and then they fight it out and the

2860
02:37:44,451 --> 02:37:45,530
best debater winds,

2861
02:37:45,710 --> 02:37:49,490
it becomes about debating rather than
about finding what is true and what is not

2862
02:37:49,491 --> 02:37:50,470
true.
Okay.

2863
02:37:50,630 --> 02:37:54,230
Yeah, that's, that is a real
problem with, uh, being able to,

2864
02:37:54,270 --> 02:37:57,330
to,
to put it all aside and actually like,

2865
02:37:57,331 --> 02:37:59,340
look at what the fuck is really going on.

2866
02:38:00,930 --> 02:38:03,900
They end up saying things
that are wrong because the,

2867
02:38:03,901 --> 02:38:07,870
the too hasty to come up with
an explanation for things.
So they'll end up like,

2868
02:38:07,930 --> 02:38:11,700
you know, just saying, you
know, oh, that's, that's not
cool. That's not a chem trail.

2869
02:38:11,701 --> 02:38:13,410
That's a smoke from the plains.

2870
02:38:14,030 --> 02:38:16,650
Because because that's the first thing
that comes into the hat because they're

2871
02:38:16,820 --> 02:38:18,990
that debunkers and they think that
if they can think of something,

2872
02:38:19,020 --> 02:38:21,390
they've got that thing where you know
they think they are intelligent and they

2873
02:38:21,391 --> 02:38:24,780
are somewhat intelligent but people fool
themselves as to how intelligent they

2874
02:38:24,781 --> 02:38:28,220
actually are. So even in debunkers
can you get caught? Oh yeah. Yeah,

2875
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:29,990
it is their own to seats.
It's very,

2876
02:38:30,030 --> 02:38:32,880
it's very annoying from my perspective
as well because I get people coming onto

2877
02:38:32,881 --> 02:38:37,020
my site and then they try to debunk
things but that they say things that are

2878
02:38:37,021 --> 02:38:40,200
wrong but it's scientifically wrong and
then you have to end up like correcting

2879
02:38:40,201 --> 02:38:41,340
the debunkers as well.

2880
02:38:41,730 --> 02:38:45,430
Oh well that ever ends NTD bunkers,

2881
02:38:45,670 --> 02:38:50,170
we agree there are a lot of Conti d
cause quite a few, you know. Sure.

2882
02:38:50,710 --> 02:38:51,151
It's easily,

2883
02:38:51,151 --> 02:38:55,360
to me it's easy to be when you're also
frustrated with your own vision of the

2884
02:38:55,361 --> 02:38:58,960
world and then when someone comes along
saying they have fucking documented

2885
02:38:58,961 --> 02:39:02,680
proof to loch ness monster is real and
you're like the fuck you do shit head

2886
02:39:03,030 --> 02:39:06,320
right. You don't, it's hard. It's
hard to say what is it was Sarah,

2887
02:39:06,330 --> 02:39:09,460
what is this proof where we have
you got this proof stored? Right.

2888
02:39:09,550 --> 02:39:10,390
May I measure it?

2889
02:39:11,220 --> 02:39:11,401
Yeah.

2890
02:39:11,401 --> 02:39:14,970
That sounds like the evidence you were
asking for in that the Ufo thing last

2891
02:39:14,970 --> 02:39:18,390
night. Yeah, a couple of days ago.
It's, yeah, they don't have evidence.

2892
02:39:18,391 --> 02:39:21,910
They have eyewitness tetanus testimony
or they have like crappy photos.

2893
02:39:22,720 --> 02:39:25,930
There's no empirical evidence. There's
not nothing that sort of like, let's,

2894
02:39:26,260 --> 02:39:30,430
let's see some measurable evidence. Well,
let me tell you this. After chem trails,

2895
02:39:30,431 --> 02:39:34,720
which was the number one most hate I
got from anything I've ever done online,

2896
02:39:35,590 --> 02:39:39,760
so many people thought it was a
shill. And uh, number two was aliens.

2897
02:39:39,970 --> 02:39:44,970
And the idea that I could debunk like
this one place and it wasn't even deep

2898
02:39:46,681 --> 02:39:47,620
bunked this one place,

2899
02:39:47,621 --> 02:39:50,530
sky was just telling me some
crazy shit and I didn't buy it.

2900
02:39:50,770 --> 02:39:54,400
It's really simple when you talk to me
about bulletproof wolves and missed,

2901
02:39:54,401 --> 02:39:58,240
and if I don't buy it, it doesn't
mean I'm an asshole. Okay.

2902
02:39:58,241 --> 02:40:00,070
It means I'm trying to be real about this.

2903
02:40:00,490 --> 02:40:05,410
I think it's much more likely that there's
intelligent life in the universe than

2904
02:40:05,411 --> 02:40:07,900
it is that there isn't,
I think it's much more likely.

2905
02:40:08,260 --> 02:40:10,810
But I also think there's a lot
of shit that people are seeing.

2906
02:40:10,990 --> 02:40:15,890
Like we were talking about
these orbs people keep seeing
in this area around, um,

2907
02:40:15,990 --> 02:40:20,010
this ranch is little ranch, which is
in Utah, northern Utah. Well there's,

2908
02:40:20,130 --> 02:40:22,350
it's potentially ball lightning,

2909
02:40:22,560 --> 02:40:25,980
like bald lightening is a very real
phenomenon that's been measured and it's

2910
02:40:25,981 --> 02:40:26,761
really weird.

2911
02:40:26,761 --> 02:40:31,080
Like it can stay around for
several seconds sometimes
and people see it darting

2912
02:40:31,081 --> 02:40:32,550
around doing crazy shit.

2913
02:40:32,790 --> 02:40:35,490
And if you didn't expect to see that
and all of a sudden you did see it and

2914
02:40:35,491 --> 02:40:38,130
you're trying to put it into context and
you're looking at something that's so

2915
02:40:38,131 --> 02:40:41,250
fantastic, but it's really
just a phenomenon of nature.

2916
02:40:41,460 --> 02:40:44,790
You could convince yourself that you're
looking at something that is being

2917
02:40:44,791 --> 02:40:47,190
controlled by an alien life force.

2918
02:40:47,550 --> 02:40:51,840
And my problem is really simple.
I know people are full of Shit.

2919
02:40:52,140 --> 02:40:55,590
So when I meet one that might
be full of shit, I go, well,

2920
02:40:55,591 --> 02:40:58,020
he might be full of Shit.
It's really that simple.

2921
02:40:58,021 --> 02:41:00,510
It's not like lying is
something that doesn't exist.

2922
02:41:00,840 --> 02:41:03,540
It's not like a lot of people don't lie.
No.

2923
02:41:03,541 --> 02:41:08,370
The evidence is that a lot of people do
just make up stories and when someone

2924
02:41:08,371 --> 02:41:09,630
has,
you know,

2925
02:41:09,750 --> 02:41:12,930
just like the guy who's looking at the
fucking people that he's about to shoot

2926
02:41:12,931 --> 02:41:15,940
and sees it twitching motherfucker that
knows he's hopped up on adrenaline. Yep.

2927
02:41:16,290 --> 02:41:19,830
You also, as a person, especially a person
who's brutally honest with yourself,

2928
02:41:20,010 --> 02:41:25,010
recognize very easy when someone has no
emotional connection to the words that

2929
02:41:25,681 --> 02:41:29,400
are coming out of their mouth. This is
not a real incident that they're reciting.

2930
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:31,500
This is not a real thing that took place.

2931
02:41:31,620 --> 02:41:36,300
This is a person that's
telling me a stupid story
that sucks and it's insulting.

2932
02:41:36,480 --> 02:41:40,260
It's insulting to me that you think I'm
so fucking dumb that this is the week

2933
02:41:40,261 --> 02:41:41,400
game you're playing on me.

2934
02:41:41,520 --> 02:41:44,520
Just like some asshole coming up to the
most beautiful woman in the world and

2935
02:41:44,521 --> 02:41:47,170
trying to convince her that he's
a prince. Right? Right. Yeah.

2936
02:41:47,460 --> 02:41:50,750
That shit is insulting and gotten my AA.

2937
02:41:50,900 --> 02:41:53,060
What do you gotta do it?
Right?

2938
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:57,720
My point is it's insulting
and it's a problem with the,

2939
02:41:57,730 --> 02:42:01,440
the whole community of
quote unquote believers.

2940
02:42:01,770 --> 02:42:04,140
It's the problem is not that there are,

2941
02:42:04,170 --> 02:42:06,330
there's no way there's
Ufo is it's impossible.

2942
02:42:06,510 --> 02:42:11,510
The problem is most people tell Shitty
fucking stories that don't have any

2943
02:42:12,660 --> 02:42:15,030
evidence behind them.
They don't have anything.

2944
02:42:15,120 --> 02:42:18,900
And it's interesting when they tell you
these stories and if it is real wow,

2945
02:42:19,020 --> 02:42:22,740
amazing that the aliens came and took
you and they look just like every other

2946
02:42:22,741 --> 02:42:27,020
alien from Steven's Spielberg's close
encounters of the third time on and it

2947
02:42:27,021 --> 02:42:27,930
took you in space.

2948
02:42:27,960 --> 02:42:32,960
This is very common among people
who take religion at literal value.

2949
02:42:33,510 --> 02:42:36,790
When you see people who interpret the
Bible literally and stuff like that sort

2950
02:42:36,791 --> 02:42:39,900
of, but no, because these people are
talking about personal experiences.

2951
02:42:40,200 --> 02:42:43,040
They're having personal
experiences that way too,

2952
02:42:43,050 --> 02:42:45,990
and they have conversions or I'm
reborn and I had, I saw Jesus.

2953
02:42:46,260 --> 02:42:47,550
You hear a lot of that,
right?

2954
02:42:47,551 --> 02:42:51,270
But you hear much more of
people being abducted by aliens.

2955
02:42:51,450 --> 02:42:55,830
Then you do have people having religious
experiences and I think that goes right

2956
02:42:55,831 --> 02:42:57,480
back to the whole flying saucer thing.

2957
02:42:57,660 --> 02:43:01,590
I think people are in their head thinking
that they're going to be abducted by

2958
02:43:01,591 --> 02:43:03,750
aliens and so when they are sleeping,

2959
02:43:03,751 --> 02:43:05,790
which is when all these
fucking things take place,

2960
02:43:05,910 --> 02:43:08,370
they all take place the middle of
the night and they'll tell, you know,

2961
02:43:08,371 --> 02:43:10,020
a lot of abductions take
place during the day.

2962
02:43:10,110 --> 02:43:14,110
You know what else happens
during day? Sometimes naps. Yeah.

2963
02:43:14,111 --> 02:43:17,440
These people conk out at work and they
think they lost time cause you're fucking

2964
02:43:17,441 --> 02:43:20,140
drew blood on your shirt. Stupid,
right? You're not in a space ship.

2965
02:43:20,141 --> 02:43:20,801
You're not special.

2966
02:43:20,801 --> 02:43:24,280
You're gonna fucking cubicle and you're
not the person that the people from

2967
02:43:24,281 --> 02:43:28,000
Alpha Centauri have talked
to and convinced that you're
going to be able to have

2968
02:43:28,001 --> 02:43:31,150
the solution for saving the human
race out of your fucking cubicle.

2969
02:43:31,151 --> 02:43:32,900
You're nodding off every day.
Right.

2970
02:43:33,190 --> 02:43:36,500
Is that reaction you get when you
disbelieve somebody? Oh, you just,

2971
02:43:36,520 --> 02:43:38,750
just skeptical about them is that
they think that you're being,

2972
02:43:38,751 --> 02:43:41,670
you know that you're judging them, but
really you're just being, you know,

2973
02:43:41,680 --> 02:43:44,080
being somewhat scientific
about it. No, that's you.

2974
02:43:44,081 --> 02:43:46,960
I'm judging them and they were
doing very different things,

2975
02:43:47,180 --> 02:43:49,510
but they claim to be very open minded,

2976
02:43:49,511 --> 02:43:52,420
but really the pretty much the opposite
of open minded because they will only

2977
02:43:52,421 --> 02:43:55,090
believe that there are particular
interpretation of results and they think

2978
02:43:55,091 --> 02:43:57,970
because they're interpretation is
different from everybody else's.

2979
02:43:57,971 --> 02:44:01,660
That means that they are being open
minded just means that's a very,

2980
02:44:01,661 --> 02:44:03,250
very narrow minded outside

2981
02:44:03,660 --> 02:44:06,690
incredibly butthurt. If you
call them on it, God damn it.

2982
02:44:06,720 --> 02:44:09,750
No one's more butthurt then conspiracy
theorist, if you disagree with them,

2983
02:44:09,751 --> 02:44:12,360
it gets emotional.
So God damn fast.

2984
02:44:12,650 --> 02:44:15,570
Out of all the things that have
disagreed with with people,

2985
02:44:15,690 --> 02:44:20,690
whether it was a controversial issues
like males changing transgendered female

2986
02:44:21,360 --> 02:44:22,193
getting to fighting,

2987
02:44:22,290 --> 02:44:25,800
nothing got people more pissed off
than the chem trail thing. Yeah,

2988
02:44:25,860 --> 02:44:29,580
that's amazing to me. Amazing.
Amazing. In that sense,

2989
02:44:29,581 --> 02:44:30,810
it kind of feels as though they're,

2990
02:44:30,820 --> 02:44:35,820
they're less concerned about chem trails
are just an excuse to garner around an

2991
02:44:36,151 --> 02:44:40,800
issue that makes them feel like there's
a fight to be had. It's real simple.

2992
02:44:40,830 --> 02:44:41,400
They're lazy.

2993
02:44:41,400 --> 02:44:44,440
They're only taking a few steps for taking
a few steps and looking at things and

2994
02:44:44,441 --> 02:44:47,400
then the defending that position to get
into that position and then they rocked

2995
02:44:47,401 --> 02:44:49,080
up position hard.
The really nutty,

2996
02:44:49,081 --> 02:44:51,810
aggressive people that are going after
people on law and you fuck government

2997
02:44:51,811 --> 02:44:55,410
shoe, like you just guts go and look
at what the fuck you're talking about.

2998
02:44:55,570 --> 02:44:58,060
It doesn't mean the government
didn't organize Northwoods.

2999
02:44:58,440 --> 02:45:01,710
The government was at the Joint Chiefs
of Staff signed a document saying they

3000
02:45:01,711 --> 02:45:04,740
were going to fucking bomb Guantanamo Bay.
They're going to arb,

3001
02:45:04,741 --> 02:45:08,790
cumin friendlies and attack Guantanamo
Bay. That's a real, didn't happen.

3002
02:45:08,940 --> 02:45:13,800
But people do try to do shit and when
you pretend that something's happening,

3003
02:45:13,801 --> 02:45:14,640
that's not happening.

3004
02:45:14,760 --> 02:45:18,300
You cheapen everything where there's
really something going on or the burden of

3005
02:45:18,301 --> 02:45:20,660
proof is on you to prove
what you're saying you,

3006
02:45:20,661 --> 02:45:25,170
you can't just come out and say a bunch
of stuff and not have any anything I can.

3007
02:45:25,171 --> 02:45:26,220
But you're talking logical.

3008
02:45:26,350 --> 02:45:29,890
Yeah. The the the theorists, they
also, they, they go into things in too,

3009
02:45:29,891 --> 02:45:34,030
a lot of breadth but not depth.
So once you've debunk something,

3010
02:45:34,060 --> 02:45:36,880
they don't actually like, you know,
tried to come back on that thing.

3011
02:45:36,881 --> 02:45:39,190
They just move onto the next thing.
So you've got this, this long,

3012
02:45:39,191 --> 02:45:42,460
long lists of hundreds and hundreds of
hundreds of pieces of evidences. Uh,

3013
02:45:42,490 --> 02:45:45,490
but I've an interesting, but any
one, you can go into any depth.

3014
02:45:45,491 --> 02:45:48,490
You could actually prove absolutely.
That is not true. But they,

3015
02:45:48,491 --> 02:45:50,200
as soon as you start to get in there,

3016
02:45:50,590 --> 02:45:52,930
they will just drop it and
they'll move on to the next.

3017
02:45:53,210 --> 02:45:56,810
Yeah. It becomes a, it becomes
a weird thing in your head.

3018
02:45:56,960 --> 02:45:59,010
That's actually really interesting though,
that they just want it to be real.

3019
02:45:59,340 --> 02:46:02,590
Hi, this is this one guy who thinks
that a UV radiation is really,

3020
02:46:02,591 --> 02:46:04,090
really high at the moment.
And he has these,

3021
02:46:04,091 --> 02:46:07,270
these readings that you did with
this crappy cheap meters that he had.

3022
02:46:07,630 --> 02:46:10,090
This is the chem shell dude.
Yeah. You debated, this

3023
02:46:10,090 --> 02:46:14,990
is a 70 minute transcription, a 70
minute debate. It's really fascinating.

3024
02:46:15,470 --> 02:46:19,150
He read the whole thing. Yes. Yeah. I read
it off. Yeah. So he, he basically started,

3025
02:46:20,100 --> 02:46:20,630
I got problem.

3026
02:46:20,630 --> 02:46:24,620
He thinks that there's so much radiation
coming down that it's actually the

3027
02:46:24,621 --> 02:46:27,500
levels is measuring is more than
they're actually using in space.

3028
02:46:27,740 --> 02:46:28,790
Well it was interesting.

3029
02:46:28,791 --> 02:46:33,260
I need to watch the actual video because
I could picture it taking place like

3030
02:46:33,261 --> 02:46:37,200
when you would call them on things and
he had literally no response to like the,

3031
02:46:37,220 --> 02:46:41,130
you know, the, the differences that you
guys had between, you know, what was uh,

3032
02:46:41,240 --> 02:46:44,570
what was actually happening with the
sky and what was actually been proven.

3033
02:46:44,571 --> 02:46:47,930
Like these kind of no evidence
he's saying these claims.

3034
02:46:47,990 --> 02:46:49,760
It went from one thing to the next one.
You will say,

3035
02:46:49,761 --> 02:46:52,370
well what about the gaps in contracts
and explaining what they say. Oh,

3036
02:46:52,371 --> 02:46:55,400
what about these things coming off the
back of Casey tends and I would explain

3037
02:46:55,401 --> 02:46:57,590
what that is. And then you were
talking about the UV radiation.

3038
02:46:57,591 --> 02:46:58,710
That was when things got really weird.

3039
02:46:58,711 --> 02:47:01,310
It was like you were saying
like where's the results?

3040
02:47:01,311 --> 02:47:03,200
Like where are the medical
results of this changing,

3041
02:47:03,201 --> 02:47:07,030
this dangerous change in the environment
if the levels go away. He said,

3042
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:10,760
and he's like,
they were it like 20 times normal UVB.

3043
02:47:10,761 --> 02:47:14,450
Which is what causes like skin
cancer on sunburn. Just reading.

3044
02:47:14,451 --> 02:47:17,450
It was just like a picture of the
pausing and the panic in the room.

3045
02:47:18,350 --> 02:47:21,620
It was so crazy. It's like used to
be, he deserves to be of course,

3046
02:47:22,110 --> 02:47:25,100
but he was very, very eloquent
and very well spoken when he,

3047
02:47:25,130 --> 02:47:29,030
when he debated is extremely
competent in his viewpoint,

3048
02:47:29,031 --> 02:47:32,330
but it was this very narrow viewpoint
and it would just stick to his point and

3049
02:47:32,331 --> 02:47:36,200
he would keep going off on
this long litany is where
he would repeat his like 12

3050
02:47:36,201 --> 02:47:40,940
talking point. Yeah, it's real. It's
actually scary. That's almost a sociopath.

3051
02:47:40,941 --> 02:47:42,680
Somebody doesn't is not
even emotional about it,

3052
02:47:42,681 --> 02:47:45,140
but rather just kind of like he
wants emotional though. He was,

3053
02:47:45,141 --> 02:47:47,690
he was very passionate about
this. Not that Brian, it's just,

3054
02:47:47,691 --> 02:47:51,170
it's complete conviction
in their stupid idea.

3055
02:47:51,530 --> 02:47:55,220
It's confirmation bias to its
extreme and complete conviction.

3056
02:47:55,221 --> 02:47:59,150
And I in an idea that doesn't
rejection of, of people like me,

3057
02:47:59,180 --> 02:48:03,110
like not just reduction
of you, but a reduction of
contradictory evidence period.

3058
02:48:03,200 --> 02:48:04,030
Yeah.
Because I'm the,

3059
02:48:04,030 --> 02:48:06,980
I'm going to a person who's
actually giving them that
contradictory evidence and

3060
02:48:06,981 --> 02:48:11,460
he's totally convinced that I'm a paid
shill. Yeah. He's, he's it done this long.

3061
02:48:11,461 --> 02:48:14,750
Are you sure you're not a paid shill? A
you do, you get checks every week and go,

3062
02:48:14,751 --> 02:48:15,584
where'd that come from?

3063
02:48:16,730 --> 02:48:20,180
My wife complains about me spending
money on my web hosting because it's,

3064
02:48:20,380 --> 02:48:22,130
you know,
it's coming out of our budget.

3065
02:48:22,820 --> 02:48:27,080
So you used to run like a computer
game companies that we, yeah. Yeah.

3066
02:48:27,081 --> 02:48:29,720
I never saw the Tony Hawk video games.

3067
02:48:30,020 --> 02:48:33,260
And you sold that and then you decided
once you sold out that you were just

3068
02:48:33,261 --> 02:48:36,100
going to go into hibernation. Uh, and I,

3069
02:48:36,280 --> 02:48:39,260
I stayed there for a few years and then
I just thought I'd go off and do other

3070
02:48:39,261 --> 02:48:43,600
things and ended up doing a debunking.
I didn't leave to go debunking that.

3071
02:48:43,610 --> 02:48:46,950
Just what I ended up doing. What you used
to own? Never soft. That's what he says.

3072
02:48:47,660 --> 02:48:49,900
Oh, that is amazing. Tony Hawk, we,

3073
02:48:50,390 --> 02:48:52,140
we grew up with Tony Hawk
and everything like that.

3074
02:48:52,141 --> 02:48:55,070
It's one of my favorite was one of my
favorite companies is distraction that you

3075
02:48:55,080 --> 02:48:58,540
created. Cool. I would talk to you
about never saw fall day. So you own,

3076
02:48:58,550 --> 02:49:02,450
you own that company and sold it and
then a thought of it. Oh Wow. Awesome.

3077
02:49:02,600 --> 02:49:07,230
So when you decided to kick back and you
know, not work anymore after he sold it,

3078
02:49:07,600 --> 02:49:07,980
how did

3079
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:09,970
you get started in this whole
debunking thing? Did it,

3080
02:49:10,030 --> 02:49:11,280
was it start with one issue?

3081
02:49:11,330 --> 02:49:12,163
Yeah,

3082
02:49:13,370 --> 02:49:17,570
it started with the on Wikipedia and I
was doing crap about biblical scientific

3083
02:49:17,571 --> 02:49:19,280
for knowledge and that was
just kind of me doing my,

3084
02:49:19,540 --> 02:49:23,080
my naive debunker guy where I
saw something that was wrong.

3085
02:49:23,110 --> 02:49:25,940
So I started like typing a bunch of
stuff that's wrong and I'm going issue to

3086
02:49:25,941 --> 02:49:26,990
issue,
uh,

3087
02:49:27,020 --> 02:49:30,680
like point to point and just like slapping
them down and then I moved on to more

3088
02:49:30,681 --> 02:49:33,190
gallons, which uh, you know, you did.

3089
02:49:33,260 --> 02:49:34,640
Yeah,
we covered much more,

3090
02:49:34,641 --> 02:49:39,641
more jealous in the show then we got
the chance to put in because of the

3091
02:49:39,770 --> 02:49:42,340
limitations that it was
[inaudible] file apocalypse thing.

3092
02:49:42,650 --> 02:49:44,660
Most likely it's this two things,

3093
02:49:44,690 --> 02:49:47,540
most likely some people
they have a an issue with.

3094
02:49:47,541 --> 02:49:50,000
They're cutting their skin open and
sticking things in there and there, there,

3095
02:49:50,001 --> 02:49:51,200
there,
there are people that have that,

3096
02:49:51,550 --> 02:49:55,970
but there's also a bunch of people that
have Lyme disease and they think it's

3097
02:49:55,971 --> 02:50:00,170
hyperkeratinization might be occurring
Lyme disease apparently when a tick bites

3098
02:50:00,171 --> 02:50:00,261
you.

3099
02:50:00,261 --> 02:50:02,990
And this is the most recent thing from
the more gentleman's conference that I

3100
02:50:02,991 --> 02:50:06,770
went to an Austin up this year. So w
what they call their studies or science.

3101
02:50:07,010 --> 02:50:09,820
I don't know who's right or
who's wrong. Stigmata but
there's no, no, no, no, no, no,

3102
02:50:09,821 --> 02:50:10,654
no, no, no, no, no, no.

3103
02:50:10,700 --> 02:50:13,730
The more challenge is a disease where
they get these fibers that are growing out

3104
02:50:13,731 --> 02:50:15,350
of their skin. Um, what,

3105
02:50:15,470 --> 02:50:20,470
what the doctors that have at claim is
that it's Lyme disease and they all test

3106
02:50:20,691 --> 02:50:23,210
positive for Lyme disease apparently.
And hyperkeratinization,

3107
02:50:23,390 --> 02:50:27,260
which is some sort of a side effect of
something that comes along with the Lyme

3108
02:50:27,261 --> 02:50:30,560
disease. And the idea is that the tick
is not just carrying one pathogen,

3109
02:50:30,740 --> 02:50:33,560
it's probably carrying several
and some of them even undiagnosed.

3110
02:50:33,710 --> 02:50:37,910
So it pygmies or a piggy backs
rather along with Lyme disease.

3111
02:50:37,940 --> 02:50:39,680
This is what the doctors had habit belief.

3112
02:50:39,820 --> 02:50:40,451
Well yeah,

3113
02:50:40,451 --> 02:50:43,450
but those are the same guys that
basically kind of invented it in the first

3114
02:50:43,451 --> 02:50:46,960
place. That, that one guy that you told
her, that kind of twitchy guy. Yes. Uh,

3115
02:50:47,140 --> 02:50:48,760
he invented it and they didn't invent it,

3116
02:50:48,761 --> 02:50:50,800
but he was part of the
Morgellons research foundation,

3117
02:50:50,801 --> 02:50:51,820
which doesn't exist anymore,

3118
02:50:52,120 --> 02:50:55,480
which is an original group of people
who kind of like promoted it and got it

3119
02:50:55,481 --> 02:50:58,660
into the, into the media, uh,
back about, you know, six,

3120
02:50:58,661 --> 02:51:02,320
seven years ago when I got the CDC to
investigator when really it isn't very

3121
02:51:02,321 --> 02:51:06,560
much evidence to say that it is a
distinct disease at all. So that was,

3122
02:51:06,580 --> 02:51:09,730
that was kind of what I was debunking
was that the people saying the walls

3123
02:51:09,731 --> 02:51:12,450
evidence, the, the, some thing going
on when really there wasn't it.

3124
02:51:12,490 --> 02:51:15,210
So these doctors that are saying
that this is hypercare team,

3125
02:51:15,280 --> 02:51:16,113
we're running out of time,

3126
02:51:17,070 --> 02:51:20,610
uh, about four minutes. Dammit.

3127
02:51:21,120 --> 02:51:22,230
We could go on about this forever.

3128
02:51:22,231 --> 02:51:24,750
I really need to talk to you about
this because this is quite fascinating

3129
02:51:24,870 --> 02:51:27,120
because they were having me convinced
that it's something to do with Lyme

3130
02:51:27,121 --> 02:51:29,580
disease. Yeah. Not The big theory.
Like what, but one of the doctors,

3131
02:51:29,810 --> 02:51:31,500
what are they getting these
sores all over their body?

3132
02:51:31,501 --> 02:51:32,334
Then what do you think it is?

3133
02:51:32,550 --> 02:51:36,300
It's a neurotic excoriation systemical
to investigate the scratching themselves,

3134
02:51:36,330 --> 02:51:38,760
but how they do it in spots on their
back that can't even read it. They can.

3135
02:51:38,761 --> 02:51:40,810
They can.
Those photos of people who happened,

3136
02:51:40,830 --> 02:51:42,260
your Arctic explorations
on the back of the day,

3137
02:51:42,280 --> 02:51:45,360
they match exactly the patterns
of the people who, uh, who have,

3138
02:51:45,390 --> 02:51:48,140
what about the people that show these
extra hairs that are coming out?

3139
02:51:48,141 --> 02:51:52,350
They've taken photographs of these like
five and six clumps of hair that are

3140
02:51:52,351 --> 02:51:55,040
like popping out of these areas what
they're calling hyperkeratinization.

3141
02:51:55,060 --> 02:51:56,190
You think that's bullshit too?
No,

3142
02:51:56,191 --> 02:51:59,340
that's probably just a
normal dermatological
condition. Like people just,

3143
02:51:59,400 --> 02:52:00,400
they have articles and get,

3144
02:52:00,430 --> 02:52:04,020
but they're saying that that's occurring
and a lot of their little sores. Yeah.

3145
02:52:04,021 --> 02:52:06,030
Now that that's just a
lot of those just fibers

3146
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:08,740
getting caught in this and we're going
to have to do this again sometime.

3147
02:52:08,741 --> 02:52:12,010
God dammit. Yeah, we have too much shit
to talk about. We can keep going on.

3148
02:52:12,040 --> 02:52:15,410
I'll talk to you about just more jealous
for the next 20 minutes and people were

3149
02:52:15,411 --> 02:52:19,820
like, Yay. People at
the, on the, on the uh,

3150
02:52:20,980 --> 02:52:22,290
treadmills right now. I'm going, yeah,

3151
02:52:22,291 --> 02:52:25,270
I was hoping you were going to talk about
festering fucking diseases of the skin.

3152
02:52:25,370 --> 02:52:27,910
I can, there's 20 minutes to
class next. I'll listen man.

3153
02:52:27,940 --> 02:52:31,150
It's been very interesting. Thank you
very much. Let's do it again for sure.

3154
02:52:31,270 --> 02:52:33,070
Come back and we'll find
some more shit to do.

3155
02:52:33,071 --> 02:52:36,730
Bunk and hopefully I can get somebody
who believes in chem trails that believes

3156
02:52:36,731 --> 02:52:39,220
that government is spraying.
There is evidence to come here and do it.

3157
02:52:39,221 --> 02:52:43,750
I tried but they all passed or the one
that I tried that I reached out to past.

3158
02:52:45,340 --> 02:52:47,590
There it is ladies and gentlemen,
folks, we'll be back later this week.

3159
02:52:47,591 --> 02:52:49,600
Most likely tomorrow.
I'm working on my schedule.
